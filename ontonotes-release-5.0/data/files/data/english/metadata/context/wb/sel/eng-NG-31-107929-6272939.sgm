I've been having some problems with my brakes, and I asked my mechanic
if he would be willing to perform a "line-lock test" to help determine
the problem. A line-lock test involves clamping off each brake line to
keep brake fluid from flowing through. If all lines are clamped, the
pedal should be high and hard.

Anyway, the mechanic said that he would never clamp brake lines
because they have metal mesh inside of them and he would be worried he
would crimp the metal, or at the very least create a weak spot in the
line where a bulge or even burst could occur.

Can anyone else weigh in on this debate? I'm planning to take my car
to him this afternoon - so quick response would be helpful! Thanks!

I dont remember anyone on here that has recommended this type of test.
Maybe Im wrong.

You seem determined to do this, so go with it and take your lumps.

Brakes are in general not rocket science.  I understand you are anxious
to get this system working properly, but suggest you find a mechanic
you trust and let him do it, or you do the job yourself, however you want
to do it.

I agree with the mechanic.  Clamping a brake line closed seems like a
very poor idea no matter the internal construction.  If the mechanic
is a good one I would describe the symptoms, i.e, soft pedal, slowly
sinking pedal,  grabbing brake, etc., and ask that it be fixed.  I
would avoid the temptation to either lay out the tests for him to
undertake and or otherwise direct the repair.

The problem I'm having is that the mechanic says he "thinks" it's a
rear caliper - but he says he can't prove it to me, that there are no
real 'tests' that can point to a bad caliper, and he says that all he
can do is replace it (for ~$600) He has also admitted that there is a
small possibility that he is wrong, and he will replace the caliper
and brakes will still feel the same.

Oh, yeah, it might be important to mention that the symptoms I'm
having are spongy brakes with farther pedal travel than I'm used to. I
just had the mechanic replace the front brakes pads &amp; rotors - that's
when the problem showed up. He said he had to unstick a rear caliper
because the rear wheel wouldn't turn. Up to that point, I had seen no
symptoms that the rear caliper was stuck (no excessive drag, no
pulling to one side during braking, no smell, etc). So the mechanic is
sure the rear caliper is stuck or sluggish, but he says that there's
no way to prove it.

Anyone have any advice?

Jack up the rear wheel and see if it spins freely

I always thought a 'line lock test' was performed by disconnecting the
line in question and plugging it with the proper fitting not putting
vise grips on the rubber line.

Well, if the rear caliper was indeed stuck then you may very well have
found the culprit.  But rust can cause a rotor to stop from turning
too.  If this is a competent mechanic who has done good work for you
before, then I would go with his judgement.

$600 seems pretty high for a rebuilt caliper. And a faulty caliper seems
like an unlikely diagnosis for the symptoms you described. What you
haven't described is probably far more important. How do the brakes
perform when you need to make a panic stop at 60 mph on dry pavement? Does
the pedal level change when you pump the brakes?
The symptoms you are describing might be due to a weak brake hose. Your
test may solve the problem if it causes the weak hose to rupture. Your
best bet is to find another mechanic and get a second opinion.

Your mechanic is correct.

I don't know about modern vehicles with rear calipers, but on an older
vehicle that has a low pedal after a brake job, usually the rear brakes
are just out of adjustment.

Having a seized caliper can accentuate that trouble.  The caliper was
seized so the brake pedal was higher than it 'should' have been.  Now
the caliper moves so the pedal is now 'normal'.

In other words, you were used to the feel of screwed up or broken brakes....

Here's what I don't understand. If my rear caliper was seized a while
before, with the brake pads on the rotor, like the mechanic found it,
I should have felt pull while going slowly, and I would have felt some
slight resistance on start. But the brakes on this car have not
changed in the 7 years I have owned it. And freeing the caliper should
not have caused me to have another 2 inches of play in the brakes. And
currently, when I stop quickly, I have to put my foot down *much*
further (as in several inches) to get the same response I'm used to.
Right? Or am I missing something?

It takes very little volume difference in the rear cylinders to greatly
affect the height the brake pedal grabs at.  Even slightly out of
adjustment shoes will lower the pedal like mad.  Worn out ones also give
low pedal.

I used to be able to do a quick check on that by applying the emergency
brake. If it had lots of travel, expect a low brake pedal.  Adjust it
back up high and the brake pedal came back up radically.  Most disk
brakes use a second system, so that check isn't valid anymore.

Your seized caliper is a mystery part.  Maybe just the pad is worn out
from being seized?

A change that occurs gradually over 7 years is pretty hard to notice. You
get used to it. But something must have changed to prompt you to have
brake work done in the first place. As far as I know you have never said
anything about how effective the brakes are at stopping the vehicle
(before or after the work was done). So why did you have the brakes worked
on? Why just the front pads replaced?

A single caliper has a much bigger bore than the master cylinder and you
have 4 calipers. A very small amount of movement of the caliper pistons
translates to a very large move of the master cylinder piston.

Are you very short? Do your legs not reach far enough?  The reason you
should take it somewhere and get a second opinion is that they will have
the necessary facts to give you an opinion about what to do. Anyone
responding to you on Usenet doesn't have much in the way of facts. They
only have the limited information you have chosen to reveal. If your
brakes are not stopping the vehicle like they should you need to have
someone else look at them.

I also agree with the mechanic.  I would not do such a test unless I
was planning on replacing my brake lines in the near future anyway.
And I can not think of any reason why you would want to do the test
(what's the need)?

Your mechanic is correct.  This line-lock test you have found is not a
good idea.  First off it isn't going to tell you a damn thing and
secondly you stand a good chance of damaging the hoses.

I don't know that they actually have metal inside them; all I've seen
have a fiber that looks like cotton or nylon.  Maybe even fiberglas?
Anyway, it is perfectly OK to do this - IF your brake hoses are new and
in good shape.  If they are iffy, he is correct that damage could occur,
and then you'd have no choice but to replace them.

When I worked with ABS development, it was common practice to clamp off
brake lines when replacing calipers etc. but then again we were dealing
with development vehicles where the hoses were maybe a year old at the
very oldest.  I thought it was a bad practice then, but experience
showed no perceptible difference in performance after proper bleeding
(on a fully instrumented test vehicle, so even a slight change in the
restrictiveness to flow would have been evident,) so at least the new
hoses were able to spring back effectively.  This was done because on a
modern ABS-equipped vehicle, the bleeding procedure is rather involved
if air gets into the HCU.

good luck

Actually, that test *could* in fact tell you something. It would tell
you if the spongy soft pedal was due to the master cylinder leaking
brake lines or with one of the calipers. If you clamp off all brake
lines, the fluid has nowhere to go (can't go to move the pistons), so
the pedal should be high and hard. IF there was a problem in the
master cylinder or one of the lines up to the clamp point, the pedal
would sink or be soft. Also, if everything was fine with the clamps
on, by unclamping brake-by-brake, you could pinpoint which caliper/
piston is having the problem.

Now, I've discovered you really shouldn't clamp the line - but
plugging the line would have the same effect. While not entirely
feasible/useful, please don't immediately shrug off a test because you
don't think someone should do it. Think it through.

By the way - while my mechanic said the test wasn't good for the brake
lines - he actually liked the *idea* of the test and agreed that it
would help with diagnosis (if it was possible to do the test without
possibly damaging the brake lines)

At this point the fact that your mechanic thinks it is a good idea

No that is not correct. Master cylinders can fail in various ways. It
could leak (i.e. fluid bypass the seals) at the top of the stroke but
not at the bottom. To test for that I would not clamp hoses - its easy
enough to plug the ports at the master cylinder. Also he could clamp all
4 calipers with c-clamps while the brakes are applied to see how much
brake pedal he gains from restricting the movement of the calipers.
But all this assumes there is anything at all wrong with the brakes.
His mechanic has apparently told him that the brakes feel different
because the calipers were not moving freely prior to the work.

&gt; The problem I'm having is that the mechanic says he &quot;thinks&quot; it's a
&gt; rear caliper - but he says he can't prove it to me, that there are no
&gt; real 'tests' that can point to a bad caliper, and he says that all he
&gt; can do is replace it (for ~$600) He has also admitted that there is a
&gt; small possibility that he is wrong, and he will replace the caliper
&gt; and brakes will still feel the same.

&gt; Oh, yeah, it might be important to mention that the symptoms I'm
&gt; having are spongy brakes with farther pedal travel than I'm used to. I
&gt; just had the mechanic replace the front brakes pads &amp; rotors - that's
&gt; when the problem showed up. He said he had to unstick a rear caliper
&gt; because the rear wheel wouldn't turn. Up to that point, I had seen no
&gt; symptoms that the rear caliper was stuck (no excessive drag, no
&gt; pulling to one side during braking, no smell, etc). So the mechanic is
&gt; sure the rear caliper is stuck or sluggish, but he says that there's
&gt; no way to prove it.

&gt; Anyone have any advice?

Could it just be that the new pads haven't seated yet? That could
explain the brake feel. The last time I replaced pads and rotors it took
over a thousand miles to start getting the brake feel I expected. Scared

I think someone cut some corners when they did your brakes, or used
low quality materials.

With properly surfaced rotors and pads of good quality, assuming proper
installation, (adjustment if applicable) and preliminary drive-in,  braking

If only part of the Master cylinder bore is scored or pitted that will

&gt;&gt; seal up at three quarters of the travel.

&gt;If only part of the Master cylinder bore is scored or pitted that will
&gt;be exactly what happens. It is not that unusual for a master cylinder to
&gt;leak for only some part of the stroke. Just because you fail to
&gt;understand how something works doesn't make it magical.

I don't think either of us is getting anywhere with the other on this
one...   If other members of the list also think this could be the
problem and that a line lock test would reveal the problem I would
like to hear their experiences to further my own knowledge.

If the car was operating normally and the brakes working as they should

You don't know that is true. I suspect the brakes work much better than
they did before. The OP knows he should get a second opinion. He just
doesn't want to take it to another mechanic who gets to actually look at
the car. He would prefer to get a second opinion from someone on Usenet
who doesn't get to examine the car.

Since a few weeks ago,a neighbor whom owns a small 1987 GMC pickup
truck,he said his truck needs a new brake master cylinder.He said he is
a certified mechanic.He actually works for a door company that installs
the kinds of doors which are used in factories and similar places.Just
out of curiosity,I was wondering about how much money it will cost him
to replace that brake master cylinder?

I pull wrenches less often than I used to, but still enjoy working on my own
stuff.  I have made a few special purpose tools in my day too, and would be
very interested in seeing what you have.

you're thinking of a "hydroboost;" the "hydravac" was a different kind
of brake booster used inline with the brake lines but operated by engine
vacuum.  They were used on STudebaker cars at least and some older
trucks with underfloor master cylinders.

You know - I'm getting sick of people using my post in an attempt to
prove who knows more about brake systems. The reason I posted was not
to get a "second opinion from someone on Usenet who doesn't get to
examine the car". The reason I posted was so I could help educate
myself about the brake system and attempt to understand what MIGHT be
causing the problem to help in my discussion with the mechanic. Even
if everyone had said "Oh, your brakes are fine - don't worry" - I
still would have taken it back to the mechanic.

So, thanks to those of you who actually posted with helpful
information.

Just for anyone who is actually interested, the issue has been
somewhat resolved.

Look Moron. Either your mechanic did a good job on your brakes or he
didn't. From your description there is no way of telling which.

If he screwed up your brakes you need to take it somewhere else because
there is no way you are going to teach him how to fix your brakes - that
just isn't going to happen.

If he didn't screw up your brakes and he did do a proper job, then
getting other morons to agree with you on Usenet so that you can go back
and argue with your mechanic is not going to help you in any way either.

Either way your only sensible option to resolve this is to take it to a
competent mechanic and get a second opinion.
