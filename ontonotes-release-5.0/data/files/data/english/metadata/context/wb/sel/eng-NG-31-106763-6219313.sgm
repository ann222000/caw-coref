Leslie,

Take the powah away from Guinevere (hi, Guin) and Rolla and crazy
Josie. Please, please, please hide the "start a new topic" button.

Let them dump their potato peelings and coffee grounds into one big
thread. We can work around that. But hunting all over heck for the
thread one wants to see is tedious. TEE-DEE-US.

I know I am usually shy and retiring and very polite, but I just had to
speak up on this topic.

Many thanks.

WHAT's surprising is how good looking this guy looks as a female
without sex change, in other words this guy is just a drag queen so she

can't stand having a drag queen in her restroom, but why is the next
question, i don't understand why. SHE doesn't give a reason.

========================================================

Maybe the reason is there are no doors on the stalls.

Nevertheless repeated slaps across the face by the Sons of Mahomet are
finally
succeed in communicating to the foggiest European that those ragged
savages they
imported to do their work for them and patronized relentlessly are
stomping all
over their way of life. And that's something Europeans won't tolerate
for very
long.

http://sultanknish.blogspot.com/2006/10/signs-people-are-getting-sick ...

No it's not a David Letterman Top Ten list and it's nothing something
noticeable
in the United States which has not really suffered from Muslim
occupation yet
the way Europe and Australia have (not counting the Nation of Islam a
portion of
whose murderous spree was recounted in 'Nation of Islam's 275 Murders')

But there are more and more signs in Europe and Australia that people
are
getting mighty sick of Muslims.

All the furore over Australia's top Muslim cleric calling rape victims,

'uncovered meat' who would have been safe if they'd stayed 'in their
room at
home wearing a hijab' and are the ones really to blame for it, is one
sign.

Sheikh Taj Din al-Hilali, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, says
awful things
the way most people will tell you the time. He's said the Holocaust was

manufactured by Zionists and Jews are behind all the wars in the world.
He's
called for the murder of Americans and had ties to Jihadi publications
featuring
material praising Osama Bin Laden. And nothing.

The press did their best to cover up the Muslim factor in the mass gang
rapes
when they actually came to trial and when Muslim figures say something
awful,
they generally ignore it. Not this time. The Aussie press has just
begun sinking
its teeth into the story, interviewing former rape victims, disclosing
Hilali's
terrorist connections and not accepting his excuses or his daughter's
full court
press in his defence. Believe it or not that's something new.

In England Jack Straw said what any European really thinks when
confronted with
a woman dressed in a trash bag, but haven't been allowed to say in a
while. And
most shockingly instead of a roar of outrage by the press, there was a
lot of
agreeable muttering along the lines of, 'well the fellow's got a
point.'

In France the Foreign Minister said that he had been wrong and now
understood
Israel's Separation Fence was necessary. For a French Foreign Minister
this is
akin to Galileo declaring to the Pope, 'And Yet It Moves.' But for all
their
cheese-eating surrender-monkeyness, the French have banned the Hijab,
made
denying the Muslim Turk's genocide against the Armenians illegal and
are out
nightly fighting Muslim rioters.

We might sneer at France but when have we ever done as much
domestically?
Instead we nervously look the other way whenever anyone suggests Islam
might be
the problem. 'Goodness no,' our government insists, 'it's just those
two guys in
a cave who still haven't talked to Karen Hughes and gotten things
straightened
out.' But of course all we had was 9/11. 9/11 was bad but it doesn't
compare to
1/12th of your population consisting of a homicidal death cult who
deciding they
want to take over your country.

And Germany, good old Teutonia, blanched with shock when it realized
the very
possibility of Muslim outrage caused them to cancel a revisionist
artistic
interpretation of a Mozart opera. Mass murder is one thing. Germans are
used to
it. That and sneering at the dirty foreigners they imported to do the
jobs they
don't want to do. Before it was Poles and Slovaks. Now it's Turks. But
causing
them to cancel a Mozart opera, now you've gone too far.

A Danish court threw out a defamation lawsuit over the Mohammed
cartoons. Now in
any European court all it takes to win a defamation lawsuit is usually
to just
show up. France's Channel 2 won the Al-Dura trial by presenting in
evidence a
letter from President Chirac supporting them. That's it. No other
evidence.
(It's also how trials are won in Zimbabwe and North Korea.) But it
seems the
Danes have gotten a little tired of Muslims too.

What is all of this adding up to? It's the vocalization of a growing
wave of
resentment against Muslim immigrants slapping around the natives and
stepping on
their customs. The Europeans decided colonialism was wrong and withdrew
from
Africa, the Middle East and Asia but not without importing millions of
them as
cheap labour. Now they're waking up to realize they're the ones being
colonized
and they're the natives.

This time around Cortez, Christopher Columbus, Captain Cook and Cecil
Rhodes are
Muslims. They didn't come on ships but by visas and are throwing up
their own
colonies everywhere. And the natives are perturbed. They wanted cheap
labour but
they're getting something else entirely. Most of their outrage is
directed at
the Muslim assault on their own native customs.

What Europeans are increasingly realizing is that Muslim minorities are

dictating to them what they can print in their newspapers, what operas
they can
put on, what books they can publish and what their women can wear. For
the last
half century Europe worked hard to create an idyllic socialist utopia
where
everyone was taxed to death and no one hard to work very hard and could
live in
a stupor in beer gardens and beaches and cafes whiling away the fall of
their
civilization. Now they're getting a rude awakening.

Don't get me wrong. Europe is not about to back the War on Terror or
express
much in the way of sympathy for Israel. To the average European, an
America is
still something to be looked at with a vaguely nauseated expression
like a bug
the waiter left on his table. A Jew is looked at the way if the bug was
actually
in his plate mixed in with the food. Nevertheless repeated slaps across
the face
by the Sons of Mahomet are finally succeed in communicating to the
foggiest
European that those ragged savages they imported to do their work for
them and
patronized relentlessly are stomping all over their way of life. And
that's
something Europeans won't tolerate for very long.

Ah, the familiar enmity of NY Times posters.

I see what Epi is getting at with just having the one thread (and
that's pretty much the way our forum worked over there) but as Cheech
said, don't know if it will work.  Also, is there a limit to how many
posts there can be under one thread?  Another forum I visit allows
thirty posts, then they get archived.

Change of subject.

Anybody see the article on the African enslavement of children?  Who
can read it w/o getting furious at those nuts who want to drag Madonna
through the courts for wanting to take one child out of a hell hole?
Why don't they go to the countries where these children are sold or
'leased' by their families at the age of 6 to be worked into an early
grave?

Also, if these were white children, little blonde, blue-eyed waifs
bailing out fishing boats for fourteen hours a day on two meals, there
would be a furor.  Black life is cheap on this planet.

"Why don't they go to the countries where these children are sold or
'leased' by their families at the age of 6 to be worked into an early
grave?"

Here's the thing, Kathleen, most African cultures have not evolved
beyond the dark ages. If you looked out your window and saw a nomadic
tribe drift into the neighborhood and proceed to put their goats out to
graze and then watched them go into the nearby woods and start cutting
firewood and felling trees to built huts, you would be stunned. And
why? Because this is not the way people in this country live. Haven't
for more than a century.

We have nothing in common with those cultures. The western world can
only help so much. Many of these cultures don't want to change. We
cannot end poverty in the U.S. Ain't no way we can do it in Africa. The
leadership in most of those nations is corrupt and the financial aid
they do receive is used to build palaces and arm the military.

The only thing different now is that global communication and 24/7 news
channels can bring this stuff to your doorstep.  I'm not telling you to
not care . . . just asking you to be realistic.

That silly Epi has come up with the solution. We can have our cake and
