ES&amp;S to be Rebuked, Fined and Possibly Banned in CA?
By Kim Zetter

Tuesday 21 August 2007

California announced today that it plans to hold an
administrative hearing on September 20th to discuss the fate of
Election Systems &amp; Software for violating state election codes. ES&amp;S,
the top voting machine company in the country, is being accused of
selling at least five CA counties a version of its AutoMark ballot
marking system that hadn't yet been tested or certified for use in
the state or the country.

ES&amp;S apparently sold at least about 1,000 uncertified machines to
San Francisco, Marin, Colusa, Solano and Merced counties. (The number
of uncertified machines delivered to California was supplied by ES&amp;S
to the state; CA officials have yet to conduct their own inventory to
determine if more machines are involved.)

Per CA law, ES&amp;S could be fined $10,000 per uncertified voting
system unit (or $9.72 million) and be required to give a complete
refund to counties of all money spent on the machines - the latter
would amount to about $5 million.

Additionally, ES&amp;S could be barred from doing any business in the
state for between 1 and 3 years, which would impact more than just
the five counties mentioned - potentially affecting more than 14
counties that use ES&amp;S machines, including Los Angeles County.

The issue raises questions about how many other uncertified
AutoMarks the company may have sold to other states.

ES&amp;S did not respond to a request for comment in time for
publication.

The AutoMark A100 was certified for use in California in August
2005. However, in 2006, ES&amp;S, by its own admission, sold about 1,000
units of its subsequent AutoMark model - the A200 version - to five
CA counties months before the system passed federal qualification
testing in August 2006. Voting machines generally undergo two stages
of testing and certification, first by independent testing labs
overseen by the federal government and then by the states themselves.
But according to secretary of state spokeswoman Nicole Winger ES&amp;S
still has not submitted the A200 system to the state to examine and
certify.

Winger also says that the A200 machines had stickers on them (see
photo below) that identified them as having passed federal
qualification testing, when they hadn't yet passed that testing.
Winger says that the qualification stickers that were placed on the
A200 machines were the stickers that are supposed to apply only to
A100 machines. Winger says it's possible that the stickers were
applied in error. But if ES&amp;S deliberately placed the stickers on the
machines it could suggest a deliberate attempt on the part of the
company to deceive California election officials.

&quot;We are in the early stages of learning about the facts,&quot; Winger
told me. &quot;We don't know who would have applied the A100 stickers to
uncertified equipment.&quot;

Winger said the differences between the A100 and A200 systems are
significant and easily identified just through visual inspection (see
the photos above at right). The size of the motherboard and the types
of wiring inside the machines are just two examples of the
differences.

&quot;Those are the first things on visual inspection that even a
computer novice would notice,&quot; Winger says.

ES&amp;S is not the first voting machine company to have sold
uncertified equipment in CA. In 2003, the state discovered that
Diebold Election Systems had installed uncertified software in
machines in 17 counties. (UPDATE: Joseph Hall at UC Berkeley reminds
me that Diebold wasn't the only company that had uncertified software
running in CA counties in 2003. A subsequent review of all election
software in the state at that time found that eight counties were
using versions of ES&amp;S software that had not been federally qualified
or state certified. Other counties were also found to be using
uncertified software made by vendors other than ES&amp;S and Diebold.)

Stephen Weir, the clerk for Contra Costa County, which has 762
AutoMark units as part of a $14 million contract with ES&amp;S, supports
Bowen's decision to punish ES&amp;S for violating state laws - although
his county isn't among those that received uncertified equipment.

&quot;If a vendor is using equipment in California that is not
certified, they need to get busted,&quot; he told me. &quot;If in fact (Bowen
has) found equipment that was not ceritifed, that's a violation of
not just the trust that a vendor has with election officials and the
state, that's a violation of law.&quot;

The AutoMark is a ballot marking device that is a hybrid between
a touch-screen machine and an optical-scan unit. Voters insert a
full-size paper ballot into the system and make their selections on a
touch-screen. The machine marks their selections on the ballot before
returning the ballot to voters. The ballot is then passed through an
optical scanner and tabulated. The machine has been touted as an
answer to both the accessibility issues involving disabled voters and
the verification issues around paperless touch-screen machines since
the machines include audio for blind voters and use a full-size paper
ballot that voters can verify before submitting it to be scanned and
tabulated.

ES&amp;S has been the focus of much attention in recent months. Last
week Dan Rather Reports disclosed that the company was assembling its
touchscreen machines in a sweatshop factory in Manila, the
Philippines. The company's touch-screen machines are also at the core
of a disputed election in Sarasota, Florida.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ES&amp;S to be Rebuked, Fined and Possibly Banned in CA?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     By Kim Zetter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Wired.com

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Tuesday 21 August 2007

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     California announced today that it plans to hold an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; administrative hearing on September 20th to discuss the fate of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Election Systems &amp; Software for violating state election codes. ES&amp;S,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the top voting machine company in the country, is being accused of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; selling at least five CA counties a version of its AutoMark ballot
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; marking system that hadn't yet been tested or certified for use in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the state or the country.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     ES&amp;S apparently sold at least about 1,000 uncertified machines to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; San Francisco, Marin, Colusa, Solano and Merced counties. (The number
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of uncertified machines delivered to California was supplied by ES&amp;S
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the state; CA officials have yet to conduct their own inventory to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; determine if more machines are involved.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Per CA law, ES&amp;S could be fined $10,000 per uncertified voting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system unit (or $9.72 million) and be required to give a complete
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; refund to counties of all money spent on the machines - the latter
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would amount to about $5 million.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Additionally, ES&amp;S could be barred from doing any business in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state for between 1 and 3 years, which would impact more than just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the five counties mentioned - potentially affecting more than 14
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counties that use ES&amp;S machines, including Los Angeles County.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     The issue raises questions about how many other uncertified
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AutoMarks the company may have sold to other states.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     ES&amp;S did not respond to a request for comment in time for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; publication.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     The AutoMark A100 was certified for use in California in August
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2005. However, in 2006, ES&amp;S, by its own admission, sold about 1,000
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; units of its subsequent AutoMark model - the A200 version - to five
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; CA counties months before the system passed federal qualification
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; testing in August 2006. Voting machines generally undergo two stages
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of testing and certification, first by independent testing labs
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overseen by the federal government and then by the states themselves.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But according to secretary of state spokeswoman Nicole Winger ES&amp;S
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still has not submitted the A200 system to the state to examine and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certify.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Winger also says that the A200 machines had stickers on them (see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; photo below) that identified them as having passed federal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; qualification testing, when they hadn't yet passed that testing.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Winger says that the qualification stickers that were placed on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A200 machines were the stickers that are supposed to apply only to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A100 machines. Winger says it's possible that the stickers were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; applied in error. But if ES&amp;S deliberately placed the stickers on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; machines it could suggest a deliberate attempt on the part of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; company to deceive California election officials.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;We are in the early stages of learning about the facts,&quot; Winger
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me. &quot;We don't know who would have applied the A100 stickers to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uncertified equipment.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Winger said the differences between the A100 and A200 systems are
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; significant and easily identified just through visual inspection (see
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the photos above at right). The size of the motherboard and the types
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of wiring inside the machines are just two examples of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differences.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;Those are the first things on visual inspection that even a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; computer novice would notice,&quot; Winger says.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     ES&amp;S is not the first voting machine company to have sold
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uncertified equipment in CA. In 2003, the state discovered that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Diebold Election Systems had installed uncertified software in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; machines in 17 counties. (UPDATE: Joseph Hall at UC Berkeley reminds
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me that Diebold wasn't the only company that had uncertified software
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; running in CA counties in 2003. A subsequent review of all election
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; software in the state at that time found that eight counties were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using versions of ES&amp;S software that had not been federally qualified
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or state certified. Other counties were also found to be using
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uncertified software made by vendors other than ES&amp;S and Diebold.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     Stephen Weir, the clerk for Contra Costa County, which has 762
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AutoMark units as part of a $14 million contract with ES&amp;S, supports
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bowen's decision to punish ES&amp;S for violating state laws - although
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his county isn't among those that received uncertified equipment.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     &quot;If a vendor is using equipment in California that is not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certified, they need to get busted,&quot; he told me. &quot;If in fact (Bowen
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has) found equipment that was not ceritifed, that's a violation of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not just the trust that a vendor has with election officials and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state, that's a violation of law.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     The AutoMark is a ballot marking device that is a hybrid between
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a touch-screen machine and an optical-scan unit. Voters insert a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full-size paper ballot into the system and make their selections on a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; touch-screen. The machine marks their selections on the ballot before
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; returning the ballot to voters. The ballot is then passed through an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; optical scanner and tabulated. The machine has been touted as an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answer to both the accessibility issues involving disabled voters and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the verification issues around paperless touch-screen machines since
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the machines include audio for blind voters and use a full-size paper
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ballot that voters can verify before submitting it to be scanned and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tabulated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     ES&amp;S has been the focus of much attention in recent months. Last
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; week Dan Rather Reports disclosed that the company was assembling its
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; touchscreen machines in a sweatshop factory in Manila, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Philippines. The company's touch-screen machines are also at the core
