Five earthquakes in the last seven days reflecting mantle growth
balancing 137 around the Pacific causing its destruction.

Weird, ..huh?

--------------------------------------------------------------
SUBDUCTION ZONES HAVE TOO MUCH ENERGY TO BE EXPLAINED BY PLATE
TECTONICS.

90% of the Earth's seismic energy is released in subduction zones in
Large-magnitude earthquakes (&gt;7.0 Magnitude) that reach to 600-800km
depth.   That leaves about 10% of energy to be released at the
spreading ridges where most movement takes place on transform faults.
But cycling convection expressed as movement in brittle crust should
logically require a rough equivalence of energy release between zones
where mantle crust is being moved along at the spreading ridges, and
zones where mantle crust is being moved down in subduction zones.
Plate Tectonics explains this by saying that the oceanic lithosphere
(which is the convecting agent) is only as thick as the crust at the
ridges (about 10-12km) (where it is hot and rising), ..and more than
ten times as thick in subduction zones (where it is cool and sinking),
i.e., approximtely ten times more energy should be needed to move
thicker crust than thinner crust.  However between the ridges and the
subduction zones the ocean floors are seismically silent; i.e.,
spreading ridges and subduction zones are seismically (and therefore
tectonically) disconnected.  This 'disconnect' is not explained in
Plate Tectonics - apparently no energy at all is required to move the
thousands of kilometres ocean floor from spreading ridge to subduction
zone.  Plate Tectonics does not even attempt to explain this conundrum
other than by proferring its concept of "ridge-push", ...the concept
that eight to ten kilometres of mantle crust at the ridges can push
around two hundred kilometres of oceanic lithosphere down subduction
zones, with absolutely no semblance of deformation or seismic activity
in between.

Moreover, the energy release in subduction zones supposedly derives
from the oceanic plate grinding down at an angle beneath the
continental lithospheric plate, yet a gravitationally falling slab
falls vertically, ..there should be no grinding movement at all, but
some semblance of pull-apart analogous to that at the ridges. Plate
Tectonics meets this one in the concept of back-arc basin formation
(e.g. in the Western Pacific), but is then faced with the conundrum
how the oceanic slab grinding down beneath the continental lithosphere
and compressing it can pull off large fragments of continental crust
in the opposite direction.  To meet this one it invokes the vertical
movement just mentioned: just as the water moves over a vertically
sinking ship , so the continental lithosphere moves over the sinking
oceanic slab.  So is the slab grinding down at an angle?  Or is it
sinking vertically?  Both, according to the hat-magic of Plate
Tectonics, whichever best fits requirements.

Such is Plate Tectonics' need for a conceptual zone of destruction it
overlooks the conundrums which derive from linking spreading ridges to
subduction zones.  Certainly they are related, but not in the way
Plate Tectonics assumes them to be.  The difference in seismic energy
has nothing to do with conceptual convection, but everything to do
with the empirical dynamics of enlargement and spin as are evidenced
in the surface geology of the planet, ignored by Plate Tectonicists in
their need to maintain conceptual solidarity.

The bit that gets me is in amongst all this "moving plates" "
crumpling crust" ' ridge-push - slab-pull nonsense is that the whole
lithosphere can move so silently.  I mean, ..it's not silent where it
pushes and it's ten times as not silent where it pulls, and yet the
bit in between which must be like taffy in this sandwich, and get
pushed and pulled every which way,  is as silent as the grave.

And what's more, ..this 'graveyard' is as big as all the oceans in the
world put together, ..not like the plates which are only segments of
it.  Beyond all the little jaggies at the ridge where the transform
faults are supposed to be active (well they are active), the whole
ocean floors are one big plate, ..not segmented at all, moving all-of-
a-piece (silently) towards the subduction zone, ...and when it gets
there it's supposed to break up again and the different bits move
independently.

Even weirder, ...uh huh?

That's what I don't get, ..the lithosphere makes all that noise at
each end, the end where it's being pushed and the end where it's being
pulled, and in between where it's getting both pushed and pulled it's
as silent as the grave.  I suppose the deformation going one way
cancels out the deformation going the other, which is why it moves
(silently).  (Moves).   But hey, ..wait a minute, .. I can buy the
silence, ...but it's being pulled from one end and pushed from the
other so shouldn't it be really *galloping* across? ..and probably
accellerating?  ( I'll need to revise my take on the silence, I
think..)

Well Stuart thinks knows what he's talking about.  Why don't you ask
him a question?  If you think about it there must be something you can
think of that requires an answer.  Stuff's like that.   Or do you
think it's all a neatly stitched up done deal?  With answers like I
just gave for the silence, ..and the movement?   Plate Tectonics is
full of answers like that - like the crust forcing the mantle down
subduction zones.  That's a real beauty.  I love that answer.  See if
Stu and come away with any more like that.  Nasa, the USGS and
everybody else does, ...so I don't see why he's being so silent, ..he
usually fires right off the mark regurgitating the Wiki.   The
reliable bits, that is....  ....

Trouble is, Timber, ..there's nothing really to talk about that
doesn't go round in circles, because Plate Tectonics got off to such a
bad start at the beginning:-

----------------------------------------------

Plate Tectonics is predicated on the *assumption*
http://users.indigo.net.au/don/nonsense/subass.html
that there must be a *destruction* of the ocean floors equal in area
to its *growth*, ("..otherwise the Earth would be blowing up like a
balloon, ...which it isn't...")   Therefore, ..since creation of the
ocean floors and separation of the continents, which we can see and
are plainly in evidence, is all about enlargement of the Planet, the
evidence for Plate Tectonics lies entirely in the evidence for an
equivalent size reduction, namely in the process known as subduction -
the destruction of an amount of oceanic crust exactly equivalent to
that emplaced at the spreading ridges.   Note that Plate Tectonics
does not deny the elements nor the evidence for global enlargement -
indeed those are half of its thesis (creation of the ocean floors,
separating continents that retrofit like jigsaw pieces etc.), it
simply posits that there must be a commensurate amount of shrinking to
balance it so that the net effect is that the Earth remains the same
size. The 'evidence' for this "shrinking" is the convenient assumption
from the beginning that global enlargement cannot be happening, which
decades of teaching has transformed from frankly admitted assumption
to an incontrovertible 'fact'.  In order that the ocean floors can
grow at the same time as they are being reduced in size elsewhere
Plate Tectonics must make the further assumption that there existed an
ocean equal in size to the combined area of the present ones.  Two
assumptions.  Not parallel ones, but one built on the other.
Geologically there is no basis for either assumption. Indeed all
geological aspects militate towards the conclusion that the assumption
is false and that global enlargment is indeed happening.

(Junk science of the worst sort - assuming its conclusion)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- --

The trouble with you young fellows is that as children you just
accepted what your teacher told you.  Time you were taking them to
task for leading you up the garden path.  30 years, ..virtually, ... a
generation of dirtied slates.  Very difficult to rub out, but it goes
back much further than that.

All observations support expansion. How to explain that continent are

And how is it possible that no ocean floor is older than 200 millions
years if it is created continuously for billions years? It's completely

I've already been asked that question and I've already answered it. That
was a few months ago. Nothing has changed since then.

You tell me: If the earth expanded, then there was some combination of
increase in mass and decrease in density (including zero of either).
Which happened, and how? If it was increase in mass, then where did the
mass come from? If it was decrease in density, then how did all that
material get packed into such a small space, why is it not now, and why
do we not find meteorites that dense?

Indeed. And the explanation are not satisfayng.

Can't you assume that we're facing an unknown physical process.
Obviously we can't explain it yet. but evidence of this phenomenon are
overwhelming.

Moreover, looking at Neal Adams video of Mars, Ganymede, Europa, our
moon, this phenomenon seems to be widespread in the universe
Be sure that denying it won't help to understand it.

&gt; &gt;Indeed. And the explanation are not satisfayng.

&gt; &gt;Here are some facts that are badly (or not) explained by PT but make so
&gt; &gt;much sense with the expansion theory:

&gt; &gt; http://www.4threvolt.com/Evidence/Table.html

&gt; the problem is in that box... that says &quot;previously confirmed&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You tell me: If the earth expanded, then there was some combination of
&gt; &gt;&gt; increase in mass and decrease in density (including zero of either).
&gt; &gt;&gt; Which happened, and how? If it was increase in mass, then where did the
&gt; &gt;&gt; mass come from? If it was decrease in density, then how did all that
&gt; &gt;&gt; material get packed into such a small space, why is it not now, and why
&gt; &gt;&gt; do we not find meteorites that dense?

&gt; &gt;Can't you assume that we're facing an unknown physical process.
&gt; &gt;Obviously we can't explain it yet. but evidence of this phenomenon are
&gt; &gt;overwhelming.

&gt; 1. increasing size doesn't means added mass (which in the case of
&gt; planets is a contracting force, increasing density), not expanding,
&gt; Expanding  Earth would require a gross loss of mass. Now where would
&gt; all the mass go to explain for a 3x growth in size?

&gt; &gt;Moreover, looking at Neal Adams video of Mars, Ganymede, Europa, our
&gt; &gt;moon, this phenomenon seems to be widespread in the universe
&gt; &gt;Be sure that denying it won't help to understand it.
.
&gt; Earth expansion is silly. Earth contraction is silly... a fairly
&gt; steady state WRT to Mass is fully supported by all physical evidence
&gt; found.
">

( Steady state, ..eh?  Was the Big Bang a steady state event? )

----------------------------------------------------------
The mountain belts of the world form a linearly continuous loop that
has been grossly dilated along its axis by the eye-like shape of the
Pacific, swivelling open the Americas to the East and dilating it in
the Asian region  to form the arcuate dilational ruptures of the
Western Pacific.  The linear continuity of the belt, its domination by
flat-lying stratigraphy and first-order extensional structure (i.e.,
not compressional crumple-crust as touted by Plate Tectonics)
militates against any model that sees its topographic elevation to be
due
to compression by the independent movement of so-called "colliding
plates".  Simply on these grounds alone, plate movement is set aside
as untenable.  The question then arises, what is the nature of this
high tract of land, and by what dynamics did it dilate to scissor open
the crust and unhinge the Americas in the Caribbean region, by what
sequence of events did these dynamics progress to give the pattern of
continental disruption we see at the present day, and what are the
remnant fossil expressions of it that inform us of the process?  Since
the Atlantic Indian and Southern Oceans are uncomplicated retrofits
exploration of an answer to these questions shifts to proper
understanding of the relationship of Pacific extrusion to its
bordering landmasses.  This site looks afresh at the evidence and
concludes that Plate Tectonics is untenable and that its core pillar,
the assumption that the Earth cannot be getting bigger, is false: the
Earth is indeed expanding."
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Bottom line rejecting Plate Tectonics as 'science' is, ..

Subduction is a convenient assumption
http://users.indigo.net.au/don/nonsense/subass.html

That's why its so easy to understand at kinergarten level.

That's not what you're supposed to say.  You're supposed to say:-

"Why, ..everyone knows what causes the Earth to get bigger at the
ridges, .. the falling slab due to subduction of course!  When the
oceanic lithosphere meets the continental lithosphere the continental
one pushes the oceanic one down and makes it subduct, and the
subducting slab pulls the ocean floors right back to the ridges so new
stuff gets emplaced at the ridges making the ocean floors bigger."  If
you were as clever as George there you'd probably make some reference
to "slab-pull", and click a few links just to show everybody you know
what you're talking about.  As it is I guess you'll just have to put
up with stating the simple Ptero-logic that the crust pushing the
mantle down is what is making the Earth get bigger - Plate Tectonic
style, ..  ("The floating crust pushing the denser mantle down is what
makes the Earth get bigger")

If the crust was recycling, as PT says it is, where would one predict it to
be doing so?  And what would be the consequences of such recycling?  At the
least, we would expect that brittle, old dense crust recycling into the
mantle would:

1) recycle at locations far removed from where new oceanic crust is
forming.

2) Create zones of large earthquakes as old crust descends into the mantle;

3) result in violent, often cataclysmic volcanism;

4) be the focal points of nearly all known deep focus earthquakes.

Now, Finlay, my dear man, where on earth are these processes occurring? PT
predicts these conditions and where they should occur; and these are, in
fact, the conditions we see at the very subduction zones you claim don't
exist.  If you lived right on the east coast of Australia, and saw your
home overwhelmed by a tsunami generated by a great seaquake in the region
Tonga, would you still believe that subduction zones don't exist?

Since many of us here have posted refutations of all this so-called
evidence of expansion many times over the course of the last few years now,
perhaps you could save us all the time and effort and simply do a search of
this newsgroup for those posts.  When you've done that and can address all
of the serious flaws in the expansionists arguments that we've pointed out
over and over again, come back and post your own serious refutation.
Regurgitating the same canned nonsense over and over again with nothing new
to show for it certainly doesn't help your case. Having said that, it is
not for us to depose expansion. It is for you to prove that it occurs/has
occurred.  It is also for you to show why it is a better model than the
currently accepted one (PT), and to convince us that your model is the best
one available.

Hmmm, Looks like ad hoc predictions to me.

The same predictions would occur if matter from the deep earth was
moving up at the same area:

1) N/A for EE. And not even true for PT! The oceanic crust close to the
putative subduction zone of west americas is not even the oldest one.

2) Large eartquakes due to the stress of the crust push by the incoming
matter.

3) result in violent, often cataclysmic volcanism;

4) be the focal points of nearly all known deep focus earthquakes.

See. The only difference is that you first assume the earth radius is
constant in case of PT so that you need to compensate accretion.

Did somebody try to build a computer simulation of PT to check if it is
possible to make oceanic crust disappear as fast as it appears at the
rifts?

And what evidence do you have that matter is moving up from the deep mantle
at the locations of subduction zones?  The fault movements do not support
your claim.  In fact, the seismic data indicate that the movement is in the
opposite direction.  We have massive upwelling at the location of all the
oceanic spreading centers.  Those centers display invariably the same kinds
of faults, which are primarily normal faults in conjunction with conjugate
transforms.  Subduction zones invariably are associated with megathrust
faulting.  If you had upwelling from deep within the earth occurring at the
locations of the subduction zones, you would see the same seismic and
petrologic features that you see at the spreading centers. We don't see
that at all.

Not only does the seismic data not support your claim, the petrologic data
refutes it as well.  Fresh mantle material, and/or their derivitives are
found everywhere along the MORs.  You do not see any fresh mantle material
or their derivitives in any of the subduction zones.  The volcanics within
subduction zones are unique to subduction zones.  In other words, the
nature of volcanic features we see occurring in subduction zones compared
to that which we see occurring within MORs are petrographic worlds apart.
How does EE explain these discrepencies, if, as you claim, there was
movement of material to the surface from the deep mantle occurring at
subduction zones?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 1) N/A for EE. And not even true for PT! The oceanic crust close to the

So what?  The spreading centers of the Pacific, unlike the ones for the
Atlantic, are not symmetrical (i.e., they don't run straight down the
middle of the Pacific basin).  Because they are offset towards the
Americas, there is no reason to presume that the oldest exposed crust would
be close to the subduction zones along the margins of the Americas.  In
fact, because the spreading centers are offset towards the Americas, we
would expect to find rather young crust being subducted along the margins
of those continents, and that, in fact, is what we see.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) Large eartquakes due to the stress of the crust push by the incoming
&gt; matter.

When I say deep, I mean deeper than the crust.  The problem with your #2,
above, is that 'incoming matter' (I assume that by that you mean upwelling
matter from deep within the mantle) is going to be hot and viscous (i.e.,
very plastic) and so one does not see large earthquakes at depth in this
material.  And in fact, we don't see such great earthquakes along any of
the spreading centers where such upwelling is, in fact, occurring.  We do,
however, see great quakes, often of deep focus, at the subduction zones.
And we see them there because descending crust is cold and dense, and much
more brittle than at the spreading centers.

Umm, what assumption?  GPS data is conclusive that there is no expansion
occurring.  This complicates EE in so many ways that this fact alone should
cause all EEers to toss the theory in file 13 where it belongs.

If you look at the distribution of spreading centers, and their rates, you
would note that not all spreading centers are the same.  Some spreading
centers, such as those in the Arctic, have very low rates of spreading.
Others, such as the East Pacific Rise, have among the highest spreading
rates on the planet.  It is no coincidence that the most active subduction
zones on the planet are opposite the fastest spreading centers, whereas the
least active convergent boundaries are opposite the slowest spreading
centers.

&gt;oceanic spreading centers.  Those centers display invariably the same kinds
&gt;of faults, which are primarily normal faults in conjunction with conjugate
&gt;transforms.  Subduction zones invariably are associated with megathrust
&gt;faulting.  If you had upwelling from deep within the earth occurring at the
&gt;locations of the subduction zones, you would see the same seismic and
&gt;petrologic features that you see at the spreading centers. We don't see
&gt;that at all.

&gt;Not only does the seismic data not support your claim, the petrologic data
&gt;refutes it as well.  Fresh mantle material, and/or their derivitives are
&gt;found everywhere along the MORs.  You do not see any fresh mantle material
&gt;or their derivitives in any of the subduction zones.  The volcanics within
&gt;subduction zones are unique to subduction zones.  In other words, the
&gt;nature of volcanic features we see occurring in subduction zones compared
&gt;to that which we see occurring within MORs are petrographic worlds apart.
&gt;How does EE explain these discrepencies, if, as you claim, there was
&gt;movement of material to the surface from the deep mantle occurring at
&gt;subduction zones?

&gt;&gt; 1) N/A for EE. And not even true for PT! The oceanic crust close to the
&gt;&gt; putative subduction zone of west americas is not even the oldest one.

&gt;So what?  The spreading centers of the Pacific, unlike the ones for the
&gt;Atlantic, are not symmetrical (i.e., they don't run straight down the
&gt;middle of the Pacific basin).  Because they are offset towards the
&gt;Americas, there is no reason to presume that the oldest exposed crust would
&gt;be close to the subduction zones along the margins of the Americas.  In
&gt;fact, because the spreading centers are offset towards the Americas, we
&gt;would expect to find rather young crust being subducted along the margins
&gt;of those continents, and that, in fact, is what we see.

&gt;&gt; 2) Large eartquakes due to the stress of the crust push by the incoming
&gt;&gt; matter.

&gt;When I say deep, I mean deeper than the crust.  The problem with your #2,
&gt;above, is that 'incoming matter' (I assume that by that you mean upwelling
&gt;matter from deep within the mantle) is going to be hot and viscous (i.e.,
&gt;very plastic) and so one does not see large earthquakes at depth in this
&gt;material.  And in fact, we don't see such great earthquakes along any of
&gt;the spreading centers where such upwelling is, in fact, occurring.  We do,
&gt;however, see great quakes, often of deep focus, at the subduction zones.
&gt;And we see them there because descending crust is cold and dense, and much
&gt;more brittle than at the spreading centers.

&gt;&gt; 3) result in violent, often cataclysmic volcanism;

&gt;&gt; 4) be the focal points of nearly all known deep focus earthquakes.

&gt;&gt; See. The only difference is that you first assume the earth radius is
&gt;&gt; constant in case of PT so that you need to compensate accretion.

&gt;Umm, what assumption?  GPS data is conclusive that there is no expansion
&gt;occurring.  This complicates EE in so many ways that this fact alone should
&gt;cause all EEers to toss the theory in file 13 where it belongs.

&gt;&gt; Did somebody try to build a computer simulation of PT to check if it is
&gt;&gt; possible to make oceanic crust disappear as fast as it appears at the
&gt;&gt; rifts?

&gt;If you look at the distribution of spreading centers, and their rates, you
&gt;would note that not all spreading centers are the same.  Some spreading
&gt;centers, such as those in the Arctic, have very low rates of spreading.
&gt;Others, such as the East Pacific Rise, have among the highest spreading
&gt;rates on the planet.  It is no coincidence that the most active subduction
&gt;zones on the planet are opposite the fastest spreading centers, whereas the
&gt;least active convergent boundaries are opposite the slowest spreading
&gt;centers.

The closest idea that I can come up with that might have any bearing

However, at local scales, the constant is so weak the gravitational
mass of even Findlay's brain is sufficient to over power it.

M&amp;M got a measurment that was smaller than what they expected. So they
prove that the ether is moving with the earth rather than it is
immobile.

Not really. In "Relativity: The Special and General Theory. (Henry Holt,
New York, 1920)". Einstein said:

"...[A]ccording to the general theory of relativity, the law of the
constancy of the velocity of light in vacuo, which constitutes one of
the two fundamental assumptions in the special theory of relativity
[...] cannot claim any unlimited validity. A curvature of rays of light
can only take place when the velocity of propagation of light varies
with position"

We need ether to explain the change of the speed of light in vacuo.
Call it "ether", call it "dark matter", call it "quantum vacuo", but it
has to be there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

OK. I did not want to go into details but let's go for it:

matter is just a circulation of ether that is self-sustained (that's ok
for a superfluid like ether).
This ether in movement is condensed in the flux (think high pressure).
In counterpart there is a depression around the circulation. Therefore
there is a influx of ether going toward matter in order to compensate
the depression created by the matter. This is the gravitationnal
force-field.

Any concentration of matter will generate a influx of ether toward
itself. This is the case for planet, stars... anything that contains
matter.
But, when the flux of ether converges in the matter body, and when the
influx is at high speed, turbulences of ether are created. Those
turbulences can reorganized in self-sustained circulation, i. e, matter!
And more flux of ether are necessary to fill the ether depression!

This is how the gravitational force field creates matter at the core of
hudge bodies.

Note that all force-fields are just the same thing: a flux of ether.
For example, since particles are circulation system of ether they are
composed of flux. When two circulation of ether, i. e., particle of
matter,  come close,  either their flux is convergent  and they stick
together or their flux are divergent and they repulse each other.

There is no revolutionary idea since all the current physic theories
have their place in the theory of a fluidic ether.
