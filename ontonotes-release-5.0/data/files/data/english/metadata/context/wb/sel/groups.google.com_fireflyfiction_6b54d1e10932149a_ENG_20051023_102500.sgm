&quot;We all here?&quot; Wash kissed the top of Zoe's head as he let Book take her weight
from him and turned to scan the crowd of people swarming over the cargo bay.
&quot;Are we all on board?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Jayne answered, the last person up the ramp, the limp body in his arms
hanging loosely. &quot;Get us off this damned rock.&quot;

Inara pounded the button that closed the doors and sealed the airlocks. Wash
ran up to the bridge with a last look to his wife. Simon, already folding up
the sleeves of his shirt, left the stretcher where it lay and turned to gesture
Jayne to the infirmary.

&quot;Bring her in, Jayne.&quot; He noted with a small amount of relief that the large
man had had the presence of mind to pick her up face down without flipping her
over. &quot;On her stomach.&quot;

Together, they lay her down on the gurney and Simon reached for the sedatives
that would hold her under. His eyes picked up the gentle way Jayne's oversized
hands smoothed the edges of her skin, tried to comfort the soft arms that
didn't respond. Simon placed a mask over her face to help her breathe and
attached the requisite monitoring devices before looking at the red, gaping
holes across her back.

&quot;Jayne?&quot; He looked up. &quot;I need you and Book to get Mal up on the side gurney
and dope him, too. Zoe's going to have to wait.&quot;

&quot;She gonna be okay, doc?&quot;

Simon looked up to the windows that surrounded the infirmary and saw them all
watching. He hadn't felt like this since his first days as an intern, the
supervision, the monitoring. The horrified, intense stares of those who cared
about the dying patient on his table.

&quot;I don't know.&quot; He swallowed hard and looked down. &quot;Just... just do as I say.&quot;

&quot;Doctor Tam?&quot; Simon looked to see a pale, blonde haired boy hovering by the
door. &quot;I can help. Bethany and I can help.&quot;

It's not like he had much choice. Simon nodded.

***

*It stings, drugs burning like volcanoes in her skin, rivulets of fire that
pump and throb and pump again. She can't stop it. Can't halt it. Can't give
them what they want. Not ever. Never. Wouldn't do to hand it over like a shiny
bauble.*

*They've left her in a room, alone, discarded like trash. Thrown away. Stored
until needed. Until there's a question to be asked, even if there aren't any
answers. River had answers once, she thinks she did. Knows she did, because
they still look for them.*

*She cries for the blood that was once on her knees, belonged to a man who held
her hand, who gave her peace in her head. Peace they stripped away. Each death
hers. River has seen them kill and almost wants it for herself.*

*Kill me! Words shouted at faceless men, masks that hide nothing. They're so
angry they don't care. Didn't care when they made her watch as Charles went
down. He screamed his last. He still screams in her head. So does Aida. So do
they all. Kill me and leave them alone!*

*Men in the room. Talking, so many words that say so little. Big ideas and
fallacies of leadership. The needles in her eyes. What did you see, River? What
was in their heads, River? Bark once for yes and twice for no, River. One
needle, two needle, three needle, four. Tell us what they won't.*

*Jonah, she sobs, she can't create any other sounds as she falls onto the bed,
Jonah.*

*Jonah's gone, River. The small voice hits her from the side and she gasps.
He's been gone for months now.*

*She can't do anything but whimper.*

*You'll be okay, River, I promise. A small hand enters hers, softly and with
care, as another hand runs over her back, smoothing the sharp edges and turning
her whimpers into small mewls and then nothing. That's what you told me and
that's what I'm telling you. You just need a few days, like last time, that's
all.*

***

River couldn't look away, she sat on the back of the couch, her boots long
gone, and stared through the infirmary windows. Her glazed eyes watched Simon
without seeing, saw him head bent and hands bloody as he gently lifted the
little metal tweezers from somewhere too close to a spinal cord to be anywhere
near comforting and dropped the little bullet fragments into the dish that
Bethany held.

There were a lot of things floating through the ship right then, most of them
dull and aching, heavy fears and silent prayers. The sharp tang of terror had
burned off with the haze of fire through atmo. They were drifting through
space, literally and figuratively.

Jayne echoed off the walls, edgy and nervous, ricocheting from one room into
the other. She felt him drawn to the space by the cargo hold entry, the little
window to watch eagle eyed like he had once before, drawn there and then
repelled by the twin bodies lying on their stomachs and looking through the
glass. Twins in general made him anxious, twins with possible psychic powers
made him turn around and head into another room altogether.

Minmei and Binh weren't about to move anytime soon. Daniel sat to the left of
River, also watching the proceedings. Bethany and Sebastian handed tools to
Simon when he needed them, sponging away blood and debris, reaching over and
doing some small thing a second before Simon asked them to. Inara stood to the
side, unasked and unquestioned, monitoring Mal, holding his hand in a fever of
worry.

Wash streamed into the room and she looked up at him.

&quot;Everyone's keeping vigil now.&quot;

He nodded sadly at her then joined Zoe and Book on the other sofa. The three of
them made a conglomeration of worry and concern, pain and exhaustion. Fear,
impatience and a touch of anger. Book patched up Zoe as best he could and River
didn't want to feel it, didn't want to hear the words and terminology that ran
through his head, the words of a training that led to other things.

Other things that made Jonah tense beside her to the right. Jonah, whose jaw
was already clenched tight, because he couldn't feel her either. They'd tried
and they could reach everyone else in the room except the girl on the
table.

River leaned forward and looped her hands over the head of the woman sitting on
the couch in front of her legs. Kaylee leaned back and looked up, her hands
coming up to grasp River's. Their eyes met for an instant and then River rested
her chin on the top of Kaylee's head as she continued to look at the small form
on the operating table.

&quot;You'll be okay, Alex.&quot; River whispered. &quot;I promise.&quot;

***

&quot;I never said thank you.&quot; Kaylee looked at Jonah. &quot;For being there before.&quot;

&quot;They shouldn't have done what they did.&quot; He turned to look at her. &quot;I'm not
going to say I'm sorry they brought you there, because I'm not. We're all out
here now, but they shouldn't have hurt you like that.&quot;

It was palpable, hanging thick in the air. Even Kaylee could feel it, she felt
it in the slight shift of River behind her, the jolt of surprise that the girl
gave. She could see it in the clenching of Jonah's jaw. When she looked around
the room, she saw the twins, Bethany and Sebastian looking at Daniel. Daniel
looked straight at Jonah.

The two of them stared at each other for a long moment, not moving. It did not
escape her notice that Daniel reached out to take her hand, without looking
away. It was Jonah who broke eye contact first.

&quot;We'll talk about it later.&quot; Jonah looked up again. &quot;Not now, okay?&quot;

&quot;Fine by me.&quot; Daniel said, a little more coldly than strictly necessary. &quot;I'm
not going anywhere.&quot;

&quot;C'mon!&quot; Kaylee said, loud and forcefully bright, as she stood up and pulled
Daniel with her. &quot;Let's go find some clothes. I don't know about you guys, but
I'm awful sick of these gowns.&quot;

Daniel allowed her to tug him to his feet, but pulled his hand out of Kaylee's
and stood with his arms crossed.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Agreed Wash across the room, also standing up. &quot;And I should check the
bridge again. Make sure there's no one following us. Or space trash to bump
into. Or...&quot;

&quot;Honey?&quot; Zoe looked up, opening one eye from the sleep she had appeared to have
fallen into. &quot;Just go. I'll be fine.&quot;

&quot;Jayne?&quot; Book called. &quot;Would you like to help me in the kitchen?&quot;

***

River closed her eyes and walked through the eddies of everyone. Her knees
lifted at the stairs and she pushed the balls of her feet down on the grills of
metal. So many voices and very few of them hers. She didn't want to follow
Kaylee to the crew quarters, because Kaylee had questions about what had just
happened, but if she stayed she'd have to sit between them.

And between them wasn't a place to be right now. Fire and boil and scars
running deep. People would be caught in the cross fire.

She pressed the door open with her feet and slid down the ladder silently,
landing softly on her toes. Kaylee stood with her back turned, staring at a
shelf of dried flowers, Chinese prints and other assorted oddities.

&quot;It's funny.&quot; Kaylee said to the room, without having turned around. &quot;I
collected all these so carefully, just to prove I'd been places. That I'd seen
worlds fancier than Serenity, that I could have belonged there.&quot;

River stepped forward, wrapped her arms around Kaylee's waist and rested her
cheek on her shoulder blades.

&quot;And you know what? Every second I was in that place, hell, every second I was
on that other planet...&quot; Kaylee gripped River's hands as she spoke. &quot;... all I
wanted was to be back here. I don't need no dances, or stupid pink dresses with
stupid pink ruffles, I didn't need...&quot;

She stopped and breathed in deeply. River smiled against her back.

&quot;I liked your stupid pink dress.&quot;

Kaylee let her breath out in a mix of laughter and a sob.

&quot;Thanks, I think.&quot; Something on the wall caught her eye. &quot;Hey, what's this? Is
this supposed to be a girl?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; River let Kaylee go and brought her face up to the paper taped to
Kaylee's wall, her face glowed with pride. &quot;It's me, I'm dancing.&quot;

Indeed, if Kaylee squinted and leant her head to the right a little, she could
see the line of arms... or maybe that was a leg... was that supposed to be
hair?

&quot;It's nice.&quot; She said. &quot;Did you...?&quot;

River straightened up and set her face.

&quot;Jayne drew it. It's pretty.&quot;

&quot;Jayne?&quot; Kaylee looked back at the picture with wide eyes. &quot;Jayne drew a
picture?&quot;

River nodded.

&quot;I can't believe you made him kiss me. You're evil.&quot; Kaylee smiled as River
tried to contain the small giggle that came out with a restrained sob. &quot;Okay,
clothes. I can fit out Minmei and Bethany, I think. But we're gonna have to
raid Mal and Simon's rooms for Binh, Daniel and Sebastian.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; River agreed sagely. &quot;Jayne and Wash are too big.&quot;

Kaylee paused, but let it go. River smiled sadly anyway and they shared a look.
River's face fell slightly when, as she knew they would, the energies shifted
again and she sighed.

&quot;What just happened between Daniel and Jonah?&quot;

***

&quot;Here, Simon.&quot; Book pressed a cup to his lips. &quot;It's just water, flavored with
a little honey.&quot;

He winced at the too sweet taste, but drank it anyway as he continued to sew
together the edges of Alex's spleen. It wasn't too far off the glucose mixture
given to the surgeons back in Capital City. Dehydration and energy were
important factors when trying to concentrate during a twelve hour operation. He
nodded in thanks.

&quot;Inara?&quot; Book turned around. &quot;Why don't you get yourself something to eat?
Jayne and I have prepared some food. And I think Kaylee might appreciate a
donation of spare clothes, she only has so many to spread out. Don't worry,
I'll let you know if there's any change.&quot;

Inara, who had been about to protest, blushed at the implication and merely
whispered her thanks before giving Mal's hand another squeeze, carefully edged
her way out of the infirmary and quickly through the common room.

Looking at the two children standing to the side, he saw their gowns marked
with blood, and the way they refused to look him in the eye. Book didn't blame
them, he hadn't heard their full names yet, but he wasn't sure he wanted that
small flare of recognition, the spark of memory that would come and the guilt
that followed.

Simon looked up from Alex and tried to breathe through the tension.

&quot;Go.&quot; Simon said kindly to Sebastian. &quot;You two need to get some food as well,
get a new change of clothes and then come back. I can manage without you for a
while.&quot;

When they were alone and Book took a pair of gloves and placed them on his
hands, stepping up next to him on the table, Simon spared a glance to the
common room through the window.

&quot;I don't know which is worse, you and those kids just then, or those two out
there now.&quot;

***

&quot;You sanctimonious son of a...!&quot; He stopped.

&quot;No, Daniel, please.&quot; Jonah prodded. &quot;Go on. Really.&quot;

&quot;How dare you?&quot; Daniel seethed. &quot;How can you sit there and let Kaylee fawn all
over you, thanking you for, what did she call it? 'Being there'? What did you
do? Nothing! It was us and you know it! We stopped Dr. Williams! We got her
away from them and kept her alive down in that basement. All you did was lie in
a bed for eighteen months.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Jonah blinked. &quot;Did my almost dying inconvenience you?&quot;

&quot;Don't bring that bullshit here, Jonah, don't you dare.&quot; Daniel couldn't
remember the last breath he took. &quot;How long were you awake, exactly? Long
enough to allow them to threaten Kaylee? Long enough to allow them to
electrocute Alex into a trembling pool of nothing? Was that it? Were you awake
long enough to allow them to bring Kaylee in the first place? Or was it
longer?&quot;

Jonah didn't answer.

&quot;How long, Jonah? Answer me! How long were you lying down there letting all of
us go through hell so that you didn't put yourself in any danger?&quot;

&quot;It's not that simple, you don't...&quot;

&quot;Don't even dare tell me it was the moment the goddess almighty River Tam
walked in.&quot; Nobody, not even Daniel in the midst of a rant could miss the angry
flare that surged into Jonah's eyes or the warning bells that went off inside
his head. &quot;You weren't there when they did this to her! God, Jonah, you were
alive and they made us watch everything they did, knowing we'd be next. Where
were you then? Where were you when she was begging us to just kill her and it
took all our energies to convince her to hold on that last little bit? Or when
Bethany screamed in pain for three days straight because of what they did after
River had gone? Where were you then?&quot;

Just outside the kitchen, at the top of the stairs, Kaylee sat with her back to
the wall, listening to the voices that rang through the entire ship. In her
arms, River trembled. At the bottom of the stairs, the room had split. Jonah
was well aware that Bethany, Sebastian, Minmei and Binh stood behind Daniel.

&quot;Stand down, Daniel.&quot; Jonah's voice was deadly serious.

&quot;No.&quot; And he didn't. &quot;It doesn't work that way anymore. You've been gone too
long.&quot;

&quot;You don't have any idea do you?&quot; Jonah remained calm. &quot;None of you do. I
thought when you'd found the...&quot;

He paused.

&quot;None of you knew I was there, because I wasn't. I nearly died and they barely
kept me alive, kept me breathing, but not conscious. I have no idea why they
needed me back, but I have my suspicions, most of which revolve around all of
you being dead. Is that what you want to hear, Daniel?&quot;

By the look on his face, no, no it wasn't.

&quot;Yes, I woke up when I heard the twins thinking about River, when I heard them
bring Kaylee in. No, I didn't make myself known to you. I had to get out and I
had to get out then. I've never let you in my head, Daniel, any of you,&quot; at
this, Jonah pointed at the stairs, &quot;and if you want to know why, just look what
they did to River because of it.&quot;

Two feet appeared, slowly, one at a time, followed closely by legs that turned
into River. Kaylee was not far behind. If Daniel had needed a release, it was
obvious that Jonah did, too, because he was nowhere near slowing down.

&quot;You saw what they were doing down there, Daniel. The very second they solved
their little equation, we were all dead. Without them they needed us. I kept us
alive by destroying their files. River kept you alive by not telling them. The
fact that neither of us could tell them, kept you alive.&quot;

He paused to let this sink in. River walked to the middle of the room and stood
to the side of them, in the charged space between them, her eyes flicked back
and forth between the two. She didn't say anything, she just stood there as
Minmei and Binh walked to stand behind her.

&quot;If you or they knew I was awake, you'd be dead. If they got their hands on
River again, you'd be dead. If the both of us were gone, they'd need you alive.
Does that suit you better?&quot;

Daniel had lost a little of his bravado by this point. Bethany and Sebastian
had moved to stand behind River as well.

&quot;Was it hell for you after I was gone? Yes. Was it horribly, unforgivably cruel
what they did to River? Yes. Was it unfair that you were burdened with
everything after the two of us were gone? Yes. You know what, Daniel? None of
it was fair, from the very start. We all got the very shortest end of a very
short stick, not one of us made it out of there unscathed.&quot;

Jonah's voice became sharp and controlled.

&quot;But as I see it, you're not dead, you're not lying in that room bleeding to
death, nor are you so mentally scarred that you can't string a sentence
together. You've come out of it a lot better than some. So grow up and get over
it!&quot;

River watched Daniel's fist come out of nowhere in slow motion, they all felt
it connect solidly with Jonah's chin, felt the reverberation of Jonah's spine
hitting the sofa he fell back onto.

&quot;Now,&quot; asked Jonah as he rubbed his face, &quot;does that feel better?&quot;

&quot;Little bit.&quot; Daniel admitted. &quot;I'm still right, though.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Jonah agreed with a grin. &quot;And so am I.&quot;

&quot;Men.&quot; Kaylee sighed in disbelief as Sebastian reached a hand out to help Jonah
up.

Stuck in her place on the far sofa, Zoe had to silently agree.

***

He looked down at the plate on the table in front of him, the hairs on the back
of his neck were beginning to prickle and he hated that feeling. Granted, it
wasn't the best meal ever cooked up, but they'd had a lot worse. He counted to
ten very slowly, then he just couldn't take it.

&quot;It ain't just for show.&quot; Jayne snarled. &quot;Either get some and eat it or leave a
man in peace.&quot;

Two of the kids inched into the kitchen and eyed the room carefully. He
pretended to focus on his food and watched them out of the corner of his eye as
they huddled together at the other end of the table, reaching out to scoop the
food onto their plates.

&quot;So, uh...&quot; He looked up and wasn't sure whether he wanted to meet their eyes.
&quot;How's the little sproggit doin'?&quot;

&quot;Getting there.&quot; The girl answered him. &quot;Simon's very good.&quot;

He allowed himself a half hearted grunt in reply, even though he did agree with
her. They were lucky to have a medic on board, any medic, let alone someone who
could patch them all up like the doc could.

The boy was watching him quizzically.

&quot;What?&quot; He blurted out. &quot;Whatcha starin' for now?&quot;

&quot;You do realize that you can't really lie around us, don't you?&quot; Sebastian
asked genially. &quot;We know you appreciate Simon, you admire his work.&quot;

&quot;Don't do that.&quot; Jayne pointed at them with his fork. &quot;Don't you be messin'
around my head, y'hear? It ain't no place for kids. Y'all are worse than River,
you know it? At least she keeps most of it to herself.&quot;

&quot;You can't scare us away.&quot; Bethany assured him. &quot;We already like you, it's too
late.&quot;

&quot;Great.&quot; Jayne went back to his food. &quot;I'm just thrilled to hear it. Let me
eat.&quot;

He still felt eyes on him.

&quot;What now, boy?&quot;

&quot;Can I...?&quot; Sebastian faltered for a second.

&quot;Spit it out.&quot; Jayne muttered.

&quot;He wants to see your guns.&quot; Bethany explained with an entirely smug look on
her face. &quot;And then play with the big boy weights.&quot;

***

Wash looked at the screen and felt nervous. There was no ship following them
and he couldn't understand why. Surely there'd be a passel of Alliance ships
tailing them by now, they'd made themselves well and truly known.

He heard the footsteps and knew who it was. It should have surprised him that
he could identify everyone by the way they stepped into the bridge, but it
didn't. Briefly, he considered ducking and hiding under the chair.

&quot;Thought I'd find you here.&quot;

&quot;Kinda hoped you wouldn't.&quot; He admitted. &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;What'd they do to my girl?&quot; Kaylee broke in and her eyes flickered over the
console. &quot;She sounds different.&quot;

&quot;Something.&quot; He shrugged. &quot;You'd have to ask Jonah, it boosted us up real nice,
though.&quot;

Their eyes met and he looked away first.

&quot;Kaylee? I...&quot;

&quot;Don't, Wash.&quot; She sat in the copilot's chair and tapped at the paneling until
a hatch opened and she could peer into a mess of wires. &quot;I'm just glad you're
alright.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; He nearly fell out of the chair. &quot;What? I'm fine, it's you that...&quot;

Something in the way her chin wobbled, in the stubborn way she set her face and
refused to look at him again made him stop and think. He went over the last few
days in his head, the guilt when he'd first remembered how they'd taken her,
the relief when River and Jonah had come back and told them that she was okay.

&quot;You didn't know, how could you?&quot; It was soft, his realization. &quot;What did the
doctor tell you?&quot;

&quot;That, uh... that you were...&quot; She sniffed and fiddled with wires that didn't
really need it. &quot;Nothing. He didn't tell me anything. It's good that they got
you out when they did.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; He said it firmly. &quot;It's good that we got you out when we did.&quot;

She seemed to relax a little.

&quot;You guys coulda come earlier if you'd really wanted.&quot; She tried to smile as
she sat back in the chair. &quot;I wouldn't have minded.&quot;

And that, Wash surmised, fulfilled just about the entire quota of serious and
emotional talk the both of them could handle in one sitting. He gestured back
out of the bridge.

&quot;How's Alex?&quot;

&quot;Simon's still working on her.&quot; She shrugged. &quot;River's a little more relaxed
now, so I guess it's not so urgent anymore. It's what I figure, anyway. I don't
know about Mal.&quot;

He rolled his hand in a gesture for her to carry on.

&quot;Zoe's gonna be fine and you know it.&quot; She said. &quot;Sheppard patched her up real
good, she's still pretty woozy, but she's happy waitin' for Simon.&quot;

&quot;I know about my wife.&quot; Wash explained gently. &quot;I meant you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, me.&quot; Kaylee gave a small smile. &quot;I'm a little shook up, bruised some and
my leg aches somethin' fierce, but they didn't do nothing that won't mend
itself. I better go see to my ship, she's straining a little.&quot;

Wash didn't say anything, he didn't need to. He felt it in the way she'd placed
her hand on his shoulder when she'd stood up to leave and given him a little
squeeze. Only Kaylee, he figured, could accept an apology he hadn't given when
she didn't even feel it needed to be given in the first place.

***

The next time Simon looked up, Book had gone and he found himself looking at
Jonah and Daniel. It was almost a relief to have them in there with him. He
looked at Jonah.

&quot;You can really do it?&quot; He waited for Jonah's nod. &quot;Then pay attention.&quot;

He looked down at Alex's body and thought about what needed to be done. When
Jonah stepped up and took the weaver out of his hand, Simon allowed himself a
breath before changing his gloves and gesturing Daniel over to help him with
Mal.

***

Inara looked across the gangway and smiled. Even without her years of training,
it was fairly obvious what was happening here. She couldn't help but delight in
it, she'd never had it and, in her line of work, rarely ever saw it.

&quot;He's really quite handsome.&quot;

Bethany jumped and turned around, a flush already spreading over her face.
Below them, in the cargo bay, Jayne was spotting Sebastian at the weight bench.
She made a face at Inara.

&quot;You're very quiet, I usually know when people are there.&quot; It was a guilty
smile. &quot;I didn't hear you.&quot;

&quot;I'm not surprised.&quot; Inara's eyes flickered down and up again. &quot;He seems to
like you as well.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Bethany smiled down at the same moment that Sebastian smiled up. &quot;He
does.&quot;

A sudden sharpness stabbed at Inara, gone as instantly as it came and left her
confused. A mixture of longing and envy that she didn't want to explore, didn't
want to understand why the stark openness and surety of the two made her a
little bit empty.

&quot;When you're part of a dozen or so that can read minds,&quot; Bethany explained
quietly, &quot;it becomes irrelevant to play games and deny what you feel.&quot;

&quot;That's...&quot; wiser than I'll ever be in a thousand lifetimes, Inara thought,
&quot;... a very positive way of looking at it.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Bethany teased, &quot;I don't think it'll take you a full thousand.&quot;

Inara ducked her head, her lips still smiled, but her eyes sharpened just a
little.

&quot;What,&quot; Bethany continued regardless, &quot;with all the people you see in your...&quot;

&quot;I really wish you wouldn't do that.&quot; Inara looked up again and met Bethany's
eyes head on. &quot;If you have questions, you're welcome to ask me, but please
don't take from me what I'm not willing to give.&quot;

&quot;I... I...&quot; She blushed and looked away.

&quot;You're human,&quot; Inara interrupted. &quot;you're, what? Fourteen, fifteen? You're
nervous, even if you can read every little thing in his head. It's only natural
to be curious.&quot;

&quot;Fourteen.&quot; Bethany thought for a moment. &quot;It doesn't feel like it, sometimes.
Time played tricks back there. It seemed...&quot;

She stopped speaking and bit her lip.

&quot;I'm fourteen.&quot;

Bethany didn't look up at Inara, didn't want to look into her eyes. She could
already feel the wave of pity and concern and she didn't want to be drawn into
something more, not when Inara had expressly asked her not to. It was second
nature to them all now and she hadn't stopped to wonder what others would feel
about it.

&quot;Well, Miss Fourteen,&quot; Inara coaxed Bethany back into comfortableness, &quot;if you
do have questions, my shuttle is always open.&quot;

***

Their steps were almost choreographed, River could see it in the way they moved
together. She sat crouched into fabric of the sofa, thighs pressed up against
her chest and chin on her knees, and stared through the window of the
infirmary.

As she watched, Simon held out his hand and Daniel placed a small, sharp pair
of scissors in them. Neither of them looked up or made any other sign. Simon's
trust given without question, letting Daniel inside his head.

It was like a curse, sometimes, floating on the waves of other people, their
comfort and ease. She could see what was and what could be, but she also knew
what wasn't and what never would.

Jonah looked up, like she did, knowing and accepting, like she was. She watched
him lift his right hand and beckon her to join him and her skin itched to do
it, to just give in to him. He knew, just as well as she did, that she couldn't
ignore the other people in the room, that she couldn't press down the ache that
they bought forth.

*River?*

She shook her head.

*I want you in here.*

*It's not your operating room, Jonah, not really your choice.*

Her feet drifted through the air and hit the floor softly as she pushed herself
up. If she concentrated hard enough, she could float past the space in front of
her and search through the multitude of people on board. The one she wanted was
already in the engine room.

It was an eternity of waiting. The ache in his chest had returned and made it
hard for him to breathe. The stunner had hit him hard and he was still trying
to recover, not that he could complain, not really, considering the
alternatives.

He was almost grateful when they finally came. Almost. Book had hidden himself
in his berth mostly to avoid causing any unnecessary grief to any of the
children, but also to escape his own memories. He didn't want any of them
knowing his thoughts, knowing the truth of it.

The knock was soft on his door.

Not that he could stop them if they wanted to find out for themselves.

&quot;Come in.&quot;

&quot;Teng.&quot;

They spoke in unison and didn't waste any time. Book couldn't help the flood of
memories, the instant connect to faces and past assignments, the quick cold
motions he'd gone through at the time. He let it roll through his mind like an
offering.

&quot;They think we're dead?&quot; Minmei asked softly.

&quot;Yes.&quot; There was no point lying or cushioning the impact. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;

&quot;Some people will never be redeemed for the choices they make.&quot; Binh said as
they turned to go, his eyes met Book's. &quot;And others will spend eternity trying
to atone for the choices they didn't.&quot;

&quot;And where do I fit in?&quot; He couldn't help but ask it.

&quot;You were only following orders.&quot; Minmei said. &quot;We don't blame you.&quot;

When he was alone, her words offered no comfort. History, well back to Earth
that Was, was already full of men that were only following orders.

&quot;Are you trying to be stealthy?&quot; Kaylee asked as she looked into her engine.
&quot;'cause I could hear you coming a mile off. And you're usually on top of me
before I even notice you're there.&quot;

She stopped and thought about her words with a small smile on her face, not
that there was much she could do about taking them back.

&quot;Still can be.&quot; River teased her with an exaggerated sigh. &quot;If I really must.&quot;

&quot;Well, you know, if it's such a chore...&quot; She wiped her hands on her coveralls,
her sweet, sweet comfortable coveralls, and sat up from beneath the hulking
machine, &quot;... you don't have...&quot;

Kaylee was cut off by the swooping of cloth and a small body pressing down on
her, all limbs and small, hot hands. She couldn't help the breathy little half
gasp, half laugh as River pressed their foreheads together and forced Kaylee
back to the ground.

&quot;Not a chore.&quot;

&quot;So I see.&quot; Kaylee closed her eyes as lips, soft and warm and quick, landed
lightly on the end of her nose, both her cheeks, her brow. &quot;Minx.&quot;

When she felt the next downward stroke of a face, Kaylee thrust her chin up and
captured River in a kiss. Her hands came up and cradled the small head. There
was nothing to do but gasp when River hooked her legs around Kaylee's and
rolled them suddenly.

She found herself looking down at deep brown eyes that were beginning to
dilate.

&quot;Prefer you on top, though.&quot;

That Kaylee could oblige.

&quot;So I see.&quot; She kissed her again, long and hard and just a little bit
desperate.

They lay there for a second, breathing against each other, skin pressed against
skin. Then there was a breath, an inhalation, and the moment was gone. She
couldn't have said what it was, a shiver, the way that River trembled
underneath her or something deeper. Something that eddied and flickered behind
the girl's eyes.

Kaylee rolled onto her back and looked up into the engine.

&quot;You're still worried. I thought the danger had passed.&quot;

River closed her eyes and soared through the ship.

&quot;Done all he can, one man in an army of hurt. Time is the key, watch to time
and time to watch.&quot; She opened her eyes and looked at Kaylee's worried face.
&quot;We have to wait and see.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Kaylee couldn't quite grasp it. &quot;You, all of you, you're so calm now.
I thought...&quot;

&quot;Suppress the panic, worry accomplishes nothing.&quot; There was something almost
robotic about her voice that made Kaylee shiver in her spine. &quot;Focus is key.
Complete objectives.&quot;

&quot;River?&quot;

&quot;Complete the objective, Kaylee.&quot; Shakiness hit River's words, a rapid beat
that Kaylee didn't want to recognize. &quot;Objective is to fly away, fly away home,
nobody has a home. But we have to keep going. Get away, far, far along the
way.&quot;

Kaylee reached out and pulled River to her, ran her fingers through River's
hair.

&quot;We're going, we're going.&quot; She whispered. &quot;River? We're going as fast as we
can. That's why I'm here, to make sure the engine keeps us going.&quot;

The edginess calmed and there was quiet as Kaylee closed her eyes and let small
sounds pass through her lips, soft cooing that made River limp and pliable.

&quot;She's not broken?&quot; River sounded so small coiled up into her shoulder.

&quot;Serenity?&quot; Kaylee smoothed the hair away from River's face and planted a soft
kiss on her forehead. &quot;Nah, 'course not.&quot;

Letting herself fall away from Kaylee, River felt the steel of the floor on her
shoulder blades and thought again about melting into the ship, disappearing and
losing all feeling. She wondered if there was such a thing as too much green.

&quot;Jonah really did some work on her, though, didn't he?&quot; Kaylee eyed the coiling
wrapped around the core heater. &quot;She's straining right now, we've gotta land
sometime soon so I can put her to rights.&quot;

River let a shuddered breath rip through her and lifted a hand to run
fingertips over cool metal, it was worn and heavily scratched, maybe even
beginning to show a little rust at the edges, but strong and well cared for.

&quot;Boosted the ship, brought us to you.&quot; She sighed and wondered what would
really be said if Kaylee ever followed the thousand different meanings in their
words. &quot;A stitch in time.&quot;

&quot;Can't argue with that.&quot;

Kaylee reached out her hand without looking and a wrench landed softly in her
palm. She didn't see the glow of River's eyes as she wrapped her fingers around
it, or the way the girl's face crinkled to stop the mewl in her throat.

&quot;Thanks, baobei.&quot;

***

&quot;How're you feeling, sweetie?&quot;

Zoe blinked her eyes open to see Wash sitting on the floor next to the sofa.
She could feel his hand sweeping through her hair and let herself drift into
the motion for a second.

&quot;I'm okay.&quot; She managed a small smile for his benefit. &quot;Feel like I was shot,
but I'm okay. The Captain?&quot;
