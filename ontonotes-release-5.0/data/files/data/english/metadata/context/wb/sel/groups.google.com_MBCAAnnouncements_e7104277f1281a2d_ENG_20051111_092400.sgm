MB Do-It-Yourself Mechanics -

Mercedes Benz Club of America invites you to

Our next Do-It-Yourself Tech Session will take place on Oct 12th at
Nine-Eleven Enterprises Inc
Address: 2120 Cindy Ln, Dallas, TX 75229
Phone: (972) 241-2002
8 am to noon. Click on the
Google map link below. You can get directions and location
information.
Please bring your own parts and tools. They'll have their parts
department
open to sell parts, but please call them in advance to make sure
they'll
have what you need. In the meantime, check out their great
website at  http://www.nine-eleven.com/  to see their capabilities.

Cost is $10 with advance reservations, or $15 at the door without
advance
reservations. To get your name on the reservation list, please call
Hyatt
Cheek, Jr. at 214-327-6890, leave a message if you get his answering
machine.

Lifts will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis, so be sure
to
show up as early as you can, the line usually starts forming around
6:30 am
or so. Depending on the size of the crowd, we reserve the right to
limit
the amount of time that you have on the lift. Remember, the event will
end
promptly at 12:00 noon. Not 12:01. Or 12:30. This means you need to
be
FINISHED with your work at about 11:45 am, and be cleaned up and out
the
door by noon. Don't even think about starting work that you can't
finish by
11:45 am. If you're not finished by noon, you'll need to just leave
your
car there, find a ride home, and let Nine-Eleven finish your work
during their
normal business hours, and you'll be responsible for paying them for
that
work. Nine-Eleven sponsors this event at no cost to the club, and they
donate
their Saturday morning to help us out, so don't be rude by taking
advantage
of their generosity. You've been warned - so be an adult, keep an eye
on
the clock, and don't whine.

Hope to see you there.
