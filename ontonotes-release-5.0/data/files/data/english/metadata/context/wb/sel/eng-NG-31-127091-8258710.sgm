At least I got to see this on a ramp leading to one of those trailers
housing portable bathrooms which the Erie County (NY) Fair got to set up
this year.

The restrooms are attended, very clean, and one is invited to tip the
attendant. I think I left $2 or so during the course of all my visits on
account of the fluids I was forcing on such a hot day.

ObCF: One wonders how little those with children left as a tip.

&quot;Please
no
strollers&quot;

You don't expect a breeder to follow that, do you.

If it had simply said &quot;NO STROLLERS&quot;, then you'd have
had some chance. However, it said &quot;Please&quot;, which means
it's a polite request rather than an instruction. And
as it's only a polite request, not an instruction, then
I can take my stroller up there. I mean, just one stroller
isn't going to inconvenience anyone is it?

Hmmmm, the route to the loos should be quite long and narrow,
such that one stroller can get in, leaving enough room for
a person to get past in the opposite direction, or to overtake,
but not wide enough such that two strollers can get past each
other. So one rule-breaker would be just an average breedersome
annoyance, but would two to meet each other one would have to
reverse the whole fucking way because of the other one!
Muahahahahha!

When I walked up there to pee, I noticed that it would be difficult to
fit one of those bicycle-wheel type jogging strollers the SUV generation
buys.

I had another thought. The width of the path would have been designed
for wheelchairs and scooters (think ADA). Stroller access is a(n
unfortunate) side effect of the accessibility design.

A pet-happy friend of mine has a bumper sticker on her husband's truck-
&quot;My dog is smarter than your honor student.&quot; Oddly enough, their
daughter *is* an honor student, but they don't see fit to plaster *that*
on the truck.

I have one of those on my car. I also have one that says &quot;Did you eat
a bowl of stupid for breakfast?&quot; And I have the one from Cheryl Greer
that says &quot;Childfree. Biology isn't destiny.&quot;

I have yet to get any dirty looks or snide comments from breeders.
Yet a few months ago my BIL borrowed my car and some lady was
giving him the dirtiest looks. BIL just couldn't figure out
what her problem was. Then he saw the stickers on my back
windshield.

Funny how he gets a dirty look and I can't get a rise out of
anyone. &gt;:(

I don't get any flack from my &quot;biology isn't destiny&quot; sticker -- also one of
Cheryl's -- but Mr. Rabbit does, mostly because he goes to the hardware
store more often than I do, and always parks my stickered vehicle in the
breeder spot.

What a great sticker!  I was behind a breeder-mobile just the other
day with the stupid honor roll sticker.  Do they honestly think anyone
give's a rat's ass about their dumb kid (I know, stupid question,

I like the sticker &quot;My kid sells term papers to your honor student.&quot;
My favorite, which I haven't been able to replace since I sold my old
truck, is &quot;And God said: {the four Maxwell electromagnetic-field
equations} and there was light!&quot;  Irritates the hell out of fundies who
aren't too ignorant to recognize the equations, because God *must* have
said that, in some form, for light to be what it is, but it's nowhere in
their Big Book of Retranslated Fairy Tales.
