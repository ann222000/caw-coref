Writing to see if anyone can point me in the direction of any research
or applications that you are aware of that incorporate safety
practices and measurement systems in a hospital/healthcare
environment.

A colleague at UNT, has been a key player in a TX hospital
establsihing/maintaining a scorecard system that represents (safety)
measures on the organizational level. She is now focusing on
presenting a practical and effective scorecard system to the Chief
Quality Officer that focuses more on a Unit level and then on an
individual performer level (so feedback can play a part in individual
performance change).

We are looking to find some references to similar work, or any other
applications in hospital/healthcare systems to get an idea of &quot;what's
out there,&quot; to use as a possible benchmark, to gather ideas from,
etc.

When I was an undergrad at WMU (1998-2002) I remember (grad?) students
were working on projects/applications at one of the Kzoo
hospitals...did any of that work get published?

Thanks!  Any advice or suggestions is much appreciated!

John Austin and I have a paper coming out in the December issue of JABA
which I believe is part of the work you are referring to. We implemented a
package intervention to improve safe handling of sharps among surgical team
members during surgical procedures.

More currently, Scott Geller and I have a couple of papers under review with
medical journals that are aimed at improving patient safety with OBM. Not
sure if you are more interested in patient or employee safety, but I would
be happy to share those papers with you as well (or anyone else who is
interested). They also include several references to safety applications in
healthcare settings.

I believe John, Tim Ludwig, and Joe Sasson would also be excellent people to
check with on this topic.

Three more:

Shannon Loewy - just graduating from WMU with her master's - did work at a
leading hospital to evaluate the implementation of a computerized
prescription system on med errors ( Shannon Loewy
&lt;shannon.m.lo ... @wmich.edu&gt;)

Don Nielsen (don nielsen &lt;dkniel ... @hotmail.com&gt;) - graduated from WMU last
year with PhD; his dissertation was on improving patient transfers among
nurses by having them score videos of others doing the lift; an applied
version of Alicia Alvero's work on the observer effect (Alvero &amp; Austin)

Joe Sasson &lt;jsas ... @medaxiom.com&gt; and Doug LaFleur both graduated from WMU
several years ago with PhDs and now work with MedAxiom, a consultancy to
medical practices.

Good luck,
John Austin

One more in a hospital setting: Sara Stephens and Tim Ludwig, JOBM 25(2)
Improving anesthesia nurse compliance with universal precautions using group goals
and feedback.

The history of performance scorecards goes back, in our culture, at least to:

Bourdon, 1977, JOBM (vol 1 issue 1) in an industrial setting, Molar Data
Sets.
Abernathy's Sin of wages and the more recent book Managing without
supervising (ref. on Behavior.Org site for the Cambridge Center) where scorecards are
used as the linchpin of incentive systems,
Daniels and Daniels (2004) book (I think)

and most recently, to my knowledge (and in print),

bsp;
See Eikenhout and Austin JOBM vol 24(3) 2004/2005 -- this one provides a good
demonstration of the process involved in putting a scorecard in place within
an OBM intervention in a retail setting and includes a very nice/excellent
data set. It's only my opinion, but I think a search for ideas about how to go at
something like what you describe shouldn't be restricted to hospital settings
... some elements of interventions generalize across organizational types and
yet others can be adapted from one setting to another.

The prototypical score-card appeared in a paper by Kaplan, R., &amp; Norton, D.
The balanced score-card - measures that drive performance, Harvard Business
Review. back in 1992.

Best regards,

Tom

Thanks to everyone who has shared information and sources!

Here's some more info for anyone/everyone who is interested and has
more info to help us!  :)

...We are very confident that our knowledge/use of balanced scorecards
will be appropriate for the setting...however, there are more
specifics that would help us in our transition from org measures to
individual performer measures.  For example, how can the data is
collected for INDIVIDUAL performers in a large enviornment vs. data
from multiple performers being lumped together and displayed as an
organizational &quot;measure&quot;.  I know in BBS peer observations are often
preferred...does that apply for hospital settings as well?

Currently the &quot;measures&quot; (data) are presented at an organizational
level and there is NOT a feedback system in place that provides ANY
individuals with feedback. Since observations are currently kept
anonymous there is no systematic approach in place to feedback the
individual performers/staff with feedback....so, there is a circular
rut that the org is falling in....observe performers/staff, report
measures, measures get lumped in an org total &quot;measure,&quot; and managers
encourage everyone to &quot;do better&quot; next month.  But how?  Staff do not
ever get told how they are doing, if they were observed, and if their
performance is included in the months org total.....

The tricky part to this scenario is that not only do we need to focus
on making changes in the measurement system, but need to help creat a
culture shift that utlizes feedback in the hospital sytsem as a whole,
not merely concentrating on one department...

Stacey,

I work for a Health Insurance organization that has partnered with a small company by the name of MedMined. It is a data mining software company that is designed to read the Lab data of a hospital for infection patterns. This software triggers a report that is sent to the ICPs at the hospital for further investigation and intervention where needed.

When discussing safety, I am not certain this really applies to what you are looking for in your request. I mention this to you because the reports provided to the hospital include &quot;actions&quot; that could be taken to eliminate and prevent future outbreaks. This is basically the safety measures that have been mentioned in previous responses so far.

We have learned so much about the behaviors of all who come into contact with a patient from housekeeping to the families themselves. By implementing change, starting with the way the ICP handles the data, we saw a significant increase in &quot;safe&quot; behaviors along with a decrease in infection. There was no longer an audible groan from nursing or housekeeping when the ICP (delivering feedback) approached. They became eager to hear what their numbers were and offer additional suggestions for continued improvement.

I am not sure this will be helpful to you but wanted to share with you a business application of what we have done in this area. If you would like more information, just let me know. I would be happy to discuss it with you further.

Wendi
