LOL its soooooooooo simple, Even a dumb ass like you should be able to
see it!

The dems may get into power for a term or two but will fuck things up
so bad, like they always do. People will be looking for another
Republican or maybe finally a third party candidate to fix the mess
they made.

Wouldn't this happen to about any party that comes into power for a
term or two. People also get bored them not just because of mistakes.
The idea of swithing parties occaisionally is better thn revolution
and the guillotine, when the leaders get out of line.

No scams needed.

In case you haven't it out Republicans are going to let Americans choose

Either way Republicans win.

Why we need prescedent? Is all history done just to repeat? I think not.

Nixon used a think tank to determine whether it might work to cancel the
presidential election. It isn't all about Nixon. They all do such studies.
It's on their mind.

Let us NOT IMPEACH BUSH/CHENY. Wait until they are out of office and try
them for treason.

Are you saying that you actually think anyone in the current
administration is actively planning to declare martial law?  If so
what events or actions on their part leads you to come to such a
conclusion?

It seems to me this is a somewhat &quot;chicken little&quot; argument.  While
that may be a common political ploy, it is still rather silly.

With regards to your second statement.  Is your premise for treason a
political argument in that you disagreed with their actions while in
office or do you really think that someone in the current
administration attempted to harm the US.  You may argue that their
actions were harmful (although other would disagree), but do you
really think that was their intent.

I think many attempts to criminalize politics a step towards
totalitarianism.  Certainly if someone breaks the law while in office
their should be a price to be paid.  But what we see today is attempts
by groups to criminalize the behavior of others for political
reasons.  Politics should be argued based upon the merits of the ideas
in question, not used to destroy ones opposition.

I'm not sure I understand your take on history.  Nazism and fascism
did not break down.  They were defeated by force of arms.  Rather the
&quot;democratic&quot; systems (and I use that term loosely here) that proceeded
them broke down and lead to Nazism and fascism.  This should be a
warning to us.  In a democracy those who would gain power by any means
tend to destroy the democracy.  As a conservative I must accept that
liberals are entitled to their point of view and should be granted a
chance to prove the worthiness of their ideas at the ballot box.
However, when one group of people try to remove that opportunity for
all ideas to be considered at the ballot box then democracy itself
suffers.  The current trend to try to criminalize politics is just
such an attempt.

At least that is my opinion.
