I thought it would be interesting to start a thread about unusual things that
happen at antique auctions. This occured at a farm auction about twenty years
ago. If you can't stand a very sad story don't read any further.
My family liked to spend weekends going to auctions in the nearby countryside
and small towns. You rarely found the finest of antiques, but we picked up some
good old quality wood funiture and the occasional boxed lot was still being
sold, which often contained a surprise, either good or bad.

One sunday, we were at a farm auction. The owner was an elderly gentleman whose
wife had died recently, and being in poor health himself, had decided to sell
off the farm and move across country to be closer to family. It was your
ordinary auction until close to the end. Up until then, farmer had been pretty
much in the background, chatting with neighbors but not envolved in any way. He
called his lassie-type dog over, and walked to the front of the auction, were
the auctioneers were, and announced to the crowd that he would not be able to
take his dog to his new home, and so was auctioning it off. He said she was a
real good dog, obedient and friendly. He then picked up his dog, and, holding
up in the air, began to silently cry. The auctioneer called for bids while the
elderly farmer held up the dog, tears rolling down his cheeks. The crowd stood
stunned and quiet, until one man finally bid $5, and got the dog. It was the
saddest thing we had ever seen at an auction. Any others with a story?

a retirement home. Since those places want everything you've got,
everything must be sold. The 90+ year old woman sat stoically with some
family members in the front row with all the reserve of Queen Victoria.

This couple had amazing items. He had worked at the White House for
decades and they had Presidential items back to Lincoln. Wonderful
china, fantastic furniture, nothing at this sale, not even the everyday
stuff, sold for under $100 and most items were well in excess. I don't
remember precisely what item was on sale when the following happened
but, the auctioneer announced;

&quot;This item was a wedding gift from Miss Mary's
Grandmother. I have an opening bid from
Miss Mary for $5.00.&quot;

No one moved, no one made a sound, and the item was knocked down. Her
family whooped and cheered and Miss Mary sat with a small smile the
entire rest of the day.

described - all the accumulation of 80 years of living as well as some
really beautiful stuff. My only consolation was that I was able to buy
and restored a fine old tall clock movement.

We travelled to Lander, Wyoming for an estate auction; the
estate was that of Paul Petzoldt's widow (Paul Petzoldt being
the famed mountain climber who scaled Grand Teton every
year on New Year's Day - and the family was very very wealthy
in their own right.)

The auction proceeded for hours and hours; at the very end,
Mrs Petzoldt (well into her dotage) and her sister arrived.

They looked around, and Mrs Petzoldt said &quot;These people
have my things.&quot; She immediately began bidding on
strange things (dotage indeed) such as the old blankets and
detrius left at the end of an auction.

home in a gated golf community and they can't wait to lose all the excess baggage and
at the same time acquire extra pocket cash. I'm Getting too close to retirement to
think all my stuff will be out on the lawn someday and if it happens I don't want to
be a witness.

I go to sales almost every weekend and I can't recall a single happy story. Hope
it's because they just didn't stick around to watch and are already doing their
thing. All I ever see is a bunch of relatives fighting over the same item, which
winds up bringing some riducliously high price, which then makes all the newbee
antique dealers think that item is worth it so they bid just as high for it at the
next sale they attend.

All in all it's a lot of fun and I love being able to tell people my house is
furnished &quot;early estate.&quot;

I sympathize with your dislike of the detritus, but still say DON'T throw
anything out that isn't rotting. I HATE sales where a dumpster has been
parked outside the house and all the misc. hardware, dresser/desk drawer
/kitchen cabinet miscellanea have been thrown out, and all that's left is
furniture and a few framed things on the walls. I don't trust the
well-intentioned folks running the sale to know the difference between a
highly desirable typewriter ribbon tin or light bulb or drawer pull and a
piece of utter junk. I don't trust MYSELF to know whether someone else
might desperately need, say, a particular pot lid with no bottom. I
suppose even a Tampax box from 1955 has a hole to fill in somebody's
collection. No smirks out there, you know who you are! :-)

Years ago I went to an estate auction in June where the house had been
closed up since Christmas. Eerie to see the decorations still up
(although there was no tree, thank goodness). It must have been a party
loving family, since there were large groups of cocktail paraphenalia
from every period of glass manufacturing - Victorian through 60's. In
addition, every piece of case furniture carried out provided a sound
effect -&quot;roll, roll, roll Thump!&quot; from empty liquor bottles.

An estate auction was held at a farm that had been in the same family for many
generations. The event was well publicized and
drew a lot of buyers, some with very deep pockets. A set of sleigh bells came up,
and the bidding was between a well dressed
man and an old farmer. The farmer really wanted those bells. I watched his face,
and as he dropped out at $700, it was
obvious that his heart was broken. I'm sure that he had some emotional connection
to those bells, but never did find out for
sure. I hope that I never want something so bad that I'll step on true human
emotions to get it.

On the other hand, I don't think that auctions such as those described in this
thread are totally sad. Ultimately, the items sold
will end up with someone who appreciates them, instead of being in boxes somewhere,
neglected by uncaring heirs.

Here's a fun story to help balance the sad...last summer an auction was held
for a couple who were retiring and returning to their homeland of Ireland
(where they had a nice stone farmhouse/lots of land waiting). They had
collected silver. All day long silver was sold - $500 here, $800 there -
about two a minute, I would say. Plus she had many, many other items. It
was the only auction I've ever attended where three phone lines were going
with bids coming in from all over the world. It was quite exciting. Well,
after I closed my mouth in awe from all of this I went down behind the house
to the &quot;cheap&quot; tent and found some fabulous treasures that went for under
$5. I knew the woman who was selling all of this and she was having a grand
time. She told me all about a the sculpture I had gotten for $2 (something
I would never, ever part with) - where she had gotten it, what it had meant
to her, etc. It was a wonderful day - for the rich who could afford the
silver and for me who stayed with my &quot;under $5&quot; budget!

&lt;An estate auction was held at a farm that had been in the same family for many
generations&gt;
This happened just last year....
My grandparents belongings were being auctioned off at the farm after my
grandmother died (grandpa had passed on ten years earlier).
I was interested in a little Fly Rod Mouse that was still in the box.
It reminded me of the days when Grandpa &amp; I would go to his pond &amp; I would fish
with a cane pole &amp; he would put on his waders &amp; cast with a fly rod.
This lure was real cute only about 2&quot; long, little beady eyes, furry ears,
tail, (you get the picture).
I started bidding on it from the start &amp; after it hit $65.00, most people
dropped out. One guy kept bidding. I just kept bidding until he finally quit. I
paid $145.00. After that, the guy came up to me &amp; said &quot;I had no idea that lure
was worth so much! Are you a dealer or something?&quot; I looked him square in the
eyes &amp; said &quot;No, I'm his grandson.&quot;
He walked away without saying another word.

I find it sad that you had to bid on your own grandfather's fishing pole.
Couldn't it have just been given to you?

When I was eight my wonderful grandfather died and the farm and many, many
wonderful pieces were sold. My mother, the only child, did not have room
for any of it. It was a hard day for all of us.

My grandfather, who also loved to fish, died when I was eight and the farm
and most everything there was sold. My mother, an only child, didn't have
room to take anything more than one lovely Victorian marble top dresser. It
was a sad day for all of us.

Janeen,
My mother and Aunts distributed the bulk of the estate amongst the family. I
was given many things belonging to them. On the day of the auction I felt
compelled to purchase the lure. As with some large families estates are not
always settled easily. It is a sad tale that too many family members want the
same things. It would have been nice to have a &quot;family &quot; auction the day before
which allowed family members to bid on the things that meant the most to
them....alas...not so. To me the lure was as priceless as the small gold leaf
tree that sat upon the organ that she used to play to us all. I purchased that
too. Memories............
Regards.....
Brad

The truly sad thing about Estate auctions is the way proceeds are distributed.
The lawyer gets a cut...The executor gets a cut....The auctioneer gets a
cut...and Uncle Sam gets more than all of the above.
It seems to me that it would be more fair to identify all the belongings with a
number ...put the numbers in a hat and have the remaining family members draw
them at will. That way all the blood, sweat and tears that went into the years
of accumulating the family worth would remain just that.......&quot;family worth&quot;.
Each one has a piece..a memory.......
A sad auction story..........

following the death of both parents about a year and a half apart.
Everyone took their turns at the hat and then traded if they felt like
it.

Of course, all of his sisters made my father feel guilty about getting
something that they really really really wanted so in the end, it all
comes down to relationships no matter what you do.

&gt;As with some large families estates are not
&gt;always settled easily. It is a sad tale that too many family members want the
&gt;same things. It would have been nice to have a &quot;family &quot; auction the day
before
&gt;which allowed family members to bid on the things that meant the most to

"/> them...

When my Mom died my brothers and sisters decided that I had the most experience
in pricing &quot;old things.&quot; So I was assigned the task of placing a monetary
value on everything. Then anyone who wanted something had that amount charged
to their &quot;account.&quot; In the end those who took things of least value got more
cash to even it out. The only thing I would not price was a Victorian Table
which had been given new as a weding present to my grandparents. I wanted it
and I didn't want anyone complaining later that I set the price. My brother
did that and since it was the only thing I wanted no one contested with me for
it. There were several things that more than one person wanted. The ulimate
owner was decided among the contenders. Sometimes a coin toss was used but
more often it was who had the greatest sentimental attachment. At the end of
the day everyone was satisfied.

Several years ago I went to a &quot;moving to town&quot; farm auction. The poor
little old lady, wearing a bonnet no less, sat in a rocker, tears streaming
down her face.... I really felt terrible even being there, little less
buying her possessions...that is until I realized they were tears of joy
when she told the lady sitting beside her how she couldn't believe how much
her stuff was bringing.

The auctioneer called for bids while the

&gt;elderly farmer held up the dog, tears rolling down his cheeks. The crowd
stood
&gt;stunned and quiet, until one man finally bid $5, and got the dog. It was
the
&gt;saddest thing we had ever seen at an auction. Any others with a story?

"/> In our family , when my mom died, all eight children met at her house on a
sunday evening about 2 months after her death.
I acted as autioneer, and each object went to the one who wanted it.
If there were two or more interested, we put numbers in a hat and the winner
got the item. No money changed hands and all of her memories (and ours) stayed
in the family. Most of her clothes and any leftover items were given to
charity.

May the road rise to meet you,
May the wind be always at your back,
and may you be in heaven 30 minutes before the devil knows you are dead!
(:)____/ AH! It feels good to lie down when you are old.

I haven't had to go through this yet as I wasn't interested in antiques when
my grandparents died but it seems to me the best way to divide up things
that everyone wants is either to go through the things before the parents
pass away or to pick numbers and that sets the order in which you would be
able to pick out which item you want. If you pick something and the next
person picks something that you wanted that would be too bad. You could also
trade as the person earlier said. I have a feeling when my parents do pass,
hopfully in about 50 years, our house will be packed with all of the things
I couldn't part with. Just my two cents.
