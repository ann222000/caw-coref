I am looking for a brass tail wheel to shift the CG of my PIK-20B back.

I have seen the web sites of DG and AMS and they mention this type of
wheel but cite no source.

Is there a source for such a wheel in Canada or the USA?

If not, where can I get one?

They cite no source since the source is themselves. I have no idea if
a brass tail wheel from a DG would fit a pik. I had a brass tailwheel
from a DG-80x machined (hub narrowed slightly) to fit my DG-303. It
was easier to buy the DG-80x part from Pacific Aero. Did a great job
moving the CG for Acro, kind of academic post wing spar TN
restrictions.

Our club just bought one for its 505.  Lead is cheaper :-)

Some of the guys in my club had the tail wheel filled with a urethane
compound (the same stuff they use in tractor tires). It added a lot of
weight, but was still squishy enough to provide some cushioning ---
and no more flat tires or need to check the pressure.

They went to Miller Tire in Dublin, Pa. - you may have to find a place
local ... or ship.

Tractor tires often have liquid weight added.  The old medium was calcium.
It is very corrosive.  A newer substance, just a little more money and much
less corrosive, is beet juice.  Just put some in my tractor tire.

Be aware that air filled tyres will flatten progressively
all the way to the wheel rim during heavy impacts and
consequently reduce the acceleration forces transmitted
to the structure.

Denser foam/liquid fills will deform at a slower rate
and/or deflect over a smaller distance thus producing
much higher dynamic loads.

Uh, say what? With the same rubber tire around the brass tail wheel as
around the standard plastic one you won't feel any difference beyond
the CG change.

I suggest that before using a tail wheel which might increase the impact
loads in the tail, be sure to do the second part of the lower rudder
hinge A/D, if you haven't already.
