A trampoline basically consists of a frame, a pad, a mat and springs. The trampoline pad is essential to the safety of the jumpers. Trampoline pads vary in sizes and shapes to go with the size and shape of the frame. That's all well and good when you buy your trampoline pad with the frame as a new trampoline, but what if you need to get a replacement pad? Always check with your trampoline's manufacturer to get the same pad that came with your original trampoline.

What do you look for in a trampoline pad? A good pad should be of the highest quality. You definitely don't want to skimp on the pad, as that is what will protect the jumpers from the springs and the edge of the frame. It should be made of a high density closed cell foam, to be water and mildew resistant. That will help it last longer outdoors, and it will not lose its shape with time and wear. Be sure to check the thickness and weight of the pad to make sure it covers your springs.

Your trampoline mat is even more critical than the pad. This is the part that supports the jumper. It should be strong and sturdy, with a burst strength of at least 800 pounds per square inch. Trampoline mats are typically sewn with eight rows of heavy-duty UV resistant thread and galvanized triangular v-rings for strength and durability.

The springs are the main part that gives your trampoline its bounce. It is important to check the length of the spring, because the longer the spring, the higher the bounce. Trampoline springs are measured from hook to hook. They should be checked regularly, as loose, overstretched or damaged springs need immediate replacement in order to avoid major injuries to jumpers.

When you're looking at buying a trampoline, especially a used one, you need to inspect the pad, mat and springs very carefully to make sure they are not too worn or at all damaged. Even when buying a new trampoline, these critical parts need to be inspected thoroughly. Test the trampoline if you can, and if you can't, make sure it has been tested by the company selling it. Check the warranty, as any good trampoline will come with a good warranty that will cover any damages from the manufacturing process.

A trampoline is a great exercise tool. It can help you lift your spirits and mood by giving you a great workout. Trampoline jumping can be a great family activity as well. If you want an individual workout, get a mini trampoline that you can jump on indoors. Most importantly, keep your trampoline in good repair and follow all safety guidelines.
