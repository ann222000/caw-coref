Your PDF has a flaw in the very first sentence.  Under the Geneva
Conventions, there is no such thing as an &quot;unlawful combatant&quot;.  That
is simply because ALL COMBATANTS are covered under the law and this is
-also- what SCOTUS ruled last year in Hamdi.

The way to win the so-called war on terror is to be true to our best
principles, not piss them away.

Alberto Gonzales wrote the opinion that stripped socalled &quot;unlawful
combatants&quot; of the rights under our system.

The way the Bush people have worked in a number of spheres is to do
something they know the  law doesn't support and just depend on the
length of time they know it will take to get through the courts to
allow them time to accomplish their ends.

That is, they know it is not right or lawful and they just do it any
way.

The Geneva Convention defines lawful combatants and other protected
persons, so an unlawful combatant is a non-civilian who is officially
not (or only weakly) protected by the Convention.

(liberal nonsense deleted)

Geneva's pretty specific as to who qualifies as a POW: (being in uniform or wearing a symbol-armband, etc., commander responsible for subordinates, openly carrying weapons, and abiding by the laws and customs of war.) AQ sure doesn't seem to meet those guidelines.
It was designed for wars between states, or civil wars, not war between states and non-state
actors (e.g. terrorist groups). Give 'em what SCOTUS says (Common Article 3), and then
use a tribunal or Court-Martial under UCMJ if SCOTUS says no to the tribunal route. Just
make sure that all necessary security measures are ruthlessly implemented to assure that
classified evidence (COMINT/SIGNINT transcripts, covert operatives, confidential informants,
etc.) is protected. Given the two new justices, Tribunals have a decent shot at being upheld.

">

“Absence is not a definition” try brining into a US Court as evidence an
item found 3 doors down from the place mentioned on the Search Warrant.
The absence of the address from the warrant has defined the second
place as not being covered.

There are major and almost certainly deliberate gaps in the definition
of Protect Persons in Article 3.  In my opinion the insurgents in Iraq
fall into the gap and fail to meet the definition of a Protected Person.

“Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War”
as published by the UN
&lt; http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm &gt;

See below for text of Articles 1, 2, 3 and 4 which supply definitions.
Articles 129 and 130 (text below) define “Grave breaches” = war crimes.

Comments on Article 2,
i)Al Qaeda is not a High Contracting Party; although Iraq, Afghanistan,
USA and UK are.

ii)The territories of Iraq and Afghanistan are under occupation.

Comments on Article 3
i)“1. Persons taking no active part in the hostilities,” the insurgent
are taking an active part in the hostilities so they excluded from the
protection of Article 3 and any article using its definition.

ii)People in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp have been placed hors de
combat by detention.

iii)“2. The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. “  The
lack of medicines in Iraq hospitals may not be in compliance with this line.

Comments on Article 4.
i)Defines “Prisoner of War”.

ii)“A. 1.” The insurgents are not part of the armed forces of Iraq or
Afghanistan.

iii)“A. 2. (a) That of being commanded by a person responsible for his
subordinates; “ the insurgents may have a commander but I doubt that he
is taking responsibility (accepting blame and punishment) for the
actions of his subordinates.

iv)“A. 2. (b) That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a
distance; “ there are stories of insurgents in Afghanistan wearing
coloured clothing so those people may be entitled to POW status.  I
suspect that the car bombers do not wear “signs”.

v)“A. 2. (c) That of carrying arms openly; “  car bombers and snipers
hidden in civilian areas are not carrying weapons openly.

vi)“A. 2. (d) That of conducting their operations in accordance with the
laws and customs of war. “  Car bombers and other insurgents murdering
civilians appear to fail this requirement.  Local civilians are '
Persons taking no active part in the hostilities,' so they are protected
by Article 3.1.   Article 3. 1.  (a) explicitly bans their murder.
Article 130 makes the murders a war crime.

vii)Sections “A. 3, 4 and 5” and do not appear to cover the insurgents.

viii)Section “A. 6. Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory,” as the
territory has been occupied this section no longer applies.

ix)Section “B.” does not appear to apply to the insurgents.

x)Section “C.” does not appear to apply to the insurgents.  The recent
car bombers in Britain may be in breach of this and related sections.

xi)My conclusion is that the insurgents do not meet the standard
required for the granting of Prisoner of War status.

“Article 1
The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect
for the present Convention in all circumstances.
Article 2
In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peace time,
the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of
any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High
Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one
of them.
The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total
occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the
said occupation meets with no armed resistance.
Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present
Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it
in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the
Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and
applies the provisions thereof.
Article 3
In the case of armed conflict not of an international character
occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each
party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the
following provisions:
1. Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members
of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de
combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all
circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction
founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any
other similar criteria.
To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any
time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned
persons:
(a) Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds,
mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;
(b) Taking of hostages;
(c) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and
degrading treatment;
(d) The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without
previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording
all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by
civilized peoples.
2. The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.
An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of
the Red Cross, may offer its services to the Parties to the conflict.
The Parties to the conflict should further endeavour to bring into
force, by means of special agreements, all or part of the other
provisions of the present Convention.
The application of the preceding provisions shall not affect the legal
status of the Parties to the conflict.
Article 4
A. Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are persons
belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the
power of the enemy:
1. Members of the armed forces of a Party to the conflict as well as
members of militias or volunteer corps forming part of such armed forces.
2. Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps,
including those of organized resistance movements, belonging to a Party
to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if
this territory is occupied, provided that such militias or volunteer
corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfil the
following conditions:
(a) That of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
(b) That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;
(c) That of carrying arms openly;
(d) That of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and
customs of war.
3. Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a
government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.
4. Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members
thereof, such as civilian members of military aircraft crews, war
correspondents, supply contractors, members of labour units or of
services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that
they have received authorization from the armed forces which they
accompany, who shall provide them for that purpose with an identity card
similar to the annexed model.
5. Members of crews, including masters, pilots and apprentices, of the
merchant marine and the crews of civil aircraft of the Parties to the
conflict, who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any
other provisions of international law.
6. Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the
enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without
having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided
they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.
B. The following shall likewise be treated as prisoners of war under the
present Convention:
1. Persons belonging, or having belonged, to the armed forces of the
occupied country, if the occupying Power considers it necessary by
reason of such allegiance to intern them, even though it has originally
liberated them while hostilities were going on outside the territory it
occupies, in particular where such persons have made an unsuccessful
attempt to rejoin the armed forces to which they belong and which are
engaged in combat, or where they fail to comply with a summons made to
them with a view to internment.
2. The persons belonging to one of the categories enumerated in the
present Article, who have been received by neutral or non-belligerent
Powers on their territory

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Geneva Conventions, there is no such thing as an &quot;unlawful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; combatant&quot;.  That is simply because ALL COMBATANTS are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; covered under the law and this is -also- what SCOTUS ruled

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Geneva Convention defines lawful combatants and other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protected persons, so an unlawful combatant is a non-civilian
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  who is officially not (or only weakly) protected by the

the constitution has an affirmative requirement

violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,
supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place

nonsense

That is why it is called Common article 3

Article 3 common to the four Conventions

Article 3 common to the four Conventions applies to all armed conflicts
of a non-international character and occurring in the territory of one
of the Powers parties to the Convention. In such a case, persons taking
no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who
have laid down their arms and those who are hors de combat for any other
reason will in all circumstances be treated humanely without any adverse
distinction.[I, 3; II, 3; III, 3; IV, 3]

The common article 3, of which it has justly been said that it is, in
itself, a small Convention within a larger one, states what constitutes
a minimum of humane treatment. The following acts, committed against the
persons mentioned above, are and must remain prohibited at all times and
in all places:

a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds,
mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;

b) taking of hostages;

c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and
degrading treatment;

d) the passing of sentences and carrying out of executions without
previous judgement pronounced by a regularly  constituted court,
affording all the judicial guarantees which are
recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.

everyone is protected by common article 3
They may or may not be POWS but everyone is protected by common article 3

&gt; “Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War” as
&gt; published by the UN &lt; http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm &gt;

&gt; See below for text of Articles 1, 2, 3 and 4 which supply
&gt; definitions. Articles 129 and 130 (text below) define “Grave
&gt; breaches” = war crimes.

&gt; Comments on Article 2, i)Al Qaeda is not a High Contracting Party;
&gt; although Iraq, Afghanistan, USA and UK are.

&gt; ii)The territories of Iraq and Afghanistan are under occupation.

&gt; Comments on Article 3 i)“1. Persons taking no active part in the
&gt; hostilities,” the insurgent are taking an active part in the
&gt; hostilities so they excluded from the protection of Article 3 and any
&gt;  article using its definition.

&gt; ii)People in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp have been placed hors
&gt; de combat by detention.

&gt; iii)“2. The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for. “  The
&gt;  lack of medicines in Iraq hospitals may not be in compliance with
&gt; this line.

&gt; Comments on Article 4. i)Defines “Prisoner of War”.

&gt; ii)“A. 1.” The insurgents are not part of the armed forces of Iraq or
&gt;  Afghanistan.

&gt; iii)“A. 2. (a) That of being commanded by a person responsible for
&gt; his subordinates; “ the insurgents may have a commander but I doubt
&gt; that he is taking responsibility (accepting blame and punishment) for
&gt;  the actions of his subordinates.

&gt; iv)“A. 2. (b) That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at
&gt;  a distance; “ there are stories of insurgents in Afghanistan wearing
&gt;  coloured clothing so those people may be entitled to POW status.  I
&gt; suspect that the car bombers do not wear “signs”.

&gt; v)“A. 2. (c) That of carrying arms openly; “  car bombers and snipers
&gt;  hidden in civilian areas are not carrying weapons openly.

&gt; vi)“A. 2. (d) That of conducting their operations in accordance with
&gt; the laws and customs of war. “  Car bombers and other insurgents
&gt; murdering civilians appear to fail this requirement.  Local civilians
&gt;  are ' Persons taking no active part in the hostilities,' so they are
&gt;  protected by Article 3.1.   Article 3. 1.  (a) explicitly bans their
&gt;  murder. Article 130 makes the murders a war crime.

&gt; vii)Sections “A. 3, 4 and 5” and do not appear to cover the
&gt; insurgents.

&gt; viii)Section “A. 6. Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory,” as the
&gt; territory has been occupied this section no longer applies.

&gt; ix)Section “B.” does not appear to apply to the insurgents.

&gt; x)Section “C.” does not appear to apply to the insurgents.  The
&gt; recent car bombers in Britain may be in breach of this and related
&gt; sections.

&gt; xi)My conclusion is that the insurgents do not meet the standard
&gt; required for the granting of Prisoner of War status.

&gt; “Article 1 The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to
&gt; ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.
&gt; Article 2 In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in

&gt;  is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to
&gt;  all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High

&gt;  to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall
&gt; remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore

&gt; latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof. Article 3 In the
&gt; case of armed conflict not of an international character occurring in
&gt;  the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties, each party to
&gt; the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum, the following
&gt; provisions: 1. Persons taking no active part in the hostilities,
&gt; including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and
&gt; those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any
&gt; other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without
&gt; any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith,
&gt; sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria. To this end the
&gt; following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any
&gt;  place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons: (a)
&gt; Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds,
&gt; mutilation, cruel treatment and torture; (b) Taking of hostages; (c)

&gt; sick shall be collected and cared for. An impartial humanitarian
&gt; body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, may offer
&gt;  its services to the Parties to the conflict. The Parties to the
&gt; conflict should further endeavour to bring into force, by means of
&gt; special agreements, all or part of the other provisions of the
&gt; present Convention. The application of the preceding provisions shall
&gt;  not affect the legal status of the Parties to the conflict. Article
&gt; 4 A. Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are
&gt; persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen
&gt;  into the power of the enemy: 1. Members of the armed forces of a
&gt; Party to the conflict as well as members of militias or volunteer
&gt; corps forming part of such armed forces. 2. Members of other militias

It is protocol 1 to the Geneva Convention that uses the term Combatant.
&lt; http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol1.htm &gt;

This appears to be the appropriate definition of Combatant and
eligibility for POW status.

“Part I

2. In cases not covered by this Protocol or by other international
agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and
authority of the principles of international law derived from
established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the
dictates of public conscience.

Article 37.-Prohibition of perfidy

1. It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to
perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to
believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection

Comment Suicide bombers frequently break Article 37 1. ( c ).

“Section II.-Combatant and prisoner-of-war status
Article 43.-Armed forces

1. The armed forces of a Party to a conflict consist of all organized
armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to
that Party for the conduct of its subordinates, even if that Party is
represented by a government or an authority not recognized by an adverse
Party. Such armed forces shall be subject to an internal disciplinary
system which, inter alia , shall enforce compliance with the rules of
international law applicable in armed conflict.

2. Members of the armed forces of a Party to a conflict (other than
medical personnel and chaplains covered by Article 33 of the Third
Convention) are combatants, that is to say, they have the right to
participate directly in hostilities.

3. Whenever a Party to a conflict incorporates a paramilitary or armed
law enforcement agency into its armed forces it shall so notify the
other Parties to the conflict.

Article 44.-Combatants and prisoners of war

1. Any combatant, as defined in Article 43, who falls into the power of
an adverse Party shall be a prisoner of war.

2. While all combatants are obliged to comply with the rules of
international law applicable in armed conflict, violations of these
rules shall not deprive a combatant of his right to be a combatant or,
if he falls into the power of an adverse Party, of his right to be a
prisoner of war, except as provided in paragraphs 3 and 4.

3. In order to promote the protection of the civilian population from
the effects of hostilities, combatants are obliged to distinguish
themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an
attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack. Recognizing,
however, that there are situations in armed conflicts where, owing to
the nature of the hostilities an armed combatant cannot so distinguish
himself, he shall retain his status as a combatant, provided that, in
such situations, he carries his arms openly:
( a ) During each military engagement, and
( b ) During such time as he is visible to the adversary while he is
engaged in a military deployment preceding the launching of an attack in
which he is to participate.
Acts which comply with the requirements of this paragraph shall not be
considered as perfidious within the meaning of Article 37, paragraph 1 (
c ).

4. A combatant who falls into the power of an adverse Party while
failing to meet the requirements set forth in the second sentence of
paragraph 3 shall forfeit his right to be a prisoner of war, but he
shall, nevertheless, be given protections equivalent in all respects to
those accorded to prisoners of war by the Third Convention and by this
Protocol. This protection includes protections equivalent to those
accorded to prisoners of war by the Third Convention in the case where
such a person is tried and punished for any offences he has committed.

5. Any combatant who falls into the power of an adverse Party while not
engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack
shall not forfeit his rights to be a combatant and a prisoner of war by
virtue of his prior activities.

6. This Article is without prejudice to the right of any person to be a
prisoner of war pursuant to Article 4 of the Third Convention.

7. This Article is not intended to change the generally accepted
practice of States with respect to the wearing of the uniform by
combatants assigned to the regular, uniformed armed units of a Party to
the conflict.

8. In addition to the categories of persons mentioned in Article 13 of
the First and Second Conventions, all members of the armed forces of a
Party to the conflict, as defined in Article 43 of this Protocol, shall
be entitled to protection under those Conventions if they are wounded or
sick or, in the case of the Second Convention, shipwrecked at sea or in
other waters.

Can't these people be treated as common criminals? A combatant
must be identifiable as a combatant under Geneva, or he's a
civilian. A civilian is subject to criminal law. Common Article
three does not remove a person's restrictions under civilian law
(or under the regulations an occupier may set in place of
civilian law). It does prohibit incarcerating or killing him out
of hand.

Of course they can.

The IRA were treated as such.

However that makes them eligible for civil trial by jury and has all the
protections that gives.

You know,  free choice of lawyers,  the chance to face your accuser,  the
prosecution actually needs some proof,  the right to a speedy trial,  all
that complicated human rights stuff that the people locked up at Guantanamo
Bay don't get.

What the current US government wants is the right to put people up before a
military court without these protections and prosecute them for criminal
offences.

I assume they won't put them up before an ordinary court because they'd walk
away without a stain on their character.  Probably because the prosecution
witnesses are so sleazy that any reasonable court would throw them out of
the building and there's no other evidence...

This not exactly correct.  A soldier acting as spy in civilian is a
combatant committing a war crime.  However unless she or he is captured
while in civilian clothes and gets back to his or her own lines the
crime &quot;disappears&quot;  i.e. he cannot be punished later even if captured

A civilian acting as a spy stays a spy even if they get back and can be
suitable punished if caught later

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; All prisoners and civilians may be protected but combatants are not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;combatants&quot; is not a meaningful category

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As you point out the correct term is &quot;persons taking no active part in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hostilities&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vince
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is protocol 1 to the Geneva Convention that uses the term Combatant.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt; http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/protocol1.htm &gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This appears to be the appropriate definition of Combatant and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eligibility for POW status.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “Part I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. In cases not covered by this Protocol or by other international
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; agreements, civilians and combatants remain under the protection and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; authority of the principles of international law derived from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; established custom, from the principles of humanity and from the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dictates of public conscience.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “
&gt;&gt;&gt; The phrase &quot;civilians and combatants&quot;  does not define either term

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Article 37.-Prohibition of perfidy

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. It is prohibited to kill, injure or capture an adversary by resort to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perfidy. Acts inviting the confidence of an adversary to lead him to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe that he is entitled to, or is obliged to accord, protection
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; under the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intent to betray that confidence, shall constitute perfidy. The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; following acts are examples of perfidy:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ( a ) The feigning of an intent to negotiate under a flag of truce or of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a surrender;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ( b ) The feigning of an incapacitation by wounds or sickness;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ( c ) The feigning of civilian, non-combatant status; and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ( d ) The feigning of protected status by the use of signs, emblems or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uniforms of the United Nations or of neutral or other States not Parties
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to the conflict.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; “

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Comment Suicide bombers frequently break Article 37 1. ( c ).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which may of course be a war crime

&gt;&gt;&gt; NO one suggests that war criminals may not be tried an punished

&gt;&gt;&gt; But once they are captured and taking no active part in hostilities
&gt;&gt;&gt; they get the protection of common article 3

&gt;&gt;&gt; they may not be POWs but they are still protected by common article 3

&gt;&gt; Can't these people be treated as common criminals? A combatant
&gt;&gt; must be identifiable as a combatant under Geneva, or he's a
&gt;&gt; civilian. A civilian is subject to criminal law.

&gt;This not exactly correct.  A soldier acting as spy in civilian is a
&gt;combatant committing a war crime.  However unless she or he is captured
&gt;while in civilian clothes and gets back to his or her own lines the
&gt;crime &quot;disappears&quot;  i.e. he cannot be punished later even if captured

&gt;A civilian acting as a spy stays a spy even if they get back and can be
&gt;suitable punished if caught later

This is the first mention of spying in this thread, I feel
confident in saying spies are not part of &quot;these people&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are major and almost certainly deliberate gaps in the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is why it is called Common article 3

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of a non-international character and occurring in the territory of one
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of the Powers parties to the Convention. In such a case, persons taking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have laid down their arms and those who are hors de combat for any

(Vince's bleeding heart nonsense snipped)

The problem is where they should be tried; if the bleeding hearts (ACLU, Amnesty
Crapnational, HRW, etc.) had their way, they'd be in Federal District Court with everything
that entails. However, a battlefield is not a secure crime scene. You're also dealing with a lot
of classified operations, both on the military side, and the intelligence side, and not only do
the people running those ops need to be protected (take whatever measures to conceal one's
ID in the courtroom, or testify by TV hookup from a secure location), but also, classified
evidence (COMINT, SIGINT, code-breaking, as well as other sources-say, a confidential
informant in the AQ organization-and methods) needs to be protected so that it accomplishes
two things: 1) Evidence that is not only classified, but is likely highly classified, is protected;
and 2) the defense is able to confront that evidence-use a military lawyer (with a security
clearance) in those portions of the tribunal or Court-Martial where that classified evidence is
being used. And it seems that when the topic of classified evidence is brought up, especially
how to protect it, liberals are silent on how to protect said information.

'Under 16 years of age' meets the 'child soldier' designation of the UN.

He's a victim not an offender.

He's pretty obviously also a soldier by any normal standards and entitled to
protection.

But what the kid needs is rehabilitation not prosecution...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course they can.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The IRA were treated as such.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However that makes them eligible for civil trial by jury and has all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; protections that gives.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You know,  free choice of lawyers,  the chance to face your accuser,  the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that complicated human rights stuff that the people locked up at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Guantanamo

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What the current US government wants is the right to put people up before
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; military court without these protections and prosecute them for criminal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; offences.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I assume they won't put them up before an ordinary court because they'd
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; walk
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; away without a stain on their character.  Probably because the prosecution
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; witnesses are so sleazy that any reasonable court would throw them out of

AFAIK in Canada and the US a serving military person can be treated as a
common criminal - they get handed over to the civil authorities, and stuff
happens from there. For misdemeanours and minor felonies I doubt that this
would happen...for major shit it often would. There is after all a reason
why Japanese legal systems get a crack at US Marines who do really nasty
shit. And I suspect that a Marine who axed 15 coeds in California while on
leave would get a CM in CamLej - he'd probably go to Cali.

14, 15 or 16, no, I wouldn't necessarily agree. That age is not that of a
&quot;child&quot;. It's that of a mid-range teenager, and back in the day we
recognized that people that age recognized responsibility and had some
maturity. 13 or younger, I would agree, I think. Certainly 12 or 11 and
younger - those are kids. But 15 and 16 year olds? No way. They're adults,
except we don't call them that.

ISTR Omar Khadr was 15 when he conducted his attack. He was no child.

He is in fact entitled to protection, IMHO. FWIW, I don't much like the
case - as far as I am concerned he is allowed to lob grenades at US
personnel (assuming that he was part of an identifiable military formation I
don't care if he was six years old), but the US seems not to like that. I
also really really don't like the fact that he got charged with murder - how
many US soldiers have gotten charged with murder because they kept on firing
after hands went up?..............

POWs can commit crimes, Peter. In which case they are liable to being
charged as criminals, and going to court. The issue at hand is (1) is he a
POW (well, yes, of a peculiar US-sort) and (2) did he commit a crime or
crimes? For the latter judgment you need a court.

&gt; recognized that people that age recognized responsibility and had some
&gt; maturity. 13 or younger, I would agree, I think. Certainly 12 or 11 and
&gt; younger - those are kids. But 15 and 16 year olds? No way. They're adults,
&gt; except we don't call them that.

&gt; ISTR Omar Khadr was 15 when he conducted his attack. He was no child.
">

AFAICT, the U.S. has acceded to the optional protocol concerning children in
war additional to the Convention on the Rights of Children (even thought the
are just a signatory to the CRC) although this was after the fact, in 2003. In
it, anyone under 18 YOA is a &quot;child&quot;. Given the incident happened before the
protocol was agreed to, I imagine it can not be used to argue against his
treatment as an adult, but could be used to argue against too severe a
punishment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He is in fact entitled to protection, IMHO. FWIW, I don't much like the
&gt; case - as far as I am concerned he is allowed to lob grenades at US
&gt; personnel (assuming that he was part of an identifiable military formation I
&gt; don't care if he was six years old), but the US seems not to like that. I
&gt; also really really don't like the fact that he got charged with murder - how
&gt; many US soldiers have gotten charged with murder because they kept on firing
&gt; after hands went up?..............
">

Khadr was in a compound identified as an aQ position and fought in its
defence. No one has brought up evidence of any perfidy on his part, just that
he flung the grenade (although he may well have lain doggo to get an
opportunity to do just that once he realized how badly wounded he was).

&gt; AFAIK in Canada and the US a serving military person can be treated as a
&gt; common criminal - they get handed over to the civil authorities, and stuff
&gt; happens from there. For misdemeanours and minor felonies I doubt that this
&gt; would happen...for major shit it often would. There is after all a reason
&gt; why Japanese legal systems get a crack at US Marines who do really nasty
&gt; shit. And I suspect that a Marine who axed 15 coeds in California while on
&gt; leave would get a CM in CamLej - he'd probably go to Cali.

Canadian courts martial cannot try anyone for murder, manslaughter or
abductions of persons under the age of 16 within Canada (it used to be
&quot;murder, treason or rape&quot;)
http://www.admfincs.forces.gc.ca/qr_o/vol2/ch102_e.asp#102.23 . Outside of
Canada, they can try such offences, and not just by members of the CF, but
also by anyone deemed to be accompanying the CF -- this was a bit of a shock
to the parliamentarians I took to South West Asia who thought themselves
covered by the privileges of the House of Commons. When the charge is laid by
a civil authority in Canada, the member is handed over for trial. In Germany,
the Netherlands, Belgium, the U.K. and the U.S., about the only places other
than SWA that Canada has folks stationed, civil offences by members are tried
by the local courts. CF members on exchange are also subject to the
disciplinary code of the force with which they serve.

People sentenced to two years or longer are sent to a penitentiary for the
first day of the third year (time in the CF's digger is considered hard labour
and counts more than day-for-day toward eligibility for parole).

CF member who axes co-eds in Canada will be handed over to province or
territory authorities for trial; overseas, he may be tried by civil authority.
In a place like the 'Stan where our confidence in the local justice system is
not bolstered by an SoFA, he gets tried by GCM and, if found guilty, goes to
the SPDB for two years, less a day, and thence to Bowesville for the balance
of his incarceration.

'A couple hundred years ago', the Royal Navy was a merit-based organisation-
albeit  a friend in high places could assist  in gaining _appointments_.
There were really only three ranks of officer grades; Lieutenants, Captains
with Admirals above them.  Lieutenants needed to pass an examination and
those successful would be styled 'Passed Lieutenants' and then appointed to
ships, for commission,  and hopefully gain a more advantageous appointment
following that commission.
Effectively they'd start as  (say) a Sixth Lieutenant on a big ship then
eventually a First Lieutenant on a small ship becoming a First Lieutenant on
a really big ship.  Seniority was based on the date of 'Passed Lieutenant'.
Eventually a Lieutenant would be become a Captain and so 'Posted'. With a
fair wind, ... and a bloody war ....the Most senior Post Captain would
become the most junior Admiral.

A prerequisite for candidates for the Lieutenants examination was the
accumulation of an amount of 'sea-time'. In olden-times without a
centralised registry; the word (written) of ship's captains was considered
sufficient; Captains were entitled to have servants; cooks, coxswains,
secretary etc. etc. and many Captains entered on to their ship's muster
rolls the names of sons/nephews/wards etc. . This enabled the boys to
accumulate sea-time (ashore).

Midshipmen were neither officers (who slept aft) nor crew (who slept
for'ard) but were youths who were studying to 'learn  the trade' and sit
their examination for 'Lieutenant's some of these youths may have
accumulated 'sea-time' prior to being accepted for a midshipmen's berth on a
Captain's ship. . When midshipmen were performing on-board roles, it was
considered as 'on-job-training'

[A parallel path existed for _Mates_ , who acted as assistant to the ship's
complement of $Trade Masters.] A 'Mate' could become a candidate alongside
midshipmen for the Lieutenancy examinations.

&gt;&gt;&gt; as an 'additional midshipman', that is, a young man deserving of
&gt;&gt;&gt; officer's training, but carried in addition to the two official
&gt;&gt;&gt; midshipman's positions on a naval vessel. They were officially
&gt;&gt;&gt; recognized as junior officers in training, both by respect of crew and

not really

you could go to captain from lieutenant but most first were &quot;commanders&quot;
and the jump to captain was the stage that required the most influence
finally it was the appointment to command a  &quot;post&quot; ship that made you a
captain , not the other way around

Captain to admiral was by seniority but employment was not guaranteed.
Yellowing was common.

&gt;&gt; Can't these people be treated as common criminals? A combatant
&gt;&gt; must be identifiable as a combatant under Geneva, or he's a
&gt;&gt; civilian. A civilian is subject to criminal law. Common Article
&gt;&gt; three does not remove a person's restrictions under civilian law
&gt;&gt; (or under the regulations an occupier may set in place of
&gt;&gt; civilian law). It does prohibit incarcerating or killing him out
&gt;&gt; of hand.

&gt;&gt; Peter Skelton

&gt;AFAIK in Canada and the US a serving military person can be treated as a
&gt;common criminal - they get handed over to the civil authorities, and stuff
&gt;happens from there. For misdemeanours and minor felonies I doubt that this
&gt;would happen...for major shit it often would. There is after all a reason
&gt;why Japanese legal systems get a crack at US Marines who do really nasty
&gt;shit. And I suspect that a Marine who axed 15 coeds in California while on
&gt;leave would get a CM in CamLej - he'd probably go to Cali.
">

It happens for relatively minor stuff. Boys at Fort Drum get
brought over the river for some kinds of misbehavior, like
breaking stuff in a bar. (In th one case I know about they had
the choice of paying damages or being charged. Paid and
appologized like gentlemen.)

I doubt very much that we'd be able to do much about a civilian
who did the same thing.
