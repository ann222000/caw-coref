Money Trumps Peace...Sometimes

By Cindy Sheehan
Created Feb 16 2007 - 8:47am

It is always painful to watch George stumble his way through press
conferences. He can't get through a sentence without at least two-three
"uhs," his eye lids flutter up and down in what my daughter, Carly, calls
the "liar's blink" and just because it is painful that a human like that is
ostensibly the leader of the free world. There is always a plethora of
things that he says, does, or screws up on to write about but this time what
caught my attention happened during the Q &amp; A. George was asked if he
thought the economic sanctions on Iran would work because so many European
nations trade with that country.

He stopped to collect his thoughts with what he thought must've looked like
a studied and careful demeanor, but more like someone with a sour tummy, and
said: "well, let's put it this way.money trumps peace, sometimes. In other
words, commercial interests are very powerful interests throughout the world
(I added the italics). It is always interesting with people who frequently
play fast and loose with the truth, such as the liars in BushCo, once in
awhile, if they talk long enough they tell a truth.

"Money trumps peace" is the fundamental reason for the invasions and
subsequent gory and violent occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. In Richard
Behan's excellent article: From Iraq to Afghanistan: Connecting the Dots
with Oil [1], he brilliantly follows the history of the oil-money trail in
these countries that are one, rich in oil, and two, well placed for the
transportation and delivery of oil. Neither Iraq nor Afghanistan, or their
leaders or governments had anything to do with 9-11, but they were in the
way of oil and other industries that profit from oil, so they had to go.
Money trumped peace in those countries and they are destroyed and hundreds
of thousands of Iraqis, Afghanis and Americans have been slaughtered because
they were blocking American imperialistic profiteering.

"Money trumps peace" is the underlying reason for all wars as two time
Congressional Medal of Honor winner and highly decorated Major General
Smedley D. Butler wrote in his reflective, yet prophetic, work War is a
Racket:

WAR is a racket. It always has been.

It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most
vicious. It is the only one international in scope. It is the only one in
which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives.

A racket is best described, I believe, as something that is not what it
seems to the majority of the people. Only a small "inside" group knows what
it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense
of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.

During the short booklet which every prospective parent, current parent and
every teen should read thoroughly and often, he keeps referring to World War
I as the "World War" because he was writing directly after the "Great War;"
the "war to end all wars." There was no World War II.yet. General Butler was
no unwashed, hippie peace-nik. He was a warrior who, as often times happens
when men face the horrors of war ("War is hell:" General Sherman), saw the
futility of killing as a diplomatic tool that kills and maims our young
people for "the benefit of the very few."

"Money trumps peace" should be the rallying call of all the Democrats and
Republicans who are exploiting our tired and wounded soldiers in the field
to justify handing BushCo more money to complete his mission of totally
decimating the Middle East for the oil companies, construction contractors,
and defense industries. How many times have we heard: "We have to vote for
the emergency funding for the troops." That money is not for the troops,
never has been for the troops, and the troops in the field wouldn't need any
support if they used the money that was already in the pipeline to bring our
soldiers and marines home from the killing deserts. I talked to a young lady
at a university in Minnesota whose good friend was a Marine in Iraq who just
got home and one of the only things that he shared with her was that he had
to eat ants. If you don't believe me, just ask Mr. "You go to war with the
Army you have, not the Army you want." Our troops have never been supported
in this monstrous mistake of a war and they have never received the tools
they need to survive, let alone be successful in their so-called mission.
The money goes to one thousand dollar a day mercenaries---not our two
thousand dollar a month grunts.

"Money trumps peace" when while asking for tens of billions of more dollars
for war, George is balancing the budget off of the backs of vets who have
served this country honorably by cutting back on VA benefits. Many times I
am asked: "What would you say to Bush if you were to meet with him now?" I
think my first question would be: "How the hell do you look at yourself in
the mirror?" How dare he?

"Money trumps peace" is one of the reasons why true peace won't be possible
when our country is mis-governed by people who are beholden to and
entrenched in the military industrial complex. K-Street palm greasers have
an easier passage in the Halls of Congress than do activists with petitions,
or a Gold Star Mother wearing a "protest shirt" do.

"Money trumps peace" is the problem when some leaders of Congress, who
should be working day and night to bring our troops home to save Iraq and
the lives and souls of our brave soldiers and marines, are out raising money
for presidential campaigns that are still a year away. Sometime between now
and the first primaries in 2008 we will be holding vigils for the 4000th
troop killed in Iraq and thousands of Iraqi families will be overcome with
grief and pain while the talking head shows are already consumed by election
fever.

"Money will always trump peace" unless BushCo are impeached, removed from
office and imprisoned for leading our military like lambs to the slaughter
to die for Raytheon, Halliburton and Blackwater Security.

"Money will always trump peace" until we the people demand that our tax
dollars remain in our communities, schools, and families and not directly
funneled from The Treasury Department to the Pentagon, so that our children
do not have to offer themselves up as these human sacrificial lambs.

Peace can and should trump money, but only if we are willing to stand up and
challenge the continuing and immoral perception that "Money trumps peace."
