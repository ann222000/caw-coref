96 Nissan Sentra Using a lot of coolant. No drips.

I have a 96 Nissan Sentra which is using about a quart of coolant every
150 miles!  There is no visible leak, no drip, no puddle.  But there is
sometimes a smell of antifreeze while the car is driven.  A mech told
me he noticed a sweet smell from the exhaust, but I do not notice it.
There is no smoke of any color from the exhaust pipe.

I had the cooling system pressure tested at a repair shop. They said
it was fine, holding pressure well, and that the head gasket was OK,
since the pressure didn't flutter while it was running. They tested it
with the engine off and with it running.

I pulled all 4 spark plugs. They look normal, just brownish/ rusty
from being run for about 60K miles or so. (The mech said they looked
normal, too).  Each cylinder has some carbon deposition, and they all
look about the same. (No "gleaming clean" cylinders cleaned by burning
coolant.)

Since tyhe cylinders don't look "steam cleaned", I am hoping I am not
burning coolant internally.

Since I can sometimes smell antifreeze while driving, I think it is
leaking out somewhere and burning up right away.  I've watched it idle
and looked all over for a leak, or steaming coolant, never saw
anything.

The oil looks normal too.

I haven't yet driven it up on ramps and looked at it from underneath
while it idles. That's next, I guess.

The car runs fine, and the temp is normal.

Radiator cap is fine, according to the mech. (But it is awful easy to
put on and take off).

No bubbles in overflow reservoir.

Any comments welcome!  Thanks

you likely have a blown head gasket, sounds like its not very bad yet but it
will get worse

If you are smelling it when you drive, its a leak, not a head gasket.

You need to look when the engine is cold.  A quart in 150 miles is a very
small leak, basically a drop every so often.  That's not enough to make
steam. When the engine is hot, a small drip evaporates before you ever see
it.  As the engine cools down and the pressure in the cooling system drops,
a drop or two will survive that can be detected.

Look for drops on the floor under the car in the morning before you start it
up, also feel around the heater hoses and connections and the radiator hoses
and connections for wetness and look for little puddles on the engine before
you start it in the morning.  Also check the oil for a milky appearance that
would indicate water getting into it, but if they already checked and passed
the head gaskets, you probably won't find anything in the oil.

Another possibility is the radiator cap.  If the cap is not holding the
prescribed pressure, too much can blow out into the overflow and be lost
when it overflows the overflow tank.

One last possibility is a leak in the heater core.  The symptoms include
smelling antifreeze when you drive and a slimy build up on the windshield if
you ever use the defogger.

the smell is coming from his exhaust, indicating a head gasket leak, even
though pressure tests are good, the leak could be small enough not to be
detected but its still there, head gasket failure will happen

But surely, if it's coming from the exhaust, it won't smell like
anti-freeze anymore because its gone through the combustion process.
Since the OP does smell anti-freeze, then EMeyer's suggestion is on point.

his mechanic said sweet smell, which comes from burned antifreeze, and yes
yul smell it from the axhaust, ive had this problem on an 85 s-10 blazer and
had a small leak in a head gasket that couldnt be found until the head
gasket finally blew big time

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The oil looks normal too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I haven't yet driven it up on ramps and looked at it from underneath
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;while it idles. That's next, I guess.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The car runs fine, and the temp is normal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Radiator cap is fine, according to the mech. (But it is awful easy to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;put on and take off).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No bubbles in overflow reservoir.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Any comments welcome!  Thanks

&gt;&gt;But surely, if it's coming from the exhaust, it won't smell like
&gt;&gt;anti-freeze anymore because its gone through the combustion process.
&gt;&gt;Since the OP does smell anti-freeze, then EMeyer's suggestion is on point.

OK, fair enough.

I knew you had issues with Nisstech, but I never suspected you were psychic
too.  Where does he say there is any smell coming from the exhaust, or white
smoke, or milky oil, or overheating that would indicate a head gasket?  I
suppose its possible, but I sure wouldn't be looking for that before
checking all the likely sources first.

I've experienced many anti-freeze leaks in 40 years of driving and have yet
to smell antifreeze in the exhaust.  Every time I've ever smelled any when
driving, its been a heater hose or heater core.

&gt;&gt; If you are smelling it when you drive, its a leak, not a head gasket.

&gt;&gt; You need to look when the engine is cold.  A quart in 150 miles is a very
&gt;&gt; small leak, basically a drop every so often.  That's not enough to make
&gt;&gt; steam. When the engine is hot, a small drip evaporates before you ever see
&gt;&gt; it.  As the engine cools down and the pressure in the cooling system
&gt; drops,
&gt;&gt; a drop or two will survive that can be detected.

&gt;&gt; Look for drops on the floor under the car in the morning before you start
&gt; it
&gt;&gt; up, also feel around the heater hoses and connections and the radiator
&gt; hoses
&gt;&gt; and connections for wetness and look for little puddles on the engine
&gt; before
&gt;&gt; you start it in the morning.  Also check the oil for a milky appearance
&gt; that
&gt;&gt; would indicate water getting into it, but if they already checked and
&gt; passed
&gt;&gt; the head gaskets, you probably won't find anything in the oil.

&gt;&gt; Another possibility is the radiator cap.  If the cap is not holding the
&gt;&gt; prescribed pressure, too much can blow out into the overflow and be lost
&gt;&gt; when it overflows the overflow tank.

&gt;&gt; One last possibility is a leak in the heater core.  The symptoms include
&gt;&gt; smelling antifreeze when you drive and a slimy build up on the windshield
&gt; if
&gt;&gt; you ever use the defogger.

You're all wrong. Intake manifold gasket. Coolant is circulated through
the intake. Gasket leaks and coolant gets sucked up into engine and
burned, hence the smell. Happened to me on a different car. Compression
test couldn't find it because it wasn't a head problem.

Thanks. Interesting. I was hoping not to muddy the waters with  this
next info, but I was getting a slow drip from the thermowax valve unit
when the car was running, and still cold. After a few months of this
slow external drip, it stopped. I thought, and the mech thought, too,
that the coolant had started to leak INTO the intake from the thermowax
unit,instead of out of it. Sooo,   I rerouted the coolant hoses from
the thermowax unit to bypass it, thinking that might stop the coolant
loss. But it had no effect on it. Still used a lot of coolant.  BTW,
the thermowax unit is right under the throttle body (or the thing right
next to it, sorry). It warms up from coolant and extends a rod which
moves the high idle cam.

The mech suggested this internal leak, but I thought " Why would the
design of the car allow coolant to get into the intake from this
thermowax area. All the thermowax unit needs is for coolant to go thru
some passages near it, to hrat it up. Coolant doesnt have to actually
touch the unit itself". But there was definitely coolant leaking OUT of
the thermowax unit, so yes, coolant was touhing it. I guess coolant
could also get INTO the air stream there, if the car was designed with
a gasket or O ring sealing it from the intake.

But, of course, rerouting the hoses arounf the thermowax unit didn't
help !!

Maybe there are some other areas for coolant to get sucked into the
intake? Intake man gasket is one, of course.  But why are my cylinders
all showing "normal" carbon buildup? Wouldn't they be squeaky clean if
I'm burning so much coolant?

Thanks

bad head gasket also does this

&gt; You're all wrong. Intake manifold gasket. Coolant is circulated through

&gt; burned, hence the smell. Happened to me on a different car. Compression

&gt; &gt;&gt; I knew you had issues with Nisstech, but I never suspected you were
&gt; &gt; psychic
&gt; &gt;&gt; too.  Where does he say there is any smell coming from the exhaust,
&gt; &gt;&gt; or
&gt; &gt; white
&gt; &gt;&gt; smoke, or milky oil, or overheating that would indicate a head
&gt; &gt;&gt; gasket?  I suppose its possible, but I sure wouldn't be looking for
&gt; &gt;&gt; that before checking all the likely sources first.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I've experienced many anti-freeze leaks in 40 years of driving and
&gt; &gt;&gt; have
&gt; &gt; yet
&gt; &gt;&gt; to smell antifreeze in the exhaust.  Every time I've ever smelled any
&gt; &gt;&gt; when driving, its been a heater hose or heater core.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you are smelling it when you drive, its a leak, not a head
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gasket.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You need to look when the engine is cold.  A quart in 150 miles is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt; &gt; very
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; small leak, basically a drop every so often.  That's not enough to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; make steam. When the engine is hot, a small drip evaporates before
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you ever
&gt; &gt; see
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it.  As the engine cools down and the pressure in the cooling
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; system
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drops,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a drop or two will survive that can be detected.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Look for drops on the floor under the car in the morning before
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you
&gt; &gt; start
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; up, also feel around the heater hoses and connections and the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; radiator
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hoses
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and connections for wetness and look for little puddles on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; engine
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; before
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you start it in the morning.  Also check the oil for a milky
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; appearance
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; would indicate water getting into it, but if they already checked
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; passed
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the head gaskets, you probably won't find anything in the oil.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Another possibility is the radiator cap.  If the cap is not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; holding the prescribed pressure, too much can blow out into the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; overflow and be
&gt; &gt; lost
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; when it overflows the overflow tank.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One last possibility is a leak in the heater core.  The symptoms
&gt; &gt; include
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; smelling antifreeze when you drive and a slimy build up on the
&gt; &gt; windshield
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; if
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you ever use the defogger.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I have a 96 Nissan Sentra which is using about a quart of coolant
&gt; &gt; every
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 150 miles!  There is no visible leak, no drip, no puddle.  But
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; there
&gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; sometimes a smell of antifreeze while the car is driven.  A mech
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; told me he noticed a sweet smell from the exhaust, but I do not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; notice it. There is no smoke of any color from the exhaust pipe.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  I had the cooling system pressure tested at a repair shop. They
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  said
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it was fine, holding pressure well, and that the head gasket was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; OK, since the pressure didn't flutter while it was running. They
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; tested it with the engine off and with it running.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  I pulled all 4 spark plugs. They look normal, just brownish/
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  rusty
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; from being run for about 60K miles or so. (The mech said they
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; looked normal, too).  Each cylinder has some carbon deposition,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and they all look about the same. (No &quot;gleaming clean&quot; cylinders
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; cleaned by burning coolant.)

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Since tyhe cylinders don't look &quot;steam cleaned&quot;, I am hoping I am
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not burning coolant internally.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  Since I can sometimes smell antifreeze while driving, I think it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; leaking out somewhere and burning up right away.  I've watched it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; idle and looked all over for a leak, or steaming coolant, never
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; saw anything.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  The oil looks normal too.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  I haven't yet driven it up on ramps and looked at it from
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  underneath
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; while it idles. That's next, I guess.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  The car runs fine, and the temp is normal.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Radiator cap is fine, according to the mech. (But it is awful
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; easy to put on and take off).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  No bubbles in overflow reservoir.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  Any comments welcome!  Thanks

Let me mudddy the waters even more! This thermowax valve may be the
mechanical equivalent of what I'm about to describe, but in my 98
Maxima, there's a coolant hose which routes coolant to the throttle
body. There's possibly another place to consider.

I don't know your car well, but check where the throttle body bolts to
the intake. On my car, the gasket between the two was leaking coolant
into the throttle body. I said intake in my previous post because I was
too in a hurry to be specific, but that's where I found my mysterious
leak. Of course if you by-passed the supply, this may not be it.
