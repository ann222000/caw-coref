Hi all!
I have a  GE Microwave on my Allmand 31"Montana".
Model JES738
Electrical Input ° 120V (Amperage)  9.3
Electrical Input ° 120V (Watts)  1050
Frequency (MHz)  2450

I recently purchased a 2000 W (4000 W surge) Power Inverter which I intend to install.  The inverter is Modified Sine Wave and not Pure Sine wave.
I contacted GE to see if I could use the microwave on a Modified Sine Inverter.
Their reply
"An inverter is not recommended to be used with a GE microwave.
The oven must be plugged into its own electrical outlet to prevent the
flickering of the lights, blowing of a fuse or tripping of a circuit
breaker."
I know many of you have microwave ovens onboard . Your thoughts/comments would be appreciated.
Thanks

I have a cheap 1750 inverter hooked to an 8D battery and I run a microwave
with it (800w I think).  No problem.  Totally changes anchoring out.  I
wasn’t smart enough to ask all the questions, I just tried it.

Hi Tom,

I have a cheap 2000/1000 watt inverter with a 700 watt microwave running off of a 440 amp hr battery bank.  I normally run the motor when I need to use the microwave for more than a minute.  It works great.  I also run a 10 cup coffee maker on the same setup without the motor.

I have friends who have a 1000 watt inverter and run their microwave
all the time. No problem. The GE comment is just covering their ** so
you can not complain.

Agreed!
I have an 800Watt microwave operating off a 2500 Watt inverter and I can
operate my Microwave and Home Theater at the same time with no problems.
One trick.  Do not skimp on the cable sizes between your battery and  your
inverter and your wiring to the microwave.  Oversize the cables and  keep them
as short as you can to maximize the capability of the inverter.
P.S.  Don't dry your dog in the microwave!!  It doesn't  work.

All.
Thanks for all the comments. I will give it a try (using a HOT DOG) once the inverter is hooked up. If the worst that can happen is that the microwave goes, well....... they sell 700W microwaves for $ 43.- so what the heck........

It's good to learn from others mistakes!

Whoa Bob, someone with an Allmand in Punta Gorda! My current project,
a salvage 31, is at Bowes on the hard. I pass through Punta Gorda
every time I go from my home in Cape Coral to Bowes to work on the old
girl. She is a total resoration so she will be there for a little
while.

I brought back a frend's Hunter last week that he had taken up to
Punta Gorda. But, due to health he couldn't sail her back home to Fort
Myers. It was a perfect day for a solo sail, on a reach in a winter
fresh breeze, all the way down to York Island by St. James City, then
drop the hook just as the sun set. I love stuff like that when my
boats a long way form done.

I would appreciate an opportunity to feast my eyes on an Allmand that
is not a total project boat. Maybe we could kook up sometime?

Hello Rob &amp; Bob! I thought you might like to know you're not the only Allmand fans in the area. My wife &amp; I are in the process of retiring &amp; just moved to a condo unit at Burnt Store Marina in Punta Gorda in January. If you're planning on getting together to tell Allmand stories, etc., I'd be interested in joining you. I have a few stories of my own to tell.

As you may or may not recall, I owned an Allmand 31 "High Roller" for about 6 years that was completely lost last June during a nor'easter in Scituate, MA. The mooring line wrapped around the chain &amp; chafed through, causing the boat to end up on the rocks. There it was holed in several spots after 2 day of pounding. The BoatUS insurance investigator concluded the man servicing my mooring not only failed to install a swivel, but after the storm it appears he tried to make it look as if he did. BoatUS has paid me the amount of my policy, and now we both have attorneys who are expected to bring suit in federal court before long. Check our the picture I've attached &amp; you'll see my worst nightmare realized.

I'm in the process of buying a replacement &amp; expect to close this week on a 1976 Cape Dory 30. It's at Olsen's Marine in Ft. Myers Beach getting outfitted before I take it to a slip I have at Burnt Store in about a week. I couldn't get insurance because of my claim even though there was no question I was faultless. The only way I could get back on the water was to find a boat at a really good price &amp; self insure. I sure hope we have a mild hurricane season this year!

Hi Bill,

Some picture of High Roller!  Sorry you had to go through something so
horable that wasn't your doing.
Iv'e refit 3 other boats in the past year from hurricane salvage as a
side business, an Eercson, a Hunter and an Islander. The Allmand 31
was looking forward to keeping for a while. Haven't renamed her yet.

Thanks for the reply and hope to have the opportunity to meet you.

Rob
