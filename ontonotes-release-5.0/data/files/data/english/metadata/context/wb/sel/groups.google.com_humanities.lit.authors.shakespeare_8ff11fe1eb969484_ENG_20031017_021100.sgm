_________________________________________________

Here's an interesting example of northern
dialect mixed into the East Midlands dialect of the
West Midlands butcher from Stratford's King Lear.

Lear says in IV. vi. 246

Ice try whither your Costard, or my Ballow be
the harder.

Now the word 'ice' is actually 'I shall' in the north,
north defined as 'anything that is not west or south'
in terms of English dialects. The Stratford butcher's
dialect was a west dialect.

The OED shows various forms including 7 -ce:

5. Reduced enclitic forms (all persons and numbers).
() 6 -sh, -s, 7 -ce, 6- -se, 7- s'; miswritten 7-9 's, 8-9 'se.
Very frequent in the north, in the expressions Ise uphaud,
Ise warrant: see Uphold, Warrant in Eng. Dial. Dict.

The word 'costard' for 'head' is ME for 'apple'
probably from OF but 'ballow' seems not to be
a word although the OED notes that Halliwell-
Philipps marked the word ballow 'Northern.'

&lt;&lt;A 700-year-old fresco bearing an uncanny resemblance to Walt Disney's
Mickey MOUSE has been discovered in Austria. The mouse figure was unearthed
by an art historian working on the church in the southern village of MALTA.
The figure bears an enormous resemblance to Walt Disney's famous MUSEe to
this 14th Century figure. It has the same upturned nose and large, rounded
ears. The manager of the local tourism office is claiming that the discovery
makes the famous mouse a citizen of Austria. But art historians are
not convinced the water-damaged depiction is a MOUSE at all.
The figure is portrayed kneeling in front of a depiction of St Christopher.
Historians say the creature may in fact be a weasel, which
in medieval times was believed to give birth through its ears.&gt;&gt;
------------------------------------------------------

700-year-old picture of 'Mickey Mouse' found in Austrian church What appears
to be a 700-year-old picture of Mickey Mouse has been discovered on a church
fresco in Austria. The 700 year old fresco that depicts a Mickey Mouse-style
cartoon /Oscar Kornyeiemail Walt Disney first sketched his character in 1928
but an Austrian art historian spotted an uncannily similar drawing. The
painting, which has been dated back to the early 14th Century, is in the
Community Church in Malta, Carinthia. Next to a large sketch of St.
Christopher is a clear drawing of the mouse. Art historian Eduard Mahlknecht
believes the similarity to Mickey is pure coincidence. He told Austrian
daily 'Krone: &quot;St Christopher was often depicted surrounded by various
animals and sea-life, and in this case something that resembles Mickey
Mouse. &quot;It is most likely to be a drawing of a beaver or a weasel.&quot; However,
Carinthia's tourism office is already thinking of ways to cash in on the
sketch. Siggi Neuschitzer, manager of the Malta Tourism Association, said:
&quot;The similarity of the painting to Mickey Mouse is so astounding that the
Disney concern could even lose its world-wide copyright licence. &quot;Our Mickey
Mouse is 700 years older than Disney's and we will get it legally examined.&quot;

&lt;&lt;Bobo is de Teddybeer. We kennen Mr. Burns als de kwaadaardige industrieel
uit 'the Simpsons'. Mr. Burns zijn teddybeer Bobo was het onderwerp van een
hele aflevering in 1993. Toen Mr. Burns nog heel jong was, offerde hij zijn
teddybeer op, voor een rijk leven. In de aflevering van 'de Simpsons', komt
Maggie Simpson in het bezit van Bobo de beer. Hij wordt gevonden door Bart
Simpson, in een zak met ijs. Mr. Burns wil de beer van Homer kopen, maar als
Homer ziet hoe gehecht zijn kleine Maggie aan de beer is, besluit hij de
beer niet te verkopen. Aan het eind van de aflevering aanvaard Mr. Burns
zijn verlies in Maggie's zandbak. Als hij Maggie het advies geeft goed op de
beer te passen en niet dezelfde fout als hem te maken, geeft ze Bobo terug
aan mr. Burns.

Bobo heeft ooit in het gezelschap verkeert van minstens twee historische
figuren. In 1927 stak hij de Atlantische Oceaan over met Charles Lindbergh
en in 1945 zat hij in een bunker in Berlijn, tijdens de laatste dag van
Adolf Hitler.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Police said the painting was stolen at about 11am when thieves,

from

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stolen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They also released descriptions of two men seen near the castle

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Da Vinci painting stolen from Scottish castle

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A Leonardo da Vinci painting, the Madonna with the Yarnwinder,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has been stolen from Drumlanrig Castle in Scotland.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Police said the painting was stolen at about 11am when thieves,
&gt; posing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as visitors to the castle, overpowered a female guide and took it
&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; where it was displayed in the castle's staircase hall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Detectives said they are looking for four men seen driving a white
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Volkswagen Golf Gti in the area around the time the painting was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stolen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They also released descriptions of two men seen near the castle
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at the time of the theft. Both men are said to be in their
&gt; forties,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; about 5ft 10 tall, slim and clean shaven.

&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;A 700-year-old fresco bearing an uncanny resemblance to Walt Disney's
&gt;&gt; Mickey MOUSE has been discovered in Austria. The mouse figure was
unearthed
&gt;&gt; by an art historian working on the church in the southern village of
MALTA.
&gt;&gt; The figure bears an enormous resemblance to Walt Disney's famous MUSEe
to
&gt;&gt; this 14th Century figure. It has the same upturned nose and large,
rounded
&gt;&gt; ears. The manager of the local tourism office is claiming that the
discovery
&gt;&gt; makes the famous mouse a citizen of Austria. But art historians are
&gt;&gt; not convinced the water-damaged depiction is a MOUSE at all.
&gt;&gt; The figure is portrayed kneeling in front of a depiction of St
Christopher.
&gt;&gt; Historians say the creature may in fact be a weasel, which
&gt;&gt; in medieval times was believed to give birth through its ears.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt; 700-year-old picture of 'Mickey Mouse' found in Austrian church What
appears
&gt;&gt; to be a 700-year-old picture of Mickey Mouse has been discovered on a
church
&gt;&gt; fresco in Austria. The 700 year old fresco that depicts a Mickey
Mouse-style
&gt;&gt; cartoon /Oscar Kornyeiemail Walt Disney first sketched his character in
1928
&gt;&gt; but an Austrian art historian spotted an uncannily similar drawing. The
&gt;&gt; painting, which has been dated back to the early 14th Century, is in the
&gt;&gt; Community Church in Malta, Carinthia. Next to a large sketch of St.
&gt;&gt; Christopher is a clear drawing of the mouse. Art historian Eduard
Mahlknecht
&gt;&gt; believes the similarity to Mickey is pure coincidence.

Historical Depictions of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake
by Jan T. Kozak &amp; Charles D. James

&lt;&lt;Although not the strongest or most deadly earthquake in human history,
the 1755 Lisbon earthquake's impact, not only on Portugal but on all of
Europe, was profound and lasting. Depictions of the earthquake in art
and literature can be found in several European countries, and these
were produced and reproduced for centuries following the event,
which came to be known as &quot;The Great Lisbon Earthquake.&quot;

The oscillation of suspended objects at great distances from the
epicenter indicate an enormous area of perceptibility. The observation
of seiches as far away as Finland, suggest a magnitude approaching 9.0.
Precursory phenomena were reported, including turbid waters in Portugal
and Spain, falling water level in wells in Spain, and a decrease in
water flow in springs and fountains.&gt;&gt;

Despite tremendous literary &amp; financial success, William Sydney Porter
was a singularly unhappy man. He died an alcoholic on June 4, 1910
in a New York City hospital with 23 cents in his pocket.
His final words were:

&quot;Turn up the lights; I don't want to go home in the dark.&quot;

In 1896, Porter was charged with embezzlement from First National Bank
where he had worked as a teller two years earlier.
The somewhat suspicious charges were for misappropriation of:

$554.48 on October 10, 1894;
$299.60 on November 12, 1894;
and $299.60 on November 12, 1895.

Habsburg (1282 - November 12, 1918)

From Wikipedia,

&lt;&lt;Habsburg (or Hapsburg) was the name of one of the ruling houses of
Europe: rulers of Austria (as dukes 1282 - 1453, archdukes 1453 - 1804,
and emperors 1804 - 1918), kings of Spain (1516 - 1700), and Holy Roman
Emperors for several centuries to 1806. The name is derived from the
Swiss Habichtsburg (Hawk Castle), the family seat in the 12th and 13th
centuries at Habsburg, Switzerland. From South-East-Germany the family
extended its influence and holdings to the eastern reaches of the Holy
Roman Empire, roughly today's Austria (1278 - 1382). Within only two or
three generations, the Habsburgs had managed to secure an initially
intermittent grasp on the imperial throne that would last for centuries
(1273 - 1291, 1298 - 1308, 1438 - 1740, and 1745 - 1806).

After the marriage of Maximilian I. with Mary, heiress of Burgundy (the
Low Countries) and the marriage of his son Philipp the Fair with Juana,
heiress of Spain and its newly-founded empire,
Charles V inherited an empire where the sun does not set.

Upon the abdication of the Emperor Charles V, also King Charles I
of Spain (1516 - 1556), the family split into the Austrian Habsburgs
and the Spanish Habsburgs.

By the turn of the 19th century, Habsburg power had waned
significantly. The Spanish line died out in 1700, and in 1806 the Holy
Roman Empire was wound up under the French Emperor Napoleon I's
reorganisation of Germany. In Austria, however, the Habsburgs maintained
their hold, declaring themselves Emperors of Austria two years after
Napoleon declared himself Emperor of France in 1804.

Emperor Francis I of Austria used the official great title: &quot;We,
Francis the First, by the grace of God Emperor of Austria; King of
Jerusalem, Hungary, Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia, and
Lodomiria; Archduke of Austria; Duke of Lorraine, Salzburg, Würzburg,
Franconia, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola ; Grand Duke of Cracow;
Prince of Transylvania; Margrave of Moravia; Duke of Sandomir, Masovia,
Lublin, Upper and Lower Silesia, Auschwitz and Zator, Teschen, and
Friule; Prince of Berchtesgaden and Mergentheim; Princely Count of
Habsburg, Gorizia, and Gradisca and of the Tyrol;
and Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and Istria&quot;.

Hungary, nominally under Habsburg kingship from 1526 but mostly under
Ottoman Turkish occupation for 150 years, was reconquered in 1683 -
1699, the Habsburgs remaining kings of Hungary under an 1867 autonomy
arrangement (see Austria-Hungary) until their deposition in both Austria
and Hungary in 1918 following defeat in World War I.&gt;&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;&quot;Let all men know how empty and worthless is the power of kings.

For there is none worthy of the name but God, whom heaven,
earth and sea obey&quot;.

So spoke King Canute the Great, the legend says, seated on his throne on
the seashore, waves lapping round his feet. Canute had learned that his
flattering courtiers claimed he was &quot;So great, he could command the
tides of the sea to go back&quot;. Now Canute was not only a religious man,
but also a clever politician. He knew his limitations - even if his
courtiers did not - so he had his throne carried to the seashore and sat
on it as the tide came in, commanding the waves to advance no further.
When they didn't, he had made his point that, though the deeds of kings
might appear 'great' in the minds of men, they were as nothing in the
face of God's power.&gt;&gt;

California coast to find a hospitable port for the Philippine ships.
His voyage is remarkable for the place names that date from it.

Vizcaino named San Diego because he arrived there on the feast day
of San Diego de Alcala (November 12). He also named San Clemente,
Catalina, Santa Barbara, Point Concepcion, Carmel, Monterey

&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;A 700-year-old fresco bearing an uncanny resemblance to Walt Disney's
&gt;&gt;&gt; Mickey MOUSE has been discovered in Austria. The mouse figure was
&gt; unearthed
&gt;&gt;&gt; by an art historian working on the church in the southern village of
&gt; MALTA.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The figure bears an enormous resemblance to Walt Disney's famous MUSEe
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; this 14th Century figure. It has the same upturned nose and large,
&gt; rounded
&gt;&gt;&gt; ears. The manager of the local tourism office is claiming that the
&gt; discovery
&gt;&gt;&gt; makes the famous mouse a citizen of Austria. But art historians are
&gt;&gt;&gt; not convinced the water-damaged depiction is a MOUSE at all.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The figure is portrayed kneeling in front of a depiction of St
&gt; Christopher.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Historians say the creature may in fact be a weasel, which
&gt;&gt;&gt; in medieval times was believed to give birth through its ears.&gt;&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; 700-year-old picture of 'Mickey Mouse' found in Austrian church What
&gt; appears
&gt;&gt;&gt; to be a 700-year-old picture of Mickey Mouse has been discovered on a
&gt; church
&gt;&gt;&gt; fresco in Austria. The 700 year old fresco that depicts a Mickey
&gt; Mouse-style
&gt;&gt;&gt; cartoon /Oscar Kornyeiemail Walt Disney first sketched his character in
&gt; 1928
&gt;&gt;&gt; but an Austrian art historian spotted an uncannily similar drawing. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; painting, which has been dated back to the early 14th Century, is in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Community Church in Malta, Carinthia. Next to a large sketch of St.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Christopher is a clear drawing of the mouse. Art historian Eduard
&gt; Mahlknecht
&gt;&gt;&gt; believes the similarity to Mickey is pure coincidence.

&gt;&gt; And you don't believe that the similarity is pure coincidence, Art?
&gt; No, Dave.

&gt;&gt; What is the supposed connection between Hitler's arrest and Walt

Well? What IS the supposed connection, Art? Inquiring minds are
still left unsatisfied.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; as a starting point. Incidentally, Art, have you figured out yet

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jean Cocteau's successors were and are?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Whoever he is I hope he is enjoying the Madonna with the Yarnwinder:

&gt;&gt; He/she is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Da Vinci painting stolen from Scottish castle

&gt;&gt;&gt; A Leonardo da Vinci painting, the Madonna with the Yarnwinder,
&gt;&gt;&gt; has been stolen from Drumlanrig Castle in Scotland.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Police said the painting was stolen at about 11am when thieves, posing
&gt;&gt;&gt; as visitors to the castle, overpowered a female guide and took it
&gt;&gt;&gt; from where it was displayed in the castle's staircase hall.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Detectives said they are looking for four men seen driving a white
&gt;&gt;&gt; Volkswagen Golf Gti in the area around the time the painting was stolen.

&gt;&gt;&gt; They also released descriptions of two men seen near the castle
&gt;&gt;&gt; at the time of the theft. Both men are said to be in their
&gt;&gt;&gt; forties, about 5ft 10 tall, slim and clean shaven.

Couldn't be me, Art -- I'm not short, nor have I eVER taught
algebraic K-theory. You are misinformed, as usual.

&gt;&gt;&gt; All this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our
&gt;&gt;&gt; knight delivered because the ACORNS they gave him reminded him of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the golden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary
&gt;&gt;&gt; argument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement
&gt;&gt;&gt; without saying a word in reply. Sancho likewise held his peace and
&gt;&gt;&gt; ate ACORNS, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin,
&gt;&gt;&gt; which they had hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.

&gt; Historical Depictions of the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake
&gt; by Jan T. Kozak &amp; Charles D. James

&gt;&lt;&lt;Although not the strongest or most deadly earthquake in human history,
&gt; the 1755 Lisbon earthquake's impact, not only on Portugal but on all of
&gt; Europe, was profound and lasting. Depictions of the earthquake in art
&gt; and literature can be found in several European countries, and these
&gt; were produced and reproduced for centuries following the event,
&gt; which came to be known as &quot;The Great Lisbon Earthquake.&quot;

&gt; The oscillation of suspended objects at great distances from the
&gt; epicenter indicate an enormous area of perceptibility. The observation
&gt; of seiches as far away as Finland, suggest a magnitude approaching 9.0.
&gt; Precursory phenomena were reported, including turbid waters in Portugal
&gt; and Spain, falling water level in wells in Spain, and a decrease in
&gt; water flow in springs and fountains.&gt;&gt;

Oh, I know you got the one from Lisbon, but that's long past, and in
any case it predated the Priory's safe bestowal of the painting. I'm
asking whether you received the one from Finland.
