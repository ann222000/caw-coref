Not really.  Honda even tries to keep it's published Technical Service
bulletins hidden from the customer, unlike most other companies.

Some of the TSBs are available here as ESBs (Export Service Bulletins):

It's odd that Honda is so secretive when Toyota will grant anyone the same
access (and LOTS more!) for ten bucks a day.

John,
It's possible that the reason they do it is to save millions of dollars.
For example, if millions of people that own Honda cars never learn about
TSBs related to their vehicles--Honda will never have to pay any money for
the parts and labor needed to repair their vehicles. It's clear proof that
Honda cares more about profits than they care about their customers. Most
companies are like Honda--they care more about profits than they care
about their customers.

Ohhhhh, I get it...It's a c-o-n-s-p-i-r-a-c-y.

Why on earth would Honda bother issuing a TSB, then keep it secret? Do you
have any idea how many TSBs there are overall?

I think it's more likely that Honda is afraid of alarmed people storming
the dealership demanding that the work be done to their car, even though
their VIN does not fall within the affected range. Most TSBs are fairly
minor.

IOW, the non-publicity is done to preserve people's peace of mind. If it's
a safety-related TSB or recall, the owner of record is notified either by
phone call or by mail.

If you call up the dealership, they will be quite happy to tell you if
there are any TSBs relating to your car, and what the TSB says.

Tegger,
No, I don't think that it's a conspiracy--just normal business practices
for most companies. Early last year, I found a list of the TSBs related to
my Honda. During the tune-up, I asked the person at the Honda service
department to correct any problems related to the TSBs. He said that he
was not aware of any TSBs related to my Honda. He was shocked when I
showed him the list. After looking at the list, he said that he would have
the mechanic check those items. Service writers (or whatever they are
called) should be required to check those TSBs on every car they repair. I
know that they don't do that at the local Honda dealership--even when a
complete tune-up is done.

And this is exactly why Honda doesn't publish the TSBs for general
consumption.  People seem to think a TSB is a secret recall.  It is not.
The fact that a TSB exists relating to a specific repair does not provide
for any free repair work outside your warranty.  They are simply amendments
to the shop manuals with updated troubleshooting and repair procedures.   It
is pertinent only to the continuing education of the tech trying to diagnose
and repair a problem with your car, not a laundry list to be checked on
every car brought into the dealer.

Well, actually, a lot of TSBs are issued as fixes for minor problems that
have been experienced and reported by dealerships in the field. Have a
browse through some of these:
http://www.tegger.com/hondafaq/tsb/#list

TSBs can not be issued unless somebody reports them. The famous ignition
switch recall, and the famous CR-V brake click TSBs, were issued because
Honda was getting boatloads of reports about these from the dealers, and
they realized there was a systemic problem there. Unlike Mistubishi, Honda
is concerned about their public image, since they rely on continued sales
to stay in business.

Speaking of Mitsubishi, remember how their CEO publicly admitted they had
in fact covered up actual defects in their cars? Just look what the market
has done to them since; nobody trusts Mitsu any more. Mitsu is in trouble
now and will probably go under if the Japanese governemnt does not bail
them out.

The problem is, there are so many TSBs, and most are specific to certain
VINs, that it would be a lot of work for the Service Adviser to dig them
all up and determine by reading them whether or not the car in question is
covered (and has not had the work performed already!).

Honda wants you to call the dealer with the TSB number, so you can be dealt
with in a rational manner before you go ballistic over absolutely nothing.

The OP's ranting about "business practices" illustrates the common public
view that corporations are evil, thieving, selfish entities, interested
only in covering up wrongdoing. And these people VOTE. Scary.

Tegger,
Thanks for your interesting report. I learned some things that I did not
know before about TSBs. I only have one remaining question on this issue:
If the service writers at Honda dealerships--do not check their data base
for TSBs related to the vehicles that are in the shop for service--and
make hard copies for the mechanics--why even have TSBs? It appears to me
that only us people that know about TSBs would ever benefit from them.
What about the thousand of Honda users that don't even know what a TSB
actually is?

tsb's are just informational.   when you bring your car in they run
a VIN status, that lets us know about open recalls or warranty
extensions.    just because there is a tsb on your car doesn't mean it

Sometimes what you say is true, and sometimes TSBs are published to
address problems which have shown up and are real.

Honda is nearly alone in not allowing the public to have access.
Defending them is silly.

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt; &gt; And this is exactly why Honda doesn't publish the TSBs for general
&gt; &gt; consumption.  People seem to think a TSB is a secret recall.  It is
&gt; &gt; not. The fact that a TSB exists relating to a specific repair does not
&gt; &gt; provide for any free repair work outside your warranty.  They are
&gt; &gt; simply amendments to the shop manuals with updated troubleshooting and
&gt; &gt; repair procedures.   It is pertinent only to the continuing education
&gt; &gt; of the tech trying to diagnose and repair a problem with your car, not
&gt; &gt; a laundry list to be checked on every car brought into the dealer.

&gt; Well, actually, a lot of TSBs are issued as fixes for minor problems that
&gt; have been experienced and reported by dealerships in the field. Have a
&gt; browse through some of these:
&gt; http://www.tegger.com/hondafaq/tsb/#list

&gt; TSBs can not be issued unless somebody reports them. The famous ignition
&gt; switch recall, and the famous CR-V brake click TSBs, were issued because
&gt; Honda was getting boatloads of reports about these from the dealers, and
&gt; they realized there was a systemic problem there. Unlike Mistubishi, Honda
&gt; is concerned about their public image, since they rely on continued sales
&gt; to stay in business.

&gt; Speaking of Mitsubishi, remember how their CEO publicly admitted they had
&gt; in fact covered up actual defects in their cars? Just look what the market
&gt; has done to them since; nobody trusts Mitsu any more. Mitsu is in trouble
&gt; now and will probably go under if the Japanese governemnt does not bail
&gt; them out.

&gt; The problem is, there are so many TSBs, and most are specific to certain
&gt; VINs, that it would be a lot of work for the Service Adviser to dig them
&gt; all up and determine by reading them whether or not the car in question is
&gt; covered (and has not had the work performed already!).

&gt; Honda wants you to call the dealer with the TSB number, so you can be
dealt
&gt; with in a rational manner before you go ballistic over absolutely nothing.

&gt; The OP's ranting about &quot;business practices&quot; illustrates the common public
&gt; view that corporations are evil, thieving, selfish entities, interested
&gt; only in covering up wrongdoing. And these people VOTE. Scary.

John,
Great post. I agree with you. Within the past 12 months, various CEOs of
huge companies such as Enron have been arrested. In almost all of those
cases, the CEOs kept company secrets from the stock holders and employees.
When various car companies don't post their TSPs on their websites, it's
appears to many people that they are keeping secrets from their customers.
I'm sure that all of those car companies that do it are able to come up
with some excellent reasons for NOT posting the TSPs on their websites.
It's up to each person as to whether or not to believe them.

You "agree"? How much do you even know about Enron? Nothing, I'll wager.

Enron went broke largely because of botched government electricity
"deregulation", and because of botched government monetary policy. Enron
got into trouble as they shuffled money around in order to look good to
investors and to prevent lawsuits (brought on by botched governmental tort
reform).

From http://www.reason.com/0402/fe.gc.in.shtml :
"The Houston energy company did not go bankrupt because it lost money in
derivatives trading. In fact, Enron was tremendously successful in its
trading operations, racking up billions of dollars in profits. As
documented by economic historian Frank Partnoy, the company went under not
because it was losing money but because it tried to use these profits to
disguise heavy losses in its consulting and technology businesses. When the
accounting shenanigans were exposed, the company’s credibility evaporated,
as did its sources of credit and cash. The company was killed by a lack of
cash flow, not a lack of profits."

Governmental incompetence and iniquity made Enron's environment.

Tegger,
Your post provided proof that I was correct in that Enron it did "disguise
heavy losses...". My point was that Enron did keep secrets from its own
employees and the stock holders. Several months ago, there was a lady on
television saying that she was an Enron employess with over $500,000
invested in Enron stock. The CEO of Enron failed to tell their employees
that the company was in serious financial trouble. Many of theose
employees could have at least cashed in their stocks. Stockholders and
employees lost millions.

Yes, they did. But /why/?

Several reasons:
1) The governments of both California and Alberta got rid of some old, bad
regulations in their electricity industry, and replaced them with new, even
worse ones. They called this "deregulation", a term swallowed and
regurgitated regularly by the stupid media. Enron, being run by some very
intelligent people, learned quickly how to game this new system, and made
most of their money doing that.

Had there been REAL deregulation, Enron would not have been able to reap
the profits they did, and would have been unable to lobby the government to
slant regulations their way, since the government would not have controlled
things.

2) The US government began debasing the currency (inflation). Enron's other
businesses were badly affected by this, and ended up losing massive amounts
of money.

Had the Bush government not monkeyed with currency and credit supply for
their own gain, Enron's other businesses would not have suffered as they
did, and there would not have been dramatic losses to cover up.

3) What's the first thing that happens to companies that lose large amounts
of money? In the US, they get slapped with a lawsuit. Since the US "winner-
pays" legal system makes it costless to launch a suit against somebody,
even with slim or no evidence, being sued is a huge danger for those with
money. When the losses became evident, Enron sought to lessen the danger of
a shareholder suit, and started playing tricks with their accounting.

Had America's tort system been more like it used to be before the
government legalized contingency, "winner-pays", and class action, Enron
would have been under less pressure to keep the bad numbers secret.

The evidence is clear that Enron was, prior to these issues beyond its
control, a very intelligently-run company that was doing what it did very
well. I do not mean to defend or denounce Enron. I'm simply pointing out
that like a good politician or lawyer, they took advantage of the system as
they found it, and profited greatly (as did their shareholders!) until the
government changed the rules on them.

Don't blame Enron, change the system.
1) Repeal the laws allowing contingency and mass tort
2) Get the government out of the electricity business altogether
3) Repeal that law which compels any entity to come public when it acquires
more than 5% of outstanding shares of a publicly-traded company.

This "corporate wrongdoing" thing is a canard. It it were truly widespread,
the whole system would collapse. It's very rare indeed.

Not only that, can you imagine the lawsuits that would have been INSTANTLY
filed against Enron as soon as the losses became known?

America's tort system is the absolute dumbest, most moronic in the entire
lawful world. It is amazing to me that in the midst of all that legislation
and regulation there is anarchy, that anarchy being *directly* caused by
the aforementioned laws.

Anarchy is not lack of law, it is TOO MUCH law.

You are right in everything you wrote. I realize that the gov't made
numerous mistakes related to Enron. However, don't you agree that the CEO
of Enron should NOT have kept the financial problems that they were having
secret from its employees and stock holders? There was a huge airline that
just recently informed the public--including stockholders and
employees--that they were losing millions of dollars every day. That's the
same thing that Enron should have done when they learned that they were
having serious financial problems.

You are right again--they were probably worried about lawsuits, their
stock crashing and hoping to pull thru without anyone ever finding out

And so it appears to be United. However, United has been in Chapter 11

&gt;&gt;&gt; issued because Honda was getting boatloads of reports about these
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the dealers, and they realized there was a systemic problem
&gt;&gt;&gt; there. Unlike Mistubishi, Honda is concerned about their public
&gt;&gt;&gt; image, since they rely on continued sales to stay in business.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Speaking of Mitsubishi, remember how their CEO publicly admitted
&gt;&gt;&gt; they had in fact covered up actual defects in their cars? Just look
&gt;&gt;&gt; what the market has done to them since; nobody trusts Mitsu any
&gt;&gt;&gt; more. Mitsu is in trouble now and will probably go under if the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Japanese governemnt does not bail them out.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem is, there are so many TSBs, and most are specific to
&gt;&gt;&gt; certain VINs, that it would be a lot of work for the Service
&gt;&gt;&gt; Adviser to dig them all up and determine by reading them whether or
&gt;&gt;&gt; not the car in question is covered (and has not had the work
&gt;&gt;&gt; performed already!).

&gt;&gt;&gt; Honda wants you to call the dealer with the TSB number, so you can
&gt;&gt;&gt; be dealt with in a rational manner before you go ballistic over
&gt;&gt;&gt; absolutely nothing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The OP's ranting about &quot;business practices&quot; illustrates the common
&gt;&gt;&gt; public view that corporations are evil, thieving, selfish entities,
&gt;&gt;&gt; interested only in covering up wrongdoing. And these people VOTE.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Scary.

&gt;&gt; Tegger,
&gt;&gt; Thanks for your interesting report. I learned some things that I did
&gt;&gt; not know before about TSBs. I only have one remaining question on
&gt;&gt; this issue: If the service writers at Honda dealerships--do not
&gt;&gt; check their data base for TSBs related to the vehicles that are in
&gt;&gt; the shop for service--and make hard copies for the mechanics--why
&gt;&gt; even have TSBs? It appears to me that only us people that know about
&gt;&gt; TSBs would ever benefit from them. What about the thousand of Honda
&gt;&gt; users that don't even know what a TSB actually is?
&gt;&gt; Jason

&gt;  tsb's are just informational.   when you bring your car in they run
&gt; a VIN status, that lets us know about open recalls or warranty
&gt; extensions.    just because there is a tsb on your car doesn't mean it
&gt; applies....
&gt;           Chip

If you bring in a car that has an issue same as listed on one of the TSB's,
a reputable dealer will take care of the issue for free.  Some dealers are
not as "customer focused" (another way of saying honest, I guess) and you
will need to "remind" them of the TSB.

John and Jason = TROLL?

The fact is TSBs, Service News and anything in writing the dealer gets from Honda
is public knowledge.  You just have to know where to look.

In the case of TSBSs, a little knowledge can be dangerous or even deadly.  Honda
wants only qualified persons, properly equipment to make TSB, or for that matter
any, repairs on their products.  There is nothing sinister about the way Honda
does business.

Here is the footnote at the bottom of every Honda/Acura TSB:  If you don't agree;
Well, that's just not my problem.

CUSTOMER INFORMATION: The information in this bulletin is intended for use only by
skilled technicians who have the proper tools, equipment, and training to
correctly and safely maintain your vehicle. These procedures should not be
attempted by “do-it-yourselfers,” and you should not assume this bulletin applies
to your vehicle, or that your vehicle has the condition described. To determine
whether this information applies, contact an authorized Honda automobile dealer.

&gt; Sometimes what you say is true, and sometimes TSBs are published to

&gt; Honda is nearly alone in not allowing the public to have access.
&gt; Defending them is silly.

&gt; Tegger,
&gt; You are right in everything you wrote. I realize that the gov't made
&gt; numerous mistakes related to Enron. However, don't you agree that the CEO
&gt; of Enron should NOT have kept the financial problems that they were having
&gt; secret from its employees and stock holders? There was a huge airline that
&gt; just recently informed the public--including stockholders and
&gt; employees--that they were losing millions of dollars every day. That's the
&gt; same thing that Enron should have done when they learned that they were
&gt; having serious financial problems.
&gt; Jason

That is legal (as long as the information is announced publicly), but
disastrous to the company and stockholders. The predictable result is a rush
to sell stock when nobody wants to buy (how much would you pay for a stock
that is dropping in value every minute because the company has announced
serious financial problems and sell orders are flooding the market?), with
the price of their stock crashing. The effect would be far worse than the
loss of value if the company liquidated or merged.

The bottom line is that the loss has already occurred and *somebody* has to
shoulder the loss. That somebody is always the stockholders. That's just how
it works.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Well, actually, a lot of TSBs are issued as fixes for minor

Hello,
Thanks for the post. The problem is not for the members of this newsgroup
and other auto and truck related newsgroups. The problem is for the
thousands of people that do not even know what a TSB actually is. As a
result, in most cases, no actions are taken by Honda dealerships to fix
the problems listed in the Honda TSBs. In my cases, I had to take the
summary version of the TSBs to the Honda dealership and show them the
list. The service advisor assured me that the mechanic would check and/or
repair the items on the list. If I had not provided the list--the mechanic
would have never known about the the TSBs related to my vehicle. I have a
simple solution: The service advisor should check the Honda database and
download (make hard copies) of TSBs and RECALL info. related to vehicles
that he or she is responsible for each day. The service advisor should
give the TSBs and RECALL info. to the various mechanics working on those
particular vehicles. The local Honda dealership already does this related
to
RECALL information but they DON'T do it related to TSBs. I saw a post
indicating that some car companies actually post the TSBs on the company
websites. I believe that Honda should do the same thing.
