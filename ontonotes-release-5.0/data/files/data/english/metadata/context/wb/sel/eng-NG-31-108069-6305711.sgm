A man was just waking up from anesthesia after surgery, and his wife was
sitting by his side. His eyes fluttered open and he said, "You're
beautiful." Then he fell asleep again. His wife had never heard him say
that before, so she stayed by his side.

A few minutes later his eyes fluttered open and he said, "You're cute."

The wife was disappointed because instead of "beautiful," it was now
"cute." She asked, "What happened to beautiful?"

The man replied, "The drugs are wearing off."

LOL!

I've only had one serious op - an emergency splenectomy, and I came out of
the anæsthetic they kept me heavily sedated with Morphine.

And this is perfectly true: I kept hallucinating that the Outlook Express
interface was in front of me and filling my field of vision, and every time
there was a noise or a nurse arrived to take any observations, the image of
the interface shattered like a pane of glass and I was back in Intensive
Care again.

It was then that I realised I spend far too much time on the Usenet!

How did it happen?

English spleens! English spleens!
Squishing every day.
Waiting for the surgeon man
To take 'em all away.

An ode to British clumsiness
When falling in the bath,
With arms and legs all flailing round,
And lookin' bloody daft!

Oi!
