1)  Iraq: Bombs kill 18; six US troops KIA
The Columbian

"A car bomb and a suicide attacker killed at least 11 people across Baghdad
on Tuesday as militants show increasing defiance of a major security
operation in the capital. Police said later in the day a suicide bomber in
Baghdad had struck a funeral procession and killed at least seven people.
More than 100 people have been killed in the Baghdad area since Sunday in a
direct challenge to efforts by U.S. and Iraqi forces to restore some
authority on the streets and give the embattled government some breathing
room. ... Altogether, nine U.S. service members have been reported killed
since the beginning of the weekend, six of them on Monday." (02/20/07)

2)  New Kennedy film could kill off one conspiracy theory
Sydney Morning Herald [Australia]

"Previously unreleased footage of John F. Kennedy's fateful motorcade in
Dallas moments before he was gunned down has provided a surprising new
detail in a saga that has gripped the US for four decades. The silent 8mm
film shows a beaming Jacqueline Kennedy close-up, waving to the crowd. It
also briefly shows the US president's coat bunched up on his back -- a
detail that will be scrutinised by conspiracy theorists who see evidence of
a plot in, among other things, the fact the bullet wounds on Kennedy's
jacket and body did not appear to match. The film was donated to the Sixth
Floor Museum in Dallas by George Jefferies, an amateur photographer, and his
son-in-law, Wayne Graham. It was made public yesterday to coincide with the
Presidents Day federal holiday." (02/20/07)

3)  PA: City could pull plug on hotel
Allentown Morning Call

"For the third time in two years, Allentown officials are moving to shut off
utilities to the decrepit downtown Americus Centre Hotel, sending the
handful of shop owners who still occupy the building's first floor
scurrying. The last two times, the city backed off, preferring to try to
broker a sale to wrest the Sixth and Hamilton Street building from owner
Mark Mendelson. This time, city officials say they have run out of patience.
... If Mendelson fails to sell the Americus or repair the building's
electrical system and other critical building safety problems by mid-March,
the city will turn off water and electricity, [Mayor Ed Pawlowski] said.
Pawlowski said the city expects to soon set up scaffolding over the
sidewalks outside the Americus to protect pedestrians from the possibility
of being hit by pieces of the facade. If shutting off utilities fails to get
results, the city will attempt to seize the hotel using eminent domain, he
said." (02/20/07)

4)  Future of Net phone firm Vonage hangs in balance
USA Today

"Verizon and Vonage on Wednesday will present opening statements in a
patent-infringement case that could have a big impact on consumers and the
nascent Internet telephone industry. Most immediately at risk is the future
of Vonage (VG). Vonage, one of the best-known brands in the Internet phone
world, acknowledged last week that it doesn't have a plan for getting around
use of technology that Verizon (VZ) claims violates patents it owns."

5)  Police needing heavier weapons
USA Today

"Law enforcement agencies across the country have been upgrading their
firepower to deal with what they say is the increasing presence of
high-powered weapons on the streets. Scott Knight, chairman of the Firearms
Committee of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, says an
informal survey of about 20 departments revealed that since 2004 all of the
agencies have either added weapons to officers' patrol units or have
replaced existing weaponry with military-style arms." [editor's note:
Perhaps we need a constitutional amendment limiting each officer to one
revolver, with a shotgun for each car. The main result of police
militarization has been increased police aggression and more innocent deaths

6)  Premier: Czech Republic, Poland favor missile defense
York Dispatch

"Poland and Czech Republic are in favor of hosting a proposed U.S. missile
defense system, the Czech premier said today after meeting with his Polish
counterpart. The United States said last month that it wanted to build a
missile defense system in Eastern Europe to guard the eastern United States
and Europe from missiles launched from 'rogue nations' in the Middle East.
It would be the first such site in Europe." (02/19/07)

7)  Rice: US has doubts on Iraq democracy
Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel

"Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told Iraqi government leaders Saturday
that the contentious debate in Washington over President Bush's war strategy
reflects U.S. doubts that democracy will prevail over violence. 'Some of the
debate in Washington is in fact indicative of the concerns that some of the
American people have ... if the Iraqi government doesn't do what it has said
it will do,' Rice said she told leaders from all of Iraq's factions."

"Republican presidential candidate John McCain said Monday the war in Iraq
has been mismanaged for years and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
will be remembered as one of the worst in history. 'We are paying a very
heavy price for the mismanagement -- that's the kindest word I can give you
-- of Donald Rumsfeld, of this war,' the Arizona senator told an overflow
crowd of more than 800 ..." (02/19/07)

9)  Some Democrats want to modify 2002 Iraq war authorization
CNN

"The 2002 authorization for use of force in Iraq is among the arguments the
war's supporters use to condemn congressional critics of the conflict. If
Democrats have their way, it may be replaced. Democratic senators are
talking Monday about revising the authorization Congress passed more than
four years ago. They would do so by working to pass a new resolution putting
additional restrictions on military action in Iraq." (02/19/07)

"Somalia's government has formed an anti-terror unit trained by Ethiopian
troops to quell growing unrest in the capital and a senior defense official
said it went into operation on Monday. Two Ethiopian military bases in
Somalia came under mortar attack late Monday, local residents said. The
troops returned fire, hitting a residential area in southern Mogadishu and
killing three people, said clan elder Mohamed Abdi Farah." (02/19/07)

11) Information, please
Washington Post

"Deep inside the Library of Congress, 500 researchers pound out the secret
intelligence Congress uses to make law. Legislators request 6,000
Congressional Research Service reports a year, on weapons systems and farm
subsidies, prescription prices and energy use. Together, they offer what
lobbyists and industry want most: clues to what's next on the Hill. For
years, open-government groups have fought to make the reports public, and
for years, many lawmakers have kept them under wraps. Or so they thought. By
insisting on secrecy, Congress instead created a bootleg market for the
research. Every day, a small Texas company compiles the reports and sells
them to lobbyists, lawyers and others who pay thousands of dollars for a
peek at the reports and what they say about the congressional agenda. And
it's all legal." (02/19/07)

12) North Korea: Kim orders Japanese cars seized
Yonhap News

"North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has ordered most Japanese cars in the
communist country seized in a sign of his growing discontent with Japan
imposing severe sanctions after the North's detonation of a nuclear bomb
last October, informed sources said Monday. 'After he paid tribute to the
Kumsusan Memorial Palace on Jan. 1, he saw a Japanese car that wasn't
working blocking the road and gave a National Defense Committee edict to
seize Japanese cars,' a source familiar with the North Korean situation
said, asking to remain anonymous." (02/19/07)

13) UK: Great-granny's sweeteners spark drugs probe
Ananova [UK]

"Police questioned a great-grandmother about drugs after they found
artificial sweeteners in her purse. Former magistrate Marilyn Gordon, 72,
from South Shields, was quizzed after officers became suspicious. They were
also suspicious about credit card fraud when they found the Sunday school
teacher was carrying a card in someone else's name. Her daughter Fiona
Smith, 44, told the Sunday Sun her mother went to the police station after
losing her purse while shopping in South Shields. She said: 'To her surprise
someone had been kind enough to hand it in to lost property -- but that was
when her trouble began.' Officers began to ask her about the white tablets
in her purse." (02/19/07)

14) Anglicans sanction US churches
Guardian [UK]

"The archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, kept the worldwide Anglican
communion together, at least in the short term, but at the cost of imposing
unprecedented sanctions on the US Episcopal church to force it to abandon
its liberal policies towards gay people. A communique issued late last night
after a fraught five-day meeting in Tanzania of the primates -- archbishops
and presiding bishops of Anglicanism's 38 provinces -- laid new ground rules
for the US church and gave it until September 30 to comply. The plan allows,
effectively, for the setting up of a church within a church in the US with
the appointment of a senior cleric to oversee dioceses which feel unable to
accept the Episcopal church's liberal leadership." (02/20/07)

has been arrested on suspicion of spying, prompting fears for her welfare.
Sarah Wykes, a campaigner for the human rights group Global Witness,
appeared in court yesterday after being taken from her hotel by armed police
in the early hours of Sunday in the oil-rich province of Cabinda. Dr Wykes

of the region's mineral wealth. Her legal team were denied entry to the
court in the highly sensitive region that supplies more than half of
Angola's 1.4 million barrels of oil produced a day." (02/20/07)

16) UK: Customers see red over illegal charges
Independent [UK]

"Britain's biggest banks are facing an unprecedented people's revolt as
millions of ordinary customers prepare to claim back illegal charges.
Internet-based campaigners plan to use the annual bank profits reporting
season, which takes place over the next fortnight, to trigger a massive
round of complaints about unauthorised overdraft charges. Martin Lewis, the
founder of the campaigning internet site Moneysavingexpert.com, said: 'For
years, all the high street banks have routinely ripped off millions of
customers and now they are going to pay the penalty.' Thousands of customers
have already won compensation since an Office of Fair Trading ruling last
April, which caused panic among leading banks. The OFT said penalty charges
in the credit card industry were illegal and warned it would investigate
almost identical fees levied by banks." (02/20/07)

"A handful of states are taking a new look at an old, often-criticized
business tax to thwart what they say are too many companies avoiding their
fair share of taxes. The states also hope to increase revenue to improve
schools, create jobs, provide health care for the poor and pay for other
essentials of government spending. Kentucky, Texas and Ohio are the latest
to adopt versions of the tax on companies' sales or profits, levied at a
very low rate meant to apply to as broad a swath of corporate earnings as
possible. Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm has also proposed a version as
part of a tax system overhaul." (02/17/07)

21) Obama's candidacy sparks debates on race
San Francisco Chronicle

"People across the political and racial spectrums started discussing
presidential candidate and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama's race after he spoke
at the 2004 Democratic National Convention. Some insist he is not African
American and is unsuited to be a black candidate, because he is not a direct
descendant of slaves and hasn't had what they see as an authentic African
American experience. Obama, who will speak in San Francisco tonight at a
fundraiser for Sen. Barbara Boxer, identifies as black. But he doesn't fit
the stereotype of a black leader, a church-based fighter for civil rights.
He was president of the Harvard Law Review. He is the son of a Kenyan
immigrant, his father, and a white Kansas native, his mother. He has many
white supporters. And he is running to win, not just to fix black America."

22) TN: State's presidential primary could be moved up
Nashville City Paper

"Tennessee Democrats and Republicans are working together on a political
topic they actually agree on -– moving the state's presidential primary up
on the calendar so Tennessee can be a factor in the 2008 election. Chairmen
of both the state Democratic and Republican parties want to move the primary
up one week so the state will play a bigger role in who receives their
party's nomination, joining a national growing trend among U.S. states.
Currently, Tennessee's presidential primary is scheduled for Feb. 12, 2008.
Bob Davis, the chairman of the state Republican Party, and Gray Sasser the
chairman of the state Democratic Party, would like it held Feb. 5 instead.
... If Tennessee moved its primary up to Feb. 5, it would join a growing
list of nine states -- including neighboring Alabama, Arkansas, Missouri and
North Carolina -- having their primary on that date." [editor's note: So

Christian Science Monitor

"Call it JetBlue's Valentine's Day debacle. And it's now prompting the
question: Is it time for a passenger bill of rights? Caught by frigid, icy
weather and bad airline planning, some JetBlue passengers ended up spending
as many as 11 hours trapped on planes on a frozen tarmac in New York. ... In
December, a similar scene played out as thousands of American Airlines
passengers had to endure tarmac sits as long as eight hours because of
thunderstorms. These two incidents have prompted outraged passengers and
lawmakers like Sen. Barbara Boxer (D) of California to call for legislation
that would require airlines to allow passengers to deplane after three
hours, among other things. 'No one should be held hostage on an aircraft
when clearly they can find a way to get people off safely,' Senator Boxer
said in a statement posted on her website." [editor's note: Oh, Good Lord
... Folks, WEATHER happens, and when it does, delays ensue. There's some
good in allowing for deplaning (then MAYBE having to take another flight?),
but ... terming it a need for a "fliers' bill of rights" (and getting Boxer
involved) is flat-out stupid! - SAT] (02/19/07)

former advocate of gun control, Romney during his 1994 run for the US Senate
backed measures the gun-rights group opposed, such as a five-day waiting
period on gun sales and a ban on certain assault weapons. ... Spokesman
Kevin Madden said Romney did not join the NRA just to court gun owners, who
are considered a force in Republican primary politics. 'He joined the NRA
because, like millions of Americans, he supports the group's advocacy of the
Second Amendment and its commitment to education programs promoting the safe
use of firearms by law-abiding gun owners,' Madden said." [editor's note:

"Ah -- the media war. Until now we thought the war meant those cluster bombs
going off in Baghdad. But we realize we were mistaken. It must have been the
blood that got us confused! The real war we now see is on the front pages.
Take cover! The pen pushers are no longer making obscure marks on paper as
before. No, they have joined Rommel and Patton. Left and right, they load up
their muzzles with dangling modifiers and prepositional clauses and go in
like gangbusters. With every well-turned phrase and pithy bon mot, the
borders of the empire are pushed further along. In the old days, you at
least had to have an arm or leg shot out from under you to corner such
glory. But no more. That is the monumental conceit of it all. The fact is,
the average reporter today knows less than ever about what happens on the
battle-field." (02/07)

"Why would someone think the U.S. military can prevail in any and every

military power cannot 'win' because those situations are not essentially
military in nature. Iraq appears to be such situation. It is a country with
deep-seated, multidimensional sectarian and political conflicts. If we
define 'win' in some constructive way, how can a U.S. force, ham-handed and
oblivious to the subtleties of the local cultures, possibly win?" (02/19/07)

"The lie of security makes all other lies possible. If the state is the

centuries of interventions and taxes, while the church has been emasculated

by Peter Hannaford

"Karl Rove says the presidential campaigns are beginning way too soon; that
the candidates will soon outwear their welcome. That would have been true a
few years ago, but not now. Take 1976, for example. In November 1975, Ronald
Reagan announced his intention to challenge Gerald Ford for the Republican
nomination. That was six weeks before the actual campaign would begin in
January 1976. His 'exploratory' committee had been formed six months
earlier. The campaign was intense right up to the convention in July and
that convention was the last of either party to be truly contested."

Congressman stands behind the point he was making, which was an open call to
execute members of Congress who disagree with him. To anyone who gives a
damn about freedom, or cares in the slightest about any of the principles
America allegedly stands for, Rep Young's call for executions ought to be

with the full consent of Congress. Oh, we will not preemptively attack. No.
Instead, we will respond to an Iranian provocation which is all but

Rebirth of Reason
by Tibor R. Machan

"False alternatives are often presented as if there is nothing else to
choose -- like, love me or hate me, or being kind or mean. But in most cases
there are many other options. Throughout the history of ideas there has been
a false alternative that's been paraded before us, that of human beings as
either naturally, innately good or evil. In modern philosophy the two
positions are represented by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Thomas Hobbes. For
Rousseau we are all born good but then get corrupted by society. According
to Hobbes we are all driven by dark motives, mostly fear of death, to seek
power over nature and others." (02/19/07)

42) So help us Darwin
National Review
by William F. Buckley, Jr.

"An intimidatingly learned colleague has written to a few friends to deplore
the latest bulletin on Senator John McCain, who is of course running for
president. The news is that McCain has agreed to speak at a luncheon hosted
by the Discovery Institute in Seattle. What offends my friend is that the
think tank in question supports the concept of Intelligent Design. And the
question raised -- believe it or not -- is whether such a latitudinarian
thinker should be thought qualified to be president of the United States.
... The questions are profound, and the arguments subtle. It is not
reasonably expected of Senator McCain, or any other contender for the
presidency, that in his public appearances he will explicate all the
conundrums. But the intelligent liberal community should not impose on
anyone a requirement of believing that there is only the single, materialist
word on the subject, and that only contempt is merited by those who consent
to appear at think tanks composed of men and women prepared to explore
ultimate questions, which certainly include the question, Did God have a
hand in creating all of this? Including the great messes we live with?"

45) Feeding the guerillas
The American Conservative
by Martin Sieff

"U.S. policymakers are finally paying lip service to the idea that the Sunni
insurgents in Iraq are indeed waging a full-scale guerrilla war against
American forces. The trouble is that this conception of the Iraq conflict
has been obsolete ever since Sunni insurgents bombed the al-Askariya Mosque
in Samara on Feb. 22, 2006. Shi'ite militias across Iraq, and especially in
Baghdad, responded with a savage wave of random killings in reprisal. That
was the key moment when the Iraq conflict metastasized into a sectarian
civil war between the entire Sunni and Shi'ite communities. It is not even a
'clean' or simple civil war, for it involves conflicts between rival warring
militias within each community. Yet none of the 1,500 overpaid civilian
analysts in the U.S. Department of Defense have yet awakened to this truth:
paramilitary militias in both communities provide the only effective
government in Iraq." (02/12/07)

46) 737 US military bases = global empire
AlterNet
by Chalmers Johnson

Excerpt from Nemesis: The Last Days of the American Republic: "Once upon a
time, you could trace the spread of imperialism by counting up colonies.
America's version of the colony is the military base; and by following the
changing politics of global basing, one can learn much about our ever more
all-encompassing imperial 'footprint' and the militarism that grows with it.
It is not easy, however, to assess the size or exact value of our empire of
bases. Official records available to the public on these subjects are
misleading, although instructive. According to the Defense Department's
annual inventories from 2002 to 2005 of real property it owns around the
world, the Base Structure Report, there has been an immense churning in the
numbers of installations. The total of America's military bases in other
people's countries in 2005, according to official sources, was 737."

47) Kucinich comes back for '08

"To his supporters, Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio) represents the sane voice
of the Democratic Party -- a man who reads books, gives intelligent speeches
and acts on principle. To his detractors, Kucinich is a small man on an ego
trip, too radical to be elected. Kucinich was the only Democratic candidate
in the 2004 presidential primaries to vote against the war in Iraq. His
90-day plan to end the occupation was dismissed by the party's centrist
leaders and he came in fourth in the primaries -- behind Kerry, Edwards and
Dean. Three years later, the Iraq war has cost the lives of more than 3,000
American servicemen and untold thousands of Iraqis. And once again Kucinich,
relentless in his call for withdrawing troops, is vying for the nation's top
job." [editor's note: Interview follows - SAT] (02/19/07)

The House and Senate Democratic leadership sees an opportunity to win a

deals. On Wednesday, at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee,
chairman Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat, warmly welcomed U.S. Trade
Ambassador Susan Schwab. ... But many other Democrats in Congress are not
pleased. They see echoes of past trade deals such as NAFTA, whose language

General Pervez Musharraf. It is now up to Congress to force administration
action by conditioning further U S economic and military aid to the
Musharraf regime on definitive measures by Pakistan to shut down Taliban
bases in its territory. The House took a step in this direction in its
recent omnibus Homeland Security legislation. ... But the bill left a
glaring loophole: The president can waive the ban if he certifies that 'it
is important to the national security interest of the United States to do
so.'" (02/19/07)

"What's the point of a non-binding resolution that the president has already
said would not affect his decisions? How do you send a message to a person
who isn't listening? The resolution affirming support for the troops and
opposition to the surge won't really do anything, notwithstanding the heated
debate about whether to pass it. It won't stop the war, save a life, or slow
the surge. Nancy Pelosi says the president can't completely ignore 'the
voice of the American people,' but my bet is he'll try. The reason the
resolution matters is not because of its impact on the president, but on
Congress; not because it will goad the president into action, but because it
will force Congress to face its own fears." (02/18/07)

Jan. 23, leaving his imprint on the annals of conspiracy. ... Mr. Hunt
assembled a team of mainly Cuban exiles whom he had commanded in the CIA's
disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. To motivate them, he told
them that the mission was to unearth evidence of Fidel Castro's bankrolling
of George McGovern's campaign. The theory was that such documents might be
found in the files of the DNC. This was the cover story. The real reason for
the DNC operation may have been that President Nixon had accepted illegal
campaign contributions from the eccentric industrialist Howard Hughes and
later learned that a consultant of Mr. Hughes, Lawrence O'Brien, had become
chairman of the DNC." (02/19/07)
