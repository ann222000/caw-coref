I respect Jeff a lot as a racer.  Don't necessarily like him, but have a
great respect for his abilities.  However, he couldn't be more wrong
complaining about the 'erased lead'.  The main goal of the Chase was to
create a 'playoff system', much like the NFL - in fact, to compete directly
against the NFL during the final months of the Nascar season when audiences
would tune out to Nascar and tune in to the NFL if the eventual cup champ
had the championship pretty much 'locked up'.

If Nascar truly wanted a playoff system, then all bets should be off once
the playoffs begin - just like the NFL.  As we all know, you can go 15-1 in
the NFL regular season, and lose to an 8-8 wildcard team in your first
playoff appearance.  Personally, I don't like the chase, but if Nascar
really wants a playoff system, then make it a damn playoff system and let
the best drivers fight it out on equal ground, just like the NFL.

I said it before and I will say it again.  The idea of equalizing the points
for an arbitrary number of drivers was a terribly unfair idea.  It would
have been much more palatable to Jeff Gordon and a great majority of the
fans if NASCAR had simply announced that they were going to double the
traditional points award for the last ten races and call it The Chase.  That
would have added drama and would have given many of the trailing drivers a
way to catch up if they outraced the leading drivers. Admittedly the tenth
place driver who was 400 points back was unlikely to catch the first place
driver but he could certainly improve his position from tenth to fifth if he
raced well towards the end of the season.

The main goal of the Chase is to subsidize points for mediocre drivers.
Let's call a spade a spade.  NASCAR wants a playoff system without the
playoff format.  Their greed would never allow them to keep the rest of
the field off the track for the last ten races.  There's too many
advertising dollars riding on those cars.

Bowyer got a 572 point gift from NASCAR at the end of race #25 and now
he gets lucky and wins the first Chase race (and his first period) and
is now 15 points out of first place.  If this doesn't prove NASCAR is
promoting mediocrity then nothing will.  This guy shouldn't even be in
the Chase (i.e. he was 637 points out of first) and now he is 15 points
out of first.  What a joke.

You didn't understand his point. Listen to him again....
He says that there should be a reward for the points champ. going into the chase.
Something a little more than what is awarded for winning just one race.
It's a litle more difficult to lead points after 26 races than it is to win any one race.
That's not whining BTW.

&gt; The Chase *is* the Earnhardt point system. Part of it's purpose was to
help
&gt; Junior win a championship.

&gt; And now that he missed out again, plus JG crying about his &quot;erased lead&quot;,
&gt; Nascar is sure to &quot;fix&quot; the point system again. If they keep changing it,
&gt; they will expose their agenda to everyone and the championship will become
&gt; completely meaningless.

Since &quot;The Chase&quot; came to Na$car, the championship *is* meaningless.

You have an odd definition of &quot;whining.&quot;

&quot;If I didn't know what the rules were going into the season, I'd say
we got the shaft,&quot; Gordon said. &quot;But that's not the case. Ever since
they've had the Chase, they've said what it is. This year they made
the change to the 10 bonus points. It made the regular season more
exciting. It made everybody push harder to get those wins. It did what
it was supposed to do. But I do think they're going to have to revisit
now, going back. If you're going to have incentives for guys to win
races, you have to have some kind of incentive for a guy to go out
there and be the points leader at that point. I wouldn't be surprised
if they revisit that a little bit.&quot;

I call this asking Nascar to take a look at a tweak - something
they've already done at least once, with the Chase.

Face it:  You don't want to read anything or see anything about JG, so
you call every remark whining, no matter how thoughtful or credible
his comments are.

And, as a matter of fact, tweaking the pre-Chase credit IS on the
agenda for off-season Nascar conversations.  Like it or not, Nascar
does listen to its top drivers.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I respect Jeff a lot as a racer.  Don't necessarily like him, but have a great respect for his
&gt; &gt;&gt; abilities.  However, he couldn't be more wrong complaining about the 'erased lead'.  The main
&gt; &gt;&gt; goal of the Chase was to create a 'playoff system', much like the NFL - in fact, to compete
&gt; &gt;&gt; directly against the NFL during the final months of the Nascar season when audiences would tune
&gt; &gt;&gt; out to Nascar and tune in to the NFL if the eventual cup champ had the championship pretty much
&gt; &gt;&gt; 'locked up'.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If Nascar truly wanted a playoff system, then all bets should be off once the playoffs begin -
&gt; &gt;&gt; just like the NFL.  As we all know, you can go 15-1 in the NFL regular season, and lose to an 8-8
&gt; &gt;&gt; wildcard team in your first playoff appearance.  Personally, I don't like the chase, but if
&gt; &gt;&gt; Nascar really wants a playoff system, then make it a damn playoff system and let the best drivers
&gt; &gt;&gt; fight it out on equal ground, just like the NFL.

&gt; &gt; The main goal of the Chase is to subsidize points for mediocre drivers. Let's call a spade a
&gt; &gt; spade.  NASCAR wants a playoff system without the playoff format.  Their greed would never allow
&gt; &gt; them to keep the rest of the field off the track for the last ten races.  There's too many
&gt; &gt; advertising dollars riding on those cars.

&gt; &gt; Bowyer got a 572 point gift from NASCAR at the end of race #25 and now he gets lucky and wins the
&gt; &gt; first Chase race (and his first period) and is now 15 points out of first place.  If this doesn't
&gt; &gt; prove NASCAR is promoting mediocrity then nothing will.  This guy shouldn't even be in the Chase
&gt; &gt; (i.e. he was 637 points out of first) and now he is 15 points out of first.  What a joke.

&gt; You will definitely hear some serious WHINING if Bowyer edges out Jeff Gordon for the Cup by a only
&gt; 5 points this year. ;-)

And 2 weeks ago he got outdrawn by a tape delayed UFC.

(Ultimate Fighting Championship)

Tuesday, September 11, 2007
by Sherdog.com Staff

UFC 75 was the most watched mixed martial arts event ever in North
America, drawing 4.7 million viewers, Spike TV officials said in a
news release Tuesday.

The Sept. 8 event from the O2 Arena in London, England, featured UFC
light heavyweight champion Quinton Jackson in a title unification
bout. Airing delayed on Spike, the telecast peaked at 5.6 million
viewers during Jackson's battle against Henderson.

The show's ratings were particularly strong among men age 18-34 and
men 18-49. For those audiences, UFC 75 beat everything on television,
Spike officials said, including ABC's NASCAR race and Michigan vs.
Oregon college football game, as well as ESPN's Virginia Tech vs. LSU
and Notre Dame vs. Penn St. games.

In the NFL, the team with the best record during the regular season gets

Different ERA I think.  Back then, Rusty, Dale E, could talk in Nascar's ear
(and Nascar went to them) and at least get their attention.

Today?  I don't really think there are any drivers with the same level of

will go to owners now, were before, it was the veteran driver.

&gt; &gt;&gt; execs that just paid a boat load of cash to cover a

&gt; &gt; You may be right - I was thinking of the pre-Brian France days, when
&gt; &gt; Dale Sr., Rusty and JG, among others, had the respect of Bill France
&gt; &gt; Jr., who would listen to what they had to say about the state of
&gt; &gt; NASCAR.

&gt; Different ERA I think.  Back then, Rusty, Dale E, could talk in Nascar's ear
&gt; (and Nascar went to them) and at least get their attention.

&gt; Today?  I don't really think there are any drivers with the same level of
&gt; respect, or whatever you want to call it (maybe power).  I think now, Nascar
&gt; will go to owners now, were before, it was the veteran driver.

Now I don't really think they would pay much attention to anyone.  Big
Bill and Bill Jr did listen on occasion, but it really wasn't that
common either.  Dale Sr.  tried his best to get the plates off and the
fans back, and they ignored him for years. They ignored a whole lot of
drivers that thought Talladega was unsafe at its opening.  It wasn't
just one or two.  It was a large percentage of the field and many
refused to race.  Those that did were banned for life.  Some were let
back in the sport, Richard Petty for one, (hmmm I wonder why) but many
never were.  It was money that drove them then, just as it does now.

That's a very good idea which also goes along with the Chasers should have
the first 12 starting positions during the Chase. Give them the pit stall
selection for each Chase race according to where they finished the season
and let them qualify for each of the first 12 starting spots. At least
there's a somewhat decent reward &amp; incentive to finishing the &quot;regular
season&quot; in the best position possible, and there's a lessened chance of
being taken out in a big-one by non-Chasers (at least at the beginning of
the race).

Add some points to separate the Chasers (more than the measly 5
originally), keep the &quot;win&quot; bonus structure, and the Chase could turn out
to be a fair, worthwhile, entertaining, and dare I say - exciting...
endeavor. Now, what are the odds the idiots at NASCAR will identify,
approve, and implement such &quot;tweaks&quot; before too much damage to the sport
is done?

At one time the defending champion got first pit selection.  It wasn't
that long ago.  I think the idea stinks though.  If you run the rest
of the year with the qualifying times deciding the pit selection order
(which I think is fair) then it should stay that way throughout the
year.

If you are going to have a playoff get the also rans off the track or
get rid of the play off.  Neither will happen.

The chase is just Nascar's version of college football's BCS.  Both
could be described very accurately using 2 of the 3 letters of BCS.
You can figure out which two.

I believe it was done in the Gordon era.  Anything in the Gordon era
to me isn't that long ago considering I grew up watching Nascar clips
on ABC Wide World of sports.  In my late 40's that gives me close to
40 years as a Nascar fan, and now an almost ex Nascar fan.  Everyone
turn off their sets till the chase is gone, the locked in 35 is
history, the COT is made to drive worth a flip

There are benefits given to those teams placing first at the end of the
regular season such as home field advantage, four home games in a best
of seven series etc.  What did Gordon get for his 300+ point lead?  No
much, IMO, unless you consider being 20 points out of first place
sufficient.  I don't.

Also, trying to equate a racing series to other sports' playoff seasons
is not possible.  Those sports send the non-playoff teams to the locker
room for post season.  All 43 drivers are still on the track in NASCAR's
so called post season of which 33 have nothing much to lose from running
a Chase driver into the wall.  For those 33 drivers and teams it is a
ten race long test session for the next season.  If NASCAR wants a
playoff format then let the Chase drivers on the track by themselves.
We know NASCAR's greed won't allow that to happen.

BTW, it is a joke when a driver that is 637 points out of first can be
15 points out of first IN ONE RACE.  NASCAR is subsidizing mediocrity
and it makes for piss poor entertainment, IMO.  From the ratings drop
they are seeing again this year I think there are quite a few others
that share my view.

There is no reason NASCAR can't come up with a points structure that
accomplishes something similar to what they want and have that system be
the same for every race all season long.  Points subsidies are a
horrible idea and if they are smart we won't see this crazy welfare
based points system again next year.  If it is still in place I won't be
going out of my way to watch many races.

We watch sports, in general, to admire the athletes' skill to play the
game.  We like to see the participants advance their skills from season
to season and generation to generation.  Each sport has a structure that
nurtures this concept and rewards skill and consistency much more than
luck.  It makes the outcomes fair and respectable, for the most part,
and provides a consistency to compare current players to ones from the
past.  NASCAR is flying in the face of this basic principle by using the
current points system.  They are leveling the playing field for the last
ten races to the point luck is becoming just as important as skill in
determining a season points champion.

I don't want to see a driver &quot;luck&quot; his way into being a points
champion, even if it is my favorite driver.  I want the championship to
be EARNED from a full season of racing by the BEST driver.  Not one that
can be 700+ points out of first and then miraculously string together a
luck based ten race run and win by a handful of points.  If that
driver/team had the necessary skill to EARN a championship he wouldn't
be 700+ points out of first after 26 races.  It's the equivalent of
running track and field events by giving mediocre runners huge head
starts over the more skilled ones.  Where's the entertainment in that?

I pretty much agree with everything you said....  now if things were
left as they were and a driver is some 600 points in the lead, how much
interest is there in the last 10 races of the season when you already
know who is going to be champion?   By the time you get to the last 2-3
races it is a waste of time to watch, because definately by that time
95% of the time it is meaningless in the standings.

&gt;&gt;&gt; every sport erases points leads when the playoffs start.  It might

&gt;&gt;&gt; amount of points they get for winning... it's huge.  Do they complain?

&gt;&gt; There are benefits given to those teams placing first at the end of

&gt;&gt; lead?  No much, IMO, unless you consider being 20 points out of first
&gt;&gt; place sufficient.  I don't.

&gt;&gt; Also, trying to equate a racing series to other sports' playoff
&gt;&gt; seasons is not possible.  Those sports send the non-playoff teams to
&gt;&gt; the locker room for post season.  All 43 drivers are still on the
&gt;&gt; track in NASCAR's so called post season of which 33 have nothing much
&gt;&gt; to lose from running a Chase driver into the wall.  For those 33
&gt;&gt; drivers and teams it is a ten race long test session for the next
&gt;&gt; season.  If NASCAR wants a playoff format then let the Chase drivers
&gt;&gt; on the track by themselves. We know NASCAR's greed won't allow that to
&gt;&gt; happen.

&gt;&gt; BTW, it is a joke when a driver that is 637 points out of first can be
&gt;&gt; 15 points out of first IN ONE RACE.  NASCAR is subsidizing mediocrity
&gt;&gt; and it makes for piss poor entertainment, IMO.  From the ratings drop
&gt;&gt; they are seeing again this year I think there are quite a few others
&gt;&gt; that share my view.

&gt;&gt; There is no reason NASCAR can't come up with a points structure that
&gt;&gt; accomplishes something similar to what they want and have that system
&gt;&gt; be the same for every race all season long.  Points subsidies are a
&gt;&gt; horrible idea and if they are smart we won't see this crazy welfare
&gt;&gt; based points system again next year.  If it is still in place I won't
&gt;&gt; be going out of my way to watch many races.

&gt; I pretty much agree with everything you said....  now if things were
&gt; left as they were and a driver is some 600 points in the lead, how much
&gt; interest is there in the last 10 races of the season when you already
&gt; know who is going to be champion?   By the time you get to the last 2-3
&gt; races it is a waste of time to watch, because definately by that time

I guess NASCAR needs to decide if skill is going to matter for much in
the sport.  I would rather see a driver EARN a champion with a 600 point
lead than luck his way into one with a one point lead.  Besides, NASCAR
can can weigh the points any way they like as far as I am concerned.  I
just want it to be the same from one race to the next for the entire
season.  What they have now is far to arbitrary, IMO, the the most
skilled and consistent driver for the season won't necessarily be the
points champion.

Yes, Kurt Bush in 2004.  He was 296 points behind Jimmie Johnson at the
end of race #26 and  was 30 points out of first at the beginning of race
#27.  Then he won the points championship by 8 points in race #36
through dumb luck.  Some may call that good racing.  He received a gift
from the NASCAR Gods.  Funny that this is about when NASCAR's ratings
started falling.  Coincidence?  I think not.

Whatever happened to the initial reasoning that created the Chase system anyway?
According to NASCAR, fans don't really care about who's going to be the season champion. They only
care about who wins the most races. Hence the outcry for more  points to winners.
Why should the fans be concerned if someone has a big points lead at the end of the year.
Winning is all that matters. Correct?
Fans will still be interested to watch the late season races in hopes of watching their driver win
them.
Are Jr fans walking away now because they know that Jr won't be champ this year?
I don't think so.

Yes, blind luck was a major factor in his fluke Cup.
The exact thing most fans don't want to see as a deciding factor.
They hate it when bad luck kills a drivers chance at winning a race or a championship.
They should also hate it just as badly when a driver wins it only due to good luck.

No it wasn't. More often than not at least at some level there was a
chance at the last race for a lead to change.  Even if their wasn't
there was still a race to be run which was reason enough to watch in
its own right.  One of the 24 titles had Rick Hendrick over the wall I
think cleaning a windshield.  Others were changing tires that had
always wanted to do it.  They got their chance.   IF it does work out
that way and the title is clinched, its time to congratulate them for
a great season and celebrate the memories of the great job they did
through out the year.  Then when real competion creates those
wonderful finishes, its special because it doesn't happen every year.
I remember a while back there were a few guys running for a title.
Bill Elliott needed to win the race, but he also needed help.  Bill
did win the race in Atlanta, but he didn't win the title.  Two others
guys were battling back and forth.  One might have won it, but got
taken out in a wreck that was not of his making.  The other driver
managed to finish high enough to win the championship.

Funny how things in life work out.  Sadly neither of those title
rivals lived to see the end of the following year.  The champion may
be the last independent owner driver to ever win the title with the
way Nascar is going now.  When the other driver lost his life, it
wasn't that long before the driver that wrecked collecting him in that
title battle wound up in his car.  As fate would have it, he nearly
lost his life in that car at Michigan.  He was very fortunate.  A
surgeon from a NC hospital was there to help treat him or he likely
would have not survived.  He was working there that day, but he wasn't
employed because of his medical degree.  Had the same situation
happened today, he likely would not be in a position to help, though
his is still at many Nascar races.

Notice I didn't name but one driver.  I probably could have gotten
away without naming him either.  Old timers know exactly who they
are.  New fans would be well served to read up and maybe find out.  It
was a wonderful story with a very sad ending.  Guess what.  They
didn't need the chase .
