Looking at Slackware
This time we are looking at the /var directory

Below is a set of questions they are not a test they are just something to
think about.

What is the /var directory for?

What happens when you run
$ tree -d /var
what is happening when tree says [error opening dir]?
What happens when you run
# du -h --max-depth 1 /var
How much space is being used and where?

If your system did not have /var what would happen? When running? At bootup?

The FHS lists some recommendations for what goes into /var on their website
http://www.pathname.com/fhs/

Why would it be good for Slackware to follow these standards?

Why would it be good for Slackware to not follow these standards?

Does Slackware follow the standard?
If not how?
And if not why would this not impact Slackware?

What is /var/cache used for?
If /var/cache did not exist what would happen to the system?
What programs use /var/cache?

What is /var/lib used for?
If /var/lib did not exist how that impact things?
What programs use /var/lib?

What is /var/lock used for?
What is using /var/lock?

What is /var/log used for?
What is the difference between klogd and syslogd?
Where are those two daemons started?
Do you have logrotate or a similar program installed and running?
Why would you need a program like logrotate?

What is /var/mail used for?
Is /var/mail a directory?
If not what is going on there?

What is /var/run used for?
What sort of programs use /var/run?
What is the purpose of this directory given that we have tools like ps?
Where does the information in /var/run come from?
If you rebooted your system would /var/run have the same information? Why?

What is /var/spool used for?
What happens to the information /var/spool?
How long does the information in /var/spool last?
What sort of programs use /var/spool?

What is the difference between /var/tmp and /tmp?
What data is stored in /var/tmp?
What programs use /var/tmp?

What does the yp in /var/yp stand for?
How is /var/yp used?

Do you have a /var/X11R6 directory on your system?
If so what is it used for?

Do you have a /var/adm directory on your system?
What would be its purpose?

What is nscd?
How does it use /var?

What is /var/empty all about?

How does /var/man work?
How do you access the man pages in there?
Why would there be two sets of man pages?

What other subdirectories are there in /var?
How are they being used?
What would happen if they did not exist?

What do the commands
$ lsof | grep /var
and
# lsof | grep /var
tell you about /var?

That's all for now.
If you have any comments please tell me.

They're not homework questions. A quick glance at them would tell you that,
obviously you can't tell the difference between homework and reality. They
are intended to help make you think but you can't think all you can do is
react.

And to answer any of your further questions.
* Yes I know almost all the answers to those questions.
* The few I don't are actually quite hard to answer.
* I have been in this newsgroup far longer than you. Longer than most
posters here.
* I have been using Slackware since near its beginning, so I know a lot.

And to top it all off you are the most useless person posting on this
newsgroup but not all of usenet. Your knowledge is limited by what you
already know and you are unwilling to learn any more. All you do is post
stupid comments saying thats dumb noob, while in reality it is you that is
dumb because you don't know what you don't know. I know what I don't know
and am not unwilling to admit to what I don't know. I want to learn but all
you want to do is feed off others. I have initiative but you have sloth.

Generally accurate, but don't knock sloth or laziness (both of
which I possess in quantity).  Dan C seems to have a fairly unique
combination of unattractive qualities, combined with an amazing
ability to demonstrate them.  The recommended treatment is to PLONK
him.

If you think that the issues you raised are important, then by all

Going back to the OP, there is a difference with /var/spool/mail.

According to man hier /var/spool/mail no longer exists and is replaced
by /var/mail.  No mention of any symlink, though one exists for other
directories that have moved.  I can see the logic of the symlink, does not
break older software.

I wonder what the benefit is of moving mail out of /var/spool is?  It seems
like a logical place to put it given that news, cron and the print spool
(or at least the lprng one was) are there.

I suppose not being entirely sure where the mail spool is shows how much
simpler it is to get CUPS up and running compared to lprng!

I would tend to think that each subdirectory of /var determines how the data
is stored in it. /var/spool reminds me of a spool of paper, which reminds
me of a queue, which makes me think data is put in there to be later
processed and removed. If you apply that to the way a modern mail
application works, it seems a bit clumsy since you have incoming, outgoing,
etc all stored in mailboxes. And reading the FHS standard it says.

*************************************************************************** **
5.11. /var/mail : User mailbox ?les (optional)
5.11.1. Purpose
The mail spool must be accessible through /var/mail and the mail spool ?les
must take the form &lt;username&gt;.
User mailbox ?les in this location must be stored in the standard UNIX
mailbox format.

Rational !
The logical location for this directory was changed from /var/spool/mail in
order to bring FHS in-line with nearly every UNIX implementation. This
change is important for inter-operability since a single /var/mail is
often shared between multiple hosts and multiple UNIX implementations
(despite NFS locking issues).
It is important to note that there is no requirement to physically move the
mail spool to this location. However, programs and header ?les must be
changed to use /var/mail.
*************************************************************************** **

But they don't mention what other UNIX implementations are using /var/mail.
Their reasoning is different from mine but then I'm only just guessing.

Since when is a lot equal to everything? In that other post I also mentioned
that I know when I don't know. I also mentioned that you just react and
don't think. Are you reacting or are you thinking, do you even know the
difference?

BTW the difference is shown in the way you respond to other people's posts.
If you are not adding anything new to the conversation and are just calling
people names you are definitely not thinking.

Just because you can't read my insult properly I suppose I will have to
explain it to you. See the conjunction AND in that sentence that implies
that the phrase &quot;Your knowledge is limited by what you already know&quot; is
joined to the phrase &quot;you are unwilling to learn any more&quot;. Hence you are
correct that anyones knowledge is limited to what they know but you
misunderstood that I was saying you are limited to that level of knowledge
because &quot;you are unwilling to learn any more&quot;. Does that make sense now?

I made that assumption about you because of the posts you make to this
newsgroup. Maybe if you actually had some sort of control over your posts
instead of being instantly offensive, people would think that you were not
such a jerk and hence not thinking.

I was the one that had a big flame war with +Chiron+ and later I went on and
tried to reform the FAQ system and eliminate the number of FAQ questions in
the newsgroup by posting the FAQ periodically, I also partially wrote the
section on using google and where to find documentation. I am also the
brother of the poster known as Wild Wizard. I also supplied the Cat on a
scanner wallpaper if anyone remembers that. The Cat is named Suki and
currently lives in Sydney and was not harmed by the process at all.

The reason you have not seen me on the newsgroup for ages is that I got
married and moved out of home. This meant I had no easy Internet Access
(Not Cheap in Australia). I also had severe problems with mental illness
which now thank God have been cured by finding the right drug. Since this
cure occurred recently I have been on the path to recovery and still am. I
have enrolled in TAFE to complete my Diploma of IT which I previously
failed due to a combination of two Factors one being getting married right
at the end of the course and the other being the fact that I was only doing
the course to see if my mental illness could be bypassed in the domain of
programming. Since I am now back at TAFE I find I need Internet access and
so have acquired it. Now I find my self back in the AOLS newsgroup again.

However since I have been cured I am not actually the same person I was
before. I still have some lingering symptoms but they are manageable.
Before I was very restricted in what I could do and say but now I am not.
My only real restriction on life is having the time to do things. Thus I
have alloted some time to the improvement of my favorite Linux Distribution
Slackware. I have elected to do this by improving the level of this
newsgroup. I have several reasons for this, one is a Web based system like
LinuxQuestions use too much bandwidth for my poor Internet Account. Another
is that I look at some newsgroup and see a lot of information about the
subject there being discussed and I hope that the same can be done here.

Where did I claim that it was?  Don't try to put words in my mouth.

Why don't you just run along now, and preach about &quot;thinking&quot; to some

you.  In any case, just run along and hush up.

The newsgroup has been doing just fine as it is, and in fact the quality
of discussion had improved rather significantly over the past while.  I
don't think you should make any attempts to &quot;reform&quot; the group: it would
be rather counter-productive and not particularly therapeutic.  Others
have tried, and failed miserably.  You would only be setting yourself up
for similar failure.

Accept the group in its current state, or don't, but don't try to
change it.  It isn't the same group it was when you were here fighting
with others that are long gone.  Changes occur gradually and naturally.
Every time someone shows up wanting to &quot;improve&quot; the newsgroup, it
degenerates into a series of flame-wars and petty name-calling, until
that someone tires of the game and moves on.

When people just show up looking for help, and prepared to offer help,
or in some cases just to rant that the computer did exactly as they
asked it to do, even if it wasn't what they meant to ask it, the group
fulfills its purpose just fine.

If you have material you feel contributes to the newsgroup, great,
welcome back.  If you honestly think you can change the characters on
the group, be prepared to ask for a stronger prescription.  You'll need
it.

Ooops, should have added before sending....

Tats not to say many many many newbie newsmasters who are not aware of

where along the paths.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused now (snipped too much above).

Are we saying that mail, including outgoing and sorted into folders, _after_
being read on the MUA/mail client is normally stored under /var/mail?  By
default kmail picks up mail from /var/mail or /var/spool/mail and stores it
in $HOME/Mail (at least on my system).  However, from the discussion above
it would seem normal to leave it under /var/mail/&lt;user&gt; - doubly so if
using a maildir format (not sure what would happen if using a mbox format).

Hmm, not sure how that would work?  Would I configure kmail with no account
and set it to store mail under /var/mail? Perhaps have play with a test
user account?  Bit confused.

I know it is my system so I can configure it how I damn well like, but it
can be useful to be consistent with everyone else, unless there is reason
not to.

Also of interest that I use procmail so I deliver mail into several mbox
format files in $HOME/procMail - looks like I could deliver it directly
to /var/mail/pete in maildir format.

What do other people do?

If I did move my mail from my home directory to /var/mail/&lt;user&gt; I'd
actually sim link it to my data drive under /mnt/data/mail as I keep all my
data organised, via sym links on a data disk, separate from my system disk.

Well, google seem to honour them on google groups, but of course they don't
propagate.  Ended up having an argument with some guy on another newsgroup
over this matter.  Don't think he was aware that usenet existed outside
google groups and he did not see that he was posting each post of his two
or three times, with minor edits, as he was deleting the ones he didn't
want - to his mind they no longer existed.

I think I started quoting back to him the ones he'd deleted.

Most Unix systems have the MDA deliver users' mail into
/var/spool/mail/${user} in an mbox-format file.  MUAs (for the purpose
of this post, let's say that includes procmail as an MDA, running on
the user's behalf) may or may not move messages into $HOME/Mail (or
$HOME/mail).

I don't know why the folks behind the Linux FHS have to be so

That's your answer to everything. I must have a LOT of relatives!

I've been reading the past few threads where you have been so prolific.
However, I find that you've lost your edge the past five or six months.
You used to be fun (in an odd way) to read, but now its the same old
'smeg&quot; the same old &quot;droid&quot; the same old &quot;bugger.&quot;

I'm wondering if the combination of your lack of imagination coupled
with the constant repetition has lowered your status among the pack of
wild dogs that seek to dominate this newsgroup.

I really have to question whether or not you are still the alpha dog
here. The honor has always gone to the person with the most vulgar,
obscene, foul, bigoted, and xenophobic postings. Indeed it is what makes
the Slackware group so unique, if not entertaining.

As a Linux distro, Slackware is dull as toast.... being the best distro
that 1996 has to offer. But this newsgroup is the exact antithesis of
the distro. And the alpha dog is expected to live up to the the long
tradition of alpha dogs that have come before him (and I say 'him' as I
know of no women who have had the title a alpha bitch.)

So Dan, my request to you is that you work on some new material. Your
insult inventory is rather low at the moment. Your expressions of ire
and desperation are trite and over-used and those who see you as their
leader can only wish what I wish... that you provide us with more
imaginative fare.

You're the alpha dog here. We can expect nothing less.
