Astro Communications Services in San Diego publishes some really great
pamphlet-like books for $4.95.

Two that I think are great are by Maritha Pottenger -- "Juno" and "The
East Point and the Antivertex". There are several others that look very
interesting as well, and one on BMLilith.

I discussed some issues with Pluto. Vertex, and Juno in the other
thread on Solar Returns and I would like people to know -- that you do
not have to buy a glossy covered $15. hard back to get really good
information on Juno in this little booklet by Pottenger.

I am amazed at how the transits like T. Pluto conjunct N. Juno --
presently at 23 Sag and on my Vertex are playing out just as described
in her ACS booklet.

In the past 2-3 years I have found that huge questions about what is
going on with others in relationship with myself (and with themselves),
can be answered by going in depth into a person's chart and using
asteroids and personal points to ferret out issues (past wounds) within
their personality.

People I had given up on and thought may not worth my time became
understandable and lovable through understanding their natal aspects
and transits. So good natal synastry helped me to hang in there and try
to understand them better rather than just keep on walking.

Being a disposable society, there seems frequently an impulse that if
someone does not immediately fullfil emotional *expected* needs to just
move on to the next person until eventually the proper connection is
supposed to be found in someone. This may go on for years depending on
the criteria being used to judge the potential partners. I use synastry
because from having had 2 husbands and reviewing many relationships
(mine and others) both good and bad for 25 years astrological study --
I know synastry does describe the interaction between two people very
well.

I have found that if the basic synastry is excellent between two
people, then astrological study of a chart can hold the key to learning
more what the other person requires and a healing can take place with a
partnership of tolerance and understanding, even if it is somewhat
one-sided. It is basically all about understanding, tolerance of
another's personality (life) issues and love in an unconditional
"erotic" way. Erotic love is *unconditional* by definition.

As Robert Blaschke once said to me during a reading, "Just go ahead and
love him. Can't hurt. Might help."

Hi LL.

I think the BML booklet may be the one by M. Kelley Hunter, which I
understand to be an expansion upon her 1999 article in 'The Mountain
Astrologer'.

If I understand it correctly, Juno is a sort of female Jupiter. Is it
coincidence, then, that tr. Pluto is trining your natal Mars-Jupiter
conjunction? Would this transit not have the same effect in a female chart
as what you ascribe to tr. Pluto conjunct Juno?

Could this not be the result of transiting Saturn through your 11th house
and now in your 12th, where difficult personal issues are finally dealt with
and
allowed to disintegrate? (I'll not mention tr. BML in Cancer at the same
time :-)) ). Saturn rules the 6th house, which is also the house of '
working upon one's self', I understand.
Jupiter's (Juno?) transit through Libra will have been affecting your Cancer
stellium for yonks, AND its 'spiritual'
rulership is your 8th house...personal transitional of that connected with
other people's values ( as opposed your own).

I've said this before, but in one of my astrology books the author says that
sextile aspects can be productive only after the
squares in a chart have worked themselves out.  Like me, you have the UR-PL
sextile in Gemini to Leo. Could this not be working in the non-personal
manner of its intent, after tr. Saturn had finished dealing with the very
personal Cancer square garbage?

This is a definite term of the times we are now living in.  Disposables

So one inwardly  feels 'disconnected' in some way towards another because
the expectations...or illusions... never manifest in form. Sounds a lot like

Are you associating Juno with erotic love?
When thinking of 'erotic love' (love without confining boundaries),  a
Venus-Neptune aspect (with Saturn involvement) comes to mind, whilst Neptune
itself has always referred to unconditional love, I understand. You have a
SA-VE-NE square from Cancer to Libra. Maybe it's that influence and not
Juno?

I'm in no way putting the importance of asteroids aside, yet I do think that
the same answers can be found within the planetary functions if one is
prepared to go deeper into *their* meanings and not only keep to the
familiar ones.
OTOH, maybe the asteroids provide the easy way :-).  Others will most
probably say the same of my study of Black Moon Lilith :-)

Nice to see you contributing to AAM again, LL.

Had to move into the PC with the newsreader rather than Google which I
hate to use because their Beta Google group software handles the levels
of quotes so badly and double sends posts, posts get buried, etc. -- if
they post at all. Very quirky using Google to post and read, IMO.

We have never argued - ever. There is nothing in our synastry to argue
about. Just me trying to please and happy to give him the controls
(totally unlike any other relationship) and that feels very good. I have
to really respect a man's intelligence to turn over the power all to
him. He has a Hi-Dek Merc as do I, but his is higher and that is the
best, IMO.

Well, I do not get the connection of relationship and intimacy issues
with Jupiter because Juno has to do with our feelings and attitudes
toward marriage and the type of partner one is likely to choose. This is
additional info to the 7th house cusp ruler and Moon for a man and Sun
for a woman -- just adds more specific detail.

It is also the marriage license itself -- legal document of partnership.
It has to do with joint resources -- who owns it, who earns it and who
spends it. As well as intense emotional connections as well as our
capacity for committment.

I just do not see bundling all that up with a "female's Jupiter". I did
not know that female Jupiters were different from male Jupiters. Can you
elaborate on the sexual differentiations between male and female Venus,
Mars, whatevers...please?

The benefit of having asteroids to mean essentially very separate and
rather precise things, IMO, is a benefit not having 200 keywords for a
planet like Jupiter. As well as being able to see "exactly" what a
transit is about specifically. I personally do not see any of the Juno
keywords and meanings applying to Jupiter -- unless it is a "govermental
document" which would be Jupiter in Gemini or the 3rd/9th.

I guess to me, it would be like the difference in trying to determine
all the individual items one puts in a pot roast as one eats it. While
served separate on a plate -- a meat, a potato, grilled onions, a salad
with celery and basil, buttered carrots, etc. are all immediately
distingishable (interpretable and obvious IMO) when served individually.
But a bit diffuse to determine in a pot roast.

Saturn through the 11th and my Cancer bundle, I lost everything -- my
company due to the downturn of 911 in publishing, the death of my
mother, and my son went off to college and I was left alone. Very alone
as Saturn travels through my 12th and all my energies had been directed
while in the 11th (Cancer bundle) at keeping us afloat financially and
getting him through high school and into college.

All I have now is an amazing 8th house love/sex/romance partner :) whom
met 13 years ago with an eclipse on my Venus and transiting Jupiter on
my Chiron. T. Chiron was on his Moon at the same time. It is not quite
as close as I would like but it is in "transformation", so...

Do not know know about sextiles except they seem a bit weak, IMO, but
come in handy from time to time when an "opportunity" strikes. Yes, the
Uranus in Gemini trine Moon in Libra (contains my entire chart), both
sextile to Pluto in Leo in the 12th, has been very beneficial, whether
or not my squares are worked through. I also have
Sun//Venus//Mercury//Pluto and those DEKs are powerful!

Cancer "Garbage" is right -- my mother and son left me with a houseful
of garbage, junk, keepsakes and then added to my own -- it has been like
living in Hades (junk, garbage, trash)for 3 years. Little by little I
have been digging it out, selling it, throwing it away and sending it to
Goodwill. It has been a sad period as well and lots of loneliness after
so much extremely busy-responsibility. I have no extended family, so..
and most of my long-time friends are in NYC.

As far as working on myself these past years as Saturn moved through
every planet, I do not know about that. Pluto tring my Mars-Jupiter got
me to the gym, hired a trainer, lost weight, did some cosmetic work,
etc. So looks are not a problem these days and I go to the gym every night.

All I have felt was loss, hardship and worry -- all appropriate to
Saturn transits over everything and the 12th. I am fine the way I am, as
is my lover, and most people are for that matter unless they are cruel.

I just lost most everything (by no fault of mine. -- No, I was not
responsible for my mother's death or 911 and the downturn in the
economy) and do NOT take responsibility for those things, but I need to
begin anew now. I did get my son sent off to college for his benefit and
that was a huge struggle alone.

Saturn will be crossing my Asc. and Jupiter and Uranus will Grand Trine
my Cancer bundle forming a Grand Trine while Pluto trines my Mars conj
Jupiter conjunction on my Asc. here where I live. Neptune is on my Desc.
and I am taking a screenplay class next month for a film contract with
an agent.

The Pluto sitting on my lover's Juno in Sagittarius (married to his
career in civil service law) is in his 2nd house (wants someone one to
provide materially or sensually with comfort and a feeling of ease).

It is also on my Vertex in my 5th house (conjunct T. Pluto now), trining
my Jupiter on my Asc., so it has been a very interesting period since we
connected after a 4 year hiatus. Pluto is also on the IC of our
composite with 23 mutables on all angles and opp the Sun at 23 Gem which
is his N. Merc and my antiscia Venus. Plus my Progressed Moon is 24 Sag
right now also... sooooo.... whaddaya think?

Unfortunately our Progressed Composite Sun and BML are now at 14 Leo
which is also my natal Ascendant. The Prog Comp. Mercury is on my N.
Jupiter and the Prog. Comp. Jupiter is nearly on his Asc at 1 Scorpio (2
Scorpio).

While Comp. Prog. Pluto and Node are on my Mars at 21 Leo which is also
my Sun/Moon, Sun/Venus and Moon/Venus M.P.

Prog. Comp. Juno is 13 Sag trine my N. Asc. and Prog. Comp. Vesta at 7
Cap is opp the Lilith at 7 Cancer which is also my Venus, and where his
Progressed Lilith is also. Lilith in our natal Composite is 8 Leo which
is his N. Moon (my Par of Marriage) and my N. Pluto.

But his Prog. Lilith at 7 Cancer is moving off my Venus finally, thank
goodness. I don't like being a Lilith to someone's Venus. Also his
Progressed Venus = my N. N.Node. And my Prog. Venus = his natal N.Node.
My Vesta = his Pro. Sun and his Pro Vesta = my Moon.

Maybe you can help me with all those Lilith's and what they mean that
are so powerfully connected up between us. I remember nothing possive
about synastry with Lilith.

As you explain it, Juno would have its own set of 'qualities' not found in
any combination of planetary interaction.

Yet if my nitty-gritty side breaks down 'feelings and attitudes + towards
marriage', I'd come up with a planetary combination of Moon to 7th house
ruler. Is it coincidence again that your Moon is conjunct your 7th house
ruler and would this conjunction not also be descriptive of your attitude
towards marriage, which you ascribe to Juno?

Or Juno's chart position just hits the nail on the head more quckly?

Does Juno only apply to marriage attitudes? I assume that not everyone is
going to have Moon to 7th house ruler in their chart. Can it apply to
attitudes towards family relationships, a business career, parenthood,
spiritual life etc.?

{{{ On a public newsgroup}}}?  The AAM censoring machine would reject the

But I obviously didn't express myself adequately. I meant that Juno would
express the same qualities as what is now ascribed to Jupiter. E.g Jupiter
might refer to a judge, teacher, legal administrator (that could be female),
but Juno would refer *only* to a female judge, teacher, administrator. As

I believe there's much in Lilith in a male/female relationship that can
never offer connection and commitment; simply because 'she' represents 'his'
sensual needs, but isn't always ....or doesn't exist as... the person he'd
choose to take home to meet his mother, or introduce to friends, or become
the wife of his children. You know; the 'acceptable' with which one so often
complies. Lilith is often a representation of 'the other woman', that
fulfils the erotic fantasies but is never seen in public places where he is
known on his arm, which position is reserved for the submissive Moon and/or
Venus figure in his life.

'She' (her Lilith) knows how to entrap 'him' by providing and fulfilling
those inner needs but that have very little to do with the reality of his
everyday existence. It depends upon in which sign Lilith is placed as to how
such 'socially unacceptable', yet at the same time natural inner, needs are
activated.
E.G. I found it very interesting that a public figure over here lost his
position and status because his need to visit prostitutes came to light. His
BML was in Scorpio. He was judged for a 'socially unacceptable behaviour
pattern', whilst he was an excellent administrator.

With natal Lilith or transiting Lilith now in Leo, I expect ' inner
strength' and 'total domination' to be a role that is going to be strongly
felt within the period of its transit. The Pluto in Leo generation are going
to be doubly effected because of  the 'identity' factor involved. Saturn's
transit of Leo follows it, so I'd expect to see the 'manifested' results of
such inner strength or domination.

Let's put it this way, of the thousands of charts I have looked at and

between us. I am waiting for his Prog. BML to move off my Venus as it
is doing now and I should be cleared to land in 2006. LOL

You have a very good memory, Christine. :I

Today is his BD!! 5/30/60, 17:11, Phila, PA, and we find a
non-precessed SR with 11 Virgo rising (my Chiron) and Moon 13 Pisces
conjunct Uranus at 11 Pisces and his Sun conjunct Mercury on the MC at
9.5 Gemini which is my Uranus.

My previous 2 marriages have:

(1st marriage)

T. Uranus 9 virgo on my Natal Chiron 12 Virg opp T. Chiron 11 Pisces.
T. Saturn conjunct N. Dsc. and Pluto on my BML and Cupido -- his
familly did not think I was appropriate -- but since he has had 5
marriages thus far as has his brother, maybe NO ONE was appropriate!

(2nd marraige)

T. Uranus 10 Sag opp N. Uranus at 10 Gemini and T. Chiron at 9 Gemini
making a T-square to natal Chiron at 12 Virgo, Saturn on the IC
conjunct P of Fortuna and Pluto at 0 Scorpio trine my Saturn at 1
Cancer.

(July-Sept. 2005)

T. Uranus opp N. Chiron Square N. Uranus and my Juno return at 15
Taurus.  Saturn conjunct my Pluto and Pluto trine my Mars-Jupiter and
Uranus trine my Venus while Neptune parks on my Dsc.

No, I AM not saying that I am getting married under these similar
aspects --  but those issues are definitely being activated especially
as Saturn goes in to conjunct my Pluto and his Moon in my 12th. Saturn
and Uranus rule my 7th and my third marriage would be Gemini on the
11th -- his Sun, etc.

My last husband actually had my Juno return in his 7th house if the
February SR before we married in September 1984.

His  second marriage would be indicated by his natal 9th house where
all my planets are and his BML-conjunct my Mercury is right on that
Placidus cusp.

I have been looking at Placidus cusps a lot in the past two years and
finding within 1 degree orb a power point if a planet lands there. My
astro friend in the UK who studied at the UK Astrological College
extensively, agrees.

&gt; As you explain it, Juno would have its own set of 'qualities' not found in

That is TRUE, so in looking at my previous marriages (2) and many SRs
of marriages of mine and others Juno is prominently placed. It is not
so prominent in the synastry between the people -- Chiron is it seems,
but I need to zero in on Juno more as I have focused more on Chiron.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yet if my nitty-gritty side breaks down 'feelings and attitudes + towards
&gt; marriage', I'd come up with a planetary combination of Moon to 7th house
&gt; ruler. Is it coincidence again that your Moon is conjunct your 7th house
&gt; ruler and would this conjunction not also be descriptive of your attitude
&gt; towards marriage, which you ascribe to Juno?
">

My seventh house rulers are Uranus and Saturn. My Moon in Libra conj
Neptune is trine Uranus and square Saturn. My Moon is Square his BML at
3 Cancer on my Merc and my Saturn is at 1 Cancer nearby his BML. My
Saturn and Mercury are trine his Chiron and conjunct my own Sun 6
Cancer and Venus 7 Cancer trine his Neptune is Scorpio in the 1st. This
is the Conjuncted Grand Trine (my Cancer planets in his 9th) I swing
off his Chiron-BML-Neptune Grand Trine is could be possible that he
finds healing through erotic love.

Ninth house is 2nd marriage -- Taurus ruled 7th house and he was
married at 22 and divorced at 25. He has described 20 years of
difficult relationships one after the other. He has said the last "real
one" was 1999, but it only lasted a little over a year and except for
the 1st 3 months, it was sexless. He said he actually took her to a
music concert once instead of staying at her place all the time when he
was seeing her. So I wonder if BML was involved there as well? He is a
recluse IMO with or without a relationship (Vesta conj Saturn fourth).

I suspect from things he has said, he does not like to be seen in
public much with anyone very much. He said he cannot stand to be
touched at all in public. I read on another group a lot of Gemini's
really hate being physical in public  -- several chimed in and agreed
with that notion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or Juno's chart position just hits the nail on the head more quckly?

Yes, that is MO. It is a direct way to focus on partnership/intimacy
issues because the 7th house is a very wide target including clients
and open enemies.
His Juno in Sag from various books I have here, suggest that his
wife/partner will be "a big boned woman, who is a good
conversationalist" (LOL) or be married to his career or be a priest.
Sounds a lot like him to be honest.

Until I lose another 15 pounds (which he seems to not like me getting
thinner -- says I am NOT fat, but I am "big boned" IMO) and from what I
see, except for a few happy hours after work with co-workers and maybe
a male friend or two.

I remember how small my bones got when I was only 8% body fat.

He is indeed married to his career and lives the life of an ascetic in
an apartment he calls a "train wreck" (full of junk) I suspect. Saturn
conj Vesta in the 4th here --- in the 3rd in Philly -- not close with
brothers or family at all and Saturn conj Vesta in Capricorn can
vacillate between celibacy and austere hermit-like existence -- only
coming out to get needs met (food bought, care washed/gassed, hair-cut,
etc) and if BML is not too busy maybe some affection, loving and
attention and stimuli for his brilliant mind.

It is strictly the *marriage* asteroid and has to do with the title of
this thread solely and the signing of the legal document, if there is
one. The Magi Society has a different bent on Juno and they believe it
to be the "sexual affair" asteroid and Chiron is "married love".

http://www.magisociety.com/juno.htm

I think from my many data charts of marriages divorces etc. Juno is
definitely the marriage itself -- the contract and often paired with
Vesta (vows and sharing of a home through a contract) in a marriage
chart. I have seen it prominent a lot more in the marriage chart and
the SR for the year of marriage than very powerful in the synastry
between long-term couples.

But I have not studied it as much as I have the Chiron synastry
however.

I also belive Juno IS intimacy issues and sexual closeness described in
the natal chart. His Juno (with T. Pluto now) is exactly trine my Mars
and mine is trine his Saturn (2 degs).

The Magi people believe that people only have affairs with Venus-Juno
or Juno-Neptune between them and I cannot disagree with that. It does
seem to take a strong Chiron(s) connection to actually marry.

http://www.magisociety.com/juno/juno.htm

I have found in studying the charts of people in my files and the books
in the Magi Society's recent research -- they seem to be on to
something.

They are simply a publisher and researcher into Chiron primarily out od
NYC (not a weird cult as one silly person suggested to me) as Chiron
seems to be highly connected to marriage and also into making money
with big business. Go figure -- I have found the same thing when
comparing their ideas to what I have in my chart database of couples
and people with a lot of money.

I can look at a person's chart now and see Chiron//Jupiter or
Venus/Chiron and KNOW they are wealthy or if young -- eventually will
be. It has been one of the more amazing recent things I have found in
many years of reading charts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;as what you ascribe to tr. Pluto conjunct Juno?

&gt;&gt;Well, I do not get the connection of relationship and intimacy issues

&gt;&gt;It is also the marriage license itself -- legal document of partnership.

As long as you see them as *issues* regarding marriage and not issues

The Uranus-Chiron aspect yet again. Hope you're not setting yourself up for
sudden pain.

You did not mention that Tr. Neptune on your Descendant is also square the
Juno return, nor that it opposes your Ascendant. You will be willing to
ignore who you are for the sake of a marriage in which you make all the
sacrifices?
I always look out for snakes in the grass or flies in the ointment with a
harsh Neptune aspect.

With transiting BML going through your 12th house, reality may not be as
your fantasy is creating it. It cojoins Pluto and then crosses your Asc. in
September. Hope it'll be the rescuing angel rather than an avenging one :-)

&gt; I have found in studying the charts of people in my files and the books
&gt; in the Magi Society's recent research -- they seem to be on to

That would be an excellent starting point to study in itself. It could

&gt; They are simply a publisher and researcher into Chiron primarily out od

&gt; comparing their ideas to what I have in my chart database of couples

That is a totally new take on Chiron with which I'm unfamiliar, although its
involvement with relationship questions is apparent. As it is beyond the
boundaries of Saturn's earthly manifestation, I have difficulty with the

Jupiter for wealth, o.k.; but Chiron ?
I have a Venus in Taurus 9th to Chiron in Virgo trine. Taurus and Venus =
love of money and/or financial security? But what is the criteria for
'wealth'. Mine is an average
family with no financial strain, yet I wouldn't call us wealthy. My feeling
is that 'money' is there as a means to make life enjoyable...even if
it's only on an ice cone:-)
But what I  do say ALWAYS, is that I am extremely fortunate and blessed.
Good family relationships, plenty of love, many friends,  no worrying health
issues. In that sense I am very rich :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Astro Communications Services in San Diego publishes some really great
&gt; pamphlet-like books for $4.95.

&gt; Two that I think are great are by Maritha Pottenger -- &quot;Juno&quot; and &quot;The
&gt; East Point and the Antivertex&quot;. There are several others that look
&gt; very
&gt; interesting as well, and one on BMLilith.

&gt; I discussed some issues with Pluto. Vertex, and Juno in the other
&gt; thread on Solar Returns and I would like people to know -- that you do
&gt; not have to buy a glossy covered $15. hard back to get really good
&gt; information on Juno in this little booklet by Pottenger.

&gt; I am amazed at how the transits like T. Pluto conjunct N. Juno --
&gt; presently at 23 Sag and on my Vertex are playing out just as described
&gt; in her ACS booklet.

&gt; In the past 2-3 years I have found that huge questions about what is
&gt; going on with others in relationship with myself (and with
&gt; themselves),
&gt; can be answered by going in depth into a person's chart and using
&gt; asteroids and personal points to ferret out issues (past wounds)
&gt; within
&gt; their personality.

&gt; People I had given up on and thought may not worth my time became
&gt; understandable and lovable through understanding their natal aspects
&gt; and transits. So good natal synastry helped me to hang in there and
&gt; try
&gt; to understand them better rather than just keep on walking.

&gt; Being a disposable society, there seems frequently an impulse that if
&gt; someone does not immediately fullfil emotional *expected* needs to
&gt; just
&gt; move on to the next person until eventually the proper connection is
&gt; supposed to be found in someone. This may go on for years depending on
&gt; the criteria being used to judge the potential partners. I use
&gt; synastry
&gt; because from having had 2 husbands and reviewing many relationships
&gt; (mine and others) both good and bad for 25 years astrological study --
&gt; I know synastry does describe the interaction between two people very
&gt; well.

&gt; I have found that if the basic synastry is excellent between two
&gt; people, then astrological study of a chart can hold the key to
&gt; learning
&gt; more what the other person requires and a healing can take place with
&gt; a
&gt; partnership of tolerance and understanding, even if it is somewhat
&gt; one-sided. It is basically all about understanding, tolerance of
&gt; another's personality (life) issues and love in an unconditional
&gt; &quot;erotic&quot; way. Erotic love is *unconditional* by definition.

&gt; As Robert Blaschke once said to me during a reading, &quot;Just go ahead
&gt; and
&gt; love him. Can't hurt. Might help.&quot;

&gt;&gt;My previous 2 marriages have:

&gt;&gt;(1st marriage)

&gt;&gt;T. Uranus 9 virgo on my Natal Chiron 12 Virg opp T. Chiron 11 Pisces.
&gt;&gt;T. Saturn conjunct N. Dsc. and Pluto on my BML and Cupido -- his

&gt; I realise that you are joking, yet the words 'No one', 'No body', 'Nothing'

&gt;&gt;(2nd marraige)

&gt;&gt;T. Uranus 10 Sag opp N. Uranus at 10 Gemini and T. Chiron at 9 Gemini
&gt;&gt;making a T-square to natal Chiron at 12 Virgo, Saturn on the IC
&gt;&gt;conjunct P of Fortuna and Pluto at 0 Scorpio trine my Saturn at 1
&gt;&gt;Cancer.

&gt; No Moon, Venus and Jupiter connections, which I understand to be 'happy
&gt; marriage'.

IMHO personally, marriage is NOT about Jupiter, Moon and Venus -- it is
about Saturn and Uranus -- Aqua 7th house and Saturn ruling the 6th and
Uranus ruling the 10th and in Gemini trine my Moon conj Neptune in the
2nd house of security and desire -- like that. ;)

Working together, sharing conversation and ideas and feeling secure
together financially and emotionally -- Moon in Libra square Saturn is a
bit tough, but by now I am used to it. ;)

In his case it is Venus ruling the 7th (Taurus) and that is in a
T-square to Pluto and Chiron, but my Cancer bundle makes a Grand Trine
with his BML at 3 Can on my Merc as the anchor. LOL

We both have powerful Venus-Pluto progressions in now. And I have natal
Venus, Sun and Mercury // Pluto, so "transformation" is the name of the
game. ;)

It is time to shed our chyrsallis', heal and become a butterflies together!

&gt;&gt;T. Uranus opp N. Chiron Square N. Uranus and my Juno return at 15
&gt;&gt;Taurus.  Saturn conjunct my Pluto and Pluto trine my Mars-Jupiter and
&gt;&gt;Uranus trine my Venus while Neptune parks on my Dsc.

&gt;&gt;No, I AM not saying that I am getting married under these similar
&gt;&gt;aspects --  but those issues are definitely being activated especially
&gt;&gt;as Saturn goes in to conjunct my Pluto and his Moon in my 12th. Saturn
&gt;&gt;and Uranus rule my 7th and my third marriage would be Gemini on the
&gt;&gt;11th -- his Sun, etc.

&gt; As long as you see them as *issues* regarding marriage and not issues
&gt; *regarding* marriage. A slightly different emphasis.
">

Let's put it this way -- every chart I have from our SRs to Major Sec.
Progs w/Venus aspects to SAD MPs to 0 Aries and 22-1/2 shows a marriage
(or cohabitation partenership) coming up for us both in 2006 -- as the
patterns repeat. Since I know that Chiron-Uranus is a powerful key to
marriage and/or cohabitation in my chart -- it will either be him or
someone new and the same goes for him and his chart. We'll both be
hooked up with someone(s). :)

I have studied astrology aspects and patterns for so many years -- they
now play out just like a hand of cards -- they fall in predictable
patterns that if you are good enough at math patterns (cards) or
astrology aspect patterns (I have Pallas conj Merc) you CAN predict the
outcomes fairly easily. That is why some Yale and Harvard math whizzes
are not allowed at the Vegas card tables. :) There are 52 cards and only
so many combinations left possible as the cards fall on the table.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Uranus-Chiron aspect yet again. Hope you're not setting yourself up for
&gt; sudden pain.
">

Relationships always contain some pain, IMHO, so that cannot be avoided.
Goes with the territory unless you have been married for many years --
then it is like an old house slipper. LOL

But no pain - no gain! I know that is for certain. One does not fall in
love and NOT feel pain as in a recent study of neuroscience and the
Journal of Neurophysiology as reported in the NYTimes recently.

It can almost be mistaken for psychosis according to the article. Its
neural profile is like that of hunger, thirst or drug craving. The
feelings that come with it range from euphoria to anger to anxiety.

2,500 brain scans of 17 college students in the first weeks or months of
love -- Univ. of NY at Stonybrook where my favorite cellular biologist
is. He is working on artificial skin for burn victims.

Hot spots are deep in the brain below conscious awareness and in the
caudate nucleus. It is a dopamine thing like bike riding long distance
(he used to do 80 miles a day or more -- now he uses me ;) and it can be
sustained as long as there is "frustration-attraction". So withdraw,
break-up for a month, and come back intensely starved for each other!

Mars in Aries square Saturn in Capricorn loves this anyway -- it is the
Marquis de Sade aspect -- long periods of celibacy (self-stimulation)
followed by a 'breakfast' of over-the-top passion!

You've heard "Love is a drug" -- well, IMO, it definitely is. The issue
with us has been that we can continue this intense, passionate situation
indefinitely as long as we do NOT ever grocery shop together. FOTFLOL

So he controls the timing a lot and then it prevents the passion from
ever diminishing -- always as an element of unrequited desire and
passion that can continue indefinitely as long as we stay in contact
with one another.

relayed it to me. With T. Neptune sitting on my Dsc. and Neptune trine
Venus both ways and my Neptune quincux his Chiron (healer) -- whaddya
think? lOL

I have experienced that Chiron-Uranus is a powerful catalyst for
marriage. My lover married in 1982 when Uranus made a cosmic cross to
his Pluto 3 virg square Venus 3 Gem square Chiron 2 Pisces square T.
Uranus 2 Sag.

Saturn hard to something (often natal Saturn or an angle) usually is
indicated in marriage as well -- Todd and his wife married on their
Saturn return on N. Saturn conj Chiron.

I am not sure if BML can be evaluated alone and like any other planet(s)
without regards to all other planets in the chart.

I use Eclipses and Full moons a lot when watching for a catalyst to a
bunch of powerful aspects.

I have also found it is the planets in hard aspect and in critical
degrees (29-0) which provides the impetus for major events and change.
It is not the Jupiter trines, but the Saturn or Uranus squares and
oppositions that break up the status quo.

&gt;&gt;Ninth house is 2nd marriage -- Taurus ruled 7th house and he was

&gt;&gt;difficult relationships one after the other. He has said the last &quot;real
&gt;&gt;one&quot; was 1999, but it only lasted a little over a year and except for

&gt;&gt;recluse IMO with or without a relationship (Vesta conj Saturn fourth).

&gt; I have no experience at all with asteroids and their meanings or influence,

&gt; At an everyday level, your friend may just be someone who can separate s-e-x

It is a popular misconception that some men consistently separate sex
from love and have little or no interest in having sex with someone they
truly love or in loving someone they love to have sex with. NOT!

Hrummpt... in some cases, I think people can have completely detached
sex without emotion and that includes women, but it will also be
indicated in the synastry between them and their natal chart. I have had
that and it feels totally different, trust me.

However, that is where astrology comes in (or why bother, IMO) -- if the
guy's Venus and Chiron is hooked up tightly to the woman's planets and
and he has Venus, Sun and Mercury in the 8th house and Moon in Leo
disposing the Sun there, and Moon sextile Sun and Venus there and trine
Mars conjunct Eros, then... how separate do you think sex and love can

He was logging on to one group daily just to read what he called my

So he came over right before his BD on Monday for his BD kiss, etc. and

from the trenches of astrology groups, chat spots and readings as being
part and parcel of his 9th house. With the 9th ruled by the Moon then
we are back to the Moon in Leo on the MC and me and that black boss of
his. LOL

His Mercury is 24 Gem which is my antiscia Sun and Venus -- that is why
Cancers can have such an attraction to Geminis sometimes -- their

IRH: Hello LoneLove:
I have read what you had to say about this relationship and must admit that
I felt
like "where have I felt like this before ??" I remembered.
It all points to one single thing:
Has it occured to you that he has a tremendous hangup regarding
age-difference ??
His (sub-)conscious is then lashing out at you, like it would be easier for
him, if you just disappeared (subconsciously talking only). This also
happens with some parents, who actually should never have had children, but
as they are there, they sub-consciously wish they would just disappear,
"then their lives would be so much easier". Of course it would not, but . .
. it actually shows that parents like that should have to get a
"parenting-license", in order that the children, growing up like this would
not have to "inherit" this kind of abusive stance, also a result of the
"anti authoritarian method", which has actually ruined generations of young
people. - -

There is no justification for being in a realtionship and acting out like
this man does.
If nothing else, he needs to accept the fact that, as an adult people have
to be able to expect him to be respectful, especially to a person he uses
for his daily/monthly (or whatever) basic *needs*.
Have you ever thought of what he does and with whom when he is "gone for a
while" ?? perhaps bringing back one of those "rare old Chinese diseases" ??
Unfortunately this is something one *has to* think about these days.

LL, You have shown in the various posts that you are such a good,
experiences astrologer, you should not let *any body* abuse you like this -
ever, as it is terribly degrading.
However one can say it makes a good "study project" :-))
I wish for you something MUCH better than that. Remember, you DESERVE it :-)
Have a good weekend.
Be well,
I.R.Heller

&gt; we are back to the Moon in Leo on the MC and me and that black boss of
&gt; his. LOL

&gt; His Mercury is 24 Gem which is my antiscia Sun and Venus -- that is why
&gt; Cancers can have such an attraction to Geminis sometimes -- their
&gt; Cancer planets can have the antiscias  conjunct the Gemini's planets.

&gt; Another's BML on one's Mercury should NOT negate the other 20 close and
&gt; excellent aspects between us unless you believe that BML rules the
&gt; entire chart and all of the synastry; so by her existence alone, any
&gt; aspect with BML dooms the relationship. BML = relationship killer

&gt; This is how I read your statements  -- is this correct? I keep thinking
&gt; a blind person is rubbing on an elephant's leg and thinking he has the
&gt; whole picture of the elephant wit this approach. You seem to have made
&gt; BML the most powerful point in synastry. Is this perhaps because you
&gt; have focused so much on her for so long?
">

[..]

Hi again, LL,
My comments were in reference and answer to your own specific
questions about what BML could infer, just as they would have been had you
asked about any other point/planet . It is, of course, for you to decide the
power of its influence in your synastry.
One of your previous comments was that you didn't want to be his Lilith.
That would seem to imply that you have some sort of idea of the *role* you
fulfil in the relationship with him. What is *that* role that you have
pictured yourself fulfilling and are you satisfied with it, as there must be
something in your
relationship, as also shown through synastry aspects, which is nagging at
the core of it, that hasn't yet been brought to the surface?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; BML is 14 Virgo in your own chart?
">

I think that's the TRUE position, putting it in my 1st house conjunct
Ascendant. It would still make the same aspects as Mean BML in my chart.
MEAN BML is rising with Chiron in the 12th house.

Best regards,
Christine.

I think you may well have finally hit your own nail on the head. Imho, it
can well represent 'the image created of a person' .
*If* BML can refer to that which does not manifest in form, is non-existent
except through the feeling nature, could such make one feel and/or feel
treated as a non-person, even if they physically exist of flesh and blood?
Maybe this is part of BML in physical Virgo that you find unacceptable?
In the other thread you said you *were* real to him,...yes, you do exist as
a body... yet you seem to imply now that he doesn't see you as a person.
Does that mean the rest of you that makes up who you are, other than the
'physical body'?
All the people whose charts I have with BML in Virgo have, for whatever
reason, experienced issues regarding the 'role' the physical body played in
their lives. The body depicted 'who' they were, gave them a label, etc.

-- haven't pinned it down

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

My dictionary says of 'denigrate'...a rare word for blacken :-)
So he talks to you about things he wouldn't otherwise speak of; e.g. 'how
bad he is' ? Seems he is accepting the
role that was drummed into him as a child instead of doing something about
it.

Geez... this is so long.......! My Venus//Pluto//Mercury in action!

Hey I. R.,

You are SO right, but there is one thing about this man that makes it a
very positive relationship for me. So far in 13 years of knowing and
loving him -- I am looking as good or better than he, IMHO. There is a
recent pic of me and a pic of him is about a year older than mine from
off the wwweb (see link below).

I did not do this for myself -- I am just not quite that narcisstic to
need to look at myself in the mirror everyday and say... wow, "I am
still so pretty, thin, sexy", etc. and fawning over myself. A woman
from my college classes (also with Farah Fawcett) was just featured in
a newspaper article here and I almost dropped the paper when I saw her.
She looked like my 90 yo grandmother. I swear -- you would NEVER think
we are from the same age generation. I was shocked, but she probably
has no obssesion with a younger man to stay young, so she has let
herself look like 90 yrs old. Scary to me.

I will say, people have asked me about having a portrait in my attic
(Dorian Gray) when they find out my age. LOL

This man has inspired me more than any other person in my life to
change, improve and look as good as I do -- I need to order a new photo
shoot soon -- I think I want to do something more S&amp;M like my friend
has of herself. :-) LOL  JK!!

I gave up smoking in 1993 for him and my son. Then I have done a lot of
work on physical self  and hired a trainer after my son went off to
college and I was overweight and out of shape when I dropped him a note
10/30/2003 after 4 years apart. He came back fast and he wanted to know
why I never contacted him in 4 years -- unfortunately I hurt him badly
and I think part of his behaviors now are partly pay-back for that pain
I tossed at him. I feel bad about that. I had no understanding of his
chart and his issues back then.

I continue to visit the gym nightly -- he has given up his bicyling and
exercise so he has a small basketball in front, while mine is
dissolving and he is getting wrinkled.  I have Renova and an excellent
team of doctors and dentists.  So... we'll see... but even with all
that, his mental perception has to do with his Neptune in his 1st and
my numerical digits, not with reality of how we actually look. All of
the women in my family live until their '90's and are very healthy
until near death.

The problem is he is an ex- bean counter (his degree before the last
one) -- so it is the numerical values of that birth information that
causes that reaction -- plus he is a Gemini with Neptune 1st house, so
he still visualizes himself in his 20's.

So he has Saturn and Jupiter both in Capricorn, Ret. so
super-conservative and non-risk taking -- which is what he needs the
most -- to learn to be more adventuresome and care less about
apprearances (says the Mars con Jupiter in Leo on the Asc.) LOL

Do you think we are NOT a physical match? I think we have a resemblance
as most attached couples (family remsemblance -- his Cupido (family) =
my Venus) doncha I think. ;)

http://home.austin.rr.com/libralove/MrMan&amp;Me.html

First off I am not THAT old, and secondly if I had been his mom, he
would not be so... uh... neurotic. :)

I think you are right -- he might be relieved for me to do a Black Moon
Lilith  disapearance, i.e., run off and copulate with demons, have
children and then eat them -- but I am NOT going to make it that easy
for him.

The connections are too tight and good for my benefit as well as his --
and I feel for him and want him to feel loved and adored for once in
his life whether he wants to or not. LOL Only if he can start to feel
being loved will he also be able to love. Doncha think? I do not think
he has ever really felt unconditional love.

For one thing -- I have the Saturn on my side of the synastry except
for his Saturn trine my Juno (1 degree orb) and he has many of the
Venus and Chiron's on his side of the synastry. So... ;)

Above all -- Astrology does work! I know that after 30 years and there
is simply no way to get around it! Plus we have his Jup// my Pluto and
Jup /-/ my Uranus those are SUPER DEKs between people.

His NN // my Chiron and his Venus // my NN. His Jup /-/ my Sun and
Venus also, so...

His Jupiter opp my Saturn, which is our only bad Clash and a couple of
//s and /-/s . You would think he would be the generous adverturesome
one in the pair, but no! I am the Jupiter and he is the Saturn.

I also seem to hold the key to his 9th house as my Saturn and Mercury
in Cancer sit right on the cusp at 3 Can with his BML, and that is his
second marriage, so he cannot get past the Greek Cerberus (BML) and
enter into the gates of hell (the second marriage) without me! -- LOL,
I know... those mythy things...  are so interesting aren't they?

He is not religious and I know about a lot more stuff (9th = higher
learning) than he does (lived a bit longer and worked in a lof of
different arenas) -- so his ninth house is mine for now! Maybe one day
we will travel the world together.... :) I have enough frequent flyer
miles to do that now.

"LL, You have shown in the various posts that you are such a good,
experienced astrologer, you should not let *any body* abuse you like
this - ever, as it is terribly degrading.

However one can say it makes a good "study project" :-)) "

Isn't it! Yes, like I said, it is his Mars square Saturn thing with him
-- S&amp;M and I was reading about the Marquis de Sade and poor Justine,
etc, and he sure has some of those attributes all right. But from what
I have seen people with hard Mars to Saturn all have some of that
cruelty in them and some use on others more than others . I guess
compassion has to be very well developed to balance it. He has little
if any of that -- he is a Republican. LOL JK!!

I find it fascinating astrologically and I have learned tons of
astrology just getting into his chart in detail with every planet,
point and asteroid. The fact that he is still a bachelor 20 years since
his divorce, is not surprising based on his behaviors and his
description of his terrible treatment during his childhood. My heart
goes out to him.

He says he is not like that with all women -- read (only those whom he
has an intense erotic attraction that causes him to get in touch with
the feelings that he tries not to have).  Amazingly, IF he is not like
that with all women -- none of them have hung around to keep taking
what he dishes out.  So...

I have a whole bunch of Sec. Major Prog. Saturns coming through into
2007 and one is P. Mars Square N. Saturn, at the same time as Saturn
con MC and Saturn square Asc going into 2007. Yikes! Marquis de Sade
deluxe or maybe I will be the female version of the sadist.

I have Mars conj Jupiter in Leo in the first, so P. Mars moving to 1
Libra square Saturn at 1 Cancer sure sounds like a cruel partner to me
-- with Aquarius on the 7th cusp.  I have no aspect between Mars and
Saturn, so I am certainly not used to this sort of behavior. We'll see
-- if it gets too painful --- I'll just do a 4 year hiatus again. ;)

So the coming couple of years should be very interesting -- Saturn-Mars
is pain also and he has chronic back pain from a fused disc -- but I
have no pain except the emotional when he is cruel. So since I have
this major progression coming up... I wonder if it is just one more
indication that we will be together somehow.

He has Saturn conj Vesta in his 4th house here (3rd house natally),
so...  he has depressive issues and reclusiveness in his apartment. He
has been badly wounded and only a truly powerful BML with the major
benefic aspects between is can make him face his demons and while his
P. BML is exact  on my Venus -- NOW is the perfect time. Right,
Christine?

I also see that Saturn is passing over his Prog. Venus which is my NN
at 27 Cancer and then it will sit on his Moon in Leo (which is my P of
Marriage and N. Pluto) right on his MC, so... while my Prog. Venus is
on his NN at 20 Virg, in his 11th house right now.

We both have major Venus-Pluto Progs in right now as well as my P. MC
is moving to conjunct my Natal Venus next year, and his Venus is moving
to 29 Cancer -- the crisis point at 29 critical where changes occur,
so...

As long as I understand where these behaviors of his are coming from...
I can protect myself from much of the cruelty that he gives out when he
is "feeling" vulnerable.  He has accused me of trying to push him away
and asked me not to do that -- but as often happens -- it seems like it
is he who wants to get me to dump him again to protect himself from the
pain of feeling.

Don't people do this all the time -- make the other one break up the
realtionship instead of having the cahones of doing it themselves?
Thing is, I've got the Saturn mostly, so... struggling is of little
use. LOL

All the Best to You and thanks for your concern! -- LL

Okay, Christine! I think I've got her now -- that BML!!

A black, denigrated, non-person... The Cerberus of his 9th house gaters
of hell and second marriage where BML will eat him up!! LOL

"Aw c'mon, admit it; you just want to be found :-)
Let's hope he finds these threads, so we can hear his version of your
relationship :-) "

Wouldn't that be great -- I flush him out and force him to take up for
himself and tell all about what a BML "witch" I am... LOL

When I ditched him and disappeared for 4 years in 1999 -- he was
reading my groups with the handles he knew from back then until I
changed my handle on AAM to Libralove, then he lost me for awhile he
said, but I never once looked for him in 4 years. Now I do, but he has
changed his handle so I can't find him -- it's all about paybacks!

And you think it is a game? Hmnnnn.... I wonder.... :)

&gt;&gt;Is BML like a non-person, Christine? He treats me like a non-worthwhile
&gt;&gt;person sometimes and it can feel very painful.

&gt; I think you may well have finally hit your own nail on the head. Imho, it
&gt; can well represent 'the image created of a person'.
">

Well, the odd thing is it seems to be of an image of himself as a child
that he somehow seems to see in me, where I am him at 6 or 7 years old
laughing and so happy to see him and he is stern and asking me to stop
laughing. He will ask me about something and then ask me to prove it no
matter what it is an e-mail I received a friend's background as a
recording producer -- anything thing I say -- I must have actual
legitimate backup for.

So anything I say -- he mistrusts and asks me to prove and anything I am
interested in or like, he denigrates. Even my love for him is an
indication of what a misguided person I am.

Then I try harder to please and I sometimes make comments to take up for
myself, but he  becomes cold and rejecting and walks out.

I think he has also caught on that the longer he stays with me, the more
of this puzzle and his unconscious leaks out through things he says in
response to my words and actions. So for self protection of this
psychological farce, he is starting to cut short his visits -- they used
to be 6 hours and now 1-1/2 hrs max. As the intimacy gap narrows he
needs to allow less and less time for the connection to be dedicated to
those past feelings that are being acted out.

People in therapy have been known to fire their therapist at this point
in the erotic transference because the closer it gets the more powerful
and unacceptable the feelings can become.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; *If* BML can refer to that which does not manifest in form, is non-existent
&gt; except through the feeling nature, could such make one feel and/or feel
&gt; treated as a non-person, even if they physically exist of flesh and blood?
&gt; Maybe this is part of BML in physical Virgo that you find unacceptable?
&gt; In the other thread you said you *were* real to him,...yes, you do exist as
&gt; a body... yet you seem to imply now that he doesn't see you as a person.
&gt; Does that mean the rest of you that makes up who you are, other than the
&gt; 'physical body'?
">

It is like I am an object of no value (the unwanted child) and it is so
powerfully similar to how he described how his parents treated him as
though his feelings had no value and that his needs or desires were
unimportant and of no value. He said he was told he did not deserve
anything and for anything he received from anyone -- he should be
eternally grateful for whatever it was.

I have given him small gifts by mail (like a jazz CD) and he has never
responded regarding them and I have to think he must need to ignore it
rather than accept and then reciprocate or offer appreciation after what
he told me about how his parents felt about anything he received from
others.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; All the people whose charts I have with BML in Virgo have, for whatever
&gt; reason, experienced issues regarding the 'role' the physical body played in

&gt; -- haven't pinned it down

&gt;&gt;perfectly -- but figured it was his Mars square Saturn Marquis de Sade
&gt;&gt;cruelty aspect,

&gt; Would this not imply the physical cruelty that is part of sadism?
">

Not necessarily, I never ever noticed any examples of physical rage or
anger, and my cat(s) adore him. He says cats love him because he is so
"calm". I think it is all so locked up inside that he is not even in
touch. He says he has no feelings. He was taught not to feel, because
his feelings were not of value.

He is finishing up a Prog. Mars in Taurus square N. Uranus at 17 Leo
6/02/05 and his Prog. Mars trine N. Saturn on 7/01/05.

I think he is probably profoundly depressed a lot and that Saturn conj
Vesta in his 4th is the life of a hermit inside an apartment of stuff he
has collected to try to feel better about himself, but it is no longer
working. He needs to be with someone who cares for him and understands
why he is like he is.

And as the Saturn moves over his MC and his Moon in Leo -- there may be
a "What's it all about, Alfie?" situation going on with him and his
focus on career above all else and his isolation from feelings. That is
why my Pluto is there bearing down on the Moon with Saturn, IMO.

His SR for May 30, 2005 shows powerful Deks of Venus, BML and Persephone
at 24N which is both our High-Dek Mercuries.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  but maybe it is my Mercury conjunct his BML. He says

&gt;&gt;things that tend to denigrate me (the way he described the way his
&gt;&gt;parents treated him verbably -- like his feelig did not count for
&gt;&gt;anything) while I have nothing but good things to say about him when we
&gt;&gt;are together.

&gt; My dictionary says of 'denigrate'...a rare word for blacken :-)
&gt; So he talks to you about things he wouldn't otherwise speak of; e.g. 'how
&gt; bad he is' ? Seems he is accepting the
&gt; role that was drummed into him as a child instead of doing something about
&gt; it.
">

He only told me last year about how his parents treated him as though he
was "worthless" s a child, and I was starting to feel worthless after he
left. I found he was acting out their part on me as though I were him,
and I had become as a child hoping to do something for his love somehow.
Maybe if I did or said the right thing to please him but never receiving
the validation I keep seeking. And so it goes on.

It is an example of the sort of sick partnership of emotions that people
often marry and act out the neurotic parts over and over again
throughout the marriage unless therapy or something comes in and
resolves the fixation on that moment of time in his past. Also most
couples are not even aware of what they are doing.

He could probably get therapy through his health insurance and maybe he
will because as most of us know -- Saturn moving across the Moon on an
angle is no picnic.

He has P. Moon square N. Saturn as BML hits his Moon July 10-18th. That
is NOT a good feeling, I would imagine, but I do not know whether to
come closer to him and be supportive or step back and just let him go
through it.

It worries me a bit to think what that may feel like to him as T. Saturn
moves in to that spot on September 22nd. Being a Cancerian, I want to
get in there and try to support him emotionally -- but I am not sure if
that is the best course of action.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I have found he loves to lurk when he can find me on an astro chat

&gt;&gt;finding me for awhile -- and then he either sneaks up on me or I tell
&gt;&gt;him where I am. LOL

&gt; Aw c'mon, admit it; you just want to be found :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;It is funny. 3 degrees of Cancer is his 9th house Placidus cusp and his
&gt;&gt;BML as well -- as my Mercury. So he views my weird and unique tales
&gt;&gt;from the trenches of astrology groups, chat spots and readings as being
&gt;&gt;part and parcel of his 9th house.

&gt; Found nothing to believe in for himself?
">

Only "truth and justice" from his point of view -- he has a powerful
Super Ego, but a diminished Ego in my view. Not religious, but very
conservative politically. No religious or spiritual views except that
most religion is hopelessly superstitious (for which I agree). Desecrate
a Koran and kill 10 people over it sort of thing.

I just do not agree that astrology is like a religion. Ha! Who is our
God? Who do we pray to? I wish he would come on here and explain that
little theory of his about us and religion. LOL

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; With the 9th ruled by the Moon then

&gt;&gt;we are back to the Moon in Leo on the MC and me and that black boss of

&gt; Sounds to me like one big game you play with each other, but if that's your
&gt; thing; why not? :-)

Not really a game, Christine. To a happily long-term married person this
may all seem somewhat bizarre, but for an attractive man to stay alone
for 20 years without a partner, there usually are "issues" and until
they are resolved -- the future of his emotional life is fairly bleak in
my view.

I think I may have a "key" to his Chiron at 2 Pisces with my Cancer
bundle at Saturn (1) Mercury and Pallas (3) Sun (6) and Venus (7) and I
care about him very much and want him to be happy and feel fulfiled
while overcoming the wounds he has suffered in the past.

To the Magi, that "conjuncted bundle" does not all have to be 1.5 orb to
his Chiron (only on planet in the bundle) because the conjunctions pull
along each planet nearby and create what they call a "conjuncted Grand
Trine" with is Neptune at 6 Scorpio. I love him and want him to be well
and happy.

Thanks again for your input, Christine. And Best to All -- LL

Basically it is NOT this position as described in another thread:

***I believe there's much in Lilith in a male/female relationship that
can never offer connection and commitment; simply because 'she'
represents 'his' sensual needs, but isn't always ....or doesn't exist
as... the person he'd choose to take home to meet his mother, or
introduce to friends, or become the wife of his children. You know; the
'acceptable' with which one so often
complies. Lilith is often a representation of 'the other woman', that
fulfils the erotic fantasies but is never seen in public places where
he is known on his arm, which position is reserved for the submissive
Moon and/or Venus figure in his life. ***

Apologies and I do not mean this in a negative. personal way, but I
find that statement to be very sexist. None of those other
possibilities exist anyway - his mother is dead and he has little if
any contact with any other family members -- as for being seen in
public places -- he said most of his past women friends were happy to
just stay home most of the time, but he said he took one *once* to a
concert but she is gone also.

He seems to have little or no interest in having his own children at
this point and has never mentioned any such desire, so what he needs
most from what I gather and what I am best at is a "committed
relationship" of mutual concern, caring, companionship, active
passionate sex life and emotional support with common interests of
music and books. If the overall synastry with this man were not the
best I have seen, then I would not have bothered to keep this going
with the issues he has -- if they are conservaive societal issues then
that is just his loss and unfortunate for him that he is that rigid
because at this rate he may never find that "appropriate type" woman to
settle down with.

But from those statements you have made, Christine,  -- a man's partner
must be a submissive Moon or Venus person, be very socially acceptable
(perhaps implied would be like 5 to 20 years younger than the male) to
bring home to mom and friends as "appropriate"? Is this part of the
criteria for what you call a "socially acceptable woman".

That statement implies that if the woman falls off the bell curve of a
rather rigid "societal" description that you have determined by the
words of what a man's "socially acceptable woman" would be and she has
sex with him and satisfies his "sensual needs" -- then by your criteria
-- she becomes then his BML? I am asking because there is this big
cloud of confusion regarding what/who BML really is an represents in
every astrogroup I have heard her discussed.

He and I are of the same race, color, class background and edcuational
status -- he has an LLB and I have an MFA, but by virtue of my Mercury
at 3 Cancer and his BML and the fact that I fulfill his erotic desires,
then -- I automatically fit the BML profile rather than the "socially
acceptable" potential partner position? I  am just trying to understand
how one is judged to be a man's BML or not since you have spent a long
time studying BML, but said you never looked at he aspects with BML
between married people -- or most did last if they had them...?
Hmnn...this is definitely something to follow up on. Do the happily
married people have any aspects between BML in their charts. This is a
"must have" for your book, IMO.

I am just trying to understand how a Mercury at 3 Cancer might qualifiy
me for a BML position rather than for a  "normal committed
relationship" position or is it because you have known our age
difference since I posted here on AAM in 1998-99 when you had much the
same comments to make about my position in his life then as possibly
"inappropriate -- never on his arm or meeting his family". This could
be the longest running passionate, erotic relationship ever and when I
think of how dismal so many "committed relatioships" are... well...

Is Demi Moore a BML by virtue of her age difference with Ashton
Kutchner or what about Sheryl Crow and Lance Armstrong -- are those
women BMLs? Why I am getting the feeling that my age and my Mercury  at
3 Cancer has somehow shoveled me over into the BML position from
1998-99 here when we had much the same discussion here. Perhaps I am
misremebering how I became the "inappropriate woman" and probable BML
to this man back then and now fast forward to 2005!! LOL

***She' (her Lilith) knows how to entrap 'him' by providing and
fulfilling those inner needs but that have very little to do with the
reality of his everyday existence. It depends upon in which sign Lilith
is placed as to how such 'socially unacceptable', yet at the same time
natural inner, needs are activated.***

Never had any plans to "entrap" him -- he did that all by himself -- I
take no credit even though he accused me of "tricking him" -- LOL
"Yeah, my BML made me do it!" he weaved her wicked lil BML web of
passion and well...

All I did was send him a Halloween card.  But I do make an excellent
supportive, nurturing and passionate woman, so... why should he
complain -- no demands, no fights, no issues of what I want and have to
have or good-bye, etc... Now that is a thought! Light bulb!

That is what I need to have -- a list of demands and ultimatums like
most women in relationships! Then I can be an "appropriate"
relationship! LOL

I guess my Muslim girlfriend and I will just have to overcome the
societal norms that keep us tied to some rather rigid ideas of how
"reality" needs to be with us women. In regards to the place men want
to relegate us to in their lives based on our satisfying or NOT their
erotic needs -- it is no wonder so many men end up in unfulfilled,
cold, sexless marriages. But oh well... if they want to attach that
sort of rigid sexist criteria to a life partner, then they get what
they deserve, IMO.

You know I absolutely hate the way Google handles these groups -- you
cannot add a quote in any way from any posting using carots or
asterisks or anything but this crummy beta software screws with it, but
through the my ISP newsgroup newsreader-email software it takes a day
just to post -- so...

Anyway I had to laugh last night when I crawled in bed and was reading
about Pallas and had just posted this:

sort of rigid sexist, (read virginal) criteria to a life partner, then
they get what
they deserve, IMO.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------

It is funny since I have Pallas (feminist issues and fairness) conjunct
my Mercury in Cancer, which is my lovers BML!! ROTFLOL We'll see how
this spins out in the next 6 months -- should get interesting. :)

I guess that is why placing women in BML vs. non-BML catagories is so
annoying to me -- like the focus on virginity in Muslim cultures. Then
that sick guy Paul Bernardo that killed all those women in that other
thread. He was into raping "virgins" as a "societal appropriate
marriage" partners? Uday used to have the school mistresses send groups
of young girls to his house for him to pick out some to deflower later.
This in turn, comdemned them to a life of prostitution on the streets
after he drugged and raped them because they were "used" and discarded
like a tissue. (From a Vanity Fair article on Saddam Hussein's sons).

This sort of attitude about female sexuality is just promulgating more
rigid, twisted male sexual derivations into women's lives as in those
backward cultures where the women can be killed by their fathers of
brothers for having sex before marriage and the killer(s) have complete
impunity. Barbaric! Right, Nemo grrlfriend?

There must be some other -- more "appropriate" meaning behind BML
besides "appropriate woman"  vs.  "inappropriate woman".  Surely... we
can bring BML into the 21st Century from that biblical sexist past
where Adam wanted a subjugated woman to do as she was told so he ended
up with a "clone" from his rib.
Then they both got in trouble with God because together they were no
different than one another and made identical choices in eating that
fruit -- no balanced thought processes between them.

Can we also have a signature like man's Moon = womans BML or something
in synastry -- because not looking at long term couples aspects between
BMLs and their other planets and asteroids sure leaves out a lot of
information in regards to how she operates between people in
partnership situations.

He quoted your own favorite saying to me at that time. Since then he
has also gone through 4 dental assistants, 2 billing assistants and 4

to hear me repeat this chsrming statement after I asked her the same
question recently about them after 15 years, "When is your boss going
to marry his girlfrined?"

Her eyes rolling following my repeating the quote of his 5 yrs ago

But this particular situation is all about being accepted for himself
without feeling like he has to "pay" for being close to a woman ($100
dinner and event) prior to bed and then both are too tired to bother.

This thread is about being loved with physical intimacy and kissing and
long deep eye to eye contsct for hours without paying for it. It is
called a FREE love. ROTFLOL! JK!!

Accusing an AAM poster of "smoking crack" in your posted statement and
I believe it was Christine, who said a man needs/wants a submissive

Having studied these things for awhile, H -- I know that object
relations have been missing and he has lost all the women from his life
including his mother. Had she been a loving mother with unconditional
and yes, erotic love, with no conditions he would not be in the
psychological shape he is in presently, IMO.

I am going through having recently lost my own mother (and my son going
off to college) and we are both in the process of grieving and
re-establishing for me and possibly establishing for him "object
relations".

This is in order to rebuild our devastated egos from our losses and be
able to reconnect our emotions from the isolation we have both been
experiencing in recent years.

It is called "transformation" from the domain of Pluto, and that is the
work we are doing together at this time. I will not give up on him
because I love him very much. I know that as difficult as my mom was
that I lost, she was evidently a healthier "object" than his must have
been to him. So I care deeply for him and what he has endured in his
life.

"The mystery of Tantric Buddhism consists in ...
the manipulation of erotic love
so as to attain universal androcentric power."

Hence [the] lover wants to completely penetrate the beloved with his
tongue, his mouth, with his eyes, etc." (Bruno quoted by Samsonow,

Or, as a couple of female clients with BML in Virgo stated, " I'm just

LL:

I am so sorry to hear that women with BML in Virgo have been sentenced
to this fate en masse by your experience. I am amazed that you actually
relegate all Virgo BMLs to this specific statement. Interestingly
enough I have had sex with several men (due the number of years on this
planet) and having lived through the 60-80's. ;) So... that being said.

I have felt that way from time to time in my lifetime, but NEVER in
encounter with this man.  I only feel his intense emotional feelings
during sex, unlike some other past events. I do feel let down when he
has left, as all those in erotic transference feel -- the pain of rhe
missing object of desire who is no longer in the room.

I am fortunate enough to have a proper measuring tool for sexual
encounters due to a varied life experience, unlike the less experienced
woman who has  experience from which to draw. This is the reason some
male egos require virgins -- they can have no place of reference in
regards to is he a good-bad-indifferent lover -- it  also why some
cultures require "arranged marriages". Who does this benefit? ;)

So, Christine, with BML in Virgo on your Asc., I must assume from your
statement that you would always feel like a "slab of meat" during sex.
Is that logic misplaced or did I read your inference incorrectly?

And in regards to what Christine actually wrote:

Lilith is often a representation of 'the other woman', that
fulfils the erotic fantasies but is never seen in public places where
he is
known on his arm, which position is reserved for the submissive Moon
and/or
Venus figure in his life.

Christine, IMO, it is better if you write something and it is commented
on -- not to back track and rewite it differently as it becomes fairly
obvious to the lurkers that there is obfuscation going on.

&gt; such 'socially unacceptable', yet at the same time natural inner, needs are
&gt; activated.
">

--------------------------------------------------------

To REALLY set the record straight, Christine, (the above quote) is what
you actually said in its entirety:

The fact that you state that by fullfilling his "inner needs that have
little to do with "the reality of his everyday existence" and is an
"entrapment" is in a word, very worrisome in regards to projecting
separation of sensual and inner needs from a man's ego and his "reality
of everyday existence".

This statement of yours is an indicstion of a form of psychosis --
where the ego and libido and super ego are completely separate entities
and split off from the ego. It is a form of neurosis that you describe
and is NOT a condition one should seek out.

The fact what you describe BML doing. is actually attempting to
"re-integrate" the inner sensual needs into the ego as a very needed
and positive connection for the man. She becomes the shaman of whole
egoness and perhaps it is through her body (Virgo) that she aids and
helps him to accomplish this task. :)

This is not good mental health you are describing as though it were
normal for this poor hypothetical man. It is indeed, IMO, the bane of
our society and the radicals that we are fighting presently.

BML is then the hidden healer of these men when she re-introduce or in
some cases introduces for the first time, the sensual and the feeling
of passion into the realm of the evryday ego after it has been split
off unfortunately or never incorporated in some.

According to Empedocles,  "Aphrodite is Eros himself," the immortal
force that unites and  harmoniously blends together all the elements in
nature, the  "bringer" and "giver" of life. He also said, "the  path to
knowledge can be achieved only through Eros himself. The energy
represented by Eros brings about a balance between pleasure, delight
and  gnosis, and this harmonious and enthusiastic search for gnosis
comes not so much from the answers one receives but more from the
search itself."

Eros as seen in the Kabbalah

The imagery of love, or eros, is crucial for a discussion of Shekhinah.
Eros implies a yearning for unity, harmony, and completion. Shekhinah
is the aspect which receives an impulse from its masculine counterpart,
Yesod, and engages in the creative  activity of harmonization. It is a
mystical marriage bringing balance to the world. This marriage is
God's call to Himself in a transfiguration of His harmony in love.
One important principle in Zoharic thought is  man's role in
maintaining the sefirotic balance...

&gt; &gt; off the wwweb (see link below).

&gt; And that photo could confirm what I have long wondered about this

&gt; How can the beautiful woman in that photo spend hours burning the midnight

&gt; Does (attention received from) writing about a doting and obsessive erotic
&gt; desire take precedence over a social life in which the woman in the photo

IRH     ...  younger man with bad manners, no upbringing, but something he
thinks is "education". Upbringing goes with education - from home *and* from
school.
Hello LL: ever since I read your last post my soul hurts, I agree with
Christine with every single word, 100% and want to only add a few more
points.

As it comes across: HE is your hobby.
We all know that most hobbies are literally non-productive, that is why we
should never complain, if things donآ´t work, as not all, but most hobbies
are totally done on a non professional basis.

You mentioned that YOU withdrew some years back, now you think you need to
feel guilty ??   Is this a MO and NE in 12th house ??
There *must* have been a reason why you "withdrew" before. You never told
him the reason ?? Or he never learned from that - either ;-)

A good rule in life is to NEVER go back (parents and direct children
excluded),
as things will NOT improve, if one has to deal with ex-husbands, lovers or
work places which were left for "unfriendly reasons".

You wrote regarding his "terrible treatment during his childhood". This is a
line I have also heard before, more than once. So it still seems to work.
Unbelieveable.
These men *count on* that your "heart goes our to them". We normally call
them "users" (Sat in Cap).

What ever it is, his "rough" childhood experiences et al, you might want to
tell him to grow up and finally get over it. He is NOT a child any more by
any means and his bad manners should just out of principle NOT be tolerated.
He should have heard or read somewhere that one cannot always blame others
for ones own absolutely inexcusable bad behavior. Californians would call
this kind of behavior "low life" , which somehow does not fit his photo
image at all, so it leads to the conclusion that he is in fact a "user" -
all the way. - Think about it. -

You have given so many stations of the verious planets and their relations
to one another, that it is not all too difficult to put the charts together.
So could it be that one of the charts is not quite "pictured" right ?? (i.e.
HIS  b.-hour ??  or YOUR PL :-)

However, if *you*  are expecting one or several hard aspecting transits
"coming your way", then I would make sure to stay out of an abuserآ´s way.
Your son still needs you.

Last but not least:
You mentioned "it is like it is he who wants to get me to dump him again . .
."
Sounds so much like those teenagers, who "get dumped" just before an
upcoming Christmas or birthday, thus saving the money to buy gifts. Now with
teenagers, one frowns at them, but smiles inside, if one is not the teenager
getting *dumped*;
but as a 45 year old ??   Tell him to grow up already, but quickly.
AND: "he is a Republican", he is a "conservative" -  is that supposed to be
an explanation that one has a "licence to be cruel" ??  Its going around
these days. Just watch the (foreign) media, how they see R and sonservative;
of course I was not aware that it was infectious ;-))
What next ??

LL, do think about those things, about and *for* yourself. You are a
beautiful lady, never mind the attached chronology, but with a cruel partner
that can change mighty quickly. -

Yes, he and astrology are my present hobbies and each supply something

Moon conjunct Neptune in the 2-3rd house in Libra. ;)

He knows why he wanted to know how soon I could get my son into bed and
I had a lot of issues I needed to address besides "eroticism" at that
moment.

His issues have not changed, IMO, but I do believe that he is as
obssessed with me as I have been with him -- but my issues have changed
-- my son is in college so I can now indulge in any hobbies that I wish
that provide me with pleasure. :)

He has Juno in Sag at 22 in the 2nd house and so his perfect partner is
a "hedonistic and sensual" partner. Do you think I fit? ;)

Going back is different from revisiting someone -- ONE can never go

breached in this world's reality. At least not with present technology.

It works because the wounded are still human beings with needs and
feelings (even if frequently) disallowed by themselves and others.

The orchids that I buy at the Home Depot that are half dead make
beautiful specimens once I love and care for them. Same goes for the

&gt;&gt; Basically it is NOT this position as described in another thread:

&gt;&gt; ***I believe there's much in Lilith in a male/female relationship that
&gt;&gt; can never offer connection and commitment; simply because 'she'
&gt;&gt; represents 'his' sensual needs, but isn't always ....or doesn't exist
&gt;&gt; as... the person he'd choose to take home to meet his mother, or
&gt;&gt; introduce to friends, or become the wife of his children. You know; the
&gt;&gt; 'acceptable' with which one so often
&gt;&gt; complies. Lilith is often a representation of 'the other woman', that
&gt;&gt; fulfils the erotic fantasies but is never seen in public places where
&gt;&gt; he is known on his arm, which position is reserved for the submissive
&gt;&gt; Moon and/or Venus figure in his life. ***

&gt;&gt; Apologies and I do not mean this in a negative. personal way, but I
&gt;&gt; find that statement to be very sexist...........

&gt;Hi LL,
&gt;Maybe because it affronts your strong sense of your 'feminine identity', and
&gt;I agree with you.
&gt;But that doesn't mean that the statement itself is untrue.

&gt;&gt; But from those statements you have made, Christine,  -- a man's partner
&gt;&gt; must be a submissive Moon or Venus person, be very socially acceptable

&gt;'Must' would, to my mind, add a touch of Pluto. The trouble my husband and I
&gt;have with our square Venus-Pluto's, as well as opposing Moons! And his BML
&gt;in Leo and mine in Virgo each show where submission to will and
&gt;non-servitude clash :-)

&gt;I think your knowledge of astrology goes far beyond mine and you are aware
&gt;of the significance and influence of Moon and Venus in what a man
&gt;'outwardly' seeks in them.

&gt;&gt; (perhaps implied would be like 5 to 20 years younger than the male) to
&gt;&gt; bring home to mom and friends as &quot;appropriate&quot;? Is this part of the
&gt;&gt; criteria for what you call a &quot;socially acceptable woman&quot;.

&gt;I assume you mean the 'social' and not *my* personal criteria :-)
&gt;Every culture has it norms, standards of/and behaviour to which male and
&gt;female can feel they 'ought to' and 'should' adhere and respect. As I
&gt;understand it, that's the line that refers to 'socially acceptable';
i.e. Saturn.
&gt;As I have come to understand it, BML in harsh aspect is indicative of a
&gt;nature/trait that does not adhere to those norms, so the person FEELS a
&gt;leper, outcast, disgraced, rejected by those that live within that social
&gt;norm. The nature of the social norm is often in correlation to the sign in
&gt;which BML is placed. The charts I have with a totally well-aspected BML show
&gt;people whose 'ab'normal or 'un'usual (as in 'outside' the accepted social
&gt;norm) nature is noproblem to themselves.

&gt;&gt; That statement implies that if the woman falls off the bell curve of a
&gt;&gt; rather rigid &quot;societal&quot; description that you have determined by the
&gt;&gt; words of what a man's &quot;socially acceptable woman&quot; would be and she has
&gt;&gt; sex with him and satisfies his &quot;sensual needs&quot; -- then by your criteria
&gt;&gt; -- she becomes then his BML?

&gt;I think she would become representative of his BML when he/she inwardly
&gt;FEELS what you have suggested. What two people do in privacy is nobody's
&gt;business but their own, but too often the 'social ethics' feeling of what is
&gt;right/wrong, good/bad/, acceptable/unacceptable, that is attracted or
&gt;repelled, still lingers in the air. It isn't 'physical', but it's there.
&gt;That lingering feeling that somehow adhere's to the social norm or codes,
&gt;whether or not a person keeps to them, is the intervention of BML making its
&gt;presence felt...imho.
&gt;I really don't know how else to explain further to you how my mind tries to
&gt;put it all together.

&gt;&gt;I am asking because there is this big
&gt;&gt; cloud of confusion regarding what/who BML really is an represents in
&gt;&gt; every astrogroup I have heard her discussed.

&gt;I think this is because there are too few studies/books/teaching websites on
&gt;the subject to get an agreeing handle on what it signifies. BML, as an
&gt;astrological point, has not been given serious consideration in astrology
&gt;until quite recently (as per
&gt;thousands of years of astrology), and from what I have personally read,
&gt;everything is based upon the feminism/Lilith myth.

RM: French astrologers were studying it (Mean Lunar Apogee) 70 years
ago, but the recent 'meanings' of MLA (or BML) were transferred from
the invisible satellite (Dark Moon/Black Moon).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I am trying to look at BML's significance from its purely astrological

RM: BML is not a "non-physical body" and it's not a point either. It's
basically an imaginary line which is derived from joining the dots
from a series of points (the Lunar apogee once a month). It's similar
to making an ephemeris by joining eclipse degrees and  pretending that
something is AT those degrees at any given time.

&gt;I was not talking about 'you' specifically in the paragraph you quoted, but
&gt;how BML can tend to remain in the background.

&gt;Imho, and remembering I haven't undertaken synastry study so this could be
&gt;counted as purely hypothetical and speculative, one's ME. to the other's BML
&gt;(or even in natal chart) is about communication from Mercury to dig out and
&gt;reveal whatever it is that BML represents; nothing more. Astrologically
&gt;speaking, BML needs the outlet of a planet through which to function, like
&gt;Asc. and MC.
&gt;I have seen BML in Cancer refer to many things, ranging from a denial to
&gt;express feelings, a feeling of lack of nurturing and caring, a lack of
&gt;maternal needs or feeling or home life, no children (by choice or medical
&gt;intervention),  a 'not needing anyone' experience, repulsion of dependency
&gt;needs, but also the natural trait that is akin to (maternal) instinct and/or
&gt;gut feeling of that which cannot be rationally explained. Mercury will
&gt;provide the natural curiousity and willing ear, but BML in Cancer has
&gt;nothing to do with talking and may not FEEL at all prepared to talk about
&gt;hidden issues. Your friend's BML makes many aspects but not to his Mercury
&gt;:-)

RM: If you dig deep enough you can always find something to correspond
with some sort of denial, but the idea is to make an astrological
claim in *advance*.

The Charts are real also, but his has recently been rectified by Keplar

Have you ever heard the tune, "Love Me or Leave Me?" I spent about a

some of the charts and links to their profiles. LOL

The guys nearer my age would never work for me because they seemed
about 15 years older in every way from attitude to looks. Elevator
music and Western paintings. LOL

The the 28 year olds were thick as ticks after me, but only wanted one
thing. I dated one guy born in Jan as this one was born in May so I
could have the benefit of that 6 degree Scorpio, but he was a Capricorn
and he had his Saturn square was opp my Venus, Mercury and Sun and
Quincux my Uranus, so... I had to ditch him. I should have as soon as

Thank you, Cristine! But life is hard and then we die. Just because I
look great, am very intelligent (Hi-Dek Merc like Mr. Man), fun to be

Only pretty screwed up guys are available out there -- why? Because if
they were in great emotional shape, they with be enjoying life with
someone they love and care about. There are a lot of 40-something
bachelors who can only hold a relationship for about 3 months max. The

IRH:   Hello LL: Now, I did not think I was going to "contribute" one more
line, BUT *this* reaction towards Ken was really uncalled for - if you think
about it.

You see also: you gave "info" about both of your charts before, which I had
noted and built the charts and the synastry chart.
Most of those infos were right but your PL position 9آ° vs 7آ° for example
gives the whole ballgame a new park.
IF we are talking astrology and IF we are also talking consideration for
other beings (like also your saved plants and animals), then please take it
that all OUR input was strictly in consideration FOR YOU - believe it or not
:-)

You see, if this was strictly an astrological research subject, you might
have put: "His is xxxxxx &amp;  Hers is xxxxxx date. How do you on AAmod see
their synastry ??" This way you would never have felt "under attack".
However the way you gave your personal experience, it more sounded like a
cry for help, a request of "do you see what I canآ´t see??" or "whatآ´s wrong
here?? any suggestions ??"
Believe it or not, ALL our input was meant to be helpful and never meant to
hurt your feelings or to doubt your abilities in any way, shape or form.
As you know, not all people express themselves the same way, with all their
good intentions. - - -
I wish you well.
btw: Screenplay sounds great - GOOD LUCK. Perhaps this/your whole situations
was really "worth while" going through after all :-))
Take care.

But I'm not doing that.
'A couple'  does not mean 'en masse'. I simply put forward the *experiences*
of clients as an additive to H's remark, just as I listen and observe *your*
experiences of your feminine attitude towards your natural body. By the same
token you could say that I use *your* feminine attitude of feeling
constantly attacked
about how you use your physical body. But I'm not saying that either. What I
*am*
saying is that observation has indicated that people with BML in Virgo have
specific views about themselves as a result of the natural state of their
physical body.

Exactly !

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So, Christine, with BML in Virgo on your Asc., I must assume from your

&gt; Is that logic misplaced or did I read your inference incorrectly?

You should never assume anything which, as someone once explained, is the
forerunner of a cock up (i.e. mistake). My BML in Virgo 'did'  indeed refer
to a mistaken image of myself as a result of my physical body, but not as my
clients referred to it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And in regards to what Christine actually wrote:

&gt; Lilith is often a representation of 'the other woman', that
&gt; fulfils the erotic fantasies but is never seen in public places where
&gt; he is
&gt; known on his arm, which position is reserved for the submissive Moon
&gt; and/or
&gt; Venus figure in his life.

&gt; Christine, IMO, it is better if you write something and it is commented
&gt; on -- not to back track and rewite it differently as it becomes fairly
&gt; obvious to the lurkers that there is obfuscation going on.
">

The problem with observation put down in the written word is that it is
often read in another way and/or taken too personally. What you appear to
say is that by my trying to give a broader explanation of the initial
subject; in this case observations on BML, I am changing what I originally
wrote. I would contradict that but if that is the way you choose to see it,
so be it.  As I said elsewhere, I cannot 'prove' anything.
The words 'often', 'representation' and 'fantasies' should provide
indication that it doesn't mean ' everyone except LL'.
You readily agreed with the observations made by the asteroid author about
Juno (original theme of thread) because they apparently fitted 'you'. The
same observations might not fit me or anyone else, but that doesn't mean
they are either right or wrong. I think any study of astrological concepts

A very facile answer, Christine, but very appreciated none the less. So
in the year 2015, approximately 10 years from this birthday June 28th,
Neptune will trine my Venus and move out of my 8th house so I can then
have a partner? Would that work in your view?

So then I can just stock up on vibrator batteries and add a few
pussycats to the household and wait it out? Is that peoples suggestion?

Or would a possibility be finding someone who has his Neptune in a
Grand Trine with my Venus (0 deg), Sun (0 deg), Mercury (3.5) and his
Chiron and semisextile my Moon be a viable alternative?

His Chiron at 2 Pisces is trine my Mercury (1 deg), Saturn (1 deg)
tightly and quincunx my Neptune (1 deg).

Does this not sound like mutual healing can occur on both sides of this
wonderful synastry?

If we look at it solely astrologically and put away all the personal
value judgements -- as I am sure I would not want your husband on a bet
either, but then YOU do want him, so point made.

So maybe someone with a "soft" Neptune and with no drug addictions,
mental illness, etc. A beer or two on occasion and loves having sex
with me and always has since 1992. How bad can that be people?

So let's continue to examine it astrologically as I always have
preferred anyway -- anything else is "I say potato and you say
potatoe", etc. Astrology ALWAYS tells the story while personal
perceptions are so off from the reality frequently. Like Ray, data does
NOT lie. :)

He has Neptune in Scorpio (1st) quincunx his Sun in Gem (8th) to match
my Sun square Neptune, and his Nep. is square his Moon to match my Moon
conj Neptune. His Neptune is sextile his Pluto and trine his Chiro and
conjunct his Asc and Square his MC. It is also semisquare his Juno,
which is me -- with my VTX there exact.

You know of course that one of the major issues in synastry is to have
like planets aspecting one another as the partner, and then those same
planets in good aspect with one another between the two charts? Does
this ring a bell with anyone?

Take a person with a square or a T-square and swing a Grand Water Trine
into it an the emotions for healing flow -- right? That happens from
both directions in our charts. We are both the healed and the healer in
this act.

http://home.austin.rr.com/libralove/MrMan_Libralove.html

Ok, so he has no clue of how he appears to others with Neptune in the
1st house, and he probably doesn't even understand his own self with
any sense of personal reality. I have known a number of Neptune 1st
housers (my ex is one). They are frequently a complete mystery to
themselves.

But with our Grand Trine, he has found a partner like no other to that
Neptune, since I allow him to just be him and adore him for it. The
problem seems to be the age difference which makes me as experienced as
him (by a few years) and almost as bright (both with hi-dek mercuries)
both love music and jazz. We love to read and putter with electronics.
He is a lawyer and I love to talk about Pop Torts and lots of stuff he
knows a lot about. He is so clever, funny and brilliant, but I doubt he
hears that very much from anyone.

His Venus is trine my Moon (2.5 deg) and my Neptune (2 deg) and sextile
my Ceres. My Venus is trine his Neptune (0 deg) Chiron (4) and Asc (4).

My own Neptune is trine my SN and sextile my NN in Cancer -- 6th-12th
so service behind closed doors is my thing.

I am getting ready to have my Juno return plus Chiron is making a
T-square to my Chiron 10 Virg square Uranus at 10 Gemini as similar to
my previous two marriages at 20 and at 40 -- every 20 years the Chiron
event and 22-1/2 years approx. the half arc comes around to the Aries
point so...

Next year I get S.A.D Moon/Jup, Venus/Jup and Sun/Jupiter to the 45
degree Aries point (and Venus/Mars at 44).

Mars/Jup will have just passed to 23 on the 22-1/2 with Venus,
Sun/Venus, Mars, Sun, Moon/Venus and Sun/Moon all at 21 and headed to
Aries on the half arc at 22-1/2. I have never NOT seen my planetary
bundle of planetary pictures to NOT pay off especially with great ones
at 45 and 22-1/2.

I also have a bunch of Venus, Sun, Jupiter and MC major secondary
progressions, but I do not want to make this any longer than it already
is.

Since you have determined that Neptune is the spotlight of this so
-called "problem" of mine, as some have judged here -- how would one
handle having ANY partner (7th house) over the next 10 years with
Neptune strolling aimlessly through there?

And also since Neptune in the 7th applies to every Tom, Dick and Hairy
on the street, as well as to any doctors or "experts" in any field in
regards to me, I need to just retreat to the 12th house and stay there
for 10 years. Is that correct? I know -- take up meditating and join a
meditation group for 10 years. Yeah, sure.

I don't think so!! Life is way too short to spend it alone puttering
with one's stuff, meditating to the belly button chakra, and waiting
for the reaper.

Best to You and Thank You for Your Input -- LL

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I am asking because there is this big
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cloud of confusion regarding what/who BML really is an represents in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; every astrogroup I have heard her discussed.

&gt;&gt; &gt;I think this is because there are too few studies/books/teaching websites
&gt;&gt; &gt;on the subject to get an agreeing handle on what it signifies. BML, as an
&gt;&gt; &gt;astrological point, has not been given serious consideration in astrology
&gt;&gt; &gt;until quite recently (as per
&gt;&gt; &gt;thousands of years of astrology), and from what I have personally read,
&gt;&gt; &gt;everything is based upon the feminism/Lilith myth.

&gt;&gt; RM: French astrologers were studying it (Mean Lunar Apogee) 70 years
&gt;&gt; ago, but the recent 'meanings' of MLA (or BML) were transferred from
&gt;&gt; the invisible satellite (Dark Moon/Black Moon).

&gt;Just for the record and to avoid confusion for anyone reading not yet aware
&gt;of the fact, Ray has personally chosen to change the astrologically given
&gt;name of the point 'Black Moon Lilith', deduced from Earth to Moon apogee, to
&gt;MLA. So there's no 'or BML' but rather (or MLA).
">

RM: It's the other way around actually. The Mean Lunar Apogee came
first, and it has been studied mostly by French astrologers since the
1930's until the present day. The "Lilith phenomena" became popular in
the 1980s after the Lilith myth was tacked on to the "meaning" of the
invisible satellite of the 19th century, but the material was was
eventually moved (lock, stock and barrel) over to the "French" Mean
Lunar Apogee, by declaration about a decade ago.

Do we have that straight now? I didn't change the name of anything. It
was the Lilith followers who recently began using a series of
alternative names for the "French" Dark Moon, aka the Mean Lunar
Apogee.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I have not seen 'Moon Lunar Apogee' or MLA yet referred to in any written
&gt;astrological texts.
">

RM: It's Mean Lunar Apogee, not Moon Lunar Apogee.

For any newcomers to this saga, the Lunar Apogee is the zodiac degree
that the Moon occupied at the time when it is furthest from the Earth
each month. These imaginary "points" (of True Apogee) do not occur in
the same place every month; they occur at wildly fluctuating positions
in the general vicinity of the previous Apogee, but over a period of
about 10 years the positions of a series of Lunar Apogees gradually
advance one full cycle.

The Mean Lunar Apogee at any given time is a completely artificial
"point" in space which is derived by dividing 10 years movement (or
one full cycle of True Apogees) into an average (or Mean) position --
hence the very descriptive term "Mean Lunar Apogee". Many astrologers
are now calling the Mean Lunar Apogee "Black Moon Lilith", plus a few
other similar sounding names in French, English and some other
languages.

The previous "Dark Moon - Lilith" of the 1980's which was associated
with the Invisible satellite, or "Earth's second Moon", seems to be
almost extinct now, but there is still much confusion if anyone comes
across either the "genuine" or the flakey ephemerides that were both
used for that non-existent body which should theoretically have been
20 times brighter than Venus (if one took any notice of the supposed
technical data for it). That strange "body" was said to have been
"invisible" (hence the "invisibility of women" myths associated with
it, and another school said it was an imaginary point.

The cyclic periods of the first Dark Moon - Lilith and the new one,
are vastly different. The astrological glyph [crescent Moon and cross]
which is used for the "new" Dark Moon - Lilith seems to have been
borrowed from the "invisible satellite" version, but I'm not sure
about that. If anyone has Ivy's "Lilith" book, it should become
apparent.

&gt;How does one test the value of the Ascendant or M.C. ? Same difference,

">

RM: The value of the Ascendant or MC (and Desc &amp; IC) can be tested
most easily by noting the frequency at which the standard text book
descriptions correspond with life events or traits in individuals.
They can also be tested (for many people, but not all) by simply
listing the planetary positions for a series of important event dates
-- including minor events that were "important on the day". This
process often reveals the MC/Asc degrees far more easily than any
planet or other point if a LOT of event dates are used.

One of the most common tests that astrologers apply to "check" an
Ascendant (and therefore by default the MC) is to assess a subject's
demeanor and life history in relation to their stated Rising Sign. It
is easier still, to check an Ascendant for approximate accuracy if a
person has a planet or luminary on or opposite the Ascendant; in fact
it's very often glaringly obvious to dedicated astrologers -- even
those who are fairly new to astrology.

In the case of BML (or the Mean Lunar Apogee) it would probably be
quite impossible to achieve anything *like* a bump in a graph if lots
of event dates were processed because the well known and well used
planets don't usually do that -- mostly because no single astrologer
ever records enough event dates from their own lives, nor have we
until recently begun to collate hundreds of other people's "event
dates" for that purpose.

If however the BML (or MLA) adherants ever put together an unambiguous
claim, then it would be possible to apply a test. We can't "test"
anything unless we ~have~ something to test. We can of course go on
fishing expeditions and SEE what transits of BML were in existence for
a series of similar events, or a batch of personal characteristics.
I've already done some of that to a fair extent, but if anyone has a
batch of data - either traits or events, then I am quite willing to
find what's there in relation to a LOT of other astrological factors,
at no cost of course. I can also put a graph up on a web page which
will show the distribution of aspects for any given test. For example,
if someone had a batch of dates for "marital separation", then I could
show a graph which depicts the position of BML in relation to the the
natal BML or the Ascendant, or the Moon/Neptune midpoint or lots of
other things.

I suppose what we need at this point is *some* sort of fishing
expedition, to show what can be done with a batch of data.
If BML adherants don't begin to do that, they'll never have a very
good concept of what's possible or what's involved in setting up some
honest counting of BML "hits and misses".

RM: I'd suggest that you make a "hypothetical claim" about BML for
testing purposes only, so you will see what's involved in testing a
real claim later on. For most people (if not all) such an exercise
quickly shows a great need for getting very specific and avoiding the
"cherry picking" of data - which is very common in astrology.

&gt;&gt; &gt; He could probably get therapy through his health insurance and maybe he

This is very true, Ray, especially since:

Plato praised “the man who pursues the truth by applying his pure and
unadulterated thought to the pure and unadulterated object, cutting
himself off as much as possible from his eyes and ears and virtually
all the rest of his body, as an impediment which by its presence
prevents the soul from attaining to truth and clear thinking.”
(Frederick, 1969)

Plato. In H. Frederick (Trans., 1967), The Last Days of Socrates.
England: Penguin.

Cooper (1997, p. 35) notes: The erotic imagery of the merging of lovers
is a common theme in the Zohar.  Jewish mystics generally agree that
the Song of Songs, with its allusions to love and sexuality, holds more
secrets of the universe than any other scriptural work.  For example,
concerning the verse “I am my beloved’s and his desire is towards me, “
the Zohar says, “The inner meaning of this verse is that stirring below
is accompanied by stirring above, for there is no stirring above until
there is stirring below.”

Ok 'stupid' quotes work, but "smart" quotes do not and be sure to
change all copied from a text editor into "Plain Text"  before pasting
into the reply box with the quotes that look like two straight slashes
like these:

Plato praised "the man who pursues the truth by applying his pure and
unadulterated thought to the pure and unadulterated object, cutting
himself off as much as possible from his eyes and ears and virtually
all the rest of his body, as an impediment which by its presence
prevents the soul from attaining to truth and clear thinking."
(Frederick, 1969)

And the proper quotes for this passage:

Cooper (1997, p. 35) notes: The erotic imagery of the merging of lovers
is a common theme in the Zohar.  Jewish mystics generally agree that
the Song of Songs, with its allusions to love and sexuality, holds more
secrets of the universe than any other scriptural work.  For example,
concerning the verse “I am my beloved’s and his desire is towards me,
"the Zohar says, "The inner meaning of this verse is that stirring
below is accompanied by stirring above, for there is no stirring above
until there is stirring below."

mystical Judaism. New York: Riverhead Books.

Here is the Google team's answer about all the double and sometimes
triple copies of posts when posting through Google Groups like Todd and
I sometimes do:

"Thank you for your reply. We have had reports of multiple posts of
replies. Our other users also reported that you can avoid double posts
if you don't use the Back button to return to a thread after you post a
reply. Use the link to the thread instead."

They must be beginner coders or this software would not be so darn

You are so very right in your conclusions, Ray. We all all have our
personal life-styles and I am more interested in the views on the
charts and astrology I write about, not regarding my fun time.

Take my mom for instance -- after she went to the medical division to
be carved on by the medical students as a donated cadaver body of 90
year old, I had to empty out her apartment.

There was a bottle of KY Liquid by mom's bed and there were no 70-80
year old friends hanging about, so I have to suspect that she had a boy
toy of 60 or so from what I heard from a friend of hers. So maybe I
have a genetic problem. LOL

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; RM: I think LL was (as always) looking for good astrological input,
&gt; and like all of us, hoping that there was someone good enough or
&gt; interested enough to spot things in the charts which they had more
&gt; experience with. She is too good an astrologer to wander into a
&gt; newsgroup looking for &quot;agreement&quot;. She is one of the brightest
&gt; astrologers on aamod and she lives in the real world quite well, so
&gt; even if by chance she wanted &quot;agreement&quot;, she would be too astute to
&gt; give any hint of it, so I'd suggest we  take her comments at face
&gt; value - which is how we should treat all posters.

&gt; It seems quite obvious that Libralove doesn't need much in the way of
&gt; free advice about how to conduct her life, so a lot of the comments
&gt; were irrelevant to the issue - especially the critical ones. I've made
&gt; a list of them here and they're awful.

&gt; &gt;Neptune, ruler 8th house, is in a long-term transit over a Descendant in
&gt; &gt;Aquarius. How do you tell someone to break with the addictive habit before
&gt; &gt;it destroys you, without offending their finer senses?

&gt; RM: Hahaha, this is astonishing. LL is quite happy, but she just wants
&gt; to be happier :-)
">

Ray is correct again. He must be psychic. LOL I am happy. I am just a
lot happier when he is around and close to me -- I laugh a lot when he
is near when I am kissing him.

People's lives do not stop just because Neptune is parked on their
descendant, Christine, and no matter who it might be who could
represent that T. Neptune. He is the BEST. What better use of a double
Neptune trine Venus to exhaust all that Neptunian energy? Just take
those Neptunes in Libra and Scorpio and just use it up. :)

"Kiss me, make me drunk with your kisses

Your sweet loving is better than wine. ...

All the young women want you" [1.2, 3b]

-- The Song of Songs

The  Song of Songs, written by Solomon, relates joy experienced through
sensual connection - man with woman, flesh with flesh.   It relates
the joy and wisdom we experience when we experience  our connectedness
with one another and with the rest of God's  creation, living and
non-living.  When we experience oneness with the created universe.
Truth and wisdom here are illuminated  by love of flesh.

There is just a couple of lil problems and one of his is -- Mars in
Aries square Saturn in Capricorn --&gt; The Father of Sadism had it:

http://groups.msn.com/HOROSCOPESCHAT/astrologytopics1.msnw?action=get...

J.K.! Oh well... :)

Ok, back to Juno and Hera -- according to Martha Lang-Wescott the queen
of asteroids, talks these two goddesses.

With these two asteroids around, we are talking "equality issues" and
she calls them "Pluto Relationship Points" because they have to do with
inequities in relationships that you women have been so careful to make
sure that I notice. LOL

This means that people keep tabs -- 'bean counting' is in order between
the people in relationships with Hera and Juno involved -- I do this
for you, so then you need to do this for me, etc. It is "bartering"
like I have mentioned before between people.

Juno an Hera issues are about the balance being out of whack. Did you
notice maybe... mine is? ;)

Those asteroids add information and detail to the chart and/or the
synastry than you can get with just the nodes, Venus and descendant
alone. The asteroids fill in the gaps and this why I have come to use
them a lot. They can add amazing detail to the natal as well as the
synastry.

Right now we have T. Pluto conjunct his Juno (my vertex) in his 2nd
house. That same T. Pluto is in my 5th house trine my Mars conjunct
Jupiter on my Ascendant in Leo. So I have done some serious body
renovation at the gym and I am still losing weight and going nightly to
the gym. NO, no liposuction!

The asteroids are a way of giving information that causes an astrologer
to make a single planet or two have to mean everything from soup to
nuts -- the asteroids separate out the wheat from the shaft and into
details.

The inequalities, Pluto and Juno issues show clearly in the 2005 SRs
and he has just had his and mine is June 28 -- so there is a month when
it is my 04 SR overlaid on his 05 SR, then after June 28th -- we have a
1 year new situation occuring. I'll put up some chart examples of what
I call SR Synastry.

CB Willis (a poster here) has a really interesting synastry article on
her site. Some interesting interpretations. I wish she would contribute
more directly and frequently here:

http://www.astrologynow.com/carolwillis/Synastry.txt

I have immunology drawings to do by tomorrow, so it will be a day or so
before I can do a show and tell of SR synastry charts with
Juno/Pluto/Chiron aspects as examples of issues.

Best to You All -- LL

Christine,

Why would your and Heather's opinion/judgment of my personal
relationship(s) be of any interest whatsoever of mine or others on this
group. Does this make you two feel somehow superior?

I would never presume to make value judgments on your marriage or
Heather's personal life and/or partner's if any.  Not that you would
have the nerve to share any details on a usenet newsgroup -- there is
anonymity here. No one but those that I do offline personal readings
for know my name or yours unless you chose to give it. So what is the
big deal with giving some personal details to fill in the details of
some of these asteroids and planetary pictures I am interested in.

What is wrong with your commenting on the astrology instead. Astrology
DOES WORK. You describe how you think T. Pluto at 23 Sag in the 8th on
his N. Juno (other person's vertex) opp Venus in Gem in the 05-SR might
work. It is cosmic square Moon exactly conjunct Mars in Pisces
intercepted in the 11th house opposite Pallas in Virgo intercepted in
the 5th for the Precessed.

Or...His non-precessed 05SR has Moon conjunct Uranus in Pisces riding
the 7th house SR cusp and opp my N. Chiron T-square his Sun exactly on
the MC and T-sqaure to SR Pallas in his 1sy house -- the women's lib
asteroid. Feminist issues.

While SR Pluto in Sag on his N. Juno opposes his SR Venus in the 10th
house at 25 Gem. Then swing a Grand Trine off his Juno-Node at 20-23
Aries in the 8th, trine SR Pluto 23 Sag (his Juno=my vertex), exactly
trine my Natal Mars-Jupiter conjunction at 21-24 Leo in the 12th house
of his 05-SR.

Come on women. This is an astrology group, is it not? Shall I put up
some charts? I need to get started on my screenplay outline and read
some Aristotle's "Poetics". I also have to run to the gym as they close
early on weekend unfortunately. I like to go at 10-12 midnight.

Christine commented in one thread that she was glad to hear someone
describe actual personal events connected to transits, etc. -- then
turn around and scour me with personal judgments against my description
of a romantic relationship of 13 years. Why?

One of my friends on this group can probably explain why pain,
pleasure, dominance and submission are part and parcel of many
relationships including yours in all likihood unless you have a truly
perfect balance of power between you.

Can you not look at the synastry and see why the connection is so
powerful? Can you not recognize that relationships are not always
smooth and people frequently work through their personal issues when
involved with others in romance, especially when Venus, Moon, Chiron,
Ceres, Pluto and Juno are strongly configured between the two people.

Why not use astrology to judge what is going on in the aspects? Why
promote your personal opinions of the sort of relationship that you
prefer?

The relationship detail that I describe indicates the dark and the
light of a relationship (all relationhips have "dark" and "light" to
one degree or another).  Have you never heard "My husband is a great
provider and father, but he never wants to hear when I am emotionally
upset about something," or something similar? Have you never heard, "My
husband is a great father for our children, but rarely has any time for
me alone". Think of the thousands of possible miseries we hear daily
about in regards to so-called "committed" relationships between
partners or lovers.

Few are actually truly "committed" however or we would NOT have a
divorce rate at over 50%, so...

There is something negative in almost every so-called "committed
relationship" that I have every heard of -- my best friends of 30+
years have been together except a brief separation of about 5 years
when he dumped her and became a bachelor in Manhattan in the '70's.
Then they came back together and have been together ever since without
any sex whatsoever for the past 20 years. Good for you gals? Right? She
constantly criticizes him also, and he is such a really nice and
handsome guy.

I saw that couple in March 2004 when I went to Florida for an
astrological financial conference in Naples with Arch Crawford,
Merriman and Grace Morris on using astrology to predict the stock
market --they were right btw -- a bad year or so in the market. Want to
hear about one major astrologer's marriage from my eyes and my friends
phone callls to his home? JK! I learned from it, but would never tell
it in case you might conect the details with a name.

Then my woman friend in NYC, who at about 10 years into the marriage in
the '80's -- her husband announced that he was "done with having sex"
so she started advertising in the newspapers for lunchtime connections
in mid-town Manhattan and was having "hot lunches" with businessmen.
She is a very literate and intelligent professional woman I have known
for years and she and her husband come to Texas for birding when they
are not traveling the exotic areas of the globe.

I have been collected all the chart data of all my friends and their
marriages/lovers. So I should have a pretty good data base for Ray at
some point to run through JigSaw -- the good, the bad and the ugly
relationships. LOL

The facts of the reality of my relationship are involved in my research
of this particular person's chart in relationship to mine by aspects
and planetary relationships -- both his natal, my natal and the aspects
between. I have known and been in contact with him for 13 years -- give
or take 4-5 years of total absence, and he truly is the best, most
erotic and most attentive lover of my life-time.  Why is that a problem
for you ladies? He doesn't mow anything but my grass, I do the yard
work myself. :)

He does not buy my groceries or pay my mortgage, but since I own my
home (no mortgage) and I make enough to supply my own food needs -- I
actually like the independence with erotic episodes, but it may come to
end when I live with someone next year for more companionship and
sharing and less isolation. That is unless I am so busy writing movie
screenplays that I do not care if anyone is around. Writing is very
solitary, but having a great partner for some erotic play sure makes
the week fly by. :)

Some of the women friends around my age after 2-3 marriages, have just
become lesbians for companionship, and then the males just keep
marrying  -- like my first husband and his brother are just with their
5th wives and one is single after the 5th. LOL As Mr. Man says, "He and
his brother are just marrying their girlfriends".  So Mr. Man, just
keeps having girlfriends... for 20 years, and me as the standby erotic
connection as the others run away. ;)

Neither of those choices sound viable to me, so...

I have only had about 5 long-term relationships, my first lover in
college (dead), my first husband (married 5 times), my long time and
still friend and lousy lover in NYC (6 years), my last husband (happy
for 8 years), and Mr. Man my erotic sometime lover for 13 years.

The rest of the time I was a single hard working art director on the
Upper West Side New York City and Club Med, and then here raising my
son and my business for 13 years alone. :) I could have written that
"Sex and the Single Girl". I was so exhausted from my job in publishing
unfortunately did not get to have as much fun as I might have -- slept
through a lot of weekends.

When I was 40 I broke up with an 18 year old I was dating (movies,
concerts) in order to marry my husband who was 20 years old at the
time. It was my best relationhsip in every way and the main reason we
broke up (his compulsive shopping)  is still going on (according to our
son) with his present and latest partner.

Pain and pleasure is mixed, and only enhance the feelings and
contribute to the feeling of love in recent studies.

I need to post that URL on that study for you as well. Have you women
been married so long (or alone) that you do not remember the pleasure
and the pain of romantic love? Or did you meet, get along perfectly
(and still do), agree to financial arrangements between you two, and
then sign the legal papers at the courthouse? And now happily ever
after. Sure!! LOL

It has been a great "study" for me and may or may not ever become a
relationship similar to anything that you two women may have had, if
you have one, but that is probably not what I am looking for to be
honest.  I do not not know about your relationships, but I am fairly
sure I would likely run like crazy away from someone you might chose to
share your life with.

That is why life is so interesting. We are all so different. :) Right,
ladies?

I look better than ever, shop at Victoria's Secret, have perfect
health, diet and go to the gym daily. How can you say this relationship
is NOT beneficial and important to share the synastry in regards to the
astrology of it. The only difference is I share the bad with the good
and most people obfuscate the negative and lie that their partners are
just perfect. Am I right?

My dermatologist says my skin looks great thanks to my grandmother and
mother's genes and a little Renova. Like Grace Kelly, I may have
inherited a bit more than good skin from my relatives, if you get my
drift from her biographies. ;)

So... move on, ladies. There must be other better stuff for you to
direct your negative attentions to besides poking fun at my personal
relationships.

Yes Ray, and he is a "lawyer" so... Amazing how you picked that up in
what I wrote about him. He should have extra leeway for that reason
alone.

He sometimes asks me to describe something without the "spin" and also
with fewer pronouns. When talking astrology he asks that I please not
speak in "Klingon" (astrologize) and to tell him what something
"really" means.

His Hi-Dek Gemini Mercury is so amazing to me! I just love it! What a
mental turn-on he is as well as a physical lover. Lots of practise in
both I guess. I can visualize his frown as I wrote that last sentence.
LOL

He has written a lot of law briefs that I get to read them in a legal
newsletter I get every quarter or so. He is super precise in his
articles with his Pluto in Virgo in the 10th house. Even when he is
posting on Usenet hobby groups, there is never a mispelled word or
improper sentence structure, but I have seen him absolutely brutal to
some on some of those groups as well.

Ii is probably partly his training along with the Mars in Aries square
Capricorn and his Jupiter (legal truths - the facts and only the facts
ma'am) at 1 Capricorn, powerful near the Aries point.

So it has to do with his job and training (as well as his chart of
course) --- following up on all the facts, just like you guessed, Ray.
So I need to consider that before I take it so personally as a lack of
trust. Thank you for that insight.

Heather,

I don't have to stop making comments like those as long as I obey the
rules of the group and post on topic with astrological content. This is
an astrological newsgroup, is it not? Do you have something to add
astrologically to those posts?

Have you never heard a basically happy person complain about a lover or
a husband? What is your supposed bewilderment regarding a few
complaints about a lover? Must all lovers be "perfect" in your view and
supply all wants and desires?

States of happiness with some unhappiness in regards to some issues are
NOT mutually exclusive, in fact it is the occasional pain and the
pleasure that makes life so alive and vibrant, IMO.

Or are you just working on trying to rip me a new A.Hole like you
bragged that you did to that poor guy that you mentioned here recently.
Was that over on AA or were you able to get away with that sort of
thing here on this moderated group?

Are you the group's metaphorical self-proclaimed verbal rapist? Since
you have also acknowledged that you do not care that much for women in

If I wanted to narcissistically address a mirror, I would have done so,

a sense of communal sharing on a common interest -- astrology.

What I see here with your posts regarding me is what I experienced when
I lurked for 2 years -- some people who love to argue and debate
practically anything and everything BUT astrology. Only a handful post
much astrology -- the others were arguing semantics, definitions,
personal views on other people's issues, etc. blah... blah...

Your personal opinion of my life and happiness, H, has nothing to do
with MY reality. You seem to be experiencing your own sad reality
through me and my comments. I am very sorry if that is the case. I hope

&gt; the Song of Songs, with its allusions to love and sexuality, holds more
&gt; secrets of the universe than any other scriptural work. For example,
&gt; concerning the verse, &quot;I am my beloved's and his desire is towards me,&quot;
&gt; the Zohar says, &quot;The inner meaning of this verse is that stirring
&gt; below is accompanied by stirring above, for there is no stirring above
&gt; until there is stirring below.&quot;

Madonna is opening her new Kaballah-style hotel in London soon.

http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,16735,00.html

I finally watched her "Truth or Dare" the other night about her 1990
Blonde Ambition tour. Whew... what a woman with cahones... makes me
look like a milky-toast style liberated woman. She is an exhibitionist
deluxe and so strong to stand up for what she calls her beliefs and her
"art"!

Mars square Uranus -- a touch rebellious sexually perhaps? LOL

Venus at 0 Leo.

I dislike astro sites that put charts up without the Deks. That is half
the information missing in a natal chart, IMO, -- agreeing with Kt
Boehrer.

She has the "super rich" Dek from birth that I have mentioned here
before -- I am telling you, if you find that little gold brick (Chiron
// Jupiter) in someone's chart, they ARE super rich or they WILL be
super rich! I keep seeing it over and over in wealthy people's charts
since the Magi people wrote about it.

Madonna's Sun is square AND // Mars (so it is super juiced up) -- and
that is why she is so sexual and so very athletic, IMO -- If you have
ever watched one of her shows. Whew... the Mars energy is over the
top!!

She's more "over the top" than me, Ray. LOL

She is so amazing to me and with Pallas at 00N Dek in Leo and her Venus
is in Leo at 00 Longitude -- no wonder she is so for women's sexual
rights. Pallas is for fairness and women's issues and I have it
conjunct my high-dek Mercury in Cancer.

She has Chiron /-/ Juno and that config just oozes with sensuality and
sexuality. My Mr. Man has Chiron // Juno and he is a very sexy guy! I
can just imagine what the women at his office must be thinking when he
passes by. :)

Best to All -- LL

Dear LL,
If you read the increasing multitude of exchange of posts in this thread,
you will find that I haven't stated any personal opinions or made any
judgments about your personal relationships which, as you say, don't
interest me and is none of my business whatsoever anyway. What I ~have~ done
is, when asked, offered an opinion regarding astrological aspects which, as
you have said yourself, can refer to many people. What I have learnt from
astrology is that the planets do not judge; they offer perspectives.
If offering a perspective of the outcome of any aspect is seen on your part
as judgmental, then I am guilty of the charge regarding my interpretation of
the aspect,
but not of any application to your own relationships.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I would never presume to make value judgments on your marriage or
&gt; Heather's personal life and/or partner's if any.
&gt;Not that you would
&gt; have the nerve to share any details on a usenet newsgroup -- there is
&gt; anonymity here.

Now *that* IS a personal opinion and judgment.

&gt;No one but those that I do offline personal readings

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; big deal with giving some personal details to fill in the details of

Did I ever say otherwise?
I have been particularly interested in your ideas of how the different
asteroids work, which I then try to apply to a planetary aspect  that could
provide the same outcome.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; trine my Natal Mars-Jupiter conjunction at 21-24 Leo in the 12th house

">

I believe this was all mentioned in your first posts of a now very long
thread which has since taken many a side turn, when I offered an opinion of
whether Jupiter's aspects could provide the same answers as Juno. You
replied that it didn't. I accept your reply from the vision of one who works
with, and stresses importance upon the position of asteroids. I don't work
with asteroids or precessed charts, so couldn't offer any suggestions as to
how they would work, even if I wanted to. Which is why I continue to be so
surpised at your 'sudden turn' regarding anything I write that in any way is
an alternative idea to what you, yourself, perceive to be true. You have
said that you incur this same state at many astro.groups of which you are a
part. I think that is the strength as well as the weakness upon which such
groups are built.

Once again your opinion and personal judgment, LL.
I can't recall ever 'scouring' you......incidentally, what a wonderful word
to add to BML concepts.
I could tell you what I 'do' think of you from impressions gained through
your posts, but that would be expressing a personal judgment and therefore
unfitting for a place that deals with agreement and alternative perspectives
of
thought.

Pleasure and pain, dominance and submission, are two sides of the same coin.
I
would think one needs to undergo both in order to find the balance within
their separate powers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From your comment of a couple of women with BML in Virgo feeling like
">

"a slab of meat" during sex, then IMO there is a lot more going on in
that regard besides just BML in Virgo -- too general.

Singling out BML in a sign alone is is not good, IMO, you need to know
the house placement, the aspects to other planets, and more than just
that. I would especially want to know the birthdata of the man or men
who "made them feel this way".

I have never allowed myself to stay in a position with any man where I
was made to feel that way. Some men could probably make any woman feel
that way, but I have not felt that way with my present lover, nor would
I have seen him again after the first event, if I had felt that way.

We are much better together now than it ever was in 1992. I joke and
mention "all his practise" since 1992 (he frowns), but I know that it
is not that -- time together produces more intimacy and closeness. That
is why some couples say sex is better than ever after 30 years or
whatever. I agree -- the erotic bond grows as long as there are not
other negative things going on between them to destroy it.

Like constant nagging and criticalness of the partner (at them all day
long) -- will destroy sexual intimacy pretty fast, IMO.

That sort of feeling a woman might have is when a man is making love
and he has disassociated his erotic and sexual feelings from her. He
may not really be into her or maybe he is angry at her. Some men marry
women whom they are not really into or the women are not really into
them -- so it would be easy to have this sort of feeling in that case.
Some men try to have sex with women who verbally abuse them and put
them down all day long, then they are probably disasociated from her
and just having sex.

My second boyfriend in college was like that. He did not really engage
eye to eye, mouth to mouth, and fully intently into being into me =
intimacy. Doggie style is frequently used by those guys and the women
who also do not want to connect head on with intimacy.

He asked me to marry him and said he would marry no other and he never
did, but I felt no connection with him during sex. He became gay after
being in the Navy in Vietnam and he has since died of AIDS. I am still
in contact with his mother. Her story of his life was he never felt
love from his father.

He was August 27, 1942, 12:40 pm, Dallas, TX. I see his Mars is at
16Virg42 and my BML is 14Virg32, so.. his Mars was conjunct my BML.

That Mars in Virgo was unbelievably "crtical" and "clean" and
"perfect". He was an architect and an amazing artist. He was extremely
talented, but I think the lack of love he felt from his father caused
him to NOT be able to connect strongly to a woman. Or maybe he was born
"gay". I do not know for certain.

I have read and heard that it is the relationship of the male to the
father that makes a man have normal desires for a woman and a wife --
otherwise, he is always looking for a father to love him. Many become
homosexual and this man had many "partners" over the years and never
settled for long with any one of them. So he died of AIDS.

I rejected him in college because he was too physically endowed and I
felt no intimacy with him during sex -- just pain. I was very young, 20
years old and I was not very loving and kind to him when we broke up.
It is one of things I regret most in my life. Sometimes it takes many
years to learn to be loving and kind to someone rather than severe and
rejecting. Young people frequently have not learned compassion for
others -- sometimes it takes many years to develop compassion.

His Venus was on my Ascendant (so he was thrilled to be seen on my arm
and introduced to friends and family), but his BML was 0Can0 exactly on
my Saturn at 1 Cancer. He took me home to see his mother, father and
brother and asked me to marry, but his inability to connect to me
during sex and his genital size were the two main reasons I married my
first husband instead.

The man I marrried/divorced (presently in his 5th marriage) has BML at
18Taurus35. My Mars is 21 Leo and my Juno is 16 Taurus. His Chiron is
on my Pluto. But I see little if any connection to that BML but the
Juno conjunction -- wife = BML

My last husband has BML at 3 Sag and that would be trine my Ceres at 3
Leo and sextile my Moon at 5 Libra. We were married for 8 years and
there was a 20 yr age difference.

So the BML Ceres-Moon connection might have to do with my reversal of
societal standards -- 40 year old male marries 20 year old female and
teaches her everything -- driving a car, balancing a checkbook,
speaking in English, and reading a map. Then she can't stop shopping so
they get a divorce. LOL

My situation was exactly the reverse of the normally male situation of
mid-life crisis. In my case it was, biological clock crisis and I could
find no one my age or older I felt connected to at 40 and being a
Cancerian -- I wanted a child.

My man friend previous to this  young man I married was 10 years older,
wanted no more children, waa a dud in bed and a grumpy old man out of
bed -- with lots of money to spend on me, and we are still friends
since 1976 --because we have a Neptune-Chiron like all my many year
friends and my lover have.

That old lover and now old friend (we speak about once a week by phone)
has his BML at 10 Leo which is near my Pluto at 7 Leo in my 12th house.
He took me everywhere. He was a big-shot record producer and he took me
to meet Dolly Parton backstage before she became famous -- 3rd row
center tickets for every thing from hot broadway shows to the opera to
Studio54 to rock shows.

My BML at 14 Virg is on his Neptune at 13Virgo45, and it is trine his
Moon in Taurus, my BML is 14Virg32. We were together about 6 years. The
sex was lousy, he was cranky and cruel so I just wandered off after
awhile and got busy dating younger men who did not aske me to go out
and buy them "Herb-Lax" at midnight and drop it next door to his
apartment. I prefer men without bowel issues. LOL

So what do you make of all those BMLs, Christine? I married some of
them. And they all wanted to be seen with me their arm. So...?

Normally, any writer that has written something about an asteroid or
point, I can go back through my files and connect up charts that work
with their theories. To be honest, I have heard nothing but the
negative about BML here, and so I cannot imagine that it can ONLY be a
negative point. Even Hades has its positive side -- antiques, the
previously marrried, etc.

I'll happily supply all birthdata to you private if you wish for your
research. The men I have bee involved with are all reasonable people so
I see no problem with it. In fact I asked Mr. Man if I could give his
data to Robert Blaskche for a reading.

His response was, "Sure, I'm not using it. He can have it."

Best to You, Christine, and happy to oblige with lots of astrology
conected to my stories! -- LL

Sharyn tried to rip a new one, as you so poetically like to call

You seem to have a similar MO -- thinking you can say anything you wish
to anyone and then blame them for making you say it, because the person
was naive enough to share something personal with you lurking.

Then that information becomes an opening to attack their spirituality,
their personality, their enjoyment of physical pleasures, their
personal tastes, their recent personal losses, their relationship
issues all become fodder for your cruelty and unkindness, etc. But all
in the name of sharing your helpful opinion about the person. Yeah,
right!

And no, I do not take credit for the incredible nasty attack she made

Deep? Did you say "deep"? ;) I said genital size AND his lack of
conectedness (intimacy) during sex. 2 important things! Having my BML
in Virgo means I'll NEVER feel like a "piece of meat' with any man more
than once or twice. LOL Write that down, Christine in column C for BMLs
in Virgo.

Size is VERY importsnt if you like it 2-3 times a day sometimes.
Obviously, that is not a desire of yours and that's Ok. Really, it is.
Is that a problem for you that I enjoy sexuality that much? You can be
the way you are. No problem or condemnation from me on it.

Sex=Love, IMO. When I love someone -- I cannot get enough of making
love to them for years ongoing. I never get bored or tired of them.

Even sadists and masochists need love. Doncha think, H?

The only thing that has ever stopped me (slowed me down) was heavy
career responsibilities and child rearing. Child rearing is over --
so....:) LOL

&gt; in the name of sharing your helpful opinion about the person. Yeah,
&gt; right!

&gt; And no, I do not take credit for the incredible nasty attack she made
&gt; against another poster or any on me either for that matter. I am not a
&gt; member of the &quot;blame the victim&quot; mentality.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not like cruelty and verbal abuse.

&gt; &gt; Sure you do--you're dating it.

&gt; But the pain is soooooo G-O-O-D! And only from him -- and his *ick is
&gt; sooooo P-E-R-F-E-C-T! And he goes for hours and hours sometimes... :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; I prefer hedonism over cruelty
&gt; &gt; &gt; any day, and your words to me thus far are anything but &quot;spiritual&quot;,
&gt; &gt; &gt; IMO, I perceive you as &quot;cruel&quot;, so it seems that you also have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; Neptune problem.

&gt; &gt; Bluntness is not the same as cruelty.

&gt; I know the difference and so do others that have written me recently
&gt; offline and posted rebuttal here as well. They got the same message I
&gt; did -- a personal attack thinly veiled as misguided concern for my
&gt; welfare and for no apparent reason except to further your individual
&gt; value agenda against my personal lifetstyle choice.

&gt; Why don't you just get rid of that hard on you have for me, Heather,
&gt; change your panties, and try to cooperate with some sharing of
&gt; astrological knowledge here.

&gt; &gt; Like I said before, if you don't want
&gt; &gt; opinions from others that are diametrically opposed to your own, then
just
&gt; &gt; go to the bathroom and talk loudly to the mirror.

&gt; I think I covered that already. -- Can you not move on from your and
&gt; Christine's cute lil mirror joke? I understand that your opinions
&gt; differ from mine. Got it!

&gt; &gt; As far as spirituality,
&gt; &gt; hell, why would I even waste my breath talking to you about something
deep,
&gt; &gt; when you are someone who decides a guy is only worth marrying, based
upon
&gt; &gt; his genital size.

&gt; Deep? Did you say &quot;deep&quot;? ;) I said genital size AND his lack of
&gt; conectedness (intimacy) during sex. 2 important things! Having my BML
&gt; in Virgo means I'll NEVER feel like a &quot;piece of meat' with any man more
&gt; than once or twice. LOL Write that down, Christine in column C for BMLs
&gt; in Virgo.

&gt; Size is VERY importsnt if you like it 2-3 times a day sometimes.
&gt; Obviously, that is not a desire of yours and that's Ok. Really, it is.
&gt; Is that a problem for you that I enjoy sexuality that much? You can be
&gt; the way you are. No problem or condemnation from me on it.

&gt; Sex=Love, IMO. When I love someone -- I cannot get enough of making
&gt; love to them for years ongoing. I never get bored or tired of them.

&gt; Even sadists and masochists need love. Doncha think, H?

&gt; The only thing that has ever stopped me (slowed me down) was heavy
&gt; career responsibilities and child rearing. Child rearing is over --
&gt; so....:) LOL

The reply wasn't *aimed at you* but a metaphorical reminder of what can
happen when
talking to the mirror.
One might not always get the answer (from one's inner self) that one was
expecting because the mirror never lies, except in a 'fun house' at the
fair.
E.g. Chris, "That outfit looks o.k."
Reflection. " God, you could do with losing some pounds."

However, one should also remember that the story ended with Snow White being
carried off by her
prince.

I don't think so. She only repeated your own words which had led several
people to believe you were unhappy about a situation; she did not make them
up herself.
Like you, H is a very good astrologer. Also, like you, she's very direct and
doesn't mince her words.
H has Sun in Virgo; you have BML in Virgo. A mirror image?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;From your comment of a couple of women with BML in Virgo feeling like
&gt; &quot;a slab of meat&quot; during sex, then IMO there is a lot more going on in
&gt; that regard besides just BML in Virgo -- too general.
">

Of course there is more going on which will be shown by the planets, just as
there is with all those Gemini
Suns you mentioned that didn't like to be touched.

The 'point' is that Virgo deals with the natural perfect state of one's
self, which includes the physical body in which it is housed, and how it
functions, is maintained and utilised. So, imho, BML in Virgo will, amongst
other things, bring feelings regarding Virgo's adequacy/inadequacy of its
natural traits to the surface. And such can include feelings regarding a
perfectly natural OR un-natural state or use of the body, as well as feeling
totally in-or-ill placed in any Virgo-type function, ranging from office
managership or cleaning, to acknowledging the power of, and working with
natural products and flower remedies.

You appear to be totally proud of the perfect state of your body and you
utilise it in a way that comes 'naturally' to YOU.
But what if what is natural to you is NOT a natural state in the minds of
other people? Through their eyes they can look upon your natural trait and
behaviour pattern as 'unacceptable', just as the lady above found what
happened to her body unacceptable tghrough her eyes. Each of you in your own
way attacks the feelings that others have of your 'natural traits', that
differ from your own. I'd say that that is a positive outlet of BML in
Virgo.

An interesting observation about the female BML's in Virgo ( and in the 6th
house) is that all  possess(ed) a good business sense, 'inwardly felt' that
they are/were very proficient at what they did and were able to hold their
own with their male counterparts. They *effused* a quality that made their
presence felt, so to speak. (BML in Libra, for instance, would (not) be
aware of the in-equality involved).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Singling out BML in a sign alone is is not good, IMO,

The same could be said of any planet and/or angle, yet specific qualities
ARE given to them in a particular sign which are not found in another.
That's basic astrology, isn't it?

you need to know

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the house placement, the aspects to other planets, and more than just

That certainly provides more information to work with but, as with the
planets, it isn't always possible. Yet, when I hear several people make the
same comment, or undergo the same feeling experience, and their BML (or
particular planet) is in the same sign, *that* gives me something to
consider and work with. I'm sure you must do the same with what your friends
and clients say.

Would you associate his 'not' being able to connect to women (correlating to
not connecting with feeling) a trait of his
BML in Cancer? Or is there a planetary or asteroid placing to suggest this?

I ask because my eldest daughter has a heavily aspected BML in Cancer in the
4th house. Issues regarding what she FELT she should and should not do in
order 'to belong' that produced dire consequences. It took her a long while
to 'express' her feelings by way of a hug and embrace, even though she
inwardly wanted and needed to. She had some 'weird' feeling that I didn't
care as much for her as for her siblings.
OTOH, My husband has Moon in Cancer in a T-square opp. Mercury, square
Neptune in Libra.
I have yet to see him 'willingly' embrace anyone, although he enjoys being
embraced.

With Sagittarius, I'd be more inclined to think of cultural/religious rather

BML in Sag. appears to show highly developed minds but not always the

A person should be able to share a loss or a complaint about a
situation, and not expect it to be tossed back as a list of quotes that
they are an unhappy, miserable person, and they just need to face it --

miserable and unhappy you are!

Sorry, Christine, but that is very hostile, IMO -- plain and simple.

No one likes to be told how "to feel" from the other person's
perspective. I have not presumed to offer my opinions on her negative
attitude toward sexuality. So no, I have not given back in like kind.

And I have also never expressed sex as the "most important thing" to me
as she relayed that I said -- I never said that -- She said that sex is
the most important thing for me. Wrong again. I truly enjoy it, but it
is NOT the most important thing to me -- health and happiness is -- sex
fits well with those two things.

Because I lost my mom 2 years ago and my son went to college and my man
friend is not as supportive as I would like -- I was deemed a miserable
and unhappy person, and a list of why I should be as she perceives, was
tossed back at me. What gives her the right to make such a judgement
under any circumstances of another person's feelings?

A body is either in healthy shape and NOT, obese, or it is NOT in

kills. All facts.

That is not a personal attack on anyone -- it is a simple medical fact.
If it is deemed a health problem, it is better to focus on the problem
and fix it through diet and exercise as soon as one can.

remarks, then they are usually not permitted for very long on this

&gt;&gt; &gt; More Neptunian smoke-blowing. That's okay, it comes natural to you. If
&gt;&gt; &gt; memory serves me you had some serious problems with Sharyn as well.
&gt;&gt; &gt; That's no coincidence, because she didn't much care for people
who BS other
&gt;&gt; &gt; people, either.

&gt;&gt; Sharyn had a verbal problem, as do you, IMO, -- using very severe and
&gt;&gt; cutting words against others in a cruel manner. I can point to the
&gt;&gt; posts that still exist in her past, but like old newspaper -- it's only
&gt;&gt; fit for fish.

&gt;Sharyn was and still is an exceptionally bright woman LL. Anyone with a
&gt;modicum of intelligence would know that about her.
">

RM: This sounds like a red herring because there has been no
suggestion that Sharyn is not bright.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I happened to read all
&gt;the crap between you two and by no means was it one-sided. Do you ever take
&gt;responsibility for your role in anything?
">

RM: This sounds like another red herring because there has been no
denial of the facts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I do not like cruelty and verbal abuse.

&gt;Sure you do--you're dating it.
">

RM: That is quite illogical. One does not necessarly like negative
things just because they experience them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I prefer hedonism over cruelty
&gt;&gt; any day, and your words to me thus far are anything but &quot;spiritual&quot;,
&gt;&gt; IMO, I perceive you as &quot;cruel&quot;, so it seems that you also have a
&gt;&gt; Neptune problem.

&gt;Bluntness is not the same as cruelty.  Like I said before, if you don't want
&gt;opinions from others that are diametrically opposed to your own, then just
&gt;go to the bathroom and talk loudly to the mirror.
">

RM: You seem to have missed the point entirely. The idea was to
discuus the charts in a non-inflammatory manner, and disagreement was
(and still is) welcome.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As far as spirituality,
&gt;hell, why would I even waste my breath talking to you about something deep,
&gt;when you are someone who decides a guy is only worth marrying, based upon
&gt;his genital size.

RM: How can we get anywhere with astrological discussion when the
facts are misrepresented like this?

&gt; &gt;&gt; It just makes it common.

&gt; &gt;&gt;From your own past history in relationships sometimes one settles for
&gt; &gt;awhile because one part is very good and you try to ignore the other
&gt; &gt;less enjoyable parts -- then one day -- it's enough already and you
&gt; &gt;move on. Am I correct?

&gt; Absolutely. But gentle stalking is still stalking (attempts at
&gt; control).

Stalking? Someone is stalking someone? I missed it I guess. I am
unaware of any stalking. I know he reads everything I write if he can
find it -- and he is a very good "Googler" is this what you are talking
about?

&gt; &gt;LOL. You might get lucky with that kiss, but old Usenet astrology
&gt; &gt;buzzards, your're probably right about -- but it has gone beyond a
&gt; &gt;little &quot;rudeness&quot; IMO.

&gt; &gt;I can give as good as I get, if there is no escape and this group has

&gt; &gt;to battle about personal matters and life-styles.

&gt; I suggest to people who have some trouble with rude replies that they

Like I said, this is not H-Chat with 20 simulataneous thread and 3 or 4

&gt; &gt;I would rather just do readings for others,

&gt; That works.

&gt; &gt;so maybe if I offer nothing personal further

&gt; It's not really about that.

Oh I think you are wrong about that. It IS personal and it has to do
with a few differences -- both perceived and real.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;-- which are the things I know best of course -- then

&gt; think are over the top. There's no percentage in it.

I have been coached off-line (mostly by males), and that rarely works
if someone wants to get keep coming at you -- it is like school yard
stuff -- the school yard is just not big enough unfortunately -- you
will finally have to take up for yourself to get them to stop so you
can play (contribute).

Otherwise, you become the popular "victim" and draw more bullies to
you. Things are no different on school yards or Usenet groups, IMO --
same social interaction issues and group dynamics.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My observation is people who get defensive are just seeing an
&gt; uncomfortable part of their inner landscape mirrored back by others.

Yeah, sure. -- Defense is an important part of life whether it be
driving or school yard situations. Self-defense is a life-saving
mechanism and necessary.

Thanks for your suggestions anyway. Best to You -- LL

All good lawyers control the cross examination as Ray pointed out, and
he is one of the brightest. He has been cross-examining people for
about 5 years daily in appeals, so he may or may not even be aware of
what a badger he can be to get to the bottom of whatever the facts may
be. If I were a woman on the stand I would wilt into his arms. lol

Would you think a person with Mars in Aries in the 6th square Saturn in
Capricorn (3rd) and Venus in Gemini in the 8th T-square to Pluto in the
10th in Virgo and Chiron in the 4th in Pisces controlling? fothflol
