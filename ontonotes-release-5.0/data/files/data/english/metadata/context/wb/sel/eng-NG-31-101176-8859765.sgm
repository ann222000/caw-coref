Top 5 UK Concert Venues
Copyright (c) 2007 Bret Robson
Viagogo UK
http://www.viagogo.co.uk/

It's a mystery why certain venues become more synonymous with
great gigs than others. Much of the time it depends on what one
may be looking to get for the price of their ticket; great
acoustics, fun lighting, an exciting atmosphere - but one thing
for certain is some venues contribute more to a making a live
performance special than others.

Here, five top UK venues are put under the microscope in an
attempts to explain why this phenomenon might happen, so the next
time you buy your concert tickets, you might consider improving
on the experience by attending it at one of these top locations.

Top of most people's list, certainly if you ask the acts that
have ever played it, is the Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow
( http://www.glasgow-barrowland.com/ballroom.htm ).

Recently voted the second best small venue in Europe (it has a
capacity of 1900); it is located at the bottom end of the
Gallowgate, resplendent with a large rainbow façade. It has seen
almost every band in recent history gracing its famous stage,
from the Arctic Monkeys to All About Eve, and The Who to Robbie
Williams. All of them have come away from gigs at 'The Barras'
raving about the atmosphere it generates.

But what is it that makes this wooden-floored, sweaty 60's
throwback so appealing?

The answer is simplicity; the stage is the perfect height and
distance from the crowd (in your face all the time), and the
sound is condensed within the four walls creating a totally
awesome live music experience that sweeps everyone into a frenzy.

Glasgow audiences are amongst the toughest to please but the most
rewarding when you do, and when this happens in The Barrowland
the result is electric.

At number two there is no doubt the Brixton Academy
( http://www.brixton-academy.co.uk ) is as good a venue for a gig
as you will get anywhere in the world. A favourite for Ian Dury
and more recently, Madonna, this jewel in London's crown creates
an explosive and urban atmosphere, so that people continue to
snap tickets up for gigs there faster than Linford Christie does
100m.

The venue, run by Carling, has spread into other cities too, with
replicas of the interior being constructed to capitalise on the
successful layout the building affords. It's a simple
philosophy; create a classic look but with modern facilities, and
slope the crowd as far as they can go towards the stage.

In third place is a pub backroom that tops all small venues,
purely because of its history and openness to introduce new acts
to the music scene: The Dublin Castle
( http://www.bugbearbookings.com/pages/dc.htm ).

Found in Camden Town's Parkway, this pub is perhaps most famous
for being the home of Madness, but it has also been the heart of
a Camden musical enterprise that has seen the likes of Oasis and
Blur stake a claim.

The Dublin Castle stage is small, but its impact on the British
music scene proves it has punched over its weight for many years.
Catch a gig there if you can some night - a single ticket will
get you at least three bands for under a tenner, and the beer is
half bad either.

From the smallest to the largest now, and the title of best arena
venue in the UK goes to the Metro Radio Arena in Newcastle
( http://www.metroradioarena.co.uk ). Highly adaptable and with
superb facilities, this arena is a must-play venue to the hottest
live music acts on the go, as well as sporting occasions and
stand-up comedy acts.

It always guarantees an energetic and enthusiastic crowd of up to
10,000 people, with superb views and sound quality, whether
standing, seated, in the expensive boxes, or the rear balcony.
It's as good a venue on this scale for performing acts as it is
for the paying public.

Last but not least on the list of top five best UK concert venues
goes to a much forgotten centre of musical and artistic
excellence - another Camden classic - The Roundhouse
( http://www.roundhouse.org.uk ).

Built in 1846, this legendary and recently refurbished Grade II
listed building is as steeped in British music history as you can
get. Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and Bob Marley have all graced its
famous stage, and it's a pleasure to see it revitalize its
fortunes as a going concern. Since a period of degeneration and
regeneration, it now plays host to some of the best top and
wide-ranging acts the music and theatre scenes have to offer.
