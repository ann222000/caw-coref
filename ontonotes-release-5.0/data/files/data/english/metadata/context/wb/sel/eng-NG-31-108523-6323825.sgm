What would you do to stop wasteful government spending in Washington?

Hard line has an interest to Stalin-like force work and support the
work with a force, a work force that puts private interests at the top
more important (American-like Presidential, signifying importance and
non-compromize). Hitler was the biggest job maker, Bush is a fascist,
a big spender and assembler in the name of police-America, radically
erects other countries as models for races. This guy is a big spender,
and carelessly speaks of capitalist patronism with a military that
accepts nothing but a win, a brainwashed dude, expecting for all to
pay the dues to the King and shut up (he is a Hitler). Wasteful is all
him (Stalin knew what power meant). Move away from a power addiction,
as an addiction to wars and agendas (big government).

There is no hope, nor cure to large countries with regime mentalities
wanting to play world's biggest with the most success all should pay
dues to and accept as ruler in a black and white world of offensive
biggots who were never raised and only know religious extremism as
their means of power, give them a burning cross, the kkk is where one
finds it among their racist wars and their inclination to police-
America, mob over town and politics as in some places in Mexico and as
was the case in the 1930's Colorado when the kkk took over all of the
Sheriff's and political offices in the state. Only one town, Colorado
Springs resisted in a racist supremacist political domination that is
only interested in harrassing blacks and foreigners. Italians drank
wine and made their own wine, and therefore did not show respect to
the fascist community. It was supremacy the police, as today, knew who
they serve and who they beat and arrest, upon the slightest
disrespect. Black people were not allowed to sit on a tram or bus. It
was about the respect toward those who are the higher citizens of this
place, and as that they claim supremacy and status of all matters of
state, education, politics. A place so colony-like, in many ways as
today in the Arab world, police-America takes no chance in leaving
from Iraq. Iraqis never killed Americans before Bush went there in the
name of war on terrorism, but now the white American says: But if we
leave now, the terrorists will come, and they did say it. So one
conspires, then refuses to leave. Conspires that they have terrorists,
then prove nothing, and stay forever like leaving from Germany.
Germans got rid of the Russians. But the other one is an insisting
power-maniac of a regime that must apply it's police-America above all
social political issues, but the world turned away from the USA. Now
80-90 percent of Arabs think negatively of Americans, while in the
past Arabs thought positively of Americans. The USA has gone from one
of the world's most popular countries to the most hated one. Racism
that erects (erects, Roman Model Democracy style) a model country for
the Arab race. Bush sits as a supremacist with a racist war in his
hand, with a cultural crimes against humanity involving a remodeling
project like Ceausescu's whose primary interest was also big
government and secret police over matters of public. Bush now listens
to all phone calls in the world, by all means a big government that
went fascist police all over the world and uses terrorism for it's
interests. Bush used 9/11 to get Saddam. Bush uses terrorism, and
blackmails all people. Bush asks: Are you with Saddam and the
terrorists, or with the president, are you a flip flopper like Saddam,
or with the country. He gave no Democratic choice, put everyone to his
knees and forced supremacy on the USA to get what he wants and one of
those things is to get Iraq, the world's second largest oil country
and convert it to a model country he sees Germany in Europe or Japan
in Asia out of Iraq, as Iraq has a potential asset for richness. But
it is a racist fascist propaganda whose crimes against humanity is
similar to Ceausescu's expectations on who is the boss in power and
what can and cannot be compromized in regards to a system of power
that hails police and erects itself over matters of crime as a non-
negotiating strongholders of political power, similar to the KKK held
power over matters of politics in the 1930's Colorado. A power of
police sentiment. Schwarzenegger refused to refute the death sentence
of a man whose writings in jail were nominated for the Nobel Prize.
Schwarzenegger claimed the man did not show remorse for his crimes to
the victims of the families.

In reality, she who is raped, the last she wants is for the rapist to
come and make up. But Schwarzenegger expects prisoners to suffer and
'cry' for their crimes. This is the exact prison abuse mentality in
the USA driven by revenge, it is barbarism. Schwarzenegger's home town
in Austria called Schwarzenegger's decision barbaric and renamed a
stadium they named after Schwarzenegger. After this event
Schwarzenegger canceled his planned trip to his home town. The klan of
power hailing police-America and brutal revenge on crime, a street
fascism that klan-like serves the interest of a supremacist race, when
Schwarzenegger was asked if he is fascist, he said when he was young
he once chased skinheads away in the street with his bodybuilder
friends.

In Orwell's factory, the money goes to the military, a military knows
only winning, and people are silenced by a big brother who feeds
thoughts endlessly toward a better future, toward the future of the
children who generations later will come and thank the great leader's
(classical dictator's logic) investment that does not take no as an
answer and as that, unilaterally represents a big government that
turns toward the international arena and plays big brother and
conspires.

In other countries those who conspire are removed from power, just one
is enough, but this is not another country, it is not even a country
any more but a regime operating in 110 countries militarily with a
declaration to win a world war, while not noticing a world war, not
even a civil war in Iraq. The country is split, and there is daily
warfare that caused 40 thousand deaths last year and growing.

Always living in the military world, always feeding fear, the perfect
dictatorship that turned everybody away - as once what remained in the
never-ending-story... there was life. The military dictatorship spends
all money on military projects. I would stop wasteful government
spending by making everybody read this.

It is by all means fascism that most fear from Bush's America, there
were two world wars because of fascist sentiment, the world is
sickened from big government corruptions. In other countries
presidents who conspire are removed (pick one).

I prefer finding a real Cannibal and having Bush eaten live on TV. Its
the perfect ending of this drama. The President is eaten by a
Cannibal. I live in a film, not in a world. And after he is eaten, the
terrorists will be shocked that the execution was not civilized.

A country cannot take terrorists as equal proponents. Hello.
Terrorists will not win war on terrorism? How low can it get? Osama
did not attack the USA with the whole Arab world, as Timothy McVeigh
did not attack the USA with the whole American world... A country
cannot take terrorists as equal proponents. That's what it means you
can't negotiate with terrorists. Why the insanity? Well give him a
burning cross, the KKK is where one finds it, in this case in the
bottom of a Cannibal's fridge.

Low and cold, nice and red, maybe even the President who loves wars
would enjoy a New Direction of style, not European Q-zeen, but an
American invention on following Hitler in regards to racial enemies
and insisting in being Americans in a movement of change in regards to
not being easy going but very strict and reflecting that strength of
will and eating humans, and teaching kids to be scared of Americans
who listen to all phone calls in the world, because the police-America
must be violent and we must accept the things Bush says, that violence
is what Americans have to fight for, that terrorists will not win war
on terrorism, that Osama attacked with the whole Arab race and Iraq
must learn that to fight terrorism is to turn all Arabs against
Americans. Now 80-90 percent of Arabs thing negatively of Americans,
if that was the idea, Bush won. Now all Arabs are in fear, and the
whole world is in fear, snitch people from other countries and leave
them without access to lawyers for years in Guantanamo Bay. My own
friend was snitched in Hungary, he was just joking on the Internet,
just typing around and at 2:00am, a black car took him away at night
from his home. He apparently typed a valid login and password to a
government site, but my friend said he was drinking bear and was at
some site and randomly entered a name like Smith and a password and
got in. He is in Guantanamo Bay today, he's been there for 15 years
without a lawyer. He was a Hungarian college student when he was taken
at night in Hungary and never seen again. The Hungarian police got
involved when they took him, a refused arrest and was screaming for
help when he was being taken by Feds, and one of the neighbors called
the police and the police told the Feds that they cannot arrest
Hungarian citizens. There was a shootout, the Feds killed the two
Hungarian cops, and took off. Communism just was over, it was in the
early 90's. This guy had nothing to do with any organization, he was a
computer hacker, a student and hacked when he was drunk, he was just
discovering the Internet Explorer. I too once received a call by the
CIA, I wrote about World War III online, and they called me that I
made agents nervous by speaking of World War III, and they thought I
must be a terrorist, because they took my warning for a World War III
seriously. No joke. This was just before the time when Bush went to
Iraq, and the internet was watched, as all phone calls in the USA were
listened to (everybody knew that, MCI alone had 50000 agents assigned
dedicated to the government for ability to listen in to any calls, and
agents recorded any calls that mentioned keywords on their paper.
Drugs, and who knows what. A violation of the streets, the streets
belong to the people, and cameras on the streets are Ceausescu's
world, it is what Bush is doing today in the whole world, building a
big government and having no sense of history or humanity, but always
wanting police-America and no borders for American interests,
snitching people with black cars for minor things, and like in
Pinochet's era, repressing all political opponents by means of force.
1st Lt. Ehren Watada was jailed 6-8 years for making contempt toward
other officials by speaking of the President of the President's Iraq
war. This war is racist, yet speaking of it is not allowed. Those
making General concerns are arrested, those making Republican concerns
are not arrested. Soros tried to speak of a one-sided force that
represses Democracy, but nobody understood him.

Hey, police-America, stemming in culture to a long line of racism and
kkk in politics has its own conservative side. Give Bush a burning
cross, the kkk is where one finds it, and the rest of the world does
not have that long history of supremacy, the entire USA is based on a
religious supremacist model, one that makes kids in school say words
of religious extremist brainwash with unity under a regional God, and
not see how supremacist the whole thing is, how sadly white.

In other countries presidents who conspire are removed, but here it is
that white power that holds Bush in power. Racism and a radical police-
America is what so blindly erects a model of Iraq that is better than
Arabs and not see the crime of a supremacist mind of big government
corruption and racism, one that conspires with radical extremism and
police-America, and as that, religiously takes advantage of terrorism,
a Washington conspiracy of radical power that never ends.

So what would one do to stop wasteful government spending in
Washington? Yes, stop radical extremism, one that has a high budget.
Stop it by speaking of it, stop it by education, something Soros was
famous for in promoting: it is called teaching about Democracy, one
that here is only symbolic, misuderstood, repressed by a political
power. And teach about Cannibalism as an alternative to executions,
that police-America needs to accept cannibals and give them a job in
the prison systems and make TV shows for high ratings televising
executions, but never sex topics, only religious violence.

(I am not a human rights activist, I am a cannibal. The only reason I
can eat people is because there is a level. I am however a lifetime
dissident and peace activist.)
