Karat's worldview
The Pioneer Edit Desk

It's similar to that of Islamists

In warning Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that other friends of US
President George W Bush - namely, Mr Tony Blair in Britain, Mr Shinzo
Abe in Japan and Mr John Howard in Australia - have lost their jobs or
are likely to, CPI(M) general secretary Prakash Karat, who has forced
his party to rediscover 'merit' in Marxist dogma, has more than issued
a veiled threat. He has signalled that he detects an anti-American - or
at least an anti-Bush - surge in global politics and has gratuitously
advised Mr Singh not to fall into the same trap as other heads of
Government who have allied with the US President. Interesting as Mr
Karat's intervention is, it ignores, for instance, that France and
Germany have elected their most Right-wing leaders in years - Mr
Nicolas Sarozky in particular would like the idea of identifying with
Mr Bush. Mr Karat has also raised a more substantive issue. He has
suggested that Indian politicians cannot isolate themselves from global
trends and must adopt the prevalent zeitgeist. Given this, what lesson
would Mr Karat and the CPI(M) draw from the retreat of communism in
vast tracts of eastern Europe, Latin America and South-East Asia? From
Mr Vaclav Havel's Czech Republic to America-aligned Vietnam, is there a
global trend for Comrade Karat to see and adopt - or is
internationalism limited to raising slogans against America? Or, are we
to believe that the ideal model state and model leadership for our
Marxists is Venezuela? Mr Hugo Chavez's incoherent and abusive rant
against all things American, more so Mr Bush, is perhaps music to the
ears of Mr Karat and his fellow apparatchiks, but the fact remains that
the Venezuelan leader raises no more than derisive laughter even in
those parts of the world which are not necessarily aligned with America.

But Mr Karat is not entirely incorrect. There is a palpable sense of
anti-Americanism - and definitely hostility towards Mr Bush - at home
and abroad, among those Muslims who are unable to reconcile themselves
to the fact that their jihad stands exposed as no more than the
depredations of a depraved lot, denuded of the veneer of religious
injunction that was sought to be painted on murderous misdeeds. For
evidence, look at the popular response to bombings across the world: It
is uniformly one of revulsion. If the purpose was to seek subjugation
of the free world by unleashing terror, it has begun to recoil.
Palestine, which continues to be touted as the motivating factor by
mullahs and their followers for their fanaticism, is now a moth-eaten
dream, driven to destruction by the excesses of Hamas which refused to
be tainted by any contact with America. Mr Karat is unlikely to be
bothered about such details; his party's main concern is to pander to
the Muslims of West Bengal and Kerala who are increasingly embracing
radical Islamism, defined not so much by their adherence to Islamic
fundamentalism as by their hatred of Mr Bush and all things American.
The incongruous sight of kafeyah-clad Bengali and Malayali Muslims
chanting 'Death to Bush' drives our comrades into believing that they
can get their votes by lending their voice to Islamist rant. This is
not about ideology, nor is it about national interest, which in any
case leaves our comrades cold. It is about the exigencies of vote-bank
politics as a mid-term poll draws closer.

Alone in the crowd
The Pioneer Edit Desk

Perhaps your genes are to blame

Feeling lonely? Maybe it's not your fault. Perhaps it's in your genes.
Scientists who have looked at the DNA of isolated people have found
that those who described themselves as chronically lonely have patterns
of genetic activity involving the immune system. What this means is
that lonely people seem more likely to get sick and die young because
their immune system goes haywire. What the scientists also appear to be
telling us is that social isolation is in some way linked to our
biology, that somewhere, at the deepest level of our physical being
lies the key to those powerful negative feelings of empty aloneness
that so often grip so many of us in increasing numbers. Certainly, the
link between loneliness and disease has been explored before. It has
been found that such isolation has a connection with serious illnesses
such as cancer and heart disease. It may well be true that lonely
people are genetically disposed to be so. Not everyone would agree.
Others would argue that loneliness is a social phenomenon and deny it a
biological basis. They would say that it is caused by social factors
and is the price of modern living. It is certainly true that societies
in transition under the pressure of modern forces witness the break-up
of traditional patterns of social interaction. Communities, kinship and
even family ties collapse under the pressures of modern living.
Sometimes, even regular face-to-face interaction with near and dear
ones becomes rare. In our days of advanced modern communications and
the internet, intimate communications within close knit social groups
such has friends and family are breaking down. It has been said that it
is possible for us to be lonely in a crowd. This is becoming truer for
more of us.

To ascribe biological causes to loneliness would then appear to be
wrong. It would seem to be another example of the medicalisation of
social problems that is increasingly a trend in our societies. Soon
there will be pills available in the market to cure loneliness just as
there are to cure depression. That would be sad. Philosophers and
others who have taken a keen interest in human affairs have indirectly
alluded to the problem of loneliness. They have called it by various
names, such as alienation and anomie, to describe the phenomena of
disjunction with others, with society, with work and even with the
self. Not all social isolation is bad. Solitariness can be a positive
experience. Lest it be forgotten, many creative people and geniuses
have led solitary lives that were far from lonely but full of wondrous
activity. In our past, sages would withdraw deep into forests to get in
touch with nature, with their inner selves and with that mystical
ultimate reality. There is already a cure for loneliness. Get yourself
a dog. Better still, subscribe to The Pioneer. On all days of the week.

BSP is best placed of all
Arun Nehru

The Mayawati factor is going to dominate the political landscape over
the next year. I must admit that Ms Mayawati, by her political action
and deeds, is establishing herself as a 'decisive' leader for the
future. The three Assembly by-election results saw the Bahujan Samaj
Party (BSP) wresting two seats from the Samajwadi Party (SP). The BSP
won the Farrukhabad seat (Congress leader Salman Khurshid's home base)
and Swar Tanda by decisive margins and lost to the SP in Gunnar by
13,000 votes. Gunnar had been vacated by Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav.

Ms Mayawati and the BSP can win 40 to 50 seats in the next Lok Sabha
election and the SP is likely to come a distant second, while the BJP
and the Congress have simply ceased to exist as a political force in
Uttar Pradesh. The BSP leader flexes her political muscle. She shows a
little weakness towards the UPA and the Congress. After all, she has
legal issues to settle. But it is clear that she has little intention
of aligning with the Congress in the immediate future.

The Congress, despite being in a favourable position in contrast to the
BJP, cannot confront the Left unless it gets some insurance from the
BSP. The reality is that with current combinations and alliances, none
of the three groups - the UPA, the NDA and the UNPA - can form a
Government without the support of Ms Mayawati and her 50 seats in the
next Lok Sabha. But then she may want to be Prime Minister, and this
can actually happen as numbers determine power sharing. And few, if
any, can dispute her ability to head the Government and the
administration. The Congress and the Left can keep firing 'nuclear
pellets' at each other, but unless alliance structures are in place,
little will happen in the field.

We have a very complicated issue at hand. For the Congress in
particular, the decision-making process is proving to be very difficult
as all its 'allies', barring Mr Sharad Pawar's NCP, stand to lose
seats. Even if the Congress reaches 180-190 seats on its own, it will
find it difficult to muster another 100 seats with its current allies,
unless it has Ms Mayawati to support its efforts.

All three groups have 'flexible' allies and they can all travel in
different directions. The Congress is making the right moves, but to
gain 40-45 seats, it will have to make political moves in Madhya
Pradesh (under Mr Digvijay Singh, Mr Kamal Nath, Mr Suresh Pachauri and
Mr Jyotiraditya Scindia), Rajasthan (Mr Ashok Gehlot and Mr Sachin
Pilot), Chhattisgarh (Mr Ajit Jogi), Karnataka (Mr SM Krishna should
return to active politics) and in Kerala (the State will be a gift from
comrades). It will also have to cut its losses in Andhra Pradesh (where
the TDP will gain), Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand and Tamil Nadu. In Tamil
Nadu, the PMK is set to leave the Congress, the MDMK has already gone,
while DMK politics is shrouded by family squabbles; so, it is the ADMK
that is set to win in that State.

The Mayawati syndrome is not confined to governance and power alone,
but also election trends. Few, if any, had forecast 200-plus seats for
her. While predicting the election results for Uttar Pradesh, we were
all thinking conventionally in terms of coalition politics. But the
people of

Nepal in turmoil

The Pioneer Edit Desk

Koirala must stand up to Prachanda

By walking out of Mr GP Koirala's Government in Nepal, the Maoists have
surprised only those who were naÃ¯ve enough to believe that Prachanda and
his armed brigands would turn into law-abiding constitutionalists after
being co-opted into the parliamentary system of governance. At least,
this was the perception among those who supported, against better
advice, the induction of Maoists in the Seven-Party Alliance interim
Government headed by Mr Koirala in April, and before that their
accommodation in the Pratinidhi Sabha which really lacks legitimacy and
should not have strayed beyond its presumed remit of organising a free
and fair poll to elect a Constituent Assembly. Instead, Mr Koirala,
largely under pressure from Prachanda's admirers in New Delhi (though
not necessarily in the Government) and partly in the mistaken belief
that the Maoists are amenable to 'mainstreaming', kept on conceding
ground to those who have brought Nepal to near ruination. Rather than
leave it to the Constituent Assembly to decide the fate of the monarchy,
he allowed himself to be guided by Prachanda's agenda - against his own
instincts - to a point where it appeared that humiliating the King and
denuding him of all dignity was the Government's sole task. This
obviously encouraged Prachanda to push for greater concessions, even
while using his thugs to try and suppress the Madhesi uprising through
renewed loot, plunder and murder. In the event, neither has Mr Koirala
succeeded, nor has Prachanda proved his critics wrong. Worse, Nepal
today finds itself caught in spiralling social strife, political turmoil
and economic distress. That Prachanda would insist on the immediate
abolition of monarchy and subsequently King Gyanendra's exile, if not
execution, was no secret; he has now used the scheduled Constituent
Assembly election in November to his advantage: If the Maoists' demand
is not met right away, they will disrupt the poll.

But this is only one part of the story. The other part is to do with
Prachanda realising that for all his claims of popular support, the
Maoists do not have the ghost of a chance to win a free and fair
election, more so now with the Madhesis on the warpath. The anti-Maoist
riots in Kapilvastu are indicative of the prevailing mood in southern
Nepal. Also, there is renewed support for the monarchy among the masses
who are beginning to tire of the political turmoil that has disrupted
their lives: The King united Nepal's various ethnic communities whose
differences now seem irreconcilable. The Maoists's irreverential
attitude towards Hinduism - for instance, their recent assault on
Pashupatinath temple premises - and their insistence on 'secularising' a
deeply religious society has only added to popular fear of Prachanda
coming to power. For all his bravado, Prachanda knows that he cannot
attain his dream of taking over Singha Durbar through the democratic
route; hence his attempt to blackmail the Government and short-circuit
the constitutional process. In the process, he has presented Mr Koirala
with both a challenge and an opportunity. Regardless of the Maoists's
potential to unleash violence, he must not concede further ground to
Prachanda and go ahead with the scheduled election. History won't
forgive him for anything less than this.

Russia rises again

The Pioneer Edit Desk

Credit goes to a resolute Putin

What Russian President Vladimir Putin wants is often a mystery to
professional 'Kremlinologists'. That is perhaps why most were taken
completely by surprise when he named Mr Viktor Zubkov as the country's
new Prime Minister. This is not a new situation, for in the old days of
the Soviet Union, this 'scholarly' group was often befuddled by the
mysterious inner workings of the ruling oligarchy. Russia is more open
now, but a different cultural setting possibly makes prediction a
difficult task. In any case, in making this move, Mr Putin guarded his
cards close to his chest. In such a situation, it is not surprising that
Mr Putin himself arouses certain fears, as does Russia. This is partly
because of his KGB background, with that dreaded secret police
associated with many of the terrible outrages of the Soviet era. It is
also true that during Mr Putin's years in power, many from the old
security apparatus - called Siloviki by Russians - have gained
prominence in Russia and are prospering. Matters are not helped by Mr
Putin's actions, such as placing curbs on media organisations,
centralising administration and allowing security agencies a greater
role, with Russia also increasingly asserting itself on the world stage.
Consequently, fears are sometimes expressed that it may soon be back to
the bad old days of the Cold War, with Russia moving towards internal
dictatorship and into military confrontation with the West. Yet, such
views are perhaps unduly pessimistic. One cannot lose sight of the fact
that Russia is still in the process of passing through a difficult phase
of transition from the Soviet political and economic system to that of a
democracy with competitive market forces. This changeover, especially in
its early stages, did let loose forces in the country, such as those of
disorder and corruption; many of the powerful oligarchs of today have
risen through illegal means.

Governing Russia has required a stern hand at the tiller and, perhaps,
rough methods. That Mr Putin has risen to the occasion partly explains
his popularity. For example, many Russians are said to support his curbs
on the media, not because they oppose media freedom, but because of
on-screen sex and violence in the absence of rules. The incomplete
transition is a reason why Russia looks to be an imperfect democracy at
present and explains the anomalies that appear. There is little reason
to doubt the Russian leaders' commitment to the new democratic order in
the long run. In any case, the introduction of a market economy in the
country is modifying institutions and unleashing new forces that are
likely to make the transition irreversible. Despite occasional and
recent belligerence, Russia's relations with the West have been stable
and it has shown flexibility. There are economic dependencies at least
with Europe. A strong and stable Russia is probably a better bet for a
stable world order than a struggling one.

Wake up to China's plans

G Parthasarathy

Non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries was a
cardinal principle of Jawaharlal Nehru's five principles of peaceful
coexistence. But, after the end of the Cold War, the Western world led
by the US has been very selective about its demands for democracy across
the world. Authoritarian rulers ranging from Gen Pervez Musharraf in
Pakistan to President Ilham Aliyev in Azerbaijan have been treated with
kid gloves, while others - notably the military rulers of Myanmar - have
been made virtual punching bags for sermons and sanctions in the name of
democracy. While military rule in Pakistan is acknowledged as a fact of
life, what is often forgotten is that the countries to our east either
have one-party rule like China, or have experienced frequent military coups.

Three countries - Bangladesh, Myanmar and Thailand - with whom we share
land and maritime frontiers, play a crucial role in our 'Look East'
policies. Thailand has periodically faced military coups with the latest
takeover on September 20, 2006, when Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra
was overthrown. Bangladesh has a turbulent history of military rule with
a state of Emergency being declared on January 12, 2007, and Lt-Gen
Moeen U Ahmed backing a new Interim Government set up the next day.
Military coups in Bangladesh are so endemic that Lt-Gen Ziaur Rehman
faced 21 coup attempts in his five-year rule, before he was assassinated
on the 22nd attempt!

India has wisely refrained from commenting on the military takeover in
Thailand, given the stature of the universally respected monarch there.
Even on Bangladesh, India's comments have largely reflected genuine
concern that in the political vacuum that now prevails, fundamentalist
parties like the Jamaat-ul Islami and their affiliated jihadi
organisations would fill the corridors of power.

Ever since the military takeover in Myanmar in 1988 that country has
been the target of Western anger. The ruling junta believes, rightly or
wrongly, that Ms Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters are being propped
up primarily to promote British and American interests. After
considerable deliberation, New Delhi's policies towards Myanmar have
been driven by two considerations - the need to cooperate in dealing
with insurgencies along the border and to balance China's growing
influence in Myanmar.

The Myanmar Government, in turn, has been cooperative on issues of
border management. Myanmar has also shown a readiness to cooperate with
India in developing hydroelectric projects, communications links and in
oil and gas exploration. But recent Western policies of seeking to
impose sanctions on Myanmar have unfortunately driven that country even
closer into the Chinese embrace.

In September 2006, the US led an effort to include the situation in
Myanmar on the agenda of the UN Security Council in the face of Chinese
and Russian reservations. In January 2007, Russia and China vetoed an
American-sponsored resolution seeking to end repression and release
political prisoners in Myanmar. While Belgium, France, the UK, Ghana,
Italy, Peru and Slovakia backed the US, South Africa joined Russia and
China to vote against, with Indonesia, Qatar and Congo abstaining.
Chinese Ambassador Weng Guangya described the resolution as interference
in Myanmar's internal affairs and Russia's Vitaly Churkin said that such
issues were better handled by the Human Rights
