Cool.  Knowing the name of this thing allowed Google to find some other
stuff:

Which finally led me here, high resolution pictures!

As far as the name goes, check up on the cartoons of the era:
http://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/detailed.cgi?film=9597
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Draw_McGraw
I assume the idea came about as Gemini swinging down out of the sky like
Quick Draw McGraw on his rope, with the parawing serving the part of the
cape., and the black Gemini and it's windows looking like his masked face.
If you think that concept looked iffy, try this on for size:
http://www.astronautix.com/craft/winemini.htm
http://www.astronautix.com/gallery/cwiemini.htm
Great aerodynamics! :-D
I always thought ASSET was probably a test vehicle for a aerodynamic
MARV warhead.
The concept of a quick-launch manned recoverable spacecraft seemed to be
on a lot of people's minds back then (This concept, Space Cruiser, SAINT II)
I wonder if the mission was to disable Soviet orbiting nuclear weapons
platforms in a covert way.

This is a nice concept. Scale the thing up for a larger crew, add a
hatch through the heat-shield and a service/mission module (as the
russian TKS did), and you have something.

But why did they use skids? With the ability for precision landings you
can land at a runway and use wheels.

Well, that confirms the Quick Draw McGraw connection.

I assume they were concerned about winds making it drift off course
during approach.
They thought skids would be more forgiving on a landing on the desert at
Edwards.
There is also the problem of the tires getting hot during reentry and
exploding.
Dyna-Soar was also going to use skids, as was the Soviet Spiral space
fighter.

For those who don't remember its namesake, &quot;El Kabong&quot; was the alter ego of
Hanna-Barbera cartoon horse cowboy &quot;Quickdraw McGraw&quot;.  &quot;El Kabong&quot; was a
Zorro-like hero, who swung down on a rope with a guitar, with which he to
bashed bad guys over the head.  At the moment of impact, he would say
&quot;Kabong!&quot;

Now if this sounds lame in 2007, remember that is was 1963 or 64 when the
cartoon was popular.  It followed on the heels of the very popular
&quot;Huckleberry Hound&quot; show, which introduced other cartoon heroes, including
&quot;Yogi Bear&quot;.  Hanna-Barbera was instantly famous overnight, then kept on
runnng extremely diluted off-shoot cartoons based on the originals.  For
their time, they were extremely novel programs with the earliest having some
very well written, and funny - truely funny - dialog.

While totally unrelated, I think these cartoons were following to catch up
on the &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; programs, which were perhaps the the funniest,
most intellectually pleasing, topical, cartoons of their day.  These were
cartoons which didn't talk down to children or adults, and actually required
some literacy to really understand.  These were produced by Jay Ward and
Bill Scott.

I don't think anything available today encourages the same literacy required
by these early gems.  Couple that atmosphere with the prospect of human
going out into space, and a government drive to get us out into space, and
you have a tiny slice of what it meant to be thirteen, in 1963.

...From what I recall, that was part of the inspiration. The other one

OK, I certainly can see that all this is significant with such a
small craft as Gemini was.

But it's funny, everytime I look at Gemini I think that it was a capsule
with great potential, both Apollo and the Shuttle look somewhat
fundamentally wrong and clumsy compared to it. I can perfectly imagine a
Gemini about the size of the Shuttle crew compartment sailing down,
deploying its landing gear and touching down at a runway...

From above, Big Gemini would have used the same sort of skid landing system
being discussed here.  The advanced concept was to have held 12 astronauts.

The above could have been to service a big (Saturn V launched) space station
whose diameter was the same as the first and second stages (i.e.
considerably bigger than Skylab).

Of course, all these studies were for naught since NASA's funding was
drastically cut once Apollo/Saturn development was largely complete.  There
was great support for beating the Soviets to the moon, to show our technical
and economic superiority, but there was little support for manned space
travel beyond that.

It looks like he's setting up a portable barbecue grill at the base of
the landing leg.
Probably to cook those sausage plants CDR Christopher Draper found in
&quot;Robinson Crusoe On Mars&quot;.
I'd like to have a rope tied on me for the climb down the side, low Mars
gravity or not.
Note that the wings and vertical fins on the lander have no control
surfaces on them, and that there are no control thrusters on the thing's
exterior.
We now know what's in the interior of the spacecraft's aft
section...huge gyroscopes. ;-)
