Jerusalem is Israel's capital in every historical and practical sense.

King David made Jerusalem the capital of his Kingdom some three thousand
years ago; and since then, Jerusalem has been the capital of every Jewish
entity, until its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE.

Jewish independence was restored in 1948 with the establishment of the State
of Israel, and Jerusalem was declared once more the capital of Israel. This
decision, enshrined in a Basic Law (1980), has practical implications.
Jerusalem is the seat of all the symbols of Israeli sovereignty: the
President of the State, the Knesset, the Government, and the Supreme Court.

Political pressure from Arab states forced most countries to not recognize
Jerusalem as Israel's capital; the reasons for this are political and
economical. These countries ignore the basic right of every state to
determine its capital. The State of Israel has exercised that right and
determined, very naturally, that its capital is Jerusalem.

The children of Israel is a disgraced and cursed nation. The fell from
grace on charging interest against the teachings of
Torah. They were massacred and thrown out of the holy land by the army
of Banukadnazar. Then they were allowed to
return and live in the holy land. But they again conspired to kill
Jesus Christ a messenger of God Almighty and were again
thrown out in a diaspora for 2000 years. They have no right to enter
the holy land as they deviated from righteousness which was the
condition for inheritance of the holy land. They believe in secularism
and lead a free for all sinful life.
They should not be allowed to enter in the Jerusalem which is a sacred
place for Christians and Muslims.

The bible clearly teaches that Jews are a hard headed people but they are
still the chosen people.  With the advent of Christ, Christians were
accepted into the fold.  However, Muslims are in a different position as
they worship Allah, who was cast out to the earth after successfully
tempting Eve.  There will only be a handful of Jews left upon the return of
Jesus.   That is also the time when Muslims will get the shock of their
lives after discovering who Allah really is.
