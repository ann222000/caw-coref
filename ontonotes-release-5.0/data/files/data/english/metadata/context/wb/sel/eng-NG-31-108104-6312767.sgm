I hope this poultry farm outbreak in Holton is nowhere near you!

Of the UK members, Helen S would be the closest. Hopefully it will be an
isolated incident.

Fortunately it's quite a long way away from me.  I am concerned about it
because I think I am the only group member in the UK that keeps poultry.
If the worst comes to the worst I could comply with regulations to keep them
safe.  They would have to be confined more than they are now and I would
need to net the runs with fine mesh netting to keep wild birds out.  I could
do it if I had to.
Thanks for thinking about me, Jeanne.

This worries me here with all the migratory birds here for the winter.  We
have had an extremely dry month.  Wildlife organizations pay to have rice
fields flooded for them and there are a lot of refuges, but still huge
flocks are being jammed together to follow the water.  I don't remember what
was killing them last time this happened but a huge number of birds died.

I hardly ever see magpies since west Nile swept through.
