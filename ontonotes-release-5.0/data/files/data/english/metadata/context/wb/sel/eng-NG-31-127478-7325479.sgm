Mrs Middleton's first and perhaps greatest faux pas was committed
during
Prince William's passing-out parade at Sandhurst. In the presence of
The
Queen, Prince Philip and the Prince of Wales, Mrs Middleton chewed
gum.
And chewed gum. And chewed gum. This is not quite as crass as the
behaviour of the late Robert Maxwell, who put his arm around the
Queen,
but Maxwell was not trying to hitch his daughter to the second in line
to
the throne.

Do not try to shake hands with the Queen. Even if she offers, Tatler's
advice is "you may not shake the Queen's hand, only touch it
briefly" . Do
not turn your back on her. Bow from the neck or chest if you are a
man,
and if you are female, a little bob will do.
