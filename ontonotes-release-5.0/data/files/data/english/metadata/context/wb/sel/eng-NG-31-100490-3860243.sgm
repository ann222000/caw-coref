I've been having issues removing the rear rotors on a 77.  I'm not sure if
they are just very rusted on or if there is a step I'm missing.  Any help
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.

Have you drilled out the rivets holding the rotor to the axle?

Are you sure the parking brake shoes are retracted from the drum section
of the rotor?

Have you removed the caliper? ; )

If all of the above is affirmative, then try giving the rotor a whack
with a tubafor to break the rust hold between the parts in the lug area.

I just replaced the wheel bearings, and they had never been touched before
in my 77.  Had to send them to 3 different shops before someone had a press
large enough to get them off.  Everything came off hard as hell.

After two weeks, I was ready to use a sledge hammer if I had to.  If you've
done all the stuff mentioned above, then you'll probably have to hit it.

On other vehicles, I've used a lot of heat to get the rust to break loose.
But those were drum brakes, and I don't know if that is a technique to use
here or not.  Probably someone else knows, though.

Just to clarify for the OP - a press isn't necessary for rotor removal
but is for bearing replacement.

Thanks, Owen.  I see how my wording could be misconstued.  Having raised the
idea, now I'm curious too about using heat to separate rusted parts in this
area.  Does anyone have experience or knowledge about that as a procedure?

Thanks for the info.

I drilled the rivets out and took the caliper off ; )
The thing still wont budge.  Its not stuck like the parking brake is too
tight, plus the rotor turns quite freely.  I think the years of rust and
never being off just have it seized.  I think getting old smoke wrench out
might be the next idea.
Leave it to GM to rivet a rotor to the axle.  I wonder who I could write a
nasty letter to?

Thanks

You might try a couple "impact" methods before resorting to fire. Have
you tried placing a 2x4 on the pad surface and hitting that with a 2 or3
lb mini-sledge a few times? Maybe even put the car in gear so the axle
won't turn and then put a steel bar into a cooling channel on the
outside edge and give it a few solid whacks both forward and in reverse
directions.

As to why they are riveted, as I recall the explanation, it had to do
with the order of the parts hung on the chassis moving down the assembly
line. The calipers weren't placed on the chassis until a while after the
trailing arms and rotors were bolted on. The rivets held the rotors so
they wouldn't fall off.

Or it could have been that the trailing arm assembly supplier had the
responsibility to not only set the bearings and hub in the arm but to
supply the rotors as well. Riveting them on would assure all arms
arrived at the chassis with a rotor attached.

Yeah, a little bit of fire went a long way.  I just heated up around the
flange area and soaked it with WD-40 and let it cool a little then it came
right off.  The cooling seemed to be the important part becasuse it still
wouldn't budge when hot.
