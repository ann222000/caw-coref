I think nowadays every body gives only the iBT. Can't recall somebody
giving a CBT alteast for a year by now.

If you are used to conversing in English(atleast in a classroom setup),
then you will have no problems scoring in TOEFL. When you register for
your TOEFL iBT, you will be eligible to take a mock online TOEFL iBT and
I guess it should be enough for a preparation. The only section which
might need some practice is the speaking section.

Generally most universities fix 20(in each section - reading,writing,
listening and speaking) as an eligiblity criterion for admission, some
universities might expect 22 too. Scoring 20-25 in each section, with a
1-2 days preparation is perfectly possible for a normal Indian graduate.
