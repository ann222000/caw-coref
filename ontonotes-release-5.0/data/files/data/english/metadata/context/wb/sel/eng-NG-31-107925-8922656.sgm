Recent Martinsville success helps mend memories
Rick Hendrick puts team's 2004 tragedy behind him

MARTINSVILLE, Va. -- The sun washed over Martinsville Speedway in all its
glorious splendor Sunday, shining down from one of those clear skies so
brilliantly blue that the entire world seemed a better place.

It was in stark contrast to Oct. 24, 2004, which broke gray and overcast
at dawn and not only never got any better, but in fact got a whole lot
worse. They ran Subway 500 races both then and Sunday, and the two
stock-car events were as different as the weather that made up the two
days.

On that tragic day in 2004, the Beech 200 King Air plane that had been
carrying 10 people for Hendrick Motorsports from Concord, N.C., crashed in
the Bull Mountain area seven miles from the Blue Ridge Regional Airport in
Martinsville, killing all those on board.

Among the dead were Ricky Hendrick, son of Hendrick Motorsports owner Rick
Hendrick; John Hendrick, Rick's brother and president of the organization;
Kimberly and Jennifer Hendrick, John's 22-year-old twin daughters and
Rick's nieces; Jeff Turner, general manager of Hendrick Motorsports; and
Randy Dorton, the organization's chief engine builder.

Jimmie Johnson won the race that day and wasn't told of the tragedy until
afterward, cutting short what he thought was going to be a long
celebration in Victory Lane.

Rick Hendrick hadn't attended that race because he was ill. For a long
time afterward, he didn't attend subsequent events at the Martinsville
track because it brought back too many horrible memories.

But Sunday, when Johnson won the Subway 500 again, Hendrick was there to
lend a congratulatory hand and a crushing hug in Victory Lane. It capped a
weekend in which Hendrick and his family also attended the grand opening
of Levine's Children Hospital at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte,
N.C., which also contains the Ricky Hendrick Centers for Intensive Care --
comprised of a pediatric intensive care unit and a cardiovascular
intensive care unit.

&quot;I stayed at home last year, and I think I stayed home the year before. I
came back the first year [after the plane crash]. And actually sitting at
home is tougher than being here with the guys -- because that's what Ricky
and John and Randy and all of them want me to do,&quot; Hendrick said Sunday.

&quot;It's hard to do. But as soon as I walk in here and get with the guys [on
the Hendrick race teams], these are my family, too -- all the fans, you
guys [in the media]. I'm with people that care about us.&quot;

Chasing the championship

When Johnson won the Goody's 500 Nextel Cup race at Martinsville last
spring, Hendrick lingered behind in his Charlotte home. But he watched
with great interest as two of his drivers, Johnson and Jeff Gordon,
battled furiously with each other over the final laps before Johnson
emerged victoriously.

For a long time Sunday's race looked like it was shaping up as a repeat of
that one. Gordon actually led a race-high 168 laps to Johnson's 147 -- and
for many of those when Johnson was in the lead, Gordon was right behind
him.

Once again, Hendrick was caught right in the middle. No one seems to be
able to handle it better -- and that appears to be one of the main reasons
Johnson and Gordon have 13 race victories between them this season and are
ranked one-two in points, with Gordon holding a 53-point edge over
Johnson.

&quot;You don't want to see 'em wreck each other. You want to see 'em race
clean,&quot; Hendrick said. &quot;And I think you saw it. Jeff didn't try to hold
Jimmie up. When Jimmie got there and he was quicker and got to the inside,
[Gordon] didn't try to muscle him or anything like that. You know, he's
racing for a championship -- and if he can narrow it down to just two more
cars, then that's to his advantage.

&quot;I shouldn't say this, but people are going to remember who won the '07
championship. They might not remember who won the race and finished third
here when we're in New York [for the season-ending awards banquet].&quot;

With four races remaining in the Chase for the Nextel Cup, the two
Hendrick drivers are 115 points clear of third-place driver Clint Bowyer.
Tony Stewart, lurking in fourth place, dropped to 249 points back and
appears out of contention for the title.

&quot;Hopefully it's down to two of us,&quot; Hendrick said.

Hendrick has presided over a two-man race for the championship within his
organization previously. In 1996 it came down to the final race of the
season when Terry Labonte edged out Gordon for the championship by a mere
37 points.

&quot;I got them all together the week before and I said, 'I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do. I'm going to go to the loser first,'&quot; Hendrick said. &quot;'And
then after that, I'm going to go to the guy that won it. So know it before
you see it. And don't think I'm playing favorites by going to the guy that
loses. I want you to know what I'm going to do.'

&quot;I think it helps the guys to know how I feel.&quot;

No favorites

No one thinks Hendrick plays favorites at his organization these days.
When the No. 24 Chevrolet of Gordon's team and the No. 48 Chevy of
Johnson's team are battling, everyone involved knows Mr. H cares the most
about everyone getting through it without anything bad happening.

&quot;He does everything he can to assure all of us that everything is going to
be all right,&quot; said Chad Knaus, Johnson's crew chief. &quot;When something
happens on pit road with the 24, he'll scurry down there and pat them on
the back. So he's busy. He's like a little queen bee, running from back
and forth between the teams and making sure everything's all right.

&quot;It's got to be tough for him because of the fierce competitive nature of
our organization. But he thrives on that. He loves that. He loves the fact
that we're battling amongst ourselves.&quot;

Johnson said that no one can possibly comprehend the other daily demons
that Hendrick must battle, in the wake of the tremendous personal losses
suffered that day in October of 2004.

&quot;I could never imagine it getting any easier for him,&quot; Johnson said after
Sunday's latest victory. &quot;In the situation he's in, if he can somehow, if
his mind will give him a break thinking about his son passing on the
plane, then he goes to his brother, his nieces, close friends and on and
on.

&quot;I can't even begin to understand what kind of pain he has to deal with
every time coming here. I wasn't sure he was going to be here today. But
he was there in Victory Lane -- and to see him smiling and happy is
awesome.&quot;

After a pause, Johnson added in pure amazement: &quot;The stuff that man has
lived through, and still he shows up with a smile on his face.&quot;

Hendrick said he draws strength from his race teams just as surely as they
obviously draw strength from him.

&quot;You can't undo what was done,&quot; Hendrick said. &quot;This week we dedicated a
children's hospital [intensive care units] in Ricky's name. We cut the
ribbon Saturday morning. So, you know, it's been a hard week. But every
week is a hard week. It's just, you miss all those folks.

&quot;Just being with these guys and supporting them is real important to me. I
wanted to be here.&quot;

As Hendrick smiled again, shook another round of hands and offered a
parting hug to a motorsports representative, the sun was still shining
down on Martinsville Speedway even as the shadows began to encroach again.

Sheesh, give it a rest already. Â The leukemia went into remission and
the Rick was pardoned by the president, which you well know.

Duh! I totally misread that. I thought he was somehow accusing RH of doing
something with leukemia donations/funds. Why would anyone bring up his
leukemia battle within a discussion about his pardon? For that matter, why
would people not let his past go esp. during a discussion about
Martinsville and the tragedy there?

As Mike said, he's one of the most admired &amp; respected men in the sport.
Guess some fans know better than those who work with and have known him
for years. Not saying he's perfect or an angel, but I wouldn't mind being
part of his organization and working for the man. And as a NASCAR fan, I
have to admire and be appreciative of what he's accomplished &amp; added to
the sport.
