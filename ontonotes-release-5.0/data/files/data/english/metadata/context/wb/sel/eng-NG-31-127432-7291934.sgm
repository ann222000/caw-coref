La Mama will host Avra Sidiropoulou's Clytemnestra's Tears  produced
by the Persona Theatre Company from Greece  for a three-week limited
engagement May 17-June 3.

Clytemnestra's Tears is directed by Sidiropoulou and performed by
Themis Bazaka. The production will be presented in Greek, with English
supertitles.

The work was first presented in 2001 as a staged reading at the
Donnell Library Auditorium in New York's Public Library, starring
Kristin Linklater. The first full production was staged at the Dipylon
Theater in Athens, starring the Greek actress Themis Bazaka. A
tri-lingual version was presented in Istanbul, funded by the European
Union.

According to press notes, Clytemnestra's Tears "is based on the primal
myth of the House of Atreus and the archetypical female character of
Clytemnestra. In a dangerous landscape in which she quivers with
desire and remembrance, Clytemnestra relives the tragic moments of her
life: her daughter Iphigenia's sacrifice, the separation from her
children and the murder of Agamemnon, her husband. In an attempt to
atone for her crimes in the eyes of her children, her people, the gods
and ultimately the spectators, she must confront the relentless chase
of the Furies."

The play features set design by Eva Manidaki, lighting design by Maria
Cristina Fuste, costume design by Ioanna Tsami, original music score
by Vanias Apergis and choreography by Margarita Mandaka. The
production is backed by the Hellenic Culture Organization and
sponsored by the Onassis Foundation.

Founded in 2003, Persona Theatre Company "aims to remain faithful to
the spirit of classical texts and approach them in such a way as to
illuminate some of their still unrevealed sides, bringing them closer
to today's audiences," according to press notes.

The production will play La Mama E.T.C.'s First Floor Theater at 74A
East 4th Street, between Bowery and 2nd Avenue. Tickets can be
purchased online at www.lamama.org or by calling the box office at
(212) 475-7710.
