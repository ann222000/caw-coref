The season is coming. Has anyone figured out a software package that
can download sectionals or wacs, put turnpoint markers on them based on
the turnpoint exchange files, and print out, avoiding the yearly
cutting pasting and marking job?

Thanks

John,

GlidePlan will be able to do this in the next release (1.2) scheduled
for February.  It will import SeeYou or WW Turnpoint files in CU format
into a current sectional and let you determine how the points are
displayed.  It will be a free upgrade from the current release.  See
http://www.glideplan.com for mre info .  If you are going to the SSA
convention, stop by booth 26 and say "Hi".  We will have some special
show pricing too.

Matt (Jr)

The way I do this -- and I don't use the results for navigation, btw (I
have flight software for that) -- is to simply use SeeYou (the desktop
version). You can pick your background -- vector graphics, satellite
imagery or sectionals -- then load your turnpoint file.

The only "trick" is that SeeYou doesn't expressly support printing
maps. So what I do is load a flight log from a location outside of the
area I'm interesting in having a map of, and adjust my map view to what
I want. I use the Print Setup and Print Preview to make sure I'm
getting what I want, then print.

I invested in a color deskjet printer that lets me print on 11-by-17
inch paper, which is the perfect size for maps in the cockpit. I'll
print the task area on anywhere from 2 to 4 pages. Works great!

Download Global Mapper ( www.globalmapper.com ).  You can open up to 4
sectionals and they will be automatically stitched together using the GIS
coding imbedded in the sectional TIF files.  You can add any anotations
using the drawing tools that you want.

The free download has 85% of the functionality of the full version.  The
full version lets you save and reload your workspaces, gives you full
control over printing, and lets you open more then 4 TIF files.

Once you have sectional images you can use (free) Flight Display
( http://www.soaringpilotsoftware.com ) to do the rest.

Sectionals can be downloaded from
http://www.naco.faa.gov/ecomp/Catalog.aspx?a=AERO+NOS+DIGITAL+DSEC for
$1.50 each to make them visible download Global Mapper
( http://www.globalmapper.com ).  The free version allows you to stitch
up to four images together. Form there on you have to save an image -
this leaves a lot to be desired as you can only save what you have on
the screen (from what I remember). I used screen capture and Corel
Paint to create a "sectional" of "western US" (west of 112W in the
north and 113:30 in the south)

Cheers,

Ha!! The latest sectionals I've seen for Arizona have airports that

I assume Winpilot's database has these same closed airports, so how do
you deal with those? Can you delete or modify them in the database? Is
there a listing of these errors somewhere so every pilot doesn't have to
do each bad airport listing by hand?

If you are going to be a serious user, you want to spend the $250 for a full
license for Global Mapper.

Another option that I have used is to use Acrobat Distiller to save a
printed sectional.  This however requires a full Adobe Acrobat license.  In
the end, you still need to have access to a wide format color printer.

There is no free lunch.....

This is actually a big reason why I switched from Winpilot to SeeYou
Mobile.  I can edit my SYM turnpoint/airport database for my local
area, removing "ghost" airports and adding non-charted landing areas.
Not easy to do in Winpilot (at least I couldn't find an easy way to do
it!).

It does take a little work during the off season, or when preparing for
a safari, but I like the result.  Plus it doesn't overlap airports and
co-located turnpoints (I can make them the same point, with unique
symbol).

It would be nice if we had updated US-wide lists of actual,
seen-with-eyeballs-from-the-ground, useable airports/airstrips.  With
the current GPS navigation/mapping equipment available, it would make
off-airport (or known landable location) landouts a much rarer event.

I've made several straight in final glides to airports that I had never
been to before, using my GPS, getting there just high enough to put the
gear down and land.  So far, every time it has been a good airport
(again, using carefully "vetted" local turnpoint data).  I would be
leery of doing that to a private strip on a sectional, though - too
often I've overflown them to find them long gone!

Wasn't there a project in the West US a few years ago to document known
landout locations?

Final suggestion - if each glider operation documented all the landable
airports within reasonable XC distance and used them for turnpoints
exclusively, it might be a start.  With AATs becoming the norm for
tasking, it makes sense to use only landable locations for turnpoints,
IMHO.

Eric,

I don't use the WinPilot database at all. My hardcopy map is from
SeeYou with landout locations (airports, airstrips, fields, etc) from
my own turnpoint database. My turnpoint database is created from
several well developed airfield and turnpoint databases. (Crystal
Squadron, Agua Fria River Racers, ASA, etc etc etc). Every year or two
I solicit help from my fellow rASArs to scrub this database using
satellite imagery, eyeballs on the ground, etc to tweak the database.

The same turnpoint database is loaded into both my WinPilot and LX7007.
But the LX7007 has its aviation database, which is updated once or
twice a year from their web site, and it seems to be pretty good.

Anything but those $#^* sectionals!

I did my first map printing at Kinkos by printing to PDF (in 11x17"
page size) from SeeYou (as described in my earlier post). I took the
PDF files to Kinkos on a thumb drive and printed and laminted them
right there. A good print-to-PDF solution is deskPDF from docudesk dot
com; a license is $20 US.

If you laminate them, here's a tip: pre-fold your map where you want
the creases, then laminate. This makes it much easier to fold it where
you want it folded after lamination.

Most Kinos have large format printers.  However, printing on anything larger
than 11x17 gets pricy.

I think this may end up being the best solution for creating and
managing your sectional charts.  Remember, the FAA frowns on a
non-current sectional in the cockpit.

A current chart is essential if you need airport frequency info or to
stay out of airspace you shouldn't be in.  (yes, checking with FSS is
also required before each flight to ensure nothing's changed)

Matt provides free sectional chart upgrades as new ones are released,
so I can download and print *current* chart segments as needed.  So
once you buy GlidePlan, you're set for a few years of free updates.
Or, you can "roll your own" tools as described in other posts, for at
least the same money and probably a bit more busywork to get to the
final product.

I use pdf995 (free nagware with $9.95 license) to generate an 11x17
document that I then scale to 8.5x11, which reduces it to near WAC
scale.  Text is small but readable.  I then put these pages into heavy
duty page protectors and "bind" the 5-10 pages that make up the area I
fly in.

Am looking forward to being able to import waypoints so I can create
custom and FAA legal charts for contest flying.
