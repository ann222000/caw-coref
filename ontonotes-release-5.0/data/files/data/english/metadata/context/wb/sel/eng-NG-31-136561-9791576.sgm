Congress Eyes Health Care Reform at State Level*
By Maya Schenwar
t r u t h o u t | Report

Wednesday 17 October 2007

In the past two Congressional sessions, 93 health care expansion bills
have been introduced, and nearly all have fallen flat. Hoping to break this
string of failures, a bipartisan coalition of senators and representatives
is urging Congress to consider state-based health care reform, in which
individual states use federal grants to try out a variety of different
health insurance plans.

&quot;While we currently lack a consensus approach to ensure all Americans
have access to adequate health services, a state-based model allows
experimentation with both conservative and progressive solutions that could
eventually be widely applied,&quot; the coalition wrote in an October 15 letter
to the Congressional subcommittees on health care. Members of the coalition
are promoting bipartisan state-based health care reform bills in both the
House and Senate.

The largest obstacle to the transformation of the health care system in
recent years has been a partisan deadlock, according to Senator Russ
Feingold (D-Wisconsin), a member of the coalition, upon introducing his
State-Based Health Care Reform Act, co-authored with Senator Lindsey Graham
(R-S. Carolina) in April. Feingold and Graham stand at opposite ends of the
political spectrum, as do Representatives Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) and
Tom Price (R-Georgia), authors of a similar bill in the House. &quot;Even though
Senator Graham and I support different methods of health care reform, we
both agree that this legislation presents a viable solution to the logjam
preventing reform,&quot; Feingold said.

Accordingly, the state-based health care proposal is not so much a
specific plan as it is an agreement to experiment. Under the legislation,
Congress would grant funding to several states to implement the health care
programs of their choice. Plans could range from single-payer systems to tax
incentives to employer-mandated coverage. States would be encouraged to
develop new and creative plans, according to Feingold.

All versions of the bill would require state proposals to pass Congress
before being implemented, and all would establish a national task force to
select, oversee and evaluate state projects. Participating states would be
held accountable for decreasing the number of uninsured residents and
keeping insurance affordable. Ideally, at the end of the grants' five-year
duration, certain plans would noticeably rise to the top.

Congress members on both sides of the aisle have a stake in this
legislation, according to a spokeswoman for Baldwin: It's a chance to show
that they're right. &quot;Congresswoman Baldwin believes that a single-payer plan
is the best approach, but she understands that we may need to prove its
effectiveness before we can adopt it nationally,&quot; she said. &quot;Her bill allows
us to test a variety of approaches to demonstrate what works and what
doesn't.&quot;

Graham, too, cited the appeal of letting government-based and
market-based health care programs &quot;compete head to head,&quot; both vying for
popular approval. &quot;I believe the private sector model will offer the best
approach in the long-run,&quot; Graham said in an April press release.

To some extent, state-based health care reform is already happening. The
Massachusetts Legislature passed a law last year mandating that all
residents purchase health insurance, with subsidies for low-income
individuals and insurance assistance requirements for large employers. In
California, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is pushing a universal health
care package that would require residents to buy health coverage. Residents
are by no means universally satisfied: Health care activists in both states
say the programs are rife with flaws, including deductibles that cost
families thousands of dollars per year.

However, though no one has perfected universal coverage yet, &quot;states are
leading the way,&quot; said Bernie Horn, policy director of the nonprofit Center
for Policy Alternatives, in a press release. &quot;And states would have a far
easier time constructing universal health care programs with just a little
help from the federal government.&quot;

Congressional advocates of state-based reform initiatives hope to
harness the momentum of the states currently transforming their health care
systems, in hopes that it will catch on - either prompting other states to
mimic successful programs, or leading to a national-level program that would
garner broad bipartisan support, according to Sarah Collins, assistant vice
president for the Program on the Future of Health Insurance at The
Commonwealth Fund, in an interview.

&quot;It would be more incremental, a slower way to move toward universal
coverage,&quot; Collins said, noting that motivation for policy change could vary
widely among states. The type of changes that happen could also vary, seeing
as both the progressive Brookings Institution and the conservative Heritage
Foundation have endorsed state-based health care reform legislation.

Although Collins said that she believes state-based health care would
ultimately move the country toward a simpler universal system, she noted
that in the short term, it may complicate insurance matters for individuals.
For example, residents of a universally insured state who move to a state
with market-based incentives would not only have to go through the hassle of
re-enrolling in a policy, they would lose a hefty list of benefits as well.
Multi-state employers would need to insure their workers differently based
on location.

The bills stand a good chance of passage, according to Collins, though
she was unsure of how soon they would be voted on. Before the release of the
bipartisan coalition's letter to the subcommittees on Monday, the bill
already had 74 cosponsors, with almost as many Republican signers as
Democrats.

&quot;Some of my friends are 'single-payer purists,'&quot; Baldwin said in a
recent speech to the Machinists Union in Wisconsin. &quot;They dig in their heels
and say we're pushing for single-payer and nothing else will do. My
response, after careful study, is that that day will not come until we can
demonstrate in a few states that it actually works.&quot;

I suggest that, at this early stage of the game, advocating health reform on
both the state and federal level is mutually reinforcing and not a conflict.
Our primary problem is breaking through the silence or disinformation on the
topic of SP and so using every vehicle we have is OK. Let’s hope that, later
on, we will face the problem of making a choice between state or federal
venues.

Some of us just visited with Congresswoman Betty McCollum’s staff to review
HR676, which she has not yet co-sponsored. If you live in MN CD4, now’s the
time to communicate with her at Saint Paul District Office 165 Western
Avenue North, Suite 17

Craig and Glen –

I like the sound of this. For many years, I have felt that the states should
be empowered to try different approaches (it’s a big country).

As for HR 676, I think that Rep. Baldwin got it right at the end of this
article. SP will likely need to be proven to work in a few states before it
goes national.

Even though true progressive reform may realistically be more
likely to occur at the state level before occurring nationally, does this

First off.... Craig, I want to thank you for keeping us all informed.
I applaud your determination. I imagine that you must feel a bit
lonely in your efforts since it seems as if you don't get much response.

Therefore, I am responding on this email. I think it may be worth
supporting, mostly because it does propose to send some federal
dollars into the effort of the health care problem which, aside from
the programs already funded by the feds. However, I am leery of yet
another attempt to foist national problems onto the states, much as I
admire Senator Feingold and trust his judgement. It would perhaps
slow down the effort toward universal health care and certainly
single payer at the federal level while they wait to see what the
states come up with. I would hope that if this bill passes it would
not mean that the federal legislature could avoid working on the
problem by sifting the work to the states.

But, all in all, it may be all we can get out of the federal govt.
May be worth supporting.

&gt; consider state-based health care reform, in which individual states
&gt; use federal grants to try out a variety of different health
&gt; insurance plans.

&gt;     &quot;While we currently lack a consensus approach to ensure all
&gt; Americans have access to adequate health services, a state-based
&gt; model allows experimentation with both conservative and progressive
&gt; solutions that could eventually be widely applied,&quot; the coalition
&gt; wrote in an October 15 letter to the Congressional subcommittees on
&gt; health care. Members of the coalition are promoting bipartisan
&gt; state-based health care reform bills in both the House and Senate.

&gt;     The largest obstacle to the transformation of the health care
&gt; system in recent years has been a partisan deadlock, according to
&gt; Senator Russ Feingold (D-Wisconsin), a member of the coalition,
&gt; upon introducing his State-Based Health Care Reform Act, co-
&gt; authored with Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S. Carolina) in April.
&gt; Feingold and Graham stand at opposite ends of the political
&gt; spectrum, as do Representatives Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisconsin) and Tom
&gt; Price (R-Georgia), authors of a similar bill in the House. &quot;Even
&gt; though Senator Graham and I support different methods of health
&gt; care reform, we both agree that this legislation presents a viable
&gt; solution to the logjam preventing reform,&quot; Feingold said.

&gt;     Accordingly, the state-based health care proposal is not so
&gt; much a specific plan as it is an agreement to experiment. Under the
&gt; legislation, Congress would grant funding to several states to
&gt; implement the health care programs of their choice. Plans could
&gt; range from single-payer systems to tax incentives to employer-
&gt; mandated coverage. States would be encouraged to develop new and
&gt; creative plans, according to Feingold.

&gt;     All versions of the bill would require state proposals to pass
&gt; Congress before being implemented, and all would establish a
&gt; national task force to select, oversee and evaluate state projects.
&gt; Participating states would be held accountable for decreasing the
&gt; number of uninsured residents and keeping insurance affordable.
&gt; Ideally, at the end of the grants' five-year duration, certain
&gt; plans would noticeably rise to the top.

&gt;     Congress members on both sides of the aisle have a stake in
&gt; this legislation, according to a spokeswoman for Baldwin: It's a
&gt; chance to show that they're right. &quot;Congresswoman Baldwin believes
&gt; that a single-payer plan is the best approach, but she understands
&gt; that we may need to prove its effectiveness before we can adopt it
&gt; nationally,&quot; she said. &quot;Her bill allows us to test a variety of
&gt; approaches to demonstrate what works and what doesn't.&quot;

&gt;     Graham, too, cited the appeal of letting government-based and
&gt; market-based health care programs &quot;compete head to head,&quot; both
&gt; vying for popular approval. &quot;I believe the private sector model
&gt; will offer the best approach in the long-run,&quot; Graham said in an
&gt; April press release.

&gt;     To some extent, state-based health care reform is already
&gt; happening. The Massachusetts Legislature passed a law last year
&gt; mandating that all residents purchase health insurance, with
&gt; subsidies for low-income individuals and insurance assistance
&gt; requirements for large employers. In California, Governor Arnold
&gt; Schwarzenegger is pushing a universal health care package that
&gt; would require residents to buy health coverage. Residents are by no
&gt; means universally satisfied: Health care activists in both states
&gt; say the programs are rife with flaws, including deductibles that
&gt; cost families thousands of dollars per year.

&gt;     However, though no one has perfected universal coverage yet,
&gt; &quot;states are leading the way,&quot; said Bernie Horn, policy director of
&gt; the nonprofit Center for Policy Alternatives, in a press release.
&gt; &quot;And states would have a far easier time constructing universal
&gt; health care programs with just a little help from the federal
&gt; government.&quot;

&gt;     Congressional advocates of state-based reform initiatives hope
&gt; to harness the momentum of the states currently transforming their
&gt; health care systems, in hopes that it will catch on - either
&gt; prompting other states to mimic successful programs, or leading to
&gt; a national-level program that would garner broad bipartisan
&gt; support, according to Sarah Collins, assistant vice president for
&gt; the Program on the Future of Health Insurance at The Commonwealth
&gt; Fund, in an interview.

&gt;     &quot;It would be more incremental, a slower way to move toward
&gt; universal coverage,&quot; Collins said, noting that motivation for
&gt; policy change could vary widely among states. The type of changes
&gt; that happen could also vary, seeing as both the progressive
&gt; Brookings Institution and the conservative Heritage Foundation have
&gt; endorsed state-based health care reform legislation.

&gt;     Although Collins said that she believes state-based health care
&gt; would ultimately move the country toward a simpler universal
&gt; system, she noted that in the short term, it may complicate
&gt; insurance matters for individuals. For example, residents of a
&gt; universally insured state who move to a state with market-based
&gt; incentives would not only have to go through the hassle of re-
&gt; enrolling in a policy, they would lose a hefty list of benefits as
&gt; well. Multi-state employers would need to insure their workers
&gt; differently based on location.

&gt;     The bills stand a good chance of passage, according to Collins,
&gt; though she was unsure of how soon they would be voted on. Before
&gt; the release of the bipartisan coalition's letter to the
&gt; subcommittees on Monday, the bill already had 74 cosponsors, with
&gt; almost as many Republican signers as Democrats.

&gt;     &quot;Some of my friends are 'single-payer purists,'&quot; Baldwin said
&gt; in a recent speech to the Machinists Union in Wisconsin. &quot;They dig
&gt; in their heels and say we're pushing for single-payer and nothing
&gt; else will do.   My response, after careful study, is that that day
&gt; will not come until we can demonstrate in a few states that it
&gt; actually works.&quot;
