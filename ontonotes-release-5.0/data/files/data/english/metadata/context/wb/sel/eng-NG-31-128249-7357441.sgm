Hello,

The report below on resistance, among US active-duty troops to the war in
Iraq deviates from the usual subject matter of this listserve. However, in
my view, the US-led war on Iraq and the US and global militarization it
involves are closely linked to Israeli militarization and Israeli use of
state violence, on the one hand. And the war resistance movement all over
the world is linked in many ways to the anti-militarist and anti-occupation
movement in Israel.

The report was forwarded by New Profile supporter Max Watts, who for many
years now (some of them jointly with David Cortwright, whose influential
book is mentioned below) has researched and documented resistance movements
inside the militaries.

Sisters and Brothers:
I'm sending this to more people than asked. If you don't want it, just
delete. If you would like any of the pictures in higher resolution (for
example, for printing), I can send you the originals (you can do the editing
of the pictures for your use). I wrote four versions of this storyfor
different newspapers and websites; it will go to progressive audiences all
over the world. The longest and most detailed is below. If anyone wants to
use it but to eliminate some of the detail (like who Jon gave credit to),
that's your call. Or Jon's quote near the end, which wasn't to the news
conference, but in one of the interviews. Don't make any substantial changes
to the first 2/3 of the article without consulting me, please.

Also, for those who didn't hear, today's action at Congress got good
publicity. Liam and Jabbar were great leading off the news on National
Public Radio. They and all of you deserve another round of applause.

Active-duty GIs: the Congress had better listen to them

'Appeal for Redress' submits over 1,000 signatures on ending Iraq occupation

By John Catalinotto

Norfolk, Va.

Twenty-five active duty GIs reflected the growing opposition to the U.S.
occupation of Iraq within the U.S. military itself by publicly acknowledging
at a news conference Jan. 15 in Norfolk, Va., that they had signed the
"Appeal for Redress." This appeal, which has been circulating since last
Oct. 23 on a website, is a statement offering a view of the Iraq occupation
that differs pointedly from that of Pres. George W. Bush.

The Appeal for Redress, crafted so as to be legal not only under the U.S.
Constitution but under military rulings, is simply: "As a patriotic American
proud to serve the nation in uniform, I respectfully urge my political
leaders in Congress to support the prompt withdrawal of all American
military forces and bases from Iraq. Staying in Iraq will not work and is
not worth the price. It is time for U.S. troops to come home." The news
conference ended with the 25 GIs reading the appeal aloud in unison.

Organizers had chosen the date to connect their appeal with the legacy of
Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr's struggle for justice and peace. Some 35
active-duty troops, reservists, including Iraq veterans, other veterans and
the day's speakers filled the stage. Banners hung carefully and neatly on
the inside walls of the Unitarian Universalist Church-and one hanging on the
outside greeted the 100 people, supporters and media, who filled the church.
One banner stage left held the telling message: "Support the troops; listen
to them."

And those who came, along with Norfolk's TV stations and some national and
international media, listened. They heard, if they listened carefully, that
a new movement of active-duty troops was starting to speak with its own
voice. They heard a strong section of the civilian anti-war movement
pledging to support this new GI movement and to welcome it.

Some of the appeal's drafters and early organizers spoke out at the meeting
and clarified their position with a series of non-stop interviews with
television and press media and documentary film-makers for four hours. These
active-duty troops included Navy Seamen Jonathan Hutto and Javier Capella,
Petty Officer Dave Rogers and Marine Sergeant Liam Madden among others.

Hutto and Capella are stationed on the Aircraft Carrier Theodore Roosevelt
with a complement of over 3,000 officers and enlisted sailors stationed in
Norfolk. Hutto, an African-American man who grew up in Atlanta under the
strong influence of that city's movement for civil rights and the strong
role model of his activist mother, helped focus the conference on Martin
Luther King and his opposition to the Vietnam War. Capella is from Puerto
Rico and works together with Hutto on the Roosevelt.

A generation's call to conscience

Madden, from Vermont, who is stationed in the Marine base in Quantico, Va.,
and has only a week of active duty left in his contract, said, "We need to
pay attention to King's words more than one day a year." He read the Appeal
for Redress, which the movement drafted in collaboration with J.E. McNeil
from the center for Conscience & War in such a way that active-duty troops
have the legal right to sign, protected by the Military Whistleblower
Protection Act (DOD directive 7050.6).

Madden was adamant that the appeal was not aimed at making a political
statement: "Not one more of my brothers should die for a lie. This is not
politics. It is our generation's call to conscience."

The organizers said that as of the day before the news conference, some
1,031 signatures of the group had been verified as being from armed forces
members, most of them active duty, including over 800 enlisted men or women,
from bases all over the world, and 35 from troops in Iraq.

Among the main supporters were at least a dozen members of the Iraq Veterans
Against the War (IVAW). This group had up to now concentrated at organizing
returning veterans of the Iraq occupation and getting them involved in the
anti-war movement. The IVAW speaker said the group now also uses the appeal
to reach out to active-duty personnel.

Jabbar Magruder of IVAW, a sergeant still active in the National Guard in
California, said he would be joining Liam Madden and others on Jan. 16 to
meet with Dennis Kucinich and other representatives in Congress to present
the signatures of active-duty service people to them and to visit others on
the Hill with their message. Nancy Lessin of Military Families Speak Out and
Michael McPherson of Veterans For Peace also had representatives supporting
the new active-duty movement. Community organizer Tom Palumbo spoke for the
local Tidewater chapter of Veterans for Peace.

Phil Wilayto of the Virginian Anti-War Network (VAWN) made a dramatic appeal
for the civilian movement to throw its full support behind the GIs and to
defend their right to speak out against the war.

"This administration has betrayed our armed forces," said Lt. j.g. Fabian
Bouthillette, who was part of a delegation from the Military Project in New
York, which is connected with the GI Special web newspaper and has been
active reaching out at armories in the city to National Guard troops. "I
actually believe that the conduct of this administration is more detrimental
to the Constitution than anything else," Bouthillette said. "This was begun
on an immoral, illegal basis. And we were lied to."

We must listen to the men and women" who are in the military and who are
taking the courageous move of speaking out against the war, said David
Cortwright, author of the book, Soldiers in Revolt. A year earlier, Hutto
had read this book of the GI movement during the Vietnam War, which inspired
him to begin the Appeal for Redress.

Hutto praised the contribution of those who organized service people during
the war against Vietnam, including organizers of Veterans for Peace and of
the American Servicemen's Union who were participating. He also thanked
local activist Ann Williams, who played a big role in organizing the day's
activity, the people from the Unitarian Universalist Church who had worked
hard on setting up the hall, and local organizer John Long, who stayed up
all night preparing the attractive program.

Hutto, Madden, Rogers and the other outspoken GIs gave nonstop interviews
for four hours following the news conference. One of the favorite questions
from interviewers was to ask for a comparison between the GI movement today
and that during the Vietnam War, which those currently in the service knew
through their reading.

Congress shouldn't ignore 'Appeal'

Hutto said, that "some in the GI movement during the Vietnam era were
anti-military and anti-authority. We, on the other hand, are just opposing
some of the policies of the military. We oppose the stop-loss decision,
which keeps people on active duty beyond their contract; we oppose the lies
about the war. We are looking for a legal and constructive manner to oppose
these policies.

"We don't believe people have the right to slander our movement. On the
other hand, if the government doesn't heed the Appeal for Redress" and just
ignores the opinion of all the enlisted people, you could expect to see "an
even more massive protest" that could in the future move beyond simply
raising the issues with Congress.

Before the conference ended, Hutto pointed out that before King made his
famous April 1967 anti-war speech from Riverside Church in New York, King
himself had come to a realization: if he were going to advise non-violence
as a tactic in the movement for civil rights, he would have to start by
insisting that the U.S. government-"the greatest purveyor of
violence"--desist from its warlike foreign policy.

Hutto then introduced three active-duty GIs who read portions of King's
April 1967 talk.
