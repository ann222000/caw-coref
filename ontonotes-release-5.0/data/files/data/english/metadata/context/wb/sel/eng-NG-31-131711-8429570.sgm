Wow!

I am finally happy with my 2 main trax for EXTREME. Together these two
trax together are about 12 minutes long. The background is very basic,
but the trumpet playing on them is over the cliff , outrageous,
original.  EXTREME looks to be THE most talked about trumpet Cd of
this generation. I guarantee that you have never heard any trumpet
playing like this before.  I re-recorded the trumpet traxs for the two
longest songs Tuesday(They mirror each other), plus I recorded a brand
new song named &quot; Launch &quot; that will be trax # 1 on the Cd. Honestly
Launch alone will be worth the price of the Extreme Cd. After hearing
Launch you will have a pretty good idea what EXTREME is all about, the
most extreme range , false valving , notes bent in pitch all over the
place up and down like a roller coaster (The original vision for the
Cd), shakes, zips dips and dives baby!! Hang on tight for the sonic
ride of a lifetime.

A guy must be at least half out of his mind to release this EXTREME
Cd.

I gotta get this music out there,you all deserve to hear it,  it is
going to change how the trumpet is heard and or played forever. Like
Star 93 many of you at first won't like it, but it sure ain't
symphonic music. I have been listening to EXTREME tonight, I am well
pleased with it now.

Honestly, as a professional trumpet player I have never ever heard any
trumpet playing before that sounds anything at all like EXTREME, it is
as if  Maynard meets Zappa , I ain't jokin baby , and you can't tell
which musician influenced me more. After Tuesday I have no choice but
to put all of my eggs in one &quot;EXTREME&quot; basket and now that I have
these trax release EXTREME first.

I have also asked the owner of a popular trumpet website to consider
adding a free sample of Extreme to his website. I sent it to him this
week, I will let you know if that sample goes up.

Just about all of the recording is now done, it is time to compile
these songs into their 4 Cd's and duplicate them and sell them.

I guarantee you that whoever has a first pre release edition of
EXTREME will own something that will be a great collectible that will
go up in value.

Joy comes when we persevere ahead along in our hard journey thru this
life after those who have made an investment in our lives have become
who we are.

No matter how many times or how hard you fall, get back up.

God bless you all,

If you are a &quot;professional&quot; trumpet player that would mean you receive
payment for performing and must file taxes.

Be careful what you claim so it doesn't come back to haunt you.

Hey Mikey,

there's a website called houndbite where you can post audio clips. Why
don't you put some up there of this amazing trumpet playing of yours
so we can all hear some samples!

Too damn funny Jim.  I really wish the fake Rev would put some clips
up for us to listen to. I really would give it a good listen. I'm
betting he won't because he's just not too good. One of my friends -

Houston Symphony. I'd listen to it with him because he's a much better

Really Jeffrey?

I played a sample of EXTREME for a pro trombonist (John) today, his
first comment was

&quot;That sounds a lot like Maynard&quot;

I  describe it more as Maynard meets Zappa.

His second comment was  &quot;That sound reminds me of Maynard's
&quot;Conquistador Cd.&quot;

I loved Maynard's trumpet sound , it is the Maynard Ferguson
Conquistador sound that I love the most, and you can really hear that
in my sound on Extreme.

In no way am I trying to copy Maynard, that is not what I did at all,
I instead went where the sound took me and I am well pleased with
where i ended up.

Growing up I most often was either listening to a Maynard Ferguson Cd
or a Chuck Mangione Cd, and my music has two sides to it , the Maynard
trumpet side and the Chuck flugelhorn side. Extreme has the Maynard
trumpet side. I will say this, I started recording the original  two
long trax for extreme right after Maynard died, but I re-recorded
those trumpet trax this week. I think Maynard's death influenced the
early parts of Extreme's sounds, and I am referring to the false valve
stuff not the high note range stuff which has more of a Van Cleve -
Sandoval sound which is higher and thinner than Maynard's top range.

Like I said this is not a Maynard tribute Cd or a Maynard wannabe or a
Maynard copy cat Cd, my sound is all original, but ALL of the
influences on my music have played a part in its evolution.

Jim said:

His playing is to real - real obnoxious!

I will say this, for many people Jim is right, Extreme is a Cd that
was specifically designed for fans of lead trumpet players not first
trumpet player per se , if you don't like Maynard's more freakish
sounding stuff  you most likely will not like Extreme, If you do not
like Extreme you will not hurt my feelings, my wife does not care for
Extreme, she also does not like to listen to Maynard.  If you love
Maynard's freakish sound, esp. the false valving stuff, if you like
bent pitches , dips dives, slides etc. you will love Extreme, Extreme
is what it is, extreme trumpet playing, not for a faint of heart
symphonic music fan.

Jeffrey said :

I really wish the fake Rev would put some clips
up for us to listen to.

Jeffrey I told you that I am going to do that. But I am attempting to
have them posted on a popular trumpet website, I sent a sample of my
music out to the owner of the website who lives on the west coast and
he should be receiving it towards the end of this week. I will let you
know if my attempt to have him post a sample of Extreme is successful.
If not, I will be looking for another place to post a sample of
Extreme.

I really would give it a good listen.

And you should

I'm
betting he won't because he's just not too good.

That is simply untrue Jeffrey , and that is the entire point of me
posting a free sample from Extreme. The jazz world has yet to hear
even one note of what Paisley and I have produced, yet we have already
been unfairly pre judged.

Like I said , not everyone will like Extreme, but NO serious musician
will listen to Extreme and say that I am &quot;Not too good&quot; , I can
guarantee you that , but they might say something like &quot;Man that guy's
nuts&quot;.

One of my friends -
lives just three houses down from me is a trumpet player with the
Houston Symphony.

I doubt any symphonic trumpet player will be a huge fan of Extreme,
unless they own over five Maynard Cd's or more that is.

I'd listen to it with him because he's a much better
judge than I. Still betting that ******** won't put anything up for
free........

Then you will lose that bet because it IS my intention to put up a
free sample of Extreme.

God bless you,

Mikey

No I am being serious, man I must be crazy to put out the Extreme Cd,
its so out there baby, way way way out there, but it is what it always
was designed to be, a Cd displaying how far over the edge trumpet
playing can get without falling off the cliff.

I toned it down just a little because I was uncomfortable with a few
of the trax that had some horn parts that perhaps went over the cliff,
but now I am only on the edge as far as you can get without falling
over.

Point being you gotta be nuts to record trax this risky, but hey, its
me mikey, and that is where I am in my comfort zone as a lead trumpet
player, i want you to ask yourself 'Hey, how did he do that&quot;.

If you ever liked Chase, Maynard, Zappa  or Ellis, but a copy of
EXTREME and you will not be dissapointed.

Extreme is the NEXT generation, MY generations lead trumpet music.
Extreem will set the tone for more things to come , we can not live in
the past, and i refuse to live in the past, I also refuse to play like
i am in a Maynard or Chuck cover band.

It is a new season fro lead trumpet music.

Richard you are all wrong, my trumpet playing in 1980 was total crap
compared to Extreme. I play better today than I ever have(Except
perhaps the ultra high notes which were better before I became sick).

phone # that is on my website, just to prove that I am for real, I
will let you listen to some of Extreme.

Update on posting a soundclip of Extreme.

Great news!

I just received an email a few minutes ago from my other top choice of
websites to have a sound clip of Extreme posted and the person who
owns the second website is also interested in a sound clip from
EXTREME, so I will go to Paisley's tomorrow and make a copy to send
off to website # 2, so hopefully a sound clip of EXTREME will be up on
one or more websites very soon.

God bless you,

Mikey

It's funny, there's a lot of talk by the &quot;dr&quot; about putting samples up
on websites and &quot;sending copies&quot; to various unnamed trumpet websites,
but of course no sample on the totl website.  First it was finished,
then it was not finished, then it was about to be released (but
donations were needed to release it) and then the &quot;dr&quot; was in the
studio &quot;engineering trax&quot; ...

And of course, the usual claims about how various &quot;professional
players&quot; listened and proclaimed that the &quot;dr&quot; is the greatest ...
with absolutely no independent confirmation.

Jim, I already extended an offer to you and to several others to take
a listen to EXTREME.

You know how to reach me, call my bluff and you will see that EXTREME
is for real.

You want to take a listen to a sample of EXTREME,  or do you want to
talk about how it is not constructed properly before you have ever
heard it?

As I mentioned earlier, my webmaster (Rick) has cancer and he has not
been to work in months. With the Mikey Cartoon TM on the front page
not just anyone can update that website or they will mess it up.

Any bridge worth building is not built over night, it takes a lot of
time and patience.

EXTREME was not built overnight. Try building a quality bridge
sometime with no money.

I said that a sample of EXTREME will be posted on the net and it
will , but that might also take some time.

I am NOT going to get sidetracked and fall into a pit by those who
want to make this personal.  Up until now those who can not play a
trumpet as well as I do have had their fun telling lies about my
trumpet playing abilities, but I will have the last word, and that
word will be...

EXTREME

Please visit my new myspace page.

http://www.myspace.com/thetrumpetofthelord

It is currently under construction.

A free mp3 of Alexsis (A song from the Trinity CD which is now also
the last song of the EXTREME CD) is already posted on my
http://www.myspace.com/thetrumpetofthelord myspace page.  Alexsis is a
soft mello flugelhorn song that is not a sample of my extreme trumpet
playing. By Monday we hope to have up  two other lead trumpet songs
from EXTREME TM called Launch and Midnight , both contain examples of
extreme trumpet playing on them.

I have now also sent via snail mail Launch and Midnight to the owners
of two popular trumpet websites, and hopefully they will be posted up
there very soon as well.

God Bless You.
