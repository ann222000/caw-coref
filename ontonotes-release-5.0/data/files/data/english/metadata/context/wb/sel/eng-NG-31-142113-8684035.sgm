A Night to Remember

By Â Naseema Mall

Youth 4 the Future Correspondent - South Africa

It was not what I had anticipated; in fact, it was much more than
that. The Muslim Forever nasheed concert that took place on the night
of July 14 was spectacular and entertaining in every moment.

Nasheed concerts are not something that Muslim communities in South
Africa are accustomed to, perhaps more so in conservative Durban,
where humor and entertainment, juxtaposed with religion, are seen as a
paradox by some. However, since Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings
be upon him) enjoyed nasheeds and poetry, sometimes even when
preparing for battles, and he entertained Ethiopian spear dancers in
the masjid, it is refreshing to see the Institute for Learning and
Motivation, South Africa (ILM-SA) encourage Muslims to involve in such
activities.

Three well-known artists, Zain Bhikha (South Africa), Dawud Wharnsby
Ali (Canada) and Ahmad Bukhatir (United Arab Emirates), entertained
the audience with old renditions and some new songs from their to-be
released albums. South Africans are quite familiar with Bhikha and
Ali, and they welcomed slightly familiar artist Bukhatir with calls
for an encore. Durban dwellers (aka Durbanites) were no less
entertained by the nascent youth group Waahed, which was particularly
popular with the younger crowd, but was appreciated by the older ones
as well.

While it was clear after the show that Durbanites thoroughly enjoyed
the event, it was not made obvious during the show itself. A subdued
audience were rather reticent when it came to applauding, unsure
whether such acknowledgement would be contrary to the deen.While Ahmad
Sheik and singer Ali assured the audience that it is permissible to
applaud with at least calls of takbir, the audience remained
cautiously cheerful.

Nonetheless, the artists provided much-needed entertainment to a
community that is seeking more and more true understanding of Islam,
and many in the audience expressed their appreciation during the
interval and after the event. 19-year-old Maymoona was rather
cheerful, &quot;I'm having so much of fun. I wish we had more things like
this. I'm here with my family and some of my friends, and we're all
having a really great time.&quot; Also, 23-year-old Ashraf was no less
enthusiastic, &quot;The concert is just what we need. I particularly love
Waahed. I think their songs are fantastic.&quot;

Durbanites were also pleased to host Australian Sheikh Tawfique
Chowdhury who augmented the event by inspiring Muslims to delve into
the teachings of Islam and understand our religion better. ILM-SA's
Fatima Asmal explains, &quot;Muslim Foreveris a motivational event aimed at
inspiring people to draw closer to Allah by making them feel motivated
to study Islam, hence the inclusion of Sheikh Tawfique Chowdhury who
was extremely well-received in this event. There was a notice that
went up on some masjid boards, courtesy of an Islamic organization,
speaking out against nasheed events. Al-hamdu lillah, our event is
held in compliance with the Shari`ah - separate seating for men and
women, no musical instruments, etc. So this notice was probably not
directed at us.&quot;

What is special about such events is that it is entertainment for the
whole family and allows parents to attend a function where they can
take their teenagers knowing that they are in a safe environment.

Fatima Asmal, &quot;The event is special to us in the sense that it brings
families together in an Islamic setting, whereas they could be getting
together at the movies or at some beach event. However, our intention
is not for people to be wowed by nasheeds and to leave it at that;
they should be motivated by the words of the nasheeds to want to draw
closer to Allah. And judging by the number of people who came to
purchase lecture CDs afterwards and to inquire about Islamic courses,
I would say we were successful in this respect, Al-hamdu lillah.&quot;

ILM-SA did not ignore the fact that the less-privileged also deserve
to be entertained. At a private concert held for just the orphans,
local artists and Ali wowed the little ones with beautiful nasheeds.

&quot;Over the past few months, ILM-SA has been volunteering its assistance
to Islamic Relief KwaZulu Natal. Totally shocked by the dire poverty
in some of the areas in which Islamic Relief works and more so by the
number of children affected by this poverty, we decided that we just
wanted to have a fun day for orphans and underprivileged children. A
day in which we served them and showed them who's important. A day in
which we treated them and made them feel loved, and also to make the
day more meaningful by making sure each child left the venue with a
bag comprising some essentials in their day-to-day lives: soap,
candles, blankets, and stationery. We are truly indebted to our
sponsors, especially to Blossom Margarine who really opened their
hearts to assist us in making this day enjoyed by all,&quot; explains
Asmal.

The Muslim Forever concert was entertaining and inspiring, and it left
Muslim Durbanites yearning for more.

A Day to Remember
****************

World Trade Center
World Trade Center, former building complex in lower Manhattan, New
York City, consisting of seven buildings and a shopping concourse on a
16-acre (6.5-hectare) site; it was destroyed by a terrorist attack on
Sept. 11, 2001. Prior to its destruction, the World Trade Center had
been the world's largest commercial complex, home to many businesses,
government agencies, and international trade organizations. Most
prominent among its structures were the 110-story rectangular twin
towers, one rising to 1,362 ft (415 m) and the other to 1,368 ft (417
m), with floors roughly an acre in size. Designed by Minoru Yamasaki
and Emery Roth, the towers and concourse portion of the center were
completed in 1973 at a cost of some $750 million. For a brief period
(until the completion of the Sears Tower in Chicago in 1974), the
World Trade towers were the tallest buildings in the world. They
remained the largest structures on the Eastern Seaboard of the United
States, an internationally known landmark and tourist attraction
rising high above the skyline of lower Manhattan.

In 1993 a terrorist car-bomb explosion damaged portions of the
complex, killing six people and causing more than $300 million in
damage. Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and nine other Islamic extremists were
convicted of conspiracy and other charges related to the bombing in
1993, and the so-called mastermind, Ramzi Yousef, was convicted in
1998. On Sept. 11, 2001, a second terrorist attack, in which two
hijacked commercial jetliners were crashed into the towers, ignited
huge, intense fires in the upper stories of both buildings, weakening
them and leading to their collapse. Other structures in the complex
were completely or partially destroyed as a result, and many
surrounding buildings were severely damaged. More than 2,700 people,
including the passengers and crew of the airliners and several hundred
emergency personnel responding to the initial fires, lost their lives;
more than 7,000 people were injured.

I think there's a general perception that Islam means a dull, grey,
humorless and artless world. Possibly there are fundamentalist Islamic
sects or groups that see it that way, but that's probably more because
they're fundamentalist kill-joys somewhere to the right of the
roundheads when it comes to colour, decoration and aesthetic concerns.

Whilst on holiday recently I spent an afternoon at the excellent
Gulbenkian Collection in Lisbon (and I'll add that IMO Lisbon is a top
notch destination if you're wanting to do something other than party
or lie around on a beach with luridly coloured cocktails with
umbrellas stuck in them).

The Gulbenkian is arranged thematically, with the various rooms
representing various eras and/or countries.

One of these rooms, a pretty large one, was a display of middle-
eastern arts and crafts Â from the 15th to 17th centuries. You might
read &quot;middle-eastern&quot; as &quot;Islamic&quot; if you care.

I was astonished by the richness of the colours and designs on
display. Beautiful illuminated Quranic manuscripts from the 15th
century with vivid colors and exquisite illustrations. More surprising
in a way were the many examples of decorative objects from homes in
places like Persia (as it then was) and Syria. Wonderful panels of
richly coloured and patterned tiles, a decorative fireplace etc. Not
to mention some lovely pieces of jewellery and some beautifully
embroidered clothing.

It gave nothing away in terms of craftsmanship and richly coloured eye
candy to the nearby room of 16th and 17th chinese arts and crafts.

My sister and her family head off to Mauritius several times a decade. Â I've
never been there, so cannot imagine why it would be a better destination
than, for example, Port Elizabeth, for simply lounging on the beach. Â But
then my idea of a holiday doesn't include spending any more time in the sun
than is strictly necessary.
