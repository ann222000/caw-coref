probably in order to get rid of me, one official said, &quot;Why
don't you go to the Higher Appointments branch, at Tavis-
tock Square?  I'll give you a card.&quot;  Full of hope I went to
Tavistock Square.  Wonderful promises were made to me.

have to go at your own expense.&quot;

across England and into Wales.  The Station was a shocking
distance from the place of interview.  I trudged through the
streets of Cardigan
