William Carter, a Judge of the Albany City Court in New York, is what you might call a judicial activist. In November 2004 a prisoner named Talib Alsaifullah was brought before this distinguished jurist on charges of midemeanor assault and loitering. Talib became agitated and said he no longer wanted to participate in the proceeding, whereupon Judge Carter "became angry and, without adjourning the proceeding, abruptly removed his glasses, got up from the bench, removed his judicial robe and dropped it to the floor and proceeded rapidly in the direction of [Talib] in a manner indicating his purpose was to confront" the prisoner. “You want a piece of me?” said the Judge to the prisoner. The guards hustled Talib out of the courtroom before the gladiators could get close enough to exchange blows.

In March 2005 Judge Carter disregarded certain procedural rules when he let another prisoner out of custody on bail. The prisoner reciprocated by giving the finger to one of the officers in the courtroom. When the officer complained, the Judge told him, “If you are so upset about it, why don’t you just thump the shit [out] of him outside the courthouse, because I am not going to do anything about it.”

The New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct determined that Carter failed to discharge his obligation to be “patient, dignified and courteous” to litigants and others and to observe and maintain appropriate decorum in the courtroom. The punishment: censure.

Thank God that there was "no claim of ethnic or other bias-related motivation for [Carter's] conduct." Both Carter and Talib are African-American.

I'm not the lawyer here, but that sounds like Assault Under Color Authority (or the equivalent) to me. That's usually a felony, isn't it?

Ack, that should be "Assault Under Color of Authority", obviously. Preview would have been my friend.

Heh, if the TSA tackles you while under Terrorist condition Red, that would be an Assault Under Color Authority.
