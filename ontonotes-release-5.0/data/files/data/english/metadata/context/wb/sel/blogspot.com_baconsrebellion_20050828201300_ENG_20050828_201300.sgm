I Will Not Lie, Cheat or Steal: A Draft Blogger Code of Conduct
</HEADLINE>

We talked a lot about a blogger "code of conduct" at the Sorensen
Blog Summit, but nobody offered one as an example, so perhaps we were
describing an elephant to a blind man. Since I happen to believe a code
would be a good thing for many bloggers, I thought I'd draft the kind of
code that I envision.

My code has three basic parts: why I blog, how I will blog, and what
I'll do if something goes wrong. If my model were to be adopted, every
blogger would have a different why, a similar how, and a slightly
variable what. Here is my rough draft:

1. I blog under my legal name to stimulate discussion of important
issues and media coverage of those issues. The opinions I offer on those
issues are my own, arrived at from my own reading, research, and
personal experiences. I do not seek nor will I accept any payment for
expressing opinions without advance notification to my readers.
Occasionally, I will post satirical material that will appear similar to
my factual work, but this material will be easily identifiable.

2. I will always credit the work of others and provide links to that
work wherever possible.

3. I will not knowingly publish information that is false or
incorrect. Should I publish anything shown to be false or incorrect, I
will offer a correction and an apology, if appropriate, as quickly as
possible, in at least as visible a position as the original false or
incorrect information appeared.

4. I will avoid personal attacks or unfair characterizations of the
subjects of my published works and the readers who offer comments.

5. If I perform the work of a newsgathering journalist in the course
of my blogging, I will endeavor to follow generally accepted codes of
journalistic conduct, including shielding sources when the reason is
explained.

6. I will not censor or edit the feedback I receive except for foul
language or malicious intent. I will endeavor to be accessible to my
readers and to respond to their complaints and suggestions.

A lot of summit bloggers seemed to think that a code was unnecessary
because they believed their integrity stood on its own. While that may
be true, a new reader might not know me from a drunken lout hollering on
the corner. I would want that reader to have some means of verifying
that, unlike the drunk, I'll stand by what I was hollering the next
morning.

It's a draft. Questions, comments, suggestions, or gripes are
welcomed.

1. People post anonymously or pseudonymously for a variety of
legitimate reasons--and legitimacy may well be in the eye of the
beholder, but in the eye of the author of the blog is where it finds
ultimate judgment. Explaining why one blogs under a pseudonym may well
betray the identity of the blogger, or provide at least a tool for those
who would seek to out him from behind the curtain. I agree insofar as
each blogger and commenter should not impersonate someone he is not (for
example, there ought not to be any other Will Vehrs blogging out there,
unless there's another person named Will Vehrs, which most of us would
find unlikely--and even then "first come, first served" issues lead one
to wonder whether the late-comer should defer to the original), and that
those who post and comment anonymously should at least use a consistent
name.

On the other hand, any conflicts of interest (like payment for
blogging, in cash or kind), should be disclosed, as should prior
personal or professional relationships that may lead to a reasonable
perception of bias. This places control in the hands of the pseudonymous
blogger: if he is unprepared to make the disclosure, he must eschew the
topic. There is, perhaps, an overlooked connection between a source of
information (particularly a politician) whose motive in providing the
information is to surreptitiously introduce it into the public arena
without attribution; because so many of these quasi-journalistic blogs
are preoccupied with scooping news, and such blogs rise in fame based on
their ability to scoop news, in some ways information can itself be an
in-kind payment to a blogger. Since I don't count my blog among the
quasi-journalistic blogs, I don't feel suited to propose a solution to
that quandry.

2. It's not unheard of for a person, however sincerely but
oversensitively, to mistake a policy disagreement for a personal attack,
particularly when sarcasm or irony provide the foil for the rebuttal.
Unless we can establish a standard for what constitutes a personal
attack, it's difficult to rule them out completely, because even
well-intended bloggers could get caught up in the miscommunication.

3. Blog liars and plagiarists should be excommunicated or ostracised
(whatever you want to call removal from the blogrolls of all members of
the ethical covenant).

4. Editing comments is tricky. Editing feedback, whether positive or
negative, is rude, but there is a gray area between "feedback" and
"obscenity" that the broad statement in the draft doesn't address. These
could include the outing of a pseudonymous blogger, for example, which
if done maliciously would fall under the proposal, but a pseudonymous
blogger should retain the ability to enforce his privacy at least within
the realm of his own blog--however innocent the intentions of the
commenter. There's also the issue of the blog qua public forum versus
the blog qua personal journal. To an extent that a blog is held out as
the latter, its author should retain ultimate control over the
contributions of all commenters. This should be self-regulating: if a
commenter feels that his comments have been improperly edited, he can
always stop visiting and/or commenting on that blog, and to publicize
the occurence on his own blog (if he has one).

5. As alluded to in my #3 above, the only way any code of conduct is
enforceable is if--like NATO--there's a collective response mechanism.
Penalties for violating the covenant could range from publication of the
offense on all members' blogs to removal of the offending blog from all
the members' blogrolls. But, because this sort of collective response
obligation may impose upon the individual, dissenting blogger (and don't
we all crave our autonomy?), this feature makes the whole idea of the
code of conduct unattractive.

6. Because we're autonomous, and because most features of the
proposed code of conduct are self-regulating in the sense that anyone
who doesn't like what someone else is doing can unilaterally impose the
penalties suggested in my #5 above, the code of conduct doesn't really
seem necessary. If A doesn't like the way B runs his blog, A can do
whatever he wants to do in response (hopefully within the realm of good
taste) without (a) having his response watered down by a committee
designed to find a compromise for collective response or (b) imposing
such a collective response on less-willing members of the covenant. In
short, each of us already has our own code of conduct, and if we don't
like someone else's code of conduct or if someone else violates the
principles of our own, we can individually do whatever we individually
feel is appropriate. Accordingly, I line up with blueinthecommonwealth
against an enunciated common code of conduct because I don't see any
added value to having one that outweighs the losses.

Because there are no rules for anonymous bloggers, why bother
spinning wheels on a code of conduct? It's a silly gesture.

Obviously, these anons don't want to leave tread marks, but love to
hit and run. That's what make blogging interesting and different than
it's printed media counterpart.

I agree with Barnie, the blue boy and JAB, it's a matter of free
speech. Let that sleeping dog lay...

Will, I think this is excellent. Upon first review, I couldn't think
of anything to add, change or delete, although I reserve the right to
change my mind as others comment.

A couple of interesting points emerge from this thread so far. First,
I think it's a distraction to frame the debate over a blogger code of
conduct as a "First Amendment" issue. Government has nothing to do with
this. Any code of conduct would be entirely voluntary. There would be no
government oversight of any kind; indeed, I would join with Barnie and
others in totally rejecting any government role in setting standards for
the blogosphere. Similarly, this effort has nothing to do with "free
speech." No one's freedom of speech would be curtailed in any way
through the voluntary adoption of standards.

Second, this code of conduct may not be appropriate for everyone.
Clearly, there are many kinds of blogs, and political blogs are only one
small sub-set. Even within that subset, many people publish blogs purely
as a form of self expression. They are not concerned about building
credibility, enlarging their audience and influencing the political
process. They have no need for a code of conduct.

Then there are blogs published anonymously or pseudonymously.
Clearly, these blogs have a significant contribution to make. They
provide a forum for informed insiders to share information and insights
they could not share publicly. Insofar as they aspire to building
credibility, they might consider adopting codes of conduct that embrace
all of Will's tenets except for No. 1.

But I keep coming back to the issue of credibility. If bloggers want
to win the kind of readership enjoyed by the MSM, we need to adopt
standards and codes of conduct analogous to those of the MSM -- as much
to guide our own behavior as to reassure readers with boilerplate
they'll never read.

Jaded JD raises a critical issue for anyone promoting a code. How can
it be enforced? It can't be -- not in the sense that the government or
even a professional board would step in. It can only be "enforced" by
the social pressure of peer bloggers and the marketplace. People stop
commenting in, and linking to, blogs that violate the standards -- they
are "ostracized" to use Jaded JD's word. Bad bloggers will find
themselves shunned, lonely and ignored.

That's essentially the argument that Shaun Kenney and Sheila Riley
were making to me at the blogger conference: Trust the marketplace.
Readers will gravitate to the blogs with credibility and ignore those
without.

I agree totally. At the end of the day, maybe this exercise is just
about getting people to think about their own personal codes of conduct.
To the extent that we as individual bloggers behave responsibly and with
integrity, we can collectively elevate the blogosphere.

I'll chime in with the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mantra.

This is one of the things we really didn't address at the summit. Is
it worth addressing the question what precisely - if anything - is wrong
with the blogosphere today, and what will a code of ethics do to prevent
unethical bloggers from doing that the current free-market system isn't
doing today?

The best way to beat bad speech is with good speech, no imposed or
self-imposed censorship.

I appreciate the thoughtful comments here. I drafted a code without
even researching existing models, as Steve Minor of SW Virginia Law Blog
did:

http://swvalaw.blogspot.com/2005/08/on-code-of-ethics-for-bloggers.html

One reason I drafted a code is my personal difficulty with debating
in the abstract. I'd rather have something tangible in front of me to
reference. I like to know just what I'm really endorsing or rejecting.

Blue, nothing is "broke." The Virginia blogosphere is doing just fine
without a code, but to address Shaun Kenney, occasionally there are
charges and counter-counter charges about content that might be easier
resolved if there was a code, or there are examples of "disrespect" for
blogs that might not have as much credibility if there was a code. It's
not a crisis or even a big problem. I think Jim Bacon puts the role of a
voluntary code best--it might give the bloggers who want/need it more
credibility.

I'm a pretty strong supporter of the First Amendment also. This code
is only tangentially related. The First Amendment gets knocked around a
lot these days and I don't think it's as much of a "given" as some of us
think. I'd like those who reject a code to consider instead putting a
"Free Speech Zone" or "Proud Supporter of the First Amendment" button on
their blogs if they don't accept a code.

I see a basic incompatibility between being an absolutist on free
speech and simultaneously criticizing anonymous posters or commenters.

We're adopting this on our site, in it's current form. If Will

To listen to Jaded JD talk against blogging ethics, while he smacked

I think a modular, pick and choose, type of code would be
particularly useful. The creative commons does a great job of providing
a pick and choose format for copyright. I think a code of ethics could
be modeled after that pretty well. Perhaps the most stringent version
would not allow anonymous blogging etc. While the least stringent
version could just say "I won't steal."

Maybe?

To NLS, I offer this rejoinder: my comments on this thread were
directed towards an enunciated code of conduct subscribed to, and in
some way enforced upon its subscribers. In fact, my #6 above is entirely
consistent with my behavior regarding your blog: "If A doesn't like the
way B runs his blog, A can do whatever he wants to do in response
(hopefully within the realm of good taste). . . ." If you're saying
removing a blogger with whom one disagrees, whether on policy or
etiquette, from one's blogroll is distasteful, how is that different
from failing to add a blogger to begin with? And once you turn down that
road, you're almost obliging every blog to blogroll every other blog, or
else the exclusion is to be taken as an insult.

My rules for inclusion on my blogroll were published here --which Mr.
Vehrs once called "run[ning] a pretty tight ship." I explained the
reason for removing your blog from my blogroll here , because I reckon
anyone whom I delist should know why I've delisted him. As at least a
couple people who read this site know, I don't enjoy turning private
disagreements public--especially not on other people's blogs--but I'll
be happy to discuss this with you further off-line in email.

Good effort, Will, and it was a pleasure meeting you this weekend. A
couple of errant comments, though:

1. I'm not sure anybody's saying "it's broke," or asserting that this
will "fix" it. We're certainly not talking about "censorship" (no state
action) but rather, standards. Many are ones that we all apply, one way
or another, currently.

2. The issue of anonymity: What I think this is attempting to do is
differentiate/discriminate between respectable and disreputable
commentary. There's plenty in the blogosphere --- too much, really ---
that is scurrilous. There is plenty more where craven carpers attack in
anonymity those who attach there own name to their commentary, quite
often slandering them in the process. I would suggest that we at least
debate an ethic of transparency, which I would propose to be a matter of
honor, which would per se render such anonymous commentary disreputable.

3. I would add to number six a provision for removing BS commercial
spams, like the sort I had to endure on my post about the summit.

4. Barnie, good to meet you, too, on Saturday. I suspect our partisan
differences to the contrary notwithstanding, we could enjoy a couple of
beers together. That having been said, I don't think we're talking about
the First Amendment, because it's not an issue of government regulation,
but rather, an issue of both demanding and voluntarily fostering a
spirit of respectability, particularly since most of Will's suggestions
are, among this crowd, "Damn rights" describing their behavior already.
I think JD's comments recognize this point.

5. Steve/Blue Dog -- I don't think it's a silly gesture, for many of
the reasons cited by JD. There is an on-line community, and we are
setting standards, even if we don't recognize that we are doing so. I
would submit that we do so deliberatively, lest we dislike what arises
naturally.

I would also associate myself with Jim 6:22's comments.

We're faced with irony at its finest. On one hand, identity-branded
media squabbles for dwindling markets in a contest of mediocrity. On the
other hand, there's a squabble over identity branding by users of the
best hope for diversity; a bright and shining hope made possible by
pseudonymous posting.

In a rare display, I'll admit some non-Virginians contributed; but
there have been anonymous posters before. They shaped the debate, and in
doing so they shaped the world as we know it: Centinel, Brutus, Cato,
John DeWitt, Montezuma , and others argued one side; the group posting
as Publius , one-third Virginian, stood for the other.

Without the liberty to debate under the shield of pseudonymity, there
would be no protection of press, no recognition of free speech rights.
Anonymity conceived our First Amendment; shame on those who mistrust it.

Whether fear of identity theft, reprisal by an employer, multiple
authors, security from extremists enraged over moral issues, retaliation
against a business, realistic expectations of bias, or sensitivity to
publicity; there may be more reasons, and more compelling reasons, for a
blogger to obscure identity than to reveal it.

We live in a nation (counting the Patriot Act!) of unparalleled
freedom rising from our Constitution; which was written and published,
then publicly debated by pseudonymous postings. Deficiencies exposed by
these unnamed writers led to a consensus for modifications, one of them
the first time in history to give these rights Constitutional
protection:

" 16. That the People have a right to Freedom of speech, and of
writing and publishing their Sentiments; that the Freedom of the Press
is one of the great Bulwarks of Liberty, and ought not to be violated "

Subpartre, that was a stirring defense of anonymous bloggers and
commenters and I thank you for it.

I want to make clear my position: anonymous bloggers are ok in my
book,and maybe more than ok when they blog anonymously to tell the truth
because if they revealed themselves, they would be cut off from viewing
the truth. All my code of conduct would ask is that an anonymous blogger
say this: "I blog anonymously because I face possible reprisal for the
opinions I express."

As for anonymous commenters, all I have ever asked is that they pick
some identity and at least stick with that identity through each
individual thread. Where are the great anonymous names like Brutus,
DeWitt, or Montezuma? I'd settle for "123" so I wouldn't have to type
"Anonymous 8:51." But, even if they do just use "Anonymous," I'm to
complain about their lack of a name.

Note the quality of this thread--not a single "Anonymous," but plenty
of anonymous names: Laszlo, JadedJD, Ross, and you, Subpartre.

Perhaps my comment is misunderstood, or perhaps I didn't qualify it
appropriately: I do not condemn all pseudo/ano-nymous bloggery, some of
which can be and is justified for the reasons cited, especially Will's.
Rather, I condemn that substrata which engages in
scurrilous/personal/libelous attacks.

And shame on those who confuse condemnation of such attacks with
"mistrust" of the First Amendment. I'd be willing to wager that my First
Amendment credentials -- in light of my professional activities -- are
at least equal to any of those posting here.

But there's the rub, isn't it? Subpatre at least suggests my
"mistrust" of the First Amendment. My record on it is public, and
therefore, easily ascertainable. His or hers is ... what? We cannot
know, whether it is because of "fear of identity theft, reprisal by an
employer, multiple authors, security from extremists enraged over moral
issues, retaliation against a business, realistic expectations of bias,
or sensitivity to publicity," we do not know. For all we know, it could
just be fear of being called to political account for inconsistency by
those subpatre chooses to label "extremists enraged over moral issues,"
a fairly disparaging and loaded term in itself.

Moreover, what subpatre references are not "First Amendment" issues,
unless the employer in question is the government. The First Amendment
only offers protection against state action, not private response, and
the fears cited and/or held by subpatre (or anyone else, for that
matter) are the consequences -- I would posit -- that honorable men
should be willing to face/accept/fight when they choose to offer
opinions in the public square. The fear of such consequences -- short of
the threat of physical harm, which is, of course, a crime -- should give
them pause in expressing those opinions.

There are many who rightly or wrongly decry the lack of civility in
current American politics. The blogosphere promotes such incivility writ
large. The standard I suggest is no more complicated than this: if
you're not willing to put your name on it, perhaps you shouldn't be
saying it.

And Barnie, while I would agree with your last comment to a degree,
wouldn't you also agree that some ideas/comments are appropriately
judged by the quality/reputation/character/history of the men and/or
women who espouse and advocate them?

McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission , and its dissent documents the
honorable tradition of anonymous speech through American history.

" The practice of publishing one's thoughts anonymously or under
pseudonym was so widespread that only two major Federalist or
Anti-Federalist pieces appear to have been signed by their true
authors... " - Thomas, concurring

In a bizarre inversion on integrity, Mr. Young excludes many of the
nation's Founders from the ranks of " honorable men....willing
to....offer opinions in the public square ":

Pacificus (Alexander Hamilton), Helvidius (James Madison), Publius
(John Jay, Hamilton, and Madison jointly), Agrippa (James Winthrop), A
Federal Farmer (Richard Henry Lee), Candidus (Samuel Adams), Cato (Gov.
George Clinton), Cincinnatus (Arthur Lee), A Citizen of America (Noah
Webster), A Landholder (Oliver Ellsworth) are just a few of these.

Debating issues is always acceptable. Suggesting these men lack
integrity or honor is so mind-boggling, so outrageous, it negates any
point the author intended. But I digress.

The crux of the issue -as claimed by Mr. Young-is the reputation,
character, or quality of the person blogging. On the one hand is this
pseudonymous poster with no discernable education, position, reputation,
maturity, or character; on the other is someone willing to wager [his]
First Amendment credentials , while simultaneously insulting those who
created that Amendment. What's the value of credentials so easily
gambled away?

Legal issues are no different between named and anonymous bloggers.
There's little difference in liability or consequences; either type of
blogger can accept praise or admit mistakes . Either type can 'stand
behind' their posts -whatever that means-as is done here with abundant
hyperlinks.

So why was our Constitution debated under pseudonyms? Despite his
allegation, the debaters did have all those fine qualities Mr. Young
claims are crucial, yet they deliberately concealed them.

The Framers used anonymity because they possessed qualities Mr.
Young's so impressed by; the same reason the presidential title " Mr.
President " was chosen instead of Adams' proposal " His Highness, the
President of the United States of America, and Protector of their
Liberties "

Far beyond lip service, our Founders really held some truths to be
self-evident , believing that all men are created equal. They
deliberately put themselves (down) on a level playing-field with all
citizens. They trusted that their article's content would stand on its
own merits; without the crutch of reputation or character. They were
right.

Rote memorization doesn't guarantee expertise. Mr. Young not only
misunderstands our Constitution, he has its principles utterly
backwards.

Subpatre asserts that "Mr. Young not only misunderstands our
Constitution, he has its principles utterly backwards."

Well, here's one of those pesky credentials: I, alone among those
commenting (I suspect), actually have a Firat Amendment victory before
the Supreme Court under my belt (Prescott v. County of El Dorado
(2000)). Didn't get to argue the case; Supremes granted cert., vacated,
and remanded the Ninth Circuit decision. Subpatre, on the other hand,
offers his obviously encyclopedic knowledge of the American founding
(superior to my own, I must confess), coupled with an unfortunate
misapprehension about the extremely narrow type of speech that I was
criticizing (which, I assume, is still an activity protected by the
First Amendment).

Here's the problem with subpatre's construction: I didn't "Suggest[]
these men lack integrity or honor"; i.e., that all anonymous speech is
pe se dishonorable. What I said (and I'll say it again, since subpatre
apparently didn't get it the first time) was "I do not condemn all
pseudo/ano-nymous bloggery, some of which can be and is justified for
the reasons cited, especially Will's. Rather, I condemn that substrata
which engages in scurrilous/personal/libelous attacks." Thus, I neither
"insult" these men nor make any "allegation" against them; my comment
was not directed at their activities, which subpatre would or should
agree did not involve "scurrilous/personal/libelous attacks."

Here's a for instance: the English authors of an ostensibly academic
book on American conservatism write about a "bizarre ritual" occurring
at a meeting of the Third Generation meeting at the Heritage Foundation
days after Bush 41's defeat in 1992. I suppose that one could just
dismiss it as unlikely, but as one who happens to have been there, in
the front row, my authority to suggest that the authors' description
bore almost no relation to reality enriches the context of my comment.
That context is virtually nonexistent absent confirmable facts provided
by not remaining anonymous.

Furthermore, while subpatre offers an idealistic, almost pollyannish
explanation for the Founders anonymity, the point that virtually every
one of the men cited by subpatre was engaged in the Founding of a
nation, as distinct from engaging in commentary in an established
Republic which protects speech against government infringements seems so
substantial and so obvious that I hesitate to make it, but there it is.

We have no disagreement about the constitutional protection for and
the value of anonymous speech. And perhaps, had subpatre been stung by
the type of activity that was actually the subject of my post, he would
recognize the distinction that I was making.

After 100 words on the importance of credentials, a cursory look
shows -at very best- a distant, feeble relationship to free speech. It
has squat to do with anonymous publishing, and even less (if possible)
with blogging ethics.

There is recent case on anonymous publishing, the argument centered
on the First Amendment. More important is the analysis and background on
the Founders use and beliefs about anonymity, and the ethics involved.

Of concern is that a credentialed expert appears A) ignorant of this
relevant First Amendment case, B) knows little if anything of the
reasoning for the Amendment, and C) fails to even glance over the
references provided. The post illustrates that knowledge -truth,
information, facts- and the credentials are unconnected. Content is what
matters.

Which comes full circle: our Founders believed posting anonymously
leveled the playing field. Anonymity eliminates the fallacy of argument
from respect , removes incentive to puffery and conceit, and encourages
clear reason.

Justice Thomas' concurrence ,

" ....anonymous speech has an expressive value both to the speaker
and to society that outweighs public interest in disclosure "

Subpatre, ignoring the narrow topic upon which I focus -- "that
substrata which engages in scurrilous/personal/libelous attacks" -- is
doubtless useful to you, but doesn't strengthen your attack, which is
likewise weakened by your failure to acknowledge my comment that "We
have no disagreement about the constitutional protection for and the
value of anonymous speech."

Yes, I am guilty of all of which you accuse me, because I am not
about to research irrelevancies that I don't dispute, because they don't
address the topic at hand. I don't research authorities on the
Thirteenth Amendment when I am litigating a First Amendment case,
either. Call me provincial.

You persist in neglecting to explain why
"scurrilous/personal/libelous attacks" have anything to do with "the
fallacy of argument from respect," or "the incentive to puffery and
conceit," or "clear reason."

Or why it is "clear reason" to throw around words like "ignorance."

"4. I will avoid personal attacks or unfair characterizations of the
subjects of my published works and the readers who offer comments."

The code should instead read as follows: I will intentionally refer
to certain types of personal behavior when attacking persons I
disrespect. If the subject of the attack has a gambling or anger
management problem I will refer to it frequently.

Jonatha, I thought the idea here was to change for the better, not
institutionalize what already happens too frequently. ;-) <
