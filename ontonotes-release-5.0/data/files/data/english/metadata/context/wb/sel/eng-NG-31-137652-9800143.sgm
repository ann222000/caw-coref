appointed to a two two-year terms on President Bush's Foreign Intelligence
Advisory Board …
Established by Eisenhower in 1956, the PFIAB was formed &quot;as a nonpartisan

and how is information from the board being utilized by its membership?

U.S. policy to prop up Baghdad, not so much Irbil.
What's interesting about this deal is the fact that Mr. Hunt, thanks to his
policy position, is presumably as well-informed about the actual state of
affairs in Iraq as anyone in the business world can be. By putting his money
into a deal with the Kurds, despite Baghdad's disapproval, he's essentially
betting that the Iraqi government - which hasn't met a single one of the
major benchmarks Mr. Bush laid out in January - won't get its act together.
Indeed, he's effectively betting against the survival of Iraq as a nation in
any meaningful sense of the term.&quot;

COMMENT:  Essentially we have destroyed Iraq in the process of trying to rip
off all its oil...

Iraq War, Oil and Greenspan's
Gospel&lt; http://iraqoilreport.com/2007/09/18/iraq-war-oil-and-greenspan%e2%80%... &gt;
Published at
September 18, 2007  in News Feed&lt; http://iraqoilreport.com/category/news-feed/ &gt;.

The U.S. media blew up, and the Bush administration responded, when the 20
words from former Fed. Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan's new book called out
the oil motive for the Iraq war.

Greenspan utilized his 15 minutes on the book circuit to explain what he
meant to say, an apparent attempt to take the heat off of Pres. Bush.

With the word of war with Iran (no. 2 in both oil and gas reserves) heating
up, Greenspan's explanation is all the more vivid: those who depend on oil
will protect the supply.

For more, read my piece today for
UPI.&lt; http://www.upi.com/International_Security/Energy/Analysis/2007/09/18/... &gt;

&quot;He is wrong. Oil was not and is not a motivation for our actions in Iraq,&quot;
the U.S. State Department's coordinator for Iraq, David Satterfield, said
after a speech at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies the same
day.

&quot;I'm not saying that they believed it was about oil. I'm saying it is about
oil and that I believe it was necessary to get Saddam out of there,&quot;
Greenspan said.

In other words, he's not saying the Iraq war was launched because of Iraq's
oil, but Iraq's oil was a reason — along with now discredited allegations
Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and links to al-Qaida — to launch the
Iraq war.

&quot;When we went into Iraq, I said it's all about getting rid of Saddam
Hussein,&quot; said Robert Ebel, senior adviser in the Energy Program at CSIS.
&quot;Once we got rid of Saddam Hussein, then the day after it would be about
oil.&quot;

More on Iraq Oil

Bush/Patraeus/Crocker kept repeating last week the fact that the oil
pipeline from Kirkuk to Turkey was reopened after spending most of the war
years under attack and out of commission, a small sign of progress. A bomb
blast Tuesday morning corrected
that.&lt; http://www.upi.com/International_Security/Energy/Briefing/2007/09/18/... &gt;

Total and Chevron announced earlier this year they've joined forces to bid
for Iraq's oil development. Hassan Hafidh of Dow Jones Newswires reports the
duo has now pitched a development study to the Iraq Oil Ministry on the huge
Majnoon field, &lt; http://rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=50326 &gt; though the
Ministry says it will not give them preferential treatment in bidding.

Shipments of preferred price oil are heading to Jordan
now.&lt; http://www.upi.com/International_Security/Energy/Briefing/2007/09/18/... &gt;

Fending off attacks on the oil pipelines and power infrastructure around
Baghdad requires Russian helicopters on shoot-to-kill
orders.&lt; http://www.azzaman.com/english/index.asp?fname=news%5C2007-09-14%5Cku... &gt;

The fuel shortage is now threatening southern Iraq's once vibrant fishing
industry.&lt; http://www.upi.com/International_Security/Energy/Briefing/2007/09/17/... &gt;
The Hunt for Hunt Oil

As I warned when Texas-based Hunt Oil first signed a production contract
with the Kurdistan Regional Government, the Bush-connected CEO would be in
the cross-hairs.

Meanwhile, in Basra …

Sam Dagher writes an excellent three-part series for the Christian Science
Monitor on the threats to safety, security and freedom in Basra. Most of
Iraq's oil is in or around Basra, and nearly all its oil exports head to the
international market through there. Basra is arguably Iraq's most important
city.

Part 1: Basra Oil Fuels Fight to Control Iraq's Economic
Might&lt; http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0919/p12s01-wome.html &gt;

An exasperated senior official, who did not want to be identified for fear
of retribution, describes the onslaught by parties and militias intent on
controlling the company by forcing their loyalists into key management
positions. Some are beholden to the Ministry of Oil in Baghdad, which is
controlled by the United Iraqi Alliance (UIA), the dominant Shiite coalition
to which Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki belongs.

&quot;There is an invasion by parties and militias … we are a mouthwatering
prize,&quot; he says, adding that recently 8,000 people, most of them illiterate,
were pushed on to the company's payrolls.

Part 2: In The 'Venice of the East,' A History Of
Diversity&lt; http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0918/p11s02-wome.html &gt;

The city's cosmopolitan flair is evident in its people, cuisine, dance, and
the music that once echoed on its streets.

The city was once full of different religious groups: Shiites, Sunnis,
Christians of all sects, ancient communities like the Sabean Mandaeans,
Armenians, and Jews. But most, other than the Shiites, have left.

Part 3: 'Shiite Taliban' Rises As British Depart
Basra&lt; http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0918/p11s01-wome.html &gt;

The billboard in Umm al-Broom Square was meant to advertise a cellphone
service. Instead, it has become a message to those who dare to resist the
rising tide of fundamentalist Islam in Iraq's second largest city.

The female model's face is now covered with black paint. Graffiti scrawled
below reads, &quot;No! No to unveiled women.&quot;

Politics and Security

My UPI colleague Shaun Waterman
reports&lt; http://www.upi.com/International_Security/Emerging_Threats/Briefing/2... &gt;that
Iraq's government may want the Blackwater security forces out of Iraq,
but they may not get it.

Iraqi Interior Ministry officials told reporters in Baghdad Monday they
would revoke the company's license and initiate criminal proceedings after
Blackwater contractors providing security for U.S. diplomats allegedly
opened fire from aircraft into a Baghdad street — killing 11 people,
according to some reports.

The problem is, Blackwater does not have or need a license, and its
employees are not subject to Iraqi criminal jurisdiction.

Abu Risha wasn't a leader in Anbar at all.

A note about Monday's post: there wasn't one. Technology glitch. But today's
