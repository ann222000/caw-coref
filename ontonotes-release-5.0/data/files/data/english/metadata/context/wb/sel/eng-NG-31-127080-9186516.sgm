When I was a teenager I had six pack abs without really trying.  I have
been lacks with the exercise due to various aches and pains or perhaps
plain laziness (Maybe more than perhaps). ;)

While six pack abs might be a worthy goal there are limits on how much
they would do for insulin resistance.  Even liposuction does not reduce
insulin resistance a lot.  Reducing the visceral fat below the muscles
and around organs is more significant for reducing insulin resistance.

Ab Workout: More Is Not Better

&quot;You're not going to reduce fat content without either a whole heck of a
lot of abdominal work -- which is unnecessary and a waste of time -- or
some kind of aerobic activity,&quot; says Richard Cotton, exercise
physiologist and spokesman for the American Council on Exercise (ACE).

Abdominal muscles consist of three layers. The very deepest layer is the
transversus abdominis, which acts as the body's girdle, providing
support and stability and plays a critical role in exhalation. Next is
the rectus abdominis, which flexes the spine. Closest to the surface are
the internal and external obliques, which turn the trunk and provide the
body with rotation and lateral movement.

Exercise physiologist and certified diabetes expert Rich Weil recommends
training the abdominals much the way you would any other part of the body.

&quot;Abdominal muscles are no different than any other muscle group. They
should respond the same way.&quot; Hence, if you wouldn't do 50 bicep curls,
you don't need to do 50 abdominal crunches, he says. Just work smarter
by slowing down to try to isolate the muscles you're working.

Striving for Six-Pack Abs
Flat stomach, tight abs -- we all dream about it. Here's how to get
them, with step-by-step instructions and photographs.

&quot;Face it guys.  If you're over 23, you're not going to
have a washboard stomach.  So just go buy a bigger shirt.&quot;

This happens when we eat less, down to the optimal amount.  The glory
is GOD's :-)

Be hungry... be healthy... be hungrier... be blessed:

Correct.

Losing the harmful VAT and thereby removing the source of toxins
(proinflammatory adipocytokines) that cause muscle atrophy does result
in restoration of normal healthy musculature.

This is further proof that the 2PD-OMER Approach is not a diet.

Still praying for you:

A bunch of hooey. Isolate what? Put your hand on your stomach when relaxed.
Now do anything. Note the abs tense.
