All,

It saddens me to learn (likely due to my belated &quot;get a clue&quot; process)
that ABC, which just covered Richmond and has the remaining races under
TV contract, is actually the same as ESPN, and will follow the same
inept, out-of-touch broadcast format.  Yikes!  And here I thought we TV
viewers would get a break for the rest of the season.

Others with far more knowledge &amp; insight have roundly condemned ESPN's
coverage.  I just know that watching the races is not as fun, compelling
and informative as it used to be.

A question for this group:  what sort of work-arounds do folks use to
get their fix?  Other than attending an actual race, of course ... &lt;g&gt;

I'm kinda old-school (no satellite radio or TV) but I'd love to know
what others are using.

Thanks,
AL

Of course, it's partly because my lady doesn't want the race on,

Live Leaderboard:)

Who was it that used to post running order as a ladder at left of
screen? Much better than the scrolling order at top of screen.

ESPN.  Fox started the scroll at the top, and we all bitched mightily
when it showed up.

I am of two minds about the scroll.  On the one hand, it allows
showing other interesting info, like the gap from the leader (and,
of course, useless info like the point standings &quot;as they run&quot;).

On the other hand, it takes a long long time to get thru, and
they frequently remove it when they go to a replay, pit report,
or cut-away car, which means if you want to see whether your guy
is in 28th or 32nd, you might have to wait 10 or 15 minutes
before they leave it up long enough to get back into the field.

It depends on why it wasn't captured.  If we're watching a battle
for 15th, and the leader blows a tire and hits the wall, and we
didn't see it live, then yeah, that's no fault of the director.

If we're watching Harvick battling Robby Gordon, and the director
switches to a shot of the leader running all by himself, and we
miss Harvick, etc, spinning, then we justly say the director sucks.
You, me, and everyone else in the NASCAR world know there's likely
to be action between certain drivers; and you, me, and everyone
else knows a shot of a car running by itself is just filler.

Again, I'll use football as the standard.  If we don't see the
blocked punt live because the shot switched to the return man
too soon, well that's unfortunate.  If we don't see the 50 yard
reception because the camera was focused on the running back,
then we'd call the director an idiot.  But that never happens.

Bob already pointed out the huge difference: football
and basketball take place is very small arenas compared
to the acreage of even the smallest race track.

Beyond that, those sports lack the technical dimension
of NASCAR that generates so many rules and so much
controversy.  I doubt that you get much discussion in
a season of sneaker or uniform technology.  They
don't cover guys on the bench or timeouts the way
that they cover pit stops.

In other words, football and basketball get that
because they are smaller, simpler sports.

We shouldn't, but I don't think we are settling for less.  I'm curious
to know who among the current crop of announcers you think fails to
measure up here.  I'm not talkiing about who you just find irritating
to listen to.  Someone may not like the &quot;boogity, boogity, boogity&quot;,
but no thinking person would say that Darrell Waltrip doesn't know
what he's talking about.  Ditto for Rusty Wallace, Larry McReynolds,
Andy Petree, Jeff Hammond and Tim Brewer.  Mike Joy certainly knows
the sport as does Jerry Punch.

I'll grant that guys like Brent Musburger and Chris Myers might not
have as solid a background in racing as some of the other guys, but I
can't think of a single major player in the NA$CAr announcing game who
doesn't know what he's talking about or can't communicate clearly.

Maybe I'm just not as technically advanced as you are, but I have yet
to watch a race and feel like my intelligence has been insulted.  The
cutaway car segments are interesting to me and I can at least kinda
understand what's happening under the skin even though my knowledge of
race car mechanics would fit on the head of a pin.  The only thing I'd
classify as &quot;gadgetry&quot; is that thing that supposedly shows the clean
and dirty air.

I would note that racing is much more technically complex than any of
the stick and ball sports.  The announcers *have* to break it down
into relatively simple terms.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The crawl across the top of the screen giving the running order is no
more intrusive than the graphic at the top of the football telecasts
that shows the score, the clock and when there's a flag on the play.
The graphic showing the order off pit road is temporary and really
doesn't intrude on any action since they're still under caution.

Football and basketball are played in a relatively compact space and
there's one primary point of focus--the ball.  Follow the ball and
you'll pretty much get everything that's essential to the game.

In racing there could be significant action taking place at the same
time literally a mile or more apart--and you never know when or where
something will happen.  Again, the nature of the sport puts the TV
crew in a no-win situation.  If you stay focused on the leaders, you
get criticized for ignoring the guys who may be putting on a good
show, but they're racing for 15th.  If you try to show some of the
other action, you get criticized for &quot;jumping around&quot; and ignoring
what's important.

My original point was simply that I think there are a bunch of fans
who don't really understand what the TV crews are up against trying to
capture everything that goes on during a race.  It's a tough sport to
do well.  If football is done better, it's because it a lot easier to
do.

The TV broadcasts aren't perfect and never will be, but I think that
overall, they do a dang good job given just how tough their job really
is.

That is a loser gadget in my book.

&quot;A&quot; for effort (it is not an easy thing to tack the

a nearly real-time special effect (impressive) but it
does not give any new information beyond what the

The new guys also don't have the musical cue that one of the

So the quiet crawl across the top (or anywhere else they want

Especially as race-knowledgeable announcers were, I'd guess, in short
supply, lagging the NASCAR viewer explosion. I can't wait to see Bob
Costas enhance his jack-of-all-trades image by announcing a (big

When I got into NASCAR (when did Jeff win 13?), I hung on every
telecast. Over the years I've grown fussy ... or bored. Sometimes even
sitting between 4 and Finish at Loudon (Shucks ,  possible rain

Some races, to me, are much more fun to watch than others on TV.

I have a different perspective.  Despite racing's technical and
geographic complexity, there HAVE been telecasts that did a great
job.  It can be done; the problem is, it just isn't done
consistently.

I'm a man of contrary expectations;  because football and
basketball are easier to cover, I expect less from them, and I
expect the quality of the racing show to be better.  Racing IS
difficult to cover;  as with all things difficult, just go figure
out how to do it well.

I also don't buy the &quot;can't keep track of everything&quot; approach as
a reason to cover not much at all.  Figure out where the gaps are
and compensate.  If you can't cover a 2 mile track, split it into
quadrants.  If you can't cover the pits well, get more
(competent) reporters.  If one statistician can't keep up, get
two.  And pay for these by eliminating the Draft-Tracker,
superfluous hosts, excessive graphics, Hollywood Hotel, etc.

&gt; cutaway car segments are interesting to me and I can at least kinda
&gt; understand what's happening under the skin even though my knowledge of
&gt; race car mechanics would fit on the head of a pin.  The only thing I'd
&gt; classify as &quot;gadgetry&quot; is that thing that supposedly shows the clean
&gt; and dirty air.

&gt; I would note that racing is much more technically complex than any of
&gt; the stick and ball sports.  The announcers *have* to break it down
&gt; into relatively simple terms.

&gt;&gt; We deserve on-screen graphics that convey meaningful information,
&gt;&gt; not &quot;technology for the sake of technology&quot; cluttering up the screen
&gt;&gt; and getting in the way of the event.

&gt; The crawl across the top of the screen giving the running order is no
&gt; more intrusive than the graphic at the top of the football telecasts
&gt; that shows the score, the clock and when there's a flag on the play.
&gt; The graphic showing the order off pit road is temporary and really
&gt; doesn't intrude on any action since they're still under caution.

&gt;&gt; We deserve production that
&gt;&gt; knows what happens on a race, and focuses on the action, not
&gt;&gt; bouncing all over the place for meaningless shots.  Football and

&gt; Football and basketball are played in a relatively compact space and
&gt; there's one primary point of focus--the ball.  Follow the ball and
&gt; you'll pretty much get everything that's essential to the game.

&gt; In racing there could be significant action taking place at the same
&gt; time literally a mile or more apart--and you never know when or where
&gt; something will happen.  Again, the nature of the sport puts the TV
&gt; crew in a no-win situation.  If you stay focused on the leaders, you
&gt; get criticized for ignoring the guys who may be putting on a good
&gt; show, but they're racing for 15th.  If you try to show some of the
&gt; other action, you get criticized for &quot;jumping around&quot; and ignoring
&gt; what's important.

&gt; My original point was simply that I think there are a bunch of fans
&gt; who don't really understand what the TV crews are up against trying to
&gt; capture everything that goes on during a race.  It's a tough sport to
&gt; do well.  If football is done better, it's because it a lot easier to
&gt; do.

&gt; The TV broadcasts aren't perfect and never will be, but I think that

I know that I really dislike ESPN's coverage, and that it irks me in several
ways I've identified, and probably several I haven't.  Why I dislike it as
much as I do, I'm not sure, and it may be perceptual and a matter of taste.
Here's what I've figured out about why I don't like it.

1) Football promotion.  Breaking away to &quot;football update minutes&quot;, routing
(as last week) the conversation almost immediately during a red flag to
football rather than racing (no depth of knowledge there, Brad?),
continually promoting football broadcasts, the unspoken assumption that
we've turned the race on because what we really want is to *know the
football scores.*

Funny, I thought if what I really wanted was football, maybe I should go
find the Colts or Oklahoma game.  Matter of fact, that's what I do when I
want football.  And when I do, I'm not looking for the football commentators
to discuss Dale Earnhardt, Jr., either, or who's going to win the Chase.

When I turn on a race, I want to hear about racing.  Doesn't Fox, for
example, also promote other shows?  Yeah, they do, at least as much and
maybe more---this is probably one of those perceptual bits.  The types of
shows are all over the place (movies, sitcoms, what have you), and my brain
hears that as &quot;this is the stuff the network makes us promote&quot; and discards
it.  When ESPN guys do it, it seems to be 99% football, and my brain hears
often, &quot;God, this is what we'd rather be doing---as a network for sure, as
individuals maybe.  We only cover races because we gather they get an
audience, but we really can't understand WHY they get an audience.  We need
to convert you to football watchers instead.&quot;  And there's part of me that
perceives that that seems to come from the network more than from the
individual broadcasters---maybe with the exception of when Brad Daugherty
went off into football during the red flag this week.

2) The bottom of screen sports update crawl.  Once again, that seems to me
(perceptual again) to stress that ESPN doesn't consider races anything
special, and feels like races are just a time filler to them until the &quot;real
sports&quot; kick in.  **As a network**, they don't seem to really *get* anything
but &quot;classic&quot; (stick and ball, olympic) physical exertion based sports, and
racing doesn't fit that category.

Definitely in the personal and perceptual class is the aura of the
broadcasters: Fox and Speed definitely have a very laid-back aura, a &quot;we're
here to party with you and while we're at it, give you the benefit of our
expertise&quot; atmosphere.  TNT carries a good bit of that as well.  I happen to
like that sort of approach.

ESPN/ABC guys come across like they've been made to do this job wearing
underwear that's too tight, sitting on extremely uncomfortable chairs, with
the food and drink they've been denied since yesterday being just five
inches out of reach of the length of their mike cords: they range from
&quot;awfully businesslike or formal&quot; to &quot;uncomfortable being there&quot; (&quot;Is it over
yet? Can I take this mike off yet?&quot;) which may be partly an experience
issue: Rusty sounds more uncomfortable than some of the folks with a whole
lot less racing background.  Might be that nobody else sees/hears that;
might just be discomfort with their &quot;not-Fox-ness.&quot;  I dunno.

Anyhow, that's my personal analysis.

I don't buy that the smaller size of a football stadium makes
it substantially easier for an experienced broadcast crew to
handle.

Nor do I buy that stick and ball sports are so much simpler
than racing.  Explain to me the infield fly rule in baseball,
for example (I use that as an example because it happened in
last nights game, because I have no clue what it is, and
because the baseball announcers assumed that their audience
was knowledgable in their sport, and thus didn't give a
first grade explanation of it).

Currently we have 3 announcers.  The rest of them are color
commentators.  Mike Joy is exemplary, he is clear, accurate, and
excited about the sport.  Bill Weber is opaque and inaccurate, he
is (sorry Bob) as bad as Ken Squier in his latter days at calling
wrong names and describing the exact opposite of what's happening
on the track.  Dr Punch is boring and passionless, and seems to
lack knowledge of what's happening (plus he's picked up Weber's
annoying practice of launching into a soliloquy over the last 2
or 3 laps of the race).

These are the color.  Some of them are good - Larry Mac is
exceptional, when he's not playing the fool to DW.  Dallenbach
has turned into a very good color man, altho it's taken him a
long time to get comfortable with it.  DW is a fool - he may know
what he's talking about, but he spends passingly little time
actually commenting on, and expanding _our_ knowledge of the
race.  Rusty rarely seems to get a coherent thought out.  Tim
Brewer seems to be totally afraid of the camera, he clearly
knows his stuff but he has no skill at explaining it on TV
(he's not helped by the abysmal camera work he's getting - how
hard is it to point the camera at what he's talking about,
instead of the whole car?).  Kyle Petty is a natural, the 6

That's the &quot;on screen graphics&quot; I complain about in the next

pit exit pylon.  And the throttle/brake indicator that &quot;show&quot; how

speedometer graphics that obviously lag what the car is doing.

No.  You are wrong, wrong in two respects.  Stick and ball sports
are not simple, not even soccer, which has almost no rules.  Listen
to Madden explain how a football play is susposed to work, how one
man's path is susposed to take the attention of two defenders,
uncovering another receiver.  The fact that it's not mechanical
does not mean it's not technical.

And regardless of that, the announcers *do not* have to treat the
audience like simpletons.  Most of us have been watching awhile,
we have some grasp of how the sport is played.  Just like the
football audience does not need to be told the difference between
defensive holding and offensive holding every game, we don't need
the basics explained in one syllable words every race.

Something David Moody said today on Sirius suggested to me that perhaps some
of Rusty's discomfort is having to mentally edit what he says, which
apparently is normally heavily laced with non-broadcast terminology. Or to
quote David as close to verbatim as I remember, Rusty hasn't yet said &quot;look
at that f***ing car go&quot; on the air, but David thinks it's only a matter of
time..... :)

Of course another mention was of something that apparently irks a lot of
people in Rusty's vocabulary, me as well: somebody needs to put a post-it in
front of that boy reminding him that the plural of &quot;car of tomorrow&quot; isn't
&quot;car of tomorrows&quot;......

Well, in football, you've only got to cover an area about half the
size of the infield at Bristol, and it's a good bet that most of the
&quot;interesting&quot; stuff is going to happen in the area of the ball.
Outside of that, you've got a couple or three receivers who you know
are going to run &quot;thataway&quot;.  You also probably have a couple of
&quot;isolation&quot; cameras on guys that you want to watch (like a linebacker
with great lateral movement, so you can show him going hash mark to
hash mark to stuff a back trying to turn the corner).

Even so, look at how often you see somebody come flying into a frame
to make a play, because they weren't focusing on that player.

Now, double the number of players, spread 'em out over a couple of
miles, and have them run past a football field every second.  And that
player with the gimpy leg?  He got miraculously cured when he sat out
a play, and is suddenly the fastest guy on the field.  Oh, and the
kicker may, on any play, put a hit on the linebacker that knocks the
guy's jockstrap off.

OK.

If there are runners on first and second (or if the bases are
loaded), and there are less than two outs, an &quot;infield fly&quot; is called
if the batter pops the ball up in fair territory where an infielder
can easily catch it.  The batter is automatically out.  If the
infielder drops the ball, the runners can advance, but they don't have
to.

The idea behind it is to prevent an infielder from deliberately
dropping an easy pop-up, and then getting a double play (because the
runners would have to stay on their bases, since it looks like the
ball would be caught).

A good &quot;rule of thumb&quot;--if you could get a double play by letting
the ball drop instead of catching it, the infield fly rule is in
effect.

It's one of those &quot;unfair advantage&quot; rules like the ones that seem
to permeate NASCAR.

Why not?  It seems axiomatic to me that if all the action takes place
in a more compact space, it's easier to keep up with--especially if
there's just one primary point of focus, the ball..  If anything can
happen at any time at any place along a two mile stretch of pavement,
it's a lot harder to catch everything.

I've done radio play-by-play of football, basketball and racing.
Football and basketball are a LOT easier.  Even on a short track, you
just physically can't watch everything at once.  If I'm watching the
leader enter turn three and someone spins in turn one, my call of that
spin will be about five seconds after the fact and I can't tell you
what caused it.  Does that mean I stiink as an announcer?   That's the
kind of criticism I think is unfair because its rooted in a basic
misunderstanding of what the announcers and camera people face when
covering a race.

The infield fly rule says that if there are runners on first and
second or the bases are loaded (IOW, there's a force out available at
third base) and less than two outs, the batter is automatically out if
he hits a fair fly ball that could reasonably be caught by an
infielder.  The idea is to prevent the defense from getting a cheap
double play.  Assume a pop-up to the third baseman.  The runners on
first and second are holding their bags expecting the ball to be
caught.  If the batter isn't automatically out, the third baseman can
intentionally let the ball drop, pick it up, touch third for a force
out, then throw to second for a second force out.  Calling the batter
out automatically removes the force plays and there is no advantage to
the defense to intentionally drop a ball that could easily be caught.

I just finished reading Brock Yates' book last night.

It's mildly disappointing--mostly reprints of old
articles only very slightly touched up.  Poorly
edited.  And he believes that NASCAR periodically
gives some teams &quot;the call&quot; to let them know that
they can cheat without fear of reprisal--this is
just asserted, without any effort to provide
evidence other than &quot;some people say ...&quot;

Ah, but back to the point I was going to make: the
book shows that folks have been griping about
NASCAR's unpublished and oft-revised rules at
least since the 70s.  It probably isn't going
to change now.  ;o)

Today, more so than years back, I often wonder
what people do not know about NASCAR racing,
that they can easily find out?
There are so many websites, newsgroups, blogs, whatever,
that can answer anything.
The fact that they cannot actually put their hands on one,
doesn't mean that the rules are not out there.
And when something comes up on tv, they very often
refer to the rule.
If one wants to know, it's easy enough to find an answer.
You just might have to work at it 3 or 4 minutes.

driving a manual, you know that it's done by ear; you become
sensitive to things that &quot;aren't right&quot; like that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I wasn't suggesting getting rid of it.  I was suggesting that it
should be accurate and meaningful.

That is why I say we deserve a skilled, knowledgable production

Why are you watching the leader?  Is second place challenging him?
Is he about due to pit?  Or is he just clicking off laps 5 seconds

Let's go back to the football analogies.  Suspose there's a punt.
Camera 1 focuses on the punter taking the snap, and kicking the ball.
Camera 2 focuses on the return man, watching the ball come down
right to his hands.  Then the director switches back to camera 1,
and we see the punter standing there with his hands on his hips.
Then we switch back to camera 2, and see the return man on the
ground, and the announcer tells us we'll have the runback on replay
in just a moment.

Will you ever see that in a football game?  Of course not, the
production team is knowledgable enough about their sport to keep
the focus on the important action.  I expect the same level of
knowledge and attention in a Cup broadcast crew.

Hmm, I don't remember it like that.  But it's been a couple of years

&gt;&gt;Nor do I buy that stick and ball sports are so much simpler

&gt; The fellow who hits a high fly ball into the

Which is my point (one of what's probably excessively many).
The baseball announcers assume that their audience is pretty
knowledgable about their game, they don't have to explain
everything in newbie terms.  And you know, even tho I don't
know that stuff, I'm still entertained by the broadcast.

I want the same standard of coverage for the race broadcasts.

I imagine there is a technical reason for the delay--different
channels, different circuits, processing.  There's no need
to do anything with the sound but dump it out with the video;
meanwhile, the telemetry needs to be turned into several
graphics and pasted into the screen.

What I look for is maximum RPM, max MPH, braking.  The
stuff we're getting now gives me information I wouldn't
otherwise have.

I don't like the slider-bar graphic for where a driver
stands during qualifying.  For some reason, I just can't
&quot;read&quot; it intuitively, despite many efforts to do so.
I think I'd rather have a vertical bar.
