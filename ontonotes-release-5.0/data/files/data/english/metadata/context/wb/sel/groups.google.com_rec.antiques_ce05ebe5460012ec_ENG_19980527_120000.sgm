Ok, I've spent three hours at the Library, and found NOTHING. Please
help, someone.

My small non-profit group is having a garage sale Saturday (5/30) to
raise some sorely needed funds. Amongst the detritus donated for the
sale is a beautiful set of porcelain cups and saucers, that I don't
want to put out for too low a price.

I'm not looking to gouge anybody, or make a fortune, I'd just like to
get an idea of what a fair garage-sale price would be. (I know this
is last minute, but I was just shown them this evening, before I went
to the library.)

Detailed description:
6 matching porcelain cups and saucers. White china, with a different
bird and flower on each cup/saucer. The handles and rims are gilded.
There are two marks: one just says &quot;Limoges&quot;. The other is a mark
that is a blue shield shape with a laurel (?) wreath and a J inside
the wreath. Neither of the marks is engraved...they appear to be put
on the same way the pictures are painted. I searched all the books my
library had on marks, but there was NOTHING that matched, or even came
close.

The pieces are all in perfect condition (they look like they've never
been used). They have a &quot;different&quot; shape for &quot;tea cups&quot;, that is,
they do not taper in the body, they have the same diameter at the top
and bottom.

Also, if I should be taking these to a dealer, can anyone recommend a
good one to consult with in the Sacramento Area? If I shouldn't sell
them at a garage sale, I can take them to the dealer and do it, but
again, I'm not sure they're even worth the trouble.

Thanks for all your help.

Robin

"/> Hi, Robin -

I couldn't find anything on that particular mark, so I have no idea
how old they are; however, from your description, they sound very
nice. Each is different, so they may appeal to a collector of
teacups &amp; saucers - but there may have been a teapot or coffeepot
with them at some time (?)

To me, a fair garage sale price is $8-$9 each, or around $50 for
the set...that leaves room for negotiations. You could take them
to a dealer, but a dealer can only pay about 30-40% of what they
expect to sell them for (leaving your non-profit org less money.)

"/> Sorry, Kris, I can't agree; at $8-$9 apiece at a Sacramento garage
sale, they'll still be sitting there at the end of the day. That's
way too expensive (even with a discount) for an impulse purchase.

I too tried to look up the mark as described and found nothing.
The barrel shape described has got me wondering, though, if these
are recent pieces that at one time had a paper label. The good
condition would also suggest same. I could tell a lot more by being
able to see and hold the piece.

If the original poster thinks she has something really nice, the
best way to milk it is to have photos done and put it on eBay.
That way if someone who already has that pattern sees it, they'll
be willing to pay more for it. At a garage sale your goods get
exposed to maybe a hundred people on average.
