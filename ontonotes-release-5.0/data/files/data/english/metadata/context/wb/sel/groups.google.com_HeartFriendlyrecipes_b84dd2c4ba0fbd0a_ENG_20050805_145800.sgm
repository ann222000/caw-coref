Sometimes WW main American site does have some good esp for prepackaged
time saver foods suggestions. Access to the free section doesn't cost
you a thing and you only have to reg if you want to post. I admit that
I still prefer the Canada and UK sites but when I want quick they do
come in handy sometimes. Check them out. This is from the Food
Feature section for this month. Modified of course with Fat Free subs.

Alfresco Foods (Clarkson Potter, 2005).

Chipotle peppers add heat and smokiness, horseradish gives texture and
heat, and honey can lend the right amount of sweetness to just about
any condiment.

Add wasabi powder or wasabi paste to fat free mayonnaise for a spicy
vegetable dip or sandwich spread.

Get creative with Dijon mustard by adding a touch of honey and dill.
Throws in a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes for extra heat.

Mix together fat-free plain yogurt, shredded cucumber and garlic powder
for a simple Greek-inspired vegetable dip, turkey burger topping or
sauce for grilled chicken.

Add ketchup and mustard to bottled barbecue sauce and additions such as
smoked paprika or minced roasted garlic cloves.

Create a creamy sauce for nachos, tacos, burritos and Tex-Mex wraps by
adding fat-free sour cream to prepared salsa.

Stir fresh fruit such as minced pineapple into fat free cottage cheese
and serve with sliced apples for dipping.
also you can go savory and mix salt-free garlic and herb seasoning (and
fresh herbs, if desired) with fat free cottage cheese and spread it
into a pita filled with roasted vegetables.

Top your favorite burger with a dollop of ketchup combined with plain,
fat-free yogurt or nonfat sour cream.

Add some of the sauce (but not the actual peppers) from canned chipotle
peppers to either guacamole or ketchup for a little smoky heat. Add
chipotle sauce (tastes like tomato sauce with a hint of chipotle chili
flavor) to plain yogurt as a dressing for chicken salad. [note this may
work as a sub for sesame oil]

Serve crab cakes with a sauce of fat free mayonnaise spiked with
horseradish.
