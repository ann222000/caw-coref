Somebody has to look at the basic physics, here. They have a 300 liter
tank at 300 atmospheres of pressure going through (nearly) isothermal
expansion. Depending on what they consider the ambient temperature to
be, you get total Megajoules of energy to be in the range of 30's to
40's. Under those conditions (300 liters at 300 bar, -100C) you have an
air mass of about 173 kg. That is about .2 to .26 MJ/kg of &quot;fuel&quot; (ie.
compressed air). That is about 150 times LESS than a kilogram of
gasoline! In fact the entire compressed air tank has about the energy
storage capacity of roughly 1 kg of gasoline (about one THIRD of a
gallon of gasoline).

Just for the hell of (and to see if I can still get three when I add one and
two), I came up with an approximation for stored energy for isothermal
compression.

W = (Po*Vo/2)*(V/Vo)^2.

W is the stored energy.
Po is the initial pressure, typically one atmosphere or 15psi.
Vo is the volume of your storage tank.
V is the volume of air at Po that gets compressed into the tank.

I make no attempt to design an optimum system or consider strength of
materials except in an off-hand way. I also am mixing units.

A reasonable tank volume is 50 cubic feet. Start with air at 15psi and go to
200 atmospheres (3000)psi.

W = 2.16Gft-lbs.

No it has little to do with how much energy it took to fill the
cylinder.
It only has to do with how much is stored once it is in the cylinder or
in fact how much you can capture and use when the air gets out.
And several have demonstrated the there is not much energy available.

I wonder about the use of liquid air. More energy would
be required to liquefy air and the storage dewars would
of course be more expensive but a large number of vehicles
using liquid air with a boiling point of around -194 deg C
could lower the city center temperature and of course give
the vehicle built in air conditioning. Here we are in the

Here's a link to the company now doing tests in France:

http://www.theaircar.com/tests.html

They are presently getting 7.22Km range, which they extrapolate to 240Km
by making a *few* design changes. :-)  This is apparently the 147 miles
cited above.  The changes include reducing the weight from 1130Kg to
700Kg and at the same time increasing the volume and pressure of the
tanks.  It's an interesting read. ;-)

Compressed air is just a lousy way to carry energy, (fuel), around.

It's just hard to beat gasoline! Ethanol comes closest with about two
thirds of the energy per gallon of that in gasoline.

Three is still no free lunch!!!

Not sure why folks are using isothermal expansion.  If the air expands
rapidly through the air motor it will be more like adiabatic (no heat
transfered in/out while expanding).  The bad news is, with 1.4 for the ratio
of specific heats for air, adibatic expansion returns a lot less work.

If you used liquid air, it would be require heat to expand it. Even
compressed air would have some Joule-Thompson cooling.

Another way of thinking about it is in analogy with steam. Suppose you had a
hot tank to store compressed superheated steam. Could you store more energy
in a tank that size by filling it with water (liquified steam)?

I use 20lb liquid CO2 cylinders for a number of applications
and the high output regulators have a chamber designed to
let the liquid flash into gas. A vehicle that used liquid air
would have to have some sort of heat exchanger to do the same
thing. Perhaps a system of coils turning the roof and body
panels of the vehicle into one big heat collector. Using the
heat from the brakes and cooling the cabin could also help.
I don't see any insurmountable problems with such a car except
for the fact that the best body color may be a dark green.

Possibly that is why the &quot;chairman of the bored&quot; didn't give a link.
This has been around many times before. &quot;Excreta Taurii Cerebrum Vincit&quot;

You are an engineer facing the invincibly ignorant using pie in the sky

Flunck you, Grasswipe! It was highlighted in &quot;Popular

There's your problem- anal retention but no cerebral retention. Popular
Mechanics isn't what I consider a good source. it also highlighted a
permanent magnet motor (or was it popular Science?- same level of
science involved) that was a perpetual motion machine in disguise (to be
fair the patent office hacks also missed this).

That's the problem when you have Engineers Pride, you won't employ what
others already made....

On The Same Note - A &quot;Top Notch&quot; Construction Eng. when told to employ a
new product [ShowCased in PS or PM Magazine(Dupont®)] that would keep
leaks from damaging lower floors responded by adding a seperate drain
pipe for The Laundry Area alone...Little did he forsee the Heating
System opening up and damaging all the Living Room Ceilings in a 5 Story
Building...The Product is a Polimer Slate or Subfloor one could bore a
drain hole into a a corner, and pipe the entire structure floor to floor
proofing to the basement...

He too thought Pop. Mech. &amp; Pop. Sci. are Fictional ~ He won't be
getting any more of those contracts.....

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just for the hell of (and to see if I can still get three when I add one
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; two), I came up with an approximation for stored energy for isothermal
&gt;&gt;&gt; compression.

&gt;&gt;&gt; W = (Po*Vo/2)*(V/Vo)^2.

&gt;&gt;&gt; W is the stored energy.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Po is the initial pressure, typically one atmosphere or 15psi.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Vo is the volume of your storage tank.
&gt;&gt;&gt; V is the volume of air at Po that gets compressed into the tank.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I make no attempt to design an optimum system or consider strength of
&gt;&gt;&gt; materials except in an off-hand way. I also am mixing units.

&gt;&gt;Not sure why folks are using isothermal expansion.  If the air expands
&gt;&gt;rapidly through the air motor it will be more like adiabatic (no heat
&gt;&gt;transfered in/out while expanding).  The bad news is, with 1.4 for the
&gt;&gt;ratio
&gt;&gt;of specific heats for air, adibatic expansion returns a lot less work.

&gt;&gt;daestrom

&gt;  IDIOTS!  It has NOTHING to do with the heat, latent or otherwise.  It
&gt; is all about the WORK that can and IS performed by the release of 3000+
&gt; psi air into an &quot;air motor&quot;.  That is REAL WORK, and the fucking
&gt; temperatures involved are 100% irrelevant.

&gt; If a goddamned impact wrench can make a bolt tight, this &quot;car&quot; can get
&gt; your retarded asses down the road.
">

No you fool, the temperature has a lot to do with how *far* down the road
you will get on a tank of air.  Your impact wrench won't work very long
hooked up to a scuba tank for an air supply and *that* is the issue.

No one doubts that an air motor can be connected to a drive train and
propell a car.  The question is (and always has been) how far before you
coast to a stop at the side of the road and call AAA for a 'refill'.

Drop the attitude dimwit.  It *does* have to travel several miles on a

Exactly.  And since the expansion process is also adiabatic, any cooling of
the air while in the storage tank drops the efficiency of the storage.

If the air expansion could be done through a massive heat-exchanger while
inside the air motor, then isothermal expansion might be achievable and the
storage efficiency would be better.  But since no such air motor (an
isothermal one) exists, only adiabatic expansion is possible and the storage
efficiency thus suffers.

Propane has been used for automotive purposes for many years. Certainly  one
could and probably still can, have a propane tank and hardware put into a
car (even those using carburretors) and with a switch, change back and forth
between propane and gasolene. Gasolene is better for starting, particularly
in cold weather (and at 30-40 below may have to be used altogether unless
one has a heater for the propane tank).

However, considering his grasp  of language- do you think that the
&quot;Chairman: can handle words such as &quot;hydrocarbons&quot;? &quot;Bored&quot; is what I get
from his dull, childish and unimaginative invective.
