So what do you call that sort of literary fiction, Hog Wash or White
Wash? Â Mac Racing can't adapt? They had to make Hamilton pay for his
mistake?

Any of that swamp land left in Florida?

Lets be honest his body language after the incident told the story
that it wasn't a team thing. The story is an atempt to avoid having
one of there drivers demoted on the grid.

I missed the qualifying (and conference), but how does this statement
tie in with what was said by the drivers after the event?

Ok, lets overlook for a second, the fact that the original poster is,
quite obviously, a tool right down to the quantum level...

I don't think we would have realistically expected Ron to say anything
else really. Alonso could have got out of his car, drew a switchblade
and slashed Hamilton's tyres personally and Ron would have said it was
all part of some grand McLaren scheme. This is known is whats known in
the world of PR as 'damage limitation'.

Having said that, maybe it is all 100% true. I don't really have any
hard and fast evidence to the contrary. What I do know is that Ron's
initial reaction wasn't one that seemed to say, &quot;Whoops, my boy wonder
has made a mistake and robbed himself of a flying lap&quot;. To me, it said
something more like, &quot;My drivers are letting their personal
competitiveness get in the way of what is good for the team and
pissing on my (multi-million pound) parade&quot;. Lewis' reaction at the
press conference seemed to suggest that he didn't believe it was his
error either. Infact, when Alonso was asked about the incident, Lewis
turned to Alonso very abruptly as if to say... &quot;Yeah, I would like to
know what the fuck you were playing at too actually!&quot;.

It is very odd to me that a mistake by Hamilton would lead to a
situation where Alonso would hang around in the pit for *just* the
right amount of time so that Hamilton missed his second flying lap. It
too big of a co-incidence in my opinion. I also cannot believe that
Hamilton would just sit back and be happy to be blamed for the
incident after how completely pissed he seemed to look at the press
conference. I will be very interested to see if any further 'mistakes'
in the race tomorrow hand a slight advantage to Hamilton. Just taking
a look at the betting odds for the race tomorrow, the odds between the
two MacLaren drivers seem very close for a circuit with very very
limited overtaking potential. Perhaps some of the punters agree that
we might see a 'pit stop concession' handing the reach to Hamilton
tomorrow.

I think McLaren have managed to foster a culture where their team is
split in two. Its not 'McLaren', its 'Team Alonso' and 'Team
Hamilton'. Infact, this culture seems to predate both of these
driver's careers by at least a couple of decades. Ron plays mediator
the best he can but sometimes even he cannot stop matters from boiling
over.

I am looking forward to seeing the race unfold tomorrow.

Do we have to? Do we have to overlook it in every one of his other

I agree. It's Ron trying his best for damage limitation but the story
doesn't stack up for the reason I posted earlier. Alonso could have moved
out of the service box and waited alongside it while Hamilton got tyres and
fuel. It's inconceivable that the team would allow one driver to miss a
qualifying lap just because of some alleged foul up that took place earlier.

Good point and the failure not to take that option really stinks.
