In the new america, the post-911 world amerika this sort of over zealous
military style house busting excerise has become more common place thanks
to federal funding (under the guise of homeland security against the
terrorists). This story shows just how bad it can get and for mere
traffic tickets.

http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2004-08-05/news/dog-day-afternoon/full

&lt;...&gt;

It was shortly after noon on July 23 and several men dressed in black
jeans and green shirts were getting out of an unmarked white Suburban,
casually putting on flak jackets and helmets.

Soon the men were lingering in front of his neighbor's house in the
upscale gated subdivision of quarter-million-dollar homes.

Delfino never would have guessed that he was witnessing the final
preparations by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office SWAT team moments
before it unleashed a barrage of tear gas grenades into his neighbor's
home.

&lt;...&gt;

But soon he knew that what he first thought was a gag must be about
something deadly serious.

&quot;I saw one of the guys was perched and aiming a gun at the window,&quot; he
says. &quot;All of a sudden, he fires off a tear gas round into the upstairs
window.

&quot;I immediately called 911. I didn't know what was going on.&quot;

&lt;...&gt;

After a few minutes on the phone with a 911 operator, Delfino says, he
was told that the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office was serving a search
warrant on the house and &quot;not to worry.&quot;

&lt;...&gt;

Moments later, the situation deteriorated even further when the house
erupted into flames. Now, the entire neighborhood of closely packed homes
was threatened by the possibility of fire.

&lt;...&gt;

. Just after the tear gas canisters were shot, a fire erupted and
destroyed a $250,000 home plus all the contents inside. (The home's
occupants believe the tear gas canisters caused the fire. Phoenix fire
officials say the blaze was probably started by a lighted candle that was
knocked onto a bed during the confusion.)

. The armored personnel carrier careened down the street and smashed into
a parked car after its brakes failed.

. And in the ultimate display of cruelty, a SWAT team member drove a dog
trying to flee the home back into the inferno, where it met an agonizing
death.

Deputies then reportedly laughed as the dog's owners came unglued as it
perished in the blaze.

&quot;I was crying hysterically,&quot; Andrea Barker, one of the dog's owners,
tells me. &quot;I was so upset. They [deputies] were laughing at me.&quot;

&lt;...&gt;

MCSO stormed the house believing there was a cache of stolen automatic
weapons and armor-piercing ammunition. But MCSO got bushwhacked. Instead
of finding weapons of mass destruction, they discovered an antique
shotgun and a 9 mm pistol that appear to be legal weapons.

There was no sign of the cop-killer bullets. Perhaps they are buried
somewhere out in the desert, with Saddam's plutonium.

Given the overwhelming display of force deployed by Arpaio's deputies,
one would have expected the arrest of a mass murderer.

Instead, the crack SWAT boys nabbed 26-year-old Eric Kush. Let me tell
you, Kush is really a bad, bad guy.

He was wanted on a misdemeanor warrant for failing to appear in Tempe
Municipal Court on a couple of traffic citations.

&lt;...&gt;

Arpaio's Ahwatukee assault should have drawn banner headlines in the
daily newspapers. But the Arizona Republic, where Arpaio's son-in-law,
Phil Boas, serves as deputy editor of the editorial pages, buried the
story in a community section. The East Valley Tribune ignored it entirely.

Actually there are cops that would laugh at it. I take it you haven't had
enough interaction with cops to meet some like that. Cops serve the
government and do all sorts of dishonest things day in and day out to
bring in the money for the government they work for. If they are willing to
take cash from some old guy who is affraid of banks because his father lost
everything in a bank shutdown in the 1930s they'll certainly laugh at a
dead dog.

Yeah - Joe's publicity machine is a wonder, isn't it?

In reality?  Tent City is reserved for low-level offenders and those
awaiting trial who can't afford bail.  Oh, unless you're Glen Campbell.
Then you get to bring your own mattress and guitar to &quot;jail&quot; and get
out early for playing an hour in front of a bunch of inmates.  If you or
any other regular citizen did what Campbell did (DUI, hit-and-run,
assault on a police officer IIRC) you'd get a lot worse.

The hard-core criminals are sitting in air-conditioned comfort.

You've probably heard about how he's getting tough on illegal aliens
lately, right?  He's got that hotline for people to report them - after
all, most citizens can identify illegals just by looking at them.

Well, a few years a go he threw a member of the National Guard in the
clink for about 10 days because he made a citizen's arrest on a group of
illegals at a rest stop.  The prosecutor told Joe that he didn't break
any laws and wouldn't be pressing any charges.  Joe didn't care - he
kept him in jail as long as he could.  But that was before all the
uproar by the general public about illegal immigration.

And how about that last election against Dan Saban?  Joe strikes up a
phony investigation based solely on the word of Saban's adoptive mother
who was a drunk and obviously had an axe to grind.  Of course, the
charge was well beyond the statute of limitations (it allegedly occurred
over 30 years ago) and there was not a single shred of evidence.

So why did he do all this?  So he could leak it to the press, which he
did.  Then he transferred the case to Pima County due to the obvious
conflict of interest.  Pima County promptly dropped the case as being
completely without merit and way too old.

How about Joe's endorsement of then-gubernatorial candidate Janet
Napolitano?  Oh, that's right - Joe says he didn't &quot;endorse&quot; her, he
just appeared in campaign commercials for her.  Quid pro quo for her
failure to investigate the death of a Tent City inmate as Atty General
that Sheriff Joke claimed was the result of him falling off his bunk -
the lower bunk, at that.

He's lost the support of GOP leadership and law enforcement officers.
He's losing support among Maricopa voters - each election gets tougher
for him.  They're sick of his bullshit - having his deputies ask for
fingerprints during routine traffic stops, etc....

How do you lose your job by doing what you are told to do?

Sure, a conspiracy to cover it between police and fire departments can
backfire. But if both are employed by the county government and the
county government is the one doing the cover up, then not supporting the
coverup is the riskier option.  Now if the fire department has a
separate reporting line, then that's different.

The &quot;gas&quot; is actually particulate matter distributed via smoke.

Panicked animals will run to a place they associate with safety, even
