netconfig puzzle

I have a new Slackware 9.1 installation (too many problems installing
12.0 on my old Dell Dimension 4100, but let's not get into that!).

When I configure the network with netconfig, the second step is to
give a domaine name for the machine (of the form &quot;example.org&quot;).  Do
you have to supply a REGISTERED domain name here?  I have a registered
domaine name (manhattanhandyman.com) but it currently maps to an IP
address at my web host in California.  Therefore, it assume I cannot
use it.

My IP address is assigned by ISP, using DHCP.  How is this IP address
mapped to the domain name that I assign to my machine?   How do I make
sure that the domaine name I  supply is unique on the Internet (and
does not collide with someone else's)?

I'm confused...

You can use 'localnet'.

It's not mapped to the local name, just to the network interface, the
domain names are not required for connection to the Internet, just the
IP address.  Mapping to a domain name is only a convenience.

You don't, the domain name you choose for the local machine is not seen
on the Internet, therefore there is no clash of names.

That really depends on what you want to be able to do.
You can get away with a bogus name for some purposes.
But if you want to run your own SMTP server (instead of
using your ISP's SMTP server, as per your earlier post),
then you really should have a properly registered domain
name mapped to your ISP-assigned ip#.

Right.  But note, depending on your registrar, you might be able
to create a 'third-level' name (ex: foo.manhattanhandyman.com).
Some registrars (ex: joker.com) allow you to do this at no extra
charge.  Some registrars may not be so reasonable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's too bad.  Ask your ISP
(a) how much for static ip# ?
(b) how much for reverse DNS service for that static ip# ?
If the answers are unsatisfactory, investigate switching ISP.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; How is this IP address
&gt;&gt; mapped to the domain name that I assign to my machine?
">

That's called 'reverse DNS', a DNS 'PTR record' and that is
controlled by your ISP, who owns the ip# netblock.  Some ISPs will
provide (at no add'l cost) reverse DNS to map their ip# to your
domain name, just as your registrar maps your domain name to your
ISP-assigned ip#.  This is easy if you have a static ip# but not
so easy if you have a dynamic ip# supplied by DHCP (since the ip#
may change from time to time, at the whim of the ISP ...)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If you -don't- want to run your own SMTP (or HTTP, rsync, ssh, etc)
then you might use a made-up domain in the '.lan' tld, (ex: foo.lan).
Since .lan is a bogus TLD, it is guaranteed to not be in use on
the net.  But if you want your machine to be able to be found by
it's domain name, (which is what domain names are for), then you
need a real domain name.

it can be confusing at first :*)

google a bit for 'free dns' and you'll probably learn something.

HTH.

P.S.

The thing is, that no one (with any sense) and no software
(written by someone who knows what they are doing), 'thinks' that
that's your actual domain name.

They already know what your domain really is: It's the one your
IP, given you by your ISP, translates to. Or the domain registered
to you or your business or org  that your IP translates to.

It's the one in your IP packet headers.

You are not running an SMTP server, as per the OP's original
questions.  If you want to run an SMTP server, you'll
need a legitmate domain name (A, MX, and PTR records).
And that pretty much requires a static ip#.
Having a dynamic DHCP ip# pretty much rules out running services.
If you will be using your ISP for SMTP and POP/IMAP, then no,
the domain name doesn't really matter.  Your ISP will recognize
you by the ip# they have assigned you.

As i said in previous post, it all depends on what you want to do.
One size does NOT fit all.

Not entirely.  It's pretty straightforward to run an smtp server
on a dynamic IP using a service like DynDNS and the Smarthost
function of sendmail to relay outbound mail through your ISP.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, no.  DynDNS (and others) allow this pretty handily.
