For Big Oil, Pricey Gas Means Big Profits
Lawmakers Call for Explanations After Oil Companies Announce Record
Earnings
By ERIC NOE

Oct. 27, 2005 - - While Americans were stung by historically high gas
prices this fall, the world's biggest oil companies saw their profits
skyrocket.

On Tuesday, ExxonMobil, the world's largest publicly-traded oil
company, announced net income of $9.9 billion for the most recent
quarter, eclipsing analyst expectations and dwarfing the $5.68 billion
reported for the same quarter a year ago. It was the largest quarterly
profit ever for a U.S. company.

ExxonMobil wasn't alone. Royal Dutch Shell said today that profits grew
68 percent, to $9.03 billion, last quarter. Earlier in the week, BP
announced profits at 34 percent above last year's levels, and
ConocoPhillips saw revenue jump 43 percent.

The reason? High gas prices.

&quot;The recent hurricanes in the U.S. have impacted our results. However,
underlying performance is strong, amplified by high but volatile prices
of oil, gas and products,&quot; BP Chief Executive Lord Browne said in a
statement announcing the company's performance.

Consumers Pay Up

Despite temporary interruptions to refinery and delivery operations
after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita ravaged the Gulf Coast, an
accompanying surge in crude oil prices and prices at the pump allowed
oil companies to bolster their earnings. Crude oil represents more than
50 percent of the cost of gasoline, and many oil companies were able to
capitalize when the cost of a barrel of crude climbed above $60.

&quot;What might have been lost in terms of production and refining capacity
was more than made up for by the hurricanes driving oil prices up a
couple dollars a barrel,&quot; said John Parry, an analyst with John S.
Herold.

The oil giants' windfall is a stark contrast to the ugly scenes around
U.S. gas stations in September -- hours-long lines of drivers desperate
to fill up, despite prices that often topped $3 per gallon. Some
politicians are questioning why oil companies profited so much while
consumers struggled to fill their tanks.

Even Republican lawmakers, who have historically counted on support
from the oil industry, have asked for answers.

Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist today called for Senate hearings to
examine the reasons for high energy prices. Noting the contradiction
between the soaring profits and squeezed consumer budgets, Frist
requested that executives from the country's major oil companies attend
the hearings.

"/> Bush had nothing to do with passing environmental review laws which
basically had more to do with prohibiting any new refinery from being
built over the last 30 years than reviewing plans to make sure the
environment was being protected. Thank you, liberals.

Bush had nothing to do with the EPA mandating 15 to 20 different
blends of gasoline which make it difficult for what refineries we have
to keep sufficient inventory around the country. The whole idea is
stupid anyways. For example, Illinois could be permitted to use a
cheaper, higher polluting gasoline, but the winds bring the bad air to
Indiana, which then doesn't meet EPA air standards, so Indiana would
have to use a more expensive, cleaner burning blend. Thank you,
liberals.

Dear brain-washed neo-con:

There are numerous reasons why Bush is responsible for gas prices
exceeding $3/gal:

1. After 9/11, Bush developed a plan to fill the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve (SPR), a 700 million bbl. store meant to sustain the U.S. in an
emergency. Last year only 40 million bbl. were added to the SPR. This
action alone drove up prices by adding to the demand for oil. An
independent analyst says that had Bush not acted, oil would be selling
for just $28 per bbl. instead of its current price of over $50 per bbl.
and gas would be under $1.50/gal. The government oil-buying binge has
not even increased the supply of available oil since most of the
petroleum added to the SPR was bought from private refiners, which have
not replenished their stocks because of high prices.

2. Bush's continued opposition to congressionally mandated increases in
fuel economy. Raising fuel-economy standards by just 1 mile a gallon
would cut U.S. oil consumption by 143 million barrels a year, or 16
days of imports, and save motorists $9 billion, the Environmental
Protection Agency estimates.

3. Bush's tax loophole allowing small business owners to deduct up to
$100,000 for purchasing the heaviest, least fuel-efficient SUVs. The
group &quot;Taxpayers for Common Sense&quot; estimates that the SUV tax loophole
costs government between $840 million and $987 million for every
100,000 vehicles sold.

4. How does it feel being an ignorant, brain-washed, neo-con parrot?
Wake up, nitwit.

supporters have toward him, in spite of nearly six years of
absolute catastrophe... The worst terrorist attack in U.S.
history, record budget deficits, record trade deficits, record
energy prices, decimation of the U.S. manufacturing sector,
a global reputation in shambles, steadily increasing poverty,
declining real wages, a nation absolutely polarized on most
issues, and on and on and on.

Historians will record Bush as the first U.S. president who
was re-elected not because of his performance in office, but
in spite of it, and by a relentless fear and terror campaign.

Sure:

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/200 ...

The funny part is, Collier, 3 years later, changes his mind
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/200 ...

What does Collier, a columnist, have to do with the &quot;party line&quot;? I
didn't know he was the spokesperson for the Democratic party. I guess
he's also the unnamed &quot;analyst&quot; quoted for most of the story?

http://www.worldwatch.org/press/news/2002/11/26/
&quot;But the stakes in all this maneuvering involve much more than just the

future of Iraq. The Bush energy policy is predicated on growing
consumption of oil, preferably cheap oil.&quot;

Hmmm, again, no mention of any Democrats in the story.

Congress loosened controls on the southern border. The median income of

"/> WRONG.

Crude oil is a speculative commodity. There's no shortages, but if some

&gt; enough of the Iraqi capabilities in oil products, and that they are
&gt; offering near the same amount on the global market. There are two
&gt; issues causing price increases. First, the cartels are keeping
&gt; supplies low.

"/> WRONG.

Since early 2003, OPEC Member Countries have significantly increased
production by more than 4.5 million barrels per day.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Second, clinton prevented the building of any new
&gt; refineries and otherwise led us to where we rely on 100% of our daily
&gt; output capability from those we have. A hurricane, possibly even a
&gt; hummingbird fart, causes gas to go up.

"/> WRONG.

The real reasons behind the increase:

1. After 9/11, Bush developed a plan to fill the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve (SPR), a 700 million bbl. store meant to sustain the U.S. in an

emergency. Last year only 40 million bbl. were added to the SPR. This
action alone drove up prices by adding to the demand for oil. An
independent analyst says that had Bush not acted, oil would be selling
for just $28 per bbl. instead of its current price of over $50 per bbl.

and gas would be under $1.50/gal. The government oil-buying binge has
not even increased the supply of available oil since most of the
petroleum added to the SPR was bought from private refiners, which have

not replenished their stocks because of high prices.

2. Bush's continued opposition to congressionally mandated increases in

fuel economy. Raising fuel-economy standards by just 1 mile a gallon
would cut U.S. oil consumption by 143 million barrels a year, or 16
days of imports, and save motorists $9 billion, the Environmental
Protection Agency estimates.

3. Bush's tax loophole allowing small business owners to deduct up to
$100,000 for purchasing the heaviest, least fuel-efficient SUVs. The
group &quot;Taxpayers for Common Sense&quot; estimates that the SUV tax loophole
costs government between $840 million and $987 million for every
100,000 vehicles sold.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;decimation of the U.S. manufacturing sector,

&gt; clinton.

"/> Sure, Clinton was president in 2001-2004 when manufacturers laid off
the greatest number of workers in recent memory.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;a global reputation in shambles,

&gt; More liberal idiot bullshit (my apologies to those liberals who are
&gt; not idiots). Our reputation with countries who are leading us to the
&gt; end of our society is irrelevant. We have the most excellent
&gt; reputations with most countries in the world, and with all of them
&gt; that matter.

"/> Yeah, if Iraq is any indication, we are very popular with the world.
Just look at how many of our allies rushed to our aid: Canada, Mexico,
Germany, Russia, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Greece,
Austria..... ooops, no they didn't. They instead CONDEMNED the war.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;issues, and on and on and on.

&gt; I wonder why that is?

"/> Please, share your wisdom with us.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;was re-elected not because of his performance in office, but
&gt;&gt;in spite of it, and by a relentless fear and terror campaign.

&gt;&gt; MK. btw, the 9/11 attacks were planned long before Bush became
&gt;&gt; President.

&gt; RSFC. And? Yet they waited till an incompetent, lazy fool took office
&gt; to implement their plans.

&gt; MK. There is no evidence that Mohammad Atta, et. al. &quot;waited&quot; for
&gt; anything; they went when they were ready. The 9/11 atacks would have
&gt; gone down if Al Gore had been President. I expect a President Gore
&gt; would have toppled the Taliban government of Afganistan, just as
&gt; President Bush did.

"/> RSFC. Except that they did wait. Clinton made sure of that with the
security measures he implemented prior to 2000. This hightened alert
resulted in the foiling of a planned LAX bombing in 2000.

9/11 wasn't the secretive, surprise attack that the Dumbya
administration likes to pretend it was. The terrorists weren't
certainly hiding their identities. They used their real names to enroll
in flight schools, to rent vehicles, and motel rooms. FBI certainly
took notice of their activies.

Let's assume Gore were president..... do you neo-cons actually believe
that he would've avoided having face-to-face meetings with his
Anti-Terrorism Expert for 8 months? That he wouldn't have reviewed the
intelligence reports/threats the Clinton administration complied on
Al-Qaeda? The same reports handed over to Dumbya? Would Gore have
ignored repeated warnings of impeding attacks, specifically warning of
hijackings? Would Gore have hired an unqualified and inexperienced
dummy like Con Rice as his National Security Advisor?

Even if 9/11 had happened under Gore's watch.... you can bet your
bottom dollar he tried everything to stop it. Not drink thru it like
Dumbya.

As for Iraq, they would still be the harmless country they've been for
a decade of UN inspections. 2000+ US soldiers would still be alive,
trillions of $$$$$$ wouldn't have been wasted and 50,000 Iraqi
civilians would be with their families, not worrying about daily
bombings, no water/electricity, high unemployment and the threat of a
civil war.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;It's funny how neo-cons blame the first WTC bombing on Clinton, even though it happened only 3 &gt;months after he took office.... yet 9/11 was Clinton's fault.

&gt; Clinton-- was &quot;an incompetent, lazy fool&quot;?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; President Clinton for a limp-wristed response to the attack, but not
&gt; for the attack itself.

"/> RSFC. What was the appropriate response? Arresting and jailing those
involved wasn't enough? WTC attack #1 wasn't nearly close to the
devastation 9/11 was. I'm sure if it had been, it would've resulted in
a similar response by Clinton. Sans the oil grab of Iraq.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; Regime change in Iraq was US policy before Bush became President.

&gt;&gt;RSFC. And? No one was foolish enough to do it....

&gt; MK. History will judge whether the Iraq war was &quot;foolish&quot;. Saddam
&gt; Hussein is no longer feeding screaming Shi'ites feet-first into
&gt; wood-chippers. He isn't subsidizing suicide bombers in Israel. If Iraq
&gt; becomes a multi-party democracy and a beacon to other Muslim peoples,
&gt; history will call Bush a visionary.

"/> RSFC. What if.... what if Dumbya wasn't a lazy drunkard, 9/11 would
just be another date. If you think a democratic Iraq will change Bush's
legacy, you're a bigger loon than I thought.

Dumbya's legacy will be that of an alcoholic frat boy, who never earned
anything that was handed to him and failed miserably at it. Whose
laziness and incompetence resulted in the worst terrorist attack in
American history. Whose corruption ran rampant and whose millions were
made from the bloods of the US soldiers and Iraqi civilians he murdered
in his quest for oil.

"/> MK. Right. Take the 1991 budget as the last &quot;peace time&quot; budget. Now
take the --difference-- between that budget and each succeeding budget.
That's what the Iraq --and Afganistan-- wars have added. About $550
billion. That's not &quot;trillions&quot;.

This angry person tells us that the President and Secretary of Defense
were supposed to know what the hijackers themselves, except the pilots,
did not know. He calls the Secretary of State &quot;an &quot;inexperienced
dummy&quot; (Stanford Provist, NSC chair, speaks Russian) and tosses loose
labels like &quot;neo-con&quot; about with abandon.

MK. If s/he really wants to be angry, there's not much anyone can do.

probably not, since it was the most successful war in US history, as
not a single US soldier was K.I.A. nor any planes shot-down, while
achieving the objective of Serbia's unconditional withdrawal.

It doesn't matter when an attack was first hatched. What matters is
what did the administration do to prevent it.

I mean, if you really want to blame someone for Osama's Jihad against
America, blame Dumbya Sr. It's his action to send troops on to Saudi
Arabian soil that got Osama's turban all up in a bunch.

Not to mention Reagan arming and training him to become the worst
terrorist in history.

But ultimately, if Dumbya had done
everything he could possibly do to prevent it, he wouldn't be getting
any
flack. But did he?

Dumbya played hide-and-seek with his Anti-Terrorism Expert for EIGHT
MONTHS. He requested a face-to-face meeting with Dumbya, on the FIRST
DAY in office, to warn him of impending Al-Qaeda attacks within the
United States. Con Rice, the National Security Advisor, also ignored
him. She did everything she could to make sure Dumbya's vacations
weren't interrupted with Presidential duties.

Dumbya finally met his Anti-Terrorism Expert, face-to-face.... a day
AFTER 9/11.

If he had heeded his repeated warnings and did SOMETHING, maybe he
would've foiled their plans, like The Millennium Bombing of LAX.

&gt; Somalia was a (mistaken) famine relief effort until President Clinton
&gt; embarked on his first &quot;nation-building&quot; exercise, and committed the US
&gt; to one side in a civil war in which the US had no stake..

"/> Another revisionist dummy. Here's what really happened:

On April, 1992, the United Nations Security Council established a UN
Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) to &quot;facilitate an immediate cessation of
hostilities
and the maintenance of a cease-fire throughout the country, and to
promote the
process of reconciliation and political settlement.&quot;

On December, 1992, President Bush announced that he would deploy 25,000
US troops to Somalia under the terms of UN resolution 794.
Significantly, resolution 794 referenced Chapter VII of the UN Charter
which concerns peace enforcement. Which proves Bush didn't send
thousands of troops there to just &quot;deliver food and leave.&quot;

When Bush shipped 25,000 US troops to Somalia, he assured the American
public that he'd return them home by Clinton's inauguration. He
actually returned only 1,000 that day, as a small token gesture, so we
wouldn't have to &quot;read his lips&quot; again.

On March, 1993, UN Security Council passed resolution 814, establishing
UNOSOM II, which reduced U.S. role in Somalia to primarily that of
logistical support, with one exception: U.S. would provide a Quick
Reaction Force of about 1,000 soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division.
On May, 1993, the UN officially took control and responsibility for
operations in Somalia.

On June, 1993, Aidid supporters ambushed and killed 24 Pakistani
soldiers. The
assault was particularly vicious. The Somali gunmen used women and
children as
shields and mutilated the Pakistani corpses. Two days later, the UN
Security Council passed resolution 837 which called for the immediate
apprehension of those responsible for the ambush. The hunt for Aidid
was on.

One month later, a U.S. Army mission to capture Aidid ended in disaster
with 18 U.S. servicemen dead. After meeting with his top advisors, the
president agreed to a new U.S. strategy to &quot;reinforce the troops, shift
from a get-Aidid policy to a more political approach and set a hard
deadline for withdrawal.&quot; Within a week, President Clinton established
a March 31, 1994 deadline for withdrawal of all American forces.

So, basically, Somalia was the last act of a lame-duck Bush presidency,
desperately wanting to improve his tarnished legacy before leaving
office. He had no military and political objective nor an exit
strategy. He made a mess and left Clinton to clean up after him.

and is the biggest threat in that region.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

immigration, you are a bigger loon than I thought. I guess they just
enjoy being blackmailed for BILLIONS in aid to N. Korea with nuclear
warheads pointed at their heads.

You're obviously clueless to the fact that there are already thousands
of North Korean defectors living in China and South Korea. South Korea
actually has an open-arm policy of helping defectors with cash,
housing, job, etc.

Again, you're a clueless loon. So it's easy to school you every single
time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I doubt that. There is a major difference in how liberals and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conservative lead our government. Liberals enjoy sending our soldiers
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to die in Somalia

&gt;&gt;&gt; neo-cons should really read up on history. This is what really
&gt;&gt;&gt; happened:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;On December 5, the UN accepts his offer, and Bush orders 25,000 US
&gt;&gt;&gt; troops into Somalia. On December 9th, the first US Marines land on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; beach.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; MK. a) What's a neo-con? b) The angry person should read up on history.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Somalia was a (mistaken) famine relief effort until President Clinton
&gt;&gt;&gt; embarked on his first &quot;nation-building&quot; exercise, and committed the US
&gt;&gt;&gt; to one side in a civil war in which the US had no stake..

&gt;&gt;Another revisionist dummy. Here's what really happened:
&gt;&gt; On April, 1992, the United Nations Security Council established a UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) &gt; to &quot;facilitate an immediate cessation of hostilities and the maintenance of a cease-fire throughout the &gt; country, and to promote the process of reconciliation and political settlement.&quot;

&gt; MK. US forces were not then involved. As the agry person notes, below,
&gt; the US did not commit forces to Somalia until after November 1992.

"/> Not only are you a loon, you also have a comprehension problem. Since
you can't read, let me help you. Somalia wasn't a US-led mission, it
was always a UN-led one. UN's goal in Somalia [to facilitate an
immediate cessation of hostilities and the maintenance of a cease-fire
throughout the country, and to promote the process of reconciliation
and political settlement.] were clearly outlined as noted in UNOSOM on
April, 1992.

Actual US involvement began in August, 1992, with the US military
airlift of aid to Somalia and Kenya.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; On December, 1992, President Bush announced that he would deploy 25,000 US troops to Somalia &gt; under the terms of UN resolution 794. Significantly, resolution 794 referenced Chapter VII of the UN &gt; Charter which concerns peace enforcement. Which proves Bush didn't send thousands of troops there &gt; to just &quot;deliver food and leave.&quot;

&gt; MK.a) Why the quotes? b) Famine relief and peace enforcement are
&gt; compatible.

"/> Relief aid and peace keeping are not mutually inclusive. Read the
answer above for an example.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; When Bush shipped 25,000 US troops to Somalia, he assured the American public that he'd return &gt; them home by Clinton's inauguration. He actually returned only 1,000 that day, as a small token &gt; gesture, so we wouldn't have to &quot;read his lips&quot; again.

&gt; MK. I don't remember any such assurance.

"/> Yeah, you neo-cons seem to suffer from selective memory.

&quot;Bush assures the American people and troops involved that this is not
an open ended commitment; the objective is to quickly provide a secure
environment so that food can get through to the starving Somalis, and
then the operation will be turned over to the UN peacekeeping forces.
He assures the public that he plans for the troops to be home by
Clinton's inauguration in January.&quot;

Pay special attention to the last line. Let me spell it out for you,
just in case: H E(BUSH) A S S U R E S T H E P U B L I C T H A T H
E (BUSH) P L A N S F O R T H E T R O O P S T O B E H O M E B

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I do remember Clinton's &quot;home
&gt; by Christmas&quot; promise when he sent troops to Bosnia.

"/> You mean he didn't even bring home 4% of the troops as a token gesture,
like Dumbya Sr did in Somalia? I guess they'll just have to relish in
the fact that everyone returned home safe and sound.... not in body
bags like Iraq.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;On March, 1993, UN Security Council passed resolution 814, establishing UNOSOM II, which reduced &gt; U.S. role in Somalia to primarily that of logistical support, with one exception: U.S. would provide a &gt; Quick Reaction Force of about 1,000 soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division. On May, 1993, the UN &gt; officially took control and responsibility for operations in Somalia.

&gt; MK. So it --was-- a US operation up to then, huh? Which countries on
&gt; the Security Council requested these resolutions? Sounds like the angry
&gt; person describes the twists of US policy in the change from the Bush to
&gt; the Clinton administrations. So far, no contradiction between his
&gt; account and mine. I am impressed by the document citations, though.
&gt; That's some digging.

"/> It was NEVER a US-led operation. It was a UN-led mission from
beginning.
Bush agreed to the mission because it was his last attempt at saving
grace of a failed presidency. With his approval rating hovering
somewhere between Hell and China, he had nothing to lose.

Bush's insistence that it was purely a &quot;humanitarian mission&quot; was just
lip service. He knew he couldn't deliver what he promised, such as
returning the troops home by Clinton's inauguration.

The only reason Bush kept referring it to as a &quot;humanitarian mission&quot;
was an attempt to absolve himself of any future blame should the
mission fail. His excuse would be, &quot;I just wanted to feed them!&quot; What a
cop-out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;On June, 1993, Aidid supporters ambushed and killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. The assault was particularly &gt; vicious. The Somali gunmen used women and children as shields and mutilated the Pakistani corpses. &gt; Two days later, the UN Security Council passed resolution 837 which called for the immediate
&gt;&gt; apprehension of those responsible for the ambush. The hunt for Aidid was on.

&gt; MK. At whose request?

"/> What part of UN resolution do you not comprehend? You neo-cons wish you
could pin this on Clinton, but it was Bush's decision to send 25,000 US
troops in to the hornet's nest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; One month later, a U.S. Army mission to capture Aidid ended in disaster with 18 U.S. servicemen &gt; dead. After meeting with his top advisors, the president agreed to a new U.S. strategy to &quot;reinforce the &gt; troops, shift from a get-Aidid policy to a more political approach and set a hard deadline for withdrawal.&quot;&gt; Within a week, President Clinton established a March 31, 1994 deadline for withdrawal of all American &gt; forces.

&gt; MK. So...Clinton decided to walk away from the &quot;nation-building&quot; effort
&gt; he'd initiated, when it blew up in his face. We agree.

"/> Clinton didn't initiate anything. Read the following again.

&quot;On April, 1992, the United Nations Security Council established a UN
Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) to &quot;facilitate an immediate cessation of
hostilities and the maintenance of a cease-fire throughout the country,
and to promote the process of reconciliation and political settlement.&quot;

Got it? No? Read it again. Repeat.

Read this too about 500 times: &quot;On May, 1993, the UN officially took
control and responsibility for operations in Somalia.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;So, basically, Somalia was the last act of a lame-duck Bush presidency, desperately wanting to improve &gt; his tarnished legacy before leaving office. He had no military and political objective nor an exit
&gt;&gt; strategy. He made a mess and left Clinton to clean up after him.

&gt; MK. Bush made a mess and Clinton made it bigger.

"/> Thank god Clinton was elected. He had the foresight to see that Somalia
was a monumental error and corrected Bush's mistake by bringing home
every single US soldier. If Bush had been re-elected, he would've
commited more troops and waited till every last US soldier came home in
a bodybag... kinda like Jr with Iraq.

more deaths of Iraqis than Saddam. In the rebellion, Bush didn't even
enforce the No-Fly Zones where the gunships were allowed to fly and mow
down the rebellion. I guess Bush wanted them dead as much as Saddam

&gt; the Security Council requested these resolutions? Sounds like the angry
&gt; person describes the twists of US policy in the change from the Bush to
&gt; the Clinton administrations. So far, no contradiction between his
&gt; account and mine. I am impressed by the document citations, though.
&gt; That's some digging.
&gt; SAP It was NEVER a US-led operation. It was a UN-led mission from
&gt; beginning.
&gt; MK. &quot;UN&quot; means --some-- country requested action. &quot;Security Council&quot;
&gt; means one of a select few countries requested action. &quot;US-led&quot; and
&gt;&quot;UN-approved&quot; are not mutually exclusive,

responsibility for
operations in Somalia&quot; do you not comprehend?

&gt; MK. At whose request?
&gt; SAP What part of UN resolution do you not comprehend? You neo-cons wish
&gt; you could pin this on Clinton, but it was Bush's decision to send
&gt; 25,000 US troops in to the hornet's nest.
&gt; MK. Yes. It was a mistake. I remember the mendacious media campaign
&gt; about starvation in Somalia, for months, until Bush caved. Except for
&gt; the insulting way SAP conducts this discussion, we don't differ that
&gt; much, factually.

"/> Bush WAS doing the right thing: delivering aid via the US military for
the first few months. Then he got too ambitious and sent 25,000 US
troops as peacekeepers. The beginning of the disaster.

&gt; MK. So...Clinton decided to walk away from the &quot;nation-building&quot; effort
&gt; he'd initiated, when it blew up in his face. We agree.
&gt; (SAP) Clinton didn't initiate anything. Read the following again.
&gt;&quot;On April, 1992, the United Nations Security Council established a UN
&gt; Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) to &quot;facilitate an immediate cessation of
&gt; hostilities and the maintenance of a cease-fire throughout the country,
&gt; and to promote the process of reconciliation and political settlement.&quot;
&gt; Got it? No? Read it again. Repeat.
&gt; MK. Not mutually exclusive,

"/>&quot;On May, 1993, the UN officially took control and responsibility for
operations in Somalia.&quot;
I thought Kofi Annan was the secretary-general of UN, not Clinton.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; MK. Discussion deleted...
&gt; SAP Thank god Clinton was elected. He had the foresight to see that
&gt; Somalia was a monumental error and corrected Bush's mistake by bringing
&gt; home every single US soldier. If Bush had been re-elected, he would've
&gt; commited more troops and waited till every last US soldier came home in
&gt; a bodybag... kinda like Jr with Iraq.
&gt; MK. Somalia was a pointless operation. I suspect it was initially a
&gt; partisan media campaign to embarass the Bush administration. He fell
&gt; for it. Clinton got ambitious and turned it into &quot;nation-building&quot;.
&gt; Doesn't matter that it had the UN stamp on it; some nation's ambassador
&gt; (who?) introduced those resolutions.
&gt; MK. Discussion deleted...
&gt; MK. &quot;Militarily decimated&quot;, huh? They managed to squash the Shia
&gt; rebelion handily. According to the CIA, Iraq was buying its way out
&gt; from under the sanctions regime.
&gt; SAP You mean the rebellion that occured in 1991? The one where Bush
&gt; incited them to revolt? They mistakenly believed Bush would back them
&gt; up militarily and were massacred. Their ancient rifles were obviously
&gt; no match for Saddam's helicopter gunships.
&gt; MK. Yup; that one. One reason I didn't vote for him in 1992. Another
&gt; was the &quot;No new taxes&quot; lie. Another was the botched handling of the
&gt; USSR collapse. If you really want to pin something on Dr. Rice, that's
&gt; where I'd start looking (Though Gorbachev blames Clintin more, and I'd
&gt; add Geoffrey Sachs to the list of suspects...but that's another
&gt; story...). To return to the argument, which I've decided to leave after
&gt; this post, so SAP can have the last word...

"/> It's not about who has the last words. It's about FACTS and how you are
completely ignorant of it. Your neo-con opinions are NOT facts, as I've
proven over and over again.

&gt; MK. Yes. Pakistan cannot control its own northwest.

&gt; discussed the alliance between big business and the public sector
&gt; unions that has created a bipartisan betrayal of American

10,000+ border patrols, $100M budget, $5 million spent on motion
detectors alone. Of course, Bush has cut spending on BPs, because he
wants more illegals to enter the country so he can grant them amnesty
and voting power, even to terrorists.

Here's an interesting tidbit I found: &quot;The Bush Administration has
outsourced $30 million in US taxpayer dollars to firms in Mexico to
produce the US Customs and Border Patrol's new uniforms.&quot;

&gt; (MK) Several of the former Soviet Republics have nuclear weapons, and

&gt; MK. That's SAP's definition. Pakistan cannot control its northwest.SAP
&gt; does not dispute.

"/> Pakistan is NOT a &quot;weak&quot; country by any means. Ask the Indians.

What this loon doesn't know, is that the Pakistani-Afghani border is
approximately 2,250 miles long. It's impossible to guard every inch of
the border. Yet, there's no threat of invasion because of treacherous
mountain terrain. Just because a few Al-Qaeda members may be hiding in
the caves doesn't make the border &quot;unsecure.&quot; Plus, no one would dare
invade Pakistan, because they are armed with nuclear weapons.

&gt; SAP Well, at least you finally admit attacking an unarmed Iraq was

&gt; MK. Only in that a) Iraq was a threat to its neighbors, and b) Hussein
&gt; used oil revenue to subsidize terrorist organizations. Oil iis a
&gt; commodity. It doesn't matter to the markets whether the country which
&gt; sells it is a muslim theorcracy, a marxist theocracy, or a
&gt; free-market-democracy

inspections and posed no threat to anyone.

&gt; Russians now in their 30s, 40s, or 50s have already accumulated a
&gt; lifetime of insults to their health.&quot;

"/>&quot;Alcohol may be a major factor behind declining life expectancy in the
former Soviet Union. The price of Russian alcohol has remained stable
or fallen between 1990-1994, despite a concurrent rise in the price of
food, housing, and other consumer goods. The study authors believe
rising public consumption of cheap, homemade, (and often toxic) liquor
has triggered a rise in binge drinking-related alcohol poisonings,
strokes, and violence.

Still, the study authors believe that recent increases in Russian death
rates &quot;may be coming to an end.&quot; They point out that during 1995, the
life expectancy of Russian men and women actually rose, to 58.3 and
71.7 years, respectively. The study authors believe those numbers could
either signal the beginning of a turnaround, or, more pessimistically,
mark &quot;the leveling-off of mortality rates at an extremely high level.&quot;

In an accompanying editorial, Dr. David A. Leon of the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Dr. Vladimir M. Shkolnikov of the
Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow note that the decline in Russian
life expectancy appears to have stopped. &quot;In 1995 and 1996,&quot; they
write, &quot;life expectancy at birth increased 2.2 years for men and 1.4
years for women, although these are still the lowest in more than 40
years.&quot;

Leon and Shkolnikov suggest that taking steps to reduce alcohol
consumption -- such as increasing tax on alcohol -- may help to raise
life expectancy. They also recommend &quot;strategies to curtail tobacco's
influence,&quot; and &quot;promotion of a more health conscious culture.&quot;

WHAT DOES ALCOHOLISM HAVE TO DO WITH &quot;HUMANITARIAN DISASTER?????

Alcoholism is a cultural issue MORON!

Maybe the world can put a stop to this &quot;humanitarian disaster&quot; by
airlifting all bottles of Vodka out of Russia. LOL!

If you think Russians living to 60 is a &quot;humanitarian disaster&quot; then
what do you call Africans with life expectancy under 40?

You're really a bigger loon than I originally gave you credit for.

What kind of a retard equates ALCOHOLISM with HUMANITARIAN
DISASTER?!?!?!?!
ROTFL!

Neo-con loon! LOL!
