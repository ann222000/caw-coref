In Mobile Phones, Older Users Say, More Is Less
All the Features Just Confuse, They Tell Vodafone, So It Tries Making a
Simple One
Pushback From Young Staffers
By DAVID PRINGLE
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

At a time when cellphones are letting users do more tricks, from video
calling to downloading digital music, one of the latest models from
Vodafone Group PLC has no camera, no browser and hardly any icons.
Instead of being sleeker and cooler than ever, the phone is large and
ordinary-looking.

What it is, though, is easy to use, and if Vodafone is right, the
market will love it. That's because of who its market is: people
getting up in years.

If the battery on the Vodafone Simply, as it's called, gets low, the
phone doesn't signal this with a tiny icon somewhere. Instead, on its
screen, the words &quot;please charge&quot; appear. If a message is waiting, a
light flashes, like in old-fashioned answering machines. To help people
who tend to lose their phones around the house and let the battery run
down, this one comes with a stand that serves as a place to stow the
thing, and charges it while it's there.

Ann Ridley is the kind of customer Vodafone has in mind. A 65-year-old
ballet teacher in Claygate, near London, Ms. Ridley rarely gives out
her mobile-phone number, never uses text messaging and doesn't store
her friends' numbers on the phone. &quot;I can't see the numbers, and it's
too complicated,&quot; she says. The result is that she uses the cellphone
for fewer than a dozen calls a year, spending less than $18 annually.

The hope at Vodafone is that when people like Ms. Ridley, who said she
wasn't familiar with the Vodafone Simply, hear about it, they'll find
its ease of use so comforting they'll start to use their cell service
more. If so, Vodafone, which collects a fee for each cellphone call,
can expect more revenue.

Vodafone isn't the only company -- nor cellphones the only industry --
trying to shape some products for older consumers or to simplify them.
At Ford Motor Co., designers who test-drive prototypes sometimes wear a
&quot;third-age&quot; suit that gives them a sense of an older person's
experience by means of stiff fabric at the elbows and knees and thick
padding at the waist. Ford has made many modifications to cars as a
result, from wider doors to more-comfortable seats, says one of its
technical specialists, Jeffrey Pike.

Philips Electronics NV, whose many products range from beard trimmers
to X-ray systems, has a &quot;Simplicity Advisory Board&quot; of outside experts,
and next month will bring out the first products of a companywide
simplicity drive. Consumers are saying, &quot;Many products complicate my
life instead of making it easier,&quot; says the head of Philips's global
marketing management, Enderson Guimaraes.

The Vodafone Simply isn't an attempt to match certain ultra-simple
phones sold to the elderly for emergency use, such as one from a France
Télécom SA unit that has no keyboard but just three big color-coded
buttons linked to preprogrammed numbers such as that of a doctor.
Instead, Vodafone is trying to appeal to a large market of middle-aged
and older people with a handset they won't find intimidating. The
company's European target market is everyone who's 40 years of age or
over and isn't issued a cellphone by an employer.

That's a sign of how young the usual market for cellphones is -- and
what a change this move is for an industry that keeps adding features
to get customers to upgrade. Vodafone's plan reflects the need for new
sources of growth. Cellular markets in much of Western Europe and Japan
are becoming saturated, so that the middle-aged and older are among the
few places to look for new growth.

Vodafone is offering the Simply in nine countries so far, not including
the U.S., a market in which it participates through a 45% stake in
Verizon Wireless. The U.S. cellphone market still is growing briskly,
although its growth, too, is expected to slow before long. The
countries where Vodafone Simply is available are the U.K., Germany,
Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, Greece and New Zealand.

Other European cellular operators have ideas similar to Vodafone's for
more effectively tapping into the older market, says Kai Oistamo, a
senior vice president at Nokia Corp. The Finnish manufacturer of
handsets is in discussions with some other service providers now, he
says.

Vodafone's initiative began two years ago, after the company surveyed
5,000 Europeans about what they wanted from a cellphone. What it heard
from consumers aged 35 to 55 shocked executives of the Newbury,
England, company. Many in that age range didn't know their cellphone
numbers or how to use basic functions.

One-third, for example, said they didn't know how to tell when they had
received a text message. Some thought the envelope icon that signals a
message meant their phone bill had arrived.

One woman in Italy told Vodafone she didn't know how to reply to a text
message, so she would send back handwritten notes through her son, on
his bicycle.

Many 35- to 55-year-olds also didn't like going into Vodafone retail
stores because the young staff -- average age 24 -- talked in acronyms
they couldn't understand. These consumers said they weren't interested
in the cameras, Internet browsers and many of the other features that
are becoming standard on the latest cellphones. &quot;Our biggest customer
segment turned round and said: 'You haven't been listening to us,' &quot;
says Guy Laurence, the company's consumer-marketing director. &quot;It was
an industry for kids.&quot;

As the Vodafone Simply project took shape, company executives debated
how much emphasis it should get. The company's chief executive, Arun
Sarin, a silver-haired 50-year-old who once headed a Silicon Valley
start-up, was convinced the appetite for a simpler handset was
substantial. &quot;It's not tiny. It's a chunk,&quot; he said at a recent news
conference.

At an industry gathering in early 2004, Mr. Laurence invited
manufacturers to build a basic handset that could make voice calls and
handle text messages and do little else. &quot;They looked at me like I was
from Mars,&quot; he recalls. &quot;They said: 'It's not needed.'&quot;

Eventually, Vodafone found a supplier in Sagem SA, a Paris-based
electronics maker. Vodafone also engaged IDEO, a London design agency
that had worked on the Palm V personal organizer, widely acclaimed for
ease of use.

During development, young Vodafone product managers kept trying to add
features, like software for sending picture messages. Mr. Laurence said
no. He showed them an old TV comedy sketch about an elderly person
being humiliated by a hi-fi salesman who delighted in the customer's
technical ignorance.

Vodafone ran the ideas of product managers past groups of over-40
consumers. One finding was that the consumers tended not to enter many
names into their cellphone contacts books because they thought they
might lose the handset and have to do it all over again on a
replacement. This wasn't good news for Vodafone, which finds that the
more names in a phone's contacts book, the more the phone gets used.

To allay people's concerns about the hassle of re-entering numbers in a
replacement phone, Vodafone made it easier to copy the contacts book
onto a personal computer for storage. The handset automatically
transfers contacts to a PC when connected to it, something that with
most handsets can't be done unless owners first install special PC
software. It is then straightforward to transfer the numbers from the
PC back to a replacement cellphone.

Based on what older customers told it, Vodafone also installed
dedicated buttons for volume control and for locking the keypad, to
prevent accidental redialing of the last number called. It added a
'tips' function to give users guidance if they got stuck in any of the
menus. The handset is bigger than most and has a spacious keypad.

Gary Sheehan, a 38-year-old director of a London information-technology
company, likes that keypad, along with the phone's simple menus and
large screen. He replaced his Sony Ericsson camera phone with a
Vodafone Simply in July. &quot;It was all singing, all dancing,&quot; he says of
his old phone. &quot;But if I wanted to change the ringer volume, I couldn't
find it.&quot;

On his new one, &quot;I can see what I am typing without squinting,&quot; he
says.

The downside is that his colleagues at the IT firm, mostly in their
20s, frequently mock his choice of handset. He says his wife, using
British slang for &quot;idiot,&quot; calls it the &quot;Vodafone Wally phone.&quot; But he
doesn't care: &quot;I just wanted a phone that phoned,&quot; he says.

The simple handset remains a work in progress. In the 2½ months since
Vodafone launched it in mid-May, the company has decided it needed to
make about 60 tweaks to the software.

The company's Mr. Laurence was wary of permitting advertising agencies,
typically staffed by young people, to create a commercial for the
phone, fearing it would be too flashy or complicated. The company first
commissioned a print ad to run in a European edition of Good
Housekeeping magazine -- not a usual venue for cellphone advertising.
Its print ads, which also ran in Golf Monthly, picture the handset and
describe what each button does.

One of them, highlighting the volume-control button, says: &quot;No mucking
about in menus to find the right setting. So no excuses for letting
your Vodafone Simply phone ring in the middle of your cousin's
wedding.&quot;

Mr. Laurence ran the ad by product managers working on fancy multimedia
handsets for young people. &quot;The more they hated it, the more we knew we
were on the right track,&quot; he says. Vodafone eventually ran television
commercials for the phone in four of its markets.

It won't say how many of the phones it has sold, but Mr. Laurence says
the company expects to at least recoup its investment through added
revenue. The average age of the phone's users is 45.

Many young staffers in Vodafone's retail stores don't seem to grasp the
concept, because they keep pushing older ...

I am so glad to learn what Vodafone is doing for older adults. I have
been predicting for some time that smart marketers are going to find
the older market soon and some are going to make millions from it.
Seems like Vodafone and a few others such as Ford and Phillips
Electronics are seeing this as well.

I am considering a cell and may just wait for Vodafone. I had one for
a year, but it wasn't useful to me, so I gave it up. What is mentioned
about all of their clerks being age 24 is quite true. What is not
mentioned is that most of their clerks don't know anything about their
product.

In my experience the Suncom people are trained in quackery, puffery,
lying, deviousness, and changing the subject when you pin them down.

My experience with them was fatal and they will never see another penny
from me.

I also had a bad experience with US Cellular, but at least in dealing
with their employees they were scrupulously honest.

Don't ever, ever buy a cellphone without very detailed investigation of
the purveyor. Take it from someone who has learned the hard way and
has developed a little understanding after living 60 years -- but still
makes mistakes. If I had first done a little googling about Suncom, I
would have avoided them like they were the plague.

"/> Caught this over the telly news. I wasn't paying attention so some of
my report may be inaccurate. Do put in your corrections.

There is a new service called ICE for &quot;in case of emergency&quot; for cell
phones. Cellphones don't have a universal 911 emergency service. The
service started in the UK and seems to have spread around the world.

In ICE I think you register with an (volunteer?) organization that
will store your personal details on their computer. You key their ICE
phone number into your cellphone's memory. You can also key in the
phone numbers, ICE2, ICE3, etc. of your closest kin to call in case
of an emergency. Thus if you are badly injured or unable to
communicate someone finding your cellphone can call up ICE and get
vital information on you as well as report the emergency. There were
some other services provided, like locating you in case you are lost.

"/> exactly. i also work in technology industry

i got my mom a phone (who's in her late 60s).
she's no dummy but far from technical savvy.
i told her to read the manual &amp; she would not read it cause the font is too
small. it was just so much easier to ask me to set it up than putting glasses
&amp; figureing out her self. sigh.

although one thing i did find a bit offensive about the article is they assume
people above 40 are all senile &amp; dumb. there're also plenty of younger people
who want a simpler phone without camera, web browsing, MP3, etc. or who have
poor eyesight &amp; need big buttons.

btw, i also use 6310i too. it's pretty simple but still too complicated for my
mom.

I agree - a phone is a phone. It is not a camera, radio, tv or
computer. Don't know the statistics, but I guess many cell phones are
purchased for emergency and/or use away from home and they should be
large enough number buttons that are not too small for your fingers.

Older adults can learn to use a cell phone, but the existing
instruction manuals are in tiny text and read like they were translated
from Ugandan. An older adult wants a phone with clearly marked on/off
buttons. They want to have their children and perhaps the bridge/golf
club members programmed in. They need to have AAA or some such
programmed in if they drive. They don't want text or pictures.

If developers would begin with the need of the consumer rather than
with their desire to make technology more sophisticated. There is a
huge need considering our aging population and someone is going to get
rich as they realize it.

&gt; So, rather than find out how to reply to a text message she didn't
&gt; bother to learn how to do it and relied on the way she's done things
&gt; for the last forty years. People treating people like they're stupid
&gt; or fools only encourages the stereotype that anyone &quot;of an age&quot; has to
&gt; be incompetent. A teenager who encounters a rotary dial phone and is
&gt; puzzled by it is no different.

&gt;&gt;As the Vodafone Simply project took shape, company executives debated
&gt;&gt;how much emphasis it should get. The company's chief executive, Arun
&gt;&gt;Sarin, a silver-haired 50-year-old who once headed a Silicon Valley
&gt;&gt;start-up, was convinced the appetite for a simpler handset was
&gt;&gt;substantial. &quot;It's not tiny. It's a chunk,&quot; he said at a recent news
&gt;&gt;conference.

&gt; I use a Nokia 6310i. I don't think there's anything that my handset
&gt; does on its own that is not simple to use with a minimal look at the
&gt; owner's manual. Why people think that you don't have to learn
&gt; *anything* about a device you're going to use is really beyond me.

"/> Because there are devices you can use without reading a damned book. I
would like a phone like this for a child as well. Something that has
all the basic functions available with one touch of a key or a very
basic menu.

dont make sense. He can use a computer, a microwave, a tv, dvd player

at a cell phone, that doesnt mean she doesnt have need. She wants to
dial numbers and thats it.

When I look at tech, I tend to look at it with my son in mind. If he
can figure it out, its pretty intuitive. It requires basic intelligence
and ability to use technology but not very high language skills.

Hell, I have a degree in damned computer science and cant figure out my

Gee, maybe I can go invent some stuff. Im going to go invent him a
phone that will allow me to input pics of who he wants to call, then
one the call is made,picture menus of what he wants to say.

Sorry, it's either reading manuals or not using these extended
functions, until consumer phones get smart enough to react to spoken
commands and to relay messages automatically at a convenient
time. Like waiting for you to leave the cinema to enable the phone for
all calls and relaying to you that mom said &quot;Hi&quot; in a normal,
unstressed voice.

&gt; I have an 80 something year old grandmother who wont even use a VCR
&gt; and I have an autistic kid. I see the need for devices that tell you
&gt; how to use them. My son is intelligent, but cant figure out things
&gt; that just dont make sense. He can use a computer, a microwave, a tv,
&gt; dvd player etc. He cannot go thru 4 level menus. My grandmother
&gt; wouldnt even LOOK at a cell phone, that doesnt mean she doesnt have
&gt; need. She wants to dial numbers and thats it.

&gt; When I look at tech, I tend to look at it with my son in mind. If he
&gt; can figure it out, its pretty intuitive. It requires basic
&gt; intelligence and ability to use technology but not very high
&gt; language skills.

&gt; Hell, I have a degree in damned computer science and cant figure out
&gt; my husbands phone.

&gt; Gee, maybe I can go invent some stuff. Im going to go invent him a
&gt; phone that will allow me to input pics of who he wants to call, then
&gt; one the call is made,picture menus of what he wants to say.
&gt; Call:Mommy
&gt; Say : Im lost, Im hungry, Take me home

"/> It'd be interesting to see how that went. Likely it would end up
in the quagmire of intuitive pics for that sort of thing tho. Thats
been a massive problem with public signs for half a century now.

Another problem is mental deterioration with the geriatrics.

It was interesting to watch my dad who only started using computers
in his 60s, eventually losing the concept of multiple windows on the Mac.

Interesting what he could manage before it got that bad tho, when
he ended up in hospital after a fall, I discovered a massive pile of
paper that was the result of him printing out his order on the Mac,
faxing it to the full service restaurant in the retirement village, with
them delivering the orders on golf buggys etc.

We never did manage to fax him stuff towards the end, it became
impossible to stop him picking up the phone and killing the incoming fax call,
even tho he was told in advance that he was going to get a fax right now.

He ended up with some bizarre idea that the fridge door was
significant to the chance of success with an incoming fax.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Ann Ridley is the kind of customer Vodafone has in mind. A
&gt;&gt;&gt; 65-year-old ballet teacher in Claygate, near London, Ms. Ridley
&gt;&gt;&gt; rarely gives out her mobile-phone number, never uses text messaging
&gt;&gt;&gt; and doesn't store her friends' numbers on the phone. &quot;I can't see
&gt;&gt;&gt; the numbers, and it's too complicated,&quot; she says. The result is
&gt;&gt;&gt; that she uses the cellphone for fewer than a dozen calls a year,
&gt;&gt;&gt; spending less than $18 annually.

&gt;&gt; And Voda thinks that going after this &quot;lucrative&quot; market is going to
&gt;&gt; substantially enrich their coffers?
&gt; Breadth not depth.
&gt;&gt;&gt; company's European target market is everyone who's 40 years of age
&gt;&gt;&gt; or over and isn't issued a cellphone by an employer.

&gt;&gt; I think they severely misunderstand people who are of &quot;that age.&quot;
&gt;&gt; They make it sound like anyone over 40 is ready to be set out to the
&gt;&gt; rocker on the front porch and are a bunch of doddering old farts.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One-third, for example, said they didn't know how to tell when they
&gt;&gt;&gt; had received a text message. Some thought the envelope icon that
&gt;&gt;&gt; signals a message meant their phone bill had arrived.

&gt;&gt; Well, perhaps if they'd bother to crack the user's manual or bothered
&gt;&gt; to ask the clerk at the Voda or T-Mobile shop for some basic
&gt;&gt; instruction they wouldn't be nearly so ignorant of basic phone
&gt;&gt; functions.
&gt; Who wants to do that? I dont want to have to take a class to use my
&gt; phone (Thinking of a jr college class in using the ti-82 calculator)

&gt;&gt;&gt; One woman in Italy told Vodafone she didn't know how to reply to a
&gt;&gt;&gt; text message, so she would send back handwritten notes through her
&gt;&gt;&gt; son, on his bicycle.

&gt;&gt; So, rather than find out how to reply to a text message she didn't
&gt;&gt; bother to learn how to do it and relied on the way she's done things
&gt;&gt; for the last forty years. People treating people like they're stupid
&gt;&gt; or fools only encourages the stereotype that anyone &quot;of an age&quot; has
&gt;&gt; to be incompetent. A teenager who encounters a rotary dial phone
&gt;&gt; and is puzzled by it is no different.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As the Vodafone Simply project took shape, company executives
&gt;&gt;&gt; debated how much emphasis it should get. The company's chief
&gt;&gt;&gt; executive, Arun Sarin, a silver-haired 50-year-old who once headed
&gt;&gt;&gt; a Silicon Valley start-up, was convinced the appetite for a simpler
&gt;&gt;&gt; handset was substantial. &quot;It's not tiny. It's a chunk,&quot; he said at
&gt;&gt;&gt; a recent news conference.

&gt;&gt; I use a Nokia 6310i. I don't think there's anything that my handset
&gt;&gt; does on its own that is not simple to use with a minimal look at the
&gt;&gt; owner's manual. Why people think that you don't have to learn
&gt;&gt; *anything* about a device you're going to use is really beyond me.
&gt; Because there are devices you can use without reading a damned book. I
&gt; would like a phone like this for a child as well. Something that has
&gt; all the basic functions available with one touch of a key or a very
&gt; basic menu.
&gt; One button- call mom
&gt; one button- check messages
&gt; one button- read txt mssg
&gt; one button- reply to mom using canned replies

capability can run an app that can do that stuff.

"/> I agree with your point that even some simple things require
documentation or training to use properly. I have seen people
use a hammer incorrectly, for instance.

However, I think it'd be possible to make a VCR that records
while you're out and does it in a very obvious, easy fashion,
almost as easy as turning on the faucet:

1. Get a dedicated 21&quot; LCD touchscreen, and put a big label on it that
says &quot;record panel&quot;.
2. Fetch TV schedule from internet, display on &quot;record panel&quot;.
3. Any show the user touches with their finger gets recorded.
You want to record &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;? You put your
finger on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, and it highlights that
show, and then (when it's time), it records it.

It'd expensive, it'd be big, and you'd have to (gasp) walk over to
the machine. But, it would be really obvious how to use it.

&gt; However, I think it'd be possible to make a VCR that records while you're out

&gt; 1. Get a dedicated 21&quot; LCD touchscreen, and put a big label on it that says
&gt;&quot;record panel&quot;.
&gt; 2. Fetch TV schedule from internet, display on &quot;record panel&quot;.
&gt; 3. Any show the user touches with their finger gets recorded.
&gt; You want to record &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;? You put your finger on
&gt;&quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, and it highlights that show, and then (when it's
&gt; time), it records it.

"/> Thats not a VCR, thats a PVR.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It'd expensive, it'd be big, and you'd have to (gasp) walk over to the

"/> Yes, but it isnt a VCR.

Yes, its pretty obvious how to name entrys in a phone
list with a full sized keyboard available. Its never going
to be anything like as obvious as a faucet with a
cellphone with just a basic keyboard for text entry tho.

Thats the problem with a VCR, it just doesnt have
anything that can be used to make programming it to
record while you are out as easy to use as a faucet.

It isnt hard to make a toaster as easy to use as a faucet,
essentially because what needs to be done is as simple.

It isnt even possible to make a door as easy to
use as a faucet once you allow it to be locked etc.

answer (even assuming there's only one of those keys). It answers
the phone *IF* it is ringing, and it starts a new call if it isn't.
The problem here is that you may not know the caller just hung up,
and you may put the phone back on your belt eating up lots and lots
of minutes ...

I usually use the 5 key. If I miss by one key in any direction, it
still answers the phone.

Oh, yes, I really hate it when I discover the *UNDOCUMENTED* feature
that pressing on the 9 key for a long time (easy to do when sitting
in a chair with arms with the phone on your belt) that it calls
911. If that feature is worth having, it's worth documenting. The
cellular company even denied the feature existed until they managed
to demonstrate it (I refuse to make deliberate test calls to 911,
but if you do, accidentally or not, stay on the line and apologize).

"/> Except those damned hyper-intelligent infrared sensor ones they have
in airport bathrooms. Yes, I realize that it has a sensor and that
I have to hold my hand in the right place, and then it will work.

The trouble is two things: one, someone decided to make them all
sleek and minimalist (no doubt to accentuate the fact that knobs
aren't necessary, oooh, ahhh), so I can't tell where the sensor IS
and thus where I'm supposed to hold my hands; and two, they have
some sort of a low-pass filter on their input so that if your hand
momentarily moves from the sensor area, the faucet doesn't immediately
turn off, which is great EXCEPT that it prevents you from getting
useful feedback until after you've moved your hands. The combination
of not knowing how long you can be out of the zone before it shuts
off and not having any information about the boundaries of the zone
is what makes it especially frustrating.

Often, I end up putting one hand in some area that I *know* is
going to trigger the sensor (which is usually also an area that's
not under the stream of water), and the other hand goes under the
water. Then I switch. Given that part of a successful hand washing
experience is rubbing your hands together, this is not an entirely
satisfying state of affairs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It aint even possible in the real world most of the time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing 'self evident' about a power switch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In spades with those you press to turn the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; device on and press again to turn it off again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The concept of an owners manual (and a work, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; training class) for a telephone, is frigging ridiculous.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It aint necessarily feasible to do a relatively complex
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; device like a VCR or cellphone without one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It should be like a faucet- look at it, and you know how to work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not even possible with a cellphone or a VCR.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yup.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have an autistic kid that can use a device that is simple.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Microwave-one touch button for popcorn
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; VCR-one button for play one for FWD one for REW even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if he calls them &quot;fwd'and &quot;rew&quot;, he knows HOW they work.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Have fun designing a VCR that can record while you are
&gt;&gt;&gt; out in a way that's as obvious as a faucet. Cant be done.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Phone. Press &quot;call&quot;, list of people appears on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; screen, press one button to call said person.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Pity about how you get the names into the list in the first place.

&gt;&gt; It can be done simply.

&gt; Nothing like as simple as a faucet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do 'tech' for a living, and make pretty good money at it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some of the hardware and software coming in baffles me,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so I know our casual end users are gonna be clueless.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, but thats a different matter to your silly claim that its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; actually possible to design a VCR or a cellphone so that it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can be used by someone who has never seen one without
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any instructions on how to use it or a manual etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bah.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Blah.

&gt;&gt; I think its possible.

&gt; You're wrong. Most obviously with recording while you are
&gt; out with a VCR or with a list of numbers to call in a cellphone.

"/> NOT ALL USERS WANT THAT FUNCTION.
Thats the issue.
A VCR can be made with basic: play, ffd, rew and rec functions and no
need to read instructios,. I know because I have one and my kid learned
touse it with no manual or instructions or ever being told. He got a
tape, stuck it in there and pushed buttons till it did what he wanted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Its never going to be possible to make the entry of text for the
&gt; numbers to call using the keypad without instructions or a manual.

&gt;Caught this over the telly news. I wasn't paying attention so some of
&gt;my report may be inaccurate. Do put in your corrections.

&gt;There is a new service called ICE for &quot;in case of emergency&quot; for cell
&gt;phones. Cellphones don't have a universal 911 emergency service. The
&gt;service started in the UK and seems to have spread around the world.

&gt;In ICE I think you register with an (volunteer?) organization that
&gt;will store your personal details on their computer. You key their ICE
&gt;phone number into your cellphone's memory. You can also key in the
&gt;phone numbers, ICE2, ICE3, etc. of your closest kin to call in case
&gt;of an emergency. Thus if you are badly injured or unable to
&gt;communicate someone finding your cellphone can call up ICE and get
&gt;vital information on you as well as report the emergency. There were
&gt;some other services provided, like locating you in case you are lost.

"/> I have heard of ICE, but as I heard it, there is no such organization.
You program &quot;ICE&quot; as a name in your directory with the phone number of
someone who will care. ICEn if there are more than one.

&gt;&gt; I believe that Cingular only charges you if you open the message.

&gt; That would be dumb. If it has been transmitted and received, then all
&gt; their costs would have already occurred. Why would they want to add
&gt; even more costs in monitoring the opened/unopened status?

"/>  I just know that when I get messages from unknown sources I do not
read them and have not been charged.
Cingular does do one sneaky thing. They tell you how to send them a
message to check your minutes and tell you there is no charge. They fail
to tell you that you that you get billed for the message they send. Of
course you can avoid the charge by dialing 611.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If a message is waiting, a light flashes,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like in old-fashioned answering machines.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, just basic instruction in the beginning pages of a user's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manual should make it quite clear what's the indication that

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Basic concept of human factor engineering is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that everyday objects should be self-evident.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It aint even possible in the real world most of the time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nothing 'self evident' about a power switch.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In spades with those you press to turn the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; device on and press again to turn it off again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The concept of an owners manual (and a work, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; training class) for a telephone, is frigging ridiculous.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It aint necessarily feasible to do a relatively complex
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; device like a VCR or cellphone without one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It should be like a faucet- look at it, and you know how to work
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not even possible with a cellphone or a VCR.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nup.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have an autistic kid that can use a device that is simple.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Microwave-one touch button for popcorn
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; VCR-one button for play one for FWD one for REW even
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; if he calls them &quot;fwd'and &quot;rew&quot;, he knows HOW they work.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have fun designing a VCR that can record while you are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; out in a way that's as obvious as a faucet. Cant be done.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Phone. Press &quot;call&quot;, list of people appears on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; screen, press one button to call said person.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pity about how you get the names into the list in the first place.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It can be done simply.

&gt;&gt; Nothing like as simple as a faucet.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do 'tech' for a living, and make pretty good money at it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some of the hardware and software coming in baffles me,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; so I know our casual end users are gonna be clueless.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure, but thats a different matter to your silly claim that its

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can be used by someone who has never seen one without

&gt; do-able in the long run, but it'll not as cheap at first.

"/> Personally, I don't even need a VCR that does that. I just want a
television set that can be a little more intelligent about figuring
out what I like.

Some really obvious, easy to implement features that I'd like to see
in a TV set:

1. A &quot;Not Interested&quot; button on the remote. When you're flipping
through channels and you push this button, the TV will remember
that you're not interested in that channel until the end of the
next 30-minute time block. From that point on, the channel
will be skipped when you're flipping through stuff.

2. An &quot;Interested&quot; button you can press, which does the reverse.
Basically, it makes it a temporary favorite out of a channel.
You can then flip back and forth between channels you're
interested in. That way, if you see that Seinfeld is on,
but you don't know if you've seen it before, you can put that
on the list along with a few other shows, and then flip back
and forth between them for the first few minutes to decide
which one you want to watch.

3. A system that tracks which channels you leave the TV on
at what times and tries to infer from that what combinations
of time and channel you like. If you flip to a channel
and leave it on that for a long time, that would indicate you
like that show. If you flip to a channel and keep flipping
BACK to it several times within the same 30 minute timeslot,
that would be an even strong indication that you want to
watch it. Over several weeks, the TV could build up a fairly
accurate picture of what channels you like to watch at what
times, and eventually it could either prompt you that a show
you like is already on or is coming up soon.

4. Similar to #3, it could build on the data gathered about which
30-minute timeslots you frequently watch, and make inferences
about which channels are your favorites, possibly even broken
down by time of day. For example, in my case, it would notice
that I virtually never watch most sports channels, but I do
often watch Court TV, A&amp;E, and Discovery. So, when I am looking
to unwind and I sit down in front of the television, it would
give me the option of flipping through those channels first.

This kind of stuff probably wouldn't be useful for everybody (some
people can actually remember which shows they want to watch AND
what time they come on, but I'm not that dedicated), but it would
make it easier for me to find something on when I randomly plop
myself down in front of the TV and just want to veg out for a bit.

Somewhere in your contract or the options, you must have some kind of
provision for data services. I don't. The first junk text message I
received that showed up on my cingular bill, I called Cingular to disable
incoming text messages. IMHO, I shouldn't have to DO that, as text
messaging should be disabled by default on all new cellular contracts.

But I can't bitch too much about cingular, as overall their service is
great. And all of the other providers I've tried have tried to charge me
for incoming text messages also. So it's not a &quot;cingular&quot; problem. -Dave

&gt; 2. Fetch TV schedule from internet, display on &quot;record panel&quot;.
&gt; 3. Any show the user touches with their finger gets recorded.
&gt; You want to record &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;? You put your
&gt; finger on &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;, and it highlights that
&gt; show, and then (when it's time), it records it.

&gt; It'd expensive, it'd be big, and you'd have to (gasp) walk over to
&gt; the machine. But, it would be really obvious how to use it.

"/> And the public would complain both about the $1,295 price tag and the
$29.95/month subscription fee (for the real-time updated guide).

Technology will catch up and such things will become possible at
reasonable prices. I remember as a kid watching a show (&quot;Outer
Limits&quot;?) introduced by a computer that was typing everything the
announcer was saying. It filled a room and cost tens of millions of
dollars (probably billions in 200x dollars), and it wasn't all that
accurate at getting the words or spelling right. Now my V710 somehow
recognizes pronounced words of foreign origin (last names of people)
in a $300 device that fits in my pocket.

Go ahead and dream of the future, and dream BIG because it's moving
fast and hard. But don't expect the dreams to become reality overnight.
