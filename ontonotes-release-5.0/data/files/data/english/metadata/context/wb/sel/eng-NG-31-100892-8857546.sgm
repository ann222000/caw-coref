1 Seeing isn't believing
TAKE a moment to observe the world around you. Scan the horizon with your eyes.
Tilt your head back and listen. You're probably getting the impression that your
senses are doing a fine job of capturing everything that is going on. Yet that
is all it is: an impression.

Despite the fact that your visual system seems to provide you with a continuous
widescreen movie, most of the time it is only gathering information from a tiny
patch of the visual field. The rest of the time it isn't even doing that.
Somehow from this sporadic input it conjures up a seamless visual experience.

What is going on? Bang in the middle of your retina is a small patch of densely
crowded photoreceptors called the fovea. This is the retina's sweet spot, the
only part of the eye capable of seeing with the rich detail and full colour we
take for granted. This tiny spot - which covers an area of our visual field no
bigger than the moon in the sky - feeds your visual system almost all of its raw
information.

To build up a big picture, your eyes constantly dart about, fixating for a
fraction of a second and then moving on. These jerky movements between fixations
are called saccades, and we make about three per second, each lasting between 20
and 200 microseconds.

The curious thing about saccades is that while they are happening we are
effectively blind. The brain doesn't bother to process information picked up
during a saccade because the eyes move too rapidly to capture anything useful.
All in all, your visual system works like a man blundering around in the dark
waving around a flickering torch with a very narrow beam.

Despite the fact that you don't normally notice saccades, you can catch them in
action. Look at your eyes close-up in the mirror and flick your focus back and
forth from one pupil to another. However hard you try you cannot see your eyes
move - even though somebody watching you can. That's because the motion is a
saccade, and your brain isn't paying attention. Now pick two spots in the
corners of your visual field and flick your gaze from one to the other and back
again. If you're lucky you'll notice, just barely, a brief flash of darkness.
This is your visual cortex clocking off.

So how does your brain weave such fragmentary information into a seamless movie?
This remains something of a mystery. The best explanation, according to Andrew
Hollingworth of the University of Iowa in Iowa City, is that your short-term and
long-term visual memories retain information from previous fixations and
integrate them into a here-and-now visual experience (Visual Cognition, vol 14,
p 781).

There is also some guesswork going on. You can get a feel for this from the
frozen-time illusion - the sensation that you sometimes get when you look at a
clock and the second hand appears to freeze momentarily before tick-tocking back
into action.

This happens because of saccades. To compensate for the temporary shut-down of
vision, your brain makes a guess at what it would have seen, but it does so
retrospectively. So the 100 or so milliseconds of blindness gets back-filled
with the image that appears after the saccade is over. If your eyes happen to
alight on the clock just after the second hand has moved, your brain assumes
that the hand was in that location for the duration of the saccade too. The
&quot;second&quot; then lasts about 10 per cent longer than normal, which is enough for
you to notice.

The weirdness isn't confined to vision. Your auditory system is also full of
gaps and glitches that the brain cleans up so we can make sense of the world.
This is especially true of speech.

In everyday life we encounter lots of situations that obscure or distort
people's voices, yet most of the time we understand effortlessly. This is
because our brain pastes in the missing sounds, a phenomenon called phonemic
restoration. It is so effective that it is sometimes hard to tell that the
missing sounds are not there.

A good demonstration of this effect was published last year by Makio Kashino of
NTT Communication Science Laboratories in Atsugi, Japan. He recorded a voice
saying &quot;Do you understand what I'm trying to say?&quot; then removed short chunks and
replaced them with silence. This made the sentence virtually unintelligible. But
when he filled the gaps with loud white noise, the sentence miraculously becomes
understandable (Acoustic Science and Technology, vol 27, p 318).

&quot;The sounds we hear are not copies of physical sounds,&quot; Kashino says. &quot;The brain
fills in the gaps, based on the information in the remaining speech signal.&quot; The
effect is so powerful that you can even record a sentence, chop it into
50-millisecond slices, reverse every single slice and play it back - and it is
perfectly intelligible. You can listen to Kashino's sound files at
http://asj.gr.jp/2006/data/kashi/index.html .

“The sounds we hear are not copies of physical sounds”Another demonstration of
the brain's ability to extract meaning from distorted signals is a form of
synthesised speech called sine-wave speech. When you first hear a sentence in
sine-wave speech it sounds alien and unintelligible, somewhat reminiscent of
whistling or birdsong. But if you listen to the same sentence in normal speech
and then return to the sine-wave version, it suddenly snaps into auditory focus.
Try as you might, you cannot &quot;unhear&quot; the words that you didn't even realise
were words the first time you heard them (listen to demos at
www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/~mattd/sine-wave-speech and
www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/home/Chris_Darwin/SWS ).

According to Matt Davis of the UK Medical Research Council's Cognition and Brain
Sciences Unit in Cambridge, this happens because the brain has circuits that
respond to speech, but doesn't switch them on unless it detects spoken language
(Hearing Research, vol 229, p 132). Sine-wave speech isn't speech-like enough to
trigger the circuits, but once you know it is speech they spring into action.
&quot;It's an example of top-down influence,&quot; says Davis. &quot;What you know about what
you're hearing changes the way you hear it.&quot;

Given the tricks that your visual and auditory systems play, it probably comes
as no surprise that when they get together, fights can break out. A good
demonstration of this is the McGurk effect, in which listening to a series of
identical syllables such as &quot;ba ba ba ba&quot; while watching somebody mouth &quot;ba da
la va&quot; makes you hear &quot;ba da la va&quot;. Try it for yourself at
www.faculty.ucr.edu/~rosenblu/lab-index.html .

Until recently, psychologists believed that the visual system always trumps the
other senses, but in 2000 a team of psychologists at the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena proved that this isn't the case. They showed volunteers a
single flash on a computer screen. If they accompanied the flash with two very
short beeps, the volunteers saw two flashes - in other words, this time the
auditory system wins (Nature, vol 408, p 788). See the illusion at
www.cns.atr.jp/~kmtn/soundInducedIllusoryFlash2/index.html .

2 This is not my nose
YOU may know the crossed-hands illusion. Hold your arms out in front of you and
cross them over, rotate your hands so your palms face each other, then mesh your
fingers together. Now slowly rotate your hands up between your arms so you're
staring at your knuckles. Ask someone to point to one of your index fingers,
then attempt to move it. Did you move the wrong one?

If so, you've just experienced a minor failure of your body schema - your mental
representation of the location, position and boundaries of your body. Your brain
builds this up by drawing on data from vision, touch and a body-wide network of
proprioceptive sensors that monitor position. Your body schema is a critical
part of self-awareness, which is why it feels so odd when it goes wrong.

In the crossed-hands illusion, the schema fails because of a confusing visual
input. You don't normally see your hands in this convoluted position; the finger
you move is the one that is pointing in the direction that the correct one would
be pointing if you had simply clasped your hands as if in prayer.

An even odder way of disturbing your body schema is an illusion that taps
straight into your sense of body ownership. Known as the rubber-hand illusion,
it fools you into thinking a rubber hand - or even a piece of wood, or a table -
is part of your body.

To experience the illusion, get hold of a model hand (it doesn't have to be very
realistic) and put it on the table in front of you. If it is a left hand, put
your actual left hand somewhere you can't see it, in the same pose as the rubber
hand. Now get someone to touch and stroke your unseen hand and the rubber hand
with identical movements. If you concentrate on the rubber hand, you will
probably get the uncanny feeling that it is your own. (See a video of the rubber
hand illusion here)

What this illusion shows is that your sense of body ownership is less anchored
in reality than you think. Your brain will happily override information from
proprioception to conjure up an incorrect yet coherent body schema based on
vision and touch.

In fact, your mental body map is an absolute sucker for visual information. This
year Frank Durgin of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania set up the illusion as
described above but instead of touching the rubber hand he merely &quot;stroked&quot; it
with light from a laser pointer, leaving the unseen hand alone. Two-thirds of
220 subjects reported a sense of ownership of the rubber hand and said they had
the sensation of heat and even touch from the laser pointer (Psychological
Science, vol 18, p 152). &quot;It's obvious the hand is rubber - no one is fooled at
all,&quot; says Durgin. &quot;But if your brain decides it's your hand, all the conscious
awareness in the

I would almost say the opposite.  Seeing is believing.  Believing,
with justification, that in the combination of quick reconnoitering
and algorithms in the brain we can draw conclusions about moving
around in even very complex environments.  Wonderful.  It also shows
that even basic sesory-motor activities depend on what could be called
intuition.  Pattern recognition at very rapid speeds.  That this kind
of intuition fails and sometimes misses novelty does not take away
from the incredible usefulness and accuracy in many situations.  If we
move to other areas of the brain, we find other kinds of intuition,
able to reconize patterns that reductionist analysis and lab
recreations have trouble with.  Maybe in a few years they will build a
robot insect that can do everything an insect can do, but I doubt it.
To recreate by the kinds of mechnical no leap plodding lab work the
range of human intuition will take centuries more.  Here's the thing.
We should have more faith in intuition, we use it all the time.  But
many scientists, for example, use fundamentalists and the most shallow
of New Age people to reinforce their own prejudices against intuition
as a tool.  And they assume because there are some idiots out there,
it is best to shut down and ignore the intuitive side of perception
and pattern recognition altogether.

Thank God the algorithms in my brain caught on to this pattern long
before i was able to untrain my brain from where it had been ignoring
all sorts of patterns not currently validated by science.

One way to view this is as an example of system engineering and the
compromises it entails.  Our sensors (eyes, ears, etc.) are far from
ideal; our brain has many limitations.  Selection pressures have
favored an amalgam of these things that does the best possible job of
survival in the environment in which we evolved. Naturally, tests can
be devised that expose the compromises in the system.  Could the
system have fewer such flaws if one or more of its elements were made
more capable?   Undoubtedly.  Something for AI designers to
contemplate.

&gt; sine-wave speech it sounds alien and unintelligible, somewhat reminiscent of
&gt; whistling or birdsong. But if you listen to the same sentence in normal speech
&gt; and then return to the sine-wave version, it suddenly snaps into auditory focus.
&gt; Try as you might, you cannot &quot;unhear&quot; the words that you didn't even realise
&gt; were words the first time you heard them (listen to demos at www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/~mattd/sine-wave-speechandwww.lifesci.sussex.ac... ).

&gt; According to Matt Davis of the UK Medical Research Council's Cognition and Brain
&gt; Sciences Unit in Cambridge, this happens because the brain has circuits that
&gt; respond to speech, but doesn't switch them on unless it detects spoken language
&gt; (Hearing Research, vol 229, p 132). Sine-wave speech isn't speech-like enough to
&gt; trigger the circuits, but once you know it is speech they spring into action.
&gt; &quot;It's an example of top-down influence,&quot; says Davis. &quot;What you know about what
&gt; you're hearing changes the way you hear it.&quot;

&gt; Given the tricks that your visual and auditory systems play, it probably comes
&gt; as no surprise that when they get together, fights can break out. A good
&gt; demonstration of this is the McGurk effect, in which listening to a series of
&gt; identical syllables such as &quot;ba ba ba ba&quot; while watching somebody mouth &quot;ba da
&gt; la va&quot; makes you hear &quot;ba da la va&quot;. Try it for yourself at www.faculty.ucr.edu/~rosenblu/lab-index.html .

&gt; Until recently, psychologists believed that the visual system always trumps the
&gt; other senses, but in 2000 a team of psychologists at the California Institute of
&gt; Technology in Pasadena proved that this isn't the case. They showed volunteers a
&gt; single flash on a computer screen. If they accompanied the flash with two very
&gt; short beeps, the volunteers saw two flashes - in other words, this time the
&gt; auditory system wins (Nature, vol 408, p 788). See the illusion at www.cns.atr.jp/~kmtn/soundInducedIllusoryFlash2/index.html .

&gt; 2 This is not my nose
&gt; YOU may know the crossed-hands illusion. Hold your arms out in front of you and
&gt; cross them over, rotate your hands so your palms face each other, then mesh your
&gt; fingers together. Now slowly rotate your hands up between your arms so you're
&gt; staring at your knuckles. Ask someone to point to one of your index fingers,
&gt; then attempt to move it. Did you move the wrong one?

&gt; If so, you've just experienced a minor failure of your body schema - your mental
&gt; representation of the location, position and boundaries of your body. Your brain
&gt; builds this up by drawing on data from vision, touch and a body-wide network of
&gt; proprioceptive sensors that monitor position. Your body schema is a critical
&gt; part of self-awareness, which is why it feels so odd when it goes wrong.

&gt; In the crossed-hands illusion, the schema fails because of a confusing visual
&gt; input. You don't normally see your hands in this convoluted position; the finger
&gt; you move is the one that is pointing in the direction that the correct one would
&gt; be pointing if you had simply clasped your hands as if in prayer.

&gt; An even odder way of disturbing your body schema is an illusion that taps
&gt; straight into your sense of body ownership. Known as the rubber-hand illusion,
&gt; it fools you into thinking a rubber hand - or even a piece of wood, or a table -
&gt; is part of your body.

&gt; To experience the illusion, get hold of a model hand (it doesn't have to be very
&gt; realistic) and put it on the table in front of you. If it is a left hand, put
&gt; your actual left hand somewhere you can't see it, in the same pose as the rubber
&gt; hand. Now get someone to touch and stroke your unseen hand and the rubber hand
&gt; with identical movements. If you concentrate on the rubber hand, you will
&gt; probably get the uncanny feeling that it is your own. (See a video of the rubber
&gt; hand illusion here)

&gt; What this illusion shows is that your sense of body

Long time, deep.

Also, we need some particular adjectives
