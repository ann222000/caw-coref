Hello all,I'm interested to know your thoughts on what screen size you're designing for if producing a fixed width site. I know all the benefits of a fluid site but in this instance I'm working on fixed width ecommerce site and was wondering whether you're still designing for 800x600 or whether you've increased to 1024? The stats show that screen size is growing rapdily but with 10% of users still on 800x600 resolution are we safest to optimise the site for the minimum?Thanks!Sarah

Hello all,

I'm interested to know your thoughts on what screen size you're designing
for if producing a fixed width site. I know all the benefits of a fluid site
but in this instance I'm working on fixed width ecommerce site and was
wondering whether you're still designing for 800x600 or whether you've
increased to 1024? The stats show that screen size is growing rapdily but
with 10% of users still on 800x600 resolution are we safest to optimise the
site for the minimum?

Thanks!
Sarah

Hi Sarah,

Global stats are a useful general indicator, but personally I'd say
there's no substitute for looking at what your *own* site user base
are doing before you make the decision as to what resolution to
optimise for.

The sites I manage at the moment cater for a highly technical base,
the majority of whom are actually using 1280x1024 or above most of the
time - but we still designed to 800x600 to cater for the lowest
denominator (I'm not saying I agree with that choice, it was made
before I started...).

Cheers,

Rachael

I'll generally design for 1024, but with the proviso that the site isn't
rendered completely unusable at 800x600 - so things might be a little
cramped at lower resolutions, but it is still possible to find what you're
looking for.

I also advocate resolution-dependent layouts (if you can't manage
fluid/elastic):

We mostly design for 1024 wide (screen resolution) these days. Generally
speaking I think you're safe with this now, though it is advisable to check
your own screen resolution stats.

Another issue is the actual window size (as opposed to the screen
resolution) since many users don't view websites with their browser
full-screen. We had one project recently who wanted both 800x600 and
1024x768 (since many of their users viewed the site in a smaller window) so
we developed the site so it stretched between the two. See

I generally go for 970 min-width, then any max-width depending on the
application.

My opinion is that in 800x600 (or a resized window), users are aware
they need to scroll, so your site won't make a difference.  Bit
blinkered admittedly, but I use a few different resolutions myself
(extended desktop, 1440x900, 800x600 remote desktop and also Mini
Opera 4 on my K800i) and all seem pretty usable.

I often use a cord layout instead of fixing myself to a screen res.
Try looking at http://www.md-drivingschool.co.uk to see what I mean.
Try resizing the window and changing text size. Basically it has a min
width of something like 400px, a max width of 100% (in other words the
screen width) and a default width defined in ems at a width the client
is happy with. Normally this default width is either the equivalent of
between 770px or 950px.

Mina and max width dont work in IE6 and earlier, so they just see a
fixed width page that scales up and down with text size. Poor them.
Everyone else sees a site that neatly fits into their window
regardless of how big or small their window is - this is because max
width kicks in to avoid horizontal scrolling.

Ok, I admit this layout type is kind of fluid because at smaller
screen sizes it does become fluid!

I completely agree with Simon on window size. I think having higher
resolutions means having windows take up the whole screen is such a waste of
real estate. Especially if you're doing multiple things. With that in mind
800x600 probably gets used more than we may realise even if most new PCs are
sold with a default resolution higher than that.

I'd also agree with 1024. That's what I like to aim for and approximately
the size of my browsing window since there are a lot of sites that still
work around that size. It's a nice bonus that I'm left with a decent size of
desktop left beside the browser too.
