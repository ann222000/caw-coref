Kevin
I turned my paperwork into the local Social Security Office yesterday,
so guess what?  It looks like you're going to have another mouth to
feed,  as a faithful "check daddy",  congratulations!
Starting in March,  you'll not only have to be "kicking down" for my
fellow "Socialist" bill horne,  but "yours truly" too!  Isn't that cool!
I'm really excited,  thinking about all the ways I'll have to spend
this "money from nowhere"!  I already started yesterday,  by purchasing
two new pair of jeans to celebrate the occasion,  and that's only the
beginning!
Today,  I'm buying new strings for all my guitars,  and tomorrow, I
think I'll pick up some nice flowers for my sweetheart!  Anyone who
doesn't believe in romance on Valentine's Day,  can't be no friend of
mine  -  If you know what I mean  -  And,  I think you do!
I sure hope you're not entertaining any foolish notions about retiring
yourself,  because bill,  and I,  are counting on you, as a continuing
source of our "fun money"!
It ought to be plenty of reward,  just knowing that bill,  and I,
will go out to our mailboxes each month,  look inside,  smile,  and say,
"God bless those working class heroes,  like Kevin,  and his ilk!  Is
this a great country,  or what?"
Thanx,  for all you do Kevin!
Sincerely

Don "the Mooch" Lampson

Sigh.  What a revoltin' predicament!

I've tried and tried, but I just can't get Kevin interested in
supporting me.  He's immune to my charms.  And he seemed like
such a nice mark...er... guy.

I've thought about maybe placing an addy for a new checkdaddy,
but as a former working man with a tenuous hold a traditional
"defined benefit" pension, I'm nervous about drawing attention to
myself.

I feel a bit like a passenger pigeon.  If there were any left.

Don't rock the boat, Don.  We're all in this together.

Well, as it so happens, I'm younger than Kevin and can provide many more
years of happy payments. I'd be happy to be your official Dollar Daddy
as long as you abide by a few rules..
1) None of this calling me Check Daddy..  You may call me your Social
Security Dollar Daddy or just Dollar Daddy for short. Who get's paid by
check these days?  Checks are a thing of the past. Checks can bounce.
2) No voting for Republicans any more or at least just don't tell me
about it or if you do then don't say "neener neener" when you do.
3) No whining that your check is not enough.  I'll have none of that. If
you do, I'll cut you off. (but maybe help get you more if you really
need it).
4) You have to subsidize your free money by continuing picking and
singing for pleasure.

If you can't live by that, forget it!!!

There is no way you will be a Check Daddy, because nobody retiring now
will ever get a check for social security. They have to have an
account of some kind that will take electronic transfers for the IRS.

My work place requires that too. They simply will not write you a check

Ahem... Robert, you do realize that only myself, Bob Giddings, and
sometimes Kevin Miller have poetic license to post doggerel on this
board?

However to get around all the red tape, I applied for a license on
your behalf and it was issued yesterday evening. I did have
considerable trouble because they demurred at including old jokes
about flying cows and, more specifically, they were concerned that a
grown man would use words like 'doo-doo'. I pleaded your case and
explained that you were somewhat new to the craft and they relented.

Your license should be in the mail.

It's just you newcomers need a license -- I don't.  I'm grandfathered in,

You _do_ know the penalties for perjury don't you?

I _carefully_ distinguish between my own original work and that which
is the work of another artist.

I call your attention to the paired fly-specks, before-and-aft, on the
material above.  That is an unambiguous indicator of "someone else's"
work. When I _quote_ somebody else, I do it *accurately*, in -their-
vocabulary and age-level.  Given that that rhyme *is* older than I am,
I wouldn't dare touch a word of it. :)

Your license may be in jeopardy.

For failing to recognize _high-grade_ art when you encounter it.

You called it 'doggerel', when in fact it was udderly sublime..
It was either one thing or an udder -- and that's no bull.
If I was going to milk this for all it was worth, I'd note that
it won the no bull prize.  "And that's the truth." -- no sh*t!

OK, you got me on this one. What is (or was) a VM forum? I didn't know

&gt;&gt; Well, as it so happens, I'm younger than Kevin and can provide many
&gt;&gt; more years of happy payments. I'd be happy to be your official Dollar
&gt;&gt; Daddy as long as you abide by a few rules..
&gt;&gt; 1) None of this calling me Check Daddy..  You may call me your Social
&gt;&gt; Security Dollar Daddy or just Dollar Daddy for short. Who get's paid
&gt;&gt; by check these days?  Checks are a thing of the past. Checks can
&gt;&gt; bounce.
&gt;&gt; 2) No voting for Republicans any more or at least just don't tell me
&gt;&gt; about it or if you do then don't say &quot;neener neener&quot; when you do.
&gt;&gt; 3) No whining that your check is not enough.  I'll have none of that.
&gt;&gt; If you do, I'll cut you off. (but maybe help get you more if you
&gt;&gt; really need it).
&gt;&gt; 4) You have to subsidize your free money by continuing picking and
&gt;&gt; singing for pleasure.

&gt;&gt; If you can't live by that, forget it!!!

&gt;&gt; Ben

&gt; Dear Sir,
&gt; Except for the picking and singing I can live by the standards you
&gt; have set forth.
&gt; Please forward my Cash Card.

&gt; I remain obediently yours,

&gt; Max

Done..  Just paid today as a matter of fact..  From my account to
yours..  :-)

My condolences.  &lt;grin&gt;

I predate bulletin-board systems,too.

I go back to the DOS age on IBM machines.  Not PCs, but mainframes. No,
I don't mean /VSE either,  But the successor to TOS (for those who
didn't have a disk pack).  This was some 15 years before I got a USENET
connection.

I know the guy that ran the first BBS in the world.  He had running
problems with the phone company as his 'hobby' grew  -- they couldn't believe
that he needed that many 'residence' lines at his house, and kept trying to
insist that he had to pay 'business-line' rates.  The issue went up to the
State utilities commission more than once.

Al, they were private mainframe networks (in my case inside IBM) where
each user had a 'Virtual Machine' controlled by a central (CP) control
program. Very early in the development of VM, we were already
participating in internal forums ranging from the technical to 'water
cooler' discussions about words, etc.

A historical note. Some years before MIT or Apple supposedly
'invented' desktop icons, David Graham and I created a virtual desktop
for an internal application that was operated by a light pen (remember
those?) and included a garbage bin and mailbox. The graphics were
created plotted co-ordinates using a scanner attached to the light pen
port. Nobody liked or understood the concept and it was eventually
replaced by a more conventional menu driven application.

Interesting. I know about IBM VM, of course (they may have invented
the acronym.) My mainframe experience is limited to 360/370s running
DOS and later OS, then CP-67, which I think turned into VM. CP-67
could have been used for inter-user forums, but such things were
discouraged at that time and place.

Wait - I take that back. For a time, we rented time on a commercial
time-sharing system which ran VS. It was kind of neat - when you
logged in, you were at the console of a bare 360. Default behavior was
to IPL into OS, but theoretically you could do anything.

That's a familiar name, but I can't quite place it. Did he write a
book that I used to own? Compilers, maybe?

Yep. Wrote an MS-DOS driver for one once. Interesting gadgets, but it
seemed people liked them only for the first ten minutes of use. The
concept was elegant, though.

Yes... CP-67 was a precursor to CP-370 and VM-CP which was the
original VM operating system hypervisor.

If he did, I haven't heard of it - although I lost track of him after
he left IBM for, I think, one of the telephone companies like Bell
Canada.
