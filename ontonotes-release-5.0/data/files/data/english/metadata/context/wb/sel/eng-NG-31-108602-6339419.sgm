Well, since Kathy is posting you can tell that we are home.  This was
the trip of  lifetime. I have been many places but this was one of the
most beautiful.  The color of the water and flying over the islands in
a little plane was unbelievable.  For some getting on the small planes
would be enough to keep them away from this experience, but not me.
Kathy's house is beautiful and she is a most gracious hostess.  So
gracious, she made me cook every meal for the first two weeks to earn
my keep.  Just kidding, she didn't make me, I offered and was always
trying to come up with something that everyone would enjoy so that I
would get a good grade on my report card.

I did wake everyone up several nights talking (or some may say
screaming) in my sleep. I guess I was so relaxed that I let my guard
down in sleep and my unconscious mind took over.

I did get grounded, as per the crocodile story.  I did stay up too
late.  I did go skinny dipping.  I did bring too much stuff home.  I
had to pay for a third suitcase and take one of Kathy's that she was
going to discard.  I bought present for people, but then she took me
to the really good present place and so I had to buy more presents.
And then I wasn't sure if I had enough presents, so I had to buy even
more presents. Kathy went into a store to order a coffee table out of
belizean hard woods. Well I wasn't to be outdone so I ordered two
small and two medium round tables.  I bought the two small first and
we figured that I could get them home. Then they were so beautiful
that I kept dreaming about them until I had myself convinced that I
could bring two more medium size ones home.  It is a wonder that I got
out of the country.

Ambergris Caye is a very unusual island, as are the belizean people.
Everyone is friendly. No one ever says no.  I am sure they just don't
do what you ask, but they never tell you no it isn't possible.  They
are laid back and I doubt any get treated for ulcers.  They do have a
big diabetes problem because of sugar and carb consumption.  As in
Mexico, there are women and men selling their wares on the beach.  The
price was never the same.  Some things I got good deals on and some I
paid more than I should have.  I have no regrets even though I will
probably never live down the fact that I purchased more than anyone
that has ever down with Kathy.

Her friends are lovely and made me (the new girl) feel welcome. I have
left my 50' cable and keyboard in Kathy's owner closet.  I have to go
back to get it, and when I go back I am halfway there with what I need
to work.  It is still hard to believe that Kathy and I were connected
to our home computers and yet a couple of thousand miles away on an
island with one paved street, if you want to call it paved, where the
one lane runway makes you think about some of these war movies where
they put down planes in the middle of a desert, and where there are
only sand floors in all the restaurants.

I hope Kathy would say the same thing, but I could have spend another
three weeks with her.  We had so much fun just laughing about foolish
things.  I was physically tired, but emotionally renewed.  It was like
being at a pajama party every single day and yet there was no
competition and all of the women had great comradery for all the women
present.  I would tell all of you to make nice-nice with Kathy, but I
want to make sure that my bedroom doesn't have someone else's name
painted above the door.  I think that I have guaranteed another
invite, so that secret I won't be sharing.

I absolutely would love to go. Kathy, if you would email me at
V ... @aol.com, I would really love to talk about it.

Janice it sounds sooooo very lovely.  I saw the show on TV and that was
enough to get me interested.  The puddle jumper planes are not my favorite,
but I can deal with it.

Two other things I just remembered that I wanted to mention.  Kim and
I took the golf cart back into town after our grounding ended to meet
Kathy. Kathy took the ferry because she was not about to get on the
back of the golf cart with us again.  So we are going lickity split
because we wanted to make sure that we were there to meet her.  We
were behind a couple of vans and a police officer kept telling Kim to
get closer to the side of the road.  Finally we realized why, it was a
funeral. This beautiful casket (I am guessing mahogany because that is
one of their woods) was being carried on the shoulders of six young
men.  The streets were filled with the grieving. It is what I would
guess it would look like in New Orleans only without music. It was
terribly hot and humid that day, but on they walked carrying the
departed through the streets to show respect to his former house and
business and then on to the church.  We saw it later in the day when
they were taking him from the church to the cemetary on the beach.
This time the crowd had doubled and they were also carrying big
funeral wreaths and icons, being led by the priest and altar boys.  I
would have loved to have taken some pictures, but I just felt that it
was disrespectful as a tourist to intrude.

The other thing that affected me was seeing a family say goodbye for
the husband in his fatigues going back to Iraq.  Kathy's plane took
off an hour before mine and so after leaving her and Kim I walked down
to my gate.  There was a young beautiful blonde mother, two children,
I guess about 5 and 11.  The youngest was playing with a truck and the
father was sitting with his arm around his wife. Then his boarding was
called and he stood in his fatigues with all his gear and started
saying his goodbyes.  First he put his arms around the little boy,
almost encasing him in a hug. The little boy said, but daddy why do
you have to go.  The dad was whispering something in his year.  Then
the little one went back to playing with his truck as the dad was
hugging the older boy.  The boy was crying and you could see tears
running down the face of the mother as she tried to wipe them away.  I
tried not to look and the woman sitting next to me said, "isn't it
hard to watch."  It was.  Then he kissed his wife and she bucked up
trying not to cry and holding on to her older son who was still
shaking and crying.  So sad. Then he broke away and walked on to his
plane.  I will be praying every single night for this family that the
father is home soon.

Wow, Janice.  That takes me back to my airport trips with DH during Viet
Nam.  I too will pray for this family.  How sad.  I don't think I would have
been able to keep a dry eye watching that!  Bless that family and those dear
children.

One of my employees just sent her son off to boot camp today.  She
said her goodbyes to him last night, and he had to be in the hotel
with the other recruits tonight, and leave this morning.  He called
her at work to say he was leaving.  How she got through that call
without crying was beyond me, because the other 3 and I were all doing
it for her.  She said she cried all the way home (a 2-hour drive), and
her cousin had called and talked to her on the cell the entire way
home, and then called her at home after she got to the house to try to
distract her some.  I asked her if she gave him the Forrest Gump talk,
and she laughed, and said "several times".

You came back? Are you nuts??

Since I'm geographically challenged, I have to ask a totally unrelated
question--- How far are you from San Francisco?

I think I shall plan a PJ party at Kathy's house (hehehe) for my next
graduation.... I'd do it for my 50th birthday but I don't think I can afford
it by then.... it's only 7 months away...

I wanna be Kathy when I grow up.

&gt; Well, since Kathy is posting you can tell that we are home.  This was
&gt; the trip of  lifetime. I have been many places but this was one of the
&gt; most beautiful.  The color of the water and flying over the islands in
&gt; a little plane was unbelievable.  For some getting on the small planes
&gt; would be enough to keep them away from this experience, but not me.
&gt; Kathy's house is beautiful and she is a most gracious hostess.  So
&gt; gracious, she made me cook every meal for the first two weeks to earn
&gt; my keep.  Just kidding, she didn't make me, I offered and was always
&gt; trying to come up with something that everyone would enjoy so that I
&gt; would get a good grade on my report card.

&gt; I did wake everyone up several nights talking (or some may say
&gt; screaming) in my sleep. I guess I was so relaxed that I let my guard
&gt; down in sleep and my unconscious mind took over.

&gt; I did get grounded, as per the crocodile story.  I did stay up too
&gt; late.  I did go skinny dipping.  I did bring too much stuff home.  I
&gt; had to pay for a third suitcase and take one of Kathy's that she was
&gt; going to discard.  I bought present for people, but then she took me
&gt; to the really good present place and so I had to buy more presents.
&gt; And then I wasn't sure if I had enough presents, so I had to buy even
&gt; more presents. Kathy went into a store to order a coffee table out of
&gt; belizean hard woods. Well I wasn't to be outdone so I ordered two
&gt; small and two medium round tables.  I bought the two small first and
&gt; we figured that I could get them home. Then they were so beautiful
&gt; that I kept dreaming about them until I had myself convinced that I
&gt; could bring two more medium size ones home.  It is a wonder that I got
&gt; out of the country.

&gt; Ambergris Caye is a very unusual island, as are the belizean people.
&gt; Everyone is friendly. No one ever says no.  I am sure they just don't
&gt; do what you ask, but they never tell you no it isn't possible.  They
&gt; are laid back and I doubt any get treated for ulcers.  They do have a
&gt; big diabetes problem because of sugar and carb consumption.  As in
&gt; Mexico, there are women and men selling their wares on the beach.  The
&gt; price was never the same.  Some things I got good deals on and some I
&gt; paid more than I should have.  I have no regrets even though I will
&gt; probably never live down the fact that I purchased more than anyone
&gt; that has ever down with Kathy.

&gt; Her friends are lovely and made me (the new girl) feel welcome. I have
&gt; left my 50' cable and keyboard in Kathy's owner closet.  I have to go
&gt; back to get it, and when I go back I am halfway there with what I need
&gt; to work.  It is still hard to believe that Kathy and I were connected
&gt; to our home computers and yet a couple of thousand miles away on an
&gt; island with one paved street, if you want to call it paved, where the
&gt; one lane runway makes you think about some of these war movies where
&gt; they put down planes in the middle of a desert, and where there are
&gt; only sand floors in all the restaurants.

&gt; I hope Kathy would say the same thing, but I could have spend another
&gt; three weeks with her.  We had so much fun just laughing about foolish
&gt; things.  I was physically tired, but emotionally renewed.  It was like

We only ate lunch out and made dinner every night at the villa.

Powder buns.  I don't know how they are made, but very good.  Kathy
had the recipe.

Beans and rice - Instead of black beans like the Cubans made, this is
made with pinto beans and the color of the rice is tinged with the
color of the pinto beans.  Very good.  Rice not packed with pinto
beans, mainly an accent.

Cole slaw - Most places served this with their lunches.  Not anything
like KFC.  Most had raisins and a sweet taste. Very good.

Shrimp - I am not sure if this was Belizean or from Chile.  We put
shrimp in many of the dishes.

Burritos - We had burritos several times with barbecue chicken and
every very good.  So good in fact we ran and ordered them to go to sit
on the tarmack to eat on our way out of the country.

Lobster - We had grilled lobster one night and very tasty.

But the best was the ice cream.  We had coconut, papaya or was it
mango, key lime, pistachio flavors and it was very creamy, definitely
premium and very good.

Beer - One man has the license so that only Beliken beer can be served
on the island. I don't drink beer so I can't tell you if it is any
good, but should you go to Belize make sure you don't order the
Beliken Premium because one women got deathly ill.

Kathy made a chicken enchilada dish that you folks should ask for the
recipe because it was excellent.  She made all the rice and she is
obviously skilled at this as well.

We didn't go hungry for sure.  One of the last night we had smoked
chicken that we all liked, so I think we will probably put an order in
for some of the smoked chicken for next visit.

Thanks for the food report!

I was gonna snip it in my reply, but it sounded so tasty I thought I would
repost the whole thing.

Well, I did snip the beer part, but I don't drink, so I won't be gettin'
sick on the local brew:).

Did you know what Cubans popularly call their black beans and rice?  "Moros
y Cristianos"  which translates into blacks (Moors) and Christians.  It's in
no sense meant in a derogatory way to either blacks or Christians, but just
one of many colorful Cuban colloquialisms.

The shrimp are from shrimp farms in Belize. Very big controversy over this
as I guess their "poop" has a very bad effect on the reef. Most Belizeans
want to protect their reef, but some only care about the dollar - hell with
the ecosystem.

Many tourists complain about the turtle grass that grows in the shallow
water near shore (makes for a gunky walk in the sea), and some resorts clear
the grass to please the gringo. We do not clear the grass because that is
where the little fishies, sea horses, etc. become big fishies, sea horses,
etc. It's all part of the ecosystem. No little fish = no big fish in a few
years.

It occurred to me later that wares were really probably wares and it
wouldn't really be funny unless your mind was in the gutter. lol. (I
obviously missed any discussions on ware selling in Mexico!) Sorry if
I offended!

Yep... it was really wares... jewelry, wooden carvings.

We didn't see anyone selling "other" wares, but then I didn't keep track of
Janice 24/7.  ;)

Well I did see a couple of speedos on people who shouldn't really wear
them, but no one selling their wares.

Some of the wares I saw, purchased and brought home, were four
belizean wood tables.  Need I say more.

Janice and Kathy,

It sounds like you had a wonderful relaxing break from the rat race.
The croc story was hilarious.  And thanks a bunch for posting those
recipes, Kathy!
