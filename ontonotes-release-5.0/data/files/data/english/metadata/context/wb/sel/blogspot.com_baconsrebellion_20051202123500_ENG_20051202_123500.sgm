Jim, over at Road to Ruin you have a post on Speaker Howell's recent
comments regarding transportation. The Speaker agrees that we can't pave
our way out of the transportation mess and any response must include
mass transit and "initiatives such as telecommuting."

I'm not sure what a telecommuting initiative would look like. One
would think that if it were such a great idea, lots more people would be
working from home and businesses would be encouraging it. Of course,
maybe they are, but if so, a lot of them are working from cell phones in
their car instead of from the comforts of home with their vehicle off
the road. "Non-rush hour traffic" is an oxymoron.

If I was asked to design a telecommuting initative, I would start
with state government. If state officials think telecommuting is a
solution, they ought to lead the way.

In my agency, I count 19 of 41 employees based in Richmond who could
easily work from home. That's almost half--and more could if a few
assumptions were changed. All of these employees have offices/cubicles
of significant total size. Get them working from home and my agency
could move to much smaller (hence cheaper) office space in addition to
the hoped for reduction in traffic miles. I'm sure my agency is not
unique. Spread this across the 100 or so state agencies and there could
be significant savings. I'm told there are few impediments to switching
phone lines to home phone numbers. Many of the staffers in my agency who
could work from home already have state issued laptops. Employees could
use their home computers or take the one they have in their state
office.

What might be added to a telecommuting initiative such as I'm
describing might be a voluntary commitment to reducing miles driven and
commitments by the agency to hold required meetings at times that would
keep employees off major commuting routes during off-peak hours. If the
state demonstrated a commitment to telecommuting, maybe private business
would follow.

I can anticipate a lot of the objections to my version of a
telecommuting initiative. Of course, if someone had the will to make it
happen, those objections could be overcome.

What is the status of video conferencing in state government these
days? Four years ago in my old agency some were starting to use it for
court hearings on prisoner lawsuits, and some other things, but it was
barely crawling along. But when it worked it saved staff from hundreds
of miles and many hours of travel. We didn't have the technology in
house but had to go to another location. The cost of equipment and
connections internally was a hassle, and now with IT being centralized -
can agencies do it themselves at all?

My experience encouraging telecommuning that the problem with
telecommuting is managers who are convinced that if the employees are
not chained to a desk at the office they will be spending all their time
goofing off, shopping on line, playing with the cat or blogging.

Where the hell did they get that idea? Oops. There goes the phone.

I know Jim has written about the use of teleconferencing by VDOT; I'm
not sure how many other agencies use it. For offices with the majority
of employees in one area, such as Richmond, a simple chat program could
suffice for most group meetings.

You are exactly right about the problem--managers wanting a staff at
their beck and call. It doesn't matter that they're not really squeezing
that much productivity out of those supposedly "chained" to the desk in
the office--call a state office on Friday afternoon, or count the smoke
breaks outside a state office. If one assumes the employee will use at
least a portion of their former commuting time working in their pajamas
at home but goof off at the same rate, the state still should come out
ahead.

God forbid that we would actually ask managers to... manage!

Let's not forget also that if even close to half of commuters could
work at home as you suggest, where would be the need for after school
child care, or what about Tim Kaine's government pre-school initiative??
All those potential government programs would lose out, we can't have
that can we? Telecommute? Never!

I work from home and travel a lot when I have go to meetings or work
in more intense phases of projects. Mother Corporation saves thousands
in overhead by not having real office space for me. I spend hours on
telcons looking at the same slides on computers as others around the
country. I've worked on my own like this for years. Productivity goes up
tremendously because all the human interaction around the coffee room,
which is good for man as a social animal, doesn't happen and demand
time. Work is work and I do my 80 hours every two weeks or more.

The way it could work as a policy idea is to calculate a person
commute day = $x. It may be pennies or dollars, I dunno. But, let
corporations reduce their corporate taxes by x person commute days times
the number of person-days telecommuting. It would not be an onerous
burden of record keeping for corporations using time cards today.

There will always be a management trade off on when you can do
business virtual and when actual. Better managers will find the right
balance and save the corporations money. Create a carrot.

We have many employees in our agency that could work from home too.
We've asked to do it but it's the same in our office as some have
already mentioned. Supervisors wouldn't be able to walk by our door on
the hour and see that we are still pounding away at the keyboard.
Sometimes I feel like I'm at a daycare center! If my work is done well
and on schedule, it shouldn't matter where I'm physically located or
what time of the day (or night) I get it done.

Regrettably, there are some that would take advantage of the
situation if allowed so managers will have to learn to measure work more
effectively. Then again, these are the same people that are slacking
right in front of the manager's eyes so maybe it would force these folks
to actually do something measurable.

A note on the smokers comment... I smoke (egads!). I know, I know...
it's not a popular habit, calm down... Save the sermons! I won't smoke
around you! But don't assume a loss of work just beacuse someone
smokes... I work at home at night, both times I was sick, on vacation,
on weekends, etc. No, I don't get overtime! So don't assume just because
you see someone taking a few minutes to smoke a cigarette that they are
not putting in their dues! Check the non-smokers that talk on the phone
all day, do their personal business on state time, sleep, or just plain
do nothing and I bet you find the real abuse. Smokers know they are
watched more carefully because of our "sinful" habit so we are more
careful not to waste time lollygagging about.

Anyway, if we could work from home, we wouldn't have to leave the
desk to smoke now would we??? Another great reason to let us work from
home!

Telecommuting is not a popular option among the management at my
agency. In fact, when I inquired about whether or not we had an official
policy on it (who can, who can't, and under what circumstances), I was
met with blank stares. Not surprising, somehow.

A cursory look at the DHRM website brings up DHRM Policy 1.61 (PDF).

Unfortunately, my agency doesn't have any sort of formal work
agreement in place, so I may have to try to spearhead something... given
the glacial pace of state governement, I may be close to retirement by
the time anything chances (clarification: I'm no where near retirement
age).

Anon 9:52, although it sounded like it, I was not singling out
smokers. I know people who take "smoke breaks" but don't even smoke ...
and non-smokers who go with smokers just to chat. Everybody takes breaks
at any work location, state or otherwise, and some take more than
others, state and otherwise. If you worked from home, you might smoke in
front of your computer, perhaps increasing your productivity.

The point is that if you work from home with measureable standards,
breaks and all the rest don't become an object of water cooler
discussions.

Yeah, Will, but now this has become my water cooler.

The DHRM policy linked above is illuminating and points out that a
work from home program does raise issues of who provides the equipment,
how it is serviced, OSHA workplace safety standards, liability issues
(if a Fed Ex delivery woman slips and falls on your doorstep delivering
work related material, is your employer liable?) None of these is
impossible to overcome.

Then there is the model I would push if I were back in a management
position which is more flextime. Even if people spent one day every two
weeks working from their home computer, in a place like Northern
Virginia it might have a measurable impact. What about those days when
you are waiting on a plumber.

But a key point that got all this started -- if we doubled or even
tripled the examples of this, would it solve our transportation problem?
No. Will we get to the place where we are all wired in at home?
Actually, I hope not.

I strongly support telecommuting, and I did so for four years. Now I
travel a lot, so I still do much of my work away from the office.
Somehow, that form of telecommuting doesn't strike me as doing much for
our transportation problems.

Anonymous 9:27 is right, we can do a lot more, but we shouldn't
expect too much. Entire sectors of the economy are not conducive:
construction, retail, services, delivery, military, events, etc etc.

In response to Anonymous 9:27 and Ray Hyde, Even the most zealous
promoters of telecommuting don't see it as a cure-all. As with most
proffered "solutions" to our transportation crisis, telecommuting will
apply only to a select percentage of the population. There is no silver
bullet . But, of all the potential solutions out there, it's a pretty
big one -- second, in my judgment, only to land use reform. I think that
we will see more and more "distributed work" (as opposed to
telecommuting, or working only at home) as (a) the technology matures,
(b) the changing nature of work makes it less and less essential for
people to congregate in a central workplace, and (c) managerial
philosophies catch up with

the first two.

There are no silver bullets, and I think telecommuting is one of our
most promising options.

However, the first thing is we are going to have to pave over thirty
years of anti-road objections to fix our current problems. If new
telecommuting technology saves us 15% then we only have to pave over 25
years worth of anti-road sentiment.

Then, after we solve our current problems we can start making long
term land use decisions to make sure this doesn't happen again. In fact,
considering the probable time frame and low likliehood of land use
policy having any effect we might as well start now. By the time we
catch up on our current problems it might save another couple of per
cent.

A couple per cent of a billion a year is real money.

Problem is, it is probably going to cost you that much in lawsuits. <
