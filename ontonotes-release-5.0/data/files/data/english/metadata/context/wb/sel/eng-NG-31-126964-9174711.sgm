These guys (used in a non-gender specific mode) on this show are all
morons. They have an abundance of bamboo to use and they can't build a
decent shelter after eight days!

When they &quot;lit up&quot; when Jeff told them the reward challenge included a
tarp I wanted to crawl through my TV and smack each one of them upside
the head!

It's easy, you take individual stalks bamboo and split them down the
center then lay them out overlapping in altering orientations. That way
the water hits the top of the down-turned stalks, rolls down into the
up-turned stalks and then runs down the roof and off the back. It's the
same thing as a spanish tile roof.

I've suggested that exact same idea for years but figured maybe splitting
bamboo down the middle isn't all that easy. It would be pretty pathetic if
it is easy and nobody has thought of that yet. Even if it's not, some sort
of weave job using either palm fronds or even the flattened bamboo would
provide extra protection from rain, both on top and on the sides.

They might have been thinking about that tarp as a blanket rather than a
roof.  Split bamboo isn't all that good for a blanket,  but the tarp would
most definitely cut heat loss at night.  Being cold seems to be their main
complaint.

But it is easy, that's the point. Bamboo is one of nature's easiest to
work with and most versatile building materials. One of the tribes even
has split bamboo on their shelter, but they only made one row so it's
not water tight!

Remember, bamboo isn't a tree, it's not wood. It's grass.

Using bamboo for the roof and woven palm fronds for the walls (to keep
the wind out) and you've got yourself a decent little shelter that
shouldn't take more than a few hours to construct. The fact that they
don't have a decent shelter after eight days is pathetic.

We'll have to wait until next week to see (I didn't notice on this

Red Tribe actually has a very nice and well located shelter and this is
probably because James read up on survival skills before the game.

Yellow Tribe's shelter on the other hand, is probably the worst I've

Split bamboo makes a great roof which keeps the rain out and keeps you
dry which goes a lot further to keeping you warm than a blanket.

This only works if the inside of bamboo was smoothly hollow.  Bamboo is in
sections, splitting the bamboo in half will get you something that only
looks like a gutter from the outside.  On the inside, its blocked off by an
internal wall about every foot.  You'd have to trim down these internal
walls before you can use them in the way you're suggesting.  That's probably
more work or time than they can spend what with having to do challenges
every other day.  Or they probably don't have the proper tools to carve out
superhard bamboo innards.

Red Tribe has a decent lean-to, but a lean-to is something you build if
you're only going to be in a location for one night. After eight days I
expect them to have a better shelter than that.

Yes it is.  Pound for pound, you wouldn't be able to find much in the

fibery, but the section walls are harder than most wood.  if you've ever

At one point in the last episode someone laid down on the shelter floor and
every floorboard seemed to bounce into the air on the other end of the
shelter.  Clearly, the shelter is not of the same priority level as the fire

Not that hard to do ... you are correct though ... in that bamboo is
very hard ... cutting a piece in half lengthwise would indeed be very

rather hard ... but a lot thinner than the walls ... a file would be
the best tool ... but I think they could have figured out how to do it
with a machete ...7 or 8 people having 14 hours a day (10 hours for
sleep and challenges) to do it ...

Yet Zhan Hu (I think that's the right tribe) managed to split a bunch of
bamboo (in the first day or two) to use on the roof of their shelter.
They didn't overlap it (as described above) so presumably they figured
it was easier to split it then to harvest more stalks.

Bamboo isn't hard to cut down, it isn't hard to split. Bamboo is a type
of grass, it isn't a tree!

You are changing terms. I agree that bamboo is very strong, it's not

harder than bamboo, even pine (which is considered a soft wood) is
harder than bamboo.

Splitting bamboo isn't hard at all.  Even a bunch of gwailo with a blunt
machete can accomplish that in the few hours they have in between bitching
each other out and doing challenges.  But that's not what we're trying to
do.  But chipping out the internal walls of half a stalk of bamboo is
seriously hard wood with that same machete.

I don't think you understand what you're talking about when you constantly
say bamboo is a grass.  That's like dismissively saying, &quot;What?  What are
you worried about that shark?  Its just a fish!&quot;  Its in the same
classification as grass, but so what?  You know why they use bamboo for
scaffolding in Hong Kong?  Because its so strong, light and flexible that
you can build that all the way up the side of a modern apartment building.
You can't do that with metal scaffolding.

Yellow tribe (Zhan Hu) has the 'super fire pit' made by Dave.   A fire pit

The red tribe (Fei Long) just has a normal fire pit that boils water and

We didn't see them splitting it themselves but we did see them
harvesting it themselves and the other tribe doesn't have any split
bamboo (their roof is made with whole bamboo poles piled with with
fronds).

Splitting bamboo isn't hard though, you wack the machete into one end,
them you hold onto the machete and wack it and the bamboo pole into the
ground and drive the machete through the pole. It gets a little tougher
at the nodes but since the pole is fresh and still alive you can get
past them. BTW: You wouldn't have to use eight inch diameter stalks, one
or two inch diameter stalks would work just fine.

&gt;&gt; I've suggested that exact same idea for years but figured maybe
&gt;&gt; splitting bamboo down the middle isn't all that easy.

&gt;But it is easy, that's the point. Bamboo is one of nature's easiest to

&gt;has split bamboo on their shelter, but they only made one row so it's
&gt;not water tight!

&gt;Remember, bamboo isn't a tree, it's not wood. It's grass.

&gt;&gt; It would be pretty pathetic if it is easy and nobody has thought of
&gt;&gt; that yet. Even if it's not, some sort of weave job using either palm
&gt;&gt; fronds or even the flattened bamboo would provide extra protection
&gt;&gt; from rain, both on top and on the sides.

&gt;Using bamboo for the roof and woven palm fronds for the walls (to keep

&gt;&gt; This only works if the inside of bamboo was smoothly hollow.  Bamboo is in
&gt;&gt; sections, splitting the bamboo in half will get you something that only
&gt;&gt; looks like a gutter from the outside.  On the inside, its blocked off by an
&gt;&gt; internal wall about every foot.  You'd have to trim down these internal
&gt;&gt; walls before you can use them in the way you're suggesting.

&gt;I forgot to mention that but you're forgetting that it's bamboo, carving
&gt;out the nodes is easy -- they have a machete.

&gt;&gt; That's probably more work or time than they can spend what with
&gt;&gt; having to do challenges every other day.  Or they probably don't have
&gt;&gt; the proper tools to carve out superhard bamboo innards.

&gt;&quot;Superhard bamboo&quot;? Bamboo isn't super hard, bamboo is very fibery and

Also, no one has mentioned that bamboo needs to be cured before it can
be used for serious building.  The curing hardens the bamboo and
increases it's lifespan as a building material.  If you cut down a
stalk of bamboo and don't cure it, it will turn black and starting
rotting within a year.  For the Survivor's purposes, it'll work during
a 39 day period.

I'm trying to recall how strong those nodes were when I cut down a few
stalks.  I'm pretty sure all it took was a knife twisted back and
forth to get through them.  I wonder if just taking a strong stick and
ramming it into a node a few times would be effective?

Absolutely, but I was thinking about their limited tool availability.
While a couple of big strong people are busy harvesting bamboo with the

Yeah, I can't imagine they would be prevented from cutting down the
bamboo they need for a shelter since it will grow back quickly. It's

Yes, I would expect that they got some basic training in shelter building

Side question:

What will keep you dryer and warmer?
A)  a tarp as a 'roof' mounted 5 feet above where you sleep so that any
angular rain still gets you wet and the tarp provides zero heat capture
B) a tarp lying directly on top of you like a blanket so that you don't get
wet at all, you have lots of heat capture, but you also have cold water
hitting just on the other side of the tarp and the noise of the tarp close

It looks like they chose method 'A)', but I remain unconvinced that that is

losing much of their rain protection and all of their heat capture.

The first rule of thumb is that you'll lose more heat to the ground than
to the air, they've built a platform up in the air (which is good) but
then the air will circulate underneath them -- they should have a thick
layer of insulation (i.e. vegetation) underneath them.

The tarp definitely shouldn't be used as a blanket unless they have a
shelter that will keep them dry. A tarp isn't waterproof, it's water
tight but water will still get through it. The tarp should be hung so
that it's at an angle to allow the water to run off, if the water pools
it will start dripping through. If you used it as a blanket the water
would just pool on and around you and you would be cold and wet.

Yellow tribe proved they're inept at shelter building long before they
got the tarp. With the tarp as a roof they should easily be able to
weave a few palm fronds into walls. With all the bamboo they should have
had a nice shelter built long before they got the tarp and they could
have used it as a sun shade or secondary shelter to stay out of the rain
during the day.

The easiest way to hang a tarp: you run a rope* between two trees as
tight as possible. The tarp is hung on this rope from one corner to the
far corner, making triangles hanging down each side. The bottom corners
of the triangles are then pulled out and tied to stakes or something so
that the tarp is at an angle with the corners the lowest point and the
rope the highest point.

* If you have lots of bamboo in the area you can easily use a long piece
of bamboo in place of the rope as a ridge beam.

I think method B would be better, but it has some drawbacks. You have
to keep the tarp over all of your body which might be difficult with a
bunch of people, and some people might get claustrophobic if their
head is under the tarp with so many people around, but that isn't an
issue if the weather is dry.

I'm really surprised they don't do more to make the shelter
comfortable. It doesn't take a lot of effort to build some simple
walls around their shelters using just some leaves. It's not great but
it would help. They could even use the same stuff to make the bed more
comfortable, but they don't seem willing to put in effort in to do
anything that isn't absolutely necessary for survival. (Yes, I know
they are hungry but we've seen many of them come up with strength when
they need it so they have reserves.) It's not like they would have to
do the work more than once.

I would think that simple bordom would cause at least some continued work to
be done on the shelter.  I'll admit that my desire to do any 'extra' work
around camp would likely be spent foraging for food, but you would expect
that the 'home bodies' would want to improve the shelter they sleep in all

one end and explain to Jen Robert that he needed to sleep with James, Aaron,
and Todd for warmth.

&gt; You know why they use bamboo for scaffolding in Hong Kong? Because
&gt; its so strong, light and flexible that you can build that all the

BTW: I was just watching an old episode of The West Wing and in an
exterior shot was the Washington Monument fully scaffolded to its very
top (this was a few years ago while it was being renovated in the late
nineties). Here is a picture of it:

The Washington monument is 555 feet high.

&gt;&gt; My question is why in the hell don't they build these shelters bigger?
&gt;&gt; Would it have been so hard to make it long enough so that situation with

&gt;&gt; forced to sleep like a box full of puppies with people I'd only just
&gt;&gt; met.

&gt;The box of puppies can stay warm at night.  If you sleep with space between
&gt;the bodies, everyone gets cold.  Still, the Jean-Robert problem should not

I agree that the warmth situation requires them to sleep in bunches,
but it is true that they could build a bigger shelter that gives them
room to sleep further apart if they so desire. Say they want to lay
down after one of the challenge sessions during the day time.  If it
were really cold enough that the body warmth were a major issue you
can bet those shelters would have walls up in no time.

I guess it could be laziness that leads the shelters being the size
they are. if the support beams are of a certain length (say the length
of the longest pieces of bamboo they found) then that defines how big
the shelter will be. To build it any larger requires some thought and
work which seems beyond what most of the players want to put into the
shelter.

Just a couple of notes to add to this old thread.

In an interview (which I don't have the URL to, sorry) Sherea mentioned
that her tribe's camp was better than the other camp, partially due to
the fact that they split their bamboo.

On this week's show, we saw a piece of split bamboo with the nodes cut
out.

So I guess that shows that splitting bamboo and cutting the nodes out
isn't as difficult as some people in this thread claimed it is.

If they have a machete, all they have to do is put the blade on the
end and rap it with a sturdy branch.  That should easily split the
bamboo right down the middle.

And that surprises you?  These people can't make a team decision from
day one.  All they want to do is squabble.  Even if someone makes a
good decision, its gets shot down just for the sake of shooting it
down.  Everyone wants to be chief but no one wants to be chief!
