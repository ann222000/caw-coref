New York Times, page, A19, July 30,2007. &quot; A War We Just Might Win&quot; by
Michael E. O'Hanlon and Kenneth M. Pollack.
What is shocking is that the editorial appears in the New York Times. I
almost fell over.

Yep, I saw the article yesterday. And so what...? The dems will in no
uncertain terms define the 'status' as completely unwinnable, even if we
are winning.

Because they can't have but loss, appeasement, surrender and then....
joining the 'community'of 'nations'.

The fact that we'd need 5 yrs to clean out the rats  nest that is Iraq,
that we'd need to accept losing 1000 more of our fighting men and that
the Iraqi muslims will kill about 30,000 more of their own civilians,
and that
we should declare war on those bastards, the mullahs and the hypocrites
in Iraq who play with our sacrifice there,  and stay there and show them
who's tougher, and who's prinicples mean something is completely lost on
the dems, the libs, the appeasers and world society clones.

Like in darfur. Like Cambodia, like Vietnam, they want to surrender.
Those guys are the New Republic guys if I remember correctly. And yeah,
it'd take 5 years to stuff the monkey up the sorry asses of the Iraqi's
but if we wanted to put schools, and libraries, and work, and business's
in place, and freedom and end all sharia law except privately, but not
in governement, then it would be a fight worth pursuing.

And on that note.... Here is the response to a post I made last weekend,
about the movie,'Rescue Dawn' and the review, and the response from the
guy, everyone remembers portrayed in 'Good Morning, Vietnam', Adrian
Cronauer.

From: Adrian Cronauer

Date: Jul 30, 2007 8:28 AM

Subject: Dengler Review

To: writedeb ... @gmail.com

Good (as usual) review of the Dengler film but one, tiny,
nit-picking point if I may: we didn't lose the war in Vietnam, we lost
the peace, if we lost anything. Viewed from one perspective, we
politically gave up what we had already won militarily. Actually, &quot;we&quot;
didn't do so as a country but, rather, the Dems in Congress--to their
everlasting shame--deliberately gave South Viet Nam to the Communists.

When we withdrew our military in 1973, the Viet Cong were still
recovering from the defeat they suffered during the Tet Offensive while
the South Vietnamese military was more than able to defend their
country--but only if they continued to receive equipment, ammunition,
other supplies, and miscellaneous logistical support from the U.S. which
we promised to give them indefinitely. No sooner had our troops returned
home (&quot;victoriously&quot; one could argue) when the liberals (I refuse to use
the false designation of &quot;progressive&quot;) in Congress started to pull the
plug on South Vietnam. They blocked any funds to support the S. VN
military and, hence, it was only a matter of time before the North
Vietnamese Communist troops were able to overrun the South and either
&quot;re-educate&quot; or massacre all those who were loyal to the South or had
anything to do with the Americans.

Would it be too much of a stretch to see what the Dems are doing in
Congress now regarding Iraq as a direct parallel?

Yes, I am THAT Adrian Cronauer and as the patch on my black leather
vest says, &quot;Vietnam--When I Left, We Were Winning.&quot;

Always enjoy your column. And please keep up the good work.

AC

P.S. And, if anyone should question that the Viet Cong were soundly
defeated during the Tet Offensive, any reputable military historian
will confirm that the VC expected Vietnamese peasants to rise up and
join the Communists which, of course, never happened. The VC and North
Vietnamese forces, therefore, were decimated; it took, literally, years
for them to rebuild their strength. This, despite the likes of Walter
Cronkite erroneously, and some would say deliberately, reporting the
exact opposite.

Then you must really fight a real war, no quarter given, and kill a hell of
a lot of people  like in WW II. When a country is rubble it does not mount
an insurgency so well. Too busy trying to feed and clothe itself. And we did
shoot insurgents after the war no questions asked.

You're right- that is the problem.  'We' are not supposed to 'win.'
In our case we could 'win' only if the Iraqi's threw down their bigotry
and all else and ran to us and said, we are free.eeeeee.

They didn't, and we were not allowed to kill the killers, whomever they
were, are.  And worse.... our geniuses decided that in true democratic
fashion, we would of course allow 'sharia' law to be imposed, rather
than insisting that it become a religious series of laws imposed only
personally by choice and or, where it conflicted not with the freedoms
of others to live.

As an example, and this is just the tip of that iceberg... that war in
lebanon, which the muslims, Iran, Hezbollah started, which everyone
like's to say, 'the Israeli's lost'....?

Yes... they 'lost' because, they didn't 'win'...
What does that mean?
It means, for one, the Israeli's have never ever been allowed to 'win'
and so we have unending 'conflicts', and the west, is commited to this
and so, we have unending 'conflicts'

Since we don't allow ourselves, the idea of 'winning' and creating a
better world. We submit to the socialist idea, which is thugocracy self
annointed, as in the Sudan.... and everywhere else.

Just to note; this is from one of the Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon...
with his admission. Note, these were the 'winners' who were allowed to
live by the UN, enforced upon the Israeli's, and by the US, too. And now
we have the next 'war' ready to start.

Mark
-----------

A Hizbullah man interviewed by Israel's Channel 10 TV said that the
terror group was saved by the Olmert government's decision to call a
cease-fire.

&quot;The cease-fire [at the end of the Second Lebanon War] acted as a life
jacket for the organization,&quot; the terrorist said. He explained that the
group would have surrendered if the battles had continued for another 10
days.

He described the condition of Hizbullah's equipment and morale at the
end of the fighting, saying they were running low on food, water, and arms.

....The officer also admitted to firing missiles from inside urban
centers, knowing that it would lead to civilian casualties on the
Lebanese side. He explained that firing from open areas simply was not
feasible, as the IAF quickly targeted  any launchers operating in such
areas.

your dodging is pathetic.  So define it.  If you can.  What is
winning?  Imposing a western style democracy?  Is that it?  What about
if their democracy wants to adopt the Euro and sell all their oil to
France and Russia, and kick out all the US oil companies.    Then
what?  Would we still have won?  Is it peace you are after or genocide
and total domination of their resources?

You did not answer me, but you like to donkey bray, about how
homicidists killing sick children happens in war....

I say, kill the killers. Kill Al-Sadr, and the mosques where they've
attacked and killed and shot at us. Announce that returning the nation
to the Iraqi's with a government that allows the christians to live in
peace, and zoroastrians, and the few jews, and anyone else, whereby
sharia law is no longer governmental, but voluntary for those who wish
to follow it and impress the world as to how fine a citizenry they can
are and can be will be of course allowed.  If they want to be flattened
like nazi germany or japan as in ww II, so be it, but we'd rather return
their nation to them whole,and then leave with some sworn written
documents that these minimal freedoms will be guarenteed, elsewise we
can send as many as they like to the virgins. That we demand minimal
tolerance for others, freedom to live and let live, and that we have
sacrificed 3,700 or so, for these miserable ingrats who had endured
400,000 deaths, and slaughter becauses Islamic and arab culture
represent 1375 yrs of failure.
That history shows not one successful economy or pluralistic muslim arab
society that didn't exist except by the enforced second class
citizenship, or enslavement of others. That this will not be tolerated
with homicidal beliefs of annihilating each other and of course all the
infidels who are treated worse than they treat sick animals in the rest
of the entire world.

That Islam either demonstrate civil behavior rather than lying to
achieve submission of all others or face in Iraq, the destruction that
nazi germany got and deserved in all it's evil splendor. That we didn't
ask to be on the outside watching 400,000 people being raped and
slaughtered and imprisoned but that the culture and religion also
expresses it's desire for the ummah of dominion over all others and with
malice aforethought.

That the 16,750 or so people slaughtered last year by muslims killing
muslims is a barbarity worse than headhunters, and that we do not
believe in the sanctity of allowing such belief systems to threaten us,
nor the judeochristian heritage of the western world, the other parts of
the non-muslim world of which over 30 nations have had to endure
homidicism, threats of homicidism, terrorism, deceit and slaughter from
the culture that underlies the warfare in Iraq.  Otherwise we mean to
live in a friendship that as in Germany status post ww 2 and Japan ww 2
demonstrated how we had to, were forced to endure destroying those evil
states so as to allow the return of normal national status and
independence to those peoples. We want none of that destruction but the
muslims either march millions strong and in friendship demand the chance
to kill their own killers and leaders who have demanded enslavement of
all other infidels in their nations, as well as even sick children in
hospitals who were homicided by a belief system that either admits it's
evil and or insanity or faces an end demanded by it's own self
destructive horror.

Excuse me, asshole... I have a patient walking in, and I've just put
this together without so much as  looking back on what I wrote.

And I hope your mother sticks an ice pick in your sickening heart for
the evil you've expressed for this nation and for the enslavement of
childrend the slaughter of sick children and others, who's welfare means
nothing to a sickening marxist shit like yourself.

Fuck you.

&gt; &gt;A continuing ongoing win that lasts throughout all eternity is not
&gt; &gt;attainable.

&gt; your dodging is pathetic.  So define it.  If you can.  What is
&gt; winning?  Imposing a western style democracy?  Is that it?  What about
&gt; if their democracy wants to adopt the Euro and sell all their oil to
&gt; France and Russia, and kick out all the US oil companies.    Then
&gt; what?  Would we still have won?  Is it peace you are after or genocide
&gt; and total domination of their resources?

&gt; now answer the question, fool.

I am not dodging, I am merely stating the fact that in a conventional
sense, we have already won. The fact that you cry foul when I stick to
a strict definition is your problem not mine.

You tell me your definition of &quot;winning&quot;, but make sure it's not
subjective and can be applied to what was considered a victory in the
past, even the recent past, say ... 100 years ago.

It is hypocritical of you that you try to redefine &quot;winning&quot; by the
new politically correct standards of  the western democracy that you
abhor.

We already won, we killed more of them than they killed of us. We're
sitting on the land that the piece of shit Saddam used to say was his
and we're gonna stay there until we decide to leave. You can go around
in your little circle and sit and spin over and over again and try to
redefine things. I know it gives you a nice warm buzzing feeling,  but
it don't mean squat.

Why is that shocking?  The New York Times was the outfit that sold the

And we could 'leave' if, for instance, we clearly stated that we
killed the killer of 400,000 but now, those who are muslim who slaughter
each other, the christians, the zoroastrians the hindhus and anyone they
decide to destory, for no other reason than dominion, must take
responsibility for their own failed civilization.  We hope that they are
offended, because maybe they might grow what is called a conscience in
the religions of all the rest of the world, and which they evidence so
little in their sorry theology of submission of 'all'

That we are not either conquerers, nor do we share those values that
allow for muslims to slaughter each other and destroy infidels with
theologic 'joy'.

That we abhor their violent submission of each other,and sorrow for
them for their utter failure as human beings to grow out of barbarity of
belief and history, Though we find individuals and peoples capable of
courage and dignity, thought not enough to change any of their culture
to any great extent. Without a culture that demands we be there to
sacrifice our lives so as to bring them a peaceful republic, it is not
in our interest to prevent their deaths by sacrificing our own.

We received nothing for this act, of freeing them from a ruler who
slaughter and tormented so many of them, and others, and without
overwhelming demand to stay, we have no reason too.... that destroying
their nation to protect ours is the mandate of war, but we don't wish to
harm 'innocents' as there are plenty there.

They, those 'innocents' and people who wish to allow others to live in
a measure of freedom, rather than 'submission' must stand up and
declare, 'sharia private ais dead as a public policy.'

It is bigoted, hateful, dictatorial, fascistic, merciless, and we are
not interested in pursuing any sharia laws for any nation that we have
freed from any tyranny.

We dreamed a dream for them, and got nothing in return.

We do not wish to 'submit' Iraqi's, nor Iraq, but to allow them to
live as essentially free peoples in a manner of dignity and choice that
preserves their culture and all other minorities who deserve that same
freedom, would be a dream. A dream of ours, a federal republic, and for
which they have evidenced all too little historical evidence of being to
accept, or create. That is their loss. The savage barbarity of the
mullahs, the imams, the mosques of death that slaughter each other are
and will be their concern.

That we are disgusted by the homicidal muslim violence and homicidal and
dictatorial manner that the culture 'submits' all, is something that is
recorded now, as it has been but unstated for so long. We are fed up
with the homicidal hatreds, the homicidal tyranny's, and we will no
longer allow it to migrate to our lands. We will declare a ten yr
moratorium on all immigration from all Islamic nations. We tend to our
problems, or should, and now the arab league, and the muslim nations can
stand on their own, with their immense oil monies that they have lived
off of, and done next to nothing to improve the lot of their citizens.
Let those peoples of those nations declare their intents and purposes
but as for their hatreds, let that be their legacies on the graves of so
many they have slaughtered in their lands, and for nothing, except,
submission....

That the first rocket bomb that kills any of our soldiers will be
followed by entire towns and cities if needs be,  being erased...

We will not tolerate a nation, that was freed from a dictator who
killed 400,000  by our sacrifices to demean one more soldiers sacrifice,
nor the nation that assisted and sacrificed it's citizens and money's to
save 'all' of Iraq from that murderous reign and treachery.

Etc...

But that precludes that we no longer pretend that it is a few
'extremists' who are pursuing our destruction, but rather that we accept
that it is normative 'Islam' that has been attacking us and 30 other
nations for 1375 yrs, and that we do not accept the demonstratively
tyrannical movement to express itself upon us.... any more.

Something like that.

Anyway- I prefer 'victory'. Kill Al-Sadr, blow up his mosque and any of
them that harbors homicidists... demand the call to equality and justice
and the end of sharia.  And have a nice day....
