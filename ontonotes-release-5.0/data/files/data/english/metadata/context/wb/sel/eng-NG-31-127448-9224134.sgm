Random Drug Testing

Employees are usually tested prior to employment and occasionally are
randomly tested after hiring. Random testing is especially common in
workplaces containing heavy machinery, toxic materials, and other
potential health hazards. Employees are also routinely tested after
being involved in a workplace accident, in order to determine if the
incident was the result of substance abuse.

Yes, absolutely.  That is the most dangerous thing you can do with
your computer.

Oh, come on - lots of reasons.

He might want your computer to join his army of bots, which will be
used to attempt to extort money from a bank.

He might want to set up a hidden storage bin, on which he can store
his child pron pictures safely (for him).

He might simply be wanting to install a fake security program which
will be used to attempt to sell you his &quot;Security Services&quot;. (The pop-
up ads will stop if you pay him - for a while).

If he can gain root/admin access he can use your PC to attempt to
break in to other, more important computers - like FBI, or US military
networks.

He might want to install a trojan which will provide an install or ad
service which he will sell to other unscrupulous companies.

So you see - your paranoia is uncalled-for.

It is a Canadian site.  If you can't trust the Canadians, you might as
well call it quits, eh?  So just bite the bullet and click away!

I hope you're kidding, there are Windows themes that look like
that...  where's .ch then?  *baffled*  ;-)

Another theory is that the poster just feels they have made a fine Web
site and they want people to visit and read it.  But this is not the
right way to ask people to do that.  We are a topic discussion group
and that isn't our topic.  Perhaps the message was sent to the wrong
forum by mistake?
