Don't Believe Conservatives Are Too Pissed-Off To Vote!
by Linda Milazzo

Democrats don't be fooled. Foley's escapades won't keep conservatives away
from the polls.

In the immediate aftermath of the Mark Foley/House Page debacle, staunchly
conservative Republicans decried the 'immorality and indecency' of
Congressman Foley and the Republican leadership which enabled him. In fact,
a number of powerful Conservatives cited the incident as the impetus for a
dearth of Republican voters in the upcoming midterm election.

Conservative luminaries like Tony Perkins, head of the Family Resource
Council, and Richard Viguerie, author of the new book, "Conservatives
Betrayed: How George W. Bush and Other Big Government Republicans Hijacked
the Conservative Cause," openly proclaimed that many Conservatives would
fail to show up at the polls in November because the Republican party had
abandoned its base.

Appearing Sunday morning on the Chris Wallace program, "Fox News Sunday," an
angry Tony Perkins demurred: "I think you can't underestimate the impact
this is going to have on the election. I think you're going to have marginal
voters that will drop off because of their disgust with the Republican
Party, not only on this issue, but a lack of advancing many of those core
social issues. I think you're going to have marginal candidates that will
suffer at the polls because they do not clearly articulate these issues. I
think the Republican Party is at a point of decision. I think some are
questioning out there whether this big-tent strategy has led to a three-ring
circus. I mean, there is some serious concern in the ranks of social
conservatives."

Perkins' declaration of Republican voter anger may be an honest portrayal of
conservative disillusionment with current Republican leadership. But
Democrats would be foolhardy to fall for a conservative strategy that plies
them with overconfidence for success in November. Especially when the
overconfidence is designed to keep Democrats from the polls altogether
through the false supposition that the Democratic take back is squarely in
the bag.

IT'S NOT!!! IT IS NOT!!!

It's a profound and deplorable error to forget how strongly Progressive
Democrats, moderate Democrats, centrist Democrats and liberal leaning
independents believed the woeful failures of the Bush Administration would
elect John Kerry in 2004. And although knowledgeable election observers
continue to doubt the legitimacy of the 2000 and 2004 elections, George W.
Bush was inaugurated to a second term nonetheless.

There's little doubt the consistent failures of the Bush Administration and
Republican majority Congress have prompted realistic Republicans to rethink
their dedication to this President and to the current Republican Party. The
failure of both to adhere to so-called conservative morality, the quagmires
in Iraq and Afghanistan, the growing national debt spurred by the costs of
the wars and corporate globalization, America's ever-increasing military
casualties, the decline of the American middle class, the decline of
America's worldwide prestige, the inept handling of North Korea which
resulted in a nuclear bomb, and a myriad of other disappointments have given
rise to a growing number of disenfranchised Republicans.

But while some of the disenfranchised may abandon their Republican party to
vote 'America first/Party second', there are still enough irreversible 'My
Party/My President' die-hards that Democrats have no choice but to get to
the polls in droves. The future of the nation and the world hang
precariously in the balance. Complacency on the part of Democrats to get to
the polls and vote November 7th will be nothing short of DERELICT, DIVISIVE,
DESTRUCTIVE and DERANGED!!

The fact is, Tony Perkins, Richard Viguerie, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell
have always known there were gay Republicans in Washington. According to
Mark Leibovich's article in Sunday's New York Times, "The presence of
homosexuals, particularly gay men, in crucial staff positions has been an
enduring if largely hidden staple of Republican life for decades, and
particularly in recent years. They have played decisive roles in passing
legislation, running campaigns and advancing careers."

Considering how entrenched Perkins, Viguerie, Robertson and Falwell are in
the day to day entanglements of the Republican Party. Considering how
meddlesome these Conservative leaders are in every aspect of Washington
business. Considering there are Conservative lobbyists filling the halls of
the White House and both Houses of Congress, it's impossible to believe
these Washington insiders are learning for the first time that there are
gays in high places in Washington.

As Bill Maher said to Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen on last
Friday's episode of his HBO series "Real Time, "We know in Hollywood that
when there's a scandal that hits the public, we always knew about it
beforehand. So you've been in Congress eight terms, you must have known,
like everybody [Foley was gay]. Come on, when it happens in Hollywood we
say, well it's a small town. This [Washington] is a small town, too.
Congress is even a smaller body. Didn't everybody know [about Mark
Foley].......?"

In typical Republican George Allen 'macaka' style, Congresswoman
Ros-Lehtinen, Mark Foley's fellow Floridian, responded with an incredulous,
"No!"

Oh, come on!!

In the United States House of Representatives, a body famous for gossip,
speculation and leaks, where the same people meet in the same Hall every
day, and live in the same vicinity of the same concentrated city every day,
can anyone really believe this woman is telling the truth? Much like, does
anyone really believe the contention that the intrusive Conservative
Christian leadership only recently learned there were gay Republican
Congressmembers and staffers in Washington, D.C.?

The fact is, Perkins, Viguerie, Robertson and Falwell have always known
there were gays in Government in D.C. But it was never an issue until the
revelation of the lurid acts of Mark Foley because the overwhelming majority
of D.C. Government gays live highly responsible, respectable lives.

But now that Washington's 'big' homosexual secret has been unleashed upon
the nation, the Conservatives are using this 'startling' revelation to their
advantage; to strong arm the Administration with their voter base, and to
convince unwitting Democrats that their morality crazed voters are much too
irate to show up to vote.

NONSENSE!! THEY'LL BE THERE. They'll vote. They'll vote Republican. And
they'll vote in droves because their pastors mandate that they do so!
They'll do in 2006 what they did in 2004. Only this time we won't be
blind-sided. We'll be there, too.

Please... Don't be naive. Don't fall for the rhetoric. Don't fall for the
lies. Take off from work. Go to your poll. Work at a poll. Observe at a
poll. GET OUT THE VOTE!! GET OUT THE VOTE!! GET OUT THE VOTE!!
