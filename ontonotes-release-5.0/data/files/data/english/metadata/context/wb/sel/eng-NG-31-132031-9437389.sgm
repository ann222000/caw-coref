Man, I'm having the hardest launching this sucker.  Once in the air it
is a dream to fly, but you got to get it there first.  My last 5
launches have been quite adventurous.  Two of them were crashes and 3
were very shakey take offs.  I had one big crash yesterday that I
nosed into the grass field.  Again, the CF saved the nose from
crumpling, but the foam got a little wrinkled from the impact.  I have
tried what Patrick suggested how to launch, but the plane is very
unpredictable at launch.

Mine launched perfect on 3S.  You were there, you remember.  (but I
had invisible help)

I never had major problems until I got to 4S.

The trick to an &quot;easy launch&quot; with the funjet is to toss it into a
very strong wind.  Remember when we were flying up on the road?  All I
was doing was tossing it into the wind like an easystar.  Wind is no
match for the funjet =)

Try a windy day.

Also, cut the funjet (and yourself) some slack.  This is your first
aileron plane and I imagine you are not all that comfortable with
flying upside down yet.  Once you are comfortable flying in any
orientation you can launch the funjet and let it spin all it wants to
without panic.

I know that feeling of being at stall speed upside down 5 feet above
the ground. . .  Not good.  After a while though you will get used to
power being your friend and you will just smash the gas and pull out
of it.

You are doing good.  Keep on it.  I crashed my funjet on
many-a-launches.  That is why carbon fiber is our other friend.

I think you've just made a great point.  I know I'm supposed to launch into the wind, but lately I've launched away from it, simply to avoid people at the field.

I can fly upside down, but I'm not comfortable turning, so I don't do it often.  Okay, no more launching away from the wind.  Gonna try it again tomorrow.

Funjet with wind = no good!

Not even after 50 flights would I want to launch with the wind.  You
need too much airspeed with the fj.  That badboy drops like a rock
sometimes.

Come fly with me out in livermore.  You can throw that damn thing in
any direction you like and you can have an entire soccer field to land
in.

You have anything to fly at the moment?  I can meet up with you on Sat. or Sun. to check out your local field.

I lost my second TP2200 4S pack last week.  I only have 1 left.

My new 3D is in the mail and you know I am going to build that thing ASAFP. . .

Maybe we should put it off till next weekend and then we can maiden my
new bird together.  You can try it out and see how you like 3D.  It is
EPP and I bought it to crash so I don't want to hear any crybaby chit
-when- (notice I didnt say if) you crash my plane =)

Ok, here I go again.  After many attempts to launch the FJ and
numerous pile drive into the grass I think I've finally figured out
how to launch this sucker.  Launching it at a steep angle is a big
mistake.  At first I thought launching it at a steep angle would make
the plane go straight up and if it does the torque roll I can make
adjustments and recover.  Problem is that it doesn't always go
straight up, but makes some funky maneuvers.  Especially when you have
it at 3/4 throttle and it does some weird chit you don't expect, then
it happens really fast.  Hey, stop busting my balls, I'm not as fast
on the stick as you guys.  The best way to launch is exactly how the
manual says.  3/4 throttle and throw it at a 30 degree angle.  Just
like you would throw a javelin.  Note to self.  When in doubt follow
the manual.  Again, without the CF at the nose, this plane would have
been history.  But it still looks like a Jet with a couple of cracks
here and there.  So, bring out your monkey caged planes and lets go
FLY!!!!

Good!

Took long enough =)

Now practice that spinning like a top barrel roll 24 inches off the
ground at WOT

PS.  How are the corals doing?

After learning to fly aileron on such an insane plane you will find
that any other plane is easy to master.  Good choice, all hard work is
behind you and all the fun is ahead of you!

Now, get on the Electric Foam Models bandwagon and start your
research.  The R3D thread is too busy.  Try post 35 of the Extra
thread:

http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=399962&amp;page;=3

and get a load of this EPP good-ness.  Built like a balsa but bounces
like a ball.

The great thing about 3D is that it is small, quiet, and you can do it
in a very small area.

Everyone should have 1 jet, 1 3D, 1 glider, and one. . .  tbd.

The coral is just about the same.  The softies are starting to get
bigger.  The LPS is just big and juicy.  I hate to be the one to break
this to you but those are just a ---- little big for a nano tank =)

Actually I forgot to tell you, but plans have changed.  I'm going with a 120g instead.  I like the extra depth of the 120g that the 125g doesn't have.  Originally the downgrade was due to the electric bill, but I'm going to use some sort of shed to keep my sump, and refugium enclosed.  Now I need to figure how do build a sump to fit my skimmer.  Is it hard to build a sump?  I know you said your girlfriend has made a few, so perhaps she can help with some ideas.

Good.  Nothing sucks worse than pouring a bunch of time, energy, and
money into a plane that sucks (or is otherwise not fun)

PC9 - SUCKED
PIPE - FUN -&gt; BROKE -&gt; SUCKED
EXTRA 300S balsa - SUCKED SMELLY ASS
HELLCAT - SUCKED
Acromaster - BAD DESIGN for POWER, sucked
Gas Trainer -. SUCKED SUCKED SUCKED
Gas Trainer #2 -&gt;  Sucked even worse

Flight flex Yak - was ok, floppy
Easystar - was great, will buy again
combat wing - been good, no good on high speed.
fun jet - Great, will buy again

EFM Yak ???  Time will tell

Others?  If I cant remember they must have sucked.

I cant belive that I have already owned at least 12 different RC planes. . .
