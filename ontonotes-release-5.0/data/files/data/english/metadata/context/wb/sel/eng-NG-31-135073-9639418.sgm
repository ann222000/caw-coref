The name of this group is g3-4-list, wait a minute that is now g3-5
list. As I have an upgraded g3 with a g4 processor and can not afford to
buy a g4 (which will be left behind soon enough) with all the bells and
whistles needed to run OS 10.5 may I suggest a new list just for OS 10.5
as most of the new postings to this group are for OS 10.5. I still need
help from time to time. I now feel not only left out but mocked on this
list.

I'm not one of the list nannies here or anything, but I'll guess that
LowEndDan probably will make a Leopard list. And I'm also on older Macs,
with no plans to get Leopard. But, I don't feel left out or mocked, nor
do I think the Leopard discussions are inappropriate here because &quot;G3-G5
List&quot; means people using Macintosh G3s, G4s or G5s, and lots of the
Leopard users are on G4s.

I do have a G4 -- a Quicksilver 867 which should run Leopard, but I'm not
interested in Leopard because I depend on Classic Mode, which Leopard
doesn't support. In fact, I'm quite happy with Tiger 10.4.9, too. Still
though, all the Leopard talk in here doesn't bother me.

Just my 2 simoleons....

Just took a look at the site.  Not much there at the moment, but I'm
sure it will become as popular as this list in short order.  I just
hope it doesn't become limited to G5 owners.  There are a lot of us
running G4s with Leopard.

&gt; I wouldn't worry about it too much George, people with a dime's worth  of intelligence should see that it's listed as &quot;LEOPARD&quot; and not get their panties in a bunch (sorry Amanda). I have G3's G4's &amp; G5's and I don't have a problem with it. I have a little bit of a problem with some of the listers trying to upgrade the impossible to Leopard if you know what I mean.

I hope I haven't contributed to your dismay. I have 2 B&amp;W G3's I've
upgraded to G4 CPU's and I think they are awesome machines. They're
still running and running strong.
I've moved up to G4 machines running Tiger and Leopard, but I devote
time to keep my Smurfs running. I'm more than happy to talk about my
G3's and what I've done to them.

I have a G4 MDD 1Ghz DP, and it would run Leopard just fine, but I
still like OS X 10.4 for the time being, at the very least until Apple
fixes some things in Leopard. I also own a Smurf G3, and I love using
it. It actually still has OS 9.2 on it, but I love using it, and
sometimes find myself using it more than I do my G4 MDD. If you need
any help at all, PLEASE do not hesitate to contact me personally at:
thelordsserv ... @gmail.com

Hope to see you around!

(Rant warning, just delete it if you want....)

Yeah, just make sure there's separate lists for left-handed and right-
handed users, and possibly sub-lists for left-handed users named Mike
using Photoshop 7 with it, not PSD 6 or PS CS1, 2 or 3, JUST PS7.

Because, after all, we can't have TOO many electronic ghettos to keep
everyone walled off in separate groups. Nothing like trying to look
for help on something and having your choice of 5,234 different
little clubs with 4 members in each one.

I'm sorry you feel 'mocked' by a discussion of an OS version you
can't run, but that's taking things a little too personally. My
advice: &quot;tough titties&quot;...grow up and get a thicker skin, or at least
learn to use the delete key...if you're this easily offended, the
real world is going to be a shock, I guarantee you.

10.5 just came out. It runs on about half of the systems discussed
here. LOTS of people are playing with this major upgrade of the OS.
Yes there are going to be a lot of 10.5 questions on the list. Deal
with it...it's a temporary thing.

Now I should go subscribe to ANOTHER G*DAMN LEM LIST for no good
reason than someone wants to circumscribe MY world for HIS benefit?

And yes, you all caught me on &quot;cranky thursday&quot;....

G'day again listers.

I must be getting grumpy myself as I get older, cause I've decided
today is my 'Tuppence worth' day.

Personally I don't see why we need a new group for Leopard. If we all
moved to new groups as time went on, no-one might be left to help
people in this group.

Yes, I know some of you will be members of both, but as we gradually
move to later machines as we can afford them, we'll be wanting to
concentrate on the groups that offer support.

If all support for Leopard were to be withdrawn from this group and
concentrated in a Leopard group, some of you would rightfully object
I'm sure.

I'm someone who has a foot in both camps. I'm lucky enough to own a
new 24&quot; iMac, but I look after (voluntarily) a small Mac lab with
Tiger, and my sister has a sawtooth with Tiger. She's about to get an
iMac however, and I'm going to trick the sawtooth up to Leopard
standard for a friend to have (another convert).

If we stop supporting Leopard in this group, I forsee a gradually
dwindling membership, and possibly an eventual loss of much needed
skilled people. A rich mix of subjects from past into the future I
feel would ensure the groups survival however.

Being a member of multiple groups is somewhat of a hassle (I've
dropped out of a few), and lets face it, we don't have a staggering
amount of traffic, and what about when something supercedes Leopard,
another group?

I'm from a teaching background, and have seen differing interest
groups wither and die due to lack of membership, and would hate to see
members maintaing older machines left by the wayside.

My second Tuppence worth.

Again, I agree and I'd like to add that the G3-5 list ought to just be
expanded to include the Intel Macs also.  I think it's just plain
stupid for us to have different sub-groups to be discussing aspects of
all of the modern Macs that are out there.  I know I've posted
questions on the G3-5 list already about my Intel Macs and have gotten
replies.
This seems to be one of the BEST lists on the entire LEM group of
lists with quite a few very knowledgeable people subscribing.  I could
post a question on the Intel Mac list but probably wait until the 12th
of Never to get a reply as not enough people are subscribed.
I would like this list expanded to include discussion of Leopard,
Tiger, Panther, etc as well as G3, G4, G5 and Intel Macs.
Bruce, Dan and Brian are excellent sources of expertise and I value
their posts or answers to posts.  There are also a few others who have
come through for me with various informed answers.
Why segregate ourselves?  Why not just make this a general list for
discussion of Macs?
Do my Intel Macs behave that much differently from a G5?  They will
run Tiger and Leopard.  Most issues that don't require taking it in
for repairs are software related and can be answered here.
Let's become inclusive instead of exclusive.

Thoughts?

*********************
Well, if every machine-hardware list had to handle Leopard separately
then those lists would be choked with leopard posts. Can't you see
that a separate list makes sense?

And if that means fewer members on a certain list. That is the way of
it.  As a long time PCI lister you don't hear me whining about the
decimation to the PCI list because people have moved on.

Besides it makes sense to have a separate Leopard list. That will give
the LC II users a place to find out if anmyone has 10.5 up and running
on their favorite machine yet :-)

Sorry to say that I have  foot in both camps but I have to agree with
Wallace more. Why not let the LC II's, Umax's, older G3's and the like
consolidate a list that better able to find more information among
like minds. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to segregate the group
just make it more efficient. Questions, would you go to a proctologist
to have you brain checked out? Would you go to a neurologist to get a
colonoscopy? Both questions might be a scary analogy but I think it
makes my point. The Leopard list will wither on the vine given the
fact that it will no longer be new. How about 2 groups- G3 and prior
and G4+ onward including Intel, Tiger and Leopard. Some of us have
evolved in the way we think, the cars we drive and the computers and
software we use and we've moved UP for the most part. If people want
to remain in the past because of nostalgia, like the older stuff
better, can run programs they like or some of those who for economic
reasons can't upgrade I say more power to you. We've all read how much
bantering goes on when someone with an old machine is trying to
install the impossible on it and brings it to this list with old an
outdated peripherals and try to patch it up. I too have a couple of
older machines but I wouldn't think of running a 1.3 mega-pixel dash
cam on DIAL-UP! I can't believe some of the posts! Like I said before
wouldn't their interest be better served with others with the same
kind of equipment to share their experiences? I know I really stuck my
neck out waaay out there on this one and I'm ready for a lot of flack
but I'm ready for it so BRING IT ON!!!

Well I may as well get in here, since I just sent a PRIVATE
message in error to the list.

I ask to have the word PRIVATE put in front of any subject
sent to me directly, because there is just too much junk
dealing with modifications that belong on a list dealing
with that topic.

I am stock. No messing with will this MB work in that case
and all that nonsense. Now, don't get me wrong,
experimenting is fine, but I for one am just trying to make
the stock stuff work and all this traffic is killing me
with 2 hours a day just to keep up. I read EVERY ONE!!!

One way would be to require the word STOCK or the word
EXPERIMENTAL first in the Subject line - this way I can
delete all experimental stuff and read the stock stuff.

AND I have no interest in these doing INTEL stuff! It
belongs on a different list not the stock G3 G4 and G5 that
we all know will expire in a few years.

Jonas,

Dude, I think you've be inhaling too much of that LA SMOG! WTF are you
talking about?? STOCK, EXPERIMENTAL, PRIVATE and what's with all of
the acronyms like Sd or TTY etc. that you use in your post. Someone
posted about a new list not no new word game. If you read my post
among others you'd see that you're way off your rocker. To boot we
don't care if you don't have no interest in Intels. If anybody changes
the stock configurations all they have to do is look at your computer
specs and see that's no way a stock configuration it's a effing
nightmare. While we're at it what the heck is AGP graphics on a card?
Where the heck else would they be in a G4, hanging on a bracket below
the ZIP Drive???? What's 470 Mb (megabits) MB is megabytes, no one has
any clue. It's because of people like you that people want to start
another group and that's to let you guys discuss it among yourselves
like systems, configurations and AGP on a graphics card. We want to be
left alone as much as you do so you don't bother us with your dribble
and we with ours. Like minds, like systems, a G3 and BELOW list OS 7,8
and 9 and a G4-G5 list including Intels and Tiger and Leopard. This
way we can all share relevant information among ourselves. I can post
on the G3 list if I have a question/problem with my iMac or my &quot;Pismo
PowerBook and you can post a question/problem on the G4-5 list if you
have a question about your stuff. Some of us are progressive and want
to move on and some of us like nostalgia and stay in the past for what
ever reason and that's fine with me. By you putting PRIVATE on your
posting is almost the same as having your own little chat in your own
group.

Respectfully,

Ron

I am not opposed to leopard. but my personal preference is to not
upgrade my commercial software beyond four years past the origin of
the machine. so i am happy with my pismo maxed out at panther even
though it has a g4. for newer stuff i use linux. the compilers in
linux
and other things are more current than in macos and the expense is
not worth the rat race to me. If i ever get a newer mac maybe say
an imac g5 i would like tiger on it i think and i would add to tiger
as i did with previous os versions with the fink or darwinports
packages
of free software, although maybe not as much since native ports
are much more available with tiger. on the other hand linux is still
significantly faster and more efficient of your hardware in general so
i am not sure. it is more efficient sometimes of human resources to
use
macos until you run into something where mass market interests
interfere. so i use both.

as far as intel goes. i don't buy it. i would rather hear about how
people are getting macosx to run natively on ibm power series servers.
(power6 runs tiger, will it run leopard, how about power3/4/5 which
are
more for used machines in my price range).

i consider apple bringing unix to the mass market to be a good thing

i have strong belief in the value of diversity. minorities need a safe

once upon a time apple was more of an innovative company instead of
running on the heels of wintel. everybody knows amd is superior both
in their invention and their values. macos is certainly the superior
commercial
os but consumer orientation is not my bag at all.

wait no i correct myself. intel is the leading innovator in handheld
cpu that
is ARM such as in iphone and treo. but in bigger processor they just
made
cheap copies of amd when their own design turned out worse problems
than
the g5. also ibm is really is also very good designing in their own
domains.
always possible apple may see the light one of these days, or they may
succeed in their aims of taking over the consumer market in which case
I hope some other alternative emerges for the freedom of the creative

Get off of this minority crap, no one on this list least of all me is
advocating that they don't don't have a place here...as far as I'm
concerned this list is COLORBLIND and any IDIOT that suggests
otherwise doesn't belong on this list. If you had seen the post that a
so called &quot;Minority&quot; posted, you would be put in your place. You also
answered the question in your second paragraph of your post of why we
need a little more of thinning of the posts. &quot; you wish the list
nannies would put some limits to the leopardists...but my personal
preference is not to upgrade.....&quot; BINGO, your after the same damn
thing as the guy I wrote my original post to and that is to have your
self served interests taken care of and the hell with the leopardist!
How dare you chastise me for wanting to group like minds together when
you want to do the same thing and more and throw in more crap with
Linux, although a good OS it to has it's place just not here. How can
you have your topics respected when you don't want us to have our's
treated the same. The more I think abut it I think you're just another
bleeding heart, touchy feely guy that just doesn't get it! You better
lighten up on smoking that crap too!

Ron,
I may be wrong but I think you misunderstood his &quot;minority&quot; statement.
My belief is that he meant it as a small minority of users who are not
upgrading as opposed to a &quot;minority&quot; of americans such as not being of
one color or another. I may be misterpreting both of you so I await
correction if that is so.
just my two cents,,,, now back to lurking and learning. elbert.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Look again, it's the &quot;g3-5-list.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  ...may I suggest a new list just for OS 10.5....

&gt; &gt; &gt; The list exists. It's the Leopard list.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Please visit http://lowendmac.com/lists .

&gt; &gt; There IS a lot of traffic on this list compared to the other lem
&gt; &gt; lists.
&gt; &gt; Part of my use of computers is to help me stay semi organized.
&gt; &gt; I need help with that. Having topics respected helps.

&gt; &gt; I wish that the list nanny would put some limits on the leopardists.
&gt; &gt; I am not opposed to leopard. but my personal preference is to not
&gt; &gt; upgrade my commercial software beyond four years past the origin of
&gt; &gt; the machine. so i am happy with my pismo maxed out at panther even
&gt; &gt; though it has a g4. for newer stuff i use linux. the compilers in
&gt; &gt; linux
&gt; &gt; and other things are more current than in macos and the expense is
&gt; &gt; not worth the rat race to me. If i ever get a newer mac maybe say
&gt; &gt; an imac g5 i would like tiger on it i think and i would add to tiger
&gt; &gt; as i did with previous os versions with the fink or darwinports
&gt; &gt; packages
&gt; &gt; of free software, although maybe not as much since native ports
&gt; &gt; are much more available with tiger. on the other hand linux is still
&gt; &gt; significantly faster and more efficient of your hardware in general so
&gt; &gt; i am not sure. it is more efficient sometimes of human resources to
&gt; &gt; use
&gt; &gt; macos until you run into something where mass market interests
&gt; &gt; interfere. so i use both.

&gt; &gt; as far as intel goes. i don't buy it. i would rather hear about how
&gt; &gt; people are getting macosx to run natively on ibm power series servers.
&gt; &gt; (power6 runs tiger, will it run leopard, how about power3/4/5 which
&gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; more for used machines in my price range).

&gt; &gt; i consider apple bringing unix to the mass market to be a good thing
&gt; &gt; (anything better than windows which may have its place but dominance
&gt; &gt; i consider a scourge).

&gt; &gt; i have strong belief in the value of diversity. minorities need a safe
&gt; &gt; place
&gt; &gt; to hang out though. you have to be able to live in both worlds.

&gt; &gt; once upon a time apple was more of an innovative company instead of
&gt; &gt; running on the heels of wintel. everybody knows amd is superior both
&gt; &gt; in their invention and their values. macos is certainly the superior
&gt; &gt; commercial
&gt; &gt; os but consumer orientation is not my bag at all.

&gt; &gt; wait no i correct myself. intel is the leading innovator in handheld
&gt; &gt; cpu that
&gt; &gt; is ARM such as in iphone and treo. but in bigger processor they just
&gt; &gt; made
&gt; &gt; cheap copies of amd when their own design turned out worse problems
&gt; &gt; than
&gt; &gt; the g5. also ibm is really is also very good designing in their own
&gt; &gt; domains.
&gt; &gt; always possible apple may see the light one of these days, or they may
&gt; &gt; succeed in their aims of taking over the consumer market in which case
&gt; &gt; I hope some other alternative emerges for the freedom of the creative
&gt; &gt; types.

&gt; Get off of this minority crap, no one on this list least of all me is
&gt; advocating that they don't don't have a place here...as far as I'm
&gt; concerned this list is COLORBLIND and any IDIOT that suggests
&gt; otherwise doesn't belong on this list. If you had seen the post that a
&gt; so called &quot;Minority&quot; posted, you would be put in your place. You also
&gt; answered the question in your second paragraph of your post of why we
&gt; need a little more of thinning of the posts. &quot; you wish the list
&gt; nannies would put some limits to the leopardists...but my personal
&gt; preference is not to upgrade.....&quot; BINGO, your after the same damn
&gt; thing as the guy I wrote my original post to and that is to have your
&gt; self served interests taken care of and the hell with the leopardist!
&gt; How dare you chastise me for wanting to group like minds together when
&gt; you want to do the same thing and more and throw in more crap with
&gt; Linux, although a good OS it to has it's place just not here. How can
&gt; you have your topics respected when you don't want us to have our's
&gt; treated the same. The more I think abut it I think you're just another
&gt; bleeding heart, touchy feely guy that just doesn't get it! You better
&gt; lighten up on smoking that crap too!

&gt; You're welcome,

&gt; Ron
