Here it is, what no one in the group has been waiting for, a balance
board that trains...gasp...standing balance and posture. I write that
tongue in cheek, but the remark also contains more than a shred of
truth. The concept of balance and posture, two sides of the very same
coin, has lost its meaning due to so many less than efficient products
and fraudulent claims by certain methods, but nonetheless we can't
throw out the baby with the bathwater....

In short, and to simplify things for the sake of brevity, there are
two basic types of balance training products and a large army of
proponents and opponents in both camps. First is the multitude of
boards with a bevel underneath that are useful in controlling
unexpected acceleration and momentum in a given direction; to be sure
some are better than others and there's a place for this type of
training, depending on your needs. Second, air filled discs that by
design distort ground reactive forces in a multitude of ways, but
still provide a very usable platform for plyometrics and explosive
movements. Another way to perceive the conundrum is that a person with
poor postural habits, and in chronic pain, can still use a wobble
board without falling off, because it's not designed to allow them to
"catch" their balance and center themselves or in other words it's not
encouraging new postural strategies and it's definitely not training
standing balance!

The solution is found in a (ahem) profound concept that's been
distilled into a rather simple device. The P.A.S.T. (acronym for
posture, agility, strength, total body integration) Balance Boards are
designed to "feel" like a passive extension of your body while
simultaneously reducing your natural base of support; making it's very
difficult for you to "cheat" with poor posture and still balance on
the center of the boards. By stimulating the body's natural reflexes
to align your body in gravity and encouraging the right muscle to
respond at the right time, the benefits of "standing strong" are both
immediate and cumulative and continue long after you've finished
exercising.

Another unique aspect is that the balance boards can be turned over
and become a base where the P.A.S.T. Exercise Handles can be inserted.
The ergonomically designed exercise handles reduce the strain on the
wrists, rotate, and (slightly) wobble to improve shoulder function;
basically, a great accessory for bodyweight calisthenics and as a way
to take your Pilates or Yoga routine up a few notches.

THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A CURE but I've yet to see ANYONE stand on the
boards, shut their eyes, and get off 2-5 minutes later without feeling
"aligned" and centered" and simply amazed at how quick the boards
begin to recalibrate their body. I've even had old-timers who claim
standing on one leg or performing compound movements trains their
balance, but they have trouble standing on the boards and learn to
appreciate its benefits. The answer is simply that very few people
know when their alignment and posture aren't functioning optimally,
because their signature patterns of movement are normal to them or in
other words your nervous system takes being crooked as its new home
and you feel as if you're standing straight.

P.S.    I'm simply bringing awareness to a really cool product and YES,
I have a financial interest in this venture as both the inventor and
CEO of Functional Innovations. To be sure I've personally felt and
seen drastic results for people as they learn how to align themselves
in gravity and furthermore, customers have sent me glowing
testimonials after using the FREE video section to target parts of
their bodies within an integrated movement approach.

P.P.S.  You likely haven't "heard" of the product, because we're going
"grassroots" and trying to avoid all hyperbole. Please, feel free to
agree, or disagree, with my paradigm of thought; however, refrain from
flaming posts. Honestly, I've seen too many wars between "old school"
and "new school" and it's not conducive to anything, plus I'm against
all dogmatic schools of thought and simply believe the body is design
to move in gravity, and deal with ground reactive forces, with a sense
of ease that comes from being "balanced" in more ways than one....

Your is health,
