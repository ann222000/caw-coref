I don't know about your spare tire dilemma but if you look in your Ford
Owners Manual the customer service number and more than likely a web site
will be listed.

&gt; like mine showing spare tires installed, with no mention of this being
&gt; an option.

&gt; Who in their right mind would order a $35,000.00 truck and not

&gt; I'm open to suggestions and I hope that if other people have had

Welcome to the new world of trucks!!!!!!! Check the listing of standard
equipment for your truck...That will tell you whether or not the spare tire
and wheel are truly extras....If this is in fact the care, which I think it
is, I would recommend buying another tire and wheel from an aftermarket
supplier...I'll bet you can get it cheaper and better...

If I remember correctly, practically EVERYTHING on a pickup truck is
optional, including the spare tire and mount. Even the rear bumper is
optional. When I ordered my 1990 F-250 Lariat (top of the line), I ordered
it with the bench seat. When I got the truck, I found that the bench seat
was extremely uncomfortable (the dealer didn't have one in stock to try out
before I ordered). The &quot;Captain's chairs&quot; (bucket-type seats) were a $400
option (dealer cost). When I tried to order the bucket seats through the
dealer parts department, they had to be ordered in zillions of parts that
you had to assemble, and the cost was approximately $1500 per seat. So
don't be surprised if your spare tire option jumps from around $300 to
$1,000 when you try to order it through the parts department. Try to find
one from a junk yard. Ford has zone customer service reps that you can
contact by phone if you have enough patience to hold until they decide to
answer, but I have been unable to find any e-mail address for Ford - I
guess they don't know about computers yet.

I bought a 1996 F-350 used with no spare tire rack (did have the spare
tire and wheel with it). Took it to a Ford dealer and they installed
the rack for $131.74. You'd have to add the cost of a wheel and tire
to that.

I received my 99 F350 without a spare or carrier also. It was on the order
form, but I assumed the $300 option was for matching aluminum wheel and
according to the Kelly Blue book web site (under standard equipment list for
super duty) a spare comes standard. I was planning on replacing wheels and
tires anyway, so why pay extra for stock aluminum wheel and tire. The
shock was twofold: the truck came without any spare and when I ordered a
spare wheel and carrier assembly, the wheel is painted steel (not aluminum).
The dealer was nice enough to offer to order all parts for me at cost. I'd
suggest to your dealer to do the same. It ended up costing me the same as
if I'd ordered the option to begin with. You'll have to go to a Firestone
dealer to get a stock tire, Ford can't order one for you.

option sheets I have seen that the spare is a cost option on the Super
Duty line. Check places like edmunds.com or kbb.com, and you'll see
the spare tires listed separately - usually between $200 and $300 or
so.

would think that HAD to be for the matching tire and wheel, not a steel
rim and &quot;this will do&quot; tire. My used S15 had the spare missing and the
hoist was rusted out, I picked up the hoist for $15 CAD and the spare
(not full size) for another $10. The least Ford could do it supply a
donut like this. I'd love to see one of the review magazines test one
of these babies and get a flat, only to discover for the first time that
there is no spare.

If the hanger and spare are an option, do you also have to buy a jack
and tire iron?

"/> No. jack and lug wrench are included.

I think it is time to take a poll on the last time somebody had a flat
on their pickup or motorhome. I do not want to count trailer flats just
the flats on the unit with engine.

I'll go first.
Last flat was on a 66 Mustang back in 1980. I have had Zero flats since
then.
The last two trucks have not had the spare and I have not needed it yet.

Most recent flat was on a 32x11.50 BFG Mud Terrain ... musta been in
'96. I was where I shouldn't have been, driving down the top of a heap
of sharp 3&quot;-minus crushed rock freshly laid down by a belly-dump and not
flattened out. I managed to run the point of one rock between two
treads and flatten a tire.

Prior to that, in the summer of '95 I got a flat on the OEM P235 75R15
General APs which came stock on my '94 Nissan. On an old logging road.
I either ran over a fire-hardened stick or the end of a cable.

Before that, I hadn't had a flat since '88, when I stuck a flattened out
pice of 1&quot; angle iron about 6&quot; long right through the sidewall of a
cheap highway tire on my 86.5 2WD Nissan truck ... I was hauling butt,
cornering hard, ran over that sucker laying on the pavement, and it went
clear inside.

I purely hate to even drive across town without a spare.

"/> Running BFG T/A All Terrains, well after about half the tread life is
gone, I seem to get a flat about every few months (often enough that I
decided it was worth it to get the tools to repair them myself). But,
I live a good 30 miles from &quot;civilization&quot; (e.g., &quot;town&quot;, which is 5
miles away doesn't have any place to get a tire repaired), 5 of those
miles are dirt/gravel (so that's 10 miles a day), and that road just
happens to be the same road where the county trash collection site is.
So, I seem to pick up lots of nails &amp; screws (I really wish people
wouldn't put their con/destruction trash in the back of their pickups
and assume it'll all stay there until they get to the dump).

I make sure I have a &quot;real&quot; spare tire. I rotate all tires and replace
'em all when they get worn enough (that hurts with the dually, 7
tires!).

The spare is an option because many folks are going to install a monster
towing bumper/hitch, much stronger than your typical factory job. These
guys include reenforcement bars which go where the spare would have been.
The trucks are then used to tow very heavy grain wagons and such at slow
speeds.

"/> Last Wednesday, at 5:00 a.m. in the middle of the local Native Reserve,
at about -13 C. The spare under the box had not been off in several
months which included a complete harvest season. The truck was a GM
with the cable winch holding the spare tight against the underside of
the truck. The winch worked, but the tire was level full of frozen dirt
and straw. It took us (fortunately I was not alone) over 30 minutes to
get the spare off the truck, and ten more to change it. We NEEDED a
spare tire. Not one person passed us in the time we were there with the

I think your dealer is trying to snowball you.
I have the F-450 with duellys and did not get a spare.
But you generally do not get a spare with medium to heavy duty trucks.
I would say a consumer oriented truck should be equipped with a spare.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/> +&gt;Hello All,
+&gt;
+&gt; I was really shocked when I discovered my new 1999 SuperDuty F250
+&gt;Ford did not have a spare tire or mount for one. I custom ordered my
+&gt;truck loaded with many extras and waited 7 months to get it. I
+&gt;thought it was just an oversight either from the factory or the
+&gt;dealership.
+&gt;
+&gt; When I contacted the dealer, my salesman told me &quot;oh that's an
+&gt;option&quot; on SuperDuty F series trucks and that I would have to order
+&gt;the parts from the dealership myself.
+&gt;
+&gt; Well I think that's pure bullshit and I'm pissed.............
+&gt;
+&gt; As stated, I ordered that truck piece by piece right from the
+&gt;Ford Superduty Book supplied by my dealership and nowhere in the
+&gt;Features or Options does it list a spare tire or mounting kit. It
+&gt;lists all kinds of superfluous crap like molding, cargo lights, tow
+&gt;hooks, and other non-essential items but NOTHING about the spare
+&gt;tire. I still have the original book I ordered from and after further
+&gt;review, I find that in fact there are several pictures of trucks just
+&gt;like mine showing spare tires installed, with no mention of this being
+&gt;an option.
+&gt;
+&gt; Who in their right mind would order a $35,000.00 truck and not
+&gt;expect to get a spare tire ?
+&gt;
+&gt; I'm open to suggestions and I hope that if other people have had
+&gt;this problem, there is already a solution from FORD to address it.
+&gt;
+&gt; If not, who has a name and phone number or e-mail address for a
+&gt;FORD Customer Service Rep that I can speak too ?
+&gt;
+&gt; Thanks in Advance to all Information pertaining to this issue,
+&gt;

I just grabbed Ford's f-series ninety-nine propaganda booklet to
double-check. Sure enough, under the Exterior Features list, see the
heading Wheels and look at the last line. It reads &quot;spare tire and wheel&quot;
and, looking across, is listed as 'O' for &quot;Optional&quot; for the XL, XLT, and
Lariat. For those who will next complain about the bumper, that's the first
thing under Exterior Features (well, right after they mention that the front
bumper is standard). XL, XLT, and LARIAT all read the bumper as 'O' for
optional, with the XL having the argent and the others having the chrome.
As earlier mentioned, Edmunds.com, carprices.com, and all the printed guides
I can find all list these both as options. Granted, it's easy to miss
because it's counter-intuitive for those of us who have not experience this
before, but this practice seems far more the rule than the exception, even
with imports and especially regarding bumpers (which are not legally
required on trucks in most areas I've lived in).

On getting a spare tire and wheel, it actually is about the same price as
factory from a reputable dealer. Go to ford-trucks.com and see the &quot;'97 and
up&quot; truck list for tons of discussion on the topic, including everything
you'll need to get the wheel and carrier (you still will have to find a tire
somewhere, though).

Regards, Bud

you getting a front flat. Any truck bigger than that, the spare tire
would be a quarter of the load capacity :-)

Apparently *another* &quot;advantage&quot; in newest trucks - my '91 Dodge Ram 250
came with 5 Michlins and 5 wheels - no &quot;extra&quot; charge...

THIS is &quot;progress&quot;? NOT!

Reminds me of the half day(!)* I spent parked in the middle of the

of two roads that cross the Artic Circle in North America, the
Dempster being the other. I was helping this guy figure out how
to get the spare out of his pickup truck. Parking (and sometimes
camping) in the middle of the road is one of the things you
expect up that way.

In a CLOUD of mosquitos - the big Alaskan kind that carry thier
own cutlery - we removed the entire spare tire mounting rack
and most of our knuckles. Then we discovered that the spare was
flat.

We took the whole kit'n'kaboodle some 50 miles to a garage where
he said he'd get it fixed and snag a ride south the next day. I
continued north.

The fella spent some considerable time muttering about that lock.

* A bit of poetic license - it was in late June and a &quot;day&quot; runs
for about a week at that time of year. Go another 300 miles north
and it runs for about a month. Talk about weird RVing.

"/>  You're not trying hard enough Erich!
I cut a sidewall while hillclimbing the Bronco this summer. No spare
but a repair kit. It didn't work (huge cut) but luckily one of the
guys I was wheeling with is the sort who knows somebody everywhere and
we borrowed an old spare wheel and tire from a local guy and kept on
wheeling.

Incidently, I tried demounting and remounting my 15&quot; tires by hand
just to see if it could be done. Sometimes it can and sometimes it
can't. I could occaisionally break the bead by driving over the edge
of it on a board held by an assistant, some tires held fast. Getting
them off the rim was a battle with 2 guys and prybars. Remounting was
no picnic either. Some tires worked better than other. Don't count on
being able to do it out in the bush.

I am wondering if 16.5&quot; tires might be easier? I'll have to give it
a try someday...

&gt;&gt;Sorry, Mike - I understand you're upset, but it's very clear on the
&gt;&gt;option sheets I have seen that the spare is a cost option on the
&gt;&gt;Super Duty line. Check places like edmunds.com or kbb.com, and
&gt;&gt;you'll see the spare tires listed separately - usually between $200
&gt;&gt;and $300 or so.

&gt;I'm with the original poster. If I had seen $300 US as an option I
&gt;would think that HAD to be for the matching tire and wheel, not a
&gt;steel rim and &quot;this will do&quot; tire. My used S15 had the spare missing
&gt;and the hoist was rusted out, I picked up the hoist for $15 CAD and
&gt;the spare (not full size) for another $10. The least Ford could do it
&gt;supply a donut like this. I'd love to see one of the review magazines
&gt;test one of these babies and get a flat, only to discover for the
&gt;first time that there is no spare.

&gt;If the hanger and spare are an option, do you also have to buy a jack

"/> Actually what you get is the identical tire as the 4 on the ground,
including white letters if you have them, but a steel wheel. That
doesn't necessarily mean a &quot;Public Works&quot; steel wheel, either. My 93
F150 had the matching spare tire and the same 15x7 5 slot steel wheel,
but painted gray instead of chrome. On a Super Duty, you would
probably get the best looking steel wheel, simply unchromed, if you
have aluminums on the ground.

Can't have a donut on a full size pickup because of two factors - ride
height and load capacity. It might be ok on your compact sedan, but
don't try to replace an E-rated 31&quot; tire with a donut, your truck will
literally flop over.

I agree, it's stupid marketing for Ford, but GM is worse. On Ford and
Dodge dually trucks, the six tires are included. When you buy a Chevy
or GMC dually, first you have to pay for the dual rear wheel option
(about $900), then you have to pay another $700-$800 for the 4 rear
tires even if they're the standard all-season style, and some more for
the spare.

Chrysler was putting on their trucks.

I had one last night. I recently bought a Dodge Raider that
came with some semi cheap 2 ply tires that still had lots of
tread on them. But as I should have known 2 ply tires do
not hold up well off road. Ripped a sidewall on something.

Had to try and change the sucker in the dark and in a place
where my jack kept sinking in the mud. No fun at all. My
good light went out while I was working on it and to top it
off I was in a briar patch. I put my good tires back on
today.

In fact I have flats on a regular basis even with 6 ply
tires. Don't you guys ever go off road? Isn't this a 4wd
newsgroup?

&gt; Hello All,

&gt; I was really shocked when I discovered my new 1999 SuperDuty F250
&gt; Ford did not have a spare tire or mount for one. I custom ordered my
&gt; truck loaded with many extras and waited 7 months to get it. I
&gt; thought it was just an oversight either from the factory or the
&gt; dealership.

&gt; When I contacted the dealer, my salesman told me &quot;oh that's an
&gt; option&quot; on SuperDuty F series trucks and that I would have to order
&gt; the parts from the dealership myself.

&gt; Well I think that's pure bullshit and I'm pissed.............

&gt; As stated, I ordered that truck piece by piece right from the
&gt; Ford Superduty Book supplied by my dealership and nowhere in the
&gt; Features or Options does it list a spare tire or mounting kit. It
&gt; lists all kinds of superfluous crap like molding, cargo lights, tow
&gt; hooks, and other non-essential items but NOTHING about the spare
&gt; tire. I still have the original book I ordered from and after further
&gt; review, I find that in fact there are several pictures of trucks just
&gt; like mine showing spare tires installed, with no mention of this being
&gt; an option.

&gt; Who in their right mind would order a $35,000.00 truck and not
&gt; expect to get a spare tire ?

&gt; I'm open to suggestions and I hope that if other people have had
&gt; this problem, there is already a solution from FORD to address it.

&gt; If not, who has a name and phone number or e-mail address for a
&gt; FORD Customer Service Rep that I can speak too ?

&gt; Thanks in Advance to all Information pertaining to this issue,

&gt; Michael

"/> It has been that way for years with the heavier duty Fords, my 96 was the

variety of things. You can get just the carrier. Just the carrier and
rim, or the whole works. Your dealer SHOULD have known.

The guy next door picked up a nail the other day in his GMC. We
noticed it stuck in the tire, and patched it on site (used my patch
kit and the air compressor in the Hummer). No flat, no (noticable)
loss of air. Eventually it would have gone flat, though.

Me, last flat was about five years ago. I cary a plug kit, a patch
kit, and the Hummer has air, so I worry less about flats (I've
runfalt's too.)

Guess you've never owned a dually! &lt;g&gt; Six wheels all teh same. Next
tiem you see one, stop and take a look.--the two wheels in the back
are the same, just the inside one is with the offset out, and the

&gt;Heh!

&gt;Reminds me of the half day(!)* I spent parked in the middle of the
&gt;Dalton Highway some 300 miles above Fairbanks. The Dalton is one
&gt;of two roads that cross the Artic Circle in North America, the
&gt;Dempster being the other. I was helping this guy figure out how
&gt;to get the spare out of his pickup truck. Parking (and sometimes
&gt;camping) in the middle of the road is one of the things you
&gt;expect up that way.

&gt;In a CLOUD of mosquitos - the big Alaskan kind that carry thier
&gt;own cutlery - we removed the entire spare tire mounting rack
&gt;and most of our knuckles. Then we discovered that the spare was
&gt;flat.

&gt;We took the whole kit'n'kaboodle some 50 miles to a garage where
&gt;he said he'd get it fixed and snag a ride south the next day. I
&gt;continued north.

&gt;The fella spent some considerable time muttering about that lock.

&gt;* A bit of poetic license - it was in late June and a &quot;day&quot; runs
&gt;for about a week at that time of year. Go another 300 miles north
&gt;and it runs for about a month. Talk about weird RVing.

Al,

Yep, the truck came with a jack and lug wrench and the instructions
on how to change the spare tire and damn, I forgot to order them
separate .....

Now it also came with headlights, tail lights, rear view mirror,
windshield, and lots of other stuff that I didn't order too, imagine
that.......but, still No Spare Tire or Hanger to carry one if you had
it..

&gt; Any one of my 7 wheels will fit in any one of the 7 positions on my
&gt; truck - take a good look at duals - on the rear the &quot;convex&quot; sides
&gt; are flush with one another - on the front the &quot;convex&quot; side is towards
&gt; the outside. But if I get a flat on the rear, I can drive it flat, or
&gt; remove the flat and drive with only one tire in that position. If I
&gt; get a flat in the front, I can move one of the rears up to the front.

"/> The one I was looking at must be non standard. It had what looked like
an odometer in the center of the hub, like I've seen on containers,
counting the km's off I guess. The outside wheel looked more like a
spider that bolted to the inside one. The Ford is as you describe, I'm
not sure what this thing was.

Oh ... and also blew out a left front on the IVECO on I-40 in Kentucky a
couple of years ago. Since it's always loaded to capacity, removing one of
the rears isn't an option. Was a not-really-much-fun ride across the left
lane, and thought we were going to roll it in the center median. Finally
got stopped, but we'd bottomed out the left side far enough that we'd
dragged the reserve tanks on the ground and busted an air line when the
corner of the box body folded up into it.

I found that a bumper jack with a bit of chain can break the bead on
most wheels.
I've done this many a time, as I can't afford to have tires done all
the time.
I used to put the wheel/tire under the bumper, but that doesn't always
work.
There's always a use for those jacks that most people toss out.
I keep a spare bumper jack, a bottle hydraulic, as well as a couple of
other odd jacks, including a scissors jack.
they come in very handy in an emergency... &lt;G&gt; ...

&gt; guys I was wheeling with is the sort who knows somebody everywhere and
&gt; we borrowed an old spare wheel and tire from a local guy and kept on
&gt; wheeling.

&gt; Incidently, I tried demounting and remounting my 15&quot; tires by hand
&gt; just to see if it could be done. Sometimes it can and sometimes it
&gt; can't. I could occaisionally break the bead by driving over the edge
&gt; of it on a board held by an assistant, some tires held fast. Getting
&gt; them off the rim was a battle with 2 guys and prybars. Remounting was
&gt; no picnic either. Some tires worked better than other. Don't count on
&gt; being able to do it out in the bush.

&gt; I am wondering if 16.5&quot; tires might be easier? I'll have to give it

I'm not related to Henry Ford but there are a couple of reasons the spare is
optional on the superduty line.

- the tire rim and hardware weight about 150 pounds sometimes this could be
the difference between getting away with a 250 sd and needing a 350 sd or
paying more for heavier tires or going without the power package to make a
weight capacity. GVWR is very important when you are being checked at the
weigh scales. In most jurisdictions any police officer can pull a suspected
overweight truck over and send it to a weigh scale.

- production runs are simpler if all trucks are built the same way

- there is a center rear gas tank option, if spare was standard there would
be built in parts that could not be deducted from the cost in total.
if you order the special tank you save the 300 for the spare. If a spare was
standard the credit for leaving it out would probably be 75 dollars.

- Fleet purchases are at below cost and contracts for several fleet trucks
are won and lost for 100 dollars let alone 300 for a spare that the buyer
does not need.

A salesman who knows trucks approaches the building in a way that the
customer gets a truck outfitted for his needs. If you refuse to let the
salesman build the truck for you a valuable resource is wasted and you get a
truck without a spare!

When dealing in a very competitive market Ford has consistently managed to
be above the pack in sales volumes. One of the reasons is that they look at
the big picture. You only have to sell one more truck than the other guy to
have a whole year claiming we're number one in truck sales again!

Best regards,
Peter

&gt;Cool, maybe it's fate. What sort of truck is yours and did it end up
&gt;where you are. Where are you?

"/> It's a 12 ton gross cab-over chassis with a van body, four-cylinder turbo
diesel with five speed manual transmission and automatic exhaust brake.

We use it for television production which is why it's loaded to capacity all
the time - a pair of 7.5k Onan generators, two Carrier air conditioners
(residential style compressor units mounted on a shelf in front of the box,
over the cab), four racks full of electronics, power converters, consoles,
VTR's, and all the other various and sundry stuff to make it work.

The truck was originally put together by Shook Electronics in San Antonio,
and calls southwest Oklahoma home now. Closest service center I'm aware of
is Duer's in Fort Worth, used to be a dealer in Richardson, I think, but I
don't know if there's still one there or not.

Basically, IVECO is Fiat's truck division. I actually see quite a few of
them running down the highway in this area with van bodies, so apparently
they were/are pretty popular.

When do you need a spare? - the next time you go out without one. When we
bought our last trailer in 1987, the dealer tried to convince us we didn't
need one &quot;when's the last flat you had&quot; answer never. So we go out on
Memorial day and have a flat on Interstate 40 in Tennessee and nothing
around. After a wild time for 6 hours we finally limped home on a very old
tire. The first thing I did was buy a spare and yup we haven't needed it
since.

&gt;spare is optional on the superduty line.

&gt;- there is a center rear gas tank option, if spare was standard there
&gt;would be built in parts that could not be deducted from the cost in
&gt;total. if you order the special tank you save the 300 for the spare.
&gt;If a spare was standard the credit for leaving it out would probably
&gt;be 75 dollars.

"/> That only applies to the chassis cabs, not the pickups or box-delete
pickups. On pickup trucks, the fuel tank is only located ahead of the
rear axle. That spare tire area is otherwise vacant on a pickup.

OK Guys,

One more time I'm going to try and explain this then I'm going to
shut up about this thread as all I have received is a bunch of &quot; I
should have's &quot; and no help in reaching someone at FORD that might
help me get this straightened out, as I had originally requested.

When I ordered my New FORD Truck, I was given a FORD MOTOR COMPANY
Published propaganda book, specifically for FORD MOTOR COMPANY Trucks,
titled 1999 SUPER DUTY F-SERIES showing a new Black FORD MOTOR COMPANY
SUPERDUTY SUPERCAB PICKUP on the cover. The FORD MOTOR COMPANY Logo
is plainly visible in the upper right hand corner of the cover of the
33 page booklet as well as the rear cover. It is listed as 304-Ann.
Litho in U.S.A. 3/98. One would assume that meant the book was
published in March 1998. Ironically the same month I ordered my new
FORD MOTOR COMPANY SUPERDUTY F250 Pickup.

Tire and Wheel Combinations are listed on page 29 with no mention
of a spare. Features and Options are listed on pages 32 and 33 with no
mention of a spare anywhere. Everything else is listed
though..........yes including the rear bumper.

Now I'm real happy for those of you that are brilliantly educated
to the fact the FORD MOTOR COMPANY does not include a spare tire or
mount for the Heavy Duty Trucks unless you order it but unfortunately
I didn't fit into that Higher IQ Group.

But, let me ask you this question, do you know what desserts that
new restaurant down the street offer and how much they cost or do you
look at the menu ? Of course not, and the Menu given me was a FORD
MOTOR COMPANY MENU for ordering my 1999 FORD MOTOR COMPANY PRODUCED
F250 SUPERDUTY menu, only they left off a few of the toppings.

Thats my bitch, how the hell was I supposed to know to order it if
it is NOT listed on the FORD MOTOR COMPANY PRODUCED MENU ?

I don't blame the dealership directly but I do blame FORD MOTOR
COMPANY for omitting that option.............and would just ask that
they make it right for myself or anyone else that is in the same boat.

Since some of you die hard evaluators of human beings have brought
to my attention, FORD MOTOR COMPANY now has a new menu for ordering
these same FORD MOTOR COMPANY PRODUCED VEHICLES and it has combined
the Regular Duty and Super Duty Trucks together and does list that
spare tire option available. How nice of the FORD MOTOR COMPANY to
recognize their error and correct it.

Trouble is, they gave me the old menu to order from and IT IS NOT
LISTED................................

Hopefully EVERYONE now understands why I'm upset about it.

Still looking for a contact name and number or e-mail address at
FORD MOTOR COMPANY to address my concern to.

Many thanks to those of you that did offer a positive suggestion
to this situation.

&gt;&gt; Hello All,

&gt;&gt; I was really shocked when I discovered my new 1999 SuperDuty F250
&gt;&gt; Ford did not have a spare tire or mount for one. I custom ordered my
&gt;&gt; truck loaded with many extras and waited 7 months to get it. I
&gt;&gt; thought it was just an oversight either from the factory or the
&gt;&gt; dealership.

&gt;&gt; When I contacted the dealer, my salesman told me &quot;oh that's an
&gt;&gt; option&quot; on SuperDuty F series trucks and that I would have to order
&gt;&gt; the parts from the dealership myself.

&gt;&gt; As stated, I ordered that truck piece by piece right from the
&gt;&gt; Ford Superduty Book supplied by my dealership and nowhere in the
&gt;&gt; Features or Options does it list a spare tire or mounting kit. It
&gt;&gt; lists all kinds of superfluous crap like molding, cargo lights, tow
&gt;&gt; hooks, and other non-essential items but NOTHING about the spare
&gt;&gt; tire. I still have the original book I ordered from and after further
&gt;&gt; review, I find that in fact there are several pictures of trucks just
&gt;&gt; like mine showing spare tires installed, with no mention of this being

&gt;It has been that way for years with the heavier duty Fords, my 96 was the
&gt;same way. But I did know to order the spare, which also can mean a
&gt;variety of things. You can get just the carrier. Just the carrier and
&gt;rim, or the whole works. Your dealer SHOULD have known.

For the third time, you don't use a sales brochure to order a truck.
Neither should your salesman. The list of options is either on his/her
computer or if it's some backwoods dealer there are other order forms to
fill out. This is what should have been used to go through the options
available, not the sales brochure. Ridiculous argument you have going
in my opinion.

Actually, Wed. this week... it didn't go flat, cause I saw
it
when I was unhitching my trailer. It was a 1/2&quot; - 3/4&quot;
screw.
I went right down to the tire shop... now I have 4 new
32/11.5x15
tires on the Bronco. That screw wouldn't have made it
through the
new tread. I was going to get the tires anyway within the
next month.
Previous to that I had a flat that I noticed, but was able
to pump
up the tire and drive to the tire dealer to fix. The tires
were
pretty new then. Punctured with a piece for wedge shaped
glass.

I also had a nail in the trailer back in Sept. of this
year...
guess that's what you get for living in a relatively new
development.

"/> Probably, no one has given the advice you are looking for is because no
one has that info either. Don't get mad at everyone because they are no
more informed on this matter than you are. I personally believe you
have a valid complaint. The brochure and/or the dealer should have made
this significant detail very clear. Only in some of the special cases
mentioned in some of the responses on this thread should anyone consider
traveling without a spare. As has been pointed out, dealers always
order their stock with spares. Only an incompetent salesman would omit
it, especially since it increases the sale price and, therefore, his
commission.

I do have a (hopefully useful) suggestion. Go back to the dealer one
more time and try to get them to install the necessary hardware. Based
on the documentation you had and the information provided by their
staff, it should be considered part of the package you ordered. (It is
a good thing you kept the book). They should do this just to maintain
your good will and potential future business, after a purchase of this
size. If they are unwilling to do this, ask them for the address and
phone number of the regional office, and file a complaint with them.
Work your way up to the corporate office if you need to. The regional
office should provide that address/phone number if you ask.

Dealers are dependent on repeat business, and a disgruntled customer can
make a lot of noise. Markups on trucks are big, and they should be
willing to compromise to avoid losing the business of you and your
friends.

Good luck.

1-800-392-FORD, but I've called them numerous times and I can tell you it's
a waste of breath to talk to them. All they say is &quot;Talk to your dealer&quot;.
I even wrote a letter to Ford customer service at the address in the owners
manual and that led to a phone call to me saying &quot;We've received your
concern, stay in touch with your dealer.&quot; BTW, my problem is that the
drivers side trailer tow mirror wide angle section is glued in crooked. The
focal point is the left rear tire, which isn't any help when I'm trying to
see what's behind or to the side of my camper. The passenger mirror is
perfect. Every truck I've looked at is also defective. That's the only
good reason to call Ford's customer &quot;assistance&quot; number; if enough people
call to complain about a defect they might do something about it.

Mike,
There are salesmen and there are truck salesmen. As far as I'm concerned the
salesman owes you. I hope the service isn't as poor. Catalog, brochure,
computer, or verbal you should have been told up front. Like yours is the
first complaint on spares.
Next time look at buying thru your computer, I did. I got a $500 over the
computer published invoice price, the computer lists all options.

&gt;OK Guys,

&gt; One more time I'm going to try and explain this then I'm going to
&gt;shut up about this thread as all I have received is a bunch of &quot; I
&gt;should have's &quot; and no help in reaching someone at FORD that might
&gt;help me get this straightened out, as I had originally requested.

&gt; When I ordered my New FORD Truck, I was given a FORD MOTOR COMPANY
&gt;Published propaganda book, specifically for FORD MOTOR COMPANY Trucks,
&gt;titled 1999 SUPER DUTY F-SERIES showing a new Black FORD MOTOR COMPANY
&gt;SUPERDUTY SUPERCAB PICKUP on the cover. The FORD MOTOR COMPANY Logo
&gt;is plainly visible in the upper right hand corner of the cover of the
&gt;33 page booklet as well as the rear cover. It is listed as 304-Ann.
&gt;Litho in U.S.A. 3/98. One would assume that meant the book was
&gt;published in March 1998. Ironically the same month I ordered my new
&gt;FORD MOTOR COMPANY SUPERDUTY F250 Pickup.

&gt; Tire and Wheel Combinations are listed on page 29 with no mention
&gt;of a spare. Features and Options are listed on pages 32 and 33 with no
&gt;mention of a spare anywhere. Everything else is listed
&gt;though..........yes including the rear bumper.

&gt; Now I'm real happy for those of you that are brilliantly educated
&gt;to the fact the FORD MOTOR COMPANY does not include a spare tire or
&gt;mount for the Heavy Duty Trucks unless you order it but unfortunately
&gt;I didn't fit into that Higher IQ Group.

&gt; But, let me ask you this question, do you know what desserts that
&gt;new restaurant down the street offer and how much they cost or do you
&gt;look at the menu ? Of course not, and the Menu given me was a FORD
&gt;MOTOR COMPANY MENU for ordering my 1999 FORD MOTOR COMPANY PRODUCED
&gt;F250 SUPERDUTY menu, only they left off a few of the toppings.

&gt; Thats my bitch, how the hell was I supposed to know to order it if
&gt;it is NOT listed on the FORD MOTOR COMPANY PRODUCED MENU ?

&gt; I don't blame the dealership directly but I do blame FORD MOTOR
&gt;COMPANY for omitting that option.............and would just ask that
&gt;they make it right for myself or anyone else that is in the same boat.

&gt; Since some of you die hard evaluators of human beings have brought
&gt;to my attention, FORD MOTOR COMPANY now has a new menu for ordering
&gt;these same FORD MOTOR COMPANY PRODUCED VEHICLES and it has combined
&gt;the Regular Duty and Super Duty Trucks together and does list that
&gt;spare tire option available. How nice of the FORD MOTOR COMPANY to
&gt;recognize their error and correct it.

&gt; Trouble is, they gave me the old menu to order from and IT IS NOT
&gt;LISTED................................

&gt; Hopefully EVERYONE now understands why I'm upset about it.

&gt; Still looking for a contact name and number or e-mail address at
&gt;FORD MOTOR COMPANY to address my concern to.

&gt; Many thanks to those of you that did offer a positive suggestion
&gt;to this situation.

&gt; Mike

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hello All,

&gt;&gt;&gt; I was really shocked when I discovered my new 1999 SuperDuty F250
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ford did not have a spare tire or mount for one. I custom ordered my
&gt;&gt;&gt; truck loaded with many extras and waited 7 months to get it. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; thought it was just an oversight either from the factory or the
&gt;&gt;&gt; dealership.

&gt;&gt;&gt; When I contacted the dealer, my salesman told me &quot;oh that's an
&gt;&gt;&gt; option&quot; on SuperDuty F series trucks and that I would have to order
&gt;&gt;&gt; the parts from the dealership myself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As stated, I ordered that truck piece by piece right from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ford Superduty Book supplied by my dealership and nowhere in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Features or Options does it list a spare tire or mounting kit. It
&gt;&gt;&gt; lists all kinds of superfluous crap like molding, cargo lights, tow
&gt;&gt;&gt; hooks, and other non-essential items but NOTHING about the spare
&gt;&gt;&gt; tire. I still have the original book I ordered from and after further
&gt;&gt;&gt; review, I find that in fact there are several pictures of trucks just
&gt;&gt;&gt; like mine showing spare tires installed, with no mention of this being

&gt;&gt;&gt; If not, who has a name and phone number or e-mail address for a
&gt;&gt;&gt; FORD Customer Service Rep that I can speak too ?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks in Advance to all Information pertaining to this issue,

&gt;&gt;&gt; Michael
&gt;&gt;&gt; Florida

&gt;&gt;It has been that way for years with the heavier duty Fords, my 96 was the
&gt;&gt;same way. But I did know to order the spare, which also can mean a
&gt;&gt;variety of things. You can get just the carrier. Just the carrier and
&gt;&gt;rim, or the whole works. Your dealer SHOULD have known.

It is an option: Part 512, Spare Tire &amp; Wheel, $213 - $272, (depending

I never said it was the customers fault. But it isn't Ford Motor
Companys fault either. It was the salesperson/dealers fault. Hell, I
had a salesman tell me a F250 he had for sale had a trailer tow package
with class 4 hitch and after I drove 250 miles to look at it I found out
his idea of a hitch was a farmers bumper. Should I sue Ford for his
error?

I am a dealer. We have learned over the years to NEVER order
vehicles from sales brochures because they are ordered too far in advance of
any last minute changes from Ford. Not to mention any mistakes made in
printing. We have ordering guides that list all options and codes to use
that are much more accurate. Your salesman should go down this list for
every vehicle that is ordered to eliminate this type of problem.
The reason a spare tire is optional is that numerous truck buyers
install spring loaded bumpers with hitches on their trucks. These heavy duty
bumpers have a spring to cushion the back and forth jolts of the item being
towed. This spring intrudes into the area where the spare tire would be
located. The dealers in agricultural areas especially have asked the factory
to make spare tires and rear bumpers optional to accomodate these buyers.
They are becoming less popular in recent years and I believe the factory
will eventually make these items standard.

inflate the spare tire some more, then got a new tire in SLC. On the
road again in about 2 hours, total.

The base plate of the jack is placed on the tire, up against the rim,

Then I carefully pump the jack till it breaks the bead away from the

Repeat for the other side of the tire.
The under car method was similar, but used the weight of the car.
This didn't always work well with wheels with what are known as safety
rims(to prevent tire from rolling off rim in case of flat.

Oh yes, be sure to use heavy chain and a good bolt through the chain

I had three flat tyres on my last long trip into the Kimberley region
in north-western Australia. I also carried a tyre repair kit and compressor.
All three of these tyres were thrown away after they had their sidewalls
slashed out by sharp rocks!

I carried two spares all of the time, and have only once had to change a
tyre on a rim (and no, I don't have split rims). This was a &quot;learning
experience&quot; on a hot day, beside a dusty track. Only one other vehicle
passed by in the 3 1/2 hours we spent in total there. Go to:

http://www.netspace.net.au/~bmiller/gallery/CapeYork/

To read all about my &quot;Worst Day&quot;. :-)

Out of 5 tyres we bought for a Trip to Cape York a few years ago, we only
have two of them left, and one has had a puncture. The other three have been
thrown away with pleanty of tread after suffering horrendous damage. Also,
a tyre with only 1000 Kilometers on it had a sidewall slashed by a rock
on another trip.

I think I'll always carry a spare!

While touring the outback you get to hear a lot of stories about tyre
problems; like the family who got 6 flat tyres in 700 Km in their LandCruiser.
(It was one of thise 80 series that came out with the far-to-road-oriented
Dunlop GrandTreks that went flat even if someone looked at them the wrong
way.) Apparently he used ALL of the spares on the two other vehicles he
was traveling with, along with his own two spares.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll go first.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I had a flat last spring. I ran over a nail. BTW, I have yet to see a

I can't help you in dealing with Ford, but here's a possible solution.
Try filing a complaint with the BBB and your state's Attorney General
(or equivalent). In my opinion, any item that is standard equipment on
a propensity of vehicles, but not on a particular line, should be
pointed
out by the dealer. He's the expert, not you. I'd try filing complaints
against both Ford Motor Company and the dealership. Could be nothing
will happen, but it costs you a couple of phone calls to request the
forms and a couple of stamps to mail them back. Disreputable companies
tend to blow these off, but reputable companies tend to react strongly
and positively to them. If nothing else, it may tell you something
about the dealership.

&gt; OK Guys,

&gt; One more time I'm going to try and explain this then I'm going to
&gt; shut up about this thread as all I have received is a bunch of &quot; I
&gt; should have's &quot; and no help in reaching someone at FORD that might
&gt; help me get this straightened out, as I had originally requested.

&gt; When I ordered my New FORD Truck, I was given a FORD MOTOR COMPANY
&gt; Published propaganda book, specifically for FORD MOTOR COMPANY Trucks,
&gt; titled 1999 SUPER DUTY F-SERIES showing a new Black FORD MOTOR COMPANY
&gt; SUPERDUTY SUPERCAB PICKUP on the cover. The FORD MOTOR COMPANY Logo
&gt; is plainly visible in the upper right hand corner of the cover of the
&gt; 33 page booklet as well as the rear cover. It is listed as 304-Ann.
&gt; Litho in U.S.A. 3/98. One would assume that meant the book was
&gt; published in March 1998. Ironically the same month I ordered my new
&gt; FORD MOTOR COMPANY SUPERDUTY F250 Pickup.

&gt; Tire and Wheel Combinations are listed on page 29 with no mention
&gt; of a spare. Features and Options are listed on pages 32 and 33 with no
&gt; mention of a spare anywhere. Everything else is listed
&gt; though..........yes including the rear bumper.

&gt; Now I'm real happy for those of you that are brilliantly educated
&gt; to the fact the FORD MOTOR COMPANY does not include a spare tire or
&gt; mount for the Heavy Duty Trucks unless you order it but unfortunately
&gt; I didn't fit into that Higher IQ Group.

&gt; But, let me ask you this question, do you know what desserts that
&gt; new restaurant down the street offer and how much they cost or do you
&gt; look at the menu ? Of course not, and the Menu given me was a FORD
&gt; MOTOR COMPANY MENU for ordering my 1999 FORD MOTOR COMPANY PRODUCED
&gt; F250 SUPERDUTY menu, only they left off a few of the toppings.

&gt; Thats my bitch, how the hell was I supposed to know to order it if
&gt; it is NOT listed on the FORD MOTOR COMPANY PRODUCED MENU ?

&gt; I don't blame the dealership directly but I do blame FORD MOTOR
&gt; COMPANY for omitting that option.............and would just ask that
&gt; they make it right for myself or anyone else that is in the same boat.

&gt; Since some of you die hard evaluators of human beings have brought
&gt; to my attention, FORD MOTOR COMPANY now has a new menu for ordering
&gt; these same FORD MOTOR COMPANY PRODUCED VEHICLES and it has combined
&gt; the Regular Duty and Super Duty Trucks together and does list that
&gt; spare tire option available. How nice of the FORD MOTOR COMPANY to
&gt; recognize their error and correct it.

&gt; Trouble is, they gave me the old menu to order from and IT IS NOT
&gt; LISTED................................

&gt; Hopefully EVERYONE now understands why I'm upset about it.

&gt; Still looking for a contact name and number or e-mail address at
&gt; FORD MOTOR COMPANY to address my concern to.

&gt; Many thanks to those of you that did offer a positive suggestion
&gt; to this situation.

&gt; Mike

"/>  I'm hoping on this thread a little late but I think I can offer some
information that will help.
Even though the spare tire was not listed as an option I don't think you
will get far by blaming FOMOCO for this. I'm sure that somewhere in that
brochure there is a disclaimer that deals with mistakes and changes, and in
the end the responsibility falls on the dealer.
The salesman at the dealership should have sat down with you and gone over
all the options with you as he filled out the order. IMHO it was the
salesman's responsibility to inform you that the spare tire was an option and
ask you if you wanted it.
The first thing you should do is talk to the General Sales Manager at the
dealership you bought the truck from. It is most likely that he will want you
to buy your next truck from him so he will offer to work something out with
you. He should be willing to sell you the carrier, tire and wheel at cost.
If the dealer is unwilling to help you, you should talk to the dealerships
Corporate Rep. If they will not give you contact information, you should be
able to get it from Ford Customer Service. This person will have a great deal
of influence with dealing with the dealership and may even be able to get you
help from ford.
If it comes down to you having to buy it ant put it on yourself,
installing the carrier is a simple 5 minute job.
Hope this helps,

Steve- Sounds to me like a reasonable angle to pursue is to ask the dealer to sell
ya the spare, mount and whatever for the same price you would have paid if added
to your original order- and they install it as the factory would have.

You wind up paying no more than you would have originally, they are out a little
labor. The dealer can probably get Ford to cover/share the labor under a goodwill
adjustment. You're done! Good luck! JN

I just ordered a Super Duty F350 and not trusting dealers at all I went to
www.kbb.com  and priced out my truck. It is very clear there that the spare
is an option. I also used their Dealer Invoice price to get the price I
wanted for my truck. If you know the dealer gets a 3% (of MSRP) Holdback you
can get the truck at near invoice. I got mine for a little over $100 over
invoice.

Dear new Ford owner.

I know exactly what you mean. Recently, my father and I installed a spare
tire mount into a F250 truck. An unsuspecting customer purchased that
vehicle and had us install the mount for them at our shop. I think that the
person made enough noise to get one for free!

Hello All,

Well many of you followed this thread over the past couple of
weeks and I felt it only fair to post the results of my endeavor.

My hats off to FORD Motor Company and my local dealer, Sam
Galloway Ford in Fort Myers Florida.

I was notified today that Ford Motor Company and Sam Galloway
Ford have agreed that there was an omission in the book I was given to
order from and jointly they will be supplying me with the Spare Tire,
Wheel, Carrier, and Mounting Kit, including installation.

Since I have already upgraded the tires on my truck to a larger
size, I wanted to be fair and agreed that I would purchase my own
spare tire. This works out to be about 1/3 of the total price.

Now you can understand why just this year, FORD Sales have
increased while GM has decreased.

So, You Really Can't Afford Not To Drive a Ford..............

Thanks to all who offered solutions to this problem.

Good to hear that a Ford dealership has agreed to do the right thing for
a change - the one in Folsom, CA (Folsom Lake Ford) would have laughed
you off the property. You wouldn't believe just how bad a dealership
they really are.

Incidentally, if anyone reading this is considering a visit to Folsom
Lake Ford, Email me at j ... @encompass.net if you want the straight story
on this outfit. It isn't pretty.

Glad things worked out well for you. Wish we had more businesses like
Galloway here in central CA.

"/> It would be nice if they had put a full-sized bed on the Super Duty
line. Instead, they have shrunk the tailgate opening down to a puny 60
inches. Even a Chevy has a 60 inch opening.

My current lift gate on my F350 has a 64 inch opening. I absolutely
need 63 inches of the opening. I don't want a toy pickup.

I think Ford blew a major competitive advantage here - after 88, GM
shrunk the opening in the lighter pickups. Dodge did the same when they
restyled theirs. GM screwed up their heavier pickups later. Ford then
screwed up the F150. The F250 and F350 through 97 were the only pickups
with a full-sized box.

Ford decided to play lemming on this item and screw up the heavier
trucks for the 99 model. If you have a full-sized lift gate, or a
slide-in camper where the siding fills the opening, or any other need
for a full-sized box, Ford has hosed you and themselves.

An electrical contractor I know just bought a fleet of Chevy pickups
since Ford made that change. Since Ford screwed him by forcing him to
replace all his lift gates, he thought Ford also deserved a screwing.

I'll keep the old one going for a lot longer than Ford would like,
since they quit building suitable replacements.

&gt;&gt; I was really shocked when I discovered my new 1999 SuperDuty F250
&gt;&gt;Ford did not have a spare tire or mount for one. I custom ordered my
&gt;&gt;truck loaded with many extras and waited 7 months to get it. I
&gt;&gt;thought it was just an oversight either from the factory or the
&gt;&gt;dealership.

&gt;&gt; When I contacted the dealer, my salesman told me &quot;oh that's an
&gt;&gt;option&quot; on SuperDuty F series trucks and that I would have to order
&gt;&gt;the parts from the dealership myself.

Using your logic GM sales should have gone through the roof. GM puts a spare
and antilock brakes as STANDARD EQUIPMENT on all pickups.

When your looking for a new truck, take the old on and get the trade in
value on paper, then take off the deb and trade it in, telling them you need
it for the new one :)

&gt;&gt; Hey thanxs for the info we are about to buy a new F-350 and appreciate
&gt;&gt; knowing the spare tire is not included is there any other information a
bout
&gt;&gt; the truck that you feel is important (options to or not to get...)?

&gt;It would be nice if they had put a full-sized bed on the Super Duty
&gt;line. Instead, they have shrunk the tailgate opening down to a puny 60
&gt;inches. Even a Chevy has a 60 inch opening.

&gt;My current lift gate on my F350 has a 64 inch opening. I absolutely
&gt;need 63 inches of the opening. I don't want a toy pickup.

&gt;I think Ford blew a major competitive advantage here - after 88, GM
&gt;shrunk the opening in the lighter pickups. Dodge did the same when they
&gt;restyled theirs. GM screwed up their heavier pickups later. Ford then
&gt;screwed up the F150. The F250 and F350 through 97 were the only pickups
&gt;with a full-sized box.

&gt;Ford decided to play lemming on this item and screw up the heavier
&gt;trucks for the 99 model. If you have a full-sized lift gate, or a
&gt;slide-in camper where the siding fills the opening, or any other need
&gt;for a full-sized box, Ford has hosed you and themselves.

&gt;An electrical contractor I know just bought a fleet of Chevy pickups
&gt;since Ford made that change. Since Ford screwed him by forcing him to
&gt;replace all his lift gates, he thought Ford also deserved a screwing.

&gt;I'll keep the old one going for a lot longer than Ford would like,
&gt;since they quit building suitable replacements.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well I think that's pure bullshit and I'm pissed.............

&gt;&gt;&gt; Who in their right mind would order a $35,000.00 truck and not
&gt;&gt;&gt;expect to get a spare tire ?

I know exactly what you mean! My father and I run Custom Creations, an audio
shop here in Hemet California. We also do work for the local dealership. A
customer came into our shop requesting us to install a spare tire mount on
their brand new truck...I couldn't believe that Ford would stoop so low as to
not include a spare tire mount! 600 dollars! For what? What are you getting
that cost so much, that they couldn't fit into their budget...to give you a
mount? What a deal eh?! I think that the customer made enough noise down at
the dealership that they got the mount for free...or at least as part of the
lease agreement! In the end, they'll probably pay $2,000 for it!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well I think that's pure bullshit and I'm pissed.............

&gt;&gt;&gt; As stated, I ordered that truck piece by piece right from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ford Superduty Book supplied by my dealership and nowhere in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Features or Options does it list a spare tire or mounting kit. It
&gt;&gt;&gt; lists all kinds of superfluous crap like molding, cargo lights, tow
&gt;&gt;&gt; hooks, and other non-essential items but NOTHING about the spare
&gt;&gt;&gt; tire. I still have the original book I ordered from and after further
&gt;&gt;&gt; review, I find that in fact there are several pictures of trucks just
&gt;&gt;&gt; like mine showing spare tires installed, with no mention of this being
&gt;&gt;&gt; an option.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Who in their right mind would order a $35,000.00 truck and not
&gt;&gt;&gt; expect to get a spare tire ?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm open to suggestions and I hope that if other people have had
&gt;&gt;&gt; this problem, there is already a solution from FORD to address it.

I don't know the history of this discussion, but Ford has used a &quot;build
your own truck&quot;
type of ordering for many years. When I ordered an E-150 Van I had to
order every
feature separately. The standard van had only the drivers seat (no
passenger seat
in the front), no spare, no windows in the rear or side doors, no trim
or insulation
throughout the van, and the bumpers and grill were painted flat grey
(not chrome).
This worked very well for ordering a work truck, because the purchaser
only had to buy
exactly what he needed. However, it made ordering more complicated and
I was very
dependent on getting a good truck salesman who knew what needed to be
ordered.

Ordering a heavy duty truck is different than ordering a car or a
light-duty
truck like a Ranger or Explorer. I think the dealer screwed up the
order, but it was
probably due to lack of training on the part of the salesman. In
general, Ford provides
very good ordering guides for trucks, but the salesman has to know how
to read them
and use them.

Or just go to:

http://carpoint.msn.com/thisweek

This site essentially won't let you pick the options that the
manufacture won't provide (that is - that is not compatible). It's very
interesting selecting the different engines vs drive trains, towing
packages etc. and you guessed it even Fords persnickity spare tire
options.
