I once was told (not sure of the source) that the engineers at Abbey
Road would wire the speakers on the Beatles Vox AC-30 amps out of
phase, meaning one speaker would be in phase, and the other out. Any
truth to this? I'm not sure of the purpose in doing this, other than
to get a thinner brighter sound out of the amp (sorta like out of
phase guitar pickups). I haven't read the 'Recording the Beatles' book
yet, but maybe they discuss it in there.

Just had a look at the website. How really beautiful. But 100 USD
(suppposedly plus another 50 for P&amp;P to Europe) is an awful lot of
money. Let's hope the &quot;non-deluxe&quot; version they mention will be
available soon.

As Far as I can remember Geoff Emerick did not mention it in
his book - here there and everywhere my life recording the
Beatles.

People do all sorts of strange things in the studio in search for a
different sound. It's quite possible that it was done on occasion. It
would have little or no effect if a single mic was placed close to one
speaker, but it might cause some cancellation at a distance which
could be useful in two ways. It can change the sound of the amplifier
picked up by a distant mic, with the sound varying with distance in a
different way than with the speakers in phase. Alternately, careful
placement could reduce leakage of the amplifier into another mic in
the studio due to cancellation in a useful frequency range at a point
in space.

By the way, phase is always relative to something, so what we have is
one speaker out of phase with respect to the other speaker. I said,
jokingly, in a thread about the interpretation of decibels &quot;want to
talk about phase?&quot; and here we are. Everyone needs a straight man.

Does that mean we can get niggly and demand you talk about polarity?
Phase is something quite different. It only looks similar for a sine
wave.

I have the book. It's fantastic. I'm not even half way through, but
you learn a lot about the nuts and bolts of what was happening at the
time. A labour of love, to be sure.

I was told that some Marshall cabs are already wired this way. I haven't

So the cliche of a power-chord blasting the guitarist off the stage is false
then ? Only half of him would go forward, the other half would be sucked
backwards.....

That explains why a lot of guitar players only play &quot;half-assed&quot; :-)

Dunno about the Beatles, but a well known axe player (forgot who) used
12&quot; and 10&quot; drivers wired polarity reversed.

Should result in unpredictable multipoint partial phase-cansellation
comb-filter effects (is that an accepted tech phrase?).

Actually the response of different speaker models is so jagged and different through most
of the range that just using 2 different speakers (of similar efficiency) could create
interesting effects. But if it were me I'd wire them in-phase / in-polarity, and if I
wanted less bass I'd turn down the knob. But, taking this a bit further , some other
interesting effects can be had by using 2 amps, and even feeding them from different
guitar  pickups, separately to the final stereo channels. I have a couple of guitars wired
for stereo for that reason.
