A, because so many of them are on such high amphetamine and steroid doses
that their nutritional requirements are dramatically increased.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

A. They traditionally were meats, fruits, vegetables, and grains and cereals.
However with the improvements in food technology we have added the &quot;soybean
byproduct&quot; and &quot;petroleum derived&quot; food groups.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;___  3. Dietary fiber is

&gt;           b. chemically the same as crude fiber
&gt;           c. unaffected by food processing &amp; cooking
&gt;           d. an important source of trace elements
">

All of the above!  Carbon and glass fibres are important to your dietary
regimen, and they are unchanged by cooking.  Not only that, they pass
unchanged through your digestive tract (because they are a heterogeneous
mix of indegestible substances) so you can just wash them afterwards and
reuse them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The answer is obviously C., as anyone who has seen the behaviour of children
after eating Sugar Bombs breakfast cereal will attest.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;___  5. Carbohydrates may contribute to current nutrition
&gt;             problems when
&gt;             a. they provide indigestible fiber

&gt;             c. sugar intake is over 125 gm/day
&gt;             d. they are stored as glycogen
">

C. You can be sure that eating two ounces of refined sugar every day is
ad for you.  Note the behaviour of the children described above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;___  6. In order to oxidize fats adequately the diet must
&gt;             contain ____ gm carbohydrates
&gt;             a. 20-25
&gt;             b. 40-50
&gt;             c. 70-100
&gt;             d. 125-150
">

Trick question: you don't need carbohydrates to oxidize fat.  You can do
it easily won the barbequeue grill.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;___  7. &quot;Saturated&quot; &amp; &quot;unsaturated&quot; refer strictly to
&gt;             a. how solid a fat is at room temperature
&gt;             b. the number of double bonds in a fatty acid
&gt;             c. the animal or vegetable origin of a fat
&gt;             d. the number of calories provided by oxidation
">

D.  The origin of the phrase is in the German language, in which a person
who feels replete and overly full after a meal is said to be &quot;saturated.&quot;
Thus, a saturated fat is one that will make you feel very full.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;___  8. Aside from supplying essential fatty acids, fat is
&gt;             necessary in the diet to
&gt;           a. suppress liver cholesterol production &amp; plaque
&gt;           b. increase excretion of fat-soluble toxins
&gt;           c. increase gastric &amp; intestinal motility
&gt;           d. aid in the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients
">

Obviously the answer is C.  If you don't get enough fat in your diet, you
becomes extremely constipated.  Everybody who has eaten a big meal of
lean meat and potatoes knows this.  Fat acts as a sort of lubricant to help
it all go through.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;             a. is equal to that of fat
&gt;             b. is half that of protein
&gt;             c. exceeds that of carbohydrates
&gt;             d. depends on prior consumption

D.  For example, my uncle has been drinking whiskey for fifty years now
and he needs to drink almost a whole quart in order to feel the same amount
of energy that I feel from a single glass of wine.

&gt;              b. 0.1
&gt;              c. 0.2
&gt;              d. 0.4

Again, this is a trick question because it doesn't say what KIND of alcohol
it is.  The body can metabolize ethanol much faster than methanol or isopropanol
for instance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;___ 11. A symptom of an essential fatty acid deficiency
&gt;              is:

&gt;              b. hair color changes
&gt;              c. eczema
&gt;              d. loss of hearing

B.  You need to regularly condition your hair with fatty acids, otherwise
it will become dull and lifeless.  This is addressed in recent Prell

&gt;              b. 45
&gt;              c. 30

A.  People with cardiovascular disease should always trim the fat from their
steak and should NEVER drink lard martinis, except maybe on special occasions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

D. That's right, if you consume too little protein, you get beri-beri and
die, but when was the last time you ever heard of anyone dying of beri-beri?

&gt;              a. antibodies
&gt;              b. enzymes
&gt;              c. hormones

D.  If you are growing and developing too much, in fact you should probably
reduce your protein intake.

&gt;              a. egg
&gt;              b. meat
&gt;              c. soybeans
&gt;              d. wheat

C.  Everybody knows soybeans are the key to health and weight loss, now that
oat bran has been discredited.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;___ 19. The absorption of long-chain fatty acids differs from
&gt;            that of most other nutrients in that these products
&gt;               a. are absorbed into the lymphatic system
&gt;               b. must be further degraded before absorption
&gt;               c. are recombined in the intestinal mucosa
&gt;               d. inhibit absorption of other nutrients
">

D. This is why mercury contamination of fish is not a problem.  The fat in
the fish inhibits your absorption of heavy metals.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;___ 20. The lining of the digestive tract is replaced completely
&gt;               in about
&gt;               a. 12 hours
&gt;               b. 1 1/2 days
&gt;               c. 5 days
&gt;               d. 1 week

This is a trick question because it depends on whether you ate chile con carne
with those little red peppers or not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

A. If you do not eat, in fact your metabolic rate will drop to zero.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;___ 22. Which of the following is a low energy density food?
&gt;              a. dried apricots
&gt;              b. spinach

D. Mayo is extremely low density and will float in water while all the other
food products listed will sink.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;___ 23. &quot;You can eat all the protein you want &amp; never get fat.&quot;
&gt;              This statement is
&gt;             a. false because high-protein foods are usually high
&gt;                 in fat
&gt;             b. true because the body diverts amino acids to

D. This is easy to prove... you will notice that protein is very difficult
to burn whereas fats contain so much energy that they burn easily.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;             c. the animal or vegetable origin of a fat
&gt;&gt;             d. the number of calories provided by oxidation

&gt; D.  The origin of the phrase is in the German language, in which a person
&gt; who feels replete and overly full after a meal is said to be &quot;saturated.&quot;
&gt; Thus, a saturated fat is one that will make you feel very full.

&gt;&gt; ___  8. Aside from supplying essential fatty acids, fat is
&gt;&gt;             necessary in the diet to
&gt;&gt;           a. suppress liver cholesterol production &amp; plaque
&gt;&gt;           b. increase excretion of fat-soluble toxins
&gt;&gt;           c. increase gastric &amp; intestinal motility
&gt;&gt;           d. aid in the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients

&gt; Obviously the answer is C.  If you don't get enough fat in your diet, you
&gt; becomes extremely constipated.  Everybody who has eaten a big meal of
&gt; lean meat and potatoes knows this.  Fat acts as a sort of lubricant to help
&gt; it all go through.

&gt;&gt; ___  9. The energy value of alcohol
&gt;&gt;             a. is equal to that of fat
&gt;&gt;             b. is half that of protein
&gt;&gt;             c. exceeds that of carbohydrates
&gt;&gt;             d. depends on prior consumption

&gt; D.  For example, my uncle has been drinking whiskey for fifty years now
&gt; and he needs to drink almost a whole quart in order to feel the same amount
&gt; of energy that I feel from a single glass of wine.

&gt;&gt; ___ 10. The liver can metabolize alcohol at the rate of
&gt;&gt;               ___ g/kg of body weight/hr.
&gt;&gt;              a. 0.05
&gt;&gt;              b. 0.1
&gt;&gt;              c. 0.2
&gt;&gt;              d. 0.4

&gt; Again, this is a trick question because it doesn't say what KIND of alcohol
&gt; it is.  The body can metabolize ethanol much faster than methanol or isopropanol
&gt; for instance.

&gt;&gt; ___ 11. A symptom of an essential fatty acid deficiency
&gt;&gt;              is:
&gt;&gt;              a. anemia
&gt;&gt;              b. hair color changes
&gt;&gt;              c. eczema
&gt;&gt;              d. loss of hearing

&gt; B.  You need to regularly condition your hair with fatty acids, otherwise
&gt; it will become dull and lifeless.  This is addressed in recent Prell
&gt; commercials.

&gt;&gt; ___ 12. It is recommended that individuals who are at
&gt;&gt;            high risk for cardiovascular disease reduce their
&gt;&gt;            fat intake to ___% of their calories.
&gt;&gt;              a. 50
&gt;&gt;              b. 45
&gt;&gt;              c. 30
&gt;&gt;              d. 0

&gt; A.  People with cardiovascular disease should always trim the fat from their
&gt; steak and should NEVER drink lard martinis, except maybe on special occasions.

&gt;&gt; ___ 13. Proteins differ from fats &amp; carbohydrates in that
&gt;&gt;            proteins
&gt;&gt;            a. provide fewer calories per gram than fats &amp;
&gt;&gt;                carbohydrates
&gt;&gt;            b. contain nitrogen &amp; sulfur in their structure
&gt;&gt;            c. if taken in excess, are not converted to fat
&gt;&gt;            d. are rarely consumed in quantities below
&gt;&gt;                 requirements

&gt; D. That's right, if you consume too little protein, you get beri-beri and
&gt; die, but when was the last time you ever heard of anyone dying of beri-beri?

&gt;&gt; ___ 14. For which nonprotein body constituent may dietary
&gt;&gt;              protein provide building blocks?
&gt;&gt;              a. antibodies
&gt;&gt;              b. enzymes
&gt;&gt;              c. hormones
&gt;&gt;              d. nucleic acids

&gt; B. Everybody knows the body is made out of enzymes.  Haven't you read the
&gt; Hollywood Diet?

&gt;&gt; ___ 15. Protein quality is determined by the
&gt;&gt;           a. quantity of sulfur-containing &amp; aromatic amino acids
&gt;&gt;           b. complementation of foods of animal &amp; plant origin
&gt;&gt;           c. supply of essential amino acids in proportion to need
&gt;&gt;           d. quantity of total nitrogen supplied in relation to need

&gt; B.  For example, steak is higher quality than hamburger, because it isn't
&gt; ground up.

&gt;&gt; ___ 16. Under which of the following circumstances would
&gt;&gt;            dietary protein requirements be increased LEAST?
&gt;&gt;              a. heavy muscular work
&gt;&gt;              b. pregnancy &amp; lactation
&gt;&gt;              c. recovery from surgery
&gt;&gt;              d. growth &amp; development

&gt; D.  If you are growing and developing too much, in fact you should probably
&gt; reduce your protein intake.

&gt;&gt; ___ 17. A safe protein recommendation is ___% of total
&gt;&gt;              calories.
&gt;&gt;              a.  5-10
&gt;&gt;              b. 10-15
&gt;&gt;              c. 15-20
&gt;&gt;              d. 20-25

&gt; B.  If you consume more than this you will develop bad breath.

&gt;&gt; ___ 18. The best mixture of natural protein has been found
&gt;&gt;            in
&gt;&gt;              a. egg
&gt;&gt;              b. meat
&gt;&gt;              c. soybeans
&gt;&gt;              d. wheat

&gt; C.  Everybody knows soybeans are the key to health and weight loss, now that
&gt; oat bran has been discredited.

&gt;&gt; ___ 19. The absorption of long-chain fatty acids differs from
&gt;&gt;            that of most other nutrients in that these products
&gt;&gt;               a. are absorbed into the lymphatic system
&gt;&gt;               b. must be further degraded before absorption
&gt;&gt;               c. are recombined in the intestinal mucosa
&gt;&gt;               d. inhibit absorption of other nutrients

&gt; D. This is why mercury contamination of fish is not a problem.  The fat in
&gt; the fish inhibits your absorption of heavy metals.

&gt;&gt; ___ 20. The lining of the digestive tract is replaced completely
&gt;&gt;               in about
&gt;&gt;               a. 12 hours
&gt;&gt;               b. 1 1/2 days
&gt;&gt;               c. 5 days
&gt;&gt;               d. 1 week

&gt; This is a trick question because it depends on whether you ate chile con carne
&gt; with those little red peppers or not.

&gt;&gt; ___ 21. Dietary-induced thermogenesis (DIT) refers to the
&gt;&gt;          a. rise in the metabolic rate as a consequence of eating
&gt;&gt;          b. increased fat breakdown for heat production during
&gt;&gt;              starvation
&gt;&gt;          c. production of fat for insulation following meal ingestion
&gt;&gt;          d. increase in the basal metabolic rate due to overeating

&gt; A. If you do not eat, in fact your metabolic rate will drop to zero.

&gt;&gt; ___ 22. Which of the following is a low energy density food?
&gt;&gt;              a. dried apricots
&gt;&gt;              b. spinach
&gt;&gt;              c. nuts
&gt;&gt;              d. mayonnaise

&gt; D. Mayo is extremely low density and will float in water while all the other
&gt; food products listed will sink.

&gt;&gt; ___ 23. &quot;You can eat all the protein you want &amp; never get fat.&quot;
&gt;&gt;              This statement is
&gt;&gt;             a. false because high-protein foods are usually high
&gt;&gt;                 in fat
&gt;&gt;             b. true because the body diverts amino acids to
&gt;&gt;                 anabolism
&gt;&gt;             c. false because the amino acids can be converted
&gt;&gt;                 to fat precursors
&gt;&gt;             d. true because protein has a calorie value half that
&gt;&gt;                 of fat

&gt; D. This is easy to prove... you will notice that protein is very difficult
&gt; to burn whereas fats contain so much energy that they burn easily.

&gt;&gt; ___ 24. The most consistent difference between obese people
