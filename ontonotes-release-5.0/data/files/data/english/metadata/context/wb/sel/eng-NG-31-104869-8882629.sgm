Rancor rules prison guard negotiations Union, governor locked in battle over who's in charge of system. By Andy Furillo - Bee Capitol Bureau
Published 12:00 am PDT Sunday, September 30, 2007    Mike Jimenez walked into the hotel suite ready to erupt.
His union, the California Correctional Peace Officers Association, had been working without a contract for nearly a month. With less than three weeks remaining before the 2006 Legislature adjourned for the year, he needed a deal if his 31,000 members were going to get a raise anytime soon.
When he and the chief negotiator for the state, Dennis Batchelder, sparred over ground rules for the ongoing talks, Jimenez exploded. By the time the nine-minute session ended, the union president had dropped the F-bomb 12 times.
&quot;Dennis, I'm through playing,&quot; Jimenez said, according to a transcript of the July 31, 2006, session at the Governor's Inn on Richards Boulevard. &quot;If you don't want a deal, let's call it like it is and get the ... out of here. ... Go tell your boss, ... him. You can tell the governor, ... him.&quot;
More than a year later, the rancor that permeated the hotel suite has continued to define CCPOA's negotiations with the state. Talks deteriorated into an official declaration of impasse, sought by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Department of Personnel Administration and certified by his Public Employment Relations Board. Negotiations went into mediation, and when they broke down, the administration unilaterally implemented its last contract offer.
The failed labor negotiations sprang from a relationship between the union and the Schwarzenegger administration that has been deteriorating for more than three years. Mostly, though, the contract fight is coming down to one issue: Who's in charge of the state's prison system?
&quot;I think it's a major power play that's going on right now,&quot; said Joshua Page, an assistant sociology professor at the University of Minnesota who wrote his doctoral thesis at UC Berkeley on the CCPOA.
From the outset, he said, the administration has sought to reverse what it sees as excessive union influence. The union, on the other hand, doesn't want to return to an era of &quot;managers running rampant and having complete authority and discretion.&quot;
&quot;It's important for the union practically and symbolically to maintain these things in the contract that they've worked 20 years to get,&quot; Page said.
It's just as important, state negotiators say, for them to get them back. The result: a dysfunctional labor-management relationship. Anger, respect issues and politics have marked the breakdown, with several key dates illustrating the failures.
The acrimonyWith the two sides already off to a miserable start, the old contract expired on July 2, 2006.
Less than a month earlier, the CCPOA negotiating team had tried to videotape one of the first bargaining sessions. The state's team responded by walking out.
Jimenez then leveled his July 31 blast, only one in a series of expressions of the union's animosity. Union officials would accuse the state of secretly taping a negotiating session, a charge the opponents denied. They would oppose confirmation of Schwarzenegger's pick to run the Department of Personnel Administration, David Gilb, with Jimenez calling him and his agency &quot;dishonorable and dishonest.&quot;
The state Senate ultimately approved Gilb, a veteran of more than 20 years of state labor negotiations who said he's never seen a worse bargaining environment.
&quot;I've been in this business a long time, and I'm used to a certain element of that,&quot; Gilb said. &quot;Generally speaking, it's part of what you sign in on. But I think the level of invective and the (language) stuff has probably been as high as I have ever seen.&quot;
CCPOA came into the talks with three years of bitterness built up against Schwarzenegger. The governor's first corrections secretary accused the union of perpetuating a &quot;code of silence,&quot; where officers cover up for one another. His administration, after getting $108 million in salary concessions from the union, then changed details on a verbal deal that would have allowed more correctional supervisors to pick their own jobs.
In a TV speech the next year, Schwarzenegger suggested that prison cops weren't much better than the criminals they guarded. Then he tried to change the pension system and make it harder for public employee unions to spend their members' dues money on politics.
With contract talks sputtering, Jimenez said he walked into the July 31 session &quot;a little bit tight.&quot;
&quot;I thought they were playing games,&quot; he said.
A couple of dozen negotiating sessions over the next 14 months totaled only 24 hours of face time between the parties. Mediation failed. A key snag: the pay scale of the California Highway Patrol.
The CHP spreadAn arbitrator's ruling on Nov. 18, 2006, gave the CCPOA a 3.125 percent pay raise four months after its contract expired, thanks to a contract formula that linked their pay to the Highway Patrol's.
The unanticipated raise blew the governor's budget by $290 million and helped cement the administration's idea that it was time to get rid of the formula for the CCPOA.
In three rounds of proposals, state negotiators agreed to maintain the formula that kept the CCPOA's monthly pay $666 below the CHP's. In their final offer made Sept. 12, they stripped it out.
&quot;In my view, the big problem is the public-policy problem: We've got local governments bargaining their agreements, then the pass-through with the CHP, and then the smaller unit of 5,000 dictating what 30,000 is going to get,&quot; Gilb said. &quot;Generally, for me, that is bad public policy.&quot;
The state is offering the CCPOA three annual 5 percent increases, plus other benefits. But the union sees the proposal as a takeaway because it increases the shortfall with the CHP to $744 per month in the current year.
CCPOA leaders say additional goodies the state has given to the CHP widen the gap even more, figures the DPA disputes. Moreover, the state says, recruitment bonuses and housing stipends for employees working at selected prisons can boost some CCPOA members' pay beyond the CHP's.
In a state with 11,000 law enforcement vacancies, Jimenez said his focus has been on trying to keep the CCPOA competitive.
&quot;Nothing they've offered us does that,&quot; Jimenez said. &quot;In fact, it moves in the exact opposite direction.&quot;
The politicsState Senate President Pro Tem Don Perata didn't really like the bill, but there he was on the floor of his chamber on April 26, asking his members to vote for it.
The $7.9 billion legislation proposed to add 53,000 beds to the state and local prison and jail systems, but the Democrat from Oakland couldn't convince himself the understaffed prison agency would be able to guard them.
&quot;It's impossible for me to fathom, to understand for a second, how we expect any of this to work without labor peace in our prisons,&quot; Perata said, with a contract impasse only weeks away.
Perata said, &quot;We must solve the labor problem now.&quot; Otherwise, he suggested, &quot;You're building (prisons), but you're not going to be able to manage.&quot;
In the ensuing months, legislators from both parties echoed Perata's remarks. In late May, the four legislative leaders sent a letter to Schwarzenegger &quot;to express some reservations with the direction of the contract negotiations.&quot;
The letter warned of the potential intervention by the federal medical care receiver, Robert Sillen, who had already made noises about overseeing the prison agency's hiring program.
&quot;We all know that for the reforms contained in (the prison building plan) to work, there needs to be a better working relationship&quot; between labor and management in the prison system, the letter said.
Schwarzenegger responded with a letter describing the state's monetary offer to the CCPOA as &quot;generous.&quot; He added that in return, &quot;we are asking for modest changes to contract language in a few key areas that will improve the operation and safety of our prisons.&quot;
The power struggleOn Sept. 12, the CCPOA kept the Legislature up past midnight, trying to get a pay raise. The move failed, and in the ensuing daylight, the Schwarzenegger administration hit the union with its &quot;last, best and final offer&quot; The union rejected it, and the state responded by unilaterally implementing the contract six days later.
The state also began asserting something it had been seeking in negotiations for more than a year -- &quot;management rights.&quot;
For years, prison cops have been able to file grievances on virtually any post-contract change in working conditions sought by management. Most of them have also been able to pick their job shifts based on seniority.
The state now is moving to end the former practice and change the latter.
According to Page, the assistant sociology professor, the job protections represented huge gains for officers who, in previous decades, had toiled under arbitrary and sometimes ruthless prison managers.
&quot;Before the centralization and creation of the CDC, all the institutions were little fiefdoms, to themselves,&quot; Page said. &quot;It still is like that to a large degree.&quot;
It's a system, he said, where officers risk working for &quot;vindictive managers who file disciplinary charges maliciously.&quot;
Jim Tilton, the current corrections secretary, agreed that managerial capriciousness turned prison workers against the agency's leaders. But he said that if he's going to be held responsible for fixing the prison system, he needs the power to change the way the institutions operate.
All he can say to the union, Tilton said, is to trust him.
&quot;I believe there are things the union has obtained because there are past experiences of management not treating employees fairly,&quot; Tilton said. &quot;I understand that, and I understand my responsibility. If I try to get management rights, I have to prove I will exercise them in a fair fashion. I understand the history, that maybe management not always has done that.&quot;
CCPOA leaders say they like and respect Tilton and could probably get a contract done if they dealt with him directly. But they say the &quot;givebacks&quot; on management rights are setting up their members for some tough times with some prison bosses who don't play fair.
&quot;The same people who are running the prisons now were the ones that 10, 15 years ago used to beat inmates up and leave them in their cells,&quot; Jimenez said. &quot;Now they're just practicing their techniques on staff.&quot;
