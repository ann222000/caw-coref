To my friends, family and all my relations,

This week takes me, on the Rainbow Warrior, from the island of Cyprus in
the Mediterranean to a point east of Mecca, in the Red Sea. Weather has
been favorable with good sailing winds. It’s hot though, so hot. The
following web logs I have written up each day on
http://mikemate.wordpress.com &lt; http://mikemate.wordpress.com/ &gt; There are
some photos too. One silly picture is of me wearing the Suez Canal
Pilot’s cap whilst he is on his knees facing Mecca. The other is of a
dolphin. There were lots of dolphins that accompanied us in the Red Sea.
(There is also a picture {dated 09 Sept} that I published late – it’s
the Rainbow in Cyprus tied up to a dolphin.)

And so another week comes to you,

With love and peace,

mike

Monday 10 September

/Say good bye to Europe little Rainbow, you don’t know if you’ll be
back./ I voice the thought to Slade who is steering the ship as we pull
away, stern first, from the Dolphin. ‘Hard to starboard and slow ahead’
we’re on our way out, the wind has stopped blowing, and the sun has just
risen – Limassol harbour is deathly quiet. Rainbow Warrior starts her
voyage to India.

Steaming due south in the direction of Port Said, on the edge of the
Crusade sector of the eastern Mediterranean, I overhear Oscar Charlie
interrogating a cargo ship too close to the coast of Lebanon. Beirut is
just a stones throw away – I would love to pull in one last time, out of
love.

It was Oscar Charlie (Officer Commanding) of Lebanon who assisted the
Rainbow with the oil clean up operation in October 2006, following the
Israel/Lebanon war. The same Oscar Charlie then nailed us when we came
back a few months later. For visiting Occupied Palestine. Israel.
Although a rose by any name smells just as sweet. There was a little
confusion in the house of Lebanon, in April this year, and our two day
stop over turned into thirty days under arrest.

But now we steam south, we pass Lebanon. And then a couple of hours
later I hear the girls from Israeli Navy calling ‘any vessel, any yacht,
any object in position…’ And I would love to bring the Rainbow Warrior
into Haifa, one last time, out of love.

Good bye Mediterranean.

Tuesday 11 September

“Port Said port control this is Rainbow Warrior…” it takes a number of
attempts calling over the radio. “One hour from now, ten-o-clock” I give
our ETA (expected time of arrival). Slade fetches the Marlboro
cigarettes from the hold.

“One hour from now is nine-o-clock” port control responds. We are in the
wrong time zone. /But I checked the admiralty publication? /I decide not
to adjust the ships clocks we will sail through Egypt ahead of local
time. Pilot boards and guides the ship into a marina. We drop two
anchors and go stern alongside Port Said.

Felix marine are our appointed agents looking after us, in particular
Toto who greets me with the familiarity of a kiss to each cheek. We set
ourselves up in the mess room, I sit beside a bag filled with cartons of
Marlboro, Toto sits opposite me and advises me. “When did the time
change?” I ask, looking up from the official papers I am stamping and
signing.

“Two days ago” Toto counts off his fingers – his round shiny head
reminds me of the Buddha, “because of Ramadan. This year we stop
daylight saving early. The difficult part is not drinking any water
whilst the sun shines. So, the less daylight: the better.”

Rainbow Warrior is positioned to join the first south bound convoy
transiting Suez Canal in the morning.

Wednesday 12 September

“Follow that ship, and keep a distance of half-a-mile.” Mr Pilot settles
back on the love-chair taking up space meant for two. There is nothing
following us. Rainbow Warrior is the last ship in the first south-bound
convoy transiting the Suez Canal /for good reason – we cannot keep up
with the rest. /

/ /

/ /The desert is lifted out of night by twilight and the sky fills with
pigeons. The birds flutter to and from tall conical-shaped farms filled
with pigeon holes and projecting stick-like roosts. They flutter on both
sides of the canal, in Asia and in Africa.

Mr Pilot is enamoured by the chief mate, Madeleine; her dark skin, curly
grey mop of hair, her eyes. Hazel eyes inherited from an Egyptian
father. Madeleine even speaks a few words of Egyptian – just enough to
encourage Mr Pilot (who does not smoke Marlboro) to give her his
telephone number. “It is traditional for a bride and groom, on their
wedding night, to roast and then split a pigeon in two and each eat
half.” /Is Mr Pilot making this up to impress my chief mate?/

The telephone rings on the bridge. “You have to slow down a bit” it’s
the engine room, “the cooling water intake is 32° Celsius and exhaust
temperature is 460°. It’s just too hot.” By the time we reach kilometre
mark 76 we are an hour-and-half behind the second-to-last ship in the
convoy. We cannot make it to the Bitter Lake and so pull out of the
canal to anchor in lake Timsah beside the town of Ismailia. We wait for
the north-bound convoy to pass. We are half-way.

Thursday 13 September

Assam, the Pilot from Ismalia, finishes his cheese sandwich, cup of
instant coffee with five sugars. He has his last Marlboro before
sunrise. Good morning Ramadan.

It has taken us 27 hours to reach Suez - the longest canal transit I
have ever made. Forty-eight ships were in the North bound convoy. We
waited 12 hours for them to pass. Then we anchored again a little
further down the canal, in the Bitter lake, to allow the second
south-bound convoy (of eight ships) to overtake us, before falling in,
once again, at the back of the queue.

The canal broadens as we reach the port of Suez. A bum-boat chugs over,
belching black smoke, bringing to us Lino - joining second engineer from
Columbia. Assam packs his ashtrays, his paper weights (gifts originally
to the ship from some Mediterranean shipping agency), cartons of
Marlboro cigarettes and a Greenpeace T-shirt into a bag. Fifty dollars
goes into his pocket, but he is asking for more – he never /stops/
asking for more. A few loose cigarette boxes lie on the chart table.
“For the pilot boat,” he shouts, scooping them up into his bag. He then
takes the empty cardboard carton, scrunches it up and is about to throw
it into the Suez Canal when Mate Madeleine lets out a shriek.

“You can’t do that!” she cries out, shocked.

Assam’s shout raises in pitch at the audacity of /a woman/ – telling
/him/ what to do. It has been a tough watch for Madeleine. “I can. I am
Egyptian; it is my canal not yours,” and with that the red and white
packaging is thrown overboard.

I imagine a world without borders and without religion whilst watching,
in disbelief, the Marlboro packaging floating in the Marlboro canal on
the first day of Ramadan.

Friday 14 September

The Gulf of Suez and Sinai Peninsula are behind us. We run before the
wind, sails set to either side – I call it “donkey’s ears” when they’re
set like that – the only way to sail on a following Red sea. It is hot
and I have shaved my head for the crossing.

We held an abandon ship drill and our first piracy meeting – though crew
preferred to call it a security meeting. Earlier this year the Rainbow
encountered pirates off the coast of Oman. Patrick was the one to sound
the alarm; he was on watch when it happened. Emma was on board too -
she’s just rejoined the boat in Port Said, as deckhand – she’s from
Australia. It gave the crew quite a scare and we hope it doesn’t happen
again, but we’re preparing for the possibility that it does. We have no
defence but to lock ourselves away in the accommodation – that’s the plan.

Saturday 15 September

I bought a book as I passed through the airport, called “The Weather
Makers” by Tim Flannery. I started reading it today and came across this
paradox put forward by James Lovelock, author of Gaia:

“The Sun, like all the stars, has become more intense as it has aged.
Since life evolved its rays have increased in intensity by 30 percent,
yet the temperature of the surface of our planet has remained relatively
constant. A drop of one tenth of 1 percent in the solar radiation
reaching Earth can trigger an ice age; so Earth’s long-term climatic
stability could not have resulted from mere chance.”

There is time now at sea to read and there are hours of bridge watch in
which to contemplate. It is so hot on the Red Sea.

Sunday 16 September

As a precaution to piracy we are dogging (bolting) down the deadlights
(heavy round shutters, made of 10mm thick steel, that hang vertically
from a hinge above each porthole). In a storm they are secured (dogged
down) to prevent waves from smashing the glass. Now they are dogged down
against pirate bullets or axes – closed; there is /no/ concept of day or
night. I have five in my cabin and one of them is at the head of my
bunk, above my pillow. This morning, with sleep in my eyes and no idea
of time, I undogged and lifted up the deadlight attaching it to a loop
of rope to hold it open. Light filled my cabin and I put my head to the
porthole glass, craning my neck up to check the set of sail. The
deadlight hanging above me: hanging from the piece of rope.

There was a flash of light and then, although the sun was up; STARS.
/That wasn’t sore,/ my first thought. The deadlight had dropped. Its
deadweight (designed to keep out rough oceans) had slammed my head into
the rim of porthole. And then a recognisable feeling of both warm and
wet, I lifted my finger to my brow. There was a trickle, too viscous to
be a bead of sweat – and it was dark red.

I have a lump behind my left ear and a gash – like that of Harry Potter
– on my left temple. An inopportune time as today was set for a photo
shoot. There is a magazine in Finland that is publishing some of these
stories and they want photos. Fortunately one of the crew - Adriana or
“Chow” as we call her, from Mexico City – has studied photography, but
today is not a good day for Captain Potter.
