Thompson Adviser Has  Criminal Past
By Matthew Mosk
Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday,  November 4, 2007; A01
Republican presidential candidate _Fred D. Thompson_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Fred+Thompson+(Politi... )  has been
crisscrossing the country since early  this summer on a private jet lent to
him by a businessman and close adviser who  has a criminal record for drug
dealing.
Thompson selected the businessman, Philip Martin, to raise seed money for his
_White House_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+White+House?tid=i... )  bid. Martin is one of four campaign co-chairmen and  the
head of a group called the &quot;first day founders.&quot; Campaign aides jokingly  began
to refer to Martin, who has been friends with Thompson since the early
1990s, as the head of &quot;Thompson's Airforce.&quot;
Thompson's frequent flights aboard Martin's twin-engine Cessna 560 Citation
have saved him more than $100,000, because until the law changed in September,
campaign-finance rules allowed presidential candidates to reimburse private
jet  owners for just a fraction of the true cost of flights.
Martin entered a plea of guilty to the sale of 11 pounds of marijuana in
1979; the court withheld judgment pending completion of his probation. He was
charged in 1983 with violating his probation and with multiple counts of felony
bookmaking, cocaine trafficking and conspiracy. He pleaded no contest to the
cocaine-trafficking and conspiracy charges, which stemmed from a plan to sell
$30,000 worth of the drug, and was continued on probation.
Thompson's campaign said the candidate was not aware of the multiple criminal
cases, for which Martin served no jail time. All are described in public
court  records.
Karen Hanretty, Thompson's deputy communications director, said yesterday
that &quot;Senator Thompson was unaware of the information until this afternoon. Phil
Martin has been a friend of the senator since the mid-1990s and remains so
today.&quot; Thompson communications director Todd Harris added that Martin was not
subjected to the campaign's standard vetting process because &quot;he's a
longtime  friend.&quot;
&quot;There's not a campaign in the world that has the ability to research every
one of its supporters going back more than 20 years,&quot; Harris said.
Martin could not be reached in the past week, and lawyers for him in
_Tennessee_ ( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Tennessee?tid=informline )
and _Florida_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Florida?tid=informline )  declined to comment on the criminal cases. Hanretty said  she
forwarded detailed questions from _The Washington Post_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+Washington+Post+C... )  to Martin
yesterday afternoon.
Martin, 49, is one of several top political fundraisers with a criminal past
to gain access this year to a presidential contender. _Sen. Hillary Rodham
Clinton_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Hillary+Clinton?tid=i... )  decided in September to return more  than $800,000 raised by
_Norman Hsu_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Norman+Hsu?tid=inform... ) , one of her top bundlers, after newspapers disclosed  that he had been
convicted of fraud and had an outstanding warrant for his  arrest.
Martin has been more than just a key fundraiser to Thompson, though. The use
of his plane eases a major logistical burden stemming from the intense
demands  on presidential candidates this year for appearances in more than 20 states
holding early primaries. It also may have saved the campaign at least
$120,000,  given that _Federal Election Commission_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Federal+Election+Comm... )  rules allowed
Thompson to reimburse  Martin for the use of the private jet at the commercial
ticket rate until  Congress changed the rules in September.
Thompson has reported reimbursing Martin $102,330, without specifying
precisely where he flew on the plane, or when. But a comparison of flight  records
for the plane, kept by the tracking firm FlightAware, and news accounts  of
Thompson's campaign appearances this year shows that since June the plane has
made more than two dozen stops that coincided with Thompson campaign events.
The destinations included a _GOP_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Republican+Party... )  fundraising luncheon in _South
Carolina_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/South+Carolina?tid=in... ) , rallies in _Houston_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Houston?tid=informline )  and _Dallas_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Dallas?tid=informline ) , a leadership conference in
_Indianapolis_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Indianapolis?tid=info... ) , and the Minnesota State Fair. The most recent trip  was on Thursday, when
the plane left _Las Vegas_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Las+Vegas?tid=informline )  with Thompson on board, bound for Washington, where
Thompson has long been an industry lobbyist.
The Web site JetTrip.com estimates that the hourly charter rate for use of a
plane similar to Martin's would be between $1,500 and $2,400, which means
these  flights would normally cost at least $220,000, more than double what
Thompson  paid.
Several other presidential candidates use private aircraft supplied by key
political supporters. Former _New York_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/New+York?tid=informline )  mayor _Rudolph W. Giuliani_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Rudolph+Giuliani?tid=... ) , for
instance, has paid $279,000 to Elliott  Asset Management, a firm headed by
campaign adviser and New York financier Paul  Singer, to reimburse the firm for using
an airplane. _Democrat John Edwards_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/John+Edwards+(Politic... )  has paid $628,052 to
longtime backer Fred  Baron, a Dallas lawyer, for the use of his plane.
Martin's criminal history has not previously surfaced in news accounts
mentioning his role as a Thompson supporter. The Chattanooga Times Free Press
referred to him recently as Thompson's &quot;mystery man.&quot;
Archived Florida court records provide details of the various cases against
Martin, including alleged sports-betting activity, a cocaine deal he arranged
with an undercover sheriff's deputy and carried out through a middleman, and
the  sale of 11 pounds of marijuana to an undercover detective for $3,400.
Martin  produced the marijuana from the trunk of his 1973 Cadillac as he and the
detective were parked behind a _Tampa_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Tampa?tid=informline )  area department store, according to the
arrest report.
According to court records, close friends and an ex-wife, Martin arrived in
Tennessee from Tampa about 1985 while serving probation for his various
offenses. He set up a series of businesses, starting with the Puzzle's Pizza
parlor. He opened a hardware store, and friends say he began trying to recruit
business partners for more ambitious real estate ventures.
The fledgling developer also started to get involved in local and state
politics. Rep. _Zach Wamp_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Zach+Wamp?tid=informline )  (R-Tenn.), a close friend of both Martin and Thompson
who was then a commercial real estate broker in _Chattanooga_
( http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Chattanooga?tid=infor... ) , said he and
Martin met through their work and became  friends because of a mutual interest in
Republican politics. &quot;He always has been  a mover and shaker from the first
time I knew him,&quot; Wamp said.
He and others said Martin, a gregarious and charismatic man, was a natural in
the world of political cocktail chatter and back-slapping. Martin's first
wife,  Renee Whitfield, recalled that he and Wamp campaigned together for a GOP
gubernatorial candidate in 1994. &quot;We rode the bus to a county fair, all of us
wearing our [campaign] T-shirts and passing out literature,&quot; Whitfield
recalled.
Martin began spending significant time with Thompson at fundraisers for Wamp
at a farm owned by one of Martin's close friends, Delwin L. Huggins,
according  to Huggins's ex-wife, Badia McKee. After making small donations to Wamp in
1992  and 1993, he sent his first substantial check -- $1,000 -- to Thompson
in  1994.
Another $4,000 followed for Thompson's 1994 Senate bid, during which a
private jet owned by a wealthy Tennessee businessman, Steven A. McKenzie, flew
Martin, Thompson and others around the state, according to a source with direct
knowledge of the trips. McKenzie did not respond to multiple telephone  calls.
Martin &quot;was always wanting to help candidates,&quot; Wamp said. &quot;I assume through
10 years of political involvement, when Fred came on the scene, they
immediately  saw eye to eye.&quot; Martin and Thompson both stand well over 6 feet and have
outsize personalities. &quot;Hail fellows well met,&quot; is how David Copeland, a
longtime local legislator from the Chattanooga area, described Martin and
Thompson. &quot;They just stood out, and people gravitated to them.&quot;
From 1992 to 2002, Martin donated more than $75,000 to GOP candidates and
committees, according to FEC records. By 2000, he had become a major political
player in Tennessee Republican circles.
For much of his work, Martin

He is?  Did the Senate vote that way when they had to remove him over  that
&quot;felony&quot;?  Oh, and what he settled on was civil perjury, not criminal  - you,
being the smart rightwing crackpot that you are, already knew that (and  what
the difference is between the two).  Yeah, right.  And of course,  that makes
it just fine that Frederick's of Hollywood is taking trips from a  drug dealer.
Yeah, that's the ticket!

I see you are still exposing your total lack of ability to  debate with
civility in order to defend the indefensible.
You should learn to be a little less rude.
Small wonder that no one responds to your posts.
I did, but I won't again.
