Wars: Organized terrorism for profits that are never meant to be won, they are meant to
be sustained whilst the war mongerers keep making massive profits.

Terrorism: A technique used by the behind-the-scenes ruling elite criminals who control
governments to manipulate public opinion in order to further an agenda.

Myth: A myth is a power rallying story that is used by the Cabal to mobilize public
opinion into supporting it and ignore the truth that the Cabal are looting everyone on
Earth.

The Timeline to Tyranny
Ten advances towards the end of freedom and privacy in the United States

Paul Joseph Watson

Tuesday, August 7, 2007

The top ten advances towards tyranny in the United States during the tenure of the Bush
administration, from the Patriot Act to the latest expansion of the illegal
eavesdropping surveillance program.

1) The USA Patriot Act

The party line often heard from Neo-Cons in their attempts to defend the Patriot Act
either circulate around the contention that the use of the Patriot Act has never been
abused or that it isn't being used against American citizens.
&lt; http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/october2004/091004patriotact.htm &gt; Here is an
archive of articles that disproves both of these fallacies.

The Patriot Act was the boiler plate from which all subsequent attacks on the
Constitution were formed.

2) Total Information Awareness

&quot;Every purchase you make with a credit card, every magazine subscription you buy and
medical prescription you fill, every Web site you visit and e-mail you send or receive,
every academic grade you receive, every bank deposit you make, every trip you book and
every event you attend - all these transactions and communications will go into what the
Defense Department describes as &quot;a virtual, centralized grand database,&quot;
&lt; http://www.prisonplanet.com/you_are_a_suspect.html &gt; infamously wrote New York Times
writer William Safire, announcing the birth of Total Information Awareness, a kind of
Echelon on steroids introduced a year after 9/11.

TIA was not canned, it was simply removed from the newspaper, renamed and
&lt; http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/june2004/060704tia.htm &gt; continues to operate under
a guise of different programs.

(Article continues below)

3) USA Patriot Act II

The second Patriot Act was a mirror image of powers that Julius Caesar and Adolf Hitler
gave themselves. Whereas the First Patriot Act only gutted the First, Third, Fourth and
Fifth Amendments, and seriously damaged the Seventh and the Tenth, the Second Patriot
Act reorganized the entire Federal government as well as many areas of state government
under the dictatorial control of the Justice Department, the Office of Homeland Security
and the FEMA NORTHCOM military command.

The Domestic Security Enhancement Act 2003, also known as the Second Patriot Act is by
its very structure the definition of dictatorship.

4) Military Commissions Act

Slamming the final nail in the coffin of everything America used to stand for, the
boot-licking U.S. Senate gave President Bush the legal authority to abduct and sexually
mutilate American citizens and American children in the name of the war on terror in
passing the Military Commissions Act and officially ending Habeas Corpus.

There is nothing in the &quot;detainee&quot; legislation that protects American citizens from
being kidnapped by their own government and tortured.

&lt; http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/28/opinion/28thu1.html &gt; The New York Times stated that
the legislation introduced, &quot;A dangerously broad definition of &quot;illegal enemy combatant&quot;
in the bill could subject legal residents of the United States, as well as foreign
citizens living in their own countries, to summary arrest and indefinite detention with
no hope of appeal. The president could give the power to apply this label to anyone he
wanted.&quot;

&lt; http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ackerman28sep28,0,619852.st...
n-rightrail&gt; Yale Law Professor Bruce Ackerman states in the L.A. Times, &quot;The compromise
legislation....authorizes the president to seize American citizens as enemy combatants,
even if they have never left the United States. And once thrown into military prison,
they cannot expect a trial by their peers or any other of the normal protections of the
Bill of Rights.&quot;

&lt; http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/09/imagine-giving-donald-rumsfeld.html &gt; Similarly, law
Professor Marty Lederman explains: &quot;this [subsection (ii) of the definition of 'unlawful
enemy combatant'] means that if the Pentagon says you're an unlawful enemy combatant --
using whatever criteria they wish -- then as far as Congress, and U.S. law, is
concerned, you are one, whether or not you have had any connection to 'hostilities' at
all.&quot;

5) John Warner Defense Authorization Act

The Bush Junta quietly &quot;tooled up&quot; to utilize the U.S. military in engaging American
dissidents after the next big crisis, with a frightening and overlooked piece of
legislation that was passed alongside the Military Commissions Act, the
&lt; http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/november2006/031106civilsuppress... &gt; John
Warner Defense Authorization Act, which greased the skids for armed confrontation and
abolishes posse comitatus.

6) Illegal Domestic Wiretapping Program

&quot;Months after the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush secretly authorized the National
Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United States to search
for evidence of terrorist activity without the court-approved warrants ordinarily
required for domestic spying, according to government officials,&quot; reported the
&lt; http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/16/politics/16program.html?ex=11866320...
8785&amp;ei=5070&gt; New York Times on December 16, 2005

The secret warrantless spying program was a complete violation of both the 4th Amendment
and FISA.

7) Expansion of Illegal Domestic Wiretapping Program

Not content with now being lawfully allowed to force ISP's and cell phone companies to
turn over data about customers without a warrant, the Bush administration is pushing for
even more authority to spy on American citizens, and has already been handed a 6 month
window within which to impose any surveillance policy it likes, and for that program to
remain legal in perpetuity.

&lt; http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/august2007/060807_dictator_power... &gt; The
administration has a 6 month window in which to impose any surveillance program it
chooses and that program will go unchallenged and remain legally binding in perpetuity -
it cannot be revoked. Under the definitions of the legislation, Bush has been granted
absolute dictator status for a minimum of 6 months.

If he so chooses, and so long as it's implemented within the next half year, Bush could
build a database of every website visited by every American - and the policy would be
immune from Congressional challenge even after the &quot;surveillance gap&quot; legislation
reaches its sunset

8) Martial Law Presidential Decision Directive 51

New legislation signed on May 9, 2007, declares that in the event of a &quot;catastrophic
event&quot;, the President can take total control over the government and the country,
bypassing all other levels of government at the state, federal, local, territorial and
tribal levels, and thus
&lt; http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/may2007/230507martiallaw.htm &gt; ensuring total
unprecedented dictatorial power.

&lt; http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070509-12.html &gt; The National
Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive, which also places the Secretary
of Homeland Security in charge of domestic &quot;security&quot;, was signed earlier this month
without the approval or oversight of Congress and seemingly supercedes the National
Emergency Act which allows the president to declare a national emergency but also
requires that Congress have the authority to &quot;modify, rescind, or render dormant&quot; such
emergency authority if it believes the president has acted inappropriately.

9) Destruction of the Dollar

Former World Bank Vice President, Chief Economist and Nobel Prize winner
&lt; http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/october2006/301006globalcrash.htm &gt;  Joseph
Stiglitz has predicted a global economic crash within 24 months - unless the current
downturn is successfully managed. Asked if the situation was being properly handled
Stiglitz emphatically responded &quot;no,&quot;.

Stiglitz caused controversy in October 2001 when he exposed rampant corruption within
the IMF and blew the whistle on their nefarious methods of inducing countries to fall
under their debt before stripping them of sovereignty and hollowing out their economies.
Stiglitz agreed that the process of hijacking and looting key infrastructure on the part
of the IMF and World Bank, as an offshoot of predatory globalization, had now moved from
the third world to Europe, the United States and Canada.

10) Amnesty &amp; The North American Union

The open plan to merge the US with Mexico and Canada and create a
&lt; http://www.infowars.com/articles/nwo/north_american_union_superstate_... &gt; Pan
American Union has long been a Globalist brainchild but its very real and prescient
implementation on behalf of the Council on Foreign Relations has finally been reported
on by mainstream news outlets.

The framework on which the American Union is being pegged is the NAFTA Super Highway, a
four football-fields-wide leviathan that stretches from southern Mexico through the US
up to Montreal Canada .Coupled with
&lt; http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/may2006/270506massamnesty.htm &gt; Bush's blanket
amnesty program, the Pan American Union is the final jigsaw piece for the total
dismantling of America as we know it.

A quick note, first, about what counts as a &quot;Bush = Hitler&quot; allusion for these purposes.
Obviously, someone saying &quot;that George Bush guy is just like Hitler&quot; counts. So does the
ever-so-creative addition of a little Hitler-style mustache onto photographs or
cartoons. So too does someone starting out &quot;George Bush isn't like Hitler...&quot; and then
continuing &quot;...but given X and Y and Z you can understand why some people are saying he
is&quot;. So too does someone starting out &quot;George Bush isn't like Hitler...&quot; and then
continuing with flattery of Hitler &quot;...because Hitler was elected / didn't drink /
actually served his time in the army&quot;. Implying that the Nazis were behaving better than
the US certainly counts, such as
&lt; http://www.semiskimmed.net/bushhitler.html#corinredgrave#corinredgrave &gt; &quot;Not even the
Nazis treated their prisoners this badly&quot;. Oh, and comparisons between September 11th
and the Reichstag fire count as well.

Put simply, it's my page and it goes in if I think it counts. Every effort will be made
to provide a link to the source, along with quotes and context so you can make up your
own mind.

Quoted in the &lt; http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,975048,00.html &gt;  Guardian,
June 2003: &quot;The US is really beyond reason now. It is beyond our imagining to know what
they are going to do next and what they are prepared to do. There is only one
comparison: Nazi Germany&quot;

Ted Rall (cartoonist and writer)

In January, 2004, asking
&lt; http://www.rall.com/2004_01_01_archive.html#107344571236880734 &gt; &quot;Is Bush a Nazi?&quot; seems
the conclude that Bush is worse because at least Hitler was elected:

Lately we're being told that it's either (a) inappropriate or (b) untrue to refer to
Bush's illegitimate junta as Nazi, neo-Nazi or neofascist. Because, you know, you're not
necessarily a Nazi just because you seize power like one, take advantage of a national
Reichstag Fire-like tragedy like one, build concentration and death camps like one,
start unprovoked wars like one, Red-bait your liberal opponents like one or create a
national security apparatus that behaves like something a Nazi would create and even has
a Nazi-sounding name. All of those people who see a little Adolf in the not-so-bright
eyes of America's homeland-grown despot are just imagining things.

Me, I'm catching it for this week's cartoon for daring to suggest that, well--you know.

Of course, there are differences. Hitler, for example, was legally elected. And he had a
plan--not one that I like, but a plan--for the period after the war.

I'll be happy to stop comparing Bush to Hitler when he stops acting like him.

Jay Baker

Jay &lt; http://www.jaywalkingwounded.com/jay.html &gt;  Baker is a writer, filmmaker (and
voter) from Sheffield, UK. In his essay  &lt; http://www.jaywalkingwounded.com/yankees.html &gt;
&quot;The Yankee Swastika&quot;, the first paragraph manages to put supporters of the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq on a par with holocaust deniers:

And yet there are still those who refuse to accept the figures when facts show just how
many innocent people of a particular persuasion were condemned to concentration camps
and sent to an early grave; a mass grave.

Then he goes on about how at least Hitler was elected, and how Bush likes nothing better
than killing brown people:

George Bush actually came to power in what many might argue to be a less democratic way
than Adolf Hitler. ... Bush may even have an ideology based on the &quot;blonde haired, blue
eyed, white super-race.&quot; I say this because since squatting in the White House, he has
been intent on bombing other far-away, dark-skinned people of Middle Eastern countries,
as part of his &quot;War on Terror,&quot; which is really a War of Terror.

He also informs us that the National Rifle Association is a splinter group of the Ku
Klux Klan. That must explain all those burning crosses seen so regularly in Charlton
Heston's garden.

warmongering,&quot; a Boondocks character says of the president. &quot;That's preposterous; even I

Linda Ronstadt

Not just one Hitler, but a whole new
&lt; http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2004-11-16-ronstadt_x.htm &gt;  bunch of Hitlers,
according to the enduring crooner:

Don't get her started on the recent [2004] presidential election. &quot;People don't realize
that by voting Republican, they voted against themselves,&quot; she says. Of Iraq in
particular, she adds, &quot;I worry that some people are entertained by the idea of this war.
They don't know anything about the Iraqis, but they're angry and frustrated in their own
lives. It's like Germany, before Hitler took over. The economy was bad and people felt

artist &amp; photojournalist in the U.S &lt; http://www.rexcurry.net/photography.html &gt; , creator
of the renowned &lt; http://rexcurry.net/artlibertarian/searchessuck.html &gt;  artwork
&quot;Searches Suck&quot; (using the sadly under-exploited medium of bent soldering wire glued to
cardboard), author of the forthcoming book &quot;Swastika
&lt; http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html &gt;  Secrets&quot; Ellis Rexwood Curry. IV,
e-mailed to say:

*       RexCurry.net compares FDR to Hitler &lt; http://rexcurry.net/bookchapter5a1.html &gt; ,
*       RexCurry.net compares &lt; http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html &gt;  the pledge of
allegiance to Hitler with photos,
*       RexCurry.net compares Francis Bellamy to
&lt; http://rexcurry.net/pledgetragedy.html &gt;  Hitler and
*       RexCurry.net compares Edward Bellamy to
&lt; http://rexcurry.net/pledgebackward.html &gt;  Hitler.

Well, that's all very, erm... interesting, but as this page isn't about FDR or the
Bellamies (who started the U.S. Pledge Of Allegiance in schools) I didn't see that it
qualified for inclusion.
When he e-mailed me his open letter &quot;Flag Day (6-14) Schools should not
&lt; http://rexcurry.net/flag-day.html &gt;  teach kids to verbally fellate flags, nor flag
fetishism&quot;, I asked to be removed from his mailing list. He wrote back asking if I
wasn't the right person to send stuff to for the The Gallery of 'Bush = Hitler'
Allusions? Yes, I replied, this is the place for &quot;Bush = Hitler&quot; claims but he didn't
seem be saying Bush is Hitler. His point, so far as I'd grasped it then, is that Francis
Bellamy somehow subverted the USA to nazi tyranny by popularising the raised-arm salute
in 1892 - nearly 30 years before the nazi party even existed.
But quick as a flash Rex wrote back to explain all and show me where I was going wrong.
He put it so well that I'd just spoil it if I attempted to paraphrase: &quot;And you forgot
to mention that Bush loves the pledge, as do so many republican-socialists, who are
outsocializing Clinton by double (in social spending alone), and yes it happened 30
years before the National Socialist German Workers' Party (which you cover for with the
hackneyed shorthand) and it continued to grow for all of those 30 years, up to and
THROUGH the German National Socialists. Thanks for not actually disputing a word I said,
and for conceding all. I realize that you are too intellectually dishonest to address
this topic or to inform your audience.&quot;.

Straight-armed Roman salutes depicted in 1784 - an example of early fascist
brainwashing?Oh now I see...

*       When the pledge of allegience started in 1892 it adopted the straight-armed
salute, which had been associated with the Romans since at least 1784 (see 'The
&lt; http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/neocl_dav_oath.html &gt;  Oath of the
Horatii', right).
*       The National Socialist German Workers' Party (you see how I now avoid the
hackneyed shorthand) adopted the straight-armed salute in 1920.
*       In 1942, in reaction to the National Socialists' use of the salute, the pledge
of allegience changed to using the &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute &gt;  current
hand-on-the-heart gesture.
*       Bush likes the pledge.
*       Bush is a socialist.
*       Therefore Bush = Hitler.

A fairly watertight case, I'm sure we can all agree.

Dave Lindorff, politcal author

In three 'Counterpunch' articles, Dave Lindorff expands on the comparisons he sees
between Bush and Hitler.
In  &lt; http://www.counterpunch.org/lindorff02012003.html &gt; &quot;Bush and Hitler - The Stategy
of Fear&quot; on February 1, 2003:

It's going a bit far to compare the Bush of 2003 to the Hitler of 1933. Bush simply is
not the orator that Hitler was. But comparisons of the Bush Administration's fear
mongering tactics to those practiced so successfully and with such terrible results by
HItler and Goebbels on the German people and their Weimar Republic are not at all out of
line.

In  &lt; http://www.counterpunch.org/lindorff07182003.html &gt; &quot;Bush and Hitler...Compare and
Contrast&quot; on July 18, 2003, in response to criticism of his February article:

So far, for example, while he has rounded up some Arab and Muslim men purely because of
their ethnicity or religion, Bush has not started gassing them--at least not yet. What I
did say, however [is] that some of the tactics of the Bush administration resemble those
of Hitler and his Brownshirts. I would go further and add that Bush's attorney general,
John Ashcroft, a man who has pointedly praised the old Confederacy, would probably feel
quite comfortable in brown with a hakenkreuz tacked to his sleeve.
[... warmongering ... agressive nationalism ... Guantanemo Bay as a concentration camp
...]
So let's make ourselves clear here. George Bush is not Hitler. Yet. America is not a
fascist state. Yet.

In  &lt; http://www.counterpunch.org/lindorff01062004.html &gt; &quot;RNC Plays the Hitler Card -
MoveOn Shouldn't Apologize for Those Ads&quot; on January 6, 2004, talking about the MoveOn
ads &lt; http://www.semiskimmed.net/bushhitler.html#moveon#moveon &gt; :

... The truth is that the two ads are pretty darned good. [...] The Bush administration
deliberately stoked public fears after 9/11--just as the Nazi's used the Reichstag
Fire--to win support for an illegal, unprovoked invasion of Iraq, an act of aggression
which, at the Nuremberg Trials, was specifically determined to be a war crime. The ad
might have added that the &quot;shock and awe&quot; terror campaign that was the centerpiece of
the U.S. invasion of Iraq, was also by definition a war crime, since its target was the
Iraqi public. [...] President Bush did in fact publicly claim divine instruction to have
been behind his decisions to invade Afghanistan and later Iraq--a rather scary example,
if he is being sincere, of the very kind of megalomania that characterized Hitler. [...]
Were these two ads unfair to either Bush or to the memory of the Holocaust? Hardly.
[...] Are they saying that Bush is Hitler? Only to the most simplistic or willfully
unimaginative of viewers--that is to say the RNC poobahs. What they are saying is that
the same technique used by Hitler and his National Socialist brownshirts to whip up
nationalist fervor in Germany in the early and mid 1930s is being employed today by the
Bush Administration and the Republican Party, and to the same end--to get the American
public to acquiesce in surrendering its democratic rights, to accept one-party rule, and
to agree to a national policy of permanent war in the name of American global hegemony.

that there is, apparently, only one particularly notable difference between Bush and
Hitler - Hitler wouldn't have allowed any looting of museums in Baghdad:

The White House is deeply offended (officially at least) by those who note the chilling
parallel between Nazi foreign policy and the Bush-Wolfowitz doctrine of &quot;preemptive&quot;
(really preventive) war currently being enacted in Iraq. Remembering that all versions
of racist imperialism are not the same, then, let us note one key difference between the
way the Bush gang is proceeding and how Adolf Hitler's Third Reich would have conquered
Baghdad.

The Nazis, we can be sure, would have made special provision to safeguard, and then of
course appropriate, the monumental treasures of Mesopotamia and ancient Sumerian
civilization. ...

the principle of a Master Race. ... Finally, Washington will not even attempt to support
its real allies, something which always means knowing how to make concessions. Fake
governments, like that of Karzai in Afghanistan, will manage things better as long as
military power supports a belief in the &quot;invincibility&quot; of the US. Hitler did not think
any differently. ... The militarist programme adopted by the United States now threatens
all peoples. It is the expression of the logic adopted by Adolf Hitler -- to change
social and economic relations by military force in favour of the &quot;Master Race&quot; of the

Administration&quot;:

Just as Hitler was installed (but not elected by the German people) as the Feuhrer by
the Nazi party, so George W. Bush was installed as President of the United States by a
conservative Supreme Court. In both cases, governments used &quot;national security&quot; as an
excuse to launch an assault on democratic freedoms. While &quot;lebensraum&quot; was a rallying
cry for Hitler, Bush's &quot;evil axis,&quot; referring to North Korea, Iran and Iraq, was
supposed to generate patriotic &quot;no-think&quot; here in the USA.

Just as Hitler detached himself from the League of Nations, George W. has been assuming
a more insular position internationally. ... Just as the burning of the Reichstag
provided the Nazi party with the opportunity for shredding the Weimar Constitution, so
did the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11/01 provide the Republican
administration (Cheney/Ashcroft/Rumsfeld) with the rationale for abolishing the freedoms
granted to all citizens in the American Constitution. ...

Even Adolf Hitler came to power through the democratic system in Germany, whereas Bush,
the current leader of the democratic block came to power illegitimately according to
many prominent Americans. Never mind the 'small' difference since they both have a lot
in common.

Adolf Hitler claimed to have launched a 'defensive' war against the Jews, Slavs and the
rest of Europe to protect the German race. Similarly Bush has waged the same 'defensive'
war against the Islamic world and anyone else that does not to conform to the US
dictates. ... Hitler claimed the supremacy of the Aryan race, Bush calls for the
supremacy of US democracy run by its Multinationals, as exemplified by Paul Bremer of
Iraq with the likes of Halliburton and Bechtel.

Adolf had the Gestapo; Bush has the FBI and CIA, who are far more efficient with
killings, kidnapping, torture and now arbitrary imprisonment without charge or legal
representation. ... There are 'Arabs' and 'Muslims' campaigning and raising funds along
with the Zionist camp to re-elect Bush. They are staunch supporter of US democracy and a
believer in Adolf Bush. ...

history's most infamous fascist, Adolph Hitler: Both men assumed power in defiance of
the will of the majority; both men used &quot;great lies&quot; to pursue their warmongering
agendas; both men preyed upon humanity's basest instincts to disseminate those &quot;great
lies&quot;; both men were appeased by the British government, Hitler through Neville
Chamberlain and Bush through Tony Blair; both men were willing to use national tragedies
to justify the destruction of civil liberties, Hitler through the burning of the
Reichstag and Bush through the September 11th terrorist attacks; both men were/are
suspected of either participating in, or ignoring warnings about the imminence of, these
tragedies in order to enhance their political stature and power; both men [exploit(ed)]
a culture of death for political self-aggrandizement, Hitler through his well-publicized
genocide campaigns, and Bush who, while governor of Texas, routinely denied DNA tests to
death row inmates, even though such tests could prevent wrongful executions; both men
were willing to appeal to racism, Hitler through his quest for a &quot;master race,&quot; and Bush
through his condemnation of affirmative action policies, which primarily benefit racial
minorities. [...] both men reveled in war and exploited the military to satiate their
personal ambitions and vendettas; both men used war to enrich their political cronies;
both men demonstrated contempt for international law and the concerns of the world
community; and both men believed they were/are on some holy crusade inspired by a
&quot;divine province&quot; that placed them into power. [...]

Federico Fasano Mertens, editor of La Republica del Uruguay

Replying in &lt; http://www.amics21.com/911/fasano.html &gt;  March 2003 to a letter from Martin
Silverstein, the US ambassador to Uruguay, accusing his newspaper of &quot;totally lacking
any sense of journalistic integrity&quot; by comparing George Bush to Adolf Hitler...

The matter at hand is the comparison between Adolf Hitler and George Bush.
There are obvious differences. The first being that the war criminal, the murderer of
the Jewish and Soviet peoples, won a resounding victory in the German elections, while
the war criminal and murderer of the Iraqi people reached power fraudulently, in the
biggest electoral scandal in US history.
From the theoretical point of view, the comparison between Bush and Hitler is correct.
The scientists have described Nazism as a terrorist dictatorship of corporate
expansionism. Bush, by putting himself beyond the law and invading a defenceless nation
which it had not attacked in order to take over its oil wealth, the second largest on
the planet, and then stating that other oil-producing nations will follow, comes close
to the definition of a corporate terrorist dictatorship. Even though he may not like to
admit it.
George Bush is a Nazi in his genes. ...

...because, you know, Nazism's genetic...

...The American Burning of the Reichstag of September 11 gave George Bush the chance of
a lifetime. The worst electoral victory of a US president since 1876 had turned into the
best historical opportunity for a warmonger to impose a new US order on the world.
As in Hitler's case, the first thing he did was to surround himself with a clique of con
artists such as himself, men obsessed with the intimidating power of force. ...

Wayne Madsen, Washington DC-based investigative journalist and columnist

In a January 2003 article for 'Counterpunch' titled
&lt; http://www.counterpunch.org/madsen01312003.html &gt; &quot;Bush and Hitler - Compare and
Contrast&quot;:

Adolf Hitler would be proud that an American President is emulating him in so many ways.
Hitler, it will be remembered, routinely ignored his military, other world leaders, and
the clergy ...

Passing swiftly on to:

War making and saber rattling is not the only similarity of Bush to Hitler. The German
leader, along with Joseph Goebbels, was also a master of propaganda. ...

Bush uses force and the media. So did Hitler. Ergo, Bush is like Hitler.

Then in February 2003, describing &quot;Bush's War on the
&lt; http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/MAD302B.html &gt;  Soul of America&quot;:

The U.S. military [are being deployed overseas, which] permits the Bush regime to seize
more and more constitutional rights of the American people without the possibility of
substantial resistance. The only people who are currently defenseless in the world today
are the American people--they are vulnerable to the machinations of their own illegal
regime. [...] Like Roman Caesars Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, and
Napoleon Bonaparte, Adolf Hitler, and Benito Mussolini before him, Bush's fanaticism
threatens to plunge the world into endless war and bring to an ignoble close America's
227-year democratic run. ...

Moving on to:

Anyone who closely examines Patriot II will realize that the document represents the
same sort of power grab by Hitler after the Reichstag Fire of 1933. Using the pretext
that the Reichstag was burned down by Communists (when, in fact, it was engineered by
Nazis), Hitler pushed through the &quot;Decree by the Reich President for the Defense of
People and State.&quot; The Reichstag Fire Decree, intended only as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure,
permitted Hitler and his regime to jail political opponents at will, bypass the judicial
system, and eventually force millions of people into concentration camps.
Like the Reichstag Fire Decree, there is nothing really temporary with either Patriot I
or II. ...

And ending with what looks like a call to the army and militias to overthrow the
government:

A former British Lieutenant Colonel named George Washington once turned the weapons of
his army of rebels against his former masters,[...]
And just in case the fascists in control of our government contend that the Founding
Fathers were part of another era, let us remember some more recent quotes:
&quot;This country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever
they shall grow weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional
right of amending it, or exercise their revolutionary right to overthrow it.&quot;--Abraham
Lincoln. [...]
From our Founders to our more recent leaders we have been given the answer to how best
deal with the gravest constitutional dilemma that has ever befallen the United States of
America. Our modern militia, whose forbearers defended us from the British, pro-slavery
secessionists, the Germans, and the Soviet Union, must now defend us once again against
all enemies, not foreign but domestic

Dennis Kaiser

In &quot;A &lt; http://www.democraticunderground.com/articles/02/12/p/04_alarm.html &gt;  Cause for
Alarm?&quot; at DemocraticUnderground in December 2002:

[...] This list [of perceived misdeeds], while far from being complete, represents a
very clear picture of what the Bush administration and Republican agenda is all about.
It is about helping the oil industry, large conglomerates, and the wealthy. It is about
a never-ending war against terrorism. It is about showing contempt for the American
citizens. It is about developing a dictatorship, in much the same manner as that used by
Adolf Hitler, through propaganda and fear.
I certainly support ending terrorism, but I believe terrorism is simply being used by
this Administration in much the same manner as Hitler used it to gain control and
maintain a hold on the people of Germany. [...]
Bush continues to have rather high approval ratings, as reported by the media. Is this
an indictment of the American people's lack of political knowledge and their blind
support of the fight against terrorism? Or is this another example of being controlled
by the mainstream media? [...] Or does it show how instilling fear into the people is
being successful, much as it was for the Nazis in Germany?

He doesn't mention the possibility that Americans might be broadly approving of Bush's
policies and reasonably knowledgeable and open-eyed.

Must Be Stopped Now Before It Is Too Late&quot; in March 2003, Prashant Bhushan (google finds
a number of articles by him in other outlets) unveils the Holy Grail of &quot;Bush = Hitler&quot;
allusions...

While selling his attack on Iraq, Bush often draws an analogy with Hitler's Germany. He
likens the threat posed to the world by Saddam today to the threat posed by Hitler in
the mid 30s. The point that he tries to make is that it would cost the world much more
to tackle Saddam later if he is not tackled now [...]. While the analogy between Saddam
and Hitler may be laughable ...

...Saddam Hussein is nothing like Hitler, but...

... it is instructive, though frightening, to draw an analogy between Bush and Hitler
and the threats posed by them to other nations and to world peace.

Yes, that's right. He's saying that Saddam's nothing like Hitler, but Bush is like him.
The rest of the article is a fairly standard rant.

and maliciousness is equaled by only a few. Bush is a creature on the same level as bin
Laden or, more appropriately, Hitler. He is a lying fascist who uses the myopic fervor
of patriotism and the calculated lying of propaganda to exert his will on a nation and
lead its people down the rabbit hole of war and terror. ...

Oh come on, Johnny - stop holding back and tell us how you really feel.

... As for Mr Giuliani, his likening of Mr Bush to Sir Winston Churchill and Mr Ronald
Reagan seems an odd mixture. Sir Winston did at least call for opposition to the one man
on whom Mr Bush so closely models his actions, i.e. Mr Adolf Hitler, which thus makes
this a most strange comparison. On the other hand, we can see that Mr Reagan may, in his
later days, have been almost as &quot;intellectually challenged&quot; as Mr George W. Bush. ...

... When was the last time a Western nation had a leader so obsessed with God and
claiming God was on our side? If you answered Adolph Hitler and Nazi Germany, you're
correct ... Both Bush and Hitler believe that they were chosen by God to lead their
nations... Like Bush-ites, Hitler was fond of invoking the Ten Commandments as the
foundation of Nazi Germany... But if you ever wondered where Bush got his idea for
so-called &quot;faith-based initiatives&quot; you need only consult Hitler's January 30, 1939

was of old newsreels of those self-congratulatory Nazi rallies held in Germany during

with Napoleon and Hitler:

America will again be asked to bow at the feet of this small man with big ideas [Bush].
... We must study the nemesis of France and how Napoleon was felled before understanding
the damage a tyrant does to a nation and society. We must examine the ruthless and
dictatorial rise of yet another of the three small men-one whose name is not spoken out
of fear of reprisal, but his name was Adolf. We must examine history, in order to not
repeat it, and to understand the mesmerism of a public to a murderous scheme. Three
small men who wanted to conquer . . . and vanquish. ...

The first, irrefutable charge of which George W. Bush stands guilty is that, like Adolph
Hitler, he planned and carried out a war of aggression against Iraq - this being the
supreme violation of international law.

Oddly enough, even if he hadn't invaded Iraq Bush would still have been found guilty by
the tribunal because &quot;The role of sanctions was shown to cause destruction of the Iraqi
infrastructure&quot;. Those sanctions being the only alternative to invasion.

Bush is also getting incredibly more hostile towards his critics, calling them enemies

sadly undated piece which I guess is a reaction to Bush's win in the 2004 election:

This must be how the Germans felt
Watching Hitler rise to power.
Hopelessness, frustration, depression, anger
Increasing steadily by the hour.
[...]
When comparing Bush with Hitler,
Surprise! There's lots of overlapping.
Both are fascist right-wing conservatives
Who sadly caught their countries napping.
[...]
So dig in deep for four more years
Of the hand fear and ignorance have dealt
And, remember, as things get worse and worse,
This is how Germans must have felt.

Poetry of such quality has inspired me to write my own:

A columnist with OpEd News,
Hotly rushed to vent his views,
He wailed and raged and gnashed his teeth,
And ranted a bit like Ken
&lt; http://www.semiskimmed.net/bushhitler.html#kenokeefe#kenokeefe &gt;  O'Keefe,
Before hiding in his attic to escape the secret police who he thought were, like,

Worse than Watergate? Yep. Worse Yet: Worse than Hitler

... A few days ago, I was saying this is worse than Watergate. Now I know, it's much,
much worse than that. It's worse than Hitler. The Bush phenomenon is a seismic
holocaustal menace to the planet. The Colossus. Celcius 3/11, the Meltdown. It is the
world's worst nightmare. Everyone who knows, that is. Everyone who has reviewed the
shitpiles of evidence mounting exponentially by the nanosecond to document but one of
myriad felony assaults on humanity--Air Force One slammed into the Statue of Liberty,
and into the Hancock Center, and the Sears Tower, the Rocky Mountains, the Great Lakes,
the Deserts of Utah and Nevada, and the Sequoia National Park to declare the death of
democracy...

...and so on in a similar vein. She recently got a PhD in Germanic Studies at the
University of Illinois. It would appear that neither the ability to write coherently nor
a rudimentary knowledge of the Hitler era are requirements for Germanic Studies at the
University of Illinois.

David M. Boje, Ph.D.'s deconstruction
&lt; http://peaceaware.com/documents/deconstruct_bu$h.htm &gt;  of the 2003 State Of The Union
Address:

Bush could be compared to Hitler. His militarism embarks on a campaign of empire, world
conquest and domination. In 1938, Hitler demonized Czechoslovakia, then Poland in 1939,
declaring them as threats to national security. Then Hitler did preemptive strikes,
invasion. Bush has targeted Iraq, Iran and North Korea, stating (2002) &quot;The United
States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous destructive weapons.&quot;

And Dr Boje's  &lt; http://peaceaware.com/documents/24_ways_Bush_is_like_Hitler.htm &gt; &quot;24
ways Bush and Hitler are too much alike for comfort&quot;:

President George W. Bush, like Adolf Hitler, came to power legally, but not
democratically. [...] Hitler invoked the spectre of &quot;the Red Menace,&quot; while Bush
pronounces the spectre of the &quot;Evil Axis.&quot; [...] The US propaganda machine requires that
every American dehumanize Afghanistan, Iraq, and North Korean lives. Just like Germany,
the US people are consumed by fear, brought about by the propaganda of the State and
Mass Media. [...]

Protestors in Greece, 2003

In an April &lt; http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?SectionID=15&amp;ItemID;=3403 &gt;  2003
ZMag report, some demonstrations in Greece are described:

&quot;We Greeks have been through so much - dictatorships, Balkan wars, not to mention the
Roman and Ottoman occupations&quot; says a placard-carrying man who has been singing along to
a traditional Greek ballad played by a nearby accordionist. &quot;We are a small country but
we have the experience to know that war is not the answer&quot;. His placard features a
moustachioed Bush with the inscription &quot;Adolf Bushler&quot;. ... &quot;Can you really compare Bush
with Hitler?&quot; asks Vincent Moloi, my fellow filmmaker from Johannesburg. We are in
Greece to shoot a documentary. &quot;Sure, both were obsessed with their own power, and
prepared to kill other nations to expand it,&quot; comes the reply.

And:

Today a hundred hair stylists peer through their make-up at their unwashed countrymen on
the streets, carrying yet more banners comparing Bush to Hitler and denouncing Greek
hypocrisy. The creativity of the slogan-writers put even the most experienced Soweto
strugglistas to shame with their range and rhythm. &quot;Disaster! Disaster! We Wont Allow
The War to Take Place Here!&quot; shouts the animator through a megaphone. &quot;Shame! Shame.
Chania Will Never be a Base for Killing Children!&quot; bellows the reply from a hundred
perfectly aligned lungs.
As dusk falls at the Suda Naval Base, these young Greeks prepare for a huge party. On
the main road to the base, weaving through the hills high above the water, twenty
teenagers are sitting on the white lines in the middle of the road, the words &quot;Fuck Bush
No War&quot; sprayed in red on the tarmac.

Yes, I can see how that degree of sloganeer creativity would put people to shame.

onto the &quot;Bush = Hitler&quot; wagon:

I realize I am a few months behind the curve of comparing Bush to Hitler, but there is
one aspect of the comparison that I don't think has been plumbed to its proper depth.
No, I am not talking about the vicious attacks against dissent, the dubious means used
to seize power, or the callous disregard for civil rights. Those have been given their
due. Instead, now that Bush is describing himself as a &quot;war president,&quot; I think it is
appropriate to size up Bush as he compares to the Furher as commander in chief, because
both serve as good examples of what happens when you hand the world's best military to a
petulant egomaniac.

World Socialist Web Site

In January 2002 &lt; http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/jan2002/bush-j31.shtml &gt; , on the
State Of The Union speech:

Despite Bush's attempt to resurrect the rhetoric of World War II in his reference to the
&quot;axis of evil,&quot; it is the US government and Bush himself who are following in the
footsteps of the Nazis. One would have to go back to the diatribes of Adolf Hitler to
find comparable bellicosity in the public declarations of a major world power, and
comparable cynicism in the lies and provocations employed as justifications for military
aggression. ... like Hitler and the Nazis, American militarism has embarked on a
campaign of world conquest ... Like Hitler, Bush presents an upside-down view of the
world

In February 2002 &lt; http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/feb2002/iraq-f16.shtml &gt; :

The language used is particularly ominous. Not since Nazi Germany-with Hitler's demands
for immediate liquidation of &quot;the Czech problem&quot; or &quot;the Polish problem&quot;-has a world
power spoken in such terms, or acted with such blatant disregard for international
opinion. ...

In March 2003 &lt; http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/mar2003/azor-m17.shtml &gt; :

The White House has repeatedly employed false analogies to the 1930s to justify its
policies, with ludicrous comparisons of Iraq, a weak and impoverished country, to Nazi
Germany. There is a parallel to Hitler, but it involves Bush and not Saddam Hussein. ...

And the next day &lt; http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/mar2003/bush-m18.shtml &gt; , on Bush's
pre-war speech:

Not since the 1930s, during the hey-day of the fascist regimes of Hitler and Mussolini,
has the government of any major power so openly embraced war as an instrument of state
policy as the Bush administration. In doing so, it has embarked upon a path that will,
unless stopped, lead the world into a new epoch of imperialist barbarism and result in
the deaths of hundreds of millions of people throughout the planet. ...
In the 1930s the fascist regimes in Germany and Italy walked out of the League of
Nations ... This characterization of Nazi foreign policy applies fully to that of the
United States today.

Politicians

John Valder (elder of the Australian Liberal Party)

Speech in December, &lt; http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/12/01/1070127355348.html &gt;
2003: &quot;It is probably no exaggeration to say that the invasion of Iraq amounts to the
greatest act of aggression by any Western nation since the days of Hitler's Germany.
Maybe atrocity is a more accurate word than aggression.&quot;

Fidel Castro

In his May Day speech 2003, responding to criticisms of Cuba's human rights
&lt; http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2003/537/537p17.htm &gt;  record, Castro said:

&quot;Today the so-called dissidents, actually mercenaries on the payroll of the Bush's
Hitler-like government, are betraying not only their homeland, but all of humanity as
well...&quot;

And again in
&lt; http://www.emedia.com.my/Current_News/NST/AfpNews/20040622052500/inde... &gt;  June
2004...

... Castro wore his olive-green military uniform as he spoke before a 12-meter (40-foot)
likeness of Bush, also in a military uniform and daubed with a Hitler-style mustache.
Below the photo, hung near the US Interests Section in Havana, was the text: &quot;Bush,
Fascist: There Is No Aggression Cuba Cannot Resist.&quot; ...

Government of North Korea

As reported in &lt; http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/07/1078594236177.html &gt;  the
Sydney Morning Herald, &quot;Bush = Hitler&quot; is on the North Korean school curriculum:

North Korea is using The Diary of Anne Frank, the moving account of the Amsterdam
schoolgirl forced into hiding from the Nazis for two years, to brainwash schoolchildren
into believing that President George Bush is as evil as Hitler.
Secondary schools throughout the Stalinist state are teaching pupils that the experience
of their country - which is almost completely cut off from the outside world - is
directly comparable to that of the Frank family during the Nazi occupation of the
Netherlands. Schools use the diaries to teach pupils about Hitler, and then teach that
America is the modern equivalent of the Nazis. ...
Mirjam Bartelsman, a reporter with the [Dutch TV] Nova channel, met students who had
been carefully drilled to spout hatred of &quot;American Nazis&quot;. One pupil interviewed on
camera declared: &quot;That warmonger Bush is just as bad as Hitler. Because of him we will
always live in fear of war.&quot; ...

Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei

In August 2002 &lt; http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/0814-06.htm &gt; :

... &quot;Arrogance has drawn the bullying West into disgrace,&quot; the official IRNA news agency
quoted Khamenei as saying, &quot;and the president of a country which claims to support human
rights and freedom speaks the same language to the people of the world as Hitler used.&quot;

Ireland's OWN

10 &lt; http://www.irelandsown.net/bushhitler.html &gt;  March 2003 - Bush and Hitler: &quot;Whenever
I equate George Bush with Adolph Hitler many immediately conclude the comparison is
little more than hyperbole with a liberal sprinkling of exaggeration. You can almost
hear minds slamming shut and rational discourse being terminated, even though the
analogy is quite valid in many respects. ...&quot;

biblebelievers.org.au

Among the twisty maze of frankly rather scary delusions we find &quot;Invading
&lt; http://www.biblebelievers.org.au/nl269.htm &gt;  Iraq: Converging US and Israeli Agendas&quot;:

US policy in the George W. Bush era, is similar to the unprovoked aggression that the
world observed in the days of Hitler, Napoleon, Alexander the Great, and other leaders
who stepped onto the world stage with unrivaled military force. Characteristic of the
Bush team's brutal cynicism is their comparison of Saddam Hussein to Hitler when they
are the ones who most resemble Hitler in their power, their ruthless determination for
war at all costs and their threat to world peace and security.

This seems a little... odd given that the rest of the site seems to mainly consist of a
heady mix of frothingly antisemitic explanations of how Hitler wasn't such
