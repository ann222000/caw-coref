Conduct of Orrin P. Rockwell - 1845 &amp; 1846
Warsaw Signal - December 10, 1845

O. P. ROCKWELL. -- This delectable specimen of humanity, who was once
the peculiar pet of Joe Smith and has since been regarded as the main
champion of Zion in the Holy City, who some time since refused to bury
his own child, but suffered it to be done at public expense, who was
during the late difficulties Gen. Napoleon Backenstos' principal aid-
de-camp, and rode by his side while making the valiant charge on
unarmed and unresisting men, this same O. P. Rockwell, the assassin of
Governor Boggs, has taken to himself a wife -- not his own wife, for
be it remembered that he cast off the woman that the law regarded as
his wife long since; but he has appropriated to himself the wife of
Amos Davis. It is generally the case that when a wife leaves her
husband to live with a seducer, they elope and settle in a place where
they are not known; but there is no necessity for such a step in the
Holy Nauvoo. So fashionable is it for the Heads of the church to
appropriate the wives of other men to their own purposes, that it is
regarded as no crime for one man to steal the companion of his
neighbor and live with her in open unconcealed adultery. What a
beautiful moral code is Mormonism!

LIFE IN NAUVOO. -- We learn that one day last week, O. P, Rockwell and
his new wife, (who it will be recollected is the lawful wife of Amos
Davis,) went together to the house of said Davis. Rockwell stood at
the door, with a pistol in his hand, while his delectable partner
entered the house &amp; took from it such furniture as she desired. This
was in open day light and in the face of the whole City; yet no one
was shocked or astonished. In Nauvoo such proceedings are all a matter
of course.

Warsaw Signal - February 11, 1846

O. P. ROCKWELL STABBED. -- Our readers were informed, some weeks
since, the O. P. Rockwell had taken the wife of Amos Davis to himself.
Davis seemed to take this trespass on his rights very quietly, and it
was generally supposed that resentment was not in him. After living
with Rockwell some time, Mrs. Davis desired to return to her husband,
but we have not heard whether he received her. However, Rockwell and
Davis quarreled last week about the matter, and the latter drew a
spear from his cane &amp; stabbed the former in the side. Rockwell's wound
is not serious, he having pushed the spear aside from the spot where
it was aimed.

ARREST  OF  O. P. ROCKWELL.
We learn that this notorious cut throat was arrested on Friday morning
last, in Nauvoo, on the charge of murdering F. A. Worrel. The warrant
was issued in Carthage on the affidavit of Dr. Watson, who heard
Rockwell make confessions sufficient for his conviction, and five of
the Hancock Guard were sent down to Nauvoo to execute it.

A correspondent furnishes us with the following particulars of the
arrest.

&quot;The Troops went to Backenstos' house and a little before day
Backenstos and C. Higbee went with them to the house where they
supposed Rockwell had gone to roost, having watched him till late in
the evening. They searched the house from bottom to top without
success; they then searched a second house without finding him; but by
accident, as it were, they found out that he was in a certain three
story Brick house, some distance from where they were then searching.

They repaired thither immediately, Backenstos leading the way. On
arriving at the house Backenstos rapped at the door. The owner of the
house Mr. Sanders, enquired who was there; to which Backenstos replied
that it was his &quot;friend Backenstos the Sheriff.&quot; The door being
opened, Backenstos told him that the troops were there for the purpose
of arresting Rockwell; that they were determined to take him dead or
alive. S. told him Rockwell was not there, Backenstos said he knew
better and that he had better go up and bring him down and save
farther trouble. The Landlord then ran up stairs and returned in a
short time saying that Rockwell, would not be taken. Rockwell, it
seems, was up in the upper storey. The stairs that led to his room
were narrow and winding, just wide enough to admit one person at a
time. -- The troops waited and consulted about three hours as to the
best means of getting him.

Rockwell put his head out of a window, two horse pistols were leveled
at it immediately; but in the twinkling of an eye he drew it in again.
Backenstos ventured to the foot of his stairs. Rockwell ordered him to
stop, which he did. They all then went below and some one of them told
the man of the house to take out his family and a few of his valuable
goods, as they were going to shut the doors and burn the house down.
He endeavored to argue the case; but the troops would not hear to it.
He then went above and prevailed on Rockwell to give himself up, which
he did. Rockwell had with him 2 fifteen shooters, 2 six shooters, a
brace of single shooters and a Bowie knife.

The troops started this morning with him for Quincy having waived an
examination and desired to be committed.&quot;

It appears that Rockwell after his last return to the Holy city,
hearing that Governor Ford had disbanded the Guard, charged around
more violently than he had ever done before, He yelled about the city
a la Indian -- swore the Governor had dismissed Major Warren and given
him command in Hancock, and he intended now to go it on the loud. So
violent and boisterous was he, that many of the Saints became alarmed
least he would commit some act of violence which would arouse the
surrounding country.

After his arrest on the charge of murder he was taken on the charge of
counterfeiting and passing counterfeit money.

It will be recalled that last fall O. P. Rockwell was J. B.
Backenstos' right hand man. It now appears that Backenstos has turned
against him; probably he began to fear that Rockwell's indiscretion
might ruin his prospects.

THE  CIRCUIT  COURT
For Hancock County commenced its session on Monday of last week, &amp;
closed on Saturday Morning. Considerable business was despatched
during the week. -- The terrible forebodings of the Hancock Eagle were
not realized -- as no event occurred to mar the general tranquility.

An indictment was found against O. P. Rockwell, for the murder of
Franklin A. Worrell, in September last; and a change of venue has been
taken to Jo Daviess county for trial.

The prisoner was brought up from the Quincy Jail, on Monday, by
officer Pitman, and confined in the Carthage Jail until his case was
disposed of, when he was again taken to Quincy.

Other indictments were found -- one against Wm. Backenstos (the former
Sheriff [sic]) for Perjury -- another for Swindling, and one against
Gen. W. Stigall for passing counterfeit money.
