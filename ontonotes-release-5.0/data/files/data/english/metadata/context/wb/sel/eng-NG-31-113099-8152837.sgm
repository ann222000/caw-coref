The burial practices of the Khazars were transformed sometime in the 9th
century. Shamanistic sun-amulets disappeared from Khazar graves after the
830s, according to Bozena Werbart, and so did other sorts of items:
&quot;The clear indications of Christian [of Stablo] and al-Faqih that the
Khazars en masse adopted Judaism may be collated with an archaeological
phenomenon. Only quite recently have there been identified graves which can
most probably be ascribed to the Khazars. They are distinguished by a
particular lay-out, being barrows raised over graves which are surrounded by
square or on occasion circular trenches; these trenches are often filled
with the remains of animal sacrifices. There are analogies to this form of
ritual in the homes for the dead in early Turk sites in the Altai region.
The inventories have many features in common with those of other burials of
the Saltovo-Mayatskii culture, such as the riding-gear and bow-and-arrows of
the cavalrymen, together with the skull or skeleton of his horse, the
skeleton being saddled and harnessed. But the graves in question often,
though not invariably, stand out from other Saltovo-Mayatskii burials by
their wealth. One salient feature of these graves is their lack of
inventories datable to the tenth century. The Byzantine coins are of the
late seventh and earlier eighth centuries, while the belt-mounts, weaponry,
and stirrups are of types generally dated to the eighth and ninth centuries.
Even allowing for the approximate nature of archaeological periodization,
the absence of things clearly datable to the tenth century is noteworthy. It
seems reasonable to conclude that the Khazars as a collective changed to
some other form of burial-ritual. Various explanations for a change might be
offered, but one obvious cause would be the mass-adoption of a religion
which disapproved of horse-sacrifices and burnt offerings. Even had
Christian of Stablo exaggerated in stating that the Khazars adopted 'Judaism
in full' in the 860s, their conversion might || well have led to the
abandonment of some of the most fragrantly pagan features of their
burial-ritual, trenches forming hollow squares among them.&quot; - Jonathan
Shepard, &quot;The Khazars' Formal Adoption of Judaism and Byzantium's Northern
Policy.&quot; Oxford Slavonic Papers, New Series 31 (1998): 16-17.

a.. Khazarian and Hebraic imagery can often be found on the same artifact:

&quot;It is certain that Khazar Jews lived in Phanagoria (Tmutorokan), since
over sixty tombstones bearing Jewish symbols (such as seven-branched
menorahs, shofars, and lulavs) on one side and Turkic tribe symbols (tamgas)
on the other side were found on the Taman peninsula. Many of these
tombstones date from the eighth or ninth century. Khazarian tombstones on
the Crimean peninsula also depict the shofar, menorah, and staff of Aaron,
as well as Turkic tribe symbols... The artifacts from Taman and Crimea are
extremely significant since their tamgas show that these Jews were ethnic
Turks.&quot; - Kevin Alan Brook, in The Jews of Khazaria (Jason Aronson, 1999),

a.. In 2002, a coin from the Viking &quot;Spillings Hoard&quot; of Gotland, Sweden was
identified as having been minted by Jewish Khazars, due to its markings and
its inscription &quot;Moses is the messenger of God&quot; in place of the usual Muslim
inscription &quot;Muhammad is the messenger of God&quot;. The coin is an imitation of
Arabic coinage and contains the fictitious mintmark &quot;Madinat as-Salam
779-80&quot;. Numismatists conclude that it was actually minted in 837 or 838 in
Khazaria.

&quot;One of the most important coins in the hoard, dating from AD 830 to 840,
sheds light on a place far away: Its markings show its provenance is the
kingdom of the Khazars, a realm in southern Russia between the Black and
Caspian seas. Its Arabic inscription reads 'Moses is the messenger of God' -
apparently a Jewish variant on the Islamic credo 'Mohammed is the messenger
of God.' Only four other coins are known to have this inscription.&quot; -
&quot;Viking treasure hoard yields astounding finds&quot;, China Daily (June 24,
2002).

&quot;The prophets Mahomet and Moses gathered on the same piece dating from the
830s: it is the exceptionally lucky find of a Swedish orientalist and which,
for the first time, materially connects the disappeared empire of the
Khazars to Judaism.... Because even though it is worn out well in the upper
part of the side [of the coin], crushing the traditional Muslim inscription
'Mahomet is the messenger of God', one can read in the bottom this small,
apparently improper sentence, 'Moses is the messenger of God'. When Gert
Rispling, Swedish numismatist and orientalist, made this lucky find among
the treasure brought back by Jonas Ström, he shouts victory. This dirham is
indeed the missing link of a series of 4 already-known Islamic pieces with
this inscription of Moses, but whose different first side had not made it
possible to establish the origin. Thanks to this piece, we can go back up
until 'Ard al-Khazar', the country of Khazars. It is there [in Itil] that
the pieces were struck. 'But they are in fact imitations. The original
pieces came from the caliphate [of Baghdad]... And, as was the custom, when
a face was worn [out], one struck another inscription in its place... But
the handling was so unrefined that one could use them only in Northern
Europe or Russia, where only their silver weight counted... To add Moses on
such a piece can be made only by a Jew' [Gert Rispling explained].&quot; -

a.. Hebrew characters were allegedly found engraved on utensils from a
Khazarian site in the Don river valley of Russia. One prominent scholar
thinks this discovery is a hoax, and no solid evidence of the discovery has
yet been presented to a scholarly journal or conference, despite the
unconfirmed allegation that it was mentioned at the 1st International Khazar
Studies Colloquium by Gennadii Afanasyev.

a.. A so-called &quot;Jewish Khazar&quot; ring was buried in a grave in medieval
Hungary:

&quot;A silver ring found in a cemetery in Ellend, near Pécs in southwestern
Hungary and not far from the villages of Nagykozár and Kiskozár, is believed
to be of Khazar-Kabar origin. The ring, which dates from the second half of
the eleventh century, was found next to a woman's skeleton, and has thirteen
Hebrew letters engraved on it as ornamentation.&quot; - Kevin Alan Brook, The
Jews of Khazaria (Jason Aronson, 1999), pages 208-209, following the
argument of Alexander Scheiber and Attila Kiss which was also adopted by
Raphael Patai and Eli Valley. However, it does not spell out real Hebrew
words, and is mixed with many non-Hebrew letters and symbols. Scheiber,
Kiss, and others argued that the woman was from one of the two nearby Khazar
villages.

a.. Jewish symbols were placed on bricks at another burial site in medieval
Hungary, which is now located in northern Serbia:

&quot;In 1972, 263 graves were discovered near the village of Chelarevo, in the
Vojvodina district of present-day Serbia... More important, Jewish motifs
have been found on at least seventy of the brick fragments excavated from
the graves. The Jewish symbols on the fragments include menorahs, shofars,
etrogs, candle-snuffers, and ash-collectors. One of the brick fragments,
which was placed over the grave of Yehudah, has a Hebrew inscription that
reads, 'Yehudah, oh!' The skulls in the Chelarevo graves had Mongolian
features...&quot; - Kevin Alan Brook, The Jews of Khazaria (Jason Aronson, 1999),
page 251.

&quot;One can conjecture that this burial ground belonged to the Kabar tribes
which joined the Hungarians at the time when they discovered their
fatherland. Some of the Kabars, arriving from Khazaria, apparently kept
their Judaic religion.&quot; - István Erdélyi, &quot;Kabari (Kavari) v Karpatskom
Basseyne.&quot; Sovietskaya Arkheologiya 4 (1983): 179.

&quot;The early-medieval graveyard and settlement at CHelarevo, near Novi Sad,
offers the most numerous and most unusual finds with Jewish symbols. Along
with several hundreds of graves of typically Avaric characteristics (judging
by the pottery, jewellery and horsemen's gear), excavations begun in 1972
produced several hundreds of graves of the same shape but lacking any
additional burial objects.... each grave was marked by a fragment of a Roman
brick (never a whole brick, although these were plentiful in the near-by
older Roman sites) into which a menorah was cut, and most frequently two
other Jewish symbols on its left and right sides: the shofar and an etrog, a
lulav on some bricks, and even a small Jewish six-pointed star. Some 450
brick fragments have so far been found. The position and size of the incised
motifs were adapted to the size and shape of each of the fragments, which
means that the motifs were not there on the original whole bricks. Some of
the fragments had a Hebrew inscription added - a name or a few words which,
with the exception of JERUSALEM and ISRAEL, are difficult to decipher
because of the damage. Some of the Hebrew characters are carved with great
precision.... Several hypotheses have been proposed on the possible origin
of a Jewish or Judaised population who marked the graves of their dead in
this unusual way and had literate people among them. The influence of the
Crimea Khazars has been mentioned in this context; their ruler, nobility and
part of the population were Judaised in the 8 c., and many Jews who had
emigrated from Asia Minor and Byzantium, lived among them.&quot; - Ante Soric et
al (editors), Jews in Yugoslavia: Muzejski prostor, Zagreb, Jezuitski trg 4.
(Zagreb: MGC, 1989), page 28.

&quot;In excavations at a large graveyard apparently dating to the end of the
eighth and beginning of the ninth centuries, when the region was under the
domination of the Avar tribe, archeologists have unearthed hundreds of brick
fragments inscribed with menorahs and other Jewish symbols, including at
least one small six-pointed Star of David. Some brick fragments also were
inscribed with Hebrew letters. Research has shown that the people buried at
Celarevo were of the Mongol race, apparently a tribe that had newly migrated
into the area from the east. Beyond that, the origin of this Jewish
settlement remains a mystery: One hypothesis has suggested that they may
have been influenced by the Crimean Khazars, a tribe whose leaders converted
to Judaism in the eighth century.&quot; - Ruth Ellen Gruber, Jewish Heritage
Travel, 3rd edition (Jason Aronson, 1999), page 248.
