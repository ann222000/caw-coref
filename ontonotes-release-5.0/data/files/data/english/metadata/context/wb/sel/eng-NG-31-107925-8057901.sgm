EVERYONE knows how Jr. sandbagged during the early part of the year,
when he and his siblings were sooo unsuccessful in the attempt to
wrest control of DEI from Teresa.

Listen, the esteemed and great Dale Earnhardt left it to Teresa
because she was the best thing to happen to him in his life.  Dale got
screwed around by just about everyone - his former wife, and the kids
notwithstanding.

If Dale HAD of thought much of his kids, he surely would have written
them in to some accommodations of the kingdom he built.  But he did
not, so it is clear he felt the kids had not served him well.  Or else
maybe he thought they were clingers-on.  Either way, he didn't include
them.  Period, paragraph, pffftttttt!

and everyone knows how much more money the evil Hendrick camp gets
than DEI.  PLUS has two more cars to 'play around with' - they try all
kinds of things to get around the rules, and find out how they can
escape detection.

but they (hendrick motorsports) have been caught with their hands in
the cookie jar many, many times.

DEI runs a more honest operations, and it is a tribute to the lovely,
talented, and very honest businesswoman Teresa Earnhardt.

I don't really expect many responses to this thread, as there is
little ANYONE can dispute!

We do not know the majority of the above.
Just because someone is not given assets (or training, or assistance,
or 'chits', or sound advice) in the will, clearly does not mean they
were not provided for.
And that is one of the biggest advantages of either durable
(irrevokable) trusts, or living (revokable) trusts - they are
private matters.  Wills are publicly available, but trusts
are not.
It is very possible to pass on many things to ones you care
about without doing it in a will.  Assets already placed
in a trust do not go through probate.

OK.  But the above type thought (&quot;if not in will - then nothing&quot;)
is expressed often enough that certainly many people belive it.
So I had a couple minutes before going to bed to try to inform.
It might help some learn about something very useful.

Dear Noone,
You were right.  I tried to inform with very useful information,
but it appears it was a waste of time with him.

Oh well, maybe someone else reading got something helpful.
(yes indeed, having your real estate properties and/or
stock and fund portfolios 'owned' by a trust can avoid many
delays, problems, and exposure.)

Well, you SAY it &quot;we do not know the majority of the above&quot;, so it

Listen - pal or toots - are you THAT stupid?  Those WORTHLESS (yes
WORTHLESS!) kids of Dale Earnhardt proved it to their diddy that they
were not worthy of having ANYTHING he accumulated.  And he left it to
the sweet, lovely, very talented, good manager, and wifey Teresa
Earnhardt - for all she EVAH did for him.

So, hey.... *tossing you a quarter*...buy a clue why dont'cha?  And be

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll respond. but dispute only one kinda 'side issue'.
&gt; &gt; &gt; We do not know the majority of the above.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just because someone is not given assets (or training, or assistance,
&gt; &gt; &gt; or 'chits', or sound advice) in the will, clearly does not mean they
&gt; &gt; &gt; were not provided for.
&gt; &gt; &gt; And that is one of the biggest advantages of either durable
&gt; &gt; &gt; (irrevokable) trusts, or living (revokable) trusts - they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; private matters.  Wills are publicly available, but trusts
&gt; &gt; &gt; are not.
&gt; &gt; &gt; It is very possible to pass on many things to ones you care
&gt; &gt; &gt; about without doing it in a will.  Assets already placed
&gt; &gt; &gt; in a trust do not go through probate.
&gt; &gt; L, I can't believe you wasted your time on this moron.

&gt; Dear Noone,
&gt; You were right.  I tried to inform with very useful information,
&gt; but it appears it was a waste of time with him.

&quot;very useful information&quot;...well, from an idiot like you, that's like
going to buy a USA Today paper and only have a nickle or a dime.  You
have a very longgggg way to go, pal or his bitchress...
