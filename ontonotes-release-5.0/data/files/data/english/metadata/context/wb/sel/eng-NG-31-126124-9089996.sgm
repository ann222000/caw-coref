Addicted To Deception: What Passes For History These Days

I ran into a most peculiar book the other day--a comic book
presentation of American foreign policy, titled, Addicted to War: Why
The U.S. Can't Kick Militarism. What worries me is that a piece of
inaccurate and deceptive trash like this has been adopted by the San
Francisco Board of Education. As I've mentioned in the past:

I have some sympathy for the point of view that says that U.S.
intervention in the internal affairs of other countries have often
been counterproductive to democracy, capitalism, and human rights.
Libertarian critics of U.S. foreign policy claim that our intervention
in Central American countries in the early twentieth century was
driven by commercial interests. Major General Smedley Butler's War is
a Racket makes this claim concerning Nicaragua and Haiti--both places
where Butler played a major role in the operations. (There's nothing
quite as gauche as Butler walking into the Haitian Congress in 1915
and telling them to go home; he was now in charge.)

However: when I have dug through newspapers of the period, for
example, the 1909 intervention at Bluefields, Nicaragua, I often find
that the evidence as to intent is complex. Yes, there were often
commercial interests that had a clear reason to encourage those
interventions. The U.S., for example, ran Nicaragua's customs service
for a couple of decades until the tariffs paid off the debts that
Nicaragua owed to certain U.S. banking interests.

But there were often legitimate reasons for U.S. intervention as well,
such as protection of U.S. citizens in the midst of chaotic civil
wars. Sometimes, we stepped in because the locals were behaving in a
manner that was offensive to any proper notion of civil rights--for
example, when the President of Haiti was literally ripped limb from
limb in the streets of Port-au-Prince. And sad to say, in many of
these countries, it wasn't that we were intervening on the side of bad
guys at the expense of the good guys. Nicaragua, El Salvador, Haiti,
and Cuba are all examples of places where the differing factions were
arguing over who got to exploit and brutalize the peasants.

Cold War realpolitik took a bad situation in many parts of the world,
and made it worst. Lyndon Johnson's famous remark, &quot;He may be a
sonofabitch, but he's our sonofabitch&quot; captures this rather well. We
often chose one thug over another thug because the other thug had
allied himself with Moscow. Aggravating this was that local thugs
played Moscow vs. Washington for their benefit as well--and usually to
the detriment of the peasants who just wanted to be left alone.

There are serious criticisms of our pragmatic foreign policy out
there, not only by academics, but by politicians:

We seek democracy in that region for the same reasons we spent decades
working for democracy in Europe -- because freedom is the only
reliable path to peace. If the Middle East continues to simmer in
anger and resentment and hopelessness, caught in a cycle of repression
and radicalism, it will produce terrorism of even greater audacity and
destructive power. But if the peoples of that region gain the right of
self-government, and find hopes to replace their hatreds, then the
security of all free nations will be strengthened. We will not repeat
the mistakes of other generations, appeasing or excusing tyranny, and
sacrificing freedom in the vain pursuit of stability. We have learned
our lesson; no one's liberty is expendable. In the long run, our
security and true stability depend on the freedom of others. And so,
with confidence and resolve, we will stand for freedom across the
broader Middle East.

Addicted to War, however, does not qualify as a serious criticism--it
is such a distorted and inaccurate portrayal of U.S. foreign policy
history that even though many of the individual facts contained within
it are true (or at least appear to be true), it is in total, a lie.

The entire book is visible starting here. For example, page 1 blames
the problems of local schools not having enough toilet paper on
military spending--ignoring that nearly all school funding is from
state and local governments--not the federal government. But as part
of the author's deception, page 1 claims that &quot;A huge part of the
money that the IRS takes out of our paychecks goes to support the
military,&quot; and shows a pie chart that claims that 51% of all
discretionary spending in 2004 is for the military.

But that's a very misleading statement, because discretionary spending
is less than half the budget. I couldn't find the 2004 budget data,
but the 2008 budget data is here. On page 4 of that document you can
see a breakdown of 2007 federal spending, with 20.1% of the federal
spending going to defense spending, 18.5% going to non-defense
discretionary, 20.4% going to Medicare/Medicaid, and 20.9% to Social
Security. Defense spending is actually less than we spend on Medicare/
Medicaid. (A minor quibble--but payroll taxes aren't the only source
of federal revenue. This spreadsheet shows the breakdown of revenue
sources, and all payroll taxes combined for 2004 are about 82% of the
federal receipts.)

On page 2, Addicted to War claims that cutbacks in social programs
&quot;have caused far more devastation than any foreign army ever has.&quot;
That's a strong claim--but where are these cutbacks in social
programs? Over what period of time? Could we get some specifics?

I ask because this table shows spending by budget function from 1940
to 2011. Here's the inflation adjuster data; from 1940 to 2007,
inflation has caused a 14.56 times decrease in the value of the
dollar. Therefore, the 1940 Human Resources budget category spending
of $4,139,000,000 would be equivalent to $60,273,368,000 in 2007. But
the 2007 Human Resources budget estimate is 1,787,609,000,000--or 29x
larger. Our population has more than doubled since 1940, but even
adjusting the Human Resources budget for both inflation and population
change, we are spending more than 12x as much per person on social
spending today as we did in 1940.

Page 4 is a statement of how the Indians were slaughtered and driven
off their lands--but the problem is that it is a statement that is
only partly correct, and often quite incorrect. There's some pretty
shameful history in this area, but many of the lands east of the
Mississippi were acquired by purchase. Sometimes the persons selling
the lands weren't authorized by the rest of the tribe to make the
sale; sometimes, the people doing the buying were breaking federal law
by doing so (which required Congressional approval of such purchases);
sometimes, alcohol was used to &quot;lubricate&quot; the process. Many of the
lands that Indian tribes legitimately sold were because the presence
of so many settlers had driven much of the game away, and the tribe
decided that they were better off moving west. To make a single bald
statement such as this one about Indian removal is so often false that
it qualifies as deceptive.

Page 5's version of the Spanish-American War is so sloppy as to be
inaccurate. It is precisely &quot;progressive&quot; Democratic sorts like
William Randolph Hearst who pushed the U.S. to invade and liberate
Cuba--and Republicans like President McKinley resisted those calls as
long as they could. The claim that Spain was already on the verge of
defeat by independence movements in Cuba and the Philippines is
nonsense.

For example, Addicted to War devotes most of pages 10 and 11 to World
War II--and asserts that our involvement in World War II was because
of our desire to expand our economic empire. There is no mention that
Japan attacked the U.S., and that Germany declared war on the U.S.
before we declared war on them. Addicted to War neglects to mention
that liberating Europe from German military forces was one of the
goals--and of course, there's no mention of that little unpleasantness
that Allied forces broke up at Auschwitz, Dachau, and hundreds of
lesser known concentration camps across Europe. (After all, that's
something that only military intervention could have stopped.)

Page 12 reduces the entire Cold War to a struggle for world
domination. There's no mention of one fundamental difference between
the Soviet Union and the United States: one of them censored opposing
political ideas; prohibited its citizens from leaving the country;
murdered millions of its own people, sometimes because they were
political dissenters, but often because it was a police state built
around paranoia; and in general, did not tolerate dissent such as
Addicted to War.

To give you some idea of how utterly delusional Addicted to War is, go
look at the first page of chapter 7, where he explains that the reason
that Americans support our foreign policy is because news
organizations are cheerleaders for it.

Addicted to War has a list of notes, but looking through the notes
makes you realize that this guy started out with a conclusion, and
then looked for sources that would agree with him. Hence, the grossly
distorted history. He relies very heavily on Howard Zinn's A People's
History of the United States, and a number of books by Noam Chomsky,
and several books published by International Publishers, the Communist
Party USA's publishing arm.

Now, there's nothing wrong with using sources such as these to get a
broad range of viewpoints--but reading his list of sources makes you
realize that the author did not even try to get more than one
perspective--hence, it is not just the layout that is a comic book,
but also the ideas contained therein.

One of the great weaknesses of Marxist reductionism (of which Addicted
to War is a prime example), is that the real world is more complex
than simple formulae. What is especially troubling is not that this is
amateur history written by someone who hasn't a clue about the
expectations of intellectual integrity, like certain other books of
similar

Chomsky's books are prophetic. He has been writing about this for years

The OP is disagreeing with the OOP, who said, &quot;Every time a
Republican is elected president, the U.S. goes to war.&quot;  In fact,
every time anyone was elected president since about the time
of McKinley, the U.S. has gone to war, with the possible
exception of Jimmy Carter (which is why everyone put him
down, I guess), and those like Nixon who had a ready-made
war served up to them.

In fact, the Republican Party used to be &quot;isolationist&quot;, that
is, non-interventionist, non-imperial, whereas the Democrats
were the great fans of intervention (imperialism) everywhere.
Now, both parties seem to be fully signed on to the imperial
project, the difference being that the Democrats say they
will be smarter about it -- next time; last time most of them
voted for Bush's war, as you may recall.

&gt; Addicted To Deception: What Passes For History These Days

&gt; I ran into a most peculiar book the other day--a comic book
&gt; presentation of American foreign policy, titled, Addicted to War: Why
&gt; The U.S. Can't Kick Militarism. What worries me is that a piece of
&gt; inaccurate and deceptive trash like this has been adopted by the San
&gt; Francisco Board of Education. As I've mentioned in the past:

&gt; I have some sympathy for the point of view that says that U.S.
&gt; intervention in the internal affairs of other countries have often
&gt; been counterproductive to democracy, capitalism, and human rights.
&gt; Libertarian critics of U.S. foreign policy claim that our intervention
&gt; in Central American countries in the early twentieth century was
&gt; driven by commercial interests. Major General Smedley Butler's War is
&gt; a Racket makes this claim concerning Nicaragua and Haiti--both places
&gt; where Butler played a major role in the operations. (There's nothing
&gt; quite as gauche as Butler walking into the Haitian Congress in 1915
&gt; and telling them to go home; he was now in charge.)

&gt; However: when I have dug through newspapers of the period, for
&gt; example, the 1909 intervention at Bluefields, Nicaragua, I often find
&gt; that the evidence as to intent is complex. Yes, there were often
&gt; commercial interests that had a clear reason to encourage those
&gt; interventions. The U.S., for example, ran Nicaragua's customs service
&gt; for a couple of decades until the tariffs paid off the debts that
&gt; Nicaragua owed to certain U.S. banking interests.

&gt; But there were often legitimate reasons for U.S. intervention as well,
&gt; such as protection of U.S. citizens in the midst of chaotic civil
&gt; wars. Sometimes, we stepped in because the locals were behaving in a
&gt; manner that was offensive to any proper notion of civil rights--for
&gt; example, when the President of Haiti was literally ripped limb from
&gt; limb in the streets of Port-au-Prince. And sad to say, in many of
&gt; these countries, it wasn't that we were intervening on the side of bad
&gt; guys at the expense of the good guys. Nicaragua, El Salvador, Haiti,
&gt; and Cuba are all examples of places where the differing factions were
&gt; arguing over who got to exploit and brutalize the peasants.

&gt; Cold War realpolitik took a bad situation in many parts of the world,
&gt; and made it worst. Lyndon Johnson's famous remark, &quot;He may be a
&gt; sonofabitch, but he's our sonofabitch&quot; captures this rather well. We
&gt; often chose one thug over another thug because the other thug had
&gt; allied himself with Moscow. Aggravating this was that local thugs
&gt; played Moscow vs. Washington for their benefit as well--and usually to
&gt; the detriment of the peasants who just wanted to be left alone.

&gt; There are serious criticisms of our pragmatic foreign policy out
&gt; there, not only by academics, but by politicians:

&gt; We seek democracy in that region for the same reasons we spent decades
&gt; working for democracy in Europe -- because freedom is the only
&gt; reliable path to peace. If the Middle East continues to simmer in
&gt; anger and resentment and hopelessness, caught in a cycle of repression
&gt; and radicalism, it will produce terrorism of even greater audacity and
&gt; destructive power. But if the peoples of that region gain the right of
&gt; self-government, and find hopes to replace their hatreds, then the
&gt; security of all free nations will be strengthened. We will not repeat
&gt; the mistakes of other generations, appeasing or excusing tyranny, and
&gt; sacrificing freedom in the vain pursuit of stability. We have learned
&gt; our lesson; no one's liberty is expendable. In the long run, our
&gt; security and true stability depend on the freedom of others. And so,
&gt; with confidence and resolve, we will stand for freedom across the
&gt; broader Middle East.

&gt; Addicted to War, however, does not qualify as a serious criticism--it
&gt; is such a distorted and inaccurate portrayal of U.S. foreign policy
&gt; history that even though many of the individual facts contained within
&gt; it are true (or at least appear to be true), it is in total, a lie.

&gt; The entire book is visible starting here. For example, page 1 blames
&gt; the problems of local schools not having enough toilet paper on
&gt; military spending--ignoring that nearly all school funding is from
&gt; state and local governments--not the federal government. But as part
&gt; of the author's deception, page 1 claims that &quot;A huge part of the
&gt; money that the IRS takes out of our paychecks goes to support the
&gt; military,&quot; and shows a pie chart that claims that 51% of all
&gt; discretionary spending in 2004 is for the military.

&gt; But that's a very misleading statement, because discretionary spending
&gt; is less than half the budget. I couldn't find the 2004 budget data,
&gt; but the 2008 budget data is here. On page 4 of that document you can
&gt; see a breakdown of 2007 federal spending, with 20.1% of the federal
&gt; spending going to defense spending, 18.5% going to non-defense
&gt; discretionary, 20.4% going to Medicare/Medicaid, and 20.9% to Social
&gt; Security. Defense spending is actually less than we spend on Medicare/
&gt; Medicaid. (A minor quibble--but payroll taxes aren't the only source
&gt; of federal revenue. This spreadsheet shows the breakdown of revenue
&gt; sources, and all payroll taxes combined for 2004 are about 82% of the
&gt; federal receipts.)

&gt; On page 2, Addicted to War claims that cutbacks in social programs
&gt; &quot;have caused far more devastation than any foreign army ever has.&quot;
&gt; That's a strong claim--but where are these cutbacks in social
&gt; programs? Over what period of time? Could we get some specifics?

&gt; I ask because this table shows spending by budget function from 1940
&gt; to 2011. Here's the inflation adjuster data; from 1940 to 2007,
&gt; inflation has caused a 14.56 times decrease in the value of the
&gt; dollar. Therefore, the 1940 Human Resources budget category spending
&gt; of $4,139,000,000 would be equivalent to $60,273,368,000 in 2007. But
&gt; the 2007 Human Resources budget estimate is 1,787,609,000,000--or 29x
&gt; larger. Our population has more than doubled since 1940, but even
&gt; adjusting the Human Resources budget for both inflation and population
&gt; change, we are spending more than 12x as much per person on social
&gt; spending today as we did in 1940.

&gt; Page 4 is a statement of how the Indians were slaughtered and driven
&gt; off their lands--but the problem is that it is a statement that is
&gt; only partly correct, and often quite incorrect. There's some pretty
&gt; shameful history in this area, but many of the lands east of the
&gt; Mississippi were acquired by purchase. Sometimes the persons selling
&gt; the lands weren't authorized by the rest of the tribe to make the
&gt; sale; sometimes, the people doing the buying were breaking federal law
&gt; by doing so (which required Congressional approval of such purchases);
&gt; sometimes, alcohol was used to &quot;lubricate&quot; the process. Many of the
&gt; lands that Indian tribes legitimately sold were because the presence
&gt; of so many settlers had driven much of the game away, and the tribe
&gt; decided that they were better off moving west. To make a single bald
&gt; statement such as this one about Indian removal is so often false that
&gt; it qualifies as deceptive.

&gt; Page 5's version of the Spanish-American War is so sloppy as to be
&gt; inaccurate. It is precisely &quot;progressive&quot; Democratic sorts like
&gt; William Randolph Hearst who pushed the U.S. to invade and liberate
&gt; Cuba--and Republicans like President McKinley resisted those calls as
&gt; long as they could. The claim that Spain was already on the verge of
&gt; defeat by independence movements in Cuba and the Philippines is
&gt; nonsense.

&gt; For example, Addicted to War devotes most of pages 10 and 11 to World
&gt; War II--and asserts that our involvement in World War II was because
&gt; of our desire to expand our economic empire. There is no mention that
&gt; Japan attacked the U.S., and that Germany declared war on the U.S.
&gt; before we declared war on them. Addicted to War neglects to mention
&gt; that liberating Europe from German military forces was one of the
&gt; goals--and of course, there's no mention of that little unpleasantness
&gt; that Allied forces broke up at Auschwitz, Dachau, and hundreds of
&gt; lesser known concentration camps across Europe. (After all, that's
&gt; something that only military intervention could have stopped.)

&gt; Page 12 reduces the entire Cold War to a struggle for world
&gt; domination. There's no mention of one fundamental difference between
&gt; the Soviet Union and the United States: one of them censored opposing
&gt; political ideas; prohibited its citizens from leaving the country;
&gt; murdered millions of its own people, sometimes because they were
&gt; political dissenters, but often because it was a police state built
&gt; around paranoia; and in general, did not tolerate dissent such as
&gt; Addicted to War.

&gt; To give you some idea of how utterly delusional Addicted to War is, go
&gt; look at the first page of chapter 7, where he explains that the reason
&gt; that Americans support our foreign policy is because news
&gt; organizations are cheerleaders for it.

&gt; Addicted to War has a list of notes, but looking through the notes
&gt; makes you realize that this guy started out with a conclusion, and
&gt; then looked for sources that would agree with him. Hence, the grossly
&gt; distorted history. He relies very heavily on Howard Zinn's A People's
&gt; History of the United States, and a number of books by Noam Chomsky,
&gt; and several books published by International Publishers, the Communist
&gt; Party USA's publishing arm.

&gt; Now, there's nothing wrong with using sources such as these to get a
&gt; broad range of viewpoints--but reading his list of sources makes you
&gt; realize that the author did not even try to get more than one
&gt; perspective--hence, it is not just the layout that is a comic book,
&gt; but also

&gt; Addicted To Deception: What Passes For History These Days

&gt; I ran into a most peculiar book the other day--a comic book
&gt; presentation of American foreign policy, titled, Addicted to War: Why
&gt; The U.S. Can't Kick Militarism. What worries me is that a piece of
&gt; inaccurate and deceptive trash like this has been adopted by the San
&gt; Francisco Board of Education. As I've mentioned in the past:
">

&quot;I own Raytheon stock, and it's the only thing funding my retirement.&quot;

Fucking clowns. If the book didn't hit the nail on the head, there
wouldn't be buisiness school morons whining about it.

Are you aware of U.S. policies and actions in East
Asia prior to Pearl Harbor?  Pearl Harbor didn't come
out of nowhere.  At the time, Britain and the U.S. had
imposed an embargo on oil going to the Japanese.
This was because they disagreed about the Japanese
taking over Indochina -- they (the governments, that is)
were somewhat selective about who had the right to
practice imperialism in Indochina (France, okay,
Japan, not okay).  Since modern empires require oil
for their military operations, the embargo was pretty
much an act of war and the Japanese had to either
fight or surrender.  It is not surprising that they chose
to fight.

So what do you suppose the interest of Britain and
the U.S. was in Indochina?  It wasn't resisting
imperialism and colonialism -- they were all right
about the French doing it.

Now, as to the threat posed by Hitler: here, you
need to look into the games played by and around
Hitler and the Nazis during the 1930s.  Before
World War II, HItler was quite popular with a lot
of important people at one time or another.
Needless to say, all this has been soft-pedaled
in post-war histories, but the facts are there and
they are quite enlightening.
