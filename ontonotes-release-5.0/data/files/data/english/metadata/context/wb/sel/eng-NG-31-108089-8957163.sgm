Hey, it's gotta be lunch time somewhere, so a round on me and have some
of these brats I just finished cooking on the grill out back. Don't
worry, I cleaned it with a bleach solution first. &lt;g&gt;

I dunno if this was a re-run, but AMW was in Sturgis. I watched it
because I thought they were going to go after bike thieves. Turns out it
was all about getting 1%ers. They'd pull patch holders over and even if
they didn't have any warrants or anything or hadn't done anything wrong,
they took their photos and got all their information for a database.
What the hell? Is this legal? They had two guys (I believe not wearing
patches--I may be wrong) who had guns and **shudder** knives! If they
pulled over every person in Sturgis who had a gun or a knife, they'd
have traffic backed up to New York City. Yeesh.

Maybe this has all been discussed before if this was a rerun (I don't
normally watch this show), but I thought it was bullshit with the
pictures and info taking. If I'm way off base, please enlighten me.

It's called profilin darlin. It's a PC fancy-schmancy word fer harrassment.

There's plentya LEOs that don't judge the book by the cover, but also a

WA State ABATE an others're tryin to pass a law against profilin, butt it's

Some LE orgs train to spotlight anything witha patch, an try to finda excuse

I believe they were feds, but don't quote me. The AMW people (who aren't
LEOs) were interested in it because there were some patch holders on
their &quot;most wanted&quot; list. I guess they think that that warrants
wholesale harassment of anybody that's on two wheels and sporting a patch.

I dunno if it was a rerun and I don't watch it either, but unless they were

other years.

My take is, outa every 100 folks, there're gonna be 10 ya don't care to

Dunno where yer at, butt in WA, there're localities that actually passed

I believe that was in California.

&gt;&gt; Maybe in the 50's-60's.  You may be right to a certain extent but I find
&gt;&gt; that hard to believe that attitude prevails as a whole anymore in this
&gt;&gt; predominately anything goes society.  Ya know; bad is good, good is bad
&gt;&gt; etc, etc..

&gt; Dunno where yer at, butt in WA, there're localities that actually passed
&gt; laws that makeit unlawful to have the same shirt/patch/vest or whatever in
&gt; groupsa 3 or more. Sunnyside, Yakima, Mabton...
">

Naw, 'round here the gendarme is too busy chasin' the numerous
latino/asian/black gangs and their murder sprees around most of the time.

They'd probably welcome patch holders as a breather...  I damn sure would!

However they do keep some pressure on the moto clubs.  There are very
specific req's for clubs here when it comes to location, buildings, etc.
They've just about 86'ed most of 'em through that process.

one of the local m/c's had someone do a litle stealing from thier garage.
they decided to let the man do his job and called the cops.  when the cops
got there to write it up they asked the m/c's why they were called and said
that bikers were supposed to handle their own problems.  after a five minute
conversation, the cops left without filling out a report and the club
handled the thief themselves.

I'm actually drawing a blank on the varieties we've had, but I do
remember them experimenting with different types of beer--yummy!
