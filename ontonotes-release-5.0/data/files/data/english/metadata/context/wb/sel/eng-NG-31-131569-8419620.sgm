The coin I fashioned came from drinking Mexican Tequila coupled with
Gold Scholdger's until one day I pooped out a Mexican coin.  Now there
are ways of working on your coins.. at least over 2 million ways.  For
instance, I took books to task and put mental note over the breakthrus
from which I used picking tools to chisel it according my own design.
But some other fucker, examined my coin and how it looked but moreso
how it could fit into a coinslot for technology.  He studied the coin
until he mastered the coin and a coin popped into the peripheries of
his head.  So men try to make coins that others cannot get..  And they
protect these coins with dear life.  Until a man with a bat, who lies
in an usual circumstance where you don't expect it smashes your skull
in making the most expensive coins, particularly Japanese yen spew out
all over the place where the victim looks for his coins to retrieve
them but they roll into secret holes and sewerholes..the coins were so
expensive that he feels a phantom pain in the form of the coin which
is his nerve.. he tries to wrap his wires around it, but sometimes it
just slips.. a man grabs a head and smashes it against the floor
making coins spew on the floor.. he walks out..
