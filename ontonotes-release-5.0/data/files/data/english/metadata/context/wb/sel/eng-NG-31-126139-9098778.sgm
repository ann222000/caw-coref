An interesting article on Yes, I found on the Internet. This makes a
big for Yes being one of the greatest rock band of all time.
Unfortunately, they are not yet in Rock N Roll HOF and didnt even make
the top 100 VH1 rock n roll list.

Yes are a rock band with a strange and interesting history. Back in
the 1970s, they were among the most popular, best-loved and biggest-
selling bands on the planet. In 1976, they packed out the JFK stadium
with over 110,000 enthusiastic fans, just about the largest concert
attendance ever at that time.

Today they enjoy only limited media exposure; you will seldom hear
them on radio or see them discussed by critics and few under-20s will
now even have heard of them. And yet, many teenagers of 2003 are found
to be open and willing to listen to this band. Given the opportunity,
they hear the music with fresh ears and are amazed at it; indeed they
are frequently incredulous at Yes's lack of presence on the music
scene.

So what accounts for today's lack of market profile?

First, they have never been mainstream pop or dance - nor are they a
'singles' band. This is album music to be listened to and enjoyed for
its own sake. And like all good music, it needs more than one hearing
to be fully appreciated. Those who give it time will be richly
rewarded.

Also, they are not natural 'celebrities'. These are professional
musicians first and seldom attract publicity for their own actions.
They are not 'hotel wreckers'.

A brief fall in their fortunes, back in the late 1970s, was due to the
advent of punk, with its emphasis on simple, direct music and blunt
aggression. The music press naturally jumped on the bandwagon and
anything that didn't fit in with the New Wave was peremptorily
'dropped' overnight. The trend then was towards three-chord songs,
with keyboards used less often. At that time Yes were probably the
best-known exponents of more involved and interesting musical forms.
Some of their output certainly approaches classical music in grandeur,
scale, invention and sheer musical ability. Their lyrics are positive,
poetic, full of hope. In contrast, the punk movement embraced street
language, anger and often a sense of despair.

This hurdle overcome, they later rose to the top again, briefly, with
their massive 90125 album and the single 'Owner of a Lonely Heart'.
Unfortunately, subsequent line-up changes and managerial difficulties
resulted in a couple of weaker albums and, again, a loss of market
profile.

These days it is difficult to say how popular Yes are, without access
to their global sales figures. There is certainly a massive global
following. At the time of writing, Yes are still together, still
working hard and playing to packed houses around the world; their fans
are loyal. The latest albums The Ladder and Magnification (2001) are
real quality, full of vibrant, fresh material.

A Brief History

The band formed around 1968, with the meeting of Jon Anderson (vocals)
and Chris Squire (bass). The first line-up included Peter Banks
(guitar), Tony Kaye (keyboard) and Bill Bruford (drums).

The first two albums were Yes and Time and a Word. These are
interesting collectors items for the established fan, but are
certainly products of their era and sound a little dated now. Later
albums have a timeless quality.

Two significant changes then occurred: firstly, the arrival of a new
producer, Eddie Offord. He was to remain with the band for several
years and would bring great continuity and invention to their sound.
The second change was the departure of Banks and arrival of Steve Howe
on guitar. Howe was to become the most widely respected rock guitarist
of his time. Unlike other contenders, such as Jimmy Page of Led
Zeppelin, Howe was happy to move outside blues and rock scales into
classical and jazz modes.

The 'Classic' Period

There was a certain amount of record company pressure for the next
album to be successful; it was make-or-break time for the band. The
Yes Album turned out to be a masterpiece - the breakthrough had come.
It contained six tracks, five of which are still played regularly on
tours, and it became almost a one-record greatest hits collection.

Keyboards on the next album, Fragile, were taken over by Rick Wakeman.
Quite apart from his general flamboyance (and golden cape) he brought
even more musicality to the band, with his classical training and rock
experience. He was a pioneer of synthesizer technology, always at the
forefront of developments1. To achieve the sounds he wanted, he would
tour with banks of keyboards that he played simultaneously. He also
brought his own playful sense of humour to the shows.

Jon Anderson has always been a dynamic and strong leader for the group
in terms of musical direction. Lyrically, he began to explore more
mystical and spiritual themes, creating word-pictures with sometimes
profound imagery: a new language that he brought to a huge public. Yes
were extremely popular at this time - their concerts invariably sold
out.

The fifth album, Close to the Edge, was a truly massive hit worldwide.
It established the group as leaders in their art, with an inspired
title track. This was 18 minutes long, a fact in itself challenging
for many who wanted to categorise Yes as a pop/rock group. It featured
four sections, the first a wonderfully crafted rock/jazz intro,
leading into powerful melodies, a beautifully harmonised third 'slow'
movement and a final climactic return to the 'Close to the Edge'
theme, with truly spine-tingling effect.

All this was guaranteed to win many, many fans, but also baffle others
who were more addicted to the three-minute pop song and the epidemic
of soul/disco sweeping the world at that time.

Bill Bruford was replaced by Alan White, a former drummer for John
Lennon, bringing a more rocky, less jazzy approach to the instrument.

Tales from Topographic Oceans was the sixth album, a double, and it
went to No 1 in the album charts despite marketing and release
difficulties. This was probably their most challenging album: four
pieces in excess of 20 minute each, featuring various musical styles.
By now though, the band had their own distinctive sound and this was
unlike anything else on the market. It alienated some critics, who
considered it a step too far outside their strict categories of 'rock
'n' roll', disco, etc. With hindsight, the band were steering their
own course and it was brave and original. Those who gave the album a
fair hearing are generally still passionate about it to this day, but
it needed listening to, just as a Sibelius symphony does: it makes
demands of the listener, but the reward is great.

Album number seven was Relayer. This was what many consider to be
their greatest-ever recording. It beautifully tackles the great themes
of war, peace, love and hate. Again, like much that is profound, it
needs more than one listening to appreciate its genius. Patrick Moraz
replaced Wakeman on keyboards for this one album and brought a fast
playing jazz-fusion feel to the overall rock sound. Yes were riding
high and it was 1976, the year of their great stadium concerts.

The Punk Era

The 'New Wave' hit hard in 1977, but the next album, the superb Going
for the One, flew in the face of the movement and confounded the
critics. It reached No 1 in the album charts. However, Yes had
officially become the 'Old Wave' and the music press began
systematically to write them off; or rather not write about them at
all. The tragedy of this was not that it badly affected the band, but
that future audiences were denied even the opportunity to hear about
Yes, other than by word of mouth.

The band were shaken and probably hurt by the wave of criticism, and
the ninth album, Tormato, sounded musically changed, unsure of itself.
The final mixdown sounded surprisingly hurried and even the album
sleeve betrayed a lack of self-belief within the band, the planned
cover-photo splattered in tomatoes. Be that as it may, the record
still contained some great ideas and was followed by a hugely
successful and innovative tour 'in the round' ie, on a revolving
stage.

Dramatics

At some point during this 1978 tour, Anderson and Wakeman decided to
call it a day. Things were just not gelling within the band.
Controversially, they were replaced by former Buggles members, Trevor
Horn (vocals) and Geoff Downes (keyboards). This appeared strange at
the time, as Buggles had presented a distinctly 'pop' sound - it
seemed that neither Yes fans nor Buggles fans were happy with the new
plans.

However, the next album, Drama, put paid to many of their fears. This
was tight, clever music. The keyboards were solidly played, without a
foreground presence, but certainly held their own. The vocals were
performed satisfactorily and suited the songs. However, it was a
different sound, and the loss of Anderson meant the loss of some
ethereal, enigmatic quality - spirituality, if you will. It was the
difference between a mountain-top experience, and simply a hike over a
mountain. Oddly enough though, these feelings perfectly suited the
material; 'Machine Messiah', for instance, seemed to speak of a
mechanistic, soulless universe. Drama remains a popular album because
the band were true to themselves, and the material has freshness after
the change in personnel.

The subsequent tour was successful but proved difficult for Trevor
Horn, as his voice was severely challenged by the older material.
After the tour, the band split; apparently Yes had finished.

Wakeman undertook various solo projects, Howe formed Asia and Trevor
Horn now settled into his future successful role as producer. Jon
Anderson meanwhile, teamed up with Greek synthesizer wizard, Vangelis,
and enjoyed great success (and hit singles) as Jon and Vangelis.

Squire, White, former keyboard man Tony Kaye, and South African
guitarist Trevor Rabin teamed up to form a proposed new band, Cinema.
However, with much of an album already recorded, Jon

I always figured the reason why Yes gets such limited commercial
exposure is because they are so terrible. I've always assumed that Prog
Rock was some horrible mutation caused by a combination of post
traumatic Sgt Pepper listening and bad drugs. There's something so
pompously unmusical, to my ears, about this kind of music.

However, ever since I saw the Yes box set, I've had to realize that a
lot of people like this kind of music. I suppose the latest Genesis
revival has people excited too.

I've tried to study and understand the phenomenon of Prog and now
realize that a lot of that early psychedelic music, like Jethro Tull and
Procol Harem, have elements of prog. Recently watching Arthur Lee's
performance on the Later DVD, I've been wondering if Love was a bit
proggy. In other words, I am trying to nurture my inner prog, to see if
I can understand this music better.

What would be the most accessible Yes song for me to start on. But be
warned, I like short snappy music with a catchy melody. One of my
greatest pleasures is the art of the popular song that treads the line
between schlock and genius.

Try an album - Fragile! It has several short songs mixed with longer
songs. Or you could try their selt titled debut. But that is a

Both are equally good in my opinion. But their best albums are Close

&gt; Album number seven was Relayer. This was what many consider to be

&gt; replaced Wakeman on keyboards for this one album and brought a fast
&gt; playing jazz-fusion feel to the overall rock sound. Yes were riding

&gt; The Punk Era

&gt; The 'New Wave' hit hard in 1977, but the next album, the superb Going

&gt; all. The tragedy of this was not that it badly affected the band, but
&gt; that future audiences were denied even the opportunity to hear about
&gt; Yes, other than by word of mouth.

&gt; The band were shaken and probably hurt by the wave of criticism, and

&gt; successful and innovative tour 'in the round' ie, on a revolving
&gt; stage.

&gt; Dramatics

&gt; At some point during this 1978 tour, Anderson and Wakeman decided to
&gt; call it a day. Things were just not gelling within the band.
&gt; Controversially, they were replaced by former Buggles members, Trevor
&gt; Horn (vocals) and Geoff Downes (keyboards). This appeared strange at
&gt; the time, as Buggles had presented a distinctly 'pop' sound - it
&gt; seemed that neither Yes fans nor Buggles fans were happy with the new
&gt; plans.

&gt; However, the next album, Drama, put paid to many of their fears. This
&gt; was tight, clever music. The keyboards were solidly played, without a
&gt; foreground presence, but certainly held their own. The vocals were
&gt; performed satisfactorily and suited the songs. However, it was a
&gt; different sound, and the loss of Anderson meant the loss of some
&gt; ethereal, enigmatic quality - spirituality, if you will. It was the
&gt; difference between a mountain-top experience, and simply a hike over a
&gt; mountain. Oddly enough though, these feelings perfectly suited the
&gt; material; 'Machine Messiah', for instance, seemed to speak of a
&gt; mechanistic, soulless universe. Drama remains a popular album because
&gt; the band were true to themselves, and the material has freshness after
&gt; the change in personnel.

&gt; Horn, as his voice was severely challenged by the older material.

&gt; An interesting article on Yes, I found on the Internet. This makes a
&gt; big for Yes being one of the greatest rock band of all time.
&gt; Unfortunately, they are not yet in Rock N Roll HOF and didnt even make
&gt; the top 100 VH1 rock n roll list.

&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A959952

&gt; Yes are a rock band with a strange and interesting history. Back in
&gt; the 1970s, they were among the most popular, best-loved and biggest-
&gt; selling bands on the planet. In 1976, they packed out the JFK stadium
&gt; with over 110,000 enthusiastic fans, just about the largest concert
&gt; attendance ever at that time.

&gt; Today they enjoy only limited media exposure; you will seldom hear
&gt; them on radio or see them discussed by critics and few under-20s will
&gt; now even have heard of them. And yet, many teenagers of 2003 are found
&gt; to be open and willing to listen to this band. Given the opportunity,
&gt; they hear the music with fresh ears and are amazed at it; indeed they
&gt; are frequently incredulous at Yes's lack of presence on the music
&gt; scene.

&gt; So what accounts for today's lack of market profile?

&gt; First, they have never been mainstream pop or dance - nor are they a
&gt; 'singles' band. This is album music to be listened to and enjoyed for
&gt; its own sake. And like all good music, it needs more than one hearing
&gt; to be fully appreciated. Those who give it time will be richly
&gt; rewarded.

&gt; Also, they are not natural 'celebrities'. These are professional
&gt; musicians first and seldom attract publicity for their own actions.
&gt; They are not 'hotel wreckers'.

&gt; A brief fall in their fortunes, back in the late 1970s, was due to the
&gt; advent of punk, with its emphasis on simple, direct music and blunt
&gt; aggression. The music press naturally jumped on the bandwagon and
&gt; anything that didn't fit in with the New Wave was peremptorily
&gt; 'dropped' overnight. The trend then was towards three-chord songs,
&gt; with keyboards used less often. At that time Yes were probably the
&gt; best-known exponents of more involved and interesting musical forms.
&gt; Some of their output certainly approaches classical music in grandeur,
&gt; scale, invention and sheer musical ability. Their lyrics are positive,
&gt; poetic, full of hope. In contrast, the punk movement embraced street
&gt; language, anger and often a sense of despair.

&gt; This hurdle overcome, they later rose to the top again, briefly, with
&gt; their massive 90125 album and the single 'Owner of a Lonely Heart'.
&gt; Unfortunately, subsequent line-up changes and managerial difficulties
&gt; resulted in a couple of weaker albums and, again, a loss of market
&gt; profile.

&gt; These days it is difficult to say how popular Yes are, without access
&gt; to their global sales figures. There is certainly a massive global
&gt; following. At the time of writing, Yes are still together, still
&gt; working hard and playing to packed houses around the world; their fans
&gt; are loyal. The latest albums The Ladder and Magnification (2001) are
&gt; real quality, full of vibrant, fresh material.

&gt; A Brief History

&gt; The band formed around 1968, with the meeting of Jon Anderson (vocals)
&gt; and Chris Squire (bass). The first line-up included Peter Banks
&gt; (guitar), Tony Kaye (keyboard) and Bill Bruford (drums).

&gt; The first two albums were Yes and Time and a Word. These are
&gt; interesting collectors items for the established fan, but are
&gt; certainly products of their era and sound a little dated now. Later
&gt; albums have a timeless quality.

&gt; Two significant changes then occurred: firstly, the arrival of a new
&gt; producer, Eddie Offord. He was to remain with the band for several
&gt; years and would bring great continuity and invention to their sound.
&gt; The second change was the departure of Banks and arrival of Steve Howe
&gt; on guitar. Howe was to become the most widely respected rock guitarist
&gt; of his time. Unlike other contenders, such as Jimmy Page of Led
&gt; Zeppelin, Howe was happy to move outside blues and rock scales into
&gt; classical and jazz modes.

&gt; The 'Classic' Period

&gt; There was a certain amount of record company pressure for the next
&gt; album to be successful; it was make-or-break time for the band. The
&gt; Yes Album turned out to be a masterpiece - the breakthrough had come.
&gt; It contained six tracks, five of which are still played regularly on
&gt; tours, and it became almost a one-record greatest hits collection.

&gt; Keyboards on the next album, Fragile, were taken over by Rick Wakeman.
&gt; Quite apart from his general flamboyance (and golden cape) he brought
&gt; even more musicality to the band, with his classical training and rock
&gt; experience. He was a pioneer of synthesizer technology, always at the
&gt; forefront of developments1. To achieve the sounds he wanted, he would
&gt; tour with banks of keyboards that he played simultaneously. He also
&gt; brought his own playful sense of humour to the shows.

&gt; Jon Anderson has always been a dynamic and strong leader for the group
&gt; in terms of musical direction. Lyrically, he began to explore more
&gt; mystical and spiritual themes, creating word-pictures with sometimes
&gt; profound imagery: a new language that he brought to a huge public. Yes
&gt; were extremely popular at this time - their concerts invariably sold
&gt; out.

&gt; The fifth album, Close to the Edge, was a truly massive hit worldwide.
&gt; It established the group as leaders in their art, with an inspired
&gt; title track. This was 18 minutes long, a fact in itself challenging
&gt; for many who wanted to categorise Yes as a pop/rock group. It featured
&gt; four sections, the first a wonderfully crafted rock/jazz intro,
&gt; leading into powerful melodies, a beautifully harmonised third 'slow'
&gt; movement and a final climactic return to the 'Close to the Edge'
&gt; theme, with truly spine-tingling effect.

&gt; All this was guaranteed to win many, many fans, but also baffle others
&gt; who were more addicted to the three-minute pop song and the epidemic
&gt; of soul/disco sweeping the world at that time.

&gt; Bill Bruford was replaced by Alan White, a former drummer for John
&gt; Lennon, bringing a more rocky, less jazzy approach to the instrument.

&gt; Tales from Topographic Oceans was the sixth album, a double, and it
&gt; went to No 1 in the album charts despite marketing and release
&gt; difficulties. This was probably their most challenging album: four
&gt; pieces in excess of 20 minute each, featuring various musical styles.
&gt; By now though, the band had their own distinctive sound and this was
&gt; unlike anything else on the market. It alienated some critics, who
&gt; considered it a step too far outside their strict categories of 'rock
&gt; 'n' roll', disco, etc. With hindsight, the band were steering their
&gt; own course and it was brave and original. Those who gave the album a
&gt; fair hearing are generally still passionate about it to this day, but
&gt; it needed listening to, just as a Sibelius symphony does: it makes
&gt; demands of the listener, but the reward is great.

&gt; Album number seven was Relayer. This was what many consider to be
&gt; their greatest-ever recording. It beautifully tackles the great themes
&gt; of war, peace, love and hate. Again, like much that is profound, it
&gt; needs more than one listening to appreciate its genius. Patrick Moraz
&gt; replaced Wakeman on keyboards for this one album and brought a fast
&gt; playing jazz-fusion feel to the overall rock sound. Yes were riding
&gt; high and it was 1976, the year of their great stadium concerts.

&gt; The Punk Era

&gt; The 'New Wave' hit hard in 1977, but the next album, the superb Going
&gt; for the One, flew in the face of the movement and confounded the
&gt; critics. It reached No 1 in the album charts. However, Yes had
&gt; officially become the 'Old Wave' and the music press began
&gt; systematically to write them off; or rather not write about them at
&gt; all. The tragedy of this was not that it badly affected the band, but
&gt; that future audiences were denied even the opportunity to hear about
&gt; Yes, other than by word of mouth.

&gt; The band were shaken and probably hurt by the wave of criticism, and
&gt; the ninth album, Tormato, sounded musically changed, unsure of itself.
&gt; The final mixdown sounded surprisingly hurried and even the album
&gt; sleeve betrayed a lack of self-belief within the band, the planned
&gt; cover-photo splattered in tomatoes. Be that as it may, the record
&gt; still contained some great ideas and was followed by a hugely
&gt; successful and innovative tour 'in the round' ie, on a revolving
&gt; stage.

&gt; Dramatics

&gt; At some point during this 1978 tour, Anderson and Wakeman decided to

It's funny that the two drummer were known for there jazz approaches
to the instrument while adding wit and nuance to their playing as well
as polyrhythms. Bruford left a legacy while White filled his shoes.

Right. Raja, I have a teenage son who has teenage friends and owns a
teenager's iPod stuffed with rock (not music on the radio). I have a
niece and nephew who just left their teens. Where is Yes with these
listeners? Nowhere. My nephew is actually a big fan of classic rock
and spends a lot of time learning the guitar riffs -- but that means
Led Zep, AC/DC, Clapton, Hendrix, etc., not Yes. Your article actually

Your nephew learning to play guitar riffs is the problem.  Led Zep , AC/DC
is easy guitar. He dosent have a prayer of figuring out Steve Howe riffs and
lacks the physical ability to do so.  Hence his bordom/frustration with Yes.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes is a big hit with teenagers these days. The ones that are willing
&gt; &gt;&gt; to discover new music not played on radio. There is a reason all the
&gt; &gt;&gt; current rock bands are all retro.

&gt; &gt; Right. Raja, I have a teenage son who has teenage friends and owns a
&gt; &gt; teenager's iPod stuffed with rock (not music on the radio). I have a
&gt; &gt; niece and nephew who just left their teens. Where is Yes with these
&gt; &gt; listeners? Nowhere. My nephew is actually a big fan of classic rock
&gt; &gt; and spends a lot of time learning the guitar riffs -- but that means
&gt; &gt; Led Zep, AC/DC, Clapton, Hendrix, etc., not Yes. Your article actually
&gt; &gt; managed to get something right when it said, &quot;few under-20s will now
&gt; &gt; even have heard of them.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Joe Ramirez

&gt; Your nephew learning to play guitar riffs is the problem.  Led Zep , AC/DC
&gt; is easy guitar. He dosent have a prayer of figuring out Steve Howe riffs and
&gt; lacks the physical ability to do so.

Because you know him so well, right? LOL.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You can't be bored or frustrated with something you don't seek out and
don't care about. I really hope that the self-esteem of Yes fans does
not depend on what today's teenagers think about the band (obviously,
they don't think about it at all), but after reading Raja's posts and
yours, I'm not so sure.

Ask him to download Close to the Edge and Relayer. I bet he will get
hooked on soon after a few listens. He might have not heard of prog
rock much. Many teens start with classic rock and move on to prog
rock. If he likes the 70s, there is hope for him.

I do agree Yes popularity went down in the 90s, but with the Internets
(as Bush would put it), prog rock and Yes' popularity have gone up
among the new listeners.

Your teenage niece/nephews will eventually seek out more music from
the 70s and then they will DISCOVER Yes. It happened to me too. For
many years Pink Floyd, Zep and Rush was my top 1-3 bands. When I
started reading abt genres, I discovered Floyd and Rush get frequently
classified as prog rock. When I went to seek out the &quot;other inferior&quot;
bands in the genre, I disovered Yes and also discovered Yes was way
better and original than Rush and also as good as Floyd if not better
than them. Nowadays I would rate Zep&gt;Yes&gt;Floyd, although the gap
between the three is very less.

Joe, no offense let me ask you one thing? What do you find exciting
about Radiohead that you dont find about Floyd/Yes?

Are you trying to be hip by saying Radiohead is cool? You call Floyd
lacking energy. I was listening to OK Computer today and it was such a
snooze. I have never heard a rock band rock this less! Then I put on
Kid A. I must say they did a great job of RIPPING OFF Kraftwerk's
album Radio-Activity. I personally prefer Kid A to Ok Computer,
because it has at least some more energy.

You call excellent live bands who could rock as much as any like Floyd/
Yes,  effete/banal. But then you like snoozefests like Radohead. I see
a bit of hypocrisy in there. Do you like Radiohead because they call
themselves alternative rock (which is a cooler term than progressive
rock).... BWHAHAHAHA! By the way alternative rock is a shit term which
means nothing.

I would say The Verve were much better, rocked harder, and wrote much
more memorable stuff than Radiohead ever have. And they both made
music at the same time. Its just some snobs made a huge deal out of
Radiohead while ignoring better bands like The Verve.

Listen to me....

Radiohead is much more SELF INDULGENT and PRETENTIOUS than Floyd/Yes
ever were. At least they made music to entertain people while trying
some experimentation.

Your &quot;discovery&quot; hypothesis is more plausible than your parental/
avuncular influence hypothesis. Kids want to find their music on their
own, whatever era it is from. Whatever influence I have has been
exerted -- mostly ineffectively -- to promote music I personally find
important. However, I think I did once play some Yes for my son (I
rarely listen to it, but he happened to be in the car on that
occasion) -- he hated it. But if it's any consolation, he also
dislikes a lot of the rock I like the most, and he hates classical
too, despite my best efforts.

&gt; Joe, no offense let me ask you one thing? What do you find exciting

">

I didn't bring up Radiohead in this thread, so I'm not sure why you
are addressing that band. Also, note that I have never in my life
started any kind of thread about Pink Floyd or Yes. But if you persist
in cross-posting your hagiographic musings on these groups, you have
to expect resistance.

Pink Floyd and Yes have essentially opposite problems. Pink Floyd has
brains, but no energy. That's why they are effete. Yes has some
energy, but no brains. That's why they are banal. Neither is
worthless, although I do not much care for either. If I had to choose
one to listen to, it would be Floyd because it at least can make good
background music.

Radiohead has both energy and brains. The music is intelligent,
diverse, melodic, provocative, lyrically interesting, and very sad at
times.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Are you trying to be hip by saying Radiohead is cool?
">

Don't be silly. I have broad taste in music (classical, jazz,
bluegrass, all sorts of rock, ethnic &amp; folk musics, etc.) and seek out
good stuff regardless of its public image. My tastes in rock have been
&quot;hip&quot; for decades only because music that is really good sometimes
does wind up getting acclaimed as such.

I have noticed that Radiohead is a band that musicians tend to like.
In that respect you are probably correct in part that they are aiming
for something beyond simply entertaining the public.

Radiohead can rock very hard when they want to. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and
&quot;Electioneering&quot; on &quot;OK Computer,&quot; most of &quot;The Bends,&quot; much of &quot;Hail
to the Thief,&quot; parts of &quot;Kid A,&quot; etc. You are correct that much of &quot;OK
Computer&quot; is slow, but it's also extremely, ingeniously melodic.
&quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien,&quot; for example, is an absolutely beautiful
track. The key difference between Floyd and Radiohead is that
Radiohead's experimental, non-rocking tracks are well-arranged,
interestingly textured, and highly melodic. Floyd's similar tracks may
also be well-arranged and interestingly textured, but they are quite
parched, melodically speaking.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You have the perspective of someone who is entranced by labels. Why
would I care about a manufactured subgenre name? I was listening to
music in the &quot;alternative&quot; evolutionary tree before the term
&quot;alternative rock&quot; was invented, so the name can't influence me one
way or the other.

As a prisoner of the 70s, you have previously established that your
taste becomes less reliable the further you get from that decade. The
Verve?? Pleasant enough, but essentially a footnote band.

Anyway, to return this thread to its original topic, the fact that you
don't like Radiohead obviously does not help to prove that today's
teenagers are becoming Yes fans. :)

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; now even have heard of them. And yet, many teenagers of 2003 are

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Laughable. And what is the basis for all these breathless

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes is a big hit with teenagers these days. The ones that are willing
&gt;&gt;&gt; to discover new music not played on radio. There is a reason all the
&gt;&gt;&gt; current rock bands are all retro.

&gt;&gt; Right. Raja, I have a teenage son who has teenage friends and owns a
&gt;&gt; teenager's iPod stuffed with rock (not music on the radio). I have a
&gt;&gt; niece and nephew who just left their teens. Where is Yes with these
&gt;&gt; listeners? Nowhere. My nephew is actually a big fan of classic rock
&gt;&gt; and spends a lot of time learning the guitar riffs -- but that means
&gt;&gt; Led Zep, AC/DC, Clapton, Hendrix, etc., not Yes. Your article actually
&gt;&gt; managed to get something right when it said, &quot;few under-20s will now
&gt;&gt; even have heard of them.&quot;

&gt;&gt; Joe Ramirez

&gt; Your nephew learning to play guitar riffs is the problem.  Led Zep , AC/DC
&gt; is easy guitar. He dosent have a prayer of figuring out Steve Howe riffs and
&gt; lacks the physical ability to do so.  Hence his bordom/frustration with Yes.

If the guy's nephew could learn to play like Angus Young or Jimmy Page, the
fact that he has never heard of Yes would not hurt his music career in the
least.

&gt; Your teenage niece/nephews will eventually seek out more music from
&gt; the 70s and then they will DISCOVER Yes. It happened to me too. For
&gt; many years Pink Floyd, Zep and Rush was my top 1-3 bands. When I
&gt; started reading abt genres, I discovered Floyd and Rush get frequently
&gt; classified as prog rock. When I went to seek out the &quot;other inferior&quot;
&gt; bands in the genre, I disovered Yes and also discovered Yes was way
&gt; better and original than Rush and also as good as Floyd if not better
&gt; than them. Nowadays I would rate Zep&gt;Yes&gt;Floyd, although the gap
&gt; between the three is very less.

And again, if he can learn how to play guitar as well as Lifeson or Gilmour,
the fact that he's never heard of Yes won't hurt him a bit.

They were an interesting band with some good music, but Floyd they were not.

Wearing a band t-shirt never had any status.  They could always be

is like 2 leagues below them. So your statement is wrong.

&gt; &gt; Joe, no offense let me ask you one thing? What do you find exciting
&gt; &gt; about Radiohead that you dont find about Floyd/Yes?

&gt; I didn't bring up Radiohead in this thread, so I'm not sure why you
&gt; are addressing that band. Also, note that I have never in my life
&gt; started any kind of thread about Pink Floyd or Yes. But if you persist
&gt; in cross-posting your hagiographic musings on these groups, you have
&gt; to expect resistance.

&gt; Pink Floyd and Yes have essentially opposite problems. Pink Floyd has
&gt; brains, but no energy. That's why they are effete. Yes has some
&gt; energy, but no brains. That's why they are banal. Neither is
&gt; worthless, although I do not much care for either. If I had to choose
&gt; one to listen to, it would be Floyd because it at least can make good
&gt; background music.
">

Yes' music is very intelligent and so is Floyd. I dont think there is
any use to talking to you, since you havent heard these bands at all.
You seem to be a dude who listens/judges music based on the image it
has. So Yes/Floyd are classified as prog they must not make very
intelligent music? LOL

&gt;The music is intelligent,
&gt; diverse, melodic, provocative, lyrically interesting, and very sad at
&gt; times.

&gt; &gt; Are you trying to be hip by saying Radiohead is cool?

&gt; Don't be silly. I have broad taste in music (classical, jazz,
&gt; bluegrass, all sorts of rock, ethnic &amp; folk musics, etc.) and seek out
&gt; good stuff regardless of its public image. My tastes in rock have been
&gt; &quot;hip&quot; for decades only because music that is really good sometimes
&gt; does wind up getting acclaimed as such.

&gt; I have noticed that Radiohead is a band that musicians tend to like.
&gt; In that respect you are probably correct in part that they are aiming
&gt; for something beyond simply entertaining the public.

&gt; &gt; You call Floyd
&gt; &gt; lacking energy. I was listening to OK Computer today and it was such a
&gt; &gt; snooze. I have never heard a rock band rock this less! Then I put on
&gt; &gt; Kid A. I must say they did a great job of RIPPING OFF Kraftwerk's
&gt; &gt; album Radio-Activity. I personally prefer Kid A to Ok Computer,
&gt; &gt; because it has at least some more energy.

&gt; Radiohead can rock very hard when they want to. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and
&gt; &quot;Electioneering&quot; on &quot;OK Computer,&quot; most of &quot;The Bends,&quot; much of &quot;Hail
&gt; to the Thief,&quot; parts of &quot;Kid A,&quot; etc. You are correct that much of &quot;OK
&gt; Computer&quot; is slow, but it's also extremely, ingeniously melodic.
&gt; &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien,&quot; for example, is an absolutely beautiful
&gt; track. The key difference between Floyd and Radiohead is that
&gt; Radiohead's experimental, non-rocking tracks are well-arranged,
&gt; interestingly textured, and highly melodic. Floyd's similar tracks may
&gt; also be well-arranged and interestingly textured, but they are quite
&gt; parched, melodically speaking.

&gt; &gt; You call excellent live bands who could rock as much as any like Floyd/
&gt; &gt; Yes,  effete/banal. But then you like snoozefests like Radohead. I see
&gt; &gt; a bit of hypocrisy in there. Do you like Radiohead because they call
&gt; &gt; themselves alternative rock (which is a cooler term than progressive
&gt; &gt; rock).... BWHAHAHAHA! By the way alternative rock is a shit term which
&gt; &gt; means nothing.

&gt; You have the perspective of someone who is entranced by labels. Why
&gt; would I care about a manufactured subgenre name? I was listening to
&gt; music in the &quot;alternative&quot; evolutionary tree before the term
&gt; &quot;alternative rock&quot; was invented, so the name can't influence me one
&gt; way or the other.

&gt; &gt; I would say The Verve were much better, rocked harder, and wrote much
&gt; &gt; more memorable stuff than Radiohead ever have. And they both made
&gt; &gt; music at the same time. Its just some snobs made a huge deal out of
&gt; &gt; Radiohead while ignoring better bands like The Verve.

&gt; As a prisoner of the 70s, you have previously established that your
&gt; taste becomes less reliable the further you get from that decade. The
&gt; Verve?? Pleasant enough, but essentially a footnote band.

&gt; Anyway, to return this thread to its original topic, the fact that you
&gt; don't like Radiohead obviously does not help to prove that today's
&gt; teenagers are becoming Yes fans. :)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes is a big hit with teenagers these days. The ones that are willing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to discover new music not played on radio. There is a reason all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; current rock bands are all retro.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Right. Raja, I have a teenage son who has teenage friends and owns a
&gt; &gt; &gt; teenager's iPod stuffed with rock (not music on the radio). I have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; niece and nephew who just left their teens. Where is Yes with these
&gt; &gt; &gt; listeners? Nowhere. My nephew is actually a big fan of classic rock
&gt; &gt; &gt; and spends a lot of time learning the guitar riffs -- but that means
&gt; &gt; &gt; Led Zep, AC/DC, Clapton, Hendrix, etc., not Yes. Your article actually
&gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get something right when it said, &quot;few under-20s will now
&gt; &gt; &gt; even have heard of them.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Ask him to download Close to the Edge and Relayer. I bet he will get
&gt; &gt; hooked on soon after a few listens. He might have not heard of prog
&gt; &gt; rock much. Many teens start with classic rock and move on to prog
&gt; &gt; rock. If he likes the 70s, there is hope for him.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Joe, no offense let me ask you one thing? What do you find exciting
&gt; &gt; &gt; about Radiohead that you dont find about Floyd/Yes?

&gt; &gt; I didn't bring up Radiohead in this thread, so I'm not sure why you
&gt; &gt; are addressing that band. Also, note that I have never in my life
&gt; &gt; started any kind of thread about Pink Floyd or Yes. But if you persist
&gt; &gt; in cross-posting your hagiographic musings on these groups, you have
&gt; &gt; to expect resistance.

&gt; &gt; Pink Floyd and Yes have essentially opposite problems. Pink Floyd has
&gt; &gt; brains, but no energy. That's why they are effete. Yes has some
&gt; &gt; energy, but no brains. That's why they are banal. Neither is
&gt; &gt; worthless, although I do not much care for either. If I had to choose
&gt; &gt; one to listen to, it would be Floyd because it at least can make good
&gt; &gt; background music.

&gt; Yes' music is very intelligent and so is Floyd. I dont think there is
&gt; any use to talking to you, since you havent heard these bands at all.
&gt; You seem to be a dude who listens/judges music based on the image it
&gt; has. So Yes/Floyd are classified as prog they must not make very
&gt; intelligent music? LOL
">

I hope you realize that every dumb post you add to your collection
vindicates Jaros's assessment of you. It must make you happy to be
shoring up his arguments. :) Anyway:
1. Can't you read? I did not say Pink Floyd was unintelligent. I said
they had brains. Don't mislead by using ambiguous &quot;Yes/Floyd&quot;
references.
2. I don't care how these artists are &quot;classified.&quot; I did not use the
words &quot;prog&quot; or &quot;progressive&quot; in any previous messages in this thread.
That's your own bullshit smeared across your screen, not mine.

&gt; big for Yes being one of the greatest rock band of all time.

&gt; http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A959952

&gt; Yes are a rock band with a strange and interesting history. Back in
&gt; the 1970s, they were among the most popular, best-loved and biggest-
&gt; selling bands on the planet. In 1976, they packed out the JFK stadium
&gt; with over 110,000 enthusiastic fans, just about the largest concert
&gt; attendance ever at that time.

&gt; Today they enjoy only limited media exposure; you will seldom hear
&gt; them on radio or see them discussed by critics and few under-20s will
&gt; now even have heard of them. And yet, many teenagers of 2003 are found
&gt; to be open and willing to listen to this band. Given the opportunity,
&gt; they hear the music with fresh ears and are amazed at it; indeed they
&gt; are frequently incredulous at Yes's lack of presence on the music
&gt; scene.

&gt; So what accounts for today's lack of market profile?

&gt; First, they have never been mainstream pop or dance - nor are they a
&gt; 'singles' band. This is album music to be listened to and enjoyed for
&gt; its own sake. And like all good music, it needs more than one hearing
&gt; to be fully appreciated. Those who give it time will be richly
&gt; rewarded.

&gt; Also, they are not natural 'celebrities'. These are professional
&gt; musicians first and seldom attract publicity for their own actions.
&gt; They are not 'hotel wreckers'.

&gt; A brief fall in their fortunes, back in the late 1970s, was due to the
&gt; advent of punk, with its emphasis on simple, direct music and blunt
&gt; aggression. The music press naturally jumped on the bandwagon and
&gt; anything that didn't fit in with the New Wave was peremptorily
&gt; 'dropped' overnight. The trend then was towards three-chord songs,
&gt; with keyboards used less often. At that time Yes were probably the
&gt; best-known exponents of more involved and interesting musical forms.
&gt; Some of their output certainly approaches classical music in grandeur,
&gt; scale, invention and sheer musical ability. Their lyrics are positive,
&gt; poetic, full of hope. In contrast, the punk movement embraced street
&gt; language, anger and often a sense of despair.

&gt; This hurdle overcome, they later rose to the top again, briefly, with
&gt; their massive 90125 album and the single 'Owner of a Lonely Heart'.
&gt; Unfortunately, subsequent line-up changes and managerial difficulties
&gt; resulted in a couple of weaker albums and, again, a loss of market
&gt; profile.

&gt; These days it is difficult to say how popular Yes are, without access
&gt; to their global sales figures. There is certainly a massive global
&gt; following. At the time of writing, Yes are still together, still
&gt; working hard and playing to packed houses around the world; their fans
&gt; are loyal. The latest albums The Ladder and Magnification (2001) are
&gt; real quality, full of vibrant, fresh material.

&gt; A Brief History

&gt; The band formed around 1968, with the meeting of Jon Anderson (vocals)
&gt; and Chris Squire (bass). The first line-up included Peter Banks
&gt; (guitar), Tony Kaye (keyboard) and Bill Bruford (drums).

&gt; The first two albums were Yes and Time and a Word. These are
&gt; interesting collectors items for the established fan, but are
&gt; certainly products of their era and sound a little dated now. Later
&gt; albums have a timeless quality.

&gt; Two significant changes then occurred: firstly, the arrival of a new
&gt; producer, Eddie Offord. He was to remain with the band for several
&gt; years and would bring great continuity and invention to their sound.
&gt; The second change was the departure of Banks and arrival of Steve Howe
&gt; on guitar. Howe was to become the most widely respected rock guitarist
&gt; of his time. Unlike other contenders, such as Jimmy Page of Led
&gt; Zeppelin, Howe was happy to move outside blues and rock scales into
&gt; classical and jazz modes.

&gt; The 'Classic' Period

&gt; There was a certain amount of record company pressure for the next
&gt; album to be successful; it was make-or-break time for the band. The
&gt; Yes Album turned out to be a masterpiece - the breakthrough had come.
&gt; It contained six tracks, five of which are still played regularly on
&gt; tours, and it became almost a one-record greatest hits collection.

&gt; Keyboards on the next album, Fragile, were taken over by Rick Wakeman.
&gt; Quite apart from his general flamboyance (and golden cape) he brought
&gt; even more musicality to the band, with his classical training and rock
&gt; experience. He was a pioneer of synthesizer technology, always at the
&gt; forefront of developments1. To achieve the sounds he wanted, he would
&gt; tour with banks of keyboards that he played simultaneously. He also
&gt; brought his own playful sense of humour to the shows.

&gt; Jon Anderson has always been a dynamic and strong leader for the group
&gt; in terms of musical direction. Lyrically, he began to explore more
&gt; mystical and spiritual themes, creating word-pictures with sometimes
&gt; profound imagery: a new language that he brought to a huge public. Yes
&gt; were extremely popular at this time - their concerts invariably sold
&gt; out.

&gt; The fifth album, Close to the Edge, was a truly massive hit worldwide.
&gt; It established the group as leaders in their art, with an inspired
&gt; title track. This was 18 minutes long, a fact in itself challenging
&gt; for many who wanted to categorise Yes as a pop/rock group. It featured
&gt; four sections, the first a wonderfully crafted rock/jazz intro,
&gt; leading into powerful melodies, a beautifully harmonised third 'slow'
&gt; movement and a final climactic return to the 'Close to the Edge'
&gt; theme, with truly spine-tingling effect.

&gt; All this was guaranteed to win many, many fans, but also baffle others
&gt; who were more addicted to the three-minute pop song and the epidemic
&gt; of soul/disco sweeping the world at that time.

&gt; Bill Bruford was replaced by Alan White, a former drummer for John
&gt; Lennon, bringing a more rocky, less jazzy approach to the instrument.

&gt; Tales from Topographic Oceans was the sixth album, a double, and it
&gt; went to No 1 in the album charts despite marketing and release
&gt; difficulties. This was probably their most challenging album: four
&gt; pieces in excess of 20 minute each, featuring various musical styles.
&gt; By now though, the band had their own distinctive sound and this was
&gt; unlike anything else on the market. It alienated some critics, who
&gt; considered it a step too far outside their strict categories of 'rock
&gt; 'n' roll', disco, etc. With hindsight, the band were steering their
&gt; own course and it was brave and original. Those who gave the album a
&gt; fair hearing are generally still passionate about it to this day, but
&gt; it needed listening to, just as a Sibelius symphony does: it makes
&gt; demands of the listener, but the reward is great.

&gt; Album number seven was Relayer. This was what many consider to be
&gt; their greatest-ever recording. It beautifully tackles the great themes
&gt; of war, peace, love and hate. Again, like much that is profound, it
&gt; needs more than one listening to appreciate its genius. Patrick Moraz
&gt; replaced Wakeman on keyboards for this one album and brought a fast
&gt; playing jazz-fusion feel to the overall rock sound. Yes were riding
&gt; high and it was 1976, the year of their great stadium concerts.

&gt; The Punk Era

&gt; The 'New Wave' hit hard in 1977, but the next album, the superb Going
&gt; for the One, flew in the face of the movement and confounded the
&gt; critics. It reached No 1 in the album charts. However, Yes had
&gt; officially become the 'Old Wave' and the music press began
&gt; systematically to write them off; or rather not write about them at
&gt; all. The tragedy of this was not that it badly affected the band, but
&gt; that future audiences were denied even the opportunity to hear about
&gt; Yes, other than by word of mouth.

&gt; The band were shaken and probably hurt by the wave of criticism, and
&gt; the ninth album, Tormato, sounded musically changed, unsure of itself.
&gt; The final mixdown sounded surprisingly hurried and even the album
&gt; sleeve betrayed a lack of self-belief within the band, the planned
&gt; cover-photo splattered in tomatoes. Be that as it may, the record
&gt; still contained some great ideas and was followed by a hugely
&gt; successful and innovative tour 'in the round' ie, on a revolving
&gt; stage.

&gt; Dramatics

&gt; At some point during this 1978 tour, Anderson and Wakeman decided to
&gt; call it a day. Things were just not gelling within the band.
&gt; Controversially, they were replaced by former Buggles members, Trevor
&gt; Horn (vocals) and Geoff Downes (keyboards). This appeared strange at
&gt; the time, as Buggles had presented a distinctly 'pop' sound - it
&gt; seemed that neither Yes fans nor Buggles fans were happy with the new
&gt; plans.

&gt; However, the next album, Drama, put paid to many of their fears. This
&gt; was tight, clever music. The keyboards were solidly played, without a
&gt; foreground presence, but certainly held their own. The vocals were
&gt; performed satisfactorily and suited the songs. However, it was a
&gt; different sound, and the loss of Anderson meant the loss of some
&gt; ethereal, enigmatic quality - spirituality, if you will. It was the
&gt; difference between a mountain-top experience, and simply a hike over a
&gt; mountain. Oddly enough though, these feelings perfectly suited the
&gt; material; 'Machine Messiah', for instance, seemed to speak of a
&gt; mechanistic, soulless universe. Drama remains a popular album because
&gt; the band were true to themselves, and the material has freshness after
&gt; the change in personnel.

&gt; The subsequent tour was successful but proved difficult for Trevor
&gt; Horn, as his voice was severely challenged by the older material.
&gt; After the tour, the band split; apparently Yes had finished.

&gt; Wakeman undertook various solo projects, Howe formed Asia

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes is a big hit with teenagers these days. The ones that are willing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to discover new music not played on radio. There is a reason all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; current rock bands are all retro.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right. Raja, I have a teenage son who has teenage friends and owns a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; teenager's iPod stuffed with rock (not music on the radio). I have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; niece and nephew who just left their teens. Where is Yes with these
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; listeners? Nowhere. My nephew is actually a big fan of classic rock
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and spends a lot of time learning the guitar riffs -- but that means
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Led Zep, AC/DC, Clapton, Hendrix, etc., not Yes. Your article actually
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get something right when it said, &quot;few under-20s will now
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even have heard of them.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ask him to download Close to the Edge and Relayer. I bet he will get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hooked on soon after a few listens. He might have not heard of prog
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rock much. Many teens start with classic rock and move on to prog
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rock. If he likes the 70s, there is hope for him.

&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I think I did once play some Yes for my son (I

&gt; &gt; Why would you play Yes for your son, if you never like them in the

listen you bastard. AC/DC is one of my favorite bands. Angus Young is
one of my favorite guitarists. But he is technically not as good as
Page or Howe or Hendrix. He is nor versatile or creative as Page and
Howe.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Today they enjoy only limited media exposure; you will seldom hear

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; scene.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; This paragraph is laced with ludicrously amateurish fanboy analysis.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Few&quot; teens have even heard of Yes, but &quot;many&quot; are willing to listen
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to them? Embarrassing contradiction. Kids in the 21st century are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;incredulous&quot; that a geezer band from the 70s has no presence today?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Laughable. And what is the basis for all these breathless
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; generalizations? Did the author commission a survey of young people's
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; attitudes toward Yes?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Joe Ramirez

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Yes is a big hit with teenagers these days. The ones that are willing
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to discover new music not played on radio. There is a reason all the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; current rock bands are all retro.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Right. Raja, I have a teenage son who has teenage friends and owns a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; teenager's iPod stuffed with rock (not music on the radio). I have a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; niece and nephew who just left their teens. Where is Yes with these
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; listeners? Nowhere. My nephew is actually a big fan of classic rock
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and spends a lot of time learning the guitar riffs -- but that means
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Led Zep, AC/DC, Clapton, Hendrix, etc., not Yes. Your article actually
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; managed to get something right when it said, &quot;few under-20s will now
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; even have heard of them.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Joe Ramirez

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Your nephew learning to play guitar riffs is the problem.  Led Zep , AC/DC
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is easy guitar. He dosent have a prayer of figuring out Steve Howe riffs and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lacks the physical ability to do so.  Hence his bordom/frustration with Yes.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If the guy's nephew could learn to play like Angus Young or Jimmy Page, the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; fact that he has never heard of Yes would not hurt his music career in the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; least.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Page and Howe are in the same level but Young (as much as I like him)
&gt; &gt; &gt; is like 2 leagues below them. So your statement is wrong.

&gt; &gt; Oh fuck off.  Young is an incredible blues guitarist who can do some pretty
&gt; &gt; incredible things on the guitar.  Let's not forget his brother, one of the
&gt; &gt; best rhythm guitars in the business.

&gt; &gt; YOu're such a goddamn twit about these things.  The fact that you whack off
&gt; &gt; to Yes somehow means that your opinion means shit out there.

&gt; listen you bastard. AC/DC is one of my favorite bands. Angus Young is
&gt; one of my favorite guitarists. But he is technically not as good as
&gt; Page or Howe or Hendrix. He is nor versatile or creative as Page and
&gt; Howe.- Hide quoted text -

Speaking of AC/DC has anyone seen this. This is their early early

Fair enough, I suppose.  But you might want to consider that there are
entire universes of music with other esthetic agendas out there before
calling it &quot;pompously unmusical&quot; when you ask so little of music.  Sorry

But, anyway:  &quot;Wonderous Stories.&quot;  Less than 4 minutes, still sounds

Nothing much anywhere about Steve Howe's earlier band, Bodast.
Very surprising, since &quot;Nether Street&quot; is the genesis of Yes'
signature riff from &quot;Wurm,&quot; from &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; (chords
D Bb G).

Always wondered if the Butthole Surfers didn't rip that one off
and turn it into the overture from &quot;Sweat Loaf.&quot;

The titles of Kings of Prog belongs to Yes! King Crimson were pretty
good but wildly inconsistent. Between debut and Lark's Tongue in

That's always been the most infuriating thing about learning new

&gt;&gt; 'Catchy'? In all candour, can you really see any of these actually

&gt;not all catchy stuff is top 40 oriented. Piper at the Gates of Dawn
&gt;has many catchy songs none of them would/could be top 40. And wasnt
&gt;Jimi Hendrix Experience a one hit wonder band? They had several catchy
&gt;stuff.

Man, you need a dose of Roto-Rooter for the brain.
