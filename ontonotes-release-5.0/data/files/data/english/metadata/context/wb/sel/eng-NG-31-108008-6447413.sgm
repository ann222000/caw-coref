Hi folks,

I'm thinking about using bentonite for fining my pomegranate wine. After
using bentonite, is it necessary to filter the wine before bottling? Also,
how long can the wine sit on the bentonite before it should be racked or
bottled?

And I'm open to other suggestions for clarifying although bentonite is
most convenient for me.

Bentonite should be used at room temperature but filtering is always
optional if the fining was successful.  It's not a requirement for
bentonite or most fining agents.  Bentonite lees are a little fluffy;
you should probably let is sit for a few weeks.  I haven't had issues
with it being on the bentonite lees for over a month but there is no
benefit to letting it sit once it quits dropping sediment that I am
aware of. Some people counter-fine, other cold stabilize right on those
lees to have any tartrate crystals settle on the bentonite and compact
it.

(I don't know if pomegranates even have any tartrates to drop out.)

I just rack the clear wine off and take the bentonite lees and put them
in a smaller full container and resettle them.
