Noticing another post on the issue of the water level of the Avon, it
may have been Gilbert Slater (a British Oxford) who remarked that most persons
in 1623-1624 seeing the First Folio for sale would have thought of the much
larger and better known Avon river of Wiltshire...especially with the First
Folio being dedicated to Lady Pembroke's two sons...leaders of the Patriot
faction at court critical and opposed to the Spanish Marriage being promoted by
King James. Her literary circle at her estate on the Avon River was well-known
and it would not have been unusual for a buyer of a First Folio to wonder if
she and her proteges (Damiel being the best known) had created the literary
works.

They certainly wouldn't have thought they were created by the man
whose name and picture were in the book, and who all his life had a
home in a place called Stratford-upon-AVON--whose church had a
monument to him that was referred to in the First Folio.

Instead of the river's current condition in Stratford compared to
Wiltshire, you might better look at Jonson's extended image of
the Avon in connection to the Thames, with emphasis on
Shakespeare as &quot;Sweet Swan&quot; of Avon. I understand that swans
were/are a protected bird reserved for royalty.

Of course, Lady Pembroke has special significance in her own
right as an author and for the literary inner circle she
attracted following her voluntary retirement from court,
evidently as a result of suffering cosmetic damage from the
plague, which she got tending Elizabeth I during her sickness.
Who knows if Shakespeare sometimes alludes to her in the sonnets?

Who knows if Shakespeare was one of the poets who carried
Spenser's body to be buried in Westminster Abbey when he died of
&quot;lack of bread,&quot; according to Jonson?
(quote)
Camden recorded that the Earl of Essex paid for his funeral, and
that poets carried his coffin, throwing their verses and pens,
along with many tears, into his grave. His tomb is situated,
appropriately enough, adjacent to that of Geoffrey Chaucer in
Westminster Abbey.
(unquote)

I bet a sociogram, shown by lines drawn based on known
communications between poets like Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare,
Harvey, Raleigh, Lady Pembroke, et al., would suggest Stratman
was also &quot;well known&quot; in his own right; and as Jonson puts it, &quot;

&quot;Shakespeare at Westminster Abbey&quot;

After drawing up the sociogram, the movie about Shakespeare's
intrigues might begin with the scene of poets carrying Spenser's
coffin to Westminster Abbey, except that the face of one poet is
hidden. An underlying burden is the rumor Spenser was murdered,
and Elizabeth I is suspected because she dislikes being known as
the &quot;Fairy Queen.&quot;

Then in flashbacks the patrons of the arts inner circle is
pictured discussing with a court emissary the Irish and Welsh
problem and what can be done to manipulate influences in support
of occupation. The Spenser and Essex connections are established
in this. In scenes centering on different personalities, showing
their abilities and connections, the web of influence managed by
the court emissary is pictured, mainly in terms of the Herberts,
also involving Raleigh and Essex as loose cannon.

A sub-plot concerns romantic diddling of court circles involving
players and across-the-river sin industries, with Shakespeare and
company an organizing factor. Marlowe operates in his inimitable
fashion. Bacon may be a victim of the intrigue set up with a
false charge of accepting bribes. Either Bacon or Oxford might
be the court emissary.

Shakespeare, like Spenser and Essex, is sympathetic to the Irish,
but is shown explaining to his acting company his strategy of
espousing the court position on English occupation; yet
expressing this his artistic side belies it.

All along there is conflict in Shakespeare deciding his
appearance carrying Spenser's coffin, between 1)Shakespeare's
allegiance with the court, manipulated by strings connected to
the court because, as a bastard product of court romps he was
placed in Stratford with a rustic family along with a rich purse,
as was the custom; and 2) his natural affinities with actors and
poets free expression of sensibilities, symbolized by the Welsh
and Irish.

In the final scene, Essex and Lady Pembroke communicate with
Elizabeth I, who has permitted Spenser to be buried in
Westminster Abbey.

The End.

Liberace's first name, Dave?

But even if Manningham didn't know much about Shakespeare (which makes
one wonder where he got the anecdote and why he thought it worth
recording), that's only one witness versus the others who wrote of
Shakespeare (except forgot to include his address when writing of him,
or say they knew him personally).

I like it. Good scenes. Now if only someone could turn them into rime
royal, you'd really have something! Kennedy?

I recently read an interesting book by Patrick Cheney, Marlowe's
Counterfeit Profession: Ovid, Spenser, Counter-Nationhood (University
of Toronto Press, 1997)
&lt;&gt;
in which the author argues that Marlowe employed and Ovidian &quot;cursus&quot;
or career model in competition with Spenser's Virgilian cursus, and he
offers evidence based on the career models--and literary output-- of
all of these poets. Interesting in that regard is that Ovid was
banished from his native land, like some of Shakespeare's memorable
characters, such as Touchstone.

"/>

Touchstone is not banished. He is loyal to Duke and loyal to
Rosalind, so he leaves court when the girls leave. Voluntarily.
There is a great hint that he is working for Duke and he
is fetching Rosalind in I, ii :

TOUCHSTONE: Mistress, you must come away to your father.
CELIA: Were you made the messenger?
TOUCHSTONE: No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.

And hey, if Marlowe was banished, that would publicly serve
the Queen AND Marlowe and we wouldn't need the charade of
the faked death which can't be explained anyway (whose side
was the Queen on and why didn't she really kill or banish
him instead of enjoying his plays and why didn't he simply
return upon her death and if he had the same or a like feud
with James, why didn't James kill or banish him instead of
enjoying his plays and making them the mainstream entertainment
of his personally patronized company, but whose quibbling about
such enormous incidentals anyway?).

&lt;&lt;Once upon a time ELSA, daughter of a deceased Duke lived in the castle
called Kleve, sometimes called the &quot;SWAN Castle&quot;. ELSA had barely come
of age when both of her parents died, and her younger brother followed
them after a short illness.

. . . .

After a sleepless night, ELSA confronted her husband with the
oath-breaking question: &quot;In the name of out sons - what do you call
yourself? And from where do you come?&quot; He stared at her clutching his
heart: &quot;Such happiness and now it is in shreds! You should never have
asked that question, as you well know. I shall answer you, but then I
must leave you!&quot; ELSA implored him not to say such a thing, but he
continued:

&quot;Know this: in a far-off land, inaccessible to you all, there stands a
castle, called Montsalwatsch. In the center gleams a glittering house of
God, more splendid than any ever built on earth. And this house contains
the most precious thing in existence: the Holy Grail. Twelve brave
heroes were selected to protect it. They are also available to come to
the assistance of innocent people who ask for help. King Percival is the
leader and all who serve him recieve strength from the Grail. But no one
is allowed to ask their names or who sent them. They have to leave
anyone who discovers their identity.&quot; ELSA cried out at this declaration
but the the SWAN knight voice continued as though it were coming from
another world: &quot;I was sent here from the Grail. My father is King
Percival. I, his knight-errant, am named Lohengrin!&quot;

As he spoke these words, the SWAN came gliding by, still harnessed to
the golden boat as it was so many years ago. It barely touched the bank
and Lohengrin was already inside. As the SWAN and the boat moved off,
Lohengrin did not glace back. Desperately, ELSA followed along the bank,
but she could not catch him. Heart-broken she returned to the castle and
she never again saw Lohengrin, no matter how often she visited the banks
in the vain hope of finding him. Her three sons remained her only
friends. They developed great chivalrous virtues, and they passed on
their strength and wisdom to many a later generation. They all bore
the SWAN in their coat of arms, and proudly called themselves
&quot;the SWAN Knights of Kleve&quot;.

Greg R's incidental enormities require answers:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
Greg Reynolds &lt;even ... @core.com&gt; wrote in message &lt;news:3F3BF879.22F61746@core.com&gt;...
&gt; Touchstone is not banished. He is loyal to Duke and loyal to
&gt; Rosalind, so he leaves court when the girls leave. Voluntarily.
&gt; There is a great hint that he is working for Duke and he
&gt; is fetching Rosalind in I, ii :

&gt; TOUCHSTONE: Mistress, you must come away to your father.
&gt; CELIA: Were you made the messenger?
&gt; TOUCHSTONE: No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.

"/>

You're absolutely right, Greg. I was thinking about the line where he
jokes about being like Ovid (banished) among the Goths, which we
aren't to take literally (but 'between the lines'). Thanks for the
point-out. I should have used some other memorable banished character,
like Kent from *King Lear*, or Lear himself, or Prospero, or ... the
list goes on.

There's something else about that scene in As YOu Like It, though:
When T'stone calls Audrey a foul slut, she answers that she isn't a
slut, but thankful for being &quot;foul.&quot; There's some wordplay here that's
escaping me, because why else would she make such a statement?

Back to your other points:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And hey, if Marlowe was banished, that would publicly serve
&gt; the Queen AND Marlowe and we wouldn't need the charade of
&gt; the faked death

"/>

Farey or Baker can jump in if they disagree, but it strikes me that
the death was needed to satisfy the Whitgiftian sense of justice by
taking Kit permanently off his list, so to speak. Banishment would
permit the greatest poet-dramatist of his generation to continue doing
his thing, though on a somewhat tighter leash.

which can't be explained anyway (whose side

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; was the Queen on and why didn't she really kill or banish
&gt; him instead of enjoying his plays

"/>

I think the Queen, on the advice of Burghley (and probably Essex, who
got his advice from Bacon at that time), MAY have tacitly agreed to a
plan to remove Marley's name permanently from the record of living
citizens on her little island. (Penry had pissed her off because he
called her &quot;Godless&quot; in some unpublished papers of his, so she
wouldn't mind at all if he was executed to substitute for CM at the
inquest.) Given the Cecil/Danby connection and the other
irregularities about the incident, and subsequent inquest (Farey does
an excellent job of presenting this on his website), it seems quite
likely that there was more to CM's murder than meets the eye. How much
more, remains to be seen--on the big screen one of these days.

and why didn't he simply

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; return upon her death and if he had the same or a like feud
&gt; with James,

"/>

I think James disappointed a lot of people who hoped he would be more
tolerant than he turned out to be. But Kit would have had the support
and friendship of many influential people, such as Mary Pembroke and
Wriothesley, and others who appreciated his wit and talent.

why didn't James kill or banish him instead of

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; enjoying his plays and making them the mainstream entertainment
&gt; of his personally patronized company, but whose quibbling about
&gt; such enormous incidentals anyway?).

"/>

It's unclear to me how much James knew about the Marley case, but I
think he'd rather enjoy the plays than kill the dramatist. Why would
he? What would be gained by killing CM by then?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I bet it wouldn't. What shall we bet?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Don't forget to include Manningham, one of the few people to
&gt; tell an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anecdote about the actor, and concluded by adding
&gt;&quot;Shakespeare's name
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was William.&quot; This was in 1600 or so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But a sociogram showing lines drawn between Marley and these
&gt; people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before his sudden end would show CM &quot;very well known&quot; -- the
&gt; very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; phrase he himself used to describe his relationship with Lord
&gt; Strange,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Earl of Derby.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; David More
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;http://www.marlovian.com&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Shakespeare at Westminster Abbey&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; After drawing up the sociogram, the movie about Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt; intrigues might begin with the scene of poets carrying Spenser's
&gt;&gt;&gt; coffin to Westminster Abbey, except that the face of one poet is
&gt;&gt;&gt; hidden. An underlying burden is the rumor Spenser was murdered,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and Elizabeth I is suspected because she dislikes being known as
&gt;&gt;&gt; the &quot;Fairy Queen.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then in flashbacks the patrons of the arts inner circle is
&gt;&gt;&gt; pictured discussing with a court emissary the Irish and Welsh
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem and what can be done to manipulate influences in support
&gt;&gt;&gt; of occupation. The Spenser and Essex connections are established
&gt;&gt;&gt; in this. In scenes centering on different personalities, showing
&gt;&gt;&gt; their abilities and connections, the web of influence managed by
&gt;&gt;&gt; the court emissary is pictured, mainly in terms of the Herberts,
&gt;&gt;&gt; also involving Raleigh and Essex as loose cannon.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A sub-plot concerns romantic diddling of court circles involving
&gt;&gt;&gt; players and across-the-river sin industries, with Shakespeare and
&gt;&gt;&gt; company an organizing factor. Marlowe operates in his inimitable
&gt;&gt;&gt; fashion. Bacon may be a victim of the intrigue set up with a
&gt;&gt;&gt; false charge of accepting bribes. Either Bacon or Oxford might
&gt;&gt;&gt; be the court emissary.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare, like Spenser and Essex, is sympathetic to the Irish,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but is shown explaining to his acting company his strategy of
&gt;&gt;&gt; espousing the court position on English occupation; yet
&gt;&gt;&gt; expressing this his artistic side belies it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; All along there is conflict in Shakespeare deciding his
&gt;&gt;&gt; appearance carrying Spenser's coffin, between 1)Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt;&gt; allegiance with the court, manipulated by strings connected to
&gt;&gt;&gt; the court because, as a bastard product of court romps he was
&gt;&gt;&gt; placed in Stratford with a rustic family along with a rich purse,
&gt;&gt;&gt; as was the custom; and 2) his natural affinities with actors and
&gt;&gt;&gt; poets free expression of sensibilities, symbolized by the Welsh
&gt;&gt;&gt; and Irish.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the final scene, Essex and Lady Pembroke communicate with
&gt;&gt;&gt; Elizabeth I, who has permitted Spenser to be buried in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Westminster Abbey.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The End.

&gt;&gt; I like it. Good scenes. Now if only someone could turn them into rime
&gt;&gt; royal, you'd really have something! Kennedy?

&gt;&gt; I recently read an interesting book by Patrick Cheney, Marlowe's
&gt;&gt; Counterfeit Profession: Ovid, Spenser, Counter-Nationhood (University
&gt;&gt; of Toronto Press, 1997)
&gt;&gt;&lt;http://english.la.psu.edu/faculty.asp?id=24&amp;pID=43&gt;
&gt;&gt; in which the author argues that Marlowe employed and Ovidian &quot;cursus&quot;
&gt;&gt; or career model in competition with Spenser's Virgilian cursus, and he
&gt;&gt; offers evidence based on the career models--and literary output-- of
&gt;&gt; all of these poets. Interesting in that regard is that Ovid was
&gt;&gt; banished from his native land, like some of Shakespeare's memorable
&gt;&gt; characters, such as Touchstone.

Eh, no it doesn't show he was well-known at all. It shows he was not

you know the anecdote only works if Shakespeare is called William but
he evidently wasn't that well-known.

&gt; But even if Manningham didn't know much about Shakespeare (which makes
&gt; one wonder where he got the anecdote and why he thought it worth

I always thought that was just a naughty Elizabethan joke that needed a William
and a Richard. Maybe it is a (or was thought to be) true anecdote, but in
parenthetically noting WS's first name it is clear that Manningham either
expected his diary to be read by others who might need a clue, or he was
chucking in a reminder to himself. Why do you think a person would do such a

&quot;One Mr Ousley of the Middle Temple, a young gallant, but of a short cut,
overtaking a tall stately stalking cavalier in the streets, made no more ado
but slipt into an ironmonger’s shop, threw off his cloak and rapier, fitted
