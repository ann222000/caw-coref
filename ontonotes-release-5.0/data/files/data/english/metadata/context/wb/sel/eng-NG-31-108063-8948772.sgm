Hello,

I am hoping someone can give me some valuable info here. We are about
to move to a farmhouse that has a canola farm which surrounds us
almost entirely. The farmer uses Roundup. I have heard about the
dangers of Roundup - particularly to pregnant women. I am wondering
what we can do to prevent ourselves from exposure. We would get water
via a well. Should we avoid it? We also have 3 cats that we wanted to
let roam outside. Is this a bad idea?

Thank you.

I'd like to know the name of the farm, so I can avoid buying canola
oil made from their produce (if possible to isolate from other
sources).

Or better still, pay the high cost of organic canola oil!

not sure myself whether you should avoid it however if you are worried about
drinking water you can set up a drinking water system using run off from
your roof.

Is it safe to assume that you had your well water tested by a lab so far
away from your future home that it's unlikely anyone at the lab was related
to the farmer through blood, politics or business?

If the farmer follows all of the procedures specified by the law and
policies of your area (you did not tell us where you are) then you
should have no problem.  That may or may not be a big &quot;if&quot;.

I would contact the farmer and express my concern.  Ask him what
pesticides he uses and what his procedures are.  Ask him to notify you
on days that he will be using pesticides near your home so that you
can personally monitor the application.  If your monitoring gives you
concern then address them with him and the local agricultural
authorities.

All of the farmers that I know in my area, (southern NH) would welcome
such a discourse with their neighbors and would be as concerned as
you.

JMHO

I would be more interested in discussing with them the ultimate

of farmers nowadays, especially in the Northeast, that are
successfully pulling in crops without using Roundup at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; what we can do to prevent ourselves from exposure.

&gt;    If your new place's adjoining garden has healthy plants growing in
&gt; it, that suggests it's not being hit by Roundup weedkiller spray drift
&gt; fall-out. Grass in particular is very sensitive to Roundup drift.
&gt; However, the farmer may also be applying insecticide spray, whose
&gt; effects don't show up  so obviously but could be far more worrying.  So
&gt; on spray days I'd certainly  stay indoors with the windows shut, and not
&gt; hang out the washing to dry.

&gt;  We would get water

&gt; &gt; &gt; via a well. Should we avoid it?
&gt; &gt; not sure myself whether you should avoid it however if you are worried about
&gt; &gt; drinking water you can set up a drinking water system using run off from
&gt; &gt; your roof.

&gt;   But the roof is equally a collection system for  spray particles,
&gt; which would wash down into the watersystem.

&gt;   Janet.
">

Thanks Janet. Yes, there is lots of vegetation in the yard and a
massive lawn, so that's a good sign.

On spray days - how long would we need to stay away? Could the wind
blow it around for days afterwards, or does it soak in immediately?
It's a 150 acre farm, almost entirely surrounding us. (We're in
Ontario, BTW).

I think we'll get the water tested before we use it.

Thanks alot for your help,

Darryl

what is more to worry about is that the crops are genetically modified/engineered to
be &quot;roundup ready&quot; so the roundup can be poured on and not affect the crops.  Ingrid

stuff and toss most of it when it begins to smell off.  then again, we dont deep fry
anything.  Ingrid

technically you are correct and that is why the NCDA &amp; CS uses
the term on the license they issue to anyone passing their
certification requirements.

in the reality of the application one would not apply a herbicide
in order to kill insects.  therefore classifications and categories
are established so as to make labeling clear for specific use
applications.

What did you do about weeds like dogbane that can't be effectively

There probably is no definitive answer to the next question.  What's
better environmentally, using chemicals and modern farming practices on
fewer total acres or using older methods on more total acres?

Thanks for the kind words Billy but you do not have it quite right.  I
am a small farmer who uses integrated pest management techniques. That
is it.  The only consulting I do is expressing opinions on the news
group and answering questions put to me by friends and family.

I get dismayed when people immediately assume that the farmer who uses
pesticides and evil being intent on destroying the earth.  In my
experience nothing could be further from the truth.

All of the farmers I meet at the numerous seminars and classes that we
all intend to improve our knowledge and skills are very concerned with
the proper application of controls, be they organic or chemical.

Notably, both types of farmers attend these seminars, which are
usually run by the agricultural extension service, and exchange views.
Often the seminar will occur at a farm which may be organic or not.
Again both types of farmers attend and are interested in the
techniques used on that farm.

Farmers are business people who make their living and provide for
their families by farming.  They are interested in the most economical
methods of operation and surely want to avoid anything that would be
detrimental to the continuing success of their enterprise.  Excessive
and misdirected use of any product is contrary to their goals so it
does not happen except by accident and such accidents are usually
quickly investigated resulting in corrective action.

These farmers are constantly on the lookout for techniques that will
make them more efficient.  Qualified labor is a scarce and therefore
valuable commodity.  The farmer spends the labor available to him as
wisely as possible.  He must because market pressures put a limit on
the value of his products.  That is how the free market system works
and the farmer lives by those rules or goes under.

If you're conducting a GWOPI[1] then you can count me on as an ally who relies on the tactical application of CBW agents.  My favorite is Ortho Brush-B-Gon (Triclopyr) applied in early Spring about the time that the multiflora rose begins to leaf out.  One targeted application on the PI, MFR, and other assorted jagger bushes[2] does them in.  I still have to avoid the dead vines because the urushiol retains its capability to cause pain and distress (as do the jaggers).

Glyphosate takes a variable amount of time to break down, depending
mostly on temperature, but it binds immediately with any clay particles
it comes into contact with, which inactivates it.  The antidote for
accidental glyphosate ingestion is Kaopectate, which contains kaolin
clay.  Even a slight murkiness in the water used to mix the spray will
reduce or eliminate the effectiveness of glyphosate.  Essentially, once
it hits the ground, it's dead.  It does not transport through the soil
by water motion.

It is not legal to machine apply glyphosate within 50 feet of open
water.  Using a hand sprayer, you can get within 10 feet.

My error, and my apology for miss characterizing you but I still respect
your knowledge and honesty. In your response about the use of &quot;Round-up&quot;
you put in a very large &quot;if&quot;. Personally, I hate these chemicals and
that gives me a reflex reaction against them. You help me understand why
a person may rationally wish to use them or not. It gives me balance,
and I still hate them, but I respect your opinion.

I wish you luck because I don't believe it is  a free market. It seems
that today, for a farmer to survive, he must find a niche market that
isn't worth the trouble for big agra.

Again my apologies for not listening more closely.

Not exactly. I've been fresh cut stump treating with Roundup for three
years, mostly multiflora rose and Autumn Olive. I cut them off close to
the ground and also use a paint scraper to scarify exposed roots, then
brush on the Roundup. By the time I get to the end of a batch, I've
carried enough soil into the container with the brush that the solution is
seriously &quot;murky&quot;, with some soil settled out on the bottom.  I was
concerned about this at first, but found it still was effective. So, while
the glyphosate may have been adsorbed onto the surface of soil particles,
it was not inactivated.
