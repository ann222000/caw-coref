I don't do a lot of battlegrounds because most of the the time, they
don't seem that much fun to me.  When they are 'good', they are quite
good but when they are bad... well...they are more than 'quite
bad'. :)

But anyway, I have a few lowbie chars that been participating in WSG
(in the lvl 10-19 range) because there are a few reward items I would
like to have.

When I play a Warrior or Hunter, I seem not have much problem in bgs,
almost aways ending up fairly high in the damage/kill stats, and
winning a fair share of them.  And as a sidenote, I only play in them
when lvl 18/19.

But when I send my lock or mage to a bg, I am completely lost.  I seem
to be an 'insta-target', and fall within seconds, and rarely end up
with any significant number of kills.  So I switched over to more of a
'support' kind of guy: slow the flag and guards, help protect ours,
etc. but seemingly without much effect.

So...

Strategy: what kind of role should locks and mages play in bg's?

Tactics: What tactics should I use in support of these roles?

Thanks!

For your warlock just select someone, dot, dot, &amp; run. Let the DoT's
take them out over time and you'll get credit for pretty much every
kill on the field.

The best strategy for a squishy is to avoid getting hurt. Especially
in WSG people will (and should) group up so they're less of a target
and more of a killing force. Not 100% sure what talents and skills you
have for either class but the more you avoid getting grouped up on (or
any damage in general) the better you'll do.

As a lock, dot everything you see... Tab, dot, dot, dot, tab, dot dot
dot, etc... Go in a group and stay back. Dot the FC and fear them

Mage: Slow down the FC &amp; Hide.

Lock: DoT everyone you see &amp; Hide.

Cloth wearers are targets at every level in PvP.  You either learn how
to deal with it, or you die over and over and over again and never
learn to enjoy PvP.

On the serious side, if you continue to do BG's and try different
thing all the time and pay attention to what works and what doesn't
you'll figure it out. :)

The same strategy you use in an instance: Stay with your team, behind

I'm a POM fire mage, played a lot of lower level bg. I was very often on top
of kill list but also on top of death list.
My strategy:

1) Attack:
If youre going for the flag, make sure to be full on mana, and have a mana
jade/citrine and mana potions. Put your mana shield, run in, take flag,
frost nova and blink towards exit. On your way to base just spam mana
shield/blink/frost nova

If youre defending the FC, then its obvious sheep/frost nova

2) Def:
Hide somewhere and spam AOE if theres a group and burst at FC

3) Misc
Stand behind a tank and pop fireballs, sheep healers and mages, counterspell
I wouldt shoot at everyboy in sight, but rather concentrate on one target
with less hp which i could take out with instant burst damage (instant pyro,
fireblast, cone of cold and some arcane explosions or quick scorches if he's
runing away)
If you see 10 enemies coming your way, run in the middle  and AOE of :)

My arcane/fire build has proven much fun in bg. Instant pyro si def. a
must-have for me, because you dont have much time to stand there and cast
something.

In my experience (I play Alliance exclusively with my lock, and always with
whatever battleground PUG I end up in -- never with people I know) is that
there is very little teamwork. Nobody will protect you, and this spells
disaster for a mage or a lock. If you can find a friend who is a warrior or
rogue, then you may be able to team up and have some success. Otherwise, a
big part of your strategy has to be to avoid getting killed.

I like to hide as best I can and DoT the Horde when they're not looking. Use
whatever landscape cover that can be to your advantage. Once an enemy melee
class sees you, he will rush you and hack you to bits. If you have access to
fear (I just got Death Cool, woohoo!) then you can use that as a defense.

For pets, I tend to use my Felhunter, as (I think) his paranoia helps spot
rogues who love to sneak up and kill me. Succubus could be useful as crowd
control, but I haven't tried that much.

I usually end up in the top third of the rankings for damage because a
warlock's DoTs can be pretty powerful. I'm always in the top third for deaths
and I get killed fairly often. Once a melee player decides to turn a cloth
wearer into hamburger, there's little you can do about it, short of using a
fear spell. If that doesn't work, then you're pretty much screwed.

I am an engineer, and I have a mechanical dragon and a mithril mechanical
dragon, which can turn a solo battle to my advantage, but they can only be
used once per 60 minutes, making it a one-shot deal in a battlefield. I love
my discombobulator ray, because it's so fun to watch horde turn into ugly
little leper gnomes. I tried using my Gnomish Shrinkray, but found that it
causes an unacceptly high ammount of aggro [not from mobs, but from party
members when the damn thing backfires and shrinks the entire party. You'll
get some angry teammates when that happens]. I haven't used my Gnomish
deathray yet; it would be interesting to see if I could turn it into a melee
player killer.

In general I have a lot of fun in the BGs. Occasionally some other players
will help me out getting the melee characters off my back, but usually I'm on
my own. The 'lock is the often unnoticed underapreciated hero of the
battlefields because of the damage we do. Heck, even after we're dead our
DoTs continue to plague our victims. But, the melee figthers get all the
credit because they're the ones that look like they're doing the killing! :)

Locks are easy in the battle grounds. Just keep using tab and dot 'em up.
I've found that the best pet for me in a battle ground is the imp on
mana battery duty. If you're in WSG and you manage to get the flag, then it's
run like hell and keep hitting the tab key as you run. Whenever an enemry pops
up, cast Curse of Exhaustion and keep on running. If you're escorting the FC,
do the same thing. Just slow down the enemy and keep up with the FC. But
otherwise just DoT everything in sight (and many times things out of sight).

And use your mouse for movement and have everything else bound to the keyboard.
Frankly, while in the BG, your tab key should be getting quite a work out even
if you don't see anything around you. If a target pops up and there isn't a red
indicator on your action bar for the DoT, then apply the DoT and keep on
running.

I played a lvl 19 mage in WSG and had her loaded up with +stam/+health gear
and enchants. IIRC she had close to 1k health and was damn near unkillable:)
Mind you, she didn't actually do much damage, and ran out of mana pretty
fast, but she hardly ever died... and opposing rogues and warriors would
often chase and beat on her and ignore the others who were killing them.
Mage tanking FTW! :)

I've started doing the BG's again and i'm a lvl 70 warlock.  I did AB
at lvl 29 and amased a lot of honor points for a couple items.  Here
are some of the things i've noticed after 2 visits to AB.

Without protection you get slaughtered quite regulary.  Your lucky if
you can even get one spell cast off.  If you have protection you'll
own the field.  I'm an affliction Lock with 40/0/21 and i have ruin in
destruction.  My SB's hit from 1100 to 3500.  Usually 3 to 7 SB's and
they go down.  Its getting the time to cast them.  I&quot;d rather SB than
dot.

Get a melee fighter to go with you and enjoy.

It doesn't become impossible, but it does become harder when Rogues get
Cloak of Shadows. Takes all the DOTs and curses right off and gives them
90% resistence to everything for several seconds.

Works better with Warriors, though if you get sloppy and get within
Intercept range, CoEx doesn't help, since Intercept ignores it.

I usualy enjoy playing a lock in BGs. Allfiction is your friend in
pvp... just dot anyone you see then run to your group for protection
most of the time when bg ends I am on top or second most damage dealer
because of the number or hordes I dot and they usually die with a tick
of one of my dots.. never done that much damage with my rogue since I
will be damaging one target at a time.

mages... I have level 38 mage and I casually play bgs with her when I
am bored.. she used to be frost but respecced to fire.. with frost you
are better in protecting flag carriers in wsg with frost nova for
multiple targets. with a single target sheep will work just fine if
they stay within casting range but i don't do alot of damage since I
am focusing on protecting.... in fire I usually stick with a group to
avoid being outnumbered when I am alone and damage can be done nicely
but not effectively as a warlock..

Only way I see to kill rogues is to make them use cloak of skill as soon as
possible and save  howl of terror or deathcoil to get distance after they
close in agian.
(I really dont get it why rogues got that skill since they didnt have caster
problems but warrior problems and they still cant kill a warrior or feral
druid)

It's hard to not get in intercept range due to lag but a deathcoil at
intercept could help a lot and if they dont take you down then they dont
have much chance to kill you.

As Mage scan for low life targets. Use Fire Blast at range and Arcane
Explosion in a crowd. Fireballs and Arcane Missiles should be used only
when few enemies are around, as they leave a trail which shows everyone
exactly where you are. That is very bad. ALWAYS get enough Frost points
to reduce the cooldown on Frost Nova.

The other thing about being a mage is - get used to dying ALOT.

I leveled my Mage from 30-40 primarily in AB. It was some of the most
fun I had playing WoW. Blizzard blew it when they took xp away from BGs.
Damn them!

Perhaps because the game doesn't revolve around pvp only? I can tell you I
always had problems with more than one caster mob in pve, or with AOEs off
bosses etc... cloak of shadows was a fantastic addition there.

&gt; &gt; I don't do a lot of battlegrounds because most of the the time, they
&gt; &gt; don't seem that much fun to me.  When they are 'good', they are quite
&gt; &gt; good but when they are bad... well...they are more than 'quite
&gt; &gt; bad'. :)

&gt; &gt; But anyway, I have a few lowbie chars that been participating in WSG
&gt; &gt; (in the lvl 10-19 range) because there are a few reward items I would
&gt; &gt; like to have.

&gt; &gt; When I play a Warrior or Hunter, I seem not have much problem in bgs,
&gt; &gt; almost aways ending up fairly high in the damage/kill stats, and
&gt; &gt; winning a fair share of them.  And as a sidenote, I only play in them
&gt; &gt; when lvl 18/19.

&gt; &gt; But when I send my lock or mage to a bg, I am completely lost.  I seem
&gt; &gt; to be an 'insta-target', and fall within seconds, and rarely end up
&gt; &gt; with any significant number of kills.  So I switched over to more of a
&gt; &gt; 'support' kind of guy: slow the flag and guards, help protect ours,
&gt; &gt; etc. but seemingly without much effect.

&gt; &gt; So...

&gt; &gt; Strategy: what kind of role should locks and mages play in bg's?

&gt; &gt; Tactics: What tactics should I use in support of these roles?

&gt; &gt; Thanks!

&gt; As Mage scan for low life targets. Use Fire Blast at range and Arcane
&gt; Explosion in a crowd. Fireballs and Arcane Missiles should be used only
&gt; when few enemies are around, as they leave a trail which shows everyone
&gt; exactly where you are. That is very bad. ALWAYS get enough Frost points
&gt; to reduce the cooldown on Frost Nova.

Again, thanks for all the great (new) comments.  I played last night
and did MUCH better (using a lvl 19 mage).

I actually performed quite well while defending; in one bg, a
stealthed rogue and I stood near the flag.  If a single or a twosome
came by, I would just freeze them and back off.  The rogue would do
most of the damage and I would so some 'finishing up'

Also, this mage is Arcane specced, has the talents that keep Arcane
Missile from being interrupted, and some Arcane damage bonus items.
Not a twink but can really dish out some damage quite quickly.

Another defensive trick I learned that if the flag capturer goes down
the tunnel, I can often head them off at the exit.  Once they
emerge... boom!  frosted!  In one case, a carrier saw me at the end of
the tunnel and actually reversed direction. :)  I thought that was
pretty cool.

But the best story (so some good stuff did come from all the advice
here) was when we were ahead 2-1, and the enemy flag was on the way
to our flag room.  I was in the flag room defending our flag when
three bad guys appeared, trying to grab our flag.  But (somehow!) I
managed to time it exactly right and froze all three before they could
reach the flag.  And about five seconds letter, the Ally flag arrived,
sealing our victory.  I bet they were pissed. :) That was quite sweet.

I had a similar experience with my mage but a little different... We
were at tide 2-2. The hordes grabbed the flag and were going to
deliver to their base... I was on their roof and just as the carrier
and 2 defenders were about to reach their flag I jumped then freeze
them with frost nova and grab their flag and make a run when an ally
paladin was coming so I dropped the flag for him to carry since I was
an easy target... Allies were able to get our flag back and deliver
the horde flag scoring the win.. (felt a bit proud about that :P)

I agree with the poster who said &quot;prepare to die a lot&quot;.

I'm continually giving one 'for the team'.  Lots of times (as mage) I
will just now run into a melee fest and bang the freeze in the middle
of at all, and then try to find a clothie to pick on before someone
figures out I'm there and one-shots me.

And as an addendum to my ongoing bg learning experience... last night
was so-so.  I played some rounds pretty badly, and overall we won only
two and lost about six or seven

But time for a bit of a rant...  several times last night I heard
complaints from the 'pros' (this was WSG lvl 10-19) about noobs
playing, about lower levels playing, and 'poorly geared' characters
playing.

Well gee, everyone isn't born with blues in their pocket nor have a
level 70 alt to draw on.  At some point, it has to be your first bg,
and there also is a definite learning curve to playing well in them.

So instead of whining or bitching or being downright rude (one guy
cheered when one of our teammates left), why not try a little
constructive criticism?  &quot;Head for the fr and defend&quot; or &quot;support our
fc&quot; or &quot;go after the healer&quot;.  Almost anything is better than &quot;Leave
now!&quot; (not directed at me but I suppose it could have been in previous
bgs).

Granted, there are some guys who probably deserve to be booted (like
one of our 'leaders' last night who was continuously AFK; that was
pretty amazing).

I been doing this at lvl 70 for two days now.  I'm usually have the
highest kills or at least very near the top.  I'm also one of the top
damage dealers.  I get behind my melee guys and spam dots on anything
i can.  If they got 3k or less health i'll spam SB's on them.  I die a
bunch but then i kill a bunch also.

This rogue attacked me a little bit ago in AB.  It took him almost a
min to kill me.  I kept dotting him and I cast iHOT then when he came
back i cast DC and then feared him.  I pumped a SB in him and hit the
DL on him.  I never thought i could beat him but i did take him out of
action for a bit.

I&quot;m loving it.

The pig form of Polymorph is acquired through a quest chain in Azshara.
I got mine. Wish it was pink, so to better distinguish it from the sheep
form.

There is also a turtle form, which (I hear) drops in Zul Gurub. I would
like to have that, but I was away from the game when my guild was
running ZG.

Don't pvp myself, but I hear the various Crowd control ability's like
sheep have diminishing returns when used against another human player,
which make them less likely to work the more times in a row they're
used.  I believe Fears and seduce are similarly afflicted.

I can be resisted and the more it's used on the same player the higher
the chance of resist.  Like Ashton said, diminishing returns.  It also
only lasts 10 seconds in PvP now, instead of 30.  Sap is effected the
same unfortunately :(

&gt;&gt; Pigged by a lvl 20-29 in BG ?
&gt;&gt; Isn't that quest lvl 50 ?

&gt;He said &quot;since I was lvl 29&quot; so I suspect he's way past that now.  But
&gt;where's the snapshot?

We wre all lvl 70's and its on my computer.  I didn't think you could
post binaries here.  If so let me know as i'd be happy to post it.

BTW i'm playing a lot better now and by this time tomorrow i'll have
&quot;Insignia of the Alliance&quot; on me.  So if it happens again its just a
button push from unhappening

&gt;&gt; Weird thing, though.  Some Pally was attempting to steal our flag, so
&gt;&gt; I sheeped him three times in a row successfully, and then failed twice
&gt;&gt; in a row (and thus dieing).  Just unlucky, or was he able to do
&gt;&gt; something to prevent it?

&gt; I can be resisted and the more it's used on the same player the higher
&gt; the chance of resist.  Like Ashton said, diminishing returns.  It also
&gt; only lasts 10 seconds in PvP now, instead of 30.  Sap is effected the
&gt; same unfortunately :(

&gt; I got zapped by the Turtle thing while dueling outside Kara the other
&gt; night, funny as heck :)

Yes, you can be CC'd 3 times (10sec, 8 sec and then 6 sec from patch 2.2)
then you become immune from that spell - not sure if it's just that specific
characters' spell or if it's the spell in general.
