Hi, I have been reading a lot about this but want your advice. I have
used credit cards to pay for school and school expenses over the years
accruing rather high balances near the limits--it was an awful idea and
I would never do it again--but I am where I am now so I have to deal
with it.

I can payoff my balances in 4-5 years and no longer use or want credit
cards, but I do know that, if paid down and on time, keeping them open
will help my credit score. I really have no use for them anymore and do
not even want them, except for maybe one I have from my credit union.

Should I close all of them, even though they have balances? I have
already done this on a Chase card because they tried to jack up the
rate to ~%30. All I can say is it felt great.

Thanks for your advice!

"/> I believe that you *CAN'T* close them when they have balances, most
of the time, unless you are prepared to pay off the balance or
transfer it elsewhere or just take a HUGE black mark and refuse to
pay. And they'll look like they are open on your credit report
anyway.

Having a lot of available credit, relative to your income, is BAD
on a credit report. Having a card that's been open for a while is
GOOD on a credit report (closing your oldest cards may not be a
good idea for the credit score). Having a lot of cards or too few
cards is BAD on a credit report (whatever that means. I've heard
some guesses that 2-3 general (not specific store) credit cards is
about right).

After you get your balances down, you need to trade off the above
issues and see what you want to do.

"/> Thanks for your reply. I was able to close my card with Chase which had
a substantial balance on it without penalty to lock in the old rate of
~13%.

Perhaps &quot;close&quot; is not the correct term, maybe &quot;closed to new
purchases&quot; is better. I have heard that banks in Delaware (and perhaps
elsewhere) have to allow you to do this. Maybe someone can corroborate
this I can't seem to find anything at this moment.

I suppose the benefit of closing it with a balance is to preserve the
rate. They tend to send you the notices about their rate hikes in thin
pamphlets in the hope that you don't see them and throw them away.
Since I have no use for these cards anymore, I figured it might be
better to cancel the cards then to risk not seeing one of their
pamphlets and my rate go up to %30.

"/> I think a better way to go is to cut up your unwanted credit cards and
not change your account status. This way, you remove the temptation to
use the credit cards, but your credit record remains intact.

"/> Actual that is not true in the US.

You have to word it correctly and send the cards back to the issuers
torn or cut into two.

I request the account to be permanently closed under FTC rules and no
further charges will be allowed. I agree to pay by the old terms and
not the NEW terms.

mail. Consumers get so used to taking all the junk out of the envelope
(including the perforated sheet on the reply envelope) and throwing it
away that they'll take the notice of an interest rate hike or other
change of terms and throw it away with the junk.

All the more reason not to carry a balance.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That was just their way to get another late

"/> You certainly have to do some homework as far as shipping costs. Buy
from reputable sellers with no shipping and you won't have that
problem, plus you save your state income tax. Hell, I rarely buy any
large purchase NOT online. I like to be able to see 50 different
versions of the same product rather than the 5 that the local store
might stock. To each his own.

&gt;They CAN and WILL find ways to rip you off. I paid on time and they

"/> BS I have had around 4 major credit cards that I have had for 30+ years
and have never had a single problem with the credit card companies. In
that period there have been 2 or 3 unauthorized charges but those were all
straightened out with one call each. (Once I had to fill out a fraud
report.)

You obviously have never had to rent a car in the last 8 years of not
possessing a CC.

I get cash back on my credit card and since I pay my bill in full every
month (on line) there are no fees. The card is, of course, free. I've
had very few problems with my credit cards, and the benefits of paying
with a credit card (cash back, the float, not having to carry cash, the
Fair Credit and Billing Act or whatever law lets you contest charges)
strongly outweigh the occasional glitch.

Last night I called to contest a charge and to request my rebate (from
the cash back).

The representative who answered the phone had a very heavy Indian
accent, and said &quot;Citibank customer service, my name is Steve, how may
I help you?&quot;

I said &quot;I'm sure you can help me, but I refuse to believe your name is
actually Steve!&quot;

He laughed, and he did help me.

Do they really expect us to believe that people half-way around the
world have American/English names? Are we more comfortable dealing
with an Indian claiming to be named Steve than an Indian actually named
Sunil or Sanjay?
