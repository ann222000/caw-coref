Emeril's Homemade Worcestershire Sauce

from Emeril's Creole Christmas Cookbook

Yield: 3 pints

2 Tablespoons olive oil
6 cups chopped onions
4 green jalapenos with stems and seeds, chopped (3/4 cup)
2 Tablespoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
Four 2-ounce cans anchovy fillets
1/2 teaspoon cloves
2 Tablespoons salt
2 medium-size lemons, skin and pith removed
4 cups dark corn syrup
2 cups Steen's 100% Pure Cane Syrup
1/2 gallon distilled white vinegar
4 cups water
3/4 pound fresh horseradish, peeled and grated (about 3 cups)

Combine the oil, onions, and jalapenos in a large heavy stockpot over
high heat. Cook, stirring, until slightly soft, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the
remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to
medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the mixture barely
coats a wooden spoon, about 6 hours. Strain through a fine-mesh
strainer.

Spoon the hot mixture into three hot sterilized pint-size jars, filling
to within 1/2 inch of the top. With a clean, damp cloth, wipe the rim
and fit with a hot sterilized lid. Tightly screw on the metal ring.
Place the jars on a rack, without them touching one another, in a deep
canning kettle with boiling water to cover by 1 inch. Cover the kettle
and boil for 15 minutes.

Using tongs, remove the jars from the water, place on a clean towel,
and let cool completely. During the heat processing, the contents of
the jars expand, forcing some of the air out. The remaining air inside
contracts as it cools to create a partial vacuum, which pulls the lid
tight against the jar rims. The vacuum and the lid's sealing compound
maintain the seal. A popping noise after the contents have cooled
indicates that the seal is complete. To test, press the center of the
cooled lid. If it stays depressed, the jar is sealed. If not,
refrigerate and use the contents within 2 to 3 weeks or reseal with a
new flat lid and repeat the hot water bath. Tighten the rings. Store in
a cool, dark place and let age for at least 2 weeks before using.
Refrigerate after opening; stored in a covered jar or bottle, the sauce
will keep indefinitely.
