September 17th - St. Robert Bellarmine

Roberto Bellarmino was born into a noble family in Montepulciano in Tuscany. In
1560, he joined the Jesuit order and began his studies at the Collegio Romano,
the Jesuit college in Rome. After finishing his course of studies there and
studying Thomistic theology at the university of Padua, Bellarmine became the
first Jesuit professor at the university of Louvain (in modern Belgium) in 1569
and was ordained as a priest the following year. Situated in the Low Countries
where Protestantism was gaining rapidly during this period, the university of
Louvain was becomes a bulwark of Catholic orthodoxy. Bellarmine taught theology
out of Thomas Acquinas's Summa Theologica and studied the Scriptures and the
Church Fathers in preparation for a major work on theology. During his period at
Louvain he wrote a Hebrew grammar and a work on the Church Fathers.

In 1576 Bellarmine was called back to Rome by Pope Gregory XIII to teach
theology to English and German missionaries at the Collegio Romano. He taught
there until 1588. Toward the end of this period, his most important scholarly
work began appearing:

Disputationes de Controversiis Christianae Fidei Adversus Hujus Temporis
Haereticos (Disputations about the Controversies of the Christian faith Against
the Heretics of this Time) (3 vols, Ingolstadt, 1586-1593). In this work,
Bellarmine brought order to the chaos of theological arguments between Catholics
and Protestants. Whereas the literature on this subject was marked by heated
debates and intemperate statements on both sides, Bellarmine calmly and fairly
reviewed the issues. These volumes became a remarkably effective weapon against
reform theology, and it has been argued that they occasioned the return of many
to the Catholic Church.

In 1588 Bellarmine became the spiritual director of the Collegio Romano. Among
his other duties he taught the catechism to students and lay brothers, and his
lessons eventually led to Dottrina Cristiani Breve (Brief Christian Doctrine)
Rome, 1597), a small catechism for children, and Dichiarazione piX Copiosa della
Dottrina Cristiani (A more copious declaration of the Christian doctrine) (Rome,
1598), a catechism for teachers. Approved by Pope Clement XIII, both catechisms
became very popular and were translated into many languages. Their popularity
lasted well into the twentieth century.

Bellarmine served as rector of the Collegio Romano in 1592, as provincial of
the Neapolitan province of the Jesuits in 1594, and papal theologian in 1597. In
1599 he was made a cardinal. From this time forward he was a member of the Roman
Congregation and served on many commissions. In 1602 he was consecrated an
archbishop and sent by Pope Clement VIII to Capua, where he concerned himself
mainly with pastoral duties. In 1605 he was recalled to Rome.

Bellarmine spent much of his time in theological controversies, mostly
involving papal power. He engaged in a public debate, a war of books and
pamphlets, concerning the divine right of kings with James I of England. The
issue of papal power revolved around the theory of the indirect power of the
Pope. His spiritual power is direct and primary; he was not, however, without
temporal power because he might have to act with regard to temporal things which
affected the spiritual ones. This was the Pope's indirect power, which
Bellarmine defended all his adult life.

In 1616 Bellarmine became involved in the Copernican controversy, which was
brought to a head by the publication of Paolo Antonio Foscarini's book defending
the Copernican system from the charge that it clashed with the Scriptures. It
was he who administered the controversial admonition to Galileo not to hold or
defend the Copernican theory.

In a time when cardinals maintained splendid courts, Bellarmine lived a simple
and ascetic life, practicing self-sacrifice, poverty, and disinterestedness.
Upon the death of Pope Sixtus V in 1590, the Count of Olivares wrote to King
Philip III of Spain about possible candidates for the papacy: &quot;Bellarmine is
beloved for his great goodness, but he is a scholar who lives only among books
and not of much practical ability . . . . He would not do for a Pope, for he is
mindful only of the interests of the Church and is unresponsive to the reasons
of princes . . . He would scruple to accept gifts . . . I suggest that we exert
no action in his favor.&quot; The King agreed.

The process of canonization was begun in 1627. In 1931 Pope Pius XI finally
declared Bellarmine a Doctor of the Church.

Bible Quote
8 Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead, of the
seed of David, according to my gospel. 9 Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an
evildoer; but the word of God is not bound. 10 Therefore I endure all things for
the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation, which is in
Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory. Â (2 Tim. 2:8-10)

Prayer for a Happy Death
By St. Charles Borromeo

IN THE NAME of the Most Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, I, a poor,
unhappy sinner, make this solemn declaration before thee, O beloved Angel, who
has been given me as a protector by the Divine Majesty:

1. I desire to die in the Faith which the Holy, Roman and Apostolic Church
adheres to and defends, in which all the Saints of the New Testament have died.
I pray thee, provide that I may not depart out of this life before the Holy
Sacraments of that Church have been administered to me.

2. I pray that I may depart from this life under thy holy protection and
guidance, and I beseech thee, therefore, to assist me at the hour of my death
and to propitiate the Eternal judge, whose Sacred Heart was inflamed with most
ardent love for sinners upon the Cross.

3. With my whole heart I long to be made a partaker of the merits of Jesus
Christ and His holy Mother Mary, thine exalted Queen, and I pray thee, through
the sufferings of Jesus on the Cross, to mitigate the agonies of my death and to
move the Queen of Heaven to cast her loving glance upon me, a poor sinner, in
that dreadful hour, for my sweetest consolation.

O my dearest Guardian Angel! Let my soul be placed in thy charge, and when it
has gone forth from the prison of this body, do thou deliver it into the hands
of its Creator and Redeemer, that with thee and all the Saints, it may gaze upon
Him in the bliss of Heaven, love Him perfectly and find its blessedness in Him
throughout eternity. Amen.
