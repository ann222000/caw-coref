&gt; I hope your right Ben. Both teams have struggled to score this season,
&gt; so I reckon there will be nothing in it.

They are always close encounters. Last year it ended 1-1 at Old
Trafford and 0-0 at Stamford Bridge. It took extra-time to seperate
them in last season's FA Cup Final. Chelsea will miss the presence of
both Frank Lampard and Didier Drogba and of course Jose Mourinho. They
have had poor results in recent weeks (Villa defeat, Blackburn &amp;
Rosenborg draw) and United have four 1-0 victories (Spurs, Sunderland,
Everton, Sporting Lisbon) on the trot. So i expect United to come out
on top. What is your prediction?

&gt; Although I hate to say it, I think it will either be a nil all draw or
&gt; a low score draw. However I do feel that Man U are in the best
&gt; position to win. It will be interesting to see if Rooney starts or
&gt; Tevez. Can't see them both together at the start. I also think it is a
&gt; matter of time before Tevez finds form. He doesn't seem to be the
&gt; luckiest player going around.- Hide quoted text -

I agree with you about Tevez. It was the same story for him when he
was at West Ham. Then he finally got his first Premiership goal for
the Hammers against Tottenham Hotspur @ Upton Park. Gary Neville is
still injured but should return from injury within a week or so. I
think he will struggle to regain his England place from Micah
Richards.  Owen Hargreaves will also miss out today's game through
injury.

Finally a little stat... Victory in Avram Grant's first match in
charge, would also be Chelsea's 1,500th league win in their history.

It's good to see your prediction for this game was spot on, because usually

Forget about that Tommo, we all know you were an onion bag tormenting

Say a game will be 0-0, 1-0. 1-1. 2-1, 2-0, or 2-2. More thimes than not you
will be correct. We call it &quot;monkeys and typewriters&quot; syndrome.

The Football Association have charged Chelsea for failing to control
their players at Man Utd and assistant boss Steve Clarke for abusive
language.

Chelsea and Clarke have until 12th October 2007 to respond to the
