As I wrapped up the recording of the Dice Tower, episode # 85, I
reflected on the topic for the show - the myriad of games based on
Klaus Teuber's fictional universe of Catan, begun by his immensely
popular game Settlers of Catan.  With over thirty variants,
expansions, and versions, Catan has become something of a phenomenon
in the boardgaming world.  This has led some to an apathetic attitude
towards the introduction of any new Catan game - including the new
Struggle for Rome (Mayfair Games, 2007 - Klaus Teuber), the latest
version in the "Catan Histories" series of games.  A cursory glance at
the board reveals that it looks very similar to the original game,
albeit in the shape of a map of Europe.

But really, the gameplay, while retaining some of the basics of Catan
mechanics, has a completely different feel - quickly becoming a
favorite of mine.  With a de-emphasis on trading and a heightened
sense of exploration and war - the theme certainly fits the
mechanics.  Players control a tribe of northern raiders during the
demise of the Western Roman Empire (Huns, Visigoths, etc.), and roam
across Europe, plundering cities until they finally settle down and
begin a civilization.  I found this to be an excellent backdrop, and
games remain tense and interesting until the end.  Struggle for Rome
is the next natural step in the Catan game progression, forming an
excellent game in its own right.

Each player has two boxes on their side of the board - one
representing their horsemen army, and the other their warrior army.  A
supply wagon and a warrior/horseman are placed in each - with another
warrior and horsemen placed in starting spots on the board.  Players
place the rest of their warriors, horsemen, and supply wagons in a
reserve spot in front of them, as well as a reference card.  There are
four different types of resource cards in the game, and the grain and
ore cards are placed in face up piles next to a face down pile
(pasture cards) that consists of a shuffling of the horse and cattle
cards.  Some victory point cards are placed face up near the board
(Diplomacy, Scourge of Rome, and Heir of Rome), as well as a stack of
shuffled development cards.  Four white markers are placed in a
compass on the board that shows the eleven numerical combinations with
two dice, and a legionnaire piece is placed on a forest space in
Spain.  A pile of gold is placed on the table, with each player
receiving five gold, one random pasture card, and one grain card to
start the game.  Several cities are scattered throughout the board,
separated into five different color groups.  Plunder counters are
shuffled and placed face down on each of these cities.  Dice are
rolled, and the player who rolls best begins the first round.

The first part of each round consists of resource accumulation.  The
starting player rolls the dice four times; and if a player has a piece
that is at the junction of a hexagon that has that number on it, they
receive one resource card of that type (pasture hexes allow a player
to draw the top card from the pasture pile).  Once a number is rolled,
a white marker is placed on that number, which prevents it from being
rolled again this round.  If a player rolls a "7", they move the
legionnaire to any hex, canceling that number for future rolls as long
as the legionnaire stays there.  The player may also steal a random
resource (or two gold coins if the player has no resource) from a
player who has a piece bordering that hex.

Starting with the first player, players may then freely trade their
coins and resources, and then build.  When trading, a player may trade
three identical resources to the bank for one card of their choice.
Players may also use three gold coins in place of any resource card
ONCE during their build phase.  The three things a player may build
are:
-       Development card:  The player discards one gold and one cattle card
to take the top development card into their hand.
-       Supply wagon:  The player discards one grain, one horse, and one
cattle card to place a wagon into either tribe box.
-       Warrior/horseman:  The player discards one ore and one horse to
place a warrior in their warrior box, and a horseman into their
horseman box.

After this, starting with the first player, players may move their
horseman tribe and take an action.  Following this, players do the
same thing with their warrior tribes.  Instead of moving a tribe,
players may elect to do nothing and take two gold from the bank, or a
resource of their choice.  When moving tribes, players move them along
the borders of hexes as far as they want, or crossing sea paths.  All
over the board and sea paths there are arrows, and a tribe may cross
ONE of them for free.  Additional arrows crossed over on a move cost
one gold per additional sea arrow, and three gold or one grain per
land arrow.

After movement, if a tribe is adjacent to an unplundered city, they
may plunder it IF the amount of warrior/horsemen figures in the
matching box is equal to the number of towers surrounding the city
(two to five).  When a tribe plunders a city, the plunder marker is
flipped over.  If it shows a red area, the plundering player must
remove one horseman/warrior figure from the attacking armies box.
Then, the player receives the reward, which always includes one gold
coin per supply wagon in the plundering army, and may also include a
development card, a pasture card, or more gold.  The plunder marker is
then placed in the matching tribes' box.  If a tribe plunders a city
from each of the five colors, they receive the "Scourge of Rome" card,
which is worth two victory points.  Each tribe may plunder a maximum
of two cities of the same color.

Once a tribe has plundered cities of three different colors, they may
conquer a city instead of plundering it - even if the city no longer
has a plunder token on it.  When a player decides to do this, they
place the moving figure into the city along with a supply wagon from
the tribe's box.  From now on, this tribe will no longer move but will
still generate resources from rolls.  On future turns, the player can
conquer any city within one arrow, discarding one warrior/horseman and
placing another supply wagon in the city.  This grows a player's
empire, giving them more resources, along with one victory point per
city.  When a player conquers four cities with each of their tribes,
they receive the Heir to Rome card, which is worth two victory points.

One development card can be played during the building phase and each
movement phase, for a maximum of three per turn.  Most development
cards are Diplomats, which allow a player to move the Roman
legionnaire, following the rules outlined above.  Once a player plays
three Diplomat cards, they receive the Diplomacy card, which is worth
two victory points.  Another player who plays more Diplomat cards can
take this card from them, along with the points!  Other development
cards give the player more gold, allow them to attack cities with more
towers, move their tribe farther, etc.  Three of them are worth a
victory point and do not have to be revealed until the end of the
game.

As soon as one player reaches ten victory points (automatic if any
player has gotten an Heir to Rome card), the round is played to
conclusion, then points are calculated - one point for each city; and
points for the victory point cards and development cards.  The player
with the most points is the winner, with ties going to the player with
the most gold.

Some comments on the game...

1.)     Components:  "High quality" are certainly the first words that
come to mind when looking at this game - it's an amazing thing when
set up.  The board is a decent representation of Europe, using hexes
of four types (forests are on the board - although they produce no
resources).  The cities are scattered around, and the arrows and
numbers are clearly visible.  The cards are small - just like the
original game, and of good quality.  The plastic pieces reminded me
somewhat of those in Domain - even being of similar colors.  The
plunder tokens are cardboard hexagon tokens that easily show what loot
the plunderers receive.  What impressed me most about the game,
however, were the coins.  The plastic coins look rather realistic - as
if they came out of a poor mold, giving them an authentic feel.
Everything fits in a nice plastic insert inside a beautiful, large
square box.  Mayfair games continue to get nicer and nicer, as
evidenced by this game.

2.)     Rules:  The rulebook has six full colored pages with a ton of
illustrations, doing a fantastic job of explaining the rules.  Someone
who hasn't played Catan before will easily be able to play - while
there are a few references pointing out the major differences.
Teaching the game isn't that difficult, though players usually take a
game or so to formulate a strategy - as it's a little open-ended in
the beginning.  I was able teach the game to people who had never
touched any Catan game, while those who have played Settlers made the
switch fairly easily.  While not up at the time of the writing of this
review, there should also be an online tutorial at www.profeasy.com ,
which - if it's like the ones for the other game - should be a nice
introduction on how to play the game.

3.)     Settlers:  The whole concept of the game is different than the
basic Settlers of Catan, but here's a rundown of the major
differences.  The resource rolling is a nice change, as it forces four
different numbers to be rolled each round.  Yes, you can still get
hosed by luck, but it happens a lot less frequently.  The idea of
movement is certainly different than the basic game, as well as the
random pasture pile.  Players no longer have to discard half their
hand on a "7", but I think this was discarded simply because there is
really no point to hoarding cards - players usually had very few in
their hand.  The board is certainly much larger than a typical Catan
board, with forty-seven numbered hexes, and even more intersections
between them.  Blocking is a bit harder to do - although still
certainly a more viable strategy.  There is a lot less trading in the
game; because while it still occurs, players usually don't have a
surplus of resources they don't need.  The game has a "tighter"
feeling, as you grasp for every resource.

4.)     Resources:  The game has five resources: Grain, Ore, Cattle,
Horses, and money.  What's interesting is how each of them has their
own use - especially money.  Players who tend to ignore money will
regret it later on, especially as it wins the game in a tie -
something that is not exactly uncommon.  At first horses seem to be
the most valuable, because without a large army, conquering can be
difficult.  But I would submit that cattle and wheat are just as
important, as a player with an excess of wheat can really pull of some
nice maneuvering.  I enjoy the randomness of the pasture deck and
adjust my strategies, depending on what I get.  The only thing that
Settlers has over this game is that trading here is rarely done.
Since players take their actions in order, and usually spend almost
all of their resources, why trade with someone if it only benefits
them?  Trading happens, but on a much less frequent basis.

5.)     Movement:  I really enjoy how movement has been added to the basic
Settlers game.  No longer do players simply try to get in the best
position - they now must weigh that against attacking a city.  Almost
every city or attack point is in a bad place, resource-wise.  If a
player wants to get a good selection of resources, they must go to
places that aren't really adjacent to many cities; and this can cause
them to fall behind in the race to win.  The arrow mechanic is also a
stroke of genius and allows players to quickly determine where they
can move - with thankfully no arguments.

6.)     Race:  Like other games, Struggle for Rome is more of a race than
anything else.  Players must gauge the best time to stop plundering
and settle down.  Those who plunder a city of each type will receive
an extra two points - certainly nothing to scoff at, but can also fall
behind in the race to build a civilization.  Every game that I've
played has come down to the wire when playing - with scores close or
tied (with money).  Players can attempt to finish the game quickly by
settling down but take the chance of another player scoring more
points through other means.  The game starts off a bit slowly but
gains momentum, as it continues; and the end is a real nail-biter, as
many players reach ten points on the same turn or within a turn.

7.)     Fun Factor:  For me, the enjoyment of the game comes from the
theme, which really fits well, and the general movement and
exploration feel.  Players are attacking cities, and must maneuver
their tribes, trying to find an ideal place to settle in, at just the
right time.  Those who wait a little longer might get more victory
points, or more gold from looting cities; but waiting too long can
mean the best spots for a civilization are missing.  This certainly is
longer than a Settlers game, taking about ninety minutes; but it's an
engrossing, enjoyable time.

Don't let anyone tell you that Struggle for Rome is a Settlers clone -
it's most certainly not, and while it retains some basic Catan
characteristics, it has it's own flavor and feel.  It's one of my
favorites of the series, due to the historical backdrop and the "race"
like feel of the game.   A meatier game than the basic Settlers of
Catan, it still manages to be fairly easy to teach and learn, making
it a nice "game after the gateway" game.
