I have a Deskjet 940c which has been working well for
the past 9 months with me refilling the carts when needed.
Two weeks ago the black ran out whilst printing text, so I
refilled as per usual. Then (as with Andrew 1234 a few days
ago) the black cart indicator light started flashing and has
done so for the past fortnight.

I read with interest the whole of Andrew's post below
and tried all the tips written there with no avail. No matter
what I do the bl.y thing goes on flashing!

I'll be very grateful for any ideas that might fix it.

John.

The cartrdige has probably failed.
Make sure you clean the contacts on both cartridges and the ones they mate with
in the printer.
When you open the top door, the carriage should move to the left, there is an
arrow on the top of the carriage and it should point to a frowning face. 3 dots
means the colour cartridge and 1 dot means the black one has failed.
Cartridges do fail, they were never designed to be refilled many times.

You may have read from one of the links provided by Bob Headrick

http://groups.google.com/group/comp.periphs.printers/browse_thread/th...

that the contacts on the gold foil of the cartridge and the cartridge
carrier may become whitish with crystalized contact lubricant. (That
wasn't my problem, though).

I looked closely at the black ink cartridge that failed for me, and it
seemed to be slightly darker than shiny copper. Following a
recommendation, I used a pencil eraser to rub the foil contacts on the
ink cartridge (carefully remove any rubber particles with a soft
cloth) and it seemed to rub off the dark haze. I don't know if this
&quot;worked&quot; because this is not now a cartridge that I am using.

This recommendation went on to use the eraser, if necessary, to clean
the contacts in the cartridge carrier. I haven't tried this. If I did
try it, I would be very careful to not bend the little contact points
in the carrier.

Those #45 black carts have a way of turning bad all of a sudden. They
can't be refilled forever. I had a couple of them quit early when I
refilled them with generic dye based ink instead of pigmented. Maybe
there was some incompatibility with the ink you were using.

If you replaced the correct (failing) cartridge then there is a possibility
that the printer has failed but this particular failure is extremely rare.
Cleaning the contacts in the printer is well worth a try but do it for both
cartridges. It is impossible for the ink to cause this problem, the printer and
the printhead in the cartridge have no way to know what ink is present.
Have you tried replacing both cartridges? Some models can get confused about
which cartridge has failed.

Try a hard reset.
Turn on printer power.
Open printer cover, remove both cartridges, close clamps and cover.
Unplug power cord from printer.
Wait 30 seconds.
Plug power cord back into printer.
Open top cover and reinsert both cartridges.
Turn on printer power.

Ever heard of dielectric Si grease? I got a Canon dSLR off a guy who
claimed it just quit all of sudden and it won't do anything for almost
free. The problem was battery was not making a good contacst within the
compartment. Rest is history. I got a good caemra for next to nothing.
I resold it for big profit, LOL! No, I gave it to my daughter. You can
buy special cleaning fabric or liquid gold(to revive contacts) from
electronics parts store or guitar shop where service dept. is.

Yeah. But using dielectric Si grease as an adhesive for contact strips?

No, it needs a lubricant that does not interfere with the conductivity, not
a glue.  As the cartrdige is slid into the carriage there is a metal to
metal sliding action.  If you use alcohol or other solvents to remove all
lubricants from the pads and pogo pins in the printer you would risk
damaging the pads or the pogo pins when the cartrdige is installed. It may
not happen with the first insertion but over the life of the printer would
cause problems.  I have seen this happen, both in damaging cartridges as
well as printers before the lube process was added to the manufacturing for
the #41 and #45 cartrdiges.

See above, you do not want the contacts to be squeaky clean.  You also do

Thanks for clearing this up, Bob.
My initial problem was caused by the following statement:
&quot;...uses a lubricant coating to attach the electrical contacts...&quot;
In other words, a glue that's a lubricant. Dunno -- when I do
documentation, stuff like this generates a question, as in: &quot;Wha???????&quot;
Voodoo. It would never get by me.
In my world, a lubricant coating would typically cause the contacts to
fall off. I'd need someone to explain this in order to believe it.

This is like anti-glare coatings on monitors, in which the manufacturer
says to clean the tube face with a dry cloth or maybe some water. So, I
ask what they recommend -- they say a dry cloth. So I ask what they use
to clean the screen at the factory, and then I get an answer like &quot;Windex.&quot;

Well, last week I attempted to remove the anti-glare coating on a
Trinitron screen. I worked like hell with a green pot scrubber, then
switched in desperation to the black one -- the kind that you use to
scrub concrete and barbeue grills. Finally, with this, strong alcohol,
and a lot of sweat, I managed to get one small patch down to bare glass.

Or then there was the time I tried to demagnetize a floppy disk on
purpose; I wanted to kill the format pattern. So, I put the disk on a
power transformer and turned on the juice. It didn't work. I couldn't
erase the disk. Maybe I should have soaked it in Southern Comfort...

Thanks for your explanation. I'll select a good contact preservative
(cleaner-lubricant)from my workbench and do my HP cartridges and -- what
did you call them -- &quot;pogo pins?&quot; (What = &quot;pogo&quot; and why?  The plot
thickens.)

&gt;&gt; John.

&gt; Try a hard reset.
&gt; Turn on printer power.
&gt; Open printer cover, remove both cartridges, close clamps and cover.
&gt; Unplug power cord from printer.
&gt; Wait 30 seconds.
&gt; Plug power cord back into printer.
&gt; Open top cover and reinsert both cartridges.
&gt; Turn on printer power.

Just done all that again, probably for the tenth time.. Still it flashes.
Last try - Hose it down in the garden then buy a new one.
Thanks a lot. John.

&gt; Those #45 black carts have a way of turning bad all of a sudden. They
&gt; can't be refilled forever. I had a couple of them quit early when I
&gt; refilled them with generic dye based ink instead of pigmented. Maybe

They are called pogo pins because the contacts in the printer are made of a
three piece telescoping gold sleeve, gold spring and plunger, something like
a miniature pogo stick. This entire discussion applies to the cartridges and
printers in the DeskJet 700, 800 and 900 series.  Earlier and later printers
use a series of raised bumps on the printer side and do not use contact
lubrication.

Do not use much lube - it should be barely detectible on the pads.  More
could cause the cartridge pads to collect dust or paper fibers which can
also cause interconnect issues.

This sounds like a bad (and unnecessary) idea.  For starters, turn on the
printer then open the lid.  The carriage will move to one of five locations
indicating that either the cartrdiges are OK, black or color are low on ink
or black or color are electrically defective.  If the cartrdige light is
flashing and the printer will not print then either the black or color
cartridge is bad, you can see which one has failed by looking at the icon
the carriage pointer lines up with.  See:
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?lc=en&amp;cc;=us&amp;dlc;=en...

If one of the cartrdige is indicated as the problem then replace that
cartridge.

If the indicator lines up with the smiley face then the blinking light is
indicating something else, see
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/genericDocument?docname=bpd09630&amp;c...;
as there are issues other than cartridge issues that can be indicated by a
blinking light.

Thanks Bob,
It has always indicated on the black cart, but after
having
done all the cleaning of pins inside and out and fitting 2 new carts BW,
changed the Col cart, done all the start ups removing power etc,Oh and
changing the driver. I think I'll give up now.
It owes me nothing, it's been printing pics and stuff every day for about
9 months and for this one I only gave £4 on the local market, I have had
4 similar DeskJet's over the past 5 - 6 years all performed well.
It's always been a bit of a fight with them when you refill your own carts
but well worth it.

I'm not sure, but I think the wording HP used may be the problem.  I
think what they mean is that they use a conductive lubricant to
&quot;connect&quot; (rather than attach) the contacts in the printer itself, to
the pad contacts on the cartridge.  In other words, the lubricant
bridges the connection between the contact within the printer carriage
area and the contact pads on the printer cartridge.  Not that the
cartridge pads are &quot;attached&quot; to the cartridge via the lubricant.

Then Bob's explanation makes more sense.  They use a lubricant on the
surface of the cartridge pad to allow the pads to slide on the printer
contact point so they don't damage one another during this installation
process.  The lubricant should be conductive to avoid poor conductivity
between the two points, but sometimes the lubricant develops crystals
which may prevent proper conductivity.

At least that's how I read it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The eventual link to HP says,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Ink manufacturing uses a lubricant coating to attach the electrical
&gt;&gt;&gt; contacts on the cartridges.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wha?????????
&gt;&gt;&gt; A lubricant as a glue??? (Was this writer passing a brain stone?)

&gt;&gt; No, it needs a lubricant that does not interfere with the
&gt;&gt; conductivity, not a glue.  As the cartrdige is slid into the carriage
&gt;&gt; there is a metal to metal sliding action.  If you use alcohol or other
&gt;&gt; solvents to remove all lubricants from the pads and pogo pins in the
&gt;&gt; printer you would risk damaging the pads or the pogo pins when the
&gt;&gt; cartrdige is installed. It may not happen with the first insertion but
&gt;&gt; over the life of the printer would cause problems.  I have seen this
&gt;&gt; happen, both in damaging cartridges as well as printers before the
&gt;&gt; lube process was added to the manufacturing for the #41 and #45
&gt;&gt; cartrdiges.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;HP has discovered that in a small number of cases, the lubricant may
&gt;&gt;&gt; form a crystalline material that blocks electrical impulses between
&gt;&gt;&gt; the cartridge contacts and the contacts of the cradle inside the
&gt;&gt;&gt; printing unit.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmm. I've never seen any contact preparation that forms a
&gt;&gt;&gt; crystalline residue.

&gt;&gt; Just because you have not seen it does not mean it does not happen.

&gt;&gt;&gt; However, I'm puzzled that printer manufacturers do not recommend the
&gt;&gt;&gt; use of trusted liquids like alcohols to clean crud off these
&gt;&gt;&gt; contacts. And I never even see them recommend the use of the trusted
&gt;&gt;&gt; contact cleaning fluids and cleaner/lubricants that are probably the
&gt;&gt;&gt; most frequently-used tools in electronics repair shops. But printer
&gt;&gt;&gt; makers recommend &quot;clean cloths&quot; and &quot;water.&quot; I've never seen any
&gt;&gt;&gt; technician in my life do this. What gives?

&gt;&gt; See above, you do not want the contacts to be squeaky clean.  You also
&gt;&gt; do not want to recommend paper that may leave fibers on the contacts.
&gt;&gt; There are lots of system issues that would not be obvious to a casual
&gt;&gt; observer.

&gt;&gt; - Bob Headrick, MS MVP Printing/Imaging

&gt; Thanks for clearing this up, Bob.
&gt; My initial problem was caused by the following statement:
&gt; &quot;...uses a lubricant coating to attach the electrical contacts...&quot;
&gt; In other words, a glue that's a lubricant. Dunno -- when I do
&gt; documentation, stuff like this generates a question, as in: &quot;Wha???????&quot;
&gt;  Voodoo. It would never get by me.
&gt; In my world, a lubricant coating would typically cause the contacts to
&gt; fall off. I'd need someone to explain this in order to believe it.

&gt; This is like anti-glare coatings on monitors, in which the manufacturer
&gt; says to clean the tube face with a dry cloth or maybe some water. So, I
&gt; ask what they recommend -- they say a dry cloth. So I ask what they use
&gt; to clean the screen at the factory, and then I get an answer like &quot;Windex.&quot;

&gt; Well, last week I attempted to remove the anti-glare coating on a
&gt; Trinitron screen. I worked like hell with a green pot scrubber, then
&gt; switched in desperation to the black one -- the kind that you use to
&gt; scrub concrete and barbeue grills. Finally, with this, strong alcohol,
&gt; and a lot of sweat, I managed to get one small patch down to bare glass.

&gt; Or then there was the time I tried to demagnetize a floppy disk on
&gt; purpose; I wanted to kill the format pattern. So, I put the disk on a
&gt; power transformer and turned on the juice. It didn't work. I couldn't
&gt; erase the disk. Maybe I should have soaked it in Southern Comfort...

&gt; Thanks for your explanation. I'll select a good contact preservative
&gt; (cleaner-lubricant)from my workbench and do my HP cartridges and -- what
&gt; did you call them -- &quot;pogo pins?&quot; (What = &quot;pogo&quot; and why?  The plot
&gt; thickens.)

Let me give a logical guess.
1. The contact strips are attached with a suitable adhesive, maybe an
industrial-grade cyanoacrylic.

2. In electronics work, the word &quot;lubricant&quot; has been used with
compounded contact cleaning fluids as somewhat of a catchall. This is a
bit complicated. I'll try:

- Plain contact cleaner is typically an inert liquid that evaporates
quickly. It used to be a freon, and now other liquids are used instead.

- Clasic cleaner-lubricants were freon plus a silicone fluid. The
carrier would evaporate, leaving a silicone film behind. Silicone
liquids are great lubricants for all substances and interfaces except
metal-to-metal, in which the metal texture pushes through the liquid.
This makes it ideal for a contact preparation because the silicone forms
a vapor barrier on the contacts, preventing oxidation. This also gives
the contact surfaces excellent conductivity when they connect with each
other. Silicone fluids are great for this purpose, also, because unlike
petroleum products, they do not attract dirt! And unlike petroleum
products, silicone fluid does not attack any plastics that I know of. If
I were HP, I'd probably want to use this for inkjet cartridges and
internal contacts myself. Silicone and petroleum liquids don't mix, and
probably form crystalline-like substances.

- Other non-silicone preparations are also used as contact preparations,
with and without carriers. These are usually petroleum distillates with
or without other chemicals. At least a couple of these have been revered
by technicians; one swore to me about a wonderful liquid, about which he
stressed that it should never be applied more than the most minimal
film. Hmmmmm.

What do you think, Bob?

&gt; &gt; the pad contacts on the cartridge.

&gt; Let me give a logical guess.
&gt; 1. The contact strips are attached with a suitable adhesive, maybe an
&gt; industrial-grade cyanoacrylic.

&gt; 2. In electronics work, the word &quot;lubricant&quot; has been used with
&gt; compounded contact cleaning fluids as somewhat of a catchall. This is a
&gt; bit complicated. I'll try:

&gt; - Plaincontact cleaneris typically an inert liquid that evaporates
&gt; quickly. It used to be a freon, and now other liquids are used instead.

&gt; - Clasic cleaner-lubricants were freon plus a silicone fluid. The
&gt; carrier would evaporate, leaving a silicone film behind. Silicone
&gt; liquids are great lubricants for all substances and interfaces except
&gt; metal-to-metal, in which the metal texture pushes through the liquid.
&gt; This makes it ideal for a contact preparation because the silicone forms
&gt; a vapor barrier on the contacts, preventing oxidation. This also gives
&gt; the contact surfaces excellent conductivity when they connect with each
&gt; other. Silicone fluids are great for this purpose, also, because unlike
&gt; petroleum products, they do not attract dirt! And unlike petroleum
&gt; products, silicone fluid does not attack any plastics that I know of. If
&gt; I were HP, I'd probably want to use this for inkjet cartridges and
&gt; internal contacts myself. Silicone and petroleum liquids don't mix, and
&gt; probably form crystalline-like substances.

&gt; - Other non-silicone preparations are also used as contact preparations,
&gt; with and without carriers. These are usually petroleum distillates with
&gt; or without other chemicals. At least a couple of these have been revered
&gt; by technicians; one swore to me about a wonderful liquid, about which he
&gt; stressed that it should never be applied more than the most minimal
&gt; film. Hmmmmm.

&gt; What do you think, Bob?

Yup. A lot of people love DeoxIT (in electronics work, restoration of
antique gear, etc.).

I'll assume that it's great for the print cartridge contacts, but do you
know for sure that it's good for this particular application?

Thanks.

My brother who is an EE, swears by Mobil 1 synthetic oil.  He says it
prevents oxidation, and allows for very good metal to metal contact
while both lubricating and keeping the contacts clean, and it is very
inexpensive, and it doesn't seem to damage plastics over time as some
lubricants do.  A bottle will be a lifetime purchase.

Yes I would think so.  Have used it on just about every computer
connection and works everytime. Video cards are very susceptible to
intermittents.  Many of our office video cards need a wipe of DeoxIT
GOLD every so often to rejuvenate the connection.  Bad video card
connections are our most common issues.  They have great wipes for
these. Link: http://store.caig.com/s.nl/it.A/id.2407/.f?sc=2&amp;category;=292

That's quite interesting. I never thought of that. Electronics sprays
are a lot lighter than that. I'd be afraid of trying this with a
potentiometer.

A quart bottle of Mobil 1 would last probably 10 lifetimes in this
application. Further, the cost would be minimal, as opposed to the
electronics cleaners and cleaner/preservatives, which have risen in
price beyond the usual inflation to where they're priced like, well: ink!

Caig's products (De-oxIT) are priced like, well: OEM ink for a $35 printer.

I was an early user of Mobil 1 and respect the product (at least, if
through viscosity changes and The Big Merger with Exxon, it's actually
the same as it used to be). The one thing that I'm wondering about is
whether it attracts and holds dust the way that my familiar electronics
products don't. I don't understand why it would allow good metal-metal
contact when its primary purpose is to prevent metal-to-metal contact.
This baffles me. I'm not saying that he's wrong, just that I don't
understand this.

I'm interested in what he says about that.

I do not know the adhesive details, but they are generally heat staked in

The &quot;lubricant&quot; for the pads is to prevent the clean gold on the pads and
the pogo pins from welding themselves together when the cartridge is
installed into the printer.  When this happens it can cause tearing of the
pads (destroying the cartridge) or bending the pogo pins (damaging the
printer).  The amount of lube needed to prevent this is very small.  If you
take your finger, rub your forehead once and then rub it on clean
interconnect pads you have about the right amount :-).

I don't know what deoxIT sells for, but Mobil 1 synthetic oil seems to
have similar qualities and is pretty inexpensive.

There used to be a product called &quot;ElectroLube&quot; on the market years ago.
It seems to be a gift from the electronic gods as a contact cleaner.
It coated the contacts with some form of silver.

Well, a year or so later, the damage reports started coming in.  It
caused many plastics to become brittle and crack or craze, and the
silver began to corrode badly.  It was ultimately a disaster.

All fluids improve connection, at least temporarily. Stabilant is the
fluid that actually conducts.
Silicones are problematic with contacts. It can form hard insulation
with arching.

Lubrication will provide better metal to metal contact , unless its
traveling 60 MPH. Much like using water on a wet stone, the lube helps
to
push corrosion and other particles out of the way so metal to metal
contact improves.
I might try some Mobile 1. My lube of choice right now is CRC 2-26.
The Home Depot was selling this dirt cheap a while back. It says right
on the can, improves
electrical properties.
