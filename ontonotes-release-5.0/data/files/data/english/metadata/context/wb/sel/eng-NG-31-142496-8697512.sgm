Good Friday Morning!!!!!
Thank you James!!!!...I will check your site out.
I've also created a site which is a home where one can express freely
their own experiences with those *MYSTICS&lt; GURU&quot;S&lt;SO CALLED TEACHERS
OF THE COURSE* who would misrepresent themselves and would feed upon
the hearts and minds of those who are on their journey.
There is alot of these *so called spiritual teachers* who are using
the book as nothing more than a shield as they go about controling the
minds of those that are seeking the truth for themselves.
Please join....lets not turn a deaf ear and a blind eye. Extend the
hand to your sisters and brothers, don't allow this to continue.
It's becoming a 99cent version of misrepresentation, of moderation of
anyone who would bring forth the truth. Being the same is not throwing
a blanket over everything and waiting for something to crawl out. This
is about extending the truth, its not about training the mind not to
see.
This is well known in the community, and for reasons of power and
control is swept under the carpet. Isn't anyone willing to come
forward??? Don't allow your selfs to be taught and controlled by those
that do not have your best interests. This is about you, your journey,
this is a individual study. Not meant to have *so called, Mystics,
Master Teachers, or Special Teachers. There is abuse going on in these
communities, its known...
Please open your minds, open your hearts, be in your stillness and
listen to the voice inside. We are met where we are.
Come join..lets keep this open...please do not allow those that feed
upon your fear,to keep it alive to profit.
Turning a deaf ear and a blind eye is not loving.
Lets join together in our love for each other, so that we bring it
into light, no more closing the doors.
Thank you, Peace be with US All.
Love We Are

The &quot;truth&quot; is not &quot;innocent victim abused by evil villain.&quot;

That is a &quot;story.&quot;  The &quot;truth&quot; is that nothing happens to the Son of God
without his consent!  We are each responsible for our experience.

No one can be a &quot;guru&quot; or &quot;celebrity&quot; without there being crowds who seek
and MAKE him into their &quot;Guru.&quot;  It's a two-way street.  If there were no
demand for illicit drugs, there'd be no illicit drug trade.  If there were
no demand for &quot;pay-as-you-go-sex&quot; there'd be no prostitutes.

Supplier and consumer are a &quot;team&quot; and are jointly responsible for their
interaction.

This is not 'blame the victim' but it is the recognition that there &quot;are no
victims!&quot;  There is NO ONE TO BLAME.  There is no guilt.  Haven't you read
ACIM?

The whole idea of guilt, the whole idea of villainy, the whole idea of
victimhood, the whole idea of sacrifice, these are all &quot;illusions&quot; or if you
will &quot;stories&quot; we make up to project our own guilt feelings onto others.
It's all a mechanism of psychological denial of truth.

So whenever anyone tells you the &quot;truth&quot; is that so-and-so is a sonofabitch
evil villain preying on innocent, helpless, small furry animal victims, you
KNOW if  you understand ACIM, that person feels deeply guilty about
something, is in denial, and is projecting that guilt onto someone who seems
&quot;external&quot; to him or her.

The &quot;story&quot; of persecutions, victims and villains is not &quot;truth&quot; though
admittedly, to the ego it may well seem to be true.  The &quot;truth&quot; is that
there are no victims and there are no villains and every transaction between
consenting adults has at least TWO people who are FULLY responsible.

No guru abuses me.  I wouldn't consider giving one the chance!  If you
choose to walk on thin ice and play hockey with a 'guru' then YOU are
responsible, as much as anyone, for what comes next.  And if you are an
adult it is wholly unreasonable not to accept your own responsibility for
your experience.

This is not to say there aren't people in the world who abuse others.  This
is not to condone or underplay the hurtful and harmful.  This is to say that
wherever no one is using chains or putting a gun to your head, if you're an
adult, you've got some responsibility to be careful about who to believe,
what stories to accept, and what extreme metaphysical claims to accept.

We DO &quot;attract&quot; to ourselves the kind of experiences we NEED for our own
spiritual growth.  Some people need the experience of being &quot;sucked in&quot; by a
guru to learn an important lesson.  I did.  In my young and foolish years I
was sucked in by one.  But I was a very eager, willing 'victim' and what I
learned was to trust my own inner guidance and realize that no &quot;external&quot;
force or authority could replace it.

I needed to learn that and a &quot;guru&quot; came along to teach me.  Everyone who
THINKS he needs a guru has, I suspect, a similar kind of spiritual learning
need.

Wherever you find dissent being squelched, fear being used to manipulate
people, and a lot of talk of villains and enemies and threats and dangers,
you KNOW you're not dealing with the Holy Spirit because that is not the
Holy Spirit's approach.  Whoever is ATTRACTED to that kind of approach has
to learn truth from falsehood and one way to do it is to have your face
rubbed in falsehood.

If you emerge with &quot;victim consciousness&quot; and feel the &quot;villains have done
you in&quot; then you haven't learned the lesson.  Return to Go, do not collect
$200.  Start again until you figure out that YOU are responsible for YOUR
experience!

You will have similar experiences until you learn to forgive.

That does not mean you are responsible for everything that happens.  That
means you are responsible for how you respond to it, and whether to &quot;attack&quot;
what you judge negatively or &quot;forgive.&quot;  When you &quot;FORGIVE&quot; you &quot;advance to
Go, collect $200.&quot;  When you don't, your own negative judgements will
continue to attract to you precisely what you judge most negatively!

THAT is the &quot;truth&quot; of the matter!

All the best,

Doug

Very well said Doug.
It is a funny little dream, and very easy to feel seperate from it...,
making it easy to point our finger... forgetting that our very judgment is
upon ourselves.
Forgiveness...., care..., ... loving concern for all we see is truly the
path to Wholeness :)
In appreciation of your expressions,
Jim

&gt; &quot;attack&quot; what you judge negatively or &quot;forgive.&quot;  When you &quot;FORGIVE&quot; you
&gt; &quot;advance to Go, collect $200.&quot;  When you don't, your own negative
&gt; judgements will continue to attract to you precisely what you judge most
&gt; negatively!

&gt; THAT is the &quot;truth&quot; of the matter!

&gt; All the best,

&gt; &gt; Did it ever occur to you that if you don't wish to deal with the BS
&gt; &gt; associated with gurus, teachers and groups, just not join one?

Well I imagine its like joining a swinger club then complaining that
all the people you meet are making sexual advances. What did think was
going to happen and what did they think they were going to find. An

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; There is alot of these *so called spiritual teachers* who are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; using

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It's becoming a 99cent version of misrepresentation, of moderation

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi DJ

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Did it ever occur to you that if you don't wish to deal with the BS
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; associated with gurus, teachers and groups, just not join one?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Well I imagine its like joining a swinger club then complaining that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; all the people you meet are making sexual advances. What did think was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; going to happen and what did they think they were going to find. An
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ego-less guru?

If Bill wants to discuss something with you I imagine he will.

I don't wish to discuss anything with you, so why the hell are you

doug:You will have similar experiences until you learn to forgive.

sv: yes, ACIM in a nutshell. ;)   All things are lessons God would have me
learn....the *central* lesson in *every* experience is that: when I forgive,
I *will* see this differently. sheryl

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The &quot;truth&quot; is not &quot;innocent victim abused by evil villain.&quot;

&gt; That is a &quot;story.&quot;  The &quot;truth&quot; is that nothing happens to the Son of God
&gt; without his consent!  We are each responsible for our experience.

&gt; No one can be a &quot;guru&quot; or &quot;celebrity&quot; without there being crowds who seek
&gt; and MAKE him into their &quot;Guru.&quot;  It's a two-way street.  If there were no
&gt; demand for illicit drugs, there'd be no illicit drug trade.  If there were
&gt; no demand for &quot;pay-as-you-go-sex&quot; there'd be no prostitutes.

&gt; Supplier and consumer are a &quot;team&quot; and are jointly responsible for their
&gt; interaction.

&gt; This is not 'blame the victim' but it is the recognition that there &quot;are
&gt; no victims!&quot;  There is NO ONE TO BLAME.  There is no guilt.  Haven't you
&gt; read ACIM?

&gt; The whole idea of guilt, the whole idea of villainy, the whole idea of
&gt; victimhood, the whole idea of sacrifice, these are all &quot;illusions&quot; or if
&gt; you will &quot;stories&quot; we make up to project our own guilt feelings onto
&gt; others. It's all a mechanism of psychological denial of truth.

&gt; So whenever anyone tells you the &quot;truth&quot; is that so-and-so is a
&gt; sonofabitch evil villain preying on innocent, helpless, small furry animal
&gt; victims, you KNOW if  you understand ACIM, that person feels deeply guilty
&gt; about something, is in denial, and is projecting that guilt onto someone
&gt; who seems &quot;external&quot; to him or her.

&gt; The &quot;story&quot; of persecutions, victims and villains is not &quot;truth&quot; though
&gt; admittedly, to the ego it may well seem to be true.  The &quot;truth&quot; is that
&gt; there are no victims and there are no villains and every transaction
&gt; between consenting adults has at least TWO people who are FULLY
&gt; responsible.

&gt; No guru abuses me.  I wouldn't consider giving one the chance!  If you
&gt; choose to walk on thin ice and play hockey with a 'guru' then YOU are
&gt; responsible, as much as anyone, for what comes next.  And if you are an
&gt; adult it is wholly unreasonable not to accept your own responsibility for
&gt; your experience.

&gt; This is not to say there aren't people in the world who abuse others.
&gt; This is not to condone or underplay the hurtful and harmful.  This is to
&gt; say that wherever no one is using chains or putting a gun to your head, if
&gt; you're an adult, you've got some responsibility to be careful about who to
&gt; believe, what stories to accept, and what extreme metaphysical claims to
&gt; accept.

&gt; We DO &quot;attract&quot; to ourselves the kind of experiences we NEED for our own
&gt; spiritual growth.  Some people need the experience of being &quot;sucked in&quot; by
&gt; a guru to learn an important lesson.  I did.  In my young and foolish
&gt; years I was sucked in by one.  But I was a very eager, willing 'victim'
&gt; and what I learned was to trust my own inner guidance and realize that no
&gt; &quot;external&quot; force or authority could replace it.

&gt; I needed to learn that and a &quot;guru&quot; came along to teach me.  Everyone who
&gt; THINKS he needs a guru has, I suspect, a similar kind of spiritual
&gt; learning need.

&gt; Wherever you find dissent being squelched, fear being used to manipulate
&gt; people, and a lot of talk of villains and enemies and threats and dangers,
&gt; you KNOW you're not dealing with the Holy Spirit because that is not the
&gt; Holy Spirit's approach.  Whoever is ATTRACTED to that kind of approach has
&gt; to learn truth from falsehood and one way to do it is to have your face
&gt; rubbed in falsehood.

&gt; If you emerge with &quot;victim consciousness&quot; and feel the &quot;villains have done
&gt; you in&quot; then you haven't learned the lesson.  Return to Go, do not collect
&gt; $200.  Start again until you figure out that YOU are responsible for YOUR
&gt; experience!

&gt; You will have similar experiences until you learn to forgive.

&gt; That does not mean you are responsible for everything that happens.  That
&gt; means you are responsible for how you respond to it, and whether to
&gt; &quot;attack&quot; what you judge negatively or &quot;forgive.&quot;  When you &quot;FORGIVE&quot; you
&gt; &quot;advance to Go, collect $200.&quot;  When you don't, your own negative
&gt; judgements will continue to attract to you precisely what you judge most
&gt; negatively!

&gt; THAT is the &quot;truth&quot; of the matter!

&gt; All the best,

&gt; Doug

realization that i was duped by my own wishful thinking, admitted it to
myself, and have moved on.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Hi DJ

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Did it ever occur to you that if you don't wish to deal with the BS
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; associated with gurus, teachers and groups, just not join one?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well I imagine its like joining a swinger club then complaining that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all the people you meet are making sexual advances. What did think was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going to happen and what did they think they were going to find. An
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ego-less guru?

&gt;&gt;&gt; it worked for me

&gt;&gt;     did you actually believe it?

&gt;&gt;     If you didn't and just said it to make someone else happy, or shut

Hi Donna, Just read your post and felt like just reminiding you that
You are &quot;Whole, and Perfect and Complete&quot; in all that you are. I too
am surprised how many simply accept self proclaimed gurus as a final
source. I was shocked when I found out J-M's back ground as a Child
Molester. After all isnt he supposed to channel Jesus? Isnt He
supposed to be the coveyer of truths?  Also observing some of the
behavior of other so called Mystic opened my eyes. I guess these
experiences take me back to what I was told by Dr. Paul Barrett. Take
what resonates with you at that time and leave what does not. Ask for
Divine Right Action and Divine Guidence in all you do.

I (as you know) had an overwhelming Spiritual Experienace (NDE) but
did not accept it at the time I hid from it until I discovered New
Thought, the 12 steps, and The Course. I did not find Truth thru the
many Guru's along the way, but I practiced the principles of Truth,
steps, lesson, prayer meditation, to the best of my ability at that
time and that led to the  experience that forever changed me. It was
not the guru's.

After all the word &quot;Guru&quot; means......... Geee You R U !!!

The Course can be best summed up this way...

God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change;
courage to change the things I can;
and wisdom to know the difference.

And so it is............. Amen

WE all channel the Holy Spirit, no one has a corner on the market. Run
from those who claim they do!

Christ stands before you T 25 V 2.9

Actually, the course says &quot;seek not to change the world but change you
mind about it&quot;

and

&quot;This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:

nothing Real can be threatened
nothing unreal exists
herein lies the peace of God.&quot;

I'm sure you already know this.

The serenity prayer is from AA

You probably already know that, too.

&gt; &gt; Thank you James!!!!...I will check your site out.
&gt; &gt; I've also created a site which is a home where one can express freely
&gt; &gt; their own experiences with those *MYSTICS&lt; GURU&quot;S&lt;SO CALLED TEACHERS
&gt; &gt; OF THE COURSE* who would misrepresent themselves and would feed upon
&gt; &gt; the hearts and minds of those who are on their journey.
&gt; &gt; There is alot of these *so called spiritual teachers* who are using
&gt; &gt; the book as nothing more than a shield as they go about controling the
&gt; &gt; minds of those that are seeking the truth for themselves.
&gt; &gt; Please join....lets not turn a deaf ear and a blind eye. Extend the
&gt; &gt; hand to your sisters and brothers, don't allow this to continue.
&gt; &gt; It's becoming a 99cent version of misrepresentation, of moderation of
&gt; &gt; anyone who would bring forth the truth. Being the same is not throwing
&gt; &gt; a blanket over everything and waiting for something to crawl out. This
&gt; &gt; is about extending the truth, its not about training the mind not to
&gt; &gt; see.
&gt; &gt; This is well known in the community, and for reasons of power and
&gt; &gt; control is swept under the carpet. Isn't anyone willing to come
&gt; &gt; forward??? Don't allow your selfs to be taught and controlled by those
&gt; &gt; that do not have your best interests. This is about you, your journey,
&gt; &gt; this is a individual study. Not meant to have *so called, Mystics,
&gt; &gt; Master Teachers, or Special Teachers. There is abuse going on in these
&gt; &gt; communities, its known...
&gt; &gt; Please open your minds, open your hearts, be in your stillness and
&gt; &gt; listen to the voice inside. We are met where we are.
&gt; &gt; Come join..lets keep this open...please do not allow those that feed

&gt; Hi Donna, Just read your post and felt like just reminiding you that
&gt; You are &quot;Whole, and Perfect and Complete&quot; in all that you are. I too

Thank you Lee, for coming forth with the truth as your experience. To
stand tall and to not quote something from the course as defense for
these *snake-oil salesmen*.  take a stand of discernment, as part of
my journey through my own experience I have learned from the course to
question everything.
For myself, indeed I agree with you in terms of the lessons in ACIM.
So many that serve as prompts to go about being the best I can be.
I never have been one to sit on something, and if I knew that there
indeed was a cliff on the path forward and someone was behind me I
would tell them.
This is not about intellectulizing metaphysics. This is about
extending the light, this is about reaching out extending a hand, this
is about waking up to ones own truth. We are individuals, and we are
connected. Spokes of a wheel, God (source) in the center, you may be
over there and I here, but we are connected through Divine Source.
My intent is to express through my own experience. And I stand tall in
my truth of who I am. I stand with my sister Jenny, who has a very
clear loving understanding of what the course says. I stand tall with
my sisters and brothers in truth, in our hearts awakening to the truth
of who we are. I (WE) are as God created US. We are indeed
whole,perfect and complete, right here, right NOW.
