Ok here are all mentions of Snape from COS and I'll do same as last
time.  5 categories which shows a good fair analysis I think of what
he is.  Here goes (with the disclaimer):

1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS (To Harry et al)
2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARIANISM
3) EVIDENCE OF FAIRNESS
4) EVIDENCE OF UNFAIRNESS
5) MISCELLANEOUS/WRONG EVIDENCE THAT SNAPE IS EVIL

Please Bear with me but this will be long and worth the read!  You
will see and weigh out where 95% at least of Snape's evilness is
nothing but a facade.  The proof is here (EVERY incident, no matter
how innocuous, I've included it).  With that said, here goes:
Please bear in mind as well:
By evil doings, I mean something that would endanger someone, kill
someone, be disloyal or illegal etc.
By Humanitarianism, I mean help, save or show compassion to someone
By fairness I mean how he's treating someone in compared to others and
By unfairness there is no obvious reason shown for him being mean or
unfair

1) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S EVIL DOINGS
Again there is NOTHING evil he's done (same as book one, the
Philospher/Sorcerer's Stone).  Snape doesn't do anything to harm
anyone, kill anyone or even remotely put them in jeopardy.  He's not
pleasant, but nothing is shown doing anything wrong that would hold up
in a legal or moral court of law either in a criminal or civil suit
There is no evidence of even a POSSIBLE evil doing.

2) EVIDENCE OF SNAPE'S HUMANITARIANISM
There is no direct evidence that Snape saves or shows compassion
for anyone.  HOWEVER; there are a couple minor POSSIBLE incidents that
could be construed as humanitarianism:

P 247 After Snake almost attacks Justin, Snape quickly gets rid
of it.  Then he looks at Harry in an unexpected way; shrewd and
calculating (what????) and Harry didn't like it.  I don't understand
the shrewd look here (what it would mean) but it's of no consequence.
The act of ridding the snake is an example of him saving the students.
However, I didn't put is as evidence (only possible evidence) because
it could be taken as he had to because it was his job.
P 329 Snape is on guard (because kids attacked) and Ron and Harry
have on the invisibility cloaked and Snape sneezes just as Ron swore
(thankfully Ron says because he didn't want to get caught).  Again,
here we see Snape protecting the kids; but because its possibly just
motivated by keeping his job, it's a POSSIBLE act of humanitarianism
only.

3) EVIDENCE OF FAIRNESS
There is at least one act of fairness and Two acts of potential
fairness seen:  P 181 Snape starts to speak to Dumbledore (about Harry
being accused for petrifying Mrs Norris) and Harry has a foreboding
feeling that Snape speaking about him isn't going to do him any good.
Snape says &quot;Potter and his friends simply may have been in the wrong
place at the wrong time&quot; then continues to P 182 where Harry senses
Snape doubts what he said.  He continues &quot;But we do have a set of
suspicious circumstances here.  Why was he in the upstairs corridor at
all?  Why wasn't he at the Halloween feast?&quot;.   Harry lies saying they
were tired and going to bed  and Snape says &quot;Without supper?&quot; Harry
assesses Snape looks triumphant.  Snape says &quot;I didn't think ghosts
provided food fit for living people at their parties&quot; Harry assesses
Snape's nasty smile widens.
So he could have tried to get him into trouble (Harry clearly
assumed he would) but he doesn't.  Instead Harry gets the benefit of
the doubt and gets in no trouble.  This is an act of fairness I think
all would agree.  AND:

P 238 Snape says &quot; silence&quot; (because of the diversion made in
class by Ron and Harry); Hermione steals the boomslang and Snape says
(about the person who did the Fireworks in Goyles cauldron that caused
deformities on the kids - which was Harry that did it);  &quot;If I ever
find out who threw this (after he scoops out Goyles Cauldron and finds
the evidence), I shall make sure the person is expelled&quot;.  Note he
does not blame Harry this time and Harry did do it! Harry says to back
this &quot;He knew it was me&quot; and follows by saying &quot;I could tell&quot;. P 239
Ron says Snape can't prove it was Harry and what could he do anyway&quot;
Harry answers &quot;Knowing Snape, something foul&quot;
Harry here could have been easily accused but was not.  Harry
himself admits Snape knew it was him.  This is out of character for
Snape because he's usually foul; but never-the-less, he doesn't pick
on Harry one bit; that's at least POSSIBLY fair.

P 244 Malfoy cheats with a non-disarming spell and Harry counters
and Snape stops both of them.  (personal note; he let Harry get in a
spell at Malfoy; almost something fair?).  He could have stopped it at
that point letting Malfoy get the better of Harry.  He doesn't.
Mention that Snape looked at Lockhart and quickly looked away (nothing
about that special but it's a Snape mention so I include it)). It's
not sure if he was being fair or just let this slip; but it's possible
it was an act of showing fairness so I put it in the possible column.

4) EVIDENCE OF UNFAIRNESS
There is NO evidence of Snape being purely unfair.  Please read
the &quot;possible&quot; unfairness mentions.  These can be justified in some
way (school rules or whatnot entitle him to be a little stern etc).
there are three acts of POSSIBLE unfairness.

Possible evidence of unfairness:  P 98 Kids get caught sneaking in
the castle after they've just got in from the flying car. Snape takes
them to his office.  He's a annoyed with them and asks them if they
are too good to take the train and when Ron answers Snape says
&quot;Silence!&quot; and then asks what they did with the car. Harry has the
feeling Snape can read minds.  Snape shows the Prophet and that
they've been seen by muggles.  It continues on P 99: Snape says they
did damage to the Whomping Willow, Ron gets a little cheeky by saying
the tree did more damage to them than they did to the tree and Snape
says &quot;Silence&quot;, says he doesn't have the power to expel them but will
get the people that do. Harry surmises that McGonagall is probably
fairer than Snape, but strict and they'll be in as much trouble.

this is evidence perhaps Snape would like Harry expelled and would
like to be unfair (personally this doesn't really qualify as being
even potentially unfair but JUST in case someone thinks different...)
They did do all that damage, were awol etc and theoretically, those
school rules were broken.  He had the right to want punishment.  But
it does appear he's being mean in a way hoping McGonagall will expel
them.  Then again, we do know he's actually keeping an eye on Harry so
really, he doesn't want him expelled.  So that's why I think this
doesn't count as well.

P 183 Snape says &quot;I suggest Headmaster, that Potter is not being
entirely truthful&quot; &quot;It might be a good idea if he were deprived of
certain privileges until he is ready to tell us the whole story. I
personally feel he should be taken off the Gryffindor Quidditch Team
until he is ready to be honest&quot;.  Harry feels Snape looks furious when
DD disagrees.

Actually, Harry is NOT being truthful.  He probably should be punished
till he spits out the fact he heard the voices and why he's there in
that hall; but Harry does lie about it.  However, the fact Snape wants
him removed from the Quidditch team could be construed as heavy-handed
for a &quot;possible&quot; lie (because at that point they aren't positive that
Harry is lying).

Here is one I want to classify as fair but I don't want people to get
in an uproar; I hope people will vote on this one
P 245 Mention that Lockhart was pairing Neville with Justin and Snape
who &quot;glided over like a large malevolent bat&quot; and says &quot;a bad idea,
Professor Lockhart. We'll be sending what's left of Finch-Fletchy up
to the hospital wing in a match box&quot; and then &quot;How about Malfoy and
Potter&quot; said with a twisted smile. Snape whispers something in
Malfoy's ear and Malfoy smiles.

this is fair to me.  He's right about Neville (at least by COS/SS/PS
assessment of Neville).  Malfoy and Harry do make the best pairing.
HOWEVER he could be just being mean.  However he knows Harry is pretty
powerful . . . so it's a little convoluted.  I vote for Possibly fair
category.

5) MISCELLANEOUS/WRONG EVIDENCE THAT SNAPE IS EVIL
These are mostly assessments by Harry (or the authors perspective)
where Snape is being assessed for no good reason other than Harry has
clouded opinions of Snape.  We already know thus far, there is no
evidence in COS or SS/PS that he's done one thing evil.  We also know
he's not been totally unfair either!  He's POSSIBLY been unfair
(single digit times thus far) and he's been shown to be fair and
possibly fair.  So Harry STILL is judging him purely on his
preconceived notions of Slytherin and his looks etc  So here's the
assessments (Please note that above, Harry does this a number of other
times; calling him calculating, shrew, and a number of other things
that really are nothing more than his view).  One more word of note.
If you remove all the assessments of snape by Harry and go on actual
deeds only, you dig out the truth as to Snape's true character.

P  96 Snapes not at the head table and Harry reminisces that Snape is
his least favorite teacher and Harry is Snape's least favorite
student.
P 100 mention of Snape looking happy as he opened the door for
Dumbledore (because Harry and Ron in trouble)
P 102 Snape shot a look of venom as he left with Dumbledore.  Harry's
perception again which is clouded.
P 179 Snape is in the hall with students when Mrs Norris is found
petrified; Harry assesses he looks as though he's trying not to smile
P 101 Snape looked as though Christmas had been cancelled (because
they didn't get expelled) and he says &quot;Professor Dumbledore, these
students have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage
Wizardry, causing damage to an old and valuable tree - surly acts of
this nature -&quot;
P 236 Kids need Boomslang and have to get it from Snape's private

Did she use 'reign' or 'rein'?  It should be the latter in standard

Snape certainly got rid of Lockhart efficiently.

Yes indeed; he gripped the chair tightly... but in this case people
could argue the opening of the chamber might have just been scary to
him and that the gripping meant he was shocked or something.  I have
to be very careful putting this stuff on here not to be accused of
slanting too much because I AM biased. I like Snape for some reason.
Surfacely I have to examine myself and find out why which is why I
enjoy working it out.... and so far, he's my man!  He's doing pretty
good even if he's an irritable cow.

She did use rein; my apologies for the typo
