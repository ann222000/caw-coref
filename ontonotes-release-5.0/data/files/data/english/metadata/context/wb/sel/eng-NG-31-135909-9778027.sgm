A supplier is sending me messages from his very new Macintosh with Apple
Mail. These messages have attachments.

When I (as a PC user) receive the messages, attachments are missing
entirely in Thunderbird and are present but not decodable in Outlook
Express.

The supplier has the &quot;Send Windows-friendly attachments&quot; box checked.

I have traced the problem down to one line in the base-64 header which
immediately precedes the attachment data. Specifically, it's the
&quot;Content-Id:&quot; line.

If I open up the message source, remove this line and resave the message,
the attachment is then available normally in both Thunderbird and Outlook
Express.

My question: is there some way of telling Apple Mail not to put the
&quot;Content-Id:&quot; line in the header?

Thanks. I'll pass that along.

But when I study my supplier's message source, it appears he's already done
this.

I don't think this problem has anything to do with where the attachment is
placed, it has solely to do with that pesky &quot;Content-Id:&quot; line in the
base-64 header. Unless Apple puts that line in there only when the
attachment is not at the absolute bottom of the message, which would be
kind of retarded.

How come Apple is the only one that uses a &quot;Content-Id:&quot; line? What
possible purpose could it serve other than to mess everybody else up? Who
does Steve Jobs think he is? Bill Gates?

Content-ID is a standard mail header and is specified in both RFC822 and
RFC2111.

From &lt; http://mailformat.dan.info/headers/mime.html &gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Content-ID header is primarily of use in multi-part messages (as discussed

below); a Content-ID is a unique identifier for a message part, allowing it to
be referred to (e.g., in IMG tags of an HTML message allowing the inline display
of attached images). The content ID is contained within angle brackets in the
Content-ID header. Here is an example:

Content-ID: &lt;5.31.32252.1057009 ... @server01.example.net&gt;

I'm surprised that Thunderbird doesn't display the attachments correctly,
it's usually quite good about that sort of stuff.

Yes, it's is similar to the Content-Id line in my supplier's Apple Mail
messages which have attachments.

I just went through a number of messages from both Thunderbird and
Outlook Express. Neither program seems to use the Content-Id line in its
own messages.

It is interesting that /both/ email clients choke on the Content-Id line
when it appears in messages from somebody else.

I guess nobody knows how to get Apple Mail to turn the line off.

Nah, it's only interesting that Thunderbird chokes.  Lookout choking is no
surprise at all. ;)

I found this, though it's about SENDING attachments.  Still, it might help:

I did forget that Thunderbird has some 'issues' with attachments.

Hmm.. I just fired up Thunderbiord 2.0.0.9 and pointed it at my IMAP account
and went to a mail I'd sent from Mail.app with several photo attachments.
Thunderbird displayed it fine.

Oh, and just for the record, even when sent as html, the attachments DO show

Can you quote the full headers (anonymizing addresses as needed) of one
the messages that fails.  Also provide the &quot;header&quot; portion for the
attachment.

I really think that there must be something special about these messages
in particular, since people using Apple's Mail.app have been sending
content with attachments to people using Thunderbird and Outhouse on
Windows for many years now.

It's in the MIME standards (for almost a decade now), and I believe
(though I could be wrong about this) it was initially introduced at the
behest of Microsoft when they started sending HTML mail.  The idea was to
be able to tie particular attachments to particular image embedding in
HTML mail.

I hate HTML mail as much as anybody.  But to my knowledge, you are the
only one experiencing this problem.  This is not to say that there isn't a
bug or standards violation in Apple Mail.  If that's what it turns out to
be it wouldn't be the first.

So here are a few things to check out to help identify the problem.

(1) Ask the sender to copy the messages sent to you to other windows users
and find out if those other recipients have the same problem you are
experiencing.

(2) See of other people using Apple's Mail.app can send you messages with
attachments.

And of course, try to post full headers and the header for the &quot;part&quot; from
an offending message.

I am not at all happy that Apple went to creating HTML mail in Leopard.
I wouldn't be surprised if it were causing compatibility problems.  But
lets find out what the problem really is before jumping to conclusions.

I just tested by using Mail.app 3.1 (914/915) to send a message to myself
using its &quot;Stationary&quot; and I attached a picture in the middle of it.

I then read the message with Thunderbird version 2.0.0.9 (20071031) on OS
X, 10.5.1.

As you say all of the attachments (including the stationary background and
top and bottom images) were all fully available in the attachment area in
the pane below the text of the message.

I then then asked Thunderbird to render the message as &quot;Original HTML&quot;
(for which it would need to make use of the content-id part headers).  It
rendered it just fine.  All of the stationary shit was right in place
along with the image that I'd added.

So on OS X, Thunderbird 2.0.0.9 handles this stuff just fine.

I am beginning to suspect what the problem the OP might be experiencing
comes from.  As we know, parts with Contend-ID headers are linked to in
the HTML with things like &lt;img src=&quot;cid:blah-blah-b ... @dom.ain&quot;&gt;.

Now what happens if the attached part isn't in image?  Then there should
be a hyperlink of some sort, so it might be

&lt;a href=&quot;cid:b ... @dom.ain&quot;&gt;text&lt;/a&gt;

So it might just be a problem of finding the right &quot;text&quot; to click on in
the HTML message.

This is all speculation.  We need to know what kind of attachment is
missing, and really see a sample message.

Maybe so, but all the problem does disappear the instant I nuke that
Content-Id line. Abd nobody else i receive mail from uses the Content-Id
line. My supplier reports that he has mixed success wit people being
able to see his attachmenst. Sometimes they can, sometimes not. I don't
have enough control over him to be able to pore over all his messages in
order to find some kind of common thread.

I have emails from
Outlook Express
Outlook
Microsoft Exchange
Thunderbird
Lotus Notes
Mozilla

In all I see Content Type, Transfer, Description and Disposition. Not
one has any Content-Id. Except Apple Mail.

Interestingly, I've just discovered an Apple Mail message to me from
2003. It does NOT contain the Content-Id line, and the attachments are
visible and decodable. Headers from that base-64 item:

--Apple-Mail-6--866277243--

--Apple-Mail-5--866277243
Content-Disposition: attachment
Content-Type: multipart/appledouble;

I'm totally stumped just now.

Not for me. No paper clip, nothing in the attachment well, nothing. I'm not

If nobody else has this problem, it must be his configuration.

I just told Thunderbird to View &gt; Message Body As &gt; Plain Text.

Suddenly all the attachments show up, including the JPG he's used for his
&quot;sig&quot;. It would appear that viewing in plain text forces ALL files to show
up as attachments. Not ideal, but it does work.

I can't seem to find where to tell Outhouse Express how to render the
message, so I still can't see the the attachments there (except the
signature JPG).

customers and others not reliably being able to see his attachments. He has
Thunderbird installed for use in those situations.

OK.  I don't have that version of Mail.app to play with.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Base-64 header portion for a typical attachment:

&gt; --Apple-Mail-14-848248403
&gt; Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
&gt; Content-Id: &lt;E395D166-4754-41CF-8F30-4CEAE4BE12F3@local&gt;

&gt;    name=whatever.jpg
&gt; Content-Disposition: inline;
&gt;    filename=whatever.jpg
">

Can you look through the raw HTML part of the message and look for
something like

cid:E395D166-4754-41CF-8F30-4CEAE4BE12F3@local

If you find it, please post the context in which you find it.

If you don't find it then there really is a bad bug in that version of
Mail.app.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Interestingly, I've just discovered an Apple Mail message to me from
&gt; 2003. It does NOT contain the Content-Id line, and the attachments are
&gt; visible and decodable.
">

Version 1.X of Apple Mail didn't compose HTML mail.  Content-Id only makes
sense in the context of an HTML message.  As I said, the purpose of
Content-id is to link an attachment to some URI in the HTML part of a
message.

Cheers,

I'm pleased that you found a work-around.  I'm still curious about what
the source of the problem is.

If Mail.app always messed up attachments in HTML mail the problem would
have been noticed long ago.  So there is something about the way your
sender is working that is tickling a bug in Mail.app.

I'm happy to keep pressing your for details, but I'm not all that
optimistic about identifying, much less solving, the problem without
cooperation of the person sending the mail.

I can't help you there.  There may not even be a way to say that you want
to see the text/plain part instead of the text/html part.

It's there. I don't know enough about HTML to know what all this means,
but here it is:

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br class=3D&quot;webkit-block-placeholder&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img =
