Hello!

Is there a difference between &quot;a piece of lie&quot; with &quot;a lie&quot;?

Cheers to joy and music,

Josney

I don't recall ever hearing or seeing &quot;a piece of lie&quot;.

By the way, &quot;between&quot; takes &quot;and&quot;, so it's &quot;...a difference between A
and B.&quot;

It's not really familiar to me either, but Google turns up some
examples, such as, &quot;This is a piece of lie being circulated in mail
forwards.&quot;

Yeah, but that was posted by someone with the name Sachin Purohit.

I'd guess that'd be a non-native English speaker.  I think it might be part
of Indian English.

Here's an example from a Washington Post article:

Another Cup of CAFE, Another Piece of Lie

Of course, that's a pun attempt.

Looking at some of the other instances, there does seem to be
correlation with names that would perhaps be Indian. You're probably
correct about it being a dialect phrase.

Several of the 36 hits have Indian associations, such as:

Advocate General Indrajit Ray yesterday said the
allegation against him by Anjana Misra is ``
absolutely false and a blatant piece of lie.''

That doesn't tell us whether it was an idiom created in India or merely
preserved there.

Probably equivalent to &quot;a pack of lies&quot;.

To my ear it's more likely one of those typical Indian pieces of
fractured English, in which a perfectly reasonable, though actually
false, analogy is drawn, with a non-standard result. We do use &quot;piece&quot;
in such expressions as &quot;a piece of fiction&quot;, and pejoratively in, e.g.,
&quot;a piece of cheek&quot;, &quot;a piece of impertinence&quot;. I don't think I'd flicker
at hearing &quot;a piece of falsehood&quot;.

I'd go with &quot;created in&quot;.  It doesn't show up in the OED, and the only
hit I see on Google Books is from a 1972 collection of stories by
R.K. Narayan, who, according to Wikipedia, was born in Chennai[1] in
1906.

[1] Or, rather, I guess, was born in Madras.

It seems to be common for non native English speakers to take random words
in a sentence and assume they are a 'saying'.

plus the whole sentence you quoted makes no sense

Substituting falsehood for lie cleans up the sentence a little.

Or it might be simply a euphemised version of 'a piece of shit'. That
seems to be a reasonable replacement in the quoted instances, aside from
the register shift.
