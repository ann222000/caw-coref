NATIONAL CALL-IN DAY to Montana State Vet, Marty Zaluski
* 406-444-0782

Dear Buffalo Friends,

More than 100 wild buffalo were captured Monday by Yellowstone
officials, who continue to spill the blood of America's last wild
buffalo.  This brings the total capture to 269, and all will be
shipped to slaughter.  On Friday Yellowstone sent another 17 buffalo  to
slaughter.

Today, on our third day of National Call-ins during the Week of
Action, we target Montana's State Vet, Marty Zaluski.  While
Yellowstone National Park is doing the killing now, it is Zaluski who  is
influencing these decisions and ultimately makes the call against  wild
buffalo that migrate into Montana.  Soon their sights will turn  to the
Park's western boundary, where they are preparing the Duck  Creek bison
trap and plan to erect the Horse Butte trap.  Montana's  zero-tolerance
policy against the bison must end.  Talking points are  provided below.

HELP STOP THE SLAUGHTER NOW!   Don't let Montana's cattle industry
dictate the future of native wild buffalo.  The last wild buffalo are  our
national treasures, a keystone species important to all of North  America.

Montana State Vet, Marty Zaluski - 406-444-0782
The goal is to make the phones ring off the hook, but for those out  of
the country, you can send an email to mzalu ... @montana.gov.

* TALKING POINTS FOR CALLING Montana State Vet, Marty Zaluski

1. There has never been a documented case of wild bison transmitting  the
livestock disease brucellosis to cattle

2. The risk of such a transmission is extremely remote. There are no
cattle on public or private lands adjacent to the west boundary of
Yellowstone National Park at the times of year when bison are outside  the
park and the bacteria can't persist in the environment for more  than a
few days in the spring.  Thus, there is absolutely no reason  for
Montana's violent intolerance for wild bison.

3. If the Church Universal and Triumphant insists on keeping cattle
within the bison migration corridor on the north side of the Park,  they
should be required to employ double fencing to ensure that their  cattle
don't come in contact with wild bison.

4. Horse Butte is 100% cattle-free at all times of the year, and the
buffalo should be allowed year-round access to this critical habitat.

5. These are the NATION'S last wild bison, not Montana's to slaughter at
will.

6. Cattle are the manageable element and any effort to reduce the  already
low risk of brucellosis transmission should be focused upon  them.

YELLOWSTONE CONTINUES TO CAPTURE AND KILL BUFFALO, so please don't  stop
calling Yellowstone Superintendent Suzanne Lewis.  Regardless of  what
they tell you, her agency is not beholden to the plan that is  killing
buffalo.  They can refuse to participate and instead defend  wild buffalo.
They have a choice, and right now they are choosing to  ignore their
mandate, as well as the will of the American people, and  instead insist
on killing the wild buffalo the nation has entrusted  them with.  If the
people who answer the phones tell you they are  just doing their jobs,
please remind them that they have a choice and  that their jobs do not
oblige them to support illegal and immoral  actions.
Suzanne Lewis:  307-344-2002
