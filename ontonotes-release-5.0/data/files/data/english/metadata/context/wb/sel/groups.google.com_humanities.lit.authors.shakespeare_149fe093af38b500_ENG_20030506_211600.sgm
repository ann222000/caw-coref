A while back, in a thread somewhat misleadingly entitled &quot;Bacon and
Marlowe,&quot; Peter Farey explained to us how he believes that the misspelling
of &quot;sith&quot; (SIEH) in the inscription on Shakespeare's Stratford monument was
intentionally done in order for the word to be used as a part of the
&quot;riddle&quot; that he believes he has found in the inscription. In addition to
the misspelling, Peter also tells us that the word &quot;SIEH&quot; is further brought
to our attention as an obvious &quot;clue&quot; to his riddle by its unusual usage in
the inscription.

To refresh our memory, here's the text of the inscription:

STAY PASSENGER, WHY GOEST THOV BY SO FAST?
READ IF THOV CANST, WHOM ENVIOVS DEATH HATH PLAST
WITH IN THIS MONVMENT SHAKSPEARE: WITH WHOME,
QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,
FAR MORE, THEN COST: SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT,
LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

To be fair, I should mention that Peter places a colon after the &quot;Quick
Nature Died&quot; part, because he says that although it doesn't appear on the
monument as it exists today, the word &quot;DIDE&quot; appears to have a colon after
it in a photograph that appears in F.E. Halliday's 1956 book, &quot;Shakespeare.&quot;
However, I have a copy of that book, and what Peter sees as a colon appears
to me to be caused by specks of dust on the negative. I've posted the image
here:

Note how the &quot;colon&quot; that Peter sees after &quot;DIDE&quot; is much lighter than the
colon after &quot;SHAKSPEARE&quot; in line three, and the one after the word &quot;COST&quot; in
line five, and how the two specks after &quot;DIDE&quot; are slanted at an angle. The
real colons in the inscription are more pronounced, and are set one directly
above the other, as in the enlarged image that I've posted of the word
&quot;COST.&quot; Note also that there are what appear to be several other dust
specks on the negative, such as the ones above the &quot;M&quot; in &quot;WHOM&quot; in line
two, above the &quot;V&quot; in &quot;MONVMENT&quot; in line three, and to the right of the &quot;O&quot;
in &quot;TO&quot; in the bottom line. There may be a period after the word &quot;DIDE,&quot;
but the upper speck is surely a piece of dust.

Getting back to Peter's &quot;riddle,&quot; his conjecture is that the word &quot;SIEH&quot; is
an important &quot;clue&quot; that the &quot;riddle maker&quot; has brought to our attention by
its unusual usage. If I understand Peter's argument correctly (and he'll
probably say that I do not), he reached this conclusion for basically two
reasons.

First, Peter explained how he had searched 67,000 lines of verse for
instances where the words &quot;sith,&quot;&quot;sithens,&quot; or &quot;since&quot; follow a colon in
mid-line, with the initial &quot;S&quot; capitalized (although the letters in the
inscription on the monument are all in caps, some words begin with a capital
letter that is larger than the others around it--Peter conjectures that this
means that the larger letters are meant to represent captials, and the word
&quot;SIEH&quot; is one that begins with a letter larger than those around it). In
his search, he found only a few examples where an equivalent to the word
&quot;since&quot; followed a colon in mid-line. Further, he only found three times
where the &quot;S&quot; in &quot;Since&quot; was capitalized following a colon, and in each of
those cases, the word &quot;Since&quot; did not mean &quot;as&quot; or &quot;because,&quot; as we presume
it does in the monument's inscription, it meant a passage of time.
Therefore, he concluded that the usage in the inscription was highly
unusual, and that it would have appeared as highly unusual to a reader at
the time.

Secondly, during our earlier discussion regarding just how unusual the usage
in the inscription may have been, Peter Groves helpfully pointed out to us
that the colon following &quot;COST&quot; was used improperly to begin with. According
to Peter G, the &quot;sith&quot; is used here as a subordinating conjunction, and the
clause it introduces (&quot;SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT, LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT
PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT&quot;) is subordinate to the one before it (&quot;WITH WHOME,
QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE, FAR MORE, THEN COST:&quot;).
Since the colon basically functions as a period, Peter G tells us that it
isn't grammatically correct to separate a subordinate clause from its main
clause with a colon. In effect, the &quot;Sith&quot; would be starting a new
sentence, and although it's acceptable to start a sentence with a
subordinating conjunction, it may only occur when the main clause follows
the subordinate clause in the same sentence.

With Peter G's confirmation that the colon following &quot;COST&quot; was an error, I
somewhat grudgingly conceded that the usage of the word &quot;SIEH&quot; in the
inscription was unusual. However, I have since had cause to repent this
concession for reasons that I shall proceed to give here.

Since Peter was looking for examples in his 67,000 lines where an equivalent
to the word &quot;since&quot; was capitalized following a colon, he discounted
instances where &quot;since&quot; was not capitalized, and ignored instances where
&quot;Since&quot; started a line of verse, since it would be capitalized anyway.
However, at this point in the argument, I'm more interested in examples
where the word &quot;since&quot; follows a colon, and where &quot;since&quot; is being used as a
conjunction that introduces a subordinate clause where the main clause is
the one that precedes the colon--regardless of capitalization or line
placement.

Are there instances where such usage occurs? I think so.

First, let's take a look at Heywood's &quot;A funerall elegie upon the death of
Henry, Prince of Wales,&quot; from 1613:

From this poem, we find the following passage:

&quot;Posterity, with greater admiration
Then I can blaze him, shall embrace his Fame,
Those deluges of Teares showr'd from this Nation;
Rather to blemish seeme, then blanch his name:
Since all our Elegies begot from passion,
Come from rent hearts, and those that griefe proclaime.
Confused thoughts the best conceits destroy,
And are more harsh then when we sing of ioy.&quot;
[colon following &quot;name&quot;]

In some ways, the use of &quot;Since&quot; here appears quite similar to the use of
&quot;Sith&quot; in the monument inscription, and this was published just 3 years
before Shakespeare died. Perhaps the usage in the inscription is not
without precedent.

How about forms of verse other than elegies? As part of my TOP SECRET Ben
Jonson web site project, I searched through Jonson's plays, and found the
following examples that *may* be similar to the usage in the inscription:

From the Induction to &quot;Cynthia's Revels&quot;:

&quot;[Boy 3.] Stay, Jack: 'Slid, I'll do somewhat now afore I
go in, though it be nothing but to revenge my self on
the Author: since I speak not his Prologue.&quot;
[colon following &quot;Author&quot;]

From Act IV, scene viii, of &quot;Every Man in his Humor&quot; (prose):

&quot;Wel. No harm done, Brother, I warrant you: since there is no harm done.&quot;
[colon following &quot;you&quot;]

From Act V of &quot;Sejanus&quot;:

&quot;There is enough behind to melt ev'n Rome,
And Caesar into tears: (since never slave
Could yet so highly offend, but tyranny,
In torturing him, would make him worth lamenting.)&quot;
[colon following &quot;tears&quot;]

And, from Act II, scene v, of &quot;The Sad Shepherd&quot;:

&quot;I came to shew it here, to Mellifleur,
I do confess; but Amie's falling ill,
Did put us off it: Since we imploy'd our selves
In comforting of her.&quot;
[colon following &quot;it&quot;]

I've posted images of these passages at:

The first three are from the copy of Jonson's 1616 folio posted at the
Furness web site, and the last one is taken from the 1692 folio reprint of
Jonson's &quot;Works.&quot; The first three examples are repeated in the 1692 folio,
which is where I got the text of the quotes appearing above.

Although we are looking at a pool of writings that are nowhere near Peter's
67,000 line sample, we find what appears to be a similar usage in Heywood's
elegy, and there are at least four appearances of the word &quot;since&quot; following
a colon in Jonson's plays that also appear similiar, one of which
capitalizes the word &quot;Since.&quot; Perhaps the usage isn't as unusual as Peter
originally thought, at least not in the case of Heywood's and Jonson's
writings.

But there is something about the quote from &quot;The Sad Shepherd,&quot; mentioned
above, that makes me wonder if perhaps there might not be another
explanation of the use of the word &quot;Sith&quot; in the inscription. Let's
consider the quotation once more:

&quot;I came to shew it here, to Mellifleur,
I do confess; but Amie's falling ill,
Did put us off it: Since we imploy'd our selves
In comforting of her.&quot;

It's possible that the word &quot;Since&quot; is being used here to mean &quot;as&quot; or
&quot;because,&quot; just as we have presumed that the word &quot;sith&quot; means &quot;as&quot; or
&quot;because&quot; in the monument's inscription, but the usage here appears to be
somewhat ambiguous.

In the passage, spoken by Maid Marian of Robin Hood fame, Marian is
explaining to Robin Hood where she has been. Earlier in the play, Marian
participated in a hunt with some of the Merry Men, and they killed a
magnificent stag. At one point, Marian leaves Robin, accompanied by her
friends, Mellifleur and Amie. While she is gone, the evil witch Maudlin
takes on Marian's form and insults Robin Hood and his friends, and orders
that the deer be sent to Maudlin for her use. When Robin later catches up
with the real Maid Marian, he accuses her of treating him roughly and giving
the deer away. Marian, not knowing that Maudlin has been impersonating her,
naturally denies it.

In the quoted passage, Marian may be explaining that she and her friends had
been put off from seeing the deer &quot;[because] we employed ourselves in
comforting [the sick Amie].

However, I think it more likely that the passage can better be read as
saying that she and her friends had been put off from seeing the deer
because Amie got sick and &quot;Since [that time] we have employed ourselves in
[the] comforting of her.&quot;

Because the passage as written by Jonson omits the &quot;that time&quot; bit following
&quot;Since&quot;, it isn't clear that he's using the word to indicate a passage of
time. But it makes more sense this way. If &quot;Since&quot; is introducing a

Clark, you've no idea how pleased I am to hear from you again.
New and interesting information, such as this, is in short
supply these days. I'll deal with your first point now, but
as I don't have much time at the moment, I will have to come
back the main part of the post at a later date.

My words were &quot;By looking at earlier photographs, we can see
that before the redecoration there was a colon after the word
died&quot;, and gave that as an example. Note the plural, but let
it pass for the moment.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, I have a copy of that book, and what Peter sees as
&gt; a colon appears to me to be caused by specks of dust on the
&gt; negative. I've posted the image here:
&gt; http://hollowaypages.com/inscription.htm

&gt; Note how the &quot;colon&quot; that Peter sees after &quot;DIDE&quot; is much

&gt; line. There may be a period after the word &quot;DIDE,&quot; but the
&gt; upper speck is surely a piece of dust.

This is quite funny. When I first presented my ideas about
the monument to HLAS, I listed the lack of a colon after
DIDE as one of the things that was 'wrong' about it. Jim
actually corrected me on this, saying that there is a colon,
but later saw from the photo in a brochure he picked up
there that it does not in fact have one today.

If we look at various transcripts, however, we find that
several of them do have some form of punctuation there.

Although Dugdale (1656) had nothing there, Vertue (1723)
had a comma, but neither of them had really made any
serious attempt to transcribe it accurately anyway.

Sidney Lee (1898) tried to be a little more accurate, but
succumbed to the temptation to 'correct' it here and there.
Predictably, 'Sieh' became 'sith' and 'then' became 'than'.
That he also put a semi-colon after DIDE therefore tells us
little about whether there was any punctuation actually
there or not.

Methuen's &quot;A Shakespeare Encyclopaedia&quot; (1966) did a pretty
good job of transcribing it, there being only five departures
from the way it appears today - a question mark after 'fast';
a comma after 'plast'; neither 'tombe' nor 'sieh' having
larger initial capitals; and a colon after DIDE.

The Riverside did a bit better. Again the question mark
is given, and the comma after 'plast'. Although there is
no comma after 'far more' they acknowledge that there could
possibly be one. They too have the colon after DIDE.

John Michell has an interesting illustration in his &quot;Who
Wrote Shakespeare&quot; (p.94) which appears to have been derived
from a 'rubbing' of some sort. In this, there are bits of
punctuation after every line, including a weirdly shaped
question mark for the first, and a full stop for the last.
All is much as we see it today, therefore, except for the
question mark, the comma after 'plast' and (yet again) that
colon after DIDE.

Finally, I did say that there was more than one photograph.
The other I made a note of was in Israel Gollancz's &quot;A Book
of Homage to Shakespeare&quot; (1916). The marks at the ends of
the lines are too indistinct to be sure that all of them are
intentional punctuation marks. One item is quite clear,
however. There is a colon after the word DIDE.

As I said, I will return to the main part of your post when
I have the time. One point I will make, though, is that I
think that it is a bit of a shame that this has to be thought
of as part of the authorship question. As far as I can see,
you have made a very valid - and as far as I know, new -
suggestion for what that last bit of the poem might mean, and
it deserves to be discussed in its own right, regardless of
what effect it might have upon the validity of my 'riddle'.

I would certainly like to approach in that light first.

I thought that there was a colon because I was reading Schoenbaum's
transcription of the text, and he placed a colon after &quot;DIDE&quot;, because
he obviously changed the punctuation himself to modernize and
make it consistent. He adds a colon after &quot;MARONEM&quot; (should be a
comma), a period after &quot;HABET&quot; (should be nothing), a question
mark after &quot;FAST&quot; (should be a comma) etc.

There is no colon after &quot;DIDE&quot;.

I'll reserve judgment until I've had a chance to check a few more sources.
As you can see from the post on my web site, the resolution of the Haliday
photo isn't very good, since the &quot;colon&quot; after DIDE makes up just two
overly-bright pixels for the upper dot. Depending on whether we can find a
photograph with better resolution (and the Gollancz photo doesn't sound like
it would have that fine of a resolution either), even if it does show up in
other photographs it might still be specks of paint or something on the
monument. The fact that the &quot;colon&quot; slants, rather than is straight up and
down, is what gives me pause.

This is not true; the usage is just fine. It is the fact that

an initial capital (i.e. a capital letter larger than most)

&gt; examples where an equivalent to the word &quot;since&quot; followed a
&gt; colon in mid-line. Further, he only found three times where
&gt; the &quot;S&quot; in &quot;Since&quot; was capitalized following a colon, and in
&gt; each of those cases, the word &quot;Since&quot; did not mean &quot;as&quot; or
&gt;&quot;because,&quot; as we presume it does in the monument's inscription,
&gt; it meant a passage of time. Therefore, he concluded that
&gt; the usage in the inscription was highly unusual, and that
&gt; it would have appeared as highly unusual to a reader at the
&gt; time.

"/>

Mostly right, but I wouldn't put it quite as strongly as that.
I think that someone who knew that a clue lies in those words
where the intial capitalization seems unusual would certainly
have picked this out as one of them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Secondly, during our earlier discussion regarding just how
&gt; unusual the usage in the inscription may have been, Peter
&gt; Groves helpfully pointed out to us that the colon following
&gt;&quot;COST&quot; was used improperly to begin with.

"/>

Without going back to what he said, I thought it was that
this should not be the start of a new sentence, which the
combination of the colon and the initial capital would have
made it. If he said it is just the colon, we both disagree
with him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; According to Peter G, the &quot;sith&quot; is used here as a
&gt; subordinating conjunction, and the clause it introduces
&gt; (&quot;SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT, LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE,
&gt; TO SERVE HIS WITT&quot;) is subordinate to the one before it
&gt; (&quot;WITH WHOME, QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS
&gt; TOMBE, FAR MORE, THEN COST:&quot;).

"/>

The clause before it is &quot;WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,
FAR MORE, THEN COST:&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Since the colon basically functions as a period,

"/>

Not always. For me it is the *combination* of the colon with
an initial capital that would indicate the start of a new
sentence, unless there were some other reason for there to
have been an initial capital, of course.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Peter G tells us that it isn't grammatically correct to
&gt; separate a subordinate clause from its main clause with a
&gt; colon. In effect, the &quot;Sith&quot; would be starting a new
&gt; sentence, and although it's acceptable to start a sentence
&gt; with a subordinating conjunction, it may only occur when
&gt; the main clause follows the subordinate clause in the same
&gt; sentence.

&gt; With Peter G's confirmation that the colon following &quot;COST&quot;
&gt; was an error, I somewhat grudgingly conceded that the usage
&gt; of the word &quot;SIEH&quot; in the inscription was unusual. However,
&gt; I have since had cause to repent this concession for reasons
&gt; that I shall proceed to give here.

&gt; Since Peter was looking for examples in his 67,000 lines
&gt; where an equivalent to the word &quot;since&quot; was capitalized
&gt; following a colon, he discounted instances where &quot;since&quot; was
&gt; not capitalized, and ignored instances where &quot;Since&quot; started
&gt; a line of verse, since it would be capitalized anyway.
&gt; However, at this point in the argument, I'm more interested
&gt; in examples where the word &quot;since&quot; follows a colon, and where
&gt;&quot;since&quot; is being used as a conjunction that introduces a
&gt; subordinate clause where the main clause is the one that
&gt; precedes the colon--regardless of capitalization or line
&gt; placement.

"/>

In which case, whilst you may be arguing with Peter Groves,
you are certainly not arguing with me. My interest is solely
in whether the use of the *initial capital* is unusual or not.
My claim is that *if* this word is a subordinating conjuction
it should not start a sentence, as the main clause precedes
it. Therefore to have an initial capital and the colon (which
together indicate the start of a sentence) is incorrect.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Are there instances where such usage occurs? I think so.

"/>

I know so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; First, let's take a look at Heywood's &quot;A funerall elegie

&gt; Confused thoughts the best conceits destroy,

&gt; In some ways, the use of &quot;Since&quot; here appears quite

No perhaps about it. Whose arguing? Does &quot;Since&quot; start a

Peter Groves can answer for himself as to whether you have

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But there is something about the quote from &quot;The Sad Shepherd,&quot;
&gt; mentioned above, that makes me wonder if perhaps there might
&gt; not be another explanation of the use of the word &quot;Sith&quot; in the
&gt; inscription. Let's consider the quotation once more:

&gt;&quot;I came to shew it here, to Mellifleur,
&gt; I do confess; but Amie's falling ill,
&gt; Did put us off it: Since we imploy'd our selves
&gt; In comforting of her.&quot;

&gt; It's possible that the word &quot;Since&quot; is being used here to mean
&gt;&quot;as&quot; or &quot;because,&quot; just as we have presumed that the word &quot;sith&quot;
&gt; means &quot;as&quot; or &quot;because&quot; in the monument's inscription, but the
&gt; usage here appears to be somewhat ambiguous.

&gt; In the passage, spoken by Maid Marian of Robin Hood fame,
&gt; Marian is explaining to Robin Hood where she has been.
&gt; Earlier in the play, Marian participated in a hunt with some
&gt; of the Merry Men, and they killed a magnificent stag. At
&gt; one point, Marian leaves Robin, accompanied by her friends,
&gt; Mellifleur and Amie. While she is gone, the evil witch
&gt; Maudlin takes on Marian's form and insults Robin Hood and
&gt; his friends, and orders that the deer be sent to Maudlin
&gt; for her use. When Robin later catches up with the real Maid
&gt; Marian, he accuses her of treating him roughly and giving
&gt; the deer away. Marian, not knowing that Maudlin has been
&gt; impersonating her, naturally denies it.

&gt; In the quoted passage, Marian may be explaining that she and
&gt; her friends had been put off from seeing the deer &quot;[because]
&gt; we employed ourselves in comforting [the sick Amie].

&gt; However, I think it more likely that the passage can better
&gt; be read as saying that she and her friends had been put off
&gt; from seeing the deer because Amie got sick and &quot;Since [that
&gt; time] we have employed ourselves in [the] comforting of her.&quot;

&gt; Because the passage as written by Jonson omits the &quot;that time&quot;
&gt; bit following &quot;Since&quot;, it isn't clear that he's using the
&gt; word to indicate a passage of time. But it makes more sense
&gt; this way.

"/>

I agree.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If &quot;Since&quot; is introducing a subordinate clause, then the
&gt; usage is violating Peter G's rules of grammar. But if it's
&gt; really referring to a passage of time, this problem
&gt; disappears. &quot;Since [then] we have employed ourselves in [the]
&gt; comforting of her&quot; stands alone as a complete sentence, and
&gt; therefore may properly follow a colon.

"/>

Yes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In the context of the play, this interpretation of the line
&gt; also serves to explain why Marian has been out of sight for
&gt; awhile, and couldn't have been the person that was seen by
&gt; Robin.

&gt; But if the use of the word &quot;Since&quot; in Jonson's line serves
&gt; to indicate a passage of time, might there not be other
&gt; instances where the word &quot;Since&quot; (or &quot;sith&quot;) is used in such
&gt; a way that we might mistakenly assume that it is meant to be
&gt; read as &quot;as&quot; or &quot;because&quot;? Especially if the sentence was
&gt; constructed in such a way that would appear to our modern
&gt; eyes to call for an assumption that the word is being used
&gt; to mean &quot;as&quot; or &quot;because.&quot;

"/>

Yes, there could.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In following up on this line of thought, I came upon John
&gt; Ford's contribution to &quot;Jonsonus Virbius.&quot; In his poem
&gt; entitled &quot;On the Best of English Poets, Ben Jonson, Deceased,&quot;
&gt; Ford writes:

&gt;&quot;Great men, and worthy of report, must fall
&gt; Into their earth, and sleeping there sleep all:
&gt; Since he, whose pen in every strain did use
&gt; To drop a verse, and every verse a muse,
&gt; Is vowed to heaven; as having with fair glory,
&gt; Sung thanks of honour, or some nobler story.&quot;

&gt; We have an example here of the word &quot;Since&quot; following a colon,
&gt; and at first glance the usage appears to be structured in
&gt; such a way that it is meant to be read as &quot;as&quot; or &quot;because.&quot;
&gt; But it appears to make very little sense if you read it that
&gt; way.

"/>

Frankly, I have problems making sense of it either way!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Cutting out the subordinate clauses pertaining to Jonson's
&gt; pen, muse, and verse, the clause is basically saying &quot;Since
&gt; he [Jonson] is vowed [promised] to heaven.&quot; But how does
&gt; this relate to the clause that precedes the colon?

"/>

It doesn't. At least not now that you have removed the bit
that might have done! Don't worry, though, I am agreeing with
where you are going, just not sure that this is a particularly
good example to use. It's not worth arguing about, anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How would Jonson's being promised to heaven support the idea
&gt; that great men must die and be buried, along with everybody
&gt; else? And the clause following the semi-colon after &quot;heaven&quot;
&gt; doesn't help, as it appears to be subordinate to the clause
&gt; that immediately precedes it.

&gt; It makes more sense if we assume that the &quot;Since&quot; here is
&gt; meant to be read as &quot;Since the time of Jonson's death.&quot;
&gt; Then we would have two proper sentences, the first saying
&gt; that great men die, and the second saying that since the time
&gt; of Jonson's own death he has been promised to heaven, because
&gt; his poetry had sung thanks of honor (or something nobler)
&gt; with fair glory. We can understand it to be saying this by
&gt; interpolating one word, and updating the punctuation a little:
&gt;&quot;Since [then], he is vowed to heaven.&quot;

"/>

OK, we agree that it is possible for &quot;since&quot; (or &quot;sith&quot;) to be
either a conjuction, as we have assumed the monument's usage to
be up until now or an adverb, as you are suggesting here, and
that it is sometimes not too easy to see which one is intended.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; From here, it's a short step to reconsidering the monument
&gt; inscription. To me, one of the major problems with the
&gt; presumption that &quot;Sith&quot; is meant here as a subordinating
&gt; conjunction is that the clause it introduces seems to have
&gt; little to do with the clause that precedes the colon. My
&gt; mind, at least, boggles trying to figure out how the fact
&gt; that &quot;everything that Shakespeare has written leaves living
&gt; Art to serve as his wit's Page&quot; can possibly help to explain
&gt; to us why quick nature died with Shakespeare, or why his
&gt; name adorns his tomb far more than cost. What does the
&gt; enduring excellence of Shakespeare's writing have to do with
&gt; the expense of the monument, or the expense of the monument's
&gt; adornments?

&gt; Isn't a subordinate clause meant to help explain the main
&gt; clause? As in, &quot;I stopped to have lunch, since I was hungry.&quot;
&gt; We wouldn't say, &quot;I stopped to have lunch, since everything
&gt; I've written will make me famous.&quot; So why would the
&gt; inscription say: &quot;Shakespeare's name adorns his tomb far more
&gt; than costly ornaments, because everything that he wrote makes
&gt; living Art his wit's servant&quot;? How does the supposedly
&gt; subordinate clause demonstrate that Shakespeare's mere name
&gt; is a better ornament than costly furnishings? Shakespeare
&gt; presumably didn't write his own name on the tomb, so what
&gt; does the excellence of what he &quot;hath writt&quot; have to do with
&gt; the writing of his name in the inscription?

"/>

I am not really the one who should be arguing that this makes
sense, as there are plenty of others here who have insisted,
*against* what I say, that it does, and with 'sith' taken to
be a conjunction.

What I *will* say, however, is that I have no difficulty seeing
how people can dredge an acceptable meaning for it in this form.
At its simplest, the very name of Shakespeare on the monument
embellishes it more than costly decoration can do *because*
his writing is so damned good that even living art has become
just a page to his wit. I'm sure others can put it better.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, what if the &quot;Sith&quot; is not meant as a subordinate
&gt; conjunction at all? What if it's referring to the time since
&gt; Shakespeare was placed in the tomb by envious Death? The
&gt; clause talks about living art being left to serve Shakespeare's
&gt; wit, and refers back to all that Shakespeare had written before
&gt; he died. Doesn't this at least suggest a passage of time,
&gt; which could mean that living Art has become his wit's Page
&gt; since his death?

&gt; If we read it that way, a lot of the ambiguity of the
&gt; inscription evaporates. And as in the example given above,
&gt; all it really takes to make it more understandable to modern
&gt; eyes is to interpolate the word &quot;then&quot; and update the
&gt; spelling and punctuation a bit: &quot;Since [then], all that he
&gt; has written leaves living art, but page, to serve his wit.&quot;

&gt; If we read it that way, we end up with three fairly simple
&gt; ideas:

&gt; 1) Stop, passer by, and read of Shakespeare, whom envious
&gt; Death has placed within this monument.

&gt; 2) With him died quick nature, his name adorns this tomb
&gt; far more than costly ornaments.

&gt; 3) Since the time that Death has placed him here, everything
&gt; that he has written leaves living Art as his wit's servant.

"/>

A bit awkward, that bit. Seems to suggest that he has continued
writing *after* his death. (On the other hand...!)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Reading the inscription this way, the use of &quot;Sith&quot; following
&gt; a colon does not violate Peter G's rules of logical grammar,
&gt; as it's introducing a new idea. It also brings greater
&gt; clarity to what the inscription is saying, and makes the
&gt; passage flow more logically. The first sentence tells us
&gt; that Death has placed Shakespeare in the monument, the second
&gt; tells us what happened when he died, and the third tells us
&gt; what's happened since he died.

&gt; Perhaps the wording of the inscription isn't as awkward as
&gt; everyone thinks it is. Maybe we've just been reading it wrong.

"/>

Well, I'll certainly go along with that bit!

There is, however, one particular problem with this
interpretation, and it concerns the fact that 'SIEH' has to
be taken as a misprint for 'sith' and not 'since'.

We have, quite reasonably ...

Sorry, Peter. I had assumed that you had bought into the unusual usage

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Peter Farey:

&gt; I'd just like to check my thinking here.

&gt; * The words &quot;sith&quot; and &quot;since&quot; do not normally have an
&gt; initial capital unless they start a new sentence or
&gt; a line of verse.

&gt; * The &quot;sith&quot; apparently intended on the monument is a
&gt; subordinating conjunction.

&gt; * A subordinating conjunction may start a sentence,
&gt; provided its clause is *followed* by a main clause
&gt; to which it is subordinate.

&gt; * This is not the case on the monument, where the main
&gt; clause to which it is subordinate *precedes* it.

&gt; * Therefore the word &quot;sith&quot; is not starting a new
&gt; sentence.

&gt; * Therefore, since it does not start a line of verse
&gt; either, it would *not* usually have an initial
&gt; capital.

&gt; Have I got that right?

&gt; Peter Groves:

&gt; Yes.

"/>

The &quot;I'd just like to check *my* thinking here&quot; bit made me think that you
were incorporating Dr. G's information into your argument. From the line of
statements you posted, it appeared to me that you were accepting that a
subordinate conjunction should not follow a colon where the main clause
preceded the colon, regardless of capitalization.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If I understand Peter's argument correctly (and he'll
&gt;&gt; probably say that I do not), he reached this conclusion
&gt;&gt; for basically two reasons.

&gt;&gt; First, Peter explained how he had searched 67,000 lines of
&gt;&gt; verse for instances where the words &quot;sith,&quot;&quot;sithens,&quot; or
&gt;&gt;&quot;since&quot; follow a colon in mid-line, with the initial &quot;S&quot;
&gt;&gt; capitalized (although the letters in the inscription on the
&gt;&gt; monument are all in caps, some words begin with a capital
&gt;&gt; letter that is larger than the others around it--Peter
&gt;&gt; conjectures that this means that the larger letters are meant
&gt;&gt; to represent captials,

&gt; You are not disagreeing with this, are you?

"/>

I'm saying that it's a conjecture. Neither of us knows whether that was the
intent or not. From past posts, it appears that Terry Ross didn't accept
your conjecture. But, for the sake of this discussion, we can tentatively
agree to operate under that premise.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; and the word &quot;SIEH&quot; is one that begins with a letter larger
&gt;&gt; than those around it). In his search, he found only a few
&gt;&gt; examples where an equivalent to the word &quot;since&quot; followed a
&gt;&gt; colon in mid-line. Further, he only found three times where
&gt;&gt; the &quot;S&quot; in &quot;Since&quot; was capitalized following a colon, and in
&gt;&gt; each of those cases, the word &quot;Since&quot; did not mean &quot;as&quot; or
&gt;&gt;&quot;because,&quot; as we presume it does in the monument's inscription,
&gt;&gt; it meant a passage of time. Therefore, he concluded that
&gt;&gt; the usage in the inscription was highly unusual, and that
&gt;&gt; it would have appeared as highly unusual to a reader at the
&gt;&gt; time.

&gt; Mostly right, but I wouldn't put it quite as strongly as that.
&gt; I think that someone who knew that a clue lies in those words
&gt; where the intial capitalization seems unusual would certainly
&gt; have picked this out as one of them.

&gt;&gt; Secondly, during our earlier discussion regarding just how
&gt;&gt; unusual the usage in the inscription may have been, Peter
&gt;&gt; Groves helpfully pointed out to us that the colon following
&gt;&gt;&quot;COST&quot; was used improperly to begin with.

&gt; Without going back to what he said, I thought it was that
&gt; this should not be the start of a new sentence, which the
&gt; combination of the colon and the initial capital would have
&gt; made it. If he said it is just the colon, we both disagree
&gt; with him.

See above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; According to Peter G, the &quot;sith&quot; is used here as a

&gt;&gt; TO SERVE HIS WITT&quot;) is subordinate to the one before it
&gt;&gt; (&quot;WITH WHOME, QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS

&gt; The clause before it is &quot;WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,
&gt; FAR MORE, THEN COST:&quot;

Well, only if we accept that there is a colon after &quot;DIDE&quot;. As you
mentioned, Vertue engraved the inscription with a comma after &quot;DIDE&quot;, in
which case I suppose that the main clause could have been &quot;WITH WHOME, QVICK
NATVRE DIDE&quot;. Although Vertue may have used his own inititative to
&quot;correct&quot; the punctuation when he made his engraving, remember that he
engraved it in 1723. The monument was restored in 1749, so if the
inscription was replaced as part of that restoration (as it apparently was
in recent times) Vertue may have accurately transcribed the inscription as
it existed in 1723. But we'll probably never know, so there's no point in
arguing about it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Since the colon basically functions as a period,

&gt; an initial capital that would indicate the start of a new

&gt; have been an initial capital, of course.

&gt;&gt; Peter G tells us that it isn't grammatically correct to
&gt;&gt; separate a subordinate clause from its main clause with a
&gt;&gt; colon. In effect, the &quot;Sith&quot; would be starting a new
&gt;&gt; sentence, and although it's acceptable to start a sentence
&gt;&gt; with a subordinating conjunction, it may only occur when
&gt;&gt; the main clause follows the subordinate clause in the same
&gt;&gt; sentence.

&gt;&gt; With Peter G's confirmation that the colon following &quot;COST&quot;
&gt;&gt; was an error, I somewhat grudgingly conceded that the usage
&gt;&gt; of the word &quot;SIEH&quot; in the inscription was unusual. However,
&gt;&gt; I have since had cause to repent this concession for reasons
&gt;&gt; that I shall proceed to give here.

&gt;&gt; Since Peter was looking for examples in his 67,000 lines
&gt;&gt; where an equivalent to the word &quot;since&quot; was capitalized
&gt;&gt; following a colon, he discounted instances where &quot;since&quot; was
&gt;&gt; not capitalized, and ignored instances where &quot;Since&quot; started
&gt;&gt; a line of verse, since it would be capitalized anyway.
&gt;&gt; However, at this point in the argument, I'm more interested
&gt;&gt; in examples where the word &quot;since&quot; follows a colon, and where
&gt;&gt;&quot;since&quot; is being used as a conjunction that introduces a
&gt;&gt; subordinate clause where the main clause is the one that
&gt;&gt; precedes the colon--regardless of capitalization or line
&gt;&gt; placement.

&gt; In which case, whilst you may be arguing with Peter Groves,
&gt; you are certainly not arguing with me. My interest is solely
&gt; in whether the use of the *initial capital* is unusual or not.
&gt; My claim is that *if* this word is a subordinating conjuction
&gt; it should not start a sentence, as the main clause precedes
&gt; it. Therefore to have an initial capital and the colon (which
&gt; together indicate the start of a sentence) is incorrect.

"/>

As I mentioned, I was apparently thrown off by your posting back in
November, quoted above.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Are there instances where such usage occurs? I think so.

&gt; I know so.

&gt;&gt; First, let's take a look at Heywood's &quot;A funerall elegie
&gt;&gt; upon the death of Henry, Prince of Wales,&quot; from 1613:
&gt;&gt; http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~rbear/heywood1.html

&gt; This was one of the poems in my sample too.

&gt;&gt; From this poem, we find the following passage:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Posterity, with greater admiration
&gt;&gt; Then I can blaze him, shall embrace his Fame,
&gt;&gt; Those deluges of Teares showr'd from this Nation;
&gt;&gt; Rather to blemish seeme, then blanch his name:
&gt;&gt; Since all our Elegies begot from passion,
&gt;&gt; Come from rent hearts, and those that griefe proclaime.
&gt;&gt; Confused thoughts the best conceits destroy,
&gt;&gt; And are more harsh then when we sing of ioy.&quot;
&gt;&gt; [colon following &quot;name&quot;]

&gt;&gt; In some ways, the use of &quot;Since&quot; here appears quite
&gt;&gt; similar to the use of &quot;Sith&quot; in the monument inscription,
&gt;&gt; and this was published just 3 years before Shakespeare died.
&gt;&gt; Perhaps the usage in the inscription is not without
&gt;&gt; precedent.

&gt; No perhaps about it. Whose arguing? Does &quot;Since&quot; start a
&gt; sentence? No. So why does it have an initial capital?
&gt; Because it's the first word of the line of verse.

"/>

*Perhaps* it has an initial capital because it starts a line of verse. We
don't know whether or not Heywood would have capitalized it if it had come
in mid-line.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; How about forms of verse other than elegies? As part
&gt;&gt; of my TOP SECRET Ben Jonson web site project, I searched
&gt;&gt; through Jonson's plays, and found the following examples
&gt;&gt; that *may* be similar to the usage in the inscription:

&gt;&gt; From the Induction to &quot;Cynthia's Revels&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&quot;[Boy 3.] Stay, Jack: 'Slid, I'll do somewhat now
&gt;&gt; afore I go in, though it be nothing but to revenge my
&gt;&gt; self on the Author: since I speak not his Prologue.&quot;
&gt;&gt; [colon following &quot;Author&quot;]

&gt; Does it begin a sentence? No. Does it have an initial
&gt; capital? No. So does it affect my case? No

Remember that I said in my initial post that:

I'm not as interested in the capitalization at this point, I'm checking to
see if Dr. G's &quot;forbidden&quot; usage was unusual or not. Since I was keeping in
mind your comments from last November, I thought you might be interested in
that question as well. ...

&gt;&gt; But if the use of the word &quot;Since&quot; in Jonson's line serves
&gt;&gt; to indicate a passage of time, might there not be other
&gt;&gt; instances where the word &quot;Since&quot; (or &quot;sith&quot;) is used in such
&gt;&gt; a way that we might mistakenly assume that it is meant to be
&gt;&gt; read as &quot;as&quot; or &quot;because&quot;? Especially if the sentence was
&gt;&gt; constructed in such a way that would appear to our modern
&gt;&gt; eyes to call for an assumption that the word is being used
&gt;&gt; to mean &quot;as&quot; or &quot;because.&quot;

&gt; Yes, there could.

&gt;&gt; In following up on this line of thought, I came upon John
&gt;&gt; Ford's contribution to &quot;Jonsonus Virbius.&quot; In his poem
&gt;&gt; entitled &quot;On the Best of English Poets, Ben Jonson, Deceased,&quot;
&gt;&gt; Ford writes:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Great men, and worthy of report, must fall
&gt;&gt; Into their earth, and sleeping there sleep all:
&gt;&gt; Since he, whose pen in every strain did use
&gt;&gt; To drop a verse, and every verse a muse,
&gt;&gt; Is vowed to heaven; as having with fair glory,
&gt;&gt; Sung thanks of honour, or some nobler story.&quot;

&gt;&gt; We have an example here of the word &quot;Since&quot; following a colon,
&gt;&gt; and at first glance the usage appears to be structured in
&gt;&gt; such a way that it is meant to be read as &quot;as&quot; or &quot;because.&quot;
&gt;&gt; But it appears to make very little sense if you read it that
&gt;&gt; way.

&gt; Frankly, I have problems making sense of it either way!

&gt;&gt; Cutting out the subordinate clauses pertaining to Jonson's
&gt;&gt; pen, muse, and verse, the clause is basically saying &quot;Since
&gt;&gt; he [Jonson] is vowed [promised] to heaven.&quot; But how does
&gt;&gt; this relate to the clause that precedes the colon?

&gt; It doesn't. At least not now that you have removed the bit
&gt; that might have done! Don't worry, though, I am agreeing with
&gt; where you are going, just not sure that this is a particularly
&gt; good example to use. It's not worth arguing about, anyway.

"/>

I'm pleased we agree up to this point. But I want to argue with you just a
little bit about the part I removed. Note that the pen, muse, and verse
sub-clauses all serve to describe the &quot;he&quot; in &quot;Since he...&quot; The &quot;he&quot; is
Jonson, of course (as is clear from the rest of the poem, which I'll post,
if you want me to). And the &quot;whose pen in every strain did use / To drop a
verse, and every verse a muse&quot; bit merely gives us some properties that
belonged to &quot;he&quot;.

Similarly, in the monument's inscription, the &quot;that he hath writt&quot; bit
serves to tell us what the &quot;all&quot; is in the &quot;Sith all...&quot; part. It seems to
me that the lines in Ford's verse are constructed in virtually exact
parallel to the inscription on the monument:

&quot;Since he&quot; corresponds to &quot;Sith all&quot;. &quot;Since&quot; and &quot;Sith&quot; are adverbs (I'm
taking your word for it here, they might be prepositions, for all I know).
&quot;He&quot; is a pronoun. &quot;All&quot; is acting as a noun, I believe.

&quot;whose pen in every strain did use / To drop a verse, and every verse a
muse&quot; corresponds to &quot;that he hath writt&quot;. The first gives us a property of
the pronoun &quot;he&quot;, the second tells us what the noun &quot;all&quot; is made up of.

&quot;is vowed to heaven&quot; corresponds to &quot;leaves living art... to serve his wit.&quot;
&quot;Is&quot; is a verb. &quot;Leaves&quot; is a verb.

The only real difference in construction between the two is the pun about
the &quot;page&quot;.

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; OK, we agree that it is possible for &quot;since&quot; (or &quot;sith&quot;) to be
&gt; either a conjuction, as we have assumed the monument's usage to
&gt; be up until now or an adverb, as you are suggesting here, and
&gt; that it is sometimes not too easy to see which one is intended.

"/>

Good so far.

&lt;snip&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; However, what if the &quot;Sith&quot; is not meant as a subordinate
&gt;&gt; conjunction at all? What if it's referring to the time since
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare was placed in the tomb by envious Death? The
&gt;&gt; clause talks about living art being left to serve Shakespeare's
&gt;&gt; wit, and refers back to all that Shakespeare had written before
&gt;&gt; he died. Doesn't this at least suggest a passage of time,
&gt;&gt; which could mean that living Art has become his wit's Page
&gt;&gt; since his death?

&gt;&gt; If we read it that way, a lot of the ambiguity of the
&gt;&gt; inscription evaporates. And as in the example given above,
&gt;&gt; all it really takes to make it more understandable to modern
&gt;&gt; eyes is to interpolate the word &quot;then&quot; and update the
&gt;&gt; spelling and punctuation a bit: &quot;Since [then], all that he
&gt;&gt; has written leaves living art, but page, to serve his wit.&quot;

&gt;&gt; If we read it that way, we end up with three fairly simple
&gt;&gt; ideas:

&gt;&gt; 1) Stop, passer by, and read of Shakespeare, whom envious
&gt;&gt; Death has placed within this monument.

&gt;&gt; 2) With him died quick nature, his name adorns this tomb
&gt;&gt; far more than costly ornaments.

&gt;&gt; 3) Since the time that Death has placed him here, everything
&gt;&gt; that he has written leaves living Art as his wit's servant.

&gt; A bit awkward, that bit. Seems to suggest that he has continued
&gt; writing *after* his death. (On the other hand...!)

"/>

It's a bit awkward because I was a bit heavy handed in trying to get my
point across. A better paraphrase might be: &quot;Since then, the work he left
behind makes living Art no more than his wit's servant.&quot;

However, although perhaps less awkward, I think that this paraphrase is
missing a sense that is being conveyed by the line in the inscription. As a
verb, &quot;leaves&quot; implies something being left behind after someone's death
(see OED's definition of &quot;leave&quot; as a verb, 2.a.).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Reading the inscription this way, the use of &quot;Sith&quot; following
&gt;&gt; a colon does not violate Peter G's rules of logical grammar,
&gt;&gt; as it's introducing a new idea. It also brings greater
&gt;&gt; clarity to what the inscription is saying, and makes the
&gt;&gt; passage flow more logically. The first sentence tells us
&gt;&gt; that Death has placed Shakespeare in the monument, the second
&gt;&gt; tells us what happened when he died, and the third tells us
&gt;&gt; what's happened since he died.

&gt;&gt; Perhaps the wording of the inscription isn't as awkward as
&gt;&gt; everyone thinks it is. Maybe we've just been reading it wrong.

&gt; Well, I'll certainly go along with that bit!

&gt; There is, however, one particular problem with this
&gt; interpretation, and it concerns the fact that 'SIEH' has to
&gt; be taken as a misprint for 'sith' and not 'since'.

"/>

Perhaps. It may have started out as &quot;since&quot; but was transformed to &quot;sith&quot;
once the stone mason realized he was screwing up. Imagine that he carved
the &quot;S&quot;, then the &quot;I&quot;, then the left side of the first down stroke on an
&quot;N&quot;. Then he goes to lunch. When he gets back, he remembers that he has to
finish the word &quot;Since&quot;, but since the light is bad, and he had a couple of
beers during lunch, he thinks he left off working on the final letter in
&quot;SINCE&quot; and finishes up the beginning of the &quot;N&quot; as an &quot;E&quot;. Taking a step
back to admire his work, he says, &quot;Oh f**k, I screwed up the 'SINCE'.
There's no way I'll be able to make a 'SINCE' out of 'SIE'. What the hell
will I do? Oh well, maybe if I put an 'H' after it people will read it as
'SITH' and I won't get fired from this crummy job.&quot;

But then again, maybe not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We have, quite reasonably tended to take the two words as
&gt; fairly interchangeable, and have so far ignored how the usage
&gt; of the two might have differed at the time the monument was
&gt; designed.

&gt; The OED gives us an answer, with its second definition of 'sith'
&gt; as a conjunction:

&gt; 2. Seeing that; = SINCE *conj.* 4. Now *arch.* or *poet.*

&gt; Very common from c 1520 to c 1670, being freq. used to
&gt; express cause, while *since* was restricted to time.

&gt; This is not to say that 'sith' could not also have fulfilled
&gt; the role of an adverb, referring to time, at the date in
&gt; question, but this certainly does appear to have been quite
&gt; an uncommon usage.

"/>

I had checked the OED definition of &quot;sith&quot; prior to writing my message. As
you say, it certainly doesn't rule out the use of &quot;sith&quot; as an adverb.
Also, I'm a bit confused about the OED's claim that &quot;since&quot; was restricted
to time. You and I have both found instances from publications between 1520
and 1670 where &quot;since&quot; quite obviously is being used to express cause.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Looking at my 67,000 line sample, for example, I find the
&gt; word 'sith' used 205 times. Of these, there are a couple
&gt; I really can't be sure about, 185 are fairly clearly
&gt; conjunctions, whereas only 18 are adverbs. This may
&gt; not seem too bad, but all except *one* of the latter is
&gt; from Edmund Spenser, and 14 of them in the deliberately
&gt; archaic *The Faerie Queene*.

&gt; That one exception is in *3 Henry VI*

&gt; Ten dayes ago, I drown'd these newes in teares.
&gt; And now to adde more measure to your woes,
&gt; I come to tell you things sith then befalne.
&gt; After the bloody Fray at Wakefield fought,

&gt; As you will see, this example also has the word 'then'
&gt; after the 'sith' to make it clear what is meant.

&gt; So, even though there are the two *possible* meanings, it
&gt; is nevertheless fairly certain that the one the writer most
&gt; probably wanted to convey was the one based upon 'sith'
&gt; as a conjunction rather than as an adverb, and (even if
&gt; he didn't) that this is undoubtedly the way most readers of
&gt; the time would have understood it.

"/>

Looks like you've turned on me here. My premise is that the use of the
colon and the capitalization is only acceptable IF &quot;sith&quot; is being used as
an adverb. And a reader from that time would have known that. It doesn't
matter that this use of &quot;sith&quot; doesn't appear very often. What matters is
that in the context of the line, the reader is forced into realizing that
&quot;sith&quot; is meant as an adverb precisely because it is capitalized and
following a colon.

I believe that the examples I've given from &quot;The Sad Shepherd&quot; and Ford's
poem show that readers from that time could be expected to know that &quot;since&quot;
(or &quot;sith&quot;, for that matter) was meant as an adverb when the context was
right.

To give a bit of a ridiculous example, I think that we can both agree that
the word &quot;xylophone&quot; is an infrequently ...

I'm close to agreeing with &quot;sieh&quot; as a mistake for &quot;sith,&quot; and &quot;sith&quot; meaning
&quot;since then,&quot; but not if the work left behind makes living art NO MORE than his
wit's servant. (1) The monument's Latin praises Shakespeare's writing, so it
seems unlikely the English inscription would say that his conversation was much
better than his poetry, or say that in a way that disparages his poetry rather
than praises his conversation; (2) poetry really only has a page to serve the
poet's wit, anyway, basically--or are we to take his poetry as little except
when he himself declaimed it? As actors will continue to do? So I continue to
read &quot;all that he hath writ,&quot; etc., as &quot;all that he wrote leaves LIVING ART
(something Very Good)--(ALTHOUGH) only a page--to serve his wisdom.
