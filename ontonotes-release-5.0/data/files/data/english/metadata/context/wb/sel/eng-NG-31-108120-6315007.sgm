There is lots of talk aboyt exposure bracketing, which I agree is (almost)
useless with RAW.

However, with current autofocus cameras, what would be extremely useful
would be focus bracketing. But apparently this does not exist.

Why? Or does it for some cameras?

This is something that I would love to have.  There is software that
will combine a number of images
taken at different focal points, some focus bracketing would be just
the thing to get the images.

Why not general bracketing, while we're at it? I'm at least half-serious.
Exposure bracketing, of course. Aperture bracketing, ISO bracketing,
focus bracketing, heck, even zoom bracketing... and a combination
of all these..

Yes, Yes.  And permanently mount the camera on a tripod so it stays in
place while it does all of that (and you forgot maybe having it pan
back and forth a bit).  Memory is cheap and camera are quick, so it
could take every possible permatation while sitting there.  4
variables with 4 shots each would only be 256 images.  That's just a
couple of minutes.  What's the big deal.  Then everyone could take
great images all of  the time without knowing anything.  Sounds
ideal !!!

Of course: Olympus E-500 and E-330.

The feature is called *MF bracketing* (MF BKT):

Maybe I am overlooking the point, but why would you need focus bracketing,
you focus on what you are shooting?

Ahhh, I think I know what you are thinking.  If you are shooting with a big
aperture, it is not always practical to use the DOF preview button, or
calculate DOF, to ensure that all the subjects you want in focus, are in
focus, as this takes time that you don't always have.

So to put it into real life terms, are you saying that you are shooting a
group shot of people, some close, some further away, with a big aperture in
low light conditions, without flash.  You need to shoot fast because they
will get bored/move otherwise.  So, you want to ensure that they are all in
focus, but you don't have the time to play with the settings to ensure they
are all in focus.

So you crank up the ISO to get decent shutter speeds, and then bracket for
depth of field.  If this is the case, then I think it is not focus
bracketing you want, but aperture bracketing you need.  If so, that is a
fantastic idea!

There must be many people that try to shoot quickly in low light situations,
and shoot wide open at maybe F1.2, then realise that the DOF is so narrow
that they shot is a binner.  Aperture bracketing would be a great feature,
although the user would still need to know what they are doing and
understand shutter speeds.  ISO bracketing would also be useful.

BTW, RAW has it's capabilities.  Exposure is still very important.

I post a lot of sports picts from my kids playing because all of their
friends like seeing themselves.  But it's for the kids so I figure
"what the heck" and I have no thought that any of them are anything
beyond the snapshop level.  But the rest of the stuff I keep to a more-
or-less minimum.

OTOH, I have a friend who I think posts EVERY picture ever taken.  No
sorting (just tags) and not even cropping.  I have tried to explain
that to "hide" the good shots among the crap doesn't do anyone any
justice and that it would be better to post 10% of the pictures but
make them all into good shots.  But to no avail....

So, Ed, you're right.  It would explode and many, many people would
think that's a good thing.  Meanwhile, Randall would be saying "...
and you need all of this crap because ...?"

Being a old filmy from way back, I bracket when I need to, shoot RAW
when it's appropriate, and try to correct everything in the camera
BEFORE I take the picture.  I guess that's just plain old fashioned.

But I can see it coming.  Remember those old, high speed camera with
the rotary lenses.  You tripped the shutter and the lenses spun.
There were usually something like 9 lenses.  They acted like a
disposable, with a fixed shutter speed and apurature (but I think some
has an adjustable shutter speed).  When you took the picture, the
lenses spun and put down 9 images (1/9th normal size) on the same 35mm
image size, but each in a different part of the film -- in a 3X3
grid.  Each image ended up being something like the old 110 format
size.  Because you didn't have to move the film, it was a lightning
fast high-speed sequence and it was way beyond what the best motor
drives could do.

Maybe someone should start on a similar concept for digitals.  Put
each lense to a slightly different focus and aperature so you could
get your images down real quick.  And the person who would use it was
either (a) want real high speed or (b) doesn't care about quality so
it's a winner in either case.

I had one of those cameras at one time.  I wonder what happened to it.

If I focus on a static image, with a camera with a really reliable
focusing system, then of course I get focus right.

But most digital cameras do not have reliable manual focus
systems: the screen is not good enough, and there is no
split image rangefinder patch in the center. In this case, of
course, one can manually bracket focus.

But what I am really worrying about is the autofocus system.
At least with my 30D, it is not reliably perfect, especially with
flat subjects. It's adequate for people pictures, but it simply
is not perfect wide open at infinity. Its very close, but not perfect.
Its perfect at f/16, not f/4. This is what I really want
the bracket for.

And then there are action pics. For that I suppose follow focus
mode and burst shots are a form of focus bracket. I have not
yet tried such things, I should.

Because you might have focused on the nose, and the eyes are more than
an inch further back!  And depending on the timing, you may not be able
to focus precisely on the eyes each and ever time.  And the system isn't
really accurate to 1/32nd of an inch anyway.

Aperture bracketing wouldn't help, I don't have the light to stop down
any.  ISO bracketing wouldn't help, I'm already at max usable ISO.

NEED SOME DETAILS:

How many degrees of rotation of the focus ring would the focus
bracketing "range" need to cover?  And in what increments?  And would
that remain the same for all apertures and at all focal lengths?

What do you mean by "adequate for people pictures?"  Group shots?
Close-up's?  Macro, like with an eyeball?

IN GENERAL:

I think such a feature could only be useful for shots done on a
tripod.  With handheld, especially at shallow DOF's, your slight
camera position movements themselves would also affect focus and you
would be better off snapping off multiple shots in a row with the
focus locked.

For action, such a feature would not be useful because your subject
would always be moving and so your focus would need to change with
each shot anyway.  As you said, you could try "follow" or "tracking"
focus mode for that.

Ooohhh yes there is!  See here -
http://www.inweb.ch/foto/rawformat.html#background

I prefer to use the freeware 'Raw2Dng' to convert the Casio RAW to DNG
format as that offers a wider range of options in rendering software.
http://e2500.narod.ru/raw2dng_e.htm

The time to save the RAW file is ~6secs. (compared with ~70secs. for full
size Tiff) and you get JPEG as well.  You can trim that time down a bit by
selecting a smaller JPEG size and lower quality - 640x480 at 'Economy'
quality gets you ~4s between shots.
