Some of you know that some unsavory political forces have convinced
the House of Representatives to create a Big Brother committee to police
the thought of university professors who write about world affairs. The
bill is HR 3077. The main goal of this legislation is to impose an
ideological agenda on university teaching, research and writing about
issues like the Middle East. The point of the committee is to warp
academic study and ensure that independent researchers are not allowed
to be heard. But it was precisely the imposition of such ideological
litmus tests in Washington that led to the case of the missing Weapons
of Mass Destruction and the conviction that Iraq was 3 years away from
having a nuclear bomb, both propositions completely false. It would not
be doing the United States any favors to muzzle the academics, as well.

I plead with all the thousands of you who have expressed interest in
this site and read it frequently, to FAX your senator, or the senate
generally, expressing your conviction that this advisory committee be
excised from the final bill. Repeat: The message should be that HR 3077
is OK in general, but the "Advisory Board" stinks. The contact
information is below. An email is better than nothing, but the FAX is
what would get the job done.

The fact is that international studies in the United States is
extremely underfunded. Probably Federal spending on it annually is about
equivalent to buying two F-16e fighter jets. In the entire country, at
all universities and colleges. It is nothing compared to the need. Among
the main programs is Title VI, which funds over 100 area studies centers
at major universities. But it funds just 15 or so fully fledged Middle
East Centers, in the entire country! (A Middle East center typically has
20-30 faculty members who study the Middle East proper since 600 A.D.,
in various disciplines, though if you add in the scholars who work on
the ancient Near East and the people who work on the Caucasus and other
related areas, it might come to 60). Actually, usually a lot of the
money goes to language fellowships for graduate students. But since
nowadays it costs around $20,000 to pay tuition and a stipend even at a
state university, you can see that not many students can be funded for
Arabic or Persian language study at that rate.

When I came to the University of Michigan in 1984, we were able to
give about 20 such fellowships annually. The Reagan administration
annually zero-budgeted Title VI, which is to say that Reagan tried to
abolish Federal support for things like Middle East Studies altogether,
every year for 8 years. Congress always put the money back, but it did
not increase it at the rate of inflation. By the late 1990s, the
University of Michigan had been denied funding for its Center
altogether, and only 2 or 3 graduate students were being supported to
study Arabic, Persian, or Turkish. Now, these same old-time Reaganites
are coming and saying that we haven't done our jobs and need to be
watched.

Although the Middle East is a huge policy concern for the US now, we
probably don't have more than about 1,000 full time faculty members who
specialize in the area, know the languages, and write mainly about it.
That is a tiny group for a region stretching from Morocco to
Afghanistan, and needing to be covered for the past 1400 years.

The Neocons would have you believe that the Middle East specialists
at universities have fallen down on the job by not all becoming
terrorism experts. But none of the Neocons who did Middle East or South
Asian studies wrote their dissertations on anything to do with US
security, and most still have not contributed to its security--often
quite the opposite. Many of them were hand in hand with creating the
Afghan Mujahidin and al-Qaeda by throwing billions of dollars at such
groups in the 1980s. University professors mainly research in the areas
they teach, and most teaching jobs are for history or cultural studies.
This is what the students want, and nowadays universities pay attention
to student demand. These positions are largely at small liberal arts
colleges or private universities, and most are not supported by the
Federal government, so I should think those institutions can shape the
positions as they please. If the US government wanted lots of Arabists
at lots of security studies programs in universities, it should have
spent some money on that goal. It did not.

But it is also true that a significant part of the US government is
now busily reading the books and articles about the Middle East produced
by Middle East academics at US universities. Without that corpus of
literature, these brave and dedicated men and women would be flying
blind. Doing anything to gut this academic establishment would be
extremely self-defeating for a US that is going to be increasingly
engaged with the Middle East. The tack of trying to intervene in the
region without knowledge of it has been shown to be a disaster.

Frankly, the Federal government doesn't make use of the experts it
has. There are only a handful of us who write professionally about Iraq,
because for most of our lives it was hard to do field work there or get
access to primary sources. I could mention Peter Sluglett at Utah,
Yitzhak Nakash at Brandeis, and a handful of others. I don't know about
them, but I have never, ever even once been invited to a State
Department conference on Iraq. And, as we all know, even if I had been
it would not have mattered, since the Neocons at the Pentagon threw all
the work Tom Warrick at State had done on the Future of Iraq project
into the trash can and prevented Tom himself from going to join the CPA!
This is what I would have told anyone who had asked me a year and a half
ago about the pros and cons of going to war in Iraq.

So here's the alert :

The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee is
hoping to take up the Higher Education Act reauthorization in the next
two-three weeks. [Note that there is no separate subcommittee on higher
education on the HELP Committee, so the bill will be considered by the
full committee and then go to the floor.]

Opponents and proponents of the controversial Advisory Board
provision have been vigorously lobbying the Senate on this issue. If you
have not already written a letter to the Senate or telephoned a message,
NOW is the time. Write to your Member on the Senate HELP Committee (see
list below), or if your state is not represented on the committee, write
to Senators Gregg and Kennedy with a copy to your two Senators. Faxing
your letters will ensure timely receipt due to the recent ricin scare.
E-mailing is not recommended.

If you want to visit the real world instead of the rarefied
atmosphere of K Street, you can get a sense of what an actual Middle
East center is and does here.

A. The people who support the "Advisory Committee" argue that there
is extreme ideological bias in the teaching about Middle East studies
and other area studies fields at US universities. I have addressed many
of these charges in my article for the History News Network . Here is
what I wrote about Political Science:

Last spring Kurtz implicitly attacked the political scientists at the
Middle East Centers at American universities for being postmodernist,
leftist, anti-American terrorist-coddlers. The 14 or so tenured
professors of Middle East political science at the federally funded
National Resource Centers, however, include Leonard Binder of UCLA (who
fought on Israel's side in the 1948 war); Joel Migdal and Ellis Goldberg
at the University of Washington, Seattle (exponents of the New
Institutionalism and Rational Choice, respectively); Mark Tessler of the
University of Michigan (with a Ph.D. From Hebrew University, who
analyzes survey data quantitatively), Lisa Anderson and Gary Sick of
Columbia (comparative politics and policy studies, respectively; Sick is
a former naval officer and served on the National Security Council), and
so on. Of the fourteen, only one (Timothy Mitchell at New York
University) could be considered a postmodernist, and his work on the
Middle East from that framework has been illuminating. None of the
fourteen has ever to my knowledge supported any sort of terrorism.

That is to say, Middle East political science is an ideologically
highly diverse field, with lots of approaches represented. It is not
dominated by a single methodology or school, as was falsely charged. The
same thing is true for the other disciplines.

HR 3077 mandates that Title VI programs must "reflect diverse
perspectives and represent the full range of views on world regions,
foreign language, and international affairs."

This language is potentially disastrous.

As Stanley Fish has said, university teaching and research is not
about "balance." Our cancer institute isn't required to hire at least a
few biologists who believe smoking is good for your health. In research,
it is all right to be partisan for the evidence. It is in fact one of
the things wrong with journalism and political discourse that there is
so much emphasis on "telling both sides of the story." This is a bad
approach because many stories have many more than two sides, and some
stories only have one true side. Appointing a professor at each major
university who would have insisted in early 2003 that Iraq was only 3-5
years away from having a nuclear bomb would not have been an academic
advance, but it is the sort of thing the framers of HR 3077 had in mind
when they urged "balance."

I teach a course on War in the 20th Century Middle East at the
University of Michigan, and as a historian I have to admit that it is a
biased course, especially when we get to the 1990s. It is biased because
I despise the Taliban and al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein, and I certainly
do not properly give their side of the story. If what the Senate wants
is "balance," then we shall have to hire some of those unemployed
ex-Baathists to teach Iraqi history at the University of Michigan, to
offset my jingoistic pro-American approach. "Reflecting" "the full range
of views" would also require us to have more Communist, Nazi,
Holocaust-denying and Hamas professors. The Senate should be very
careful about putting into statute this language about "balance,"
because although the committee's supporters want to use it mainly as
affirmative action for Republican academics, there are lots of extremist
groups in US society that may find ways to use the language
perniciously. ( Contrary to the hype , there are plenty of Republican
academics, and try to find a leftist in any major Economics Department
or Business School in the country).

B. The people who argue for the Advisory Board charge
"anti-Americanism" in the classroom. But actually what they mean by that
if you pin them down is ambivalence about the Iraq war, or dislike of
Israeli colonization of the West Bank, or recognition that the US
government has sometimes in the past been in bed with present enemies
like al-Qaeda or Saddam. None of these positions is "anti-American," and
any attempt by a congressionally-appointed body to tell university
professors they cannot say these things (or that if they say them they
must hire someone else who will say the opposite) is a contravention of
the First Amendment of the US Constitution.

c. The "Advisory Committee" that HR 3077 sets up is unneeded. The
Department of Education already does oversight of the area studies
centers, and gives or withholds money according to whether they meet
government goals. Funding a whole extra committee is a waste of taxpayer
money and a clear duplication of effort. The Committee explicitly has
"investigatory" powers, which it is hard to see as anything other than
McCarthyism. Given Republican dominance of all three branches of
government, the committee is going to be highly politicized, and some
ideologues will probably be shoe-horned onto it.

Most troubling of all, the "advisory board" will have "investigative"
powers. These powers are clearly meant to intimidate US academics and
administrators, and some institutions are already talking of turning
down Federal money rather than submit to such tactics. You decide if the
country would be well served by a law that made it impossible for the
best universities to even take Federal funds for international studies.

Polite, accurate and thoughtful letters will be useful. Testimonials
and anecdotes based on fact can convey a lot. If you are unsure of HR
3077 details, go to:

You can follow proposed revisions by searching on HR 3077 through the
"Bill Search" function on the Senate web site.

Also a google search on HR3077 will bring up many sites with many
points of view.
