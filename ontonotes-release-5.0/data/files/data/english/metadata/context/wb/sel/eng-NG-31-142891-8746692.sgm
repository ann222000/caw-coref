Look at this Markie Sornson:

&quot;Controlled by 'the hand of Jehovah.' The Bible writers, therefore, came under
Jehovah’s 'hand,' or guiding and controlling power. (2Ki 3:15, 16; Eze 3:14, 22)
Even as Jehovah’s 'hand' could cause his servants to speak or to keep silent at
appointed times (Eze 3:4, 26, 27; 33:22), so it could stimulate writing or act
as a restraining force; it could prompt the writer to deal with certain matters
or restrict him from including other material. The end product would, in every
case, be that which Jehovah desired.&quot;

Yeah, that's right - written right there in black and white by a WTS publication
(Insight on the Scriptures).  This is about the Bible writers.  It plainly says
that the &quot;end product would, in every case, be that which Jehovah desired.&quot;

That's talking about the Bible sweetheart.  The very same Bible that authorized
divorces.  If the Bible authorized divorces then that must be &quot;that which
Jehovah desired.&quot;  The divorce authorization was controlled by &quot;the hand of
Jehovah.&quot;

That would be like saying that Jehovah desired all the bad courses and
faults that were written about.  Why can't Jehovah inspire truth in
writing instead of having to desire everything that was written?

You might want to ask the WTS.  They printed the book.  All I did is quote from
it.

Mark is very quick to call anyone in disagreement with the WTS a liar, but
just look how *he* hates to be called a liar.  The self-serving GB has him
believing he was appointed by God so whatever he does and says he sees as
right and correct for the sheeple.

Mark is used to lording over JWs at his KH.  He can't understand why I won't bow
down to his bullshit.  If I was aware of his deceptive tactics, I would have
nailed his ass much sooner.  All he can do now is tuck his tail between his legs
and ball up in a quivering mass of lying shame.

His usual tactic is to get the person off this NG and into private email so
he can &quot;handle&quot; them away from the rest of us.  Tell them anything without
interference from other JWs, lurkers, ex and anti-JWs.  Now he will most
likely fade back to lurk mode until someone else comes along.  Mark can
really make people angry with his arrogant know-everything attitude and how
cold blooded he is in his defense of the WTS/GB.  But don't take being
called a liar personally, he calls just about everyone who exposes the
WTS/GB a liar.  His &quot;blame the victim&quot; attitude is what really gets my goat.
No matter what the issue is, the GB is always right and the harmed person,
child, family are to blame.

But Mark, it's not personal abuse.  Your arrogance and denial of the truth
angers people and some will express that anger.  You've done it to me in the
past.  We're not forced to keep our opinions to ourselves here as are the
people in your KH.  This is the real world here, not a WT fantasyland.

See what I mean Mark?  He didn't put you down.  He proved you a liar,
something you never did to me yet called me a liar repeatedly.  It's OK for
you to insult others here, to make false accusations, but should something
happen to you, should your &quot;authority&quot; be questioned, or you're proved
wrong, you turn and snarl like mad dog at the person......

Yep, the windbags at the WTS added another 120 years to 1914.  What a
hoot!  :-D  The poor misled JWs who were waiting for 1975 got the shaft,
then 2000, shafted again... now this.  What happened to all their promised
and underlined scripture proving the generation who saw 1914 would not pass
away before &quot;the end of this system of things?&quot;  And they claim a clear
direct line to Jehovah!!!
How can any rational person be so gullible as to swallow this obvious male
bovine excreta?  This GB vomit....
