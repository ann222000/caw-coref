I have a 92 Bonneville SE that stalls when I pull up to a light, stop sign
etc.  It accelerates fine (normal) but when I let off gas it wants to
stall, the system monitor dings and the check engine light flashes on?????
Any ideas?  How do I get the error code from the check engine light?

I shorted the A &amp; B posts in the ECM and got 2 codes.  The first code was
"31".  Three flashes-pause-1 flash.  Then I got the code "58".  I can't
find any reference to the codes anywhere.  I double checked that these
were the correct flashes, pauses etc.  I need help!!!!  The car will idle
perfect for about 30 seconds to a minute then just quit.  It will restart
with no problem then do the same.

There is a good chance that any codes you get will be pretty
meaningless due to the engine running at low rpm and then quitting.
Do the usual (check and clean):
TPS, MAF, MAT, EGR, IAC, vac lines, throttle plate/body, plugs, wires,
air cleaner,  ...  ... etc.
My guess is the IAC is gunked up.

Code 31 according to the 91 Service manual says its the Park / Neutral
Switch circuit - but  it doesn't trip the SES light. There is no code 58
listed for 91.

I kind of agree with Paulie that the IAC might be dirty. The IAC only
operates at idle, step on the gas it disengages. Try cleaning it out
real good with Throttle Body cleaner or Gummout.
