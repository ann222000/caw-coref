Frankly, I'm afraid that even if I saw the damned tractor, I'd
have absolutely NO appreciation, so I must turn down the
demand of &quot;must see.&quot;

&gt; I, on the other hand, don't need to see it to appreciate it. I can

"/> appreciate it in a platonic manner without even looking!

John Deere tractors spell freedom and wickedness to me, because when I
was a kid and forbidden to start any tractors, we could start it WITHOUT
A KEY just by turning the flywheel. Poppa Momma! Like Mr. Frog, I was
in transports!

"/> John Deere tractor collectors are a rabid lot. They like to touch, feel,
climb on, pull levers, start up the engine, etc. before they even consider
buying a tractor. The &quot;must see to appreciate&quot; means that the collector
will lose all control when viewing the aforementioned tractor with all
its extra parts. I wonder if the paint job is still good.....
