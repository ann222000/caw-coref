I know this is not a genealogical question, but if if it's ok to ask/get answer:

1. What is the Azores Portuguese word for &quot;Sweetheart&quot;
2. Is Mosca the word and correct spelling for &quot;fly&quot;.  My grandmother used to go after flys w/swatter in hand, saying what sounded like &quot;Mooshka Diaube&quot; (devil fly).  Is mosca pronounced mooushe-ka?

1- Querido (a); 2-Namorado (a) (actually your girlfriend or boyfriend,
fiancé, etc.)
2- Yes to the spelling and yes to the pronunciation. Your grandmother
probably mumbled something like &quot;Corisca mosca do diabo!&quot; as she chased them with the

I don't think there is a word for &quot;Sweetheart&quot;.   There is Querido for darling, dear beloved or bem-amado (masculine) bem-amada (feminine) for well beloved or loved one.  It's probably how they phrase it.
Fly is spelled Môsca.  With the accent it is probably pronounced with the Mooshka sound.  That is the way I heard it.

John,
Your grandmother, in kidding kind of way, must have been going after a
female fly from Sao Miguel.
Since I was a kid, I remember people from Sao Miguel called &quot;coriscos&quot; by
those from Terceira.  And those from Sao Miguel calling those from
Terceira &quot;rabo tortos&quot; (something to do with their butts).

My Aunt told me not to say PORTAGEE instead of Porgtuguese.  She said this is a big insult if you say PORTAGEE.

My grandfather always referred to himself as a Portagee. I was suprised to learn some people have a
big issue with this. He grew up a farmer  and truck driver in Atwater, CA, then moved to Concord. CA and became real estate agent and broker. I was at a Holy Ghost in Hayward when this came up, so I wonder if it is a regional thing. Is it class related?  Anyone else have an opinion.

A family friend,who grew up in Red Bluff, CA,  Azorean and Mexican, like me, also called himself  Portagee as a simple description, without derision. He retired as a chief legal consul for the State of California, so a class based reaction doesn't seem likley

In my frame of reference, the word Portagee has always had a derogatory
connotation.  It is slang and not well accepted by those who have pride in  their
Portuguese roots.  On the other hand, I know of people who will refer  to
themselves as a Portagee but heaven forbid that anyone else call them that.

I agree with Kim. It's like calling an Italian a Dago and a Mexican a Spic.

Eric,

Definately not regional as I'm from Plymouth County MA and we had the same
thing over there. My grandmother used to use it also but I've also heard it
can be derogitory. I believe (though definately don't quote me on this) that
it had something to do about coming into being when there was a large influx
of portugese immigrants.

My dad grew up on a farm on the central California coast (Orcutt, which is near Santa Maria), and I remember him often using the term &quot;Portagee&quot; when referring to people of Portuguese descent, including himself.  I can also recall his sisters using the word in the same manner.  There wasn't any negative connotation or stigma attached.  I've read that &quot;Portagee&quot; was used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in California and other western states, to refer to Portuguese immigrants and did indeed have a negative inference.  It seems that over time the word has lost its sting and is now widely used in &quot;polite company&quot; as a general descriptive term.

It is acceptable in &quot;polite company&quot; (only between those of Portuguese
decent); but it is sure darn offensive and insulting to me hearing it from
someone who is not Portuguese.  Coincidently, last week I advised one of
my associates to use the word Portuguese and not Portugee when talking
about those of my ancestry.

This came up in another web site I belong to several years ago.Those
Portuguese on the East Coast are the ones who are particularly resentful to
the term, which they feel is very derogatory toward their race. It is like a
slang, such as ³wetback² for Mexican. Many don¹t know or understand where
that term came from either. As the illegals were being chased, they would
cross the Rio Grande River. They would continue the chase, looking at thenow
wet illegals, who had ³wet backs². Thus the term, meaning only that they
crossed the river in their attempts to get here.

In Hawaii, where my mother grew up, they always use the term Portagee. I
grew up with it and it was not considered derogatory. It was only a  name
for their people which was easier to say. I also have worked extensively in
Hawaii and have heard the term all the time, toward me and others. In
Hawaii, the Portuguese people who immigrated there worked in the cane fields
right along with the Kamaheinas and were considered ³one of them². Thus ther
term Hopa Haule was used. A white man going to the islands is considered a
Houle, a white man. A hopa is a half white and is accepted as one of them in
the islands. I have used the term lots of times when I was working and they
thought I was a houle. I would just inform them I¹m not houle, I¹m hopa.
That would do it. They would laugh and say ³You¹re Portagee aren¹t you¹.

So, after asking my mother, aunts, and a friend I worked with, the Capt in
Charge of Arson with Honolulu Fire Dept.., it was unanimous that the term is
not meant to insult the Portuguese.

Anyway, it is a regional thing. Don¹t use it anywhere. Just a month ago, I
was at the wedding of my nephew in Porterville, CA(San Joaquin Valley) and
while eating, I looked at my Uncle and said that they were a good match a
³Portagee and a Mexican². My uncle looked at me and just said ³Don¹t use
that term up here. They will take offense². That was the first time I have
run into that for this area. So, things have changed, apparently.

Hope that this Œconfuses the heck out of you².
Take care partner

Having been born in mainland Portugal - I have never heard the word &quot;Portagee&quot; until I read about it on this list.  I wonder if it was a term that was used in the early 1900's referring to portuguese immigrants.  Living on the East Coast and immigrating in the mid 1960's, I have never heard the word.  I can't say whether it find it offensive or not.  I have never run into anyone using the word.

Since Cliff brought up Hawaii - I have to tell a little story.  In 1984, my husband (who was born in the Azores) and I honeymooned in Hawaii and we were on an island tour and bus driver started telling jokes as we toured different areas.  The jokes started out as our polish jokes - for instance  - - how many pollacks does it take to change a lightbulb? - - However, every joke started &quot;how many portuguese&quot;.  My husband and I were shocked.  We had never before heard portuguese jokes.   Needless to say, we never did let anyone know we were portuguese.  I wish I knew then what  I know now - - - it would have been pretty interesting to get some portuguese immigrant history while I was there.

Gotta Love Wikipedia,
**
*Portagee* is a term often ascribed to persons of
Portuguese&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_people &gt;ancestry.
The term found usage during the major waves of Portuguese
immigration to the United States&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States &gt;,
from the late 1870s until the recent wave, which began in the 1960s.

Initially, the term found usage by Anglo-Saxons of the
WASP&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Anglo-Saxon_Protestant &gt;variety
in describing the immigrants from Southern
Europe &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Europe &gt; that they encountered
as fisherman and factory workers in New
England&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England &gt;and on farms in
California &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California &gt;. Although ethnically
white Caucasians, at the time, the Portuguese faced the same discrimination
and accusations of
non-Caucasian&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race &gt;heritage
that befell
Irish &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people &gt;,
Italians&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_people &gt;and
Jews &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews &gt; of that era.

While the term still carries a derogatory connotation in some parts of the
country, in other areas of the United States, persons of Portuguese descent
often call each other *Portagee* as a term of bonding and endearment. This
seems more common in New England, where Portuguese from the
Azores&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores &gt;and
Madeira &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira &gt; Islands have settled since
the late nineteenth century. More recent immigrants to New
Jersey&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey &gt;do not use the term as
much.

In California, a *portagee gate* characterized the tightwad stereotype
attributed to Portuguese immigrants. The gate involved flimsy construction,
implying that the Portuguese who made it attempted to save money in
purchasing materials. A 2004 biography by Charles Reis
Felix&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Reis_Felix &gt;,
entitled *Through A Portagee
Gate&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Through_A_Portagee_Gate&amp;act...; &gt;
*, makes reference to the usage of *portagee* as an ethnic term in
Massachusetts during the 20th century. Felix analyzes the term while
examining his own Portuguese-American roots and those of his father.

The term *portagee* also denotes a type of beans typically eaten by the
Portuguese, as well as a type of bread eaten with meals. The term supposedly
originated from a mispronunciation of the word *Portuguese* itself.
Residents of Hawaii &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii &gt; are also familiar
with the term, which was also applied in a derogatory fashion to Portuguese
workers from Madeira who harvested sugar cane on the islands.

Hi Eric,

I am so sorry I didn't mean to upset anybody.  Please forgive me.

My father was born &amp; raised in CA.  He worked in the farming (Cannery) industry ever since he got out of World War 11, and he refers to himself, his brothers and sisters as a Portagee's.  My cousin and I say it only to each other, not to anybody else.  It is just maybe said within some Portuguese families in the U.S. depending on the family.

My Aunt (his sister) who went to Portugal a few times told me this last year.  That it is a big insult to call a Portuguese person a Portagee when you are visiting Portugal or The Azores.  I don't know about calling a Portuguese person a Portaguee in the U.S.  It would depend on how well you know the person as to whether or not they think of it as an insult in the U.S.  She never explained it to me, but I could understand that it would be like a slap in the face if you go to another country and do not refer to the people in that country as one of there countrymen in the proper name.  It might be the old saying as in Rome do as the Romans would do.

My old boss in San Jose CA was born on Terceira (I hope I spelled it correctly) and in the 17 years that I have known her, her husband and her hole family (Mother, Brother, Sister, Children &amp; Portuguese Son In Law, Brother &amp; Sister in laws) I have never said the word Portagee to her or her family.  I just would never want to ever insult somebody.

I think it's like here in Louisiana.  The African American people refer to White people as crackers or I think honky.  And White people take that as an insult.  And if a White person would say any derogatory name (everybody knows what the derogatory names are for the African Americans so I don't have to put them in writing) to a African American person they would take it as an insult.

Again I am so sorry.  I didn't mean to insult anybody.  I will stay quiet as I usually did.

It is acceptable in &quot;polite company&quot; (only between those of Portuguese decent); but it is sure darn offensive and insulting to me hearing it from someone who is not Portuguese.  Coincidently, last week I advised one of my associates to use the word Portuguese and not Portugee when talking about those of my ancestry.

[AZORES-Genealogy] Re: Question on words

My dad grew up on a farm on the central California coast (Orcutt, which is near Santa Maria), and I remember him often using the term &quot;Portagee&quot; when referring to people of Portuguese descent, including himself.  I can also recall his sisters using the word in the same manner.  There wasn't any negative connotation or stigma attached.  I've read that &quot;Portagee&quot; was used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in California and other western states, to refer to Portuguese immigrants and did indeed have a negative inference.  It seems that over time the word has lost its sting and is now widely used in &quot;polite company&quot; as a general descriptive term.

I had an interesting experience with using the term 'Portagee' this past summer when I visited the Portuguese Cultural Museum and Festival in San Jose, CA.  Of course, I meant no offense, but I used it in the company of my 'adopted' Portuguese mom (her parents emigrated from Flores), referring to myself (my biological mom was half Portuguese--her dad was from São Jorge).  My adopted mom, altho she never actually objected, became VERY quiet when I used that term (which I used a couple of times, blush), so intuitively I knew it was inappropriate to use the word.

It is best not to use it at all I think.  Always good to play it safe...

Kim,

I'm glad you brought it up. I'm not offended. I was very surprised to find out it's insulting, as every family member and friend of Azorean origin used it casually my whole life. The term seemed to get exposure through the writings of California authors like John Steinbeck and Jack London. I remember a Jack London story, I forget which one , where he goes on a racist tear about &quot; the Portagees&quot; in San Leandro. He couldn't stand it that they would use there front yards  for gardens, and or grow things along the roadside. Or the way they had their own clubs and churches. But what really irked him was that they would come over stay with relatives , work hard, lease some farm land, then buy some of their own, and a house , then a business.  Like it's a bad thing!

Hi Eric,

I am so sorry I didn't mean to upset anybody.  Please forgive me.

My father was born &amp; raised in CA.  He worked in the farming (Cannery) industry ever since he got out of World War 11, and he refers to himself, his brothers and sisters as a Portagee's.  My cousin and I say it only to each other, not to anybody else.  It is just maybe said within some Portuguese families in the U.S. depending on the family.

My Aunt (his sister) who went to Portugal a few times told me this last year.  That it is a big insult to call a Portuguese person a Portagee when you are visiting Portugal or The Azores.  I don't know about calling a Portuguese person a Portaguee in the U.S.  It would depend on how well you know the person as to whether or not they think of it as an insult in the U.S.  She never explained it to me, but I could understand that it would be like a slap in the face if you go to another country and do not refer to the people in that country as one of there countrymen in the proper name.  It might be the old saying as in Rome do as the Romans would do.

My old boss in San Jose CA was born on Terceira (I hope I spelled it correctly) and in the 17 years that I have known her, her husband and her hole family (Mother, Brother, Sister, Children &amp; Portuguese Son In Law, Brother &amp; Sister in laws) I have never said the word Portagee to her or her family.  I just would never want to ever insult somebody.

I think it's like here in Louisiana.  The African American people refer to White people as crackers or I think honky.  And White people take that as an insult.  And if a White person would say any derogatory name (everybody knows what the derogatory names are for the African Americans so I don't have to put them in writing) to a African American person they would take it as an insult.

Again I am so sorry.  I didn't mean to insult anybody.  I will stay quiet as I usually did.

My grandfather always referred to himself as a Portagee. I was suprised to learn some people have a
big issue with this. He grew up a farmer  and truck driver in Atwater, CA, then moved to Concord. CA and became real estate agent and broker. I was at a Holy Ghost in Hayward when this came up, so I wonder if it is a regional thing. Is it class related?  Anyone else have an opinion.

A family friend,who grew up in Red Bluff, CA,  Azorean and Mexican, like me, also called himself  Portagee as a simple description, without derision. He retired as a chief legal consul for the State of California, so a class based reaction doesn't seem likley

Thank you and your grandmother for enlightening me. I am from
California, but every time I greet my Maui cousins they say &quot;eh
Podagee!&quot;, but I am grateful for your enlightenment I really do not
want to insult anyone in the Azores by being too familiar with them. I
think you are right, it is better to be formal by saying Portuguese
instead of Podagee.

Please do not be silent, you sparked one of the most enlightening
threads on this board for those of us wanting to interact with
archivists and distant cousins in the Azores.  It would be very
disappointing if I went there and only got cold shoulders because of a
faux pas.

I also heard it is impolite to ask where the &quot;toilet&quot; is but it is
better to use some other word, but darned if I can recall it....

In  Hawaii, where my mother grew up, they always use the term Portagee. I
grew up  with it and it was not considered derogatory. It was only a  name for
their people which was easier to say. I also have worked extensively in Hawaii
and have heard the term all the time, toward me and others. In Hawaii, the
Portuguese people who immigrated there worked in the cane fields right along
with the Kamaheinas and were considered “one of them”. Thus ther term Hopa
Haule was used. A white man going to the islands is considered a Houle, a  white
man. A hopa is a half white and is accepted as one of them in the  islands. I
have used the term lots of times when I was working and they  thought I was a
houle. I would just inform them I’m not houle, I’m hopa. That  would do it.
They would laugh and say “You’re Portagee aren’t you’.

I grew up in Hawaii...and I'll tell you that the workd Portagee was an
insult...I never heard it among my family.  Never heard anyone use it...but
believe me it was an insult....just lke budda head for the Japanese.

Hi Tom,

I always ask were is the ladies room please.  I was always raised to say those terms instead of the other terms for the restroom.  As you mention I always try to be formal as to not insult somebody.  It is better to be safe than sorry.

But I don't know what the term is for the restroom in Portugal or The Azores so you wouldn't insult somebody or be rude.

Here on the coast of San Mateo county at least, we call the part of a
fence that is a wire gate or wire gap a Portagee gate.  It might have
three of four barb wires going across, like the fence it it part of,
plus a couple of pickets to space the wires and keep them from tangling
when you draw it aside to open it. The wires are attached permanently
at one end to a post and then to a picket at the other end that is
joined top and bottom to with wire loops to a post that is set in the
ground.

And people of Azorean descent are Portagees. Or maybe were--I am
speaking of the older generation. I don't know how the newer immigrants
feel about the word.

But to old timers, that wire gap is still a Portagee gate.

When I was in the Azores I saw only one and took a picture of it. I
don't think the idea came from there because most of their fences are
rock walls!

I visited Chico this past summer and there is ruins of a stone built wall around the perimeter of the city that was built by the Portuguese--probably sometime in the 1800s--so my sister, who lives nearby in Forest Ranch, tells me.

I'm from Fall River, MA and let me tell you, when I was a kid, if someone called me or my friends a Portagee it was a fighting word.  It was definitely considered a slur especially if it came with a few adjectives before it.  As everyone should know, Cape Verdean's especially those in the New Bedford area, were colored in skin, considered themselves and rightfully so as Portuguese.  They were not afro/americans but Portuguese.  The caucasian portuguese in Fall River were at times called &quot;Black Portagee's&quot; by the Irish and French kids in the city.  Needless to say we had a lot of problems with that.  A common slur became a racist slur.  We went through it all. A common saying was &quot;What kind of geese don't fly&quot;?  and  the answer was &quot;portagees&quot;.  They even had tee shirts with this saying and depicted Daffy Duck flying.  It just made us more determined to succeed, and we did.  I think that there were a couple of movies about fisherman, one with Spencer Tracy, one with Gilbert Roland and Moby Dick that used the word &quot;Portagee&quot; to describe one of the sailors.  In the correct context it was o.k.  I guess in the correct context everything is acceptable.

Thank you Jack,
As in my family we would actually get in trouble if my father heard us kids calling each other a portugee!!  My youngest brother, ten years younger and the youngest of eight kids refers to himself as a portugee.  I just don't like to hear it..........maybe it has something to do with getting in trouble as a kid for saying it.

That is true.  I just came back from there for 11 days doing research.  It was rumored that the chinese built those walls so I have been told.  But now they think Portuguese built those walls.  They are beautiful.  I took a few pictures of them.  I will see if I can figure how to put the microchip from my camera into my computer and down load them and email them to everybody.

I purchased a book also that is on I think the Portuguese building those walls in Chico.  I haven't had time to take a look at it yet.

Mary,
The Portuguese gate you make reference to, over the years my father and I
built and installed probably 50 those on ranches my parents owned.  They
are easy to make, easy to use and very effective.  Years ago, most of the
Portuguese dairyman, at least in California, built these type of barbed
wire gates.

I agree I do not like my family and friends who are Portuguese referred as Portugee, it is not right. It is a disgrace to use the word Portugee. There is too much discrimination in this world. We should be proud of being Portuguese and our heritage. We are smart, intelligent, creative people etc. We should discuss the accomplishments and positive of being Portuguese.

It is acceptable in &quot;polite company&quot; (only between those of Portuguese decent); but it is sure darn offensive and insulting to me hearing it from someone who is not Portuguese.  Coincidently, last week I advised one of my associates to use the word Portuguese and not Portugee when talking about those of my ancestry.

[AZORES-Genealogy] Re: Question on words

My dad grew up on a farm on the central California coast (Orcutt, which is near Santa Maria), and I remember him often using the term &quot;Portagee&quot; when referring to people of Portuguese descent, including himself.  I can also recall his sisters using the word in the same manner.  There wasn't any negative connotation or stigma attached.  I've read that &quot;Portagee&quot; was used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in California and other western states, to refer to Portuguese immigrants and did indeed have a negative inference.  It seems that over time the word has lost its sting and is now widely used in &quot;polite company&quot; as a general descriptive term.

My grandfather always referred to himself as a Portagee. I was suprised to learn some people have a
big issue with this. He grew up a farmer  and truck driver in Atwater, CA, then moved to Concord. CA and became real estate agent and broker. I was at a Holy Ghost in Hayward when this came up, so I wonder if it is a regional thing. Is it class related?  Anyone else have an opinion.

A family friend,who grew up in Red Bluff, CA,  Azorean and Mexican, like me, also called himself  Portagee as a simple description, without derision. He retired as a chief legal consul for the State of California, so a class based reaction doesn't seem likley

Remember one thing. When my mother was growing up there, it was the late
1930¹s to early 1940¹s. She watched the bombing of Pearl. My Grandfather was
able to get the family on the first ship to leave Honolulu Harbor after it
was cleared. That was about May 1942. Now, when I was working over there,
that was in the late 70¹s to mid 1980¹s. That was when I had my personal
experience with the term. About two years ago, this came up on another web
site that I belong to and was ³hotly debated². Everyone voiced their
opinion. I have been in Hawaii and have first hand knowledge of what I said.
I have even called as early as two years ago, my friend who was in charge of
Honolulu Fire Dept Arson Detail. I asked him the question, as to whether the
term is still used and is it an insult or just a term. He confirmed what I
already knew, it¹s just a term for someone Portuguese. Normally, however, it
is not used for Œmainlanders¹ as then it would be an insult. It is used
between friends. As he told me, he is Korean, and he will call his good
friends Portagee, but only his friends. They, in turn, have nick names they
called him. So, I don¹t know what to say about this. I have heard that on
Maui, it is not a polite term. All I know is what I was told and what I have
experienced myself. As soon as I would say ³I¹m Portagee² I was accepted a
lot more then before. As an example, when I would be talking to a crew from
the Fire Dept with my friend the Capt. And I had to ask them questions about
the fire. Once I was able to get out that I was a ³Portagee² and that my
mother was raised there, they would start talking as if we were old friends.
That¹s all there is to it.

I think the Spencer Tracy Movie was Captain’s Courageous? I remember near the end of the movie where he was trapped in the rigging which had broken off and they had to cut the mast to save the ship and when they did he went under with the debris. The last seen had the memorial to the fisherman.

A term my grandfather and uncle use to use was “green horn” this referred to the newer Portuguese immigrants as compared to the ones who had been in the country for a number of years.

I'm from Fall River, MA and let me tell you, when I was a kid, if someone called me or my friends a Portagee it was a fighting word.  It was definitely considered a slur especially if it came with a few adjectives before it.  As everyone should know, Cape Verdean's especially those in the New Bedford area, were colored in skin, considered themselves and rightfully so as Portuguese.  They were not afro/americans but Portuguese.  The caucasian portuguese in Fall River were at times called &quot;Black Portagee's&quot; by the Irish and French kids in the city.  Needless to say we had a lot of problems with that.  A common slur became a racist slur.  We went through it all. A common saying was &quot;What kind of geese don't fly&quot;?  and  the answer was &quot;portagees&quot;.  They even had tee shirts with this saying and depicted Daffy Duck flying.  It just made us more determined to succeed, and we did.  I think that there were a couple of movies about fisherman, one with Spencer Tracy, one with Gilbert Roland and Moby Dick that used the word &quot;Portagee&quot; to describe one of the sailors.  In the correct context it was o.k.  I guess in the correct context everything is acceptable.

Portuguese in Hawaii

Before Hawaii became a state there were two kinds of schools.  One for  those
who spoke pidgen-English or poor Englilsh...the other school, the English
Standard  was for those who spoke good English.  It was almost like a  private
school.  I attended one of the few English Standard schools in  Honolulu.
These schools were primarly for the Haoles (white person or  Caucasian).  Chinese,
Japanese, Portuguese were tested by the principal -  tested to see that they
spoke good English.  I do not remember being  tested...but others remembered
the terrible ordeal.

In the years I attended this school there were very few Portuguese.  I  mean
a few.  There were more Japanese and Chinese than there were  Portuguese.  I
used to hear comments from older Portuguese family members  complain that the
Portuguese in Hawaii were a disgrace...it seemed they never  wanted to better
themselves - quitting school early, getting a job and getting  married - while
the orientals bettered themselves with education.  So many  doctors and
lawyers were Orientals...so few were Portuguese.

I have stock in 4 Hawaii companies.  Once a year I receive the Annual
Report...lots of pictures - pictures of the leading people in these  companies.
Most are Haoles (Caucasians) and orientals.  One seldom  sees a Portuguese name.

Now if the following is not discrimination I don't know what discrimination
is:   If you move to Hawaii and you are Greek, Italian, Turkish and  Spanish
(not hispanic) you are a Haole (Caucasian).  But if a Portuguese  moves to
Hawaii he is never a Haole.  One can read - yes, in a  newspaper,  &quot; Caucasians
were represented along with Japanese, Chinese and  Portuguese...&quot;

On my visits to Hawaii ( I do not have the Hawaiian accent- I can spot it a
mile away) if I meet some local people and I mention I am Portuguese, the
reply,  is, Oh, I thought you were a Haole.

I know that my cousins there would not stand for anyone calling them
Portagee.  They don't even like jokes about it. They think many  Portuguese in
Hawaii do not show respect for their racial background.  I know of others who keep
their mouths shut when called a Portagee...they  don;'t like it but rather
than make a fuss they keep quiet.

I don¹t know what years you were in High School, but my mother has told me
many times how she, her sister and elder brother went to the ³Portuguese
school McKinley High . They would not go to the ³white or Haole school²
because their younger brother and sister were not allowed there. You see,
when they moved to Hawaii, my Grandmother had married a Korean. That¹s the
reason they moved there to begin with. They were not bothered in Hawaii with
discrimination  since it was a common union of two different races. However,
when my Aunt Peggy and Uncle Billy were young, it was obvious that they were
not ³whites² or haole (thanks for the spelling by the way, I never can
remember the spelling of Haole).
Anyway, she told me to let people know that she went to Mc Kinley High,
instead of Roosevelt High School, which was mainly haole and children of
miltary or the wealthy in Honolulu. My mother told me that they wanted her
to go to Roosevelt but she refused. She was blonde hair blue eyed and very
pretty. She was also the First Princess of the Kamehameha Day parade(similar
to our Rose Parade). She sat on the float just below the Queen. I still have
a picture of her on the float.
So, I will put this the way she just said it on the phone. If a friend
called her Portagee, she really didn¹t get bothered about it. However if a
stranger called her the same thing, then it was insulting. So, it comes down
to this: it¹s not the word itself but who says it to whom that counts.
Hope I have expressed myself alright. Now, I have to go back to bedl

Good night all

Roosevelt at once time= before Hawaii became a state= had been an English
Standard High School. As I said it was like a private school.  It was  not only
for the Haoles and Military people...it was for those who could speak  good
English.  The only English Stand High school on Oahu.  If I had  been in
Honolulu I would have gone to Roosevelt.. My cousins went to Roosevelt  and one of
them who now lives in Fresno in 2005 went to Honolulu for her  class reunion.
That was the 60th class reunion and as she told me there  were not many left
who attended the reunion.  My cousin thinks there will  be one last reunion and
as they say in Hawai...pau...(finished).  Most of  her class reunions had been
in Las Vegas.  The Hawaii group flew to Las  Vegas for a small charge for the
flight and many gambled and others visited  friends in California.

Hope I have expressed myself alright. Now, I have to go back to bedl
Good night all

Portuguese in Hawaii

Before Hawaii became a state there were two kinds of schools.  One for those who spoke pidgen-English or poor Englilsh...the other school, the English Standard  was for those who spoke good English.  It was almost like a private school.  I attended one of the few English Standard schools in Honolulu.  These schools were primarly for the Haoles (white person or Caucasian).  Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese were tested by the principal - tested to see that they spoke good English.  I do not remember being tested...but others remembered the terrible ordeal.

In the years I attended this school there were very few Portuguese.  I mean a few.  There were more Japanese and Chinese than there were Portuguese.  I used to hear comments from older Portuguese family members complain that the Portuguese in Hawaii were a disgrace...it seemed they never wanted to better themselves - quitting school early, getting a job and getting married - while the orientals bettered themselves with education.  So many doctors and lawyers were Orientals...so few were Portuguese.

I have stock in 4 Hawaii companies.  Once a year I receive the Annual Report...lots of pictures - pictures of the leading people in these companies.  Most are Haoles (Caucasians) and orientals.  One seldom sees a Portuguese name.

Now if the following is not discrimination I don't know what discrimination is:   If you move to Hawaii and you are Greek, Italian, Turkish and Spanish (not hispanic) you are a Haole (Caucasian).  But if a Portuguese moves to Hawaii he is never a Haole.  One can read - yes, in a newspaper,  &quot; Caucasians were represented along with Japanese, Chinese and Portuguese...&quot;

On my visits to Hawaii ( I do not have the Hawaiian accent- I can spot it a mile away) if I meet some local people and I mention I am Portuguese, the reply, is, Oh, I thought you were a Haole.

I know that my cousins there would not stand for anyone calling them  Portagee.  They don't even like jokes about it. They think many Portuguese in Hawaii do not show respect for their racial background.   I know of others who keep their mouths shut when called a Portagee...they don;'t like it but rather than make a fuss they keep quiet.

I have not written anything on this topic because its a discussion that has
gone on for many times throughout my 55 years. In the Fall River area, where I
grew up, if a non-Portuguese called me a Portagee, he'd better be prepared to
die! Among ourselves we might refer to one another as hot tempered portagees
and make references to our Portagee tempers. Today, when a non-Portuguese
reefers to somebody or something as Portagee, I give them an ice-cold stare and
politely say, &quot;Do you mean Portuguese?&quot; The speaker usually looks very
embarrassed at being called on it.

Toni,

Your explanation sort of answers my question.  My experience with the &quot;portuguese jokes&quot; while in Oahu depicts how the hawaiians feel about the portuguese.  They considered them &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot;.

I had always heard the &quot;polish&quot; jokes.  I really don't have any idea how the polish jokes started, regarding the Polish as &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; but have read your post, it is probably the same reason.   Keep in mind that I have polish family members and don't consider them &quot;dumb&quot;.  I guess these ethnic jokes just get passed on one generation or another.

Thank you for enlightening me.

I have always been called a ³stubborn Portagee² by my mother. My father says
it¹s the German in me from his side. Who knows, which is more stubborn,
Portuguese or German. All I know is I get things done the way I like it.

I have seen references to &quot;greenhorn&quot; as a newcomer used in the
Portuguese community in the past. Is it still used? Anyone know the
origin?

My feeling is that it was sort of derogatory, like &quot;You greenhorn. You
haven't been here long enough to know how to act right!&quot;

Cliff,

It is probably the Portuguese in you.  My cousin says her and I are alike.  We are both stubborn and strong willed.  I tell her that it is the Portuguese in us, then tell her look at our parents (her mother and my dad are brother and sister).  Case in point.  Her Mother hasn't talked to her Brother (my dad) for about 20 years.  When his brothers and sisters started to die he stopped contact with the living brothers and sistersand didn't go to the funerals .  You mention death in front of my Dad or I and you can clear the room faster than anything.

I've heard it used from time to time, but more in a jesting than mean way,
kind of like the old game of dozens.  The usage is generation relative, not
absolute.  Immigrants from the 20's used it to describe immigrants of the
60s, and I've heard 60's immigrants use it to describe80's/90's.

I think greenhorn was used to define immigrants in total and not just
Portuguese immigrants.  The greenhorn reference goes back to the 1700's or
earlier.  Sometimes &quot;Green Bean&quot; is used instead of &quot;green horn&quot;
