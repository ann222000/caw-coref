Hi Guys, English is gone the 1st half of Saturday, so what I think I
might do is come hang out after she gets back. If I show up too late
I'll sit the adventure out but I'd at least like to come by and
socialize. I'm very interested in pursuing this Base thing. Have the
Impossibles begun designing their base? I've accumulated 6-7 salvages
(all Tech) so far and am on the fence about putting around with it
myself (and burning a bunch of influence) or going to straight to
another SG (and possibly loosing some autonomy). The other option is to
actively recruit people to build up &quot;the Patriots&quot;. I would imagine that
recruiting is going to be very competitive with the new setup.

Steve

P.S I won't be on tonight. I'm taking my girls out to &quot;the Incredibles
on Ice&quot; down at Phillips. Redfist is a stone's throw from 36 though so
I'm dying to jump on and get those last few XP

They're not accepting submission for Featured Screenshots any more! I
was gonna send this one, with the caption: &quot;I wonder what this big red
button does?&quot;

I may be weird, but around here, it's barely noticeable.

"/> Sounds like me last night with Standing Water. He was a stone's throw
from level 12 so I got him there and then went to bed.

I should be online tonight looking to kick some butt.

Yes, the Impossibles are hard at work on their base. Not sure how far
they've gotten -- I'm not in that game.

"/> I'm guessing that we're going to be treated to a Supergroup recruiting
drive like we've never seen before. Standards will be dropped in favor
of pure numbers, as groups compete to max out their membership. From a
player standpoint, you'll have to be a lot more careful about which group
you choose to join, as many of them will exist only for the purpose of
building a base, and not necessarily for team play.

"/> I'm sure Adam can get you into things without too much trouble, unless
you show up just as we're wrapping up. :)

"/> Yep. Already underway, but given how much prestige is needed, and how
much everything costs, and how slow it is to earn prestige, it's gonna
be a while til we have anything at all impressive. You do know all base
costs are paid for with prestige, not influence, right? And you can
only earn prestige by being in a SG and playing in supergroup mode.

"/> You'd really be better off joining a good, established SG. Even though
it would do us good to fill up the roster for the Impossibles, we're
still gonna keep our high standards. If we need to fill up to 75 just
to rack up prestige, we'll do it by adding people's alts to the main SG.

"/> I'm going to recommend to the Imps leadership that we go ahead and load
up the main SG with as many alts as will fit and be played, so we can
get maximum prestige earning going on. You've got a good point here, in
that SG's will be looking to maximize their rosters.

The good ones, such as the Imps and (I'm guess) Alliance of Heroes and
Adeptus Arbites, will probably load up their main group with alts from
within their membership, rather than lowering their standards and
accepting anyone that'll play and earn prestige.
