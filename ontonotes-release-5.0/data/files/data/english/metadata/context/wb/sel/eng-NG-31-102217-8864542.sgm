Short Sale investors are gobbling up properties at HUGE DISCOUNTS all
across the nation. Banks are practically giving away houses to anyone
who asks.
Imagine acquiring real estate with no credit checks, or income
verifications, and it's virtually Risk Free.
It wasn't too long ago that I was working at a job, making $10/hr.
barely having enough to cover my monthly bills. I was finishing up my
Bachelor's degree at the time, and I was thinking to myself, there
must be a better way, when it finally hit me. If I wanted my income to
change, I had to change my habits. I did not want to be stuck at a
dead end job all day, living paycheck to paycheck. I wanted the DREAM!
I wanted the freedom to do those things that I wanted to do, and live
the lifestyle that was fit for me.
So I did what most of us would do, I went to the bookstore and began
reading books on how to make money. Those books eventually lead to
seminars, boot-camps and intensive workshops. I attended every seminar
possible. I was what they called a seminar junkie, however, I also
knew the education was priceless and would return ten fold. At one of
the boot camps I attended, I listed to a gentleman talk about a unique
strategy called a Short Sale. I knew right then, this was for me. So I
paid the $495.00 and received a little booklet on how to do a short
sale. You won't believe what happened next!
I made $12,632 on my first deal!
I began to send out letters and made $12,632 on my first deal without
ever verifying income. I was so excited I even took a picture of it. I
began to realize that for the amount of time I put into it, the
returns were very profitable. Plus, I was my own boss so my income
potential was unlimited, and I was helping people. In fact, that's
another reason why I'm sharing this with you. Everyone deserves an
opportunity like this, to live the dream we are all capable of living.
And $21,960 on my second deal!
