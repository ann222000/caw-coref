So Anna has a great friend of hers that she has known for a few years
now. and he turns around and hurts her, he cheated on her and the
other girl new the whole time about Anna yet she did nothing. the
other girl turned out to be her closest and best friend Emma. Anna
didn't know what to do so she ran a hind from them all, but to where
did she go? and from there she called a friend whom she had just met
online ask him for
a favor, to come get her and take her to his house that she would
explain in
the car ride. she didn't know is that he cared about her more then
she
knew............. He picked her up in a hummer and bought her flowers
then......... He picked her up in a hummer and bought her flowers
then......... they went back to his two story house, out in the middle
of a forest.
she by now was crying non-stop. he didn't know what all to do so he
held
her nice and gentle but close and tight to him. a rush went through
her like........ a rush went through her like a cold water fall but
this rush of cold water felt like something different. not the
same as if she just got up rush but as if she was very hot and need
to
cool of so she relaxed and let her tears flow. he knew this would
change everything they had. that from here on out their friendship
was
important to Anna and he had no clue what he started. nor did she but
that's when that first guy comes back &quot; Cody what are you doing
here!?!
how did you find me?!&quot; Anna yelled at him and she thought of running
but her favor friend was holding on tight to her so she wouldn't she
didn't know what she did so she ran away again when she got back to
the
school she waited a few hours and called him again. and called him
back just to hear the person she has been trying to get
away from-Cody. she tells him.......... she tells him &quot;is this all
life's about? I run away?&quot; then went to the
top roof of the school. &quot;if I jump, it would all end Cody&quot; Cody was
still in the other line&quot; don't jump! please stay on the line!&quot; but it
was too late, she jumped and..... there was her friend [by the way his
name is matt.] who was at the
spot just getting out of his car and he caught her telling her that
he
cared about her not to do that again. He said 2 her: I love you honey!
Do you want to marry me? Then she said to
him. no I hate you look like a monkey funny to her but it crashed him.
when she realized he was being serous,
she turned to him to kiss him but he said I thought u said no! she
said
I didn't know u where for ever. I am sorry but I will need some time
to
think and he kisses her and brings her back to his house where Cody
is
waiting for them. matt tells him to get off his yard before I call
the
cops. Cody leaves just after saying &quot; if u don't care then why were u
so hurt? we u playing me? or did I do all that myself.&quot; and left to
never be heard/seen again and to leave her alone and get out of her
life ,now matt holds her in his strong but gentle arms and tells her
that he will
always be here for her no matter what. she says yes! I will. I love
you. he
doesn't understand at first, making a face and then he realizes she
just
agreed to marry him. he kisses her on the forehead- he is taller then
her by
a few inches- and hugs her again and says thank you I love you too.
and then they announce that they will  marry on September the 6 ! The
wedding day came. All the guests arrived, including a rather strange
looking man, who
sat right at the back.

Page 2
This man was Anna's father who ran and left her when she was young and
he can
once he heard about her to see how she was and what she was doing....
he was nervous. . . but he wish to his daughter the best for her. . .
A man in a white suit entered, he was tall, and handsome, and had a
weird smile on his lips. No one recognized him. He sat down next to
Anna's father, who was to deep in his own thoughts to notice this. the
man was here for a reason but what no one new. The wedding started
with all due pomp and circumstance... later on when they were settled
in a house and Anna found out she was pregnant with a  girl who was
going to be different as the doctors told her. she and
matt wouldn't listen to them for they new that the child was perfect
no
matter what anyone else said about her.
On the day of birth Anne's parents called her &quot;where the hell have you
been for da
past four years? Your only 16 an you have a child?&quot;
&quot;Mom, I'm old enough to make my own choices!&quot;
&quot;When where u planning to tell me you had intercourse?&quot;
&quot;what is that?&quot;
&quot;Sex!&quot;
The baby was born, it was ... different ... but Anna still loved it,
and she was very upset when the doctors told her that it had to be put
in
an incubator. She was still nervous for most of that night. In the
morning she demanded to see the baby. They took her to her child, but
it had
gone. Naturally she was distraught, her husband angry and the
hospital
security feeling really stupid. They had a look at the CCTV, which
went blank at the time of the kidnapping, but before then it showed a
man in a white suit entering the hospital, but not leaving this is the
very same man who was at the wedding sitting by anna'a father.
Matt demanded that everyone goes to lock down mode and that the police
help
to find his child that was just stolen. anna agrees but at the same
time
thinks he might be over reacting a little bit. alll in all the police
come,
the hosptial goes into lock down mode, and they begin the search. when
matt
walks into  a secret room and desides to follow it Matt walks down
this secret passageway for what fells like forever.
For some reason though, the thought of turning back never crosses his
mind. he reaches the end of the passageway, it is a very dimly lit
room with a big statue of a cloaked men. he cant see the mans face
because the cloack is shading it. but matt just
ignores the staue and goes on through a hallway when he hears a babies
cry. He can hear crying but can not tell where it is coming from; he
searches around franticly, and eventually arrives in an underground
tunnel, where he sees a white car driving away. A shadow dislodges
itself from the wall and. this thing jumps at him with both a gun and
a small dagger in his hands. matt
tryies not to get hurt but at the same time he just wants to go follow
that
car. he ends up getting knocked out and wakes up at some strange place
he has
not ever seen before. and has a look around. He seems to be in a very
wet forest. Wet, and foresty. Now he is
really confused, he guesses that he must be in the park, but some of
the trees look a bit strange... He can hear no form of life, the
silence is crushing. He looks up to find a big hairy thing over him
and he jumpps out of the way and tryies
to run but...
The creature that was above him jumped down on him and pinned him to
the
ground then a voice came from in front of him saying &quot;Down boy!&quot; The
creature got off him. A tall silhouette was standing
in front of him &quot;Now what do we have here?&quot;
As it turns out, the little girl was born blind. She would never see
the face of her mother, or anyone esle's for that matter.
Matt gets up shakily, &quot;Who, who are you?&quot;. The stranger laughs, &quot;Who
am I? That's a fine question to ask. I may even consider answering
it.
For now, however, you must be content with &quot;Your Savior&quot; Now come,
quickly, we have little time.&quot; The mysterious man swirled off, Matt
had to run to keep up, &quot;Where are we going? I demand to know what's
going on!&quot; &quot;You'll find out in good time, now shush, before I seal
your mouth for you.''
The little girl was born blind. She had to grow up without the face
of
her mother. Especially since the girl had been kidnapped by mysterious
forces she
was even less likely to know the face of her mother... And so the
story looks to a new character, Cain, he was a water troll assigned
to
looking after this little girl. He did not know what the evil forces
intentions where, he himself had been kidnapped, he guessed it was
with the intentions to raise the child. She had not been given a name
so he gave her one, Millie.
Meanwhile Matt followed the cloaked stranger in silence pondering the
condition of his new born daughter, and how his wife was faring in
hospital. And, suddenly the stranger had turned around, but instead of
walking
towards Matt, he simply turned in a different direction. Matt
followed. Wherever it was they were going it seemed to be getting
darker....
Matt put that down to being the time of day. He wished his new
acquaintance would be a bit more conversational, it was starting to
annoy him now. Every time he started talking he would get hushed. The
stranger slowed, they had reached their destination it was a hiden
place for people of all types. these people were what
looked like al diferent but at the same time they all had the same
look in there eye. this was a look matt wish he knew it was not love
nor hate. but of a kindness he was not sure........it was of
selflessness. ..... He saw a pretty young lady, humming softly as she
washed her clothes.
She turned to him startled at his presence. He tried to guess her
age...to pretty and confident to be 15 or 16...but no doubt the way
she carried herself that she was a woman in high position. Finally he
guessed around late teens early. But there was still the awkward way
she looked, like maybe sometime in the distant past she was hurt, and
was still watching her back, waiting for it to come back and get her.
The thought of someone hurting the lady infuriated him. Oddly enough,
he wanted to protect her from whatever had hurt her. He realized that
she was staring at him. But the stranger who found him was pretty
incessant so they moved on.
The further into this place (wherever it was) they got the more
activity there was. Soon He was having difficulty pushing through the
crowd which seemed to part for the the stranger. They were
approaching
a raised building where all the activity seemed to stem from. The
building seemed to glow an aura of power with one glance Matt realized

&gt; ground then a voice came from in front of him saying &quot;Down boy!&quot; The
&gt; creature got off him. A tall silhouette was standing
&gt; in front of him &quot;Now what do we have here?&quot;
&gt; As it turns out, the little girl was born blind. She would never see
&gt; the face of her mother, or anyone esle's for that matter.
&gt; Matt gets up shakily, &quot;Who, who are you?&quot;. The stranger laughs, &quot;Who
&gt; am I? That's a fine question to ask. I may even consider answering
&gt; it.
&gt; For now, however, you must be content with &quot;Your Savior&quot; Now come,
&gt; quickly, we have little time.&quot; The mysterious man swirled off, Matt
&gt; had to run to keep up, &quot;Where are we going? I demand to know what's
&gt; going on!&quot; &quot;You'll find out in good time, now shush, before I seal
&gt; your mouth for you.''
&gt; The little girl was born blind. She had to grow up without the face
&gt; of
&gt; her mother. Especially since the girl had been kidnapped by mysterious
&gt; forces she
&gt; was even less likely to know the face of her mother... And so the
&gt; story looks to a new character, Cain, he was a water troll assigned
&gt; to
&gt; looking after this little girl. He did not know what the evil forces
&gt; intentions where, he himself had been kidnapped, he guessed it was
&gt; with the intentions to raise the child. She had not been given a name
&gt; so he gave her one, Millie.
&gt; Meanwhile Matt followed the cloaked stranger in silence pondering the
&gt; condition of his new born daughter, and how his wife was faring in
&gt; hospital. And, suddenly the stranger had turned around, but instead of
&gt; walking
&gt; towards Matt, he simply turned in a different direction. Matt
&gt; followed. Wherever it was they were going it seemed to be getting
&gt; darker....
&gt; Matt put that down to being the time of day. He wished his new
&gt; acquaintance would be a bit more conversational, it was starting to
&gt; annoy him now. Every time he started talking he would get hushed. The
&gt; stranger slowed, they had reached their destination it was a hiden
&gt; place for people of all types. these people were what
&gt; looked like al diferent but at the same time they all had the same
&gt; look in there eye. this was a look matt wish he knew it was not love
&gt; nor hate. but of a kindness he was not sure........it was of
&gt; selflessness. ..... He saw a pretty young lady, humming softly as she
&gt; washed her clothes.
&gt; She turned to him startled at his presence. He tried to guess her
&gt; age...to pretty and confident to be 15 or 16...but no doubt the way
&gt; she carried herself that she was a woman in high position. Finally he
&gt; guessed around late teens early. But there was still the awkward way
&gt; she looked, like maybe sometime in the distant past she was hurt, and
&gt; was still watching her back, waiting for it to come back and get her.
&gt; The thought of someone hurting the lady infuriated him. Oddly enough,
&gt; he wanted to protect her from

&gt; &gt; &gt; other girl new the whole time about Anna yet she did nothing. the
&gt; &gt; &gt; other girl turned out to be her closest and best friend Emma. Anna
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn't know what to do so she ran a hind from them all, but to where
&gt; &gt; &gt; did she go? and from there she called a friend whom she had just met
&gt; &gt; &gt; online ask him for
&gt; &gt; &gt; a favor, to come get her and take her to his house that she would
&gt; &gt; &gt; explain in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the car ride. she didn't know is that he cared about her more then
&gt; &gt; &gt; she
&gt; &gt; &gt; knew............. He picked her up in a hummer and bought her flowers
&gt; &gt; &gt; then......... He picked her up in a hummer and bought her flowers
&gt; &gt; &gt; then......... they went back to his two story house, out in the middle
&gt; &gt; &gt; of a forest.
&gt; &gt; &gt; she by now was crying non-stop. he didn't know what all to do so he
&gt; &gt; &gt; held
&gt; &gt; &gt; her nice and gentle but close and tight to him. a rush went through
&gt; &gt; &gt; her like........ a rush went through her like a cold water fall but
&gt; &gt; &gt; this rush of cold water felt like something different. not the
&gt; &gt; &gt; same as if she just got up rush but as if she was very hot and need
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; cool of so she relaxed and let her tears flow. he knew this would
&gt; &gt; &gt; change everything they had. that from here on out their friendship
&gt; &gt; &gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; important to Anna and he had no clue what he started. nor did she but
&gt; &gt; &gt; that's when that first guy comes back &quot; Cody what are you doing
&gt; &gt; &gt; here!?!
&gt; &gt; &gt; how did you find me?!&quot; Anna yelled at him and she thought of running
&gt; &gt; &gt; but her favor friend was holding on tight to her so she wouldn't she
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn't know what she did so she ran away again when she got back to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; school she waited a few hours and called him again. and called him
&gt; &gt; &gt; back just to hear the person she has been trying to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; away from-Cody. she tells him.......... she tells him &quot;is this all
&gt; &gt; &gt; life's about? I run away?&quot; then went to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; top roof of the school. &quot;if I jump, it would all end Cody&quot; Cody was
&gt; &gt; &gt; still in the other line&quot; don't jump! please stay on the line!&quot; but it
&gt; &gt; &gt; was too late, she jumped and..... there was her friend [by the way his
&gt; &gt; &gt; name is matt.] who was at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; spot just getting out of his car and he caught her telling her that
&gt; &gt; &gt; he
&gt; &gt; &gt; cared about her not to do that again. He said 2 her: I love you honey!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you want to marry me? Then she said to
&gt; &gt; &gt; him. no I hate you look like a monkey funny to her but it crashed him.
&gt; &gt; &gt; when she realized he was being serous,
&gt; &gt; &gt; she turned to him to kiss him but he said I thought u said no! she
&gt; &gt; &gt; said
&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't know u where for ever. I am sorry but I will need some time
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; think and he kisses her and brings her back to his house where Cody
&gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; waiting for them. matt tells him to get off his yard before I call
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; cops. Cody leaves just after saying &quot; if u don't care then why were u
&gt; &gt; &gt; so hurt? we u playing me? or did I do all that myself.&quot; and left to
&gt; &gt; &gt; never be heard/seen again and to leave her alone and get out of her
&gt; &gt; &gt; life ,now matt holds her in his strong but gentle arms and tells her
&gt; &gt; &gt; that he will
&gt; &gt; &gt; always be here for her no matter what. she says yes! I will. I love
&gt; &gt; &gt; you. he
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't understand at first, making a face and then he realizes she
&gt; &gt; &gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; agreed to marry him. he kisses her on the forehead- he is taller then
&gt; &gt; &gt; her by
&gt; &gt; &gt; a few inches- and hugs her again and says thank you I love you too.
&gt; &gt; &gt; and then they announce that they will  marry on September the 6 ! The
&gt; &gt; &gt; wedding day came. All the guests arrived, including a rather strange
&gt; &gt; &gt; looking man, who
&gt; &gt; &gt; sat right at the back.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Page 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; This man was Anna's father who ran and left her when she was young and
&gt; &gt; &gt; he can
&gt; &gt; &gt; once he heard about her to see how she was and what she was doing....
&gt; &gt; &gt; he was nervous. . . but he wish to his daughter the best for her. . .
&gt; &gt; &gt; A man in a white suit entered, he was tall, and handsome, and had a
&gt; &gt; &gt; weird smile on his lips. No one recognized him. He sat down next to
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anna's father, who was to deep in his own thoughts to notice this. the
&gt; &gt; &gt; man was here for a reason but what no one new. The wedding started
&gt; &gt; &gt; with all due pomp and circumstance... later on when they were settled
&gt; &gt; &gt; in a house and Anna found out she was pregnant with a  girl who was
&gt; &gt; &gt; going to be different as the doctors told her. she and
&gt; &gt; &gt; matt wouldn't listen to them for they new that the child was perfect
&gt; &gt; &gt; no
&gt; &gt; &gt; matter what anyone else said about her.
&gt; &gt; &gt; On the day of birth Anne's parents called her &quot;where the hell have you
&gt; &gt; &gt; been for da
&gt; &gt; &gt; past four years? Your only 16 an you have a child?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mom, I'm old enough to make my own choices!&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;When where u planning to tell me you had intercourse?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;what is that?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sex!&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; The baby was born, it was ... different ... but Anna still loved it,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and she was very upset when the doctors told her that it had to be put

&gt; &gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; an incubator. She was still nervous for most of that night. In the
&gt; &gt; &gt; morning she demanded to see the baby. They took her to her child, but
&gt; &gt; &gt; it had
&gt; &gt; &gt; gone. Naturally she was distraught, her husband angry and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; hospital
&gt; &gt; &gt; security feeling really stupid. They had a look at the CCTV, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; went blank at the time of the kidnapping, but before then it showed a
&gt; &gt; &gt; man in a white suit entering the hospital, but not leaving this is the

&gt; &gt; &gt; very same man who was at the wedding sitting by anna'a father.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Matt demanded that everyone goes to lock down mode and that the police
&gt; &gt; &gt; help
&gt; &gt; &gt; to find his child that was just stolen. anna agrees but at the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; thinks he might be over reacting a little bit. alll in all the police
&gt; &gt; &gt; come,
&gt; &gt; &gt; the hosptial goes into lock down mode, and they begin the search. when
&gt; &gt; &gt; matt
&gt; &gt; &gt; walks into  a secret room and desides to follow it Matt walks down
&gt; &gt; &gt; this secret passageway for what fells like forever.
&gt; &gt; &gt; For some reason though, the thought of turning back never crosses his
&gt; &gt; &gt; mind. he reaches the end of the passageway, it is a very dimly lit
&gt; &gt; &gt; room with a big statue of a cloaked men. he cant see the mans face
&gt; &gt; &gt; because the cloack is shading it. but matt just
&gt; &gt; &gt; ignores the staue and goes on through a hallway when he hears a babies
&gt; &gt; &gt; cry. He can hear crying but can not tell where it is coming from; he
&gt; &gt; &gt; searches around franticly, and eventually arrives in an underground
&gt; &gt; &gt; tunnel, where he sees a white car driving away. A shadow dislodges
&gt; &gt; &gt; itself from the wall and. this thing jumps at him with both a gun and
&gt; &gt; &gt; a small dagger in his hands. matt
&gt; &gt; &gt; tryies not to get hurt but at the same time he just wants to go follow

&gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; car. he ends up getting knocked out and wakes up at some strange place
&gt; &gt; &gt; he has
&gt; &gt; &gt; not ever seen before. and has a look around. He seems to be in a very
&gt; &gt; &gt; wet forest. Wet, and foresty. Now he is
&gt; &gt; &gt; really confused, he guesses that he must be in the park, but some of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the trees look a bit strange... He can hear no form of life, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; silence is crushing. He looks up to find a big hairy thing over him
&gt; &gt; &gt; and he jumpps out of the way and tryies
&gt; &gt; &gt; to run but...
&gt; &gt; &gt; The creature that was above him jumped down on him and pinned him to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; ground then a voice came from in front of him saying &quot;Down boy!&quot; The
&gt; &gt; &gt; creature got off him. A tall silhouette was standing
&gt; &gt; &gt; in front of him &quot;Now what do we have here?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As it turns out, the little girl was born blind. She would never see
&gt; &gt; &gt; the face of her mother, or anyone esle's for that matter.

&gt; &gt; &gt; tunnel, where he sees a white car driving away. A shadow dislodges
&gt; &gt; &gt; itself from the wall and. this thing jumps at him with both a gun and
&gt; &gt; &gt; a small dagger in his hands. matt
&gt; &gt; &gt; tryies not to get hurt but at the same time he just wants to go follow

&gt; &gt; &gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; car. he ends up getting knocked out and wakes up at some strange place
&gt; &gt; &gt; he has
&gt; &gt; &gt; not ever seen before. and has a look around. He seems to be in a very
&gt; &gt; &gt; wet forest. Wet, and foresty. Now he is
&gt; &gt; &gt; really confused, he guesses that he must be in the park, but some of
&gt; &gt; &gt; the trees look a bit strange... He can hear no form of life, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; silence is crushing. He looks up to find a big hairy thing over him
&gt; &gt; &gt; and he jumpps out of the way and tryies
&gt; &gt; &gt; to run but...
&gt; &gt; &gt; The creature that was above him jumped down on him and pinned him to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; ground then a voice came from in front of him saying &quot;Down boy!&quot; The
&gt; &gt; &gt; creature got off him. A tall silhouette was standing
&gt; &gt; &gt; in front of him &quot;Now what do we have here?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; As it turns out, the little girl was born blind. She would never see
&gt; &gt; &gt; the face of her mother, or anyone esle's for that matter.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Matt gets up shakily, &quot;Who, who are you?&quot;. The stranger laughs, &quot;Who
&gt; &gt; &gt; am I? That's a fine question to ask. I may even consider answering
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; For now, however, you must be content with &quot;Your Savior&quot; Now come,
&gt; &gt; &gt; quickly, we have little time.&quot; The mysterious man swirled off, Matt
&gt; &gt; &gt; had to run to keep up, &quot;Where are we going? I demand to know what's
&gt; &gt; &gt; going on!&quot; &quot;You'll find out in good time, now shush, before I seal
&gt; &gt; &gt; your mouth for you.''
&gt; &gt; &gt; The little girl was born blind. She had to grow up without the face
&gt; &gt; &gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; her mother. Especially since the girl had been kidnapped by mysterious

&gt; &gt; &gt; forces she
&gt; &gt; &gt; was even less likely to know the face of her mother... And so the
&gt; &gt; &gt; story looks to a new character, Cain, he was a water troll assigned
&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; looking after this little girl. He did not know what the evil forces
&gt; &gt; &gt; intentions where, he himself had been kidnapped, he guessed it was
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the intentions to raise the child. She had not been given a name
&gt; &gt; &gt; so he gave her one, Millie.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Meanwhile Matt followed the cloaked stranger in silence pondering the
&gt; &gt; &gt; condition of his new born daughter, and how his wife was faring in
&gt; &gt; &gt; hospital. And, suddenly the stranger had turned around, but instead of
&gt; &gt; &gt; walking
&gt; &gt; &gt; towards Matt, he simply turned in a different direction. Matt
&gt; &gt; &gt; followed. Wherever it was they were going it seemed to be getting
&gt; &gt; &gt; darker....
&gt; &gt; &gt; Matt put that down to being

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So Anna has a great friend of hers that she has known for a few
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now. and he turns around and hurts her, he cheated on her and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other girl new the whole time about Anna yet she did nothing. the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other girl turned out to be her closest and best friend Emma. Anna
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn't know what to do so she ran a hind from them all, but to where

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did she go? and from there she called a friend whom she had just met

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; online ask him for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a favor, to come get her and take her to his house that she would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explain in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the car ride. she didn't know is that he cared about her more then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knew............. He picked her up in a hummer and bought her
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flowers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then......... He picked her up in a hummer and bought her flowers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then......... they went back to his two story house, out in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; middle
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of a forest.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she by now was crying non-stop. he didn't know what all to do so he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; held
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her nice and gentle but close and tight to him. a rush went through
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her like........ a rush went through her like a cold water fall but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this rush of cold water felt like something different. not the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same as if she just got up rush but as if she was very hot and need
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cool of so she relaxed and let her tears flow. he knew this would
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change everything they had. that from here on out their friendship
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important to Anna and he had no clue what he started. nor did she
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that's when that first guy comes back &quot; Cody what are you doing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here!?!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how did you find me?!&quot; Anna yelled at him and she thought of running

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but her favor friend was holding on tight to her so she wouldn't she

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn't know what she did so she ran away again when she got back to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school she waited a few hours and called him again. and called him
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back just to hear the person she has been trying to get
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from-Cody. she tells him.......... she tells him &quot;is this all
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life's about? I run away?&quot; then went to the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; top roof of the school. &quot;if I jump, it would all end Cody&quot; Cody was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still in the other line&quot; don't jump! please stay on the line!&quot; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was too late, she jumped and..... there was her friend [by the way
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name is matt.] who was at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spot just getting out of his car and he caught her telling her that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cared about her not to do that again. He said 2 her: I love you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; honey!
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you want to marry me? Then she said to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him. no I hate you look like a monkey funny to her but it crashed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when she realized he was being serous,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she turned to him to kiss him but he said I thought u said no! she
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't know u where for ever. I am sorry but I will need some time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think and he kisses her and brings her back to his house where Cody
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; waiting for them. matt tells him to get off his yard before I call
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cops. Cody leaves just after saying &quot; if u don't care then why were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; u
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so hurt? we u playing me? or did I do all that myself.&quot; and left to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never be heard/seen again and to leave her alone and get out of her
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life ,now matt holds her in his strong but gentle arms and tells her
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he will
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always be here for her no matter what. she says yes! I will. I love
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you. he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't understand at first, making a face and then he realizes she
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agreed to marry him. he kisses her on the forehead- he is taller
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; her by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a few inches- and hugs her again and says thank you I love you too.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and then they announce that they will  marry on September the 6 !
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wedding day came. All the guests arrived, including a rather strange
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking man, who
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sat right at the back.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Page 2
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This man was Anna's father who ran and left her when she was young
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; once he heard about her to see how she was and what she was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing....
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was nervous. . . but he wish to his daughter the best for her. .
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; .
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A man in a white suit entered, he was tall, and handsome, and had a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weird smile on his lips. No one recognized him. He sat down next to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anna's father, who was to deep in his own thoughts to notice this.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; man was here for a reason but what no one new. The wedding started
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with all due pomp and circumstance... later on when they were
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; settled
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a house and Anna found out she was pregnant with a  girl who was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going to be different as the doctors told her. she and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matt wouldn't listen to them for they new that the child was perfect

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matter what anyone else said about her.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the day of birth Anne's parents called her &quot;where the hell have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been for da
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; past four years? Your only 16 an you have a child?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Mom, I'm old enough to make my own choices!&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;When where u planning to tell me you had intercourse?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;what is that?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sex!&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The baby was born, it was ... different ... but Anna still loved it,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and she was very upset when the doctors told her that it had to be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; put
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an incubator. She was still nervous for most of that night. In the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; morning she demanded to see the baby. They took her to her child,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it had
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gone. Naturally she was distraught, her husband angry and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hospital
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; security feeling really stupid. They had a look at the CCTV, which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went blank at the time of the kidnapping, but before then it showed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; man in a white suit entering the hospital, but not leaving this is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very same man who was at the wedding sitting by anna'a father.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Matt demanded that everyone goes to lock down mode and that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; police
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; help
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to find his child that was just stolen. anna agrees but at the same
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thinks he might be over reacting a little bit. alll in all the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; police
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the hosptial goes into lock down mode, and they begin the search.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; matt
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walks into  a secret room and desides to follow it Matt walks down
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this secret passageway for what fells like forever.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For some reason though, the thought of turning back never crosses
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind. he reaches the end of the passageway, it is a very dimly lit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; room with a big statue of a cloaked men. he cant see the mans face
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because the cloack is shading it. but matt just
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ignores the staue and goes on through a hallway when he hears a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; babies
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cry. He can hear crying but can not tell where it is coming from; he
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; searches around franticly, and eventually arrives in an underground
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tunnel, where he sees a white car driving away. A shadow dislodges
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; itself from the wall and. this thing jumps at him with both a gun

You would publish this? That would indeed be cool. So long, of course,
