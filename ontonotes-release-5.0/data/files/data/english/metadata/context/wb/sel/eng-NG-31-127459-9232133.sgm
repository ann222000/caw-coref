The page appears to have been hacked.  I got a feed into
something called &quot;gubbishremover&quot; which my antivirus software blocks.

However, Susan has a point about Ha'aretz.  Its editor in chief
has said that he deliberately slants news coverage against Likud
and Kadima as well as the O and ultr-O communities.

Joel, would you please post a &quot;fair use&quot; excerpt of the article

Isi Liebler in an opinion piece in a recent Jerusalem Post reported
that Landau told a meeting of Jews in Russia that he would  not report
on controversies (i.e. corruption scandals) regarding government
leaders such as Olmert as long as he carries out the policies that
Landau approves of.  So much for &quot;journalistic ethics&quot; at Ha'aretz.

Jay, are you saying that some settlers are not goaded?

I am not saying some settlers are idiots, and certainly the IDF have
been at minimal lazy in preventing clashes, (which is why I proposed
increasing police forces, instead of using the IDF to do a cops job.)

But certainly, and this applies mostly to when British and French
camera crews are around, that those people encourage this type of
stuff.  Or do you have info on this that I am not aware of?

I have no secret info. What I am saying is that every time an
anti-Palestinian incident occurs, there are people who blame either the
shabak or unnamed culprits, always accusing someone other than the settlers.
They always somehow try to exonerate the settlers, which, as is quite well
known, do provoke the Palis sometimes. Some settlers are goaded -- but
then., some Palestinians are, too.

AFAIK it's not a put-up job. I correspond with a couple of Hevron
residents. It takes guts to live in that place, surrounded by a
hostile (and often armed) population. Most adult male Jews there
maintain an aggressive posture - they do not let the slightest
provocation go unanswered - because they believe (based on experience)
that anything less will embolden the Arabs. Teenagers then do
likewise. Unlike the adults, they are usually not armed, and throw
their stones under IDF protection. Last year several Jewish girls
threw stones at Arab schoolgirls on their way from school.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have no secret info. What I am saying is that every time an
&gt; &gt; &gt; anti-Palestinian incident occurs, there are people who blame either the
&gt; &gt; &gt; shabak or unnamed culprits, always accusing someone other than the
&gt; &gt; &gt; settlers. They always somehow try to exonerate the settlers, which, as is
&gt; &gt; &gt; quite well known, do provoke the Palis sometimes. Some settlers are
&gt; &gt; &gt; goaded -- but then., some Palestinians are, too.

&gt; &gt; I know this, and that is always why I wonder why the IDF troops allow the
&gt; &gt; goading to  happen.  If I were in the IDF and I saw a French or British
&gt; &gt; camera crew trying to pick fights between the JudArabs and the settlers,
&gt; &gt; that camera lens would be shattered in a manner of seconds.

&gt; Ah, it's the French and the British film crews that are responsible.

Well, in the case of that kid who ended up NOT being killed by Israeli
bullets, it *was* a French film crew.  And if I recall correctly there
were a couple of British film crews in Gaza who were more involved in
their films than perhaps they should have been.  So, YES, in some cases
it IS the British and French film crews.  Doesn't mean they're responsible
for all of it.

Meanwhile, clearly we can blame the poor behaviour of Hebron's Jewish
youth on the fact that they're persecuted minority.  If only the world
would let them have their homeland...

I note that it is very difficult to make out what is actually
occurring in the brief video clips. Also, they show no context of what
went before or what happened after. We have only the commentator's
voice over explaining what is likely her own version of what is
happening.

In another newspiece clip in the same video, I note with satisfaction
that the thieves who run the Habad Youth in Israel may finally be
brought to justice. Yes, Mr Markov, you read correctly. I note this
with satisfaction. A few of the Habad political leadership in Israel
are no better than the rest of the corrupt Israeli political leaders.
It is all right, Mr Aronov, you will be able to continue run your
corrupt thievery from a prison cell, much as Mafia leaders do in the
United States. Or else, you will have to forgo some of your ill-gotten
millions paying bribes to stay out of prison.

I did see the video.  At least some of those incidents realistically
couldn't have been staged, at least not without the complicity of
the Jews involved.  They claim to be subject to these incidents often,

paleostiniens are Hebron residents. Jews are not. &quot;Harazachta v'gam
yarashta&quot; you ask? To the Fairbanks way of thinking, paleostinians
killing Jews in not retzicha. Evicting Jews is not yerusha, it is
merely recovering what rightfully belongs to the paleostinians. What
is the difference between a mugger and an islamofaschist? A mugger
says &quot;stick-em-up, give me your wallet, give me your watch&quot;. An
islamofaschist says &quot;stick-em-up, give me *my* wallet, give me *my*
watch&quot;.

&gt; Isi Liebler in an opinion piece in a recent Jerusalem Post reported
&gt; that Landau told a meeting of Jews in Russia that he would  not report
&gt; on controversies (i.e. corruption scandals) regarding government
&gt; leaders such as Olmert as long as he carries out the policies that
&gt; Landau approves of.  So much for &quot;journalistic ethics&quot; at Ha'aretz.
">

Nothing new. Remember the journalist who said Sharon must be
protected &quot;like an esrog&quot; so that he could clean out the Jews from
Gaza? They also refused to investigate the many allegations against
Sharon and his family of all kinds of corruption. That &quot;protection&quot;
didn't prevent him from having a stroke and becoming a vegetable,
but it did enable the &quot;disengagement&quot; from Gaza to go through without
any kind of meaningful public debate.

&gt;&gt;Another thing I thought of after the fact was how they could know what to
&gt;&gt;film?
&gt;&gt;The whole thing smells of a put-up job.
&gt;&gt;Either it's a fake, OR the kids were goaded into it, &amp; Ha'Aretz only filmed
&gt;&gt;the *reaction*.

&gt; AFAIK it's not a put-up job. I correspond with a couple of Hevron
&gt; residents. It takes guts to live in that place, surrounded by a
&gt; hostile (and often armed) population. Most adult male Jews there
&gt; maintain an aggressive posture - they do not let the slightest
&gt; provocation go unanswered - because they believe (based on experience)
&gt; that anything less will embolden the Arabs. Teenagers then do
&gt; likewise. Unlike the adults, they are usually not armed, and throw
&gt; their stones under IDF protection. Last year several Jewish girls
&gt; threw stones at Arab schoolgirls on their way from school.
">

So, in order to get the film they want, all the Arabs have to do is
goad some teenager and then film his reaction. And Ha'aretz is happy
to use their film for their &quot;documentary&quot;. &lt;sigh&gt;

I, too, have a very tough time getting out the crying towel for the &quot;poor
Palestinians.&quot; I haven't figured out what is the equivalence exactly, but
some posters have now moved from obsessing over the &quot;horrible&quot; chareidim to
obsessing over the &quot;horrible settlers.&quot; Maybe it's to make the point that
all Orthodox Jews are &quot;thugs&quot; and prone to violence. At any rate, the MO
(modus operandus) is the same. Post a headline, any headline, that portrays
Orthodox Jews in some sort of negative light along with a comment like &quot;and
let the excuses begin&quot; so that anyone who has the audacity to disagree with
the assessment appears predictable, foolish or pathetic from the outset. You
gotta wonder about someone who has been given an opportunity of a lifetime
to be on assignment in Alaska, yet is still spending his time finding new
ways to slam Jews in Israel.

If we're to have real credibility when it comes to criticizing human
rights violations, attacks, misconduct, or just plain offensive
behavior directed at Jews, we need to be equally vocal when it is our
own people engaging in the same acts that we despise in others.  To do
otherwise is a virtual invitation for a &quot;PKB&quot; response from outsiders
and our enemies.  The fact that others are doing even worse to us
isn't much of an excuse.  It doesn't matter who learned it from whom;
rather, we need to &quot;police&quot; our own people if we want others to do the
same with theirs. At a minimum, we should feel embarrassed and a bit
ashamed when our people engage in such misconduct, and trying to
explain it away doesn't resolve the issue.

Jews in general are critical of their fellow Jews' failings.  How
often do you read about Catholics, Muslims, Hindus or others
criticizing their co-religionists?  Not as often as you read
about us criticizing ours.  Perhaps we should let our hooligans
out and about for a little while in the West Bank, Gaza and a few
other places in the world.  Perhaps people will say &quot;Don't mess
with the Jews.  They might come after you.&quot;

Except we don't know that there was any misconduct, as there is no way for
us to know what the Palestinians may have done to provoke them. It was
exceedingly convenient that the Palestinian family had a camera ready to
film the incident. And wouldn't it be interesting to see some videotapes of
the Palestinian thugs intimidating the Jews, but those tapes are
conveniently absent. It's sort of like the videotapes of the IDF shooting at
the Palestinian children who are tossing pebbles at them, but what you don't
see are the adult Palestinians standing behind the children with their guns.
If I could know that this tape were an accurate depiction of the real-life
situation, I might respond differently, but based on past performance (of
the Palestinians), I have just a little trouble taking this film at face
value and condemning the Jews.

If it was, as claimed, an ongoing problem, it would be reasonable for
the family to have a camera at the ready.  I've advised clients of
ours to to the same when faced with neighborhood problems that never
seem to end, especially since cameras are cheap and plentiful these
days.  And while provocation might explain why people do things, it
doesn't necessarily excuse them.  Perhaps the answer is to install
regularly-monitored video cameras in locations with problems, ala Las
Vegas casinos or British cities, providing ongoing records of who does
what and to whom?

As soon as I am given actual proof that they did it, I'll condemn it.
But I have to say that I am sick &amp; tired of speaking up, only to end
up being wrong because it was a false report.
Did you catch my post about the bombs sen to NASRALLAH that
were plastered all over the media as &quot;to the children of Lebanon&quot;?
It's like that *all the time*, and I'm sick of it.
This sounded a lot more suspicious to me, given the circumstances.

How did Eliyahu go overboard? Isn't it about time you Jews start acting like
the rest of us? When are you gonna start exercising some self control?

Actually, my *real* question is when are you all gonna start defending
yourselves?

I would like to ask that of America as well.

Sorry, Moshe. Eliyahu's posts are usually not only sober, but very civil. We
should do our utmost to maintain our civility even if the other side is not
always civil. That, I believe, was Eliyahu's message. Right on point!

Derech eretz kadma le'torah.  (Civility preceded the Torah).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Fairbanks, Alaska

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Must be real boring in Fairbanks to be regurgitating this nonsense.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; There
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was no new footage. This was all old stuff. Haaretz refers to the Jews
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; SETTLERS, and to the Arabs as RESIDENTS. Harazachta v'gam yarashta?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; thugs at Am-Haaretz are at it again.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It just seems odd to the point of insanity to only be posting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; about stone throwing by Jews &amp; not rocket shooting by terrorists.
&gt; &gt;&gt; -----
&gt; &gt;&gt; And now we will get a follow-up that reads something like &quot;And let the
&gt; &gt;&gt; excuses begin&quot; or &quot;Your knee-jerk response is so predictable&quot; or &quot;Get the
&gt; &gt;&gt; chip off your shoulder.&quot; Yawn.

&gt; &gt; Oh, that's already come &amp; gone.
&gt; &gt; My answer to that is that he truth should always be predictable.

&gt; &gt; Now, I have never said that all Jews are always perfect.
&gt; &gt; But I do say that these kids in Hebron would never have
&gt; &gt; dreamed of picking up a rock if PLO kids didn't show them
&gt; &gt; how, &amp; PLO parents weren't busy trying to kill every Jew
&gt; &gt; they could find. This reality is why I'm disgusted when
&gt; &gt; anyone harps on it as nastily as this post did - especially
&gt; &gt; in the header.

&gt; -------
&gt; I, too, have a very tough time getting out the crying towel for the &quot;poor
&gt; Palestinians.&quot; I haven't figured out what is the equivalence exactly, but
&gt; some posters have now moved from obsessing over the &quot;horrible&quot; chareidim to
&gt; obsessing over the &quot;horrible settlers.&quot; Maybe it's to make the point that
&gt; all Orthodox Jews are &quot;thugs&quot; and prone to violence. At any rate, the MO
&gt; (modus operandus) is the same. Post a headline, any headline, that portrays
&gt; Orthodox Jews in some sort of negative light along with a comment like &quot;and
&gt; let the excuses begin&quot; so that anyone who has the audacity to disagree with
&gt; the assessment appears predictable, foolish or pathetic from the outset. You
&gt; gotta wonder about someone who has been given an opportunity of a lifetime
&gt; to be on assignment in Alaska, yet is still spending his time finding new
&gt; ways to slam Jews in Israel.
&gt; Best regards,

My antipathy isn't toward Orthodox Jews or the Jews of Israel, the
vast majority of whom wouldn't dream of acting the way the hooligans
in Hevron act. Their bad behavior has been documented for years. They
have been filmed; they have been taped, they have been reported about
by neutral sources. The Israeli government has done reports on them
and sent in the police. They are thugs. But because they profess to be
Orthodox, we can say nothing bad about them? It actually might be more
admirable if they behaved like Orthodox Jews instead of gangsters.

I promise you: the minute a group of Conservative Jews start throwing
stones at Palestinians or a band of Reform invade a house to take it
over, Hevron or any place else, I will be the first to report it here.

If you jerk your knees too hard you are going to hurt yourself one
day.
