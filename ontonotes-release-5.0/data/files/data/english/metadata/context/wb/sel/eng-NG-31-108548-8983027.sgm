15 minutes, the pain
had disap-peared and the swelling had lessened considerably. I kept
the pack on overnight, and when I removed it in the morning, the

Growths And Tumors

Armstrong reported in great length on the remarkable effects of urine
compresses in reducing and eradicating a wide variety of internal and
external tumors, cysts and abnormal growths.

1. Compresses should be used in combination with internal urine

cotton material (such as an old T-shirt).

3. Soak the pad in a container of fresh or old urine. Warm the urine
by pouring it into a glass container, then place the jar in a
