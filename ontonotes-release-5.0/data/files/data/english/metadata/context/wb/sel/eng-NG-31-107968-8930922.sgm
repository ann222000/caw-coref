Which secondhand bookshop is housed in the most unusual/interesting
building?

I will start the ball rolling with Over-Sands Books, in Grange-Over-
Sands, North-West England. This is located in a former waiting-room on
one of the platforms of the (still in use) railway station there.

Any others?

Old Grindle's Bookshop in Edinburgh (now relocated to King's Bookshop
in Callander) used to do street stalls a few blocks away in the summer.
They stored the books for this in a booth in the side of a road - there
were two roads side by side, one going up and one going down, so the
booth was in a chunk of wall with no building behind it.  It was only
three feet deep, but it had solid looking double wooden doors; I would
guess that it might have originally been a tool store for the adjacent
graveyard.  The story the owner told about it was that during WW2 the
military had posted a full-time guard in front of the doors.  The idea
was to misdirect the Germans into thinking there was something important
behind it.

The doors have since rotted away, the niche is still there.

I know of at least one in a former church (Troubadour in North Hatfield
MA), one in a converted supermarket (Half Price in Austin TX), one in a
former movie theater (Bookstop Alabama Theatre in Houston TX), one in a
converted bowling alley (Barnes &amp; Noble in Bellevue WA!), and several in
barns.

Until a few months ago, there was a combination used bookstore
and barber shop, in Price, Utah.    It seems to have disappeared
from the phone listings for some strange reason.

Toronto had (at least a couple of years ago) a combination florist and
used book shop, though the number used books was probably only a couple
of hundred.

I'd think it was the leftover from the &quot;looks old, let's stack 'em up,
put a ribbon and flower on them....oh for cute&quot;!   ;)

The one in Price was in a separate room, and had books in the low thousands.
Unfortunately, half were paperbacks, but we did pick up a few things.   It's
coal mining country (in the news right now), and I don't think there's a
&quot;real&quot; bookstore in the town.   A library, yes.
