Here is an article I wrote regarding Ronald Numbers' conclusions about the
rise of Creationism.  Do the militant atheists of the middle of the 20th
century have a share in the blame for the rise of modern creationism?

http://submerging.reclaimingthemind.org/blogs/2007/09/17/do-militant-...

That is a Christian site, where I am hoping to educate my fellow Christians
regarding the history of anti-evolutionism, which I think can only everyone
involved.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.  You  can respond here if you
like.

BTW, I am a theistic evolutionist.

To the extent that evolution is/was used as evidence against a god or
gods, and to the extent that creationists reject science in order to
preserve their belief system, then yes.

However, evolution does not argue against creationism per se, as much
as it argues against creationism combined with biblical literalism.
Evolution directly contradicts the account of Genesis.  So it is up to
the pious to harmonize these two accounts.  Some find that they
cannot, because they are wedded to a literal biblical interpretation,
and therefore reject evolution, as well as any other science that they
perceive as encroaching on their beliefs.

This is sort of like blaming the brick wall for being in your way.

No.

At first, all the wing nuts had to do is label evolution
&quot;atheistic,&quot; and most people would react to it negatively.
Most people -- even those belonging to non fundamentalist
churches -- have been raised to respect religious and
religious figures. It would never occur to them that religous
figures could be malicious, butt ignorant twits.

Anyhow, creationism's real growth doesn't begin in the
1960s, it begins in the 1980s when the Republicans
harvested the fundies for political use.

It's pretty simple. The strength of the religious Reich
is not so much votes as money. Going back in my lifetime,
for example, the religious Reich has only ever delivered
a single Presidential election, and that was in 1988.

Oh, don't get me wrong. They may have been part of a GOP
victory in 1980, 1984 &amp; 2004, but they weren't the
deciding factor. After all, they were part of the GOP
voting block in 1992, 1996 &amp; 2000, and even Al Gore got
half a million more votes than Bush.

Reich wing groups invent issues -- like Terry Schiavo
and children being taught science in science
classrooms -- and they use the issues (and the groups)
to build lists. They compile huge lists of like-minded
whack jobs -- people who donate money, mostly -- and
then they sell these to the Republicans. They better
you are at doing this, the more influencial you become
in Washington.

&quot;That man is responsible for $10 million in donations&quot;
is a ver, *Very* impressive thing to say.

The biggest of the big get direct access to the
Whitehouse, and the President himself. And when that
happens... well... we're talking an all new ballgame.

Billy Graham, the man who perfected the Religious Scam
under Nixon, openly talked about all the people who
approached looking for access to the President. See,
when you have access to the President, you no longer
have to solicite the big bucks, the big bucks come to
you, offering you piles of cash to get you inside the
Whitehouse.

Okay, yeah, I'm babbling. Anyhow, the present
creationist movement is a political movement. You
can't separate it from politics with a crowbar.

Bald-faced lie. The Republicans have held the presidency since Nixon
(1968) with two exceptions. The anti-evolutionies have been
traditionally Democratic strongholds, such as Kansas, Tennessee, etc.,

The Republicans lost in 1976, 1992, 1996 and 2000.

The religion-turned-politics hit full steam under
Jimmy Carter, when the GOP was preparing to run a
divorved Hollywood movie star against a born-again
lay preacher (Jimmy Carter).

Don't play the innocent. It's a form of words they use to describe the
way atheists have weekly, even daily, meetings in specially
constructed tax-free buildings to reinforce their unfaith, special
public holidays devoted to their heroes, send their youth round in
pairs to knock on people's doors to sell their unbelief, run big TV
campaigns urging each other to shell out millions of dollars for the
cause, fill conference centres with huge rallies, and send death
threats to those who publicly espouse religion. They get kids and fill
them with lifelong guilt and fear. They get their message printed on
the currency, too. You must have seen that Dawkins whipping up his
followers to weep, scream, roll on the floor babbling in many tongues;
maybe even read his strident writings urging death to all believers. I
tell you, those militant atheists are scary.

What has happened in the last fifty years, is that Creationism has
transformed from being a single hollow claim: &quot;goddiddit&quot;, to being a
fully fleshed-out mishmash of bullshit.

Who are these people? I am an atheist but you would never know it. I
don't hang around religious people or people who promote their views
one way or another. Most mature adults don't feel the need to
prosyltize their point of view. Are you talking about O'Hair? She's
dead, murdered, I believe, by one of her staff, about 12 years ago.

I have read Numbers, but I have not read your article yet.

The last sentence is a continuation of thought from the preceding
paragraph, and was not addressing the issue of the actions of so
called 'militant atheists', but rather the issue of the reaction by
religious groups to the theory of evolution.

I have run into some 'militant atheists' and I can certainly believe
that a counter-reaction to them could, in part, be to blame for the
resurgence of creationism in the 2nd half of the 20th century.
However, and if I recall correctly, Numbers documents *various* causes
and potential causes of the resurgence of creationism.  So 'militant
atheists' are possibly a part of the problem, but I don't think that
they were a major factor.   Religious leaders who used 'militant
atheism' as a whipping boy to increase their flocks through FUD (Fear,
Uncertainty and Doubt) are more to blame.

&gt; &gt; Christians
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding the history of anti-evolutionism, which I think can only
&gt; &gt; everyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; involved.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.  You  can respond here
if
&gt; &gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I am a theistic evolutionist.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To the extent that evolution is/was used as evidence against a god or
&gt; &gt; &gt; gods, and to the extent that creationists reject science in order to
&gt; &gt; &gt; preserve their belief system, then yes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; However, evolution does not argue against creationism per se, as much
&gt; &gt; &gt; as it argues against creationism combined with biblical literalism.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Evolution directly contradicts the account of Genesis.  So it is up to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the pious to harmonize these two accounts.  Some find that they
&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot, because they are wedded to a literal biblical interpretation,
&gt; &gt; &gt; and therefore reject evolution, as well as any other science that they
&gt; &gt; &gt; perceive as encroaching on their beliefs.

&gt; &gt; I agree with this entirely.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is sort of like blaming the brick wall for being in your way.

&gt; &gt; Did you read the article?  It explains why Numbers, a leading expert on
this
&gt; &gt; issue, thinks that certain actions by the militant atheists in the late
50's
&gt; &gt; and early 60's contributed to making Creationism an issue again when it
had
&gt; &gt; all but died out.

&gt; I have read Numbers, but I have not read your article yet.

&gt; The last sentence is a continuation of thought from the preceding
&gt; paragraph, and was not addressing the issue of the actions of so
&gt; called 'militant atheists', but rather the issue of the reaction by
&gt; religious groups to the theory of evolution.

&gt; I have run into some 'militant atheists' and I can certainly believe
&gt; that a counter-reaction to them could, in part, be to blame for the
&gt; resurgence of creationism in the 2nd half of the 20th century.
&gt; However, and if I recall correctly, Numbers documents *various* causes
&gt; and potential causes of the resurgence of creationism.  So 'militant
&gt; atheists' are possibly a part of the problem, but I don't think that
&gt; they were a major factor.   Religious leaders who used 'militant
&gt; atheism' as a whipping boy to increase their flocks through FUD (Fear,
&gt; Uncertainty and Doubt) are more to blame.
">

Oh, you are right, there were other factors and I describe them as well in
the article, but that one aspect (the actions of certain &quot;evangelistic&quot;
atheists themselves) seems always to be left out of the discussion and I
think it is useful to remember the full history.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What do you mean by 'militant'?

&gt; &gt; Basically, &quot;evangelical&quot; atheists, those who do not just hold to
atheistic
&gt; &gt; views, but actively seek to promote them and gain converts to that
&gt; &gt; worldview.   I describe what Numbers is talking about in the article.

&gt; Who are these people? I am an atheist but you would never know it. I
&gt; don't hang around religious people or people who promote their views
&gt; one way or another. Most mature adults don't feel the need to
&gt; prosyltize their point of view. Are you talking about O'Hair? She's
&gt; dead, murdered, I believe, by one of her staff, about 12 years ago.

&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madalyn_Murray_O'Hair

&gt; &gt; The wing nuts have been proclaiming that atheism=evolution

&gt; It goes back to the 1860s, right after OoS appeared.

Ronald Numbers, who is probably the leading expert on this issue, says
otherwise.  He describes the anti-evolution movement as happening in two
waves, one starting in the 20's and the other starting in the 60's.  Before
that, there was some outrage, to be sure, but not a systematic reaction, and
actually a great deal of acceptance even among conservative Christian
groups.

Because the atheists in question were not using heliocentrism as an argument
for atheism.  They were using evolution.  The Christian community had
already accepted heliocentrism and understood that it did not conflict with
their Scripture, so such arguments were of no use as arguments against
religious belief in general and Christianity in particular.  On the other
hand, evolution was still a potent weapon for atheism (due to ongoing
literalness in Biblical interpretation), so they used evolution for their
own agendas.

this doesnt make any sense. you argue that &quot;militant atheists&quot; were

I think Numbers was wrong, and you are equally wrong. First, creationism
in America had its first wave long before the '50s, which is why there
was a Scopes trial. None of this had to do with any &quot;militant atheists&quot;,
whatever that means. Second, you mention Haldane, Simpson, and Mayr.
Haldane was an outspoken atheist, but he wasn't even American. I have no
idea about Simpson's or Mayr's religious views, which seems significant
to me.

My theory would be that modern creationism began as a reaction to the
move, prompted by sputnik, to improve science teaching in U.S. schools.
Atheists had nothing to do with it.

Nonsense. Most of the creationist arguments were already fully formed in
the 1920s. Look up Harry Rimmer and George MacReady Price.

&gt; I think Numbers was wrong, and you are equally wrong. First, creationism
&gt; in America had its first wave long before the '50s, which is why there
&gt; was a Scopes trial. None of this had to do with any &quot;militant atheists&quot;,
&gt; whatever that means. Second, you mention Haldane, Simpson, and Mayr.
&gt; Haldane was an outspoken atheist, but he wasn't even American. I have no
&gt; idea about Simpson's or Mayr's religious views, which seems significant
&gt; to me.

But John, the article describes the &quot;first wave&quot; exactly as you do, in the
20's, which did result in the Scopes trial.

And, yes, those factors are also mentioned in the article.

Militant atheists are to blame for the outrageous lies of
creationists? No, I'd blame the lying pack of individuals who wrote
the Bible, and got it all wrong. Then I'd blame the creationists
themselves for being so deceitful. Then I'd blame those who support
the creationist liars just to maintain the illusion of an inerrant
Bible.

Protesting against being indoctrinated is not the same as seeking

Pointing out the lies and distortions of religious claims is not
militant.

successful. Especially with all the con-men out there telling people

I would say Numbers is being used out of context.
It was the christian militants who twisted things and used lies to
their benefit.

Pointing out that you don't have the right to force me or my child to

OK, how about &quot;evangelistic&quot;?  The point was not what they believe, but that
they were actively promoting a worldview and attempting to make &quot;converts&quot;
to that worldview.  It was not a desire to avoid indoctrination (defensive
assertion of rights), or even an apologetic (defense of a position), but an
actual promotion.  I think that is fine, and they have every right to do
that, to explain why everyone else should be atheists as well.  But I think
at least &quot;evangelistic&quot; would be a descriptive word.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What do you mean by 'militant'?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Basically, &quot;evangelical&quot; atheists, those who do not just hold to

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;views, but actively seek to promote them and gain converts to that

I would consider &quot;militant&quot; to be a pejorative term. If somebody is just
stating his views with what he considers to be persuasive arguments, and
in a medium you are free to turn off at any time, that's nothing more
than free speech in action. Trying to make that a bad thing is
reprehensible, if that's what you're doing. If that's not what you're
doing, you should reconsider your word choice. (Or perhaps Numbers
should have.)

Yes. But even beyond that, I'm doubting that any such thing happened,
regardless of its effect. I recall some English person or other
(Haldane? J. Huxley?) trying to base morality on evolution, but I don't
remember any actual attempt at a religion of evolution. Some people may
have claimed that certain features of evolution are an argument for
atheism (which indeed they are, if you ask me), but I don't know of
anything prominent in that direction. It's been a while since I read
Numbers, so I don't remember his examples well. But I remember that I
thought his idea poorly supported by his evidence.

&gt;&gt;I think Numbers was wrong, and you are equally wrong. First, creationism
&gt;&gt;in America had its first wave long before the '50s, which is why there
&gt;&gt;was a Scopes trial. None of this had to do with any &quot;militant atheists&quot;,
&gt;&gt;whatever that means. Second, you mention Haldane, Simpson, and Mayr.
&gt;&gt;Haldane was an outspoken atheist, but he wasn't even American. I have no
&gt;&gt;idea about Simpson's or Mayr's religious views, which seems significant
&gt;&gt;to me.

&gt; But John, the article describes the &quot;first wave&quot; exactly as you do, in the
&gt; 20's, which did result in the Scopes trial.
">

This would seem to suggest that creationism is not a reaction to
atheism, but a reaction to teaching of evolution. The success of the
first wave in eliminating evolution from public schools allowed its
activism to subside (no reason for it) until it was needed again, i.e.
when schools began teaching evolution again.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;My theory would be that modern creationism began as a reaction to the
&gt;&gt;move, prompted by sputnik, to improve science teaching in U.S. schools.
&gt;&gt;Atheists had nothing to do with it.

&gt; And, yes, those factors are also mentioned in the article.

As they should be. I'm denying that the &quot;militant atheist&quot; phenomenon,
if there even was any, was a significant factor at all.

I find the argument to be poorly made at best, and more broadly useless
and in fact, wrong-headed.  It is basically claiming that those who are
trying to promote a world view based on science should be blamed for
creating the backlash among religious fundamentalists.   It does nothing
to address the key issue (namely, does the evidence suggest evolution by
natural processes, or the special creation of humans some small number
of thousands of years ago?)

Atheist, and others, want to have their rights under the constitution
protected. So the religious nutbars try to craft their religion into
science, and create a noisy religious/political movement. And thus the
atheists are to blame.
The blame lies entirely on the militant religious, those who seek to
subvert the constitution for their religion.

&gt;&gt; To the extent that evolution is/was used as evidence against a god or
&gt;&gt; gods, and to the extent that creationists reject science in order to
&gt;&gt; preserve their belief system, then yes.

&gt;&gt; However, evolution does not argue against creationism per se, as much
&gt;&gt; as it argues against creationism combined with biblical literalism.
&gt;&gt; Evolution directly contradicts the account of Genesis.  So it is up to
&gt;&gt; the pious to harmonize these two accounts.  Some find that they
&gt;&gt; cannot, because they are wedded to a literal biblical interpretation,
&gt;&gt; and therefore reject evolution, as well as any other science that they
&gt;&gt; perceive as encroaching on their beliefs.

&gt; I agree with this entirely.

&gt;&gt; This is sort of like blaming the brick wall for being in your way.

&gt; Did you read the article?  It explains why Numbers, a leading expert on this
&gt; issue, thinks that certain actions by the militant atheists in the late 50's
&gt; and early 60's contributed to making Creationism an issue again when it had
&gt; all but died out.
">

Certainly the 50s and 60s were a time of substantial change in America.
I think it is a bit of stretch to lay the majority of that change onto
the shoulder of militant atheism.  It would be rather like claiming that
militant atheism caused the Second Vatican Council, or was the basis
of the decision in Brown vs. the Board of Education, or the anti-war
movement, or the rise of counter culture.  I find it equally likely that
militant atheism and militant fundamentalism are basically different
reactions to the same set of social changes that resulted in these other
sweeping changes in American society.

I would say that your point is completely wrong.

Pointing out the lies of creationism is not starting a worldview or
seeking converts. Unless you think that something like promoting good
eating habits constitutes a worldview,
All that was done was to point out that the facts do not support the
claims of the religious.

I think to answer your question would require serious historical
study:  you'd need to study the actual book sales figures, magazine
article circulation, and radio audience size of the specific &quot;militant
atheists&quot; you have in mind, and compare it to the same data for
various fundamentalist publications that used them for whipping-boys.
That way, you would have a better idea of how many of the likely
audience for creationism were even aware of these atheists and their
publications before the fundamentalist religious leaders used them as
bogeymen.  IOW, without the rabble-rousers, would the &quot;rabble&quot; even
have been aware of the atheists?

&gt;&gt; &gt; I know what the point of the article was. I was speaking
&gt;&gt; &gt; of reality.

&gt;&gt; &gt; The wing nuts have been proclaiming that atheism=evolution
&gt;&gt; &gt; from the begining. If you didn't already know, that would
&gt;&gt; &gt; be before the 1950s.

&gt;&gt; It goes back to the 1860s, right after OoS appeared.

&gt;Ronald Numbers, who is probably the leading expert on this issue, says
&gt;otherwise.  He describes the anti-evolution movement as happening in two
&gt;waves, one starting in the 20's and the other starting in the 60's.  Before
&gt;that, there was some outrage, to be sure, but not a systematic reaction, and
&gt;actually a great deal of acceptance even among conservative Christian
&gt;groups.

Things don't happen in a vacuum.  This can also be considered a sort
of chicken and egg argument as even the first paragraph of the article
alludes to.  One can just as easily (and rightfully) point fingers at
the ignorant religious masses for their watering down of the
scientific curriculum for sectarian reasons which led to the need for
real scientists to step in to beef up the curriculum.

It should go without saying that there is and always has been a broad
range of positions concerning the compatibility of evolution and
religion and it is almost exclusively certain radical elements of the
religious crowd who have insisted that it is an either/or situation.

One seemingly glaring omission in the article concerning anti-science
resurgence in the 1960s is the fact that because of the cold war in
general and Sputnik in particular our leaders saw a glaring deficit in
science education in the U.S. for which standards had to be drawn up.

The early 20's movements may very well have been directly related to
our shifting from a mostly agrarian and politically isolated country
to a world player with loftier ambitions.  IOW, a lot of this is just
growing pains that are to a large degree inevitable.

If you push the ignorant masses and try to advance education in this
country, yes there are those who are going to try and push back but
that is no reason to stop trying.

&gt; Here is an article I wrote regarding Ronald Numbers' conclusions about the
&gt; rise of Creationism.  Do the militant atheists of the middle of the 20th
&gt; century have a share in the blame for the rise of modern creationism?

I haven't read Numbers so I'm only going by your summary but it seems a
gross oversimplification.

The reaction of religious conservatives against science is not simply them
being anti-science per se, it's more to do with them perceiving science as
being responsible for a breakdown in social and moral values and TOE, with
its &quot;no need for God&quot; undertones, is a ready made target for them..

As you point out, Darwin's theories didn't cause that much of a stir amongst
religious people when they were first published, opposition only took off in
the early 1920's.  The Scopes trial wasn't a simple case of backwoods hicks
refusing to accept evolution as such - bear in mind that the Butler Act did
not ban evolution in general, it specifically banned teaching &quot;that man has
descended from a lower order of animals&quot;. The main motivation behind the
Butler Act was the growing misuse of TOE as a justification for eugenics,
something that many people including Butler and Bryan believed had been a
major factor leading to World War 1. (See Larkin &quot;Summer of the Gods&quot;)

It is also not generally realised that despite the bad image for Creationism
created by the Scopes trial, the Creationists were largely successful in
their objectives:

&quot;Following up on the Butler Act, antievolutionary laws were passed in
Mississippi in 1926, and then in Arkansas in 1928. However, the 1928
election and the onset of the Depression changed the playing field.
Creationists shifted their attention from state legislatures to local school
boards, having substantial success. They set themselves to the tasks of &quot;the
emasculation of textbooks, the 'purging' of libraries, and above all the,
continued hounding of teachers.&quot; Discussions of evolution vanished from
almost all schoolbooks. By 1941, about one third of American teachers were
afraid of being accused of supporting evolution&quot;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_creationism

The teaching of evolution took off again in the late 50's and early 60's as
a direct result of Russia's launch of Sputnik which caused shock and horror
in the USA; this led to a new focus on science to catch up with the
Russians. The  National Defence Education Act was passed in 1958 and one
result of this was the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study which led to new
biology textbooks including TOE, even though the laws against teaching
evolution were still on the statute book.

The Creationists largely abandoned their attempts to fight TOE on moral
grounds and focused on the development of Creation Science as an alternative
with the 1961 publication of 'The Genesis Flood'  by Henry Morris and John
Whitcomb; this seems to have given them an initial breathing space but
despite the initial publicity, their ideas were quickly demolished by
mainstream science and had no impact on the teaching of science.

The development of the 'permissive society' in the 1960's, however, created
new horrors for religious conservatives and once again, science and
technology became easy targets for them as being responsible for the
increasing materialism in the world which they perceived as being to blame
for the breakdown in traditional values and this in turn led to the
development of the 'Religious Right'.

I don't think that vocal atheists (I wouldn't use the word 'militant')
played any really significant role in this, they did provide specific
targets and readymade soundbites for the leaders of the Religious Right but
no more than that, the Religious Right were on the move anyway.
