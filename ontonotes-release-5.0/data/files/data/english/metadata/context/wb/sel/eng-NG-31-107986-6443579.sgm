Last Sunday (03/11) I brewed an extract/steeping APA that I've probably made
20 times in the past few years. Normally I use Nottingham dry yeast, and
always have great results. I usually brew one weekend, and then rack to
secondary the following weekend to give it a week in primary....well, this
batch I decided to try out US56 dry yeast. I've been hearing a lot about it
and thought since this brew is a "normal" tap head lineup I would be able to
spot any differances coming from the different yeast strain...anyway, I took
the brew into the kitchen a couple of days ago to let it settle before
racking, and was going to rack it, but when I popped up the lid to take a
look, it still had a thick krausen on the top! It was not as high as it had
been during peak fermenting (judging from the grunge ring around the bucket)
but I would guess it was a good 2 inches high! Normally at this amount of
time in the fermenter, Nottingham would have fallen and there would be no
trace left and things would be fine....

The ferment went like normally, 66-68 degrees, it seemed to kick off within
only a few hours (like Nottingham), though judging from the airlock it
wasn't quite as vigourous as Nottingham.

Does this yeast just take longer? Do I need to wait till the krausen falls
before racking into secondary? I'm waiting on brewing an American IPA
because I wanted to use this yeast cake, and this batch is kinda holding
things up, lol....on that note, can I just take some of the krausen (or a
cup or so of beer?) and use THAT to ferment the next batch?

Thanks,

Ricky

See the standard replies to questions like these about visual signs not
having a lot to do with fermentation activity.  It may be that the krausen
is taking longer to fall back into the beer, but that doesn't necessarily
have anything to do with the speed of fermentation.  The fermentation may
or may not be slower this time, but you can't really tell much just by
looking at it.

Have you taken a gravity reading, the fermentation may be just as far
along as with Nottingham, it just may "look" different.  (Note:  You don't
really need to take readings at this point, see below).  Personally, I
wouldn't really worry about it either way.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No, not really.  There is no "right" time to rack to secondary.  It's
entirely up to you.  There are no rules that say activity has to be done, or
the krausen has to fall, etc.  Rack to secondary whenever it is most
convenient.

Generally, I'll rack after the krausen falls, but there are some recipe
combinations that I do which result in fermentation activity being complete
but the krausen never goes away (usually wheat beers).  The krausen falling
isn't a requirement, just a convenient "gauge".

Go ahead and rack to secondary, it won't hurt anything.

I wouldn't.  How will you know how much yeast is in your collected sample?
IMO, it's a much better idea to pitch another packet, especially with how
cheap dry yeast is.  If you really want to reuse yeast from this batch,
I'd use the entire slurry from the bottom.  I wouldn't just grab some
krausen/beer and assume you'll be pitching a healthy/large population.
