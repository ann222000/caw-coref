1-  The NT confirms that only Peter witnessed the crucifixion:

First of all, it is important to know that according to the New
Testament itself, all of Jesus' Disciples fled for their lives on the
night of crucifixion.  None of them witnessed Jesus' crucifixion
except for one, that is Saint Peter!  He was the lone and only witness
of the actual crucifixion event.  Let us look at what the Bible's New
Testament says:

Matthew 26:34-35, 55-57, 69-75
34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not
deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
.......
55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as
against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily
with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be
fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the
high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him,
saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
sayest.
71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and
said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of
Nazareth.
72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth
thee.
74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.
And immediately the cock crew.
75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before
the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept
bitterly.

Now as we clearly see, Peter did witness the so-called crucifixion
event.  He was present there.  The only thing that saved him from
death is his denial that he knew Jesus.  Otherwise, he would've got
crucified that night.

Examples of third-party narrations in the &quot;Gospels&quot; of the NT:

Let us also notice the third-party narration in the &quot;Gospel of
Matthew&quot;, and in the rest of the so-called &quot;Gospels&quot; of the New
Testament.  Here are few examples:

">

&quot;...And as Jesus passed forth thence, HE (Jesus) saw a man, named
Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and HE (Jesus) saith unto
HIM (Matthew), follow ME (Jesus) and HE (Matthew) arose, and followed
HIM (Jesus).  (Matthew 9:9)&quot;

&quot;And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? (From the King James
Version Bible, John 1:19)&quot;

&quot;John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth
one among you, whom ye know not;  (From the King James Version Bible,
John 1:26)&quot;

&quot;For John was not yet cast into prison.  (From the King James Version
Bible, John 3:24)&quot;

etc.....

A lot more examples and proofs are available at:

Just who were the real authors of the Bible? Today's Books and
Gospels' authors of the Bible are UNKNOWN.  See the comments from the
NIV Bible itself!  Also includes detailed refutations and exposing of
Paul's lies.  See Paul's section in the article.  It also includes
proofs about the New Testament was written in the 3rd century by
Constantine and his church by their own words.  It wasn't written by
Jesus and his original Disciples.

Quotes from NIV Bible theologians, and Roman Catholic Encyclopedia
admitting that the Bible had been corrupt and the original manuscripts
had been lost.  Also, proofs that it was Constantine and his church
who wrote the New Testament with their hands around year 300, not
Jesus and his original Disciples.

According to the NIV and KJV Bible's theologians, the gospels were
written by mysterious and unknown people, in unknown places and
unknown dates!

2-   The Apocalypse of Peter was written and spoken by Peter himself!

Unlike the Gospels of the New Testament, the Apocalypse of Peter (the
Revelations sent to Peter) was directly written and spoken by Peter
himself.  This Revelation was widely accepted and believed in by the
early Christians during the 1st, 2nd and 3rd centuries.  Also listen
to this AUDIO file from Christian theologians.   The early Christians
clearly rejected the lies of crucifixion and trinity!

Here are the fragments of his Apocalypse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/apoc/fgapcpt.htm:
">

(emphasis below are mine.  Pay close attention to the red ones.)

As the Savior was sitting in the temple in the three hundredth year of
the covenant and the agreement of the tenth pillar, and being
satisfied with the number of the living, incorruptible Majesty, he
said to me (Peter),

&quot;Peter, blessed are those above belonging to the Father, who revealed
life to those who are from life, through me, since I reminded them,
they who are built on what is strong, that they may hear my word, and
distinguish words of unrighteousness and transgression of the law from
righteousness, as being from the height of every word of this Pleroma
of truth, having been enlightened in good pleasure by him whom the
principalities sought. But they did not find him, nor was he mentioned
among any generation of the prophets. He has now appeared among these,
in him who appeared, who is the Son of Man who is exalted above the
heavens in fear of men of like essence. But you yourself, Peter,
become perfect in accordance with your name with myself, the one who
chose you, because from you I established a base for the remnant whom
I have summoned to knowledge. Therefore be strong until the imitation
of righteousness - of him who had summoned you, having summoned you to
know him in a way which forth doing because of the rejection which
happened to him, and the sinews of his hands and his feet, and the
crowning by those of the middle region, and the body of his radiance
which they bringing hope of service because of a reward of honor - as
he was about to reprove you three times in this night&quot;.

And as he was saying these things I saw the priests and the people
running up to us with stones, as if they would kill us; and I was
afraid that we were going to die. And he said to me: &quot;Peter, I have
told you many times that they are blind ones who have no guide. If you
want to know their blindness, put your hands before your eyes - your
robe - and say what you see.&quot;  But when I had done it, I did not see
anything. I said &quot;No one sees this way&quot; And he said to me, &quot;Do it
again.&quot; And there came in me fear with joy, for I saw a new light
greater than the light of day. Then it came down upon the Savior. And
I told him about those things which I saw. And he said to me again,
&quot;Lift up your hands and listen to what the priests and the people are
saying.&quot; And I listened to the priests as they sat with the scribes.
The multitudes were shouting with their voice. When he heard these
things from me he said to me &quot;prick up your ears and listen to the
things they are saying.&quot; And I listened again, &quot;As you sit, they are
praising you.&quot; And when I said these things , the Savior said &quot;I have
told you that these people are blind and deaf. Now then, listen to the
things which they are telling you in a mystery, and guard them. Do not
tell them to the sons of this age. For they shall blaspheme you in
these ages since they are ignorant of you, but they will praise you in
knowledge - for many will accept our teaching in the beginning, and
they will turn from them again by the will of the Father by their
error, because they have done what he wanted. And he will reveal them
in his judgment, i.e the servants of the Word. But those who became
mingled with these shall become their prisoners, since they are
without perception. And they praise the men of propagation of
falsehood, those who will come after you. And they will cleave to the
name of a dead man, thinking that they will become pure. But they will
become greatly defiled and they will fall into a name of error, and
into the hand of an evil, cunning man and a manifold dogma, and they
will be ruled without law.&quot;

&quot;For some of them will blaspheme the truth and proclaim evil teaching,
and they will say evil things against each other. Some will be named:
those who stand in the strength of the archons, of a man and a naked
woman who is manifold and subject to much suffering. And those who say
these things will ask about dreams. And if they say that a dream came
from a demon worthy of their error, then they shall be given perdition
instead of incorruption - for evil cannot produce good fruit. For the
place from which each of them is produces that which is like itself;
for not every soul is of the truth, nor of immortality. For every soul
of these ages has death assigned to it in our view, and their eternal
destruction, in which they are and from which they are. They love the
creatures of the matter which came forth with them. But the immortal
souls are not like these, O Peter. But indeed, as long as the hour is
not yet come, the immortal soul shall resemble the mortal one. But it
shall not reveal its nature, that it alone is the immortal one, and
thinks about immortality, having faith, and desiring to renounce these
things.&quot;

&quot;For people do not gather figs from thorns or from thorn trees, if
they are wise, nor grapes from thistles. For on the one hand, that
which is always becoming is in that from which it is, being from what
is not good, which becomes destruction for it and death. But that
which comes to be in the Eternal One is in the One of the life and the
immortality of the life which they resemble. Therefore all that which
exists not will dissolve into what exists not. For deaf and blind ones
join only with their own kind. But others shall change from evil words
and misleading mysteries. Some who do not understand mystery speak of
things which they do not understand, but they boast that the mystery
of the truth is theirs alone. And in haughtiness they shall grasp at
the pride to envy the immortal soul which has become a pledge. For
every authority rule, and power of the aeons wishes to be with these
in the creation of the world, in order that those who are not, having
been forgotten by those that are, may praise them, though they have
not been saved, nor have they been brought to the Way by them, always
wishing that they may become imperishable ones. For if the immortal
soul receives power in an intellectual spirit. But immediately they
join with one of those who mislead them.&quot;

&quot;But many others, who oppose the truth and are the messengers of
error, will set up their error and their law against these pure
thoughts of mine, as looking out from one perspective, thinking that
good and evil are from one source. They do business in my word. And
they will propagate harsh fate. The race of immortal souls will go in
it in vain, until my Parousia. For they shall come out of them, and my
forgiveness of their transgressions into which they fell through the
adversaries, whose ransom I got from the slavery in which they were,
to give them freedom that they may create an imitation remnant in the
name of a dead man, who is Hermas, of the first-born of
unrighteousness, in order that the light which exists may not be
believed by the little ones. But those of this sort are the workers
who will be cast into the outer darkness, away from the sons of light.
For neither will they enter, nor do they permit those who are going up
to their approval for their release.&quot;

&quot;And still others of them who suffer think that they will perfect the
wisdom of the brotherhood which really exists, which is the spiritual
fellowship of those united in communion, through which the wedding of
incorruptibility shall be revealed. The kindred race of the sisterhood
will appear as an imitation. These are the ones who oppress their
brothers, saying to them, &quot;Through this our God has pity, since
salvation comes to us through this,&quot; not knowing the punishments of
those who are made glad by those who have done this thing to the
little ones whom they saw, and whom they took prisoner.&quot;

&quot;And there shall be others of those who are outside our number who
name themselves bishop and also deacons, as if they have received
their authority from God. They bend themselves under the judgment of
the leaders. Those people are dry canals.&quot;

But I said &quot; I am afraid because of what you have told me, that indeed
little ones are, in our view, the counterfeit ones, indeed, that there
are multitudes that will mislead other multitudes of living ones, and
destroy them among themselves. And when they speak your name they will
be believed.&quot;  The Savior said , &quot;For a time determined for them in
proportion to their error they will rule over the little ones. And
after the completion of the error, the never-aging one of the immortal
understanding shall become young, and the little ones shall ruler over
those who are their rulers. The root of their error He shall pluck
out, and He shall put it to shame so that it shall be manifest in all
the impudence which it has assumed to itself. And such ones shall
become unchangeable, O Peter.&quot;

&quot;Come therefore, let us go on with the completion of the will of the
incorruptible Father. For behold, those who will bring them judgment
are coming, and they will be put to shame. But me they cannot touch.
And you, O Peter, shall stand in their midst. Do not be afraid because
of your cowardice. Their minds shall be closed, for the invisible one
has opposed them.&quot;

When he said those things, I saw him seemingly being seized by them.
And I said &quot;What do I see, O Lord, that it is you yourself whom they
take, and that you are grasping me? Or who is this one, glad and
laughing on the tree? And is it another one whose feet and hands they
are striking?&quot;

The Savior said to me, &quot;He whom you saw on the tree, glad and
laughing, this is the living Jesus. But this one into whose hands and
feet they drive the nails is his fleshly part, which is the substitute
being put to shame, the one who came into being in his likeness. But
look at him and me.&quot;

But I, when I had looked, said &quot;Lord, no one is looking at you. Let us
flee this place.&quot; But he said to me, &quot;I have told you, &quot;Leave the
blind alone!&quot; And you, see how they do not know what they are saying.
For the son of their glory instead of my servant, they have put to
shame.&quot;

And I saw someone about to approach us resembling him, even him who
was laughing on the tree. And he was filled with a Holy Spirit, and he
is the Savior. And there was a great, ineffable light around them, and
the multitude of ineffable and invisible angels blessing them. And
when I looked at him, the one who gives praise was revealed. And he
said to me, &quot;Be strong, for you are the one to whom these mysteries
have been given, to know them through revelation, that he whom they
crucified is the first-born, and the home of demons, and the stony
vessel, in which they dwell, of Elohim, of the cross, which is under
the Law. But he who stands near him is the living Savior, the first in
him, whom they seized and released, who stands joyfully looking those
who did him violence, while they are divided among themselves.
Therefore he laughs at their lack of perception, knowing that they are
born blind. So then the one susceptible to suffering shall come, since
the body is the substitute. But what they released was my incorporeal
body. But I am the intellectual Spirit filled with radiant light. He
whom you saw coming to me is our intellectual Pleroma , which unites
the perfect light with my Holy Spirit.&quot;

&quot;These things, then, which you saw you shall present to those of
another race who are not of this age (i.e., the Arabs who then became
Muslims). For there will be no honor in any man who is not immortal,
which has shown that it is able to contain him who gives his
abundance. Therefore I said, &quot;Every one who has, it will be given to
him, and he will have plenty.&quot; But he who does not have, that is, the
man of this place, who is completely dead, who is removed from the
planting of the creation of what is begotten, whom, if one of the
immortal essence appears, they think that they possess him - it will
be taken from him and be added to the one who is. You, therefore, be
courageous and do not fear at all. For I shall be with you in order
that none of your enemies may prevail unto you. Peace be to you, Be
strong!&quot;

3-  Some important notes about the &quot;blind&quot; trinitarians from the
Apocalypse:

Like I mentioned above, notice how the Revelation of Peter is
original.  It is not narrated by a third-party person.  It was spoken
and written by Saint Peter himself.   There are few points I'd like to
elaborate on from the Apocalypse:

1-   Jesus, peace be upon him, clearly never got crucified according
to the Revelation.   He spoke about the &quot;substitute&quot; that got
crucified in his place that perfectly matches the Noble Quran's Divine
Claims:

&quot;That they rejected Faith; That they uttered against Mary A grave
false charge;  That they said (in boast):  'We killed Christ Jesus The
son of Mary, The Messenger of Allah.'  But they killed him not, Nor
crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who
differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but
only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not.  Nay,
Allah raised him up Unto Himself; and Allah Is Exalted in Power,
Wise.  And there is none of the people of the book (Jews and
Christians) But must believe in him  (Jesus) Before his death; And on
the Day of Judgment He (Jesus) will be a witness Against them.   (The
Noble Quran, 4:156-159)&quot;

( www.answering-christianity.com/isaiah_53.htm )

2-   Peter according to the NT and to the Apocalypse was the only one
who witnessed the crucifixion.  There is even further evidence in
Hebrews 5:7 of the NT that clearly support Peter's Apocalypse.

3-  Jesus pointed to the Arabs as the future race when he called them
&quot;another race.&quot;   Even the New Testament supports this quote very
well:

&quot;Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you,
and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.  (From the
KJV Bible, Matthew 21:43)&quot;

( www.answering-christianity.com/god_kingdom.htm )

4-   The &quot;blind&quot; from the polytheist trinitarian pagans and the others
who believed and still believe that Jesus got crucified will never
prevail.  They only believe in lies without certain knowledge.   Even
their scriptures are all man-made as we clearly saw above in the third-
party narration proofs.  This goes well, by the way, with the
following Noble Verses:

&quot;Behold! Allah said:  O Jesus!  I will take thee And raise thee to
Myself And clear thee (of the falsehoods) Of those who blaspheme; I
will make those Who follow thee superior To those who reject faith, To
the Day of Resurrection:  Then shall ye all return unto me, And I will
judge Between you of the matters wherein ye dispute.  (The Noble
Quran, 3:55)&quot;

&quot;That they rejected Faith; That they uttered against Mary A grave
false charge;  That they said (in boast):  'We killed Christ Jesus The
son of Mary, The Messenger of Allah.'  But they killed him not, Nor
crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who
differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but
only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not.  Nay,
Allah raised him up Unto Himself; and Allah Is Exalted in Power,
Wise.  And there is none of the people of the book (Jews and
Christians) But must believe in him  (Jesus) Before his death; And on
the Day of Judgment He (Jesus) will be a witness Against them.   (The
Noble Quran, 4:156-159)&quot;

( www.answering-christianity.com/crucified.htm )

5-   The Apocalypse of Peter indeed confirms Peter's disowning of
Jesus three times as mentioned in the NT verses above.  The
Apocalypse's quote: &quot;as he was about to reprove you three times in
this night&quot; clearly refers to when Peter disowned Jesus three times.

6-   Notice the &quot;tree&quot; part where Jesus was sitting on top of.  There
are some mixed signals/evidence in the NT that prove the Truthfulness
of the Apocalypse of Peter.  The NT itself can not make up its mind on
whether the so-called crucifixion took place on a cross or on a tree.
It seems that many of the &quot;blind&quot; ones back then got confused with
whether or not Jesus got crucified on the cross or on the tree.   The
mention of the &quot;tree&quot; was obviously done by Peter and his followers.
But as years and centuries passed by (the NT was written around year
300....300 years after Jesus!), false stories and lies were fabricated
and rumored regarding Jesus, the cross and the tree.   Let us look at
the following verses:

Tree?

Acts 5
29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to
obey God rather than men.
30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on
a tree.
31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.

Acts 10
38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed
of the devil; for God was with him.
39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of
the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:
40 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;

Acts 13
28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they
Pilate that he should be slain.
29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took
him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.
30 But God raised him from the dead:

Cross?

Matthew 27
39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,
40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in
three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from
the cross.
41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and
elders, said,

Matthew 27
41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and
elders, said,
42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of
Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.
43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him:
for he said, I am the Son of God.

Mark 15
29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and
saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three
days,
30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with
the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.

Mark 15
31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with
the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we
may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled
him.
33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole
land until the ninth hour.

Luke 23
25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast
into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their
will.
26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a
Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross,
that he might bear it after Jesus.
27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
which also bewailed and lamented him.

John 19
18 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side
one, and Jesus in the midst.
19 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing
was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
20 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus
was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and
Greek, and Latin.

( www.answering-christianity.com/was_jesus_crucified.htm )

The Apocalypse of Peter answers this confusion!

The real Jesus was sitting on the tree, while the false servant was on
the cross!

4-  The current trinity lie is not different from the far eastern
pagan religions:

Some might say that since most Christians today are &quot;Trinitarians&quot; or
polytheist trinitarian pagans who believe that Jesus died on the cross
for our sins, then this must mean that their religion is Divine and
Truthful.

We have already seen above about what Jesus said regarding the &quot;blind&quot;
ones.  But even according to the New Testament itself, trinitarians
are actually false because they are the majority and they are the
&quot;blind&quot; ones.  Let us look at the following verses:

Matthew 15:9
9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.

Matthew 7:22-23
22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name
done many wonderful works?
23 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from
me, ye that work iniquity.

The far eastern pagan religions!

It is also important to know that the earth's population is around 7.0
billion people, half of which are far-eastern pagans.  Not only that,
but their pagan religions (buddhism, hinduism, shintos, etc...) date
1000s of years back.  This means that many billions of humans have
already been doomed in Hell because of their paganism.  Yet, they are
the majority!

So now are they truthful because they're the overwhelming majority in
numbers?

5-   Did the Disciples of Jesus really die for the trinity and/or
crucifixion lie?

One of the biggest myths and lies Christians ever invented was the lie
of trinity and the lie of Jesus' Disciples, peace be upon them, died
for this man-made belief.

First of all, it is important to know that up until the beginning of
the fourth century (around year 312 or so), the Apocalypse of Peter
was widely accepted among Christians.   In fact, the whole reason why
Constantine (Rome's Emperor at that time) decided to &quot;unify&quot; the
Christians under one &quot;Canon&quot; (modern New Testaments with all of their
current variations and conflicting versions) is because they were so
divided among each others as to who Jesus really was and what really
happened to him!  Take for instance the &quot;Infancy Gospel of Thomas&quot;,
which talks about Jesus' childhood life in good details, and the
mistakes (sins?) that he made as a kid and the lessons that he learned
as he grew up.  Listen to the AUDIO FILE here (93 seconds) from the
documentary film &quot;Banned from the Bible.&quot;

(The &quot;Banned from the Bible&quot; film on Youtube. was sent to me by
brother Sahaba Life, may Allah Almighty always be pleased with him)

Theologians' voices are:

1-  Amir Hussain, Ph.D., California State University, Northridge, CA.

2-  John Dominic Crossan, Author, Excavating Jesus.

Christians fought fiercely (in debates) among each others on who Jesus
was!

To say that Jesus' disciples believed in the trinity lie is an absurd
statement.   Not only trinity is soundly debunked using the modern
Bibles' books themselves, but even the early Christians didn't believe
in the trinity lie.

The wrath of Rome on everybody, including the Christians:

During that time, Rome was collapsing, and it was suffered many
internal corruptions and outside threats.  It even suffered conflicts
from Romans going against each others.  The following sources prove
this beyond doubt:

1-   An AUDIO file of a portion from the &quot;Banned from the Bible&quot;
documentary film.  Historians, theologians and books' authors were the
spokes people in this film.  So it is very reliable and the
information in it is both authentic and objective.

2- http://patriot.net/~carey/afa/latinclub/persecution.htm:

&quot;There were three basic periods of the persecution. The first was from
the death of Christ until right before the Great Fire of 64 A.D.,
which Nero falsely blamed Christians for. However, this first
persecution &quot;was a mere afterthought, and did not result in any
general proscription&quot; (Cary and Scullard, p. 487). The second period
lasted from the end of the first until around 250 A.D., and the final
one spanned the years from 250/251, the persecution under Decius,
until 313. Up until 250, the persecution was sporadic and localized.
However, from 250-251 the Emperor Decius instituted what Michael
Grant, an eminent classical historian, calls a &quot;systematic persecution
of the Christians&quot; (Grant, p. 157). During this persecution, Decius
even executed Pope Fabianus, after which he supposedly remarked: &quot;I
would far rather receive news of a rival to the throne than of another
bishop in Rome.&quot;&quot;

&quot;The Christians were persecuted for a variety of reasons. First, they
denied the basis for the Roman imperium ('command, rule, empire,
supreme power') by advocating that their God was the only real God.
This denied the existence of the pagan Roman gods. These same Roman
gods, in a sense, founded Rome, because according to legend and
popular belief, Romulus, the offspring of the Roman god of war, Mars,
founded the city of Rome in 753 B.C. This gave the Romans a divine
basis for their temporal power. When the Christians denied the
existence of Mars, they attacked the foundation of Roman power. Since
they were attacking Roman authority and power, the Romans came to view
Christians as a threat to the state.....&quot;

The threat of Religion to the pagan Rome was definitely one of the
main reasons why religious people as a whole (Jews and early
Christians) were persecuted and killed.  There is not a single shred
of evidence that proves:

(a)-  The Disciples of Jesus believed in the polytheist trinity
paganism.

(b)-  Died for this false and man-made belief.

(c)-  Died for the belief that Jesus died on the cross.  They were not
even the authors of the &quot;gospels&quot; that were attributed to them.  See
below for more proofs.

As we clearly saw above, the Apocalypse of Peter was widely accepted
all the way even during the days of Emperor Constantine who had his
counsel of Nasea write the &quot;canon&quot; or the New Testament (with all of
its current variations and conflicting versions).

The different &quot;Canons&quot; of the Bible!

Different and conflicting variations of &quot;gospels&quot; and &quot;books&quot; that are
disagreed upon by the Churches today.

Also, as we clearly saw above in the article, the so-called &quot;Gospels&quot;
of Jesus' Disciples were not even written by the Disciples.  They were
written by third-party mysterious and unknown people, in unknown
places and unknown dates!  This is not according to me.  This is
according to the Bible's own theologians and historians' quotes
themselves.

So in other words, we don't really know what Jesus' followers taught!
The only Book that we have that is written directly by one of Jesus'
Disciples is the Apocalypse of Peter.  As you can easily tell from its
text above, it was written directly by Peter himself.

Paul's letters seem also to have been written by him.  But Paul never
even met Jesus in person, nor was he a Disciples of Jesus.  Paul came
into the picture long after Jesus departed.  Not only that, but there
are ample errors and contradictions between Paul and the Old Testament
and Jesus' teachings in the current New Testament in the other
&quot;gospels.  For ample proofs, please visit:  Contradictions and History
of Man's Corruption in the Bible.  Find Paul's sub-section or table of
articles.

6-   So why would people really dare to make up lies about Jesus or
any Truth in general for this matter?

The answer to this question is actually quite simple and logical.  Not
only it was perfectly the case 2000 years or so ago, but it is still
the case even today in our advanced age in education, ethics, morals,
wisdom and experience.

Rural-areas people are notorious, and I mean notorious in the very
literal sense, in gossiping and creating all kinds of lies and false
inventions against other people!  This is true with all nations.
Rumors and lies fly very quickly among these people even today.

During the 3 centuries (300 years which is a very long time) after the
departure of Jesus and before the writing of the first Christian
&quot;canon&quot; (New Testament), they gossiped so much and lied and fabricated
so much that they made an entire bible/religion out of all of it,
which is what most christians have today!  That's very powerful
indeed.  One must never underestimate the power of the liars and
gossips in the rural and country areas.

Not only the Bible suffered such evil human-nature. The Hadiths
(Sayings of Prophet Muhammad) have many gossips and lies in them
inserted on the mouth of the Prophet!   People back there don't care
about ethics and integrity.  They would resort to lying to prove/push
their agenda.  A little twist here and a little twist there and the
next thing you know a whole different story about the event(s) is
fabricated and is now widely accepted.  These lies, by the way, are
not necessarily done with evil intentions.  People, especially in the
rural-areas where they have nothing else better to do than to talk and
gossip about each others stretch their pride, imagination and
interpretations to the farthest extremes for the following reasons:

1-   Showing off and proving to the ones around them that they are
&quot;wise&quot;.

2-   Pushing their personal agenda beyond the local competing ones,
since everyone is a liar and everyone is a gossiper.

3-   They're mentally and socially are not smart enough nor honest
enough to stick to the original Truth as much as possible.  Diverting
and adding extra &quot;colorful facts&quot; is normally part of the culture and
norm of people in these areas.  Remember that it's the way the person
is raised that makes the world's difference in how he/she behaves in
life.  Allah Almighty in the Noble Quran did address those liars and
considered them from the category of the hypocrites and liars who are
doomed to Hell:

&quot;Certain of the desert Arabs round about you are hypocrites, as well
as (desert Arabs) among the Medina folk: they are obstinate in
hypocrisy: thou knowest them not: We know them: twice shall We punish
them: and in addition shall they be sent to a grievous penalty.  (The
Noble Quran, 9:101)&quot;

&quot;O Apostle! let not those grieve thee, who race each other into
unbelief: (whether it be) among those who say &quot;We believe&quot; with their
lips but whose hearts have no faith; or it be among the Jews,- men who
will listen to any lie,- will listen even to others who have never so
much as come to thee. They change the words from their (right) times
and places: they say, 'If ye are given this, take it, but if not,
beware!' If any one's trial is intended by God, thou hast no authority
in the least for him against God. For such - it is not God's will to
purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in
the Hereafter a heavy punishment.  (The Noble Quran, 5:41)&quot;

The Bible too addresses this issue indirectly:

Proverbs 10:31
The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue
shall be cut out.

Proverbs 15:2
The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools
poureth out foolishness.

Proverbs 15:28
The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the
wicked poureth out evil things.

Matthew 15:11
Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which
cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

Matthew 15:18
But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the
heart; and they defile the man.

Indeed Truth is always terribly compromised among those people.  It is
part of human nature to incline toward lying when one lacks a great
deal of education, knowledge and discipline.  In the case of Jesus,
they made the Creator of the Universe out of him, while he was a weak
person and servant of GOD Almighty, and they widely believed in the
crucifixion lie when the original Scriptures refuted it.  The reason
why GOD Almighty let them become &quot;blinds&quot; is because they are blinds
and liars by choice.  Remember the Pharisees that Jesus had to deal
with (those of the Jews who knew the scriptures good enough but were
twisting it to fit their own evil agendas and culture norms) didn't
come out of no where.  They were products of the &quot;rural-areas&quot; gossips
and evil doers.  These &quot;Pharisees&quot; and the likes of them exist in all
nations and all religions in all times and all places, even today.

4-   The dominance of the older ones over the younger ones or the ones
under them makes it virtually impossible for the &quot;lower ones&quot; to make
the Truth be accepted without compromise.  Let me give you an example:

Despite the fact that Islam honors the person based on his/her piety
and their belief in GOD Almighty, but the Arabs (whom Islam came from
and should be the role models of humanity today) still kept many of
the old pagan traditions that really don't go well with real Islam, in
regards to respecting the younger ones in the society.  It is a common
practice that if either the father or the older brother is present in
a meeting with other people, then the younger male is to literally
keep silent and not to say a single word unless he is directly
addressed by someone.  In that culture, the father or the older
brother (after the father passes away) is the boss.  What ever he says
goes.   The part where the oldest brother rules is not supported by
Islam at all!  On the contrary, Allah Almighty Said:

&quot;O mankind! [this includes everybody] We created you from a single
(pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes,
that ye may know each other.  Verily the most honoured of you in the
sight of Allah is the most righteous of you.  And Allah has full
knowledge and is well-acquainted.  (The Noble Quran, 49:13)&quot;

Now I am not saying that this tradition is all 100% bad.  There is a
lot of good in it.  The best thing that it provides to the society is:

(a)-  A great amount of discipline.  This is contrary to the trash-
mouthed Western kids who are mostly Christians with terrible attitude
problems and a great deal of selfishness.

(b)-  Keeps the family ties very well intact.

(c)-  Enforces respect among the family members.  Each member knows
his/her limits and responsibilities.

Islam greatly encourages such layers to exist in the family.  But the
excessiveness of authority and rulership by few individuals,
especially after the father passes away, is not Islamic at all and
does create great deal of conflicts!  In fact, this excessiveness is a
Biblical law:

&quot;If a man dies and leaves no son, turn his inheritance over to his
daughter. (Numbers 27:8)&quot;

As long as there are sons around, the daughters inherit absolutely
nothing!

This excessiveness and corruption only exists in the Bible!

Now imagine, especially during the Biblical days where peoples'
mentality was quite different, if a younger brother or sister believed
in a certain Truth that all of the elderly and older ones in his
circle or group or tribe disagreed with.  Do you think this person
would have the slightest chance to convince anyone, or that his words
would be accepted by anyone who has power or influence?  Absolutely
not. Not a chance.

The point that I am making here is that many influences and reasons
that existed back then and still exist today did cause for major
compromises of the Truth.  If certain people dictate what is true and
what is false, regardless whether they are total ignorants or not,
then rest assure that such &quot;blind&quot; ones would not be loved by GOD
Almighty nor would GOD Almighty really care about keeping an
uncompromised Truth with them.  As He the Almighty Said in the Noble
Quran:

&quot;Because God will never change the grace which He hath bestowed on a
people until they change what is in their (own) souls: and verily God
is He Who heareth and knoweth (all things).  (The Noble Quran, 8:53)&quot;

People are obligated to change the evil situations that they're living
in.  If they don't, then they will cause themselves to be led blind by
others, and GOD Almighty will Gladly allow it.

The &quot;Big Brother&quot; Law:

Here in the US, I am sure you probably heard of the term &quot;big
brother.&quot;  Where do you think this term came from?  What is its root?

This term generally refers to separating or keeping away the state and/
or church from ruling over the people's affairs.  &quot;We don't need big
brother to rule us,&quot; usually means that either we don't want the
government to interfere in our businesses and affairs too much by
enforcing laws that would compromise the publics' liberty, and/or it
would also refer to those who try to force the church and its laws
into the government to turn the government and the country into a
religious state.

This term, &quot;big brother,&quot; came into existence as a result of the
cultures and traditions that existed during the Biblical days that are
similar to the Arabs' ones that I just mentioned above.  The dominance
of the older or bigger ones in the society over the weaker ones causes
for much compromise in everything.  We already saw, for instance, how
the Bible allows the sons to control the daughters by depriving the
daughters from inheritance if the sons (their brothers) do exist.

Can you imagine the type of permanent control the brothers had over
their sisters?

Why do you think the Medieval Christians used to persecute the
minority Christians in Europe?  And why do you think the Protestant
sect of Christianity was born?  It was all due to the oppression and
the forcing of the strong's beliefs, regardless of how false and
ridiculous they are, unto the weaker ones.

&quot;Big brother&quot; did exist during and after the days of Jesus.  &quot;Big
brother&quot; did compromise the Truth of the original Scriptures and what
really happened to Jesus and who he was.  And yes, &quot;big brother&quot; did
cause for much gossips and lies to be spread around, due to human-
nature's arrogance and blindness.

7-   The many different Canons (New Testaments) that Christians
believe in, and the hundreds of manuscripts:

There existed many different Bibles during the time of the Roman
Emperor, Constantine, which were widely believed in by different
Christian sects in the year 312.  In other words, during the first 3
centuries of &quot;Christianity&quot; (300 years), many different canons with
100s of books/gospels combined existed!  That is a lot of canons, a
lot of books/gospels, and a lot of time (300 years) of different
Christian religions existed.   Also, Constantine's own &quot;unified canon
or bible&quot; got lost and only small portions of it were found!  So what
we have today from &quot;Bible(s)&quot; are not even Constantine's books.

The different &quot;Canons&quot; of the Bible!

Different and conflicting variations of &quot;gospels&quot; and &quot;books&quot; that are
disagreed upon by the Churches today.

8-   Conclusion:

The early Christians' doctrines clearly and indisputably confirm that
Jesus, peace be upon him, never got crucified.  The lies that had been
invented after the departure of Jesus about his crucifixion were all
man-made.  This is why you see the &quot;Gospels&quot; of the New Testaments of
today were all written by third-party narrations.  They are not
original, and the theologians and historians of the Bibles of today
claim this as well.   See their quotes for yourself.

Trinity is a lie, and Islam is the Divine Truth of GOD Almighty.
