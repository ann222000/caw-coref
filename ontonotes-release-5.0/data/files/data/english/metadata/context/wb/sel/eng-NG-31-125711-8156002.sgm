This regular FAQ is posted on the 1st. of each month.

--==*-&lt; &gt;-*==--

These posting guidelines are devoted to the memory of Mick Baxter
who lived in Dunblane. Mick was killed June 2001 in a motor bike
accident.
He was 35 years old and a staunch supporter of Edinburgh Airport.
Sadly missed by all who knew him.

WARNING! This newsgroup contains some opinions and comments that you
may not agree with.We encourage discussion and sharing of opinion
and it would appear that some people find this difficult to deal
with. My advice to persons of this persuasion is to view
alt.airports.uk.glasgow

If on the other hand you accept this is a dedicated Edinburgh
airport newsgroup - WELCOME.
--==*-&lt; &gt;-*==--

WELCOME to the unmoderated newsgroup. alt.airports.uk.edinburgh.
This UK family group is intended for discussion of the
airline/air travel industries. Also the discussion of personal
air travel and fares.

It is also intended to be a forum for travel agents, Air Traffic
Control and other World-related air travel subjects. Posts
from European/World Countries pertaining to the guidelines set down
in this FAQ will also be accepted in this newsgroup. The English
language however must be used for all posts.

News items covering 100% aviation subjects are particularly
welcome.

The newsgroups goal is to maintain an active and open discussion
without burdening readers with commercial 'spams' and non
aviation subjects that are not relevant to the newsgroups charter.
Binaries of any nature are forbidden. (Please use the
free.uk.binaries.edinburgh-airport newsgroup - aviation images
ONLY!)

Posts in  MIME/HTML! or other formats designed to be
viewed by Internet browsers is strictly forbidden.
This is necessary in order to make post readable to all members
on the newsgroup, you are therefore requested to post text only
messages. Consult your software on how to post text only
messages. Can you post Binaries? The answer is NO, NO and NO!

The unofficial Edinburgh Airport webpage:
www.edinburghairport.org.uk is currently boasting a
mighty 546,500 HITS!

-------------------------------------------------------------

Subject: What is acceptable?

Any posts that discuss issues regarding Edinburgh Airport and
100% aviation subjects are welcomed here provided they do not
fall into the reject category. (see &quot;What is not acceptable&quot;.)

Appropriate discussions would include, but are not limited to:

* Airlines operating from Edinburgh Airport and
comments/feedback from passengers.

* Edinburgh Airport franchise holders, comments/feedback from
clients etc.

* The present monopoly operators of the airport are BAA and
comments/feedback about lack of airport competition in
Scotland etc.etc.

* Airliner models, resource, allocation, capacity, etc

* Comments about the Airline/Airportindustry from insiders
(most World airlines and Airports serving Edinburgh Airport
have one or more employees who read/post to the net, we hope
to attract serious comments from these posters to this group).

* Discussion of all aspects of European/World airline and airport
management.

* Fare changes and discussion of their effects on European/World
airline passenger/airlines and travel agencies.

* Air Traffic Control personnel on their experiences and advice
or otherwise to both European/World laymen and pilots.

* Scheduled and Charter Airlines and subcontractors to them.

* Aircraft 'spotters' are particularly welcome and it is hoped
that advance news of movements etc will be available in the
newsgroup.

* Taxi services and other transfer services, provided they are
100% Edinburgh Airport related.

* Flying Club posts are particularly welcome. (EDI only)

* Cargo posts related to EDI are also welcome.

* Press releases from airlines and other airline industry-related
corporations (i.e. Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell Douglas, IATA.
ABTA):

* Announcements of fare sales, route changes, aircraft purchases,
leases.

* FAQ's, Provided the content is aviation related.

* 100% aviation webpages.

* Announcements from the UK/European travel trade on fares,
insurance and special offers. But only if they apply to
Edinburgh Airport (Also applies to airports reached via EDI
on direct/connecting flights.)

Topics can range from small charter operations to and from Europe
to major international passenger carriers such as British Airways,
Northwest,American, KLM, Sabena, Air France, or Lufthansa etc.

Aviation Job advertising/seeking orientated is also accepted.

Examples of things that will be acceptable:

(1) major airline seeking Boeing 727 captain with 3000 hours
experience, seeks employment, email: j ... @somewhere.com&quot;

(2) Situations vacant and wanted in any aspects of air travel,
the airport, travel agents, Air Traffic Control etc.

(3) Classifieds will not be acceptable from employment agencies,
this is a mutual interest group which does not stretch to
the exploitation of individuals seeking employment.

(4) Announcements and pointers for 100% aviation webpages.

Here's what  WILL NOT be acceptable in newsgroup postings:

(1) Anything non-air travel relevant (phone cards, etc)
These should be posted to alt.telecom.uk.online.

(2) Webpage announcements for non-100% Edinburgh airport
travel sites.(These should be posted to the
alt.travel.uk.marketplace and free.uk.scotland.webpages
newsgroups.)

(The word 'Edinburgh' in the newsgroup name is not a licence
to post non Edinburgh air-related travel subjects. Posts and
Web Site 'pointers' must be fall into the 'Acceptable Category)

(3) resumes/CVs. job postings are fine but NOT resumes.

(4) Resume posts over about 20 lines (which automatically stops
resumes )

(5) I repeat again, anything from employment agencies.
Sponsorships of any nature are forbidden.

(6) Accommodation to let, rent or buy are OK provided they are
Edinburgh Airport catchment area orientated.

(7) Personal Services such as escorts/room mates are forbidden.

(8) Any posts about online auctions, classified adverts, either
'straight' or web based - just forget it, you are not
welcome! Post these to alt.auctions.uk.online.

(9) Surveys of any nature - except Edinburgh Airport related.

(10) anything inflammatory mentioning RACE; CREED; COLOUR; GENDER;
etc, even if its air-travel related.

(11) Advertising air travel related items such as baggage,
ear-plugs,
anti-motion remedies etc, etc, are also forbidden. Its OK for
non-commercial posters to relate experiences of these. BUT no
webpage references!

We have a near 100% record in tracing abuse and off-topic
postings. Do not even think about it!.... You will be
pursued and you will lose your current ISP account.
If you own your domain................you will lose your
mail and news server!

-------------------------------------------------------------
Subject:  What is not acceptable

A. Posts in a language other than English. This includes
MIME/HTML!

B. Posts quoting a long previous post in its entirety and does
not provide any new content. &quot;I agree&quot; posts fall into this
category. Please edit correctly.

C. Posts quoting text without proper attribution.

D. Posts including an attribution line for a previous post,
without including any of material to be quoted.

E. Posts on any non-aviation subject.

F. Posts about countries/districts that are not aviation
related, even if it requires air travel to get there.
Posts for instance, on Belgium will breach our guidelines,
but posts about Brussels Airport will not. Don't get clever
though and state &quot;Brussels Airport is close to my hotel in
Belgium&quot; - its off-topic!

G. Posts ***promoting*** Glasgow Airport and airport transfers to
and from there.

This rule has drawn criticism in the past. Please remember
our newsgroup's title! Anyone wishing to promote GLA should do
so in the appropriate newsgroups:

free.uk.airports.abbottsinch and alt.airports.uk.glasgow and
uk.local.
glasgow

It should be pointed out that this rule is designed to avoid the
childish
&quot;mine's bigger than yours&quot; conflict that has plagued Scottish
aviation
newsgroups.

East v West Confrontation in mutual interest newsgroups must be
avoided.

Articles from the Evening Times are quite often
Edinburgh-inflammatory,
posting these articles to this newsgroup is inviting the east v
west         confrontation we strive to avoid...

Remember Evening Times articles are written and published in
Glasgow for     a Glasgow readership, reproducing them in
alt.airports.uk.edinburgh is       both malicious mischief and
anti-social.

Cross-posting articles between alt.airports.uk.edinburgh and
alt.airports.uk.glasgow. (Cross-posting to binary newsgroups is
also not acceptable for obvious reasons).
Please consider that a thread in a text group may begin as
appropriate to    two newsgroups, but followups may soon become &quot;off
topic&quot; in one of the      groups.

Newsgroups should be allowed their unique identities without
'stealing' each others.

Pro-GLA Taunts and jibes aimed at individuals or the newsgroup
readership
in general are inflammatory, offenders will be reported to the
service       provider responsible for their internet access.

These comments from Alan Doniger on 7th.February 2004 accurately
describe    the extent of the abuse suffered.

&quot;I used to think this was an interesting enough newsgroup
basically
concerning the growth, development and otherwise interesting
matters
relating to EDI. Seems to me that there is a number of saboteurs
who,in
largely insulting and negative terms of their own are intent on
simply
promoting anti EDI comments. Drivel about boundaries etc and guff
about
shopping in Glasgow. Petty insignificant drivel totally
irrelevant and       more suited to a pro west central Scotland
economic development forum.&quot;

&quot;But please form your own Newsgroup to peddle this propaganda and
leave
others alone. And stop using silly pseudonyms to hide behind. If
you         can't say something under your own name don't.&quot;

H. Alt.airports.uk.edinburgh is related to alt.travel.uk.air
and free.uk.talk.london.heathrow
(free.uk.binaries.edinburgh-airport is
now online) free.uk.airports.abbottsinch and
free.uk.airports.prestwick
plus free.uk.airports-luton have also been added. :-)

I. 'Trolling' is a usenet sin and if any posts in the newsgroup
causes you distress, or arouses your parochialism, you are
in the wrong newsgroup! See rule 'G' above.

J. 'Stalking' is a criminal offence over which administrators
of this newsgroup have no control, the responsibility
for 'Stalkers' is a matter for the concerned ISP who granted
access.

L. Defame, abuse, harass, threaten or otherwise violate or infringe
the    rights of any person or entity (including, but not limited
to, rights       of intellectual property, confidentiality, or
rights of privacy);

COMMERCIAL POSTS AND SIGNATURE FILES.

Any post that involves the intent to sell or buy something
directly - [but see the interim note about the  classifieds
posts above]. or indirectly via online auctions.

Examples:

Become-a-travel-agent-and-get-free-travel-that-really isn't-free,
cheap calling card offers, pyramid schemes, scams. Hyped up press
releases, And postings from Telephone PIN number agents.
(This   includes the selling of National or Premium rate telephone
numbers). In addition, off-topic posts selling things NOT 100%
related to aviation. These include spams and other cross posted
messages (usually on how to make money).

Online auctions or post relating to them. Online classified
advertisements or posts relating to them should be addressed to
alt.auctions.uk.online newsgroup NOT HERE!

Commercial posts on Air Travel holidays and accommodation from the
'High Street' giants. Unless they are Edinburgh Airport related.

Signature files of an unrelated nature. Especially those pointing
to a forbidden newsgroup subject matter or Smear campaigning.
If your signature file contains details of services/subjects not
100% EDINBURGH related, delete it before replying to 'threads'.

Signature files naming individuals are expressly forbidden.

Accommodation to let, rent or buy is OK provided it is within
reasonable travelling distance of Edinburgh Airport.

Announcements on new web sites not 100% aviation related.
Web site announcements which contain 100% aviation subjects are
allowed but Web sites containing other travel information, are not!
Please use the newsgroups alt.travel.uk.marketplace,
rec.travel.europe and rec.travel.marketplace for all travel posts
that would otherwise infringe our posting guidelines. - but please
check that your post does not infringe their particular charters
first!

This is a family newsgroup read by both adults and children.
Action will be taken against posters of adult orientated material
- which should not be posted here anyway.

3. MISCELLANY

alt.airports.uk.edinburgh has a growing readership, which
includes professionals from several World airlines and other UK
air industry related companies.  In an effort to maintain a
professional and interesting level of discussion, the posts
including the following are also unacceptable.

*  Posts that contain profanity, particularly when the article
offers little other redeeming content.

*  Duplicate posts (from the same poster) or identical posts on
the same topic (from the same or different posters).

*  Posts that repeat any off-topic subject or prohibited
signature file.

*  On topic commercial saturation posting - more than once per week.

*  Posts designed to cause confrontation. (justified retaliatory
ridicule will not be considered a breach of our guidelines)

As the newsgroup readership grows, the amount of traffic is
expected to increase. The following suggestions will make the
group easier to  read:

*  Use an appropriate subject line on your posting.  If a thread
moves to a new area, be sure to change the subject line.

*  Be sure to edit down quoted text to the minimum possible.
To keep the level of discussion as professional as possible:

*  If you are quoting text from a printed source, please
explicitly state the title, country of publication, date,
and page number so that others who wish to investigate further
may try to do so. Similar information would be helpful even for
non-printed sources such as television documentaries or news
programs.

*  Be careful to avoid posting proprietary business information -
not in the public domain - or other confidential matter.
Most companies, including airlines, will take severe action
(including termination) if they discover that you did leak
information.

BAA read this newsgroup and they take exception to EDI criticism
from their own and sub-contractor's employees. Use an alias!
