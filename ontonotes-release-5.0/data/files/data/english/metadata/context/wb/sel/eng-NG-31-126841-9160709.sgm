The Myth of the Ticking Time Bomb

The Myth of the Ticking Time Bomb
By Alfred W. McCoy
October 2006
Ask not for whom the bomb ticks, Mr. and Ms. America.  Right now, across Los
Angeles, timers on dozens of toxic nerve-gas canisters are  set to detonate in
just hours and send some two million Americans to their  deaths in writhing
agony.
But take hope. We have one chance, just one, to avert this atrocity and save
the lives of millions. Agent Jack Bauer of the Counter Terrorist Unit has his
hunting knife poised over the eye of a trembling traitor who may know the
identity of those who set these bombs. As a clock ticks menacingly and the
camera focuses on knife point poised to plunge into eyeball, the traitor breaks
and identifies the Muslim terrorists, giving Agent Bauer the lead he needs to
crack this case wide open.
As happens with mind-numbing regularity every week on Fox Television’s hit
show 24, torture has once again worked to save us all from the terror of a
ticking bomb, affirming for millions of loyal viewers that torture is a
necessary weapon in George Bush’s war on terror.
&quot;Major success from limited, surgical torture is a fable, a  fiction. . . .
As we slide down the slippery slope to torture in general, we  should also
realize that there is a chasm at the bottom called extrajudicial  execution.&quot;
Just days before the fifth anniversary of 9/11, President Bush himself
appeared live from the East Room before an audience of handpicked 9/11 families
for a dramatic announcement that mimed, with eerie precision, the ticking-bomb
logic of 24, which is wildly popular among Washington’s neoconservatives. With
clipped, secret-agent diction reminiscent of the show’s Emmy Award-winning
star,  Kiefer Sutherland, Bush said he was transferring fourteen top Al Qaeda
captives,  including the alleged 9/11 mastermind, Khalid Sheik Mohammed, from
long-secret  CIA prisons to Guantánamo Bay. At once both repudiating and
legitimating past  abuses, Bush denied that he had ever authorized “torture.”
Simultaneously, he  defended the CIA’s effort to coerce “vital information” from
these “dangerous”  captives with what the President called an “alternative set
of procedures”—a  euphemism transparent to any viewer of 24.
In defense of the CIA’s past and future use of this “alternative set of
procedures,” Bush told his national television audience a thrilling tale of
covert action derring-do almost plucked from the pages of a script for 24. After  “
they risked their lives to capture some of the most brutal terrorists on
Earth,” courageous American agents “worked day and night” to track down “a
trusted associate of Osama bin Laden” named Abu Zubaydah. But once in custody,
he was “defiant and evasive.” Knowing that “captured terrorists have . . .
intelligence that cannot be found any other place,” the CIA, with White House
approval, applied that “alternative set of procedures” and thereby extracted
timely information that “helped in the planning . . . of the operation that
captured Khalid Sheik Mohammed.” Then, “KSM was questioned by the CIA using
these procedures,” producing intelligence that stopped a succession of lethal
ticking bombs.
The mind-boggling catalogue of these plots, the President told us, included  “
Al Qaeda’s efforts to produce anthrax,” a terror assault on U.S. Marines in
Djibouti with “an explosive-laden water tanker,” “a planned attack on the
U.S.  consulate in Karachi using car bombs,” “a plot to hijack passenger planes
and  fly them into Heathrow,” and “planned attacks on buildings in the
United States”  with bombs planted “to prevent the people trapped above from
escaping out the  windows.”
Of course, the President could not, he said with a knowing wink to his
audience, describe “the specific methods used in these CIA interrogations”
because “it would help the terrorists learn how to resist questioning.” Although
these “procedures were tough,” they had proved vital, the President assured
us,  in extracting “information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhere
else”  and thus prevented Al Qaeda from “launching another attack against the
American  homeland.” If Congress and the Supreme Court would simply set aside
their  constitutional qualms about these “tough” methods, Bush concluded,
then the  “brave men and women” who work in this CIA program can continue “to
obtain  information that will save innocent lives.”
As in so many of these ticking-bomb tales, Bush’s supposed successes crumble
on closer examination. Just four days later, The New York Times reported
that the FBI claimed it got the key information from Abu Zubaydah with its
noncoercive methods and that other agencies already had much of his supposedly  “
vital” intelligence.
Like President Bush, influential pro-pain pundits  have long cited the
ticking-bomb scenario to defend torture as a necessary evil  in the war on terror.
Indeed, in this most pragmatic of modern societies, we are  witnessing a rare
triumph of academic philosophy in the realm of national  security.
More than thirty years ago, the philosopher Michael Walzer, writing about the
ancient problem of “dirty hands” for an obscure academic journal,
Philosophy  and Public Affairs, speculated about the morality of a politician “asked to
authorize the torture of a captured rebel leader who knows the locality of a
number of bombs hidden in apartment buildings around the city, set to go off
within the next twenty-four hours.” [Emphasis added.] Even though he
believes torture is “wrong, indeed abominable,” this moral politician orders the
man tortured, “convinced that he must do so for the sake of the people who
might  otherwise die in the explosions.”
In all likelihood, Walzer’s writing would have remained unnoticed on page 167
of an unread journal if not for the tireless efforts of an academic acolyte,
Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School. In newspaper op-eds and television
appearances since 9/11, Dershowitz has transformed this fragmentary
philosophical rumination into a full-blown case for torture by recounting a  similar
scenario which, often set in Times Square, “involves a captured  terrorist who
refuses to divulge information about the imminent use of weapons  of mass
destruction, such as a nuclear, chemical, or biological device, that are  capable of
killing and injuring thousands of civilians.”
From this hypothetical, Professor Dershowitz segues to the realm of reality:
“If torture is, in fact, being used and/or would, in fact, be used in an
actual  ticking bomb terrorist case, would it be normatively better or worse to
have  such torture regulated by some kind of warrant?” Such a warrant, he tells
us,  would authorize interrogators to shove steel needles under Arab
fingernails.  Dershowitz assumes that his putative torture warrants “would reduce the
incidence of abuses,” since high officials, operating on the record, would
never  authorize “methods of the kind shown in the Abu Ghraib photographs.”
With torture now a key weapon in the war on terror, the time has come to
interrogate the logic of the ticking time bomb with a six-point critique. For
this scenario embodies our deepest fears and makes most of us  quietly—
unwittingly—complicit in the Bush Administration’s recourse to  torture.
Number one: In the real world, the probability that a  terrorist might be
captured after concealing a ticking nuclear bomb in Times  Square and that his
captors would somehow recognize his significance is  phenomenally slender. The
scenario assumes a highly improbable array of  variables that runs something
like this:
—First, FBI or CIA agents apprehend a terrorist at the precise moment
between timer’s first tick and bomb’s burst.
—Second, the interrogators somehow have sufficiently detailed  foreknowledge
of the plot to know they must interrogate this very person and do  it right
now.
—Third, these same officers, for some unexplained reason, are missing  just a
few critical details that only this captive can divulge.
—Fourth, the biggest leap of all, these officers with just one shot  to get
the information that only this captive can divulge are best advised to  try
torture, as if beating him is the way to assure his wholehearted  cooperation.
Take the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, who sat in a Minneapolis cell in the
weeks before 9/11 under desultory investigation as a possible “suicide hijacker”
because the FBI did not have precise foreknowledge of Al Qaeda’s plot or
his  possible role. In pressing for a search warrant before 9/11, the bureau’s
Minneapolis field supervisor even warned Washington he was “trying to keep
someone from taking a plane and crashing into the World Trade Center.” But FBI
headquarters in Washington replied there was no evidence Moussaoui was a
terrorist—providing us with yet another reminder of how difficult it is to grasp
the significance of even such stunningly accurate insight or intelligence in
the  absence of foreknowledge.
“After the event,” Roberta Wohlstetter wrote in her classic study of that
other great U.S. intelligence failure, Pearl Harbor, “a signal is always
crystal  clear; we can now see what disaster it was signaling since the disaster has
occurred. But before the event, it is obscure and pregnant with conflicting
meanings.”
Number two: This scenario still rests on the  critical, utterly unexamined
assumption that torture can get useful intelligence  quickly from this or any
hardened terrorist.
Advocates of the ticking bomb often cite the brutal torture of Abdul Hakim
Murad in Manila in 1995, which they say stopped a plot to blow up a dozen
trans-Pacific aircraft and kill 4,000 innocent passengers. Except, of  course, for
the simple fact that Murad’s torture did nothing of the sort. As  The
Washington Post has reported, Manila police got all their important  information from
Murad in the first few minutes when they seized his laptop with  the entire
bomb plot. All the supposed details gained from the sixty-seven days  of
incessant beatings, spiced by techniques like cigarettes to the genitals,  were, as
one Filipino officer testified in a New York court, fabrications fed to  Murad
by Philippine police.
Even if the terrorist begins to talk under torture, interrogators have a hard
time figuring out whether he is telling the truth or not. Testing has found
that  professional interrogators perform within the 45 to 60 percent range in
separating truth from lies—little better than flipping a coin. Thus, as
intelligence data moves through three basic stages—acquisition, analysis, and
action—the chances that good intelligence will be ignored are high.
After fifty years of fighting enemies, communist and terrorist, with torture,
we now have sufficient evidence to conclude that torture of the few yields
little useful information. As the ancient Roman jurist Ulpian noted 1,800
years  ago, when tortured the strong will resist and the weak will say anything to
end  the pain.
History is replete with examples of the strong who resisted even the most
savage tortures. After the July 20, 1944, bomb plot against Hitler, the Gestapo
subjected Fabian von Schlabrendorff to four weeks of torture by metal spikes
and  beatings so severe he suffered a heart attack. But with a stoicism
typical of  these conspirators, he broke his silence only to give the Gestapo a few
scraps  of vague information when he feared involuntarily blurting out serious
intelligence.
Then there are the weak. Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, a senior Al Qaeda leader,
under torture told his captors that Iraq trained Al Qaeda in chemical and
biological weapons. This raises the possibility that he, like Murad, had been
tortured into giving fabricated intelligence. Colin Powell relied on this false
information in his now-disavowed speech to the United Nations before the Iraq
War.
As Yale legal historian John Langbein puts it, “History’s most important
lesson is that it has not been possible to make coercion compatible with  truth.”

Proponents of torture present a false choice between tortured intelligence
and no intelligence at all. There is, in fact, a well-established American
alternative to torture that we might call empathetic interrogation. U.S. Marines
first used this technique during World War II to extract accurate
intelligence  from fanatical Japanese captives on Saipan and Tinian within forty-eight
hours  of landing, and the FBI has practiced it with great success in the
decades  since. After the East Africa bombings of U.S. embassies, the bureau
employed  this method to gain some of our best intelligence on Al Qaeda and win U.S.
court  convictions of all of the accused.
One of the bureau agents who worked on that case, Dan Coleman, has since been
appalled by the CIA’s coercive methods after 9/11. “Have any of these guys
ever  tried to talk to anyone who’s been deprived of his clothes?” Coleman
asked.  “He’s going to be ashamed and humiliated and cold. He’ll tell you
anything you  want to hear to get his clothes back. There’s no value in it.” By
contrast, FBI  reliance on due process and empathy proved effective in terror
cases by building  rapport with detainees.
Bush’s example of Zubaydah actually supports Coleman’s point. FBI agents say
they were getting more out of him before the CIA came in with gloves off.
“Brutalization doesn’t work,” Coleman concluded from his years in FBI
counterterrorism. “We know that. Besides, you lose your soul.”
Number three: Once we agree to torture the one  terrorist with his
hypothetical ticking bomb, then we admit a possibility, even  an imperative, for
torturing hundreds who might have ticking bombs or thousands  who just might have
some knowledge about those bombs. “You can’t know whether a  person knows where
the bomb is,” explains Georgetown University Law Professor  David Cole, “or
even if they’re telling the truth. Because of this, you end up  going down a
slippery slope and sanctioning torture in general.”
Most of those rounded up by military sweeps in Iraq and Afghanistan for
imprisonment at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo had nothing to do with terrorism. A
recent analysis of the Pentagon listing of Guantánamo’s 517 detainees reveals
that 86 percent were arrested not by U.S. forces but by Northern Alliance and
Pakistani warlords eager to collect a $5,000 bounty for every “terrorist”
captured.
Ironically, though, torture of the many can produce results, albeit at a
surprisingly high political price.
The CIA tortured tens of thousands in Vietnam and the French tortured
hundreds of thousands in Algeria. During the Battle of Algiers in 1957, French
soldiers arrested 30 percent to 40 percent of all males in the city’s Casbah and
subjected most of these to what one French officer called “beatings, electric
shocks, and, in particular, water torture, which was always the most
dangerous  technique for the prisoner.” Though many resisted to the point of death,
mass  torture gained sufficient intelligence to break the rebel underground. The
CIA’s  Phoenix program no doubt damaged the Viet Cong’s communist
infrastructure by  torture-interrogation of countless South Vietnamese civilians.
So the choices are clear. Major success from limited, surgical torture is a
fable, a fiction. But mass torture of thousands of suspects, some guilty, most
innocent, can produce some useful intelligence.
Number four: Useful intelligence perhaps, but at what  cost? The price of
torture is unacceptably high because it disgraces and then  undermines the
country that countenances it. For the French in Algeria, for the  Americans in
Vietnam, and now for the Americans in Iraq, the costs have been  astronomical and
have outweighed any gains gathered by torture.
Official sources are nearly unanimous that the yield from the massive Phoenix
program, with more than forty prisons across South Vietnam systematically
torturing thousands of suspected communists, was surprisingly low. One Pentagon
contract study found that, in 1970-71, only 3 percent of the Viet Cong “
killed,  captured, or rallied were full or probationary Party members above the
district  level.” Not surprisingly, such a brutal pacification effort failed
either to  crush the Viet Cong or win the support of Vietnamese villagers,
contributing to  the ultimate U.S. defeat in the Vietnam War.
Similarly, the French army won the Battle of Algiers but soon lost the war
for Algeria, in part because their systematic torture delegitimated the larger
war effort in the eyes of most Algerians and many French. “You might say that
the Battle of Algiers was won through the use of torture,” observed British
journalist Sir Alistair Horne, “but that the war, the Algerian war, was  lost.
”
Even the comparatively limited torture at Abu Ghraib has done incalculable
damage to America’s international prestige.
In short, the intelligence gains are soon overwhelmed by political costs as
friends and enemies recoil in revulsion at such calculated savagery.
Indeed, the U.S. Army’s current field manual, FM: Intelligence  Interrogation
34-52, contains an implicit warning about these high political  costs: “
Revelation of use of torture by U.S. personnel,” it warns, “will bring  discredit
upon the U.S. and its armed forces while undermining domestic and
international support for the war effort.”
Number five: These dismal conclusions lead to a last,  uncomfortable
question: If torture produces limited gains at such high political  cost, why does any
rational American leader condone interrogation practices  “tantamount to
torture”?
One answer to this question seems to lie with a prescient CIA Cold War
observation about Soviet leaders in times of stress. “When feelings of  insecurity
develop within those holding power,” reads an agency analysis of  Kremlin
leadership applicable to the post-9/11 White House, “they become  increasingly
suspicious and put great pressures upon the secret police to obtain  arrests and
confessions. At such times, police officials are inclined to condone  anything
which produces a speedy ‘confession,’ and brutality may become  widespread.”
In sum, the powerful often turn to torture in times of crisis, not  because
it works but because it salves their fears and insecurities with the  psychic
balm of empowerment.
As we slide down the slippery slope to torture in general, we should also
realize that there is a chasm at the bottom called extrajudicial execution. With
the agency’s multinational gulag full of dozens, even hundreds, of detainees
of  dwindling utility, CIA agents, active and retired, have been vocal in
their  complaints about the costs and inconvenience of limitless, even lifetime,
incarceration for these tortured terrorists. The ideal solution to this
conundrum from an agency perspective is pump and dump, as in Vietnam—pump the
terrorists for information, and then dump the bodies. After all, the systematic
French torture of thousands from the Casbah of Algiers in 1957 also entailed
more than 3,000 “summary executions” as “an inseparable part” of this
campaign,  largely, as one French general put it, to ensure that “the machine of
justice”  not be “clogged with cases.” For similar reasons, the CIA’s Phoenix
program  produced, by the agency’s own count, over 20,000 extrajudicial
killings.
Number six: The use of torture to stop  ticking bombs leads ultimately to a
cruel choice—either legalize this brutality,  à la Dershowitz and Bush, or
accept that the logical corollary to  state-sanctioned torture is state-sponsored
murder, à la Vietnam.
Alfred W. McCoy, the J.R.W. Smail Professor of History at the University  of
Wisconsin-Madison, is the author most recently of “A Question of Torture: CIA
Interrogation, from the Cold War to the War on Terror.”
