Amazing Home Remedies

1. If you are choking on an ice cube, don't panic.
Simply pour a cup

of boiling water down your throat and presto! The
blockage will be

almost instantly removed.

2. Clumsy? Avoid cutting yourself while slicing
vegetables by getting

someone else to hold them while you chop away.

3. Avoid arguments with the Mrs. about lifting the
toilet seat by

simply using the sink.

4. For high blood pressure sufferers: simply cut
yourself and bleed

for a few minutes, thus reducing the pressure in your
veins. Remember

to use a timer.

5. A mouse trap, placed on top of your alarm clock,
will prevent you

from rolling over and going back to sleep after you
hit the snooze

button.

6. If you have a bad cough, take a large dose of
laxatives, then you

will be afraid to cough.

7. Have a bad toothache? Smash your thumb with a
hammer and you will

forget all about the toothache.

8. Sometimes, we just need to remember what the rules
of life really

are: You only need two tools - WD-40 and Duct Tape. If
it doesn't

move and should, use the WD-40. If it shouldn't move
and does, use

the duct tape.

9. Remember: Everyone seems normal until you get to
know them.

10. Some people are like slinkies.......... they are
not really good

for anything, but..... they still bring a smile to
your face when you

push them down a flight of stairs
