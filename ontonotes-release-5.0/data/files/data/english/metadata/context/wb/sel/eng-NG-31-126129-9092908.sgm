Dear Friends,

As of July 2006, a scientific study led by researchers at Johns
Hopkins found that 650,000 Iraqis had died as a result of the U.S.-led
invasion. Unfortunately, the death toll has continued to mount since
then.

It is likely that about ONE MILLION IRAQIS HAVE BEEN KILLED, according
to an updated estimate from the organization Just Foreign Policy.
That's more than were killed in the Rwandan genocide and far more than
were killed under Saddam.

And 4 million Iraqis are now refugees.

You can find more information, a frequently updated counter of Iraqi
deaths, and a petition to Congress urging them to end this war here:

SIGN PETITION TO US CONGRESS NOW!
Then PASS It ON!!!

Too bad this is just meaningless usenet, just words, flowing out like
endless rain into a paper cup.  Hollow threat.  Too bad. Are you under
the impression that anything you say here has any power at all?
Sheesh.  Fantasyville.  It would actually take some effort on your
part  to &quot;blow your ass and every other troll off this earth.&quot;  All
you can do is sit at your keybored and tippy-tap out hollow threats.
What a pathetic game.  See Berne's &quot;Games People Play.&quot;

The final statement is true, but I don't think it implies that without
the troops more Iraqis would die. The current level of internal violence
is, after all, high even by middle eastern standards. We don't know what
would happen if there were no foreign troops involved.

Currently we have:

Iraqis killing Iraqis
Americans killing Iraqis
Iraqis killing Americans

Remove the Americans from the equation, and you will have:

Iraqis killing Iraqis

Sounds like an improvement to me.

Allegedly the goal is to establish a Democracy--a state in which the
Iraqi people decide what happens.  If that ever happens, the result
will be total slaughter until either the Sunni or the Shiites (or
possibly both) don't exist any more.  It's what they want to do.
Any *real*, devout Sunni wants all the Shiites dead, and any *real*,
devout Shiite wants all the Sunnis dead.  Neither group is about
to abandon their faith.

Over the past 1300+ years there have been lots of Muslim states ruled by
Sunnis (most of them) and quite a lot by Shia. So far as I know, the
sort of slaughter you describe has never occurred.

By force.  If US troops can somehow guarantee an election in which
every adult Iraqi can cast a ballot without coercion, and in which all
the ballots are counted, the result of the election will be that there
will be no more elections, as that's what the majority want in Iraq.

Strangely, that's not actually less true than saying that any &quot;*real*,
devout&quot; Christian wants all the non-Christians dead. The division
between Sunni and Shiite is as much politics and ethnic as religious;
and its importance has waxed and waned over the last ~17,000 months.
Saddam Hussein deliberately heightened the tensions within his domain
for much the same reason that George Wallace and Slobodan Milosevic
did--to promote his personal power by keeping his subjects
divided--though Hussein was different from them by boosting the
minority over the majority. More like Ian Smith or P. W. Botha in that
way.

Yep; we have way too many of them in the USA.

Lazy, twice-a-year Christians don't bomb abortion clinics, sabotage the
educational system, or harras the families of fallen soldiers at funerals.
Decadent, easy-going Muslims don't fly planes into skyscrapers.  Tepid
Hindus don't drag their widowed in-laws onto funeral pyres.  Slackerworld
would be a nice place to live.
