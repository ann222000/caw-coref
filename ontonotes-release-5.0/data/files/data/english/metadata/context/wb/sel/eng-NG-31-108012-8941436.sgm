I am looking for recommendations on chilli sauces.

I love Tabasco Sauce and would like to try similar chilli sauces.  From
memory, people seem to like Marie Sharp's Hot Red Habanero, but it is such a
mine field out there, I am totally lost.

Any recommendations?

What's wrong with Tabasco? Their green variety is not as hot as
the red but both will lose their fire with time.

There's Asian Chili Sauce. It's a very mild heat &quot;sweet and sour&quot; sauce.

Like SW said, way too much vinegar.  Same with Texas Pete.  Cholula
can be good on fried chicken.  Good, not great.

It's pretty hot, at least as hot as the alternatives, and tastes

My favorite lately is El Yucateco's bright (almost fluorescent) green
hot sauce.  The red-flavored is hotter, but the green tastes better.
A 4-ounce bottle doesn't last very long.  For a while I could get

The El Yucateco is definitely better than Tabasco,   That's not
necessarily high praise.  All of them are to vinegary.  I like roasted
green chilies, pureed with some tomatillo, tomato, and a tiny bit of
garlic.  That's a much better &quot;chilli sauce&quot; than the Tabasco-type
stuff.

I like the way the vinegar in Tabasco inhances flavors.   That  touch

much &quot;heat&quot; they want.  I personally don't think Tabasco (the red one) is
all that hot.  But then again, I'm not one of those people who wants a hot
sauce that will obliterate the taste of food by virtue of searing my tongue.

A lot depends on your taste. Like many others, I find
Tabasco too vinegary. Similiar types of hot sauce are
Crystal and Louisianna brands. I like those better, since
the vinegar taste isn't as overpowering. Among these types
of sauces, I think I like Cholula the best.

I like Tabasco Chipotle a whole lot. It's a bit hotter than
standard Tabasco, and not as vinegary.

I like Tabasco Habanaro, too. It's incindiary, but not
stupid-hot, like a lot of the &quot;macho one-ups-manship&quot; sauces
that are more a chemistry experiment than a condiment.

Someone else mentioned the Sriracha sauce. This is a thick
sauce, looks like catsup. It contains no tomatoes. It's
pretty much pureed red ripe serrano chiles and garlic. Very
tasty. Also pretty hot.

What I use most these days is pure powdered chipotle chiles.
I used to get this in the local hot sauce store, but
since it went out of business, I've found it on the net.
I buy it in bulk, one-pound packages, from Los Chilereos
de Nuevo Mexico. Since it's a dry powder that doesn't
need refrigeration, it's easy to put it in one of those
little picnic shakers and take it with you. It's great on
hamburgers, or mixed in with the catsup for french fries.

Tobasco sauce just doesn't taste good to me, other brands of chili sauce
have better flavour not just heat...Frank's or other brands just taste
better...not as bitter as tobasco sauce.

Using a mixed chile sauce made with different vinegars just seems to
taste better. Heat is ok but good flavour is better.

It's the acetic acid (vinegar), not the capsaicin, that obliterates
taste.

Hot food is not just about macho posturing, not that that doesn't
happen*, but people eat fiery hot food alone, in the privacy of our
own homes, and enjoy them.

* When me, and my two fellow maniac bandmates each took a half dropper
full of Pure Cap straight into the mouth, that was largely macho
posturing, or male bonding, if you want to use that term.  We were on
a gravel bar, and alcohol was involved.

You should also look at salsas. They can achieve spicy hot-hot-hot levels
as the chili sauces but provide a more &quot;edible&quot; consistency.

I'd hot sauce an omelette. Salsa would chill it too much.

I'd hot sauce a batch of guacamole to heat it up. Salsa would water it
down.

I'd use salsa for dipping sauces (chips, tenders, etc.). Hot sauce would be
too spotty to apply.

I'd salsa over a burrito. You can't sop up a bite in hot sauce.

I'd hot sauce a &quot;buffalo wing&quot; coating. Salsa would just drip off.

I'd salsa a hotdog before I'd hot sauce one.

There's good use for both, just don't overlook salsas, imho.

Happy hunting,

Andy

&gt; Tabasco sauce is lame - way too much vinegar.

&gt; Anything from Costa Rica is good.  Sontova is another good one,
&gt; as are all of Maries as you noted.  The only problem is they come
&gt; in such tiny bottles they're only good for 4-5 uses at
&gt; $.50-$.75/serving.

&gt; Huy Fong Sriracha is for everyday use, and it comes in 26oz
&gt; bottles at the same price as the 4opz bottles of the &quot;designer&quot;
&gt; hot sauces.

Sriracha is pretty much an unbeatable value for an everyday cooking
versatile chili sauce. My kitchen is never without a big bottle of it.

I got some of that, based on your recommendation and yes, it is very

Steve, I tried your idea of mixing sriracha with mayo...very good!  I

Just visit one of the markets in either of the two Vietnamese shopping
centers on Washington Ave in Philly. One is only 2 blocks over from the
Italian market. They have cases of the squirt bottles in two sizes and
hoisin sauce at the end of the aisle. Both are popular with Vietnamese
people so it is always fresh. While there you could wander over to Pho75
or one of the other pho joints and have great pho. Sriracha is a
standard condiment on every table.

George,

For a few years you've recommended I visit Pho75 and I keep forgetting.
Apologies. I just GoogleEarth'd Pho75, Philadelphia, PA and got rushed
right down to their &quot;front door&quot; and then clicking on it, it brought up
customer reviews, all excellent.

I'm make it there next week! NOW, if I mention I know George, will they
give me a discount or charge me double? &lt;VBG&gt;

Thanks!

Andy

&gt; &gt; Tabasco sauce is lame - way too much vinegar.

&gt; &gt; Anything from Costa Rica is good.  Sontova is another good one,

&gt; &gt; Huy Fong Sriracha is for everyday use, and it comes in 26oz

Same here.  Toss some deep fried chicken wings into it and you've got

They might, doesn't hurt to ask. If you never had pho you pick the cut
of beef or combination you want and they put thin strips of raw beef in
the bowl which cook on the way to the table. You can also ask for the
raw beef on the side and add it yourself. You also get a side plate with
bean sprouts, basil and lime which you add to the bowl. There is
sriracha and hoisin in squirt bottles on each table which some people
put into the little dish and use as a dip for the meat.

If you are still hungry for some reason you could get a banh mi at Ba Le
bakery (big white building right on the corner, entrance faces
Washington - in the mall on 6th and Washington)). They also have good
baked goods and Vietnamese coffee and also have a pho restaurant in the
rear (Pho Ba Le).

They have chicken pho, but chicken was not common in Vietnam. I make
chicken pho at home fairly often.

If you want beef, most of the places offer rare eye round, flank,
brisket and meatballs, they give you a choice on the menu.  IMO, the
meatballs (bo vien) taste like rubber. You can also order pho with
tendon or tripe.

Some restaurants call themselves Noodle Shops, all they sell is Pho. It
is a main dish, and it comes to you in a large bowl. I have never seen
anyone, at my table, eat the entire bowl.  You get a little meat and a
lot of noodles.  You add the rest of the vegetables at your table.

Eating the noodles with chopsticks is part of the fun.  Wear a shirt
with a lot of pattern.

There's a Thai &quot;Noodi Bar&quot; in town that just sprang up. Haven't been there
yet. I'll give Pho75 the first try.

From the sound of it, I could easily manage to eat an entire bowl. Only
problem I perceive is the chopsticks. I'll need a couple hours head start
unless I can just pour it in me.

The Pho restaurant I go to has two sizes, regular and large. The
regular size is about right for lunch but the large is just
that! I've seen people share a large order. I usually put *all*
of the bean sprouts, basil, lime and chilies into the soup and
stir it up with a tablespoon of hoisin sauce (provided). A 1:1
mixture of siracha chilli sauce with hoisin is good for dipping
the meats. There probably will be nuoc mam (sp?) fish sauce on
the table but I'd stay away from that :-) Not all Pho places
have it but there is a chicken soup variety with white or dark
chicken that I like.

They usually have Vietnamese coffee which you might like, fresh
lemonade and spring rolls that you might order (or share) if you
are feeling hungry.

Depends, beef is the most common and popular. I don't know if Pho75 has
chicken. There are at least 3 Pho shops between the two Washington Ave
malls so you could check them out to see if they have chicken.

I know their is a Vietnamese-Thai place on Race St. in Chinatown that
has chicken. Thats actually a nice walk up from Washington if its a nice
day. I try to stick with places that only serve Pho.

The shops I mentioned are actually not in Philly Chinatown but just

&gt;&gt;Philadelphia has a nice China Town. I especially liked the arched sign
&gt;&gt;at the entrance.

&gt;&gt;Becca

&gt; d.c.'s chinatown has a 'friendship arch' as well:

I've never seen Philly's &quot;Chinatown.&quot;

Where's it located?!! How big (city blocks) is it?

I saw a bit of it when I went to the flower show in February,
on the back side of the convention center closer to the bridge.

I noticed it because they were having a celebration with fireworks
during the day.
