Hello all - This is the text of the &quot;Page&quot; with the same title, which
includes the graphic,  Starr*

Hello all,

I'm delighted that the following link to a video called &quot;The Sixth
Sun&quot; is now available. So I wanted to share a movie with you about the
ancient prophecies of many indigenous cultures around the world about
2012 and the approaching time of collective awakening: You can view
the 10 minute trailer at:

Some might be surprised that I started a group called the
&quot;SixthSunLiving&quot; about six years ago to herald in the new Cycle/Sun
(according to the Aztecs). I think naming the Shift the Sixth Sun is
accurate in that there are seven cycles predicted for planet
earth...so this would leave one more after the Sixth.

In the video, from the link, it asks for the Female Principles to come
forward into the Sixth Cycle...so you will see some of the thrust of
the group was started for that purpose (see below)

SixthSunLiving · Herald of the Sixth Sun

This group is dedicated to heralding in the Sixth Sun which will bring
harmony and balance through the infusion of the Female Principle
