Giving Bush His Due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>A new article out today by Martin Peretz, a radical lefty in the 60's
and 70's, speaks about how the lefties refuse to give Bush any credit
for anything (hat tip The Captain ). Why is this? Mr. Peretz gives his
opinion: (I posted it in full since The New Republic requires
registration) If George W. Bush were to discover a cure for cancer, his
critics would denouncehim for having done it unilaterally, without
adequate consultation, with a crude disregard for the sensibilities of
others. He pursued his goal obstinately, they would say, without
filtering his thoughts through the medical research establishment. And
he didn't share his research with competing labs and thus caused
resentment among other scientists who didn't have the resources or the
bold--perhaps even somewhat reckless--instincts to pursue the task as he
did. And he completely ignored the World Health Organization, showing
his contempt for international institutions. Anyway, a cure for cancer
is all fine and nice, but what about aids? No, the president has not
discovered a cure for cancer. But there is a pathology, a historical
pathology, that he has attacked with unprecedented vigor and with
unprecedented success. I refer, of course, to the political culture of
the Middle East, which the president may actually have changed. And he
has accomplished this genuinely momentous transformation in ways that
virtually the entire foreign affairs clerisy--the cold-blooded Brent
Scowcroft realist Republicans and almost all the Democrats--never
thought possible. Or, perhaps, in ways some of them thought positively
undesirable. Bush, it now seems safe to say, is one of the great
surprises in modern U.S. history. Nothing about his past suggested that
he harbored these ideals nor the qualities of character required for
their realization. Right up to the moment Bush became president, I was
convinced that his mind, at least on matters Levantine, belonged to his
father and to James Baker III, whose worldview seemed to be defined by
the pecuniary prejudice of oil and Texas: Keep the ruling Arabs happy.
But I was wrong, and, in light of what has already been achieved in the
Middle East, I am glad to say so. Most American liberals, alas, enjoy no
similar gladness. They are not exactly pleased by the positive results
of Bush's campaign in the Middle East. They deny and resent and begrudge
and snipe. They are trapped in the politics of churlishness. The
achievements of Bush's foreign policy abroad represent a revolution in
the foreign policy culture at home. The traditional Republican mentality
that was so perfectly and meanly represented by Bush p√®re and Baker
precluded the United States from pressing the Arabs about reform--about
anything--for decades. Not Iraq about its tyranny and its record of
genocide, not Syria about its military occupation of Lebanon and its own
brutal Baathist dictatorship, not Egypt about loosening the crippling
bonds of a statist economy and an authoritarian political system, not
Saudi Arabia about its championing of the Wahhabi extremism that made
its own country so desiccated and the world so dangerous, and certainly
not the Palestinians about the fantasy that they had won all the wars
that they had actually lost and were therefore entitled to the full
rewards due them from their victories. This was the state of U.S.-Arab
relations in 2001: The United States was actually more frightened of the
Arabs than they were of us. The extraordinary report of the 9/11
Commission about the delinquent reactions to the decade-long lead-up to
the catastrophe of September 11 only confirms this impression of
official U.S. pusillanimity. The Clinton administration seized on every
possible excuse--from the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993,
right through the atrocities in Kenya and Tanzania, to the attack on the
USS Cole--not to respond meaningfully to Osama bin Laden. This
aggressively dilatory approach was set early on, when Bill Clinton's
first secretary of state, dead-man-walking Warren Christopher, proposed
that a special bureau be set up to deal with drugs, crime, and terrorism
in a single office, as if terrorism is a problem for policemen and not
for strategists. The 9/11 Commission Report records that only
congressional opposition aborted Christopher's concoction. Attorney
General Janet Reno always worried about retaliation against any moves by
the United States; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, preoccupied
with her "push for a peace agreement between the Palestinians and
Israelis," was concerned that military strikes against the bin Laden
operations in Afghanistan would strengthen the Taliban; National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger fretted that a shoot-out might be seen as
an assassination, and, always the trade lawyer, he consistently held out
hope that some sort of carrot would turn the Taliban against bin Laden;
General Anthony Zinni was more concerned about human rights abuses by
the Taliban than by its hospitality to Al Qaeda and worried also that a
mosque might be damaged in the course of bombing operations; Pentagon
officials warned that a missile aimed at bin Laden might kill a visiting
Emirati prince instead (but why was a UAE prince hanging out with bin
Laden anyway?); and CIA Director George Tenet had so many objections to
decisive action that it would be nearly impossible to enumerate them.
The above paragraph succinctly describes the reason Bin Laden felt we
were a "paper tiger" to begin with. Cowards all of them. Clinton, it is
true, resolved to eliminate bin Laden, but soon he eliminated his desire
to eliminate him. The Clinton administration's true desire was to arrest
bin Laden, to indict him, and to put him on trial--to "bring him to
justice," as these men and women pompously exhorted each other. Except
Berger also feared that bin Laden would be acquitted in a U.S. court of
law. CIA personnel trying to cut a deal with the Northern Alliance to
capture bin Laden warned that, if the Afghan "tribals"--that's the
orientalism of liberals--did not bring him in alive but, heaven forbid,
actually killed him, they would not be paid for their labors. The
charismatic leader of the Afghan opposition and our best contact with
it, Ahmed Shah Massoud, who was assassinated two days before September
11, thought he was dealing with madmen. The new Bush presidency also
found it hard to wrap its hands around the Al Qaeda phenomenon and
preferred to focus instead on Star Wars redivivus--until, of course, a
catastrophe in Lower Manhattan concentrated its mind. What the Bush
administration gradually came to realize was that fighting the Muslim
terrorist international could not be done in a vacuum. If the Islamic
and Arab orbits were to continue to revolve around sanguinary tyrannies,
there would be no popular basis in civil society to rob the cult of
suicidal murder of its prestige. So, rather than being a distraction
from the struggle against the armed rage suffusing these at once taut
and eruptive polities, confronting their governments was actually
intrinsic to that struggle. The Bush administration recognized that
removing the effect means removing the cause. The 9/11 Commission seems
to have grasped this, too, at least in its citations of Richard Clarke's
assertion that bin Laden and Saddam Hussein, Al Qaeda and the Iraqi
Baath could be natural allies. History has never traveled in the Middle
East as fast as it has during the last two years. In this place where
time seems to have stopped, time has suddenly accelerated. It may be
true (more likely, it is not) that a deep yearning for democracy has
been latent throughout the region for a long time. There certainly was a
basis in reality for skepticism about the Arabs' hospitability to the
opening of their societies. Whatever the proper historical and cultural
analysis of the past, however, the fact is that democracy did not begin
even to breathe until the small coalition of Western nations led by the
United States destroyed the most ruthless dictatorship in the area.
Democracy in Mesopotamia? A fantasy, surely. But not quite. Iraq was,
despite its unbelievably bloody history, a rather sophisticated place.
During the nineteenth century, many Baghdadis went abroad to study.
Modern nationalism sank some roots. Baghdad itself had a plurality of
Jews, learned and mercantile, until they fled to the new state of
Israel. An ancient minority of Christians survived into the age of Sunni
pogroms and survives--though in lesser numbers--still. The Kurds grew
relatively tolerant in the areas they dominated. And the majority Shia,
though viciously persecuted from the founding of the Iraqi state after
World War I--with the not-so-passive consent of the British
colonials--and condemned to near-genocide by Saddam's revolutionary
republic, have generally maintained the restraint that piety sometimes
allows. After a year and a half of nearly daily Sunni bloodletting among
them, the Shia have not wreaked the vengeance they surely could and,
equally as surely, some of them long to take. Remember all the lefties
screaming there would be a bloodbath of revenge by the Shia? Come on
people, don't you know these are uncivilized heathens which only know
violence, they are sure to kill all the Sunni's and then Bush will have
created a civil war.....bleh. The U.S. liberation-occupation has now
tried to cobble together these diverging Iraqis into the beginnings of a
democratic regime. Wonder of wonders, these estranged cousins have shown
some talent in the art of compromise; and trying to make this polity
work is hardly an effort undertaken without courage. The judge who was
killed with his son outside his home on his way to work at the tribunal
that will try Saddam knew that danger stalked him, and so did the rest
of the victims of Sunni bloodlust. This bloodlust evokes an unmistakable
but macabre schadenfreude among many critics of the war, who want
nothing of history except to be proved right. It is as if suicide
bombings and other sorts of helter-skelter murder were a just judgment
on the wrongdoings--yes, there have been wrongdoings, some of them
really disgusting--of the Bush administration. And, even if ridding
western Asia of Saddam is reluctantly accepted as justified, what
blogger couldn't have accomplished what came after more deftly? In any
case, this churlish orthodoxy tells us that the Sunnis need to be
enticed into the political game lest it be deemed illegitimate. In this
scenario, it is the murderers who withhold or bestow moral authority.
John F. Burns, the defiantly honest New York Times journalist in
Baghdad, who has consistently reported the ambiguous and truly tangled
realities of the war, now sees the Baathist and Sunni warriors in
retreat, if not actually beaten. What will probably happen in Iraq is a
version of what endured for decades in Lebanon: a representative
government rooted in sect--argumentative, perhaps even corrupt, but
functioning. Lebanon was never perfect, but it worked reasonably well,
until the aggressive Palestinian guests took to commanding Shia turf to
establish a "state within a state." (This was a phenomenon that the
nimble Thomas L. Friedman did not much report on in the first leg of his
journey From Beirut to Jerusalem, confiding that fear for his life and
livelihood kept him from deviating too far from the Palestinian story as
they wanted it told. Eason Jordan avant la lettre.) The fine fruits of
the Bush administration's indifference to international opinion may be
seen now in Lebanon, too. What is happening there is the most concrete
intra-Arab consequence of the Iraq war. Nothing could be done in Lebanon
without Syria's sanction, no government decision without the approval of
Damascus, no business without a hefty Damascene percentage. Syrian
troops and spies were everywhere. Lebanese of all sects and clans have
been restive for years. But they lived in the fearful memory of their
mad civil war, the civil war of the daily car bombs in the marketplace.
Suddenly, the elections in Iraq, Bush's main achievement there,
exhilarating and inspiring, sprung loose the psychological impediments
that shackled the Lebanese to Syria. Even if the outcomes will not be
exactly the same, this was Prague and Berlin at the end of the long
subjugation to their neighbor to the east. More immediately, this was
Kiev only a few months ago. The first mass protest against the Syrians
and their satrap prime minister drew tens of thousands. Then there was
the much larger crowd of pro-Syria Shia from the south, a disconcerting
moment. But, after that, a multitude so huge that it defied counting,
and so diverse. This was the true cedar revolution, a revolution of the
young, for independence, for freedom from the failing but always brutal
Damascus regime next door. Will Vladimir Putin be so stupid as to invest
credit and arms in the stiff and callow son of Hafez Al Assad? This
remains to be seen from Putin, but rest assured....the Syrians leaving
Lebanon is not just some fluke, the demonstrations were not a fluke,
this was the youth of that country seeing what a real Democracy looks
like and wanting the same for their country...thanks to President Bush.
None of this happened by spontaneous generation. Yes, there were lucky
breaks: Yasir Arafat died, Syria conspired somehow to have former
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri assassinated. And yes, the new
directions are young, and the autocratic-theocratic political culture of
the Middle East is old, and it is once again too early to proclaim that
the mission has been accomplished. As the ancient Israelite king
observed, let he who girds his harness not boast as he who takes it off.
But the mission is nonetheless real, and far along, and it is showing
thrilling accomplishments. It is simply stupid, empirically and
philosophically, to deny that all or any of this would have happened
without the deeply unpopular but historically grand initiative of Bush.
The hundreds of thousands of young people in Martyrs' Square knew that
they had Bush's backing. The president seems even to have enticed
Jacques Chirac into a more active policy toward Lebanon: For him, too,
Syria had to go. If this satisfies Chirac's yearning for la gloire, so
be it. (But it will not be so easy to maintain such alliances: Already,
Security Council members are said to be working up plans to put the
future of Lebanon under the protective care of the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon, when nothing in unifil's past--nothing--should
provide confidence that it is able, or even disposed, to act decisively
against Arab brutality.) Agreed, the UN is a complete waste and
incapable of securing the local shopping mall. What is occurring in
Saudi Arabia and Egypt is also heartening, if more than a bit tentative.
Under pressure from the Bush administration, the Saudis have allowed the
first local elections in the country's history: an election to bodies
that cannot make big decisions, and an election limited to male voters,
naturally. But infidels (that is, Shia) may also vote. By Saudi
standards, this is the revolution of 1848. In Egypt, responding to the
insistence of the Bush people, President Hosni Mubarak has allowed that
he will permit opponents to run in the presidential elections against
him. Mubarak has no chance of losing ... this time. Maybe, however, the
son will not be the father's inevitable successor, and maybe the Arab
custom of turning dictatorships into dynasties will also come to an end,
at least in Cairo. And, in the brave figure of Ayman Nour, the world now
has a hero of the anti-Mubarak forces to celebrate and to support. In
both countries, to be sure, what we are seeing are the bare beginnings
of a democratic process, the very bare beginnings. It will be years,
maybe decades, before these become democratic polities. And there is
always the chance--as was the case in Algeria, once the jewel in the
shabby crown of the "nonaligned"--that the vox populi will vote wrong.
In the Algerian instance, it had to vote wrong: The choice was between
national fascists and pious fascists. Take your pick. So the situation
is certainly complex. But complexity is not a warrant for despair. The
significant fact is that Bush's obsession with the democratization of
the region is working. Have Democrats begun to wonder how it came to
pass that this noble cause became the work of Republicans? They should
wonder if they care to regain power. They should recall that Clinton
(and the sanctimonious Jimmy Carter even more so) had absolutely no
interest in trying to modify the harsh political character of the Arab
world. What they aspired to do was to mollify the dictators--to prefer
the furthering of the peace process to the furthering of the conditions
that make peace possible. The Democrats were the ones who were always
elevating Arafat. He was at the very center of their road map. After he
stalked out of a meeting room in Paris during cease-fire talks in late
2000, Albright actually ran in breathless pursuit to lure him back. It
was the Democrats who perpetuated Arafat's demonic sway over the
Palestinians, and it was the Democrats who sustained him among the other
Arabs. And so the cause of Arab democracy was left for the Republicans
to pursue. After September 11, the cause became a matter also of U.S.
national security. The great diversion from the real politics of the
Arab countries, and from the prospect of political reform, was the
Palestinian grievance against Israel. In the early years of their
conflict with the Zionists, the Palestinians thought that these
countries would fight their battles for them, at the negotiating table
and on the battlefield, which they did. But what happened in reality was
that the various Arabs exploited the Palestinians as pawns in their own
ambitions to pick off pieces of Palestine for themselves. That is why
there was no Palestinian state in the West Bank or Gaza after the
armistice of 1949, as one might have expected from the Partition Plan of
1947. The West Bank was annexed to Jordan. Gaza was not annexed but
administratively attached to Egypt. Syria's armies won no decisive
battles against the Jews; otherwise, they also would have taken a piece
of Palestine. In any event, until the Six Days War, the Palestinian
groan against the Jews was focused on the very existence of Israel
within narrow and perilous borders, without strategic depth, without old
Jerusalem, without the West Bank, without Gaza. And Arab governments
deflected the ample internal plaints of their own peoples with mobilized
hysteria against the Jews. Every domestic grievance was dispersed with
rousing rhetoric against Israel. The sun of Gamal Abdel Nasser rose and
set with Cairo's failures in its wars with Israel. Hatred of the
Zionists levitated the Baath dictatorships of both Iraq and Syria. In
the end, after five wars and two intifadas, the Palestinians still
seethed. But it had all come to nothing. And, finally, the angel of
death unilaterally attacked Arafat. Bush had had the good sense to pay
no attention to him, despite the urgent imprecations of the usual
apologists: the European Union, the United Nations, France, Russia, and
the editorial page of the Times. Had Bush made even a single
accommodation to Arafat, Arafat's way in the world would have been
enshrined in Palestinian lore for yet another generation as the only
way. But Bush didn't, and Ariel Sharon didn't, either. Now that there is
some real hope among both Israelis and Palestinians about the future,
let us examine the reasons for it. The first is that Bush made no
gestures to the hyperbolic fantasies of Palestinian politics. He gave
them one dose of reality after another. The second is that he gave
Israel the confidence that he would not trade its security for
anything--which means that Israel is now willing to cede much on its
own. (Israeli dovishness for American hawkishness: This was always the
only way.) The third is that Bush is holding Sharon to his commitments,
and everyone who is at all rational on these issues now sees the Israeli
prime minister as a man of his word and a man of history. After all,
Sharon has broken with much of his own political party. Not for nothing
is he now the designated assassination target of the Israeli hard right.
Still, holding Sharon to his word also means holding Mahmoud Abbas to
his. So far, the record is mixed. The serious shutting down of the
terrorist militias has not yet begun, but the Palestinian Authority did
run reasonably free local elections, and they were not accompanied by
killing. It is true that Hamas won more of these races than makes either
Sharon or Abbas comfortable, and its strength may even increase in the
coming parliamentary voting. But this, too, is a part of the gamble of
democracy; and, to the extent that the Palestinians are taking this
gamble and following the newest fashion among the other Arabs, it is a
tribute to the inked purple fingers of Iraq, which is to say, a tribute
to Bush and his simplistic but effective trust in the polling place. It
has been heartening, in recent months, to watch some Democratic senators
searching for ways out of the politics of churlishness. Some liberals
appear to have understood that history is moving swiftly and in a good
direction, and that history has no time for their old and mistaken
suspicion of American power in the service of American values. One does
not have to admire a lot about George W. Bush to admire what he has so
far wrought. One need only be a thoughtful American with an interest in
proliferating liberalism around the world. And, if liberals are
unwilling to proliferate liberalism, then conservatives will. Rarely has
there been a sweeter irony.</P>
