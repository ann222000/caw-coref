Yes...why the heck have one if you aren't going to check it? Also...I
hate my cell phone. It's never dependable and when I need it the most
is when it always fritz's out!! An who the heck thinks they are so
important they can't wait to make a call when they aren't behind the
wheel of a 2000 pound vehicle?

Uh-oh.  I'm sorry Magcrest!  I am one of those people.

My friends yell at me all the time.  I am the worst phone person.  I
just hate talking on the phone, and I hate retrieving messages even
more.

It must be genetic.  My mother is even worse.  I don't even know why
she has a cell phone.  She'll call me like three months after I've
left a message on her cell phone, and say, &quot;Oh, I was just returning
your call.&quot;  I usually have no idea what she is talking about, since I
have probably talked to her a thousand times since I left the
message.

In my defense, I usually look at my &quot;missed&quot; calls, and just call the
person back.  But, I usually don't check my messages.

Magcrest,

What I hate even worse is people not listening to the voicemail you
leave them. You leave a detailed voicemail of what you needed/wanted
to say, 1/2  hour later as you are driving or something they call you
back. When you ask if they got the voicemail they say no I just saw
your number in my caller ID. THEN, of course, you have to repeat the
whole damn message over!

I am one of the last holdouts in the country.   I don't own a
cellphone.   Don't want one.   Don't need to be on the phone in the
car, at the store, walking down the street, in the library, in the
restaurant, etc.etc.etc.etc.etc.      I find cellphone users who live
their lives with a phone stuck to their ears to be rude.   I really
hated it when someone would come into the restaurant to pick up an
order and
be on the phone the whole time during the transaction.   It's just
dismissive and rude.   People need tobe required to  have a course in
manners when they buy a cell phone.

Oh, and don't get me started on the fucking ringtones.

Isn't that a benefit of voice mail and caller id...that you don't have
to talk to people other than on your own terms?  I never answer a call
on the home or cell phone unless I know who it is.  I return messages
at my convenience.

I think the difference is generational G_Ma.   Young people think they
have to be connected to their friends etc., at every waking moment.
I don't understand this phenomenon.  Personally, I really don't want
to be that available all the time.   I mean, really, what is the need
to run your mouth constantly?    hehe

Here here! I'm with you Mags!

While I do own a cell phone, I don't hang on the thing like it's part
of my head. It usually stays in my pocket. I turn off the ringer when
I go to restaurants, and I also do something that others seem to have
a hard time with: I talk in a normal voice when speaking on the phone.
No reason to SHOUT!

As far as voicemail...I find it much simpler to just hang up. I almost
never leave voicemail? Why do it? If you're calling another cell, they
are going to see that you called and call you back. I have a friend of
mine that leaves voice mails that are literally 2-3 minutes long:

...kev...what's going on? Just checkin' in. Uh....hey, did you see
that Favre is going to stay for another year? I heard it today on the
radio while I was driving back from the airport---------
silence------------oh yeah. I'll be flying out to Seattle again this
week so I'll try to call you when I get to the airport. Hey, are you
still working early mornings? Anyway...call me back when you get time.
Or maybe I'll call you back later. I was just wondering.......what the
heck is going on. So...see yah kev. Oh yeah. I found out that those
tickets will be cheaper than I thought. I told you about that right.
Christy has a friend that works for this guy that has season tickets,
so we're going to get them from him. So that's cool. Anyway...just
thought I'd check in. Gimme a call back. Ok. Talk to yah later. Bye.
Call me back.

And no, that isn't an exaggeration. There is always these long pauses
between points. It's pretty funny. So normally I don't even listen to
this guys messages anymore. I told him if he gets my email...just hang
up and I'll see that he called.

You should have seen me last week.  I dropped my phone in the water
when I was out of town and I panicked.  Ruined my phone of course and
we rushed over to a store so I could get a new one, then TWO days
later the new one messed up and I panicked and we had to find a store
in Pennsylvania so I could buy another one.  If I forget my phone at
home I will turn around and go get it.  It's like my purse I feel
weird if I don't have it with me.

I have a cell phone but only because of my students.  I prefer their
parents call me on the pay-as-you-go and not have my home number - and
I am with you on the rest of the post!

&gt; I am one of the last holdouts in the country.   I don't own a

&gt; restaurant, etc.etc.etc.etc.etc.      I find cellphone users who live
&gt; their lives with a phone stuck to their ears to be rude.   I really
&gt; hated it when someone would come into the restaurant to pick up an
&gt; order and
&gt; be on the phone the whole time during the transaction.   It's just
&gt; dismissive and rude.   People need tobe required to  have a course in
&gt; manners when they buy a cell phone.

&gt; Oh, and don't get me started on the fucking ringtones.

&gt; &gt; &gt; What I hate even worse is people not listening to the voicemail you
&gt; &gt; &gt; leave them. You leave a detailed voicemail of what you needed/wanted
&gt; &gt; &gt; to say, 1/2  hour later as you are driving or something they call you
&gt; &gt; &gt; back. When you ask if they got the voicemail they say no I just saw

ISM,

Agreed. One of my sons is in the cell phone business and here is how
he explained it to me. I. being an old fart, still view a &quot;phone&quot; as a
communication device meant to be used to relay information. This
generation views their cell as a staus symbol and as an entertainment
device meant to avoid dreaded &quot;boredoom.&quot; Your bored standing in the
check-out line for 5 whole minutes and are terrified that geeky
looking guy will actually say hello? Flip open your phone and text
your girlfiend all about the cute shoes you just bought, etc. etc.

Yes, my grandson will text message all day long, but seldom makes a
call.  Clearly, it would be more efficient to simply make a call most
of the time.  Isn't talking much quicker than taking the time to write
a text message?  The texting is part of the fun, possibily because it
is different than their parents, or grandparents.  It's a difference
based upon personal choice, IMO.

I had a cell phone back when they were virtually luggage size.  You
didn' t talk long because of the cost and your arm would wear out
because of the weight.  Hubby got it for me because I spent so much
time on the road.

I don't go anywhere without the cell phone because I consider it to be
a security and convenience feature, but I don't make many calls since
I retired.  I used to spend considerable time talking to clients and
would spend also travel time catching up with our daughter who
normally drove at the same time.

I consider my phones to be for my convenience.  Caller ID allows us to
take calls at our convenience.  I think it's wonderful.  I will listen
to voice mail and I appreciate when people leave a clue about why they
called.  If it's just to visit, it tells me to call when I have time
to chat.

If you don't want people to leave messages, why do you have voice mail
or an answering machine?  Have you considered disabling that feature
or putting your preference in the message instead of the normal &quot;leave
a message after the beep&quot;?
