Hello,

does anyone know of a simple script to get the date and time on the
server an html document is served from ? (or a simple script to read an
html doc that only has one line in the body section ?)

thanks,

Ron

This Q should really only be answered with: Yes!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Still, let me give an answer:

With ASP-jscript you can do:

&lt;script language='jscript' runat='server'&gt;
response.write(new Date());
&lt;/script&gt;

What is an &quot;html doc&quot;?

Why one line? Is this a school assignment?

Hi Randy,

I did that,  but problem with that is that you don't know for how long a
page has been &quot;sitting&quot; there before a user does something.
(for all that I know  he/she could load a page..  and go out to lunch)

loadJSFile('getTimeOnTheServer.php')

And then have getTimeOnTheServer.php return the time, along with a
function call to do something with the time. Instead of having PHP just
return a one line file with the time, it would look something like this:

var serverTime = &lt;?php echo time() ?&gt;;
someFunctionInThePageToDoSomethingWithTheTimeVariable();

In my experience, ordinary servers cannot be trusted to get the date and
time right to within a reasonable accuracy.

Use instead a site which has a special interest in displaying date and
time.

A server should of course give the UTC date and time.  Server local date
and time do not necessarily match either that of the end user or that of
the owner of the site - particularly in the larger countries.

I was kidding, I know what ASP is. We're running *nix boxes though, and
we don't really need asp.

Oh, the ones I use can be trusted, they run all run ntp and are sync-ed
with a stratum 0 server.

uhm, ok..  but I was more interested in time differences anyway..

correct, but I am pretty sure that the servers I work with are pretty
accurate.
