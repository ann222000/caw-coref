I at least thought that you'd waddle away not slink away on yer belly.
Gay Ducks like you are constantly lowering my expectations for Gay Ducks.

I guess you finally got tired of your futile spin and came to the
realization that you only escape was slinking off.

But yet.. the abuse continues, Gay Duckie...

I shamed ya bad.. didn't I?

Phinne-scared-as$ Too Frightened to following through on empty threats
Paddleduck.... YOu lost again. Â Yer owned has been very entertained by
yer foaming and kookdancing. I still think you need a flame tutor. YOu
were so defenseless out there Gay Duckie. It was a one sided Massacre.
Gay Duck: 0 Owner: infinite.

There's no coming back from this gay duckie...
