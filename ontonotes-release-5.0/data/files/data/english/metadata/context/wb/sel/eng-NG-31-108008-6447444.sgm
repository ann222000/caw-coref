Following from a previous thread on PET versus glass, I observe that
the concensus seems on the whole to be thus:

Glass is better than PET for long term storage, because PET is felt to
be more permeable to oxygen than PET.

If that sums things up correctly, I would like to ask about the
following consideration:

Is it not the case that rubber is hundreds of times more permeable than
either, and thus the degree to which a long-term storage wine oxidizes
in the carboy is really not significantly altered by the vessel, since
most of the permeation of  O2 is going to occur through the rubber?

Your thoughts?

I don't recall seeing any study that would confirm your assertion.

If it is true, though... regard the surface area where the permeability
would occur.  3-4 square inches at a bung, or massively more over the
surface area of a carboy.

Fair point, but I suppose it depends on the ratio.  I have emailed better-bottle to see if they have any more specific
stats for internal carboy surface area and 02 exchange across the PET material.

I can't help thinking that if the PET walls truly do suffer only 'negligible' 02 permeability, by definition they are as
low risk as using a rubber bung (which probably has greater permeability but lower surface area).  Interesting thread
though :)

About as much permeability as a barrel?  Less I think.

Actually it's more complicated than that for a sealed barrel.  The
barrel is semi permeable and it is now thought that it actually pulls
ambient air into the wine in tiny amounts because a vacuum is created
on tightly bunged barrels.  They consider this micro oxygenation and
it's  good for reds.  As to  whether a better bottle would emulate
that, I guess it comes down to surface area and permeability.  To be
honest, I don't know if they think the air comes in from toppings or
through the staves; I have seen both stated.   Smaller containers have
more surface to mass ratios, if you wanted to emulate anything i would
guess the 30 to 55 gallon barrels would be the ones to go for.  Maybe
Google micro oxygenation and wine or barrels.

Yes, I thought the surface area to volume ratio would be a big influence on how much the stored wine is affected and
that is another point well raised!

However, if Better Bottles really do have negligible permeability to O2 then they are likely to cause less sealed
storage oxidation than a hypothetical barrel of of similar internal capacity or larger.  I draw this conclusion because
barrels don't have negligible permeability.  I wondered if the following extract is useful?

"Oak barriques soften wine by diffusing 20 to 30 mg. (15 to 23 ml.) of air-oxygen per litre of wine per year (mg/l/yr)
through their micro-porous staves. This natural osmotic permeation is driven by the higher partial pressure of oxygen
outside (0.2 atm) to inside the barrel (~zero), as wine "consumes" all the available oxygen that diffuses in. Permeation
provides MOST of the oxygen entry into a barrel. Repeated topping only adds about 5 mg/l/yr and splashing/racking about
4 mg/litre each time.
Successful wine maturation requires an "oxygen rationed" environment, rather than "all at once" oxygen exposure, which
instead promotes oxygen catalyzed acetaldehyde formation and aerobic bacterial spoilage i.e. by Acetobacter, always
present in small populations in wine (unless sterile filtered). Smaller barrels allow oxygen to diffuse in at a faster
rate per litre of wine in them than larger barrels, due to their higher surface area to contained volume. Metal tanks
allow no permeation, instead requiring micro-oxygenation.

4mm thickness of the special C-P polyethylene used in these vessels, diffuses oxygen from the air at about the same rate
as 20mm of new Oak. However it is a one way effect. The C-P material is absolutely taint-free and does not allow
evaporative loss of wine components so these vessels DO NOT NEED TOPPING."

This quote comes from a metal fermentation container manufacturer so you could expect a bias in that direction.  This is
page though has some useful information on oxidation at several stages in different containers though - I don't know if
it is contentious. http://www.flextank.com.au/Barrels.htm

Food for thought all of it, Jim

The conclusion from this and other posts seems to be that a Better
Bottle may or may not be permeable to oxygen, but even if it is, it
doesn't matter because, as it turns out, a little oxygen is good anyway.
Ergo, a Better Bottle may be the way to go :-)

before 2 years or so. That's not enough time to get any decent aging

&gt; Gene, I wonder if you have you stats on PET and diffusion to refute their claims that it is of negligible permeability?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know if this is of general interest, but here is the reply I had back from better bottle regarding
&gt;&gt;&gt;permeability and oxidation.  I must say it sounds fair...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;Substantial, and rapidly growing, numbers of home winemakers and brewers, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;well as suppliers of kits, clearly prefer Better-Bottle's unique PET carboys
&gt;&gt;&gt;and fittings to glass carboys. Nevertheless, anecdotal reports of oxygen
&gt;&gt;&gt;diffusing through the walls of Better-Bottle carboys and causing poor
&gt;&gt;&gt;results pop up from time to time and we are asked to comment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Making a good wine or beer is something of an art and occasionally results
&gt;&gt;&gt;do not meet expectations, regardless of whether the winemaker or brewer uses
&gt;&gt;&gt;a glass carboy or Better-Bottle carboy. It is impossible to draw any valid
&gt;&gt;&gt;conclusions from anecdotal reports of sporadic, subtle failures, because
&gt;&gt;&gt;identifying the cause rigorously is usually impractical. Absolutely, using
&gt;&gt;&gt;carboys made from any of the common plastics that scalp flavors and are
&gt;&gt;&gt;quite permeable to oxygen will guarantee an inferior result. However, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;would be a mistake to assume that using a glass carboy will necessarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;guarantee a superior result. Rubber stoppers, especially silicone stoppers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;most common types of flexible tubing, and liquid-filled air locks can leak
&gt;&gt;&gt;lots of oxygen. Moreover, oxygen diffuses so quickly through beer and wine
&gt;&gt;&gt;that removing a stopper from a carboy, even briefly, for testing and making
&gt;&gt;&gt;adjustments can allow a great deal of oxygen to enter. Racking from one open
&gt;&gt;&gt;carboy to another open carboy with a siphon, a pretty standard approach when
&gt;&gt;&gt;glass carboys are used, will essentially saturate the wine or beer with
&gt;&gt;&gt;oxygen. Yes, traces of oxygen can diffuse through the wall of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;Better-Bottle carboy, but experience indicates that the impact is negligible
&gt;&gt;&gt;and more than offset by a wide range of advantages.

&gt;&gt;I'm laughing so hard at the initial BetterBottle reply that my side hurts...  This is marketing hype at its best.

Can't find the table of diffusivities in a hurry, but here's a reference
from University of Guelph, Canada, Food Technology Center, in which PET
is mentioned not being the best oxygen barrier:

http://www.gftc.ca/articles/2003/packaging3.cfm

Here's an interesting article about modifications to PET to improve
oxygen barrier properties:

I just found a table with some polymers oxygen diffusivity.... PET
better than polycarbonate, but worse than HDPE and polypropylene.

http://www.diffusion-polymers.com/gas_diffusion.htm

One of the better oxygen diffusion barriers is Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA),
but it doesn't make for a very strong container, so typically would be
used as a layer on the inside of the bottle.
My polymers handbook is packed away, so this'll have to do for now.

&gt; Being a newbie I haven't yet reconciled why wineries don't usually seem to bulk age beyond a few months but home

&gt; Personally I believe the hype on their product for the way I am using it.  I am planning to send everything to bottle
&gt; within 3 months of fermentation ceasing.  I have yet to hear someone come forward and say they have had a positive
&gt; experience with long term aging in Better Bottles though, so I suppose that weighs in for the neigh-sayers so far.

&gt; Gene, I wonder if you have you stats on PET and diffusion to refute their claims that it is of negligible permeability?
&gt; I fully accept that statistics don't matter if you are finding that Better Bottles don't work for you!

For those that haven't actually touched a Better Bottle, the plastic
used is rigid, unlike a PET pop bottle.  They're more like the V8
plastic bottles that we get in Canada (and probably the US, but I'm
not certain).

I know that this doesn't answer the permeability question, but results
from storing wine in PET pop bottles may be different from Better
Bottles.

Not sure what commercial wines you're buying, but in local (BC Canada)
liquor stores many of the reds being sold are from 2002-2003-2004.
Yes whites are from 2005, may be even 2006 if from the southern

Thanks for the information Gene, it was useful if not hard reading to a non chemist but appreciated!  It does indeed
spell out that standard PET is far from O2-tight :)

I think Steve picked up on a useful point there though.  The Better-Bottle.com website does suggest, albeit a little
mystically, that BBs are made from a 'special PET' with negligible permeability.  In scanning the pdf articles I saw
that Anna Polyakova says it IS possible to produce a PET which is 'considered impermeable' via two stated methods.

I am not sure then whether discussing the properties of standard PET applies as Steve said.  On paper it is down to
whether Better Bottles 'special PET' is one of these improved types or standard PET.  I currently expect the latter.

Good eye, Jim.   Yes, it is possible to lower the oxygen permeability of
PET as Anna Polyakova (cute name for someone working with polymers,
BTW).  I'll dig for that patent application info, but I'm disappointed
that Better Bottle hasn't put the oxygen diffusivity numbers in their
technical specifications page for us to VERIFY their claim, not imposing
upon us to pay for the testing that they should use to validate the
claim in the first place.  We're not all 'Bayer Aspirin' trusting souls,
lol.

The stiffness of the PET has much to do with the degree of crystallinity
(i.e. cross-linking) of the polymer as part of the polymerization
process.  The more cross-linking, the stiffer.  The pop bottle PET is
more flexible primarily because it has less cross-linking.  In polymer
science terms that is a 'lower average molecular weight' polymer.  So
better bottle is higher average molecular weight.... that alone can be
the basis of a claim of 'special PET'.  I'm not saying the BB is bad.  I
still am a Doubting Thomas because there are not cold, hard oxygen
diffusivity numbers published by BB to back their claim.  I've been a
materials scientist qualifying materials into manufacturing processes
too long to take my supplier's claims at face value.  It is buyer beware
in the world of suppliers.

I read the oxygen solubility column rather than diffusivity column when

I apologize for any confusion which may have arisen due to the error
which I committed somewhere between my eyes and my fingers, most likely
in the cranial cavity, lol.

For oxygen diffusivity, PET is one of the better polymers between 1-2
orders of magnitude lower than polypropylene, HDPE, polycarbonate.  Not
quite as good as unplasticized, unfilled PVC.  Not nearly as good as PVA.

I finally found an article which has PET and PVA (in this case EVOH,
ethylvinyl alcohol, one of the PVA family of polymers).

http://www.chemsoc.org/chembytes/ezine/2002/birkett_jul02.htm

EVOH is almost two orders of magnitude lower oxygen diffusivity than
PET, with the caveat that the EVOH would have to be a buried layer, not
directly in contact with liquid.   EVOH in contact with liquid is no
better than PET for oxygen diffusion.

&gt; One of the better oxygen diffusion barriers is Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA),
&gt; but it doesn't make for a very strong container, so typically would be
&gt; used as a layer on the inside of the bottle.
&gt; My polymers handbook is packed away, so this'll have to do for now.

&gt;&gt; Gene, I wonder if you have you stats on PET and diffusion to refute
&gt;&gt; their claims that it is of negligible permeability? I fully accept

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; must say it sounds fair...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Substantial, and rapidly growing, numbers of home winemakers and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brewers, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well as suppliers of kits, clearly prefer Better-Bottle's unique PET
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carboys
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and fittings to glass carboys. Nevertheless, anecdotal reports of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oxygen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diffusing through the walls of Better-Bottle carboys and causing poor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results pop up from time to time and we are asked to comment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Making a good wine or beer is something of an art and occasionally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do not meet expectations, regardless of whether the winemaker or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brewer uses
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a glass carboy or Better-Bottle carboy. It is impossible to draw any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; valid
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusions from anecdotal reports of sporadic, subtle failures,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; identifying the cause rigorously is usually impractical. Absolutely,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carboys made from any of the common plastics that scalp flavors and are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quite permeable to oxygen will guarantee an inferior result.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be a mistake to assume that using a glass carboy will necessarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guarantee a superior result. Rubber stoppers, especially silicone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stoppers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most common types of flexible tubing, and liquid-filled air locks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can leak
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lots of oxygen. Moreover, oxygen diffuses so quickly through beer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and wine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that removing a stopper from a carboy, even briefly, for testing and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; making
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adjustments can allow a great deal of oxygen to enter. Racking from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one open
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carboy to another open carboy with a siphon, a pretty standard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; approach when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glass carboys are used, will essentially saturate the wine or beer with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oxygen. Yes, traces of oxygen can diffuse through the wall of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Better-Bottle carboy, but experience indicates that the impact is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; negligible
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and more than offset by a wide range of advantages.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm laughing so hard at the initial BetterBottle reply that my side
&gt;&gt;&gt; hurts...  This is marketing hype at its best.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Brief exposures of the wine to air as occurs during racking is
&gt;&gt;&gt; consumed by the wine and SO2 in a day or two.  That is unlike the
&gt;&gt;&gt; constant resupply by oxygen diffusion through a container.  From my
&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding, it's more like leaving excess headspace in the container.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh well, I'm a Doubting Thomas.  I know my cranberry juice oxidizes
&gt;&gt;&gt; within a year in its PET container.  Is it through the lid seal or
&gt;&gt;&gt; through the PET... I haven't run the experiment to find out.  But I
&gt;&gt;&gt; know PET is not a great oxygen diffusion barrier, so unless there
&gt;&gt;&gt; is/are additional layers of good oxygen diffusion barrier material in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the BetterBottle, I'd think twice about long term wine storage in a
&gt;&gt;&gt; BetterBottle.

bottle say their patent is pending. Hopefully someone with enough know
how amongst us will be able to read that patent app and make sense of

I wish they'd provide statistics too.  Hi Gene, and thanks for the info!
The last bit of information I got from Better Bottle regarding the material used for hte Better Bottles was this:
"
There are many formulations for PET as used in products. Pure PET is a much
better barrier than most other plastics; however, with the addition of
certain copolymers and the right stretching, it becomes much more
impermeable. We use a copolymer that has an extremely low permeability, and
we are working to make formulation that have such low permeability that they
can be used to produce 750 ml, re-usable wine and beer bottles to replace
glass. Crystallized PET is what we use for our fittings.
"
I did ask in the first instance for stats, but they obviously don't give those out.

Cheers again, Jim

I made a cranial processing error when writing the first sentence below.
I looked at the oxygen solubility column rather than the oxygen
diffusivity column.  OOPS.

PET is betwen one and two orders of magnitude lower oxygen diffusivity
than polycarbonate, HDPE and polypropylene.  But PET still at least 100X
(could be up to 1000x) worse than in glass containers.

In winemaking terms, white wines stored in sealed glass carboys might be
expected to last 2 to 3 times as long as in virgin PET containers, if
there are no other air leaks past the stopper.  For red wines, PET
carboys might be a good thing. PET has slower micro-oxidation rate than
HDPE, which is used by some aussie wineries for reds aging.  For white
wines, you don't want any micro-oxidation.

Please note that PET is on the order of 20 times higher oxygen
diffusivity compared to EVOH (ethylvinyl alcohol, a member of the
polyvinyl alcohol family).  However, there is a caveat for EVOH... it's
oxygen barrier properties are no better than PET when in direct contact
with water, so EVOH must be a buried layer in a polymer 'sandwich' to
get benefit of it's better oxygen barrier properties.

I'm having trouble finding the oxygen diffusivity for glass, to compare
against all polymers.  Dang, I wish my materials science reference books
weren't in storage.  If I recall correctly, glass is between 2 and 4
orders of magnitude better than polymers for oxygen diffusivity (100 to
10,000 times better) for the same thickness.  Now, as we all know, glass
carboys are thicker, so the glass carboy is hella lower total oxygen
diffusion rate than any plastic carboy.  The oxygen getting into wine in
a glass carboy, for all practical purposes, only comes through the
airlock stopper or leaks between the stopper and the glass.

&gt; One of the better oxygen diffusion barriers is Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA),
&gt; but it doesn't make for a very strong container, so typically would be
&gt; used as a layer on the inside of the bottle.
&gt; My polymers handbook is packed away, so this'll have to do for now.

&gt;&gt; Being a newbie I haven't yet reconciled why wineries don't usually

&gt;&gt; Personally I believe the hype on their product for the way I am using
&gt;&gt; it.  I am planning to send everything to bottle within 3 months of
&gt;&gt; fermentation ceasing.  I have yet to hear someone come forward and say
&gt;&gt; they have had a positive experience with long term aging in Better
&gt;&gt; Bottles though, so I suppose that weighs in for the neigh-sayers so far.

&gt;&gt; Gene, I wonder if you have you stats on PET and diffusion to refute
&gt;&gt; their claims that it is of negligible permeability? I fully accept
&gt;&gt; that statistics don't matter if you are finding that Better Bottles
&gt;&gt; don't work for you!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know if this is of general interest, but here is the reply I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had back from better bottle regarding permeability and oxidation.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; must say it sounds fair...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Substantial, and rapidly growing, numbers of home winemakers and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brewers, as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; well as suppliers of kits, clearly prefer Better-Bottle's unique PET
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carboys
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and fittings to glass carboys. Nevertheless, anecdotal reports of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oxygen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; diffusing through the walls of Better-Bottle carboys and causing poor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results pop up from time to time and we are asked to comment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Making a good wine or beer is something of an art and occasionally
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; results
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; do not meet expectations, regardless of whether the winemaker or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; brewer uses
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a glass carboy or Better-Bottle carboy. It is impossible to draw any
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; valid
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusions from anecdotal reports of sporadic, subtle failures,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; identifying the cause rigorously is usually impractical. Absolutely,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; using
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carboys made from any of the common plastics that scalp flavors and are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; quite permeable to oxygen will guarantee an inferior result.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be a mistake to assume that using a glass carboy will necessarily
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guarantee a superior result. Rubber stoppers, especially silicone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stoppers,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; most common types of flexible tubing, and liquid-filled air locks
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can leak
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lots of oxygen. Moreover, oxygen diffuses so quickly through beer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and wine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that removing a stopper from a carboy, even briefly, for testing and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; making
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; adjustments can allow a great deal of oxygen to enter. Racking from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one open
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; carboy to another open carboy with a siphon, a pretty standard
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; approach when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glass carboys are used, will essentially saturate the wine or beer with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oxygen. Yes, traces of oxygen can diffuse through the wall of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Better-Bottle carboy, but experience indicates that the impact is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; negligible
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and more than offset by a wide range of advantages.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn't this a pretty new product? I don't remember seeing ads for them
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before 2 years or so. That's not enough time to get any decent aging

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually it's more complicated than that for a sealed barrel.  The

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pulls
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ambient air into the wine in tiny amounts because a vacuum is

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; on tightly bunged barrels.  They consider this micro

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's  good for reds.  As to  whether a better bottle would emulate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that, I guess it comes down to surface area and permeability.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; To be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; honest, I don't know if they think the air comes in from
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; toppings or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through the staves; I have seen both stated.   Smaller
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; containers have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; more surface to mass ratios, if you wanted to emulate anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; i would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; guess the 30 to 55 gallon barrels would be the ones to go for.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Google micro oxygenation and wine or barrels.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Joe- Hide quoted text -- Show quoted text -

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm laughing so hard at the initial BetterBottle reply that my side
&gt;&gt;&gt; hurts...  This is marketing hype at its best.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Brief exposures of the wine to air as occurs during racking is
&gt;&gt;&gt; consumed by the wine and SO2 in a day or two.  That is unlike the
&gt;&gt;&gt; constant resupply by oxygen diffusion through a container.  From my
&gt;&gt;&gt; understanding, it's more like leaving excess headspace in the container.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh well, I'm a Doubting Thomas.  I know my cranberry juice oxidizes
&gt;&gt;&gt; within a year in its PET container.  Is it through the lid seal or
&gt;&gt;&gt; through the PET... I haven't run the experiment to find out.  But I
&gt;&gt;&gt; know PET is not a great oxygen diffusion barrier, so unless there
&gt;&gt;&gt; is/are additional layers of good oxygen diffusion barrier material in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the BetterBottle, I'd think twice about long term wine storage in a
&gt;&gt;&gt; BetterBottle.

Because they are in production business in which aging does
not add enough to the bottom line to justify it.  It's similar
to American 'Big Three' Brewers who can sell 'swill' as fast
as they can make it.  Why bother with improving product?

There is nothing wrong with Pet soda bottles for storing wine,

there any evidence that a Better Bottle has an oxygen barrier
that will hold up for one to three years?  I'd like to read it.

It's 3 bucks here now too and it's not that special.  It's ok wine and
you get a bottle to reuse.

As to the long term storage if we had a local supplier I would try one.
I looked them up and they aren't much more than glass.  I rarely go
over a year in glass, I'm not making artisan wine.

It made me smile when I saw her name Gene I must admit ;)

I must admit I will be / am happy to make wine as good as commercial wineries so it doesn't pain me if I can't use the
BB for reliable aging beyond a few months.  I'll no doubt realise my ignorance when I taste a glass bulk-aged wine in
later life.

I agree with the general sentiment.  "Stats out for the lads."  Otherwise we are all just speculating on the minutae on
the assumption that they are being honest/dishonest with their advertising claims.

It seems unlikely that they / their supplier have never measured the permeability of their product.  The spiral of
silence suggests that the figures don't look as good on paper as they'd like them too.  It's a reasonable assumption.
As to whether they feel it looks bad or will make people think it is bad (remembering how permeable barrels are) I
suppose that's another opinion with no substantiation.

Thanks for posting this thread though, it's useful stuff...

Here in North Carolina, $2 buck Chuck is $2.99 (Trader Joe's just opened
in Cary, a suburb of Raleigh). I agree, it's an OK wine. I have used it
to blend and that works well. I had a Shiraz that was kinda weak, so I
added 18% Two Buck Chuck's Cab Sauv. And now it's real nice. It took a
week after blending to clear up. But I am really liking this blend. And
I got some bottles added to my inventory. smile.

As far as Better Bottles - I have one, use it more often than my heavy
glass ones. I did have an oxidized wine from bulk aging, and I had it in
the BB for 5 months. Not sure it was the bottle or something I did,
though. So this is anecdotal and fyi. It drank OK early, but now I'm
stuck with 9 bottles of vinegar.
