Shaun Smith has one nasty attitude on the field! Maybe we need a guy
like that who can get under the opposing players skin. The first play I
saw him involved in, at he end of a tackle he was on top of the RB
pulling on his facemask. Then he was getting the O-linemen pissed off at
him. He does have to be careful of getting penalties playing like that.
But I like the surliness.

Travis Wilson isn't as big and flashy as a Braylon Edwards, but he looks
to be a good solid receiver who isn't afraid to take a hit to catch a
pass. For the most part he's held onto the ball well.

Nice to see Vickers get a carry or two. I like seeing teams use their FB
to carry the ball once in awhile.

Antwan Peek: Could turn out to be our best LB by the end of the year. I
wanted the Browns to draft him coming out of college, but at least we
have him now. He and Wimbley both do well in pass rush and pursuing the
ball carrier.

D'Qwell Jackon is getting stronger which is what I thought he needed to
do. He's still got the quickness and should do very well for the Browns
this year.

Can't leave out Leon Williams while talking LB's. He's a force but needs
to take those extensions out of his hair. That looks dreadful.
I could see him converting to DE someday as he continues putting on
muscle.

Eric Wright = the real deal, simply put. He's better as a rookie than
many CB's ever are. He just has to watch hooking the WR's arm the way he
did last night. In most games the officials will see that.

Lee Bodden played solid as usual.

Either I wasn't much attention to our safeties or they weren't doing
much. I don't remember hearing Jones' or Pool's names hardly at all. But
then again I had to listen to the Lions' announcers. :(

Wonder how long it'll take the O-line 'to gel'? They are playing
decently, but should get much better. Having Steinbach out doesn't help.
And how good will Shaffer be at RT? Hopefully better than he was the
play his man knocked the ball out of Anderson's hand (first play I
believe).

TE Kraus looks like a decent pass catching TE. He's not as gifted as
Winslow but is a big target for the QB to check down to.

Maybe these guys have played and I've just not noticed, but I haven't
seen WR Tim Carter and the rookie FB Ali. Are they our secret weapons
for the first regular season game??? Ahhhh, maybe that's it. Can't let
the Squealers get tape of how the Browns plan on using them. hah
Ali sounds like a load at 265lbs.

WTF happened near the end zone when Romeo told Anderson &quot;Our fault. Our
fault.&quot; The coaches must have changed the play at the last possible
second giving the players little time to react. The coaches and players
HAVE TO do much better in the red zone. Last night they looked horrible.

Overall though I think the team looked better than in the first
pre-season game. But there's alot of improvement needed yet.

Just some ramblings on a rainy Sunday morning.

I missed that.  I saw him chewing out the TE though for screwing up the play
formation.  It wasn't Winslow that I saw, but may have been a different
chewing out.   Romeo can chew a lot!

It alllllllllllll starts with Romeo, we saw the same crap last year and I'm

I wasn't real enthused about what I saw out of the first teamers. Outside of

it's only preseason but I'd sure feel better if I could see my team put
together at least ONE TD drive vs ultra scary defenses like the Lions and
the Chiefs.

Somebody said the Lions were good, wishing we had Jon 'fucking' Kitna!  Holy

lamenting the loss of Trent Dilfer, we are in a bad fucking way buddy.

It looks like the line may be good enough to protect Brady Quinn.  Give him
the reins, let him get some OJT.  That way he'll have some experience for
the new coach.

Beyond the normal pre-season rust, do you notice some glaring signs of a
poorly coached team?

It got below 70 degrees, so Phil Dawson missed a 37 yard field goal.  Are
they even letting anyone challenge him for a job?

WTAM's Mike Trivisonno said today the team looks disorganized for the
level of talent it has and for a head coach in his 3rd year.

I'm beginning to see it. What bothers me is that it seems to permeate
what the new OC is doing too.

That's very troubling! (No more Carthon to blame!)

They don't look all that sharp on special teams, either.

I thought drafting a kicker in the later rounds, or signing one who
wasn't drafted, was essential, even if Dawson eventually beat out the
challenger.

If the offense isn't an improvement over last year, this franchise is in
deep doo doo.

If Quinn, Thomas, and Wright can't play to NFL standards, this franchise
is in the cellar for at least another 3 seasons.

It'll be time for a new owner.

Yeah Paul. I mean, the ONLY thing, to me is does Quinn have the playbook and
all that mastered and all that good stuff? Because if so, there is no reason
to play Frye or Anderson. But we don't know that. By Crennels comments it
seems to me like Quinn is working with a limited playbook.

&gt;&gt; is totally hosed?   I thought our personnel genius Mr. Savage had all the
&gt;&gt; pieces in place?  or are we already writing this bitch off as &quot;rebuilding
&gt;&gt; year&quot; number 8 ?

&gt;&gt; If for no other reason, if the Browns marketing dept. want butts in the
&gt;&gt; seats and eyes on the TV, Quinn is the smart choice.  Oh yeah, that's
&gt;&gt; right, what do they care, the season is sold out once again by morons
&gt;&gt; like myself. Hehe.

&gt;&gt; -- Paul

&gt; Yeah Paul. I mean, the ONLY thing, to me is does Quinn have the playbook
&gt; and all that mastered and all that good stuff? Because if so, there is no
&gt; reason to play Frye or Anderson. But we don't know that. By Crennels
&gt; comments it seems to me like Quinn is working with a limited playbook.

Has Crennel even called him by his name yet?  I think Quinn is pretty
cerebral.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Antwan Peek: Could turn out to be our best LB by the end of the year. I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wanted the Browns to draft him coming out of college, but at least we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have him now. He and Wimbley both do well in pass rush and pursuing the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ball carrier.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I definitely liked what I saw out of him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Lee Bodden played solid as usual.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The injury scared me. I'm starting to wonder if he's related to Lee
&gt;&gt;&gt; Suggs.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; TE Kraus looks like a decent pass catching TE. He's not as gifted as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Winslow but is a big target for the QB to check down to.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I kinda like Dinkins too.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe these guys have played and I've just not noticed, but I haven't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seen WR Tim Carter and the rookie FB Ali. Are they our secret weapons
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for the first regular season game??? Ahhhh, maybe that's it. Can't let
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Squealers get tape of how the Browns plan on using them. hah
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ali sounds like a load at 265lbs.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't recall seeing them either. I *think* I read something recently
&gt;&gt;&gt; about Carter having a small lingering injury?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WTF happened near the end zone when Romeo told Anderson &quot;Our fault. Our
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fault.&quot; The coaches must have changed the play at the last possible
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; second giving the players little time to react. The coaches and players
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; HAVE TO do much better in the red zone. Last night they looked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; horrible.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It alllllllllllll starts with Romeo, we saw the same crap last year and
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm having a hard time believing if he doesn't have simple stuff like
&gt;&gt;&gt; this under control after some 30 years of coaching or whatever he has,
&gt;&gt;&gt; that in one off-season he was going to fix it. I have a feeling this
&gt;&gt;&gt; team has some decent talent but it's being held back by a mediocre
&gt;&gt;&gt; coaching staff.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Overall though I think the team looked better than in the first
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pre-season game. But there's alot of improvement needed yet.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I wasn't real enthused about what I saw out of the first teamers.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Outside of Bray, Jamal, Wimbley and Peek, I'm not impressed at all. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; know, I know, it's only preseason but I'd sure feel better if I could
&gt;&gt;&gt; see my team put together at least ONE TD drive vs ultra scary defenses
&gt;&gt;&gt; like the Lions and the Chiefs.

&gt;&gt; Somebody said the Lions were good, wishing we had Jon 'fucking' Kitna!
&gt;&gt; Holy geezus, are you kidding me?  When we have fans wishing we have
&gt;&gt; Kitna, and lamenting the loss of Trent Dilfer, we are in a bad fucking
&gt;&gt; way buddy.

&gt;&gt; It looks like the line may be good enough to protect Brady Quinn.  Give
&gt;&gt; him the reins, let him get some OJT.  That way he'll have some experience
&gt;&gt; for the new coach.

&gt; Come on, Kitna is not that bad. He can be pretty good.

Ask Bengal fans about Kitna.  Darren?
