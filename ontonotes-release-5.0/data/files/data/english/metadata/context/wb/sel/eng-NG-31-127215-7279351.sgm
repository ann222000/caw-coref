*The Methodology of the Saved Sect*

[1] The Firqatun-Naajiyah (the Saved-Sect) is that which adheres to the
Minhaj (the clear and manifest way) of Allah's Messenger during his
lifetime, and to the Minhaj of the Companions [7] after him. This Minhaj
being clearly defined in the Noble Qur'aan and explained in the authentic
Sunnah, as the Prophet said:

"I am leaving among you two things, which if you cling to, you will never go
astray: The Book of Allah and my Sunnah. The two will not separate from each
other, until you meet me at the Pool (Hawd)." [Related by al-Haakim from Abu
Hurairah,. Authenticated by al-Albaanee in Takhreejul-Mishkaat ( no.186)]

[2] The Saved-Sect returns to the Word of Allah and His Messenger whenever
there is disagreement or difference of opinion among themselves, and those
acting upon the saying of Allah - the Most High: "If you differ in anything
amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you do believe
in Allah and the Last Day. This is best and most suitable for final
determination." [Soorah an-Nisaa' (4): 59]

And Allah - the Most High - also says: "But no, by your Lord! They cannot
have any faith until they make you (the Messenger) a judge in all disputes
that they have between them, and find in themselves no resistance against
your decision, but accept them with full submission." [Soorah an-Nisaa' (4):
65]

[3] The Saved-Sect does not give precedence to the word of anyone over the
Word of Allah and His Messenger, acting upon the saying of Allah:

"O you who believe! Do not put yourselves forward before Allah and His
Messenger, and have Taqwaa of Allah. Indeed, Allah is all-Hearing,
all-Seeing" [Soorah al-Hujaraat (49): 1]

Ibn Abbas (May Allah be pleased with him) said: "I fear that stones will
descend upon you from the sky, that I say to you that the Messenger of Allah
said; and you say to me that 'Abu Bakr and Umer say something else'."
[Related by Imaam Ahmed ( no.3121), al-Khateeb in al-Faqeeh wal-Muttafaqqih
(1/145) and Ibn Abdul-Barr in Jaami' Bayaanul Ilm (2/196), from Sa'eed ibn
Jubayr]

[4] The Saved-Sect values Tawheed: and that is to single-out Allah alone in
worship, in supplication (Duaa), in seeking aid and assistance, in seeking
refuge in times of ease or hardship, in sacrificing and making vows, in
placing total reliance and trust in Him and in judging by what Allah has
revealed; and in all other forms of worship. This is the only basis upon
which true Islaamic society is based. It is therefore essential to remove
shirk (associating partners with Allah) and its manifestations, since this
is a requirement of Tawheed. And victory is not possible when Tawheed is
neglected, nor can shirk be fought with its like. And we are to follow in
this, the examples of the Prophets....
"Verily to every nation We have sent a Messenger (proclaiming) 'Worship
Allah (alone) and avoid the Taghoot (False gods)'." Soorah an-Nahl (16): 36

[5] The Saved-Sect revive the Sunnah of Allah's Messenger in their Ibaadah
(worship), Sulook (behavior) and in their lives, thus becoming strangers
amongst the people - as Allah's Messenger (May the Peace and Blessings of
Allah be upon him) said:

"Islam started as something strange and will return as something strange (as
it began), so Toobaa (a tree in Paradise) is for Strangers." [Related by
Imaam Muslim in his Saheeh (2/175-176) and Ibn Majah (2/320) from Abu
Hurairah]

In another narration: "..so Toobaa is for the Strangers. Those who correct
and put right what the people have corrupted."

Related by Abu Amr ad-Daanee in as-Sunanul -Waaridah fil-Fitan (1/25) and
al-Aajurree in al-Ghurabaa ( p.15-16), by Ibn Masood. Sheikh al-Albaanee
authenticated it in as-Saheeah (3/267)

[6] The Saved-Sect does not have bigoted adherence to the saying of anyone,
except the saying of Allah and the saying of his infallible Messenger, who
does not speak from his own desires. see Soorah an-Najm (53): 1-4

As for any other person - however elevated in rank - then he errs and makes
mistakes, according to the Messenger's saying: "All the children of Aadam
err and commit mistakes, but the best of those who make mistakes are those
who turn in repentance." [Reported by at-Tirmidhi ( no.2399), Ibn Majah (
no.4251) from Anas. Authenticated by al-Albaanee in Saheeh Sunan Ibn Majah (
no.3428)]

Imaam Maalik (May Allah have Mercy on him) said: "There is no one after the
Prophet except that you can take his saying or leave it." [Related by Ibn
Abdul-Haadee in Irshaaus-Saalik (227/1)]

Delighted with the beauty of this saying, Taqeeud-Deen as-Subkee said in
al-Fataawaa (1/148): "These words are originally those of Ibn Abbaas and
Mujaahid, from whom Maalik took and became famous for them." Imaam Ahmed
also took this saying from them, as Abu Dawood relates in his Masaa'il Imaan
Ahmed ( p.276): "I heard Ahmed say: There is no one, except that his opinion
is taken or abandoned, except the Prophet (May the Peace and Blessings of
Allah be upon him)

[7] The Saved-Sect are the Ahlul-Hadeeth (the People of Hadeeth), about whom
the Prophet Muhammed (May the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him)
said:

"There will not cease to be a group from my Ummah victorious and steadfast
upon the truth, those who abandon them will not harm them, until the command
of Allah comes about." [Related by Muslim in his Saheeh (6/52-53) and Abu
Dawood in his Sunan (2/202) from Thawbaan]

He also said: "This knowledge will be carried by the trustworthy ones of
every generation. They will expel by it the alterations made by those going
beyond bounds, the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations
of the ignorant." [Related by Ibn Asaakir and authenticated By al-Albaanee
in his checking of Mishkat ( no.248)]

He also said: "Allah will raise for this community at the end of every
hundred years one who will revive His religion." [Reported by Abu Dawood
(3/4278), al-Haakim, at-Tabaraanee in al-Ausat. Authenticated by al-Albaanee
in as-Saheeah (2/150)]

[8] The Saved-Sect love and honor the mujtahid Imaams (those scholars who
are able to extract rulings from the Book and the Sunnah). However they do
not blindly follow any of them. On the contrary, they take fiqh (rulings)
from the Qur'aan and the Sunnah, upon the understanding and the sayings of
all the scholars - if it is in agreement with the authentic Hadeeth. Indeed,
this is in agreement with their saying.....

Imaam Abu Haneefah (d.150H) - rahimahullah - said: "If a Hadeeth is found to
be authentic, then that is my madhab." Related by Ibn Aabideen in
al-Haashiyah (1/63)and also in Rasmul-Muftee (1/4)

Imaam Maalik ( d.179H) - rahimahullah - said: "Indeed I am only a man. I am
sometimes mistaken and at other times correct; so look into my opinion. All
that agrees with the Book and the Sunnah, accept it, and all that does not
agree with the Book and the Sunnah, then abandon it." Related by Ibn
Abdul-Barr in al-Jaami (2/32) and Ibn Hazm in Usoolul-Ahkaam (6/149)

Imaam ash-Shafiee - rahimahullah - (d.204H) said: "Everything that I say,
for which there is something authentically related from the Prophet contrary
to my saying, the Hadeeth of the Prophet comes first. So do not make Taqleed
(blind-following) of me." Related by Ibn Abee Haatim in al-Aadaab ( p.93)
and Ibn Asaakir in Tareekh Dimashq (15/9/2)

Imaam Ahmed - rahimahullah - (d,241H) said: "Do not make Taqleed
(blind-following) of me, nor make Taqleed of Maalik, nor of ash-Shafiee, nor
of al-Awzaa'ee, nor of ath-Thawree. But take from where they took." Related
by Ibn al-Qayyim in I'laamul-Muwqi'een (2/302)

[9] The Saved-Sect orders the good and forbids the evil. Thus it renounces
the innovative ways and destructive parties and groups which split the
Ummah, as Allah - the Most High - orders,

"Let there arise from you a group of people inviting to all that is good
(Islaam), enjoining all that is right and forbidding what is wrong. These
are the ones who will achieve success." [Soorah al-Imraan (3):104]

[10] The Saved-Sect reject those laws which are man-made when they
contradict the judgment of Islaam. Rather, it calls to the judgment by the
Revelation, that Allah revealed for the happiness and benefit of mankind, as
Allah advises His Messenger, "And so judge (you O Muhammed) between them by
what Allah has revealed and follow not their vain desires." [Soorah
al-Maidah (5): 49]

Only Allah knows what will reform the people. So His Law is firm and
constant, it will not alter for the rest of time, nor does the passage of
time alter its values. In reality the misfortune, lowliness and humiliation
the Muslim nation suffers is because the abandoned the Book of Allah and the
Sunnah of His Messenger. And nothing will make the Muslims strong again
except by them returning to the teachings of Islam - both individually and
collectively, acting upon the saying of Allah,

"Indeed, never will Allah change the condition of a people until they change
themselves." [Soorah ar-Rad (13):11]

[11] The Saved-Sect call the Muslims collectively to Jihaad in the path of
Allah - which is obligatory upon every Muslim in accordance with his ability
and strength. And Jihaad comprises the following:

(a) Jihaad with the tongue and the Pen: to call the Muslims as well as
non-Muslims to the adherence to the true and correct Islaam, starting with
the concept of Tawheed free from all forms of shirk; as the Prophet warned:
"The Hour will not be established until a group from my Ummah will follow
the mushriks, and large groups of my Ummah will worship idols."

Related by Abu Dawood (no.4252), Ibn Majah (no.4000) and al-Haakim
(4/448-449). Refer to Tahdheerus-Saajid (p.139) of Shaykh al-Albaanee

(b) Jihaad with wealth: and it is to give wealth for the propagation of
Islam by the establishment of Islamic Institutions, building libraries and
the printing of authentic Islamic books, so as to make guidance easily
available for those who wish to acquire it. It also consists of the
distribution of funds to the weak Muslims to incline their hearts and to
strengthen them. It also consists of providing the mujaahideen with food,
clothing and other requirements.

(c) Jihaad with Oneself: it consists of fighting and participating in battle
for the victory of Islam, such as the Word of Allah is made uppermost,
whilst the word of kufr (disbelief) is debased and made low.

It has been narrated by Abu Moosa (May Allah be pleased with him), that a
man came to the Prophet Muhammed (May the Peace and Blessings of Allah be
upon him) and asked, "A man fights for war booty, another fights for fame
and a third fights for showing off, which of them fights in Allah's cause?"
The Prophet replied, "He who fights that Allah's Word be superior, fights in
Allah's Cause." Reported in Saheeh al-Bukhari ( vol.4, no.65) and Saheeh
Muslim

And the noble Messenger pointed to these three forms of Jihaad in his
saying, "Make Jihaad against the mushriks with your wealth, your selves and
your tongues."

Related by Abu Dawood ( no.2504) from Anas. Authenticated by al-Albaanee in
Saheeh Abu Dawood (no.2186)

*F O O T N O T E S*

[7] Anyone who saw the Prophet Muhammed (May the Peace and Blessings of
Allah be upon him) while being a Muslim and died upon Islam is a
Sahaabee.{see Saheeh al-Bukhari, vol.5,p.1}
