I have many blogs and got quite a few blogs tagged as spam blogs. For
some, to post, I need to complete word verification (captcha). For
others, I could not publish. I vaguely remember I might even have lost
a blog but got it back eventually but not sure. Some took a few days,
some faster, some longer. In all cases, they were restored. One
blogger I refer to either of

http://blogger-tricks.blogspot.com/2007/06/problem-signing-in-seeing-...

even gave feedback she got access restored after 1 day on contacting
them. But Blogger support is a very volatile thing and have changed
many many times. Maybe by now, they have stabilized. Don't know if
that might help you, but so far just clicking on the ? icon and
getting a human to verify did the trick. I also got the message
recently

Not long after that, I could publish without captcha
