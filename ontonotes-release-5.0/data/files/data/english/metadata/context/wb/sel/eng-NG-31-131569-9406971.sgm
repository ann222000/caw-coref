The long road home

Khaled Hosseini's bestselling novel, The Kite Runner, was
set against the devastated landscape of his native
Afghanistan. In the run-up to the story's release as a
film, the author recounts the horrors and hopes of his
first visit to Kabul since 1976

&quot;I once saw the Taliban beat a woman so badly, her mother's
milk leaked out of her bones,&quot; an old shoemaker said to me
in Kabul as the two of us sat by his shop front and watched
traffic bolting by Haji Yaghoub mosque. In some ways, that
sentence summarises my feelings about my trip back to
Afghanistan after an absence of three decades: a marriage
of the horrific and the poetic.

The horror was ubiquitous. It started the moment Kabul came
into view from the window seat of the 727, a sprawling city
the colour of mud and dust, bereft of the trees or blue
waters I've always seen when flying over other cities. It
continued when the Ariana aircraft touched ground at Kabul
airport: strewn all around the runway were overturned
trucks and carcasses of old airplanes, burnt fuselages,
remains of wings gone to rust. Outside the terminal, amid
Kalashnikov-toting military personnel, I was mobbed by
beggars dressed in rags, all of them children. One of them
-- a frail boy of six or seven -- got bullied by the
others; his mud-caked hand lost its grip on the 5 afghani
bill I was handing through the car window, and he let out a
cry of such despair and sorrow it rang in my ears the rest
of that first, terrible day.

Kabul has changed a great deal since I last saw it in 1976.
The traffic is suffocating now, pedestrians, mule-drawn
carts and bicycle riders weaving perilously through the
clogged lanes of honking cars and taxi cabs, 3 million
people roaming a 30 sq mile city designed for less than
half that number. The air smells of diesel fumes and smoke
from the trees people burn for firewood, and sometimes the
wind-stirred dust is so thick you can't see the end of the
block. The dust gets in your teeth, your eyes, your ears;
everyone stops in their tracks and waits for the wind to
die down. I was driven through Kabul on my second day
there, a grand tour of what nearly a quarter-century of
wars does to a city, to a people. As I gazed out the car
window at the endless destruction blurring by, I realised
that there is not a single block in Kabul that hasn't in
some way been scarred by war. The so-called &quot;posh&quot; parts of
town have dirty, unkempt homes with shattered windows, set
along roads riddled with potholes big enough for a small
child to lie in. The areas that bore the brunt of the
mujahideen infighting -- Karteh Seh, Karteh Char, Deh
Mazang -- have simply been flattened. They are little more
than block after block of demolished homes, schools reduced
to rubble, movie theatres, pharmacies and shops pulverised
to piles of dirt and bricks. The crumbling Darul Aman, the
old royal chateau built in the early 20th century by King
Amanullah Khan, is pocked with holes from rocket attacks,
standing at the end of dusty Darul Aman road like an
abandoned, haunted mansion. I recall my father taking my
brother and me there for picnics outside the chateau, but
the flowers, trees and grass are long gone, too. Across the
street, Kabul Museum is little more than a storage house
for ancient artefacts that have been shattered by club-
wielding Taliban.

The poverty and disarray in many areas is unspeakable. I
saw an old woman wearing cracked bifocals picking slimy
lettuce leaves from a fly-blown heap of trash. I saw a dead
horse on the side of a crowded street and learned that it
had been electrocuted when it had sipped from a rain puddle
and a loose power line had touched the water. Passers-by
hardly seemed to notice. One-legged war victims -- some of
them children -- and maimed former mujahids walk the
streets on canes, or just stand around leaning against
walls and watching traffic, as if waiting for something. At
the tomb of Ahmad Zahir, a famous Afghan singer, I stared
at the bullet holes in the stone, put there by hateful
Taliban who had fired with machine guns on the tomb of a
man killed more than 20 years ago. &quot;In Kabul, dying once is
not enough,&quot; a young panjshiri man said to me at the grave
site. As I walked away from the grave, I was mobbed again
by burqa-clad women and barefoot children, their hair
matted with dirt, faces oozing with sores, their teeth
rotting already, begging for baksheesh. They took what I
handed out and said, &quot;May God give you plenty, Kaka! May
God never make you unhappy!&quot; The locals tell you the widows
are to be pitied, but not to give money to the children,
that it promotes a culture of begging. Maybe that's true,
but some of these children, I learned from speaking to
people, get beaten by their parents if they don't come home
in the evening with a certain amount of money. On some of
them, I saw the tell-tale bruises and burns. Desperation is
an ugly thing. So is hunger. I don't know if handing out
money to them was the right or wrong thing to do. I know
only that turning from them required a strength that I
simply did not find in me.

In the mountains that crown the city, children walk down
winding dirt roads from up to 2,000ft to the city below to
stand in line at the well and fill pails or antifreeze
containers with water. They load them on their backs and
carry them up to their homes -- a process that takes hours
every day. Then their mothers hand them dough, and the
children walk down the mountains again to stand in line at
the community oven to bake it. They wrap their bread in
cloth and climb back up the mountains. There is a haggard,
vacant look in the eyes of these children as you drive by
them, as they disappear in the dust in your rear-view
mirror. One man, a former police officer now working as a
bodyguard, told me his son had failed mathematics and had
to repeat third grade. &quot;He is intelligent and he wants to
be an architect and make buildings for Kabul,&quot; he said,
smiling sadly, &quot;but how can he study when he has to walk up
and down the mountain all day?&quot;

One policeman, who wanted to arrest me for videotaping him
at a crowded intersection and ended up inviting me to his
house for dinner (an offer which I politely declined), told
me he made $40 a month to feed a family of 12: his wife,
his four children, his dead brother's two wives and five
children. He told me he hadn't been paid in three months
and that he had borrowed money from every friend and
relative he knew. He eyed the passing sleek black NGO Land
Cruisers with disdain, a sentiment I found very common in
Kabul, and complained that the government had given
millions in aid money to the NGOs, which then spent it on
fancy cars, fancy offices and fancy guesthouses. &quot;What good
are these NGOs? What have they done for us?&quot; he said. &quot;I
have yet to see them put two bricks together.&quot; He told me
the government had to find ways to put the aid money where
it was most needed, in the pockets of average people. &quot;We
are thankful that the Taliban are gone and that we are safe
walking the streets,&quot; he said, &quot;but people are hungry now
and they are getting desperate.&quot; He told me of a man he
knew who had bought a loaf of bread, crumbled it to pieces,
laced it with rat poison, and fed it to his eight children
and himself. He told me of another man who, unable to feed
his children any longer, had doused himself with gasoline
and set himself on fire in the middle of the street. The
policeman saw the shock on my face and nodded glumly. &quot;It's
true, my friend. It's all true. Tell this to the people in
America.&quot;

I spoke to people on the street about life during the
mujahideen infighting and Taliban rule. Mohammad Agha, a
thin man with a haunted, weather-beaten face older than his
stated 33 years of age, told me every home in his
neighbourhood had been hit by rockets between 1992 and
1996. &quot;My neighbour's home was hit one day, and I went into
their basement. I saw a leg here, a breast there, meat
everywhere.&quot; They had had to identify the victims by their
clothing. His own house had been hit one day while he had
been at work, and he had run home, expecting to have to dig
his family's body parts out of the rubble. Instead he found
his father sitting under their mulberry tree, clutching
Mohammad Agha's children in his arms, all of them
miraculously unharmed. &quot;God is so great, words fail me,&quot;
Mohammad Agha said to me. He told me that, one day, shortly
after the mujahideen took over Kabul, he was walking by a
house when he heard screaming. He knew the officer at the
door from school and was able to get through. He found
three young women in one room, their clothes torn off their
bodies, and a mujahid soldier struggling with another woman
in the living room. &quot;He wore a ring on each finger, but
there was one last ring he hadn't been able to pull off the
woman's finger. So he had forced it into his mouth and he
was yanking the ring off with his teeth, blood dripping
from his mouth, tearing the meat off the woman's finger.&quot;
He shook his head and told me that was one of the worst
things he had ever seen in his life. &quot;And I've seen people
nailed in the head, cut in half with saws, their eyes
gouged out with bare hands,&quot; he added. He told me how the
mujahid forces in the mountains used people for target
shooting: that they would bet 1,000 afghanis for a
pedestrian, 2,000 for a bicycle rider, 3,000 for a car.
1,000 afghanis is $20. &quot;You know the worst part?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Some of those people are now working for the government,
driving fancy cars.&quot; I spoke to my driver, Awdi Khan, a
plump, kind-faced man in his late 40s. I told him that some
people in America whisper that the reports of the
atrocities committed by the Taliban are exaggerated. He
scoffed at this. &quot;Then they should have been here with us,&quot;
he said. &quot;There were executions every Friday or every other
Friday; certainly hand-cutting every week. They would
announce it on TV on Wednesdays: 'So-and-so, son of so-and-
so, from so-and-so area, will be put to death for this or
that crime.' The hands ... &quot; he paused, &quot; ... they would
tie to a ring and parade them in front of the people at
Ghazi Stadium.&quot; He told me how he sometimes had to pray
midday namaz three or four times. &quot;You would be walking
down the street and some Talib would tell you to go to the
mosque to pray. You would swear to him that you had just
prayed, but he would hit you with a whip and call you a
liar. You'd pray once more, then cross the street, and get
stopped again.&quot;

But here is the most amazing thing of all: amid the
despair, sickness and destitution, I saw beauty and
kindness that brought me to my knees. And I saw what I had
come to Afghanistan to see: signs of rebirth and hope,
signs of a people allowing themselves to dream again. I saw
men planting grapevines and trees on the hill that leads to
Bagh-e-bala, King Abdur Rahman Khan's old palace, which
overlooks the city. I chatted with a young shepherd playing
the flute on that hill, the bells on his sheep jingling as
they fed on grass. He thought his life was much better
since the Taliban had been largely ousted -- he could play
his flute again. Children flew kites from rooftops and
young men in pirhan-tumban played volleyball at the Shar-
e-nau Park. People smiled and little schoolgirls sang songs
as they skipped to school, holding hands. I saw people
painting old homes, building new ones, digging gutters,
going to the movies and playing Bollywood soundtrack songs
and rubab music at street corners. Kebab-makers fanned
skewered lamb on charcoal flames and, more than once,
offered me free meals. Awdi Khan took me to a section of
Kabul river that people had turned into a bazaar. &quot;Afghan
people make do with what they have been given,&quot; he said.
The droughts had dried the river, so people had set up
shops in its empty bed, selling carpets, clothes and cheap
jewellery. &quot;They call it Titanic City,&quot; he said. It rained
for the first time in years while I was there, and within
days the river was flowing once more. &quot;No more Titanic
City,&quot; Awdi Khan said, smiling, &quot;but people are happy. We
need water for the trees and the wells. We need Kabul to be
green again.&quot; Kabulis love flowers once more. They buy them
from stores and place them on the windowsills of their
broken homes, sometimes planting them in the empty shells
of old mujahid rockets -- Rocket Flowers, they call them.
They deck out their cars with pink flowers and white
ribbons on wedding days, driving and honking through
Chicken Street past muddy ISAF jeeps. Despite the squalor
around them, Afghan dignity has managed to survive. I tried
to hand a young boy money once at Koteh Sangi. He shook his
head and said, &quot;I am not a beggar, Kaka.&quot; Then he invited
me over to tea at his house. The &quot;house&quot; turned out to be
three and a half crumbling, roofless walls with a wrecking-
ball-sized gaping hole in the middle of one.

I have returned to my own life now in America, a life whose
even minor conveniences suddenly strike me as decadent. I
have had a few days to reflect on my return to Afghanistan,
as I drive around town, as I stand in line at the grocery
store, as I lie in bed at night, my two children sleeping
safely down the hallway. The enormity of what has happened
in my homeland is overwhelming, but what comes back to me
is not the poverty, the destruction, the aftermath of years
of violence. Nor is it the nostalgic satisfaction of seeing
once again my father's house in Wazi Akbar Khan where I
grew up, or Istiqlal, my old school, or Cinema Park where
my brother and I saw so many old westerns; all of these
settings I used for my novel The Kite Runner. No. What I
think of mostly is the people I met, their faces, their
names, their smiles. I think of the stories they so
generously shared with me, and how they have managed to
survive in the face of what has happened in that land, how
they have salvaged their dignity, their dreams and hopes.
How they have stayed kind. I think of the strength of the
Afghan people. I think of their humility. Their astonishing
grace.
