Federal officials have refused to divulge the location of tax protester Ed
Brown who was arrested on Friday, prompting many of his supporters to fear
that Brown has been disappeared into a black hole and is being mistreated or
even tortured.

Brown and his wife Elaine were arrested on Friday after U.S. Marshals posing
as supporters gained access to their Plainfield home and apprehended the
couple.

&quot;Elaine Brown is serving her 63-month sentence in the Federal Correctional
Institute in Danbury, Conn., a minimum prison facility for women, according
to Steve Monier (pictured above), U.S. Marshal for New Hampshire,&quot; reports
the Union Leader.

Alex how does this change the position of women in Afghanistan and
Pakistan is all too clear from the images and reports we see more and
more frequently: veiled (or cocooned in a burka), victim of an honor
killing, an acid attack or a gang rape. They are subject to Islamic laws
that devalue them.

BAGHDAD (AP) - Guards in a security convoy opened fire on a car at an
intersection in central Baghdad on Tuesday, killing two Christian women,
police said. Separately, suicide car bombings targeting a local police chief
and a Sunni sheik working with U.S. forces killed at least 19 people.

Police and witnesses could not immediately give more details about the
gunmen in Baghdad except to say they were in a convoy of four SUVs commonly
used by private security companies and the Iraqi Ministry of Interior.

The women were in a white car that drove into the Masbah intersection in the
central Karradah district as the convoy of three white and one gray SUVs was
stopped about 100 yards away, according to a policeman who witnessed the
shooting from a nearby checkpoint.

The men in the SUVs threw a smoke bomb in an apparent bid to warn the car
against coming forward, said Riyadh Majid, the policeman. The woman driving
the car tried to stop, but was killed along with the passenger when two of
the guards in the convoy opened fire, Majid said.
