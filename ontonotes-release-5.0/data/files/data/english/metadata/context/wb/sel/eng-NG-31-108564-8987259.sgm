I've been scarce in these parts, but I come in peace, and with an

A paper on the 1872 earthquake is in the works -- interesting event!

Glad to see you back posting, and am especially pleased that you will be
writing about the Owen's Valley quake. It was indeed a very interesting
event.

Was it Owen's Valley or perhaps Ft. Tejon where a couple of eyewitnesses
reported actually seeing the rupture forming, and a scarp rising directly in
front of them?

Hello Susan,

When I lived in Los Angeles, I was told the Owens Valley EQ was a M8 or
higher.

I suspect you are going to revise this down.  From everything I heard in
LA, it was a Big One.

It may have helped Mulholland and the LA DWP to get water from the Owens
Eiver Valley.

I have a copy of the original &quot;Earthquake Country&quot; by Robert
Iacopi from Sunset publications. it has a photo of what I presume
to be the famous scarp, albeit a different view from Susan's
photo. The book rates the quake as 8.3 but it appears the book,
published in 1964 and condensed a bit by Sunset in 1969, was
using the Richter scale. I expect Susan can tell us what it is
now considered to have been on some currently used scale.

If you can get your hands on a copy at a used book store buy it,
even if it doesn't recognize plate tectonics (I see there's one
on eBay for $1.99 at this moment).

The book follows the length of the San Andreas fault with aerial
photos and ground level photos. The aerials are overprinted with
a pink band showing the actual location of the fault. Legend has
it that the book was not republished by Sunset because real
estate people objected to those photos, as well they might. Do
not buy the later revision of the book, which does not include
the pink bands.

The book also has directions for driving to the SAF at various
points along the way (although those of us who lived in Daly City
and Pacifica were well aware of the fault's location).

Hey...I've got that book. Mine's a Jan 1965 third printing, with
the pink highlighting.

Sue, you should have mentioned your Denver book-signing yesterday.
I'm sure people are interested in that.
I found out too late to put it on the computer.

Hi Rick (et al.)  As you've probably gathered, my reappearance did not
signify a return to regular participation.   If I have or know of any
info/resources that are freely available and might be of interest, I
do try to let folks here know.  And the Denver gig didn't qualify: it
was an evening event at the GSA meeting, only open to people who had
registered.  GSA is, I learned, very strict about this.

Felix, to answer your question, my recent work did scale down the
intensity map that had been inferred in earlier work, but I conclude
the earthquake was still bigger than 1906.  This is based mostly on
the distribution of effects, but recent geological investigations also
suggest a longer rupture than mapped in the seminal study by Beanland
and Clark.

I updated the Web page ( http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/hough/
Owens/) to include a summary  the results of my work.  I've also added
a bit more by way of local color -- two especially colorful historical
accounts (scroll down to bottom of page.)

The photo of the sea otter has definite &quot;aaaah&quot; value. I still
think sea otters inspired the look of the ewoks.
