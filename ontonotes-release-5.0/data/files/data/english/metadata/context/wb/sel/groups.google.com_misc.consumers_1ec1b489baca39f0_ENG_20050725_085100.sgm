I'm looking for some advice on how to get rid of this credit card
(from Chase, aptly named).

I cancelled this credit card by phone months ago, with zero balance,
and no recent charges. Everything seemed fine for several months
until one day I get a statement for this card (which I thought was
defunct) showing a balance of about $100. It turns out that (1)
my account had not been closed (it had just been dormant due to
the zero balance), and (2) some shady outfit (Privacy Guard, which
may be connected to, or in cahoots with, Chase), without my
permission, had charged my account for some service I had never
asked for. After hours on phone with both Chase and Privacy Guard
I was told that my account would show a credit for the charges (to
bring it to zero balance), and I it would be closed.

Well, no such luck. Today once again I received a new statement
from Chase showing even more charges (the previous charges plus
late fees). I could, once more, waste a few hours on the phone
clearing this matter, but, after this history, I have no confidence
that it will be resolved this time any more than it did last time.

What are my options other than paying these bogus charges? Is
there some watchdog group I could report Chase to? Will it make
any difference? It has crossed my mind to hire a lawyer, but I
figure that it will cost me more than the bill from Chase. Is
there anything I can tell the Chase customer service flunky on the
other end of the line to convince him/her to stop harassing me?

Thanks!

You should not have complained by phone, you should have complained in
writing. Didn't you notice where it's written on your statement that
complaining by phone doesn't preserve your rights? By now it's
probably too long since the charge you're disputing first showed up on
your statement for Chase to be legally required to allow you to dispute
it -- they are only required to accept a dispute if you make it in
writing within 60 days of when you receive the statement with the
charge on it.

Nevertheless, you should immediately locate on your statement the
address to which you're supposed to send complaints, and send a
*written* complaint to Chase, disputing the charge and telling them the
same story you just posted, with all the details you can provide (i.e.,
the date on which you canceled the card by phone, the dates on which
you spoke to people about the unauthorized Privacy Guard charges, the
people to whom you spoke, etc.). It is likely that Chase will remove
the charge, interest and fees from your balance in response to this
letter.

If they don't, come back here and let us know and I'm sure people will
have suggestions for what to try next.

"/> Send a certified letter, return receipt requested, to the disputes

There is likely to be a notice about the dispute process, which says
something like, &quot;If there is an error on a bill, you must send us a
notice of the dispute within 60 days. You may telephone us, but doing
so will not preserve your rights under law.&quot;

And since the bill may have been reported late, check your credit
reports. An amount in dispute should not be reported as delinquent
while it is being investigated, but that does not mean that the
automated process won't report it as delinquent.

&quot;Send a certified letter, return receipt requested, to the disputes
address (not the payment address; the dispute address should be on your

bill). &quot;

There is no need to panic and DO NOT pay those bogus charges.

Simply regroup by writing as instructed above and open your letter with
the the fact that you did call their customer service deparment on &quot;x&quot;
date and spoke to &quot;x&quot; (hopefully, you wrote down at least the date you
called.. the name of the rep is a bonus). Then explain what you were
told your account would be credited in full but that hasn't happened,
so you have been forced to write.

Explain when you wrote and asked that your account be closed, be firm
in the fact that you never authorized Privacy Guard to make any
charges to your account and repeat that you were told by both Chase and
Privacy Guard that these charges would be credited.

Close by explaining that you want the promised credit applied
immediately, including a credit for finance and late fees on those
charges. In the end, your account should have a zero balance as it did
before the unauthorized charges and ask for a letter to confirm.

I had a similar problem with Chase. They can't seem to understand that
when someone says CLOSE THIS ACCOUNT, they want it CLOSED, not sitting
there dormant!

The letter with note that you did call should clear the situation up.
Keep a copy of everything and your next statement should show all the
credits assuming it's not in the mail before your letter reaches them.

In the future, it's probably best to write first however. That way you
have a record that they were notified in writing and that it was
received.

"/> 1) In all the years I've been using credit cards and reading about
other people's good and bad experiences with credit cards, I've never
had this happen to me or heard a single other person say that it had
happened to them. I mean, please, if this were actually a strategy
that the credit card companies thought would help them, don't you
think they would have done it by now?

2) If the courts don't let the IRS claim they received an empty
envelope (once you produce your mailing receipt, the burden of proof
is on the IRS to prove that they didn't receive your filing), do you
really think they're going to let a credit-card company get away with
it?

3) In &quot;your word against theirs&quot; cases such as what the scenario
you're describing would be, the tendency of courts, arbitrators, etc.
is usually to say &quot;no harm no foul&quot; and require that the credit
company allow the consumer to submit the dispute at the time when the
company claims that they received an empty envelope. So in the end
this wouldn't gain the card companies anything.

4) Postponing crediting payments actually makes money for the card
companies. Doing what you describe would cost them money in the end,
because of the resources they'd spend fighting with consumers after
claiming that their disputes weren't received. It doesn't make
business sense for them to do it.

Incidentally, if you think that Privacy Guard charged your credit card
without authorization, you might want to visit
http://www.girardgibbs.com/trilegiant.html .

Also, did you by any chance respond to a promotion offering you a free
copy of your credit report shortly before the charge from Privacy Guard
appeared on your credit card? If so, then that's where the charge came
from -- when you asked for the free credit report, you signed up for a
&quot;free trial membership&quot; to Privacy Guard and agreed to be billed for
membership if you didn't cancel it within the trial period.
