THE 15th WORLD CONGRESS OF THE WORLD FEDERATION OF THE DEAF (WFD)

Every four years Deaf people gather to participate in the World Congresses
organised by the WFD. There, they approve the resolutions and
recommendations that make up the four-year action guidelines for the Board
and General Secretariat. The host country of this great event is responsible
for the organisation and technical management of the Congress, in close
cooperation with the General Secretariat.

Among Congress participants there are official delegates of each member
country, professionals, political authorities, representatives of groups
that support the Deaf community, participants of the cultural programme and
thousands of Deaf people from all over the world.

In two years' time, Madrid will have the privilege of being the world
capital of the Deaf community. Throughout its streets we will be able to see
Sign Languages from the whole world, Deaf people from different countries
and different races, ideologies or beliefs, but everybody united in a claim:
the respect for difference. These people advocate the right to have their
own language, culture and a history. The 15th World Congress wants to show
the whole world the cultural values of the international Deaf community as
well as its struggle for creating a fairer and more equalitarian world.

This Congress wants to show everybody the reality of a Deaf community that
does not conform and that strongly believes in achieving a more modern,
freer and solidarity society.

Aim

The aim of this world event is twofold: on the one hand, to identify Deaf
people needs and, on the other, to draft a programme to be implemented by
the WFD Board and General Secretary for the next four years. The official
delegates of each member country have a leading role in this congress for
political, cultural and social exchange. They, together with political
authorities and representatives of those entities that support the Deaf
community, are the people who shape and give birth to the most important
congregation of the Deaf community.

The importance of the Congress

In 2007 Madrid will be the world capital of Deaf people. This city will host
the cultural richness of different sign languages worldwide; it will be a
meeting point for the Deaf youth, for people arriving from all over the
world and an international venue for Deaf culture -featuring exhibitions,
debates, theatre, poetry and films in sign languages. However, an underlying
issue will pervade everything, i. e. the right to difference, to diversity
and to an identity shared by millions of people of different races, ideas,
languages and beliefs.

How is it organised?

The organisation of the 15 th World Congress of the WFD is structured around
an Organising Committee and an Executive Committee representing the whole
associative network in this country.

Which topics are going to be discussed?

The conferences, presentations and workshops of the 15 th World Congress of
the WFD will focus on the following classification of Congress Commissions:

• Human Rights: Linguistic and Cultural Rights
• Sign Languages
• Education
• Technology and Accessibility
• Mental Health
• Medicine –Biotechnology and Bioethics
• Developing Countries
• Women

Special attention will be devoted to the different collective groups that
conform the Deaf Community. They have been classified according to the
Special interest groups of the 15 th World Congress of the WFD.

• Deaf Youth
• Deaf Immigrants
• Deaf Senior Citizens
• Deafblind
• Deaf people with Other Disabilities
• Indigenous People and Ethnic Minorities
• LGTB
• CODA
• Sign Language Interpreting
• Deaf Business

Why Madrid?

The reason why Madrid has been chosen as the host city of the 15 th World
Congress of the WFD is because of the quality of its infrastructures, its
great number of hotels, its having the largest convention centre in Spain
–IFEMA– and the strategic location of the city. From Madrid, one can have
direct access to other Spanish places of tourist interest.

What is the role of the Deaf associative movement in the Congress?

The Deaf associative movement is gaining vital importance in the development
and implementation of this Congress. For the CNSE, involving its entire
associative network Congress development is a priority. The success of this
event will mean the success of all Deaf people in Spain.

What does the World Congress provide?

Participating in the 15 th World Congress of the WFD will be a unique
opportunity for all attendees. Every Congress participant will share his/her
personal experiences with other deaf people and he/she will be able to widen
his/her view and knowledge about the international community.
In plenary sessions participants will become acquainted to those questions
that most worry our collective group and will have the opportunity to meet
the most important leaders of the world associative movement.
