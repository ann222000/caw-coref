I'm struggling with a bit of a problem, and I'm hoping there's a simple
answer I just haven't been able to find.

When you travel from pointA to pointB, there is an assumption that
you're doing so directly (when a polyline is mapped). For example - say
I'm trying to map out a flight - from HonKong to Vancouver - the line
would show up as though I flew over China, Europe and North America.
However, what I need it to do is to show the actual path flying
eastwards across the pacific.

Is there any way to do this, other than calculating the boundaries of
the map, the polyline intersection, then breaking it up into several
line segments?

Thanks,

~ Joseph

The problem arises when crossing the dateline. To fix it you can set
Vancouver to Longitude 240°. Alternatively set Hong Kong as -250°.
This should force your line to cross the dateline.

Joseph,

A polyline can contain quite a few points, several hundred in fact.
Just include in your list of points any turns or waypoints you may have
and the line will be drawn accordingly.

I suggest you take a peek at the mapki for some indications as to what
can be done:

also, Mike Williams Tutorials:

There is a possibility of a dateline problem as jjrdk indicated too.
The Mapki has some workarounds for that too.
