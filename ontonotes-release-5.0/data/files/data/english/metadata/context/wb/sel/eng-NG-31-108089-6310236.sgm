The "NNTP-Posting-Host: 209.177.232.245" data in the headers
of numerous messages he has transmitted show that they
originated at his place of employment, Moffitt Corporation in
Jacksonville Beach,Florida. What a shit-hole that must be to
allow an abject loser like him to post all manner of malicious
and racist content all day long.

209.177.232.245 = Moffitt Corporation

Moffitt Corporation
1351 13th Avenue South, Suite 130
Jacksonville Beach, FL 32250

The messages with headers transmitted via "NNTP-Posting-Host:
24.129.77.189" are those he typically spews away from Moffitt
Corporation, usually from the house owned by his facilitating
girlfriend Deborah Lynch rather than that of his current wife
Claudia, aka "Joey.

A recent development is that "PirateJohn" Gilmer posted messages
that originate from the 216.253.112.18 domain which is
registered to Venus Medical Communications, 1351 13TH AVE S,
JAXVILLE BCH, FL, 32250 which, not too surprisingly, is a very
close neighbor of Moffitt Corporation whose address is 1351 13th
Avenue South, Suite 130, Jacksonville Beach, FL 32250!

You keep chirping around here like you're the designated canary. I
think you've been eating too many of your turds rather than the bird
seed that falls on the bottom of the cage.

Why don't you stick your finger up your ass and rotate like your
favorite playground ride.

Until I want to hear any mumblings from you, just shut the fuck up
prissy alan, albert, or, from what I've seen of you: a-loser.

To i ... @RidingIntoHistory.org,

Is this the type of biker that Riding Into History endorses to promote
their events?

If the rest of your members and participants are as malicious as the
internet TROLL and sociopathic puke defined by the factual data below,
you all are useless pieces of shit that don't deserve to roam free in
society.

It is pretty twisted for you scumbags to promote, and take credit for
assisting, a breast cancer charity (and perhaps others) when the
president of a sponsoring motorcycle club is the asshole cited
numerous times below. He has hidden behind dozens and dozens of
internet identities (over 50 at last count!) to obfuscate his ongoing
abuse throughout the internet.

Fuck all you assholes for associating with the Gilturd piece of shit
responsible for years of ongoing internet and real life abuse.

&gt; Happy new year, loser (you need all the good wishes you can get --
unfortunately, they won't be enuf ROFL!!)
&gt;

I don't know who you are, and, I don't care considering I share the
same sentiments as you regarding the gilturd puke.

Although, it bothers me that I'm getting blamed for your poking a
stick at the communicable-disease carrying gilturd. But, he was bound
to go off his medications at any moment anyway. But, I am not
responsible for your ruffling the feathers of the pissed-on parrot and
whomever you are knows that as well as me.

And, just as before, as long as gilturd is going to wrongly accuse me
of rattling his alcohol-fueled cage, and attack me without my having
provoked him first, I'm going to retaliate for as long as it takes
until he shuts the fuck up again.

So, gilturd, how many dozens of new chickenshit TROLL aliases are you
going to hide behind this time?

How does it feel to almost belittle yourself to pleasure that albino
buffalo shemale thing just so she spends money on your monkey-ass?

Have you paid back at least one-fourth of that $30,000 you attempted
to swindle from some other female?

What does your current wife think about you ripping off some broad for
$30k while living with an albino something or other freak of nature
who financially supports your deadbeat monkey-ass?

And I forgot, is it the current wife that has the criminal record for
swindling something from someone, or one of the previous two
wife-cunts before her?

Oh yeah, that's right, the Deborah Lynch Florida real estate cunt
you're now putting up with solely for her money has been officially
reprimanded by the State of Florida for pilfering at least one
client's money. I'll present that factual data in follow-up.

Jeeze, you fucking lowlife crooks really huddle together, don't you?

Fucking scumbags of society.

-----------------------------

To i ... @RidingIntoHistory.org,

Is this the type of biker that Riding Into History endorses to promote
their events?

If the rest of your members and participants are as malicious as the
internet TROLL and sociopathic puke defined by the factual data below,
you all are useless pieces of shit that don't deserve to roam free in
society.

It is pretty twisted for you scumbags to promote, and take credit for
assisting, a breast cancer charity (and perhaps others) when the
president of a sponsoring motorcycle club is the asshole cited
numerous times below. He has hidden behind dozens and dozens of
internet identities (over 50 at last count!) to obfuscate his ongoing
abuse throughout the internet.

Fuck all you assholes for associating with the Gilturd piece of shit
responsible for years of ongoing internet and real life abuse.

&gt; **TROLLWATCH ADVISORY**

Hey ass-TROLL gilturd, how's that fictitious real estate doing
these days? How much of that $30,000 UNSECURED (meaning, no
real property or other assets available for collateral; i.e., a
deadbeat!!) "soft loan" from three years ago have you paid back yet?

$30,000 worth of methamphetamine is a heavy load to ingest within
two year's time so you can ride your shitty motorcycle without
stopping to sleep on occasion.

But, you like being so cranked up on meth that you don't even realize
you shit your pants again to begin breeding one or another
fecal-related communicable diseases, don't ya?

How many more clients has that shifty cunt you sponge off of stolen
from lately?

Both barrels, huh?

As seen below, you two grifters are a matched pair of lowlife,
deadbeat scum.

Jeese ... after I had to do the unthinkable several years ago (go
back to work) I thought that times were really tough these days.
Hearing everyone's tales made me realize that I've been pretty lucky.

My bonus:  Several thousand $$$ from The Day Job a few months ago,
several hundred extra during X-mas, and a $30K soft loan from a
friend to buy some property about a month ago.
======================================

$30000 / 29 months = $1034.48276 per month

$1034.48276 / 4 weeks = $258.62069

You sure as fuck haven't been paying over $250 PER WEEK
to have fully repaid that $30k by now. Not at little more than
minimum wage they pay you (at age 50!) at internet abuse

Since skanky old albino buffalo-looking Deborah Lynch is aware of

enough to encounter him online, and fully supports him to the point
of advising him to give his victims "both barrels", here's a bit of
information as to how she has a problem handling the money of her

Ya gotta understand, "al-ice" there can't spell so well, having
flunked 2nd grade three years in a row, and he always transposes the
"p" with a "b".

Cut him some slack, in another ten years or so he may learn to spell
him name correctly, like this: "pig al-ice."

Meanwhile, back to the report card of another dunce....

Hey ass-TROLL gilturd, how's that fictitious real estate doing
these days? How much of that $30,000 UNSECURED (meaning, no
real property or other assets available for collateral; i.e., a
deadbeat!!) "soft loan" from three years ago have you paid back yet?

$30,000 worth of methamphetamine is a heavy load to ingest within
two year's time so you can ride your shitty motorcycle without
stopping to sleep on occasion.

But, you like being so cranked up on meth that you don't even realize
you shit your pants again to begin breeding one or another
fecal-related communicable diseases, don't ya?

How many more clients has that shifty cunt you sponge off of stolen
from lately?

Both barrels, huh?

As seen below, you two grifters are a matched pair of lowlife,
deadbeat scum.

Jeese ... after I had to do the unthinkable several years ago (go

Hearing everyone's tales made me realize that I've been pretty lucky.

My bonus:  Several thousand $$$ from The Day Job a few months ago,
several hundred extra during X-mas, and a $30K soft loan from a
friend to buy some property about a month ago.
======================================

$30000 / 29 months = $1034.48276 per month

$1034.48276 / 4 weeks = $258.62069

You sure as fuck haven't been paying over $250 PER WEEK
to have fully repaid that $30k by now. Not at little more than
minimum wage they pay you (at age 50!) at internet abuse

209.177.232.245 = Moffitt Corporation

My bonus:  Several thousand $$$ from The Day Job a few months ago,
several hundred extra during X-mas, and a $30K soft loan from a
friend to buy some property about a month ago.
======================================

$30000 / 29 months = $1034.48276 per month

$1034.48276 / 4 weeks = $258.62069

You sure as fuck haven't been paying over $250 PER WEEK
to have fully repaid that $30k by now. Not at little more than
minimum wage they pay you (at age 50!) at internet abuse
facilitating Moffitt Corporation in Jacksonville Beach, Florida!

Bwahahahaahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Since skanky old albino buffalo-looking Deborah Lynch is aware of
gilturd's ongoing harassment of just about everyone unfortunate
enough to encounter him online, and fully supports him to the point
of advising him to give his victims "both barrels", here's a bit of
information as to how she has a problem handling the money of her
real estate clients. The shady cunt apparently needed to buy
fat-fuck johnturd a new shiny bauble to quit his incessant whining,
temporarily, at least.

The "NNTP-Posting-Host: 209.177.232.245" data in the headers
of numerous messages he has transmitted show that they
originated at his place of employment, Moffitt Corporation in
Jacksonville Beach,Florida. What a shit-hole that must be to
allow an abject loser like him to post all manner of malicious
and racist content all day long.

209.177.232.245 = Moffitt Corporation

Moffitt Corporation
1351 13th Avenue South, Suite 130
Jacksonville Beach, FL 32250

The messages with headers transmitted via "NNTP-Posting-Host:
24.129.77.189" are those he typically spews away from Moffitt
Corporation, usually from the house owned by his facilitating
girlfriend Deborah Lynch rather than that of his current wife
Claudia, aka "Joey.

A recent development is that "PirateJohn" Gilmer posted messages
that originate from the 216.253.112.18 domain which is
registered to Venus Medical Communications, 1351 13TH AVE S,
JAXVILLE BCH, FL, 32250 which, not too surprisingly, is a very
close neighbor of Moffitt Corporation whose address is 1351 13th
Avenue South, Suite 130, Jacksonville Beach, FL 32250!

My name is William Bill Cmelak. I am a fat and stupid shithead. I
have been stalking another guy for almost three years because I am
jealous of him and because he hurt my widdle feelings over three years
ago and I just cannot get over the pain. I live in an old mobile home
here:

William Cmelak
N9340 Pickerel Creek Rd
Pearson, WI 54462-8140

I drive a 25 year old military truck because that's all that I can
afford. I flunked out of trade school.  I spend all of my time at my
computer using an
old dial up connection.  The rest of the time I watch television 24/7.
No one
will give me the respect that I think that I deserve.

Two years ago I was approached by an old woman named Karen Anderson
who talked me into helping her stalk and troll this guy. She had had
a crush on him and he kicked her to the curb. She drove to his town
and followed him around for two days without him knowing it. She is
also jealous of him. Anderson has stalked several other men before.

She lives at:

Karen Anderson
3590 Narrows View Lane NE #102
Bremerton, WA 98310

Anderson and I are both addicted to stalking. We know that what we do
is wrong, and we see this other guy kick our asses all the time, but
we just don't have the willpower to stop.

I am so jealous, jealous, JEALOUS of that guy that it makes me want
to BURST.   I spend all of my time researching what he does, where he
lives.  Hell, I even follow his eBay account.

This dude that I hate is popular in his town and community and I HATE
that.  So I make up crap about him and his girlfriend and post it to
newsgroups and generally make a nusiance out of myself.  Most of what I

make
up is a complete figment of my imagination but if I repeat my lies
often enough maybe someone will believe them.

This guy just drives me CRAZY.  He's president of a motorcycle club,
he's involved with several charities.  Everyone that meets him seems to

like
him. I am so damned jealous that I cannot stand it.

Did I mention that I am jealous?

He lives in a warm climate, and I am stuck in the sticks of Wisconsin,
barely able to afford heating oil.

He travels all the time and I haven't been out of Wisconsin in years.

He is active, and my health issues keep me from leaving the house.

He motorcycles all over the country and into Mexico and I
cannot ride any more.

This guy makes more money than I do and that can't be right.  I just
know there's something wrong there.

He has a girlfriend that loves him and takes care of him and I haven't
had a date with a woman for over 10 years. And when he was single he
got
laid all of the time.  Now that's not right.

What can I possibly do?  I am so unhappy.

Maybe, but we'll have to wait a month to find out.  80)&gt;

I guess Roach thinks that he's going to stop everybody from replying to
people that he's killfiled and that's not being very realistic. He's
taking the attitude that everybody in this group uses killfiles the way
he does, and that's not the case. At least I *wasn't* until Roach
killfiled ME.

I'm hoping that pointing out the legal ramifications of slander to
Hoodini will make him reconsider what he's doing. If there's something
wrong with doing that, then so be it.

This is, after all, an unmoderated group. Nobody runs it or tells me
what to do.

"Futile", "ineffective" or "ill-advised" might be better choices to
describe how you feel about my post. I doubt that you'd appreciate me
calling anything *you* did "stupid." In any event, it remains to be seen
whether or not he'll mellow out. It certainly doesn't serve any purpose
to stalk somebody to the point of breaking the law.

Agreed regarding taking it easy, but I'll point out that this great new
newsreader of mine has a Bozo Button that marks people as bozos. I
still can see their messages, but it's easy to ignore them.

The funny thing about this group to me is that 75% of the time that
seems like someone is angry at someone they're being sarcastic. The
problem is that I can't tell the difference most of the time. I can't
get too worked up about it either way. Now that I'm getting used to who
knows who it's a bit easier.
