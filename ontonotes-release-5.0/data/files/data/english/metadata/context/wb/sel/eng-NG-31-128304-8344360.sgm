Hi, guys.  I have heard a few stories from various people, and I'm
wondering if there is a trend here...  I'm starting to see one
forming.

We were told a couple weeks ago that units would be closing 8 per day
beginning July 16.  That means about 80 units should be closed by
now.  Sales office is saying about 30 have closed.  According to Bill
and Mary, there seems to be only a handful of people who have actually
moved in.

Has anyone's closing been delayed past what was set forth in your
closing letter?  What reasons have been given?  No certificate of
occupancy?  any other reason?

It would be a shame if arbitrary closing dates were given out with no
intention to actually close... only to try to get people to not cancel
their contracts.

It would be an even greater shame if closings were being made
unnecessarily difficult in the hopes that people with below-market
units would cancel...

Please post and let us know if any of this strikes a nerve... or feel
free to email me directly if you don't want to post.

Just trying to get the facts straight... it would also be a shame if
negative publicity came out at this stage in the Beacon's
development... it would hurt everyone equally.

Three more people (couples?) moved in yesterday (haven't met them yet)
and we are expecting more today. We were told that as many as 50
movins would be completed in the next 10 days, so we are expecting a
lot more residents to be here soon. Closings don't equal movins
though. Manny &amp; Linda bought two apartments next to each other and one
person bought 10 apartments, so there could have been a number of
closings that didn't result in anyone moving in.
The construction crews are working at least 6 days a week and I've
seen welders and others here as early as 6:00 a.m. and as late as 9:30
p.m. All of the construction crews are being held to schedules and
told they need to meet the schedule to stay on the job.
When we were at the law office two weeks ago they were committed to 8
closings per day, and they did make the effort to reschedule our own
closing for the next day when we were delayed a day, but not without
some pushing because they said they were already doing 8 other
closings that day. I think that goal was very aggressive. I don't know
if that has changed, or if it was unrealistic, but I can see every day
that the management and construction groups are doing everything they
can to get things done, even though there is still a tremendous amount
left to do. For example, many of the spaces where the amenities are
supposed to be are still just bare metal studs and open ceilings. On
the other hand we've seen carpet, tile and other flooring, furniture,
built ins, etc, appear in new rooms and hallways daily, and I saw no
less than 4 trucks full of sheetrock arrive at 7 a.m. this morning.
However, we can't really see much of the construction areas because
security makes sure we don't wander, and they are here 24/7.

My concern is that when builders rush to stay on schedule, quality
suffers.  I'd hate to think that this beautiful building (or at the
very least, my future unit) might be compromised by a hurried
construction job... That's why I will certainly use a building
inspector as part of the process.  But an inspector won't be able to
tell me if they skimp on the common areas, which can also have an
adverse effect on property values.

Being on site I have to say I don't see a lot of rushing in what the
builders are doing. What I do see is a lot of people, and longer hours
than you would expect to see at the average construction job. We have
gotten to see a few other apartments (not all authorized, but some
doors have been left open:) and we have seen the same quality and
attention to detail as in our space.
One of the things that may help protect value in the common areas is
that they have a very well respected historical expert advising them
on the resoration of the art deco public and commercial spaces. In
order to qualify for their 20% Federal Tax credit the developer must
restore the deco public and commercial spaces. I think she will help
to ensure that the restorations are done accurately and with quality,
since her name is now associated with the project.

Hi Everyone!  I moved in Sunday/Monday and was told the same that 50
move ins were to take place this week alone.  It's very hard to guage
just how many people are actually moved in because we are spread
between the two buildings and several floors but as my unit faces the
Rialto, I can see that more of the units have furnishings &amp; people in
them than I actually see in my coming &amp; going.
The entire building staff is fantastic though - the valets, porters,
front desk, everyone you encounter!  We couldn't ask for friendly
people :)

That's a really good point, BillC.  To add to that, I have had the
opportunity to speak to a couple of people that work for George
Filopolous (Metrovest President) and they have advised that he is very
emotionally invested in the success of the development (and is
generally adamant about everything coming out perfect).  It's
essentially his baby.  Given that there are a number of buildings at
the complex still to be marketed, I think that it is imperative he
establishes the development as first rate, since this will further
enhance The Beacon's profile as it moves into Phase 2, 3, and onward.
The quality of the interiors and exteriors are a critical part of this
profile and central to the succeeding media coverage.

Further, since it seems that at least one of the buildings will be
converted to rental only, Filopolous will be financially invested in
the long-term prospects of the complex.  It gives me some comfort that
he will likely remain connected to The Beacon beyond the build-out.
His reputation is on the line, so I expect that he will do all he can
to ensure things get done right (recent issues aside).
