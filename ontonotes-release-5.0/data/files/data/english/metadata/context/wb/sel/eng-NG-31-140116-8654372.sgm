Dear Gazelle,

I know you read this newsgroup. I know you supermodels &quot;ain't into no
fancy book learnin'&quot; but listen to this:

You started dating Tom &quot;Mr. Metrosexual&quot; Brady in early November 2006.

He impregnated Midget Whorenahan (a woman his mother's age)
&quot;supposedly&quot; during that time.

The gestation period for a human baby is NINE months Gazelle!!!

It is now 8/20/2007, if Brady impregnated Whorenahan in early November
the baby should have been born WEEKS ago!!!!!!

Now Gazelle you should realize what is going on!! Â Plus Brady is
GAY!!!!

mr dude (please call me Gazelle - I can ease your pain)
