there seems to be reluctance in the jukebox collecting/restoring
community to help anybody for FREE.  there is a select few that have
set themselves up as paid distributors of schematics, manuals etc..
it is much different than the old radio community. i was talking to a
guy yesteday that paid over 600.00 to have his amp reworked by one of
these "experts".  what a ripoff.  i have already bought a manual off
ebay for 18.00.  i was wanting the chematic so i could go ahead and
work on the chassis. when i get the manual, i will scan the schematic
and post it for the world to use free. i wish i had them all, i would
post every one of them. kinda like nostagia air.

Same thing with the 16mm projector guys.  Hoarding public domain service
information and charging good money for it as if they own it.

Another thing I noticed about the Jukebox guys, they don't care as much as
we do about originality.  There's no certainly no capacitor restufffing
going on over there.

There ARE a few jukebox guys tht will help . I post on a usenet jukebox
group sometimes and get help . Most of them give very short very
technical answers that are hard to follow .
Some of my best juke help comes from someone reading the group but only
emails the help .. great !

I got hold of a jukebox that uses those mid 70`s black and gray mystery
boxes in them . No one wanted to ``spill the help `` on those , only
wanted to sell the book on them .
A guy through emails was the ticket . turns out most of the mystery
boxes are not all that hard to fix if you can solder and test
transistors .

i am sure there are some good ones.  i remember a brief period here 10
or 12 years ago when you would post a request for a schematic, you
would get 3 or 4 offers in your email box to sell you one. a few of
the good guys like ed mielke and norm over on the forum put an end to
that. they would scan them and send them to whoever needed them. then
there was nostalgia air. i have scanned dozens of scematics for people
since i got my set of riders. it seems a little favor you can do for a
person.  it only takes a minute. maybe somebody will step up and do
the nostagia air thing for jukes. if i had the stuff, i would try to
at least do some.

Well, this is just a guess, but I suspect there are those of us who
would like to know what we're doing. That the parts in place are the
correct ones. Who knows, some time in the past a tech, who felt he
didn't need a schematic, just substituted what ever he had on hand.

We had permission from both Eastman Kodak and Bell &amp; Howell Company to
sell authorized manuals on that CD rom. Many of those manuals also
included "extra" material created by me especially for that disc that
was never in the original manuals. Then someone copied them all from
our CD and posted them for free. Hence I will never again put any more
of my projector manuals from my vast collection on a cd or anywhere. I
was all set to put several copyrighted technical articles I wrote
about Bell &amp; Howell and Eiki projectors on that CD rom, but since the
security was compromised I was about to somebody copy that information
and post it for free. I worked hard on that information and now
everyone loses.

I don't know if all people in the projector hobby are so cheap as to be
not willing to pay a realistic fee for something they want, but you can
always put a small message in each PDF "If you find this manual useful,
please make a donation, etc.". In most newsgroups and other hobby-media,
it is all about sharing information and knowledge, money comes in second.
People _are_ grateful for what you are doing. If that, and the money you
make on selling the occasional CD, isn't enough for you to share your
knowledge, so be it, but i am sure that's a loss for the hobby as a whole.

so...since you can't profit off the material, you are just going to
sit on it? was this public domain stuff? are you paying royalties?
everybody loses when some don't share their knowledge/reference
material. why not just scan it and post it on the net? or, give/sell
it to someone who will? gonna take it to the grave with you?

No, just you.  Never hear of copyrights? Of course you can't stop every
illegal copy, but you can stop any serious distribution of your property.

I couldn't guess what it would cost to create a copy of TenderTale from
scratch - but surely - at commercial rates it's in the high six to low
seven figures.  Yet anyone can go through it - with no strings - and
access any and every part of it. They can even copy parts - as long as
they stay within the fair-use rules (which are noted on the site). I
refuse to charge a dime - make zero - nada - zilch from it.  I won't
accept financial contributions (I bloody-well do accept contributions of
any and all materials to be included - giving credit of course).

That doesn't mean I just sit back and whimper when someone violates my
copyrights. Recently some cretin copied a chunk (no question well past
the fair-use rules limits) - and was using it to lure people into his
site - which was basically an advertising site for something
(xenadrine?).  Within a couple of hours of Lycos receiving my DMCA
"request" not only was the offending material pulled - they pulled the
site and banned the guy.

Same with ebay - often times people will use parts when describing stuff
(like for instance - they have a postcard of the USS Chicago - and quote
part of Chicago's page to relate a bit of her history - to make their
auction more "interesting").  I allow small quotes - afterall - that's
allowed under the fair-use rules. However - when they rip major chunks -
including pictures, etc. (esp. without crediting TenderTale nor
providing a link) - they get a "request".  If it's not gone in 24 hours
- ebay gets a DMCA notice (there is a very specific format and content
requirement - it's documented in several places on the net). Usually the
offending auction is fixed pronto- if not - it get's pulled - and in one
instance - a power seller got banned for a month. They haven't repeated
their offense - at least not with TenderTale.

Point is - you can pout and feel sorry for yourself- and contribute
nothing to the hobby - or you can take control - understand there will
be the occasional thief - but that's just the cost of doing business;
and if handled correctly - will limit your losses to a tolerable minimum
(provided your "tolerance" is reasonable).

Love it or Hate it - the DMCA has teeth - use them or not - your choice.

as always - just my .02

Ever try to get a Gottliebآ® pinball machine schematic or manual to
download free? Ain't gonna happen. You either have to buy hard copies
from the authorized source of www.pbresource.com or buy a used
original manual on ebay. Why is this you ask? Simple, the Gottlieb
family is very protective of their work. All the copyrights have been
renewed and kept up-to-date, even on 40 year old manuals. They will
sue anyone who posts any of their copyrighted manuals and/or
schematics. They aggressively prosecute anyone who violates their
copyrights/trademarks. Currently only Steve Young's Pinball Resource
is the authorized &amp; licensed Gottliebآ® pinball machine manual
reproducer.

Having thought it over again, I think there is a chance he will even make
_more_ money off of it if he puts in a donation request while people

Never read the DMCA have ya'? The ISP CAN be held liable. One only has
to attempt to work with the offending site owner - if that fails one can
go directly after the ISP (or other site owner - like ebay).

Which is as it should be. Both of my Gottliebs came with manuals in them
- I suspect many machines still have theirs. However - had they not had
a manual - buying one would be a no-brainer - as some of the Gottliebs
are pretty complicated (and mine was one of the elite Gottliebs).  I
can't imagine trying to keep that beast working without a manual...

Like I said - there are ways to protect copyrights... I doubt the
Gottliebs have to sue very often, at least on on-line offenses - as the
DMCA provides ample incentive for ISPs, etc. to comply before it gets
that far.

best regards...

&gt; offending auction is fixed pronto- if not - it get's pulled - and in one
&gt; instance - a power seller got banned for a month. They haven't repeated
&gt; their offense - at least not with TenderTale.

&gt; Point is - you can pout and feel sorry for yourself- and contribute
&gt; nothing to the hobby - or you can take control - understand there will
&gt; be the occasional thief - but that's just the cost of doing business;
&gt; and if handled correctly - will limit your losses to a tolerable minimum
&gt; (provided your &quot;tolerance&quot; is reasonable).

&gt; Love it or Hate it - the DMCA has teeth - use them or not - your choice.

&gt; as always - just my .02

there is a big difference between someone copying another's original
work and a schematic from an obsolete machine. you have people
claiming copyright to schematics and manuals that they themselves are
stealing. i doubt very seriously that most have ANY agreement with any
of the jukebox manufacturers. but you ask them for a schematic and
it's like you stabbed them in the heart. because philco allows one
person to use the name "philco" on their site doesn't mean they have
permission to use the name at will and market schematics, ads, manuals
etc..  i saw a guy make a big deal over at the forum because another
forum member used a scan of a 1938 zenith robot dial ad on his
website. problem is...the guy complaining stole the thing from zenith
to start with. it is a screwed up world in which we live. people put
ownership on the stupidest things.

I make it a point to get the schematic.

If I can not find one, I will work around it, reverse engineer
it if I have to. On anything complicated, I refuse to service
it. "Take it elsewhere." My customers appreciate that I will
spend the extra effort to "not guess" on their radio.

I've got a Technics SA-700 tuner/amp in the shop. The customer
was pleased that I found the service manual for it, despite the
fact that it took 3 months to locate it.

Admittedly it's fairly easy to guess as to what's going on in
an AA5 radio. Trying to reverse engineer something like a Philco
model 95 is an entirely different issue.

By the way, speaking of Philco Model 95s, I have one in the shop.
So I sat down with AutoCAD and generated a road map for ALL the
parts under the chassis that corresponds to the numbering system
on the schematic. It's available to anyone who wishes to have a
copy of it.

Yup...  and in this "example" (Gottlieb pins)... particularly with the
one I had - there are specs for adjustments, etc. that are quite precise
(particularly the trap door mechanism); - dip switch settings that can
be dizzying; and there would be no way to trouble-shoot the matrixes
without a chart (switch matrix, lamp matrix, etc.). You even need a
manual to figure out what was going on (or not) during a self test --
once you figured out how to step it through it's "self test cycle"-
which itself was super complicated.

Like I said - with the Gottlieb series 80s / 80As in general -- and
especially the 2 "monsters" - (The Haunted House (which is what I had)
and The Black Hole) --  a manual is essential if one has any hope of
keeping everything working.

best regards...

i've already tried fixed a vintage jukebox without a manual. you start
fiddling around with those microswitches and before long you have it
so screwed up it won't work at all. been there, done that. HAD to buy
a manual to straighten it out.

well...you can spend 3 days getting a juke to play so-so, or you can
spend 15-20.00 and do it right and do it in a couple of hours. i just
spent an hour pulling the motor, taking it apart, cleaning the old
grease out and relubbing it. it was running slow and hot and made
noise. it's smooth and quiet now and doesn't drag. it runs all the
time, so that is a setup problem. a switch is on somewhere where it
shouldn't be.  next is the rotating record holder.  the old jukes with
all their mechanical stuff are fun to work on. they actually require
some thought beyond changing a cap or resistor.

3 days .. a couple hours ...  Eddie thats not really possible :-)  i
have gotten jukeboxes to at least ``play a record`` in a couple hours
but only to see if it works .

It takes me days &amp; weeks to get one machine all done up right . A manual
for most models will tell you how to align most of it which is a big
help . Jukeboxes break down at times more so than radios .
The early machines like routine oiling . Seeburgs however seem to last
longer .
I sold my ( old ) boss a Seeburg tormat machine 6 years ago and the only
thing that went wrong was where his kids ripped the power cord out of it

On the other hand i sold a 1953 AMI machine and i have been over there
with the oil twice in one year . I showed them where to put the oil .

Must be over 10 years i traded another Seeburg tormat machine to a guy
and he has never called me for repair . Sold a Wurlitzer 1250 4 years
ago and only went back once .. forgot to solder the wires on a micro
switch .... DUH !

All of the older machines i take the mech out and totaly wash it down
with my favorite tire cleaner , lube &amp; align . The chassis all get
reworked , recapped and if needed washed down too . The inside of the
cabinets get repainted . Everything cleaned up like new . If &amp; when i do
go back for repair its always minor and clean . The service manuals for
seeburg are always very good at detail . Try the manual for the 1950 AMI
machines !  they are not much help other than setting pont gaps .
I enjoy working on the beasts . This area is interested in them ... sold
my last ``for sale one`` so i went out and bough 12 more . 4 in my
garage , 3 on the mend , one missing a chassis , 8 in storage . 9 of
them have service manuals tossed inside :-)

here is a picture of a 2810.  mine is labeled 2810, but it is a late
2710.  pretty much the same.  the chassis is 544, not 545 as a 2810.
when i said a couple of hours, i meant to set-up the mechanism.  not a
recap and all that. i generally don't need a schematic just to replace
caps, but someone has been in there before. (if you know what i mean)
i don't pull the carousel out unless i absolutely have to.  this one
is for me to use in my rec-room/barn. it's not one of the prettier
jukes, but it should survive well with a bunch of people using it.

That one is very worth restoring . I see that era of machines going up
in price on ebay as long as its working . On these fairly plain machines
i have been adding color here &amp; there to make it more desirable . Maybe
i will post the little Seeburg 100  am doing now . Made in 1967 and
about as square and bland as you can get . The only thing great about it
is its tiny . I am painting trim and stuff red and almond to brighten it
up . adding new multi colored title strips helps alot too .

Agree on the 2 hour thing ... i do that to be sure i am restoring a
working machine
Usually i will pull that entire mech out of the box and totaly wash it
down ( summer only ) that way every corner of it gets clean and every
part &amp; wire inspected and corrected from sometimes past hurry up repairs

Do you have a title strip program to make them ? Pinballrebel has a very
fast easy one free . If you want more choices i know of another site ,
its in my computer or you can go to the forum under phonographs and my
topic ``title strips`` and see it . 65LB  paper works good for this .

i saw that little program.  i have a tone of 45's, but of course the B
side is a throw away.  i will probably break down and buy one of those
packages that has a good song on both sides. i replaced the lowered
value filter caps and i have been playing it manually.  apparently it
has a leaky coupling cap.  the audio is a little distorted. could be
one of the filter caps i haven't changed yet.  waiting on mark to send
me some more caps. something is out of sequence. that's what is making
it spin all the time.  going to look at it right now....without a
manual or a schematic....
