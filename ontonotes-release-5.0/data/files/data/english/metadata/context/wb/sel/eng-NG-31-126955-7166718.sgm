"blah blah blah to achieve optimum results".

This is one that's had me a little confused for a while now...'-imum'
forms the noun; '-imal' forms the adjective, right?

Is optimum, above, being used in a nounal or adjectival sense? I would
posit that it's describing the results, ergo, optimal should be used.
On the other hand, The MacQ tells me that optimum is used as a noun
(1st def.) and as an adjective (2nd def.). Optimal is only defined as
an adjective.

Any chance some nice soul could provide me with a few examples, or let
me know if I've got it right:

I'd like to buy the maximum available. (Can maximum exist on its own
here, or must it be tied to a concrete noun - the maximum available of
*what*?)
The quality of this chocolate is maximal.

Once you've reached the optimal temperature, restart the process.
This temperature is optimum.

But maximal and optimum are both objects of 'to be'; can an object of
a verb be an adjective? I'm thinking that 'maximal' is describing the
*quality* of the chocolate, wheras 'optimum' is an equivalent of
temperature (temperature = optimum; I'm not sure what the correct
terms are for describing this grammatically)...

This usage of "optimum" is adjectival because the word madifies
"results". Nouns often function as adjectives in English.

If the writer/speaker means by "optimum results" a specific set of
results that have been stipulated as the "best possible known results
in this situation", then it's okay. If the writer/speaker means the
"best possible unknown results in this situation", then it should be
"optimal".

IOW, I would say that "optimum results" indicates a known set of best
results but that "optimal results" indicates an unknown set of best
results. Both in specific circumstances, however.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes. It's a noun modified by the adjective "available".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, "This is maximal quality chocolate". Not a pretty sentence, but
grammatically and semantically correct.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I wouldn't use both "optimal" and "optimum" to describe the same
temperature. Choose one and stick with it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
> But maximal and optimum are both objects of 'to be';

They are complements of the "be" verb; they are predicate adjectives in
the sentences "This is {maximal/optimum}". To make "optimum" a noun
(and a predicate nominative but not an object of the copula, which is
not a transitive verb and so cannot have a direct or indirect object
but only a complement), you'd need to say "This is the optimum".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
> can an object of a verb be an adjective?
">

Yes and no: "John gave Mary red roses for their wedding anniversary,
but for St Patrick's Day, her gave her green". "Green" is an adjective
in this ellipitcal sentence: "roses" has been elided.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

It depends on whether "optimum" is used as an adjective or a noun.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'm not sure either, but I don't think it matters much. Well, at least
not to me it doesn't.
