Genesis 25:19-28:9  And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's
son: Abraham begot Isaac.  (20)  And Isaac was forty years old when
he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram,
the sister of Laban the Aramean, to be his wife.  (21)  And Isaac
entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren; and the LORD
let Himself be entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
(22)  And the children struggled together within her; and she
said: 'If it be so, wherefore do I live?' And she went to inquire of
the LORD.  (23)  And the LORD said unto her: Two nations are in thy
womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one
people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall
serve the younger.  (24)  And when her days to be delivered were
fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.  (25)  And the first
came forth ruddy, all over like a hairy mantle; and they called his
name Esau.  (26)  And after that came forth his brother, and his hand
had hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was
threescore years old when she bore them.  (27)  And the boys grew;
and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a
quiet man, dwelling in tents.  (28)  Now Isaac loved Esau, because he
did eat of his venison; and Rebekah loved Jacob.  (29)  And Jacob sod
pottage; and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint.  (30)
And Esau said to Jacob: 'Let me swallow, I pray thee, some of this
red, red pottage; for I am faint.' Therefore was his name called
Edom.  (31)  And Jacob said: 'Sell me first thy birthright.'  (32)
And Esau said: 'Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit
shall the birthright do to me?'  (33)  And Jacob said: 'Swear to me
first'; and he swore unto him; and he sold his birthright unto
Jacob.  (34)  And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and
he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised
his birthright.  (26:1)  And there was a famine in the land, beside
the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto
Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.  (2)  And the LORD
appeared unto him, and said: 'Go not down unto Egypt; dwell in the
land which I shall tell thee of.  (3)  Sojourn in this land, and I
will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy
seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath
which I swore unto Abraham thy father;  (4)  and I will multiply thy
seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these
lands; and by thy seed shall all the nations of the earth bless
themselves;  (5)  because that Abraham hearkened to My voice, and
kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.'  (6)  And
Isaac dwelt in Gerar.  (7)  And the men of the place asked him of his
wife; and he said: 'She is my sister'; for he feared to say: 'My
wife'; 'lest the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah, because
she is fair to look upon.'  (8)  And it came to pass, when he had
been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked
out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with
Rebekah his wife.  (9)  And Abimelech called Isaac, and
said: 'Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how saidst thou: She
is my sister?' And Isaac said unto him: 'Because I said: Lest I die
because of her.'  (10)  And Abimelech said: 'What is this thou hast
done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife,
and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.'  (11)  And
Abimelech charged all the people, saying: 'He that toucheth this man
or his wife shall surely be put to death.'  (12)  And Isaac sowed in
that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold; and the LORD
blessed him.  (13)  And the man waxed great, and grew more and more
until he became very great.  (14)  And he had possessions of flocks,
and possessions of herds, and a great household; and the Philistines
envied him.  (15)  Now all the wells which his father's servants had
digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped
them, and filled them with earth.  (16)  And Abimelech said unto
Isaac: 'Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.'  (17)  And
Isaac departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt
there.  (18)  And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they
had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had
stopped them after the death of Abraham; and he called their names
after the names by which his father had called them.  (19)  And
Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of
living water.  (20)  And the herdmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's
herdmen, saying: 'The water is ours.' And he called the name of the
well Esek; because they contended with him.  (21)  And they digged
another well, and they strove for that also. And he called the name
of it Sitnah.  (22)  And he removed from thence, and digged another
well; and for that they strove not. And he called the name of it
Rehoboth; and he said: 'For now the LORD hath made room for us, and
we shall be fruitful in the land.'  (23)  And he went up from thence
to Beer-sheba.  (24)  And the LORD appeared unto him the same night,
and said: 'I am the God of Abraham thy father. Fear not, for I am
with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for My servant
Abraham's sake.'  (25)  And he builded an altar there, and called
upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there; and there
Isaac's servants digged a well.  (26)  Then Abimelech went to him
from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his
host.  (27)  And Isaac said unto them: 'Wherefore are ye come unto
me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?'  (28)  And
they said: 'We saw plainly that the LORD was with thee; and we said:
Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and
let us make a covenant with thee;  (29)  that thou wilt do us no
hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee
nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace; thou art now the
blessed of the LORD.'  (30)  And he made them a feast, and they did
eat and drink.  (31)  And they rose up betimes in the morning, and
swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed
from him in peace.  (32)  And it came to pass the same day, that
Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they
had digged, and said unto him: 'We have found water.'  (33)  And he
called it Shibah. Therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto
this day.  (34)  And when Esau was forty years old, he took to wife
Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter
of Elon the Hittite.  (35)  And they were a bitterness of spirit unto
Isaac and to Rebekah.  (27:1)  And it came to pass, that when Isaac
was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called
Esau his elder son, and said unto him: 'My son'; and he said unto
him: 'Here am I.'  (2)  And he said: 'Behold now, I am old, I know
not the day of my death.  (3)  Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy
weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me
venison;  (4)  and make me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it
to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.'
(5)  And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau
went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.  (6)  And
Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying: 'Behold, I heard thy father
speak unto Esau thy brother, saying:  (7)  Bring me venison, and make
me savoury food, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD
before my death.  (8)  Now therefore, my son, hearken to my voice
according to that which I command thee.  (9)  Go now to the flock,
and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make
them savoury food for thy father, such as he loveth;  (10)  and thou
shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, so that he may bless
thee before his death.'  (11)  And Jacob said to Rebekah his
mother: 'Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth
man.  (12)  My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to
him as a mocker; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a
blessing.'  (13)  And his mother said unto him: 'Upon me be thy
curse, my son; only hearken to my voice, and go fetch me them.'
(14)  And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother; and
his mother made savoury food, such as his father loved.  (15)  And
Rebekah took the choicest garments of Esau her elder son, which were
with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son.
(16)  And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
and upon the smooth of his neck.  (17)  And she gave the savoury food
and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son
Jacob.  (18)  And he came unto his father, and said: 'My father'; and
he said: 'Here am I; who art thou, my son?'  (19)  And Jacob said
unto his father: 'I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as
thou badest me. Arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that
thy soul may bless me.'  (20)  And Isaac said unto his son: 'How is
it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son?' And he said: 'Because
the LORD thy God sent me good speed.'  (21)  And Isaac said unto
Jacob: 'Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether
thou be my very son Esau or not.'  (22)  And Jacob went near unto
Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said: 'The voice is the voice
of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.'  (23)  And he
discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother
Esau's hands; so he blessed him.  (24)  And he said: 'Art thou my
very son Esau?' And he said: 'I am.'  (25)  And he said: 'Bring it
near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may
bless thee.' And he brought it near to him, and he did eat; and he
brought him wine, and he drank.  (26)  And his father Isaac said unto
him: 'Come near now, and kiss me, my son.'  (27)  And he came near,
and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed
him, and said: See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field
which the LORD hath blessed.  (28)  So God give thee of the dew of
heaven, and of the fat places of the earth, and plenty of corn and
wine.  (29)  Let peoples serve thee, and nations bow down to thee. Be
lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee.
Cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be every one that
blesseth thee.  (30)  And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made
an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the
presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his
hunting.  (31)  And he also made savoury food, and brought it unto
his father; and he said unto his father: 'Let my father arise, and
eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.'  (32)  And
Isaac his father said unto him: 'Who art thou?' And he said: 'I am
thy son, thy first-born, Esau.'  (33)  And Isaac trembled very
exceedingly, and said: 'Who then is he that hath taken venison, and
brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have
blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.'  (34)  When Esau heard
the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter
cry, and said unto his father: 'Bless me, even me also, O my
father.'  (35)  And he said: 'Thy brother came with guile, and hath
taken away thy blessing.'  (36)  And he said: 'Is not he rightly
named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away
my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing.' And
he said: 'Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?'  (37)  And Isaac
answered and said unto Esau: 'Behold, I have made him thy lord, and
all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and
wine have I sustained him; and what then shall I do for thee, my
son?'  (38)  And Esau said unto his father: 'Hast thou but one
blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father.' And Esau
lifted up his voice, and wept.  (39)  And Isaac his father answered
and said unto him: Behold, of the fat places of the earth shall be
thy dwelling, and of the dew of heaven from above;  (40)  And by thy
sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother; and it shall
come to pass when thou shalt break loose, that thou shalt shake his
yoke from off thy neck.  (41)  And Esau hated Jacob because of the
blessing wherewith his father blessed him. And Esau said in his
heart: 'Let the days of mourning for my father be at hand; then will
I slay my brother Jacob.'  (42)  And the words of Esau her elder son
were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son,
and said unto him: 'Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth
comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.  (43)  Now therefore, my
son, hearken to my voice; and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to
Haran;  (44)  and tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury
turn away;  (45)  until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and
he forget that which thou hast done to him; then I will send, and
fetch thee from thence; why should I be bereaved of you both in one
day?'  (46)  And Rebekah said to Isaac: 'I am weary of my life
because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob take a wife of the
daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what
good shall my life do me?'  (28:1)  And Isaac called Jacob, and
blessed him, and charged him, and said unto him: 'Thou shalt not take
a wife of the daughters of Canaan.  (2)  Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to
the house of Bethuel thy mother's father; and take thee a wife from
thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother.  (3)  And God
Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, that
thou mayest be a congregation of peoples;  (4)  and give thee the
blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy seed with thee; that thou
mayest inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto
Abraham.'  (5)  And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Paddan-aram
unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah,
Jacob's and Esau's mother.  (6)  Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed
Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram, to take him a wife from
thence; and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge,
saying: 'Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan';
(7)  and that Jacob hearkened to his father and his mother, and was
gone to Paddan-aram;  (8)  and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan
pleased not Isaac his father;  (9)  so Esau went unto Ishmael, and
took unto the wives that he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael
Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, to be his wife.

(Haftarah)
Malachi 1:1-2:7  The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by
Malachi.  (2)  I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say: 'Wherein
hast Thou loved us?' Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD;
yet I loved Jacob;  (3)  But Esau I hated, and made his mountains a
desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.
(4)  Whereas Edom saith: 'We are beaten down, but we will return and
build the waste places'; thus saith the LORD of hosts: They shall
build, but I will throw down; and they shall be called The border of
wickedness, and The people whom the LORD execrateth for ever.  (5)
And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say: 'The LORD is great beyond
the border of Israel.'  (6)  A son honoureth his father, and a
servant his master; if then I be a father, where is My honour? and if
I be a master, where is My fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O
priests, that despise My name. And ye say: 'Wherein have we despised
Thy name?'  (7)  Ye offer polluted bread upon Mine altar. And ye
say: 'Wherein have we polluted thee?' In that ye say: 'The table of
the LORD is contemptible.'  (8)  And when ye offer the blind for
sacrifice, is it no evil! And when ye offer the lame and sick, is it
no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with
thee? or will he accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.  (9)
And now, I pray you, entreat the favour of God that He may be
gracious unto us! - This hath been of your doing. - Will He accept
any of your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.  (10)  Oh that there
were even one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not
kindle fire on Mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith
the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
(11)  For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
same My name is great among the nations; and in every place offerings
are presented unto My name, even pure oblations; for My name is great
among the nations, saith the LORD of hosts.  (12)  But ye profane it,
in that ye say: 'The table of the LORD is polluted, and the fruit
thereof, even the food thereof, is contemptible.'  (13)  Ye say
also: 'Behold, what a weariness is it!' and ye have snuffed at it,
saith the LORD of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by
violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering;
should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.  (14)  But cursed
be he that dealeth craftily, whereas he hath in his flock a male, and
voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a
great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and My name is feared among the
nations.  (2:1)  And now, this commandment is for you, O ye priests.
(2)  If ye will not hearken, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to
give glory unto My name, saith the LORD of hosts, then will I send
the curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings; yea, I curse
them, because ye do not lay it to heart.  (3)  Behold, I will rebuke
the seed for your hurt, and will spread dung upon your faces, even
the dung of your sacrifices; and ye shall be taken away unto it.
(4)  Know then that I have sent this commandment unto you, that My
covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.  (5)  My
covenant was with him of life and peace, and I gave them to him, and
of fear, and he feared Me, and was afraid of My name.  (6)  The law
of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his
lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and did turn many
away from iniquity.  (7)  For the priest's lips should keep
knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the
messenger of the LORD of hosts.
