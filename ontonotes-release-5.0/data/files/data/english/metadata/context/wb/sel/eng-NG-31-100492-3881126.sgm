In effort to fight what we believe to be unfair sales and labor
practices as well as stand up for  Hispanic women's right to work in
a company dominated by white males - Group 1 Automotive, Inc., we're
organizing a boycott of the Group 1 Automotive, Inc. Dealerships.

As we gear up for the launch, we are trying to collect as many horror
stories as possible from consumers and employees (most have been
ex-employees).  If you have had a bad experience, like many others
we've found, at any of the Group 1 Automotive dealerships listed
below.  Please submit your story to our website @

Oh, your boycotting because they do not hire illegal aliens! Well because of
that I am going to buy my next car from them. I think we should all boycott
companies that DO hire illegals!

Notices of unfair sales/labor practices are best forwarded to the
appropriate governmental agency (or agencies) for their action.  If the
practices are found to be unlawful, and egregious enough, THEY'LL take
care of the perpetrator(s).  Otherwise, attempting to drum up support
for your cause is likely only quixotic.

For what it's worth, I support the notion that *anyone* (not just a
particular ethnic group) should have the opportunity to *seek*
employment at any establishment.  And, the employer should not be
forced to accept a less-qualified applicant, regardless of the
applicant's ethnic heritage.

I agree with your statement 100% but as I am sure that you are aware,
that is not the situation in this case.  I think that at times,
employers use similar tactics:

we do NOT live in france and the employer has every right to hire anyone
they feel fit regardless.  this is also not the group for this sort of
discussion unless you have an issue with a car/truck (Dodge, as the group
feed implies) you are seeking help on.

Your site says it is currently "under review" by a legal representative.
You mean you didn't vet out the legal ramifications of possibly
libeling another party BEFORE you put this site up?

Lovely.

It may come as some surprise to you, but maybe, just MAYBE, a Hispanic
woman may not be qualified for a particular job. Maybe, just MAYBE, a
black man, or yellow, brown, purple or white man may be better
qualified for a particular job.

This country is going to hell because people like you seem to think
that your ethnicity should be the reason you get a particular job...
Why don't you start your own company and dominate it with Hispanic
women? This is America, after all.

Then you can hire any damned person you want, qualified or not.

It seems that some Hispanic female somewhere didn't get the job she
applied for and nowadays, it always has to turn into a race issue. If
you're any color but white, you
pull out the race card and scream discrimination. And then sometimes,
it's just a way
to try to extort money from a successful company via lawsuit. This crap
is getting very very old. These days when people get pissed about
something, they turn it into WW III and immediately go start a website.
Any flunky with $8.95 can start a website. Whoopee!

Why are you writing this reply to me, you dumb fuck?  You're as much an
idiot as the original poster.  Smeg off, and take all the illegal aliens
with you, fuckstick.

To be sure, there are employers who are far from respectable.  As well,
there are unions that are about as useful as breasts on a boar hog --
some have proven to be corrupt.  In regard to this matter, the *only*
thing I am aware of regarding this is that you appear to be zealous in
collecting horror stories against *one* employer, involving *one*
ethnic group.

Since you agree with my statement 100%, you are then aware that what
you are attempting to do has no hope of succeeding.  Therefore, you're
likely either being forced to do it, have some personal axe to grind,
or have some financial interest in this "cause".  History says the
latter is most likely.  I'd also bet that most lurkers to this thread
would feel the same.  D'ya get the feeling you've been plonked?
