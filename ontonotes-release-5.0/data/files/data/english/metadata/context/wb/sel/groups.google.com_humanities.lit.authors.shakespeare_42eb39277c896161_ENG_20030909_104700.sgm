&gt; Justine Henin-Hardenne: a Walloon neighbour of Kim Clijsters

"/>

------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Walloon is spoken nowadays in the modern Belgian provinces of Hainaut,
Liège, Namur, Luxembourg, and southern BRABANT (they are called often
Wallonia), in tiny parts of Northwestern France (mainly in the city
of Givret in the departement of the Ardennes), and in the region
of Green Bay in the United States (Wisconsin), where a
compact group of Walloons settled in the 19th century.&gt;&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------
&lt;&lt;From the earliest times Norwich had been colonized by Flemish &amp;
Walloon refugees, and in 1571 there were 3,925 aliens dwelling within
the city. The number of silk workers (Deloney's own craft) seems to have
increased considerably during the latter half of the sixteenth century.
'Among the trading Strangers', writes Strype, 'that came over into
England from Elanders and those Parts for their Religion, in the said
Queen Elizabeths Reign, there were divers of this Sort that dealt
in dressing and preparing Silk for the other trades'; and it may
be remembered that alien artisans figure very prominently
in Deloney's novels.

Nash's epithet 'the Balletting Silke Weauer of Norwich' seems to point
to that town as the place of his birth, and it is significant that one
of his earliest ballads -- The Lamentation of Beckles (1586) -- was
printed 'for Nicholas Coleman of Norwich'. His name may indicate French
ancestry, and this, combined with his strong Anti-Catholicism, perhaps
points to descent from a Protestant silk-weaving family, one of those
which took refuge in East Anglia from Continental religious persecution.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;I am writing this to make known to other readers what may be the
first sonnet sequence in English written by an Englishwoman. It consists
of four sonnets and two quatrains in which the supposed poet, Anne Cecil
de Vere, Countess of Oxford (1556-88) mourns the death (in 1583) of her
new-born infant son, Lord Bulbecke. Together with a sonnet attributed
to Elizabeth I of England in which she mourns the recent death of the
Walloon Princess of Espinoy, Philippine-Christine de Lalang, heroine
of the 1581 siege of Tournai, the sequence first appeared in print in
Pandoora (1584), a slender book of verse otherwise attributed to
John Soowthern and dedicated to the infant's father, Edward de Vere,
the seventeenth Earl of Oxford (1550-1604).&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;Amaziah was not able to contain himself under that prosperity which
God had given him, although he had affronted God thereupon; but in a
vein of insolence he wrote to Joash, the king of Israel, and commanded
that he and all his people should be obedient to him, as they had
formerly been obedient to his progenitors, David and Solomon; and
he let him know, that if he would not be so wise as to do
what he commanded him, he must fight for his dominion.

To which message Joash returned this answer in writing:

&quot;King Joash to king Amaziah. There was a vastly tall CYPRESS tree in
Mount Lebanon, as also a THISTLE; this THISTLE sent to the CYPRESS tree
to give the CYPRESS tree's daughter in marriage to the THISTLE's son;
but as the THISTLE was saying this, there came a wild beast, and
trod down the THISTLE: and this may be a lesson to thee, not to
be so ambitious, and to have a care, lest upon thy good success
in the fight against the Amalekites thou growest so proud,
as to bring dangers upon thyself and upon thy kingdom.&quot;&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;We can now be sure that Bruegel was not himself a simple peasant, as
19th centrury critics still believed, but a cultured man in contact with
some of the best minds of the day. But Bruegel remains as dim and
shadowy - and in many ways as ambiguous - a figure as Shakespeare.&gt;&gt;
-- _Bruegel_ by Keith Roberts.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

BRUEGHEL, Pieter, the Elder (c. 1525/30-69), Flemish artist, active
in Antwerp &amp; Brussels, famous for his paintings and drawings of
landscapes and scenes of robust peasant life, and founder of a
dynasty of artists that remained active well into the 17th century.

Brueghel's art is often seen as the last phase in the development of a
long tradition of Netherlandish painting beginning with Jan van Eyck in
the 15th century. This tradition transformed the abstraction of medieval
art into a more empirical view of reality. Brueghel clearly rejected the
influences of Italian Renaissance art and its classical foundations,
which dominated the work of many of his Flemish contemporaries. Rather
than mythological subjects, muscular nudes, and idealized scenes,
Brueghel's art portrays figures observed from nature acting out
realistic situations in believable contemporaneous settings.

Brueghel is thought to have come from the town of Breda,
located in northern BRABANT in present-day Holland.
Before he became a member of the painters' guild in Antwerp
in 1551, he seems to have studied with Pieter Coecke (1502-50)
in Brussels and worked for a short time in Malines.
After a trip to Italy between 1552 and 1555, Brueghel returned to
Antwerp. In 1563 he married Coecke's daughter and moved to Brussels,
where he lived until his death in September 1569. Their two children,
Pieter the Younger and Jan, both became painters of some renown.

Brueghel's earliest works were landscapes, an interest he retained
throughout his life. A number of panoramic landscape drawings made
on his Italian trip-for example, those preserved in Berlin (1552,
Staatliche Museen) and in London (1553, British Museum)-show Brueghel's
early ability to depict changing seasonal moods and the atmospheric
qualities of nature. These characteristics appear in his later landscape
paintings, such as Hunters in the Snow (1565, Kunsthistorisches Museum,
Vienna) and Magpie on the Gallows (1568, Hessiches Landesmuseum,
Darmstadt, Germany). After his return to Antwerp from Italy in 1555,
Brueghel regularly made drawings for engravings published by the
printing house owned by the graphic artist Hieronymus Cock (c. 1510-70).
Some of Brueghel's drawings for Cock were landscapes, but others were
clearly meant to capitalize on the popularity of the bizarre art of
Brueghel's famous Flemish predecessor Hieronymus Bosch. The fantastic,
monstrous figures and demonic DWARFS in Brueghel's series of engravings
The Seven Deadly Vices (1557) are within this category. Late in the
1550s, Brueghel began a series of large painted panels with complex
compositions of Flemish folk life. The earliest of these is an
encyclopedic portrayal of common sayings, Netherlandish Proverbs (1559,
Staatliche Museen), followed by Combat Between Carnival and Lent (1559)
and Children's Games (1560, both Kunsthistorisches Museum).

All are marked by a keen perception of human nature,
pervasive wit, and the vitality of his peasant figures.
Later examples include Peasant Kermis and Peasant Wedding Feast.

Modern scholars are far from interpreting Brueghel's art
as simple drolleries and folk subjects painted by an artist
from mere peasant stock, as Karel van Mander (1548-1606)
described him in 1604. Recent writers see him as a knowledgeable
man with such intellectual friends as geographer Abraham Ortelius.
Brueghel's art has been variously interpreted as referring to the
conflicts between Roman Catholicism &amp; Protestantism, to the political
domination of the Lowlands by the Spanish, and as parallels to dramatic
allegories performed publicly by Flemish societies of rhetoric.&gt;&gt;

_Lohengrin_ by Richard Wagner

ACT I: Antwerp, c. 900s. On the banks of the Scheldt, a Herald announces
King Heinrich, who asks Count Telramund to explain why the Duchy of
BRABANT is torn by strife &amp; disorder. Telramund accuses his young ward,
ELSA, of having murdered her brother, Gottfried, heir to BRABANT's
Christian dynasty. (Gottfried was actually enchanted by the evil Ortrud,
whom Telramund has wed.) When ELSA is called to defend herself, she
relates a dream of a knight in shining armor who will come to save her.
The herald calls for the defender, but only when ELSA prays does the
knight appear, magically drawn in a boat by a SWAN. He betroths
himself to her on condition that SHE NEVER ASK HIS NAME OR ORIGIN.

Defeating Telramund in combat,
the newcomer establishes the innocence of his bride.

ACT II: Before dawn in the castle courtyard, Ortrud and the lamenting
Telramund swear vengeance. When ELSA appears serenely in a window,
Ortrud attempts to sow distrust in the girl's mind, preying on her
curiosity, but ELSA innocently offers the scheming Ortrud friendship.
Inside, while the victorious knight is proclaimed guardian of BRABANT,
the banned Telramund furtively enlists four noblemen to side with him
against his newfound rival. At the cathedral entrance, Ortrud and
Telramund attempt to stop the wedding - she by suggesting that the
unknown knight is in fact an impostor, he by accusing ELSA's bridegroom
of sorcery. The crowd stirs uneasily. Though troubled by doubt,
ELSA reiterates her faith in the knight before they enter the church,
accompanied by King Heinrich.

ACT III: Alone in the bridal chamber, ELSA and her husband express their
love until anxiety and uncertainty at last compel the bride to ask the
groom who he is and whence he has come. Before he can reply, Telramund
and his henchmen burst in. With a cry, ELSA hands the knight his sword,
with which he kills Telramund. Ordering the nobles to bear the body
to the king, he sadly tells ELSA he will meet her later
to answer her questions.

Escorting ELSA and the bier to the Scheldt, the knight tells the king
he cannot now lead the army against the Hungarian invaders. He explains
that his home is the temple of the Holy Grail at distant Monsalvat, to
which he must return; Parsifal is his father, &amp; Lohengrin is his name.
He bids farewell and turns to his magic SWAN. Now Ortrud rushes in,
jubilant over ELSA's betrayal of the man who could have broken the spell
that transformed her brother into a SWAN. But Lohengrin's prayers bring
forth Gottfried in place of his vanished SWAN, and after naming the boy
ruler of BRABANT, Lohengrin disappears, led by the dove of the Grail.
Ortrud perishes, and ELSA, calling for her lost husband,
falls lifeless to the ground.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Geneviève of BRABANT

&lt;&lt;According to the usual version, Geneviève is the wife of the Count
PALATINE Siegfried, residing in the region of Trier. When he is called
away on an expedition against the infidels, he entrusts his wife and
castle to the care of his major-domo Golo. Inflamed with sinful passion,
Golo makes advances to the countess, and on being repulsed, falsely
accuses her to her absent lord of adultery. The count sends word
to put his wife &amp; her new-born son to death, and Golo bids two
servants execute this command. But moved by pity they let her go, &amp;
she takes refuge in a cave in the ARDENnes together with her child,
who is miraculously suckled by a ROE. At the end of six years Count
Siegfried, who has in the meantime repented of his rash deed, is led
to this cave while pursuing the ROE, and a happy reunion is the result.

Golo dies a traitor's death, his limbs being torn asunder by four OXEN.

The fame of the story is due to the work of the French JESUIT René de
Cerisiers. His book, entitled &quot;L'Innocence reconnue ou Vie de Sainte
Geneviève de BRABANT&quot;, won immediate popularity. The oldest datable
edition is from 1638. Two years later this story, together with those
of Jeanne d'Arc and Hirlanda, was reprinted in &quot;Les trois états de
l'innocence affligée&quot;, etc. In Cerisiers' version the legend has been
considerably amplified; its pious character is emphasized, especially
through the copious introduction of miracles. Here also the child
receives the Biblical name BENONI (i.e. son of my sorrow, Gen.,
xxxv, 18) whence the &quot;Schmerzenreich&quot; of the German version. &gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;While the Spanish hold on the Catholic south of the Netherlands
during and after the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648) caused a decline
in BRABANT &amp; Flanders, there was a spectacular expansion in Holland,
to which artists, intellectuals, &amp; financiers had fled from Spanish
armies. The emergence of Amsterdam &amp; The Hague as capitals of an
empire and the birth of civic pride in writers of the &quot;Golden Age&quot;
symbolized the final passing of a medieval age belonging
to Ghent, Bruges, Liège, and Antwerp.

Spieghel, wrote for both the burgher &amp; scholar.
His Nieujaarliedekens (&quot;New Year Songs&quot;) &amp;
Lieden op 't Vader Ons (&quot;Songs on the Lord's Prayer&quot;) continued
a medieval tradition in a Renaissance style echoing Erasmian
moderation; his learned Twe-spraack vande Nederduitsche letterkunst
(1584; &quot;Dialogue on Dutch Literature&quot;) was intended to popularize the
use of a national language. His most scholarly work, the unfinished
Hertspieghel (1614; &quot;Mirror of the Heart&quot;), was particularly
abstruse because it represented a first attempt
at philosophizing in the vernacular &amp; in poetry.

The dichotomy inherent in the Renaissance--between popular religious
revival &amp; Humanism--was particularly marked in Holland because of the
incompatibility of Calvinistic principles with the ideals of pagan
antiquity. This caused a tense ambivalence in many writers of the 17th
century who took both their religion and their art seriously. Daniël
Heinsius, a celebrated Humanist at the University of Leiden, wrote
plays in Latin, but he also contributed to the vernacular by writing
Hymnus oft lof-sanck van Bacchus (1614; &quot;Hymn in Praise of Bacchus&quot;)
and an equally devout Lof-sanck van Jesus Christus (1615).

A poet, playwright, &amp; painter, *Gerbrand Adriaenszoon Bredero*
(1585-1618) took his material from the life of the commoner; his medium
was the folk song, farce, or comedy. His secular songs in medieval style
and devotional songs in Renaissance verse told of a passionate devotion
to women &amp; yearning for religious moderation. While his 3 tragicomedies
were not successful, his three farces marked the zenith of the medieval
genre. Contemporary life in Amsterdam provided material for his
2 comedies, including his masterpiece, Spaanschen Brabander (1617).

Amsterdam was the home of the poet &amp; dramatist Joost van den Vondel.
Like Bredero, he was self-educated, and he resolved the conflict between
artistic and religious leanings only when he entered the Roman Catholic
Church at age 54. This was a courageous act of faith at a time when
Catholics formed an unpopular minority. It is a measure of van den
Vondel's indomitable personality that his attitude toward contemporary
people and events, of which he was a fearless chronicler, still prevails
even when history has recorded a different view. He was as great an
artist of the Counter-Reformation as Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens.

The aristocratic *Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft* (1581-1647) was one of
a fortunate few in Holland to bring the refinements of the new art
directly from Italy. He lavished an Italianate flourish on his sonnets
and plays, the studied prose of his letters, and a monumental unfinished
history of the war against Spain. His castle at Muyden became a thriving
centre for the entertainment of artists and scholars attracted not only
by a mutual interest in poetry, music, and learning but also by the
charm of such gifted young women as Visscher daughters, Anna &amp; Maria.&gt;&gt;

HUBERT (bright mind) of Liege

Born: 705
Died: 30 May 727

Memorial: 3 November; 30 May

Also known as: Apostle of the ARDENNES

Profile: Grandson of Charibert, King of Toulouse. Son of Bertrand,
Duke of Aquitaine. Courtier at Nuestra in youth, &amp; passionately devoted
to the hunt. Married Floribanne, daughter of Dagobert, Count of Louvain
in 682. While hunting a stag, he received a vision of a crucifix
between its antlers, a voice warned him to turn to God, &amp; converted.
He became the spiritual student of Saint Lambert. Widower. Priest.
Bishop of Maestricht &amp; Liege. Evangelized the ARDENNE region,
converting the pagans and permitting them to decide on their
own to destroy their idols. Highly revered in the Middle Ages,
there were several military orders named in his honor.

Patronage: ARCHERS, dog bite, dogs, forest workers, furriers,
hunters, hunting, huntsmen, hydrophobia, machinists, mad dogs,
MATHEMATICIANS, metal workers, precision instrument makers.

Representation: stag bearing a crucifix between its antlers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
St. Hubert

&lt;&lt;Confessor, thirty-first Bishop of Maastricht, first Bishop of Liège,
and Apostle of the ARDENNES, born about 656; died at Fura (the modern
Tervueren), BRABANT, 30 May, 727 or 728. He was honored in the Middle
Ages as the patron of huntsmen, and the healer of hydrophobia (rabies).
He was the eldest son of Bertrand, Duke of Aquitaine, and grandson
of Charibert, King of Toulouse, a descendant of the great Pharamond.

As a youth, Hubert went to the court of Neustria, where his charming
manners and agreeable address won universal esteem, gave him a
prominent position among the gay courtiers, and led to his investment
with the dignity of &quot;count of the palace&quot;. He was a worldling and a
lover of pleasure, his chief passion being for the chase, to which
pursuit he devoted nearly all his time. The tyrannical conduct of Ebroin
caused a general emigration of the nobles and others to the court of
Austrasia. Hubert soon followed them and was warmly welcomed by Pepin
Heristal, mayor of the palace, who created him almost immediately
grand-master of the household. About this time (682) he married
Floribanne, daughter of Dagobert, Count of Louvain, and seemed to have
given himself entirely up to the ponp and vanities of this world. But a
great spiritual revolution was imminent. On Good Friday morn, when the
faithful were crowding the churches, Hubert sallied forth to the chase.
As he was pursuing a magnificent stag, the animal turned and, as the
pious legend narrates, he was astounded at perceiving a crucifix between
its antlers, while he heard a voice saying: &quot;Hubert, unless thou turnest
to the Lord, and leadest an holy life, thou shalt quickly go down
into hell&quot;. Hubert dismounted, prostrated himself and said,
&quot;Lord, what wouldst Thou have me do?&quot; He received the answer,
&quot;Go and seek Lambert, and he will instruct you.&quot;

Accordingly, he set out immediately for Maastricht, of which place St.
Lambert was then bishop. The latter received Hubert kindly, and became
his spiritual director. Hubert, losing his wife shortly after this,
renounced all his honors and his military rank, and gave up his
birthright to the Duchy of Aquitaine to his younger brother Eudon, whom
he made guardian of his infant son, Floribert. Having distributed all
his personal wealth among the poor, he entered upon his studies for the
priesthood, was soon ordained, and shortly afterwards became one of St.
Lambert's chief associates in the administration of his diocese. By the
advice of St. Lambert, Hubert made a pilgrimage to Rome and during his
absence, the saint was assassinated by the followers of Pepin. At the
same hour, this was revealed to the pope in a vision, together with an
injunction to appoint Hubert bishop, as being a worthy successor to the
see. Hubert was so much possessed with the idea of himself winning the
martyr's crown that he sought it on many occasions, but unsuccessfully.
He distributed his episcopal revenues among the poor, was diligent in
fasting and prayer, and became famous for his eloquence in the pulpit.
In 720, in obedience to a vision, Hubert translated St. Lambert's
remains from Maastrict to Liège with great pomp and ceremonial, several
neighboring bishops assisting. A church for the relics was built upon
the site of the martyrdom, and was made a cathedral the following year,
the see being removed from Maastricht to Liege, then only a small
village. This laid the foundation of the future greatness of Liege,
of which Lambert is honored as patron,
and St. Hubert as founder and first bishop.

His feast is kept on 3 November, which was probably the date of the
translation. St. Hubert was widely venerated in the Middle Ages,
and many military orders were named after him.&gt;&gt;

Jacques Coppenole (Gent.)
------------------------------------------------------------------
and much of Paris flocks to the Palace of Justice (i.e., the Paris
equivalent of an Inn of Court) to observe a new mystery play
written by Pierre Gringoire. (Gringoire was an illiterate poet
who was mentored by Hermetist Don Claude Frollo.) Sadly for
Pierre his play is soon upstaged by the arrival of
a hosier/gauntlet-maker Jacques Coppenole of G(h)ent.

When Coppenole is announced as: &quot;clerk to the aldermen of Ghent&quot;

he corrects the introduction to: &quot;Jacques Coppenole, hosier.
A hosier is good enough for me.
The archduke has more than once sought his gauntlet in my hose.&quot;

&quot;Your name?&quot; demanded the usher.

&quot;Jacques Coppenole.&quot;

&quot;Your degree?&quot;

&quot;Hosier, at the sign of the 'Three Chains' in Ghent.&quot;

The usher recoiled. To announce sheriff and burgomaster
was bad enough; but a hosier-no, that passed all bounds!

The Cardinal was on thorns. Everybody was staring and listening. For
two whole days had his Eminence been doing his utmost to lick these
FLEMISH BEARS into shape in order to make them somewhat presentable
in public-this contretemps was a rude shock.

FLEMISH Martin (the Younger) DROESHOUT's Folio portrait of Shakespeare
was described by painter Gainsborough: &quot;I never saw a stupider face.
It is impossible that such a mind and such a rare talent
should shine with such a face and such a pair of eyes.&quot;

The Guardian [London], September 14, 1999

&lt;&lt;Two short plays, or masques, co-written by the dramatist Ben JONSON
&amp; INIGO JONES, the architect and stage designer, were unearthed by
chance in the archives of Wilton House, ancient seat of the earls
of Pembroke, during research for an exhibition to mark the 400th
anniversary of the birth of the FLEMISH artist Sir Anthony VAN DYCK,
nine of whose paintings hang in the INIGO JONES designed property.

They are at present on display at Wilton House as part of the VAN DYCK
exhibition. VAN DYCK, who was born 400 years ago this year, was
court painter to Charles I who recommended him to the fourth earl.

In his designs for Wilton, INIGO JONES created what is known as
the DOUBLE CUBE room-a room 60ft long by 30ft high and 30ft wide
- around the huge VAN DYCK canvases.&gt;&gt;

The Cambridge History of The Origins of English Drama
The Normans and their Minstrels.

&lt;&lt;The Norman conquest brought into England many a French or Flemish
adventurer of lowly origin or doubtful past. Moreover, these very
Normans, who had been the hero-adventurers of the western world, who
were the combatant sons of the church, and some of whose most signal
successes were even now only in process of achievement, had begun to
enter into a phase of chivalry in which doughty deeds are done, and
difficult enterprises are carried on, with one eye to a crown of glory
and the other to material profit. Thus, the influence of the Norman
conquest upon English life, where it was something more than the
pressure exercised by overbearing masters, was by no means altogether
ennobling or elevating. The diversions, too, of what was now the ruling
class in England were so mixed in character that the very names of their
purveyors cannot be kept asunder with precision. The trouvères of
Normandy and northern France, &quot;inventors&quot; of romances about deeds of
prowess which they sang to their own accompaniment on harp or lute or
viol, were frequently called jongleurs (joculatores)-a term so
comprehensive that it may appropriately be translated by &quot;entertainers.&quot;
The third designation, ménestrels or minstrels, which became the
usual term in England, is, of course, only another form of the Latin
ministeriales, servants of the house, implying the attachment of those
who bore it to a particular household, whence, however, they might set
forth to exhibit their skill abroad. The fourth term, gestours (singers
of chansons de geste), whom Chaucer couples with &quot;minestrales&quot; as
telling tales

Of romaunces that ben reales
Of popes and of cardinales,
And eke of love-longing,

is, in its original significance, the exact equivalent of trouvères.&gt;&gt;
