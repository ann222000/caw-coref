Why the world needs Islam today

These are some of the distinct features of Islam, which make it
necessary for modern man to seek his salvation through this ideology:

First, it must be well understood that Islam is not a mere ideological
vision. It is a practical system of life that fully appreciates all
the genuine needs of humankind and tries to realize them.

Second, in trying to meet the genuine requirements of man, Islam
effects perfect balance between all areas of life and activity. It
starts with the individual maintaining a balance between the
requirements of body and soul, reason and spirit and in no case allows
one side to dominate the other. It does not suppress the human
instincts in order to make the soul ascend the higher planes, nor does
it allow man, in his efforts to fulfill his bodily desires, to stoop
down to the low level of animalism and hedonism. On the contrary, it
makes them both meet on a single higher plane, doing away with all the
internal psychological conflicts that threaten the human soul or set a
part of it against the other parts.

In the social sphere, it proceeds to achieve equilibrium between the
needs of the individual and those of the community. It does not allow
an individual to transgress against other individuals, or against the
community. Nor does it allow the community to commit transgression
against individuals. It also does not approve of one class or group of
people to enslave another class or group of people. Islam exercises a
beneficent constraint on all these mutually opposed forces, prevents
them from coming into collision with one another, and harnesses them
all to co-operate for the general good of humankind as a whole.

Thus, Islam strikes a balance between different sectors of society and
between different aspects of existence, spiritual as well as material.
Unlike Communism, it does not believe that economic factors, i.e. the
material aspect alone, dominate human existence. Nor does it
contribute to what the pure spiritualists or idealists say, claiming
that spiritual factors or high ideals alone are sufficient to organize
human life. Rather, Islam holds that all these diverse elements put
together, form what is called human society; and that the best code of
life is that which takes note of all these, making full allowance for
body as well as reason and spirit, arranging them all in the framework
of a harmonious whole.

Third, it must always be kept in mind that Islam has an altogether
independent existence of its own as a social philosophy and an
economic system. Some of its outward manifestations may on the surface
appear to resemble those of Capitalism or Socialism, but in fact, it
is far from being the one or the other. It retains all the good
characteristics of these systems, yet is free from their shortcomings
and perversions. It does not extol individualism to that loathful
extent which is the characteristic of the modern West. It was from
this germ that modern Capitalism sprang and institutionalized that
concept of individual freedom, where man is allowed to exploit other
individuals and the community only to serve his personal gain. Islam
guarantees personal freedom and provides opportunities for individual
enterprise, but not at the cost of society or ideals of social
justice.

The reaction to Capitalism has appeared in the form of Socialism. It
idolizes the social basis to an extent that the individual is reduced
to an insignificant part of the social machine with no existence of
his own. Therefore, the community alone enjoys freedom as well as
power, the individual has no right to question its authority or demand
his rights. The tragedy of Socialism and its variants is that they
assign to the State absolute powers to shape the lives of the
individuals.

Islam strikes a balance between the two extremes of Capitalism and
Socialism. Being appreciative of their role, Islam harmonizes the
individuals and the State in such a way that individuals have the
freedom necessary to develop their potentialities and not to encroach
upon the rights of their fellowmen. It also gives the community and
the State adequate powers to regulate and control the socio-economic
relationships to guard and maintain this harmony in human life. The
basis of this whole structure as visualized by Islam is the
reciprocity of love between individuals and groups; it is not erected
on the basis of hatred and class conflict, as is the case with
Socialism.

It may also be pointed out here that this unique system of life as
visualized by Islam, did not originate as a result of any economic
pressure, nor was it an outcome of some mutually conflicting interests
of antagonistic groups of people. It was revealed to the world as the
ordained system of life, at a time when men attached no particular
importance to economic factors, nor did they know anything about
social justice in the sense we know it in modern times. Both Socialism
and Capitalism are much later developments. Islam presented its scheme
of social reform much before any of the social movements of our times.
It guaranteed the basic needs of man - food, housing and sexual
satisfaction - more than 1400 years ago. The Noble Prophet , said:
'Whosoever acts as a public officer for us (i.e. the Islamic State)
and has no wife, he shall have a wife; if he has no house, he shall be
given a house to live in; if he has no servant, he shall have one; and
if he has no animal (a conveyance), he shall be provided with one.
Anyone who takes more than this has exaggerated (i.e. taken more than
he deserves).' [Ahmad]

This historical announcement of fundamental human rights not only
contains those rights voiced by many a revolutionary in our times, it
adds to them some more as well, without necessitating any inter-class
hatred, bloody revolutions, and without rejecting all those human
elements in life that do not fall under the above three heads: food,
housing and family.

These are some of the salient features of the Islamic code of life.
They are sufficient to show that a religion with such laws and
principles, that is comprehensive and includes the complete human
existence, emotions, thoughts, actions, worship, economic dealings,
social relationships, instructive urges and spiritual aspirations -
all arranged in the framework of a single harmonious but unique system
of life, can never lose its usefulness for mankind. Nor can such a
religion ever become obsolete, as its objectives are the same as those
of life itself and therefore, destined to live on so long as there is
life on this planet.

Considering the existing state of affairs in the contemporary world,
humankind cannot reasonably afford to turn its back upon Islam or
reject its system of life. Humankind is still afflicted with the most
savage and odious forms of racial prejudices. Surely, the world in the
twentieth century has yet a great deal to learn from Islam. Long ago,
Islam freed humanity from all racial prejudices. It did not content
itself with the presentation of a beautiful vision of equality alone,
but it achieved in practice an unprecedented state of equality between
all people, black, white or yellow, declaring that none enjoyed any
superiority over the others except in virtue and piety.

It not only freed the black from slavery, but also fully recognized
their rights to aspire even to the highest seat of authority in the
Islamic State. They could become the heads of the Islamic State. The
Prophet , said: 'Listen and obey even if a black slave be appointed as
your superior, so long as he should enforce amongst you the Law of
Allaah (God).'

How can also the world of today ignore the message of Islam, stricken
as it is with the evils of imperialism and tyranny with all their
barbarous attributes? Islam alone can help humankind shake off these
chains. It is opposed to imperialism and all forms of exploitation.
The way Islam treated the people of the countries it conquered was so
generous, just and sublime that the eyes of 'civilized' Europe can
hardly penetrate those heights. We may in this regard cite the famous
decision of the Caliph 'Umar   to whip the son of 'Amr bin Al-'Aas,
the victorious general and honored governor of Egypt, as he had beaten
an Egyptian Copt without any legal justification. This shows the
social liberty and human rights that were enjoyed by the subjects of
the Islamic State.

Then there is the evil of Capitalism that has poisoned all life. Its
abolition and the need to rid humanity of its evil consequences again
call for Islam.

Fourth, Islam prohibits usury and hoarding which, taken together, form
the mainstay of the Capitalist economy. This, in other words, means
that Islam alone can effectively check the evils of Capitalism as it
did check them 1400 years ago.

Finally, the world with the shadows of war still hanging over it
cannot but turn towards Islam - the only way to establish and maintain
real peace on this earth. The era of Islam has in a way just started,
not ended; it is not a spent force, but a living dynamic force, its
future is as bright as its great historical past is glorious, when it
illumined the face of earth at a time when Europe was still groping
its way in the dark recesses of Medievalism.

How many moderate Muslims gave money to victims of Islamic terrorism?
Exactly the same number of moderate Nazis gave money to victims of
Holocaust. When American Muslim named Kamal Nawash tried to organize
anti-terrorism rally in Washington, DC., Islamic organizations
condemned the rally. About 50 people showed up, mostly Jews and
Christians. Arabic proverb says &quot;first comes Saturday, then Sunday.&quot;
It means that Arabs are going to exterminate Jews before they
exterminate Christians. It also means that Israel is the first line of
defense against Islam. Our media, our politicians, and our
universities are terrorized by Muslim immigrants and corrupted by
Saudi petrodollars. The terrorists have not corrupted Islam, Islam has
corrupted them. Islam is Arabic imperialism disguised as a religion.
It must be eradicated to prevent another world war.

The most famous recent convert from Islam to Christianity is Dr.
Muhammed Rahoumy. He was the Dean of Al Azhar Islamic University in
Egypt - the oldest and most prestigious Islamic school of theology in
the world. Rahoumy (now Samuel Paul) left Islam in 2000, and now lives
in the USA.

THE ORIGIN OF ISLAM (sources: http://www.historyofjihad.org/
http://www.islam-watch.org/AnwarSheikh/JihadandCivilization1.htm
http://www.islam-watch.org/Others/Allah-and-Eurabia.htm with minor
edits)

The birthplace of Islam, Arabia was afflicted with a harsh environment
unsuitable for agriculture. Bedouins inhabited this harsh environment.
They were wandering in search of pastures and supplemented their
meager livelihood with brigandage, which meant raiding other tribes
and commercial caravans. Though it was sheer looting, it assured them
solace, security and survival, and, therefore, it was not looked down
upon as sinful but a source of power, pleasure and prestige. This
institution of brigandage known as ghazwa (razzia) had existed long
before the advent of prophet Muhammad, the greatest Arab national
hero. The Umayyad poet al-Qutami has alluded to this custom in his two
verses: &quot;Our business is to make raids on the enemy, on our neighbor
and on our own brother, in case we find none to raid but a brother.&quot;
Brigandage was a compulsive trait of the Arab national character and
this is the reason that it was not considered an act of impiety but a
mark of honor and manliness.

The chief deity of pre-Islamic Mecca was the moon-god called Hubal or
al-ilah (god), which was shortened to Allah in pre-Islamic times.
Mohammed dropped the name Hubal but retained the generic Allah. Pre-
Islamic Arabs worshipped the moon-god by bowing in prayer toward Mecca
several times a day. They also made pilgrimages to Mecca, walked
around the Kaaba seven times and threw stones at the devil. And they
fasted for one month, which began with the appearance of the crescent
moon and ended when the crescent moon reappeared. These same rites
form the core of Islam today: Muslims bow in prayer toward Mecca, make
pilgrimages to Mecca, walk around the Kaaba seven times, and they
still throw stones at the devil. They also observe the fast of
Ramadan, which begins and ends with the crescent moon.

The word Islam is not derived from the word &quot;Salam&quot; which means peace,
but from the word &quot;al-silm&quot; which means submission or surrender. The
Kaaba is actually a meteorite which fascinated the ancient tribal
Arabs who were awe-struck by its flaming rush from the skies before it
landed in Mecca.

Mohammed (yimach shmo ve-zichro - may his name and memory be
obliterated) was a murderer, a pedophile and a scoundrel of the worst
kind. Epileptic fits created hallucinations that a god was talking to
him. His first converts were his wife Khadija, his slave Zaid, and
hardened criminals who wanted to loot a harried and defeated enemy.
Having lost his father, the posthumous orphan Mohammed wanted to
perpetuate his father's memory. His father's name Abdallah was derived
from Abd-Allah which translates as &quot;Slave of Allah.&quot; This is the
reason why Mohammed chose Allah among the many pre-Islamic Arab
deities to be the only deity to be worshipped by the Muslims.

After normal marriage with Khadija, he started his spree of marriages
with his marriage of Aisha who was the daughter of his follower Abu
Bakr. Aisha was just seven years old when Mohammed married her and she
was only nine years old when he consumed this marriage! This is the
inspiration for the Arabs of today to pick up child brides.

Realizing the significance of brigandage, Mohammed converted this
institution into a religious doctrine called jihad i.e., the holy War
against the infidels. At his core, Mohammed was nothing more than a
power grabber, who slyly used religion to promote himself. And the
people of Mecca as well as those of Medina saw through that. Some
inhabitants of Medina supported him because he attempted to organize
their struggle against the Jews and the Quraish tribe of Mecca.
Mohammed drilled into his followers the fantasy that if they died in a
jihad, they would reach heaven (Jann'at) where they would be served by
72 virgins (Houris) and by pearly eyed boys for the perverts among his
followers.

Two communities lived in Medina (Yathrib): the pagan, polytheistic
Arabs and the Jews. They were often on the warpath. The Arabs were
more numerous, but the Jews by virtue of being traders were more
prosperous and better organized, they also had built fortresses within
and around Medina to defend themselves during their internecine fights
with the pre-Islamic Arab tribes around Yathrib (Medina). The Jews
were usually victorious in the battles against the Arabs. The Arabs of
Medina decided to outwit the Jews by becoming Mohammed's followers and
seek his help in defeating the Jews. This is why the Arabs of Medina
(Yathrib) welcomed Mohammed, in whom they saw an opportunity to break
the trade monopoly of the Jews and also to defeat their other rivals,
the Meccans.

Islam was conceived as a political ploy of Arabs living in Medina
against Jews and Mecca, and it was marketed by Mohammed to his first
converts in Medina as a political alliance rather than as a lofty
religion. Mohammed organized them to take his first revenge on the
Meccans, and he started regularly raiding the caravans of the Meccans
that passed by Medina. He organized 64 such raids from 622 to 630, of
which he personally led 27 raids. These raids were called Ghazawats or
Razzias. The Meccans finally got fed up with Mohammed's antics and
attacked him in Medina. This led to the first major battle in
Mohammed's life - the battle of Badr. The Meccan army was led by Abu
Jahal. In this battle, he realized that the far stronger Meccan army
could only be defeated by guile. He ordered all the water springs
outside Medina to be sanded-up, so that the attacking Meccans would be
without any water. This was a legitimate tactic in war, but a true
messenger of god would not destroy water supply of his own clan. The
Meccans decided to outwit Mohammed and attack Medina during a
cloudburst, to obviate the need for water. But the heavily armored
Meccan army got trapped in the slushy sands outside Medina and they
were in disarray with camels falling over each other in total
disorder. They were defeated by the infantry charges of the Mohammed
's rag-tag, but highly motivated gang.

Many of Mohammed's followers pretended to leave Islam before they
settled in Mecca, thus becoming the fifth column during the eventual
invasion of Mecca that took place in 8 A.H. (630 C.E.). The Hudna
(temporary peace treaty) with the Meccans demonstrates the evil genius
of Mohammed. This evil genius is shared by all Muslims, who trick non-
Muslims in day-to-day life in a practice popularly known among the
Muslims as Taquiyya (also spelt as Taqiyya or Taqiya) which means
deception. Pervez Musharraf (the President of Pakistan) referred to
the Hudna when he announced after 9/11 that he was making a pact with
America to fight the Taliban.

With every Muslim military victory, there was not just a change of
ruler, but a wholesale slaughter of those who refused to convert or
pay Jaziya. There was also a total destruction of the pre-Islamic
culture, its educational institutions, libraries, etc.

One of the cardinal principles of Islam is that when a Muslim commits
heinous deeds in order to bring victory to Muslims waging a Jihad
against the Non-Muslims (Kafirs), Islamic law forgives those deeds.
Mohammed preached contempt for all the non-Muslims and told his
gangsters that the non-Muslims were living in ignorance (Jahiliyaa)
and that he would lead his followers to enlightenment (Ailm or ilm).
This enlightenment forgave all acts of rape, murder, torture, as long
as they were committed against the non-Muslims (Kafirs).

Muslims respect only strength and cruelty. They treat magnanimity,
charity and noblesse with contempt. The ritual of emulating Mohammed
in everything is called the Sunnat (or Sunnah). Muslim males emulate
him in doing everything he did like drinking camel
