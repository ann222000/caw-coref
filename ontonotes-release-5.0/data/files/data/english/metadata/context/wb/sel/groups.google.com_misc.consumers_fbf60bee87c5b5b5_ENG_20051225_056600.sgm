Well folks,

It seems that crazy inbred Dupont family is trying to
destroy America again (perhaps the last time was when
they backed an attempted fascist coup here
in the USA in the 1930's, if you'll recall).

This time, it seems they want to poison all of us
by putting junk food in contact with Teflon, which
deposits a certain carcinogen onto the food that stays
in our bodies indefinitely. They've known for decades
that it causes cancer and they know that it's in
97% of Americans' bodies.

This is what we get for letting big business
run our political system.
Enjoy-

Big business has always run our political system. They're no more
brazen now than they used to be (Chinese slaves built many of our
railroads, after all).

Remember though it's the UAW and Michigan Democrats who are the most
opposed to raising mileage standards.

I agree about the political issue of big business, but you're wrong
about Teflon. It is so safe and inert that it is routinely used in
surgical implants.

If you want big bad capitalist targets, try the real estate developers
or the oil companies.-Jitney

"/> That article doesn't mention what was mentioned in a previous article at the
site -- that the study involved DuPont workers, not the general public. A 10%
increase in cholesterol levels was also mentioned.

Perhaps there ARE studies showing the dangers of teflon to the general
population, but I saw nothing at the web site that convinced me. Once you
read one misleading article, it opens anything else there up to question,
which means there's no point in reading it.

"/> This sounds like a highly distorted version of the news that Dupont
was fined for polluting with a chemical that's used in Teflon
*manufacturing.* It doesn't leach out of Teflon-coated surfaces, nor
does the article say that it does, though the article is bad enough.
You can't even quote it right. Typical.
