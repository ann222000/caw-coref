what I might use to paint the Croc's...that won't fade,
crack..withstand the elements( water, etc.) and stay bright??? any

Have you tried alcohol inks?  Pinata, or Tim Holtz' Ranger inks?
Might work.

What about FLOAM?  It comes in a bunch of neon colors.  It's sold with
kids' craft stuff.  You can get it at Wal-Mart, Michael's, etc.
http://www.asseenontv.com/prod-pages/floam.html
You can use it to "paint" objects.  Let it dry and cover with lacquer
or varnish to waterproof it.  You can paint over it, too.

Are you going to wear these after they're painted?  I don't really
know of any paint that will flex enough to hold up to the flip-flops
being worn without cracking.

Yes, Michaels and AC Moore have the Tim Holtz' inks... in the rubber
stamping department. There are also Pantone inks, but I think you
might have to go to an Art supply store. Also, how about the inks that
they sell in the calligraphy dep't?
I know that the alcohol inks attach themselves well to plastics...
they dry almost immediately.
Pinata inks might be an on-line purchase, but at least you can try the
Ranger inks; and... use a 40 % coupon!
I have used them on glass, plastic, paper, and my hands. Always use
rubber gloves with them... they will re-do a manicure!
