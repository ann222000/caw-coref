Yellow had said:

&quot; Isn't it time the group, as a whole, stopped feeding these people?
What does everyone think? Should we just freeze them out?&quot;

I think Yellow has a good idea, as a group we need to stop replying to
people who only bring up stuff that has nothing to do with the books (such
as the pedophile issue)...  As they say, if you don't feed the trolls they
will stop visiting...

&gt; Considering that Yellow and I are having a nice little off-topic
&gt; discussion about the European Union's constitution, lack thereof, I'd
&gt; say that this is the pot calling the kettle black.

Nothing wrong with off-topic conversations, that's what makes us a
community.  It allows us to see other dimensions of each other.  But,
trolls only have one dimension..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't see most of the trolling in the group because it's generally
&gt; crossposted to troll groups and my filters weed those out.  As for the
&gt; other stuff when a topic is not of interest to me I'll put up a
&gt; temporary filter on the subject and by the time this expires the
&gt; thread has died naturally.
">

Yeah, that work.  In an unmoderated group, trolling is to be expected,
as is side conversations on topics that might not be of interest to
everyone.  Anyone who is into Usenet, should either get used to it or
learn to tune or filter it out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;However, note that between the release of
&gt; Deathly Hollows and Jo's &quot;Dumbledore is Gay!&quot; announcement posting
&gt; declined exponentially so really that's the only thing keeping this
&gt; group going.  Like it or not *because* Rowling chose to out him it's a
&gt; topic of interest to some people.  To others it's not and, yeah, if it
&gt; bothers you seeing the threads just put up a subject filter on &quot;gay&quot;
&gt; and &quot;pedophile&quot; and that should weed out most of the dross.
">

The problem with this topic is that it IS on topic.  Rowling brought
up the gay issue explicity at CH, and the pediaphilia with only a
little subtlety in DH.  Anyone who pays attention knows that just
because Rita says it, it isn't necessarily true.  And, Rita was
clearly hinting at pediaphilia, not homosexuality.  But, then Rita
wouldn't mind intentionally confusing the 2 to sell books.  I do
believe her alter ego is the one who keeps posting about some silly
study that doesn't meet even minimal standards for useful research.
How does she expect a small population of incarcerated child molesters
to speak for gays?  She must prove that they are the same group before
such claims can be believable.

Another fair question is why did Rowling do this?  To sell books?
Isn't she rich enough?  Or does she have a statement to make, or
desire discussion of the topic?  If so, she needs to remember that
celebrities that make public statements outside of their area of
proven expertise tend to look silly.

Or maybe she's just a troll.  LOL, maybe I should just look over some
of this header information and see were these posts are coming from.

One can only hope -- and I quite agree trying to reason with them only
encourages them -- but we are dealing with an unusually viscous kind
of troll here, and I suspect they'll prove to be as persistent as they
are viscous.

Stupid spell checker!!  I meant vicious, obviously.  Although come to
think of it, they are quite thick, so maybe my spell checker was on to
something and viscous is actually a pretty good word for them.

I have not even watched Sid and Nancy :/ *

But many friends of my same age are quite fans. They were one day
talking about him, and they could have talked Japanese and it had been
the same.

* This made me remember a local TV Spot, a guy is wearing a Che Guevara
T-shirt which start to asking him why he uses his face if he doesn't
even know who he really was or what had he done. At the end, he asks
&quot;You've not even watched &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries?&quot;

I don´t mind off topic discussions - they can be very interesting
here, but I agree on those stupid racistical comments. For those I
have decided to ignore them some time ago. I got agressive at first
when I read those incredible posts but was told not to answer and I
think it is the best thing to do.
