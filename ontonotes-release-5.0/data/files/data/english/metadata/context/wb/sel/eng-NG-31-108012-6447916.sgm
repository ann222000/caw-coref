A few times a year, Carin's family gets together for lunch/dinner at
some or other holiday.  Usually, they ask me to bring my toffee, and
I oblige. I will probably take toffee this year because they asked,
but I'm getting bored with toffee, and I'm hoping to start
developing some other yummies to take to these things. I don't
usually do many desserts, but I'll start trying stuff.

Anyone have ideas for Spring desserts?  They should meet the
following criteria:

1) Will travel well for an hour and require minimal prep once I get
there (one time, I took sticky pudding that needed the sauce warmed
up, and I had to elbow my way into the line for the stove/microwave).

2) Will fit in well with a traditionalish Easter dinner -- there
will be ham, waldorf salad, green beans, appetizers, mashed
potatoes, etc.

3) Is mega yummy, so I can start having some other dish that people
ask me to bring that's not toffee. :-)

How about strawberry shortcakes? Bake some nice biscuits for them-
much better than Mary anns!  Everything can be done ahead(except for
fresh whipped cream).

Stop near the destination at any stupid market and buy enough Lemon Sorbet (
easily available), fresh mint and any fresh or frozen berries. Top  each sorbet
with berries and a sprig of mint ( add a cookie if you want)

1. Cheesecake, plain, with a few fruit purees for a choice of toppings.

2. Angelfood cake with a tunnel hollowed out, filled with strawberries
in whipped cream.  (Cut an inch off the top, hollow out some of the
bottom, fill and replace top. Dust with powdered sugar or frost with
more whipped cream.)

3. Tiramisu or zuppa anglais

4. Cream puffs

We seldom eat dessert these days, but when we do, they are worth the

What about a key-lime pie?  Or, I sort of agree with Dimitri regarding
something berry-ish.  Strawberries are in season and blueberries are coming
into season.  Oh, how about one of those fruit tarte-like thingy's that's
custard underneat, fruit on top, with a glaze!  It's not only an eye-popper,
but all the fruit for it should be in season!

We used to make those in the 70's, with a sugar-cookie-dough crust or a
one-layer yellow cake baked in a fluted pan.  The crust was topped with
either custard or vanilla pudding, seasonal fruit, and a glaze of melted
currant or apple jelly.

They were beautiful and quite popular.  Haven't thought of them in years.

Lemon Chiffon cake - easy to make ahead; easy traveling; no prep
necessary on site.  It will be light yellow in color, like Easter-y
and spring-like.  Garnish with (non-edible) lilacs, hyacinths, or
edible sugared African violets and nasturtiums.

Here's one recipe from Martha Stewart, who has never failed me:

Serving: Makes 1 seven-inch cake

* 3/4 Cup cake flour, (not self-rising)
* 1/4 Teaspoon baking soda
* 1/4 Teaspoon salt
* 3/4 Cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar
* 3 large eggs, separated
* 1/4 Cup vegetable oil
* 1 Tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice
* 2 Tablespoons grated lemon zest, (about 4 lemons)
* 1/2 Teaspoon pure vanilla extract
* 1/4 Teaspoon cream of tartar
* Confectioners' sugar, for dusting

Directions

1. Heat oven to 325 degrees;, and have ready an ungreased 7-inch
tube pan. In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, salt,
and 3/4 cup granulated sugar; set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together egg yolks, vegetable oil, 1/3
cup water, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla. Add reserved dry
ingredients, and beat until smooth.
3. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg whites on medium
speed until foamy. Add cream of tartar; beat on high speed until soft
peaks form, about 1 minute. Gradually add remaining tablespoon of
granulated sugar; beat on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 2
minutes.
4. Gradually fold egg-white mixture into the batter; start by
folding in one-third, then fold in the remaining two-thirds. Pour
batter into pan. Using an offset spatula, smooth the top. Bake until a
cake tester inserted in the middle comes out clean and the cake is
golden, about 45 minutes.
5. Remove cake from oven; invert the pan over a glass soda bottle
for 2 hours to cool. Turn cake right-side up. Run a table knife all
the way down between cake and pan; invert again, and remove cake. Dust
cake with confectioners' sugar before serving.

********

I believe Better Homes &amp; Gardens has a lemon chiffon layer cake
recipe, but I don't have it here.  It's very good.

I think they are the result of branching out from that Philly cream
cheese/cherry pie filling type "pizza" dessert that was so popular
back in the day.

Is refrigerator space an issue? I'd say a big bowl of lemon mousse swirled
with tart raspberry sauce if not. Or lemon curd tartlets made with homemade
lemon curd.

If it is a problem, a fruit tart of some sort, such as fresh apricot or
pear/almond, is always nice. Or something lemon that doesn't need
refrigerating, like [good] lemon bars.

For Easter dinner, we're making the Peeps pie - it was so cute last
year! Not sure what color/flavor, but that's a sure thing for Easter
from now on.

Otherwise....how about barb's rhubarb custard cake? Or any type of
cake travels well - I really like the lemon-blueberry pound cake from
Moosewood (the orignial). Or an apple cake.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I oblige. I will probably take toffee this year because they asked,
&gt;&gt;&gt; but I'm getting bored with toffee, and I'm hoping to start
&gt;&gt;&gt; developing some other yummies to take to these things. I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; usually do many desserts, but I'll start trying stuff.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Anyone have ideas for Spring desserts?  They should meet the
&gt;&gt;&gt; following criteria:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1) Will travel well for an hour and require minimal prep once I get
&gt;&gt;&gt; there (one time, I took sticky pudding that needed the sauce warmed
&gt;&gt;&gt; up, and I had to elbow my way into the line for the
&gt;&gt;&gt; stove/microwave).

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2) Will fit in well with a traditionalish Easter dinner -- there
&gt;&gt;&gt; will be ham, waldorf salad, green beans, appetizers, mashed
&gt;&gt;&gt; potatoes, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) Is mega yummy, so I can start having some other dish that people

&gt;&gt; Individual strawberry shortcakes?  Can be easily assembled once you
&gt;&gt; arrive and I don't think cooking is required.

&gt; grilled fresh pineapple slices basted in a rum&amp;butter&amp;brown sugar
&gt; sauce (equal ratio of sugar and butter with rum to taste.). Grill and
&gt; baste frequently the pineapple...put in tupperware with any left over
&gt; basting liquid as finishing sauce...take to party

Oooooooh, that would be a good idea.    Maybe to toss on top of a slice of
angel food cake?

I think this might fit into your criteria. If not I hope you try it
sometime. It's a great spring, summer dish.

I saw lots of good *yummy* suggestions.... but cheese cake and
angelfood cake with strawberries are at the top of my list.  However,
instead of whole strawberries with that angel food cake, cut them up
at home and let macerate in sugar to create a sauce.  Bring your
berries to the party in a covered bowl (put them in the refrigerator
until dessert is on), open at serving time.

Nobody has mentioned chocolate decadence yet, so let me put in a plug
for that.  I'm sure you've got a recipe for it somewhere.  If not, try

I'd go with a strawberry tart. Make a tart shell using a pate sucree recipe
which contains cream cheese. (I have such a recipe at home, if Google
doesn't turn one up.) In a mixer, whip cream cheese with sugar until
thoroughly broken down, then add cream and whip until light and a bit
fluffy. Spoon mixture into tart shell and level off. Cut the tops off
strawberries and put them into the cheese mixture cut-side-down. To achieve
good coverage, it might be necessary to further halve or quarter some of the
strawberries.

You can glaze the tart, but it's not necessary.
