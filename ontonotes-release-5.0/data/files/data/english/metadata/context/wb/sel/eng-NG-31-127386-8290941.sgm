&gt; Um, no.. Never sent anyone an e-mail.

&gt;&gt;So, &quot;Alien Hero&quot; you got nothing better to do than sit in newsgroups
&gt;&gt;sending UFO researchers emails containg words like &quot;you are nuts&quot;.
&gt;&gt; etc, etc.

&gt; UFO researchers. LOL

Yes. It turns out that if you wait long enough these so-called
ufo researchers are likely to come out as being gay...Or worse.

For many years now it has been my unpleasant job to ferret out
these weirdoes, whiners, wannabes and cocksuckers.

I'd like to see a double blind study done on the correlation between
ufo belief and homosexuality. I'd say it's near 100%.

Drug usage is also prevalent among this group as is a belief in
god and other new age bullshit.

My sentiments eXactly....

He instills gays in all of his 'messages'.....

(I think he must be a 'repressive' fag.)

Nobody mentions the 1991 Mexico City flap. For Christ Jesus' sake, it
went on for two years....

He asked. I said okay, and took the position. He tried. I said, &quot;No.
I don't like this.&quot;

Why don't you talk about the markings.....?

What about the one I put up....?

Or Ishmael coming straight from the Torah......

Or the fact that intelligence in a new born comes from the gene of
a parent.....

We can talk about the ramification of such truths.....

You CANNOT deny wild ass suichomicidal Muslims eXist, and

Howdy HVAC.
It's always great to see your posts in newsgroups.

My winking smiley = it's eternal strange OUT THERE
judging by the size of the Universe...

P.S.
I saw a couple of interesting movies recently.
Will share info about them in some other post.
