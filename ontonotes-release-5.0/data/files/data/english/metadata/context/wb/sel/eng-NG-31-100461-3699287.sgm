Potential problems with the numbers in the following stories: Stephen
Worth has said the strongest ratings were on the reruns... altho you'd
think that would be mentioned in these things, especially if they were
the highest ratings TNN ever had (as has been claimed).

TNN's Animated 'Strip' Delivers
By Brian Ford Sullivan

CHICAGO (thefutoncritic.com) -- TNN's legal battles didn't stop its new
animated block from delivering last week as the network's combination of
"Ren &amp; Stimpy," "Gary the Rat" and "Stripperella" averaged 1.4 million
viewers on Thursday night.

More importantly the self-titled "first network for men" delivered in
its target demographic, outperforming prior-year levels in its time
period by 61% among total viewers, 83% in men 18-49 (1.1 rating/575,000
viewers) and 200% in men 18-34 (1.5 rating/390,000 viewers). Overall the
block was number one among basic cable for the night among men 18-34 and
men 18-49, second only to ESPN's NBA draft coverage.

TNN's big winner for the night was "Stripperella," starring Pamela
Anderson, at 11:00/10:00c which racked up a 1.7 household rating and 2
million total viewers. Those numbers were up a whopping 155% in
year-to-year comparisons among total viewers for TNN, 150% in men 18-49
(1.5 rating/795,000 viewers) and 250% in men 18-34 (2.1 rating/535,000
viewers).

"Ren &amp; Stimpy's Adult Party Cartoon" held its own at 10:00/9:00c,
averaging a 1.1 household rating and 1.4 million total viewers. That's
up 51% from TNN's viewership last year as well as up 100% in men 18-49
(1.0 rating/531,000 viewers) and 225% in men 18-34 (1.3 rating/324,000
viewers).

At 10:30/9:30c, the debut of "Gary the Rat" also performed well,
notching a 1.1 household rating and 1.3 million total viewers, up 34%
from the network's numbers last year. "Gary" was also up 57% among men
18-49 (1.1 rating/548,000 viewers) and 133% among men 18-34 (1.4
rating/358,000 viewers).

Rounding out the night was a classic episode of "The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show"
at 11:30/10:00c which averaged 898,000 total viewers, up 12% in
year-to-year comparisons. The classic "Ren" was also up 33% among men
18-49 (0.8 rating/405,000 viewers) and 117% among men 18-34 (1.3
rating/327,000 viewers)."

Cable Originals Off and Running in July
By Brian Ford Sullivan
...
TNN: Interestingly enough, the soon to be rebranded "first network for
men" was down 6% in primetime and 4% overall in its targeted men 18-34
demographic when compared to a year ago. Even its much-hyped "The Strip"
animation block has slid considerably, down 30% overall from its bow on
June 26. "Stripperella" nevertheless remains the big draw of the
two-hour block where it has averaged a little more than 1 million
viewers after four airings despite premiering to twice that. Fellow
"Strip" entries "Gary the Rat" and "Ren &amp; Stimpy" have fared far worse
as neither reached the top 50 in adults 18-34 in the past two weeks,
despite setting network records in the demo for their respective bows.

"Stripperella /Gary The Rat Hit Big With Male Audience
Written By Ben Johnson On 07.01.03
Many originally questioned how well the "First Network For Men" would do
considering it was based around three cartoons.  However, they did quite
well in their debut last week.
Stripperella led the pack with a 2 million viewers.  That's just
slightly less than half of what WWE RAW has been doing on the same
network lately.
Gary The Rat , the 10:30 PM show featuring the voice of Kelsey Grammer,
was watched by 1.4 million .  Ren &amp; Stimpy, which led the night off at
10:00 PM earned 1.3 million.  They showed an episode of the original Ren
&amp; Stimpy show at 11:30 PM, viewed by 900,000. "

TNN's toon preems drive ratings spike
'Stripperella' averaged 2 mil total viewers

By JOHN DEMPSEY

NEW YORK -- Spike shmike.

TNN's court battle with Spike Lee to secure the right to change its name
to Spike hasn't damaged the network's highly touted late-primetime
animation block, which premiered June 26 to solid Nielsens.

The big winner was the half-hour "Stripperella, Starring Pamela
Anderson" at 11 p.m., which averaged 2 million total viewers, an
eye-popping 155% more than the net garnered last year in the time
period. The entire block (10p.m.-midnight) outperformed the two-hour
timeslot last year on TNN by 61%.

At 10, "Ren &amp; Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon" averaged 1.4 million total
viewers (up 51% on last year). Show also won big in TNN's target
demographics, pulling in 531,000 men 18-49 and 324,000 men 18-34, in
both cases triple-digit gains over last year.

At 10:30 "Gary the Rat," featuring the voice of Kelsey Grammer ,
averaged 1.3 million total viewers (up 34%), 548,000 men 18-49 (up 57%)
and 358,000 men 18-34 (up 133%).

"Stripperella" augmented its gaudy total-viewers number with 795,000 men
18-49 (up 150%) and 535,000 men 18-34 (up 250%).

A rerun of the original "Ren &amp; Stimpy Show" at 11:30 averaged 898,000
total viewers, which broke out into 405,000 men 18-49 and 327,000 men
18-34.
