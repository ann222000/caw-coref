To my friends, family and all my relations,

Change comes around with the number seven (a friend told me) – it seems
to be true. I have written up six voyages of “Mike’s Week”; this would
be the seventh – but it won’t. The weeks from my last trip – the trip
where the Rainbow is arrested in Beirut for a month – were my last. They
are still posted on http://groups.google.com/group/Mikes-Week (as
testament to the “Mike’s Week” that will die). But that does not mean
that my writing comes to an end – writing is my knitting, my past time
at sea. What this does is free up a little more time for me to read and
to be a captain and to offer something more tasty to
http://mikemate.wordpress.com

But for Mom and Dad, and a few others who linger in the world of dial-up
here are the entries that I have written each day of this last week
(minus the photos taken with my cannon). The photos are on
http://mikemate.wordpress.com Not many, but one or two each week. There
may be a few oops and aarghs along the way as I figure out the best way
to do this from the sea with no link to land or to the internet except
via email posting.

There is a lot to do. There is no more time to waste. This voyage of the
Rainbow Warrior is IMPORTANT!

Another week comes to you,
With love and peace,
Mike

Monday 03 September

The plan was to sail today but we didn’t. We’re awaiting parts from
Germany – bolts for the exhaust manifolds of both engines.

My thoughts turn to my dead wife… she would have turned 40 today, but 30
is all she managed. That birthday, her 30th (her last), was spent with
me in Amsterdam on board the mv Greenpeace – an old salvage tug, now a
museum piece in Rotterdam. I have tick-tacked a photograph of Christine
onto the wooden paneling above my bunk. Feels like a reunion for me.
Next to the picture of her is one of my ‘house with no windows’.

Tuesday 04 September

The wind came up in the night. I awoke to it pinning the ship against
the quay, we were even bouncing a little as it cut across the beam. The
bolts for the exhaust manifold arrived during lunch hour and Tapio
(chief engineer from Finland) assisted by Bob (second engineer from the
Isle of Eigg) went straight to work.

I confirmed our departure with the pilot and at the same time requested
a tug – we pay for the service regardless. There are three reasons for a
tug today: It is difficult to get the Rainbow Warrior off the dock when
she is pinned down by a wind like this. There are ferries running past
every twenty minutes and – I joked to Slade as we waited for the pilot –
a good old tug will reduce my level of stress.

The tug, when it came, was as big as the Rainbow Warrior, the crew took
its rope and brought it through the fairlead, making it fast around the
bits forward of the bridge.

‘Let go everything’ I called forward and aft. The fifty year old 555 ton
steel ship leant over in the direction of the tug and was pulled bodily
off the quay.

Rainbow Warrior has slipped free from the bonds of Greece.

Wednesday 05 September

Rainbow Warrior has a fresh westerly wind filling her sails, blowing her
towards Cyprus. Today heaven has sent us through the Kikladhes islands
of the South Aegean Sea, their white rocky slopes reflecting the
sunshine. Boats are lowered to the water off Nisos Ios, and, whilst I
take the helm of the Rainbow all day, crew and mates have been have been
immersed in one of the seven days Greenpeace Standardized RHIB (Rigid
Hull Inflatable Boat) Training.

As the boats whiz up and down the side of the Rainbow Warrior I pace the
bridge, in my hand; a copy of the Greenpeace monthly report. From it I
read that in France, in La Rochelle, Greenpeace climbers have stopped
the unloading of a Safmarine cargo ship caught carrying timber from
forests of the Congo. Safmarine (South African Freight Marine Company)
is the shipping company in which I served ten years of commercial shipping.

It was on a Safmarine ship loading a 30 000 ton cargo of lumber in
Canada that I made contact with Greenpeace. That cargo was also destined
for France, for Sete. France is Europe’s biggest importer of wood from
old growth forests. And it seems that South African shipping company is
happy to carry it for them.

Thursday 06 September

Half way between Rodhos and Cyprus - a westerly gale fills the sails.
Captain Mike’s winter-white South African skin soaked in Mediterranean
sunshine. Crew launch and retrieve, come alongside, bear-off, hook on,
hook off, again and again. All day long they practice under his watchful
eye from bridge. Training: the vital element of safety at sea.

Friday 07 September
The Rainbow surfed to Cyprus. Through the night we topped speeds of 11
knots in a gale. Huge rollers traveled along the side of the ship
overtaking us. Rainbow was rolling through an arc of fifty degrees, and
yawing wildly on top of that. I stood the watch gripping the hand rails
and peering into the dark Mediterranean, on edge, quiet. It is a
dangerous sea that follows one for it can cause a boat to broach – go
broadside to the swell, roll over heavily and be swamped. The sails
helped us here; the wind was mightier than the sea and they kept our
heading true.
Occasional bangs came from within the ship. The drawers in the outboard
mechanics workshop burst open and tools where thrown to the deck. A
wooden box came away from its lashings in the hold and a tray of ripe
peaches took flight across the mess room - pulping themselves on the
opposite bulk head. And then Patricio, the Argentinean cook, came
running up to the bridge. ‘Captain! Captain!’ he called out at the top
of the stairs, his eyes not adjusted to the darkness on the bridge.
‘Captain. A wave came into my cabin.’
I left Mario my Brazilian lookout on the bridge then, just for a moment,
and ran below deck to have a look. Patricio's cabin was awash and the
electrical cord to his table lamp was floating in the water.

Saturday 08 September

The white horses arose from the sea; they became the white cliffs of
southern Cyprus. We made landfall off Paphos and then followed the coast
- passed the birthplace of Aphrodite - to Limassol, wind howling all the
way. The plan to continue boat training at anchor was thwarted by the
sea and so I called the harbour and asked if we could come inside.

They replied promptly, offering the Rainbow Warrior a berth. Would we be
happy to tie the ship up to a dolphin? They asked. And would we require
a pilot?

‘We will take the dolphin’ I answered, ‘but no, we do not require a pilot.’

The wind, despite being gale force, was from dead ahead - the right
direction - for putting the Rainbow alongside a dolphin. Plus: the
dolphin is perfect for launching boats from both sides of the ship, in
the shelter of the harbour. Little miracles happen every day (on the
road to Bali).

Sunday 09 September

Confronting the Royal Navy
Four boats leave Limassol harbour shortly after sunrise, driving in
formation, crew dressed for action - X4 orange boat suits - plotted
charts and hand-bearing compasses in each. They turn south bracing the
relentless westerly Beaufort force seven that cuts across Akrotiri Bay.

One would suppose these crew were navigating the coast of Cyprus: one
would be wrong. They have spent the night planning a passage that takes
them down the coast of the United Kingdom. The chart is marked (++++).
From Limassol to Cape Agata, the southern point of Akrotiri peninsula,
landing is prohibited. This part of the island is clearly not Cyprus,
it’s not Greek, not Turkish - it is the SOVEREIGN BASE AREA (UK).

An hour later there is a military police car with flashing lights pulled
up to the Rainbow Warrior and a soldier over dressed for the heat
wanting to speak to the captain. “You must contact your boats” he says
“they are navigating in the Sovereign base of the United Kingdom.”

What a fool’s paradigm I think, pause, but reply with a rather wet –
‘will do orifice-er’. He looks hot under the collar; he’s looking
through dark glasses for something he will not find here on the Rainbow.

War between little men is not high on my agenda, not today – not when
the bloody planet is getting hotter and hotter.
