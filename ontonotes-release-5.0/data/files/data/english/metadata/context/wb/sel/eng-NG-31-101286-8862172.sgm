Hello group - as some of you may know, I recently purchased what may be the last &quot;new&quot; Audicy available from a dealer (although the unit is undoubtably a year or more old).  It works fine except sometimes the warning &quot;DSP Effects System Problem&quot; comes up on the screen and the bank of DSP buttons will not work.  It says:
&quot;&quot;Your  patch bay effects system has a problem with some of the DSP processors installed.  This may be due to a faulty DSP board, or an initialization problem.  It may be possible to continue working on this production, but some effects processors will not be available to use.  You may try to clear this condition by quitting and restarting your system........&quot;

This normally comes up when I start a &quot;new&quot; project - but then when I come back and work on that &quot;same&quot; project again, it sometimes comes up again.

It seems if  I &quot;quit&quot; the project and then bring it right  back up, the DSP effects bank always then works fine.

So at this point this is simply an &quot;annoyance,&quot; - I don't know if the problem will eventually get worse or what.  My engineer friend reseated all the cards in the tower when the unit first arrived, so we have already done that.

Any one have any ideas - Dean, Miquel?  Thanks very much!

Pull the dsp board and send to Miguel for repair and eval. He can
repair for you if you prefer have someone troubleshoot there.

Pull all the cards make sure the MB is tight and reinstall and
reinstall the system disk #2 for the Audicy sw.
