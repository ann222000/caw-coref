Hey everyone!

Hello again at long last.  I hope you've all been doing well for the past few weeks.  Whether things have been fine for you or not, though, I will be quite happy to hear from you about whatever.

In the meantime, I'm writing a much briefer summary of the past few weeks than you might usually expect from me.  Quite frankly, I didn't have much time or interest in taking daily notes (what with instead having the rare pleasure of hanging out with all of the other volunteers from my training group), so I'm just going to use my copy of the schedule to give you anecdotal notes.  Feel free to ask any questions you might like.

&quot;A Pleasant Change of Pace&quot;

My Rong Nyoke and I started our trip to the training at 5:40 in the evening of July 1st.  Considering it was an 11 hour trip, we really didn't talk very much.  I came to the conclusion the the Rong Nyoke doesn't speak English quite as well as I thought.  This was confirmed later in the training when the two of us were discussing my six-month plan and had to enlist translation help from the ajons.  Oh well; that just means I'll have to work harder to learn Thai, since I can't rely on the Rong Nyoke to translate.

We arrived at Bangkok a little before 5 in the morning on Monday morning, not all that terribly well-rested.  We ran into another volunteer and her counterpart, and then joined them in waiting for another couple of volunteers who were supposed to arrive within a few minutes.  And while we were standing there, Melanie's counterpart mentioned that he was going to go straight on to the training site (rather than waiting for the Peace Corps bus in the afternoon), and my counterpart immediately decided to join him.  Then the other two volunteers arrived and THEIR counterparts instantly decided that going straight to the training location sounded like a smashing idea.

Apparently rural Thais don't like hanging out in Bangkok.

So we four volunteers were left to go to the Peace Corps office by ourselves.  Yet as much as it seems like that should be a simple thing to do, our taxi driver had a great many difficulties in understanding our target location.  We tried telling him the address, then we tried giving him a card with the address written in Thai, then I told him the name of the bridge that's half a block from the Peace Corps office.  Yet still, with all of that, he stopped for directions.  Even more annoyingly, he was getting these directions when we were less than two kilometers from the office, by which point we were already telling him (in Thai, mind you) &quot;just go up to the light and turn left,&quot; based on the signs we had seen for the bridge that we had already told him about.  Even so, we waited an extra five minutes so that some security guard who had never heard of Peace Corps could discuss the issue with his friends and then come back and say the same thing.

AS it happens, this was actually one of the better taxi ride experiences I heard about with regard to reaching the Peace Corps office.  Some friends later told me that they spent over two hours in a cab while making the attempt, and the driver actually tried delivering them to the US Embassy.

Hanging out at the office was relatively uneventful, though it made for a nice easing-in on catching up with the other volunteers again.  My party of four was just the second or third set to arrive, so we got to chat with others just as they trickled in instead of trying to hug and say hello to 30 people at the same time.

At 2 o'clock, we took a 3-hour bus ride to the training site, stopping halfway for reasons completely unclear to me.  Even if it were too long of a trip for folks to do without a rest stop, there was a perfectly useable bathroom on the bus and plenty of room to stand up and move around a little.  Mai bpen rai.

Our training event / counterpart conference was held at the Comsaed River Kwai Resort in Kanchanaburi Province.  We were about half an hour from the famous Bridge on the River Kwai, which most definitely was NOT blown up, no matter what Alec Guinness would have you believe.  The resort itself is right next to the river.

Honestly, there's not much to say about the bridge OR the resort.  Other than a few palm trees here and there, the overall look of the resort could have passed quite easily for a similar place in America.  I was rather reminded of the sort of sanitariums that particularly rich and harmless people are sent to in movies.

The bridge, likewise, is fairly unremarkable as far as its engineering and architecture go.  There's a war museum nearby, and several buildings full of markets, but there's not much to do right there if you're not filling inclined to purchase knick-knacks or bone up on history (because the history involved a lot of English soldiers, it actually tends to be a target spot for British tourists).  Still, some of the items on sale were fairly pretty, so I took pictures.

About a mile from the bridge, there's a whole slew of restaurants (bars, really) dedicated to serving partying farang tourists.  (The road in between is dull and dingy, which I note because it seems rather typical of the tourist experience in Thailand--some really interesting things scattered around, but with blocky gray architecture in between.)  My only visit to the area was at about noon, and most of the restaurants/pubs were frustratingly closed.  This rather killed all desire I might have had to return to the area.

So that's the basics of where we met.  Back to the counterpart conference and training....

The counterpart conference lasted for two and a half days, and mostly involved sessions on things that the volunteers covered back during our main training days in four to six months ago.  Most of us could appreciate the value of covering that material for our counterparts, but it was frustrating in that the volunteers were attending all of those sessions as well.  Combined with the fact that most of these review sessions were primarily conducted in Thai (with summarized translation for the volunteers), and I daresay it would have been more fun to visit a dentist who doesn't believe in anasthesia.

There were some good points, though.  My Rong Nyoke came to understand that I really need to start getting out into the community more, and he volunteered to talk with the Nyoke and Balat (my official supervisor and counterpart, respectively) about me coming to the AwBawTaw just three days per week.  He and I also created a fairly decent-seeming 6-month plan that gives me hope of being far more active in the days to come.  Only time will tell if this actually plays out, but I'm (very) cautiously optimistic for now.

Those of you keeping track of the calendar will note that our counterpart conference included the 4th of July.  In honor of the occasion, the resort made several &quot;American&quot; dishes (including pasta and kebabs), and we played with sparklers after dinner while a small group of volunteers led the singing of various patriotic songs (including something like 10 verses of &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot;--most of us stuck to chiming in on the chorus and clapping the beat in between).

July 4th was also noteable as being the day when we had our site fair, wherein everyone showed off their community maps and whatever assorted community products they managed to pack.  I spent a ridiculous amount of time in the four days beforehand working on making an interactive electronic map, so that folks could hover over a location and see its name (in Thai and English), then click the spot to see a picture.  I even added music in a couple of spots.

Why go to so much effort?  Well, in part it was just to get practice at a new program (which I had never used before June 30th), and in part it was to try and get some attention for my computer skills (not just from other Peace Corps folks, but actually from my counterpart as well), and in part it was because another volunteer bet me that she could make a better map and my only hope of competing (given that I can't draw) was to go high-tech.  I made a tactical error with the bet, I'm afraid, asking the Training Officer to judge between our maps when the very fact of mine going electronic bent the original assignment.

I realized afterwards that the site fair was pretty much the source of my stress in the past few e-mails that I've sent out.  More accurately, it involved homework that was a bit beyond me because the assignment required working with a counterpart to do things properly (and my AwBawTaw folks have been too busy).  After the fair was over, my general anxiety levels completely disappeared.

But then, that could also be a result of finally getting a proper night's sleep afterwards, since I was no longer staying up late to add whizbangs to my map.

The final thing we did with our counterparts was to write down (separately) three goals for after returning to site, and then compare those goals and create a final list.  As it turned out, my Rong Nyoke and I wrote almost exactly the same things (in the same order), so that second step was pretty easy.  Just don't ask me what those things were; I've pretty much forgotten the list in the course of the past 10 days, and I've temporarily misplaced the card I wrote it on.

After the counterparts left, our schedule called for some kind of RECONNECT activity for the volunteers, but I can't really tell you what that was supposed to involve, other than that it was going to be outside.  Since the weather was uncooperatively rainy for the next two days, we never did reconnect.  On the other hand, most of us were okay with that; we get along well enough that having a specific activity for reconnecting would only be a hollow echo of our own independent conversations and activities.

On Friday the 6th, we started new language classes, using a completely different format than we had in our initial training.  Instead of trying to learn new word lists as randomly prepared by the ajons, each group would suggest its own topic.  A student would then say a topic-related sentence or question, and the ajon would render it in culturally appropriate Thai.  The student would then learn the sentence well enough to repeat it into a tape recorder.  After a sufficient number of sentences had been recorded, the group would play back and repeat all of the sentences, and then the ajon would write them up and analyze what was said.

Given that my head hurt during the originally training from having to guess at words, I was thrilled at this different method.  It was a great way of learning both vocabulary and grammar at the same time, and the fact that the students came up with all of the sentences ensured that the lessons were much more targetted to our different interests and needs.  One of my group members did a particularly good job of bringing out the full potential of the lessons, since she would sit with a grammar book during breaks and look for things that she wanted to have explained further.  (Impressed with the book, I bought it for myself at the earliest opportunity.)

These new-style classes were regretably short-lived.  Of the five mornings devoted to language classes, the last two of them were used for dialect lessons.  I can't speak for the other regions, but the northern dialect has literally dozens of rules for how pronunciation of regular &quot;central&quot; Thai words are pronounced.  You get the same kind of thing in America, with different regions pronouncing things in varying degrees of flatness or nasality, and some being (like the Bostonian native) having odd ways of pronouncing their 'R's.  The changes from Central to Northern Thai are simple more complex, is all.  More consonants and vowels vary, and sometimes a sound only shifts with certain letters, even if there are others that make the same original sound (one 'k' shifts to the 'g' sound, and another doesn't, for example).

It's not just a question of pronunciation, though.  There are also completely different words for plenty of things.  For example, I'm going to have to memorize a dozen new question words just so I can be sure to understand what I'm being asked by the older folks who never really learned the Central dialect.  Considering that I'm already feeling like my language skills have kind of stagnated at site, this is all very daunting, but at least the classes were interesting, and now I have resources to look into.

Compared with the fun of the new language classes, our other sessions were something of a drag, and sometimes a flat-out disappointment.  For example, a lot of us asked for further explanation of Buddhism as it interacts with Thai culture, and so we had a lecturer come in from one of the Thai universities.  Given that the woman has apparently hardly left Bangkok for decades, the result was much the same as you would get if you asked a Connecticut-born Harvard scholar to tell you about life in New Orleans: no matter how much she may have studied, she still didn't sound like she knew what she was talking about.  I'll likely have better luck just borrowing books from the Peace Corps library.

Another lecture was on Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation, which seems like it should have been a terrifically interesting and useful topic.  It was led by workers from Save the Children International, who have been helping kids in the south deal with the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami.  They opened the lecture, however, with a discussion about involving children in the decision-making process to prevent &quot;unfairness,&quot; with examples drawn from volunteer memories such as siblings getting different privileges at age 15 or whatever.  Given the lame whiney nature of what we thus labelled as &quot;unfair,&quot; the whole lecture lost a lot of credit in many volunteers' minds.  I'm sure there were probably a few good points made in the course of the alloted hour and a half, but heck if I was able to pay enough attention to catch them.

Also in the &quot;sounded better on paper&quot; category was a trip we made on Saturday the 7th to visit the Children's Home, an orphanage of sorts about an hour from our resort.  The trip was explained to us as chance to learn about the place and help them out with a bit of generalized community service.  But while we got the lecture part of the trip (and it wasn't dull, but there's little that really stands out in my mind as noteworthy a week later, except that the place aims for about 100 kids living there at a time), the service component didn't happen.  Instead, we just toured the grounds and played a couple of group games with the kids.  I'm not saying it was bad, but I'm not sure that it was worth the time either.

The training officially ended with a group activity that bordered on (but stopped short of) being annoyingly namby-pamby.  The 60 of us (54 volunteers plus assorted training staff) stood in a large &quot;circle&quot; and took turns in saying our little summaries and best wishes upon the end of the training.  What kept this interesting was that we each had the complete attention of everyone else, but only for as long as we could keep a match burning.  Our normally verbose Program &amp; Training Officer had her match go out almost instantly when she was demonstrating.  It's actually too bad; she going to be departing by the end of the year, so this was her last chance to talk to all of us in person.  I'm sure she'll be sending more than a few e-mails in the next few months, though, so it'll work out.  Mai bpen rai.

On this past Saturday (the 14th), the training ended and Peace Corps took us back to Bangkok so that we could return to our various sites.  Most of us opted to stay an extra day in the city (primarily to watch the Harry Potter movie, from the sound of the reports) and hang out together.  Since I need 11 hours to travel and I wasn't about to try getting to the bus station during the dawn rush hour, I had to give up on the Peace Corps restriction that weekend travel should end by 7pm on Sunday (my bus didn't actually depart Bangkok until 8:40).  PC policy thus forced me to take a vacation day for Monday, which in retrospect is just as well.  Since I don't sleep very well on the overnight buses, I appreciated having the time to rest and recover (and catch up on household chores like doing my laundry).  Now I can hardly wait for tomorrow to come, so that I can find out just how much my best-laid plans with my Rong Nyoke will go awry.

Back to the adventure of real volunteer life.  At least now I can go back to taking things as they come without having to worry about any more homework assignments.  I hope to have some interesting things to write about in the weeks ahead.

Keep in touch in the meantime,
John
