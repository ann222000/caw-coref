*I*n an extensive interview with S Nagnath, President and Chief Investment
Officer, DSP Merrill Lynch Mutual Fund discussed his investment strategy,
his team of fund managers and why some of his company's funds have a huge
portfolio of 50 to 60 stocks.

&quot;We are very bullish on basic engineering and capital goods as a
sector,&quot; despite not being particularly bullish about the construction
sector, he says.

Contrary to the popular market feeling that the technology sector is heading
for a bad phase S Nagnath says that there is nothing wrong with the sector
and he remains bullish on the Indian IT sector in the long run.

Here's the first part of the interview with S Nagnath:

*What gives your organisation a competitive edge in the market?*

We have not had just one fund doing well, but many. Our funds have done well
across themes, sectors and market
capitalisation&lt; http://in.rediff.com//getahead/mktcap.htm &gt;.
That itself gives our funds a better profile in the market place.

*Your funds have done very well. What's the secret?*

Our funds have done well across themes, sectors and market cap. It boils
down to skillful stock picking and sectoral allocation. I have to give my
team full credit.

*How big is your investment team?*

We currently have three fund managers, three analysts, and one dealer.

We have a risk management team of four headed by a risk manager. They
monitor the fund's portfolios and run the portfolio matrix through various
parameters.

Anup Maheshwari, head of equities and corporate strategy, has been in the
business for almost 12 years and has a great track record. Soumendra
Lahiri - Co Head of Equities, a talented stock picker, has around 12 years
of experience. Apoorva Shah, another fund manager has around 16 years of
experience.

It's a talented team, having years of experience across market cycles and
understands different sectors very well. This contributes to our large
talent pool in terms of intellectual capital.

*Do your fund managers team up as analysts?*

Yes. Each of these fund managers has an analyst to help him out. But if you
are a fund manger, you are also effectively analysing companies.

Like all other fund house, we talk to a variety of brokers in the market
place and we get research inputs from these brokerage houses. Our team of
fund managers and analysts refer to that but also do their own research
alongside before arriving at a buy, sell or hold decision.

*How involved are you in the investment process?*

Since I have the oversight of the investment process -- fixed income and
equity -- my job is to largely provide the macro inputs. I look at the broad
macro trends, market direction of trends, global
liquidity&lt; http://in.rediff.com//getahead/liq.htm &gt;trends, currency,
inflation, interest rates and some sectoral trends.

We do have periodic review meetings where we discuss all these issues. I
provide my inputs and hear what the team has to say.

Even our stock picking ideas are debated and discussed when we meet. But I
leave the final decision to the concerned fund manager. There is no single
person who takes that decision.

My team has a great deal of autonomy and flexibility.

*You are the President and CIO. Is there any conflict of interest in your
roles?*

One is the business oversight responsibility and the other is the investment
oversight. Having a talented team helps do justice to both the roles.

*Does your AMC have a particular investment style?*

We are essentially bottom-up &lt; http://in.rediff.com//getahead/bot.htm &gt; stock
pickers with a degree of top-down
&lt; http://in.rediff.com//getahead/top.htm &gt;macro analysis. Not pure
bottom-up or top-down. Around 60 per cent of our
effort is bottom-up stock picking and the remaining 40 is top-down analysis,
sectoral trends, macro analysis, etc.

In India, we have not as yet gotten into that growth-value select focus
verticals that you find in other global markets. But broadly I would say
that we are growth investors. But within that, there is a segment
called *G*rowth
*A*t a *R*easonable *P*rice which is a nomenclature used in the West - *GARP
*. We are in that category.

*Some of your **large-cap*
&lt; http://in.rediff.com//getahead/mktcap.htm &gt;*funds have huge portfolios
of around 60 stocks. Why such diversification?
*

There could be some positions that are in the process of being sold out or
some miniscule IPO allotments. But, for a large-cap, diversified
equity fund&lt; http://in.rediff.com//getahead/diversified.htm &gt;with a
largish corpus, 50 to 60 stocks is a ballpark number.

*So your **mid-cap and micro-cap*&lt; http://in.rediff.com//getahead/mktcap.htm &gt;
* funds will have as many, if not more?*

Possible, given the level of liquidity and turnover etc. Let's say you have
a Rs 1,500 crore fund and you want to put 3 per cent in one stock. That
would amount to Rs 45 crore. For that kind of a position size in a mid cap
stock, you have to have a reasonably high degree of market turnover on a
daily basis. So the number of stocks may be a little more.

*What are your views on the tech sector?*

People are taking a pessimistic view given the rupee appreciation. And we
believe that some of that may be borne out in the quarters' results -- so we
will wait and see. In the long term, we are bullish on the sector. If you
look at the hiring plans of the large tech companies, it is stupendous
compared to what we saw three years ago. So that tells us that there is a
high degree of confidence on part of the companies about their pipeline of
business. So while the rupee appreciation is a near-term negative, over the
medium- to long-term we see no major problem in terms of revenue growth.

*Why don't you have aviation stocks in your currently portfolios?*

I think we have to increase our understanding of the sector a little more.
At the moment, the listed opportunities are few. And in the context of
extremely high competition and high fuel prices, it is better to wait and
watch.

*Construction is not your favourite sector but exists in your portfolios.
How bullish are you on it?*

We are very bullish on basic engineering and capital goods as a sector. So
construction as a sector by itself may not have a huge weightage, but we
classify it as part of engineering and capital goods. Anything to do with
capex spending by the corporate sector, infrastructure development by the
government or private sector, we are very bullish on. We are also very
bullish on energy and oil &amp; gas.
