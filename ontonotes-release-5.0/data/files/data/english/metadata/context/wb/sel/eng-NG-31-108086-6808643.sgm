I just put the first coat of Alclad II Color A on the underside of my T-33.
I then noticed that I'm almost out of Color A.  I have the "new" Alclad II
colors of Aluminum, Duraluminum, etc.

What Alclad II "old" colors (A, B, C) correspond with the "new" colors
(aluminum, Duraluminum, etc.)?  Please note that I am not trying to compare
the Original Alclad to Alclad II, but the two different sets of Alclad II.

Thanks,

Art

I believe that "Aluminium ALC-101" is the direct equivalent of "Color A".
However, the best way to be certain is to treat the current coat of Alclad
as a base coat and mist a full coat of your choice over it.

Incidentally, there has been a batch of new Alclad colours released
recently.  I have used "Airframe Aluminium ALC-119".  It turns out that it
is *exactly* the same colour as "Aluminium ALC-101", except that the shine
is different. And here is the important part - the difference in shine
remains apparent even under a couple of coats of Kleer (Future) and a coat
of satin varnish!  That's going to make it even easier to get the subtle
variations in shade between panels on an NMF aircraft!  I'm very impressed
indeed with Alclad2 products.

I e-mailed Alclad directly with the following question:

Would I be correct in assuming that your old naming convention of "A", "B",
& "C" correspond respectively to:

a.. 101 Aluminium
a.. 102 Duraluminium
a.. 103 Dark Aluminium

They e-amiled back very quickly and said this is correct.

Hats off to Alclad!
