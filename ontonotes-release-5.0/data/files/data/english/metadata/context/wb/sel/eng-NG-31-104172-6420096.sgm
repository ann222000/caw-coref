Hi Gang,

Well I have managed to sort out my Fotki folder and have done it in some
form of order lol, well at least I know where everything is not that there
is much on there.

Your not going to believe this but there are tags for everyone on the site
(some more than others only because some names were more common when I came
across them). So you will all be like kids in a Candy Shop lmao.

Inkkfreakk I know there is not many for you but I can assure you that there
are more tags to come for you. I know you only came into the group a few
weeks ago and I have tried to get some tags for you so you didn't feel left
out.

PLEASE NOTE: There is a password on the folder. I know people can view the
messages who are not members of the group and could most probably nick the
password but I'm happy to have it on at the moment. It will be changed on a
regular basis anyway

Well here is the link to the folder you get the tag from:

http://public.fotki.com/Hazel1558/tags-for-my-groups/
(Once at the site click on the folder for: GG's Tags and Music Previews)

PASSWORD:  GGfriends

Spelt as it is. It maybe easier just to copy and paste it into the password
box.

Once in the folder there are albums labelled up for everyone. So each of you
have your own individual album. If I have missed anyone off please let me
know and I will make a note of your name for the next lot I get.

Depending how often I snag / request tags I will try and update this folder
every 2 weeks. There will be a notice sent through the group to notify you
all of this so don't worry about it I will let you know.

Pauline if there are any problems with me doing this then please let me know
I hope you didn't mind me doing this.

If anyone has any problems please post in the group and let me know and I
will try and help. I will be out tomorrow (Sunday) for most of the day but
will answer any questions / problems when I get back.

Enjoy the rest of the weekend and enjoy all your tags.

Hugs
Haze
Xxxxx

P.S I know theres not an album for Dave as he has got a harddrive pretty
much to himself with lots of tags lmao.

Hi Hazel,
You're a Star!
You are now officially the 'Snagger Queen' of GG's Tags &amp; Music Previews
(GGTMP)
LOL
Will have to try and find some 'Queen' tags for you!
LOL

Only ting comes to mind is the thought that in the past I've found that
Fotki 'Does Not Like' Copy and Paste for Passwords and you can usually get
in first try only If you type in the Password for whatever group or tagger
you are trying to access.
just a thought ... it Might prove 'problematic' if everyone Copy &amp; pastes
...
Will need to wait and see...

You off 'Visiting' then?
LOL
Used to do that a lot when we were younger, then folks came to us ... then I
said,
*"You Really Don't Need To Come All This Way"*
So they don't!
LOL
(not)
Miss the company and think they'd like to come only they think they'll
be 'interfering'...
Ho Hum
Not sure what to do for the best ...
Will make a point of telling folks they can drop in any time, what do you
think? Is thats a Good idea? or will they think I'm being 'patronising'?
You're younger so you'll have abetter idea how young folks think than I have
these days.

Anyhoo
Love the albums!
What a lovely treat of a Sunday to have a look and se what Hazel has in
store!
LOL

Thank you so much Hazel.

Hugs for now

Hi Inkkfreakk,
Don't worry I requested your tags, I couldn't find any on my travels to snag
so rest assured no one is using your name sweetie.
I think all this has back fired, thought it would be a good gift to everyone

Hi Pauline,
I am so glad you like them. I am in a few tag request groups and some have
unlimited requests so thought of all of you :-). I get quite a few requests
come through the group, some I'm not allowed to forward on though otherwise
I would send them through the group. If I do get any in the future I will be
sure to pass them on through the group for everyone.

Whilst picking up some of my tags I tend to mooch through the albums and if
there are names for anyone in this group I will snag them for you.

Woohoo thanks for the Queen status its much appreciate lmao.

I will also definitely bear the 'copy &amp; paste password into Fotki' in mind,
I know fotki has been playing for me lately so to have problems with pasting
passwords is really not that hard to believe lol. I think I will leave that
out of the next lot I send through lol. The only people who will have access
is everyone in this group and also your other group.

I have not been visiting anyone today I went to Chester Zoo lol again lol. I
took my mum to get her adoption pack. Me &amp; Dave bought her an adoption pack
for the Meerkats for Mothers Day I know its late but we forgot to get it her
last time so we thought why not take her when we go and get it. She enjoyed
it she's feeling abit tired and achy now but she said she had a good time.
Me &amp; Dave also got our Membership so we can go however many times we want
lol. Unlimited visits through out the year lol. The weather was beautiful
lovely warm and sunny. Got more pics again too. My name is on the plaque too
at the Meerkats enclosure Plaque 6 - Hazel Davies lol. I was going to take a
pic of it but I forgot to do it on the way out.

From my personal point of view I would invite them to come round, I don't
think you would be patronising, Friends and family who know you will know
you are not being patronising. If you feel funny about just asking outright
why not go visit them and mention it to them in conversation. Also insist
that they will not be interfering. I think they said that because they must
have misunderstood you when you said that they didn't have to come all this
way. Once you talk to them about it you will wonder what you were worrying
about and I am sure it will be worth while in the end.

Hope this helps, I try to give out advice when I can, well its usually from
my personal point of view lol, if it hasn't helped I apologise but I am sure
you will be fine and they will understand.

I hope all works out let me know how you get on Hun.

Big hugs
Haze xx

and I haven't requested it I will let you know, mind you we may be in the
same groups lol.

Are you still ok with me requesting tags for you using Inkkfreakk or would
you prefer another name or would you prefer I did not request the for you. I
don't want to upset you or anything. You know me I like to keep the peace
lol. Which ever is easiest I am happy to do for you.

Your very welcome and I am glad you like them it makes me all warm and fuzzy
lol.

Big Hugs

Hi Inkkfreakk,
Don't worry I requested your tags, I couldn't find any on my travels to snag
so rest assured no one is using your name sweetie.
I think all this has back fired, thought it would be a good gift to everyone

Hi Gang,

Well I have managed to sort out my Fotki folder and have done it in some
form of order lol, well at least I know where everything is not that there
is much on there.

Your not going to believe this but there are tags for everyone on the site
(some more than others only because some names were more common when I came
across them). So you will all be like kids in a Candy Shop lmao.

Inkkfreakk I know there is not many for you but I can assure you that there
are more tags to come for you. I know you only came into the group a few
weeks ago and I have tried to get some tags for you so you didn't feel left
out.

PLEASE NOTE: There is a password on the folder. I know people can view the
messages who are not members of the group and could most probably nick the
password but I'm happy to have it on at the moment. It will be changed on a
regular basis anyway

Well here is the link to the folder you get the tag from:

http://public.fotki.com/Hazel1558/tags-for-my-groups/
(Once at the site click on the folder for: GG's Tags and Music Previews)

PASSWORD:  GGfriends

Spelt as it is. It maybe easier just to copy and paste it into the password
box.

Once in the folder there are albums labelled up for everyone. So each of you
have your own individual album. If I have missed anyone off please let me
know and I will make a note of your name for the next lot I get.

Depending how often I snag / request tags I will try and update this folder
every 2 weeks. There will be a notice sent through the group to notify you
all of this so don't worry about it I will let you know.

Pauline if there are any problems with me doing this then please let me know
I hope you didn't mind me doing this.

If anyone has any problems please post in the group and let me know and I
will try and help. I will be out tomorrow (Sunday) for most of the day but
will answer any questions / problems when I get back.

Enjoy the rest of the weekend and enjoy all your tags.

Hugs
Haze
Xxxxx

P.S I know theres not an album for Dave as he has got a harddrive pretty
much to himself with lots of tags lmao.
