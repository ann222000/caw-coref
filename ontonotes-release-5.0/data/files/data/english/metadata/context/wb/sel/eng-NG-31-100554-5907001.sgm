My oil light goes on intermittently. When I start up, it's okay. After
driving around for about 15 minutes, it comes on, sometimes steady,
sometimes it flickers on and off. It was on while I was at a stop
light, so I turned the engine off and back on, and the light went off.
I did the same thing in my driveway when I got home and the same thing
happened, it went out when I restarted the engine. I have it idleing
in my driveway and the light is staying off.

I thought I had a short in the sender harness because it was rubbing
the belt. I moved it out of the way, and still have the probelm. I
wiggled the harness and nothing happens with the light.

I just had the oil and filter changed. That didn't help.

I would appreciate any suggestions.

Thanks.

I forgot to mention it's a 99 Camry, 6 cylinder, with 225,000 miles.

There are generally 2 things that make low oil pressure warning lights
flicker:
1) Low oil pressure - possible causes of low oil pressure are a blockage
(i.e., sludge); bad oil pump; and excessive bearing clearance.  Sludge or
oil gelling seems to build up if the oil has not been changed for 9,000 or
more miles.  Check for sludge buildup by removing one of the valve covers.
Check oil pressure by removing the oil pressure sender, installing an oil
pressure gauge, and measuring oil pressure.

2) Problem with the oil pressure sender and/or sender circuit.  If the oil
pressure sender is leaking, the low oil pressure light may come on, and a
damaged wire could also make the light come on.

Do you have enough oil? What viscosity? What brand of filter was used?

At 225000 miles, you should be using 10W30 or 10W40
