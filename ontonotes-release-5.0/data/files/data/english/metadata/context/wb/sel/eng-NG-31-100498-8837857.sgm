Hi there -
I have a 1999 Escort Wagon and I have recently had a problem with my
odometer - it stopped work. The speedometer, just like everything
else, works perfectly well. The odometer (including the trip odometer)
just simply stopped working. I took it to a mechanic and he told me
that everything is electronic there and therefore I would actually
need to replace the entire instrument panel. That obviously seemed
excessive, and so was the price ($400 for the panel alone).

Before I made any decisions, I decided to search online and it seems
like cleaning up the battery's ground contact would be a possibility
(since the PCM uses that). I haven't tried that yet... is it actually
a possible solution?

Any other suggestions?

Thanks!

Correction:

I think the technical name is not &quot;instrument panel&quot;, but rather
&quot;instrument cluster&quot;. And the part is actually $527, which seems absurd

Any suggestions are welcome... I would be thrilled to avoid a $700
repair for a $2500 car.

Go on eBay and search for a used escort instrument cluster. They're about
$40-80 each. Make sure you get the correct one for your model year. You
have the option of upgrading to one that has a tachometer, they're plug
compatible with the non-tach version.

Thanks for the suggestion. In that case, what would happen with the
mileage? Do I need to re-program the new one, or do I get a special
document from the department of transportation?

If you want, you can get a sticker from a Ford dealer (or any dealer for
that matter)
that says that the odometer was changed on a certain date and doesn't
reflect the
actual mileage. Or you can make up your own, laminate it and stick it to the
driver's
door frame somewhere. When you sell the car, there's an odometer mileage
statement
and a box to check that the mileage is not accurate.

In any event, keep a record for yourself as to what the difference is
between the actual
(old) mileage and the new one so that you know when things like timing belt
changes
are due.
