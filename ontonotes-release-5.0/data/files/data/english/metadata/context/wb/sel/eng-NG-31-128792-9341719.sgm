PRESS RELEASE
18 September 2007
For immediate release
Issued by Zion Arts Centre

200 years after abolition of slavery,
young female cast ask if our hands are still tied?

How far would you go to succeed?
How much are you trapped in your lifestyle?
How long would you suffer in silence?

Afrocats are proud to present their new performance piece, My Hands Are Tied.

This exciting and energetic production involves dance, drama, humour and tragedy.

My Hands Are Tied looks at the many ways that we can all be enslaved.  A play which highlights the sad fact that oppression occurs in our own society as well as in the developing world.  The play has an uplifting message.

Magdalen Bartlett, Artistic Director of Afrocats, leads this young all-female cast in what promises to be as successful a show as last year's Art 06 nominated Afrocats production of Where Is Home?

My Hands Are Tied is a performance of two parts. It begins by exploring stories of female trafficking and child labour and looks at the origins of slavery.  In the second part, three characters face struggles in modern Western society.  They are ultimately thrown together and forced to confront the paths of their own lives.

This performance features both Afrocats members and students from Levenshulme High School.

This powerful performance at Zion Arts Centre during Black History Month and Acts of Achievement 2007 marks the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery.

Caroline Boyd, Business and Audience Development Officer at Zion Arts Centre has said, &quot;Afrocats' Where Is Home performance at Zion Arts Centre was nominated for the prestigious Art06 Award. We are understandably really excited about this next performance as it will be another quality piece featuring local young people as they mark Black History Month and the bicentennial of the abolition of slavery in a way that is relevant to society today.&quot;

Notes for Editors
Established in 2003 and led by dancer, actor and choreographer Magdalen Bartlett, Afrocats are one of the most dynamic and energetic performance groups around. They have performed all over the UK.

Combining the most exciting elements of dance, drama and music, Afrocats aim to create unity within diversity by working with all ages, groups and communities from local students with a passion for the arts to young female refugees and asylum seekers.

Afrocats was a nominated finalist in the Art Council's prestigious Art06 awards for its production of Where Is Home?: a theatre piece that explored the issues faced by young refugees in the UK.  Afrocats aim to share culture and tradition with all while combating negative stereotypes through the universal language of performance.  Afrocats also provide performance workshops for schools, colleges, youth and community groups, working with all ages.

Zion Arts Centre is a creative space for young people. Zion Arts Centre encourages young people in Manchester to showcase their talents in its muti-arts venue and supports them as they engage their creativity in positive work such as My Hands Are Tied by Afrocats.

Eternal Wound Exhibition by local artist Sally A Turner's Blue Lizard Arts is also showing at Zion Arts Centre as part of Black History Month.

Eternal Wound Launch preview will be on Saturday 20 October at 7pm and runs until 27 October

Sally A Turner has been creating new work using a wide range of media. The research for this new work has taken Sally on an emotional, spiritual journey and marks the bicentennial of the abolition of the Slave Trade Laws.

The exhibition begins to explore the effect and Diaspora of how the past five centuries still impact on our communities today.
Installations, sculpture, paintings and a solo dance performance for the preview night will take the audience on the same spiritual journey.  The solo dance piece will be performed by a young professional dancer from the local community supported by Zion Arts Centre.

Workshops by Blue Lizard Arts will be available throughout the week of the exhibition (21 - 27 October)
