Was Shakespeare a philosopher?

I think so. And Plato and Nietzsche were poets. And Einstein was a
spiritual leader.

It's sad that the disciplines are so often separated, with big walls
between them all.

There's no room for renaissance men.

Except for out here.

According to modern definition a philosopher is a specialist, a calm,
rational, reasonable person. You think Shakespeare was like that?

Referring to these guys all in the past tense must mean you don't find
their genius long-lived.

You can just put hyphens between disciplines and play with them that
way.

No. He was a poet and a superb examiner of human nature. But fools for
whom that isn't enough are constantly insulting his memory by trying to
make him something he was not.

No?

William Shakespeare - whoever &quot;he&quot; was - would seem to have satisfied
the dictionary definition of the term:

Philosopher - a wise person who is calm and rational; someone who lives
a life of reason with equanimity.

I have proposed to a Shakespeare director that these humbug lines &quot;To
be or not to be,&quot; should be read exactly like that, out of a book.
Not the whole of speech, but now and then looking away to muse on the
lines...&quot;tis a consummation devoutly to be wisht to die to sleepe.&quot;
Then Hamlet looks up to say, &quot;to sleepe, perchance to dreame, aye,
there's the rub.&quot; And so forth, as if the character is in dialog
with the writer he is reading. There's much scope in such an
approach, and the intimidation is taken away from the soliloquy , all
the tired and stale readings, the expectation that someone might do
something fresh with this speech, or even adequate. &quot;To be or not to
be&quot; is a great humbug, the most famous line in all of Shakespeare and
no actor really wants to say it. But it could be read without
crutching it forward or taking on some histrionic, it's merely a line
out of a book, and Hamlet, time and again in the dialog, and as a
commentator on the text, might find something more than breast-beating
in those lines.

The director spoken of said he liked the idea, and maybe he'd do it
that way, but maybe not. He wasn't sure, but there was a possibility.
He'd want more evidence.

Most startlingly, Q1 presents ‘To be or not to be’ in its equivalent of
2.2 rather than in 3.1. In Q1 it follows straight on from the decision
of the King and his councillor (who is called Corambis in Q1) to spy on
Hamlet and Ophelia when Hamlet enters ‘poring vppon a booke’ (D4v). In
Q2 there are some 500 lines between Hamlet’s entry with his book (F1r)
and his delivery of the soliloquy (G2r-v).

There's perhaps a hint that it *might* have been done in this way in the
version in Q1, which (garbled as it is) does seem to derive from some sort
of theatrical origin (whether you accept memorial contamination or not). In
that version Hamlet begins &quot;To be or not to be ... Ay, there's the point&quot;,
which could represent someone holding a kind of dialogue with the book
they're reading.

Not to cavil. I just wondered about the rest of your proposal.

How did Branagh do it? I don't recall. My impression was that when
the dialogue got sticky, he'd resort to Orson Welles-style camera
moves (e.g., trucking through an inside-out panorama inside a hall of
mirrors without a camera, light or mike in sight) or bringing in a
familiar face to ham his way through the bit while B tried to out-ham
him. (As with Heston and Crystal, but he wouldn't dare it with
Williams as Osric.)

I remember all that, but I don't remember The Soliloquy. How did he
handle it? As a throw-away, I seem to recall now.

P.S. Let me add that, as indicated in messages which I posted to HLAS
on May 3 and May 29, I view &quot;philosophy&quot; as process or, as it were,
mind in motion - not static mind or doctrine of any kind - in the sense
in which Wittgenstein spoke of his own philosophical work:

&quot;My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me
finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through
them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder,
after he has climbed up on it.)&quot;

Shakespeare was not a technical or professional philosopher in the
scholastic tradition. He does not write syllogisms. Sometimes he
writes things that look like syllogisms, but only to subvert them by
changing the meanings of his terms part way through. To that extent,
he is an anti-philosopher.

But then so was Bacon or Descartes, both anti-Scholastic.

Some of the things he writes have implications that would now be
called philosophical. When he says:
'The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
Though to itself it only live and die'
he raises the question what it is like, from inside, to be a plant
instead of an animal: what it _feels_ like. I know of no earlier
instance of this. At present there is a discussion in the New
Scientist of what would constitute an explanation of consciousness,
and that kind of question is being raised as part of it.

When he begins: 'Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?' he is asking
a question. Why does he need the answer to that question? What is he
doing that requires it? Writing a poem, of course. He is asking 'What
shall I put in this poem?' Yes, but what poem? This one, of course.
Then this is a poem all about the writing of itself? That contravenes,
say, J.L. Austin's dictum, 'a sentence cannot without absurdity refer
to itself'. Can that be resolved? Or is this subversion of a
philosophical point (unknown in Shakespeare's time) simply a way of
giving us a weird poetical feeling?

(It will be noticed that all this is based on the sonnets.)

Okay. What does that mean? Do you agree with Robert S. and gangleri,

Bob, here's an easy test: if your &quot;serious definition of philosopher&quot; does
not cover Plato, it's not a &quot;serious definition of philosopher.&quot;
Similarly, a &quot;serious definition of baseball player&quot; that doesn't cover
Babe Ruth is not a serious definition of a baseball player.

But why doesn't Plato count?

I suppose philosophers who thought their ideas were indeed confirmed by
nature, or were expressions of nature's laws, would not count, and neither
would logicians.

Plato could be thought of as a writer of closet plays, by my
definition, if we consider his works primarily devoted to narrative
rather than to ideas. I like your Plato/Ruth parody of
anti-Stratfordian parallels, though.

I don't see that logicians put their ideas up against Nature, or could.

By some people's definition, Milton probably had his daughters write
his stuff, because at least they were literate.

Tireseus, the blind prophet, seems to have been compensated by the
gods with foresight, plus he had other things going for him, like
experience of dwelling in Hades, being both man and woman, living as a
snake, etc.. So he gets led around by children and can sense what
nature is concerned about. But he was illiterate.

One blind philosopher, whose book I read, Philosophy for Lowbrows, was
actually teaching college. bb

Terry Ross makes good points.

The study of Physics was called 'natural philosophy' throughout the C19th.
Physics was the study of nature, and nature not a different nature than
found outside physics. Esoterically, and which is not to describe a
generally different group of people form the C19th!, the nature in question
is also one's own nature - a distinction from the 'mind apart', to which
Platonism, or neo-Platonism is an example of self-inclusion in nature.

The Greek idea of Philosophy, was to //reflect// on one's //experience//.

This is in contradistinction to some modern ideas of thinking outside one's
experience, [or speculating, fantascising] which began to emerge in the
early C20th, and to which the German philosopher Hiedegger has described as
of lesser worth; coining a term to describe someone who openly speculates on
their non-experience, as a 'pathic' discourse.

He says that people who produce works which evince such pathic behavior, in
preference to actually undertaking the experiences to which they refer and
to which they are capable of experiencing, are of no philosophic worth.

In these senses, was the Author a philosopher?

Cytherea is Venus, or rather Aphrodite, goddess of love. In the story
of how she became known as Cytherea, Hesiod (Theogony 194) refers to
how 'fresh grass and flowers grow during Zeus' and Hera's
intercourse in Il&lt;iad&gt; 14.347, and so here for the goddess of sex;
compare the use of sex by men to make things grow (971 n,)' (West ad

flower, herself one of the pleasures of the field, and plucked
therefrom (cropped) by someone else.

"/>

Philosopher: One who loves and pursues wisdom, or the knowledge of things
and their causes, whether theoretical or practical. Originally included
people versed in the physical sciences. (OED paraphrased.) (Aside: At
least back when I was in school, it was thought that much or even most of
&quot;Plato&quot; was actually his thought, not just a reiteration of Socrates,
although this was perhaps just the hobby-horse of my political philosophy
professor.)

The use of the word &quot;pursues&quot; suggests to me a formality to me which is not
present in the canon, and I believe there has always been a recognition of
this formality (in other words, I agree with you, Bob). Worth noting,
though, that Shakespeare himself recognized &quot;natural&quot; philosophers such as
Touchstone.

I'd suggest that what we know of Shakespeare from the canon is that he was a
writer of philosophical bent, rather than being a philosopher as such. He
shows a familiarity with philosophical concepts of his day and he uses them
for his dramatic purposes, but he doesn't develop them. I doubt very much
that any of his contemporaries would have thought of him as a philosopher.
None commented on it, did they? It's all about his sweet poetry, isn't it?

His contribution to subsequent philosophical thought was as a jumping-off
point for later philosophers, and from what little I know, they always
thought his insights (into human motivation, mostly) were intuitive rather
than formal. In fact, they were inclined to use Shakespeare's insights as
metaphors rather than as philosophical underpinnings. I'm thinking mostly
of Freud here, of course, but I think it applies to others.

This is not to say, however, that in his spare time he was not writing the
works of Bacon - just that the dramatic and poetic works served a different
purpose.

It's not like 'year' or ' water'. I mean there is no

to call Sheakespeare a philosopher, what harm is
there? If the words in the dictionary change under
the head: &quot;philosopher&quot; because of useage, what
has really changed? They may change back and
at some point 'philosopher' may refer to what we

Come lighthouse builders, soldiers of the word,
Come gather 'round me on this soft spring eve,
Prime yer wit's pistols, polish wisdom's sword,
For we're setting sail for all we believe.
Where principle transcends all politics,
Where lawyers are replaced by higher law,
Where children amongst the Great Books frolic,
Defenders of honor are held in awe.
For isn't forever worth fighting for?
Where rhyme and reason resound once again,
What sailor's soul could ever ask for more,
Than to serve the Lord with poetry's pen?
And I think I feel that ancient wind rising,
It's a choice I made, girl, so long ago,
The tide's turning, and we're both realizing,
That far, far away, this captain must go.
With all these castles built on shifting sands,
There's not much left for a poet 'round here,
All that can keep me now, from far off lands,
Is fearing that this fog will never clear.
This fog-- I just can't help dreaming beyond,
Dreaming a dream so bold it must be real,
Until that day which has never yet dawned,
Is crossed by my spirit's thundering keel.
'Cause I know there's just got to be a place
With wondrous mountains and a shining sea,
With Caroline's grace and beautiful face,
Where moral beauty's anchor sets ye free.
And I know that in-between here and there,
I'll sail on by some more who don't believe,
Forgive the blind leading the blind nowhere,
For in the end it's themselves they deceive.
Tonight I'm setting sail for victory,
Too many people talking of decline,
Tomorrow is the children's history,
So in me wake I'll leave them something fine.
Come sailors and sinners, it's not too late,
Serve something Greater, mate, and it shall save ye,
Set sail to make eternity yer fate,
Come serve aboard the Carolina Navy.

November Thunder
I heard the thundering of my peer's wondering,
What had been done to their inheritance--
The Great Books through which religion does sing,
The tradition by which is born romance.
And I dreamed the children began rising,
Against their pagan parents' darkened culture,
As they awakened, began realizing,
That they alone did command their future.
For long ago one of them took the helm,
With prophets and disciples by His side,
To sail on towards a renaissance's realm,
Where for God's poetry He gladly died.
And deep in yer soul, can ye hear that thunder?
'Tis nothing more than the children's great wonder.

Like Hamlet yet being able to see the higher ideals of his own
conscience though surrounded by a fallen Kingdom, I had sometimes felt
dejected and depressed back there on the mainland, to witness the great
fanfare which surrounded the second-rate politics and pornography that
had come to replace the classics, while those Greater Elements had been
laid to rest by a secular-materialist generation. And when we looked
around at the great emphasis our generation placed on ephemeral stock
options, and the honor of losing as much money as possible in a
startup, we felt ever more exhorted to take up arms for our cause, and
avenge the murder of the murder of the Greatest that had ever been
thought and written. For rational beings, should not the penning of
eternal poetry be worthy of ambitions greater than those by which
politics is promoted and money is pursued?

How all occasions do inform against me,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
If his chief good and market of his time
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
Looking before and after, gave us not
That capability and god-like reason
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
Of thinking too precisely on the event,
A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
And ever three parts coward, I do not know
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
Witness this army of such mass and charge
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
Excitements of my reason and my blood,
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Which is not tomb enough and continent
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
-Hamlet IV, iv

And as I stand on Kill Devil Hill, my shadow stretching towards the
ocean as the sun sinks over America, my spirit answers that whimpering
call of the forgotten Truth's distress, taking it beyond the breakers,
beyond the Diamond Shoals, beyond the dusky horizon that my limited
eyesight presents me with. And I'm scared. For inspite of my private
optimism, which marks me as a madman in New York literary circles,
there are times I have sensed that my generation no longer cares, that
we have become jaded, that we have become slackers, that we have lost
the hope and desire for the rational dream, for a common grounding, for
a deeper meaning, for a profound existence, for religion. That we have
lost hope along with values, meaning along with faith, that we have
lost the Word. I have heard and sometimes sensed that words mean
nothing, as I have seen promises forfeited upon, friends jilted, and
the dishonest excel as if dishonesty were a merit. I have sensed an
indifference out on the streets to the fact that while nine out of
every one thousand marriages ended in divorce in 1950, now over
five-hundred do. I have heard that we believe that God doesn't exist,
that relationships are for temporal, physical gratification, that
two-parent families are an antiquated ideal, founded upon ignorant
myths. I have heard that art and history are over, that aesthetic right
and wrong are indistinguishable, that postmodern secularism has
triumphed, and thus that the noble individual should shoot heroin, pick
up a guitar, and resign himself to serving the bureaucracy that sedates
the dreamless multitudes. All these elements have been weighing upon my
landlocked spirit, and now, with my soul set free upon its mission, I
stand here on Kill Devil Hill, apprehensively awaiting its return. For
even if it should be successful in navigating the shifting shoals and
reaching the forgotten Truths, it shall not find reason to return
without that second voice.

And when my spirit reaches that undiscerned locale beyond the breakers,
when it mingles with the Greats who have reflected upon God before me,
out where Truth and the first principles are indistinguishable, where
words find handholds upon the rock of our eternal souls, where we're
inspired to think in infinities and aspire towards eternities, I find
that I don't hear one single voice calling me back, but I hear 12,000,
where only one would have been enough.

And so I invite you to stand on top of Kill Devil Hill, and witness
firsthand these things that I have spoken of. A city on a hill cannot
be hidden.

You might have heard it, but I recommend that you also read about those
movements before judging them. For one thing, they seem to raise doubts
similar to yours about 'serving the bureaucracy that sedates the
dreamless
multitudes'.

For example, I was just reading that Conceptual Art and Minimalism
(perhaps your poetry has a little of that characteristic in it) from
the 1960s is in a sense a rejection of the Art World; in other words, a
rejection of the authorities of Modernism. The book I quoted yesterday
(Introduction to Postmodernism, R.Appignanesi) says that &quot;'Art' itself
was refuted as contaminated by the elitism and crass marketeering of
the art world&quot;. So, if you are rejecting current critical movements,
aren't you doing something similar?

The 'Eclectic or junk postmodernism' I think is misunderstood. I don't
think you can say that anything can be classified as art just because
it is popular in the market, and Appignanesi doesn't consider that true
postmodernism.

I personally like the idea of having the 'Classics' taught in schools.
As was mentioned, however, some of those works are quite advanced and
require some information from the teacher on historical and cultural
background. Also, young people might find it easier to identify with
great or good works written in their current generation covering issues
that are more personally relevant to them. I think a variety of works
should be taught, and then when one is older, one can pick and choose
one's own interests. It is probably at least as important to make sure
that young people can read well first. Perhaps growing illiteracy is a
problem.

No, I don't--I advocated reading the classics (and I'd include
Shakespeare there), and I implied that I didn't believe any popular
item was necessarily art. Yet we shouldn't exclude popular items from
being considered as art just because they are popular items. I also
believe in self-expression.

You seem to have the belief that 'Deconstruction ultimately
deconstructs itself', which one of my professors also thought, and he
might have been correct in some ways.

I personally believe (and so did he) that deconstruction and
postmodernism can be effective tools to analyze literature, for
example, without invalidating or unjustly validating the work of an
author.

For example, a work of literature might be shown to have somewhat
conflicting views, and that could indicate that the author was flexible
and multi-faceted, but it could also indicate that he/she was
contradictory. I believe we can make a partial judgment about the
author based on that analysis. And we can analyze the work in other
ways too.

My knowledge of those topics is fairly limited, but I'm giving my
intuitive sense of it because you asked what I believe.

I would guess it could, but don't know specifically. I suppose one
could talk of deconstructive design(!) as well as analysis--I have
heard of a deconstructive school of Architecture. I'm guessing here,
but I think for example one can combine several styles in one
structure, which seems unifying rather than otherwise.

Thanks.

In asking the question, I had in mind my visit to Madrid's Prado Museum
a few years ago, where Goya's late-in-life paintings conveyed imagery
with which I was intimately familiar through the Saga literature of
13th century Iceland and the Shakespeare Opus of Elizabethan/Jacobean
England.

Hence my puzzlement:

If there is something in Shakespeare which lends itself to
&quot;deconstruction&quot; in the modern fashion, then Goya's graphic treatment
of identical themes should also lend themselves to the like
&quot;deconstruction&quot;.

I don't see how Goya can be so &quot;deconstrued&quot;.

Hence my suspicion that &quot;deconstruction&quot; of Shakespeare is - well -
mere sound and fury, signifying nothing.

&gt; Hence my suspicion that &quot;deconstruction&quot; of Shakespeare is - well -
&gt; mere sound and fury, signifying nothing.

"/>

I tried to find an understandable deconstructive article about
Shakespeare on the web, and couldn't yet, though I'm willing to bet
that such an approach might have been taken on the later tragedies. I
know Marlowe lends himself to such analyses because he often seems
ambiguous, but it is not easy to find the books written about that
subject. Sometimes this information is very hard to understand. Maybe
we can talk about it later.

Re. the following:

Do you have any charts, etc. that show archetypal parallels from
Shakespeare to Saga literature? I know you often list items, along with
the Gemetria, but it would help people discuss this with you if you put
the information in one place.

Comment:

The archetypal pattern is vast and does not lend itself to brief
encapsulation - a friend of mine, the late Einar Pálsson (d. 1996),
spent five decades in researching it in the context of what he termed
'Roots of Icelandic Culture', providing an overview of his findings in
eleven books published in Icelandic and three books in English.

The pattern's complexity is vividly exemplified in the figure of
Hamlet.

Briefly, Hamlet first appeared in Icelandic myth as Amlóði, which is
Icelandic for Fool. In turn, Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus
elaborated the myth in Latin, with Amlóði becoming Amleticus in the
process.

But, as detailed by Giorgio de Santillana in a book whose title page
reads 'Hamlet's Mill - An Essay Investigating the Origins of Human
Knowledge and its Transmission through Myth', the Hamlet figure is a
universal one and has appeared under different labels in all parts of
the world since pre-historic times.

&quot;...it was a surprise,&quot; de Santillana wrote, &quot;to find behind the mask
an ancient and all-embracing cosmic power - the original master of the
dreamed-of first age of the world.

&quot;Yet in all his guises he remained strangely himself. The original
Amlodhi, as his name was in Icelandic legend, shows the same
characteristics of melancholy and high intellect. He, too, is a son
dedicated to avenge his father, a speaker of cryptic but inescapable
truths, an elusive carrier of Fate who must yield once his mission is
accomplished and sink once more into concealment in the depths of time
to which he belongs: Lord of the Golden Age, the Once and Future King.
[...]

&quot;Amlodhi was identified, in the crude and vivid imagery of the Norse,
by the ownership of a fabled mill which, in his own time, ground out
peace and plenty. Later, in decaying times, it ground out salt; and
now finally, having landed at the bottom of the sea, it is grinding
rock and sand, creating a vast whirlpool, the Maelstrom (i.e., the
grinding stream, from the [Icelandic] verb mala, &quot;to grind&quot;), which is
supposed to be a way to the land of the dead. This imagery stands, as
the evidence develops, for an astronomical process, the secular
shifting of the sun through the signs of t he zodiac which determines
world-ages, each numbering thousands of years. Each age brings a World
Era, a Twilight of the Gods. Great structures collapse; pillars topple
which supported the great fabric; floods and cataclysms herald the
shaping of a new world.&quot;

Core aspects of the myth have remained constant through the ages - for
example, the Sun's &quot;secular shifting through the signs of the zodiac&quot;
is mirrored in the concept of a Platonic Great Year of 25920 calendar
years, which I construe as one with the Hebrew Seventh Day of Creation.

In the context of myth, Archetypal MAN-Beast of Seventh Day IS Creation
in Time and Space viewed as a &quot;sacred&quot; projection of the Zodiac Above
onto Earth Below. In the opening scene of Hamlet, Archetypal MAN-Beast
is represented by 'sicke-at-heart' Francisco, the Cipher Value of whose
name, 4627, mirrors the Cipher Sum of the Icelandic for Time/Tími,
2315, and Space/Rúm, 2312 as in 2315 + 2312 = 4627.

And - this is certain to come as complete surprise to most students of
Hamlet on this forum - Francisco's &quot;exit&quot; denotes the end of a Platonic
Great Year as in 25920 - 4627 = 21293, where &quot;sicke-at-heart&quot; MAN-Beast
is transformed into Brave New World, as in 'The Tempest'.

Long before my discovery in the 1970s of the Saga-Shakespeare Cipher
Key, Einar Pálsson had identified details of the mythical Creation of
the World as envisaged by Iceland´s settlers in the 9th century. In
his first book published in 1969, Einar began his account of the
world-view of the Founding Fathers as follows:

&quot;The world was created on a small island off the south coast of
Iceland. The name of the island is Þrídrangr.&quot; The Cipher Value of
Þrídrangr is 5003. As for the &quot;world&quot; itself, it was represented by
a Pythagorean Triangle 3:4:5 drawn between three landmarks in the
original settlement known as Bergþórshváll, 7196, Miðeyjarhólmr,
6067, and Helgafell, 3027.

In Shakespeare's play, the &quot;exit&quot;/&quot;death&quot; of Microcosmic MAN-Beast
Francisco, 4627, at the end of a Platonic Great Year, 25920, would mark
the advent of a Brave New World, 25920 - 4627 = 21293.

As in the Cipher Number of Saga Myth's Primordial World, 5003 + 7196 +
6067 + 3027 = 21293.

The World of the Golden Age.

I suggest a contemporary renaissance created in the rich context of the
great books:

Postmodernists know that in order to defend their arbitrary power
structure, where exalted critics wield influence by hyping the value of
degraded literary works, they must defend to the death their
deconstructed context. They have learned that as long as the common
water source is poisoned with their politics, nothing will be allowed
to grow upon the private property of our souls but for barren cynicism.
They know that were the fog to break, the ideals of fidelity, honor,
and lasting romance would begin to blossom in the rising generation's
spirits. As the powerful architects of contemporary corruption, they
must disparage and destroy all who do not ultimately agree that black
is white and white is black, and thus noble romance and honest
innocence are their dire enemies.

The greatest postmodernists have never been the most beautiful nor
talented nor honest-they have ever been those with the least to lose
in the absence of beauty's truth and truth's beauty. Having little
in the way of the fundamental decencies and Natural private property,
as relativist critics they seek to gain by deconstructing others'
private property. And eventually there comes a time when there is
nothing left to deconstruct, but for the true living poets, who shall
be invincibly wicked in seeking vengeance for the razing of their
spiritual heritage and the cold-blooded murders of their cultural
fathers. So it is that the entire postmodern army of deans, agents,
editors, critics, and publishers today fear a lone poet by the name of
Drake Raft. For last night I saw his ghost in midtown Manhattan,
crossing Madison Avenue in cowboy boots, with his hat's brim hiding
his eyes.

Convoluted ironies and swirling vortexes will be encountered on the
high seas of postmodern culture, wherein it will yet once more be
observed that institutions which purport to cherish and transmit the
truth can easily be turned right around in the fog and become those
entities which most oppose it. As it must take an honest stand before
reality, some of the poetry and prose contained herein details the more
macabre customs particular to this generation, raised in the jaded wake
of free love, a declining reverence for the eternal soul, the
crassification of the popular cultural and political arena, and the
spiritual casualties of abortion.

At times aboard the decks of jollyroger.com, we peered a bit too deeply
into the fog's void, and as it looked back into us, we learned
firsthand how postmodern cynicism may breed the most powerful
enemy-one's very own conscience. For even when a man has slain all
the external demons, often the battle is only beginning, and never has
the enemy within known a better ally than postmodern relativism. We
kind of know where a lot of the postmodern priests are coming from. We
were in a grunge band and all that-we saw what the theories sung from
the secular pulpits on high could do to the souls of one's friends,
and we lost more than a few friends at the edge-to the classic
clichés of drinking and drugs, to the all-out pursuit of the material
high, to a few too many girls, and to the
Freudian-Darwinian-Nietzschean cynicism that God is no more than a
myth, and that we're no more than random chemical reactions, sans
intrinsic nor extrinsic meaning. Alas, without faith they joined the
living dead. Raised in the gray void sans tradition nor religion, they
never could discern the very grayness of the void, and so certain of
postmodern indifference, they were convinced that the eternal soul did
not exist, and they sold out for nothing at all. Such is the arrogance
of the small mind which never knows a context greater than itself, and
though conscious, never apprehends conscience.

We'd tasted that pseudo-scientific-secular atheism as physics majors
at Princeton, and we'll tell you that it was a natural faith in
something greater that saved us-wherefrom we also learned that virtue
is not to be found within revenge, but rather it is to be gained by
forgiving one's enemies. Never shall one prevail against the darkness
by answering with darkness, but only by lighting a light. We bear the
postmodern oligarchy and army-the deans, editors, professors,
lifetime politicians, cultural czars, MFA officials, professional
administrators, and all their eager students of decline-no malice,
but we only wish to inspire a literary movement that will grant the
children something greater than was given our generation.

This renaissance is by no means a generational war, but rather it's a
generational peace, as classics are written for all generations. It is
a recent marketing myth which ordains that every fifteen minutes the
new generation must be different (consume different things) from the
preceding one, for there is no difference in the continuum of eternal
souls. Justice is justice is justice, as it has always been, and as it
shall always be. By no means are the boomers in general to be held
responsible for postmodernism's obligatory cynicism, for I sense that
most of them are on our side, such as my mother and father, and the
high school teachers back in Ohio, who were humble before Shakespeare
and taught him by setting his words free within our souls.

And never forget-no matter what postmodernism's fading oligarchy
ordains, they cannot keep young poets from enjoying aesthetic freedom.
They can degrade the romantic to no end, assaulting the ideals of
pristine femininity and noble masculinity in the greater culture, but
young lovers' hearts belong to God alone, and the poetry of this
renaissance shall blossom in their souls. For I saw it in her deep
brown eyes just last night, walking the streets of Davidson, North
Carolina. If ye manage to keep objectivity's even keel-as our
conscientious teachers and parents did-knowing that the Greats are
yer crew members and God is the captain, then the eternal treasures at
jollyroger.com shall be yers for the keeping.

Poets are the fundamental leaders of all cultural transitions, and all
noble leaders must begin by voyaging beyond the contemporary in their
dreams, on towards the higher ideals; and from these spiritual
pinnacles they can hope to appeal to the better angels of human nature.
Fortune and chance play a decisive role in setting the stage, but once
set, all those who follow the call to set the truth down in words
proceed by creative endeavor and luck, on towards the same immutable,
classical elements that all poets and prophets have ever sought. Though
ye might sometimes feel yer walking the straight and narrow alone, know
ye that this voyage is eternity's most popular journey amongst the
Greats, and thus yer always in good company.

We were fortunate in that we began harboring dreams of a literary
renaissance at the dawn of the internet revolution, and too, we were
fortunate to be living in beautiful North Carolina, where we could meld
the natural romance emanating from places like Kill Devil Hill and
Chapel Hill and Boone, and the majestic lighthouses and mountains-all
reaching for the Carolina blue skies-into the jollyroger.com aura.
And the power and fury of September's hurricanes always served to
remind us of beauty's fundamental fragility.

Back in 1994, rejection slips were piling up for our more traditional
and refined literature, when suddenly a channel out towards a popular
renaissance opened upon the internet. We took advantage of the Linux
knowledge which becomes second nature to all physicists, and we set
about creating a classical context in the popular culture. And out upon
the web, we found that greatest treasure of all-a live global
audience to serve. Upon the open seas, all yer appreciative emails
combined to form the favorable winds that filled jollyroger.com's
sails in its formative years. And never for a moment do we
forget-were it not for all of ye out there, we might've made it out
beyond the postmodern fog, but we would've never made it back to
shore. For writing is the voyage out, and being read is the voyage back
on home.

While the revolutions in online commerce have been trumpeted far and
wide, and while jollyroger.com has certainly benefited from them, we
see a spiritual revolution in the culture as a nobler opportunity. As
the ecommerce infrastructure solidifies, with the thousands of
high-tech pyramid schemes collapsing, and the useful websites achieving
global dominance, the renaissance beyond the postmodern fog shall take
a bit longer to realize, as it is easier to change how people shop for
books rather than change the books they shop for, and the context they
read books in. It is perhaps impossible to change an aging
generations' heart, and thus the culture must wait for the rising
generation to resurrect those permanent beacons which endow life with
its richer meanings. Have faith we will, mate, for God springs eternal.

Before the internet, it was difficult to imagine a locale upon this
globe where people from all walks of life could gather to discuss the
Great Books, but now such a timeless, ubiquitous entity exists, an
equidistant one-click away from everywhere in the world. And though the
conversations range in quality and tenor, the Great Books don't seem
to mind, as they have changed not one word, nor their unyielding,
eternal context of Freedom's Truths. And now and then we receive the
email that makes it all worthwhile: &quot;Thanks for inspiring me to read
Moby Dick. . .&quot;

Some critics contend that literature serves no moral purpose and that
words should be read for mere enjoyment, and we hope that they enjoy
these words. And too, we hope jollyroger.com serves as a map that helps
the reader find a safe passage out towards their dreams. Always
remember this-even though our greater dreams are sometimes
unobtainable, there is yet vast beauty left in the wake of their
pursuit. For although Einstein, Socrates, and Captain Ahab never ...

Prologue

After posting my message on the &quot;Was Shakespeare a philosopher&quot; thread
today, June 10, at 1:39 pm, it occurred to me to check whether the
&quot;uninhabited island&quot; featured in 'The Tempest' might be the mythical
locus of the World's Creation symbolized by Þrídrangr, 5003, in the
Settlement Myth of 9th century Iceland.

In short order, I found that the Cipher Value of the opening stage
directions in 'The Tempest' (First Folio) - A tempestuous noise of
Thunder and Lightning heard, 22795 - is mirrored in the Cipher Sum 5003
+ 7128 + 7 + 345 + 3635 + 6677 = 22795.

This would accord with the hypothesis that 'The Tempest' concerns the
Creation of the World at Þrídrangr, 5003, on God's Command (Gen. 1:3)
&quot;Let there be light!&quot;, 7128, at which Microcosmic MAN-Beast of Seventh
Day, 7, enters the stage as 'deformed first heire' of the Creator's
'inuention', with the 'foundation' of MAN-Beast's 'virgin' Psyche
denoted by Triangle 3:4:5 or 345.

The residual Cipher Values would relate this Pagan imagery to the
Christian concept of Spirit's Incarnation in Creation in Time and Space
- &quot;Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
and they shall call his name Emmanuel [3635], which being interpreted
is, God with us [6677] - as summarized in Matt. 1:23 of the King James
Bible.

So far so good!

What, then, about the opening dialogue in 'The Tempest'?

Enter a Ship-master, and a Boteswaine. = 15661
Master:
Bote-swaine. = 6016
Boteswaine:
Heere Master: What cheere? = 10964
Master:
Good: Speake to th' Mariners: fall too 't, yarely, = 18692
Or we run our selues a ground, bestirre, bestirre. [Exit. = 27209 =
78542

Bull's eye!

For this mirrors the Cipher Sum 45319 - 1 + 11931 + 25920 - 4627 =
78542, where 45319 = The Zodiac* above is held to be projected onto
Earth below through;

- 1 = Monad's transformation into

11931 = Saga-Shakespeare Cipher Key** alias 'hidden light' for the
duration of

25920 = A Platonic Great Year; with the &quot;exit&quot; of

- 4627 = Francisco [see my post at 1:39 pm]

concluding the Creative Process launched by God's command, Let there be
light.

* Twelve Houses of the Zodiac are:
Leo-Virgo-Libra-Scorpio-Sagittarius-Capricornus = 24629
Aquarius-Pisces-Aries-Taurus-Gemini-Cancer. = 20690 = 45319

** Einar Pálsson began the second paragraph of his 1969 presentation
of the world-view of Iceland's 9th-century settlers as follows:

&quot;Numerology resides in the world. Men safeguard that numerology in
letters that are called runes.&quot;

The ancients are here construed to have viewed numerology as an
attribute of the Divine Presence at the level of Microcosmic
MAN-Beast's Psyche; as one with the Light that is Emmanuel and, when
interpreted, God With Us.

The Cipher Value of the Saga-Shakespeare Cipher Key itself is the sum
of its components, A = 73; B = 116; C = K; D/Ð = 225; E = 228; F =
285; G = 325; H = 376; I/J/Y = 425; K = 449; L = 504; M = 542; N = 569;
O = 660; P = 683; Q = 770; R = 821; S = 896;T/Þ = 923; U/V = 949; X =
1018; Z = 1094 as in

73 + 116 + 225 + 228 + 285 + 325 + 376 + 425 + 449 + 504 + 542 + 569 +
660 + 683 + 770 + 821 + 896 + 923 + 949 + 1018 + 1094 = 11931.

The Workes of William Shakespeare

In Shakespeare Myth, as here construed, the imagery of ancient Creation
Myth which Iceland's Norse and Irish 9th-century settlers brought with
them to the New Land was re-cast through the personification of
'deformed first heire' of William Shakespeare's 'inuention' as
Stratfordian Gulielmus, filius Johannes Shakspeare alias Will Shakspere
gent, alias

16160 = 'Tygers hart wrapt in a players hyde' during

25920 = A Platonic Great Year, with Light of the World/Emmanuel/God
With Us breaking free of the fetters of Time and Space alias

- 4627 = Francisco; through transformation by metamorphosis into

4000 = Flaming Sword at

100 = The End, as in

16160 + 25920 - 4627 + 4000 + 100 + 262237* = 303790.**

* The Cipher Value of the First Folio's introduction of

Hamlet's my favorite play. I fell in love with it during my senior year
at Princeton, and since then I have learned a few things about
Shakespeare's longest work. The tragedy has been translated and
performed more than any other play in the entire world, and more has
been written about it than any other literary work--more than any other
printed work other than the Bible. Over forty-five movie productions of
the play have been made, and the line &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; is the most
quoted phrase in the English language. The thundering words have
inspired twenty-six ballets, six operas, and dozens of musical works
from composers including Tchaikovsky and Liszt. About playing the
character Hamlet in his 1990 production, Mel Gibson said, &quot;Then
there're the lines. I know them. I've read them so many times. I go to
sleep thinking about them, but the character is so confusing. It
doesn't matter how many times you nail him or you think you've nailed
him. It's the most elusive thing. Every time you go back to it, there's
something else there which completely negates what you were thinking
about before.&quot; Holden Caufield called Hamlet a &quot;sad, screwed-up kind of
a guy,&quot; and Orson Welles said, &quot;What Hamlet is, before he is anything.
. .is an authentic tragic hero who is himself a man of genius. And once
Shaksepeare had written him he never wrote about a man of any genius at
all again. . . Once he'd written Hamlet and discovered that there was
no actor who could play him. . . he turned to something else.&quot;

But the way I see it is that it wasn't so much that Hamlet was sad and
screwed up, nor that Hamlet was confused, but rather that he was
brilliantly honest within a kingdom where Christian honesty was
considered an enemy. Hamlet realized the dark ironies of his
predicament--he saw that in such an inverted Kingdom, his perceptive
sanity would be considered madness, so he feigned madness so as to
throw the suspecting, murderous King and his cronies off the trail of
his deeper intents of retribution for his father's murder. But the
irony of Hamlet's predisposition--to avenge the murder of his father
while remaining a Christian--debilitated him, and thus he ended his &quot;To
be or not to be,&quot; soliloquy with &quot;Thus conscience doth make cowards of
us all.&quot; Hamlet was trying his best to be a noble Christian in a
corrupted, inverted world, and he could find no mechanism of avenging
his father's death and achieving justice which was wholly compatible
with his Christian sentiments.

There's a lot of talk about the irony and cynicism which pervades this
generation, and more often than not, it's discussed in terms which
obscure its source, as so often those who are discussing it are the
same intellectual elite who are promoting it--those who have the most
to gain by it. They know what's up--they know they're guilty of a
thousand thousand desecrations and deconstructions, but since honest
reality means nothing to them, they project the fogs of irony and
cynicism upon you, in an attempt to cloak their foul deeds. It has
become fashionable to muddy one's waters so as to appear deeper, but
the source of the cynicism and irony in this postmodern world can be
summed up quite simply and succinctly--it is watching President Shapiro
at Princeton embrace a pornographer and murderess of the Great Books
like Joyce Carol Oates as the supreme literary figure, amidst great
pomp and circumstance, fanfare, and flowing academic gowns. A thousand,
thousand parallels to this central source may be found throughout the
greater culture, from the corrupt character of the President of this
great nation on down to the pornographic &quot;art&quot; exhibits where tax
payers are forced to fund the desecration of the Virgin Mary with
elephant dung and clippings of female genitalia.

Is it any wonder that in such a debased context, those who wish for
more, those with classical ideals and noble aspirations, seem cynical
in the face of the debauched reality? Nay, I know not seems, for we are
realistic--the rising generation sees the popular literary culture as
it is has been foisted upon us.

How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
-Hamlet I,ii (William Shakespeare)

Just as the villainous murder of Hamlet's father was followed by
tragedy throughout Denmark's kingdom, our culture's fallen entities are
but symptoms of the postmodernist's murder of Faith. What President
Shapiro and Joyce Carol Oates together represent, sitting upon
academia's highest thrones, are all of postmodernism's darkest, most
convoluted ironies--words don't mean anything, symbolism is more
important than substance, God is dead and money is all, crass
commercialism is better than common sense, Wall Street and Silicon
Valley are for the best and brightest while literature is an
intellectual charity, religion is but a myth no different than a Joyce
Carol Oates novel, except that the former is banned from public
schools, and apathy concerning God's greater order is a virtue, as it
allows big government economists to advance upon the people's freedoms.
It was upon that ivied campus that I first learned something is rotten
in Denmark.

One way to look at Hamlet that helps make the play less confusing is
as protagonist in the Big Picture. There have been versions of tragic
heroes in literature that are philosophical protagonists, not just for
some kind of themeatic or ideological thesis, but in the way of being
the modern superman, capable of representing &quot;man the marvel, working
out his destiny&quot; with regard to challenging devine fate and the Fall
from God's grace.

Again and again, we see some version of hero try to overcome his
predicament in a way that symbolizes the human predicament, with
tragic consequences. I think of Homer's versions of hero and how,
like Laocoon, Hamlet is caught up in dilemma of trying to serve two
different ideals. Lessing makes an aesthetic statement about that.
In the Old Testament, we see characters like Job who, like The
Merchant of Venice, try to rely on their original covenant, and are
tried and found guilty.

In renaissance lit we have the tragedy of Faust, who similarly
represents the modern version of protagonist attempting to be superman
independent of providence. In the 19th C. we have serious proponents
of superman by the likes of Nietzsche and similar others in music and
art. We have seen the political consequences of hero worship since.
In modern lit we have the likes of Raskolnikov in Crime and
Punishment, Ahab in Moby Dick, Holden Caulfield and brother Seemore in
Catcher in the Rye, etc..

I like the existentialist-type hero treatments in Kafka et al. Maybe
other central characters in post-modern literature who are not just
anti-heroes are versions of protagonists in the same arena of
predicament, but accept a limited definition in someone's thesis
treatment of an ideology, such as Ayn Rand's.

So what I am suggesting is that Hamlet is a protagonist of
Shakespeare's version of hero who symbolizes the human in predicament
terms. He has qualities of hero that make him representative of the
best. To what extent the rottenness in Denmark can represent modern
evil is questionable, but it's more than he can cope with without
becoming infected with the evil he discovers, he sickens, and can't
escape ongoing consequences of his actions.

It's in Hamlet's failure that Shakespeare seems to be showing us an
exestential view of Hamlet, especially through his interior
monologues, how his personal philosophy is tested and what survives as
a basis of meaningful affirmation in life. He does consider suicide
in a philosophical manner as part of the equation, as others such as
Donne were doing, and as commentators on the human predicament
typically do. At the level of viewing Hamlet as an instrument and an
agent of the plot, it's as if Shakespeare, the alchemist, is testing
some ingredients, seeing how they interact, and reporting the results
of an experiment.

So one way to read Hamlet is as hero in a modern human predicament
that tries a version of superman in a cosmic arena to see if he's a
prototype of the right stuff. bookburn

In my view, Prince Hamlet's soliloquy at the end of Act III, Sc. ii
summarizes the essence of Shakespeare's character:

'Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
O heart! lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom;
Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
How in my words soever she be shent,
To give them seals never, my soul, consent.

The imagery, I submit, concerns Cosmic Spirit's Incarnation in Nature -
&quot;cruel, not unnatural&quot; - alias advent of Microcosmic MAN-Beast as
&quot;mortal coil&quot; for the Psyche's Higher and Lower Emotions alike.

There ensues a &quot;war&quot; in Prince Hamlet's &quot;heart&quot;, whose termination is
the subject matter of the opening exchange between Hamlet and Horatio
in Act V, Sc. ii:

Hamlet:
So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
You do remember all the circumstance?
Horatio:
Remember it, my lord?
Hamlet:
Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
That would not let me sleep; methought I lay
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly, -
And prais'd be rashness for it, let us know,
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well
When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach us
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will.
Horatio:
That is most certain.

In the imagery of myth, &quot;indiscretion [which] sometimes serves us well&quot;
is the source of unremitting &quot;strife&quot; within MAN-Beast's Psyche/Heart
whereby Spirit/Divinity, mindful not to &quot;lose [its] nature&quot; despite
being &quot;Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day
confin'd to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in [its] days of
nature Are burnt and purg'd away&quot; [Ghost in Act I, Sc. v], plays along
with our Lower Emotions and - in &quot;hypocritical&quot; mode - acts &quot;naturally&quot;
while fanning the &quot;strife&quot; which, at play's end, causes 'The Mousetrap'
to snap shut, &quot;catching the conscience of the King&quot;.

In the vocabulary of myth, &quot;mouse&quot; is a &quot;thief&quot; which &quot;steals&quot; time
and, when there is no more &quot;time&quot; to be &quot;stolen&quot;, Spirit &quot;shuffles off&quot;
its MAN-Beast's spatio-temporal &quot;mortal coil&quot;. The King's &quot;conscience&quot;
is &quot;caught&quot; - the Prince has held up a &quot;glass&quot; wherein his Mother is
made to observe her &quot;inmost part&quot;. Etc. etc.

clix.
To say Hamlet is this, or Hamlet's that,
Is but to make an unscrupulous bet,
For his character wears more than one hat,
One can only say Hamlet is Hamlet.
So often people have it figured out,
They have ambition, feel a direction,
Of justices and truths they sing and shout,
Striving to build eternal erections,
Acting actions with sanctimonious pride,
They flaunt goodwill upon this stage,
So sure they've chosen the right side,
Confined within their own minds they are sage.
To make sense out of life so easily,
Just goes to show how little one does see.

Out in the Carolina countryside,
I left behind the things that weren't there,
The things in which the pedants take great pride.
I'm seeing that which astronomers miss,
Feeling what the deconstructionists hide,
An autumn walk, thinking about a kiss,
Knowing that I've got all I need inside.
A belief in God, a faith in the true,
The things which science needs you to disown,
Ineffable happiness, solemn rue,
The things without which nothing could be known.
Eternity's wisdom would not be heard,
Without poet soldiers wielding the word.

That isn't similar to the Book of Job. Job never mentions
&quot;Abraham's law.&quot; (I'm not half sure what you're talking

what to do with Job?) Job does say that he'd be judged

The opposite. Yahweh refuses to explain his ways -- which

The concept of &quot;distributive justice&quot; is what I have in mind. This
concerns receiving just deserts according to how upright you are as
prescribed in religious law. Job even tithes and sacrifices for his
sons in case they forget, etc.. Accordingly, Job is presummed guilty
by the judges because he has lost favor and been reduced to his pile
of ashes. Accordingly, when Job is restored to favor, he is made to
flourish.

In The Trial, Joseph K is not supposed to explore his accusation by
contesting his case and searching for evidence, but looking within
himself.

It's not a kiddy lit explanation, but deserves study because occasions
when God is shown to formally speak to man are not that often. You
have to go to Faust to find another circumstance when Satan and God
are shown in a frame tale referring to man. The Leviathon reference
seems very special. In Moby Dick, it's key to associate the White
Whale with the idea of Leviathon and the possibility of man
eliminating cosmic evil. bb

Well, in The Sound and the Fury, there doesn't seem to be any real
connection to the Garden of Eden, but then you realize it concerns
inheritance of what's left of the original grant of land on the Delta
where ancestors went for hunting/renewal and was inhabited by The
Bear/God. Turns out what's left is sold to be a golf course, where
the idiot tries to find his sister when they say, &quot;caddy.&quot;

At least, with Salinger and Faulkner we can be pretty sure we're
talking about the work of one author. At h.l.a.s. we sometimes
interpret as if writing can be attributed to more than one in a
collaboration, a group, a conspiracy, a time-spirit, an archytype

Deconstruction does not seek to find an absolute truth about a

One of the very curious things about attacks on &quot;postmodernism&quot;,
at least, those I read on Usenet, is that the attackers seldom
cite the offending texts or authors, but instead rely on either
handwaved indications of a vague host of evil spirits, or the
quotation or citation of such an indication which may have
been published somewhere. Particularly in the case of
&quot;postmodernism&quot; this habit makes it difficult to know what
the writer is talking about, because the category or whatever
it is is so ill-defined. The substance of the critiques
themselves do not identify any particular person or work:
skepticism about reason, the One True Truth, the significance
of history as written by the victors, and so on, go back to
antiquity, as does occasional obscurantist and fradulent
writing by scholars.

I'd like to see the complainers get down to facts and cases
if they are actually engaging facts and cases. Citing other
complainers is not what I'm talking about. If they're not,
I have to wonder what they are actually on about.

On the Princeton Seal is a shield with an open Bible engraved with VET

history of Princeton it is said, &quot;The college, which was erected and
fit for use in 1757, contained a chapel nearly forty feet square, with
a gallery in it, and an organ. In this hall or chapel there was public
worship on the Sabbath. . . These Sabbath assemblies congregated in the
college chapel for worship, attending to the preaching of the word of
God, from the lips of the early presidents, constituted the germ of the
Princeton Church.&quot; All this occurred about 200 years before the
creative writing workshop was invented to provide jobs for failed
liberal writers. In their mind's eye the founders of Princeton never
viewed the nightmare of Joyce Carol Oates murdering the Sacred under
your liberal reign of terror. What sober, conscientious Presbyterian
would have ever been inspired to lay one stone on top of another if he
knew that it would someday be used as a pulpit for a twisted,
embittered, fringe feminist to pen the following in her 1995 novel
entitled ZOMBIE:

On his April 17th President's page Shapiro writes, &quot;The moral
responsibilities of university presidents are no less important today
than they were in the past century, but they are a different sort.&quot; I'd
say. When Woodrow Wilson lead &quot;Princeton in the nation's service,&quot; the
university president's moral responsibilities didn't include raising
money to support sicko depictions of homosexual rape. That wasn't one

&quot;Postmodernism&quot; appears to be a stand-in for The Sixties, i.e.
the period in American life when the Civil Rights movement
disrupted and broke the old racial order. The comparative
success of this revolt which was not only against the state
but the dominant culture, was followed by many similar attempts
in other systems of social order, such as the hippie movement,
Women's Liberation, Gay Rights, and the anti-war movement,
among others. The skepticism and hostility to established
orders which &quot;postmodernism&quot; is supposed to embody is precisely
the skepticism and hostility about the established social order
which these movements challenged.

Many people, especially middle and upper class white males,
think they would have done a lot better in the world if the old
order were still in place. This is especially true of those
whose talents, skills and energies are less than first-rate.
But they can't say &quot;Let's rescind all this stuff, including
Civil Rights, and get back to the good old days when white men
were *white men*.&quot; That would cause a whole lot of trouble.
So &quot;postmodernism&quot; has to stand in. No, they haven't read
Derrida, and they're not going to. Derrida is not the point.

Bravo to both of you. Even when they do talk about texts, opponents of
a post-modernist interpretation cannot stand the thought that a text may
have more than one valid meaning. As you indicate, such opponents would
rather have one canonical interpretation spoon fed to them so that they
don't have to think. Maybe they associate free thinking with free sex
or something.

A typical postmodernist ''argument''. i.e. Pay no attention to the
arguments against postmodernism itself (that, for instance, it is
relativistic and self refuting). Instead attack opponents intelligence
(&quot;talents, skills and energies are less than first-rate&quot;) or moral
characters (they want to &quot;rescind all this stuff, including Civil
Rights, and get back to the good old days when white men were *white
men*.&quot;).

Oh, and lets not forget the irony of postmodernists, invariably moral
relativists, actually saying that they support civil rights. The only
''support'' they can offer is along the lines of &quot;Oh, I think that
slavery and racism is wrong, but thats just my opinion. Joe Blogs thinks
its ok and I can;t say any anything against that.&quot;

Oh, and yes I have read Derrida. But thats not the poiont.

A 20th-century philosopher (not necessarily &quot;postmodernist&quot;)
might want you to specify the frame of reference in which
the interpretations were to be evaluated.

For example, the substance and significance of Columbus's
activities look different depending on many prior evaluations
of the comparative rights and interests of the affected
parties.

&gt;&gt;&gt;writing by scholars.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd like to see the complainers get down to facts and cases
&gt;&gt;&gt;if they are actually engaging facts and cases. Citing other
&gt;&gt;&gt;complainers is not what I'm talking about. If they're not,
&gt;&gt;&gt;I have to wonder what they are actually on about.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Postmodernism&quot; appears to be a stand-in for The Sixties, i.e.
&gt;&gt; the period in American life when the Civil Rights movement
&gt;&gt; disrupted and broke the old racial order. The comparative
&gt;&gt; success of this revolt which was not only against the state
&gt;&gt; but the dominant culture, was followed by many similar attempts
&gt;&gt; in other systems of social order, such as the hippie movement,
&gt;&gt; Women's Liberation, Gay Rights, and the anti-war movement,
&gt;&gt; among others. The skepticism and hostility to established
&gt;&gt; orders which &quot;postmodernism&quot; is supposed to embody is precisely
&gt;&gt; the skepticism and hostility about the established social order
&gt;&gt; which these movements challenged.

&gt;&gt; Many people, especially middle and upper class white males,
&gt;&gt; think they would have done a lot better in the world if the old
&gt;&gt; order were still in place. This is especially true of those
&gt;&gt; whose talents, skills and energies are less than first-rate.
&gt;&gt; But they can't say &quot;Let's rescind all this stuff, including
&gt;&gt; Civil Rights, and get back to the good old days when white men
&gt;&gt; were *white men*.&quot; That would cause a whole lot of trouble.
&gt;&gt; So &quot;postmodernism&quot; has to stand in. No, they haven't read
&gt;&gt; Derrida, and they're not going to. Derrida is not the point.

&gt; A typical postmodernist ''argument''. i.e. Pay no attention to the
&gt; arguments against postmodernism itself (that, for instance, it is
&gt; relativistic and self refuting). Instead attack opponents intelligence
&gt; (&quot;talents, skills and energies are less than first-rate&quot;) or moral
&gt; characters (they want to &quot;rescind all this stuff, including Civil
&gt; Rights, and get back to the good old days when white men were *white
&gt; men*.&quot;).

&gt; Oh, and lets not forget the irony of postmodernists, invariably moral
&gt; relativists, actually saying that they support civil rights. The only
&gt; ''support'' they can offer is along the lines of &quot;Oh, I think that
&gt; slavery and racism is wrong, but thats just my opinion. Joe Blogs thinks
&gt; its ok and I can;t say any anything against that.&quot;

&gt; Oh, and yes I have read Derrida. But thats not the poiont.

"/>

I can't refute an argument unless one is given in a coherent form.
Since the terms &quot;postmodernism&quot; and &quot;postmodernist&quot; are extremely
vague, it is necessary to cite specific authors and show, if you
wish, that some passage they wrote is &quot;relativistic and self-
refuting&quot; and that this is bad. (Personally, I like self-refuting
arguments because then I don't have to go to the trouble of getting
rid of them.) To my knowledge, you haven't done any of that. Nor
do you show any evidence of having read Derrida -- not that I care.

Your second paragraph, about the irony of moral relativists
supporting Civil Rights, is naive. One may support Civil Rights
for many different reasons, including personal, subjective or
relativistic ones. Such support may be all the more vigorous
and determined because it does not count on the gods or some
ultimate order of things. One might note that the god and
ultimate order of things people did nothing about racism for
several centuries, except participate in it and enjoy it. One
wonders if they had a hot line to the absolute why they didn't
get the word that it was not so nice sooner.

In any case, I was not responding to what you wrote, which was
a recitation of too often seen cliches, but to what G*rd*n wrote
about the curious scapegoating of what is, after all, a pretty
obscure set of literary and aesthetic theories. I think that's
an interesting question.

Just because one weighs values relatively depending on the situation (do
you remember Fletcher?) does not mean that one cannot make value
judgments. It is simply a refusal to make any one principle so rigid
that one would kill for it. Moral relativists find moral absolutists to
be the most dangerous people in the world. As people who actually go
through the thought process in analyzing the relative value of issues,
moral relativists are more likely to be those who support civil rights.

I second this reply. Besides, your &quot;better&quot; implies applying to the
analysis process an unanalyzed set of values by which the text shall be
judged.

Let's actually take a couple of texts, if you will.

1. John Buchan, Prester John. This story is set in about 1900 and is
told from the colonial perspective. A young Scots man goes to what is
now probably Zimbabwe, foils an insurrection of the blacks against the
whites, and becomes rich on jewels purloined from the local populace.
Read in 1910 in England, it was a popular adventure story, because it
reflected the values of the times. Read now, it is a deep embarrassment
to the colonial mentality that produced it. Would you prefer the
original, first interpretation?

2 . Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps. The story is again an early
20th C master narrative text. A Cuban man, an adventurer, finds a
paradise in the Venzuelan jungle, but on trying to come back, he cannot
again locate what he had found before, Viewed one way, it tells of the
impossibility of achieving heaven on earth despite the power of the
&quot;white&quot; adventurer. Viewed in a more modern light, the failure of the
facts to meet the assertions of the first person narrator undermines the
attempt at master narrative and suggests that the narrative is false to
begin with. This requires then a re-evaluation of the assertions and
principles of the narrator. This draws into question the values of
colonial ism. Did Carpentier &quot;intend&quot; such an interpretation? Does it
matter whether he did or not? Cuba, after all, was in the
psychologically precarious position of colony and exporter of
colonialism. Maybe, the ambiguity and deconstrivitve effect of the text
results from a deep awareness of this fact.

Your comments on these texts are welcome.

Just to note that the latter interpretation may require more care in

the importance of compassion and social justice (and, as well, to

complacency: the idea that we have already overcome all inequality and
that we may congratulate ourselves on having attained the height of
&quot;civilization.&quot; (And it is quite possible to address the same
questions with a rather traditional, more traditionally

And so it is that during the postmodern liberal reign of terror, the
university and the literary industry have both known decline. It is no
mystery that they have shared in the same fate. Both the university and
the literary culture are built with the brick of the printed word, and
without a humble acknowledgement of God's supreme, omnipotent,
ubiquitous divinity, the printed word lacks authority, and the bricks
crumble to sand. The ivory tower of Babel might seem higher today then
fifty years ago, with bigger football stadiums, and larger, more
gallant administrations replete with lawyers, with more departments and
courses and computers and technology transfer programs, but the cause
of the univerity is lost somewhere in-between the widening fissure
between the English and Physics departments. C.P. Snow's two cultures
have become twenty, with as many languages, and while we reach for the
heavens and probe the atom, we begin to find our most fundamental
essence, the printed words of our heritage, drifting beyond our grasp.
In the beginning there was the Word, and in the end there wasn't, some
might say, but I contend that in the beginning there was the Word, and
so too shall it be again. At least upon the world's largest campus.

The postmodern press remains oblivious to the decline, as postmodernism
conveniently deconstructs the very ruler by which one might guage
aesthetic quality, and thus there is no way for them to measure the
fall. They commandeered the scientific method, and left the true spirit
of science behind, which demands that one remain absolutely loyal to
reality. And science can never be loyal to the reality of the printed
word, for it cannot discern it.

Some of the elder postmodernists have attempted to project their
gnawing emptiness upon us with the belittling &quot;generation-x, slacker,
grunge&quot; monikers, but I contend that inspite of their command of the
universities and presses, we're awakening to a renaissance. Time shall
let us speak for ourselves. Deconstructing the greats was futile, and
the misled, condescending academics only succeeded in deconstructing
their own souls. For Shakespeare still exists within our immortal
spirits. Many of the aging liberal elite might have been agile in
subterfuge, or skillful with a slander, or good at, &quot;hiding one thing
in the depths of his heart, while speaking forth another.&quot; They might
have been deft with hermeneutics theory, and dextrous with
deconstruction, but none of these intellectual vices nor treacheries
are honored by time. They are honored but by bureaucracy.

Those who truly understand the nature of vital creativity, the
principles of rugged individualism, the foundations of freedom, and the
basis of intellectual integrity, spend their lives out-running the
relentless, plodding, machinations of bureaucracy, and we hope they
find a haven of encouragement at Western Canon University. There shall
always exist the perpetual rift between the artist and the
administrator. Both will consider the other one to be arrogant, to be
deceitful, and to be dishonest. Both shall wish to be given credit for
the same entities, but the difference is that whereas one shall forever
seek the credit by commandeering it, the other shall seek credit by
creating it.

And so it is that Western Canon University has come to be. Once upon a
time the scientific spirit was utilized to degrade the Greats and exalt
the postmodern bureaucracy, but now the tide has turned, and modern
science's offspring, the WWW, is allowing us to resurrect the context
of the Greats. For while science is at heart indifferent, man's
immortal soul is not, and it must forever seek the nobler path.

Ten years ago we set out upon a journey to acquaint ourselves with the
greatest that had ever been thought and said, and now, ten years later,
we find ourselves in the midst of a renaissance rooted in the printed
word. As poets and authors coming of age at the end of the second
millenium, we came to realize that a modern cultural context for
contemporary Great Literature was lacking. So in addition to composing
new works, we have also found it necessary to create a context in which
they can take root and blossom. The WWW has presented the ideal tool
for this. These simple sentiments and yearning for traditional values
in both our lives and our literature, shared by the free-thinkers
throughout the world, have given birth to the world's largest literary
journal and the world's most-active literary cafe, and thus we have
reason to believe that God willing, our sentiments might also beget the
world's greatest university.

Once upon a time there were only editors who might have rejected a
young author's Great Book, but today they receive diligent help from
scores of postmodern literary agents and agencies who blossomed
overnight in the wake of the dumbing down of literature, which now, in
this liberated age, can be anything. The desperate corporate publicists
hype the gratuitous glitz, publishing and promoting the Howard Sterns
and Dennis Rodmans and Sapphires, and with the decline money they make
off of soft porn, gossip, and new-age advice, they then massage their
literary egoes by attempting to create literary authors of all genders,
races, and sexual orientations. They funnel the soft-porn money into
marketing campaigns for indecipherable literary tomes such as Pynchon's
Lewis and Clark and Foster's Infinite Jest, complete with carboard
cutout displays for the Barns and Noble debut. Once a year they happen
upon a Cold Mountain and decide to publish it, and things are cool for
awhile, but still, Cold Mountain falls short of affecting the
prevailing postmodern attitude, for it forgets to fulfill its
contemporary literary duty and acknowledge the present. More often than
not the publishers print huge, meandering books, reveling in
postmodernism's pernicious, immature inside joke, mocking the
sensibilities of their customers, denying them the importance of their
Reality, flooding the market with literary mediocrity, crying wolf a
thousand thousand times, desparately filling the back covers with
soundbites of exquisite praise that would have made Shakespeare proud,
and then, when they have finished with their thorough desecration and
blatant hucksterism, they resort to claiming that the American public
is too backward to enjoy the indecipherable trash. But instead of
purchasing the stillborn books, the American public is logging onto the
internet, where they have the hopes of finding something that didn't
have to first make it on by a gauntlet of ten self-appointed postmodern
literary experts. And out here they're finding the WWW literary
renaissance.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or something.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nate Fryer &lt;natefr ... @yahoo.com.au&gt;:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(Speaking generally) I believe the point is whether one interpretation
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is *better* than another not whether there are multiple interpretations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;A 20th-century philosopher (not necessarily &quot;postmodernist&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt;might want you to specify the frame of reference in which
&gt;&gt;&gt;the interpretations were to be evaluated.

&gt;&gt;&gt;For example, the substance and significance of Columbus's
&gt;&gt;&gt;activities look different depending on many prior evaluations
&gt;&gt;&gt;of the comparative rights and interests of the affected
&gt;&gt;&gt;parties.

&gt;&gt;I second this reply. Besides, your &quot;better&quot; implies applying to the
&gt;&gt;analysis process an unanalyzed set of values by which the text shall be
&gt;&gt;judged.

&gt;&gt;Let's actually take a couple of texts, if you will.

&gt;&gt;1. John Buchan, Prester John. This story is set in about 1900 and is
&gt;&gt;told from the colonial perspective. A young Scots man goes to what is
&gt;&gt;now probably Zimbabwe, foils an insurrection of the blacks against the
&gt;&gt;whites, and becomes rich on jewels purloined from the local populace.
&gt;&gt;Read in 1910 in England, it was a popular adventure story, because it
&gt;&gt;reflected the values of the times. Read now, it is a deep embarrassment
&gt;&gt;to the colonial mentality that produced it. Would you prefer the
&gt;&gt;original, first interpretation?

&gt;Just to note that the latter interpretation may require more care in
&gt;one's approach to it. While someone inclined to this latter
&gt;interpretation would probably be inclined to stress, to his or her
&gt;naturally predominantly white, upper-middle class, privileged students,
&gt;the importance of compassion and social justice (and, as well, to
&gt;minority students who may be the first in their families to attend
&gt;college, a kind of pride in their own society's increasing attention to
&gt;their requirements), it can also tend towards triumphalism or
&gt;complacency: the idea that we have already overcome all inequality and
&gt;that we may congratulate ourselves on having attained the height of
&gt;&quot;civilization.&quot; (And it is quite possible to address the same
&gt;questions with a rather traditional, more traditionally
&gt;literary-quality text.)

&gt;(Disclaimer: For one reason or another, my confrontations with
&gt;postmodern literary analysis have mostly involved applications to this
&gt;kind of historical, inter-cultural conflict; although at the time I
&gt;attempted to read enough theory to attempt -- mostly unsuccessfully --
&gt;to understand what they were doing, exactly, my subsequent attempts to
&gt;read about theory have been spotty, and have started from a place
&gt;possibly even more inimical to the culture of literary studies than
&gt;this social-science like emphasis on colonialism and its literature. I
&gt;also prefer Foucault to Derrida, no matter how many times I remind
&gt;myself this is wrong. So sue me, I don't know what I'm doing. My
&gt;confrontations with literature studies themselves have almost all been
&gt;on such a rudimentary level that theory was not even mentioned, so for
&gt;all I know the instruction was as naive of theory as my own exam essays
&gt;must have been.)

&gt;&gt;2 . Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps. The story is again an early
&gt;&gt;20th C master narrative text. A Cuban man, an adventurer, finds a
&gt;&gt;paradise in the Venzuelan jungle, but on trying to come back, he cannot
&gt;&gt;again locate what he had found before, Viewed one way, it tells of the
&gt;&gt;impossibility of achieving heaven on earth despite the power of the
&gt;&gt;&quot;white&quot; adventurer. Viewed in a more modern light, the failure of the
&gt;&gt;facts to meet the assertions of the first person narrator undermines the
&gt;&gt;attempt at master narrative and suggests that the narrative is false to
&gt;&gt;begin with. This requires then a re-evaluation of the assertions and
&gt;&gt;principles of the narrator. This draws into question the values of
&gt;&gt;colonial ism. Did Carpentier &quot;intend&quot; such an interpretation? Does it
&gt;&gt;matter whether he did or not? Cuba, after all, was in the
&gt;&gt;psychologically precarious position of colony and exporter of
&gt;&gt;colonialism. Maybe, the ambiguity and deconstrivitve effect of the text
&gt;&gt;results from a deep awareness of this fact.

&gt;That sounds a fascinating text. I'd love to see what a postmodernist
&gt;critic might make of it.

&gt;But anyway, how would a traditional approach to a text as labyrinthine
&gt;as this one look? One would want to read about traditions in Latin
&gt;American literature, early tendencies towards what became &quot;magical
&gt;realism,&quot; in many writers including Borges, about the common cultural
&gt;and social struggles of the people of Cuba during the previous century,
&gt;and so forth, about the ways traditional themes were expressed in that
&gt;particular time and place. Presumably a postmodernist tries to read
&gt;the text without all this mental formation, as if it were no more
&gt;difficult than a Crichton thriller, ignoring all the &quot;colonialist&quot;
&gt;stuff, as if that element were present for no good reason at all.

&gt;&gt;Your comments on these texts are welcome.

&gt;Not sure whether this is the kind of comment you were asking for.

&gt;----
&gt;Bianca Steele

"/>

Absolutely! All very good comments. As to whether a postmodernist
would ignore the colonialist stuff, that would depend on the text, I
think. If the text were devoid of it, yes, because then the text would
not support that as a valid interpretation. But if in the text there
are indicators - e.g. , attitude toward people living in a country being
explored - then such an approach may be viable.

Example. In Garcia Marquez' novel &quot;Love in the Time of the Cholera&quot;,
Doctor Juvenal, a privileged white Columbian, has a frenetic affair with
a black woman. He parks his carriage blocks away and sneaks to her
house. Eventually, his wife finds out, and she confronts him as he is
sitting on the porch reading Anatole France's &quot;Penguin Island&quot;. The
point is what he is reading. In Penguin Island, France has a nearly
blind monk set out to prosletyze the word of god. The devil blows his
boat off course and he lands on an island of penguins, which he starts
baptizing. This sets off a debate in heaven about whether penguins have
immortal souls, can they go to heaven, etc. This is the very debate
that occurred in Spain during the conquest, except that the object of
the debate was the people of south and central america. Sepulveda was
one of the participants in a famous theological debate on this point.
He argued the natives had no soul and won the debate. So by using the
title of the book, Garcia Marquez imports into the way that Dr. Juvenal
treats the black woman all the history of oppression that went before.

&gt;&gt; So, you condone a return to ignorance and sophism then?- for these are
&gt;&gt; the values that postmodernism serves:

&gt;&gt;&quot;Then, too, one finds a stunning array of anti-Enlightenment
&gt;&gt; phantasmagoria congregated under the banner of &quot;anti-positivism.&quot; The
&gt;&gt; idea that history is a &quot;myth,&quot; that the truths of science are merely
&gt;&gt;&quot;fictions&quot; dressed up in forbidding clothes, that reason and language
&gt;&gt; are powerless to discover the truth -- more, that truth itself is a
&gt;&gt; deceitful ideological construct: these and other absurdities are now
&gt;&gt; part of the standard intellectual diet of Western intellectuals.&quot;

&gt;&gt; ( http://www.newcriterion.com/archive/11/dec92/treason.htm )

&gt; One of the very curious things about attacks on &quot;postmodernism&quot;,
&gt; at least, those I read on Usenet, is that the attackers seldom
&gt; cite the offending texts or authors, but instead rely on either
&gt; handwaved indications of a vague host of evil spirits, or the
&gt; quotation or citation of such an indication which may have
&gt; been published somewhere. Particularly in the case of
&gt;&quot;postmodernism&quot; this habit makes it difficult to know what
&gt; the writer is talking about, because the category or whatever
&gt; it is is so ill-defined. The substance of the critiques
&gt; themselves do not identify any particular person or work:
&gt; skepticism about reason, the One True Truth, the significance
&gt; of history as written by the victors, and so on, go back to
&gt; antiquity, as does occasional obscurantist and fradulent
&gt; writing by scholars.

&gt; I'd like to see the complainers get down to facts and cases
&gt; if they are actually engaging facts and cases. Citing other
&gt; complainers is not what I'm talking about. If they're not,

This will have to do, Google is a bear these days:

There are several points in many people's lives where they
undergo a radical shift in intuition about their physical
environment. One is where they learn that the Earth is
round, as well as flat; another is learning that the Earth
is not only fixed, but also moves through space. But these
usually occur in childhood, and are not always remembered.
Learning about General Relativity, which involves a similar
shift (unless it is understood only as a succession of
symbols) may be recent enough to be better remembered. In
no case is anything about &quot;reality&quot; proved. It's easy to
demonstrate that &quot;objective reality&quot; is superfluous; I'm

Sigh. The author is saying that the world is experienced and
dealt with in several different ways, and that these supersede
one another as one grows up and learns about the world and
what other people think about it. This is hardly an earth-
shattering invention of postmodernists.

(Actually they are superimposed on one another, which seems
much more &quot;pomo&quot; to me, but I guess I digress.)

I would think you would be able to find at least one flat-out
nutcase who asserts that the world _is_ flat, not that the
world is flat in certain frames of experience and thought,
which is obviously the case whether you believe in objective
reality or not.

Of course that person would have to be a true believer in
objective reality to step on the _is_ that hard, so he or she
wouldn't be very postmodernistic, objectively speaking.

David Foster Wallace was a postmodernist:

His books suck.

His teaching sucks.

His books ramble on and on, sans plot, character, and meaning.

He rambles on and on, sans plot, character, and meaning:

he sucks as a human being. His approach to writing is comparable to a
****'s strategy on a street corner: get attention in order to spread
the disease that is modern society.

DFW sucks. Completely narcissistic. He failed to give constructive
feedback since he was so busy going off on tangents about himself/his
own writing.

I took this class because of Prof. Wallace's reputation as an author.
What a mistake! This guy just likes to hear himself talk, and he won't
shut up. He knows how to play the part of a enigmatic &quot;genius&quot; all
right, but most of my classmates were

&gt;&gt; Let's actually take a couple of texts, if you will.
&gt;&gt; 1. John Buchan, Prester John. This story is set in about 1900 and
&gt;&gt; is told from the colonial perspective. A young Scots man goes to what
&gt;&gt; is now probably Zimbabwe, foils an insurrection of the blacks against
&gt;&gt; the whites, and becomes rich on jewels purloined from the local
&gt;&gt; populace. Read in 1910 in England, it was a popular adventure story,
&gt;&gt; because it reflected the values of the times. Read now, it is a deep
&gt;&gt; embarrassment to the colonial mentality that produced it. Would you
&gt;&gt; prefer the original, first interpretation?

&gt; Yes, because it is the honest interpretation.

"/>

It is also an honest interpretation to see the young Scots man as hostile to
black people, even to the point of denying them the right of self determination,
and greedy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; 2 . Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps. The story is again an early
&gt;&gt; 20th C master narrative text. A Cuban man, an adventurer, finds a
&gt;&gt; paradise in the Venzuelan jungle, but on trying to come back, he
&gt;&gt; cannot again locate what he had found before, Viewed one way, it
&gt;&gt; tells of the impossibility of achieving heaven on earth despite the

&gt;&gt; draws into question the values of colonial ism. Did Carpentier

&gt; Yes. Absolutely and utterly.

"/>

Carpentier is dead now. So all we have to determine what he meant are the works
themselves. In fact, most artists cannot and will not tell you what their works
mean. The work IS the expression of what the artist means. You have to find
the meaning in the frame of the work itself.

Then there are those like Umberto Eco who will lie to you when asked about what
something means. See his &quot;Postscript to the Name of the Rose&quot;, where he says
that people are always asking him about the meaning of the title. He replies
that it means nothing, that he always felt that a title should have no
relationship to the book so as not to compel a reader into a particular
interpretation. He is lying. As the consummate medievalist, he is, of course,
aware of the long, erotic and symbolic epic poem &quot;The Romance of the Rose&quot; by
Jean de Meung and Willaume de Lorris. And, he is also aware of the critical
essay written against it, and taking the conservative church point of view, by
Christiane de Pisan entitled &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;. If I am aware of them, it
is only because in the realm of medieval writing, they are very well known. So,
of course Eco was thinking of them when he entitled his novel &quot;The Name of the
Rose&quot;. And just look at the last line of the novel: &quot;Rosa in nomine stat
pristina.&quot; A dual reference to the symbology of language and to the Rose again.
No, when he told the world what he intended, he deliberately lied. Why?
Because the work has to stand on its own. You have to use the hidden keys in it
to interpret it. (And in The Name of the Rose, the big key is the prologue
itself. But I stray too far.)

There is a current writer who writes her novels and short stories. There is an
expert in literary criticism who writes articles about the meaning of this
author's works. The author once said to the critic, I wish I understood what I
write as well as you do, then I could say it as straight forward as you do.

So, no, I do not think you can declare what the author &quot;intended&quot;. I do think,
however, you can interpret what he put between the covers of the book.

Dear fellow readers,

I commend to you the post below as a good example of the level on which
anti-post-modernists launch their attack. I suggest that it illustrates the
weakness of the opposition's case in its very structure and level of discourse.
It reminds me of Browning's &quot;Soliloquy in a Spanish Cloister&quot; where the first
person narrator speaks mostly about the object of his hate (another monk) but
what you really learn about is the monk doing the hating.

He does not appear well read and might suffer from a chronic

Has he gotten to Lawrence Norfolk? Norfolk is about the

Because Eco is classified as a postmodernist, among other things, and

way, I would agree that his 'lie' is less of a lie and more of a hint
that there are multiple interpretations of the title rather than just
one. Perhaps a 'rose' also hints at medieval aesthetic theory of beauty
or even a rose window--don't remember if one is mentioned in the novel.

I found another quote at least on the web from Eco that 'the rose is a

meaning left.'

By the way, not all critics believe that the author's intent is not
important. I'm sure that historicists, even though they often focus
more on politics and economics, would agree that an author's intent and
biography can shed light on possible interpretations of that person's
work.

And of course, history is just another text that could be biased,

Yes, because using his theories to interpret is one interpretation, but
there could be others that are completely unrelated to his ideas. But
that's a poststructuralist approach (which Deconstructionism actually

<POSTDATE> 2005-06-17T07:21:00 </POSTDATE>

As a dead poet it is quite an honor to be composing this dedication
for The Tragedy of Drakeraft.com, a novel written by my good friend,
band-mate, and colleague, Dr. Elliot McGucken. And it is an even
greater honor to be dedicating it to all of you, the stalwart
crewmembers of jollyroger.com. I'm up here in Boone right now, setting
up our third Classicals Caf? in the North Carolina mountains, and I
hope to have all of ye over in the near future. The other night I was
testing out the sound system in front of a few friends, and here's an
MP3 of my reading the introductory sonnets from The After Dark Field
Book. To tell the truth, I'm not all that much into poetry readings, as
I've always thought that words are far more intimate when they're read
in silence--ye can print all the sonnets out from here. But if words
must be read within the Jollyroger.com Classicals Caf?s, then I say
they shall be endowed with rhyme and meter, and they shall mean things.
Just like how Guns 'n' Roses' words always did.

How my name ended up in the title The Tragedy of Drakeraft.com, and how
my semblance ended up as a character in the book is a good story in
itself. During the heights of the fleeting grunge era, our obligatory
Chapel Hill band was called Drake's Raft. Around that time, Elliot
wrote a story about the Great-Books secret society that we three
Midwesterners from fly-over country had founded at Princeton, and he
kind of infused the narrative with some cool events from a summer's
East-coast tour which landed us back on the Princeton campus, where we
played our final gig in McCarter Theater. During the tour I started
writing sonnets--I could get a lot more down in fourteen lines of
iambic pentameter than I could in a typical grunge ballad, and I found
the sonnet to offer a far more profound vessel for a poet's
thoughts--it made people think, whereas our songs had only ever made
them feel or something. And there's no quicker way to a girl's heart
than through her mind.

One night in Vermont, Elliot came across the notebook with the sonnets
that I had been keeping to myself, all four hundred of which are
published here. At first glance he had thought they were song lyrics.
Then, while reading them, he got this idea for a plot centered about a
Princeton student who is called upon to avenge the Greats. The story
was called The Drake Raft Field Trip, and it eventually evolved into an
epic based on Hamlet, wherein the Great Books had been murdered and
villainous kings in the form of fringe feminists and duplicitous
postmodernists had come to inhabit Princeton's cultural thrones. And it
was I, Drake Raft, who had been called upon to avenge the brutal murder
of the Greats. Elliot had probably chosen me because I'd been lead
singer in Drake's Raft.

As a cultural flagship of the greater society, and with a rich
scholarly heritage and great gothic architecture haunted by reputable
ghosts including those of Fitzgerald, Einstein, Feynman, Joseph Henry,
&quot;T.S. Eliot&quot;, &quot;Salinger,&quot; and Madison, Princeton provided an ideal
setting for such a novel. A major battle in the revolutionary war had
been fought just down the road from the main campus, and an American
canon ball is lodged in the stone walls of Nassau Hall--it was fired by
the rebel troops when the Redcoats had temporarily occupied the
building during the battle of Princeton, just like the postmodernists
are now temporarily occupying it. Couple the rich heritage with the
pristine campus and all the majestic spires and sinister gargoyles, and
Princeton becomes the ideal stage for a contemporary tragedy, as
tragedy must always have a most noble backdrop.

To personify the murder of the Great Books, the character of Uncle Walt
was brought in. Uncle Walt is based upon a distinguished, traditional
scholar who was ousted while we were at Princeton--he was more of a
soldier than a philosopher, and Princeton's postmodernists defeated him
and his noble vision via their typical underhanded demagoguery, aided
by their anonymous accomplices in the liberal press. In the novel, the
Nobel-prize winning, villainous Elizabeth Sycorax has murdered Uncle
Walt and replaced him at the helm of Princeton's English department,
which she has transformed into the Cultural Studies and Creative
Writing department. My character, Drake Raft, is a senior at Princeton,
and he is called upon by Uncle Walt's ghost to avenge his murder.
Knowing that the Princeton establishment would be watching my every
move, I feigned suicide and set up a website, drakeraft.com, while
contemplating the method and motivation of my vengeance. This is the
simple premise that lights the blazing glory of the book, and Elliot's
tome proceeds to encompass the center and circumference of the eternal
verities in the language of our generation-- a generation which the
boomer marketing elite have branded generation-x and generation-y or
whatever, but which I prefer to call the renaissance generation.

It would be difficult to compose a classic within the ever-shifting
context offered by the popular culture which is relentlessly
dumbed-down, idolaterized, and commodified by the dominant postmodern
media and academic institutions. All the fleeting brands trumpeted by
the &quot;savvy&quot; postmodern lawyers, accountants, vulture capitalists, and
marketing executives would already be long gone by the time the book
was published--at least ten blockbuster movies would have been raved
about and forgotten by the time it made it into print. Thus Elliot took
care to root The Tragedy of Drakeraft.com in the eternal context that
we are today building at jollyroger.com. This deeper context, defined
by the likes of Shakespeare, Jefferson, Moses, Salinger, and Twain,
shall always form the popular culture of the community of eternal
souls, and those who wish to join it must begin by honoring it. As a
dead poet myself, I have overheard a few truths spoken in this
heretofore undiscovered country--those poets who honor the Greats shall
in turn be honored by them, and those who forget the Greats shall be
forgotten.

As jollyroger.com's noble context naturally alienated the aging
literary elite who momentarily benefited in the wake of the Great's
desecration and deconstruction, we are fortunate to have the internet.
For without the WWW, it would have taken a much longer time to
circumnavigate the postmodern literati's waterlogged fleet so as to
sign aboard a vast, global audience. Even now, the elites' postmodern
disciples of opinionated mediocrity, who received their basic training
in the debilitating creative writing workshops, are blindly rushing
forth to become the officers aboard the sinking publishing houses and
within the government ministries of literature. And they would rather
continue sinking into the void of their vapid popular-porn-culture
while publishing their own profitless, meaningless, esoteric literature
than honestly profit by publishing and promoting our exalting
words--for the postmodernist truly believes that God is dead, and that
there are no higher laws, and that all is politics, and thus that their
nihilism can be equal to classical literature, just as long as they
party with the appropriate critics. But as Huckleberry Finn once said,
you can't pray a lie.

Because they saw no beauty in Shakespeare, because they were blind to
God's greater glory, it was easy for them to adopt their pseudo-
scientific view that literature is a political and economic entity
rather than an aesthetic one. In their debased, vitiated arena, where
they prophesized that all is politics and that words could hold no
intrinsic meaning, it became true for their own literature. And thus
there is no reason for us, nor for our children, to read their fading
fads. Instead, from this day forth, we shall take care to point the
kids towards Treasure Island and Huckleberry Finn.

As an artistic rendering of contemporary truths, The Tragedy of
Drakeraft.com pays full homage to the wild romance of lighting a fire
in postmodernism's infinite night. It's been an awesome rush launching
jollyroger.com and building the Classicals Cafes, while Windy and her
friends in architecture school up at MIT decorate them with all the
cool nautical stuff--personally I'm more into literature than
furniture. But just when it's getting dark out in the mountains on
these late November evenings, and I'm left alone with some old copies
of Shakespeare and Aristotle and Plato and some makeshift tables and
second-hand lamps in this run-down mountain mill, all of a sudden all
the old, mismatched furniture and rusty anchors and frayed ropes
transform themselves into classical antiques, and I find myself within
a castle. We just got our first shipment of coffee, and the aroma has
enhanced the late-night, lonely mystique, which haunts these words as I
set them down on my laptop, my fingers numb from the lack of heat. As
the shop is yet to open, she now exists in the perfect silent splendor
of a dream. This is the quiet before the show, and I almost fear to
touch it, but touch it we must. For we fall into love--we never rise
into it. If ye would like to run a Classicals Caf? of yer own, drop
me a line at d ... @jollyroger.com! We have been called upon to avenge
the deaths of our proverbial fathers embodied by the Great Books, and
our most wicked vengeance shall be a renaissance.

But as is often the case, for a fire to be lit, the match itself must
be spent. History hath shown that a cultural renaissance is never born
without revolutionary thinkers, and revolutionaries run great risks as
they go up against the aging power structure which cares nothing for
right nor wrong, but only for power itself. And thus there's the darker
side to all our lofty pursuits, but the most sublime romance hath
always been tinged with inherent danger. And that's why I, Drake Raft,
must meet my death within The Tragedy of Drakeraft.com. For I had set
out following those ultimate truths which lie somewhere beyond the
entrepreneur's ...

I'm not sure what Great Books Club you are talking about! The Great
Books Organization that I'm aware of is quite conservative, and almost
all of the writers in the standard series are white male, with quite a
few ancient Greeks. I think from looking at their web page that they
now add a female author here and there, and occasionally have a special
series on special themes, such as science or civil rights, but the
standard series is pretty much the same as before.

I attended such a club for about a year a few years ago, and our leader
was excellent, so I recommend it, but it is doubtful if you will read
any minority or postmodern literature!!

Poetry can only ever be anchored by institutionalized indifference and
aesthetic faithlessness; and besides, a little knowledge of linux will
transport one's work about the watery globe far more readily than an
entire army of contemporary marketers, agents, professors, and editors.
And how beautifully pristine and solitarily sublime it is out here
beside the ocean, on this sunny, warm November day, 'neath the Carolina
blue sky. I'll be grabbing my wetsuit and catching some wind just as
soon as I add the final touches to this site. How I wish ye could join
me.

It has been written that one cannot serve two masters, and thus
literature belongs to the readers and writers of poetry rather than to
the politicians, the deans and economist/administrators, and the
venture capitalists. For the type of classical poetry which I have come
out here seeking is far too valuable to be bought, sold, and traded; it
is granted by God within dreams rather than by startup financing or
within the pomp and circumstance of graduation ceremonies.

Although often discounted by bean counters, the will to truth is a most
valuable entity, for it pens poetry for free, and there is no material
force that can counter nor corrupt the philosopher/entrepreneur's
spirit. Following one's free spirit sometimes pays little or nothing at
all; thus few people can afford to work for poetry in a booming
economy, and that is what ultimately makes it so valuable. For
Microsoft owns the wondrous word processors and browsers, Cisco owns
the marvelous routers, Excite and others own the invaluable search
engines, Amazon.com owns the most efficient distribution centers and
the loyal customer base, Salon.com and Ivillage.com own the old-world
nihilism, and we own the words of the WWW RenaissanceTM.

With all the thousands of publishers and millions of dollars of
government grants and billions of dollars of venture capital with which
we're supposedly competing with out here on the net, how was it that
three poets came to own the World's Classical PortalTM? For a few
simple, complimentary reasons. First off, most venture capital firms
are only interested in short-term monetary gains, and so the creation
of everlasting poetry and literature does not show up on their radar.
Thus we have little or no competition from any well-financed sector.
And even if we did, their money would buy hype far more easily than it
would ever buy integrity and profundity of meaning, and thus even if
they wanted to, the venture capitalists could not create nor enhance
classical literature by investing in it. They are excluded from the
club. The poet alone can create literature by investing his spirit's
time. And though there is no pay for the initial labor, once a classic
is written, it gets free passage to all corners of this watery globe.
It must be known, it must be read, and only foolish, nihilistic tyrants
and vindictive feminists have ever tried to inhibit the Greats'
inevitable propagation.

Governments, by their very nature, prefer bureaucracy over art, and
thus their self-serving investment of other peoples' money usually
finances esoteric farces. And the contemporary publishing houses, lying
somewhere between the postmodern business gurus and the postmodern
socialists, naturally must harbor all the requisite postmodern
prejudices against the Greats--it is in their character to refrain from
passing the literary judgements that define and defend God's higher
aesthetics. But as is so often the case, the iron rails of their
political prejudices have become the iron bars of their prison. Thus it
is that the WWW RenaissanceTM is owned by the three sonneteers and the
tens of thousands who have signed their souls aboard jollyroger.com.

The individuals who &quot;thought differently&quot; have arguably produced the
greatest and most enduring wealth ever known to mankind. Some prominent
venture capitalists in Silicon Valley have recently mused that they
have been at the center of the greatest legal creation of wealth in
history, but really they have been at the center of the greatest
inheritance. Perhaps they have forgotten the giants upon whose
shoulders they have stood upon, including Newton, Einstein, Planck,
Bohr, Shockley, Galileo, Gauss, Brillouin, Rutherford, Schroedinger,
Faraday, Franklin, Jefferson, Washington, Madison, Hamilton, Moses,
Aristotle, Socrates, and all the countless souls and innovators who
labored for, studied, advanced, and sometimes gave their lives for the
Science and Truth which sets us free.

For the classics would exist without the internet, but the internet
would not exist without the classics. The robust free-market economy
would not exist were it not for The Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution, and in turn these documents would not exist were it not
for all the classical and biblical poetry which preceded them. Venture
capitalists, and the second-rate, superficial, rock'n'roll publishing
and university CEOs who seek to imitate them only to end up satirizing
them, are inextricably anchored to bottom lines. And all profound
innovations and renaissances only ever belong to the free
spirits--those who venture beyond money on towards the actual creation
of wealth's deeper meanings. The &quot;New New&quot; thing has ever been the
eternal.

Society's laser-like focus upon money is complimentary to
postmodernism's fierce focus upon &quot;ism&quot; politics, as while a
preoccupation with money neglects the higher ideals so as to focus upon
the bottom line, postmodernism's love affair with pure politics
neglects the higher laws so as to focus upon the postmodernist's
ephemeral egos. In both cases, this is bad for long-term business, for
as Huckleberry Finn once said, &quot;You can't pray a lie.&quot; Walk across a
college campus, and ye'll find that both the postmodern business
schools and the liberal humanists share an equal disregard for the
Great Books. Turn on the TV or pick up the daily paper, and ye won't
find an overabundance of rhymed reason nor philosophy profound. While
one could lament, like Hamlet, &quot;How all occasions do inform against
me,&quot; we instead see this classical dearth as a vast opportunity for
jollyroger.com to succeed as both a cultural and business venture. The
internet is revolutionizing all aspects of life, and as it is primarily
a medium of information in the form of the printed word, it makes sense
that it would allow the rising poets to revolutionize poetry. Simply
put, the demand for rhyming, metered poetry and contemporary words
reflecting the Permanent Profound is far, far higher than the supply,
and thus all stalwart literary sailors shall find ample work. For there
is nothing that a generation values more than living poetry carrying
eternity's meaning.

The internet eliminates the middlemen, and from a literary standpoint,
this means the creative writing workshops and all their infinite jest
and progeny in the form of postmodern agents, the editorial elite, and
the postmodern critics in the popular press. No longer must literature
be judged in their temporal, arbitrary, debased context, but now, out
here on the internet, literature has an opportunity to be judged in the
eternal context defined by the Great Books. And just like Rozencrantz
and Guildenstern met their early ends because of their short-sighted
choice to ingratiate and serve the evil king, so too is it that all the
middlemen who lived by brown-nosing the feminists and serving the egos
of the postmodern literary administrators shall sink on the postmodern
ship which they signed their souls aboard. 'Tis the nature of the
literary sport, mate. Wo to those who would cross paths with
Jollyroger.com's destiny.

There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
When in one line two crafts directly meet.-Hamlet III,iv (William
Shakespeare)
Some Shakespearean philosophy:

There's a deeper symmetry at the center and circumference of this
universe, and those who retain a faith in the eternal community of
souls, those who seek to serve something greater than their material
selves, shall come to own a piece of the WWW Renaissance. In the free
marketplace of ideas, the riches of Great Literature shall elude the
classically-indifferent software companies, the politicians, the
postmodern professors, the investment bankers, and the greater
abundance of editors and agents, while favoring the honest
individual--both the reader who reads to read, and the writer who
writes to write. Upon these hallowed American shores, where freedom has
always had a way of triumphing, freedom shall once again triumph in
poetry--her sublimer essence and form shall be liberated from the
postmodern monopoly.

The leveling postmodern worldview is highly seductive for people whose
talents are shadowed by their ambitions, and it is no mystery that
Nietzsche's postmodernism walks hand-in-hand with communism and
fascism, as both philosophies favor the razing of individual
characteristics, achievements, liberties, and independence. When words
mean nothing character cannot matter, for character cannot be defined.
Nor can prudence, virtue, justice, equality, nor art. Without words to
anchor their rational thoughts, men find themselves ruled more by
pleasure and pain than by logic and reason, and they are more easily
manipulated with shallow, superficial gestures and spurious shows of
sincerity. For a time the cultural boomers coasted along on borrowed
moral capital, supposing that morality descended from the divine
compassion of liberal bureaucrats, believing that children can raise
themselves, and convinced that the institutions which were
painstakingly erected by prior generations, which were designed to
enhance life, bestow liberty, and allow the pursuit of sober happiness,
could be replaced with secular forums, new-age self-help books,
divorce, daycare, talk-shows, welfare, lollapalooza, shrinks, lawyers,
astrologers, and Prozac.

It is little wonder that one often hears of promises failing to endure
in this postmodern age where the words by which they are made have been
declared to be meaningless. It is not surprising that relationships are
capricious in this Freudian era where we have cast aside society's
traditional, divine institutions while embracing and exercising our
baser inclinations. Administrators have convinced us that there is
little more to be known than administration, as courses on the Great
Books subside, while classes on administration abound, as if Man was
created to administrate administration. And all the while the leading
economic indicators mysteriously fail to characterize the rising demand
for traditional families and words that mean things. 'Tis why although
the economy is soaring, there is little inflation, for the products
that are most in demand, the Permanent Things, can never cost more, for
they are priceless. Value, like values, is ultimately rooted in
meaning, and the ultimate meaning derives not from money, but from God.
In spite of all this the Darwinian experts, economists, and dismal
scientists have declared that there is no more to life than the
production and accumulation of material possessions, that prosperity
should be measured by charts and tables and graphs, and that popular
entertainment should register only within our hearts and never in our
minds. But here upon the pristine campus of Western Canon University,
things are not so. Here we acknowledge that unfathomable, ungraspable
phantom of life. We acknowledge our immortal souls.

The renaissance is generated by humans.

Set sail searching for the land of meaning,
Where love endured and promises were kept,
Where God inspired the mystical dreaming,
Words captured secrets misty May nights wept.
Where character mattered, the truth triumphed,
A generation knew love once again,
By virtuous actions vile thoughts were trumped,
Late Misty May nights were captured in pen.
Rock'n'roll replaced by the rock of ages,
Contexts nobler than mere pictures and sound,
With Shakespeare, Melville, all the silent sages,
Eternal forms, the permanent profound.
Those things ye seek, ye'll find within yer will,
For that is where I found Kill Devil Hill.
