Optimal foraging theory provides a rudimentary explanatory framework for the
influence of microsociological food rites on dietary habits. Hunter/gatherer
behavior and the subsequent evolution of gustative and olfactory
chemoreception may have led to emergence of harvest festivals as collective
behavior, and to the cultural relevance of certain foods.

Ethnomethodological studies show that groups over large regions of North
America show a common preference for consuming roasted Meleagris gallopavo
at their harvest festival, which falls approximately two months after the
autumnal equinox. The meal rite is usually preceded by passive observation
of inter-male aggression, broadcast over the electromagnetic spectrum and
viewed on a large display device.

Meleagris gallopavo is typically prepared with a staple food inserted into
the animal's ventral cavity, most commonly crumbs made after baking a
mixture of ground Triticum aestivum and water aerated by the carbon dioxide
output of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Additional energy optimization stems from consuming partially liquefied
Solanum tuberosum or Ipomoea batatas mixed with emulsion of butterfat
globules obtained from lactation of female Bos taurus. Both tubers may be
consumed at the same festival.

The rite usually includes consumption of Vaccinium oxycoccus boiled in water
with alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-&gt;2)-beta-D-fructofuranose, often with the
grated outer rind or pressed juice of Citrus sinensis, and concludes with
participants passing and eating a baked food consisting of liquified
Cucurbita moschata poured over a shell of ground Triticum aestivum mixed
with water and hydrogenated vegetable oil.

Is it still a &quot;common preference&quot; if no individual member of the
family-group cares for the food, nor eats anything like that the rest
of the year?

Particularly the trans fat, where'd that come from - KFC??  Real
classy.  (Or did KFC cut out trans fats?)

i am a big believer that we crave foods for certain reasons.

When our bodies need IRON we crave spinach or eggplant

I believe that we crave sweets when we need vitamin C
(our ancestors didnt get much refined sweets, except for fruits)

I think most of our history we were vegetairians ,
and at times we were omnivores, but usually only if there was already
a KILL,
then we scavenged what we could.

Remember we have been walking upright for several million years
the hunting part, and rasing cows etc.. only came in recently

If you look at our intestines they are much like a chimp or other
veggie
they are LONG , where as a CAT has a very short digestive tract
because MEAT turns rancid in our bodies very quickly

i think we also have a CHOICE to eat other animals or not
and since we can get away with it without starving,
i see absolutely no reason to kill an animal

Well, if you take the natural angle even farther - we are the only
animals in the history of the earth to cook food.  Every other animal
eats a 100% raw diet.  If, as you suggest we look at the digestive
tract and the way it moves food along, then it is raw food, with its'
high fiber content that moves along efficiently and completely -
whereas cooked food has not only most of the fiber removed, but the
most of the vitamins and enzymes burned out of them as well.

Maybe it's psychosomatic, but I can eat a chunk of turkey without

As I told my physiology classes, that is a characteristic of the
switch between the fasting and the absorptive state which is indeed
the hormonal shift from epinephrine (adrenaline) and glucagon to
insulin.  However it is very genetically dependent.  While all the
guys are snoozing away on the sofas, those without a Y chromosome are
slaving away in the kitchen washing the dishes and cleaning up the
mess left by the Y chromosomal variants.

Correct. That's the problem, tho - there was nothing but fruit for

The evidence is beginning to come in that we are not just the walking

Yes. That's when we started developing bad habits. Before that we ran
down our cows, and they were all lean, because they were trying to
outrun us.

Fruits, veggies, very lean meat, and lots of very vigorous exercise.
The only way to be healthy, really.

Any physiologist will tell you that we have the digestive system (from
teeth on down) of an omnivore. Chimps will eat meat if they can catch
it. Now, you *can be perfectly healthy as a vegetarian. One of the
advantages of being omnivorous. But it isn't natural for us.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes, and the tryptophan in the turkey is going to zone me out for 3
&gt; &gt;&gt; solid days.  And I'm looking forward to it. :)

&gt; &gt;I was going to suggest smaller portions of stuffing and spuds- it's
&gt; &gt;actually the insulin response to the carbohydrate influx that makes
&gt; &gt;you sleepy.  But if you're looking forward to it, by all means...

&gt; As I told my physiology classes, that is a characteristic of the
&gt; switch between the fasting and the absorptive state which is indeed
&gt; the hormonal shift from epinephrine (adrenaline) and glucagon to
&gt; insulin.  However it is very genetically dependent.  While all the
&gt; guys are snoozing away on the sofas, those without a Y chromosome are
&gt; slaving away in the kitchen washing the dishes and cleaning up the
&gt; mess left by the Y chromosomal variants.

Yeahbut...but...but...I gave up cooking the feast for the feetsball-
watchin' Y-chromosomal varients about 15 years ago.  (And I've always
&quot;delegated&quot; the cleanup to others.  I am not on this earth to clean
things. &lt;G&gt;)   However, I frequently do the low-carb diet thing, and
even when turkey is the *only thing on my plate*, it still puts me to
sleep in under an hour.

Chimps, bonobos and gorillas will eat meat if it is available. Chimps
hunt monkeys cooperatively, and they even use the tails of their prey as
toys.

No, you need, as we all do, substantial amounts of theobromine (food of

&gt; Correct. That's the problem, tho - there was nothing but fruit for

&gt; not evolve any limits to our craving for sweets.

&gt; &gt; I think most of our history we were vegetairians ,

&gt; The evidence indicates that we are omnivores, and have been

&gt; &gt;  and at times we were omnivores, but usually only if there was already
&gt; &gt; a KILL,
&gt; &gt; then we scavenged what we could.

&gt; The evidence is beginning to come in that we are not just the walking
&gt; ape. We are the *running ape, and we run to pursue our prey. There are
&gt; very few who can outrun us or our brothers the dogs, for distance. Run
&gt; 'em down, poke 'em with a stick. Yum.

&gt; &gt; Remember we have been walking upright for several million years
&gt; &gt; the hunting part, and rasing cows etc.. only came in recently

&gt; Yes. That's when we started developing bad habits. Before that we ran
&gt; down our cows, and they were all lean, because they were trying to
&gt; outrun us.

&gt; Fruits, veggies, very lean meat, and lots of very vigorous exercise.
&gt; The only way to be healthy, really.

I can't resist a Cuban sandwich (pork overload), but have been known
to eat soyburgers and drink soymilk. Maybe it would b better if I
could stick to lentils as much as possible but carcass slicings (I
think they call them fillets) compel me especially when grilled. And
habanero sauce on fatty chicken wings dipped in ranch
dressing...mmmmm....

PETA can take the chicken wings out of my cold dead fingers...yes that
might be due to diet related coronary. The pesticides in the meal fed
to the birds do add to the spicy taste.

Hey. I can eat soyburgers. I have several boes in my freezer. BUT the
reason I like them is because...UMMMM...they taste pretty similar to
grilled ground BEEF!!!! And they do have some cheese in them too. And
I do add ranch dressing as a post microwave topping.

And I will say with a straight face that I prefer the taste of soy
milk to dairy milk.

But I won't be eating tofurkey tomorrow.

If I did go veggie it would be for health reasons not ethics of animal
product consumption. One of my favorite dishes is ham with *fresh*
pineapple. And I LOVE greens with fatback!!!

&gt; &gt; In talk.origins  I read this message from &quot;911review,org&quot;
&gt; &gt; &lt;brad.te ... @gmail.com&gt;:

&gt; &gt;&gt;i am a big believer that we crave foods for certain reasons.

&gt; &gt;&gt;When our bodies need IRON we crave spinach or eggplant

&gt; &gt;&gt;I believe that we crave sweets when we need vitamin C
&gt; &gt;&gt;(our ancestors didnt get much refined sweets, except for fruits)

&gt; &gt;&gt;I think most of our history we were vegetairians ,
&gt; &gt;&gt; and at times we were omnivores, but usually only if there was already
&gt; &gt;&gt;a KILL,
&gt; &gt;&gt;then we scavenged what we could.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Remember we have been walking upright for several million years
&gt; &gt;&gt;the hunting part, and rasing cows etc.. only came in recently

&gt; &gt;&gt;If you look at our intestines they are much like a chimp or other
&gt; &gt;&gt;veggie
&gt; &gt;&gt;they are LONG , where as a CAT has a very short digestive tract
&gt; &gt;&gt;because MEAT turns rancid in our bodies very quickly

&gt; &gt;&gt;i think we also have a CHOICE to eat other animals or not
&gt; &gt;&gt;and since we can get away with it without starving,
&gt; &gt;&gt;i see absolutely no reason to kill an animal

&gt; &gt; Perhaps you are unaware that chimps do kill and eat smaller creatures.
&gt; &gt; Yummy monkeys.

&gt; He's also apparently unaware that the original post was humor.
">

You can recognise humour without joining in with it.  Our omnivore gut
can temporarily tolerate the Atkins diet, but feeding the world in
future is going to make meat unreasonably expensive (since first of
all you have to keep the meat well-fed), plus there's biofuels.  I
expect the developed frequent-meat-eating to have no scruples worth
mentioning when it comes to snatching food out of the hands of the
disadvantaged people of the world to feed it to cattle or to
automobiles.  But I'm sure that the amount of meat that we eat is a
free personal choice, and I'm open to the view that with a carefully
chosen diet, we probably don't need meat at all.  I sometimes order
the vegetarian meal just because it's a good choice, and often also
with lower calories.

Is turkey rich in carbohydrates?
I think that the sleepiness state is due to the higher energy request
from the stomach when digesting a protein and fat rich meal. But I may
be wrong.

We are not showing that now.

Ok we got NAFTA with Mexico and flooded them with cheap corn, ruining a

I don't understand why Mexicans will eat more corn if its price goes
up.
Maybe they have less money for buying more expensive foods and thus
must resort to an almost corn-only diet?

Yes. Corm is their base food, their source of calories. Classic example

Understood.
But it's not clear to me whether Americans are guilty for this
problem.

Americans were able to sell their corn to Mexico because it was
cheaper, so they might have ruined some farmer but favoured the
general population since Mexicans could then buy a commodity for a
cheaper price.
Americans then rose the corn price, but I guess that's still cheaper
than what Mexican farmers could be able to provide, otherwise Mexicans
would had already restarted producing it themselves.

Therefore, if Americans were prevented to sell corn to Mexico,
Mexicans would be buying corn at an higher price than now.

Maybe my analysis is too simplistic, let me know if you think so.

sigh.

Unfortunately, I am a better cook than my wife. Not only that, she is
helpless with a dishwasher. Don't get me wrong, I love my wife dearly.
But a couple days ago she loaded the dishwasher and I happened to open
it before starting it, and I felt like I was staring right into DSM-
IV. So, unless I want to wash every pot or pan before I cook with it,
I make sure I load (or reload) the dishwasher.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dependent and a commodity with negative price elasticity. (When the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; price of corn goes up poor Mexicans eat more of it as it is their main
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calorie source.) Thus we have delivered a classic one two punch to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mexico, but don't worry they'll come here for jobs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't understand why Mexicans will eat more corn if its price goes
&gt; &gt; &gt; up.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe they have less money for buying more expensive foods and thus
&gt; &gt; &gt; must resort to an almost corn-only diet?

&gt; &gt; Yes. Corm is their base food, their source of calories. Classic example
&gt; &gt; of negative price elasticity.

&gt; Understood.
&gt; But it's not clear to me whether Americans are guilty for this
&gt; problem.

&gt; Americans were able to sell their corn to Mexico because it was
&gt; cheaper, so they might have ruined some farmer but favoured the
&gt; general population since Mexicans could then buy a commodity for a
&gt; cheaper price.
&gt; Americans then rose the corn price, but I guess that's still cheaper
&gt; than what Mexican farmers could be able to provide, otherwise Mexicans
&gt; would had already restarted producing it themselves.

&gt; Therefore, if Americans were prevented to sell corn to Mexico,
&gt; Mexicans would be buying corn at an higher price than now.

&gt; Maybe my analysis is too simplistic, let me know if you think so.
">

I think the price of U.S. produced corn is subsidised with, um, the
budget deficit I guess.  So trading that overseas is a kind of
modified warfare.

And of course Mexico isn't full of peasants with barnloads of corn
seed saying &quot;I hope the price of U.S. corn is raised soon so that we
can start to earn a living.  Nope, they're all dead.  The population
of Mexico is now cleaning the U.S.'s restrooms and doesn't know one
end of a piece of corn from the other.

true i didnt mean we can trust all of our cravings of course.

i think there was a study that showed if people get more vitamin C

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I believe that we crave sweets when we need vitamin C

&gt; Correct. That's the problem, tho - there was nothing but fruit for
&gt; sweets for several million years (unless you count bee honey). We did
&gt; not evolve any limits to our craving for sweets.

&gt; &gt; I think most of our history we were vegetairians ,

&gt; The evidence indicates that we are omnivores, and have been
&gt; since ...well, possibly forever. Certainly since before our ancestors
&gt; were anything remotely human.

thats debatable.
many anthropologists believe that we were vegetarians for millions of
years
though we may have taken advantage of the very  infrequent kill.
I guess if you want to call that an omnivore, then OK, but
we did not (and still dont) NEED meat as a part of our diet.

Hippo's are considered vegetarians, but will eat a zebra or whatever
on occasion
when it is available to them, but they wont kill one for food.
Its only been observed a few times,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  and at times we were omnivores, but usually only if there was already
&gt; &gt; a KILL,
&gt; &gt; then we scavenged what we could.

&gt; The evidence is beginning to come in that we are not just the walking
&gt; ape. We are the *running ape, and we run to pursue our prey. There are
&gt; very few who can outrun us or our brothers the dogs, for distance. Run
&gt; 'em down, poke 'em with a stick. Yum.

&quot;there are few that can outrun us&quot;
i doubt that.
MOST animals can outrun us
id like to see you in the wild trying to catch a chicken, a deer,
a wild boar, a buffalo, an antelope, a zebra ?

remember we didnt make spears or other tools for the
first few million years.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Remember we have been walking upright for several million years
&gt; &gt; the hunting part, and rasing cows etc.. only came in recently

&gt; Yes. That's when we started developing bad habits. Before that we ran
&gt; down our cows, and they were all lean, because they were trying to
&gt; outrun us.

&gt; Fruits, veggies, very lean meat, and lots of very vigorous exercise.
&gt; The only way to be healthy, really.
">

&quot;we ran down our cows&quot;
well, cows we see now are domestic, and bred.
millions of years ago, they were a good bit faster and meaner

Like i said we were opportunists if there was a fresh kill,
- for many million years we ate meat maybe once or twice a year
if i had to guess that the frequency of it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; If you look at our intestines they are much like a chimp or other

&gt; Any physiologist will tell you that we have the digestive system (from
&gt; teeth on down) of an omnivore. Chimps will eat meat if they can catch
&gt; it. Now, you *can be perfectly healthy as a vegetarian. One of the
&gt; advantages of being omnivorous. But it isn't natural for us.
">

I dissagree, our teeth are NOT carnivore teeth at all.
they are made for grinding food and eating apples, tubers etc...

our digestive system is much closer to a chimp than anything else,
and chimps almost never eat meat.
im not sure what you heard, but the only time they do is when they
kill another chimp
which is mainly more of a territolial thing than a MEAT thing.
They may eat ants and bugs, but thats not a huge part of their diet
overall,
not to mention i dont really call that meat, most of it is shell etc..

there are 2 types of  omnivores
&quot;By design&quot; and not by design

bears and raccoons are by design omnivores
their teeth are NOT the same as ours...

&gt; &gt; &gt; Optimal foraging theory provides a rudimentary explanatory framework for the

&gt; &gt; &gt; chemoreception may have led to emergence of harvest festivals as collective
&gt; &gt; &gt; behavior, and to the cultural relevance of certain foods.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Ethnomethodological studies show that groups over large regions of North
&gt; &gt; &gt; America show a common preference for consuming roasted Meleagris gallopavo
&gt; &gt; &gt; at their harvest festival, which falls approximately two months after the
&gt; &gt; &gt; autumnal equinox. The meal rite is usually preceded by passive observation
&gt; &gt; &gt; of inter-male aggression, broadcast over the electromagnetic spectrum and
&gt; &gt; &gt; viewed on a large display device.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Meleagris gallopavo is typically prepared with a staple food inserted into
&gt; &gt; &gt; the animal's ventral cavity, most commonly crumbs made after baking a
&gt; &gt; &gt; mixture of ground Triticum aestivum and water aerated by the carbon dioxide
&gt; &gt; &gt; output of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Additional energy optimization stems from consuming partially liquefied
&gt; &gt; &gt; Solanum tuberosum or Ipomoea batatas mixed with emulsion of butterfat
&gt; &gt; &gt; globules obtained from lactation of female Bos taurus. Both tubers may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; consumed at the same festival.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The rite usually includes consumption of Vaccinium oxycoccus boiled in water
&gt; &gt; &gt; with alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-&gt;2)-beta-D-fructofuranose, often with the
&gt; &gt; &gt; grated outer rind or pressed juice of Citrus sinensis, and concludes with
&gt; &gt; &gt; participants passing and eating a baked food consisting of liquified
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cucurbita moschata poured over a shell of ground Triticum aestivum mixed
&gt; &gt; &gt; with water and hydrogenated vegetable oil.

A better and more objective technique is to look at human anatomy and
physiology. Mammals are anatomically and physiologically adapted to
procure and consume particular kinds of diets. (It is common practice
when examining fossils of extinct mammals to examine anatomical
features to deduce the animal's probable diet.) Therefore, we can look
at mammalian carnivores, herbivores (plant-eaters) and omnivores to
see which anatomical and physiological features are associated with
each kind of diet. Then we can look at human anatomy and physiology to
see in which group we belong.

The human gastrointestinal tract features the anatomical modifications
consistent with an herbivorous diet. Humans have muscular lips and a
small opening into the oral cavity. Many of the so-called &quot;muscles of
expression&quot; are actually the muscles used in chewing. The muscular and
agile tongue essential for eating, has adapted to use in speech and
other things. The mandibular joint is flattened by a cartilaginous
plate and is located well above the plane of the teeth. The temporalis
muscle is reduced. The characteristic &quot;square jaw&quot; of adult males
reflects the expanded angular process of the mandible and the enlarged
masseter/pterygoid muscle group. The human mandible can move forward
to engage the incisors, and side-to-side to crush and grind.

Are Humans Designed to Eat Meat?
by Milton Mills, MD
http://www.all-creatures.org/mhvs/nl-2003-wi-meat.html

Why humans are primarily plant-eaters by design
http://michaelbluejay.com/veg/natural.html

Cardiologist William C. Roberts hails from the famed cattle state of
Texas, but he says this without hesitation: Humans aren't
physiologically designed to eat meat. &quot;I think the evidence is pretty
clear. If you look at various characteristics of carnivores versus
herbivores, it doesn't take a genius to see where humans line up,&quot;
says Roberts, editor in chief of The American Journal of Cardiology
and medical director of the Baylor Heart and Vascular Institute at
Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. (c) Stephen Kroninger
As further evidence, Roberts cites the carnivore's short intestinal
tract, which reaches about three times its body length. An herbivore's
intestines are 12 times its body length, and humans are closer to
herbivores, he says. Roberts rattles off other similarities between
human beings and herbivores. Both get vitamin C from their diets
(carnivores make it internally). Both sip water, not lap it up with
their tongues. Both cool their bodies by perspiring (carnivores pant).
Human beings and herbivorous animals have little mouths in relation to
their head sizes, unlike carnivores, whose big mouths are all the
better for &quot;seizing, killing and dismembering prey,&quot; argues nutrition
specialist Dr. Milton R. Mills, associate director of preventive
medicine for the Washington, D.C.-based Physicians Committee for
Responsible Medicine (PCRM). People and herbivores extensively chew
their food, he says, whereas swallowing food whole is the preferred
method of carnivores and omnivores.
http://www.rense.com/general20/meant.htm

Meat-eating has impacted the evolution of the human body, scientists
reported today at the American Association for the Advancement of
Science's annual meeting in Washington, D.C.
&quot;It's really amazing what we know now that we didn't know 15 or 20
years ago,&quot; said Mark Teaford, a professor at Baltimore's Johns
Hopkins University. Teaford helped organize a panel discussion on
human diet from a number of perspectives:
http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0218_050218_human_die...

*  We do not have a hinged jaw for ripping apart flesh but one
that is able to grind sideways.
* We have a longer digestive system so we are better able to get
the nutrients from our foods as opposed to the shorter tract that
carnivores have to enable them to pass the meat through their body
before it becomes rancid.
* It has been put forward that we have incisors for tearing flesh,
but I have always thought that these were for cropping the harder
vegetables.
* We do not have claws or talons for tearing flesh.
* The enzymes in our saliva that start breaking down the food in
our mouths and the early part of our digestive tract are of a low
acidity level and in alignment with a plant based diet.

Most people still mistakenly believe that humans are meat-eaters by
design. However, an objective comparison between the characteristics
of naturally vegetarian animals and naturally carnivorous ones, as
shown below, reveals that this belief is false:
