I like reading about weather &amp; storms; this chatty, silly article

Please attend a class at your local community college on the operation
of the on - off switch, or even the more complicated channel changer,
for your television. You will be much happier.

On one or two RARE occasions I have found decent articles on their
site. I read George Will also. I usually disagree with his focus, but
the times I agree make it worthwhile. He is a SMART conservative like
Buckley; Coulter &amp; Rush Buttpimple ain't. (cheech faints at the

You can even get the BBC news on line. Al Jazeera is more informative
than most stuff I saw on US TV.

Phree just does that mike. Phree also remembered specific posts of
mine months later, so obviously has a good memory. The article however
has no political slant or overtones. Here are some of the chatty,
silly parts:
*******************************************
Hi there FOX fans!

our very first hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season ... the
one that dreadfully has the same last name as mine!

Dean's pressure was 906 millibars (this is how we measure just how
powerful the storm is)

In other words, Dean was a wickedly mean weather machine!

so expect to see the F-storm, Felix, brewing sometime soon.
***********************************************
Childish babble. FOX reports more intelligently when they are trying
to advance a rightwing viewpoint. It the glut of celebrity 'news' &amp;
chatty, slang infested general interest content that is so annoying.
FOX sometimes has more coverage on some subjects I enjoy reading than
adult news sources. But the cute phrases, awkward verbiage*, and
excessive exclamation points render FOX 'news for dummies'.

i listen to fox everyday for a few hours in the morning . they have
about three minutes of news and the other 57 minutes are just fluff !
another thing that makes me laugh is how they rant and rave about
morality while  filling every empty chair with pretty women in short
dresses showing there legs . not that i don't like looking at pretty
women most men do which is why they are there.  it sure isn't for
their expertise in reporting !

The basic problem with Fox is that it usually attracts more viewers
than MSNBC, CNN &amp; Headline News all put together.

*********************************************
As could be noted about The National Enquirer. FOX usually has more
intelligent pieces when they are designed to slant toward rightwing
beliefs. It is with straightforward news, general interest matters &amp;
commentary the lack of erudition is most apparent.

-&gt;rick you sound like an inteligent guy . why do you resort to
baseless
insults ? i admit i am not above doing the same thing myself from
time

peach ? &lt;-mike

I am an intelligent guy, mike, and well read and with considerable
experience in counter-politics.

My insults are not baseless.  But as I told gooz, I am not a
dissembler.  I am honest and direct.  Peach is not.  Almost every one
of her posts carries a snide, oblique attack on all who disagree with
her.  Common examples are her use of &quot;CONdumbs&quot; and &quot;low I.Q.&quot;  She
also likes to intimate that those who disagree with her don't read.
People who do this think they are being clever and can pretend to take
the high road.  They aren't clever -- just gutless.

This whole lib vs con, dem vs rep, and left vs right is a charade to
keep us fighting among ourselves.  While we're doing this and putting
the blame for problems on petty henchmen like Bush and Clinton, the
real gangsters that are running the show are robbing us blind and
killing our kids. I only bother to hang around in the hope I might
help some to open both eyes.  This won't happen with Peach.  She's had
too much formal indoctrination.  Her eyes are permanently sealed.

Another problem with Fox is that they will never be able to match CBS
in the production of Crockumentaries.  These are the totally staged
programs that have certain people shaking their heads and saying,
&quot;Duh.  Yeah.  That's intelijint!
