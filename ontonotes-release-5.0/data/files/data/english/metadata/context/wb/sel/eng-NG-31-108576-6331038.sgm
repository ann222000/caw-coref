I'm a 45 yo male. Normally I do a lot of walking. But due to my
schedule, haven't been doing as much in the past few weeks.
Yesterday I go for an extra long walk. Into about 3 miles, feeling so
good I figure I'm good for at least 5 more, I sprint across an
intersection. No traffic, but I felt like sprinting anyways. Almost
all the way across, suddenly it feels like I've been shot or stabbed
in the leg, and have the mother of all charley horses. So far, from
what I've read, I have all the correct symptoms of "Tennis Leg". A
pull or tear in the calf muscle (gastrocnemius)

http://www.sportsmedicineofatlanta.com/reference/tennis_leg_common_sp...

My calf is pretty sore, but I can still walk okay with a limp, once
I've warmed up. I'm doing the R.I.C.E. thing; Rest, Ice, Compression,
Elevation.

The one thing I have that I'm not reading anywhere in the symptomology
is slight tingling/pricking ( paresthesia) in my foot, especially at
the toes.

That indicates possible nerve damage. Did you call your doctor?

I never heard of "tennis leg" and I was a semi-pro player before
running.
You over exerted yourself while extra tired from walking. No big deal.
It will go away on its own and you will be fine.  Once it goes away
and you can exercise again, try to be more regular in exercising so
you can catch a bus or defend yourself if necessary without crashing.

Well, if you'd bothered to notice, he also cross-posted to other newsgroups,
so why not take the chance that someone here knows something?

For the record, I rather doubt it's an achilles problem - he wouldn't have
been able to get home, and achilles tears rarely result from uni-directional
sprinting, but rather from sudden stops/bursts and changes of direction. On
the face, given the evidence, I'd agree with the torn muscle theory.

Some years ago I tore a quad muscle in my left leg by sprinting up a steep
dirt stairway chiselled into the side of a quarry (the university I attended
has an interesting history) at 7am in the morning on my way to the gym with
no warmup (stupid, yes). The pain described and effect of the injury was
nearly-identical. When it happened, it felt like someone punched me in the
thigh, and the resulting pain was extremely reminiscent of a charlie
horse/cramp.

Zed: Take a few weeks off to heal (though I don't know how calf muscles heal
as compared to quad muscles), and then slowly begin rehabbing it with light
gym work and walking/*slow* jogging around. Actually, a longer period of
rest may be necessary. I was 22 when I injured my thigh, and there's quite a
difference in regenerative capability between a 22 and 45 year old.

Also: See a doctor just in case. That shouldn't even need to be said,
really.

I have never heard of it referred to as "tennis leg", but I know what
he means.  In this case, he has obviously done beyond mere fatigue and
torn something.  In my long tennis experience I have had the pleasure
of seeing a few opponents go down with spasms in the gastrocnemius
(calf)--one of whom loudly yelled "gastrocnemius, don't fail me now!"
as he writhed in agony about the court during a must win team match
following a long rally deep in the 3rd. Eveyone includng myself busted
out laughing and I went on to win after he recovered.  Another guy
beat me after I was foolish enough to assist him after he went down.
It is a small victory in itself to see an opponent break down
physically like this--unless you are Lendl of course.  I myself have
never gone down on the court with this condition, but have suffered
this type of lock-up a handfull of times during cool-down after some
grueling matches.  It will get your attention in a hurry.  The only
good thing about getting older is that these episodes become more rare
because you are not as likely to push yourself as hard as you did when
you were younger.  Same with rolling over the ankle. I used to be good
for at least 1 bad ankle turn per year, but not nearly so much anymore
that I don't move as explosively as I once did.  Now watch me do 'er
good this weekend...

I did see the Doc. There wasn't much he could do of course, but he did
give me the helpful advice of not babying it. His concern was the
possibility of a blood clot forming, so I worked it good to keep the
circulation going. The tingling in my toes had gone away the day after
my original post. It was due to inflammation temporarily putting
pressure on a nerve. A great deal of bleeding took place, turning my
ankle area very purple with a certain amount of edema. The initial
recovery was only two weeks, as the article I posted a link to
indicated it would be. At three weeks, I'm about 90%. It will be at
least 5 weeks before I try any light jogging, just to make sure it's
fully healed and I don't relapse. I'm mainly writing this as an
archive for someone else to reference in the future. I've come across
posts like these searching for what someone had to say about a certain
situation.

Thanks for the input everybody.

Just remember... Don't jay-run across the street. You never know when
the unexpected might put you down in the center lane. I was lucky in
that I managed to remain vertical and was able to hobble the rest of
the way to the curb quickly enough.
