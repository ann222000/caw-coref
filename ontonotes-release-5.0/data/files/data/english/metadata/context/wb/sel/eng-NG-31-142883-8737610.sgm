&quot;...He then develops a dynamic model of the collapse sequence, which
simulates the successive squashing, or &quot;pan-caking&quot; of individual
storeys based on the residual capacity already identified. The process
is already well known from other studies of progressive collapse, but
usually applies to other structures such as undersea pipelines, rather
than buildings.

This allowed Dr Seffen to predict that the residual capacity of both
buildings was limited, and once collapse had started, it would take only
10 seconds for the building to go down - just a little longer than the
free-falling of a coin dropped from the top of either tower. &quot;

Illuminati - possibly allied with the reptilians of the New World Order.
Either that or Bin Laden did it.

The north tower took a chunk out of the &quot;other&quot; side of building 7.  The
building was structurally damaged.  Add to that the fact that it burned for
8 hours before it collapsed and the idea that it was a controlled demolition
sounds pretty stupid.  Not to mention, the fire department abandoned
attempts to put out the fires in building 7 a couple hours before it fell.

Part of the fires in building 7 may also have been from a pressurized oil
line that was there to feed backup generators.  (Building 7 was supposed to
be self sufficient in the event of a power outage.)  Thousands of gallons of
fuel oil may have been pumped into the fire zone.

you're making there.

Frankly, the notion that 9/11 was completely the fault of Bin Laden
jnr and associates is actually a great deal more comforting, if you
can call it that, than Bush jnr and associates did it. As much as I
may disagree with Bush's politics...the notion that him and his
friends could be so traitorous to their own is far more disturbing
than a group that is an avowed enemy of America and the rest of the
western world.

That you suggest that a bushite conspiracy might be &quot;more comforting&quot;
than the notion than &quot;Al Qaeda did it&quot; actually displays your own
prejudice...

Not as stupid as someone who believes it was anything but a controlled
demolition. Fires blaze in a building. They don't suddenly collapse
into a heap leaving absolutely nothing standing.

Is it a public domain model?  With the full dataset used in calculations
available and annotated?  Sounds like he is just saying he has done it...
and as a university professor quite possibly working for several
corporations and other interests we should just take his word for it....

plus, isn't an undersea pipeline collapse significantly different due to
several atmospheres of pressure pushing down on the structure and the more
powerful flows associated with water (and, if its a subsea pipeline its
also not using steel at its strongest angle i.e. vertical beams... as well
as having the flow inside the pipeline affecting the structure during its
life before collapse.)

A major question is what state of parameters/data did he model the WTC
collapse starting from? (i.e. how damaged did he assume the building to be
at the start of his calculations...?)

&gt; corporations and other interests we should just take his word for it....

&gt; plus, isn't an undersea pipeline collapse significantly different due to
&gt; several atmospheres of pressure pushing down on the structure and the more
&gt; powerful flows associated with water (and, if its a subsea pipeline its
&gt; also not using steel at its strongest angle i.e. vertical beams... as well
&gt; as having the flow inside the pipeline affecting the structure during its
&gt; life before collapse.)

&gt; A major question is what state of parameters/data did he model the WTC
&gt; collapse starting from? (i.e. how damaged did he assume the building to be
&gt; at the start of his calculations...?)
">

or even what materials did he assume the building was built of... I heard
rod sharp on R5 live last night saying they were aluminium girders in the
WTC... ???

The conspiracy is more comforting.

Putting my armchair psychologist's hat on, a vastly secretive and
powerful cabal that controls much of the World removes the randomness
of life to a degree.

It is a quasi God-like entity.

Also, it gives the conspiracy theorist a sense of inside knowledge: he
isn't one of the sheep, he is special.

Also, it removes the possibility of a disconcerting &quot;clash of
civilizations&quot;: everything would be OK if not for this clandestine
cabal.

Perhaps it's also comforting for Americans to think that their
government actually has the competency to carry out such a secretive
and vast operation, when in reality its hard for the president to get
sucked off without the whole world knowing.

No, structural damage caused by the building that collapsed a block from it
plus a fire burning uncontrolled for a time well beyond the fire rating of
of the structural members caused the failure.  Once the failure began,
gravity took over and a total collapse was inevitable.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;simulates the successive squashing, or &quot;pan-caking&quot; of individual
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;storeys based on the residual capacity already identified. The process
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;is already well known from other studies of progressive collapse, but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;usually applies to other structures such as undersea pipelines, rather
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;than buildings.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;This allowed Dr Seffen to predict that the residual capacity of both
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;buildings was limited, and once collapse had started, it would take
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;only
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;10 seconds for the building to go down - just a little longer than the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;free-falling of a coin dropped from the top of either tower. &quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Obviously a dupe of The Illuminati. Or the Jews. Or the Jewish
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Illuminati - possibly allied with the reptilians of the New World
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Order.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Either that or Bin Laden did it.

&gt; &gt;&gt; attempts to put out the fires in building 7 a couple hours before it
&gt; &gt;&gt; fell.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Part of the fires in building 7 may also have been from a pressurized oil
&gt; &gt;&gt; line that was there to feed backup generators.  (Building 7 was supposed
&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; be self sufficient in the event of a power outage.)  Thousands of gallons
&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; fuel oil may have been pumped into the fire zone.

&gt; &gt; Not as stupid as someone who believes it was anything but a controlled
&gt; &gt; demolition.

&gt; Well, it doesn't look like a controlled demolition, and wiring up an office
&gt; block for a controlled demolition is a bit tricky to hide from the thousands
&gt; of people working in said building.

&gt; &gt; Fires blaze in a building. They don't suddenly collapse into a heap
&gt; &gt; leaving absolutely nothing standing.

&gt; Buildings which have been severaly damaged beforehand?

Not substantially damaged at all . There is no evidence of anything

From the earlier reference Popular Mechanics article:

&quot;With the benefit of more time and resources, NIST researchers now support
the working hypothesis that WTC 7 was far more compromised by falling debris
than the FEMA report indicated. &quot;The most important thing we found was that
there was, in fact, physical damage to the south face of building 7,&quot; NIST's
Sunder tells PM. &quot;On about a third of the face to the center and to the
bottom - approximately 10 stories - about 25 percent of the depth of the
building was scooped out.&quot; NIST also discovered previously undocumented
damage to WTC 7's upper stories and its southwest corner. &quot;

We may be at crossed-porpoises here. To clarify, I have no doubt the various

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;This allowed Dr Seffen to predict that the residual capacity of both

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;only
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;10 seconds for the building to go down - just a little longer than
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;free-falling of a coin dropped from the top of either tower. &quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Obviously a dupe of The Illuminati. Or the Jews. Or the Jewish
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Illuminati - possibly allied with the reptilians of the New World
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Order.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Either that or Bin Laden did it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does he explain Building 7 then?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The north tower took a chunk out of the &quot;other&quot; side of building 7.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; building was structurally damaged.  Add to that the fact that it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; burned
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 8 hours before it collapsed and the idea that it was a controlled
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; demolition
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sounds pretty stupid.  Not to mention, the fire department abandoned
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attempts to put out the fires in building 7 a couple hours before it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fell.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Part of the fires in building 7 may also have been from a pressurized
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; oil
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; line that was there to feed backup generators.  (Building 7 was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; supposed
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be self sufficient in the event of a power outage.)  Thousands of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gallons
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fuel oil may have been pumped into the fire zone.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Not as stupid as someone who believes it was anything but a controlled
&gt;&gt; &gt; demolition.

&gt;&gt; Well, it doesn't look like a controlled demolition, and wiring up an
&gt;&gt; office
&gt;&gt; block for a controlled demolition is a bit tricky to hide from the

Given that the issue I was raising is that you are making false analogies by
comparing burned out 3 to 5 story stone buildings to WTC-7, I think it is
quite related to the issue.

Please explain to me how the structural physics of a 5 story masonry
building are at all similar to a 47 story steel building.  Give particular
emphasis as to how the load is transmitted to and distributed among the load
bearing members and how a cantilevered steel central core has the same
physics and load distribution as an encircling masonry wall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;...He then develops a dynamic model of the collapse sequence, which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; simulates the successive squashing, or &quot;pan-caking&quot; of individual
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; storeys based on the residual capacity already identified. The process
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is already well known from other studies of progressive collapse, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; usually applies to other structures such as undersea pipelines, rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than buildings.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This allowed Dr Seffen to predict that the residual capacity of both
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; buildings was limited, and once collapse had started, it would take
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 10 seconds for the building to go down - just a little longer than the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; free-falling of a coin dropped from the top of either tower. &quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Obviously a dupe of The Illuminati. Or the Jews. Or the Jewish
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Illuminati - possibly allied with the reptilians of the New World
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Order.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Either that or Bin Laden did it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How does he explain Building 7 then?
&gt;&gt;&gt; The north tower took a chunk out of the &quot;other&quot; side of building 7.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt; building was structurally damaged.  Add to that the fact that it burned
&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; 8 hours before it collapsed and the idea that it was a controlled
&gt;&gt;&gt; demolition
&gt;&gt;&gt; sounds pretty stupid.  Not to mention, the fire department abandoned
&gt;&gt;&gt; attempts to put out the fires in building 7 a couple hours before it
&gt;&gt;&gt; fell.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Part of the fires in building 7 may also have been from a pressurized oil
&gt;&gt;&gt; line that was there to feed backup generators.  (Building 7 was supposed
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be self sufficient in the event of a power outage.)  Thousands of gallons
&gt;&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; fuel oil may have been pumped into the fire zone.

&gt;&gt; Not as stupid as someone who believes it was anything but a controlled
&gt;&gt; demolition.

&gt; Well, it doesn't look like a controlled demolition, and wiring up an office
&gt; block for a controlled demolition is a bit tricky to hide from the thousands
&gt; of people working in said building.

&gt;&gt; Fires blaze in a building. They don't suddenly collapse into a heap
&gt;&gt; leaving absolutely nothing standing.

As somebody else put it:

&quot;The fact that this man is alive...

...is proof that &quot;Loose Change&quot; is bullshit.

Here's why:

1. The man in the picture above is Dylan Avery. To be more precise, the fact that
Dylan, his friends, and family are alive, is proof that &quot;Loose Change&quot; is bullshit.
He, along with a couple of his friends, created a 9/11 conspiracy video claiming
that the US government and the military caused 9/11. Take a closer look at the last
part of that last sentence: he's claiming that the US government, for whatever ends,
killed nearly 3,000 innocent Americans, and tens if not hundreds of thousands of
more lives in the conflicts that ensued because of it.

2. Since Dylan's arguing that the government has no problem killing 3,000 innocent
people, this raises the question: if his documentary is true, and we've established
that the government has no ethical qualms about killing thousands of its own people,
then why wouldn't the government kill Avery and his friends as well? What's a few
more lives to them to ensure the success of this conspiracy?

Whatever reason it may be that the government supposedly orchestrated this
conspiracy, it must have been worth it to them to cause so much suffering and loss
of life. So if there's any truth to this, then you can bet your ass that the
government wouldn't let a couple of pecker-neck chumps with a couple of Macs and too
much time on their hands jeopardise their entire operation by letting this stupid
video float around on the Internet. I can picture you morons emailing me now: &quot;BUT
MADOX, MAYBE DYLAN POSTED IT ON THE INTERNET BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT HAD A CHANCE TO
REMOVE IT LOL.&quot; Yeah, too bad this rebuttal is inconsistent with the premise of
Dylan's shit-festival of a movie: that the WTC was brought down &quot;in a carefully
planned and controlled demolition ... and it was pulled off with military
precision.&quot; Now we're expected to believe that the same government that was able to
commit the largest terrorist operation in history--with military precision no
less--is suddenly too incompetent to sniff out and shut down a little website set up
by some college losers within days, if not minutes of its creation? The US
government has the capability to monitor every electronic communication made
anywhere in the world, yet we're expected to believe that they wouldn't be able to
nix this kid long before his video ever became popular?

Ahh, i get it , i can only compare with something that suits your
agenda, right? Slight problem there. It's never happened before.
Skyscrapers have been infernos, but never collapsed in such and
orderly manner. The shell remains intact for building fires that have
raged for much longer than any of the WTC fires. Like i said, there
must be something wrong with your building supplies or workmanship.
