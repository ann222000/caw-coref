6 Rivers Paddling Club was back this year.  This is our story:

6RPC, defending champions of the Kardboard Kayak Cup, put together a great
team this year.  Along with our cardboard design engineers, we also
developed a great theme, "Nelson's Revenge" and the appropriate decorations
it required.  We worked smoothly together despite the sometimes very funny
running commentary from the MC.  Shannon was our kraft paddler this year.
After learning from last years booboo's, i:e: tides, we had a great
launching point on the dock. But then we found out that the race was
scheduled for slack water this year . . .  Shannon was properly attired in
flotation and cold water protective gear, which was academic as she was our
Admirable Admiral, and Admiral's don't get wet!  We had a great launch this
year, a direct line to the buoy.  She paddled hard and furiously, but the
Humboldt Honey Do's Bruce Hales had a little more in the male muscle
department and won by a boat length or two.  Our club retains the best
record in this event.  Next year, we'll be back to reclaim the glory again!

So what we learned this year was:

a) Don't have an 8 x 10 picture of last year's winning Kardboard Kayak for
all to study for design ideas for this year's race.  (The number of people
at the 6RPC booth an hour before construction was suspiciously high, and a
number of this years entrants look real similar.)
b)  Cannon design needs to be much larger and much more sinister.
c)  Whitewater canoeists need a lot of help in figuring out the required
rigging needed for a square sail set up.  You can't just push the mast
through a hole in the deck and expect it to work!  So unfortunately,
Nelson's Revenge, had to be de-masted and rely exclusively on paddle power
for propulsion.

It was a great race.
