Dear Second-opinion friends,

Here is a short quiz developed by Dr. Julie Ralls, MD.

There is a CONSISTENT under-current in medicine and
optometry -- to the effect that a negative refractive STATE for
the eye can be at least PREVENTED. (Versus
the POOR WORD &quot;cured&quot;.)

This was the thesis of Dr. Bates, Dr. Prentice, and
Dr. Raphaeslon, and others.

Perhaps to clear your own mind on this subject you might enjoy
answering these basic questions about the natural eye' behavior.

This is for BOTH layman &quot;Absolutley Right&quot;,
and Andrew, and the majority-opinion optometrists.

Otis

(And thanks to Julie Ralls for developing this test.)

By the way (, you fucking idiot), Julie Ralls, MD has accommodative
spasm.

I know that YOU have a really, really, really hard time understanding
the difference between &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;structural&quot; myopia, but ...
then again ... that's largely because you're ... well ... a fucking
idiot.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  And for interest's sake I would like to share with you some further little
&gt; things I have done with these clear flashes.  An optometrist around the corner
&gt; has a biofeedback instrument that measures accommodation, the Accomotrac.  The
&gt; devise emits a tone that gets higher as accommodation relaxes.  I have had
&gt; several &quot;treatments&quot; with biofeedback in an effort to cut down on some of my
&gt; ciliary spasm.  With these clear flashes (which may be better understood
&gt; someday if the innervation to the ciliary muscle is researched more) at times I
&gt; get searing pain.  So I used some alcaine drops prior to a treatment to see if
&gt; I could block the pain and get more negative accommodation.  Interestingly
&gt; enough, the alcaine drops blocked my ability to decrease my accommodation
&gt; through biofeedback.
&gt;  I have been cyclopleged and told I am about -3.  I have been told that there
&gt; is no known explanation for these clear flashes, that the cyclopleging should
&gt; have taken me to my endpoint.  But I know for a fact is does not, because at
&gt; times I see much more clearly that what my doctors have been able to
&gt; objectively measure.
&gt;  So I worked with my OD on another little experiment.  She gave me 1% cyclogel
&gt; and waited about 40 minutes.  My pupils were completely blown and then we check
&gt; to see if I still had any ability to change accommodation.  Sure enough, I did
&gt; and was able to increase the tone on the Accomotrac.  I think this warrants
&gt; further investigation.

Dear Absolutly Honest,

Subject: Answer the questions.

You are the only one who actually attempted
to answer these questions.

That is how you start solving problems,
and resolving issues.

The others posting here sit on their
ass -- and do nothing but shoot off
their four mouth, and complain about
you.

They are pathetic.

Further, they have not yet addressed
fundamental scientific issues yet,
although &quot;L&quot; seems to be lurching
in that direction (while codemming
Bates as being &quot;not-scientific&quot;.

Best,

Otis

I took some time to go back and try to figure out how and where this
discussion started.  It seems to stem from a disagreement over what
the meaning of &quot;science&quot; and &quot;vision&quot; are, and what constitutes
ligitimate scientific discussion.  Surely, this leaves out the Bates
people.

Dear Absolutely Wise,

Here are the medically correct answers by J. Ralls MD.

Otis

==========

Answers to:

A QUIZ

by

Julie Ralls, M.D.

1.  Though inconvenient, myopia is not a disease.  T F

(True per Sher, Trobe and Weingeist, &quot;New Options For Vision
Loss&quot;, Patient Care, Sept.  1995, p.56.  but False per Sherman,
Beresford, Mutti and Zadnik as referenced below)

2.  Myopia is caused by long eyes.  T F

(C'est vrai, c'est marque dans mon livre d'anatomie, which is
French for &quot;That's true, it says so in my anatomy book.&quot;)

3.  There are no know treatments for nearsightedness besides
corrective lenses or surgery.  T F

(True per many members of the American Academy of
Ophthalmology , not true if they know &quot;their&quot; stuff, false per
many members of the College of Optometrists in Vision
Development.)

4.  If we had put the money invested into corneal surgery into
investigating the pathophysiology of this condition,
somebody might have won a Nobel prize by now.  T F

(False per Dr.  Kawesch.  Per him we will not see a cure for
myopia in our lifetimes.  But I have this friend who became myopic
in her twenties.  This happened after she got a job working in
front of a computer all day long.  She saw an optometrist who gave
her reading glasses to use with the computer and this string with
beads on it to use for focusing exercises.  The string with the
beads ended up in a shoe box in her closet, but she did wear the
reading glasses.  Her vision normalized within one year.  And my
oldest brother, he became myopic in his teens.  Hated the glasses
and wouldn't wear them.

Now he says he was just stressed out and mom was
over-reacting by taking him to the doctor.  His subsequent eye
exams were normal.  And my former roommate Lorraine was also
diagnosed as nearsighted.  She fought with her mother for a year
saying she didn't need the glasses.  On her follow-up exam, her
vision was better than 20/20 and has been great ever since.  These
sound like cures to me.  Does this sound familiar to you or to a
friend?  See an ophthalmology text under pseudomyopia, adult onset
myopia or ciliary muscle spasm.)

5.  True/false and multiple choice quizzes can be a form of
brainwashing.  T F

(True for Westerners.  Add sleep deprivation and it works
even better.  But you can beat, starve, imprison, rape, shock and
otherwise torture a Tibetan and they won't budge an inch.  The
most hard-headed, stubborn, backward people on the planet!  If you
don't believe me, just ask the Chinese government!)

6.  Patients do not know and cannot understand anything about
their own health problems.  They need to keep quiet and do
as their doctor tells them.  This is in their own best
interest.  T F

(False.  But this was actually considered to be true until
1964 when the Beatles toured the United States and changed
everything.)

7.  You shouldn't sit too close to the TV or you'll ruin your
eyes.  T F

(True, and you'll ruin your other muscles, including your
heart, plus your back and your brain.  So turn that thing off, go
outside and ride your bike or something!)

8.  Sometimes you can't see the forest for the trees.  T F

(True.  Sometimes when I look at a tree, it comes briefly
into focus, all the leaves, the details on the bark, everything.
To get your own clear flash, pick up a book on vision therapy.

Not everyone gets these, but if you do, you will realize that
nature gave you everything you need to see, and that you still
have it all, it's just not working right.  Like a flashlight with
a loose connection.  Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera.)

9.  Myopia is caused by your cornea being too steep.  T F

(True per Los Angeles Times article &quot;Seeing The Light&quot;,
business section &quot;D&quot;, 1-13-97.  This is simplistic to the point of
being misleading.  Yet the L.A.  Times did not publish my letter
regarding this, nor anything about an alternate viewpoint.  I do
think there is validity to BR2026's assertion that the media
accepts information from refractive surgeons without question.
Hardly cutting edge journalism.)

10.  Myopia is a pathological condition with strong environmental
influences.  T F

(True, see references below.)

11.  Adults can grow long eyes.  T F

(True.  This actually happened to a friend of mine in her
early 40's!)

P.S.  And I am sorry for offending Dr.  Kawesch and any other
ophthalmologists out there.  I exaggerated my position to
make a point.

My colleagues should be like my siblings.

My first ophthalmologist was like my uncle.  I still can
barely believe there's been a goof-up, but I can see with my own
eyes that it is so.

Plus I think there is a lot of truth to the comments about
the inadequacies of family physicians.  Specialists should be able
to run circles around me in regards to their own field.

I wouldn't feel comfortable referring my patients to one who
couldn't.  In general, they will always know more about the fine
details, but I will have a better view of the forest.

But in regards to myopia the medical profession has not done
it's homework or has ignored what homework has been done.

It amazes me how many of my patients and friends have become
myopic as adults and been treated with negative diopter lenses.

They are not told about etiology, co-morbid conditions or
treatment options.  But what is even more amazing, they don't even
ask!  They wear the lenses and their vision gets worse.  I even
know a few doctors who did this.  I thought we were smart.

Dr.  Ralls

Hi Neil

I think congratulations are in order for you.

You have given up most of the pretence and are now beginning to
express your anger frustration and rage towards a person somehow
involved in the eye care field who you feel is harmful and

I am hoping that in a few years you will be able to see that when you

So keep up the good work!   I think you are making some good progress

Indeed.  I went looking just now for the legal case against Otis in
the hope it would actually specify treating patients without an
optometry licence - but it did not.

In one way or another otis is not so different to those LASIK  jokers
who inflict a life time of misery on some poor vain myope.

Then there are those poor vain strabismic folk who find that their
eyes are never the same since the &quot;cosmetic&quot; surgery to correct their
&quot;hopeless&quot; eye conditions.

I wonder who goes chasing those people down to ensure they never
endingly regret offering some service to people without properly
working thru the consequences?

I suppose by now there must be a few lawyers on the case with dollars
to guide their path?

Meanwhile only the white night of Neil shines some dim light on the
terrible injustice that Otis must surely inflict upon the hapless
populace?  And surely it is Otis who is most guilty?    And surely it
is Neil who is most saintly?

Who knows?

I am just a simple person who struggles to make sense of the
conclusions and arrrive at the appropriate data.

I happened by this group and couldn't help but notice the subject line.
This would be the same Dr. Ralls who took my bet about 12 years ago
right here on s.m.v. that nobody could reduce their myopia by more than
a half diopter or so in the course of a year of intensive preventive
work ala bates or whatever &quot;preventive&quot; technique(s) they might want to
utilize.

She took the $1K bet.

And lost.

She might still believe it was her own fault that she failed for not
trying hard enough, but fail she did, as proven in my office by two
cycloplegic refractions done a year apart showing no change at all.  A
common thread of excuses for failed homeopathic remedies is to blame the
patient. It's sad that even the failed patients themselves often end up
believing just that sort of thing, which is probably the very thing that
keeps the myths alive in spite constant and consistent failures.

I trust the &quot;quiz&quot; you attribute to her is another of your fabrications,
or is some gross distortion of something she might have written,
because the Julie Ralls I know, in spite of her erroneous belief in your
method, is quite articulate and would not have created such a
nonsensical piece of work.  I mean, really, &quot;no know treatments&quot;?????

w.stacy, o.d.

oh, and sorry to see that s.m.v. has fully decomposed.

sometimes the bad guys win through attrition.

Bill

Can you confirm that she lost?

Because if you go back thru scimedvision posts the impression you get
is that you claimed that she visited twice to your office but then
agreed that you were likely wrong about that.   And as you say Dr
Ralls was quite articulate.

Are you now saying that there is new information about new visits and
that Dr Ralls is now agreeing with you?

Thanks

Otis&gt; No, you are making this up.  I simply did not post her

Otis&gt; No, it is an exact copy -- as I stated.

If to be precise
Is it means that it is possible to reduce myopia for less then a half
diopter in the year in some cases?

Considering that progression rate in average around -0.5
Less then -0.5 Improvement per year in
refractive error it is just expected rate. It means that it is
possible

Lena, he specifically said that he bet Dr. Ralls that she could not
improve her myopia by more than one diopter in one year.  The
corollary to that is if she couldn't make it happen in that amount of
time, it probably was not going to happen.  I don't see any other
implications.  As an optometrist participating in some of these
discussions, it would be my guess that Dr. Stacy believes that up to
0.50 diopters of tonic accommodation (pseudo-myopia) is the norm, and
that it would only be this accommodative component that would be
subject to elimination via relaxation/biofeedback techniques -- at
least temporarily.  This is confirmed everyday in our practices when
we perform cycloplegic refractions.

How much can pseudomyopia account for, please?

0.5 diopters?

Or is it 20 diopters?

Or sometimes 3?

Not allowed to go to the optician shop!

But do you think if I went there, would they let me borrow some
atropine or something? I mean, for free? Just for a few tests and

But I know that you are may be practicing in US and the laws of
provision are different. But may be not.

Also, does getting a cycloplegic refraction hurt?

Well, it does sting like hell.  But, more importantly, is that there

Really ? Reveal measure results ?

my experience: I read refractometers reading  from the my friend's
file,
almost  upsidedown when receptionist opened the file.
She-OD does not wanted to answer
I asked like 5 times, very politely
I know , that by low .....
I was not going to explain that she-OD
anything
The cure-just say thank you with a smile
and leave.

Well

DrG,
I know.
He was with me when i  asked.
In the beginning he told her to answer my questions.
Even in hospitals, when relatives ask
questions  they look at records and
answer or give to look at records . (under permission of patient)
He (not me) called to another  OD's  office  hi to fax his old
records.
(He was regular customer over there.)
They never did.
I called to remind them to send fax
at the number that HE gave
Receptionist asked Why he needs it. they never did again.
And to be consistent with the same low
that I have no right for somebody else medical info
Receptionist has no right to know
Why he needs records.
