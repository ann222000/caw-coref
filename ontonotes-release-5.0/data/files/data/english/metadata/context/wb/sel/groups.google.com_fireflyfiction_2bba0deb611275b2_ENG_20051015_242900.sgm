1. SIMON.

He stared at the white, clinical walls with a mixture of longing, regret and
something he could only define as overwhelming relief. With the situation as it
stood now, Mal had made a decision that had surprised everyone. Everyone,
perhaps, except Simon. If Mal hadn't come to the decision himself, Simon most
likely would have insisted on it.

So Simon sat on the medical gurney and let the doctor prod and poke his healing
abdomen, his long healed thigh wound, attach the necessary machines and listen
to his heart and blood pressure, let her take blood from his arm.

They'd headed straight for Kerry, a little orange planet far away from anything
resembling a core world or Alliance territory. Rumor had it they were running a
med clinic. All of them could get checked out and properly screened for free
and without any identification or paperwork changing hands. Mal had sneeringly
called it charity work, in a tone that suggested what the rich, core doctors
could do with their charity, but hadn't actually said anything, because they
really did serve a purpose.

He'd been wrong, the doctors didn't think of it as charity work at all, but
Simon hadn't seen any reason to tell Mal, or the others, that the border planet
runs that were mandatory for all new interns were known as FWOT runs. Fucking
Waste Of Time. It was a joke among them all. Riding in brand new, Alliance
grade space ships out to some godforsaken planet where the locals didn't have
the rudimentary knowledge on how to make a bar of soap, let alone use it.

Nobody had been under any false beliefs about leaving their little stopover
planet, having given strict orders for the people to keep their wounds clean,
or get medicine for the two year old who could barely breathe, or even, god
forbid, wash their hands a little more. Nobody was under any pretense that
their completely obvious orders would be followed. Before they'd even break
atmo, they knew they'd been forgotten and dismissed.

The doctor poked the red, inflamed area of his wound again and sucked air
through her teeth in disapproval.

&quot;This is what you get all the way out here.&quot; She turned to another, younger
doctor behind her. Simon guessed he was very brand new in the medical field. He
looked nervous. &quot;The weaving is barely adequate, this is going to leave
horrific scarring.&quot;

Simon didn't say anything. He knew Zoe wasn't a trained doctor, but she was
more than capable of removing bullets and stitching up holes in him that had a
tendency to make him pass out. He knew this doctor was thinking about fine,
delicate pull throughs of fine, delicate weaves, done in a practiced manner.
With shining, hygienic tools, handed to her by someone with shining, hygienic
hands.

The doctor sighed.

&quot;Did this hack of a doctor even give you some form of anti inflammatory or
antibiotic for this?&quot; She paused and dumbed it down for him. &quot;Any tablets of
any kind?&quot;

Simon just shook his head helplessly. He knew it wouldn't matter, wouldn't
matter because this woman had no idea what it was like, nor would she care. It
didn't matter to her that, out here, sometimes the only money these people had
was swallowed up by a desperate need to eat, not put aside for medicines that
were only a 'precaution'. It didn't matter to her that these people thought
more in terms of what would keep them alive than what would keep them pretty.
It didn't matter to her that there was a desperateness out here that she would
likely never know.

Simon knew it didn't matter to her, because it hadn't mattered to him, either.
He'd been there, he'd curled his lip in distaste at the dirty, unwashed bodies
that had come through the clinic, had groaned in frustration at the repeated
sight of wounds improperly healed, at the constant reminder that things would
be so much easier if these people just read a book once in their lives and
learned proper hygiene procedures and took the right medication and followed
the right treatment schedules.

That was, of course, before he'd become one of the great unlearned, before he'd
ridden on a space ship that was now more home to him than anywhere he'd ever
really known. Before the sight of fresh produce was enough to make his salivary
glands go into overdrive, before the thought of staying and keeping alive had
become more important than what clothes to wear to the Stinton party on a
Saturday night.

Before he'd learned to value the ability to make a person smile when they most
needed it just as highly as years in tertiary education, to value speed and
accuracy as much as technical knowledge, loyalty as much as breeding, the
choice of creating a family over those that were thrown together.

Simon stared at the white, clinical walls with a mixture of longing, regret and
something he could only define as overwhelming relief.

2. INARA.

She pressed the softness of it into the worn and weathered grooves of solidity
and was surprised by the complete lack of contrast, it was almost like they
were made for each other. Inara knew different, however, she could remember the
last time, officially the first time, she'd hung the drapes and wall hangings
and sheets over the crude metal walls of the shuttle.

It had taken her so much longer back then, but now she kenw where everything
was supposed to go. There were five whole trunks full of nothing but silk and
satin, screens of utmost delicacy and beauty. Each of them had a designated
place, she hadn't been off Serenity long enough to forget where they all go.

&quot;I know I've seen 'em all before, Inara, but wow, look at all the pretties!&quot;

Inara smiled as Kaylee gushed over the materials. She thought back to the
Companion House and how five trunks of cloth were nothing to blink at, except
to wonder why there wasn't more. How Sheydra had lifted her brow, but covered
the surprise the very instant later, when she hadn't brought more things
aboard.

Fine cloth that, in the Training House, would have been hung decoratively over
already plush, lined walls that were so dense with luxury it was almost too
hard to breath. Here, it was laid over stark metal walls, providing a very thin
veneer.

&quot;Speaking of pretty,&quot; Inara unfolded a piece of cloth that she'd been keeping
aside. &quot;I did bring you back a present, mei mei.&quot;

She watched eagerly as Kaylee's eyes widened when she saw the dress, watched as
Kaylee reached out hesitantly, touching the material with a reverence that
seemed almost obscene for nothing more than a piece of clothing. Inara did not
tell her that it had been cast off, once belonging to a girl who had
disregarded it as easily as the peelings of an apple. Something she knew, also,
that Kaylee would have appreciated.

Inara thought about the young faces that had surrounded her during the short
time she'd spent at the Training House, about how you can train people to
respect, tend and care for themselves, for their belongings, for other people,
but you cannot teach this level of love, this pure organic appreciation for the
small things.

&quot;It's real pretty, Inara, honest, but...&quot; Kaylee bit her lip as her cheeks
flooded with red. &quot;I got nothin' to give you.&quot;

&quot;I don't need anything, you know that, but if you find yourself overcome with
guilt for no reason, you could always spend some time fine tuning my shuttle.&quot;
There was nothing, as far as she knew, wrong with the workings of her shuttle,
but Inara knew Kaylee hated being in debt, even an imagined debt like this one.
She also knew that Kaylee understood, even if there was nothing wrong with a
machine, it still needed a personal touch every now and again. &quot;In the
meantime, maybe you can wear that one night to impress a certain doctor?&quot;

They shared a smile, secretive and knowing. A weak moment of overt girlishness
and camaraderie that was usually discouraged at the Training House. Companions
are creatures of availability to the right people, and only the right people.
They do not perpetuate any fallacies, however weak and unsubstantiated, of
sharing trade secrets with each other or having a closeness with another person
that supercedes the relationship she has with her present client.

Most likely, Inara mused with a smile, to avoid said person rushing through
said client with a sword.

&quot;I gotta go try this on!&quot; Kaylee leaned over and hugged Inara tightly. &quot;Thanks
so much for this! I mean... if you can spare me? I'll come back and help later,
I promise.&quot;

&quot;You go.&quot; Inara said as she gestured her out of the shuttle. &quot;I'm fairly sure I
can finish here on my own.&quot;

Inara turned back to hanging a screen over the dingy metal of the shuttle. It
was strange, she thought, to compare the two times she'd done it. That first
time, a little over a year before, she'd used all her finery to cover and hide
the obvious ugliness and shoddiness of the materials. Now, now it seemed like
the two belonged together, not so much a contrast, but a joining that enhanced
both the material and the metal.

&quot;I interrupting anything, am I?&quot; She turned to see Mal stride into the shuttle
and take a look around. &quot;You puttin' all these fineries back up for a
reason?&quot;

Inara breathed in and tried to think of something to say and how to say it.

&quot;You're still gonna be entertainin' clients then?&quot;

She looked him in the eye.

&quot;Is that going to be a problem?&quot;

Mal's whole face tightened and his eye twitched a little. Inara could feel it
in the clench of her stomach. She waited for him to use the 'w' word that would
make her instantly regret her decision to stay.

&quot;I reckon so.&quot; He answered, then paused. &quot;But I also reckon it's my problem to
deal with. You're a companion and I can't change that any more'n you can change
the petty thief in me.&quot;

She watched him walk straight up to her and hold out his hand. She watched her
own hand reach out to take his.

&quot;It's about time for dinner, you ready to join us, Miss Serra?&quot;

Inara pressed the softness of it into the worn and weathered grooves of
solidity and was surprised by the complete lack of contrast, it was almost like
they were made for each other.

3. KAYLEE.

It was almost midnight and she could feel her eyes droop heavy, there was so
much to do before Serenity was running at top form again, the engine hummed and
whirred around her, pulsing in the near darkness, she picked up the wrench and
weighed the shining metal in her hand, she'd been just about ready to close the
lid on her tool box when she'd been called out of her reverie.

Kaylee looked up at the hammock hanging in the corner of her engine room and
thought about all the times she'd worked here so late into the night that she'd
ended up just falling asleep right here and never even made it to her bunk. No
one had really noticed or particularly cared, as far as she'd figured, past the
looks she'd get at breakfast when she'd turn up in the same clothes as the day
before, looking all rumpled and not quite right. Inara and Zoe would wear that
same expression of mild concern and Mal, probably the only one of them that
cared about Serenity as much as she did, would nod at her in sympathy, but they
hadn't really said anything about it.

It was nice, in ways she'd always kind of ached for but never really
understood, to have someone that would notice, that would come looking to find
her if she didn't eventually drag her sorry carcass to her bunk and get some
real rest. Nice, even, to have to ignore her ship in ways previously
unforgivable to her so that she could make Simon smile, so that Simon could
make her smile. And they both did it so well.

The nicest part, Kaylee knew it, was that she finally understood her role in
the crew more than she ever had before, maybe more than anyone on the ship
besides River.

It hadn't been easy, in no way would she call the weeks that had followed easy,
because she could remember the heavy silences, the fear of saying the wrong
thing at the wrong time, the watchfulness they all had. The guilt that they
were here and Book and Wash weren't. The absolute horror of the futility and
uselessness of their deaths, of all the deaths that had happened.

Eventually, though, because not even death could stop the life left behind,
there had been times when something would spark someone's interest and they'd
laughed or smiled. Kaylee could remember the stone silence that would happen
when Zoe would walk into the room.

Then, one day, as she and Simon had been sharing laughter over something that
Kaylee couldn't even remember now, Zoe and Mal had walked in. They'd both
stopped suddenly, guiltily, but Kaylee had caught it in Zoe's eyes, a deep and
desperate hunger.

The next time she'd laughed, she'd caught Zoe's eyes and hadn't stopped. She'd
reached out and grabbed Zoe's hand and brought the woman, usually so protective
and hard turned all supple and complying, over to look at the strange
conglomeration of food Simon had tried to present. Zoe hadn't laughed, but
there was a glint in her eye and a reluctant twitch at the corner of her mouth.
A promise for a future much needed.

Kaylee had realized then why they all rallied around her, that when Mal had
voiced his concern about her even picking up a gun he hadn't been babying her
because he thought she couldn't handle it, but because he'd been afraid she
could. That when Jayne needled her about bein' a girl and made comments about
how damned sunny and shiny she was, it was mostly 'cause he wanted to keep her
that way and wasn't able to say it like that.

She was Serenity's good mood and even if that responsibility was very heavy
right now, Kaylee planned to live up to it.

&quot;You're not going to stay in here all night, are you?&quot;

She looked up at Simon and grinned as he poked his head around the door. It was
awfully nice to know that someone was waiting for her, that even if she did
stay here for hours, she could crawl into bed and press up against his warm
body. Sometimes he didn't even wake up, just moved around a bit to accommodate
her, stretching his arm under her head and bringing it around to hold her
against him. It made her warm to think about it.

&quot;Just gotta finish putting these tools away.&quot; She gave him a wink and he
grinned at her in that evil, evil way that meant she better hurry or she'd pay
for it. &quot;You just go make the bed warm for me, 'kay?&quot;

It was almost midnight and Kaylee could feel her eyes droop heavy, there was so
much to do before Serenity was running at top form again, the engine hummed and
whirred around her, pulsing in the near darkness, she picked up the wrench and
weighed the shining metal in her hand, she'd been just about ready to close the
lid on her tool box when she'd been called out of her reverie.

4. JAYNE.

He'd been doin' some thinking and no one knows more'n he does how dangerous a
pastime that is for him, but things had changed and even he can feel it, so he
sat and sharpened the blade and suspected that she knew, even in her slowly
healing but still batshit crazy mind, that he's sharpening it for her, hell,
they probably all knew, but ain't no one gonna say anything if they know what's
good for 'em.

Jayne held no false and fancy ideas about who he was. He don't hold many things
close, man like him can't afford to, it's a hand-to-mouth, hand-to-gun, or
hand-to-grave-digging-shovel 'verse out there. He does what he needs to get by,
it's something he keeps telling himself over and over again, just what's
strictly needed.

Don't mean nothin' that he stood up in the fight against those reavers, that he
helped bring the almighty Alliance down a peg or two. He was only doin' it,
'cause Serenity is the finest gig he's ever had and only a fool would risk
losin' it. They get regular pay, well, regular enough that he can eat decent
most of the times, they get treated more'n fair and he has fun sometimes along
the way. There ain't nothin' more a man needs.

He's fair on sure it started way back with Kaylee, when she got shot and he
couldn't take his eyes off the operation, and only got worse when he, River and
the doc were nabbed by those fed he'd tipped off in Ariel and he couldn't get
the girl's face outta his head, mouth all stretched in terror like that. It
weren't right.

A man like Jayne gets shot at and faces death near on every day, that's his
choice, he chooses the life and he got no right to complain about it. But that
kid never asked to be cut on like the doc said she was, and Kaylee never asked
to be shot at, nor held at gun point by some dick who's scared of dyin' or
threatened with rape by some hundan.

All it did, Jayne knew, all it did was make him want to stick around and make
sure they didn't get their asses into any more trouble. It started with them
and Jayne just couldn't tell when it slipped into something almost like worry
when he saw how bad Zoe was hurtin' and how bad he missed Wash and his
sarcastic jokes or Book an' his eerie ass knowledge of things ain't no preacher
ever knowed before.

He refused to say the word family, absolutely refused.

&quot;Don't need to say it.&quot;

Jayne jumped about a mile and the knife he'd been holding slid clean through
the pad of his thumb.

&quot;Gorram it, girl.&quot; He hissed as he sucked the coppery blood. &quot;Don't you come
near me when I got knives. You hear?&quot;

Damn if she ain't smilin' at him.

&quot;Don't scare me.&quot;

It was like a challenge and he could see the glow in her eyes, she was enjoyin'
it.

&quot;What're you doin' sneakin' up on me, anyways, ain't the doc rantin' and ragin'
about somethin' else Mal wants to take you on?&quot;

She frowned.

&quot;Can't go in my feet. Not even Mal will let me go without shoes.&quot;

Jayne looked at her for a full minute before he spelled it out slowly.

&quot;So put on yer gorram boots, fool.&quot;

She sighed and hefted the said boots onto the bench.

&quot;Tried and tied and tried again. Can't undo them. They won't budge.&quot;

He eyed the godawful knot in the laces and tried to figure out just how out of
her mind she had to be to do that to some perfectly innocent boots. Weren't
nothin' but one solution to a bind like that.

&quot;You have to cut 'em.&quot;

She nodded sagely.

&quot;Leather laces. No ordinary knives will do.&quot;

River smiled at him and then floated away to join Simon and Kaylee across the
cargo bay and left Jayne starin' at some abandoned footwear. He'd be damned if
he was just gonna play lackey and do her biddin' 'cause she asked, well, near
on asked.

He sighed and let his eye slide down the blade in his hand.

Jayne'd been doin' some thinking and no one knows more'n he does how dangerous
a pastime that is for him, but things had changed and even he can feel it, so
he sat and sharpened the blade and suspected that she knew, even in her slowly
healing but still batshit crazy mind, that he's sharpening it for her, hell,
they probably all knew, but ain't no one gonna say anything if they know what's
good for 'em.

5. MAL.

Superstition is an ugly word when you're responsible for peoples' lives, he
knew it, yet he'd never been able to shake the belief that there was a balance
and the good times were always paid for with bad, but he had never questioned
himself as to who paid and who gained and whether it was worth it in the
end.

&quot;Tea?&quot;

He barely needed to ask, he knew she would say yes and he knew that as soon as
he started making it, Inara would smile to herself, walk up next to him and
gently take over. He knew that she knew it, too.

Sometimes her hand would linger on his arm or shoulder and sometimes he would
brush her finger when he took the cup she offered and sometimes, just
sometimes, it would make them both jittery and breathless.

&quot;Are we still on course to land at eleven?&quot;

&quot;Far as I know.&quot; He shrugged and sat down at the table. &quot;I haven't been told
otherwise.&quot;

Their words, sparse as they were, stopped for a while as Mal's finger traced
the pattern of the wood on the table. There were little things he tried not to
see, like the fact that they no longer needed that extra stool to fit people at
the table when they ate. That the chair next to Zoe was always left empty and
the chairs next to Kaylee, Simon, Inara and himself never were. That Jayne
sometimes lifted weights alone and with a viciousness that was almost
foolhardy.

He didn't ask her what she had to do on Aberdeen and she didn't offer, but the
knowledge of it hung heavy between them, waiting.

&quot;Morning, Sir, Inara.&quot;

He looked up to see Zoe in the doorway and, before he could stop himself, his
eyes scanned her up and down, he wasn't sure what he was looking for, just that
he couldn't stop himself checking for it. A weakness, a sign that she wasn't
coping as well as she'd like everyone to believe.

When he got to her eyes, she didn't look away, her brows raised slightly and he
knew that she was getting very close to annoyed with his overt concern. And it
was only going to get worse.

&quot;Jayne and Simon are coming on the job today.&quot; He saw her pause on the way to
the food nooks, a moment to gather herself and curb whatever she was going to
say. &quot;You're staying with the ship.&quot;

&quot;If you think that's necessary, Sir.&quot; Her cup was placed on the bench with a
sharp force that made him wince.

&quot;It's a dangerous job.&quot; He tried to explain. &quot;I don't want you out there right
now.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Zoe sipped her tea.

Fact of the matter was, he had to think about his crew, all of them. It was a
dangerous job and if anything happened he wouldn't be able to handle the guilt
of it, not on top of the guilt he already had. They'd lost two of their crew,
he wasn't about to betray their memory by losing the possibility of
another.

Kaylee and Simon chose that moment to bound into the kitchen and suddenly it
seemed full, the shadowed corners that threatened to implode when it had just
been the three of them.

&quot;Hey Zoe.&quot; Kaylee smiled and Mal thought he saw Zoe smile back. &quot;How're you
feeling today?&quot;

Mal wondered how she did it, how she was able to mother Zoe so blatantly and
not get on the woman's bad side.

&quot;I'm keeping down the tea.&quot; Zoe said. &quot;It's an improvement on yesterday.&quot;

He watched Kaylee and Simon share a glance and saw something in it that
terrified him. It was inevitable, impossible to even think of fighting it, that
Kaylee would hover over Zoe right now, that she would cluck and fuss. He just
hoped she wasn't getting any ideas.

Prayed, as a matter of fact, with the same vim and vigor he used to thank
whatever deity for Zoe's health, for the possibility of laughter again, with
the kind of faith he hadn't allowed himself in a long, long time.

A smile edged the corners of Inara's mouth and he knew that she understood what
he was thinking. Woman had always gotten under his skin like that, the only
difference was that he didn't mind it quite so much anymore.

Superstition is an ugly word when you're responsible for peoples' lives, Mal
knew it, yet he'd never been able to shake the belief that there was a balance
and the good times were always paid for with bad, but he had never questioned
himself as to who paid and who gained and whether it was worth it in the
end.

6. RIVER

It was like living underwater, drifting through the throbbing pulse and eddy of
it, she let herself bend with the flow and didn't question it, didn't explain
it to anyone, even if they asked, because some things weren't meant to be told.

Her feet held the weight of her body, River pressed them into the metal of the
ship, letting the steel grating force lines into her flesh as she walked. The
balance of her body was held somewhere deep in her belly, the center of her,
the midpoint of her hips, the place where she could breathe in and tighten
everything to a point. Make it all so small she couldn't be seen.

Her brain, everyone had said it in one way or another, even if it wasn't out
loud, held the horror of her.

She knew different, but she didn't elaborate, her brain held the horror of
everyone else. She didn't tell them this, because she didn't want them to know,
to ask about it, to crave answers she couldn't give them.

They all tried, even if they didn't want to, she could feel it trickle over her
like eggs cracked over her skull, slimy and slick. A small hint, or a glance, a
hidden look, they wanted to know what she saw, what she has seen, what has seen
her.

And maybe, if she closed her eyes and wished real hard, maybe the one person
who deserved and needed it most of all wouldn't ask her. She'd never been that
lucky.

Zoe sat in the pilot's chair, already eaten up by her memories, torturing and
soothing herself all at once by touching the plastic toys. River understood it,
knew the feeling well, like pressing a wound that's trying to heal, wanting it
to ache that little bit more.

Sometimes she couldn't let go of it, the memory of struggling to breathe, to
fight through the light and sound and color and those voices, the Universe
pressing into her, stealing every bit of her that she could spare and some she
couldn't. Pain that made her want to scream until she wished she could stop
screaming.

Sometimes it was like a dream, like it happened to someone else, someone else
whose throat bled from the very agony of it.

She almost wanted Zoe to look at her, pierce her through with those dark eyes,
and demand to know whether she knew it would happen, if she saw it happen
before it really did, because it was a question she could answer. No, she
doesn't see the will happen of things, she sees the has happened and the is
happening, she sees what other people see. This is something she could have
said. It's the question that Zoe does ask, so often inside her head and this
time out loud, that River dreaded.

&quot;Did you hear him when it happened, what was going through his head?&quot;

River didn't know how to answer this, not then and not now, how to say the
words so they won't hurt. No and yes all at the same time. She heard
everything, it's not like she can filter anything when it's loud and vibrant,
when peoples' emotions and thoughts are running so rampant they can't control
it themselves.

She felt the elation of his flying, the fear of Jayne being thrown about the
ship, the triumph of Mal getting through the Alliance, Kaylee crying out loud
with the crash and screech of metal, the sudden scream of Zoe's head when she
saw what had happened, a blankness that might have been Wash's last coherent
thought or just the space it left behind, Mal's horror. It was all a jumble and
none of it the pretty images Zoe wanted.

Zoe didn't want to hear about the hole River saw spreading through her chest,
at the same height that killed Wash, malignant and oozing. Or the red that
splashed through the name of her husband when it came from her own lips.

&quot;No.&quot;

The sad way that Zoe smiled was enough for River to know she hadn't quite
fallen for the answer, even without the waves that came from her.

A plastic tree tumbled end over end in Zoe's hands. River watched it, let
herself fall into the movement of it and tried to close her ears to the
question that followed. It was unavoidable, she knew Zoe was going to ask and
she knew a million ways to answer her to make her happy, most of them the
truth, but that wasn't how it worked.

It never was.

&quot;Can you feel it now? Will everything be okay?&quot;

She felt the plea in Zoe's voice before she heard it, the desperate need to
know, to stop the hope that had already begun to sprout if there was no need
for it, the hope that would close the gaping invisible hole. Zoe's hands
stopped twirling the tree and sat it on the curve of her abdomen, planted it
there and trembled.

It was like living underwater, drifting through the throbbing pulse and eddy of
it, River let herself bend with the flow and didn't question it, didn't explain
it to anyone, even if they asked, because some things weren't meant to be
told.

7. ZOE.

She missed the feel of leather bound around her neck, the air that caressed the
skin there felt like loss all over again, like a tease of memory that made her
ache, she was tired of missing him.

Zoe sat on the bed, the empty bed, and stared at the walls of their bunk, their
empty bunk. Now hers and hers alone. Her lonely sanctuary. An escape from the
watchful eyes of those around her.

They meant well and she knew it, understood it and was grateful that she had so
many people in her life that cared so much, but it was tiring, overwhelming
sometimes, to play her part in it.

It wasn't as if she hadn't seen loss and bloodshed before, hell, she and Mal
had lived it during the war, had cut their adult teeth on it. She knew and
understood the platitudes of these situations, a hero's death, fighting for a
cause, had spoken them before and would no doubt speak them again. She even
realized they were right.

Anger and denial were never part of her feelings over Wash's death, it was more
of a numb acceptance. It had happened and she had to move on. The truth was
that Wash knew the risks of the job, his life had been in danger everyday since
he'd stepped foot on Serenity and he'd signed on the proverbial dotted line. A
good majority of their arguments had revolved around the very theme of mortal
danger that they were both in.

In some deep part of her thoughts she was barely ready to acknowledge, let
alone examine, Zoe knew she had been selfish. Selfish in that she had always
assumed she would be the one to go first, that she wouldn't be the one left
behind to clean up the mess and deal with the hard fact of grieving.

Her penance to this cause was to go on breathing, to get up everyday and try to
eat, to watch everyone on the ship learn to live again, to slowly say goodbye
to a part of herself she never wanted to. Some days were easier than others and
Zoe found herself hungry for the sound of living again, for the thrum of life
that didn't stop beating.

There was one thing she would not do and that was to give in, because he had
always loved her strength, had marveled in it just as she had loved the purity
of him, the delight he brought to her world. So she stayed strong, because that
was how he'd liked her best.

Strong and upright, she refused to bend and her hands deftly worked at the
string of leather, smoothing it, warming it with her fingers until it was
supple and yielding in her grasp. There wasn't much to spare aboard Serenity,
but she was working on getting a new stone, a new symbol. She knew the others
would chip in if she asked them and probably even if she didn't.

The wedding band she'd had wrapped around her neck for too short a time had
stayed back on his grave, a place she knew she'd rarely visit, because she
didn't need a rock to remember her husband.

The bond she wanted to wind around her neck this time went deeper than the
words husband and wife, it ran all the way through their blood, wound them
together in ways that were so beautiful she didn't have the words to describe
it.

It moved her, moved inside a place she'd thought so empty. This was why she had
to move on and stay strong.

Zoe missed the feel of leather bound around her neck, the air that caressed the
skin there felt like loss all over again, like a tease of memory that made her
ache, she was tired of missing him.
