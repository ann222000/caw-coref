This is a serious question that has grown out of an argument on another
thread.  I know that retrievers like labs and chessies are bred to
retrieve, and retrieve in that context means bringing back ducks, maybe
in a field trial.

Then there's the bring it back game that lots of dogs, not necessarily
retrievers, enjoy.  With Cubbe, this means a ball in a sock.  With my
brother's flop eared mustard colored mutt, it meant frisbees.  Is that
called fetching?

I ask because I can see where some things that are important to one are
irrelevent to the other.  I don't really care if Cubbe shakes and
pounces on the ball-in-sock before bringing it to me.  I can see where
that might be a problem with a duck.  Same for concepts of hard mouth,
soft mouth, forced retrieve and tug.  Vital to get it right in some
circumstances, irrelevent in others.  What's the right terminology?

A retrieve comes in many forms, but a retrieve by any other name is still
a retrieve.
Some venues penalize style points.

It's all retrieving, Julia.

But the degree of difficulty changes, depending on the venue.

The field-trial venue, for example, is for expert retrievers only.
Field-trial dogs will compete in a number of series on a typical trial
weekend. Each series may include 4-5 different retrieves, and at
varying distances, up to 400 yards away from the handler.

Plus, each series is set up to fool the dog. Using prevailing the
grounds' structure, wind direction, &quot;poison&quot; birds, gunshots, etc. The
idea is to eliminate as many dogs as possible, and as quickly as
possible.

Some of the retrieves will be what are called &quot;marks.&quot; That's where
both the dog and the handler get to see where the bird falls to the
ground out in the field. The dog is expected to remember where each
bird (the bird can be a duck, goose, pheasant, pigeon, etc.) has
fallen, and when sent to retrieve each bird, do it in the fastest,
most expedient manner possible, which is always in a straight line,
and at full speed. That means if there are two ponds, each 50-100
yards in circumference, between the dog and the bird, the dog must
swim across each pond (no, he can't run around it), perhaps up and
down a hill or two, plus cross several roads, a culvert, etc.,
remember exactly where the bird fell, and then pick it up and return
with it to the handler. If the dog veers off course, he's stopped by
the whistle of the handler, and then sent off in a new direction.

He can't drop the bird (otherwise it might escape), he can't play with
the bird (takes up valuable time, because there are more birds to be
retrieved), and he can't munch on it (who wants to eat a munched up
bird?), either.

There are also retrieves called &quot;blinds.&quot;  A blind retrieve is where
only the handler knows where the bird has been planted in the field,
not the dog.  Many blind retrieves are conducted out to 300 yards or
so.  The dog is sent off in the direction of the fall, in a straight
line, of course, and if he remains on that straight line, he'll
eventually either see or scent the fallen bird, and then he'll pick it
up and return to the line with it.  The &quot;line&quot; is where the handler
must stay during the entire series.  He can use verbal commands,
whistle commands, and hand signals, to direct the dog to each bird.

A good field-trial retriever will need very little or no handling when
sent on a mark, but is expected to be handled somewhat for a blind
retrieve.  But each &quot;handle&quot; costs the dog points. He's also graded on
style, speed, memory, nose, determination, training, etc.

In real hunting situations, a retriever may be called upon to wrangle
a crippled and very pissed off 20 pound goose, flapping around out in
the middle of a lake, and in frigid weather, and return it to his
handler unharmed.

It's takes a very special dog to be able to do things like that, and
special training, too.

But it's his JOB at this point, and he thrives on doing it.

Anyway, a fun retrieve is always better than no retrieve, but they
should never be confused with what happens out in the field.

If you've clicker-trained her to retrieve, and she retrieves for you

It sounds like she has a nice &quot;play&quot; retrieve, and enjoys it.

Just don't invite any field-trial Labs over to the house, cuz they
might retrieve the ball-in-sock *and* Cubbe, and drop them both in
your lap, before circling back to look for your husband.

I heard a funny story about my father-in-law's first Chocolate Lab,
when he encountered his first pissed off goose when hunting.  He got
fed up with the goose fighting him and just laid down on top of it to
pin it to the ground.  Not a good retrieve, but it probably could have
at least made it onto America's Funniest Home Videos.  The same dog
tried to walk out onto a log into a pond to get the mark that was just
out of his reach at his first trial.  Everyone thought it was
hilarious as he tried to balance on this log so he didn't have to get
wet.  He ended up just being the family lab.

Reka disagrees.  She is very curly tailed, yet totally is into jumping into
icy waters, and retrieving flailing geese trying to drown her. She's an
awesome duck dog too, with a non-traditional curly tail and nordic breed to
boot.

Cubbe is marginally O.K. with water falling from the sky.  She doesn't
love it, but if it is just a drizzle, she puts up with it for the sake
of being outside.  Even if it pours, she takes it in stride.

But puddles?!  She's hysterical.  She approaches cautiously.  She does
dainty leaps over them.  Once she barked at a stream that had formed
from a sudden squall.  She's learned to put up with the annual bath, but
can't shake herself off fast enough when it's done.  I suppose she'd
learn to swim fast enough if I threw her in water, but as she gets
plenty of exercise shore side, I've never seen the point in that experiment.

I think thats a good idea too.

Reka got her debut in swimming when we were doing winter beaver trapping.
My husband took off across the water in a canoe to check his beaver traps.
I stayed on the banks. There was an ice shelf, and Reka headed out on the
ice shelf and it broke, tossing her into the brink.  She flailed around
and then started out after my husband in the canoe.  she swam across the
lake and back again, and has become a water dog ever since. Her double
coat traps a lot of air, and she curiously swims as if she has floatation,
with the top half of her body out of water.
I've never seen a dog swim so high in the water.

That's the response for a lot of retrievers, too.

Unfortunately.

At least Cubbe has a good excuse.

&quot;The main proponents of 'universal coverage' want to throw more money at the current health care system,
