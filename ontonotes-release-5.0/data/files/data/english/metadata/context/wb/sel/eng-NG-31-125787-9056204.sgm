My ADSL modem cuts out whenever my wife uses a walking machine and
cannot reconnect until the walking machine is off again.

Anyone know why this might be?  The walking machine is at the other end
of the house and I have tried plugging it into many different power
sockets in the house with exactly the same result.  Obviously I would be
quite keen to solve this...

When the walking machine is going, does your phone get any interference ?

I just checked, turned the machine on, sure enough the modem died but
the dial tone sounds very clear, I can't hear any crackling or any other
noticeable audible interference...

&gt; ISP blows the whistle on router chip 'fault'
&gt; Market-leading hardware doubted

&gt; Exclusive: One of the UK's best-respected broadband providers has raised concerns about the reliability of the world's most popular ADSL chip.
&gt; Zen Internet has uncovered a potential problem with the Texas Instruments AR7. The chip is at the heart of about a third of routers in use worldwide today - including Linksys and Netgear kit.
&gt; Zen has told its customers not to buy models that contain the chip because they provide an unstable connection.

Also, you might want to get an electrician to check your mains earth, try a
different power supply for the modem (make sure the voltage and polarity are
correct), or try earthing the modem itself (that may not be trivial).

An isolation transformer on the washing machine may help if you have one
kicking about.

I assume by walking machine you mean something like a treadmill type
exercise machine with variable speeds?

If so my first guess is that it is switching some resonably inductive
loads to do the speed control without adequate filtering of the nasty
spikes this tends to cause. These spikes are making there way back to
your DSL modem either via the electrical power circuit, or possibly (but
less likely) via the telephone lines. If you have a mate who is
reasonably electrically competent you can usually salvage a low pass
filter from an old PC power supply and get him to make up a cable to go
between the walking machine and the wall to cut this down. However the
best option would be to get the walking machine repaired if its under
warranty.

Another option is to wind the power lead that goes to the DSL modem thru
a ferrite ring a few times and see if that helps.

Only problem is I dont know where you can easily lay your hands on one

Avoid the cheap &quot;surge protector&quot; wall wart type devices, they have a
limited life when dealing with this sort of spike.

The machine is probably 10 years old now.. though it was in storage for
the last 9... I actually just googled the problem and found someone else
with exactly the same problem and they plugged the treadmill into a UPS
which solved the problem so I might see if I can find a old UPS with a
dead battery which should be dirt cheap and give that a go..

A shame DSE no longer sell the ferrite rings, didn't even know what that
was but now I know what the things are on the end of the USB cables !
always wondered about them heh.

Thanks for your help

Not a chance, your computer already contains such surge supression which will
protect other devices connected close by.

They will not help sag from inrush to the motor and their spike suppression
will not deal with back emf from a motor of any size especially if driven by a
poorly designed switch mode power supply.

The Warehouse were selling black 4 way plugboards with surge suppression for
$4.99. Perhaps they still do.

It would probably be worth trying running a heater on the same power point as
the walker, but keep it down to 1200W to avoid overloading the circuit. That
should damp the worst inductive excursions.

Power factor correction may help on the walker. Depends on how it's built.

Walking outside is much more attractive these days.

Ok thanks guys, I will try another power supply, actually have two, just
noticed that the power supplies are AC, is that strange? just seems most
power supplies for small electronic items are DC, yet lots of modems
seem to have AC supplies.  I'll try the heater idea also.

Just curious as to why you said I should get an electrician to check if
we are grounded?

Yeah walking outside is a lot nicer too

&gt; find a old UPS with a dead battery which should be dirt cheap and
&gt; give that a go..
&gt; A shame DSE no longer sell the ferrite rings, didn't even know what
&gt; that was but now I know what the things are on the end of the USB
&gt; cables ! always wondered about them heh.

Go to:

http://www.jaycar.co.nz/index.asp

And enter CAT. NO. LF1292 into the search box. They actually stock three
sizes, that one's a good size as you can pass the power cable through a few
times.

Not as cheap as a basic ferrite ring but it will do the same job more
tidily. Also, if you have any old PC gear around, the cases often had the
leads going to the front panel switches going through a ferrite ring. Also,
some monitor cables etc. had plastic-encased ferrite 'rings' clipped around
them. You might be able to scavenge something.

Actually, if you're not in too much of a hurry, email me on misfitnz at
gmail with your postal address and I'll send you one. I've just checked my
&quot;bits and pieces&quot; drawer and I have two of the clip around type so you're
welcome to one. :-)

I think these guys do Ferrite Rings:

http://www.tradetech.co.nz

Click on 'Parts Search' in the top left, and type in Ferrite - I got a
few hits.

I can't help with what you actually need though!

it MAY still be valid, but may also have been

&gt; I assume by walking machine you mean something like a treadmill type
&gt; exercise machine with variable speeds?

&gt; If so my first guess is that it is switching some resonably
&gt; inductive loads to do the speed control without adequate filtering
&gt; of the nasty spikes this tends to cause. These spikes are making
&gt; there way back to your DSL modem either via the electrical power
&gt; circuit, or possibly (but less likely) via the telephone lines. If
&gt; you have a mate who is reasonably electrically competent you can
&gt; usually salvage a low pass filter from an old PC power supply and
&gt; get him to make up a cable to go between the walking machine and the
&gt; wall to cut this down. However the best option would be to get the
&gt; walking machine repaired if its under warranty.

&gt; Another option is to wind the power lead that goes to the DSL modem
&gt; thru a ferrite ring a few times and see if that helps.

&gt; Only problem is I dont know where you can easily lay your hands on
&gt; one in NZ. DSE is no longer any use for this type of thing.

&gt; Avoid the cheap &quot;surge protector&quot; wall wart type devices, they have
&gt; a limited life when dealing with this sort of spike.

&gt;When the walking machine is going, does your phone get any interference ?

Um ... what is a 'walking machine' ? I know it doesn't matter ... but any
clues would be welcome :)

Thanks
