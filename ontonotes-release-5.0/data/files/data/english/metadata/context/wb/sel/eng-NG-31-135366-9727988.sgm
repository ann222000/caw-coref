Just days before CES 2008, Warner Home Video has announced that they
are going to stop supporting HD-DVD and support the Blu-Ray format
exclusively. There are rumors that this decision was made after Sony
paid Warner 1.8 billion dollars to sign an exclusive contract, one of
the largest payoffs yet (the second largest being 150 million to
Paramount and Dreamworks to go HD-DVD exclusively.)

Warner's official response, however, was:
&quot;In response to consumer demand, Warner Bros. Entertainment will
release its high-definition DVD titles exclusively in the Blu-ray disc
format beginning later this year&quot; it was announced today by Barry
Meyer, Chairman &amp; CEO, Warner Bros. and Kevin Tsujihara, President,
Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group.

After August 2007, Sir Howard Stringer, CEO of Sony said that the Blu-
Ray format was in a stalemate. &quot;It's a difficult fight. We were trying
to win on the merits, which we were doing for a while, until Paramount
changed sides,&quot; Howard Stringer told the AP.

Blu-Ray was winning the HD format war in North America and Asia, but
not Europe, until the Dreamworks/Paramount buyout.

Many consider this new Warner Home Video buyout to be the end of the
format war completely.

Rumor has it that over a Billion$ was involved this time.  But who
cares?

Let's assume that this is the death-knell of HDDVD for the moment.  Did
BluRay win?  NO!!

Well, not unless you count holding on to a 1-2% niche as winning.  To
gain the mass-market, they need a sub $200 player, imo.  But Sony, as
well as others, have insisted that they are not interested in going to
the low price model that permeates the SD DVD market today.  So now
we'll see just how badly they really want the mass market.

Will we see a sub-$200 player soon?
What about all those sales that have pushed the actual selling price of
BD movies to the $15 pricepoint?  Will they still happen?

Watching this unfold should be interesting and it certainly isn't the
time to give up the old Netflix subsrcription...  :)

They will as soon as companies can stop holding back production and the
cost of equipment to a &quot;niche&quot; level, and begin to accept one product as
being more available in the mainstream--
Thus making the parts, disks, and production more available at a lower
cost, thus lowering the costs of movies and players across the board,
and, UNLIKE last-ditch fire sales, *keeping* prices lower.

Which's kind of the whole point of the &quot;There can only be One&quot; war in
the first place.
Some of us remember the days before June 1999, and we're not itching to
have $799 DVD players and $39.95 disks back again.

Glad I picked the right HD format.  I wouldn't call this the death-knell for
the so-called format war just yet though.

And seriously, no one in their right mind should expect Universal to roll
over and start churning out BR titles by Spring.  Also, I wonder where this
leaves Paramount and Dreamworks.  Are those studios stuck releasing their
product on HD-DVDs for the next couple of years or however long their
&quot;agreement&quot; with Toshiba/Microsoft is supposed to last?

Considering the writer's strike dragging on and no to the point it'll likely
kill the Fall tv season as well as delay a lot of production on various
movies, I wonder if studios will be more apt to rush release a lot of
product to compensate for lost revenue?

Universal's not happy, but they're still Microsoft's personal prison-b*tch--

Their &quot;agreement&quot; was 18 months, ending (conveniently) in Feb. '09.

And yeah, from what we've seen from sales and statements, they'll just

I would.  Even the staunchest HD DVD supporters are conceding defeat in
the HD forums.  It's not &quot;officially&quot; over, but it's only a matter of
time now.  I wouldn't be surprised if Toshiba pulled the plug long
before their remaining exclusive contracts expire.

You haven't been paying attention to Sony, et al.  They have been very
vocal that they will not go down the el-cheapo road with BluRay.  We'll
see if they can hold to that or not.

But they HAVE to do something to attract the masses if they want to be
anything other than a niche product.  That something is at least one
sub-$200 player, you gotta hit that impulse buy pocket.  $350+ for a
player doesn't get that done.

And then there is the MSRP on BD disks.  Fox's are almost always at $40,
others not too far below.  The WAR got us the BOGO sales and others to
drive down the real cost to $15.  So let's see what happens to all those
sales, and really let us see what happens to MSRP.

There is serious dollar considerations that haven't been addressed to
bring HiDef DVDs to the masses.

It's not like Sony is the only one that's going to be selling players
and movies.  I think this will actually accelerate reduction in prices,
now that people can embrace one format.  It means more buyers, and thus,
more competition for their money.

One only has to look at history with VHS, CD and DVD formats.  They all
rapidly decreased in price as they got more mainstream.

That is exactly the history that Sony and others don't want to happen.
Between DRM and holding the profits up on the movies and players, which
is what Sony was pushing all of them with, don't expect lowering of
prices anytime soon.

I think it will happen, just as slowly as they can drag it out.  They
want to make their bundle before the downward price pressure takes over.
It's either that or get relegated to niche status.

Now BD is in the real war, with standard DVD's.  This is a different
animal.  Well entrenched, cheap and good enough for most of the average
viewer.  It is potentially a very tough nut to crack.

&gt; format beginning later this year&quot; it was announced today by Barry
&gt; Meyer, Chairman &amp; CEO, Warner Bros. and Kevin Tsujihara, President,
&gt; Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group.

&gt; After August 2007, Sir Howard Stringer, CEO of Sony said that the Blu-
&gt; Ray format was in a stalemate. &quot;It's a difficult fight. We were trying
&gt; to win on the merits, which we were doing for a while, until Paramount
&gt; changed sides,&quot; Howard Stringer told the AP.

&gt; Blu-Ray was winning the HD format war in North America and Asia, but
&gt; not Europe, until the Dreamworks/Paramount buyout.

&gt; Many consider this new Warner Home Video buyout to be the end of the
&gt; format war completely.

We can only hope that hd-dvd can pull something out of their hats, for
the North-American market, but even if they could, it would still mean
that both formats will linger side-by-side for years to come. Can the
world handle two Hi-Def markets? Besides all of the so-called
&quot;Confused&quot; Hi-Def consumers, if those people even exist, I believe we
could handle it. Ya know, he who has an HD-DVD player keeps his HD-DVD
player, Blu-Ray, and vice versa.

Retailers have other ideas. They only want what is sold off of store
shelves as fast as possible for as much profit as possible, and maybe
as much kickbacks as possible. So, places like blockbuster started the
&quot;Retailers can choose who wins the format war&quot; game. A few chose blu-
ray, a few chose HD-DVD, and many remained neutral. While that
probably did help blu-ray a bit, the next move was about the studio
support. Paramount went to HD-DVD, and now, a major studio with even
more in their movie library went to blu-ray, and now, the war seems
all but over in North-America.

-

At least we have appx 500 titles in North-America, probably 100 or
more unique titles in other continents that are easily imported, and
even though North-American and Japanese HD-DVD may be doomed, many
Europeans have embraced the HD-DVD format over Blu-Ray, although blu-
ray camp will try to dispell that. Here are just a few European
studios releasing movies for HD-DVD:

Paramount, Dreamworks,
Kinowelt (T-2), Toshiba (Band of brothers), Concorde (Silent Hill,
Underworld, Tomb Raider),
Constantine Films (releasing sony's Resident Evil Trilogy in Germany),
universal, Studio Canal (Releasing Disney, MGM, and Fox movies),
Weinstein Company (Grindhouse), highlight (perfume, story of murder,
fantastic four, rise of the silver surfer), dfw (dutch film works, Saw
trilogy), EMS, Filmax (Underworld Evolution), Galileo, TF1 (Le vie en
rose), Monolith Films (mr and mrs smith), Ascot Elite (Bug), Universum
Film (crank), Imagion, Pathe (enemy at the gates), SHV, SPI (Hannibal
Rising), DeA Plaeta (American Haunting), Moviemax (bridge to
terabithia), Optimum (brotherhood of the wolf), etc.

As you can see, HD-DVD has a whole lot of studio support in Europe. HD-
DVD isn't going anywhere any time soon.

Here are several links to places any one can buy import hd-dvd titles.
There could literally be thousands more HD-DVDs released in Europe in
the coming years, including blu-ray exclusive releases in the US. Some
examples of blu-ray exclusives released or going to be released soon
on HD-DVD imports: fantastic four, fantastic four rise of the silver
surfer, silent hill, Resident Evil Trilogy and CGI (RE1 in Japan,
RE1-3 in Germany, RE degeneration in Germany), Bridge to Terabithia
(Disney, Spain, Italian), Rambo Trilogy (Australia, UK, France, etc)
and many others.

I Greatly resent being called a Troll!

I've owned Sony products over the years and have gotten screwed by them
time after time.  I bought their CDP-101 CD player in 1982 (at $1000) it
crapped out 2 days after the warranty expired.  They wanted like $400 to
repair it!  I just pitched it in the trash. :-(

this whole blu ray vs hd dvd 'war' thing seems to me like 2 people fighting
over a small bit of overgrown land while living next door to someone who
owns a mansion - that person being dvd.
neither hd dvd or blu ray can 'win' until such time as they are selling in
large quantities comparable, or greater than dvd.

before then it's just a fight to see who can be the new laserdisc.

HD-DVDs are not region encoded and any disc can be played worldwide in any
HD player.  Blu-ray supports region encoding however not all titles are

Easy.  A lot of people have been standing on the sidelines, waiting for
a winner to emerge.  Now that one apparently has, more people will buy
into it, and thus, competition among manufacturers and studios will
reduce prices, and production cost/disc will decrease as production
increases.

You know, just like VHS, CD and DVD.  The format war wasn't increasing
competition; it was stifling it, due to the fact a great many people
weren't willing to buy into a possible losing format on either side.

if the BD standalone player prices don't

if BD were all that existed, i wouldn't

maybe CHDA will be what it takes to

Let us help kill HD-DVD.

The confusion over two formats has not only slowed down the adoption
of HD, but has also slowed regular DVD sales as the confusion
persists.  Re-stating the obvious: Blu Ray is better for two reasons:

1. Layer for layer, it holds more data meaning more content  over
time.

2. It has no Microsoft hegemonic.  In fact it is because of greedy
Microsoft that there are two formats.  This will help nail the cover
on the format coffin.  Blu Ray consortium tried to come to terms with
Toshiba/Microsoft back in 2005.  The gorillas ran away and persisted
with HD-DVD.  It will cost them and their supporters (Universal,
Dreamworks, etc). billions for trying to be greedy.

Precisely my point.  Less uncertainty means more consumers, which will
lead to lower prices.  One only has to look at the history of VHS, CD
and DVD formats.  Once people became confident in the stability of those
formats, demand went up, and prices came down due to competition and
manufacturing costs.

i'll believe it when i see *lower* prices
for BD *standalone* players

to paraphrase what a few others have said:
&quot;the companies go where the money is at&quot;

i personally find it hard to believe that
this move by Warner is &quot;where the money is at&quot;

if anything, it is an especially dumb move
by Warner

tune in again, 24 months, for an update

till then, i have no plans for buying any
BD hi-def stuff.  maybe CHDA, if and when
it shows up here (USA), but NOT BD

i also can't help but wonder if Warner
will really also shitcan Europe?

you really don't know?

i mean, google shows 1,340 n/g posts
by you

i only looked at the 1st couple of pages,
but a lot of it is various video related
newsgroups.  :)

me?  i'm new to this

from my long computer experience
(IBM mainframe, UNIX, and PC networking)
this looks like a repeat of the PC s/w copy
protection wars that were largely fought thru
the 80's and early 90's

the one's that focused on copy protection are
now 99+% dead

Gates had/has a brain on this, but it is clear
to me that Warner does not

I guess you don't have one...

Extremely slow load times by all but 2 of the current players.  Mostly
caused by BD using BD-Java and then not making HW good enough to run it
fast enough.

Constant firmware upgrades.  Almost everytime a new blockbuster comes
out.

An uncertain spec.  Profile 1.0, the original, is still the most
dominant and all of the current 1.0 boxes cannot be upgraded at all.

That's just off the top of my head.

If it wasn't for the PS3 and the Panasonic BD-30, you could say all the
rest are worse than the $29 DVD players from China and be right.

As Bill Hunt put it in the Digital Bits:
---
http://www.thedigitalbits.com/mytwocentsa148.html#itsover
Warner could have done one of three things: Go Blu-ray exclusive, go
HD-DVD exclusive, or stay neutral. It's apparent from their statement
this morning that Warner knows as well as we do that this format war is
confusing consumers and hurting the chances for high-def packaged media
in the long run. While early adopters online have been happily
back-biting each other these past two years, most folks elsewhere on
planet Earth have just issued a collective yawn. Meanwhile, those
non-early adopter consumers who are actually interested in high-def
discs have sat on the sidelines waiting for the axe to fall on one of
these formats. So for Warner, staying neutral just wasn't an option
anymore. The question then becomes, if you're going to make a change in
strategy, you want to make one that's going to impart genuine forward
momentum on the situation. Warner going HD-DVD exclusive would have
effectively created a 50/50 split in Hollywood studio support for these
formats, resulting in an even bigger stalemate than already exists, and
probably closing the door completely on either of these formats ever
gaining widespread acceptance. On the other hand, Warner going Blu-ray
only makes that studio split 70/30. It effectively gives Blu-ray
exclusive access to 70% of Hollywood studio content. And that's not only
a game changer, it's a game ender.
---

And interesting to see that HD's only biggest counterattack so far is to
try and scrape up any last remaining Sony-is-evil sentiment from last
year to hope to play the &quot;They musta been bribed!&quot; card--Seeing from
firsthand evidence how much animosity the public has against...a format
that's been bribed.
The one fault of trying to &quot;drag your opponent down to your own level&quot;
is that it only reminds observers of just what level that is...And
somehow, I don't think there's much future in the PR counter-strategy of
&quot;Yeah, wouldn't it be something if *they'd* had as much public
embarrassments as WE'VE had!&quot;  9_9
