already paid for mine in full.    played about 10 minutes of the full
game at GameStop this past Wednesday, very much like the controls.
looking forward to playing the game.    unlike most hi-def Xbox360 and
PS3 games,    Metroid Prime 3 runs at 60fps, 99% of the time, but with
larger environments, better lighting, particle effects, textures,
depth of field blur than MP or MP2 on Gamecube.     best of all, MP
games are difficult. won't be finishing MP3 nearly as fast as I
finished Zelda: TP.      also, no major gimicks like the totally not-
cool dark world in MP2.  It seems MP3 brings back everything that was
great about the original MP and brings it up several notches in
visuals and especially control.

Hands-on Metroid Prime 3: Corruption
We play through the first third of Samus Aran's latest adventure.
Detailed impressions and 60 glorious 480p screenshots.
by Matt Casamassina

August 22, 2007 - Metroid Prime 3: Corruption begins as space-drifting
heroine Samus Aran awakens from a cryogenic sleep to a fleet of
Federation Ships. In a first for the acclaimed franchise, you take
control of the character well before her feet touch the ground. Your
initial mission is to guide her Hunter-Class Gunship to Docking Bay
Five on the enormous battleship, S.S. Olympus. While you can engage
its thrusters and tinker around with several of its in-cockpit
gadgets, including a screen that tallies exactly how many kills you've
amassed and even how many times you've shot your weapon, you don't
ever really control Aran's ship so much as you select positions on a
galactic map for it to fly toward. (Later, you'll be able to call the
ship to Aran's side -- it can rain down extra firepower when necessary
or, bare minimum, function as a portable save system, literally flying
a save portal your way.) Before you've got a moment to ponder the fact
that the game's epic storyline is delivered by way of genuine and very
well acted voice work -- all the humanoid characters save for Samus
have speaking parts -- the Space Pirates are attacking and soon after
you're off on a quest to save the galaxy.

Right off the bat, you're going to notice several major differences
between Metroid Prime 3: Corruption and its predecessors. The most
immediately obvious are the graphical enhancements. Not only does
Corruption run in both 480p and 16:9 widescreen (another first for the
series), but it dishes out larger, more detailed environments, crisper
textures, dramatically improved particle effects, depth of field blur,
screen shakes, and what is easily the best utilization of bloom
lighting in any Wii game to date. It may seem like a trivial inclusion
to some -- games like Ico, for example, have developed visual styles
that revolve around bloom lighting -- but developer Retro Studios has
taken it to the next level. Environments, objects and particle effects
alike are illuminated with a neon-like hue that fits exceptionally
well within the game's science-fiction setting. Other visual additions
are more pronounced. When bringing up Aran's scan-visor (activated by
pressing the minus button on the Wii remote), you will now see the
bounty hunter's face clearly reflected -- not just for a split second,
as in previous titles, but permanently. That face may even show signs
of change as you advance through the game.

Corruption is further differentiated from Echoes in that its
environments are incredibly varied. You won't be exploring drab purple
Dark Worlds in this adventure, which spans across multiple planets,
each with a highly stylized appearance. Like the original Prime,
you'll travel from space station to earthly locales that marry the
high-tech with the biological. Retro has designed environments that we
didn't think were possible on Wii -- walls with jutting pipes,
holographic displays, sparking particles, and all of them multilayered
so that you will be able to see pistons chugging back and forth
beneath glass walkways. The effect is very impressive indeed. Just as
impressive, though, is that Corruption runs at an uninterrupted, silky
smooth 60 frames per second 99.9% of the time. Through the first third
of the game, we only noticed one point where the fluidity dipped --
very momentarily -- below 60 frames. Since Prime 3's new control
scheme enables a more intense shooting experience than previously
possible, that speed goes a long way.

We were prepared to be disappointed by Prime 3's visual presentation
because many of the early screenshots and videos designed to represent
the title frankly did a poor job of it. However, the truth is that
Corruption is the best looking Prime game to date and very easily
Wii's flagship visual stunner. That honor may be handed over to Super
Mario Galaxy upon its release, but for now Samus has earned it. For
those who care, we'd like to point out now that Corruption does not
run in full 854x480 resolution, but rather something closer to 825x470
-- it's still pro-scan widescreen, but it won't fill your entire
screen. (The screens we posted with this story show the black borders,
as the game may appear on some televisions.)

What of gameplay, though? How has that changed? Well, for once, Samus
does not take some level of highly inconvenient first-stage battle
damage that somehow results in the loss of her extra special
abilities. She starts with her trademark Varia Suit, which is equipped
with morphball, bombs, double-jump and standard power beam. Within 10
minutes, she gains missiles, and only keeps upgrading from there.
We're not going to spoil the upgrade system, but as any hardcore
followers have very probably already spotted in numerous screenshots,
Aran gains a new Phazon Enhancement Device, or PED Suit, that
dramatically changes her appearance and works hand-in-and with
Corruption's central theme. Samus is able to use this special new suit
to go into hyper mode (by holding plus button), at which point time
appears to slow down and she can unleash a powerful onslaught of
gunfire, but it comes at a cost. If she stays in hyper mode for too
long, she runs the risk of becoming corrupted and quite possibly
dying. There's an integral balance required when going into hyper mode
and it only increases as the bounty hunter progresses and enemies
become more difficult.

Corruption plays better than any of its predecessors due in large to
the new Wii control scheme. Unlike The Legend of Zelda: Twilight
Princess, a game whose control scheme worked very well, but also felt
like it originated from a GCN design, Prime 3 feels like it was
designed from the beginning for the Wii remote and nunchuk. Some
gamers complained that in the first two Prime games you could not move
while free aiming. If you remember, you had to hold the right shoulder
button on the GCN controller to look around. Not so in Corruption.
Now, you move with the nunchuk's analog stick and can freely aim in
any direction simply by pointing the Wii remote. There are three
sensitivity settings designed for beginners, intermediate and advanced
players, with the major difference being the invisible bounding box
that defines when Samus turns becomes smaller (and hence she turns
quicker) the more advanced you go.

If you ever follow any advice we give you, let it be this: don't even
bother to try out any of the control modes beyond 'advanced.' It
yields the fastest and most responsive first-person controls in any
Wii game to date -- possibly in any home console game ever -- and it
alone makes the experience so thoroughly enjoyable that you won't want
to put the Wii remote and nunchuk down. Retro seems to have realized
this truth and designed some characters around it. For instance, early
on you will fight a series of flying antipersonnel drones called
Aeromine; these nuisance bots huddle together in shielded groups,
leaving only one unit exposed at a time. You will have to manually
target and shoot down each drone in succession in order to advance.

We're not Wii newbies by any stretch of the imagination. We've played
and completed games like Call of Duty and Medal of Honor for Wii, both
of which featured fairly speedy FPS controls adapted to Nintendo's
remote and nunchuk. Metroid has them beat (and we won't even mention
Red Steel). Targeting feels tighter and looking left/right and up/down
quicker, and as a result you can effortlessly zip through locations
while blasting away at enemies and objects. Critics have complained
that first-person games on Wii have yet to prove their control
superiority to those on other consoles, but we really do think that
Prime 3 will open some eyes. That noted, even with advanced controls,
Samus does not turn around as quickly as we'd have liked. It still
takes the bounty hunter about two and a half seconds to perform a full
180-degree turn -- certainly fast enough for this adventure-heavy
experience, but it's still not going to show mouse and keyboard users
how it's done. Diehard Prime fans may be happy to know that Samus is
able to retain the auto lock-on feature of old games, but those who
want a little more manual control can additionally enable a free-look
while auto-locked, effectively letting the bounty hunter remain locked
onto enemies, but still manually target their specific body parts. The
IGN Nintendo team initially had a split of opinion about which method
was better. At first, only one of the editors was for the auto lock-on
with manual aim method, but eventually everybody came around because
of the added precision gained.

Retro has also utilized the Wii remote and nunchuk for context-
sensitive actions that create very immersive play scenarios. Samus
oftentimes interacts with environmental pulleys and levers, all
pushed, pulled and twisted with the Wii remote. You'll actually make
the appropriate gestures with the peripheral to perform these
functions. For instance, you might have to pull backward on the Wii
remote to pull a lever down, then twist left with the controller to
twist the on-screen device, and finally push forward to lock it back
in place. In our experience, these maneuvers work very well and do not
feel at all gimmicky. You will also use the hunter's Grapple Lasso to
latch onto objects and enemies To do so, you simply lock-on with the Z
button and then make a quick throwing gesture with the nunchuk; once
latched, you snap backward with the attachment to rip off wall panels,
or even pull the tails off some flying enemies, quickly disposing of
them. Again, these maneuvers work quite brilliantly. The only gesture
that has given us some trouble -- albeit only occasionally -- is the
one associated with morphball jumping. You can jump in morphball form
by laying bombs the traditional way, but you can also hop upward while
in ball form by flicking up with the Wii remote. It usually works and
feels very responsive (indeed, you can roll and jump over objects very
easily most of the time), but every so often it doesn't recognize the
gestures. If you make distinct, exaggerated motions, you probably
won't have any issues, but those with more subtle hand movements may
encounter the drawback.

During the first third of the game -- the portion we're able to write
about (and for the record, we completed Corruption in full earlier
today after 20 spectacular hours of play) -- Samus explores the
battleship Olympus, the futuristic planet Norion and the undeveloped
Bryyon, with its fire pits and Chozo temples. Eventually, you'll
journey to the Seed, where you'll do battle with a massive and
thrilling boss (Prime 3 boasts some of the best boss battles in any
videogame, period). All the locations are stunning in their own right
and all are full of challenges that revolve around both blasting apart
enemies and solving environmental puzzles. Samus will need to contract
into morphball form nearly as often as she'll need to use her weapons,
so if you're under the impression that the new Wii remote controls
equate to a dumbed down or shooter-intensified experience, don't be.
We're not going to reveal any further details about the content of the
main game, except to say that its tale will ally Samus with and
against some recognizable hunters and introduce her to the Aurora
Units, gigantic semi-organic super-computers that power entire
galactic networks. Might one of these brainy creatures amount to the
mother of all enemies? You're going to have to play to find out.

Metroid Prime 3 features a very welcomed rewards system that some have
compared to achievements on Xbox Live. As you progress through the
game, you earn Samus medals for accomplishing various goals, from 500
kills to beating certain enemies and scanning items. There are
differently colored medals for your various successes, and you can use
combos of these achievements to buy special unlockable extras --
concept art, music, storyboards, stickers and bobbleheads, and even a
screenshot tool that enables you to (by pressing up on the D-Pad) snap
in-game photos and send them to friends over WiiConnect24. The game
also uses WiiConnect24 to let you trade friend vouchers with players
you've already added to your Wii system address book. Friend vouchers
can be converted into friend credits, which are also utilized -- in
combination with the other medals -- to unlock the extras. Indeed, the
best extras can only be purchased if you trade friend vouchers with
your buddies. For the purposes of our hands-on update (and eventually
our review), we traded vouchers with our friends at GameSpy, and then
we converted those vouchers into friend credits to buy, for example,
the screenshot tool.

We're going to have the full review of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption
shortly before the game ships, but we don't think you'll be surprised
to learn that it's an amazing experience both mechanically and
visually. If this is truly the end of Retro's magnificent trilogy,
Samus Aran will have gone out on a very high note indeed.
