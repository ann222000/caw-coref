Yay. Every day a new record!

Today we've had 73 consecutive days of rain here in Bergen. It has not
rained continuously, we HAVE seen the sun. Occasionally. But every day in
the last 73 day period there have been at least a couple of mm of rain. So
far we have beaten the previous record (63 days) by 10 days, the good news
is that every day this week (according to the meteorologists) will bring a
new record.

BTW, it hasn't RAINED today, in stead water has been falling from the sky.

Needless to say everything is completely soaked. Fortunately, as a dragon,
I can clear my way by heavy breathing. Unfortunately my supply of
brimstone are close to zero. I guess I have to sacrifice a few virgins,
which are hard to find these days. I think I'll as an alternative settle
for a few citizens from Trondheim (our 3rd largest city, 2nd largest
wannabe). Almost everyone would love me if I did that.

&gt; The whole place is flat, even with lots of little creeks and various

It happens, mostly in the eastern (and flat) parts of Norway, in spring
when rivers run high. Floods are more unusual in the western part, but
local floods do occur when we get extreme amounts of rain, or when the
ground is completely soaked so there's no room for extra water.

&gt;What email client do you use?  Do you just use Agent for that as well?

Thunderbird. I had exported the address book a few weeks ago because
the XP install was getting a little wonky, so I began backing
everything up. Pibbur's addy should have been in there, but it's not
after I Imported it back.
Then just after about everything had been taken care of came the Error
Loading OS message and I did a clean install. Things work so much
faster now.Something was definitely wrong with my video, despite
Driver Cleaner - some games wouldn't display script unless I used two
year old video drivers.So now I have a nice fresh image done after a
clean install. My last image was too recent to avoid the problem.
Switched to uTorrent from bitTorrent, which would eventually bog the
whole system down and hog all the bandwidth, despite limiting.

Rain=drops of water from the sky. Sometimes it feels like it's one huge
drop falling down.

It's getting better.

Unfortunately we're far from the norwegian record. It turns out that
Bærum, near Olso once experienced 89 days of rain, which really is a
surprise, as that region of the country normally gets around 1/3-1/2 of
the rain we get. We can't have that. So now it'll have to continue raining
until January 24th. At least.

The coming week looks promising according to the weather girls.

of Rain and still going strong.

A possible crisis is due on wednesday, when the meteorologists proclaim
approximately 24 hours of drought. Let's hope it doesnt last exactly from
00:00:00 to 23:59:59. We can't give up now. Only 10 more days and we have
the national record. Please.

Hah, only 6-7 hours by a 747. Can you give me your address? //pibbur asks
innocently

Come to think of it: Cats probably won't do the trick, so I'll leave them
out of my search for sacrifice material.

Come to think of it 2: I have travelled by Jumbojet twice (To Toronto and
back again). I STILL refuse to believe that such an airplane really can
fly. When you see it taking off, it's almost as if it's crawling upwards.
I could probably walk faster than that.

&gt; here on Usenet.  Of course, gmail filters it away so I don't see it unless

I probably have to reformat Hank's HDDs once more, however.  It seems to me
there is some sort of major memory leak going on.  I could browse the
Internet for a while and then the whole system would slow down to a
standing still.  If I call up the Task Manager, and it would tell me my
browser (tried both IE and Firefox, doesn't matter which) is using up 50%
of CPU resource, and about 70 mb of rams (and it'll keep accumulate).
After a while I must restart the computer since the RAM wouldn't be
released even after the browser is closed.  Even shutdown takes forever,
since system resource is almost used up (I do have 1 gb of RAM, so it must
be the CPU resource that's used up).  I thought it may be some sort of
virus initially, but now I think it may be some sort of software conflict.
I am not that good at registry editing, so I might just reformat my HDDs
and get everything anew.

To test whether it was a browser problem.  Otherwise, I like Firefox, and
have been using it almost exclusively.  Only recently I've installed IE7.
It has good ideas (like thumbnail view for tabs), but I don't think it's
getting better in general.  I personally don't like the new bookmark drop
down menu thingy, and it took out the drag-n-drop bookmark adding for some
odd reason, and it also took out the down arrow (back history) button next
to back button.  I know one can use just one button for both back and
forward, but I use that button more than forward history, so why put the
button next to forward rather than in between forward and back?  Not
thought through design.  It makes me wonder whether Vista would be an
"upgrade".  MS lost their vision in recent years.

I am not sure I should post my system infos here for public to see.

It wouldn't let me manually kill the browser at all even through task

the RAM just doesn't get released back, and it continuously uses CPU
resource as if the browser is still on.  I think the Virtual Memory is
churning even the worst case happens, because I can hear the HDDs still
running when there is no visible program running on desktop.  The churning
would stop if I opened up task manager to see which program is running.
Usually it's just 50% browser and 50% idle process, with occassionally some
Windows background programs use 1-2% CPU resource.

There must be some event that triggers the bug.  Usually I can close down
the browser just fine, without lingering memory hog.  But once it does,
every programs I run would halt to a near stand still.  Even when I want to
install a program, it'll take forever to load the initial screen.  No
performance hit when I run game programs.

&gt;&gt;Yes, quite numerous, in fact.  I don't know why newer programs think it's
&gt;&gt;better to have them running in the background and check updates without
&gt;&gt;user's awareness.  They are installed by default, and usually it's on or
&gt;&gt;off, no in between (e.g., notify me but don't install update).

&gt; This is where a HijackThis log would be useful.

I'll check what this HijackThis thingy is about.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;After a while I must restart the computer since the RAM wouldn't be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;released even after the browser is closed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Did you manually kill the process (IE or Firefox) or just close the
&gt;&gt;&gt; window?

&gt;&gt;It wouldn't let me manually kill the browser at all even through task
&gt;&gt;manager, when the bug happens.

&gt; So it's probably either Java, a plugin, or a BHO.  Since it happens to
&gt; both FF and IE, it is something common to both of them.

BHO?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If that happens if you have opened a pdf via browser, I might look for

&gt;&gt;&gt;This may just be the case, though I already killed that program.  The
&gt;&gt;&gt;newest Adobe Reader 8 was very buggy.

&gt;&gt; Why not just use the 7.09 update instead of 8.0buggy?

&gt;That may be what I am about to do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Java console isn't my
&gt;&gt;&gt;favorite program.  I wish no web page would ever use it.  Yes, jusched is

&gt;&gt; That's just the updater, isn't it?  I always remove that startup key in
&gt;&gt; the registry on my Azureus machine so it doesn't load.

&gt;I am a registry idiot, so you'd have to spell it out how to do that
&gt;manually.

You dont have to. goto the java dialog in your system settings and the
update checking is on one of the tabs.

Actually more than once.  Not counting running Windows Update (which always

It's more of a challenge to hunt down and kill someone if they're

Unless you're playing Final Fantasy II (US) and you have gotten the
Frying Pan from Yang's wife, returned to town, smacked the amnesiacly
confused Yang over the head with said Frying Pan to awaken him from
his possesed dream, and then returned the Frying Pan to Yang's wife
(With Yang back in your group) whereupon she gives you the Spoon,
which is the ultimate weapon for your Ninja party member, Edge.
Only then is there a spoon. :-)
