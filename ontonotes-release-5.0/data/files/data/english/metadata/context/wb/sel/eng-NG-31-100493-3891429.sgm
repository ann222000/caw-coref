i have to assume tht you mean ........... well..........  ford.
there, i said it.  went camping with three friends with ford f250's,
with the great 6 liter powerstroke.

the first one has 27k on his.  has had it towed in to the shop three
times.  once i had to go a 300 miles to tow his trailer home for him
and once another friend went about 100 miles to tow his trailer home.
the last time he just paid the tow trucks.  twice it just would not
start.  the wiring harness was screwed up from the factory.  the last
time he was driving home with his trailer in tow when he just glided
to a stop.  his tranny has simply eaten itslef up.  the second one has
36k on his.  he is on his second tranny too.  other than that he loves
the truck.  the third hasn't had any problems yet, but of course i
told him it was only a matter of time!

i like the ford though.  drives nice.  i like my dodge better, but
mostly due to the engine.  my tranny has been pretty solid so far
though (auto) and i tow around 11k.

there were a few duramaxs up at the lake too.  they seem to be more
problamatic than the ford or dodge but people who love chevy seem to
be willing to put up with that.

the biggest thing that surprises me is still the number of people that
buy 3/4 ton trucks, no matter what brand.  with my srw 1 ton, i still
have about 1000 pounds more weight to put in the bed than they do.  it
is surprising when you go camping how important that 1k is.  by the
time you add a couple pontoon boats, kayaks, fishing gear, shooting
supplies, guns, and then the dumb dog, that 1k becomes very important.

You want dumb? Get a beagle. Did a favor for a friend and took one in at
about 1 year old. Friendly, great with kids but a box of rocks when it came
to training. Also was part backhoe, would dig a whole ya could loose a vw
in. I don't know how he managed the size of the hole given he was such a
runt. Also noticed our german shepard became a bit off once the beagle
showed up. Maybe it was catching.&lt;G&gt;

well, i don't want to trade "dumb" stories with you.........actually i
wish this was a contest i would lose, but my dog is really dumb.  he
is a purebread lab.  has papers, the whole deal.  he is a very pretty
dog and like i said a lot of fun.  i got him because my youngest son
was afraid of dogs.  he has been a best friend to my son and has been
a real asset for him.  i will always love him for that, but man, he
really is dumb.  i have told several people that and they just laugh
and tell me all labs appear to be dumb.  then they meet my lab and
before long they have to agree.  he is a hoot, he is very pretty, but
he is just plain stupid.  but like i said, we love him anyways.

&gt;&gt; Ca$e may not run loke a deer but they do run forever!

&gt;&gt; Motorcycles sports cars are supposed to be red.

&gt;old farts around here, I might remember them...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and then the dumb dog, that 1k becomes very important.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Do smart dogs weigh less or more than dumb ones?

&gt;&gt;&gt; no difference in weight.  mine just happens to be a dumb dog.  he's a
&gt;&gt;&gt; great dog, a lot of fun but he is just not real bright.

&gt;&gt;You want dumb? Get a beagle. Did a favor for a friend and took one in at
&gt;&gt;about 1 year old. Friendly, great with kids but a box of rocks when it came
&gt;&gt;to training. Also was part backhoe, would dig a whole ya could loose a vw
&gt;&gt;in. I don't know how he managed the size of the hole given he was such a
&gt;&gt;runt. Also noticed our german shepard became a bit off once the beagle
&gt;&gt;showed up. Maybe it was catching.&lt;G&gt;

&gt;&gt;Roy

&gt;well, i don't want to trade &quot;dumb&quot; stories with you.........actually i
&gt;wish this was a contest i would lose, but my dog is really dumb.  he
&gt;is a purebread lab.  has papers, the whole deal.  he is a very pretty
&gt;dog and like i said a lot of fun.  i got him because my youngest son
&gt;was afraid of dogs.  he has been a best friend to my son and has been
&gt;a real asset for him.  i will always love him for that, but man, he
&gt;really is dumb.  i have told several people that and they just laugh
&gt;and tell me all labs appear to be dumb.  then they meet my lab and
&gt;before long they have to agree.  he is a hoot, he is very pretty, but
&gt;he is just plain stupid.  but like i said, we love him anyways.

we have one that's not only dumb, but he has an over-bite which makes him look
REALLY dumb..

We figure that he has 2 main thoughts during the day:
breath in
breath out
