Bush doesn't read the polls or his PDB articles about bin Laden
attacking but he certainly reads about his fashion sense.

The article itself was entirely benign, noting that Bush has &quot;opted to
look more like 'Walker, Texas Ranger' than a sweaty, tough ranch
hand.&quot; This mild remark in a brief article was enough for the
spokesperson for the President of the United States to call a style
reporter for a mid-size newspaper to convey the disappointment of the
leader of the free world.

Bush's ranch fashion a sore point with him

By Marques G. Harper
AMERICAN-STATESMAN STAFF
Thursday, August 09, 2007

Presidents stick to a particular look in their off-time: Photos show
Ronald Reagan in Western wear in Santa Barbara, Calif., despite the
fact that Nancy Reagan had a serious sweet tooth for high fashion.

In the 1990s, we almost recoiled seeing images of Bill Clinton, pudgy
and pale-skinned, in drab polos on Martha's Vineyard, in stark
contrast to the dreamy pics from decades ago of John Kennedy's preppy,
all-American good looks as he sailed and summered.

And how could we forget the vacation wardrobe of President George W.
Bush, who is expected to make his annual summer trek to his ranch in
Crawford?

Bush has two distinct looks when he's in Texas: the ranch-hand man and
the crisp appearance of a ranch owner. In recent months, with his
sliding popularity, he's opted to look more like &quot;Walker, Texas
Ranger&quot; than a sweaty, tough ranch hand.

&quot;As he loses popularity, his image is more and more critical,&quot; said
Sara Canaday, an Austin-based communication and image consultant.
&quot;He's being advised wisely. He'd better step it up. He wants to have
this sort of bravado image when he's on that ranch.&quot;

If that's the case, it's unlikely we'll see Bush with his 2002
Crawford photo-op accessories: aviator sunglasses, grungy, sweaty T-
shirt, cowboy hat, light-colored jeans and Ford F-250.

It's tough times at the White House on the style front. According to
The Washington Post, signs have appeared at numerous White House
entrances in recent days, reminding staff members and others that
proper attire must be maintained. That means no jeans, sneakers,
shorts, miniskirts, T-shirts, tank tops or flip-flops.

The rules might spill over as White House staff such as Condoleezza
Rice and others drop by the ranch on business. The summer season at
Crawford likely will mean Bush in sports jackets, slacks and the big
belt buckle with the presidential seal he likes or the one from
Rewards that he received as a gift. And of course, there likely will
be those short-sleeved button-down shirts Bush favors.

(So if you're a guest at the ranch in the days ahead, it's probably
best to wear crisp dark jeans, a long-sleeve shirt and a Ralph Lauren-
style blazer, unless you want to get a new nickname from Bush.)

With only one presidential summer left in Crawford after this, perhaps
it's time for Mr. President to line up work for life after the White
House. Here's a thought: Follow the lead of Mikhail Gorbachev, the
former Soviet leader who is the new face of luxe brand Louis Vuitton.

In his Western duds, Bush easily could model for Ralph Lauren. But if
his popularity is still low through the end of his presidency, he
could always try Wrangler.

But
What really gets George W. Bush riled up? Calling him a fashion
victim.

Last week, Marques Harper of the Austin American-Statesman wrote a
short piece (above) about the president's sartorial style on his Texas
ranch, where Bush is spending a two-week vacation. The article was
reprinted Tuesday in a Waco, Tex., paper, and the leader of the free
world was not pleased.

Harper received a phone call that morning from White House deputy
press secretary Dana Perino, who, Harper told friends, said the
president read the article and was unhappy about the way he was
portrayed.

First, this comes just days after Karl Rove told Rush Limbaugh about
the president's healthy, above-the-fray attitude about criticism in
the media. Rove boasted, &quot;The president is very good about saying,
'Look, we came here for a reason. We have an obligation on the
country,' and press on by it. I'll be hyperventilating about the
latest attack on him by somebody, and he'll say, 'Don't worry. History
will get it right and we'll both be dead.' So it's a good, healthy
attitude about how to take it.&quot; I guess that doesn't apply to his
fashion sense.

Second, the article itself was entirely benign, noting that Bush has
&quot;opted to look more like 'Walker, Texas Ranger' than a sweaty, tough
ranch hand.&quot; This mild remark in a brief article was enough for the
spokesperson for the President of the United States to call a style
reporter for a mid-size newspaper to convey the disappointment of the
leader of the free world.

And third, I've heard rumors that George W. Bush is a charming fellow
who's easy to get along with. Policies aside, he's supposed to be a
&quot;great guy.&quot; I don't buy it. Incidents like this one make the
president sound temperamental and immature.

Indeed, if we take the White House pitch at face value, Bush is a
tough guy, hardened by war, and unconcerned about pettiness -- unless
the Austin American-Statesman says something vaguely derogatory about
his clothes?
