"God brings men into deep waters not to drown them, but to cleanse
them."  --Aughey

Don't worry. How? Pray.

When you feel like running away - run to God.

When the foundations are shaking and you wish you could hide, remember
that God is still in control. He can make a difference when it seems too
late for anyone else to help

Even as we pray for a change in our circumstances, we should also pray
that God will accomplish His plan through us right where we are.

If your situation looks hopeless, remember that God can do the impossible.

Every morning ask God to show us the way of patience, tolerance,
kindliness and love to all we shall meet that day.

Exercise daily my friend, take a walk with the Lord.  --Dave Tait

"No matter what your past may have been, everyone can have a clean
future. Talk to God about it. He has the answer."  --Anonymous

God wants us to walk with Him daily, not just visit Him on weekends.

God is only a prayer away.

God was where you were, God is where you are, God is where you are headed.

God may want us to be the answer to our own prayer.

God, save us from ourselves--protect us from the disaster of our own
thinking.

***********************************************************

When I speak, I tell my audiences, "As you get out of bed each morning
and stumble into the bathroom, jump-start each day with a positive
attitude. Look in the mirror and say, 'Good Morning. I love you. We're
going to have a great day!'"
Jill implemented this plan at home when their Sunday scramble to church
had become a war. It was a fight to get her family out of bed and
dressed. Yet, despite all her raving and ranting, they always arrived
late, surrounded by an angry cloud of silence.
One Sunday, she tried her new affirmation. She stood over her husband's
side of the bed and whispered in his ear, "Good Morning. I love you!
We're going to have a great day!"
Dan opened one eye and said, "What? Are you crazy?"
She just smiled and went across the hallway to their five-year-old son's
bedroom. She opened the door and repeated the greeting. Jeff rolled over
and said, "You're wrong, Mom. We're going to have a bad day!"
She smiled again and went across the hallway to check on Dan. She
couldn't believe it. He was already up, dressing!
She trotted back to Jeff's room. To her surprise he too was out of bed,
putting on his clothes!
That Sunday was the first in a month of Sundays they arrived at church
on time and still liking one another.
So Jill turned this greeting into a morning ritual. She had been
especially worried about her five-year-old's negative attitude. Each
morning, she woke Jeff with her new greeting, and each morning, he gave
her some sort of a cynical retort.
Her worries ended when one morning, she opened his bedroom door and
before she could speak, Jeff looked up at her with his big brown eyes
and said, "Good Morning. I love you, Mom. We're going to have a great
day!"  --Margie Seyfer

THE VIEW FROM THE WINDOW SEAT
Things look different from the window seat of an airliner.  From window
seat at 35,000 feet above the earth you see the other side of the
clouds. Even though it is a cloudy day down below, you can still see the
sunrise and the sunset. You see entire towns. You can see the natural
and man-made boundary markers. You can see what is beyond the bend in
the river. From the window seat you can see where the road leads and
where the road has come from. You can see beyond the normal horizon.
From the window seat you can see what is beyond the dense forest. You
can't tell if the wind is blowing. Mountains look smaller from the
window seat. You can see the reason for the curve in the road. In the
darkness from the window seat the lights are easily seen.
With a view from the window seat you can see some areas of the landscape
that are neatly arranged, and other areas that are ragged and random and
disorganized. You can see the areas that are alive with water and
vegetation, and the areas that are dry and barren. You can see farmland
and forests and cities and communities and neighborhoods. From the
window seat trains and automobiles look like toys, people if you can see
them at all look like ants, and houses and buildings look like pieces
from a monopoly game.
The window seat gives you a different perspective on the world and on
life. Life looks calmer, more peaceful, and things look more organized
from above than it does when we are right in the middle of it all. In
some ways it appears to make more sense from the lofty vantage point.
From up there, when we are securely buckled into our seat and unable to
move about decisions are fewer and not so complicated.
When we observe life from above we seem to escape the frantic pace of
life, and we can sit knowing that most of what goes on in the world at
that moment is totally out of our control and is not our responsibility.
When we sit in our window seat totally dependent upon the pilot and
co-pilot to get us to our destination we are reminded that God is the
One who will get us to our ultimate destination.
With the window seat view we are able to pause and observe life from a
different perspective. It can help us to better understand why Paul
wrote, "Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts
on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set
your minds on things above, not on earthly things" (Colossians 3:1-2, NIV).
What do you see when you look out your window? Problems? Stress?
Traffic? Chaos? Confusion? Get a different view. Try to look at things
from a different perspective. Try to look at things more the way God
looks at them. See if that makes a difference.
Then, take comfort in knowing that God sees it all and He knows
everything that is going on. And, He is not intimidated by any of it. He
is in control.  --Tom

NEAR THE VILLAGE of Gevas in eastern Turkey, while shepherds ate their
breakfast, one of their sheep jumped off a 45-foot cliff to its death...
Then, as the stunned shepherds looked on, the rest of the flock
followed.  In all, 1,500 sheep mindlessly stumbled off the cliff.  The
only good news was that the last 1,000 were cushioned in their fall by
the growing woolly pile of those who jumped first. According to The
Washington Post, 450 sheep died.
The Bible often refers to human beings as sheep (Ps. 100:3; Isa. 53:6;
Matt. 9:36).  Easily distracted and susceptible to group influence, we
would rather follow the crowd than the wisdom of the Shepherd.
Whom are we following?  One another?  Or the voice and direction of the
Good Shepherd?  Our challenge is to avoid the mistake of the sheep who
blindly followed one another over a cliff.  We must make it our daily
purpose to ask ourselves: Am I listening for the voice of the Good
Shepherd?  Am I following Him? (Mart De Haan)
Savior, like a shepherd lead us,
Much we need Thy tender care;
In Thy pleasant pastures feed us,
For our use Thy folds prepare.  (Thrupp)
KneEmail: "I am the Good Shepherd . . . . My sheep hear My voice, and I
know them, and they follow Me" (John 10:14,27).

Have A Problem With Your Mind & Tongue?
Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.
Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a
fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it
defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and
it is set on fire of hell. For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and
of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of
mankind.  But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of
deadly poison.  Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith
curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. Out of the
same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things
ought not so to be. Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet
water and bitter?  James 3:5-11
I stood in the upstairs hallway, looking down over the banister and
waiting for the younger children to come in for their baths. My oldest
daughter, taking a piano lesson, was in the living room directly below,
and the repetitive melody she was playing echoed through my mind.
I noticed, however, that one of my young sons was trudging slowly up the
stairs, his bowed, grubby hands covering his small, dirt-streaked face.
When he reached the top, I asked him what was wrong.
"Aw, nothing," he replied.
"Then why are you holding your face in your hands?" I persisted.
"Oh, I was just praying."
Quite curious now, I asked what he was praying about.
"I can't tell you," he insisted, "because if I do, you'll be mad."
After much persuasion I convinced him that he could confide in me and
that, whatever he told me, I would not get mad. So he explained that he
was praying about a problem he had with his mind.
"A problem with your mind?" I asked, now more curious than ever,
wondering what kind of problem a child of six could have with his mind.
"What kind of problem?"
"Well," he said, "You see, every time I pass by the living room, I see
my piano teacher, and my tongue sticks out."
Needless to say, it was hard to keep a straight face, but I took his
problem seriously and assured him that God could indeed help him with it.
Later, on my knees beside the bathtub as I bathed this little fellow, I
thought how I still struggle with the problem of controlling my mind and
my tongue. That afternoon as I knelt to scrub that sturdy little body,
the tub became my altar; the bathroom, my temple. I bowed my head,
covered my face, and acknowledged that I, like my son, had a problem
with my mind and tongue. I asked the Lord to forgive me and to give me
more and more the mind and heart and attitude of Christ."  --Gigi Graham

WE ARE A LOT WEALTHIER THEN WE THINK
A tax assessor came one day to a poor Christian to determine the amount
of taxes he would have to pay. The following conversation took place:
What property do you possess? asked the assessor.  I am a very wealthy
man, replied the Christian. List your possessions, please, the assessor
instructed.
The Christian said: First, I have everlasting life, John 3:16
Second, I have a mansion in heaven, John 14:2
Third, I have peace that passes all understanding, Philippians 4:7
Fourth, I have joy unspeakable, 1 Peter 1:8
Fifth, I have divine love which never fails, 1 Corinthians 13:8
Sixth, I have a faithful wife, Proverbs 31:10
Seventh, I have healthy, happy obedient children, Exodus 20:12
Eighth, I have true, loyal friends, Proverbs 18:24
Ninth, I have songs in the night, Psalms 42:8
Tenth, I have a crown of life, James 1:12
The tax assessor closed his book, and said, Truly you are a very rich
man, but your property is not subject to taxation.  I pray that all of
us will have this kind of tax free wealth.  --Author Unknown

Stand Firm On The Rock
In the message "Stand On Solid Ground" we compared Salvation through
faith in Jesus to the words of praise written by David: "He lifted me
out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; He set my feet on a rock
and gave me a firm place to stand" (Psalm 40:2).  We saw how God gives
us an eternal hope by lifting us up, washing us clean, and setting our
feet upon a new and solid path.  But what should we do now that our feet
have been set?
When we are in the slimy and muddy pit we're vulnerable to attack.  It's
difficult to move and we easily lose our balance.  We tend to live in
fear, not knowing who to trust or which way to turn.  But as Christ
lifts us up we become "a new creation" (2 Corinthians 5:17).  Life on
solid ground should not be the same as life in the pit!
As the Spirit of God transforms us, He also provides everything we need
to accomplish God's work and live a victorious life; "His divine power
has given us everything we need for life and godliness" (2 Peter 1:3).
Knowing that our Heavenly Father has created us anew and gifted us with
ALL we ever need, we must now be resolved to stand firm.
1 Corinthians 15:58  "Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let
nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord,
because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain."
We must make every effort to firmly stand; and yet, we must realize that
we cannot stand in our own strength.  The ground is solid only because
of Christ.  He IS the rock upon which we have been set - the Rock of our
Salvation.  Whenever we feel unworthy or unable to follow - whenever we
feel we can no longer stand - we have surely begun to look to our own
strength rather than God; "Now it is God who makes both us and you stand
firm in Christ" (2 Corinthians 1:21).  He alone gives us the strength.
We have trusted Him to lift us out of the pit.  Now that we are His
child, we must continue to trust Him to strengthen us and be the stable
Rock of our life.  "For if, when we were God's enemies, we were
reconciled to Him through the death of His Son, how much more, having
been reconciled, shall we be saved through His life!" (Romans 5:10).
The solid Rock is no place to tremble, no place to fear.  He will remain
solid for all eternity; and, as we stand on Him, He will accomplish
through us what we are unable to do in our own strength.  He is our new
life, our strength, our identity, and all our self-worth.  Let's honor
our Heavenly Father as we continue to stand.  Let's bring Him glory as
we resolve to stand firm on the Rock! Have a Great Day!  --Steve Troxel

SMALL STRAWS IN A SOFT WIND by Marsha Burns
Be quiet, child, and be aware of the spiritual environment. Do you sense
the moving of My Spirit? I tell you truly that there is much activity
and excitement in the heavenly realm in anticipation of what is about to
be done on earth. Prepare by establishing yourself in faith on the firm
foundation of My Word. Shut your eyes to whatever causes you to doubt My
power and presence. Turn a deaf ear to everything that questions My
intentions and purposes for your good, says the Lord.
Numbers 23:19 "God is not a man, that He should lie, nor a son of man,
that He should repent. Has He said, and will He not do? Or has He
spoken, and will He not make it good?

Refuse to allow your circumstances to circumvent your faith. Your faith
is your most powerful possession. Do not open the door for the enemy to
undermine your effectiveness through doubt and unbelief. Be steadfast
and immovable. Believe, and then speak. Speak out of the abundance of
your heart with undaunted faith. Speak forth the word of truth, says the
Lord.
Romans 1:17 For in it (the Gospel of Christ) the righteousness of God is
revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "The just shall live by
faith."

Be still, beloved. Your heart has become overwhelmed with all that is
ahead of you. But, you don't have to face these things all at this time,
nor do you have to face these things alone, for I am with you to bring
you through in courage and boldness. Do not be distressed or become
disheartened; my strength is sufficient to meet the troubles of this
day. Take one day at a time, and I will lead you one step at a time. Do
not be afraid, says the Lord.
Psalm 124:2-8 "If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men
rose up against us, then they would have swallowed us alive, when their
wrath was kindled against us; then the waters would have overwhelmed us,
the stream would have gone over our soul; then the swollen waters would
have gone over our soul." Blessed be the LORD, Who has not given us as
prey to their teeth. Our soul has escaped as a bird from the snare of
the fowlers; the snare is broken, and we have escaped. Our help is in
the name of the LORD, Who made heaven and earth.

Be liberated! I call you to come into the realm of freedom from all
restriction and bondage. Come forth! Break loose! Now is a time when you
can make considerable progress in attaining your desires and goals.
Refuse to allow the enemy of your soul to keep you from breaking
through. Press on and push through. Be strong, says the Lord.
Ephesians 6:10 Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the
power of His might.

Bridge Over Troubled Waters
There are days when I wonder
Will there ever be a time without worry
My heart is so very heavy now
So much trouble it must carry.
I pray each day for peace of mind
A lonesome bridge I must trod
My only salvation is
The talk I have with God.
He is my friend of all friends
He keeps me going each day
As I walk the bridge over troubled waters
The loving words He sends my way.
Rest your mind my dearest child
Is the words He seems to say
I shall dwell in His house forever
--Ginny Bryant  9/22/06

***********************************************************

Slow Me Down Lord
Slow me down, Lord
Ease the pounding of my heart
by the quieting of my mind.
Steady my hurried pace with a vision
of the eternal reach of time.
Give me, amid the confusion of the day,
the calmness of the everlasting hills.
Break the tensions of my nerves and muscles
with the soothing music of the
singing streams that live in my memory.
Help me to know the magical, restoring
power of sleep.
Teach me the art of taking minute vacations,
of slowing down to look at a flower,
to chat with a friend,
to pat a dog,
to read a few lines from a good book.
Slow me down, Lord, and inspire me to
send my roots deep into the soil of life's
enduring values that I many grow
toward the stars of my greater destiny.
Author Unknown

***********************************************************

Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe in thy
commandments.  Psalm 119:66

For I have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of
him who sent me. And this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall
lose none of all that he has given me, but raise them up at the last
day. For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and
believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the
last day."  John 6:38-40

Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the
bones.  Proverbs 16:24

Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what
is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may
benefit those who listen. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with
whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Get rid of all
bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form
of malice. Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each
other, just as in Christ God forgave you.  Ephesians 4:29-32

If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in him
and he in God.  1 John 4:15

All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be
thoroughly equipped for every good work.  2 Timothy 3:16-17

Be careful not to do your 'acts of righteousness' before men, to be seen
by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
Matthew 6:1

Am I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to
please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a
servant of Christ.  Galatians 1:10

***********************************************************

The Baffling Call of God
"Then [King] Agrippa said unto Paul, 'Almost you persuade me to be a
Christian.'"  Acts 26:28
"The call of God," said Oswald Chambers, "is like the call of the sea to
the sailor. Only he who has the nature of the sea within can hear the call."
In other words, the man or woman who loves the ocean and "hears the call
of the sea" can never rest until he or she launches out into the deep of
the oceans beyond. For those whom God is calling to follow him, to serve
him, to accept him, to love him ... we will
never rest until we answer his call and come to God through Jesus and do
his bidding.
Indeed, "Our hearts are restless until they find their rest in God."
The danger is that if we keep resisting God's call, we will distance
ourselves from him to put us out of hearing range. God never stops
calling us, but we may never come back to hear the call to answer it.
King Agrippa had the opportunity to answer God's call and become a
Christian, but his answer was "almost"--and almost is never good enough.
To jump a deep chasm and almost make it is to spell disaster. As far as
we know, King Agrippa never did accept Jesus as his Savior nor receive
God's full and free pardon and the gift of eternal life.
How tragic to have this kind of opportunity and not accept it. Accepting
Jesus is God's passport into heaven. Whatever you do, don't leave earth
without it.
Answer God's call today. Be sure to do that today as none of us have any
guarantee of tomorrow. Don't be an "almost persuaded."
Suggested prayer: "Dear God, I want to answer your call and find you.
Please help me to do that today. Thank you for hearing and answering my
prayer. Gratefully in Jesus' name. Amen."  --Dick Innes

***********************************************************

Jesus I am your child.
Instill in me, I pray,
Your fruit so sweet and beautiful,
Show in my life each day.
Lord show in me a love for all,
And a joy that will not cease.
Bring patience and Your goodness,
Kindness and your peace.
Jesus let me be faithful
And gentle to all I meet.
Fill me with your self-control
From my head down to my feet.
Lord I want to walk with you
And with each step along the way
Let your fruit shine brightly through
Your servant, Lord I pray.
--P.S. Gunter

Read Through The Bible
Genesis 25
The Death of Abraham
Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah. She bore him Zimran,
Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah. Jokshan was the father of
Sheba and Dedan; the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurites, the
Letushites and the Leummites. The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher,
Hanoch, Abida and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah. Abraham
left everything he owned to Isaac. But while he was still living, he
gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son
Isaac to the land of the east. Altogether, Abraham lived a hundred and
seventy-five years. Then Abraham breathed his last and died at a good
old age, an old man and full of years; and he was gathered to his
people. His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah
near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, the field
Abraham had bought from the Hittites. There Abraham was buried with his
wife Sarah. After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who then
lived near Beer Lahai Roi.
Ishmael's Sons
This is the account of Abraham's son Ishmael, whom Sarah's maidservant,
Hagar the Egyptian, bore to Abraham. These are the names of the sons of
Ishmael, listed in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of
Ishmael, Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, Mishma, Dumah, Massa, Hadad, Tema,
Jetur, Naphish and Kedemah. These were the sons of Ishmael, and these
are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements
and camps. Altogether, Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years.
He breathed his last and died, and he was gathered to his people. His
descendants settled in the area from Havilah to Shur, near the border of
Egypt, as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all
their brothers.
Jacob and Esau
This is the account of Abraham's son Isaac. Abraham became the father of
Isaac, and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah daughter of
Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram and sister of Laban the Aramean.
Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren.
The LORD answered his prayer, and his wife Rebekah became pregnant. The
babies jostled each other within her, and she said, "Why is this
happening to me?" So she went to inquire of the LORD. The LORD said to
her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will
be separated; one people will be stronger than the other,
and the older will serve the younger." When the time came for her to
give birth, there were twin boys in her womb. The first to come out was
red, and his whole body was like a hairy garment; so they named him
Esau. After this, his brother came out, with his hand grasping Esau's
heel; so he was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave
birth to them. The boys grew up, and Esau became a skillful hunter, a
man of the open country, while Jacob was a quiet man, staying among the
tents. Isaac, who had a taste for wild game, loved Esau, but Rebekah
loved Jacob. Once when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from
the open country, famished. He said to Jacob, "Quick, let me have some
of that red stew! I'm famished!" (That is why he was also called Edom.)
Jacob replied, "First sell me your birthright." "Look, I am about to
die," Esau said. "What good is the birthright to me?" But Jacob said,
"Swear to me first." So he swore an oath to him, selling his birthright
to Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and some lentil stew. He ate
and drank, and then got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright.

PRAYER FOR FRIENDS
By Bernie Smith
Lord, bless our friends today we pray,
Wherever they may be;
And help them as they go their way,
To keep their trust in Thee.
Lord, hear each prayer they raise to Thee,
And dry each falling tear;
And hover o'er them constantly,
For treasured friends are dear.
Surround them with Thy mercy,
Lord, Protect them by Thy power;
And let them feel Thy presence,
Lord, In every lonely hour.
Stand by them when the road is steep,
And no one seems to care;
Thy arm of love around them keep,
And whisper You are there.
And give them strength to bear the cross,
As through this vale they go;
And stand by them in every loss,
That they meet here below.
And when at last the hour shall be,
That life's short journey ends;
O, let them lean the more on Thee,
And comfort these, our friends.
And open heaven's gate, dear Lord,
And let them enter there;
For heaven will be heaven,
Lord, Because our friends are there.
