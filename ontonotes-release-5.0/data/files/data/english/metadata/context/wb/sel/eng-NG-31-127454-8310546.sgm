1.) RAB - It was pretty obvious that it was Regelus Black. The question is;
why did he leave the death eaters, and how did he find out about voldemorts
Horcruxs? The only explanation I can think of is the Blacks had the locket
as a family heirloom, and Voldemort needed a family member that he knew he
was going to dispose of (since he knew that bellatrix and narcissa were
more loyal) to give it to him.

2.) Harry a horcrux? Yes...kinda. Though, the explanation isnt full when
harry half died, i am assuming thats when the horcrux left him.

3.) 2 died, 1 got a reprive. Who do you think were the 2 people that died
that Jo didnt plan on killing off, and who was the one that got a reprive?
My answer for the first part is Hedwig and Tonks. I think that Jo knew she
was going to kill of lupin, moody, and even hedwig; people who we were
emotionally close to, but had no relation to the major plotline anymore.
Who got a reprive? Id have to say one of three; Neville (who woulda made
his gran proud by dying facing the death eaters), Hagrid, or the most
obvious choice, Draco Malfoy wasnt killed by Voldy because he lost the
wand to Harry

4.) Magic later in life? This one isnt as obvious; dudley dursley.
Obviously he didnt whip out his wand and do some tricks, but he learned
that harry is a good person, and not a punching bag

5.) Snape was a good guy. Yay. Its amazing though, because he was cruel to
harry, especially in his early years.

6. Voldemorts death wasnt as dramatic as Id had hoped. Plus, the cover of
the book is the last second before voldemort dies; pretty cool now that I
think about it.

7.) This book kinda reminded me of The Da Vinci code in the aspect that it
was essentially the main 3 going from place to place, with the DE hot on
their tail.

8.) Dumbledores Family became very important in this book, much more so
than &quot;harry's eyes&quot; (yes we needed those so we could get the memory from
snape). It surprises me that Jo didnt the sister beforehand.

Overall, a good read, There are still a few unanswered questions; what
happened to all the death eaters, some other of the main characters
(neville, dean, luna), and why didnt harry name one of his sons Sirius?
Also, where did the names Hugo and Rose come from?

I don't know how he found out about the horcruxes. If it's made clear in the
books, I missed it. But it seemed pretty clear why Regulus left the Death
Eaters: he turned against Voldemort when he saw that Voldemort was cruel to
Kreacher, making him drink the poisin and leaving him for dead. That's a
plot point of this book that I don't much care for--Regulus was kind to his
house elf, so he could have been a Death Eater and deserved the loyalty he
got from the elf. Sirius was an asshole to the house elf, so he deserved to
die, or at the least, he caused his own death by treating the house elf
horribly so the house elf justifiably betrayed him. I liked SPEW but I
dislike the message in this resolution because I feel it throws away the
character of Sirius Black. Think about it--Sirius in Books 3-4, then what
happens in Book 5, and now it's written like Sirius was just an ass, nothing
more.Sirius was a more complex character than that.

Ugh, I just hate the way JKR butchered her characters in this last book,

I evidently read too fast, as I am still not crystal clear on what happened.
Someone who's not familiar much with Harry Potter asked me what happened in

that I dislike. It didn't captivate me and I thought it was too bloated. It
was better than HBP which dragged through scenes with no action, but this
book had so much action and wasn't as clearly and concisely written as it

The character of Severus Snape was neutered and turned into cheese. I always

really, really did what he did all these years just ebcause he had feelings
for Lily so much so that before he dies he wants to see Harry's eyes one

I don't know, this was cheese. NO WAY INHELL do I think this is the ending

I agree about the first two, but I don't think the character of Dumbledore
was butchered. He was simply portrayed as man, who once was a young youth
with flaws, rather than what the present generation precieves him as: an
almost saintly figure.

Rowling is saying that even apparently great and perfect people have or have
had flaws, and made mistakes.

Yes all the death scenes except that of Dobby went by in a blur. No

No. Snape was never a _good_ guy. He *was* a bad guy, but a bad guy with
obsessive love for Lily. Her death, caused by his reporting the prophecy,
was the *only* thing that made him come over to Dumbledore's side. That too
only to avenge Lily, never to help *good* or Harry or whatever.

In short Snape was turned into a unidimensional character motivated solely
by obsessive love, who _served_ the good, but was never good himself.

Rowling seemed to set him up as a very complex character but in this book,
all his complexity is just blown away like so much smoke leaving a pathetic
bitter, obsessed man in the wake.

The idea the one who did magic late in life was Merope can be
excluded. She had a wand! HER wand. As a wand breaks when the owner
dies ( with the exception of this special elder wand) she cannot have
inherited it. Where did she learn to make the love potion? She was a
witch, not a squib, even if her father says so! Remember Molly yelling
at the twins doing magic on every end when they transport a pot of
soup from the stove to the table by magic being a bit to fast? Merope
is yelled at for picking up the pot by hand and not doing magic. She
was just acting normal, not seeing a necessity to use the wand every
second.
She was suppressed, misunderstood and was lacking love and warmth.
That is why her spells failed. Noone can work properly if being
suppressed, full of fear and being eagerly watched. ( exam -
situation, you know?) She, in contradiction to her son, did not have
the strength and selfconfidence to fight for herself. If she had been
stronger Tom would not have become Voldemort.

Jep, she left me with the distictive impression that after Cedric's death, she
began to kill people far too easily and, in book 7, randomly. (Especially,
there was no need whatsoever to kill Lupin and Tonks.) While she has a
reasonable motivation for some deaths, there would have been other solutions.

Probably the same reason why Draco Malfoy later wanted out. He was not quite
expecting how evil Voldy really is. The way Kreacher tells his story,
Voldemort trying to off Kreacher was the main reason he had enough. Note
that Regulus must have been (unlikely as it sounds) fond of Kreacher, he
actually drunk the potion himself instead of letting Kreacher do it. If he
had just seem him as a tool...

As to knowing about the Horcrux : He probably just put Voldemort being a
dark Wizard and him putting away a ominous artifact in a strongly guarded
place. Perhaps he only realizes what it really was, when he held it. There
are probably spells to identify Horcruxes. He must have known it was
important, though. Voldemort's behaviour clearly proofed that.

I thought Voldemort asked to borrow Kreacher to test his horcrux'

returned to tell him the story, and take him back.

I do see a thematic reason for killing Lupin: the last of the Marauders is

We learn that Regulus 1) played Seeker and 2) joined the DEs when he was
underage. I think JKR is clearly trying to tell us that we ought to see
parallels between his life and Draco's, and is foreshadowing that the
latter will make a seemingly small but vitally important contribution to
LV's downfall.

I don't think it's clear that he ever found out about the Horcruxes.
Certainly, even if he knew about that one Horcrux, he would
never have suspected the existence of any others (it's hard
enough just to create even one of them).

But I think he merely realized that the Horcrux was something
incredibly valuble to Voldemort, based on the amount of
protection around it.  He decided to get his final revenge on
Voldemort by destroying it and leaving a final taunting note
to him about it.

Of course, he had no idea that Kreacher would be unable to
destroy it.  That would suggest that he didn't know it was a
Horcrux.  Or at the very least, he may have incorrectly guessed
that it must be pretty easy to destroy if it needs such heavy
magical protection.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; The only explanation I can think of is the Blacks had the locket
&gt; &gt; as a family heirloom, and Voldemort needed a family member that he knew he
&gt; &gt; was going to dispose of (since he knew that bellatrix and narcissa were
&gt; &gt; more loyal) to give it to him.
&gt; Probably the same reason why Draco Malfoy later wanted out. He was not quite
&gt; expecting how evil Voldy really is. The way Kreacher tells his story,
&gt; Voldemort trying to off Kreacher was the main reason he had enough. Note
&gt; that Regulus must have been (unlikely as it sounds) fond of Kreacher, he
&gt; actually drunk the potion himself instead of letting Kreacher do it. If he
&gt; had just seem him as a tool...
">

The way Kreacher tells the story is bound to be biased, especially
since Regulus didn't let Kreacher in on his plans or even his change
of heart.  I find it more plausible that Regulus had long had a change
of heart, and he seized upon this once-in-a-lifetime stroke of luck
to exact a revenge on Voldemort.  It was sheer luck that he rescued
Kreacher and for Kreacher to tell him about Voldemort's treasure.
Regulus couldn't tell exactly what this treasure was for, but it was
obviously precious to Voldemort beyond all measure and he
expected that it was perfectly hidden with all potential witnesses
eliminated.

But would this really have been the final straw to break the camel's
back?  Enough to cause Regulus to sacrifice his own life?  Somehow
I doubt it.  It must have been more than that.  Also, I doubt that he
killed himself to save Kreacher.  He could have let Kreacher drink
the poison and then summoned him to save him again.  No, I think he
feared that Voldemort would read his mind or somehow otherwise
discover his treachery.  Perhaps he already feared Voldemort had
discovered his treachery.  Maybe Regulus had already betrayed
Voldemort in some other way(s).

But he may have correctly guessed that Voldemort would ignore
as an insignificant creature as a house elf, even if he himself
would be subject to scrutiny.

Yes, well, of course one can find a reason for every death, but I you know, I
have read lots of books, and there are not quite that many authors there that
feel they have to kill everybody off like that. One can both let the hero be
on his own and bring about a generation change without resorting to quite as
many deaths.

And of course if she wanted to show Harry on his own and all alone, well, in
that case there was considerably too much Hermione and Ron still there. So
frankly, that cannot be the reason.

I doubt he would have told them just WHAT the methods he used were. Sharing
your greatest weakness with powerful, ambitious people who have no morals
whatsoever doesn't seem like the most brilliant of notions. Likely there
were other methods he used to ensure his own survival...I mean it doesn't
seem likely that splitting your soul would change your face into a snake.
Who the hell knows what else Voldemort went through.

It's pretty certain that he told nobody about the horcruxes, however.
Personally, I'm surprised he let Slughorn live at all.

You are reading something into that statement that just
isn't there.  In DH, it is not merely implied, but is quite clear
that the DEs do NOT know about any horcruxes at all.  LV
doesn't trust anyone, not even his closest.  Bellatrix was
intrusted with a golden cup. She called it a small golden cup.
That's all.  Even she didn't know it was a horcrux.

No, I would not, but JKR killed off _every adult_ who was teacher-like and
close to Harry; and killing off about everybody might have worked in Hamlet,
but it sure does not work here. The Weaslys are allowed to live because they
function is limited to feeding Harry, washing his socks and knitting him a
jumper every year, but that are about the only adults that survive with whom
Harry had anything resembling a close relation.

She pushed that &quot;he has to do it alone&quot; a wee bit far. And a generation change
is not sufficient to explain that either; especially since it is usually not a
particularly good idea to completely ignore everything older people can teach
you -- and well, I guess killing them off is about as much ignoring as you
can.

Well,I regret that she's spent the last several books tearing James down,
with hardly any sign of his good side...there had to be a reason why Lily
was happy with him.

:&gt; Obviously he didnt whip out his wand and do some tricks, but he learned
:&gt; that harry is a good person, and not a punching bag
:
: Nah, I think this was Merope in Half Blood Prince.

Merope clearly COULD do magic...remember that she broke that pan
because she was levitating it clumsily.She died when she STOPPED
doing magic.

: I don't know, this was cheese. NO WAY INHELL do I think this is the ending
: JKR originally planned for Snape. No way. She obviously started to love fan

:
: She started to love Harry fanfiction wayyyyy too much. This book reeks of

I wanted Snape to be out for himself above all,
and having trusted him to the point of exerting every
effort to ensure death at his hands to be the main
discrediting of Dumbledore.

Now we know Harry was, in fact, an accidental Horcrux, it makes much
more sense:

1) DD´s original plan was to get Harry killed by LV at the very end,
so why risk anyone else´s lives in the Horcrux hunt? The boy was going
to get snuffed anyway, no problem losing, say, an arm while hunting
them down...

.  1A) even if he wasn´t, LV sets store by the prophecy and will try
to finish Harry off anyway, so the same point applies: he is marked to
die;

2) His connection to LV makes him much more capable of finding them
(he only learned of the final one at Hogwarts this way);

3) Since he is otherwise a median wizard, he needs both technical and
psychological support to do it; the best way is certainly include in
the chase his two best friends, one of which is an unusually talented
witch and the other has a big family including Harry´s girlfriend,
surrogate mother and useful connections at the MoM, Gringotts and so
on.

Merope easily fits all the criteria.  She seems to be a squib.  Her

Just because we see Merope doing magic doesn't mean she's been doing
magic all her life.  We were never told we would see the late bloomer

Its all a moot point. JKR already killed the whole idea back in GOF.
I know you've got a Merope fixation, but the whole issue has died,
terminated, crossed over, moved on, ceased to be, made the final exit,
bit the big one, done the big chill, copped the final nod, gasped its last,
kicked the bucket, bought the farm. Let it rest in peace instead of
dragging it back like you're Merope's personal Resurrection Stone.
