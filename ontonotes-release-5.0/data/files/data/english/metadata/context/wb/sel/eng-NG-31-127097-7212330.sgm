Whilst I have no hard evidence, other than my own experiences, I suspect
that
when we sleep badly, it is due to our body being dehydrated.

Experts tell us we should drink at least 8 glasses of water a day, but
that's
only during waking hours. Our bodies still need to be hydrated during the 8
hours or so when we sleep.

One of the symptoms of dehydration are sunken eyes. When I wake up in the
morning
after a bad night's sleep, I look in the mirror and my eyes are sunken,
sometimes slightly red(matchstick eyes).

Other symptoms of dehydration is when you wake up to go to the bathroom
and hardly
any urine comes out.

I even think waking up with a dry mouth is an indication of dehydration.

Alot of people seem to think that consumption of liquids should cease in
the
evening, so that there is less of a chance of needing to go to the
bathroom in the
middle of the night. I would say this is WRONG. Going to the bathroom is a
bodily
function, and should not be dictated by the mind through denial of liquids.

I find that if I hydrate before going to sleep, the sleep quality is much
better than
if I hadn't. I wake up feeling refreshed, with no brain fog or chest
anxieties. Hence,
I tend to drink about 3 glasses of water from about 7.30pm to 10pm, when I
go to sleep.
Sometimes I drink 3 glasses of water in the last waking hour.

Sometimes I don't wake up at all during the night to go to the bathroom,
but that is
not usually the case. When I do wake up, I go to the bathroom, and either
go back to
sleep, or have a 1/2 glass of water(especially if my mouth/throat is dry).

Finally, I suspect that dehydration causes the mind to become active.
Hence, waking up
and not being able to go back to sleep because of an active mind is a sign
of dehydration.

I'll use an example from a day ago. I woke up in the middle of the night,
after about
2.5 hours of sleep to go to the bathroom. Hardly anything came out, and I
couldn't get
back to sleep. So I got out of bed and watched TV for 2 hours. The Sixth
Sense was on,
great movie. Anyway, during those 2 hours, I drank 3 glasses of water.
Before I went
back to bed, I went to the bathroom again, and hardly anything came out.

3 glasses of water within 2 hours, and no pee came out? That clearly means
my body was
dehydrated! Anyway, I went back to sleep, and woke up refreshed.

That's enough of my thoughts on the matter of hydration duringn sleep.
Hope you
enjoyed reading it! :)
