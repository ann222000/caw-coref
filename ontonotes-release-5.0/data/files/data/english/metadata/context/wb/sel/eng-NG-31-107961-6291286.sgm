T-SHIRTS TO CHANGE THE WORLD...

Hey, if you paddle a canoe/kayak to save the environment, it's time to
be proud of it. Show the selfish owners of big motorboats that you are
bigger than them.

canoe...

kayak...

or the whole revolution...

And just who's the dinosaur?

That's the new T-shirt of a series that could change the
world. Well, first you gotta know who the dinosaur is, but I can tell
you he's BIG, STUPID and REFUSES TO EVOLVE.

He may look like this...

Or he may look like this...

In any case, you may have decided you had it with the stupid beast,
and you've decided to give a chance to the smart and small, just like
a bike or canoe. "Do not feed the dinosaur" seems like a good start.

What if you drive to the water in a gas-guzzling SUV with the canoe on top?
Is there a T-shirt for that?

Man, that's a tough one, but it happens. I see them out there all the
time.

So I guess, they are a LAND DINOSAUR, but a LITTLE FISH ON WATER. :(

I'm OK with the sentiment, but I'm having trouble with the metaphor.
SUVs and motorboats run on dead dinosaurs. They don't feed them. Good

Oh, that's ANOTHER metaphor. Why would God wipe out the dinosaurs, to
provide oil for his worshippers in SUVs and motorboats? Oh sure, they
are fulfilling the prophecies that big is good, if you ever find one.
They no doubt would have sided with Rome at its prime (not the Vatican
but the Roman Empire).

But what if God decides to wipe out the new dinosaurs and make room
for the furry little mammals? Perhaps that would be the Second Coming
of Jesus on a donkey --or bicycle or canoe. Then the cyclists and
canoeists will lead the next revolution... ;)

For those who only listen to the preacherman, here's what the Bible
says...

John's gospel records that Jesus rejected the call to be their warrior
king. Mounting a young donkey, he rode into Jerusalem, fulfilling the
prophecy of Zephaniah: "Fear not, Daughter of Sion, your king is
coming, mounted on a donkey's colt."

Not a fearsome warrior, he was the humble king the prophet described.
In Jerusalem he would open his arms to the poor outcasts of the
world..

"At the time his disciples did not understand this..." John
concludes.

If you stand your ground before a charging motorboat, then you really
fear no giants. But I do. They give me the creeps, just like when I'm
on the water and I see a fin circling me.

Then you realize you must meet your fate and dress like a knight...

corporations behind SUVs and motorboats)

DON QUIXOTE VS THE WINDMILLS!

When the environmental crisis worsens, how can one remain passive?
Neither the Rio Earth Summit nor the Kyoto Protocol, regrettably, will
do much, particularly when the worst predator refuses to participate.
A big change is needed--or else.

I have been long enough on this planet to witness, not the use, but
the reckless abuse of resources. While the system measures "success"
by the size of the vehicle and the motorboat there can be no solution.
And while the system denies space for bicycles and other efficient
alternatives there can be no solution.

I have, however, a few earthy proposals:

1. INCREASE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE, such as in Europe and Japan. The
revenue so raised could be used to IMPROVE ALTERNATIVE
TRANSPORTATION*, from fast trains to the creation of BICICLE LANES
along all major streets.

2. Open letters from parents to children, perhaps encouraged via the
schools, in which the parents vow to specific lifestyle changes. Such
letters are to be conspicuously displayed in the home. For example, it
could say, "Ride bicycle to work," etc.

Let's give life to our children, not a subsistence of rats. Don
Quixote would have said: "Sancho, let's go for the giants!"

*"A massive public works project that did not expand the deficit would
help; something like a massive clean energy program or nationwide high-
speed rail network financed by new taxes on pollution and fossil
fuels. A more progressive tax system would help as well. Both seem
inconceivable since the Bush administration wants to spend public
works dollars on Mars not earth, and Congress that has just enacted
tax breaks that exacerbate the wealth gap."

Don Quixotes of the Environment
"I feel like Don Quixote, but quite the contrary," says Marina Silva.
"Don Quixote fought windmills, thinking he was fighting giants. I
fight giants thinking I am fighting windmills."

Been there, done that...

The combat with the windmill is rich in symbolism. It does not matter
whether the ponderous machine stands for stultified human institutions
that need attacking, or ancient traditions that must be newly
questioned, or totalitarian government requiring renewal by
revolution, or bureaucracy being attacked by individual demands. What
matters is that only a positive act of will is capable of attacking
anything, and the success or failure is unimportant. "Thy triumph, my
Don Quixote," writes Unamuno, "Was ever a triumph of daring, not of
succeeding." Not only is Don Quixote victorious because he dares; he
is always spiritually triumphant as well. He has a stoical ability to
disregard his physical failures and is willing to follow his
adventures after a slight recovery.

&gt; And while the system denies space for bicycles and other efficient
&gt; alternatives there can be no solution.

&gt; I have, however, a few earthy proposals:

&gt; 1. INCREASE THE PRICE OF GASOLINE, such as in Europe and Japan. The
&gt; revenue so raised could be used to IMPROVE ALTERNATIVE
&gt; TRANSPORTATION*, from fast trains to the creation of BICICLE LANES
&gt; along all major streets.

&gt; 2. Open letters from parents to children, perhaps encouraged via the
&gt; schools, in which the parents vow to specific lifestyle changes. Such
&gt; letters are to be conspicuously displayed in the home. For example, it
&gt; could say, &quot;Ride bicycle to work,&quot; etc.

&gt; Let's give life to our children, not a subsistence of rats. Don
&gt; Quixote would have said: &quot;Sancho, let's go for the giants!&quot;

&gt; *&quot;A massive public works project that did not expand the deficit would
&gt; help; something like a massive clean energy program or nationwide high-
&gt; speed rail network financed by new taxes on pollution and fossil
&gt; fuels. A more progressive tax system would help as well. Both seem
&gt; inconceivable since the Bush administration wants to spend public
&gt; works dollars on Mars not earth, and Congress that has just enacted
&gt; tax breaks that exacerbate the wealth gap.&quot; http://www.eugenelinden.com/news280.html

&gt; ***

&gt; Don Quixotes of the Environment
&gt; &quot;I feel like Don Quixote, but quite the contrary,&quot; says Marina Silva.
&gt; &quot;Don Quixote fought windmills, thinking he was fighting giants. I
&gt; fight giants thinking I am fighting windmills.&quot; http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et0298/et0298s6.html

Good responses but I take issue with a few things.

I'm not convinced the government can do better at developing
alternative fuels than the competive marketplace. In fact, investors
may be holding out in hopes of getting a piece of pie from the
govenrment instead fo forging investments themselves. Also, I view the
biggest impediments to mass transit like trains and subways as the
airline and auto lobby, not the gas lobby. Oh, and our devotion to
property rights isn't helping either.

I've spent a lot of time in Europe. I don't think the price of gas is
preventing them from pollutiong. I think they have population density
advantages. When a European can afford a big car, they get one, just
like Americans. That's just my experience, not a scientific study.

Regarding the Kyoto protocol and the "worst predator": heck no I
wouldn't join up for these either since somehow China and India are
left out. On the whole those countries may be second or third world
but regions are definitely some of the world's worse polluters, east
China for example.

Regarding public works -- FDR proved deficit spending can spur the
econmy. Various presidents have used that technique again and again.
Putting someone or something on Mars wilpsur technology just like
putting a man on the moon did. BTW, IIIRC, Bush is spending a lot on
fuel cells and clean coal. Both are good things. We should be allowing
nuclear power, too.

Just my opinion. Not wanting to start a fight.

Maybe that's because they don't.
Oil is not made of dead dinos.
It's made from decaying vegetation. Most vegetation that grows has oils in

When it dies, it has to go somewhere. So, is oil so bad?

It sounds like motorboat anti-evolutionary thinking. Canoeing thinking
sees the need to take of our own environment and our own problems
(saving gas for one) and not doubtful democracy for Iraq. I see a lot
of garbage floating out there and nobody is taking care of it. Perhaps
we should outsource it like in Iraq. Where's the money though?

&gt; &gt; No they didn't.  What happened was, since bicycles and automobiles

&gt; Of course, a reason bicyclists &quot;failed&quot; is that motorists were able to

Thank you, American people, for subsidizing gas so the SUVs can
prosper and multiply...

"gas has been so crucial to our economy in the governments eyes that
they have subsidized a large portion of oil production, through
programs, tax-exemptions, and the hiding of pollution costs through
pollution permits. They have through intervention put off an
inevitable end-we will run out of gas sometime, if we continue forcing
prices down on a scarce product. In fact, government has actually
contributed to the overconsumption of oil. When government subsidizes
something (meaning they pay for a portion of it so that the consumers
don't have to) they effectively raise the demand for a product far
beyond where it naturally should be. They make it cheaper for the
companies to produce it and thus cheaper for consumers. This process
distorts market balance, because it hides costs, and creates what is
known as a moral hazard. If companies had to pay all the costs out of
their own pockets, they would produce less, and with a smaller output,
the cost would rise, and consumers would demand less and slowly ween
themselves off of this product and substitute another for it. They
would find communal travel, or alternate means of energy, things that
are both economically efficient and in the long run even better for
the environment. But because the government has absorbed the costs of
production, they have encouraged overconsumption of this good to the
extent that any miscalculation in their plan will result in the prices
skyrocketing towards the price equilibrium where oil naturally should
be, which is near 5 dollars per gallon or more. It is this type of
economic incentive that spurs innovation and gaurds scarce resources
from overconsumption.

The best solution I can think of now is to let the prices of gas..."

&gt; so now the gas guzzlers are the heroes?
&gt; Oil is not sold by the gallon by the way only gas.

&gt; I guess we should give the drivers a thumbs up when they get close and
&gt; intimate with us on the road.

&gt; But not knowing that fact about gov't support everyone still knew what it is
&gt; doing to the environment and resources so they are still to blame you know.
&gt; I know that is why I am a life long cyclist.

Yep, they are the heroes judging by the bumper stickers on their gas-
guzzling SUVs: "We support our troops" and "God bless America"...

The not-so-prosperous mostly supply the troops and a few cyclists who
dare to ride out there. David doesn't have a chance nowadays. You

I know we have a problem with the dinosaur. He's so stupid that he
doesn't see the need to change! So perhaps a wake up call could be
that we alert him that the asteroid is coming, or that we don't feed
him --or perhaps that he reads a book like this...

'Worldchanging: A Users Guide for the 21st Century' is a
groundbreaking compendium of the most innovative solutions, ideas and
inventions emerging today for building a sustainable, livable,
prosperous future.

"To build that future, we need a generation of everyday heroes, people
who - whatever their walks of life - have the courage to think in
fresh ways and to act to meet this planetary crisis head-on. This book
belongs in the library of every person who aspires to be part of that
generation."
- Al Gore

http://www.worldchanging.com/book/

I think it could be an action plan for THE REVOLUTION. It talks about
bicycle activism too, so, who knows, the cyclists may be the next
furry little mammals.

Well, it's not cocaine but another kind of addiction that goes through
the brain of the "voracious consumers" (SUVs, motorboats...)

'Oil on the Brain: Adventures from the Pump to the Pipeline'

'Lisa Margonelli's illuminating, entertaining stories of "people who
oversee oil's long journey to our cars." Starting at her neighborhood
filling station, she scurries up the pump like Alice down the rabbit
hole, to discover and chronicle the delivery trucks, refineries,
drilling rigs, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the oil market and,
most tellingly, the voracious consumers. Simply put, oil rules. It is
indispensable to our comfortable lifestyles and we will go to war over
access to it.

Running through the book, subterranean but ever present, is our
preposterous relationship to oil, an institutionalized addiction that
discourages strategic change. We feed the rat [dinosaur] instead of
setting a trap for it.

Today's petro-states are hazards in themselves: Margonelli's portraits
of Venezuela, Chad, Iran and Nigeria are cases in point. "Lurking
within [those countries] were instability, poverty, nationalism, and
deep anti-American feelings. The 2001 National Energy Policy, written
after secret consultations between Vice President Dick Cheney and oil
executives, concluded as much. ... Many people interpret it as a
virtual declaration of war." Weapons of mass destruction don't have to
be bombs; oil fits the bill quite nicely.'

http://www.envirosagainstwar.org/know/read.php?itemid=5209

"She realizes that the long term future of energy is not with oil. She
says: 'The United States could put its considerable money and
political will into creating new kinds of vehicles and fuels, while
creating incentives to use fossil fuels more efficiently.'
Unfortunately, when I listen to our politicians, I don't hear anything
about such things. Perhaps lip service as in the state of the union
message, but no action."

oil for cocaine)...

--I thought its was because we either can't afford powerboats or were
too cheap to buy one.--

Well, originally you may buy it because of that. But then you say,
"Gee, I'm also doing the right thing!" (I hate motorboats, but would
love to have a sailboat --and my canoe/kayak!)

Which brings us to the issue, ARE THE POOR BETTER ENVIRONMENTALISTS?
Well, some lions --a tiny minority-- got money and also have a small
footprint. Here for example is Paul Newman and his daughter. I was
reading last night how she defended having a Porsche, but only using
it once a week and then use public transportation the rest of the
week. Something understandable, no?

The very poor though may not have the inspiration to own a small
watercraft or bike for lack of education, and some, given the chance,
would love to become lions.

Just some thoughts about the jungle. ;)

Well, it takes a monkey to squeeze the pickle until the seeds are

Hey, I found this kayaker's dream to be similar to mine (written by
another Quixote charging at the giants!) Here it is...

land of giants

Small children walk in a land of Giants. Giants of course can't always
see what's going on so close to the ground. It can be tough to get a
giants attention. Giants are busy with GIANT problems. Giants have
GIANT pressures and GIANT distractions. Funny that they wonder why the
little people seems to talk loud, repeat questions, tug, pull and
sometimes just go crazy right when the giants are in the middle of
something of GIANT consequence. The problem you see, is the clouds.
The giant can't see below them and the little people can't see above.
It can be hard sometimes for a giant to understand or care about the
problems of the little people. They can seem so foreign. The little
people often just can't see the giants problems. But one thing they
know, something they learned from Jack, if you want a giant's
attention sometimes you have to steal his harp. Of course by then the
giant is angry, blustering and booming, and tripping over bean stalks
still stupidly unaware of what the little person wanted in the first
place. Remember Jack? Before all hell broke loose he was just hungry.

I woke up this morning thinking of giants and little people. Strange I
know. If you're a giant in little person's world, do me a favor, Look
down.

--These days seats are height adjustable.--

Bike seats are adjustable, but "egos" are harder to adjust.

My own sweetheart is 5' too. But she doesn't like SUVs for herself.
She found them "sexy" for men at the beginning of the relationship,
but I guess she was influenced by the monkey on the bike (me).

Now we got foldable bikes as well as a canoe when we want to have fun.
And why is it that lions make it wasteful and dangerous when looking
for pleasure? Yesterday we went out on the canoe, and there were a
bunch of motorboats speeding around in an orgy of gasoline --and quite
possibly alcohol and drugs. A scary place to be in a canoe, but you
can't live under fear all the time, right?

There's a question though regarding how the Law of the Jungle --the
Big Fish eats the Little Fish-- is applied between a motorboat and a
canoe. My take is that the canoe must run away from the charging
motorboat! It seems the monkey is always guilty no matter what... :(
