Daily Reflections

LISTEN, SHARE AND PRAY

When working with a man and his family, you should take
care not to participate in their quarrels. You may
spoil your chance of being helpful if you do.
ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 100

When trying to help a fellow alcoholic, I've given in
to an impulse to give advice, and perhaps that's
inevitable. But allowing others the right to be wrong
reaps its own benefits. The best I can do - and it
sounds easier than it is to put into practice - is to
listen, share personal experience, and pray for others.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day

A.A. Thought For The Day

Have I ceased being inwardly defeated, at war with
myself? Have I given myself freely to A.A. and to the
Higher Power? Have I got over being sick inside? Am I
still wandering mentally or am I &quot;on the beam?&quot; I can
face anything, if I am sure I am on the way. When I am
sure, I should bet my life on A.A. I have learned how
the program works. Now will I follow it with all I
have, with all I can give, with all my might, with all
my life? Am I going to let A.A. principles guide the rest
of my life?

Meditation For The Day

In this time of quiet meditation, follow the pressure of
the Lord's leading. In all decisions to be made today,
yield to the gentle pressure of your conscience. Stay or
go as that pressure indicates. Take the events of today
as part of God's planning and ordering. He may lead you
to a right decision. Wait quietly until you have an inner
urge, a leading, a feeling that a thing is right, a
pressure on your will by the spirit of God.

Prayer For The Day

I pray that today I may try to follow the inner pressure
of God's leading. I pray that I may try to follow my
conscience and do what seems right today.

As Bill Sees It

Pain-Killer----or Pain-Healer, p. 291

&quot;I believe that when we were active alcoholics we drank mostly to
kill pain of one kind or another--physical or emotional or psychic.
Of course, everybody has a cracking point, and I suppose you
reached yours--hence, the resort once more to the bottle.

&quot;If I were you, I wouldn't heap devastating blame on myself for
this; on the other hand, the experience should redouble your
conviction that alcohol has no permanent value as a pain-killer.&quot;

*********************************

In every A.A. story, pain has been the price of admission into a
new life. But this admission price purchased more than we
expected. It led us to a measure of humility, which we soon discovered
to be a healer of pain. We began to fear pain less, and desire humility
more than ever.

Walk In Dry Places

*** **Keeping the Faith with Guidance
Good  Orderly Direction
Does guidance from our Higher Power always come through?  We must
believe that it does, even when we don't seem to receive a visible answer.
Spiritual guidance usually doesn't come as we think it should.  What
we're likely to find instead is that over time, a number of unrelated
events come together for a good purpose.  Although this appears to be
chance or coincidence, very important outcomes often develop from simple
happenings___ maybe just from meeting someone on the street.
We can never really determine how any chain of events will play out. The
best we can do is to continue seeking guidance while following the
highest principles in our program.  Many chance happenings will be
recognized as guidance when we look back at an entire chain of events.
My best way to seek guidance is simply to remember today that my life
and affairs are in God's care and keeping.  The highest good will come
from this.

Keep It Simple

*** ** Don't give your advice before you are called upon.  Desiderius
Erasmus
If someone wants your advice, the person will ask for it. That's one
reason why in Twelve Step programs we don't go around trying to talk
people into joining. But people will ask us for advice. They'll see how
we've changed, and they'll want what we have. All we have to do is tell
them where we found it--in AA, NA or another Twelve Step group. We don't
tell them what to do. We tell them our own story--what it was like, what
happened, and where we are now. And we invite them to join us.
Prayer for the Day:  Higher Power, help me carry the healing message of
the program to these who ask for advice.
Action for the Day:  I'll make a decision to spend time with the next
person who ask for my help.**

**Alcoholics Anonymous - Fourth Edition

ON THE MOVE - Working the A.A. program showed this alcoholic how to get
from geographics to gratitude.

When I drove up to that first meeting, though, I saw that the address I
had was actually a church.  As a nice Jewish boy, I was not about to
wander into a church; I knew that I would not be welcome.  I hid on the
floorboards of the car and peeked out the window, waiting for the drunks
to walk by.  Everyone looked normal, so I figured I might be in the
wrong place.  I was about to leave, but then I saw a drinking buddy of
mine go by.  I jumped out of my car and greeted him.  Funny thing, but
it was his first meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous also.  What a
coincidence!  In we walked--into a world that has turned everything in
my life inside out.

Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions

Step Two - &quot;Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could
restore us to sanity.&quot;

Few indeed are the practicing alcoholics who have any idea how
irrational they are, or seeing their irrationality, can bear to face it.
Some will be willing to term themselves &quot;problem drinkers,&quot; but cannot
endure the suggestion that they are in fact mentally ill. They are
abetted in this blindness by a world which does not understand the
difference between sane drinking and alcoholism. &quot;Sanity&quot; is defined as
&quot;soundness of mind.&quot; Yet no alcoholic, soberly analyzing his destructive
behavior, whether the destruction fell on the dining-room furniture or
his own moral fiber, can claim &quot;soundness of mind&quot; for himself.

pp. 32-33

***********************************************************

Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your
strengths. When
you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.
--Arnold Schwarzenegger

Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.
--Buddha

In helping others, we shall help ourselves, for whatever good we give
out completes
the circle and comes back to us.
--Flora Edwards

As long as I am willing, God will always provide the answers. No one
said I would like
them, but I accept them.
--Shelley

&quot;Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must undergo the
fatigue of
supporting it.&quot;
--Thomas Paine

Sobriety is a journey of joyful discovery.

Recovery is not a race.

Every recovery from alcoholism began with one sober hour.

Father Leo's Daily Meditation

ORIGINALITY

&quot;Originality exists in every
individual because each of us
differ from the others. We are all
primary
--numbers divisible only by
ourselves.&quot;
Jean Guitton

For too many years I tried to be &quot;the same&quot; as other people; matched
their styles,
repeated their words, did what they wanted, lived to please a crowd of
people I did
not really know and they certainly did not know me! I said other
people's prayers,
quoted other people's opinions and memorized the ideas of others and I felt
empty.

Today I value the lives of others but I am slowly beginning to explore
my place in this
universe. Today I accept the &quot;specialness&quot; that is me; that uniqueness
makes me
God's miracle. Now others are listening and benefiting from my life.

***********************************************************

For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as
children of light
(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness and
truth) and find out
what pleases the Lord.
Ephesians 5:8-10

On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. &quot;Teacher,&quot;
he asked, &quot;what
must I do to inherit eternal life?&quot; &quot;What is written in the Law?&quot; he
replied. &quot;How do you
read it?&quot; He answered: &quot;`Love the Lord your God with all your heart and
with all your
soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, `Love your
neighbor as
yourself.'&quot; &quot;You have answered correctly,&quot; Jesus replied. &quot;Do this and
you will live.&quot;
Luke 10:25-28

***********************************************************

Daily Inspiration

Growth is not easy. It comes from fully experiencing each situation and
mastering it with understanding. Lord, Your presence in my life dispels
my fears and guides me through all of life's circumstances.

Today be cheerful when it is difficult and patient when that, too, is
difficult. Lord, I will let Your love for me flow through me and touch
those around me.

*Ask and you shall receive,*
*Seek and ye shall find, *
* Knock and it shall be opened unto you. *
* Matthew 7:7
