Statistics on google maps mashups?

Hi all,

I'm working on a paper for an academic journal looking at the potential
of user contributed and updated geographic data, and the open google
maps api is an incredible example of the potential of providing the
opportunity for users to share their geospatial data on the web. I was
wondering if any one has any statistics (or informed guesses), like how
many google maps mashups might exist, how many developer's keys have
been given out, or how many hits some of the top mashups get? I'm
attempting to contrast it against the US's Geospatial Onestop, which
the US government has dumped millions of dollars in to, but which has
maybe 300 sets of data, and in April of last year averaged about 5,000
hits a week. This data comes from a paper trying to make that out to
be a 'success', and I'd like to try to contrast against google maps,
and show how providing a useful service in an open way can get
'amateurs' creating vast amounts of valuable information, that the
government lead initiatives just miss out on. And that such a service
might actually be used by a wider public.

Best regards,

Chris

I don't have any stats to offer you but you can see that a couple
thousand users have already signed up for this forum during the last
few weeks just to discuss the ins-and-outs of making google maps.

The maps have taken off like a rocket, with hundreds of unusual uses
that stagger the imagination.

Google had the right idea to throw open the doors and let the many
minds out there apply their talents. It's open source at its very
(albeit chaotic) best.

check out   for something similar to the kind of
service you are looking for.

Oh yeah, they're prominently featured, google maps isn't an example of
actually allowing users to update base data in the way that OSM does
(and that I think has great potential), just of how providing a good
service, albeit less than fully open, and having open interfaces can
inspire user contributed data layers. I just want to try to get some
rough statistics on how extensively gmaps mash-ups might be.

There's some pretty big google map &quot;mashup&quot; sites on cheap gas prices,
chicago crime tracking, florida sex offenders. I've never seen this
kind of stuff, especially so easily useable, before Google Maps.

Also look at
It's a directory of google maps.
I did the second earthquake map under the science catagory.
Don't forget to click on some google ads while you are there.

Chris,

busmonster.com &lt;&gt; gets anywhere from 500-3000 users
visiting the front page of the site a day.

is a train-wreck when visited with a
Mozilla-based browser like Firefox. Click on a link and... absolutely
nothing happens (except you get a Javascript error). Last I heard,
that's 10% of the browser market. In the words of a great
philosopher... Doh! ;)

I've got a quite a few collections of google mashups on my blog here:

and here:

Cheers,

Sweet, thanks a ton everyone, and keep them coming.

And I'd posit that   is a trainwreak even when
visited with IE. And I think our taxpayer dollars are spending several
million on it.

Hi
Your study is really interesting Could you publish it or don't hesitate
to send it in by mail , it could be really interesting for my own
student project.
Thanks in advance.

It's not really a study, I just want data for some examples. It's not
complete, but I'm happy to publish it when I'm done. And if anyone
wants to take a look at the current draft, shoot me an email. I just
sent it to someone, with this note (so you all know what it's actually
about, since I was kinda vague):

It's actually on a good bit more than
just user contributed data. The basic thing they wanted me to write
on was open source, Spatial Data Infrastructures (academic term that I
find kinda bullshit, basically SDI is a spatial data internet, where
you could search for and access geo data from lots of diverse sources,
like if gmaps had a search facility to find housing info, or crime,
and then also like official government layers, and to overlay them on
one another and do gis analysis on them, ect.), and developing
countries. Initially was just going to write about os software and
SDI's (more or less making this paper I wrote:

a lot better, and expanding on user driven innovations). But ended up
looking at applying open source principles to both spatial data
itself, and to the creation of SDI's (comparing their failure to the
success of google maps, with tons of users adding useful data).

Like I said it's a draft now, but most of the main points I want to
make are there, and the references are just all unformatted and not
quite all there. But it's going to go through some review and probably
will shift around. Also it's kinda long, like 16 pages.
