Double Swiss Rolls

Serves 6
Recipe By: Tom Berry, Sara Moulton
Published in: Bambara Restaurant, Cambridge, Mass.

3 tablespoons olive oil
1 cup sliced shallot
2 tablespoons chopped garlic
5 bunch Swiss chard -- washed, stems removed and cut into ribbons
1 packages phyllo dough
1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter -- melted
8 to 12 slices Swiss cheese
Salt and freshly ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
Place a stockpot over medium heat. Coat the bottom of the pan with
olive oil and saute the shallot and garlic until lightly browned, 3
to 4 minutes. Add the Swiss chard and season with salt and pepper.
Cook until the chard is wilted and tender, 3 to 4 minutes. Place the
cooked chard in a strainer and cool in the refrigerator until
chilled. Squeeze any excess moisture from the chard before continuing.

Lay out 1 sheet of phyllo dough lengthwise left to right and brush
lightly with butter and season with salt and pepper. Place another
sheet of phyllo on top and repeat this until there are 4 layers.
Evenly cover the phyllo with slices of Swiss cheese, leaving 1 inch
uncovered at the top and bottom of the sheet. Take half of the cooled
chard and spread across the bottom of the phyllo sheet from side to
side. Start at the bottom and carefully roll the phyllo up and around
the chard like a sausage. Fold the ends of the log inward to seal.
Brush the top with butter so it won't dry out and make another log
with the remaining Swiss chard and phyllo dough. The logs can be made
1 day ahead and refrigerated. Place the logs on a sheet tray and bake
for 15 to 20 minutes until golden and crispy. Let the rolls rest for
5 minutes and then slice using a serrated knife into 2-inch pieces.
Serve hot or at room temperature.

Cook Time: 1 hour
Yield: 4 to 6 servings
