I'm about to switch my brand of flatpick (seems like it should be two
words....) for the first time in.... a long, long time.

I've used fender medium triangular (the rounded, not point triangle)
because they sounded good, were easy to find, were cheap, and I could
hold on to the damn things when I first used a pick.  I'm switching to
Clayton Triangle 72mm.  I have two Claytons at the moment, one a 72mm,
the other an 80mm.  I'm surprised at the tonal difference between the
two picks.  The 80 is just a bit thuddy; the 72 is crisp and clean.
The difference is very clear to my ear.

A few years back I ran into Stephen Kaufman.  He said that a medium
pick is the way to go... Lights are too clackity; heavy is too muddy.
He used the three thicknesses and man.... the sound was remarkably
different.  I had for years used mediums for the reasons he gave.  At
least I figured that out on my own.... :-)

Several years ago, I bought one (one) tortoise shell pick.... The
seller, who was someone I trusted implicitly, told me that the picks
he had were from mirrors and other things that dated from well before
the ban on turtle products.  It broke within a month or so, something
I hear is common with real tortoise.  That, and some guilt over buying
the thing to begin with, ended my fling with tortoise picks. The
Clayton picks, like several others, claim to have a tortoise sound....
I'm not sure about that, but I like the clarity and feel.

All this gets me to the question: what brand and thickness of pick do
you use?  Why?  What is there that you like about your pick?  This is
open to all types and styles of picks.... thumb, alaska, metal....
You name it.

Norman, for flatpicks, I use Fender 351 Heavies in clown barf.  I buy
them by the gross.

I like heavy celluloid, and don't think the Fender stuff sounds thuddy
at all.  Medium is too clicky for me and I break 'em.

For fingerpicks, I like the steel or brass Dunlops.  I used ProPik
FingerTones for years and swore by them.  When I finally lost my set,
I bought some cheap Dunlops and never went back.

For thumbpicks, I'll use pretty much anything except the ones that
have a metal frame.  I find those painful.  Otherwise, as long as it's
big and heavy, it's fine.

I am a strong advocate of the cheap pick.  With so many great ones to
choose from for well under a buck, I don't see the need for the exotic
stuff.

I'm particularly averse to using turtle shell, and the fact that the
material is pre-ban doesn't mitigate things for me a bit.  So I
understand why you didn't feel right about it either.

I always wind up with Dunlop Tortex picks (green or purple...whatever
thickness they are), Kelley speed picks for thumbpicks( the white ones), and
Guptil Propik Fingertone for finger picks (I used two words here...happy?).

I use several different shapes and sizes, depending on what I'm
playing and what style(s) of music.

For fingerpicking, I always use a thumbpick, usually a white National,
but sometimes a Propik.

For acoustic guitar flatpicking or just general acoustic playing, I
use a Clayton Ultem (gold) rounded triangle, .94mm thick.

http://elderly.com/accessories/items/PK91P-94.htm

If I'm mostly just strumming, I'll sometimes switch to the same thing
in the .80mm thickness. I used to use these for flatpicking, too, but
have come to prefer the slightly heavier .94mm gauge. I feel like I
get better tone and more fluid crosspicking with the heavier pick.

For electric guitar, I use a Clayton acetly polymer (white) standard
(teardrop) shape in the 1.00 mm thickness.

http://elderly.com/accessories/items/PK14P-STD-100.htm

In pinch, I'll use this pick for mandolin, too, but prefer a heavier
1.26mm or 1.52 mm thickness in the same shape and material.

I usually carry a National thumbpick, an Ultem rounded triangle ,94mm
and an acetal standard 1.00mm in my pocket.

I love the Claytons.  I have several
gauges, but I seem to gravitate toward
the .80mm.

I like the Clayton Gold Ultems 0.72 and 0.80.  I like them both and
don't have a preference between the two.  I like the tone, the feel in
my hand and the feel across the strings.

On the mandolin I like the Dawg picks.

On electric any old medium pick will do.

to me the grip on the pick and the pick depth and angle have a big
effect on the tone also.

My flat-picks (I like hyphens) are Fender Mediums... for such a long time that I just can't use anything else.  I always put a little handle on them by painting on a little super glue and dipping them in sand, brown sand for tortoise, or white for clown barf.

For thumb-picks I've come to like National Meduims, preferably in the old style.  On the fingers, my nails are working reasonably well these days.

I use all sizes and thicknesses as well as types dependent on the
guitar, style and sound I want. Ive got a collection of various bone
and ivory picks as well as some made from cymbals and even a real
tortes shell pick but I think I bought them more because they have
coolness factor more then usability.

My most common use picks are fender heavy or martin .96 but I have
some really light weight picks that I use for some things that get
almost a sweet sound.

You should just buy a dozen of each weight and try them out. For 25
bucks you can have it all -)

I like the Dunlop greens.  And for the thumb I use the Pearse National
reproduction.  I like the feel, and the pick isn't too long.

I've been using D'Andrea pro-grips (.71mm).  They have a rough surface
that's easy to hang onto.  When I can't get those I use Fender mediums.
Every instructor I've ever had tried to get me to use heavy picks, but I
just don't like 'em.  And, I don't think I've ever worn a pick out.  They
just seem to fall into a black hole somewhere.  Probably the same place your
socks go when you put them in the dryer.

I was reading something by a well-known guitarist who said the easiest way
to change your sound is to try different picks.  It's a lot cheaper than
trying different guitars.  I don't think most guitarists realize how big a
difference a pick can make.

I've also tried several types of fingerpicks, but find my own nails work and
sound much better.

WHEN, I flatpick, lately I use a Tortis Tri-tip medium.  This gives
three different tip shapes, and they seem to be suited to different
purposes/instruments.

Thumbpick - Fred Kelly Speedpick, Medium (orange) or Heavy (white)

Why? - It's the only thumbpick I've found that sounds like my natural
nails.

Flatpick - What's a flatpick?

Same old answer, Alaska plastic finger picks because they are the
nearest thing that I can find to playing with your nails, but don't wear
down half way through an evening of playing. They also gove me a tone
that I like.

A Kelly Speedpick thumb pick because it is comparatively comfortable,
and allows me to be as accurate as I ever am. A thumb pick also allows
me to hold my hand and thumb in a position that doesn't agravate my
arthritis.

Either a large Gibson triangular H (heavy gauge) or a Dunlop Tortex. I
mostly play mandolin but use the same for guitar. For the Dunlops I
tend to stick to 0.88m (geen) or heavier - following advice from way
back that too much flexibility in a pick means you start losing your
sense of exactly where the point is at any given moment. I'm not sure
my playing is accurate enough to merit such considerations, but that's
a different question!

Can't remember the brand, but I think one is a 60mm and the other
50mm. Almost as important to me is the color. the 60 is int'l orange
and the 50 is bright red. Also important: they are unbreakable. I have
had the same 4 picks (two of each) more years than I can remember. I
checked recently, and the local music stores all carry them on the
counter.
I use the 60 for louder, more aggresive music, the 50 for quieter
stuff.

I feel so boring and inadequate...Fender Mediums.  I try lots of other
stuff, and occasionally find stuff that's good for specific applications,
but always return to the basics because of cost and availability.

I do spice it up by buying pretty ones (mostly various colors of pearl), and
in Fender's line those are slightly nicer picks with polished edges.

For flatpicks, I'll use anything that fits my thumb well, usually National
Mediums.  Right now I have a really nice Clown Barf thumbpick that is
unlabeled, but I'll be losing it soon.

I like those funny orange ones and I have no idea what brand they are
or who makes them. Having said that, I can play with any pick you care
to throw at me, apart from those tiny Gibson picks from the '70's.

I like medium flexibility - too floppy and I don't get enough bite,
too hard and I break strings. Subtlety is not one of my strong points,
but basically if the pick isn't working well then I go into Mark
Knofler mode and finger pick it hard.

This, of course, involves putting your pick between your teeth, which
looks great onstage...:-)

The honest answer to this over the past 5-6 years has been &quot;whatever Al
Sato last handed me and told me to try out&quot;. He experiments more than I
do.

Right now it's mostly Dunlop Ultex .73 mm. I've also got a fair number
of triangular Clayton Ultem gold picks in 1.07 mm. And one
pseudo-tortoise pick, probably about 1.20, that I enjoy playing with
occasionally.

I used Fender #351 thins almost since birth.  I thought they sounded
best on rusted, flat, Black Diamonds (with unwrapped 3rd) over ply.

Then I had Al Sato test drive my NJ-45 rosewood after I got it set up.
He sat down with three or four different picks.  He switched them
while playing different styles of music.  It was his opinion that a
lot of the subtleties we talk about in strings could be covered
equally well by just using a different pick for a particular type of
music, or even song.

Having him sit there and me watching and listening convinced me.

I now buy medium Fenders in the large triangular shape with the pointy
ends, lay my brass template over it and cut my own.  This takes about
two minutes a pick to cut, file edges, and polish.

They are large, easy to handle, and without looking or feeling of
them, I have a choice of three pick shapes.

Question -- What was the first evidence of a flat pick on a US postage
stamp?

If you are interested in picks, get the book with the imaginative
title of --  &quot;Picks!&quot;  It is very pretty, with lots of colored photos,
and is quite readable.  Will Hoover, ISBN 0-87930-377-8.  (It comes

Norm,

Picks are like strings or women, some many out there and one of them is
the perfect one for you. Fortunately unlike strings or women picks are
cheap. Try a bunch, different shapes, different thicknesses, different
materials (I'm talking about picks here).
Strings and picks are much cheaper than replacing the nut or saddle and
will dramatically affect your tone.
I normally fingerpick but favor bass picks for some reason (dunlop). I
've never cared for thumbpicks

I've got quite a collection of picks just because most are so
inexpensive and it's an easy experiment.

For the moment I've settled on the Dunlop Ultex 1.14 for mainly flat
picking, some strumming.  I like the &quot;tone&quot; (less pick noise and it
plays/feels thinner than the thickness specified.

I started playing with the Dunlop Tortex .60 (orange) and .73 (yellow)
for most strumming.  After using the Ultex for several months I've
gravitated more to the Tortex yellow for most strumming due to the
thickness.  The Tortex orange feels too &quot;flimsy&quot; after playing with
thicker picks.

I mostly use bare fingers to pick a guitar, but there are times when a pick
of some kind would be very useful.  I've tried this type and that and still
haven't found anything that works really well for me.  It's good to hear
that other people are continually trying out new picks too.  It aint just me
then on a pick-quest...

Some of the larger US dealers have simply fantastic ranges of picks - all
kinds of flatpicks, fingerpicks, thumbpicks - in different shapes, designs,
materials from trad' to radical and new.  One of these days - and soon - I'm
going to treat myself to a personal pickfest' - and dedicate maybe circa
50/60 USD to buying a range of different stuff to try out.

I might find my holy grail... maybe not...  Even if I don't like any of
them, I can sell them on to people who would like them - or trade them on
for something else!

I don't have any picks at my bar and I have a couple of guitars behind
it and so I play them with fingers.  I am there so much, I play a lot
of songs with just fingers and then when I want to play them for
people with one of the other guitars, it doesn't sound right.

I don't think you can do with any picks what you can do with fingers,
so when I do a particular song, I cannot brush with the back of the
nail when I have a pick on it.  I might consider soldering a small fin
across the top of a thimble.

The best pick has yet been invented, but the one mentioned above is
the #351.  The shape is almost the same as the Nick Lucas pick.  The
original #351 die still exists.  It was built by Luigi D'Andrea in
1920.

Chris, as I mentioned earlier, I used the ProPik FingerTones for
several years.  I liked them because they were comfortable, and I
could get good tone out of them.

But, the whole idea that the exposed finger pads allow you to feel the
strings better doesn't really work for me.  With fingerpicks, I only
need to be striking the string with the very edge of the pick in order
to produce good tone.  With the FingerTones on, the flesh of my
fingers never touches the string [as evidenced by the mirror-shine
wear marks on the picks].  In fact, I know that if I'm feeling the
strings at all, I'm digging in way more than necessary and not picking
efficiently.

The ProPiks are no substitute for fingernails.  If you want the flesh-
and-nail sound, Alaska picks are a much better option, IMO.

Chris.

I tried the Propiks because I liked the idea of still being able to feel
the string, but didn't really get on with them. The Alaska plastic (they
make a metal version too) suit me better as they feel just like a nail
extension once you get used to them. They do take a little getting used
to though, but I think that applies to any finger or thumb picks.

I use the white Kelly Speedpicks.

I mus have tried just about every make and style of finger and thumb
picks over the years, and this combination is the only one that I can
use with any sort of accuracy.

Well such accuracy as I have.
