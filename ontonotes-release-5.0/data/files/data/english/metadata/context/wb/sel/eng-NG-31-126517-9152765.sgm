Ayurveda takes on allopathy in AIDS fight

NEW DELHI, Oct. 21

IT may not be long before a certain green-eyed
Bollywood diva or the man who almost won India an
Oscar Award this year are roped in to spread awareness
on AIDS in the country. But this and much more are on
the anvil in the anti-AIDS segment, with
Maharashtra-based Veronica Laboratories Ltd (VLL) set
to take on the Goliaths of the &quot;highly-cartelised&quot;
drug industry with Herbtab, an herbal anti-AIDS drug.

Mumbai-based Enpee Healthcare Ltd owns Herbtab. But
its marketing would be spearheaded by the Rs 22-crore
VLL, following a 10-year marketing deal that VLL
recently inked with Enpee. India alone has an
estimated 3.8 million HIV positive people - , but VLL
has no easy road ahead as it seeks to propel itself
into the drug industry's big league.

Given the stiff competition from allopathic
counterparts, Mr Bipin Shah, MD, VLL, told Business
Line that Herbtab would be supported by social
marketing in India, tie-ups abroad and public
interests campaigns. Domestic pharma big daddies to
contend with in this segment include: Ranbaxy, Cipla,
Aurbindo and Hetero, while GlaxoSmithKline is among
the biggest global players.

&quot;Herbtab is born out of Ayurvedic and Unani therapies
and has no toxic elements or side-effects. Unlike the
allopathic anti-AIDS cocktail that need to be taken
life-long - Herbtab needs to be taken only for 12 to
15 months. It strengthens the immune system by
facilitating increase in CD4 blood cells, vital for
immunity. And this has been proved in clinical
trials,&quot; he claimed.

Priced at Rs 10 per tablet, the dosage per patient is
three tablets taken three times a day or about Rs
2,700 per month. &quot;Allopathic drugs cost between Rs
1,000 to Rs 20, 000 per month, per patient. And yet,
anti-AIDS drugs clocked a sales of only Rs 30 crore
last year,&quot; he points out.

Cost to patient being of paramount concern, VLL seeks
to network with non-governmental organisations and
government-run institutions to make Herbtab available
to the consumer at one-third the cost, Mr Shah informs

Multi-centre Phase III trials, at an Rs 5-crore
budget, are being negotiated with premier government
institutes in New Delhi, Bangalore and the North East.
After successful trials at Mumbai's KEM Hospital,
Herbtab is available in Maharashtra, Karnataka and
Andhra Pradesh. It would be available nationally in
three months.

Roping in Bollywood

VLL has roped in Dr Jabbar Patel, director of
Bollywood-flick Ambedkar, for a documentary on AIDS,
expected to feature silver screen's biggest names. In
the past, Shabana Azmi and more recently, Madhuri
Dixit had featured in anti-AIDS campaigns. But the
grapevine has it that film world's leading
model-turned-actress and actor-turned-producer may be
roped in this time. Unwilling to spill the beans, Mr
Shah revealed that different regions would have their
respective matinee-idols in the documentary.
Meanwhile, public interest campaigns, to be aired in a
month, are being done by Avishkar Advertising
Services.
