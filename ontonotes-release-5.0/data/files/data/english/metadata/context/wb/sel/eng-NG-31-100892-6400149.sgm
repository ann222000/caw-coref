Moral philosophy, rightly considered, is closely analogous to traffic
engineering. Its aim is to devise a system of rules for governing human
interactions in social settings, just as the task of the traffic engineer is
to devise a system of rules governing the use of public roadways.

The moral philosopher assumes that the setting includes a number of agents,
that there is associated with each of those agents an ordered set of values,
or interests, which that agent seeks to satisfy, and that his actions are
always directed to satisfying one or more of those interests. Which interest
an agent acts to satisfy on a given occasion is determined by the current
weight of that value in the hierarchy and various "external" factors, such as
current opportunities presented by the environment and the current costs to
satisfy them.

Similarly, the traffic engineer assumes that the highway system is used by a
number of drivers, each of whom has a number of destinations to which he may
desire to travel at one time or another (an *itinerary*). The particular
destination chosen by a particular driver at a particular time is a function
of his needs at the moment, opportunities, and costs, just as for the moral
agent. Where the moral philospher is concerned with *acts* undertaken by
agents in a public setting, the traffic engineer is concerned with *trips*
undertaken by drivers on the public road system.

Note that, although I said that agents are "always" pursuing some interest,
(and might also have said that drivers are "always" traveling to some
destination), that neither the moral philosopher nor the traffic engineer
necessarily assumes that agents or drivers do nothing else in their lives.
But any other activities in which they may engage are outside the scope of
the philosopher's or engineer's concern.

Just as the traffic engineer is not concerned with the destinations chosen by
drivers, or their reasons for choosing them on any given occasion, neither is
the moral philosopher concerned with the values or interests pursued by moral
agents, or their reasons for pursuing them (there is an exception to this
rule, however, which we'll consider momentarily).

The traffic engineer, like the moral philosopher, also assumes that drivers
are *autonomous* and *independent*. That is, that the itineraries of drivers,
like the value hierarchies of agents, are chosen by each driver and agent
without regard to the itineraries or hierarchies of other drivers, and that
both agents and drivers are ignorant, for the most part, of others'
itineraries or hierarchies. I say "for the most part" because agents may at
times cooperate in pursuit of some shared interest, and drivers may at times
coordinate their trips, e.g., caravan. But most drivers using the system at
any given time will have no information regarding the destinations of other
drivers and will have no interest in them. Furthermore, the itineraries of
drivers will always differ from those of other drivers in some respect, and
usually in many respects. Likewise with moral agents and their values.

The traffic engineer assumes that without some controls in place for using
the public road system drivers will collide and interfere in other ways with
one another's trips. The moral philosopher assumes, similarly, that without
some rules in place, agents will interfere destructively with one another's
pursuit of their interests. So each adopts a "fundamental principle":

FP (Traffic Engineer): Devise a system of rules which allow all drivers to
complete their trips (reach their destinations) in the shortest possible
time, with the fewest collisions possible.

FP (Moral philosopher): Devise a system of rules which allow all agents to
attain their goals at the least possible cost, with the fewest collisions
possible.

Both also assume a sub-principle of "safety first" --- avoiding collisions
outweighs minimizing travel times or costs.

I mentioned that there was an exception to the generalization that traffic
engineers and moral philosophers are unconcerned with drivers' or agents'
destinations or interests, respectively. The exceptions are those
destinations or interests which are incompatible, *prima facie*, with the
premise of a public road system accessible to all drivers, or with a moral
field open to all agents. Those would include destinations on the public
highway system itself --- one may not end one's trip in the middle of a
roadway. Similarly, one may not, in a social setting, pursue interests which
necessarily preclude others' pursuits of theirs. Only "non-interfering
interests" and "non-interfering destinations" are allowable.

Thus both the traffic engineer and the moral philosopher face an optimization
problem --- to find that set of rules which *best* satisfies their respective
Fundamental Principles.

In the book at the link below, Barber argues something about how
people regulate each other on the highway, by various means they make
each other drive similarly or something by pressurring each other to
conform to the "constant" which often ends up with its panties in a

Kindness In A Cruel World: The Evolution Of Altruism
by Nigel Barber
http://www.amazon.com/Kindness-Cruel-World-Evolution-Altruism/dp/1591...

In his Critique of Judgment Kant discussed the nature of living
organisms. He argued that organisms, in contrast with machines, are
self-reproducing, self-organizing wholes. In a machine, according to
Kant, the parts only exist "for each other", in the sense of
supporting each other within a functional whole. In an (organism) the
parts also exist by means of each other, in the sense of producing one
another. "We must think of each part as an organ," wrote Kant, "that
produces the other parts (so that each reciprocally produces the
other). . . . Because of this, the organism will be both an organized
and self-organizing being." With this statement Kant became not only
the first to use the term "self-organization" to define the nature of
living organisms, he also used it in a way that is remarkably similar
to some contemporary conceptions.

That sounds like consequentialism, not Kantianism.  The traffic
engineer is not concerned with whether drivers obey the traffc rules
from enlightened self-interest, fear of consequences, empathy for the
other drivers, or from duty alone; only in whether they stop or not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How is it reasonable for drivers to act?
">

Which has nothing to do with what their motive for acting is.   In
fact, by enforcing the traffic rules (by fining drivers who do not
stop at red lights, for example), the traffic authorities ensure that
the system is not moral, in the Kantian sense - a patently non-moral
(in the Kantian sense) motive, fear of the traffic police, is being
blatantly substituted for pure duty, which in Kantianism ought to the
sole motive governing the drivers' actions.

My comments which I hoped were relevant for you were in the previous

".... the Kantian take on what morality is: a mechanism for

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; regulating social intercourse....&quot;
">

I've lurked in some of your Kant threads in ap, apo and apk.
A lot of disagreement, IMO, stems from varying takes on what morality is and
should be.
Schopenhauer torpedoed the CI very early, saying that what Kant is doing is
not describing
morality qua some sort of "goodness", but solely as proper behaviour for a
subject of the Law;
which, of course, is obedience to the law. This is founded on a rational
theory of justice, which in turn rests on freedom, which in turn rests on an
individualism that says that no one knows what is good for everyone - we are
free to engage in the pursuit of our individual happiness, within the
boundaries of fairness (my freedom is limited by that of any others).

Which has little to do with "goodness" in an e.g. religious (faith, hope and
charity) sense, a Nietzschean sense, an Aristotelian sense (virtue ethics)
etc. etc. which all presume some sort of universal goodness one should
attain, or, in the case of Nietzscheans, embody.

To me, this goodness/fairness distinction explains why we have the
inclination/duty brouhaha wrt. Kant.
It is eminently sensible to question his take that morality = obedience to
the law; otoh, rejecting this opens up to all sorts of paternalism, someone
knowing what is good for me without really consulting me, except with
torches and pitchforks should I stray from the straight and narrow.

In a sense he highlights a possible hypothesis that "love" and "freedom" are
antithetical; while we, thx to Jesus &amp; Cie,  are wont to equating "love"
with "goodness" and "goodness" with "being a nice person" and "being a nice
person" with "morality".

I'd say that Schopenhauer has it completely wrong here.  There are
moralities that are solely concerned with actions or conscious
behavior - consequentialist theories, like my own - but Kant's is not
one of them.  Kant is concerned not just with what rules a moral agent
follows, but more importantly with the 'goodness' of the agent's
will.  IN the examples I quoted, he specifically says that, of two
moral agents who act in exactly the same way, only one - the one who
performs the act purely "from duty" - is acting morally, while the
other - who performs the exact same act from "selfishness" or
"pleasure" - is not being morally good at all.

&gt; &gt; number of drivers, each of whom has a number of destinations to which he may
&gt; &gt; desire to travel at one time or another (an *itinerary*). The particular
&gt; &gt; destination chosen by a particular driver at a particular time is a function
&gt; &gt; of his needs at the moment, opportunities, and costs, just as for the moral
&gt; &gt; agent. Where the moral philospher is concerned with *acts* undertaken by
&gt; &gt; agents in a public setting, the traffic engineer is concerned with *trips*
&gt; &gt; undertaken by drivers on the public road system.

&gt; &gt; Note that, although I said that agents are &quot;always&quot; pursuing some interest,
&gt; &gt; (and might also have said that drivers are &quot;always&quot; traveling to some
&gt; &gt; destination), that neither the moral philosopher nor the traffic engineer
&gt; &gt; necessarily assumes that agents or drivers do nothing else in their lives.
&gt; &gt; But any other activities in which they may engage are outside the scope of
&gt; &gt; the philosopher's or engineer's concern.

&gt; &gt; Just as the traffic engineer is not concerned with the destinations chosen by
&gt; &gt; drivers, or their reasons for choosing them on any given occasion, neither is
&gt; &gt; the moral philosopher concerned with the values or interests pursued by moral
&gt; &gt; agents, or their reasons for pursuing them (there is an exception to this
&gt; &gt; rule, however, which we'll consider momentarily).

&gt; &gt; The traffic engineer, like the moral philosopher, also assumes that drivers
&gt; &gt; are *autonomous* and *independent*. That is, that the itineraries of drivers,
&gt; &gt; like the value hierarchies of agents, are chosen by each driver and agent
&gt; &gt; without regard to the itineraries or hierarchies of other drivers, and that
&gt; &gt; both agents and drivers are ignorant, for the most part, of others'
&gt; &gt; itineraries or hierarchies. I say &quot;for the most part&quot; because agents may at
&gt; &gt; times cooperate in pursuit of some shared interest, and drivers may at times
&gt; &gt; coordinate their trips, e.g., caravan. But most drivers using the system at
&gt; &gt; any given time will have no information regarding the destinations of other
&gt; &gt; drivers and will have no interest in them. Furthermore, the itineraries of
&gt; &gt; drivers will always differ from those of other drivers in some respect, and
&gt; &gt; usually in many respects. Likewise with moral agents and their values.

&gt; &gt; The traffic engineer assumes that without some controls in place for using
&gt; &gt; the public road system drivers will collide and interfere in other ways with
&gt; &gt; one another's trips. The moral philosopher assumes, similarly, that without
&gt; &gt; some rules in place, agents will interfere destructively with one another's
&gt; &gt; pursuit of their interests. So each adopts a &quot;fundamental principle&quot;:

&gt; &gt; FP (Traffic Engineer): Devise a system of rules which allow all drivers to
&gt; &gt; complete their trips (reach their destinations) in the shortest possible
&gt; &gt; time, with the fewest collisions possible.

&gt; &gt; FP (Moral philosopher): Devise a system of rules which allow all agents to
&gt; &gt; attain their goals at the least possible cost, with the fewest collisions
&gt; &gt; possible.

&gt; &gt; Both also assume a sub-principle of &quot;safety first&quot; --- avoiding collisions
&gt; &gt; outweighs minimizing travel times or costs.

&gt; &gt; I mentioned that there was an exception to the generalization that traffic
&gt; &gt; engineers and moral philosophers are unconcerned with drivers' or agents'
&gt; &gt; destinations or interests, respectively. The exceptions are those
&gt; &gt; destinations or interests which are incompatible, *prima facie*, with the
&gt; &gt; premise of a public road system accessible to all drivers, or with a moral
&gt; &gt; field open to all agents. Those would include destinations on the public
&gt; &gt; highway system itself --- one may not end one's trip in the middle of a
&gt; &gt; roadway. Similarly, one may not, in a social setting, pursue interests which
&gt; &gt; necessarily preclude others' pursuits of theirs. Only &quot;non-interfering
&gt; &gt; interests&quot; and &quot;non-interfering destinations&quot; are allowable.

&gt; &gt; Thus both the traffic engineer and the moral philosopher face an optimization
&gt; &gt; problem --- to find that set of rules which *best* satisfies their respective

Not every traffic engineer, and not every moral philosopher - but your
point is well taken in this case.   Kant is concerned not with whether
people to act in accordance with the CI, but with why they're doing so
- whether they're acting from 'duty' or for some other motive.   It's
the same as if the traffic authorities were to declare,  not only that
drivers had to follow the rules of the road, but that they had to
follow those rules purely from 'duty' to the authorities, and that

he didn't want to be involved in an accident) should lose his licence.

&gt;&gt; I've lurked in some of your Kant threads in ap, apo and apk.
&gt;&gt; A lot of disagreement, IMO, stems from varying takes on what morality is
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; should be.
&gt;&gt; Schopenhauer torpedoed the CI very early, saying that what Kant is doing
&gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; not describing
&gt;&gt; morality qua some sort of &quot;goodness&quot;, but solely as proper behaviour for
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; subject of the Law;
&gt;&gt; which, of course, is obedience to the law.

&gt; I'd say that Schopenhauer has it completely wrong here.
">

Of course my remarks don't do S.'s viewpoint justice.
His discussion is rather longer than this.
And his pointof attack is actually very much the same as your fining traffic
authorities.
AFAIR, S. claims that Kant assumes that everyone is "the weaker" sooner or
later - we get poor, need help... whatever; and therefore we have to throw
ourselves upon the mercy of our neighbours; and they will only help us if we
have already helped them or are willing to help them in the future. The
whole Kantian system, S. says, breaks down if there should be a man who
counts on never being the weaker. Thus, he continues, the whole system is
based on fear of somehow losing out,  and as such is not an impersonal, duty
based rational system at all, but merely egoism shrouded in fancy wording.

There are

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; moralities that are solely concerned with actions or conscious
&gt; behavior - consequentialist theories, like my own - but Kant's is not
&gt; one of them.
">

Um .... this may be a small quibblette, but although good will is important
to Kant,
what makes a will good is the agent's adherence to duty. Nothing about
compassion or anything.

And forgive me for believing so, but I've always considered to link between
consciousness and reason to be a rather close one. Which makes be think that
Kant is very much concerned with conscous behaviour. Or am I missing your
point here?

Kant is concerned not just with what rules a moral agent

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; follows, but more importantly with the 'goodness' of the agent's
&gt; will.
">

Yes, but see above.

IN the examples I quoted, he specifically says that, of two

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; moral agents who act in exactly the same way, only one - the one who
&gt; performs the act purely &quot;from duty&quot; - is acting morally,
">

Right. But isn't that my point ...?

while the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; other - who performs the exact same act from &quot;selfishness&quot; or
&gt; &quot;pleasure&quot; - is not being morally good at all.
">

Right.
But this list of motives is not exhaustive, is it?
One may perform a good act from general kindness and charity,
and sthe act may still not be considered "good" by Kant if it is not
performed out of duty.
That makes him, the way I see it, cut across a lot of our intuitions about
what goodness is.
To many, goodness is very simlar to kindness - being a good person, a kind
person.
(Personally, I think this is not totally wrong. )

To pursue my original point, what can any person mean by an opinon like
Kant's on this?
How would such a person explain the meaning of "goodness"? Such a usage is
different than ordinary language, it must have a special interpretation;
and, AFAICS, so it is with Kant.

Quotes:

On the identity of the CI with obedience to the Law:
"da der Imperativ außer dem Gesetze nur die Notwendigkeit der Maxime
enthält, diesem Gesetze gemäß zu sein, das Gesetz aber keine Bedingung
enthält, auf die es eingeschränkt war, so bleibt nichts als die
Allgemeinheit eines Gesetzes überhaupt übrig, welchem die Maxime der
Handlung gemäß sein soll, und welche Gemäßheit allein der Imperativ
eigentlich als notwendig vorstellt." (Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten,
Akademie-Ausgabe Kant Werke IV, S. 420, 18-20 )

On duty:

"Pflicht ist die Notwendigkeit einer Handlung aus Achtung fürs Gesetz."

&gt;&gt; Kant wants to explain how we as drivers can and must create a system of

&gt; That sounds like consequentialism, not Kantianism.  The traffic

Yea...my only offering here is that dogs can learn tricks.  Does that mean
the dog is moral for behaving in certain ways as trained?  I differentiate

I don't reject teleology in general. Teleology constitutes the substrate, the
precondition, for deontology. We need rules because people have goals, and to
reach those goals they must be free to act, i.e., to choose the methods and
means of attaining them. But in a social setting, they will be tempted to
view others as means to their own ends. And in the absence of some rules,
arrived at via reason, they will have *no reason not to do so*.

Reason tells us that such a strategy, if universally or even widely followed,
is destructive to our own ends, and everyone else's. Hence we direct our
attention to forging some rules.

Moral theory is concerned with those rules, not with the goals sought. Goals
differ among agents, and are not products of reason. Moral rules thus cannot
be rationally justified on the basis of the ends attained when applying them
in particular cases, and certainly not selected because they are productive
of certain ends. They must be justified, instead, on the ground that they
allow all agents maximal freedom to pursue their ends, whatever they may be.
That requires that they be universalizable and regard all agents as ends in
themselves, and not as means to particular ends.

Kant does not dismiss teleology. He only argues that ends cannot be invoked
to justify moral rules. Ends "factor out" in arguments for rules.

However (as we've discussed previously) those rules, once rationally
justified, can become "internalized" by agents and thus become a kind of end,
or good, in their own right --- what we might call "metagoods." That
transformation of rationally justifed rules into metagoods constitutes
progress toward the *summum bonnum*, where virtue and happiness become
coextensive.

And don't foget the totalitarians, who think the way to avoid collisions is
to herd everyone in the same direction.

&gt; Yea...my only offering here is that dogs can learn tricks.  Does that

The traffic engineer is indeed a "law giver," but not a tyrant. He is not
*imposing* any rules, but offering systems of rules for the consideration of
the drivers on the road, who may adopt and follow them or not. He is only a
systems analyst. He is consulted for his presumed expertise in the subject
matter, and his only enforcement tools are the clarity and cogency of his
reasoning.
