As part of the probe, committee investigators found that White House
drug czar John Walters took 20 trips at taxpayers' expense in 2006 to
appear with Republican congressional candidates.

In a separate investigation, the independent Office of Special Counsel
concluded that GSA Administrator Lurita Alexis Doan violated the Hatch
Act, which limits the political activities of government employees.

Witnesses told investigators that Doan asked at the end of one
political briefing in January 2007 what her agency could do to help
GOP candidates.

Doan has said she doesn't recall that remark.

In the months leading up to the 2002 election, then-Commerce Secretary
Don Evans, Bush's former campaign finance chairman, made eight
appearances or announcements with Republican incumbents in districts
deemed by White House aides either as competitive districts or
battleground presidential states.

During the stops, he doled out millions of dollars in grants,
including in two public announcements with Rep. Heather Wilson, a New
Mexico Republican in a competitive district.

........................................................................... ....................................

In 2004, Evans and his aides significantly scaled back appearances
with candidates, but an assistant treasury secretary returned to New
Mexico to announce with Republicans Sen. Pete Domenici and Rep. Steve
Pierce the release of $2.5 million in economic development funds.

Evans, who now heads the Financial Services Forum, a trade association
for financiers, declined comment, a Forum spokesman said.

In 2006, Evans' successor, Carlos Gutierrez, and his aides also made
public announcements with several Republican congressional incumbents,
including in the battleground states of Missouri, Pennsylvania and New
Mexico.

Weeks before the 2006 election, Gutierrez and Congresswoman Wilson
announced $3.45 million in grants for Albuquerque organizations.

Also in the weeks before the election, a deputy secretary and
Republican Sen. Rick Santorum announced that the department would be
investing $2.25 million in Philadelphia.

The same year, then-Treasury Secretary John Snow and Santorum
announced an award of millions in tax credits to Pennsylvania
organizations.

........................................................................... ....................

Snow and his aides also made appearances in 2006 with Republican
incumbents or doled out grants in Virginia, Iowa and Ohio, states seen
as crucial to the GOP retaining control of Congress.

........................................................................... .........................

John D. &quot;Jerry&quot; Hawke, who served as Treasury undersecretary for
domestic finance in the Clinton administration, said the
campaign-style briefings for Treasury appointees were unusual.

&quot;Nothing remotely like that happened,&quot; during the Clinton
administration, Hawke said.

&quot;I never experienced anything like that. The notion that the White
House would be holding meetings with Treasury appointees just didn't
fit.&quot;

Commerce, Treasury funds helped boost GOP campaigns

By Marisa Taylor and Kevin G. Hall | McClatchy Newspapers

WASHINGTON —

Top Commerce and Treasury Departments officials appeared with
Republican candidates and doled out millions in federal money in
battleground congressional districts and states after receiving White
House political briefings detailing GOP election strategy.

Political appointees in the Treasury Department received at least 10
political briefings from July 2001 to August 2006, officials familiar
with the meetings said.

Their counterparts at the Commerce Department received at least four
briefings — all in the election years of 2002, 2004 and 2006.

The House Oversight Committee is investigating whether the White
House's political briefings to at least 15 agencies, including to the
Justice Department, the General Services Administration and the State
Department, violated a ban on the use of government resources for
campaign activities.

Under the Hatch Act, Cabinet members are permitted to attend political
briefings and appear with members of Congress.

But Cabinet members and other political appointees aren't permitted to
spend taxpayer money with the aim of benefiting candidates.

During the briefings at Treasury and Commerce, then-Bush
administration political director Ken Mehlman and other White House
aides detailed competitive congressional districts, battleground
election states and key media markets and outlined GOP strategy for
getting out the vote.

Commerce and Treasury political appointees later made numerous public
appearances and grant announcements that often correlated with GOP
interests, according to a review of the events by McClatchy
Newspapers.
