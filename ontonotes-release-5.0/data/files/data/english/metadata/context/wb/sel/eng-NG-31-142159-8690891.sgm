Despite international pressure and proposals from friendly Asean
countries, military ruled State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)
said they are marching towards Democracy with their own 7 points road
map which might be different from western democracy. Drafting a new
Constitution at (Nyaung-hnapin) National Convention to institute
Democracy in Burma with it's handpicked candidates. Put aside NLD
party, a landslide election winning party since 1990 and top leaders
are under house arrest and hundreds of prominent NLD and ethnic
minority leaders are serving 100 year terms in jail. SPDC argues that
western democracy has no discipline and it is not appropriate for
Asian country like Burma. Burma needs Genuine Disciplined Democracy
which leads the Army Chief of Staffs to take 25% of the candidates in
the Parliament forever. The Good Army Chief of Staffs shall appoint
the President, Prime Minister, Defense Minister, Home Minister and
Foreign Minister for the country. The Army Chief of Staffs shall
dissolve the parliament and entire government at any time but nobody
shall sack the Army Chief of Staffs. Oppositions point out The Army
Chief of Staffs is above the law and like a king of the country. But
SPDC seems determined to cling to their road map and stick to the
power at any cost.

It shows that SPDC doesn't care sanction, doesn't mind developing
Burma, doesn't care foreign investment, for them the power is the
center of all universe. They feared oppositions are trying to rob
their power from their hands. They pretended they are the real
guardians of the country and Democracy system is weakening them and
shaking their chair/power, so they will never give up the fight. Pity,
they become freaks and can't see anything clearly, envision
oppositions as their rivals for possession of the power.
They didn't have real education but guns and power, so their decision
become feverish,
FIGHT THE OPPOSITION,   KILL THEM ALL!!!  And bring down the country
to the bottom with them.

Luckily, a lot of new activist arise these days and SPDC did not have
a position to send them to jail easily like previous political
oppositions. It seems SPDC have no nerves to touch them, I think
International Pressure was in right direction and working well.
88 generation student leaders Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi and the group,
Force labor activist Su Su Nway, Lawyer U Aye Myint, Health care and
Human Rights activist Phyu Phyu Thin, Htin Kyaw and others are
campaigning anti dictatorship and anti military talks and interviews
with foreign radio stations almost every night. Short wave radio sails
are regularly increasing and the whole country can tune in those radio
stations. Thanks to the independent radio stations like BBC, VOA, RFA
and DVB, Burmese people are well informed and watching the cornered
wounded SPDC.
The thick SPDC leaders did not grasp the situation and double the fuel
prices two days ago shaken the whole country which might ignited the
general strike. Following the path and digging their own grave like
BSPP? I heard some courageous group gave ultimatum to SPDC to denounce
the new fuel prices or they will start demonstration in Yangon. Seems
we'll witness the very interesting events ahead.
