A track plan tatoo! Great plan, wonder what my wife think of it......

They did it again at MR. Every year I wonder what they come up with next.
This is the best 1 april joke in years.
Even better as the upside down tracksystem.

Honestly, Rob, I thought this year's offering was pretty weak and
obviously a joke from the outset. There have been occasions in the
past where you could read through the entire April Fool's articles and
only realize after giving it some thought that it was meant as a joke.
I feel that the best example was from long ago. It was one for a
moonbase layout, perhaps in the 1970's. The article was extremely well
done, detailed and so convincing that several readers later wrote in
about having built examples! More recently, the "product review" of a
prototype boxcar was pretty good.

Well, that moon base layout was IMO the best kind of fun: light hearted,
yet well worked out. If you were going to build a RR on the moon, the MR
design would work as well as any. Well, it might need a few tweaks. :-)

I suspect MR published in the April issue because then the tight-arses
could dismiss it as mere April Fools joke.

We need more foolishness. Serious modelling and nonsense can co-exist
quite nicely.

I kinda liked the product review of the prototype box car.  They could
have run that any issue and I'd have enjoyed it, though.

The tube train also sticks in my mind.  With a little wood (balsa or
pine) and some weight, and some water, you could build a "tube train"
that's powered not by electricity, but water itself.  Hm... sounds like
fun for someone with those materials laying around and small chunks of
time to use.

Heh; reminds me of part of the recent PBS program on the creation of the
New York subway system. The first design actually built was a car that
was moved by blowing air through the tube; it actually ran for a
distance of several blocks, though it was found to be completely
impractical for any longer distances. This could be an interesting
project, kind of like those tubes in stores and offices they use to
whoosh small containers from place to place.

Actually Beach's pneumatic railroad ran for only about 300 feet. The
question of practicality is a moot one as Beach ran out of money
before any extension could be made. The duration of operation was
approximately one year and predated the building of the first IRT by
over thirty years. The whole episode is an interesting story full of
corporate and governmental corruption. I don't believe the car was
blown through the tube, rather it was sucked by using pumps to
establish a partial vaccuum. Thank you.
