'Match Game's' Brett Somers Dies at 83

WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) - The son of actress and comedienne Brett Somers says
she has died in Westport of stomach and colon cancer. She was 83.

Somers' son, Adam Klugman, says she died Saturday at her home. She was best
known for her appearances on the &quot;Match Game&quot; in the 1970s.

She married actor Jack Klugman, star of the television shows &quot;Quincy&quot; and
&quot;The Odd Couple,&quot; in 1953. The two separated in 1974, but never divorced.
Somers appeared on several episodes of &quot;The Odd Couple,&quot; playing the ex-wife
of Klugman's character.

Later in her career, she appeared in a cabaret show, &quot;An Evening with Brett
Somers.&quot;

She was born in Canada and grew up in Maine.

Actress Brett Somers Is Dead at 83
By Robert Simonson
17 Sep 2007

Brett Somers, the salty television and stage actress who is best remembered
as a tart-tongued panelist on the game show &quot;The Match Game&quot; in the 1970s,
died Sept. 15 according to her personal web site. She was 83.

Ms. Somers, Charles Nelson Reilly and Richard Dawson were the mainstays on
&quot;The Match Game,&quot; on which contestants were asked to fill in the blank at
the end of some bawdy sentences, and hope that their guesses matched those
of the panelists. Ms. Somers was the only woman to hold a steady seat on the
panel, but, with her hearty laugh and &quot;one of the boys&quot; manner, she fit
right in.

Ms. Somers was also well known for her recurring role as Jack Klugman's
ex-wife Blanche on the television series &quot;The Odd Couple.&quot; The two actors
married in real life 1953 and had two children. It was Klugman who suggested
to the producers of &quot;The Match Game&quot; that they use her on the show. They
separated in 1974. She had a third child, a daughter, by an earlier
marriage.

Ms. Somers had a single Broadway credit, 1958's Maybe Tuesday, which ran all
of five performances. In 2003, she performed a caberet act in New York in
which she looked back at her career. Other theatre credits included Happy
Ending, The Seven Year Itch, and The Country Girl. Her television credits
were extensive, and included &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show,&quot; &quot;Have Gun-Will
Travel,&quot; &quot;The Defenders,&quot; &quot;Ben Casey&quot; and &quot;Barney Miller.&quot;

She was born Audrey Sommers July 11, 1924, in New Brunswick, Canada, and
raised near Portland, ME.

Well, she and Charles Nelson Reilly are able to kvetch again.  There's

Always sad to read about someone dying, but I remember watching the
Match Game and never quite figuring out- who she was, and why she was
on the show. I do not remember her being funny or anything, and I had
no idea she was married to Jack Klugman. Live and learn as they say.

No, but it IS a comparison.

And he was.

Brett was okay and she certainly stood out enough to be fondly remembered
thirty... forty?... years after the fact but while we're remembering, I
doubt anyone stands out more than Paul Lynde.

If there's anything to be said about everyone, it is that it was a

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Match Game's' Brett Somers Dies at 83

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) - The son of actress and comedienne Brett
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Somers says she has died in Westport of stomach and colon cancer.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; She was 83.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, she and Charles Nelson Reilly are able to kvetch again.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There's something nice about that...

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's sad to see her passing.  She was a funny woman.

&gt;&gt; Paul Lynde is funnier than both of 'em put together.

&gt; It's really not a contest...

&gt;&gt; &gt;Yep, and one of the few where if you think that &gt;one person was better

&gt;&gt; than another it actually &gt;doesn't diminish the contribution of anyone

&gt;&gt; &gt;because they were all so good.

&gt;&gt; Brett was one of the few panelists that could diffuse a Paul Lynde
&gt;&gt; comment with one *glaring* look.

&gt; Like we all do when when we respond to your *witless* posts here...???
