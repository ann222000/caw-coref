I have a 97 cherokee 4.0L Auto, with just 68K miles. In three years all
I have had to do is basic servicing.  I have had zero faults. Last
weekend  it would not start (no spark or fuel being injected), and a
friend towed me home. I have since spent several hours on the web to
try and find a fix. I have read all about the CPS and the cam sensor in
the distributor, plus checking the fuel pump etc.

So far I have established there is fuel under pressure in the fuel rail
by pressing the pin on the valve, I checked all fuses and swapped
around the relays, and I have disconnected and reconnected the battery
after giving it a full charge. The earth strap from the cyl head to
bulkhead is in good order. I have disconnected and reconnected the CPS
several times.

The instruments and warning lights are behaving as normal. i.e. The
warning lights come on when the ignition is switched on and then go out
after a few seconds. The check engine light comes on then goes off with
the others.

I then ran the diagnostics by holding down the trip meter button and
turning on the ignition. It ran through the numbers from 000000 to
999999 and then went back to 0.000. It did not come up with any faults
or a 55 to say the test was complete. I then tried the test with CPS
disconnected and still got no fault showing. Whilst indexing through
000000 111111 222222 etc., all the gauges seemed to go through a
sequence increasing in value and then decreasing back to zero.

So the diagnostics do not indicate a problem or even show that the
battery has been disconneted recently.... But I still have no spark or
fuel. Any ideas or suggestions. thanks in advance

Bob,

Since no one's jumped into the quagmire just yet, let me remind you
that code retrieval is on-off-on-off-on within 5 [?] seconds, not the
instrument cluster test you're performing.  While we're at it, your CPS
may not trip a code simply unplugged unless you're cranking.  Your
logic, to the best of my knowledge, is headed in the right direction
with the no spark, no injector symptom.

There -- step one.

Jon

I'll jump in too.  I would recommend you get a manual for it, even a
Cheapie Haynes gives the multimeter tests for the coil and some for the
ignition module to see if they are still good.

Maybe you can find the manual online, I know a few are...

I don't know if you can retrieve codes in a 97 or not, but it is key on,
off, on, off, on within a few seconds if it works.

Hi Bob,
Ninety nine percent of the time it will be the Crankshaft Position
Sensor. I would go ahead and replace it:

I agree, if it is bad, there wll be no spark. There is no ggod way to
check it for sure unless you have a scope to see pulses from it. As
long as coil is not open to set a code it can still be bad and still
read resestance on a test. It is its ability to send pulses that makes
it or breaks it.

Maybe go to Autozone and get them to read the codes with their hand held

Hi

thanks for the responses, I have tried the on-off-on-off-on, and
on-off-on-off-on-off-on, both within five seconds, and also by waiting
for the odometer to light at each on. Still no codes.

Unfortunately I am 2 hours from a dealer in the back of beyond, and no
faith in local shops. Can anyone help with an OEM part No. for both the
crank and cam postion sensor, as I will order both parts.

thanks

Man I hate shotgunning parts at things...

Do you have a multimeter?  If so I would check for power at the coil
positive with the key in 'run'.  If I had power there, I would unplug
the coil and check it with the meter.  Ok, my Haynes covers the 97 and
it says from the coil + to the coil case should be an open circuit or
infinite resistance.  If you touch the positive and negative with the
meter, it should read close to 0 or continuity.  Then check the
resistance from the negative lead to the high voltage one.  It should
'not' read infinite or open, but show 'some' resistance on the high ohm
scale.  (whatever 'some' means?)

If no power to the coil with the key in run, I then go after the starter
relay connections on the fender by the battery.  If the colors are the
same, the green wire is the one to check.

I know my multimeter can read the pulses to the negative side of the
coil when set on volts or you can use a test light to check for pulses
when the engine is cranking over.  If no pulses think CPS or even
ignition module.

I also know my meter will read the pulses coming out of the CPS and
distributor if I back feed the probe into the plug.

One other 'gotcha' on the newer ones is the battery.  If the battery has
a bad cell, it can still crank over the engine, but it won't have enough
'volts' to fire up the computer parts.  I would recommend you put a
multimeter on the posts and read it when cranking over.  If you have
less than 10.5 V I think it is, it won't fire up.  I believe it will go
under that with a bad cell.

Let's try something simple and free. Just reseat the plug for the CPS! A
dirty connection will keep it from working. It's round and is on the left
rear of the engine. One end disappears down to the bellhousing area.

you ran a selftest on the cluster and did not comm with the pcm
you need to turn key on and off 3 times then look at the odometer  for the
p code and if there is a no buss message then replace the crank sensor
also look at the coil and wire
