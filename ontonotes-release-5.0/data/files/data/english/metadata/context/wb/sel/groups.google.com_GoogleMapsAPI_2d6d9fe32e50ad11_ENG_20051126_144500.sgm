hey folks i'm trying to add a sidebar to my page and am havnig
problems.

here is how i load my markers

while($row = mysql_fetch_array($result))
{
echo &quot;var point = new GPoint(&quot; . $row['lon'] . &quot;,&quot; . $row['lat'] .
&quot;);\n&quot;;
echo &quot;var marker = createMarker(point, 'Address: &quot;. $row['address'] .&quot;
&quot;.$row['city'].&quot;&quot;.$row['state'].&quot;&lt;br&gt;Sale Price: $&quot; .
$row['salesprice'] . &quot;&lt;br&gt;Zipcode&quot; .
$input1 . &quot;&lt;br&gt;Sqft:&quot; . $row['squarefeet'] . &quot;&lt;br&gt;Sales Date: &quot; .
$row['salesdate'] . &quot;&lt;br&gt;Year Built: &quot; . $row['yearbuilt'] .
&quot;&lt;br&gt;Bedrooms: &quot; . $row['bedrooms'] .&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot; . $homelisturl . &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot; .
$mortgagequotes . &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot; . $realtorlist . &quot;');\n&quot;;
echo &quot;map.addOverlay(marker);\n&quot;;
echo &quot;\n&quot;;
}

now i want to add a sidebar to the page so figured i'd add the
following after the last echo &quot;\n&quot;

echo &quot;var document.getElementById(&quot;sidebar&quot;).innerHTML =
(&quot;sidebar_html&quot;);\n&quot;;

BUT but i keep on getting errors saying unexpected T_STRING, expecting
',' or ';' no matter what i do. any ideas?

I would look at the quotes (especially given the error message you
report). I would expect that PHP would be as unhappy about nested
quotes as every other programming language.
You probably need to do something like:
echo &quot;var document.getElementById('sidebar').innerHTML =
('sidebar_html');\n&quot;;
(notice the change to single quotes inside the string).

like it is written in)

Larry is right - the problem has to do with the quotes, and his
technique will fix it, but another workaround is to say

echo &quot;var document.getElementById(\&quot;sidebar\&quot;).innerHTML =
(\&quot;sidebar_html\&quot;);\n&quot;;

and if you notice, I replaced all the &quot; that i want to print with \&quot;
because that way it will print a quote, not interfere with the PHP
parsing.
Hope that helps

ok guys i tried your fixes and am getting closer in that i load an
empty google maps page now (instead of that old error) but am now
getting an error saying &quot;expected ;&quot;

note i tried both of your methods using single and double quotes with
the slashes yet get the same error in both cases.

also i looked back at my original code and actually the original code
is :

document.getElementById(&quot;sidebar&quot;).innerHTML = sidebar_html;

note no parathenses around the sidebar_html although when i removed the
parantheses it still didn't matter.

so to recap, i now am using this line of code:

echo &quot;var document.getElementById(\&quot;sidebar\&quot;).innerHTML =
\&quot;sidebar_html\&quot;;\n&quot;;

and still get &quot;expected ;&quot;

any ideas?

actually i looked at the error message more carefully and realized that
it is telling me EXPECTED ; on this line:

var document.getElementById(&quot;sidebar&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;sidebar_html&quot;;

ok guys i got it, here is what works

echo &quot;document.getElementById(\&quot;sidebar\&quot;).innerHTML =
sidebar_html;\n&quot;;

thanks folks, you are amazing. without the feedback i would be banging
my head THROUGH a wall.

That is because you need to remove the var...

it should be:
document.getElementById(&quot;sidebar&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;sidebar_html&quot;;

Although, what you probably want is (assuming that you want the html
that is assigned to the variable sidebar_html to be displayed and not
the text &quot;sidebar_html&quot;):
document.getElementById(&quot;sidebar&quot;).innerHTML = sidebar_html;

which means your PHP should be:
echo &quot;document.getElementById(\&quot;sidebar\&quot;).innerHTML = sidebar_html\n&quot;;

Have you posted a link to the problem page somewhere?
