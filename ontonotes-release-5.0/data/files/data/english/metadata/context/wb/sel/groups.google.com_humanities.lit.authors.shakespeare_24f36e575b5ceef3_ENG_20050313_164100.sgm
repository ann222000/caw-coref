WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE by Edmund Malone

[The following document is one of several portraits presented in Malone's
Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of the English Stage (1800).
In addition to a general examination of the origins of theatre in England,
Malone's work includes descriptions of Shakespeare, Richard Burbage (which
Malone spells Burbadge, with the note &quot;In writing this performer's name
I have followed the spelling used by his brother, who was a witness to
his will; but the name ought rather to be written Burbidge, [as it often
formerly was,] being manifestly an abbreviation or corruption of
Borough-bridge&quot;), John Heminge, William Kempe, Henry Condell (in Malone
spelled Cundall), and others of Shakespeare's contemporaries. The document
that follows is presented in modern typography for ease in reading but
retains the original spelling, capitalization, punctuation, and italics.
In his portrait of Shakespeare, Malone begins by quoting from
a manuscript by the antiquarian and writer John Aubrey that was
discovered in the Ashmolean Museum.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

&quot;William Shakespeare's father was a butcher, and I have been told heretofore
by some of the neighbours, that when he was a boy, he exercised his father's
trade; but when he killed a calfe, he would do it in a high style, and make
a speech. This William, being inclined naturally to poetry and acting, came
to London, I guesse about 18. and was an actor at one of the playhouses, and
did act exceedingly well. Now Ben Jonson was never a good actor, but an
excellent instructor. He began early to make essays in dramatique poetry,
which at that time was very lowe, and his plays took well. He was a handsome
well shaped man; verie good company, and of a very ready, and pleasant, and
smooth witt. The humour of the constable in A Midsommer-night Dreame he
happened to take at Crendon in Bucks, (I think it was Midsommer-night that
he happened to be there;) which is the road from London to Stratford; and
there was living that constable about 1642. when I came first to Oxon. Mr.
Jos. Howe is of the parish, and knew him. Ben Jonson and he did gather
humours of men wherever they came. One time as he was at the taverne at
Stratford, Mr. Combes, an old usurer, was to be buryed; he makes then this
extemporary epitaph upon him:

'Ten in the hundred the Devill allowes,
'But Combes will have twelve, he sweares and he vowes:
'If any one aske who lies in this tomb,
'Hoh! quoth the Devill, 'tis my John o'Comb.'

&quot;He was wont to go to his native country once a yeare, I think I have
been told that he left near 3ool., [ed. note: i.e., 300 pounds]
to a sister. He understood latin pretty well; for he had been
in his younger yeares a schoolmaster in the country.&quot;

Let us now proceed to examine the several parts of this account.

The first assertion, that our poet's father was a butcher, has been thought
unworthy of credit, because &quot;not only contrary to all other tradition, but,
as it may seem, to the instrument in the heralds-office,&quot; But for my own
part, I think, this assertion, (which it should be observed is positively
affirmed on the information of his neighbours, procured probably at an early
period,) and the received account of his having been a wool-stapler, by no
means inconsistent. Dr. Farmer has illustrated a passage in Hamlet from
information derived from a person who was at once a wool-man and butcher;
and, I believe, few occupations can be named, which are more naturally
connected with each other. Mr. Rowe first mentioned the tradition that our
poet's father was a dealer in wool, and his account is corroborated by a
circumstance which I have just now learned. In one of the windows of a
building in Stratford which belonged to the Shakspeare family, are the arms
of the merchants of the staple;--Nebule, on a chief gules, a lion passant,
or; and the same arms, I am told, may be observed in the church at
Stratford, in the fret-work over the arch which covers the tomb of John de
Clopton, who was a merchant of the staple, and father of Sir Hugh Clopton,
lord-mayor of London, by whom the bridge over the Avon was built. But it
should seem from the records of Stratford that John Shakspeare, about the
year 1579. at which time his son was fifteen years old, was by no means in
affluent circumstances; and why may we not suppose that at that period he
endeavoured to support his numerous family by adding the trade of a butcher
to that of his principal business; though at a subsequent period he was
enabled, perhaps by his son's bounty, to discontinue the less respectable of
these occupations? I do not, however, think it at all probable, that a
person who had been once bailiff of Stratford should have suffered any of
his children to have been employed in the servile office of killing calves.

Mr. Aubrey proceeds to tell us, that William Shakspeare came to London and
began his theatrical career, according to his conjecture, when he was about
eighteen years old;--but as his merit as an actor is the principal object of
our present disquisition, I shall postpone my observations on this
paragraph, till the remaining part of these anecdotes has been considered.

We are next told, that &quot;he began early to make essays in dramatique poetry,
which at that time was very lowe, and his playes took well.&quot;

On these points, I imagine, there cannot be much variety of opinion. Mr.
Aubrey was undoubtedly mistaken in his conjecture, (for he gives it only as
conjecture,) that our poet came to London at eighteen; for as he had three
children born at Stratford in 1583 and 1584. it is very improbable that he
should have left his native town before the latter year. I think it most
probable that he did not come to London before the year 1586. when he was
twenty-two years old. When he produced his first play, has not been
ascertained; but if Spenser alludes to him in his Tears of the Muses,
Shakspeare must have exhibited some piece in or before 1590. at which time
he was twenty-six years old; and though many have written for the publick
before. they had attained that time of life, any theatrical performance
produced at that age, would, I think, sufficiently justify Mr. Aubrey in
saying that he began early to make essays in dramatick poetry. In a word, we
have no proof that he did not woo the dramatick Muse, even so early as in
the year 1587 or 1588. in the first of which years he was but twenty-three:
and therefore till such proof shall be produced, Mr. Aubrey's assertion
founded apparently on the information of those who lived very near the time,
is entitled to some weight.

&quot;He was a handsome well-shaped man, verie good company,
and of a very ready, and pleasant, and smooth witt.&quot;

I suppose none of my readers will find any difficulty in giving full credit
to this part of the account. Mr. Aubrey, I believe, is the only writer, who
has particularly mentioned the beauty of our poet's person; and there being
no contradictory testimony on the subject, he may here be safely relied on.
All his contemporaries who have spoken of him, concur in celebrating the
gentleness of his manners, and the readiness of his wit. &quot;As he was a happy
imitator of nature, (say his fellow comedians,) so was he a most gentle
expresser of it. His mind and hand went together; and what he thought he
uttered with that easiness, that we have scarce received from him a blot in
his papers.&quot;&quot;My gentle Shakspeare,&quot; is the compellation used to him by Ben
Jonson. &quot;He was indeed (says his old antagonist) honest, and of an open and
free nature; had an excellent fancy, brave notions, and gentle expressions;
wherein he flowed with that facility, that sometimes it was necessary he
should be stopped. Sufflaminandus erat, as Augstus said of Haterius.&quot;
So also in his verses on our poet:

&quot;----Look how the father's face
&quot;Lives in his issue, even so the race
&quot;Of Shakspeare's mind and manners brightly shines
&quot;In his well-torned and true-filed lines.&quot;

In like manner he is represented by Spenser (if in The Tears of the Muses he
is alluded to, which, it must be acknowledged, is extremely probable,) under
the endearing description of &quot;our pleasant Willy,&quot; and &quot;that same gentle
spirit, from whose pen flow copious streams of honey and nectar.&quot; In a
subsequent page I shall have occasion to quote another of his
contemporaries, who is equally lavish in praising the uprightness of his
conduct and the gentleness and civility of his demeanour. And conformable to
all these ancient testimonies is that of Mr. Rowe, who informs us, from the
traditional accounts received from his native town, that our poet's
&quot;pleasurable wit and good-nature engaged him in the acquaintance and
entitled him to the friendship of the gentlemen of his neighbourhood at
Stratford.&quot;
A man, whose manners were thus engaging, whose wit was thus ready, and
whose mind was stored with such a plenitude of ideas and such a copious
assemblage of images as his writings exhibit, could not but have been what
he is represented by Mr. Aubrey, a delightful companion.

&quot;The humour of the constable in A Midsommer-night-Dreame he happened to take
at Crendon in Bucks, (I think it was Midsomer-night that he happened to be
there:) which is the road from London to Stratford; and there was living
that constable about 1642. when I came first to Oxon. Mr. Jos. Howe is of
the parish, and knew him.&quot;

It must be acknowledged that there is here a slight mistake, there being no
such character as a constable in A Midsummer-Night's Dream. The person in
contemplation undoubtedly was DOGBERRY in Much Ado about Nothing. But this
mistake of a name does not, in my apprehension, detract in the smallest
degree from the credit of the fact itself; namely, that our poet in his
admirable character of a foolish constable had in view an individual who
lived in Crendon or Grendon, (for it is written both ways,) a town in
Buckinghamshire, about thirteen miles from Oxford. Leonard Digges, who was
Shakspeare's contemporary, has fallen into a similar errour; for in his
eulogy on our poet, he has supposed the character of MALVOLIO, which is
found in Twelfth Night, to be in Much Ado about Nothing.

As some account of the person from whom Mr. Aubrey derived this anecdote,
who was of the same college with him at Oxford, may tend to establish its
credit, I shall transcribe from Mr. Warton's preface to his Life of Sir
Thomas Pope, such notices of Mr. Josias Howe, as he has been able to
recover.

&quot;He was born at Crendon in Bucks, [about the year 1611] and elected a
scholar of Trinity College June 12. 1632. admitted a fellow, being then
bachelor of arts, May 26. 1637. By Hearne he is called a great cavalier and
loyalist, and a most ingenious man. [footnote: Rob. Glouc. GLOSS. p. 669.]
He appears to have been a general and accomplished scholar, and in polite
literature one of the ornaments of the university.--In 1644 he preached
before King Charles the First, at Christ Church cathedral, Oxford. The
sermon was printed, and in red letters, by his majesty's special
command.--Soon after 1646. he was ejected from his fellowship by the
presbyterians; and restored in 1660. He lived forty-two years, greatly
respected, after his restitution, and arriving at the age of ninety, died
fellow of the college where he constantly resided, August 28. 1701.&quot; Mr.
Thomas Howe, the father of this Mr. Josias Howe, (as I learn from Wood) was
minister of Crendon, and contemporary with Shakspeare; and from him his son
perhaps derived some information concerning our poet, which he might have
communicated to his fellow-collegian, Aubrey. The anecdote relative to the
constable of Crendon, however, does not stand on this ground, for we find
that Mr. Josias Howe personally knew him, and that he was living in 1642.

I now proceed to the remaining part of these anecdotes:

&quot;Ben Jonson and he did gather humours of men wherever they came. One time as
he was at the taverne at Stratford, Mr. Combes,
[footnote: This custom of adding an s to many names, both in speaking and
writing, was very common in the last age. Shakspeare's fellow-comedian, John
Heminge, was always called Mr. Hemings by his contemporaries, and Lord
Clarendon constantly writes Bishop Earles, instead of Bishop Earle. &quot;S (says
Camden in his Remaines, 4to. 1605.) also is joyned to most [names] now, as
Manors, Knoles, Crofts, Hilles, Combes,&quot;&amp;c.] an old usurer, was to be
buried; [footnote: Mr. Combe was buried at Stratford, July 12. 1614. The
entry in the Register of that parish confirms the observation made above;
for, though written by a clergyman, it stands thus: &quot;July 12. 1614. Mr. John
Combes, Gener.&quot;] he makes then this extemporary epitaph upon him:

'Ten in the hundred the devill allowes,
'But Combes will have twelve, he swears and he vowes:
'If any one aske,
[footnote: This appears to have been in our poet's time a common form in
writing epitaphs. In one which he wrote on Sir Thomas Stanley, which has
been given in Vol. I. p. 35. we again meet with it:

&quot;Ask, who lies here,&quot;&amp;c.
Again, in Ben Jonson's epitaph on his son:
&quot;Rest in soft peace, and ask'd, say, here doth lie
&quot;Ben Jonson his best piece of poetry.&quot; ]
who lies in this tomb,
'Hoh! quoth the devill, 'tis my John o'Combe.'

Little credit is due to Mr. Rowe's account of Shakspeare's having so
incensed that gentleman by an epitaph which he made on him in his presence,
at a tavern in Stratford, that the old gentleman never forgave him. And Mr.
Aubrey's account of this matter, which I had not then seen, fully confirms
what I suggested on the subject: for here we find, that the epitaph was made
after Combe's death. Nor is this sprightly effusion inconsistent with
Shakspeare's having lived in a certain degree of familiarity with that
gentleman; whom he might have respected for some qualities, though he
indulged himself in a sudden and playful censure of his inordinate attention
to the acquirement of wealth, at a time when that ridicule could not affect
him who was the object of it.
Mr. Steevens has justly observed, that the verses exhibited by Mr. Rowe,
contain not a jocular epitaph, but a malevolent prediction; and every reader
will, I am sure, readily agree with him, that it is extremely improbable
that Shakspeare should have poisoned the hour of confidence and friendship
by producing one of the severest censures on one of his company, and so
wantonly and publickly express his doubts concerning the salvation of one of
his fellow creatures. The foregoing more accurate statement entirely
vindicates our poet from this imputation.

These extemporary verses having, I suppose, not been set down in writing by
their author, and being inaccurately transmitted to London, appear in an
intirely different shape in Braithwaite's Remaines, and there we find them
affixed to a tomb erected by Mr. Combe in his life-time. I have already
shewn that no such tomb was erected by Mr. Combe, and therefore
Braithwaite's story is as little to be credited as Mr. Rowe's. That such
various representations should be made of verses of which the author
probably never gave a written copy, and perhaps never thought of after he
had uttered them, is not at all extraordinary. Who has not, in his own
experience, met with similar variations in the accounts of a transaction
which passed but a few months before he had occasion to examine minutely and
accurately into the real state of the fact?

In further support of Mr. Aubrey's exhibition of these verses, it may be
observed, that in his copy the first couplet is original; in Mr. Rowe's
exhibition of them it is borrowed from preceding epitaphs. In the fourth
line, Ho (not OH ho, as Mr. Rowe has it,) was in Shakspeare's age the
appropriate exclamation of ROBIN GOODFELLOW, alias PUCKE, alias HOBGOBLIN.
[See Percy's Reliques of Ancient Poetry, Vol. III. p. 202.]

Mr. Aubrey informs us lastly, that Shakspeare &quot;was wont to go to his native
country once a yeare. I thinke I have been told that he left near 3ool. to a
sister. He understood Latin pretty well, for he had been in his younger
years a schoolmaster in the country.&quot;

Many traditional anecdotes, though not perfectly accurate, contain an
adumbration of the truth. It is observable that Mr. Aubrey speaks here with
some degree of doubt;--&quot;I think I have been told,&quot; and his memory, or that
of his informer, led him into an errour with respect to the person to whom
our poet bequeathed this legacy, who, we find from his will, was his
daughter, not his sister: but though Aubrey was mistaken as to the person,
his information with respect to the amount of the legacy was perfectly
correct; for 3ool. was the precise sum which Shakspeare left to his second
daughter, Judith.

In like manner; I am strongly inclined to think that the last assertion
contains, though not the truth, yet something like it: I mean, that
Shakspeare had been employed for some time in his younger years as a teacher
in the country; though Dr. Farmer has incontestably proved, that he could
not have been a teacher of Latin. I have elsewhere suggested my opinion,
that before his coming to London he had acquired some share of legal
knowledge in the office of a petty country conveyancer, or in that of the
steward of some manerial court. It is not necessary here to repeat the
reasons on which that opinion is founded. If he began to apply to this study
at the age of eighteen, two years afterwards he might have been sufficiently
conversant with conveyances to have taught others the forms of such legal
assurances as are usually prepared by country attorneys; and perhaps spent
two or three years in this employment before he removed from Stratford to
London. Some uncertain rumour of this kind might have continued to the
middle of the last century; and by the time it reached Mr. Aubrey, his
original occupation was changed from a scrivener's to that of a
schoolmaster.

I now proceed to the more immediate object of our present inquiry;
Shakspeare's merit as an actor.

&quot;Being inclined naturally (says Mr. Aubrey) to poetry and acting, he came to
London, I guesse about 18. and was an actor at one of the playhouses, and
did act exceedingly well. Now Ben Jonson never was a good actor, but an
excellent instructor.&quot;

The first observation that I shall make on this account is, that the latter
part of it, which informs us that Ben Jonson was a bad actor, is
incontestably confirmed by one of the comedies of Decker [ed. note: Thomas
Dekker]; and therefore, though there were no other evidence, it might be
plausibly inferred that Mr. Aubrey's information concerning our poet's
powers on the stage was not less accurate. But in this instance I am not
under the necessity of resting on such an inference; for I am able to
produce the testimony of a contemporary in support of Shakspeare's
histrionick merit. In the preface to a pamphlet entitled Kinde-Hartes
Dreame, published in December 1592. the author, Henry Chettle, who was
himself a dramatick writer, and well acquainted with the principal poets and
players of the time, thus speaks of Shakspeare:

&quot;The other, [footnote: By the words The other, was meant Shakspeare.] whom
at that time I did not so much spare, as since I wish I had, for that as I
have moderated the hate of living writers, and might have used my own
discretion, (especially in such a cafe, the author [Robert Greene] being
dead,) I am as sorry as if the original fault had been my fault; because my
selfe have seene his demeanour no less civil than he EXCELLENT in the
qualitie he professes: besides, divers of worship have reported his
uprightness of dealing, which argues his honestie, and his facetious grace
in writing, that approves his art.&quot;

To those who are not conversant with the language of our old writers, it may
be proper to observe, that the words, &quot;the qualitie he professes,&quot;
particularly denote his profession as an actor. The latter part of the
paragraph indeed, in which he is praised as a good man and an elegant
writer, shews this: however, the following passage in Stephen Gosson's
Schoole of Abuse, 1579. in which the very same words occur, will put this
matter beyond a doubt. &quot;Over-lashing in apparell (says Gosson) is so common
a fault, that the verye hyerlings of some of our plaiers, which stand at the
reversion of vi s. [ed. note: i.e., six shillings] by the weeke, jet under
gentlemen's noses in sutes of silke, exercising themselves in prating on the
stage, and common scoffing when they come abrode; where they looke askance
at every man of whom the sonday before they begged an almes. I speak not
this, as though every one that professeth the qualitie, so abused him selfe;
for it is well knowen, that some of them are sober, discreet, properly
learned, honest householders, and citizens well thought on amonge their
neighbours at home, though the pride of their shadowes (I meane those
hange-byes whome they succour with stipend) cause them to bee somewhat
talked of abrode.&quot; [footnote: In the margin this cautious puritan
adds--&quot;Some players modest, if I be not deceived.&quot;]

Thus early was Shakspeare celebrated as an actor, and thus unfounded was the
information which Mr. Rowe obtained on this subject. Wright, a more diligent
enquirer, and who had better opportunities of gaining theatrical
intelligence, had said about ten years before, that he had &quot;heard our author
was a better poet than an actor;&quot; but this description, though probably
true, may still leave him a considerable portion of merit in the latter
capacity: for if the various powers and peculiar excellencies of all the
actors from his time to the present, were united in one man, it may well be
doubted, whether they would constitute a performer whose merit should
entitle him to &quot;bench by the side&quot; of Shakspeare as a poet.

A passage indeed in Lodge's Incarnate Devills of the age, 1596. has been
pointed out, as levelled at Shakspeare's performance of the Ghost in Hamlet.
But this in my apprehension is a mistake. The ridicule intended to be
conveyed by the passage in question was, I have no doubt, aimed at the actor
who performed the part of the Ghost in some miserable play which was
produced before Shakspeare commenced either actor or writer. That such a
play once existed, I have already shewn to be highly probable; and the tradi
tion transmitted by Betterton, [ed. note: Thomas Betterton] that his
performance of the Ghost in his own Hamlet was his chef d'oeuvre, adds
support to my opinion.

That Shakspeare had a perfect knowledge of his art, is proved by the
instructions which are given to the player in Hamlet, and by other passages
in his works; which in addition to what I have already stated, incline me to
think that the traditional account transmitted by Mr. Rowe, relative to his
powers on the stage, has been too hastily credited. In the celebrated scene
between Hamlet and his mother, she thus addresses him:

&quot;----Alas, how is't with you?
&quot;That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
&quot;And with the incorporeal air do hold discourse?
&quot;Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
&quot;And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
&quot;Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
&quot;Starts up, and stands on end.--Whereon do you look
&quot;Ham. On him! on him! look you, how pale he glares!
&quot;His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
&quot;Would make them capable. Do not look upon me,
&quot;Lest with this piteous action, you convert
&quot;My stern effects: then what I have to do
&quot;Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.&quot;

Can it be imagined that he would have attributed these lines to Hamlet,
unless he was confident that in his own part he could give efficacy to that
piteous action of the Ghost, which he has so forcibly described? or that the
preceding lines spoken by the Queen, and the description of a tragedian in
King Richard III. could have come from the pen of an ordinary actor?

&quot;Rich. Come, cousin, can'st thou quake and
change thy colour?
&quot;Murther thy breath in middle of a word?
&quot;And then again begin, and flop again,
&quot;As if thou wert distraught, and mad with terror?
&quot;Buck. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
&quot;Speak, and look big, and pry on every side,
&quot;Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
&quot;Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
&quot;Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
&quot;And both are ready in their offices,
&quot;At any time, to grace my stratagems.&quot;

I do not, however, believe, that our poet played parts of the first rate,
though he probably distinguished himself by whatever he performed. If the
names of the actors prefixed to Every Man in his Humour were arranged in the
same order as the persons of the drama, he must have represented Old
Knowell; and if we may give credit to an anecdote he was the Adam in his own
As you like it. Perhaps he excelled in representing old men. The following
contemptible lines written by a contemporary, about the year 1611. might
lead us to suppose that he also acted Duncan in Macbeth, and the parts of
King Henry the Fourth, and King Henry the Sixth:

&quot;To our English Terence,
Mr. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.
&quot;Some say, good Will, which I in sport do sing,
&quot;Hadst thou not play'd some kingly parts in sport,
&quot;Thou hadst been a companion for a king.
&quot;And been a king among the meaner sort.
&quot;Some others raile, but raile as they think fit,
&quot;Thou hast no railing but a raigning wit;
&quot;And honesty thou sow'st, which they do reape,
&quot;So to increase their stock which they do keepe.&quot;
