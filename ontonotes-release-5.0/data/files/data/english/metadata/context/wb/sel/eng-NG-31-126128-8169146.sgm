Hi,

Likely little new here but I thought I'd post it to see if I've missed
anything:

-first song about what is now called &quot;globalization&quot; (North Country
Blues); I got this idea from Mike Marqusee's great book &quot;Chimes of
Freedom - The Politics of Bob Dylan's Art&quot;

-popularized folk and &quot;protest&quot; or &quot;topical&quot; music, and his songs were
the basis for &quot;folk rock&quot; (e.g. Byrds' many covers)

-&quot;country rock&quot; (Nashville Skyline)

-first rock double LP (Blonde on Blonde)

-his long songs with complex and intelligent lyrics may be seen as
influential on &quot;art rock&quot; or &quot;progressive rock&quot; bands such as Genesis,
even Roxy Music (several Ferry covers) and 60s-70s psychedelic rock
bands (e.g. Dylan's influence on Hendrix) such as Pink Floyd

-from this last point, the first rock artist to incorporate
surrealism; e.g. Visions of Johanna - was it Joan Baez who called him
the Dadaist?

-and of course, first rock artist with &quot;bed head&quot; hairstyle (Albert
Einstein was first celebrity)

Later,
Joe

no.

i'm just saying that a lot of the songs just sound intelligent. it's a
lot of original imagery, but it's not all that meaningful, unless you
count me into the picture, haha.  or take drugs, like he did...

no, but seriously, like, you know, as someone once pointed out, what's

absolutely not!

which is why i said no.

i wasn't disputing it.

now that you point this out, well then, i totally agree with you. i
just wasn't sure where you were coming from with this whole
&quot;intelligent&quot; thing. which is why i put it in quotes.

btw, i think his voice really adds to the sense of intelligence.

i mean, listen to the byrds sing Tambourine Man, and you know what I'm
talking about.

i'd like to qualify my answer. it has to have meaning, but what kind
of meaning, that's the question. seriously, that's why I put
intelligent in quotes. To me, there was no need to analzye songs. They
were what they were.

However, when I became hypomanic, worlds of meaning were revealed to
me, not just in my head, but talking about them, intelligently, for
hours upon end to my mother, for example.

his lyrics and voice and music all showcase his creative genius, and
that includes his voice, of course.

i hate talking like this.

(unless i'm manic. i feel soooo stupid talking about bob dylan)

this happened to me once in college.

we were in the dorm master's apartment, i was standing in a group, and
Oh Mercy came up (not that they knew, but it was like all my dormmates
knew about me and dylan, and like they would give me the articles from
the paper, cut it out for me, and give it to me. one even cut out a
picture, and wrote &quot;Enjoy&quot; on it, it was like it was almost a joke for
them.) anyway, Oh Mercy came up, and I had just seen this article in
the paper, and the guy quoted a line, having to do with wisdom is
thrown in a jail, and I heard myself mentioning this, and I literally
wanted to kill myself for hearing it come out of my mouth. it sounded
so stupid.

He's always rock - whether he's folky, country, gospel or steel drum
band.  That's what made his forays into other genres unique.  With the
exception of his first, all the 60's albums (Basement Tapes included)
were unique, and in many cases still are.  No one had made albums like
them before.  The John Wesley Harding album has one full on country
song, but the way Dylan sings it makes it different to a traditional
country song.  However, The Byrds predated I'll Be Your Baby Tonight
with The Girl With No Name which was released earlier in 1967.  Then
again, The Byrds might have heard the country influences in the
Basement Tapes while it was still fresh in the can.  I don't think
anyone can deny that Dylan made many firsts (possibly more than anyone
else) during the sixties, and the invention of country rock - and the
career of The Eagles -  is surely one of the least important.

I think he has a rock'n'roll attitude to music making, perhaps that's
why most of his styles have been dubbed ' - - -rock'.  He loved Little
Richard as a teenager, and I think that has stayed with him during his
career.  He managed to create a sound that lends itself to various pop
music forms, but I think it's hard for him to make 'standard' country,
or blues, or gospel etc etc, because he makes his own 'Dylanesque'
version of them

No-one &quot;invented&quot; country rock, because rock came from rock'n'roll
which itself came partly from country music. Both Elvis and the Everly
Bros, first generation rock and roll stars, had roots in country
music. Dylan was the first of the second generation, who had grown up
listening to rock and roll, to record in Nashville. He was undoubtedly
a rock star when he made Blonde On Blonde there. He was never a rock
and roll star, that was the first generation. There was nothing
country about Blonde On Blonde, and Nashville Skyline was in the
frontline of country albums made by second generation rockers, if not
the first.

I think 'Country Rock', being a sub genre of rock music, would have to
have appeared after it - despite being influenced by rock'n'roll and
it's country roots.  My suggestion for the first country-rock record
is Gene Clark &amp; The Godsin Brothers, recorded in 1966.  Nashville
Skyline wasn't the first country record by a rock musician, but it
might have been the most shocking change of style for a major artist
at the time.  Sweetheart Of The Rodeo is full on country rock, but The
Byrds had already dipped a toe or two into country music before then.

&gt; Skyline wasn't the first country record by a rock musician, but it
&gt; might have been the most shocking change of style for a major artist
&gt; at the time.  Sweetheart Of The Rodeo is full on country rock, but The
&gt; Byrds had already dipped a toe or two into country music before then.

A very useful book which untangles the whole mess is Are You Ready For

Nashville Skyline is easy listening.  There's more rock 'n' roll attitude on
his first album than on Nashville Skyline.  But Dylan wasn't considered a
rock musician until he went electric, and very little of his pre-electric
music was dubbed &quot;folk rock.&quot;

Yes of course, the term &quot;folk rock&quot; wasn't even coined until after his
first albums had been released.  But as you say, there's still a
rock'n'roll attitude on the early records

yes, it does - actually useful is a really horrible adjective - it's a
great book, informative, highly readable, well-researched, without any

Martin, *powerful album* as much as you like; but if NS is not easy
listenign, what is it?

Wonderful (powerful, ok) easy listenign, but still easy listening it is.

I'd be happy not to categorize it, partly because I can't think of an
adequate category, and partly because Dylan albums belong in the
category 'Dylan'.  How would you categorize Desire, or Planet Waves?
Nashville Skyline is a perfect entity - the songs, the playing and the
production - it's like a mini drama.  There are references to
darkness, suspicion, lust, and humour, and is performed with subtlety
and style.  The sound of the album perfectly matches these moods and
themes.  At the risk of sounding prescriptive, I think anyone who
doesn't hear the drama in Nashville Skyline is missing something

Before Dylan &quot;went electric&quot; there was no such thing as &quot;rock music&quot; -
there was rock'n'roll, pop, blues, rhythm'n'blues, rockabilly, folk
and country and western, etc. The Beatles were called a pop group or a
beat group. The term 'rock music' was only coined after the second
generation of artists who had grown up listening to all of these began
playing music which incorporated elements from some of the other
genres with rock'n'roll. I wonder if the Oxford Dictionary people have
narrowed down who actually used the term 'rock music' first? Whether
Nashville Skyline is considered easy listening or not is beside the
point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Do you mean at the time it was released or later?

First time I recall hearing the term &quot;folk rock&quot; was when The Byrds
came out with their pop version of one of his pre-electric songs, Mr
Tambourine Man. For a while there the term seemed to almost
exclusively be used of pop versions of Dylan songs, like The Turtles
and their It Ain't Me, Babe and Cher with All I Really Want To Do,
then it was used for the obvious Dylan imitators and bandwagon-
jumpers, like Sonny and Cher and Barry McGuire.

I would consider &quot;Farewell Angelina&quot; to also be surrealistic, although
it is a shorter, less complex lyric. It dates from one year earlier
than Visions of Johanna.

Mmmm.....I don't know.....I have the same tendency.......in my DBs Dylan
records are under the heading *Dylan* :-))) but I must admit it's a fanlike
thing.
Dylan is folk rock, maybe country rock sometimes, plain rock other
times......he has changed mood, atmospheres and *genre* many times,yes
(leass than Niel Young, though) but this does not mean he's not
*categorizable*, in my opinion.
Unless you mean categorize the whole bulk of his work under a unique
heading, which would actually become impossible.
But this would be virtually impossible for many more artists, then.

How would you categorize Desire,

Folk rock, definitely

or Planet Waves?

Country-Folk Rock 75%, Rock 25%

Do you mind if I help you out a little on this one, Bep?  I think
you're trying to say that in the category of Bob Dylan firsts, another
one of his firsts would be Power Easy Listening.

P.S.  Give my regards to La Scala.
