I've always wondered this and never thought to ask any of you lampworker
before... at least if I did, I can't remember in my old age.  lol

Once you make a bead and anneal it and then you look at it and decide that
it could really use something else to embellish it to make it look better,
can you have a "do-over" on it?   Like heat it up again and add more glass
to the bead?   Or does it run into danger of cracking the second time
around?

No reason... just wondering.    :))))

hugs,
Linda

You can put it in the kiln and heat it back up and then take it to the flame
from there.  You have to be pretty careful and it's kind of a pain, but it
can be done.

Theoretically you could - but realisticly - difficult.
and more so if it is boro than if it is soft glass.
Problem is - once you have the bead off the mandrel - there is no
way to re-attach it - so it's difficult to work with it in the flame
(it
would spin on a mandrel - and holding with tweezers or
some other device may be difficult.)

I have reheated and repaired boro stuff - it has a higher
tolerance than softglass.  However,
if using striking colors -you risk unexpected color changes too...
I've tried to do some softglass beads - but every one
I ever tried (even with the slow reheat in the kiln)
resulted in disaster....

What she said.  :)

Personally, for me it would be easier just to make another bead that's
similar to the first one, with the changes I want. Reheating is a serious
PITA.  :)

&gt;This is one area where fused glass has an advantage over lampwork.  You can re-fuse pieces by adding more glass until you get the effect you are seeking.  You need to be careful not to overdo it sometimes, and each time you fire a piece, the channel or bead hole shrinks a little, so you need to replace the fiber paper which prevents the glass from sealing over, and to adjust your firing schedule. Glass which has already been fired melts at a faster temperature than unfired glass.

Thanks to everyone who answered me.   I guess that's how orphans come to be,
eh?   :)))
