If you were cutting the opening scene in Total Recall,
and you had Sharon Stone in bed in Victoria's Secret
Lingerie would you ...

A. Act like Gray Davis and talk about promoting gay marriage, or

B. Give Sharon a little kiss and play around a bit ?

Traditional democrates, A.

All others B.

...

Anyone going to pass on her movies now that she's stabbed him
in the back?

Um, it's a movie.

The recall isn't. Actors are not needed.

Preference for amateurs is a temporary state when times get bad. Times are
bad, so it must be the pros' fault. Get rid of them and replace them with
amateurs.

But it always goes back the other way. The pendulum swings. Pity the fool
who forgets that it always swings back.

Adams, Andrew Jackson, Dwight David Eisenhower, Ronald Wilson Reagan,

If experience was so important, then why did Gray Davis
approve a law that gives drivers licenses to people who aren't
even residents of the state of California?

If you go to the California state web site and actually
review the bill you'll see that the licensing fees the Mexicans
will pay don't even cover the cost of providing the licenses.

So we are running this big budget deficit and Davis approves another
law making making the budget worse.

Here is another example of Desparate Deep Th Davis ignoring the
buget deficit....

The assembly passed a bill making it so that Mexican nationals
who were deported to Mexico in 1930 can sue and get reparations.

The bill is expected to become law which will go into effect
unless Davis vetos it.

Naturally there will be a multi million dollar or billion dollar
settelment. And who will pay the bill? California taxpayers.
Davis doesn't even care enough about the state's liabilities
to veto this, so apparently he doesn't really think the California
budget deficit is serious.

It's pandering at it worst.

....

Another thing California is going to give a practically free
Community College education to every Mexican who comes here
and hangs around for five years?

So now there won't be any funds to improve higher education for US
citizens. So employers continue to lobby and hire H1Bs and L1s
ant do ignore US citizens.

Even today immigrants from India laugh at how bad our higher
education system is compared to theirs. (Kids start programming
in India in sixth grade.)

These are just a few of Gray's terrible decisions and ignorance
of the world's labor market.

====

If Gray can't understand that a guy could have some
fun and maybe liven up a movie set when laying in bed beside Sharon
Stone in Lingerie, then he's obviously a heterophobe. He proabably
needs an enima.

&gt; settelment. And who will pay the bill? California taxpayers.
&gt; Davis doesn't even care enough about the state's liabilities
&gt; to veto this, so apparently he doesn't really think the California
&gt; budget deficit is serious.

&gt; It's pandering at it worst.

&gt; ....

&gt; Another thing California is going to give a practically free
&gt; Community College education to every Mexican who comes here
&gt; and hangs around for five years?

&gt; So now there won't be any funds to improve higher education for US
&gt; citizens. So employers continue to lobby and hire H1Bs and L1s
&gt; ant do ignore US citizens.

&gt; Even today immigrants from India laugh at how bad our higher
&gt; education system is compared to theirs. (Kids start programming
&gt; in India in sixth grade.)

&gt; These are just a few of Gray's terrible decisions and ignorance
&gt; of the world's labor market.

&gt; ====

&gt; If Gray can't understand that a guy could have some
&gt; fun and maybe liven up a movie set when laying in bed beside Sharon
&gt; Stone in Lingerie, then he's obviously a heterophobe. He proabably
&gt; needs an enima.

"/> They didn't practice what they considered.

Government is a job like any job. It takes particular skills. People bitch
about how politicians always pretend to like everyone and are always
friendly, even when they aren't. But that's necessary to get anything done.
You can't yell and scream and name call (like we do here) one day and ask
someone to support your bill or initiative the next day. The ability to do
that is part character and part learned skills.

We don't ask butchers to do open heart surgery just because they're good at
cutting meat. If we get arrested, we don't ask our cousin who's read all of
F. Lee Bailey's books and watched most of the OJ trial.

Most legislators are not lawyers because they're both slimy bastards, it's
because legislator create laws. Many governmental executives were
legislators because they have to get laws passed to get their programs
moving.

I'm not saying an amateur can't do the job, I'm saying that, no matter how
smart and good and motivated they are, they have to learn. Everyone on a new
job has to learn, even someone with experience. The less they have to learn,
the faster they can get to fixing our problems, not training themselves.

&gt;&gt;and our credit rating has gone down.

&gt; Davis again.

"/> Wrong. It happened when the recall was certified.

From  http://www.cdfa.net/cdfa/press.nsf/pages/842

California's move to subject Gov. Gray Davis to a recall election weakened a
key Wall Street analyst's already wavering faith in the state's credit, and
helped prompt a rating cut that will cost state taxpayers $34 million
immediately and as much as $1 billion eventually.

The recall petition was certified Wednesday. On Thursday, Standard &amp; Poor's
Rating Service lowered to BBB from A its rating of $26.8 billion of bonds
that the state has promised to repay with money collected from taxpayers and
held in the general fund.

That knocked the state's basic credit rating down three rungs on S&amp;P's
rating ladder, and left California's credit two steps above BBB-, the last
rung above junk status. It also equaled the lowest grade ever assigned to
any state by S&amp;P.

The $34 million cash hit came in the form of added insurance premiums on $11
billion of revenue anticipation securities sold in June to keep cash in
state coffers, according to Sandy Harrison, a spokesman for state Controller
Steve Westly.

The cut will also add as much as $1 billion to the cost of issuing $24.1
billion in bonds that have been authorized but not yet sold to investors,
said state Treasurer Phil Angelides.

Thursday's downgrade followed a warning three weeks ago that California's
credit rating could be cut, and resulted from a fiscal stalemate that &quot;has
been aggravated by the gubernatorial recall election that has now been
scheduled for Oct. 7,&quot; S&amp;P said in a release.

In an interview, Alexander Fraser, the Dallas-based S&amp;P analyst who pulled
the trigger on the downgrade, declined to characterize the recall as the
reason for his action or its timing. &quot;The downgrade is the product of the
budget process for fiscal 2004, and the inability of the Legislature to
resolve a terrific problem,&quot; he said.

But the view from the governor's office emphasized the link between the
recall and the credit punch. The downgrade &quot;perfectly illustrates why the
recall effort is bad for California,&quot; said Hilary McLean, a Davis
spokeswoman. &quot;Wall Street hates chaos.&quot;

Not our fault, said Chris Wysocki, a spokesman for Rescue California, the
organization behind the recall effort. &quot;The budget stalemate has very little
to do with the recall,&quot; he said. &quot;It has to do with a difference in spending
priorities between Davis and the Legislature's minority.&quot;

Whatever the cause, the outcome has hurt California, which now has the worst
credit of any state. Fraser said that only one state has ever seen its
credit grade fall as low as California's current BBB: Massachusetts, which
languished at that forlorn level from December 1989 until September 1992.
Louisiana's credit was a BBB+ from February 1988 until December 1990.

Fraser said that no state's credit has ever been rated junk by S&amp;P, which
assesses the risks borne by holders of bonds sold by state and local
governments to raise money for capital projects and other purposes. Those
ratings of risk -- essentially, the danger that a bond holder won't be paid
on time, or ever -- affect the interest rates that must be paid by municipal
borrowers.

The downgrade also lowers the value of California bonds now in the
portfolios of private investors. Memories of that depreciation are likely to
sour the appeal to investors of future California bond issues, including
$2.5 billion of general obligation bonds slated to be sold later this year
and another $3 billion of revenue anticipation notes slated for sale in
September.

California has some heavy lifting ahead to repair its reputation on Wall
Street. &quot;A restoration of (California's credit) rating would have to be
preceded by the structural improvement of the state budget and progress
toward elimination of out-year deficits,&quot; Fraser said.

He declined to spell out what structural reforms are needed. &quot;We really
don't feel comfortable prescribing&quot; changes, he said.

Yet the S&amp;P release cited a laundry list of structural problems in how
California does business, including its constitutional requirement that a
budget garner the votes of at least two thirds of the members in each house
of the Legislature. Other flaws that worry investors, according to S&amp;P,
include term limits, legislative boundaries that reinforce partisanship,
interest group lobbying, looming legal challenge to motor vehicle license
fees and the magnitude of the state's accumulated deficit: $38.2 billion for
a state that in its last fiscal year collected only $67.8 billion.

go away. To restore it, it was increased 300%.

Many people, including me, knew the cut was a bad idea. It was a bad idea
because we knew that the surplus would not last. We knew that when the
surplus ended, more revenue was needed, and that taxes would have to be
increased somewhere. We knew that people would bitch and moan about that,
because there are people who always bitch and moan about taxes, but also
bitch and moan when they have to stand in line at the DMV and when the

"/> Prior to the election, Governor Davis received a report on available
revenues that revealed an upcoming deficit at planned spending. While
it should have been released, he had it concealed throughout the
election:
Voters didn't get to consider crucial budgetary problems
because he withheld those problems from from the voters.

Following the election, he allowed the report to be released. This
prompted talk of a recall campaign that eventually became successful.

Further, he signed onto a budget that exceeds the state revenue.

Now, this can be called a lot of things, but fraud is about the most
accurate.

To top it all off, his plan to solve the deficit? Raise taxes. Raise
taxes on the very folks and businesses that are making less money.

I'm not sure that Davis is necessarily incompetent. He's damned good
at sticking it to California.

You don't need to be an &quot;evil Republican&quot; to manage a budget wisely.
You do need to make good decisions. Davis hasn't.

Davis and California's legislature have teamed up to create laws that
drive business away, cutting revenue sharply. Meanwhile, they've just
been increasing expenditures. Yes, other states have suffered from
national revenue loss, but not nearly so badly. If anything, as you
pointed out, California's been donating revenue to them.

This is one of the reasons for my regular complaint that the Democrats
need to dump the junk from their party. We've got one party in power
at the federal level, and that's not a good thing. In the short term,
it's appealing. But just look what happened under the same
circumstances in California. Life seemed great until everything fell
apart.

Dems need to wield the same &quot;magic&quot; over their extremists that
Republicans have been doing since late '99.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You can find everything right here:

&gt;&gt;&gt;And it breaks out what Davis is costing us, not what the legislature is
&gt;&gt;&gt;costing us, and not what we need to keep basic services going?

&gt;&gt; It details the billions he's costing us. You want more, hire an
&gt;&gt; accountant. You're a desperate little dem, now aintcha?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Business figured that out already, it's why we need the recall.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So you're saying that there is no list. How do you know there are
hundreds
&gt;&gt;&gt;of companies leaving the state?

&gt;&gt;&quot;Business figured that [Davis is out already, it's why we need the
&gt;&gt; recall.&quot; Are you stupid, or just obtusely hoping that Davis won't be
&gt;&gt; booted?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Many businesses are even scared to speak out because they don't want
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to have to worry about punitive regulations.

&gt;&gt;&gt;List those businesses.

&gt;&gt; You start providing details, then you get some. We don't need your
&gt;&gt; vote. Every citizen who's been on the streets, works in business,
&gt;&gt; negotiates contracts sees it. He's on your last day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Which means that, for the recall, it wouldn't have been downgraded.

&gt;&gt; Apparently instead of reading the report, you ignored it entirely and
&gt;&gt; came to your own conclusions. Analysts don't trust Davis. The report
&gt;&gt; you cited shows that.

&gt;&gt; But like I said,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The analysts needn't worry. We'll have a new one soon enough.

&gt; Even moderate-Left KGO did a special on businesses leaving the state
&gt; last month. Not one of the candidates denied it during the debate.
&gt; Oregon, Arizona, and Texas love California, because the big high tech
&gt; companies have been a boon of tens of billions of dollars over the
&gt; last decade, with the new fabs being built in those states instead of
&gt; the Silicon Valley. Only a fool would deny this state has been driving

"/> All I'm asking for is a list of these businesses. If &quot;Only a fool would deny

&gt; Davis and California's legislature have teamed up to create laws that

income is

"/> Yep. The fact that the recall was triggered just before Davis had
driven the state's credit rating down seems to suggest to some that
it's not his fault. Eh, okay.

But having heard the analysts worries, clearly the recall didn't
suddenly trigger their fears. They pay attention to wasteful
spending, to worried business leaders. When they found out that even
the citizens of the state don't trust the governor, that was the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I'll explain it to you: even if California weren't the largest state,
&gt; it's economy would be among the worst.

&gt; California's projected deficit as a percent of its budget, is among

&gt; Get it? No? Just read the headlines tomorrow. Then, you'll get it.
