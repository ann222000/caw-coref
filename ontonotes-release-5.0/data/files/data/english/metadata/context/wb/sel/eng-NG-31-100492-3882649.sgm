I have a 2000 Dodge Intrepid that has had quite a few problems. It has
the 2.7l engine. We finally got it running again and now it makes a
sqeeling noise we figured out it lost oil to the top since it had been
open. We reoiled and it ran fine for about 15 mins. Then sqeeling
started again but soon stopped. And it’s also knocking. Everyone seems
to be leaning to replacing the 2.7 here but I have already put more
money in it than what it’s worth. My main question is what is making
it lose lubrication.

&gt;There are hundreds of websites that address this issue.  To sum it up, the
&gt;Chrysler (Mercedes-developed) 2.7L. v-6 is a piece of JUNK!   And it is not

&gt;Do not attemp to rebuild it, have it rebuilt, or replaced with a new or used
&gt;engine.
&gt;You have three options.  After 25 years mechanical experience, including
&gt;working on many 2.7L (acting solely on customers' requests, and not by choice)
&gt;, I have concluded that these are the best options for any Chrysler with the
&gt;2.7L. 1. sell the car (running or not) IMMEDIATELY and eat your loss; 2. drop
&gt;a 3.2L or 3.5L Chrysler where the 2.7L used to live.  or 3.  Let the car sit
&gt;there.
&gt;Whatever you choose, if you do any of the above 3, you will get the desired
&gt;results.  If you still decide to replace or rebuild the 2.7L (always amazes
&gt;me why anyone would do this, probably for the same reason as to why they
&gt;decided to buy the car in the first place without doing any prior research);
&gt;it will fail again, guaranteed!

&gt;If you decide on option 2, 3.2L engines are readily available with low miles
&gt;(from accident vehicles) for around $500; any reputable mechanic should be
&gt;able to drop it in for around $500-$750.   Then you will have a car that will
&gt;be as reliable as the next (non-2.7L equipped) car on the road, with proper
&gt;maintance.

&gt;I hope this helps.  I'm sorry I don't have better news for your situation.

&gt;Here's a website, a good start among the hundreds available, that will shed
&gt;some light on this widespread problem, one that Daimler-Chrysler still denies.

Probably sludge built up inside the engine.  That engine runs HOT and it
is NECESSARY to change oil according to the SEVERE service schedule, and
highly recommended to use full synthetic oil, which is much more
resistant to sludging.

If that engine has a lot of miles on it and the oil was only changed
every 5000 miles, and you live where it gets hot, you could have sludge
in the engine.  The Chrysler 2.7L is by no means the worst engine in
this regard, either.  Engines from Volkswagen/Audi and the popular V6
and 4-cylinder engines in the Toyota Camry and the Toyota minivan are as
bad.  The Toyotas are probably worse.

My car has only 84,000 miles on it and it was also taken care of
properly.
But it has not ran since Oct. of last year because of the million
other things that have went wrong with it. And i am from MS where it
is hot so is it possible that maybe this all occurred while it was in
repair and maybe it is worth rebuilding? See I still owe one more year
plus all the money it has cost me in the past year. I hate to say it
was all for nothing.
