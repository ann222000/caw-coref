Defiance, fear and brutality as the junta turns on the people

It was a day of terror and confusion, with hundreds of monks rounded
up by military police and at least nine people killed. But still the
protests continue. Rosalind Russell reports from Rangoon

The Independent
Published: 28 September 2007

I was half a mile from the Sule pagoda when I saw the people running,
fear and panic written on their faces. Drivers were making hasty U-
turns and speeding back on the wrong side of the street. The driver of
my battered Toyota taxi refused to go any further, so I stepped out
into the hot, humid street.

Stallholders were hurriedly bundling away their vegetables, DVDs and
rails of childrens' clothes. Two boys, postcard-sellers, aged no more
than eight or nine, ran up to me, still clutching their gaudy pictures
of tourist scenes. &quot;Madam it is dangerous for you,&quot; one said, offering
to lead me away to safety.

Rounding the corner of Rangoon's main avenue, the gleaming temple can
be seen at the other end.

But we met a cloud of tear gas. Crowds were retreating, scurrying from
the golden stupa towards us, and lines of soldiers were advancing
towards them. The crackle of gunfire came then, the sound was
unmistakable. That's when I darted into a doorway, joining a group of
people watching the drama of this bloody crackdown from the sanctuary
of a five-star hotel lobby.

Shwedagon, Rangoon's famous golden pagoda, the most important Buddhist
monument in Burma, and the focus of protests since the days of British
rule, had been completely closed off from early yesterday morning.
Hearing that protesters were gathering at Sule, the city's smaller
temple, but also a traditional rallying point for militant students
and monks, I made my way there.

But now the retreating crowd was fleeing from the pagoda and the
soldiers followed them, advancing in strict, terrifying, military
formation. The rhythmic stamping of their boots on the road surface
was chilling. For 10 days Burma's monks had marched. Now the enforcers
of the brutal junta were on the march. Yesterday anti-government
protesters were not monks, but mostly young men in T-shirts and sarong-
style Burmese longyis. They looked terrified, but they also seemed
filled with rage. They would run away and then hesitate, some turning
back towards the soldiers as if considering a final charge.

Just by being out in the street they were showing extraordinary
defiance of the hated regime. Loudhailers mounted on a van warned them
to vacate the public areas or be shot within 10 minutes. &quot;Clear the
street or we will take extreme action!&quot; the voice repeated in eerie
reminders of the 1988 uprising in which thousands died. The protesters
reached an intersection where they stopped and began chanting, &quot;Give
us freedom! Give us freedom!&quot; and then a strange, almost hopeful roar
went up - a last show of defiance. Some threw bricks and stones in
frustration. Others tried to regroup at the nearby railway station
where more civilians had arrived, piling out of minibuses and vans.
Their determination and anger was evident. For anyone on that protest
yesterday was putting himself in the line of fire.

The gunshots I heard may have been the rounds that killed the Japanese
news photographer who died near the Sule pagoda. By the time of the
nightly curfew, the toll from the crackdown which began on Wednesday
was nine dead. That, at least is what the Burmese state broadcaster
was admitting.

The demonstrators had arrived at the Sule temple shortly after midday
yesterday, ordinary lay people replacing the throngs of monks who for
days had formed the backbone of protests against Burma's military
government. Overnight, the junta had launched pre-dawn raids on at
least two Buddhist monasteries in a pre-emptive effort to try to
undermine those leading the demonstrations that have rocked Rangoon.
At least 100 monks were dragged away and arrested and many were kicked
and beaten.

A monk at the Kyar Yan monastery showed reporters blood stains on the
concrete floors and said at least half of the monastery's 150 monks
were taken away. At the Moe Gaung monastery, in the north of Rangoon,
a number of monks were also reportedly seized. Myint Thein, a
spokesman for the National League for Democracy (NLD) is also believed
to have been arrested.

yesterday, it looked as if the majority of remaining monks, whose
cinnamon coloured robes have filled the streets for days, had been
penned into their quarters.

This is the worst unrest Burma has seen since 1988, but it is unclear
whether, without the religious leaders, the protesters can sustain the
momentum of their rebellion. However, the harsh treatment which was
meted out to their revered Buddhist teachers may have fuelled the pent-
up anger of many people. Thousands of civilians were on the streets
yesterday to take the place of the clergy, apparently resolved to keep
the protests going against the regime.

The demonstrators, accompanied by just eight monks, had sat down on
the street in front of the heavily guarded Sule pagoda to show respect
to their spiritual leaders. When ordered to disperse, they stayed put,
holding their ground until hundreds of soldiers charged them with
batons, meting out beatings to anyone in their path. Then came the
tear gas and shots.

downtown Rangoon and began a dangerous cat-and-mouse game with their
adversaries.

But the soldiers were in control. In dark green uniforms with red,
purple and orange scarves like scouts, they cordoned off roads and
took up positions at intersections. Plumes of smoke rose from behind
buildings and we heard the occasional burst of automatic gunfire. At
least three people were shot dead in these skirmishes.

By the curfew at dusk, everyone seemed to have melted away. The
soldiers, sent in to quell the revolt with their guns, despite
assurances to foreign diplomats by the junta yesterday that it would
&quot;show restraint&quot;, piled into their tarpaulin-covered trucks.

Monks' order

Burma's monasteries are considered hotbeds of the pro-democracy
movement but which clerics are at the vanguard of opposition to the
military regime is not yet clear. What is clear is they are young,
recently organised, increasingly outraged at their government's
treatment of its people, and that their decision to confront the junta
is a grassroots effort rather than something imposed by senior clergy.

A clue to the monks' identity came two weeks ago when - after the
authorities had manhandled some monks during an earlier protest - it
was announced an organisation called the Monks Alliance Group had been
formed.

The alliance went on to say that if the regime did not meet its four
demands - an apology to the monks, the release of all political
prisoners including Aung San Suu Kyi, a reduction in the prices of
fuel and food, and dialogue with the democracy activists - then it
would &quot;boycott&quot; the regime.

The monks were ordered: &quot;The clergy... must boycott the violent, mean,
cruel, ruthless, pitiless soldier kings.&quot;

Burma repeats the revolt of '88 - the outcome is unlikely to be any
happier
By Peter Popham in Bangkok

The Independent
Published: 28 September 2007

As the Burmese military crackdown on the monks' protests intensifies,
the parallels with the events that culminated in the massacres of 1988
are becoming starker.

The present crisis began last month when the regime raised fuel prices
by up to 50 per cent overnight, making everyday life for the
impoverished Burmese impossible. The crisis of '88 began with a
similar crass act of economic folly, when dictator General Ne Win
demonetarised high-value currency notes with equal suddenness, wiping
out the savings of millions of Burmese without compensation.

In 2007, as in 1988, visceral fury at a regime that cares nothing for
the suffering of the people it rules has mutated rapidly into a
broader expression of political exasperation. Ne Win seized power in
1962 and his so-called &quot;Burmese Way to Socialism&quot; transformed Asia's
rice basket into a country whose main goal in 1987 - one it achieved -
was to obtain &quot;least-developed nation&quot; status at the United Nations.
For the rebels, economic hardship and political frustration were two
sides of the same coin. Nineteen years on, little has changed.

The generals continue to plunder the wealth of the country for their
own profit, operating a vast underground economy based on drugs, gems,
timber and gas. None of the wealth trickles down to the ordinary
Burmese, who are still Asia's poorest of the poor. And the monks who
crucially seized the initiative in these latest protests know this in
their stomachs. To survive they depend on receiving alms from ordinary
people - who are less and less able to give. What they used to get
from four or five houses, now takes 30 to 35.

The last time round the protests went on for months almost entirely
out of the eye of the Western media, until attacks on government
property during a demonstration in March 1988 provoked a ferocious
reaction where tanks came onto the streets and around 100 civilians
were killed. Despite that, the students who led the protests refused
to be cowed and their continuing protests ushered in Burma's
hallucinatory &quot;summer of democracy&quot;, when deliverance really did
appear to be at hand. In early August, student leaders called for a
general strike, the ousting of the ruling generals, release of
political prisoners, restoration of democracy and an end to human
rights abuses: pretty much the same as what this week's protesters
demand.

They also called for another huge rally, on 8/8/88 - the day that will
go down in infamy because on that day the army turned their weapons on
the rebels in earnest, killing some 3,000 of them. The regime does not
hesitate to evoke memories of that massacre in the cause of stoking
fear and Burma has lived in the shadow of that massacre ever since.

The State Peace and Development Council, as the regime calls itself,
has bared its teeth over the last two days But this is a military
junta which in 1988 took the lives of some 10,000 protesters, 3,000 in
the awful month of September of that year alone.

That is the difference between then and now: this rebellion is still
at a tender stage. From a standing start a little over a month ago,
the protests have built rapidly to a significant head of steam. What
has happened over the past 10 days in particular, since the monks
suddenly seized the initiative, taking advantage of the generals'
superstitious reluctance to harm them, has been spectacular, and would
have been inconceivable even two months ago. But politically it
remains extremely immature.

No leaders have yet emerged, as happened repeatedly during the
tumultuous events of 1987-88. Suu Kyi's party, the National League for
Democracy, heroes of the '88 uprising and victors of the 1991 general
election, has only come out in support of the latest uprising in the
last couple of days. Its senior leaders are old men now, its young
leaders are reportedly back in jail after failing in their efforts to
start a dialogue with the regime. No concrete demands have been voiced
by monks or others, other than the obvious call for the restoration of
democracy and human rights.

For its part, the regime under General Than Shwe, who has essentially
been running the country since 1988, appears even more hermit-like and
recalcitrant than ever. Cloistered away from the turmoil in their new
jungle capital of Naypyidaw, they have given no indication of
willingness to move an inch towards reconciliation with the thousands
marching against them.

As ever, the only imperative of the regime is its own survival. For
this they require the utmost discipline and obedience of the army,
from top to bottom. One reason, now as in 1988, that troops are
believed to have been moved from the insurgent areas to Rangoon, was
to ensure that when the order came to fire on unarmed civilians - and
who knows, on Sons of Buddha too - there would be no flinching. The
battle-hardened brutes from the East can be relied on to do that.

The 1988 endgame was precipitated when soldiers began showing signs of
siding with the rebels.

No such smiling, rebellious soldiers have been seen yet. This
repetition of history may still have a long way to run. But a happy
ending seems no more likely than last time around.
