I have long been interested in the treatement of the femine in Shakespeare.
Here is a very unusual perspective; a set of images contained in a poem by
the Russian Blok, friend of Zamyatin and Gorky. Pesnya Ofelii means
'Ophelia's Song' which was set to music by Shostakovitch - who is known to
be interested in Shakespeare, lady Macbeth of Mtsensk District being first
performed in 1934. This is a simple and free translation.

The musical composition on 7 Verses by Alexander Blok was first written at
the request of Mstislav Rostropovich and first performed in 1967. This
particular Verse (Ophelia) is scored for piano and cello.

When you bade farewell to your sweet girl,
[Razluchayas's devoy miloy,]
Friend, you promised to leave me
And to keep your word
When voyaging to enemy land.
There, beyond happy Denmark,
Your shores lie in darkness...
And a wave, angry and prattling wave
[Val serditiy, govorliviy]
Washes tears from the cliff.

My dear warrior will not come back,
Clad all in silver...
In the grave will sadly stir
[V grobe tyashko vskolykhnyotsya]
His ribbon and black plume.
[Bant i chornoye pero...]

WHAT pray tell does Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk have to do with Shakespeare?

If you are interested in settings of female songs of WS, you might consider
Richard Strauss's &quot;Ophelia-Lieder,&quot; Schubert's &quot;Who is Sylvia?&quot;, the Willow
Songs from the Otello operas of Rossini and Verdi, Gertrude's aria from
Thomas' Hamlet, Philine's Je suis Titania from Thomas' Mignon, and Cole
Porter's setting of Kate's I am ashamed that women are so simple. Verdi's
setting of Lady Macbeth's opening &quot;arias&quot; and of her Sleepwalking scene
might also be germane, and Leonora's first aria from La forza del destino,
which was composed for Cordelia in Verdi's uncompleted &quot;Il re Lear.&quot;

But Lady M of M has no relevance to anything Shakespearean.

This version is interesting since it was assumed as part of the seven
verses, and so they are all of a piece.

However, before we start trading Blok anecdotes, or doing that dreadful
thing, discussing verities of translated poetry or of D.M Thomas a neighbour
once whom I failed to meet, --- I refer you to the imagery; leaving home
ground, the sea, returning to home ground! All of which are herself. I found
the central lines, and significance of that central 'wave' most interesting.

"/>

There is a happier moment in one of the later verses - My byli vmeste.... a
quite different emotion to relieve the tension of 'divorcement' which
successfully marries this melancholy beauty to an electric moment. (but I
digress)

My friend told me, to my amazement, that Shakespeare is taught in Russian
schools (high-schools) and that he liked Shakespeare (!) It is taught from
the English text accompanied by translation; a particularly Russian thing to
do to import cultural icons from elsewhere in Europe, but my friend thought
Shakey (with apologies to Neil Young) more intelligible than other
non-Russian dramas.

Yes, it may be an 'absent title' though.... Leskov's opus 29 it is 'not
nothing' though perhaps there is not anything that we might realise as
Macbeth. However Shostakovitch /at the same time/ also composed for Hamlet
(Akimov), King Lear (1940 Kozintsev), in 1942 Six Romances on Ralegh, Burns,
Shakespeare (trans Marshak and Pasternak) 63-64 film score for Hamlet,
Ophelia was 67, in 74 another film score of Lear,

Those I'd like to hear. (I love Lady M of M.)

P.S. Not surprised that Russian youths find Shakespeare more accessible than
American youth would -- they have no preconceptions about English, they'd
enjoy his spiraling imagery. (But I seem to recall that Tolstoy did NOT
think much of our Bard. Too many barbaric themes, or some such. Prissy old
fool.)

I once met a very young Dutchman who could quote Emily Dickinson and Robert
Frost, and did so, conquering my heart. I couldn't even name any Dutch
poets. How humiliating.

was with &quot;When voyaging to enemy land.&quot; The text is &quot;uyezhaya v krai

No, &quot;sh&quot; is the standard transliteration of the Russian letter

Shakespeare, particularly _Hamlet_, is very popular there, and was
even during the Soviet period. Indeed, a rather amazing cultural

the play as a quintessentially Russian work that just happened to have
been written by an Englishman. Pushkin's _Boris Godunov_ is profoundly
influenced by Shakespeare.

David, much snippage below - you see, my Russian first emerged from trying
to read chess sources, then sultry correspondance, and finally mired itself
in poetry. I am correspondent of little worth on the veritees of
translation. Thomas, who achieved brief fame as author of White Hotel lived
just down the road in Penzance Cornwall, and makes a living translating
poetry - I never met him while living there and would have been a pathetic
student in any case.

This fellow Tsypkin [1926-1982] anticipated in isolation many modern writing
themes emerging elsewhere in Europe, and struggled much with his fascination
for D. It has a particulalry fine introduction by Susan Sontag. Trans Roger
and Angela Keys. Tsypkin didn't live to see his book published.

Russian Ark is 100 minutes of continuous filming in the Hermitage - that is,
the entire movie is one shot, wandering in and out of the rooms, to
different time periods, and after some 60 minutes entering a room with some
3000 people in period costume in it - if you see it, I hope you enjoy the
enigmatic Frenchman!

&gt; Can you cite this piece by date and publication, please?
&gt; I've got his complete essays in a corner here (plus a first U.S. ed. of
&gt; 1984) and would love to look it up.

Yep will look it up for you - book is somewhere in this house which puppy
and I have helped index and organise :(
(there was 4 vol Orwell letters + essays published in US a few years ago, I
no longer have the Penguins) anyway, if can't find you current edition can
look up dates.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I once met a very young Dutchman who could quote Emily Dickinson and
&gt;&gt; Robert
&gt;&gt;&gt; Frost, and did so, conquering my heart. I couldn't even name any Dutch
&gt;&gt;&gt; poets. How humiliating.

&gt;&gt; not their genius is it? i am willing to grant Vermeer's limited palette
&gt; and
&gt;&gt; compostion and simplicity high honour,

&gt; Oh, true. I never smoked a thing in Amsterdam; I just went to the Rijks
and
&gt; stared at the Girl pouring a pitcher of milk: blissed away.

Anyone who could quote Robert Frost would conquer my heart. A friend once
took me for a walk through Frost's woods in winter, where Frost no doubt
gave some thought to paths diverging and snowy evenings, and I was conquered
for life.

Best wishes,

&gt;&gt; (But I seem to recall that Tolstoy did NOT
&gt;&gt; think much of our Bard. Too many barbaric themes, or some such. Prissy
&gt;&gt; old fool.)

&gt;&gt; our man Blair did'st for Tolstoy's famous essay, even granting that every
&gt;&gt; surface feature of the writing may be as insufficient as Tolstoy claimed,
&gt;&gt; neverthless, asked Eric, what then sustains Shakespeare in our
&gt;&gt; consciousness these 400 years?

We put that one together, and Stopping by woods, and the one about hell,
fire and ice.
And I tossed in, at his request, one or two stanzas of Emily's.
Did I add that he was tall, golden-haired, and had perhaps the most perfect
Grecian-Nordic features I have ever seen in my life?

If I'd had a fortune and a heart, I would have laid both at his feet.
