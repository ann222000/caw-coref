The pagan and evil president of Iran, the infamous Ahmadinejad, just praised
the fruit of George Bush's stand against Israel and Jews in general.
Speaking of Bush's demand that "Jews" surrender to the terrorists and create
the never before in history existent state called 'palestine', he said,
"Muslims across the world should take pride in the victory of Islamic
resistance in Lebanon, that of the popular Hamas government in Palestine and
remarkable success of Iran in various domains."  Ahmadinejad should be quite
literally praising George Bush.  You see, Bush has done something no muslim
has ever, in the history of the world, been able to do.  That is, make war
against Israel, and win.  Read the statement of Ahmadinejad, and see that
America is not only doing nothing about Iran's nukes, but is in fact
supporting him in his effort to destroy Israel.  Do you hear Ahamdinejad
thanking George Bush for his help?

1. Rescued Torah Scrolls to Star in Jerusalem Holiday Celebrations

By Hillel Fendel

Torah scrolls rescued from Ethiopia will be featured in Jerusalem
celebrations this weekend - and one of them will then be returned to the
dwindling Yemenite community in Ethiopia.

The Simchat Torah ("Rejoicing of the Law") holiday begins Friday evening,
and features particularly festive prayer services including dancing, singing
and rejoicing in the study of the Torah. On Saturday night, traditional
Hakafot Shniyot will be held - continuing the celebration of the Torah, as
if to say, "We don't want to end the spiritual highs of the holiday season
just yet." Jews outside of Israel celebrate Simchat Torah as a full-fledged
holiday on Saturday night and Sunday as well.

Hakafot Shniyot will be commemorated in cities and towns all over Israel. In
Jerusalem, celebrants will dance with two Torah scrolls that were brought to
Israel on Thursday in a daring Jewish Agency mission.

The fascinating story of the scrolls came to a head earlier this week, when
the Jewish Agency received a call for help from NACOEJ, the North American
Conference on Ethiopian Jewry.

The Torahs had been housed in the city of Gundar, in a compound that served
in the past as an Aliyah center. The center was ultimately closed, with
NACOEJ prevented from accessing it, and on Tuesday night of this week it
came officially under the auspices of other groups - including a 'Jews for
Jesus' organization. Various legal entanglements necessitated the removal of
the Torah scrolls before midnight, or else have them possibly lost forever.
With the help of the police in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, the
Jewish Agency managed to extricate them just four hours before the deadline.

Permanent residence for one of the Torah scrolls will be in an Ethiopian
synagogue damaged by Katyusha missiles during the summer war, in a Jewish
Agency absorption center in Kiryat Yam. The Torah was originally donated by
an American philanthropist.

The other Torah scroll will actually be returned to Addis Ababa after the
holiday, to the tiny Yemenite Jewish Community there that originally loaned
it to the Addis Ababa compound synagogue 100 years ago.

The Yemenite Jews in Ethiopia hailed from Aden, and were a community of
merchants that traveled with their Torah scroll from place to place, finally
ending up in Addis Ababa early in the 20th century. The community currently
numbers only five families, and when Taleb Kanzan, its head, heard with
great emotion that the scroll was in Israel, he asked that it be returned
only after the Simchat Torah holiday.

"We have other Torah scrolls," he said, "and it will be a great privilege
for us to use a Torah that was used for Hakafot in Jerusalem."

Jewish Agency Chairman Ze'ev Bielski noted that the rescue of two Torah
scrolls on the eve of Simchat Torah symbolizes the Biblical verse, "The
Torah will come forth from Zion," which is widely recited and sung on this
holiday.

In other holiday news, hundreds of Chabad-Lubavitch families will be guests
in Hevron, the City of the Patriarchs, this holiday weekend.

Lubavitch families from all over Israel will spend the Simchat Torah,
beginning Friday evening, in Hevron. They will lodge in the Jewish
Community's guest house, and will commemorate the traditional Hakafot
(dancing around, and with, the Torah scrolls) in the Machpelah Cave. Their
presence will give strength to the beleaguered but strong community,
residents say.

Thousands more people will arrive in Hevron on Saturday night for the
Hakafot Shniyot.

2. DM Peretz Accused of Threatening Outposts for Political Gain

By Hillel Fendel

Defense Minister Peretz has announced yet again that he plans to demolish
unauthorized outposts in Yesha - prompting criticism that he is merely
trying to keep Yisrael Beiteinu out of the coalition.

At issue are up to 24 outposts built throughout Judea and Samaria since
2001, including several with between a dozen and over 40 families. Though
their demolition is not specified in the government's guidelines, some
government figures say that the Road Map plan includes an Israeli commitment
to destroy them.

In actuality, however, Israel is not obligated to any of the Road Map
clauses until Palestinian terrorism and incitement cease. This is because in
May 2003, the Israeli government, under former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,
voted that a series of 14 reservations - including an end to all Palestinian
terrorism and incitement - must "be implemented in full during the
implementation phase of the Road Map."

"Full performance [of the above conditions] will be a condition for progress
between phases and for progress within phases," the May 2003 government
resolution states.

It is widely assumed that the timing of Peretz's announcement is related to
his desire to keep Yisrael Beiteinu, the right-wing party headed by Avigdor
Lieberman, out of the coalition. One of Lieberman's demands is to freeze all
outpost-removal plans.

Peretz is facing criticism within Labor as well.

"There is a great crisis in the nation," one party figure told Arutz-7's Uzi
Baruch, "in light of the IDF's failure in the war, and there is no reason at
all to open up another war front between IDF soldiers and their brothers in
Judea and Samaria. Does he want another Amona? It is unnecessary at this
point."

Amona is a Jewish community above Ofrah in southern Samaria at which
hundreds of youths were injured in clashes with police who came to destroy
nine illegally-built houses.

"If it is a question of law," the Labor figure said, "then the Defense
Minister is welcome to start implementing the law by removing the hundreds
of illegal outposts in the non-Jewish sector. When he finishes there, he
will have a green light to start enforcing the law in Judea and Samaria...
The situation allows us to change our priorities. Olmert, too, reached the
conclusion that his plan for a further withdrawal at this point is
unnecessary and dangerous."

MK Zahava Gal'on of the far-left Meretz Party attacked Peretz as well: "He
is abusing the rule of law and making cynical political use of the
unauthorized outposts. If he wants to remove them, all he has to do is give
the order. Why didn't he do it until now? It looks like he's just trying to
flex his muscles, for the purpose of his own political survival."

3. Violence Outside Jerusalem, IDF on the Offensive in Gaza

By Hillel Fendel

Hundreds of Arab youths rioted Friday morning at southern, northern
Jerusalem entrances. Leading terrorists were killed in Gaza.

Friday prayers during the holy Moslem month of Ramadan are always a
sensitive security concern for the Israel Police, and today - the third such
Friday this year - is no exception. Only those aged 40 and over are allowed
to attend prayers on the Temple Mount; in the past, only those over age 45
were permitted in.

Protesting the restrictions, hundreds of Arab youths rioted and threw rocks
at police at two northern Jerusalem entrances and one in the south. The
police arrested several rioters and dispersed the others with rubber
bullets, shock grenades and clubs - thankful that the riots were taking
place far from Jewish population centers and not in the Old City. A large
police contingent is stationed around the Temple Mount to ensure that
trouble does not develop there.

Arab Knesset Member Ahmed Tibi attacked Israel for "blatantly violating
international law and harming freedom of worship by preventing tens of
thousands of worshipers from arriving at the Al Aqsa Mosque." Israel is
known for generously providing freedom of worship to all. The Palestinian
Authority, on the other hand, has overseen the vandalism of Joseph's Tomb
and the destruction of the synagogues in Gush Katif, and generally does not
allow Jews to pray there.

Violence in Gaza continues apace. A Kassam rocket fired at Sderot Thursday
evening - the fifth of the day - hit an electric power line, leaving the
city in darkness. Power was gradually restored to the city over the next
several hours.

The Israel Air Force killed a three-man terrorist cell in its car this
morning (Friday) in northern Gaza. The IDF reported that the cell was
involved not only in previous Kassam rocket attacks, but was on its way to
another such mission when it was liquidated. Among the three was the
commander of a northern Gaza branch of the Al-Kassam Brigades, Imad
Al-Makusi, 32.

In other IDF attacks in Gaza since yesterday, a Hamas leader's home was
destroyed, killing three people, and five terrorists and a sixth person were
killed in a raid yesterday morning.

Hamas warned Israel that it would "painfully avenge" the recent deaths, and
says it has "surprises" for Israel if the IDF tries to invade Gaza. "The
enemy entangles itself when it merely infiltrates a few meters into Gaza," a
Hamas spokesman said, "so what will happen if it infiltrates into all of the
Gaza Strip?!"

Israeli officials have often responded to such threats by saying that Hamas
does not need excuses to try to attack Israel. They confirm, however, that
Hamas is arming itself at an alarming rate, with the help of smuggling
routes from Egypt.

Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, 20, was kidnapped by Hamas terrorists from the
Israeli side of the Gazan border over 3.5 months ago, and has not been heard
from since.

4. US Supplies Fatah With Arms, Rice Decries "Occupation"

By Ezra HaLevi &amp; Hana Levi Julian

The Fatah faction received a new shipment of arms Thursday as part of a
Western aid package to bolster forces loyal to Mahmoud Abbas. Secretarty
Rice promises a PLO state.

United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Wednesday America
could have no greater legacy than to have divided the Land of Israel and
established a Palestinian state to end the "humiliation of occupation." Rice
made the statements at a dinner marking the third anniversary of the
American Task Force on Palestine.

"The Palestinian people deserve a better life, a life that is rooted in
liberty, democracy, uncompromised by violence and terrorism, unburdened by
corruption and misrule and forever free of the daily humiliation of
occupation," Rice said. "I promise you my personal commitment to that goal."

"I believe there could be no greater legacy for America than to help bring
into being a Palestinian state for people who have suffered too long, have
been humiliated too long," Rice added.

"I know that sometimes, a Palestinian state living side by side in peace
with Israel must seem like a very distant dream but I know too... that there
are so many things that once seemed impossible that after they happened they
simply seemed inevitable," she said.

Rice praised Mahmoud Abbas, who is hanging onto his position as Palestinian
Authority chairman, for his moderation. Arutz-7 reported Tuesday that Abbas
dismissed demands that Fatah recognize Israel - just one day before he told
Rice that such recognition is a must.

Made-in-U.S. Arms Arrive in PA

Thousands of M-16 assault rifles, made in the U.S., were delivered to Fatah
forces in Judea and Samaria as part of the effort to strengthen Abbas in his
opposition to Hamas leader and PA Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh.

Fatah is the political party headed by the late terrorist chieftain Yasser
Arafat. The Al-Aksa Brigades terror group operates under its authority.

According to PA security sources quoted by the Middle East Newsline (MENL),
"The weapons are meant for PA forces but they end up with Fatah in the war
against Hamas." The deal, meant to increase Abu Mazen's power in the
struggle for control of the PA government, was approved by Israel.

The two factions have been fighting bitter clashes in Gaza, leading to
speculation that a civil war may ultimately hit the streets. The Hamas
terror organization is currently the majority faction in the PA after
winning January 2006 elections in a landslide victory against Fatah.

The victory at the polls, however, led to a loss at the bank; international
funding dried up as a result of the new regime. Hamas has continued to
resist international pressure to force the terror organization to officially
acknowledge Israel's right to exist, renounce violence and uphold peace
agreements signed by the previous Fatah-led PA government.

The latest efforts by Qatari officials to build a unity government of Hamas
and Fatah failed after Hamas once again insisted on maintaining its refusal
to officially recognize the Jewish State. In the wake of that failure, Abbas
again threatened to disband the current PA government and call for early
elections.

5. Ahmadinejad: Palestine is the Front Line

By Ezra HaLevi

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declared Thursday, "Palestine is the
front line of the Islamic nations in their struggle against the aggressive
superpowers."

In a chilling prelude of what a nuclear Iran could bring, Ahamdinejad also
told Hamas official Sa'eed Seeyam, "Iran has no problem transferring its
successes and experience in any field to the Hamas government."

Hamas has killed more Israelis than any other terrorist group, using suicide
bomb attacks and other means to target civilians.

Ahmadinejad praised the "victories" of Hamas and Hizbullah, saying, "Such
victories have called the fake Zionist regime to challenge inside the
occupied territory and have raised questions on the existence of this regime
throughout the world, including Europe and the US."

According to the typographical error in the official Iranian release of
Ahmadinejad's statements, "The chief executive said that reliance on Gold
Almighty [sic] and resistance are the secret to the victory of the
Palestinian nation in various fields."

Hamas official Seeyam said at the close of the meeting that all Moslems are
credited with the victory of every Islamic state, adding: "Muslims across
the world should take pride in the victory of Islamic resistance in Lebanon,
that of the popular Hamas government in Palestine and remarkable success of
Iran in various domains."

Fundamentally Freund: Weeping Willows No Longer

By Michael Freund

Today - Friday - is Hoshana Rabba, the last day of the holiday of Sukkot and
one of the most mysterious days on the Jewish calendar.

Mysterious, that is, because so few people seem to grasp its significance or
appreciate its ritual.

Take a peek into any synagogue this morning, and you will witness quite a
scene, as a line of worshippers, each one bearing the traditional Four
Species in his hands, encircles the podium seven times to recall the rite
that was performed in the Temple in Jerusalem long ago.

The solemnity of the procession quickly gives way to a spirited outburst, as
those present each take a bundle of five willows and beat them on the floor.
Leaves fly off the branches, until the sound of swatting reaches a crescendo
that fills the room.

It is, admittedly, quite a sight, not one you would ordinarily associate
with a house of worship. Grown men thrashing a bunch of twigs on the floor,
making a ruckus as well as a mess. What could this possibly have to do with
life in a modern Jewish state?

The answer, in fact, is quite a lot. For Hoshana Rabba contains within it a
message that couldn't be more timely for Israel in its current plight.

For it is on this day, according to tradition, that our fate is at last
sealed for the coming year, with the decrees issued on Yom Kippur receiving
their final Divine stamp of approval before being sent out, as it were.

Thus, even after all the fasting and prayers of the Day of Atonement, we are
still given one more chance on Hoshana Rabba, one last opportunity to
correct our mistakes and brighten our future.

Israel now stands at just such a moment. After the past several years of
Arab terrorism, which shows no signs of abating, the country must choose to
either throw up its arms in despair and flee, or stand tall and fight the
terrorists.

We need to stop running circles around ourselves until our heads are
spinning and we no longer know what to do, which is what seems to be the
case with our present Prime Minister. Earlier this year, he was declaring
that Israel would have to withdraw unilaterally from much of Judea and
Samaria, and now he says that he wants to negotiate a deal with the
terrorists. He promised to return kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit,
who was abducted by Arabs in Gaza back in July, but has essentially failed
to do so.

By choosing a particular path and sticking to it, standing firm and fighting
terror, Israel can eventually prevail. By circling the podium seven times in
the synagogue on Hoshana Rabba, and following the same route around it again
and again and again, we are reminding ourselves of just that, for only
through persistence and tenacity, and a good deal of faith, can we possibly
overcome the challenges that we face.

And while the taking of the willows which follows has deep mystical
significance to it, I would also like to think that there is a far simpler
message at work here: the Jewish people refuse to be "weeping willows" any
more.

We are here to take our fate into our own hands, and to strike away not only
the tears, but at those who cause them as well. May it happen soon, with
G-d's help.

Chag Sameach - have a happy holiday.
