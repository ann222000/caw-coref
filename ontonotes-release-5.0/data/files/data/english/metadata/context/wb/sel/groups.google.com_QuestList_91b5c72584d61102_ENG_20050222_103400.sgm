JAPANESE LANGUAGE

WHAT IS &quot;DO&quot;?

DO means &quot;path&quot;, &quot;road&quot;, or &quot;way&quot;, and implies a way of discovery or coming
to knowledge. Many Martial Arts became &quot;Do&quot; arts after the Meiji
Restoration period in order to preserve their knowledge. Civil War had
become a thing of the relative past and the Martial Arts were encouraged to
become more peaceful ways to seek relaxation of the mind and enlightenment.
&quot;Jutsu&quot; styles had more of a &quot;warfare tactics&quot; flavor to them and became
harder to promote and support after the Restoration.

MEDICAL INFORMATION

HELPING SOMEONE WHO IS HAVING A SEIZURE

If you see someone who is having a seizure, stay calm. Although seizures
seem to last a long time, they usually do not last more than 60 to 90
seconds. Time the seizure if you can. If the seizure lasts longer than 5
minutes or the person seizing is pregnant (no matter how long the seizure
lasts), call 911 or other emergency services immediately.

During the seizure

* If the seizure is just starting, try to guide the person gently to
the floor, then place something soft under his or her head to prevent head
injury. Try to move furniture or other objects that might injure the person
during the seizure.
* If the person is having a seizure and is on the ground when you
arrive, put something soft under his or her head.
* Do not try to hold the person down or restrain him or her.
* Do not force anything, including your fingers, into the person's
mouth. Putting something in his or her mouth may cause injuries such as
chipped teeth or a fractured jaw. You could also get bitten.
* Turn the person onto his or her side, with his or her mouth down,
unless he or she resists being moved.

After the seizure

* Check the person for injuries.
* If you could not turn the person onto his or her side during the
seizure, do so when the seizure ends and he or she has relaxed.
* If the person is having trouble breathing, gently clear his or her
mouth of any vomit or saliva.
* Provide a safe area where the person can rest.
* Stay with the person until he or she is awake and aware of his or
her surroundings. A person who has just had a seizure is often confused for
a short time after the seizure.
* Do not give the person anything to eat or drink until he or she is
fully awake, alert, and aware.
* Note the date, time of day, and any details about the seizure that
you can remember and get emergency assistance immediately.

ARTWORK OF THE DAY

This is a modern day rendition of a real life Ninja Hero from days of old,
Hanzo Hattori. This image is from Samurai Showdown (Capcom TM), and Hanzo
is depicted here with a sword as his primary weapon. One of the popular
legends of Hanzo Hattori or Hanzo of the Spear is that he once held a gate
against 300 plus soldiers trying to enter the castle. He guarded the gate
until his lord had successfully escaped from the besieged fortress. The
gate was commonly referred to thereafter as Hanzo-mon or simply &quot;Hanzo's
Gate&quot;. I guess after that display he proved that was pretty much the case.
You can see more pictures of this by doing a Google Search for Hanzo
Hattori. You will even find a picture of Soke portraying Hanzo in a popular
Japanese TV Series.
