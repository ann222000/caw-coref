Has Bush restored the 3 million jobs he lost yet? Paid back the debt he
piled up? With this latest revelation of the abuse of prisoners in Iraq I
am just stunned at how far the USA has sunk compared with when Clinton was
President.

&gt;Services Growth Reaches Record in April
&gt;http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=568&amp;ncid=749&amp;e=1&amp;u=/n...

&gt;By Chris Reese

&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector, which accounts for 80
&gt;percent of the economy, grew at a record pace in April, fueled by higher
&gt;employment and a jump in new orders, an industry survey showed on Wednesday.

&gt;The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index rose to
&gt;68.4 in April from 65.8 in March, above Wall Street estimates of a dip
&gt;to 64.0. A number above 50 indicates growth.

&gt;&quot;This was yet another very impressive report from ISM,&quot; said Doug
&gt;Porter, senior economist at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto.

&gt;&quot;It was strong from top to bottom with nothing to quibble about on the
&gt;growth front. The report continues to flag worries about inflation
&gt;pressures, both in the prices paid component and in the increasing order
&gt;backlogs,&quot; Porter said.

into a military quagmire because of political mismanagement of the war.
This is the most depraved point in American history and an order of
magnitude more decadent than anything that's happened under Clinton.
Those pictures of American decadence will be on the Internet forever and
will forever be the defining images of the Bush Presidency. Does Bush do
the competent thing and take immediate action? Allow immediate regular
Iraqi prison inpections by the Red Cross and UN? No, he just makes a
lame TV appearance while his Defense Secretary attends a D.C. party
as if nothing happened.

There is no doubt whatsoever Bush's latest debacle will _cause_ terrorism
in the long run. Bush's America has enraged the entire world at the very
time winning hearts and minds is crucial to winning over terrorism. Bush
is _causing_ terrorism much more often than fighting it. His entire term
of office has been an utter disaster and I am simply stunned and shocked
and awed by how low America has sunk to since Bush became President.

"/> I know someone will say 'fuck of canadian, myob' to me for this but hey,
this is a world wide web isn't it, not just a USA web? You are
absolutely right about Bush's policies leading to more animosity toward
the US from the rest of the world, and that probably will lead to more
senseless acts of violence against American targets. He has even
managed to piss off a number of Canadians over various issues (beef,
lumber, Iraq) and we're not an especially tempermental bunch up here.
If he has pissed us off imagine how PO'd the crazier fringe types in the
Middle East are! The upcoming decade will be pretty interesting. I
hope we all live through it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Tell me how &quot;he&quot; lost them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Paid back the debt he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; piled up? With this latest revelation of the abuse of prisoners in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Iraq
&gt;&gt; I

&gt;&gt;&gt; has or can sink any lower than that.

&gt;&gt; What could be lower than losing 700+ lives in a needless war?

&gt; I don't know, maybe losing 2750 lives because Clinton and his
&gt; national security team ignored several opportunities to capture
&gt; Osama bin Laden and his terrorist associates?

"/> There you go again, blaming Clinton for something that happened
on Bush's watch. I remind you that Clinton did recognize bin Laden
as a threat and that he did attempt to get the Republican House (where
spending bills originate) to support enhanced counter-terrorism funding
to go after bin Laden and his ilk. The House (Republicans) were so busy
looking into Clinton's sex life that they denied the request. When
Clinton attempted to take military action against Iraq and bin Laden,
the only thing the House (Republicans) did was accuse Clinton of trying
to divert attention away from the impending impeachment proceedings. If
you are going to blame Clinton for not taking bin Laden seriously, you
also need to blame the House Republicans for the same thing.

flow to unsecure locations outside the United States. Do you really
want your medical data being reviewed by some foreinger in a country
where they have no laws regarding confidentiality of your data? I
certainly do not.

You Bush ass kissers keep making the same mistakes over and over
again. Bush's popularity in the polls falls every week and it
will continue to slide. Why? Because economic numbers from one
of Bush's ass kissing economic organizations do not put people
to work with real jobs that pay good salaries and benefits. Bush
can spin the economic numbers all he wants, but no amount of spin
can convince the millions of unemployed and underemployed that
they are better off now than they were when Bush first took office.

What do you think jobs in the &quot;services sector&quot; are?

* People who still are jobless when unemployment benefits
run out are no longer counted by the government.

* People who are chronically unemployed and have stopped
searching for jobs are not considered unemployed in the
federal statistics.

* Anybody working a minimum wage job and unable to support
himself, let along a family, is not considered to be unemployed.

In most communities, businesses are still suffering. We've been
hearing from the government for the last two years how the economy
is on a rebound. It's not apparent to most of us.

&gt; Services Growth Reaches Record in April

&gt; By Chris Reese

&gt; NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector, which accounts for 80
&gt; percent of the economy, grew at a record pace in April, fueled by higher
&gt; employment and a jump in new orders, an industry survey showed on Wednesday.

&gt; The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index rose to
&gt; 68.4 in April from 65.8 in March, above Wall Street estimates of a dip
&gt; to 64.0. A number above 50 indicates growth.

In spades with call centers where any monkey that can

Different matter entirely with skilled diagnosis over the phone.

You wont be seeing doctors replaced by call centers any time soon.

Or nurses either.

Americans look to India for medical treatment

&quot;Americans look to India for medical treatment
IANS Saturday, May 01, 2004

NEW YORK: With spiralling cost of healthcare, Americans whose jobs
have been outsourced to India may end up going to that country to get
cheaper but high quality medical treatment.

The Wall Street Journal this week did a feature on Apollo Hospitals
Enterprises Ltd. in Hyderabad, which has treated some 60,000
foreigners over the last three years.

It tracked a Terry Salo of Victoria, in Canada's British Columbia
province, who faced an unbearably painful and long wait for hip
replacement until he decided to get the surgery done last year at
Apollo at a fraction of what it might have cost him in the US or
Europe.

&quot;People need to know that there are other options out there,&quot; said
Salo, 54, who was swinging golf clubs a month after the operation.
Not only does Apollo give billing and other services to American
insurance companies and US hospitals, it also provides actual medical
inpatient care to foreigners willing to take the chance, thus putting
paid to nay-sayers against outsourcing jobs to India.

&quot;The company has capitalised on the high cost of healthcare
administration in the US and demands of patients elsewhere, for fast,
inexpensive treatment,&quot; said the Wall Street Journal.

&quot;In seeking to provide a wide range of services at a large discount to
Western competitors, Apollo is yet another Indian company threatening
jobs in the US and other countries.

&quot;On the other hand, Apollo's relatively inexpensive medical services
have benefited patients from numerous countries&quot; -- thus creating the
dilemma in the outsourcing debate.

&quot;We're showing that a field like medicine is very much a two-way
street,&quot; Apollo founder Prathap C. Reddy, 72, told the Journal. &quot;We
can all grow from each other's strengths.&quot;

Founded in 1983, Apollo's meteoric rise is being copied by other
Indian private hospitals that are expanding to accommodate foreign
patients.

Educational institutions in India are not just turning out IT
professionals but are also producing 20,000 doctors and 30,000 nurses
a year, the Journal noted.

The prices Apollo charges for procedures are phenomenally less than
those at American hospitals ($4,000 for cardiac surgery compared to
$30,000 in the US). Analysts and the Indian government have identified
India's &quot;medical tourism&quot; as a major growth industry.

After practising in the US, Reddy returned to India in 1970 and
pledged to build a state-of-the-art medical care facility, which he
did, going public to raise funds, and attracting foreign investors.
He expanded all the time and got his four daughters involved in
managing the company. Though right now, foreign patients make up only
seven to nine percent, Reddy expects that to rise to 25 percent soon.

The company treats some poorer patients and does long-distance medical
aid to the poor in the face of criticism that its costs are too high
for the regular Indian citizen.

Apart from some free beds in the hospital, Apollo has used new
technologies to reach poorer and outlying areas and set up some 60
&quot;tele-medicine&quot; centres.&quot;

Also, some nursing home jobs can be automated:

Some of the tech startups are pursuing offshoring more eagerly than
multinational corporations:

http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_20/b3883090_mz063.htm
BW Online | May 17, 2004 | Look Who's Going Offshore

&quot;INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

Look Who's Going Offshore

Tech startups are heading overseas even more eagerly than
multinationals

Last December, Hilmi Ozguc, chief executive of Maven Networks Inc.,
began looking for venture capital to expand his 30-person startup. One
of his first moves was to e-mail James W. Breyer, managing partner at
venture firm Accel Partners, who had pocketed a hefty return on a
company Ozguc had co-founded years earlier. Breyer immediately saw
promise in Maven's software, which helps companies such as Virgin
Records distribute interactive video over the Net.

But there was a catch: Breyer thought Ozguc should be using more
developers outside the U.S. than he was planning on. While Ozguc had
been eyeing South Korea and Japan, Breyer thought he should open an
office in China, too. Ozguc agreed, and in March, Accel invested $10
million in Maven. Breyer, now a director at Maven, continues to urge
Ozguc to think about the opportunities for sending work overseas.
&quot;There is not a board meeting that goes by in which outsourcing does
not play a significant role,&quot; says Breyer.

A new trend is sweeping through Silicon Valley and other centers of
U.S. innovation. Startups, spurred by their venture investors, are
catching offshore fever, and not just a mild case -- like some big
multinationals have. While 15% of the 145 large companies recently
surveyed by Forrester Research Inc. (FORR ) say they have made
offshore a permanent part of their strategy, an informal survey of
venture capitalists suggests 20% to 25% of the companies they invest
in have a comparable commitment. The fervor has gripped some of
venture capital's biggest names. Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers,
Sevin Rosen Funds, and Norwest Ventures say at least 30% of their
companies have moved jobs overseas, and that figure is rising. &quot;The
venture guys are driving offshore as much as anyone,&quot; says Forrester
Vice-President John C. McCarthy.

AN IRRESISTIBLE PUSH. Accel's Breyer is in the movement's vanguard.
Nearly 40% of Accel's 45 investments have set up operations overseas,
according to a recent Accel survey shared with BusinessWeek. By 2005,
Breyer estimates 75% of its companies will be using offshore
resources. And its companies are sending more than just a handful of
jobs abroad: Within two to three years, Breyer says, Accel startups
should have half of their workers based overseas. &quot;If a company is not
actively investing in China or India, they need to provide a very
compelling case to board members as to why they are not,&quot; he says.

As the U.S. economy has struggled to create new jobs, giants such as
IBM (IBM ) have taken most of the heat for sending work overseas. Yet
the actions of Breyer and his venture compatriots suggest that the
changes in the economy may be more far-reaching than even some experts
have realized. If not only Big Blue but also startups such as Maven
are sending work abroad, the tech industry may not be the engine of
job growth that it has been in the past. Although the tech sector
accounts for about 5% of U.S. payrolls, or 6.5 million workers, it
generated 13% of the new jobs created from 1996 to 2001. Over the next
five years, Mark M. Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com Inc.,
expects tech to contribute 7% of the country's new jobs. &quot;Entire
occupational groups can be outsourced at the flick of a computer key,&quot;
says former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, now a professor at
Brandeis University...&quot;

Manufacturing may even cease in First World countries:

If Bush and his team were so proactive, they would have rushed to
testify under oath before the 9/11 commission, but the fact is that
they initially refused to even form the commission, then they refused
to testify, and now Bush refuses to testify under oath on the record.

The fact is that the Taliban were bought and owned by bin Laden.
The Taliban were simply the puppets of the Al Qeada. That's why
the they refused to turn bin Laden over to the western authorities.
Last I checked, the Al Qeada are still active. The family of Nick
Berg, the Pennsylvania man who was beheaded a few days ago by the
Al Qeada can certainly attest to the fact that the Al Qeada is still
an active terrorist organization.

you are going to take Clinton to task for doing nothing about bin Laden,
then it is only fair to take Bush to task for doing nothing about him.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Mayland said of April's job growth and the revised 337,000 new
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; jobs in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; March.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported front page that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 308,000 new jobs were created in March, but a second
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glance showed that 296,000 jobs were for temporary or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; part-time work. In other words, 296,000 Americans
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; wanted full-time employment and could not find it. So
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they took the closest thing they could get, temporary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and part-time employment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You dont know that last, you dont know how many of those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would have preferred a full time job if it was available.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stop holding your hands over your eyes like a 6 year-old.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do the research. The Shit Bush Economy stinks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Usual childish proclamation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush's popularity continues to decline in the polls.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Who cares ? What matters is who gets elected.

&gt;&gt; True, but if you look at the polling trends, they are following
&gt;&gt; a similar pattern to Bush's father when he ran for a second term.

&gt; Irrelevant.

"/> Ah! Good. You keep believing that. My prediction is that the polling
trends will keep going downward for Bush II. As the electrion grows
closer, polls tend to be very accurate predictors of campaign outcome
so you just keep touting the Bush line that the polls are irrelevant.
His daddy did the same thing and his daddy's apologists did that and
the result was that Bush I was sent back to Texas early. History is
well on track for repeating itself. Conservatives have a terrible
record for learning from their past mistakes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Bush is making the same mistakes his daddy made.

&gt; Drivel. His dad pulled up at the border to Iraq.

"/> Its the econmy, stupid. Iraq does not put food on the table.
Bush's polls on economic issues are falling and last i heard,
Bush's approval rating for dealing with Iraq are falling too.
So just keep &quot;hoping and praying&quot; that the national polls do not
matter, because that's the only way Bush II can win another term
in office at this point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; We'll see what happens in November, but it sure does
&gt;&gt; look to me like Bush is following in his daddy's foot steps.

&gt; Best get your eyes tested then. Even you should have
&gt; noticed that bush senior choose to NOT invade Iraq.

"/> Bush senior made no such choice. Again, you fail to understand history.
There was one reason why Bush did not remove Saddam from power after
Desert Storm. The United Nations resolved NOT to invade Iraq and take
out Saddam at that time. Bush was simply complying with a United Nations
resolution, which was to get Saddam out of Kuwait and establish the
no-fly zones over Kurdish areas of Iraq, nothing more.

A couple of years ago, some people in mcfl didn't believe that
white-collar jobs would be turned over to foreigners, either on
non-immigrant work visas or by offshore outsourcing.

The following is Paul Craig Roberts bio, which includes his credentials
in economics:

http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BIOS/cbroberts.html
PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS

&quot;Roberts Paul Craig Roberts is the John M. Olin fellow at the Institute
for Political Economy, research fellow at the Independent Institute
and senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford
University. A former editor and columnist for The Wall Street Journal,
he writes a political commentary column for Creators Syndicate. He
also writes a monthly economics column for Business Week. In 1992, he
received the Warren Brookes Award for Excellence in Journalism. In
1993, he was ranked as one of the top seven journalists by the Forbes
Media Guide.

He was distinguished fellow at the Cato Institute from 1993 to 1996.
From 1982 through 1993, he held the William E. Simon chair in
political economy at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. From 1981 to 1982, he served as assistant secretary of the
Treasury for economic policy. President Reagan and Treasury Secretary
Regan credited him with a major role in the Economic Recovery Tax Act
of 1981, and he was awarded the Treasury Department's Meritorious
Service Award for &quot;his outstanding contributions to the formulation of
United States economic policy.&quot; From 1975 to 1978, Dr. Roberts served
on the congressional staff where he drafted the Kemp-Roth bill and
played a leading role in developing bipartisan support for a
supply-side economic policy.

In 1987, the French government recognized him as &quot;the artisan of a
renewal in economic science and policy after half a century of state
interventionism&quot; and inducted him into the Legion of Honor.

One of Dr. Roberts' latest books is The New Colorline: How Quotas and
Privilege Destroy Democracy, co-authored with Lawrence Stratton and
published by Regnery in October 1995. Meltdown: Inside the Soviet
Economy, co-authored with Karen LaFollette, was published by the Cato
Institute in 1990. His book, The Supply-Side Revolution, was published
by Harvard University Press in 1984. Widely reviewed and favorably
received, the book was praised by Forbes as &quot;a timely masterpiece that
will have real impact on economic thinking in the years ahead.&quot; He is
the author of Alienation and the Soviet Economy, published in 1971 and
republished in 1990, and Marx's Theory of Exchange, Alienation, and
Crisis, published in 1973 and republished in 1983.

Roberts has held numerous academic appointments and has published many
articles in journals of scholarship, including the Journal of
Political Economy, Oxford Economic Papers, Journal of Law and
Economics, Studies in Banking and Finance, Journal of Monetary
Economics, Public Finance Quarterly, Public Choice, Classica et
Mediaevalia, Ethics, Slavic Review, Soviet Studies, Rivista Di
Politica Economica, and Zeitschrift Fur Wirtschafspolitik. He has
contributed to Commentary, The Public Interest, Harper's, The New York
Times, The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Fortune, Investor's
Business Daily, London Times, Financial Times, The Spectator, IL Sole
24 Ore, Le Figaro, Liberation and The Nihon Keizai Shimbun. He has
testified before committees of Congress on over 30 occasions.

Dr. Roberts was educated at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the
University of Virginia, the University of California at Berkeley and
Oxford University, where he was a member of Merton College.&quot;

And slick attempted to do something about bin Laden too.

Even someone as stupid as you must have noticed
what missiles got fired into Afghanistan well before
there was any attempt at a full scale invasion which
did do a quite effective job of pulling the rug out from
under the Talibums who allowed bin Laden to operate
from Afghanistan after Sudan gave him the bums rush.

Bet they aint too thrilled about the outcome they ended up with.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they took the closest thing they could get, temporary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and part-time employment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You dont know that last, you dont know how many of those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would have preferred a full time job if it was available.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stop holding your hands over your eyes like a 6 year-old.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Do the research. The Shit Bush Economy stinks.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Usual childish proclamation.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Bush's popularity continues to decline in the polls.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Who cares ? What matters is who gets elected.

&gt;&gt;&gt; True, but if you look at the polling trends, they are following
&gt;&gt;&gt; a similar pattern to Bush's father when he ran for a second term.
&gt;&gt; Irrelevant.
&gt; Ah! Good. You keep believing that.

"/> Doesnt matter what I believe, or know either.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My prediction is that the polling trends

Slick certainly benefitted from the economy election wise, but thats
an entirely separate issue to your claim about 'same mistakes'

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bush's polls on economic issues are falling and last i heard,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So just keep &quot;hoping and praying&quot; that the national
&gt; polls do not matter, because that's the only way
&gt; Bush II can win another term in office at this point.

"/> Wrong again. What actually matters is
whether Kerry can manage to convince
enough of the voters that he can do any better.

And the prez is irrelevant anyway, what actually
matters is who ends up dominating the congress.

The prez is just the front monkey.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We'll see what happens in November, but it sure does

&gt; Bush senior made no such choice.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There was one reason why Bush did not remove Saddam

"/> Not a clue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bush was simply complying with a United Nations resolution,

"/> Not a clue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There's a *HUGE* shortage of plumbers so the U.S. must grant some
H-2B non-immigrant work visas before it gets deep in, well, you
know...

The New York Times &gt; Business &gt; Your Money &gt;
Economic View: When a Job Calls and No One Answers

``When a Job Calls and No One Answers

By EDUARDO PORTER
Published: May 9, 2004

THINK it's tough finding a plumber when you need one? Ask Clinton C.
Kershaw, the owner of Mr. Rooter Plumbing in Pleasant Valley, N.Y.,
about 90 miles north of New York City. His business, fixing toilets
for $90 or septic systems for $7,000, is doing so well that its 15
plumbers are having a hard time keeping up with the work.

Mr. Kershaw is having a difficult time, too, hiring plumbers. The
company has placed ads in The Poughkeepsie Journal and in The Journal
News. It has offered $30 an hour with benefits, but to no avail. Mr.
Kershaw said he had to forgo around $2 million worth of work last year
because he didn't have enough plumbers.

So he looked abroad. His company found nine plumbers in South Africa
and one in Venezuela, then started applying for temporary work visas
for them.

Mr. Kershaw isn't the only employer with staffing problems. More than
1.5 million jobs may have been lost across the economy over the last
three years, but the job market is not slack for everyone. Last year,
American businesses filed requests with the Labor Department for
authorization to bring over foreign workers for seasonal jobs as
varied as hotel maid, tractor-trailer driver, mail clerk, welder and
baker.

The technology boom in the late 1990's focused attention on employers
importing specialized, highly skilled laborers under a visa program
known as H-1B. But for the last several years, employers have also
been trying to hire foreign seasonal workers of no particular skill
under another visa program, called H-2B, that requires the employers
to show only that they cannot find local people to do the jobs.

The employees range from $7-an-hour Mexican workers pitching tents for
traveling circuses to Japanese roe sorters, who can earn up to $7,000
a month at processing plants in Alaska. The &quot;season&quot; varies from a few
summer months, say, for workers at resorts and camps, to the
February-to-November period that is busiest for plumbers in the
Northeast.

Demand is growing. In early March, the Department of Homeland Security
announced that this year's limit of 66,000 H-2B visas had been reached
early, prompting employers to call upon friends in Congress, from both
sides of the aisle, to help. It was the first time since the seasonal
visa program began 14 years ago that the annual limit had been
reached.

At least three bills to relax the limit were submitted in the House
and Senate by the end of March. But their chances for passage this
year are not good. Despite strong bipartisan support, opposition by a
few senators is keeping legislation from coming to a floor vote,
frustrating employers like Mr. Kershaw. Not everyone buys employers'
arguments that they can't find local workers to fill jobs. Critics say
they simply want to reduce labor costs by importing foreign workers.

&quot;Every single employer in the world would like to claim there is a
labor shortage,&quot; said George J. Borjas, a professor of economics and
social policy at Harvard who has written extensively about the
drawbacks of illegal immigration.

Mr. Borjas argued that while it might take more than $30 an hour to
find qualified plumbers, eventually, at some wage, workers in the
United States would show up.

Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration
Studies, a Washington research group that favors greater restrictions
on immigration, conceded that employers like Mr. Kershaw might have
difficulty adjusting in the absence of foreign workers. But Mr.
Krikorian added that there were other possible solutions.

&quot;Maybe go to Pittsburgh rather than Johannesburg, or go into the high
schools and try to grow your own plumbers,&quot; he said.

But others say that businesses face a legitimate need.

&quot;I used to be ideologically, pragmatically, morally opposed to guest
worker programs, but I have changed my mind,&quot; said Muzaffar A.
Chishti, a senior analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a
research and advocacy group in Washington. &quot;There are large pockets of
the labor market where it is now agreed by most people that American
workers are unavailable, unwilling or untrained to do the job.&quot;

Unemployed Americans are usually looking for permanent jobs, with
benefits, so they often shun seasonal work. And while employers agree
that workers could eventually be found if the pay were high enough,
some businesses might not be viable if they paid such wages.

Moreover, labor shortages in some areas and sectors can appear even in
a dismal national job market. Unemployment in the four New York
counties in which Mr. Rooter does business - Dutchess, Putnam,
Rockland and Westchester - now averages 4.4 percent - well under the
national average of 5.6 percent.

DEMAND for plumbing and air-conditioning contractor workers has been
growing for more than two years. Mr. Kershaw bemoans how few people
train to be plumbers. He adds that high housing costs in Pleasant
Valley tend to scare plumbers away from the area.

And his company's situation shows how limiting access to foreign
workers can hurt American jobs, too. Frustrated by inaction in
Congress, Mr. Kershaw abandoned his quest to bring in the plumbers
from abroad. Instead, he fired the support staff that he had hired in
anticipation of the expanded business. &quot;I've let go of two, and I'll
probably let go of two more,&quot; he said.''

Some may challenge the plumber shortage; e.g.:

Message-ID: &lt;cbf7ac55.0405100911.7d8e3 ... @posting.google.com&gt;:

&quot;There are 103 plumbing contractors listed in Pleasant Valley, NY
( www.dexonline.com ). That doesn't sound like a shortage to me. It is
perhaps a shortage for Mr. Kershaw if he is paying less than they can
make elsewhere.
