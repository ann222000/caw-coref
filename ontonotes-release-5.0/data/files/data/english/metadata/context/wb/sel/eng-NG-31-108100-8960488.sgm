Sanchez retired from the Army last year, two years after he completing a
tumultuous year as commander of all U.S. forces in Iraq. As he stepped
down, he called his career a casualty of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.

He was never charged with anything but he was not promoted in the
aftermath of the prisoner abuse reports. He was criticized by some for
not doing more to avoid mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners.

Sanchez told the gathering that he thought he had made mistakes and said
he didn't always fully appreciate the secondary affects of actions the
military took.

He did deny reports that he and then-Iraqi administrator L. Paul Bremer
were not on speaking terms. He said they spoke every day.

The retired soldier stressed that it became clear during his command
that the mission was severely handicapped because the State Department
and other agencies were not adequately contributing to a mission that
could not be won by military force alone.
****************
He's entitled to speak his piece.  I can see why he was frustrated.
If you have responsibility to get a job done, you should have all the
necessary authority to accomplish the goals.

Too many people were (and are) trying to steer the boat.  No wonder it
ends up hitting rocks and shoals.  The Democrats in Congress were
interfering even before they had a majority, trying to sabotage success.

Scummy varmints.

While we're still in the midst of a war, Sanchez should keep his mouth

the Administration, the military, the war effort, etc., it provides
encouragement and hope to the enemy and demoralizes our troops.

He's peddling a book and needs the exposure.  Fame is fleeting.  90% of
the folks in the U.S. have already forgotten his role in Iraq.

I would have preferred he said the same words now that he said when he
was commander in Iraq but that is not the way to make more stars.  To
me, a good share of their credibility evaporates if they speak out AFTER
they have left the job and say things they wouldn't when they were on
duty.  We've had a good share of those.

That portion is true.  If you remember anything about WWII, both sides
never suffered a defeat if you listened to radio broadcasts.

Defeatist talk was not tolerated in the newspapers.  FDR tightly
controlled what was printed and said.  Positive propaganda was
everywhere.  The admiral commanding Pearl Harbor was muzzled until after
the war was over and not allowed to tell his side of the story.

&quot;When Thomas Dewey was running for president against Roosevelt in 1944
he found out about America’s ability to intercept Japan’s radio
messages, and thought this knowledge would enable him to defeat the
popular FDR. In the fall of that year, Dewey planned a series of
speeches charging FDR with foreknowledge of the attack. Ultimately,
General George Marshall, then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
persuaded Dewey not to make the speeches. Japan’s naval leaders did not
realize America had cracked their codes, and Dewey’s speeches could have
sacrificed America’s code-breaking advantage. So, Dewey said nothing,
and in November FDR was elected president for the fourth time.&quot;

&quot;Newly released naval records prove that from November 17 to 25 the
United States Navy intercepted eighty-three messages that Yamamoto sent
to his carriers. Part of the November 25 message read: “…the task force,
keeping its movements strictly secret and maintaining close guard
against submarines and aircraft, shall advance into Hawaiian waters, and
upon the very opening of hostilities shall attack the main force of the
United States fleet in Hawaii and deal it a mortal blow…”
******************
Unlike the Democrats, Dewey thought his chance to be president was of
less importance than keeping the secret.

We all know the Democrats would babble any secret they know if it would
embarrass Bush in Iraq.

What's your opinion of Pelosi pushing a resolution embarrassing the
Turks for something that happened in 1915, when we are heavily relying
on Turkey to support our efforts in Iraq?

Your answer will tell us if you care about your adopted country or not.

You folks that think no one should not criticize the Prez or our

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sanchez told the gathering that he thought he had made mistakes and said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he didn't always fully appreciate the secondary affects of actions the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; military took.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He did deny reports that he and then-Iraqi administrator L. Paul Bremer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were not on speaking terms. He said they spoke every day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The retired soldier stressed that it became clear during his command
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the mission was severely handicapped because the State Department and

Congratulations. You worked in both a bad premise And a faulty
dilemma in one swell foop - one or both of which is/are where those
of your ilk frequently go wrong in your alleged &quot;thinking&quot; processes.

The only time I was ever in a septic tank, I climbed down a ladder.
The first course of action was to determine if there was a problem in
the outflow baffle - and then to fix it before I executed my exit
strategy. Luckily, there were none of your ilk standing around to
criticize my decision, or I'd have probably thrown some wall
decorations at them.

My *First* thought was, &quot;It's HER ring, and I didn't flush it dow the

Then I had second thought, like, Wait a minute, *She* does all the cooking

One teeny little observation here, Mike.  There wasn't a ladder to begin
with.
&quot;`Action without vision is a nightmare,'' Sanchez said. ``There is no
question that America is living a nightmare with no end in sight.''

and he also reported, &quot; This enemy is more dangerous than any we have faced
in the 20th century,''  adding that a sudden withdrawal of troops from Iraq
would unleash chaos in the Middle East.&quot;

Further, there is no ladder now.

It was a &quot;cake-walk&quot;!  In something like 3-weeks the 4th largest military in

That would be either an outright lie on your part, or you don't understand
the finer points of debate over issues.  You can clear that up for me if
you've a mind to...

I've been reading this thread with some interest.  Has anybody noted that
the only apparent &quot;point&quot; of General Sanchez's speech was to blast the
administration?  The sights and sounds of liberals falling all
overthemselves and back-slapping each other that somehow Gen. Sanchez
&quot;finally got it right&quot;, is truly sad.

Leaving aside, for the moment, of whether you think him critizicing the
administration or not--or if his views are valid or not; I find it odd that
the MSM has completely managed to fool the morons that are propagating their
spew.

In the lines below, I've pasted in the words of nearly half his speech.  It
was that portion that somehow seems to have escaped the MSM's feeble notice.
Note that *they* thought these words were insignificant and not worthy of
you hearing them.  Apparently only his anti-administration views were
noteworthy...

====================================================
INFORMATION WARFARE:  What the General Really Said

October 14, 2007: On October 12th, former Iraq commander, Lieutenant General
(retired) Ricardo S. Sanchez gave a talk at a Military Reporters and Editors
luncheon in Washington D.C. The media promptly reported general Sanchez as
being critical of government strategy in running the war. No mention was
made of the first 40 percent of the 3,400 word address. This is found below.
It's an interesting omission. But considering what Sanchez said, rather
predictable. It's another example of the media reporting only what they want
to see happening, not what is actually happening. The troops constantly
complain of that, but the mass media, especially, doesn't seem to care or,
in many cases, even to be aware of what they are doing. General Sanchez
does, and was ignored for his efforts.

The Unreported Portion of the Talk

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.

Some of you may not believe this but I am glad to be here. When Sig asked me
if I would consider addressing you there was no doubt that I should come
into the lion's den. This was important because I have firmly believed since
desert shield that it is necessary for the strength of our democracy that
the military and the press corps maintain a strong, mutually respectful and
enabling relationship. This continues to be problematic for our country,
especially during times of war. One of the greatest military correspondents
of our time, Joe Galloway, made me a believer when he joined the 24th
infantry division during desert storm.

Today, I will attempt to do two things - first I will give you my assessment
of the military and press relationship and then I will provide you some
thoughts on the current state of our war effort. As all of you know I have a
wide range of relationships and experiences with our nations military
writers and editors. There are some in your ranks who I consider to be the
epitome of journalistic professionalism - Joe Galloway, Thom Shanker, Sig
Christensen, and john burns immediately come to mind. They exemplify what
America should demand of our journalists - tough reporting that relies upon
integrity, objectivity and fairness to give accurate and thorough accounts
that strengthen our freedom of the press and in turn our democracy. On the
other hand, unfortunately, I have issued ultimatums to some of you for
unscrupulous reporting that was solely focused on supporting your agenda and
preconceived notions of what our military had done. I also refused to talk
to the European stars and stripes for the last two years of my command in
Germany for their extreme bias and single minded focus on Abu Gharaib.

Let me review some of the descriptive phrases that have been used by some of
you that have made my personal interfaces with the press corps difficult:

&quot;Dictatorial and somewhat dense&quot;,

&quot;Not a strategic thought&quot;,

Liar,

&quot;Does not get it&quot; and

The most inexperienced Lieutenant General.

In some cases I have never even met you, yet you feel qualified to make
character judgments that are communicated to the world. My experience is not
unique and we can find other examples such as the treatment of secretary
brown during Katrina. This is the worst display of journalism imaginable by
those of us that are bound by a strict value system of selfless service,
honor and integrity. Almost invariably, my perception is that the
sensationalistic value of these assessments is what provided the edge that
you seek for self aggrandizement or to advance your individual quest for
getting on the front page with your stories! As I understand it, your
measure of worth is how many front page stories you have written and
unfortunately some of you will compromise your integrity and display
questionable ethics as you seek to keep America informed. This is much like
the intelligence analysts whose effectiveness was measured by the number of
intelligence reports he produced. For some, it seems that as long as you get
a front page story there is little or no regard for the &quot;collateral damage&quot;
you will cause. Personal reputations have no value and you report with total
impunity and are rarely held accountable for unethical conduct.

Given the near instantaneous ability to report actions on the ground, the
responsibility to accurately and truthfully report takes on an unprecedented
importance. The speculative and often uninformed initial reporting that
characterizes our media appears to be rapidly becoming the standard of the
industry. An Arab proverb states - &quot;four things come not back: the spoken
word, the spent arrow, the past, the neglected opportunity.&quot; once reported,
your assessments become conventional wisdom and nearly impossible to change.
Other major challenges are your willingness to be manipulated by &quot;high level
officials&quot; who leak stories and by lawyers who use hyperbole to strengthen
their arguments. Your unwillingness to accurately and prominently correct
your mistakes and your agenda driven biases contribute to this corrosive
environment. All of these challenges combined create a media environment
that does a tremendous disservice to America. Over the course of this war
tactically insignificant events have become strategic defeats for America
because of the tremendous power and impact of the media and by extension you
the journalist. In many cases the media has unjustly destroyed the
individual reputations and careers of those involved. We realize that
because of the near real time reporting environment that you face it is
difficult to report accurately. In my business one of our fundamental truths
is that &quot;the first report is always wrong.&quot; unfortunately, in your business
&quot;the first report&quot; gives Americans who rely on the snippets of CNN, if you
will, their &quot;truths&quot; and perspectives on an issue. As a corollary to this
deadline driven need to publish &quot;initial impressions or observations&quot; versus
objective facts there is an additional challenge for us who are the subject
of your reporting. When you assume that you are correct and on the moral
high ground on a story because we have not respond to questions you provided
is the ultimate arrogance and distortion of ethics. One of your highly
respected fellow journalists once told me that there are some amongst you
who &quot;feed from a pig's trough.&quot; if that is who I am dealing with then i will
never respond otherwise we will both get dirty and the pig will love it.
This does not mean that your story is accurate.

I do not believe that this is what our forefathers intended. The code of
ethics for the society of professional journalists states:

...public enlightenment is the forerunner of justice and the foundation of
democracy. The duty of the journalist is to further those ends by seeking
truth and providing a fair and comprehensive account of events and issues.
Conscientious journalists from all media and specialties strive to serve the
public with thoroughness and honesty. Professional integrity is the
cornerstone of a journalist's credibility

The basic ethics of a journalist that calls for:

1. Seeking truth,

2. Providing fair and comprehensive account of events and issues

3. Thoroughness and honesty

All are victims of the massive agenda driven competition for economic or
political supremacy. The death knell of your ethics has been enabled by your
parent organizations who have chosen to align themselves with political
agendas. What is clear to me is that you are perpetuating the corrosive
partisan politics that is destroying our country and killing our service
members who are at war.

That would probably be correct.  Ya rekon Muslims killing Muslims

Good post Dusty, but the pity of it is that there were plenty of people who
&quot;envisioned&quot; what would happen after the lid was taken off a suppressed
people.
The experience of the Soviets, the Yugoslavs and others were just a few of
the dots that should have been connected.
The British experience in Iraq after WWI was another &quot;dot&quot;.
Articles in certain magazines that were ignored because the right wing
considered those publications to be left leaning...several more &quot;dots&quot;.
No, it isn't hindsight; it was foresight that was ignored.
It was ignored because of the absolute determination by &quot;some&quot; that any
obstacles encountered could be overcome.
Pity.  And for what?  We're not even going to end up getting the oil.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your choice.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Congratulations. You worked in both a bad premise And a faulty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dilemma in one swell foop - one or both of which is/are where those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of your ilk frequently go wrong in your alleged &quot;thinking&quot; processes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The only time I was ever in a septic tank, I climbed down a ladder.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The first course of action was to determine if there was a problem in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the outflow baffle - and then to fix it before I executed my exit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;strategy. Luckily, there were none of your ilk standing around to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;criticize my decision, or I'd have probably thrown some wall
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;decorations at them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;------------------------------------

&gt;&gt;&gt;Bill, you have your head stuck in the ground like an ostrich
&gt;&gt;&gt;frequently does.

&gt;&gt;&gt;When you went into that septic tank you had an easy exit, there ain't
&gt;&gt;&gt;no easy exit out of Iraq.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now that our country has been mired in that septic tank for years it
&gt;&gt;&gt;is evident we do not have a ladder to climb out on.  It is pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt;evident that we are thrashing around in one hell of a mess.  When one
&gt;&gt;&gt;is in that kind of mess ----  with no solution in sight, it is time to
&gt;&gt;&gt;get out the best way we can and clean our selves up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Your ilk needs help getting out of the septic tank cause the ladder
&gt;&gt;&gt;you got in there on disappeared.

&gt;&gt;&gt;mike

&gt;&gt;One teeny little observation here, Mike.  There wasn't a ladder to begin
&gt;&gt;with.

&gt;You are so right LK, but the Bush cabal thought there was.

&gt;&gt;&quot;`Action without vision is a nightmare,'' Sanchez said.

&gt;And Sanchez would be correct.

&gt;&gt;``There is no question that America is living a nightmare with no end in sight.''

&gt;Again Sanchez would be correct.

&gt;&gt;and he also reported, &quot; This enemy is more dangerous than any we have faced
&gt;&gt;in the 20th century,''  adding that a sudden withdrawal of troops from Iraq
&gt;&gt;would unleash chaos in the Middle East.&quot;

&gt;That would probably be correct.  Ya rekon Muslims killing Muslims
&gt;would be a better thing than Muslims killing Americans?  I have a
&gt;pretty good idea that Muslims in that area of the world are going to
&gt;be fighting someone and as long as we are there they are fighting
&gt;Americans.  I think it is time to leave and let them shoot each other
&gt;since that appears to be what they want.

&gt;&gt;Further, there is no ladder now.

&gt;No, but there is a ride home for our troops and equipment.

&gt;mike
">

If/when that happens, I hope to hell nobody tells Iraq we're leaving.  It
would be horrible for our troops to get out and any Iraqi citizens who
helped our soldiers would be immediately executed - first.

Bush has us in so much trouble out of his own greed for oil that it will
kill people for years to come.

You must see this like I do;  Bush has made this grab for Iraqi oil out to
damn the US if we stay and damn the US if we leave.  I hope the sob rots in
hell.  But first, I would like someone to follow the money and find out
where his fake ID is hiding his stash of cash from this war.  As a Bush
family member, he is making money on the side somewhere.

&gt;&gt; I hear that's a false premise.

&gt; How so?

Short version?  It's bullshit.

Long version,

&quot;In popular mythology, the ostrich is famous for hiding its head in the
sand at the first sign of danger. The Roman writer Pliny the Elder is
noted for his descriptions of the ostrich in his Naturalis Historia,
where he describes the ostrich and the fact that it hides its head in a
bush. There have been no recorded observations of this behavior. A
common counter-argument is that a species that displayed this behavior
would not likely survive very long. The myth may have resulted from the
fact that, from a distance, when ostriches feed they appear to be
burying their head in the sand because they deliberately swallow sand
and pebbles to help grind up their food. Burying their heads in sand
will in fact suffocate the ostrich. When lying down and hiding from
predators, the birds are known to lay their head and neck flat on the
ground, making them appear as a mound of earth from a distance.

&gt;&gt; Did we just walk away from the front line in Korea and let the chips

We didn't plan on being stuck there any more than we planned for a long
period of trench warfare in Korea.  We went to Korea to kick ass and we
did, but only after we almost lost the peninsula.

Then, because of poor intel, we went all the way up to the Yalu and got
our own ass kicked.  Then it became a whole new ball game.

The moral of this story is, have some patience while the details are
worked out.  We didn't leave Korea when we suffered the biggest defeat
and longest retreat our military has ever seen.  Instead we dug in and
held on while the negotiators looked for a solution.

Always avoid decisions made while you are in a state of panic.

thank you, thank you, thank you for posting the unreported part of the

I'm trying to figure out why there is no end to the kind of simpletons that
spout this rubbish.  This war is not now nor has it ever been &quot;for oil&quot;!  It
has never been for the greed of oil either.  It's not our oil, and we're not
taking it, are we?  We have never taken any of their oil.  Not ever!  Now
why don't you either cite an example as to where we're getting it if we're
taking it from them, or StFU about that!

However, that having been said, it may well be a war &quot;about&quot; oil.  That I
can grok.  While repugnant, that may be an issue.  And, that oil was being
used to funnel money into the building of WMD's.  Yes.  Yes.  I know.  The
constant liberal mantra of that being a lie is still in their lexicon.  But,
WMD's were found...just not in the numbers and of the kind that was
expected.  OTOH; SH had an active weapons program.  It's probably just me,
but I'm all for taking preemptive action.  I think that things have gone too
far when you're reading this by the light of a mushroom cloud.

It was a constant thread of attention that many folks &quot;in-the-know&quot; thought
that most of SH's nuclear materal went to Syria (cuz he didn't keep enough
of it to be useful, and didn't like Iran all that much).  My guess is that
the Sept. 6th strike by Israel into Syria near Dayr az-Zawr was an attempt
to neutralize that potential.  Good on them!

Well, IMO, constructive criticism of the war effort should voiced
behind closed doors. I'm all for the &quot;peoples right to know&quot;, but not

Again, IMO, we're not winning for two primary reasons:

1.) We're asking the military to act as policemen (rather than the
soldiers they were trained to be) in the middle of a civil war that's
raged for millenia.

2.) We're asking the military (acting as policemen) to wage a PC &quot;war&quot;
where rules of engagement have us sacrifice US lives to spare Iraqi
civilians. I doubt Naziem or Fascism would have been stopped in the
40's if we had today's press, today's traitors, and had to fight by
today's rules of engagement.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uh oh, here comes lz
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cj

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sanchez retired from the Army last year, two years after he completing a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tumultuous year as commander of all U.S. forces in Iraq. As he stepped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; down, he called his career a casualty of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He was never charged with anything but he was not promoted in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aftermath of the prisoner abuse reports. He was criticized by some for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing more to avoid mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sanchez told the gathering that he thought he had made mistakes and said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he didn't always fully appreciate the secondary affects of actions the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; military took.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He did deny reports that he and then-Iraqi administrator L. Paul Bremer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were not on speaking terms. He said they spoke every day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The retired soldier stressed that it became clear during his command
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the mission was severely handicapped because the State Department and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other agencies were not adequately contributing to a mission that could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not be won by military force alone.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ****************
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He's entitled to speak his piece.  I can see why he was frustrated.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have responsibility to get a job done, you should have all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary authority to accomplish the goals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Too many people were (and are) trying to steer the boat.  No wonder it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ends up hitting rocks and shoals.  The Democrats in Congress were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interfering even before they had a majority, trying to sabotage success.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Scummy varmints.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LZ

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Sanchez also railed on the media during his speech, saying that many
&gt;&gt;&gt;people
&gt;&gt;&gt;covering the war have political agendas and little concern about
&gt;&gt;&gt;collateral
&gt;&gt;&gt;damage when their stories are wrong.  These members of the media are doing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;a tremendous disservice to America,&quot; he said.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;As I read the story...all I see is truth.  Not a political agenda against
&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush...just plain old truth.  Many viewers don't recognize it, so they
&gt;&gt;&gt;assume it's bashing those they oppose.  LOL

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nate

&gt;&gt; While we're still in the midst of a war, Sanchez should keep his mouth
&gt;&gt; shut. Every time a prominent American or the media speaks out against

That is something we will have to disagree on.  I think that public
opposition is a patriotic thing to do when a policy or law is not the
right thing to do.

At one time it was the decision of those in power that women couldn't
vote.  That changed because people spoke out.

At one time Blacks couldn't vote.  That changed because people spoke
out.

At one time the population of Germany did NOT speak out, instead they
got behind Hitler and did his bidding.  That is what happens when
people do not speak out in opposition.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sour grapes?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; http://tinyurl.com/2hepxn

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uh oh, here comes lz
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cj

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sanchez retired from the Army last year, two years after he completing a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tumultuous year as commander of all U.S. forces in Iraq. As he stepped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; down, he called his career a casualty of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He was never charged with anything but he was not promoted in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aftermath of the prisoner abuse reports. He was criticized by some for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing more to avoid mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sanchez told the gathering that he thought he had made mistakes and said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he didn't always fully appreciate the secondary affects of actions the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; military took.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He did deny reports that he and then-Iraqi administrator L. Paul Bremer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were not on speaking terms. He said they spoke every day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The retired soldier stressed that it became clear during his command
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the mission was severely handicapped because the State Department and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other agencies were not adequately contributing to a mission that could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not be won by military force alone.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ****************
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He's entitled to speak his piece.  I can see why he was frustrated.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have responsibility to get a job done, you should have all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary authority to accomplish the goals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Too many people were (and are) trying to steer the boat.  No wonder it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ends up hitting rocks and shoals.  The Democrats in Congress were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interfering even before they had a majority, trying to sabotage success.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Scummy varmints.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LZ

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Sanchez also railed on the media during his speech, saying that many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;covering the war have political agendas and little concern about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;collateral
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;damage when their stories are wrong.  These members of the media are doing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;a tremendous disservice to America,&quot; he said.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As I read the story...all I see is truth.  Not a political agenda against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush...just plain old truth.  Many viewers don't recognize it, so they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;assume it's bashing those they oppose.  LOL

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nate

&gt;&gt;&gt; While we're still in the midst of a war, Sanchez should keep his mouth
&gt;&gt;&gt; shut. Every time a prominent American or the media speaks out against
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Administration, the military, the war effort, etc., it provides
&gt;&gt;&gt; encouragement and hope to the enemy and demoralizes our troops.

needs to do?

At one time, we had a patriotic population, now it is much less so.
Thanks to liberals, feminists, unassimilated immigrants, Muslims, MSM,
people like George Soros, etc. people who are speaking out in
opposition are not doing so because of constructive criticism or
legitimate dissent or any patriotic reason. With some exceptions,
they're doing it for purely self-serving, often political reasons -
NOT the good of the country. Some are deliberately trying to weaken

Not really. A stable middle-east with governments not trying to

with that, where's your outrage about us being in Germany 60+ years
after the end of WW2.

That's the attitude and patriotism which is need to win in Iraq.
Dissent certainly can be good for the country, but not in the middle
of a war that's not going well. That can only serve to provide comfort
to the enemy and demoralize our military. Those who try to claim to be
patriotic while bashing Bush and the military in wartime are among the
most despicable, and our Democratic Congress lead by Reid and Pelosi
are the worst.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sanchez retired from the Army last year, two years after he completing a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tumultuous year as commander of all U.S. forces in Iraq. As he stepped
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; down, he called his career a casualty of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He was never charged with anything but he was not promoted in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; aftermath of the prisoner abuse reports. He was criticized by some for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; doing more to avoid mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sanchez told the gathering that he thought he had made mistakes and said
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; he didn't always fully appreciate the secondary affects of actions the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; military took.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He did deny reports that he and then-Iraqi administrator L. Paul Bremer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; were not on speaking terms. He said they spoke every day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The retired soldier stressed that it became clear during his command
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the mission was severely handicapped because the State Department and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other agencies were not adequately contributing to a mission that could
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not be won by military force alone.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ****************
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He's entitled to speak his piece.  I can see why he was frustrated.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you have responsibility to get a job done, you should have all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary authority to accomplish the goals.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Too many people were (and are) trying to steer the boat.  No wonder it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ends up hitting rocks and shoals.  The Democrats in Congress were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interfering even before they had a majority, trying to sabotage success.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Scummy varmints.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LZ

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Sanchez also railed on the media during his speech, saying that many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;covering the war have political agendas and little concern about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;collateral
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;damage when their stories are wrong.  These members of the media are doing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;a tremendous disservice to America,&quot; he said.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As I read the story...all I see is truth.  Not a political agenda against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bush...just plain old truth.  Many viewers don't recognize it, so they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;assume it's bashing those they oppose.  LOL

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nate

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; While we're still in the midst of a war, Sanchez should keep his mouth
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shut. Every time a prominent American or the media speaks out against
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the Administration, the military, the war effort, etc., it provides
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; encouragement and hope to the enemy and demoralizes our troops.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Omigod, another one.  How simple can you get.
&gt;&gt;&gt;Our troops know what a screwed up operation the whole Iraq fiasco is.  They
&gt;&gt;&gt;operate on the basis of ,&quot;It's a job that has to be done and that's what we
&gt;&gt;&gt;signed on for.&quot;

&gt;&gt;In fact, most believe they are fighting for a worthy cause. I cringe
&gt;&gt;every time I hear a politician say &quot;there's no military solution&quot; in
&gt;&gt;Iraq.

&gt;The military has done everything ask of them in Iraq short of killing
&gt;the entire population.  Exactly what more do you think the military
&gt;needs to do?
">

I would like to see rules of engagement that protect American lives -
even if it means the loss of more Iraqi civilian lives. Our military
are handcuffed when they are shot at by men hiding behind women and
children, or from within mosques or other so called holy places, from
schools, during Ramadan, etc.  They need to be able to return fire or
call in air strikes. If we had set the precedent early on and said
screw

&gt;&gt;I wonder what Patton would have said if someone told him there
&gt;&gt;was no military solution to WW2. I wonder how we'd have fared if FDR
&gt;&gt;and Congress tried to find a political solution with Hitler or
&gt;&gt;Mussoline? IIRC, Chamberlain tried to find a political solution.

&gt;In WWII the military won the war just like the military won the war in
&gt;Iraq.

Hardly. In WW2, the allies deliberately wiped our entire cities, not
only to destroy Germany's industrial capacity, but to demoralize the
German population. In Iraq, the US was very careful to select only
military targets with precision munitions and preserve the
infrastructure. Of course, Iraqis quickly looted and destroyed their
own infrastructure after we carefully protected it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Now what kind of military solution do you suggest for that part of the

Whatever force is needed to spare American lives and win the peace. No
more, no less.

Ever hear of the term &quot;for the duration&quot;?  Commonly used in WWII so
defeatists wouldn't set a date certain for the troops to demobilize and
return to their civilian pursuits.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, IMO, we're not winning for two primary reasons:

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1.) We're asking the military to act as policemen (rather than the

&gt;&gt;&gt; raged for millenia.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2.) We're asking the military (acting as policemen) to wage a PC &quot;war&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; where rules of engagement have us sacrifice US lives to spare Iraqi
&gt;&gt;&gt; civilians. I doubt Naziem or Fascism would have been stopped in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; 40's if we had today's press, today's traitors, and had to fight by
&gt;&gt;&gt; today's rules of engagement.

&gt;&gt; If today's Democrats had behaved during WWII like they do today, many
&gt;&gt; would be swinging from lamp poles.

&gt;&gt; People who had relatives at risk in the military did not take kindly to
&gt;&gt; defeatist talk.  Whole families were shunned if one member claimed he
&gt;&gt; was a conscientious objector and dodged military service.

&gt;&gt; Even during the Korean War I was in a bar once where someone made a
&gt;&gt; remark about the suckers in Korea.  The bartender, whose brother had
&gt;&gt; been killed there, threw the guy through the door to the street; about a
&gt;&gt; 6 foot drop.  He didn't hit the steps on the way down either.

&gt; Today, that bartender would be spending time in prison for assault &amp;

Want to bet?  You would have to find a witness who saw anything.  You
would have to find a cop who would make the arrest.  You would have to
find a prosecutor who would indict.  You would have had to find a jury
which would convict.

None of those were possible or even likely.  Some thought the bartender
acted with too much restraint.

Ah, Bull Shit!  Our troops don't become demoralized over Sanchez's comments.
They become demoralized over the bull shit political system that keeps them
from being able to do their jobs.

We fight for freedoms so that everyone can enjoy those freedoms.  Sanchez's
comments did not jeopardize national security and he broke no laws making
them.  The government needs to be scrutinized by the people they work for
and to do that efficiently we have to have access to all the information
available.
