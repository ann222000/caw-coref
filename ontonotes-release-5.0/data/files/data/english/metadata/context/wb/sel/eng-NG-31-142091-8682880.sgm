Richmond Flowers Is Dead at 88; Challenged Segregation and Klan
By DENNIS HEVESI

Richmond M. Flowers, who as the Alabama attorney general in the early
1960s drew national attention when he challenged the segregationist
policies of Gov. George C. Wallace and prosecuted Ku Klux Klansmen in
the killings of civil rights workers, died Thursday at his home in
Dothan, Ala. Mr. Flowers, who later served a prison term for bribery,
was 88.

The cause was Parkinson's disease, his son Richmond Flowers Jr. said
yesterday.

In a public life that took sharp turns, Mr. Flowers ran for attorney
general as an avowed segregationist in 1962, the same year Wallace was
elected governor. &quot;I am unalterably for segregation,&quot; Mr. Flowers
declared during his campaign, while promising to &quot;defend our time-
honored customs.&quot;

But by June 1963, after Wallace had made his famous &quot;schoolhouse door&quot;
stand to bar blacks from the University of Alabama, Mr. Flowers was
criticizing the governor for defying federal desegregation orders.

&quot;He wasn't willing to argue that integration was a good thing, but
only that it was federal law and had to be obeyed,&quot; Donald W.
Beachler, a political science professor at Ithaca College who studies
Southern politics and the civil rights era, said yesterday. &quot;That was
the only argument you could even hope to make in the South at the
time.&quot;

But over the next four years, Mr. Flowers took firmer stands against
segregation - and against Governor Wallace, who had once been a
friend. In a report he issued in October 1965, Mr. Flowers said that
dynamite had become the Klan's chief instrument of terror in Alabama;
that 40 of the 45 bombings in Birmingham since 1961 were &quot;believed to
have been carried out by individuals or groups associated with the
Klan,&quot; and that the governor had done nothing to curb the Klan.

On March 25, 1965, Viola Liuzzo, a civil rights worker from Detroit,
was shot to death as she and a young black man were driving along a
dark road in Lowndes County after the Selma-to-Montgomery Freedom
March. The gunshots were fired from a passing car carrying members of
the Klan.

When the Liuzzo case was tried on the state level, Mr. Flowers asked
the Alabama Supreme Court to purge several avowed racists from the
jury, then personally took over the case from local prosecutors. State
courts acquitted the three defendants, but a federal jury eventually
convicted them of violating Mrs. Liuzzo's civil rights.

Six months after the shooting of Mrs. Liuzzo, on Aug. 20, 1965, a
Lowndes County deputy sheriff, Thomas L. Coleman, killed Jonathan
Daniels, an Episcopal seminarian who had come to Alabama to register
black voters. The shotgun blast nearly tore Mr. Daniel's body in two.
A second blast struck the Rev. Richard Morrisroe, a Roman Catholic
priest, in the back, leaving him critically wounded. Mr. Coleman said
he had believed that Mr. Daniels had a knife and that Father Morrisroe
had a gun.

Outraged that a grand jury had indicted Mr. Coleman on a manslaughter
charge rather than murder, Mr. Flowers took over the prosecution. But
he was thwarted by the trial judge. When Mr. Flowers sought to delay
the trial until Father Morrisroe could testify, the judge refused,
then removed Mr. Flowers from the case. It took the jury two hours to
find Mr. Coleman not guilty.

&quot;The members of the jury are just as guilty as the man who pulled the
trigger,&quot; Mr. Flowers said after the verdict.

Richmond McDavid Flowers was born in Dothan on Nov. 11, 1918, the
youngest of four sons of John and Ila McDavid Flowers. His father
owned the local bank.

Mr. Flowers was in college in 1942 when he was drafted into the Army.
He rose to captain and served in the Pacific theater on the staff of
Gen. Douglas MacArthur. After returning to Dothan in 1946, Mr. Flowers
married Mary Catherine Russell.

Besides his wife and his son Richard Jr., of Birmingham, Mr. Flowers
is survived by another son, Jeff, of Destin, Fla.; a daughter, Mary
Tarwater of Knoxville, Tenn.; 10 grandchildren and 4 great-
grandchildren.

Mr. Flowers befriended George Wallace while the two were students at
the University of Alabama School of Law. Mr. Flowers graduated in
1948. Afterward, he practiced law in his hometown. He was elected to
the State Senate in 1954, and eight years later ran for attorney
general, winning by 63,000 votes.

In 1966, Governor Wallace, seeking to maintain his hold on the state
government, had his wife, Lurleen, run for governor. The state's
Constitution prohibited him from succeeding himself after one four-
year term. Mr. Flowers ran against Mrs. Wallace and came in a distant
second.

Three years later, he was sentenced to eight years in prison for
conspiring to extort payments from companies seeking licenses to do
business in Alabama while he was in office. He was paroled in 1973
after serving 16 months in a federal prison and was pardoned by
President Jimmy Carter in 1978. Mr. Flowers maintained that he had
been set up on the extortion charges because of his stance on
segregation.

&quot;I know what I stand for will one day be the Alabama way,&quot; he told The
Birmingham News in December 1965. &quot;I may be the front man - the fall
guy - but I know my way will be the way.&quot;
