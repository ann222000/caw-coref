I was just fixing an old solid state Heathkit grid dip meter and
realized it has what would make a fine chassis design for tube amps,
with somewhat (!) different dimensions.

Get a length of aluminum angle extrusion, with one side substantially
longer. Cut it in half, and make a matched section. Cut back the edge
of each upward on the side facing you, and you have a tray, so to
speak.

If you can only get L-section, you can do this with a center plate
and weld or rivet each side to it.

This can be covered with one piece of bent (plate or sheet brake)
metal and will ahve a top, 90 degrees in back and a 45 degree face, to
the user, for jacks and knobs and such. The identical cross section in
fact to the old Mc amps, except the 30 which has a straight front and
back, i.e. a  box.

The Heath GDO is here:
http://www.slack.com/images/TE/HeathHD-1250.jpg

You can see if you look the bottom is built from two lengths of
identical L-section material and trimmed at one corner. We want a
different width so need to weld a center plate or rivet it with real
rivets (i.e. bucking bar and rivet gun). No pop rivets.

Morgan Jones suggests using U-section aluminium for the
sides, with the hollow section facing outwards. Top and
bottom are screwed-on sheet or plate. Rectangular section
pillars are screwed on at each corner, to which front and
back plates are screwed. The resulting side recesses makes
for easy lifting.

Ease of lifting is of increasing importance. After tearing a
tendon in my arm, I'm considering putting push-chair (baby
carriage?) wheels on my power supply.

I know you guys like to use transmission pans, old ashtrays, etc. for your
projects (may Fred rest in peace) --  but if you've spent a lot of time and
money on the components and want to showcase your effort instead, check out:

Yup. Shameless commercial plug.

Many kitchen table builders just don't have the possibility for
own metalwork. Jon's chassis seem to offer a very high-class
alternative. Hammond is cheap and cheerful.

There used to be a guy in the US, Fred (can't remember his other name)
who traded under the name of Spire Audio.  He made excellent chassis
to order in stainless steel, fully punched and drilled.  He posted sometimes
on Usenet, and also had an ad in Glass Audio.  He suddenly disappeared.
I heard that he was involved  in a metal-shop accident.

You just can't do meaningful work without some kind of shop area of
your very own. If you don't have that, that's the first thing to fix.
All else is wasted.

Bret. Once again, I think you are raising the threshold too high.
In these days of &quot;plug and play&quot; it is amazing that anyone under
the age of fifty (let alone teenagers) have the patience to be
interested in tube audio.

Bending and punching a chassis is beyond most beginners,
especially those who work on the kitchen table, so for them
a pre fabricated chassis is the only option.

Few have access to a workshop.

Nice chassis...  Does the $119 unit come with the cage? Cats and grand-
kids make that a basic requirement.

Thanks, Peter.

No, the cage was an add-on.  I'm out of stock on the cages . . .  But have
plenty of the chassis.
