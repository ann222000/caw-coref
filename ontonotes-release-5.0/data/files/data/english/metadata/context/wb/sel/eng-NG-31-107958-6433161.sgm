I am looking for some bamboo poles in the Los Angeles area to be used
as spars.  The recommendation from a bamboo specialist that also sails
is to use Phyllostachys nigra 'Henon' but I can't find any poles for
sale in the area.  I would prefer it around 3" diamter and 22' long.
I could pick it up if it s relatively close but the only place on the
net I have found is in Boston.  Thanks for the info.

Apropos of nothing at all, in desperation, we tried using a bamboo pole
as a whisker pole while crossing the Pacific.  We had been keeping our
eyes open for almost a year, trying to find a real one but to no avail.
Finally, while in Bahia de Caracas, Ecuador, we bought a bamboo pole
from a construction site (I think it cost us all of $2) and cut it down
to size.  It was about 3" at the thick end and about 2 1'2" at the
skinny end.

It worked great for awhile, but the first time the wind got up to 18
kt.s, the compression load snapped it.  Suddenly, there I was, up on the
fore deck about 2 or 3 in the morning (why do these things always happen
then), madly scrambling to derig the thing and get it over the side
before the sharp, broken ends could rip the sail.

As expensive as they are, I'll have a real one with me before I take of
the next time.

I'm using it for an outrigger sailing canoe.  It wont be under as much
stress as if it were on a larger boat and I wont be out far at all.
It was actually recommended by the designer but I am trying to go much
larger than what was suggested.  he says that 2" should be fine but I
am looking for 3".  I have also been looking around for a really solid
specie but I can't find anyone in So.Cal. that even sells the poles.
The suggestion at this point has been to find a grove and go cut one
down myself.  It may come to that.

I don't know that my little sailing canoe will be able to handle
18kt.s but that would be rather impressive if it did.  It will
probably scare the hell out of me the first few times but if I can get
that kind of speed I will definately let everyone know.

thanks,
Bill

There's an excellent grove of all sizes of bamboo growing at the Huntington
Library. Don't know how they would react to your "borrowing" one, though.

Bill was wondering if you could use 2 masts off of old windsurfers
use a small alloy tube as a joiner in the middle, the one's i have at
home are nice and springy like bamboo. Was thinking of the spun
fiberglass type not the alloy type.
hope its a thought

Yeah I could do that but It would really not look good.  Considering
the boat is all wood strip composite I wanted to go more natural
materials.  If I can't get bamboo then I am probably going to make it
out of a wood beam.

Carpet companies may have them. They used to be delivered with a bamboo
pole in the middle of the roll.

There are two other ways.
One is to wrap wetted out glass cloth tape spirally round a waxed
plastic pipe and pull the pipe out after (use hot airgun to melt wax).

As you want natural and can't get the correct sized bamboo, why not
make a composite bamboo mast which will be much stronger than one
single piece as well as being lighter. Japanese Kendo practice swords
are made in this way. Bamboo of the desired length is split into
staves. The edges are shaped like barrel staves on an angle so that
when they all fit together they press against each other and transfer
shock loads. The assembled sword is not glued but keld together by
leather thongs at intervals and a long thong stretched to caps at both
ends. - They are very strong and can break broom handles as well as
bones. A single stem of bamboo whould either shatter or split.

Masts for small Indonesian fishing boats throughout the islands are
often made of a few small diameter bamboo stems lashed together at
intervals. They are light and can be raised when the wind comes up.

- Just a thought.

Peter

Found them!!!!!

I finally found a place that can get them in Huntington Beach.  If any
of you are ever looking for good bamboo in so cal it is at Franks cane
and rush supply.  I'll let you all know if it works well.
