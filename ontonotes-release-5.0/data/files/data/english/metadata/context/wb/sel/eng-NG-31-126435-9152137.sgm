Demonstration

&quot;Men and women who use alcohol as an escape
are not the only ones who are afraid of life,
hostile to the world, fleeing from it into loneliness.
Millions who are not alcoholics
are living today in illusory worlds,
nurturing the basic anxieties and insecurities
of human existence
rather than face themselves with courage and humility.
To these people, AA can offer as a cure no magic potion,
no chemical formula, no powerful drug.
But it can demonstrate to them how to use the tools
of humility, honesty, devotion, and love,
which indeed are the heart of the Twelve Steps
of our recovery.&quot;
c.1957AAWS, Alcoholics Anonymous Comes of Age, p. 279

Thought to Consider . . .

AA Is like an adjustable wrench, it fits almost any nut.

Failure
From &quot;Physician, Heal Thyself!&quot;:

&quot;And then, one ill-defined day, one day that I can't recall, I stepped across
the line that alcoholics know so well, and from that day on, drinking was
miserable. When a few drinks made me feel good before I went over that line,
those same drinks now made me feel wretched. In an attempt to get over that
feeling, there was a quick onslaught of a greater number of drinks, and then all was
lost. Alcohol failed to serve the purpose.&quot;

SERENITY AFTER THE STORM

Someone who knew what he was talking about once remarked that pain was the
touchstone of all spiritual progress.  How heartily we A.A.'s can agree with
him. . .

TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS,  p. 93-94

When on the roller coaster of emotional turmoil, I remember that growth is
often painful.  My evolution in the A.A. program has taught me that I must
experience the inner change, however painful, that eventually guides me from
selfishness to selflessness.  If I am to have serenity, I must STEP my way past
emotional turmoil and its subsequent hangover, and be grateful for continuing
spiritual progress.

A Higher Power for Atheists

I have had many experiences with atheists, mostly good. Everybody in A.A. has
the right to his own opinion. It is much better to maintain an open and
tolerant society than it is to suppress any small disturbances their opinions might
occasion. Actually, 1 don't know of anybody who went off and died of
alcoholism because of some atheist's opinions on the cosmos.
&quot;But I do always entreat these folks to look to a 'Higher Power' -namely,
their own group. When they come in, most of their A.A. group is sober, and they
are drunk. Therefore, the group is a 'Higher Power.' That's a good enough
start, and most of them do progress from there. I know how they feel, because I was
once that way myself.&quot;

LETTER, 1962
*~*~*~*~*^ Big Book Quote ^*~*~*~*~*
&quot;We cannot subscribe to the belief that his life is a vale of tears,
though it once was just that for many of us. But it is clear that we
made our own misery. God didn't do it. Avoid then, the
deliberate manufacture of misery, but if trouble comes, cheerfully
capitalize it as an opportunity to demonstrate His omnipotence.&quot;

A.A. Thought For The Day

How do I talk with new prospects? Am I always trying to dominate
the conversation? Do I lay down the law and tell prospects what
they will have to do? Do I judge them privately and feel that they
have small chance of making the program? Do I belittle them to
myself? Or am I willing to bare my soul so as to get them talking
about themselves? And, then, am I willing to be a good listener,
not interrupting, but hearing them out to the end? Do I feel deeply
that they are my brothers or my sisters?   Will I do all I can to
help them along the path to sobriety?

Meditation For The Day

&quot;The work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of
righteousness shall be quietness and assurance forever.&quot; Only when
the soul attains this calm, can there be true spiritual work done,
and mind and soul and body be strong to conquer and bear all things.
Peace is the result of righteousness. There is no peace in wrong
doing, but if we live the way God wants us to live, quietness and
assurance follow. Assurance is that calmness born of a deep
certainty of God's strength available to us and in His power to
love and guard us from all harm and wrong doing.

Prayer For The Day

I pray that I may attain a state of true calmness. I pray that I
may live in quietness and peace.
