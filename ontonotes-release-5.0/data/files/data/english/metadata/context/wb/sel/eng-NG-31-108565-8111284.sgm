Doesn't EE claim that there was no open ocean prior to 250 million years ago?

And that the Pacific was closed?  Really?  Then why are there certain
Ordovician trilobites, lower Silurian graptolites, and 45 discoveries of
lower to mid-Devonian tentaculites in Malaysia, all of which are deep
water, pelagic species?

http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-3360%28196703%2941%3A2%3C449%3A...

Obviously there is ample evidence to refute EEers' claims (not to mention
the fact that they can't explain where all the 'extra' mass came from), but
I thought I would point out this rather blatant biological one.

I doubt very much, George,  that the EE theory interests you. For a
start your official Time Column  is founded on fossils, and then you
reverse the argument to make of what was originally a relative scale,
a definitive &amp; absolute time scale !
You are not authorised to do that !
What do you expect then with such circular reasoning ?

Further still those fossils are facts and facts are always consistent
with the EE theory, while they are not with you rambling PT legend
So please do not add your Ordovician,  Silurian or Devonian tags to
such since they are indeed meaningless
( except in terms of relative strata, or bedding, i.e.  in relation to
each others )

I admit the present EE theory as expressed by its main supporters has
some flaw in it, but to these flaws the True Geology has all the
answers.
Last but nor least, from Lord Kelvin all the way to Dr Don Findlay,
the impossibility of your Continental rafting has been demonstrated
time &amp; time again.

Geology is not a matter of faith &amp; beliefs, my good man .

Funny, you seem to make the confusion between pelagic and abyssal. The
existence of pelagic species, living away from emerged terrain, is
compatible with the existence of epicontinental seas.

The true question is: Is there any evidence of the existence of abyssal
plains, 4000 m deep, before 200 MY.

There is no evidence that any part of Australia was once connected to South
America.  There is plenty of evidence that it was connected to Antarctica,
which, along with Africa, was between South America and Australia when
Pangea existed.  You simply cannot link up the stratigraphy in any part of
Australia with any part of South America, simply because there is no
straitgraphic connection between the two.  Download a detailed geologic map
of South America and a detailed geologic map of Australia and try it to
connect the dots.  I dare you to do it.  It can't be done.  Neither the
stratigraphy nor the structural geology line up. Next.

&quot;And in fact, another way to interpret this, and I don't know if it's

In contrast, what a real paper looks like and concludes:

http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AGUFM.B53B0990H

The Marble Bar Chert contains abundant hematite-rich bands, and has been
interpreted that the hematite was produced by modern weathering. On the
other hand, other geologists have emphasized the oxidation of aqueous
ferrous ions by iron bacteria. To understand the precipitation of the iron
minerals in Marble Bar Chert, we have examined the mineral assemblages,
textures and chemical compositions in fresh core which obtains by Archean
Biosphere Drilling Project (ABDP). The ABDP core of the Marble Bar Chert is
composed of organic-rich black chert, silicified white chert, and
rhythmically banded chert consisted of white, red and black band, in order
of sedimentation. Only the rhythmically banded chert has high magnetic
susceptibility, which is associated with the existence of numerous hematite
and magnetite grains. The colour from red to black is correlated with the
proportion of hematite and magnetite. Euhedral grains of pyrite of 1 to 50
micrometer in diameter are observed to be layered in bands as well as to be
precipitated in veins. This texture suggests that the pyrite might be of
syngenetic. Red bands in the rhythmically banded chert contain numerous
hematite grains, which are accumulated as spherical grains of about 100 nm
in diameter to euhedral grains up to 500 nm in quartz with the size of
10-30 micrometer in diameter. The quartz with hematite grains shows
botryoidal texture. Black bands also contain numerous euhedral magnetite
grains of about 1 micrometer in diameter, and the occurrence is similar to
that of red bands. These botryoidal textures resemble that of modern
bacterial mat of benthic coccoid cyanobacteria. Both bands contain euhedral
grains of siderite of micron size, in the botryoidal quartz. The carbon
isotopic ratios of siderite are from _E to +2 per mill, suggesting siderite
was produced by the reaction between dissolved ferrous ions and bicarbonate
ions in seawater. SEM images show bacteria-like cells connecting with and
enveloping hematite grains in the botryoidal quartz. The intensity of
cathodoluminescence from the botryoidal quartz is heterogeneous, and its
two-dimensional image shows bacteria-like texture. The carbon X-ray
photoelectron spectra acquired from banded cherts contain a peak at about
285 eV, suggesting C-C and C-H bonding. Furthermore, the Raman spectrum
from the black band chert exhibits the peaks at about 1300cm-1 and
1600cm-1, derived from organic carbon. The scanning image of Raman spectrum
reveals the heterogeneous distribution of organic carbon. The occurrences
of mineral and organic carbon suggest that the rhythmically banded cherts
have not been affected by hydrothermal alteration, metamorphism or modern
weathering, but suggest that the original texture has remained unchanged.
The occurrences suggest further that the precipitation of iron oxides was
related with biological activity.

Changing the goalpost already?  Then how do you account for the fact that
every EE &quot;expert&quot; makes the claim that South America and the east coast of
Australia were connected when Pangea existed?  In fact, this claim is one
of the main pieces of &quot;evidence&quot; most often cited by EEers.  Since there is
no evidence that that was ever the case, I'd say EE has a serious problem
(of course, every real geologists already knows this, so when are you going

the reconstructions presented are valid.  There is no paleontologic,
petrologic, mineralogic, stratigraphic, paleomagnetic, nor structural
evidence to suppose his placement of Australia anywhere near western north
or South America when Pangea existed is based on reality.  It is simply
misinformed fantasy to suggest that it was.  You cannot connect dots that
don't exist, Floppy.

No.
Australia was not connected to S. America 120 mllions years ago. But the
border of the shelf east of New Zealand was certainly connected to West
Antarctica. The pattern of the isochrons  and the transform faults
leaves no doubt. The south Pacific was closed and that rules out PT.
See the figure below:

The dash line highligths the matching border.
The arrows indicate the matching spots according to the transform faults
the It is very clear. Even a highschooler could figure it out.

&gt;  Then how do you account for the fact that
&gt; every EE &quot;expert&quot; makes the claim that South America and the east coast of
&gt; Australia were connected when Pangea existed?

First, every EE &quot;experts&quot; don't say that. McCarthy says that but he's
wrong because it can't be. Australia was up to the north closer to east
asia and north america. See Maxlow fig 4.2 or 4.4:

Sorry, but you're liar. Maxlow showed those connections. See chap3a and
3b:
