&gt; Hello everyone...

Well.........this e mail is an eye opener. I live in Lindsay, and I too had a OT come to my home. He recommended,
risers, handles and the same chair lift....he told me ODSP will NOT cover. I got approved through March of
Dimes.....BUT.........they say they will have to approach service clubs and HOPE for money?

Any help or directives etc that might apply? It has been since Dec 2006.......and I am getting worse daily.

Thanking you in advance

&gt; Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) couple weeks ago. An occupational

&gt; CCAC. It is covered by OHIP. She assessed my needs and my apt. I will
&gt; be getting a shower chair with transfer bench, shower hose, grab bar
&gt; for the tub,  furniture risers to raise my couch, new cane with ice
&gt; pick, walker type commode for over the toilet (I need the side arms
&gt; for me to get up and down the toilet easily), hand reacher, and a
&gt; small bed rail. She said I will need to come in to the the store to
&gt; get a quote on prices and then send to ODSP. ODSP authorizes, sending
&gt; the forms and I will get the stuff delivered to my apt in couple
&gt; weeks. stuff. However if
&gt; anyone is on OAS or even CPP-D at age 60 or so and they are not on
&gt; ODSP anymore, there is some sort of funding thru service clubs, such
&gt; as Lions Club, March of Dimes, etc.

Hi S,

I needed all of those things and more. My occupational therapist approached
Ontario Works  and it was paid for in total.  You'll need to have the name
of the store and a price for everything in your letter so that OW sends the
cheque directly to the store....had the stuff within a couple of
weeks....good luck and good health.

if you contact ODSP  and ask them for a fax # for assistive devices
program . you have to get estimate letter for the things you need and
perscription  for these items . have doc fax both these. If you get
turned down you can then  give ODSP rejection letter and they will
pay . i have been thru  this recently  for a friend of mine
