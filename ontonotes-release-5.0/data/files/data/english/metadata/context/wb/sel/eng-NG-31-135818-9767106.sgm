Jan,

I dont find any specific Tag stating the vendors for various source info's regarding Exchange codes, currency, security, etc.

Tag 22 only specifies the ID source - but not the exact vendor. For example Tag 22=2 refers to Sedol but the vendor for Sedol is London Stock Exchange.

Regards,
Sunil Singh

Sunil,

I think there is some confusion on the data model you try to map here. Tag 22 (SecurityIDSource) defines a source for security IDs, i.e. Tag 22=2 means SEDOL and this is defined by the LSE. This means that you do not need to know more than the fact that the ID you receive represents a SEDOL code. Tag 22 also has other sources such as Reuters (5 - RIC code) and Bloomberg (A - Bloomberg Symbol).

I do not see why you need to know where you physically receive a unique ID from. This is not what is intended to be captured in tag 22. National numbering agencies are often enough the ones who issue unique IDs. However, you will not have a physical connection to this agency but to the execution venue that uses it to identify what it offers to trade.

On the other hand, the execution venue for a security (ExDestination, tag 100) is of interest as a security can be traded in multiple places. It is unlikely that many other places than the LSE use SEDOL but ISIN is very common in Europe. It just happens to be that for some of the tag 22 values the issuer is part of the name (e.g. OPRA). Conceptually, the issuer and the ID domain are two different things.

Hope this helps,
Hanno.

Thanks,

Now it is clear how fix protocol uses these tags.
My gole is to organise data in a fix-frendly way. We have many sources for same information, and it looks like vendor codes is not a standard in the way that markets are.

I will move on with understanding instrument, instrument types and subtypes...
