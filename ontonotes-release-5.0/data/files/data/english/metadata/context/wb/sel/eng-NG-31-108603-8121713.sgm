Finally I got a prescription for new glasses from my cataract
surgeon.  Before placing an order I have a few questions.

1.  In the event that the Rx is filled properly but the results are
not satisfactory to me, is the optician responsible to replace the
lenses with more suitable ones?  Or should I then buy a whole new pair
at my own expense?

2.  Is there a way to get first a trial pair of glasses?  I know it's
customary with contacts, but what about eyeglasses?

3.  Out of all the extra options offered by the opticians (at extra
cost, of course), which ones are really worthwhile and recommended?

I am somewhat concerned about the &quot;add&quot; portion of the Rx, because no
actual test for near vision was conducted by my doc -- he simply added
whatever, apparently according to the optometric formula.  But what is
there to guarantee that it would be proper?

all good questions, I would suggest checking with a few different
opticians in your area, as each may have very different policies
regarding re-dos.
a good anti-reflection/anti-scratch (eg crizal, super hi vision)
coating is worthwhile.

If the frames are OK, then you just need to buy new lenses.  However,
the optician cannot prescribe those new lenses (at least in the US), so
you will need to visit the doctor again.

It won't be proper, depending on what kind of lenses you get (bifocal,
trifocal or progressive).  With cataract surgery, you lose all
accommodation.  I don't use glasses for distance, but have three
different powers of reading glasses.  You can't get that in one pair of

medicine bottles and such).

I am one month after the cataract surgery and IOL implant on my R eye

When the RX is written by the OD at the optic shop, the shop is
responsible and will replace the lense(s) as needed at no additional

for a vision test by the shop OD ($39.00) to guarantee replacement if

As I said, I have an IOL only in my bad R eye.  I have been using
progressive for many years and they always worked for me, although I
would prefer to have the intermediate portion bigger and leave less
space for distance and reading.  Actually I am planning on ordering 2
pairs -- one for outdoors (driving) and distance with a bottom portion
for reading, and the other for computer and indoors use.  I can read
the very fine print on med bottles with no glasses at all!

BTW, my best possible VA with the new glasses will be 20/30 in the
good L eye (due to the immature cataract) and 20/50 in my damaged R
eye.  Not perfect, but good enough for driving.  I never saw any VA
described for intermediate or near distance, which IMO makes much
sense and is not less important than the 20 feet to infinity
measurement (which would be important if I were a hunter in the
wild).  If there was such a description, I would be interested
in 10/10 vision, 2/2 and 1/1 (all measured in feet).  I believe that I
can get this acuity with my glasses.  Am I mistaken?

I personally would pay the $39.  That's a fraction of the cost of the
glasses.  I read that OMDs are not necessarily experts at refraction,
because they often don't do much of it.  For both of my cataract
repairs, I was sent to the OD before seeing the OMD for the last
appointment.  So I would pay the $39 for two reasons, to get a second
opinion on the prescription, and to prevent the finger pointing, where
the optician says the prescription wasn't correct, and the OMD says the
prescription is correct, but the optician didn't do it right.

I don't know what this means.  In any case, what counts is how well you
can see.  I would suggest measuring the distance you read at, and the
distance from your eye to the computer screen, and give this information
to the OD next time you are checked.

In my experience, ODs will not check the close vision without a specific
request.  They have all the equipment there and ready to go, so that
isn't the problem.  I guess they find that they can specify an &quot;add&quot;
without measuring, and it seems to work.

I checked it with the following results, which I think are typical to
most people:

24&quot; - 28&quot; for computer
8' - 12' for TV viewing (in my case it's 10')
22&quot; for relaxed reding
10&quot; - 14&quot; for reading &amp; writing at the desk

These are the activities for which I need the sharpest vision.  So if
it was up to me I would have an indoor tri-focal (or progressives)
pair of glasses to provide the sharpest vision at 10' (upper region),
2.5' (middle region), and 1' (lower region).   And I would have a
driving bi- or tri-focal pair to give me the best distant vision, with
reading lower portion and something in the middle, maybe for 5'
vision.

But this is not what I will get, unfortunately.  Moreover, the middle
portion of any tri-focals or progressives will be of limited height
(probably 10mm), which is practically almost useless.  Why?  I have
inquired about the possibility of having a larger middle section, and
was told that it does not exist, they don't make them this way.  This
is very frustrating.  The intermediate power is not even mentioned on
the prescription.

I am ready for a revolution!

20 feet is termed optical infinity.  anything beyond 20 feet will be
properly focused with the same lens power that provided clear vision
at 20 ft.

And 20/20 = 10/10 = 2/2 etc.  They are all equivalent just like they
are equivalent mathematically.
these ratios simply mean-- what letter size you can read at X feet /
what letter size the population norm can read at X feet.

No.  you measure the prescription at 20 feet which gives the lens
powers needed for the clearest possible distance vision (20 feet and
beyond = optical infinity).  then to determine what is needed at any
distance closer than 20 feet is simply a calculation.  Lens power (in
diopters) equals the 1/focal distance (in meters).  Thus the lens
prescription to see an object at 12 feet (~ 4 meters) is the distance
prescription plus 1/4 diopters.

With progressive lenses like you are getting, what the optometrist
does is measure the distance prescription, then specify the add power
which is usually set on the high end, like +2.50 or +2.75 (that number
is dependent on age, whether cataract surgery has been performed,
working habits, etc.).  The progressive portion of the lens will
therefore provide the proper lens power at all distances between
infinity and about 15 inches from your face depending upon how far
down in the lens you view the object (by holding it down or tilting
your head back).  Determining the near add power is pretty simple for
progressives but more prone to error with lined bifocals since its
hard to know at what distance the patient does much of their near
work.

All of these working distances can be easily achieved using a
progressive lens with a strong bifocal add.  Your last measurement,
the reading and writing at a desk measurement, who cause me to want to
push your add power even higher to about +3.00D and even then you
would be more comfortable if you moved a little further back for
that-- say 13&quot; - 16&quot;

Bullshit-- many different progressive lens designs exist.  Some are
optimized for larger reading and intermediate areas.  Below is a link
to one such lens and I am not sure if it is even the best.  A good
optician, such as Rob M who often posts in this NG, could tell you
many others and recommend the ones that are best.
http://www.zeiss.com/4125682000258738/EmbedTitelIntern/SOLAMAX_Sell_S...

BTW -- as your cat surgery was 4 weeks ago, then you should be healed
quite well and there shouldn't be further Rx changes to worry about.
Its time to go ahead with getting your new glasses.

Also, I would recommend getting a good anti-reflection coating on your
lenses with a no-stick teflon finish.  Transitions would be a good add-
on if you are outside in direct sunlight a lot.  They won't darken if
your are behind the windshield of a car however.

I've worn modified progressives for several years, and they work so well
that I recommend them for patients who spend lots of time up close or at a
desk or a computer.

Instead of making the distance portion focus at 20 feet, I use 6 feet. This
introduces blur for driving, but it's about 20/25+ and I drive to work and
back now without thinking about it.

The benefit is I can actually see the computer at 2-3 feet through the top
of my lenses (depth-of-field gives us considerable leeway), and I don't have
to crane my head back to see my instruments at work.

If you change the distance correction by +050 diopters, the add (bifocal
value) must be changed by -050 to offset. Lower adds have wider corridors,
and I get good results in the intermediate with cheap progressives.

It's somewhat arbitrary.  For optical purposes,it's close enough to
infinity that it doesn't matter, but not so long as to require a huge
room, or many mirrors.  Countries using the metric system use 6 meters,
I believe.

&gt; 22&quot; for relaxed reding
&gt; 10&quot; - 14&quot; for reading &amp; writing at the desk

&gt; These are the activities for which I need the sharpest vision.  So if
&gt; it was up to me I would have an indoor tri-focal (or progressives)
&gt; pair of glasses to provide the sharpest vision at 10' (upper region),
&gt; 2.5' (middle region), and 1' (lower region).   And I would have a
&gt; driving bi- or tri-focal pair to give me the best distant vision, with
&gt; reading lower portion and something in the middle, maybe for 5'
&gt; vision.

&gt; But this is not what I will get, unfortunately.  Moreover, the middle
&gt; portion of any tri-focals or progressives will be of limited height
&gt; (probably 10mm), which is practically almost useless.  Why?  I have
&gt; inquired about the possibility of having a larger middle section, and
&gt; was told that it does not exist, they don't make them this way.  This
&gt; is very frustrating.  The intermediate power is not even mentioned on
&gt; the prescription.

&gt; I am ready for a revolution!
">

It's not exactly a revolution.  I think that some eye care professionals
are reluctant to fit unusual solutions, because they have seen too many
remakes and requests for refunds when patients find out that, yes, the
doctor (or fitter) was right.

Most people want one, and only one, pair of glasses that work for
everything.  My wife is this way.  She went from no glasses, to readers
for presbyopia, to progressives for hyperopia.  It's kind of funny,
because for decades I was wedded to my glasses while she wore none.
Now, she puts her glasses on first thing in the morning and only removes
them for bathing and sleeping.  I no longer wear glasses for distance.

I have always used single vision glasses.  When I was first diagnosed
with presbyopia, I just got two pairs of glasses, one for distance and
one for close.

You may wish to consider single vision glasses as one of your pairs.  On
the other hand, since progressives work for you, you should get what you
want.

It is easier to get glasses that work for all tasks if you are willing
to have more than one pair, each optimized for different tasks.  Did
you tell your doc about those plans and provide him with the distances
to the various tasks so he could write two prescriptions?  If not,
might be worth the $39 to have the optical shop OD refract and do a
trial frame determnation for the various distances.

You are mistaken.

If your best far VA is 20/30, then you can expect 10/15, 2/3, 1/1.5
and if best VA is 20/50 you can expect 10/25, 2/5, 1/2.5.   Best VA is
limited by the eye not the test distance.

Better vision at near can be achieved by holding things closer with a
stronger add.   For example, although your left eye will not be able
to see 0.4M type (20/20 equivalent at 40cm) with reading add of 2.5D
set for 40cm, you  would likely be able to see 0.4M type at 33cm with
reading add of 3D set for 33cm.

(Note that you are NOT achieving .4/.4 vision in that case, you are
achieving .33/.40 vision).

I've never worn progressives, so take this as the voice of inexperience,
but with a large screen, having the power change means I would have to
move my whole head up and down, instead of just my eyes.  So if I get
the correct distance for the bottom of the screen, the top will be too
far, if I just move my eyes.  Of course, if you still have enough

Bingo!  This dissolves all my concerns.

I have never had any problems with progressives and felt comfortable,
smooth and natural with them from the first minute.  But reading
messages on S.M.V. it seems that many people do have problems
adjusting to progressives.  I tended to attribute it to my relatively
simple situation in the past (moderate myopia with mild astigmatism,
but otherwise healthy eyes), whereas many people have a variety of eye
problems.

Now my situation has changed.  I have one IOL, a damaged retina, more
advanced presbyopia and a small cataract in the other eye.  I can no
longer get 20/20 correction, and the new glasses I am going to order
will cost about 3 times more than I ever spent on eyeware.  Hence my
concerns.

I still wonder why in illustrations of progressive lenses 3 distinct
colors are used to represent 3 zones, if in reality there are no
&quot;zones&quot; but rather a gradual progression of lens power.  I think it's
the source of my mistaken concepts.  And I still wonder why not
everybody chooses progressives and why so many people encounter
problems with them.

When a progressive ad is &quot;ground&quot; into a bifocal lens, the periphery
of the lens becomes blurry.  This doesn't happen with a lined bifocal
where the periphery is much more clear.  The blur in the periphery is
what most people don't like and can't get adjusted to.  There is a
population of folks who, when presented with an object of interest off-
center, prefer to turn their eyes rather than turn their head.  these
folks have lots of adjusting to do when they start using a no-line
bifocal.

trying to represent the 3 zones of a no-line bifocal with 3 colored
segments is an over-simplification.  While it gets the concept across
it leaves some people with an erroneous understanding--  like you had.

===============================

Hello Robert (Bob, Rob ?),

How do you trial frame a progressive Rx?  Do you have some kind of
plano progressive that trial lenses can be added to with Jenelli
clips?
What PAL lens designs do you consider best for intermediate and near
work (e.g. wide channel, etc.)?  I mentioned SolaMax to Ms. Brainy but
I don't know how good it really is versus competitive lenses.

Thanks in advance,

optics training than ophthalmic optics training).  I rely on, and
respect, expert optician's recommendations.

&gt;Hello Robert (Bob, Rob ?),

I used to be a &quot;Bob&quot; but nowadays I prefer Robert.

http://www.optiboard.com/forums/showpost.php?p=167990&amp;postcount;=7

I don't use this though. My suggestion of using a trial frame was in regards to
the posters question of how to get the correct add power in general. Especially
helpful for confirming the distance (actually the intermediate power) for
computer glasses. I have the client measure the distance to the screen before
the fitting, and then situate the client at the same distance to my screen at
the dispensing table.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What PAL lens designs do you consider best for intermediate
">

I don't feel that any of them are adequate for extended tasks. They're ok for
general use- quick glance at the speedometer, price on a shelve at the
supermarket, etc. Those with frequent intermediate tasks, reading music charts
and looking at desktop monitors, will be much better served by using separate
glasses designed for such use.

In general, the longer corridor PALs e.g., Definity and Gradal Top, have the
widest corridors, and the slowest rate of power change, the latter probably the
more important of the two, keeping the focus clearer over a wider distance along
the vertical meridian.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and near work (e.g. wide channel, etc.)?
">

Those with frequent close tasks at 16&quot;, avid readers for instance, really
appreciate the shorter corridor designs, getting the full add power in to play
close to, or at their reading depth, typically 10mm to 15mm.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I mentioned SolaMax to Ms. Brainy but
&gt;I don't know how good it really is versus competitive lenses.
">

The Solamax's claim to fame is the wide near zone, along with a moderately short
corridor, and an excellent material option of Spectralite. A little long in the
tooth design-wise though, and with Zeiss's acquisition of Sola, I suspect that
Spectralite will be phased out (its already happening with their SV lenses).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That seems to be the trend in your profession.

Opticianry is taking a bit hit though- were down to 21 or so states where there
is at least some minimum educational, practical experience, and licensure
requirements. In twenty years, we might have to fly to Germany to get some of
these tougher RXs filled. So it goes.

Unfortunately, Optiboard is often censored by Nazi-like moderators who are
more interested in lining the pockets of the optical business than in
providing accurate information to consumers. In fact, consumers are not
really welcome on Optiboard (but they don't always have a good way of
identifying them).

It's not the marketing departments, it is the people who run the forum.
Several years ago, Pete Hamlin (with Essilor) posted about the supposed
problems of Trivex compared to polycarb. I followed his post with counter
facts and arguments, and I also happened to mention that he should have
disclosed in his post that Essilor (his employer) did not offer Trivex and
that Essilor is one of the largest manufacturer's of polycarb.

My posts were deleted and I was warned to not ever question someone's
integrity again (even if they were a marketing person) or I would kicked out
permanently. I was also continually harassed in the forums after that. Yes
they ARE Nazis.

Later, even Pete admitted that he should have disclosed that Essilor does
not sell Trivex, and further admitted that it is a violation of his own
company rules of ethical conduct to criticize products (such as Trivex) made
by other companies.

Yes, I read that thread, and it is a big pile of dung. If a consumer asks a
question about what is the best progressive lens design they are ignored and
told to go elsewhere, whereas if a optical worker (I hesitate to use the
word professional) is asked the same question they get many response. The
board claim that one cannot give specific advise for an Rx, but it is OK to
generalize about lenses without even knowing a person's RX. This is ass
backwards.

The thing they are really afraid of is the following:

1. That if consumers are knowledgeable, they will start to realize that most
optical workers are idiots, and
2. If consumers knew the price markup on lenses and frames (astronomical)
consumers will revolt.

Pete (more or less) said that Trivex sucks (this was about 6 years ago). I
offered counter facts and arguments. What got the moderators ticked off at
me was that I also suggested that it was improper IMO for Pete to not
disclose that Essilor (his employer) did not offer Trivex, but did make poly
(which he was championing over Trivex).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So he made a mistake and admitted it. What did you say in response?

I did not have a problem with Pete, other than that I disagreed with his
conclusions about Trivex vs. Poly. I think it was honorable that he admitted
his mistake about non-discloser (that his employer, Essilor, does not offer
Trivex) and he admitted it was a violation of Essilor company policy to
comment about competitor products.

I had a problem with the forum moderators who deleted all my posts and
threatened to kick me out for questioning Pete's integrity.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; but it's ok to diagnose, sight unseen, strangers on the internet?

I don't advocate diagnosing strangers on the internet. But one can make a
more accurate recommendation for a PAL (barring any other medical or eye
problems) as to which lens might be more suitable for a given Rx. The
opticians on the board give recommendations as to which PAL is better with
very little regard to a patient's particular Rx.

Furthermore, if sufficient questions were asked on the internet (or in any
written communication), then I fail to understand how that is any worse than
asking the same questions in person. It might sound better to ask a patient
in person, but often the questions and answers are not as well thought out
in person, especially when the store is busy on a Saturday afternoon, and
the optician is trying to turn as many customers as possible during his/her
shift.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Most people are idiots.

Perhaps so, but choosing a  PAL design is more complex than buying a
computer, and consumers and most opticians are completely befuddled the
various PAL choices.

I don't begrudge optical retailers for the markup on their products. I paid
over $750 for a Autoflex frame fitted with Zeiss Individual 1.60. I am
simply stating a fact that many people on Optiboard are very paranoid (in
their own posts) about having consumers find out what the markup is, and
they frequently remind others not to discuss on Optiboard the specific costs
or prices of the products they sell.
