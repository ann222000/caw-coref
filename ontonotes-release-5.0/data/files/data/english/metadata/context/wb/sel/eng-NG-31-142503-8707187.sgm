A BILL

To enact section 2919.124 of the Revised Code relative to requiring
paternal consent before an abortion may be performed.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:

(B)(1) When the fetus that is the subject of the procedure is
viable, no person shall perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant
woman without the written informed consent of the father of the fetus.

(2) When the fetus that is the subject of the procedure is not
viable, no person shall perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant
woman without the written informed consent of the father of the fetus.

(C)(1) A pregnant woman seeking to abort her pregnancy shall
provide, in writing, the identity of the father of the fetus to the
person who is to perform or induce the abortion.

(snip)

-----------------------------------

I've been calling for this for years. As long as men are required to pay
child support, they should have some say in whether the fetus is born or
not.

More proof that anti-choicers consider women to be second-class
citizens, the property and chattel of men.

They say that the purpose of child support is for the best interest of the
child.

That's what it's supposed to be.

How many women take child support and don't spend a dime of it on their
children?

I'm sure plenty do.  My brother in law, got a letter from his ex-wife,
shortly before he was to stop paying his child support.
She thanked him for helping her and her new husband buy a new boat.

Are custodial parents required to show proof that the child support is
indeed going towards the child?

Answer: No

Should they be required?

Answer: Absolutely

You're going to find more women objecting against these things than men,
because most women don't want to see that easy money taken away from them.

Both the mother *and* the father have responsibility for the child because
financial support is intended to benefit the child and not the parent.  When
it comes to either abortion or the decision to keep bear the child, there is
simply no way to have a 50/50 decision.  Either the child is born, or it is
not--and with only two parents, there is no way to say that each will have
an equal right to make this particular decision.

So you support discrimination.

Answer me something..

Women who collect child support and use it for things that are NOT for the
benefit of the child.
What's your opinion on those women?

Do you believe that a custodial parent should be required by a court order
to provide proof that the money the non-custodial parent is sending is going
for the child?

I do know of parents who take the child support and use it for things like,
drugs, personal things for themselves.  I know of one woman, who got
remarried, and her new husband is behind in his child support so she is
using the child support she is supposed to be getting and giving it to him
so he can get caught up because he is so far behind.  When the non custodial
parent was suspicious of this, he tried to get the courts to order she
showed proof that the money is going towards their child.  The court told
him he was basically out of luck and she didn't have to show proof.  Or like
in the case with my brother in law, his ex actually had the nerve to send
him a letter and thank him for the child support payments and that they were
able to get a nice new boat (her new husband and herself).  Oh yea, she is a
real winner isn't she?

&gt; It will never pass a court test.  This is just a political move and no

">

You don't know that, a lot of things are changing.  It will most likely be
defeated; however, it might also be amended and the language changed.
It could set up the next step, where a woman and man can make a legal
agreement that if she becomes pregnant and he wishes to raise the child and
support the child, she will give him the child and be free and clear. It
might also set up the next step where a woman and man can make a legal
agreement, that if she should become pregnant and he does not wish to have
children, she can have the child and he will be free and clear.

I see this as a stepping stone.  Dislike it as much as you want, but fathers
and men in general are starting to stand up and fight back against a system
that has been very discriminating against men for a long time now.  Fathers
especially, are going to gain more rights..it might not happen overnight,
these things do take time.

Right now as it stands, I see fathers facing discrimination in our court
systems and legal system. I've been waiting for men to start fighting back.

Feminist..you might as well get ready for some serious fighting ahead, your
days of rule and domination in our courts..are coming to an end.

There will be some equality, and I'm glad to be sitting on the sidelines
watching.

As far as this bill goes, I don't agree with a father having to give his
&quot;consent&quot;. However, I am all for a father having a say in the matter and a
chance to fight for the right to raise the child. After all, the unborn
child is half of his DNA and he should have a say in the matter.  This is
why I am a strong advocate of men and women deciding these matters before
the get serious in their relationship and having legal agreements before a
pregnancy occurs.

Yes, your brother-in-law's ex is &quot;a real winner&quot; (NOT!).  The amount awarded
for child support in most cases is so low that a child can't possibly reared
on that mount of money, so it's a moot point where that specific payment was
spent.  When larger amounts of money are involved, then we have the
possibility (and sometimes the reality) of one parent basically &quot;stealing&quot;
money that was intended for the child for their own personal gain.  Even
more tragic are those cases where children are actually neglected or have
substandard living because the custodial parent is using their money for
drugs or other personal gain.  However, this has nothing to do with the
original question because I would *also* support prosecution and loss of
custody for these low-life parents.  (Even worse for the child, of course,
is when *both* parents are low-life and our welfare system fails to protect
the child by removing all parental contact).

This is the kind of moronic commentary we have come to expect from you.  The
mother has the child, not you, no matter how hard you try.  It's the mother
decision.

How would you like it if you had appendicitice and you had to get mommy's
approval to have the operation?  What if mommy was a Christian Scientists?
You'd be dead.

&gt;&gt; Both the mother *and* the father have responsibility for the child
&gt;&gt; because financial support is intended to benefit the child and not the
&gt;&gt; parent. When it comes to either abortion or the decision to keep bear the
&gt;&gt; child, there is simply no way to have a 50/50 decision.  Either the child
&gt;&gt; is born, or it is not--and with only two parents, there is no way to say
&gt;&gt; that each will have an equal right to make this particular decision.

&gt;&gt; MaryL

&gt; So you support discrimination.

&gt; Answer me something..

&gt; Women who collect child support and use it for things that are NOT for the
&gt; benefit of the child.
&gt; What's your opinion on those women?

&gt; Do you believe that a custodial parent should be required by a court order
&gt; to provide proof that the money the non-custodial parent is sending is
&gt; going for the child?

&gt; I do know of parents who take the child support and use it for things
&gt; like, drugs, personal things for themselves.  I know of one woman, who got
&gt; remarried, and her new husband is behind in his child support so she is
&gt; using the child support she is supposed to be getting and giving it to him
&gt; so he can get caught up because he is so far behind.  When the non
&gt; custodial parent was suspicious of this, he tried to get the courts to
&gt; order she showed proof that the money is going towards their child.  The
&gt; court told him he was basically out of luck and she didn't have to show
&gt; proof.  Or like in the case with my brother in law, his ex actually had
&gt; the nerve to send him a letter and thank him for the child support
&gt; payments and that they were able to get a nice new boat (her new husband
&gt; and herself).  Oh yea, she is a real winner isn't she?
">

Typical right wing response.  One persons views become the views of every
one.

Look, child support mostly works, mostly.  When it doesn't then go to court
and keep going.  If you don't like the child support laws then write your
own and work to get them passed.

Pray tell, how does a man make a woman carry a child to term?  The woman is

can have one.

Already happening.  Remove your head from ass and take a look.  I take it
you haven't noticed the extremely capable *woman* with a rope wrapped around
her waist, diving into the Mississippi looking for bodies.

By the way, two of my three daughters purchased their own homes by
themselves, prior to marrying anyone.  And took those homes into their
marriages there-by in effect *giving* half of those previously purchased
assets to their future husbands.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A BILL

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     To enact section 2919.124 of the Revised Code relative to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; requiring
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;paternal consent before an abortion may be performed.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     (B)(1) When the fetus that is the subject of the procedure is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;viable, no person shall perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;woman without the written informed consent of the father of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fetus.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     (2) When the fetus that is the subject of the procedure is not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;viable, no person shall perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;woman without the written informed consent of the father of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fetus.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;     (C)(1) A pregnant woman seeking to abort her pregnancy shall
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;provide, in writing, the identity of the father of the fetus to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;person who is to perform or induce the abortion.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(snip)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-----------------------------------

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've been calling for this for years. As long as men are required to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pay
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;child support, they should have some say in whether the fetus is born
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;not.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It will never pass a court test.  This is just a political move and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; no
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one expects it to mean anything.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You don't know that, a lot of things are changing.  It will most
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; likely
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be defeated; however, it might also be amended and the language
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; changed.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It could set up the next step, where a woman and man can make a legal
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; agreement that if she becomes pregnant and he wishes to raise the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; child
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and support the child, she will give him the child and be free and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; clear.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It might also set up the next step where a woman and man can make a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; legal
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; agreement, that if she should become pregnant and he does not wish to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have children, she can have the child and he will be free and clear.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I see this as a stepping stone.  Dislike it as much as you want, but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fathers and men in general are starting to stand up and fight back
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; against a system that has been very discriminating against men for a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; long
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time now.  Fathers especially, are going to gain more rights..it might
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not happen overnight, these things do take time.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Right now as it stands, I see fathers facing discrimination in our
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; court
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; systems and legal system. I've been waiting for men to start fighting
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; back.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Feminist..you might as well get ready for some serious fighting ahead,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; your days of rule and domination in our courts..are coming to an end.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; There will be some equality, and I'm glad to be sitting on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sidelines
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; watching.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As far as this bill goes, I don't agree with a father having to give
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;consent&quot;. However, I am all for a father having a say in the matter
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a chance to fight for the right to raise the child. After all, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unborn
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; child is half of his DNA and he should have a say in the matter.  This
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; why I am a strong advocate of men and women deciding these matters
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; before
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the get serious in their relationship and having legal agreements
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; before
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a pregnancy occurs.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Pray tell, how does a man make a woman carry a child to term?

&gt;&gt; &quot;Pray tell, how does a man prevent a woman from having HIS CHILD
&gt;&gt; aborted?&quot;

&gt; Answer:  He can't.

He can in civilized societies.

Without her consent would indicate that the woman was ignorant of the fact
that sexual intercourse causes pregnancy.

That's idiotic and insulting--not to women in in general with this example
but to anyone (male or female) who risks their own lives in trying to help
others.  This type of effort is not about who can &quot;swim well.&quot;  It takes
training, skills, courage and dedication.

&gt;&gt;&gt;  I take it you haven't noticed the extremely capable *woman* with a rope
&gt;&gt;&gt; wrapped around
&gt;&gt;&gt; her waist, diving into the Mississippi looking for bodies.

&gt;&gt; My sister coulda outswam her.
&gt;&gt; Why are you so proud of that?
&gt;&gt; Men will tell you, BIG DEAL!
&gt;&gt; LOL!
&gt;&gt; Who couldn't do that anyway?
&gt;&gt; Wanna brag about helping people?
&gt;&gt; LOL!
&gt;&gt; Was it you who dove in?

&gt; That's idiotic and insulting--not to women in in general with this example
&gt; but to anyone (male or female) who risks their own lives in trying to help
&gt; others.  This type of effort is not about who can &quot;swim well.&quot;  It takes
&gt; training, skills, courage and dedication.

Do you mean to say that we as taxpayers who do not expect personnel who have

actions must bow down to them just because it is they who have that job at
our expense?

&gt; &gt;&gt;A BILL

&gt; &gt;&gt;(snip)

&gt; &gt;&gt;-----------------------------------

&gt; &gt;&gt;I've been calling for this for years. As long as men are required to pay
&gt; &gt;&gt;child support, they should have some say in whether the fetus is born or
&gt; &gt;&gt;not.

&gt; &gt; It will never pass a court test.  This is just a political move and no
&gt; &gt; one expects it to mean anything.

&gt; You don't know that, a lot of things are changing.  It will most likely be
&gt; defeated; however, it might also be amended and the language changed.
&gt; It could set up the next step, where a woman and man can make a legal
&gt; agreement that if she becomes pregnant and he wishes to raise the child and
&gt; support the child, she will give him the child and be free and clear. It
&gt; might also set up the next step where a woman and man can make a legal
&gt; agreement, that if she should become pregnant and he does not wish to have
&gt; children, she can have the child and he will be free and clear.

&gt; I see this as a stepping stone.  Dislike it as much as you want, but fathers
&gt; and men in general are starting to stand up and fight back against a system
&gt; that has been very discriminating against men for a long time now.  Fathers
&gt; especially, are going to gain more rights..it might not happen overnight,
&gt; these things do take time.

&gt; Right now as it stands, I see fathers facing discrimination in our court
&gt; systems and legal system. I've been waiting for men to start fighting back.

&gt; Feminist..you might as well get ready for some serious fighting ahead, your
&gt; days of rule and domination in our courts..are coming to an end.

&gt; There will be some equality, and I'm glad to be sitting on the sidelines
&gt; watching.

&gt; As far as this bill goes, I don't agree with a father having to give his
&gt; &quot;consent&quot;. However, I am all for a father having a say in the matter and a
&gt; chance to fight for the right to raise the child. After all, the unborn
&gt; child is half of his DNA and he should have a say in the matter.

Is that why you forgive your wife for her abortion? Is it because out
of 100%, 0% is yours?

Absolutely not.  It is *explaining* that 'were you to remove your head from

We *females* are waiting for our male counter-parts to 'pull their own

though.

If you want to break everything down to *absolute even-ness* then *some of*

&gt;simply no way to have a 50/50 decision.  Either the child is born, or it is
&gt;not--and with only two parents, there is no way to say that each will have
&gt;an equal right to make this particular decision.

Then there must not be equal responsibility.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;     (B)(1) When the fetus that is the subject of the procedure is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;viable, no person shall perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;provide, in writing, the identity of the father of the fetus to the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;person who is to perform or induce the abortion.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(snip)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;-----------------------------------

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I've been calling for this for years. As long as men are required to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;pay
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;child support, they should have some say in whether the fetus is born
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;or
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;not.

&gt;&gt; &gt; It will never pass a court test.  This is just a political move and no
&gt;&gt; &gt; one expects it to mean anything.

&gt;&gt; You don't know that, a lot of things are changing.  It will most likely
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; defeated; however, it might also be amended and the language changed.
&gt;&gt; It could set up the next step, where a woman and man can make a legal
&gt;&gt; agreement that if she becomes pregnant and he wishes to raise the child
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; support the child, she will give him the child and be free and clear. It
&gt;&gt; might also set up the next step where a woman and man can make a legal
&gt;&gt; agreement, that if she should become pregnant and he does not wish to
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; children, she can have the child and he will be free and clear.

&gt;&gt; I see this as a stepping stone.  Dislike it as much as you want, but
&gt;&gt; fathers
&gt;&gt; and men in general are starting to stand up and fight back against a
&gt;&gt; system
&gt;&gt; that has been very discriminating against men for a long time now.
&gt;&gt; Fathers
&gt;&gt; especially, are going to gain more rights..it might not happen overnight,
&gt;&gt; these things do take time.

&gt;&gt; Right now as it stands, I see fathers facing discrimination in our court
&gt;&gt; systems and legal system. I've been waiting for men to start fighting
&gt;&gt; back.

&gt;&gt; Feminist..you might as well get ready for some serious fighting ahead,
&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt; days of rule and domination in our courts..are coming to an end.

&gt;&gt; There will be some equality, and I'm glad to be sitting on the sidelines
&gt;&gt; watching.

&gt;&gt; As far as this bill goes, I don't agree with a father having to give his
&gt;&gt; &quot;consent&quot;. However, I am all for a father having a say in the matter and
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; chance to fight for the right to raise the child. After all, the unborn
&gt;&gt; child is half of his DNA and he should have a say in the matter.

&gt; Is that why you forgive your wife for her abortion? Is it because out
&gt; of 100%, 0% is yours?

Shouldn't the name of the man who impregnated the female be recorded
regardless of the pregnancy?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Pray tell, how does a man prevent a woman from having HIS CHILD

&gt; &gt; Answer:  He can't.

&gt; He can in civilized societies.

No, he cannot.  You are speaking of uncivilized societies that treat
women as chattel and property.  In a civilized society, women are nor
dependent on men, are not their property, and are not required to get
their permission for anything, especially things that deal with her
body.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Then you are a &quot;pimpy illicit ignorant conartists&quot; since you are the

women should be forced by law to be involuntary servants of the state

pregnant.

If you notice, I am not demanding that women be forced to do anything.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; and he cannot force her to suffer just because he demands it.

&gt; He isn't in her womb.

Not required.  If he is trying to prevent her from getting an abortion
that she desires, then he is trying to force her to do as he demands.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; He isn't using any threats of force like you wimpy pimpy ignorant armed
&gt; treasonous gellin' like a felon criminals are using against LIVING PEOPLE!

I have not been making ant threats of force at all against anyone.  I
have been advocating that women that are pregnant be allowed to make
her own decision about her own pregnancy without any force or coercion
present.

You, however, are the one that does not want to allow her any
decision.  You want to force her to do as you demand, and continue her
pregnancy whether she wants to or not.  Your ad hominems describe
yourself, not me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The woman is having the child,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;The Child&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; Guess what looney tunes:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;The Child&quot; is NOT the sole property of the pregnant female.

&gt; &gt; However, the embryo/fetus is using the woman's body for its own
&gt; &gt; purposes and, in an unwanted pregnancy, without her consent.

&gt; Without her consent would indicate that the woman was ignorant of the fact
&gt; that sexual intercourse causes pregnancy.
">

No, without her consent means that she does not consent to her body
being used against her will by the fetus for its development.  She
does not consent to continuing the pregnancy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And, that would make all you pro-choicers look like fools to assume that you
&gt; want everyone to think of women as dumb bimbos.
">

Since your assumption is faulty, your result is faulty.  Pro-choice
advocates do not look like fools since we do not assume that the
choice to have sex implies that she chooses to continue the pregnancy
later.  They are separate decisions.  And the use of contraception
implies that she did not consent to become pregnant when she was
having sex as well.

You want to treat women like chattel rather than like people.  You are
the one that thinks that women are dumb bimbos that cannot think for
themselves and must do as you demand.  You are the one that has no
respect for women.  You are the fool.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; And since the woman that it is using is not anyone's property, she gets to
&gt; &gt; decide how and why her body is used, and by whom.

&gt; Wimpy pimpy ignorant idiot response.
">

Your statement only supports my statement that you view women as
chattel, the property of men, rather than their own people.  You are
showing your lack of respect for women, as well as your desire to
control them.  Again, your ad hominems describe you, not me.

What rebellion?  I am not rebelling at all.  And your opinion of what
is and is not treason does not match the actual definitions.  Telling
you the facts and disagreeing with your positions is not treason at
all, and is protected by the First Amendment.

There is no &quot;roevwade criminal conspiracy&quot;.  That is one of your
delusions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Which it is not.  Your ignorance and delusions do not make abortion
into &quot;cowardice and treason&quot; just because you claim it is.  Especially
when it is not.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The law that precedes roevwade deems it as such.
">

The law that precedes Roe vs. Wade does not matter, since it is the
current law is what is applicable.  And the law that preceded Roe vs.
Wade NEVER deemed abortion to be treason since abortion has NEVER been
considered to be warring against the USA.  And cowardice cannot be
determined by criminal or civil law.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Then it is not a child since it was not born.  And since no person can
use another person's body without the used person's continuing

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; takes
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; training, skills, courage and dedication.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Do you mean to say that we as taxpayers who do not expect personnel who
&gt;&gt; have
&gt;&gt; &gt; been trained and provided the necessary tools and equipment to perform
&gt;&gt; such
&gt;&gt; &gt; actions must bow down to them just because it is they who have that job
&gt;&gt; &gt; at
&gt;&gt; &gt; our expense?

&gt;&gt; Absolutely not.  It is *explaining* that 'were you to remove your head
&gt;&gt; from
&gt;&gt; your ass occasionally, you'd notice that there are females working in
&gt;&gt; pretty
&gt;&gt; much every job men are employed at, and pulling their own weight in those
&gt;&gt; jobs.

&gt;&gt; We *females* are waiting for our male counter-parts to 'pull their own
&gt;&gt; weight' in the childcare duties that should be shared by both *parents*
&gt;&gt; though.

&gt;&gt; If you want to break everything down to *absolute even-ness* then *some
&gt;&gt; of*
&gt;&gt; you guys are falling far short in the cooking, cleaning, laundry and
&gt;&gt; childcare depts.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;person who is to perform or induce the abortion.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;(snip)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-----------------------------------

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I've been calling for this for years. As long as men are required
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pay
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;child support, they should have some say in whether the fetus is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;born
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or not.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; It will never pass a court test.  This is just a political move
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; no one expects it to mean anything.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You don't know that, a lot of things are changing.  It will most
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; likely
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be defeated; however, it might also be amended and the language
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; changed.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It could set up the next step, where a woman and man can make a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; legal
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; agreement that if she becomes pregnant and he wishes to raise the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; child
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and support the child, she will give him the child and be free and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; clear.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It might also set up the next step where a woman and man can make a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; legal
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; agreement, that if she should become pregnant and he does not wish
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have children, she can have the child and he will be free and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; clear.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I see this as a stepping stone.  Dislike it as much as you want,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fathers and men in general are starting to stand up and fight back
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; against a system that has been very discriminating against men for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; long
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time now.  Fathers especially, are going to gain more rights..it
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; might
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not happen overnight, these things do take time.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Right now as it stands, I see fathers facing discrimination in our
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; court
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; systems and legal system. I've been waiting for men to start
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fighting
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; back.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Feminist..you might as well get ready for some serious fighting
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ahead,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; your days of rule and domination in our courts..are coming to an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; end.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; There will be some equality, and I'm glad to be sitting on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sidelines watching.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As far as this bill goes, I don't agree with a father having to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; give
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;consent&quot;. However, I am all for a father having a say in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; matter
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a chance to fight for the right to raise the child. After all, the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unborn
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; child is half of his DNA and he should have a say in the matter.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; why I am a strong advocate of men and women deciding these matters
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; before
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the get serious in their relationship and having legal agreements
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; before a pregnancy occurs.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Pray tell, how does a man make a woman carry a child to term?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Pray tell, how does a man prevent a woman from having HIS CHILD
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; aborted?&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; Answer:  He can't.

&gt;&gt; He can in civilized societies.

&gt; No, he cannot.

Because civilized societies consider a woman to be an equal to the
man, and able to make her own decisions about her own life and own
body.  In civilized societies, the woman is not the chattel of any
man, and no man can force the woman to do something that she does not
want to, especially something that is painful, costly, injurious,
potentially deadly, and potentially ruinous to her life.

And none of your ad hominems apply to me, since they are all the
opposite of the truth.

Again, you are not describing me.  I am no thief, and I consider love,

&gt; That much is certain.

What is certain is that reality is the opposite of what you usually
claim it is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;  In a civilized society,

&gt; People such as yourself are relegated to very low status.
">

No, that would be you.  I would have a very high status since I am
very intelligent, well educated, a veteran, and a productive member of
society.  You are none of those things.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; women are nor dependent on men,

&gt; except for $$$$, iyo, huh?
">

Wrong, as usual.  Women should not be dependent on men for the money
either.  You are the one that wants women to be subservient to me, not
me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; are not their property,

&gt; Another idea that you have a right to meddle with men's property other than
&gt; your own.
">

Women are not men's property.  Perhaps you should explain why you
think of women as being men's property?  Why are you so misogynistic?
Why do you hate women so much and want them to suffer and do as you
demand?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; and are not required to get their permission for anything, especially
&gt; &gt; things that deal with her body.

&gt; Bullshit, you adulterous criminal advocate.
">

Again, you show that you are misogynistic, and that you have no
respect for women at all.  Why should a woman need any man's
permission to do anything, especially things that deal with her body?
She is not a slave.  She is not anyone's property.

And where do you see me advocating adultery or any criminal
activities?  Disagreeing with you is not against the law, and is
protected by the Constitution.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Almost everything you type makes you look like a real criminal.
">

Actually, nothing that I type means me look like you, a real
criminal.  I have not advocated any breaking of the law.  I am
advocating upholding the law, and making any needed changes according
to the legal methods that are available, many of which are outlined in
the Constitution.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  I take it you haven't noticed the extremely capable *woman* with a
&gt; &gt; rope
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; wrapped around
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; her waist, diving into the Mississippi looking for bodies.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; My sister coulda outswam her.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why are you so proud of that?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Men will tell you, BIG DEAL!
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; LOL!
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Who couldn't do that anyway?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Wanna brag about helping people?
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; LOL!
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Was it you who dove in?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That's idiotic and insulting--not to women in in general with this
&gt; &gt; example
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but to anyone (male or female) who risks their own lives in trying to
&gt; &gt; help
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; others.  This type of effort is not about who can &quot;swim well.&quot;  It
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; takes
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; training, skills, courage and dedication.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Do you mean to say that we as taxpayers who do not expect personnel who
&gt; &gt; have
&gt; &gt;&gt; been trained and provided the necessary tools and equipment to perform
&gt; &gt; such
&gt; &gt;&gt; actions must bow down to them just because it is they who have that job
&gt; &gt;&gt; at
&gt; &gt;&gt; our expense?

&gt; &gt; Absolutely not.  It is *explaining* that 'were you to remove your head
&gt; &gt; from
&gt; &gt; your ass occasionally, you'd notice that there are females working in
&gt; &gt; pretty
&gt; &gt; much every job men are employed at, and pulling their own weight in
those
&gt; &gt; jobs.

&gt; I have worked with females before; but not many of them at all who did the
&gt; same jobs as me or my male friends.
&gt; And, I am totally in agreement with equal pay for equal labor.

&gt; &gt; We *females* are waiting for our male counter-parts to 'pull their own
&gt; &gt; weight' in the childcare duties that should be shared by both *parents*
&gt; &gt; though.

&gt; So, start lobbying against divorce and abortion on demand.
">

Perhaps if you chose your *partners* with more care in the first place,
these *issues* wouldn't be of such importance to you?   Abortion is a legal
right, and should remain so.  If you don't want to worry about it, wear a
condom.  Simple solution.   As for divorce, I've been married to the same
man for 35 plus years.  No one forces us to make the choices we do.  Pick
you partner with your *big head*.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; If you want to break everything down to *absolute even-ness* then *some
&gt; &gt; of*
&gt; &gt; you guys are falling far short in the cooking, cleaning, laundry and
&gt; &gt; childcare depts.

&gt; well, I like evenness.
&gt; And, there is nothing wrong with one party bearing a larger load in
&gt; situations where it must occur and no dissent develops, male or female.
&gt; I mean if you want to pick up an equal number of fifty pound bags someday
&gt; let me know.
">

Mostly everything in our marriage has been 50/50, be it yard work, post hole
digging when we put up a fence to protect our children when they were young,
etc.  Although there are something things my husband hates to do, painting
being one of them.  I, on the other hand, enjoy painting.  It relaxes me.
So I probably do 75 to 80% of any painting duties.  Cooking, we pretty much
share 50/50.  Cleaning though, is a bit one-sided as hubby doesn't appear to
*notice* dirt, dog hair, fuzz balls, etc.   Probably a problem males have
with their eye-sight.  Childcare duties were another of those *lop-sided*
chores, with by far the majority falling to my side of the arrangement.  All
in all though, we've found things to average out over the years.  Again, if
you choose the right partner in the beginning, you wouldn't have any of
those *pesky issues* you find so annoying.

ymmv,
