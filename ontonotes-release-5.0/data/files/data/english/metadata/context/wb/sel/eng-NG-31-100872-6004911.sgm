Hi I have 2 guineas who are only 3 months old - can anyone tell me how
often they need their claws trimming and also how old they might be
before they need trimming.  This is the first time we have had any pets
so are learning all the time.

I trim my pigs' nails about once a month.  You'll probably want to
start clipping soon now, even if their nails really don't need it you
can just take off a little and get them used to it.  I use a regular
human fingernail clipper.  Read through:

If you're a new owner, I strongly suggest you read through this

If you are new to the game I would be tempted to visit the vet first and ask
them to show you the ropes. They are quite delicate (GPs) and if they are
scared they might jump and hurt themselves.

Best of luck when you do get into it though! Ours is a nightmare and manages
to pull his feet away just as you are about to close the clippers!

I just assisted my wife in doing this to our piggie Ginger at lunchtime
today.   She was quite co-operative and can usually be fairly skittish.  I
was the one with a good grip on her, and reassuring words in her ear (they
do help if said in a low tone).  It's been about 2.5 months since her last
clipping and I found one claw had nails that were waaay too long.

We got our vet to show us how he did it, and he sold us some clippers I
think that are made for small animals such as GP's.  They cost nearly $10
but do the job quickly.

Make sure there is a lot of light so you can see where the quick is...we
won't attempt it in the evening because there's not enough light, we find.

Now, to examine my other two...
