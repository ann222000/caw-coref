American Mugabe

By David Michael Green
Created Apr 2 2007 - 9:22am

Most Americans really don't understand their president.

And, no, I'm not even talking about the thirty percent or so who still give
him a positive approval rating. I'm not sure those folks understand
anything.

Among the remaining seventy percent, however, I would estimate that the vast
bulk still have not fully apprehended what we're dealing with here. Because
what we're dealing with is nothing short of an American Mugabe.

Even among the vast majority who disapprove of Bush's performance as
president, the typical sentiments expressed toward him are exactly that -
essentially characterized by a disapproval of his performance. It's easy to
see Bush as inept, unintelligent, stubborn, lazy and dogmatic, because he is
certainly all those things, and he should therefore be seen in that accurate
light.

But this view of Bush is also, paradoxically, highly inaccurate, because it
is so radically incomplete. It is as if one were to observe a vicious dog
once only, while it was at rest. Since it is true that the animal sometimes
rests, the perception of it as a (sometimes) peaceful creature would in one
sense be quite accurate. But, by virtue of what was omitted, that perception
would also be simultaneously woefully incomplete, and therefore woefully
inaccurate.

Bush is an arrogant and incapable buffoon, ridiculously puffed up with his
rigidly held assurance of his own greatness by definition (as in, "I know
I'm doing the right thing - and God agrees when I talk to him - so therefore
I am, any and all evidence to the contrary.") Most Americans now see that,
even if they were embarrassingly slow to get there (and they were).

But what is more distressing is that the crimes of this president run
infinitely deeper than this, to the point where, ironically, his more
mundane failures actually serve as something of an alibi and a cover for
what 'surges' powerfully below.

Failure, laziness, arrogance - these are crimes of character and ability.
And while most Americans wouldn't want a casual acquaintance - let alone a
president - to possess those qualities, they still don't come anywhere near
to defining the essence of George W. Bush, because they ignore the question
of motive. To see only these aspects of Bush, however unflattering they
truly are, is to see the dog at rest. There is much, much more to observe.

But Americans are well-positioned to not make those observations, for at
least three powerful reasons.

The first is our training. We are raised to revere our presidents,
generally. Americans have no equivalent to the British Queen or the German
president as head of state. There is no symbolic position here that sits
above politics and embodies the hopes and aspirations of the nation. All of
that, along with the more tangible governing powers of a chief executive,
are invested in our president, and while we may often disagree with the
president, or disparage his moral failings, most of us are quite unprepared
to imagine that his motives are other than pure.

Very few of us could conceive of a president who was unpatriotic or, worse
yet, a traitor, unless faced with massive empirical evidence which was
undeniable. (And which many of the thirty percent would, in fact,
nevertheless still continue to deny - provided, of course, that the
president in question continued to mutter the proper religious shibboleths,
and bought-off the right members of our pathetic Pantheon of Piety.)

The second reason that we are unable to fully perceive the true nature of
George W. Bush is because Karl Rove has picked up from where the default
starting place of this presumptive presidential reverence leaves off and
pumped us to the gills with a full-court press Madison Avenue mega-campaign,
extolling the fabricated virtues of this particular president. Every other
reference, in every single speech, is to 9/11. Every photo-op has soldiers
and flags in the background. (Though maimed troops are carefully excluded.
But thanks for your service, guys. Really!)

If you didn't know better (which is precisely the intent), you'd think that
George Bush was a tough combat veteran (he's not) who flew headlong into
danger on 9/11 without regard for his personal safety (he didn't), in order
to begin his undaunted mission to guarantee America's security (he isn't).
You're also meant to believe that he bravely went to Iraq to fight terrorism
over there rather than here at home. Never mind that there wasn't any there
before, and that our own intelligence agencies have concluded that we have
created the world's most efficient terrorist factory by our invasion of the
country.

In fact, the only reason Dear Leader himself ever went to Iraq was to get
his picture taken holding a plastic turkey, before getting the hell out of
there as fast as he could. It would not surprise me in the slightest to
learn that the man holding the plastic turkey was a plastic presidential
stand-in as well. Don't forget that this is a president who ran from Vietnam
to the Texas Air National Guard, ran from 9/11 to Nebraska, and had to have
his presidential debate responses radioed in to him. Like Strawberry Fields,
when it comes to this guy, nothing is real. Forever. Rove has this faux hero
pumped full to the brim with patriotism enhancement drugs, the political
equivalent of Barry Bonds.

As if all that doesn't make it hard enough, there is a third reason we don't
think of Bush as anything more than inept, foolish and arrogant, and that is
because many of us just can't go there. When very young Americans experience
their initial political socialization, their first awareness is of the
president. And, as we know from research findings, that apprehension is of a
daddy figure who will keep us safe and protected.

In much the same way, therefore, that a father molesting his child
represents the deepest possible violation of the trust that the vulnerable
invest in their supposed protector, few Americans are psychologically
prepared to imagine their president as something far, far worse than a fool.
That scary possibility cuts deep, right to the existential core, and too
many of us have too many layers of psychological Kevlar protecting that
vulnerable center to ever penetrate. Cave, hic dragones.

That possibility is a lot more easily contemplated, however, when
considering somebody else's president. So let us strip away these
obstructions to visual clarity, let us begin with a fresh piece of paper,
and let us recast this presidency on the basis of its record. And let's do
so without biasing suppositions of any sort influencing our vision, much as
we might were we to observe the leader of a foreign state of whom, and of
which, we know little.

Say, Zimbabwe, for example.

Imagine that you knew nothing about the president of Zimbabwe, but that you
were informed that he liked to steal elections.

Imagine that you also learned that he was destroying civil liberties in his
country, jailing people without charge, without legal counsel, without
habeas corpus rights. And spying on tens of thousands of citizens without
warrants.

Imagine that you found out that this Zimbabwean president was torturing and
even murdering innocent captives in illegal prisons.

What if, additionally, you found out that he was kidnaping foreigners and
dumping them in secret jails elsewhere, so that they could be tortured even
more egregiously?

Suppose you also learned that this president refused to fight for his
homeland when he was a young man, but was now fabricating from whole cloth
justifications for sending his countrymen off to war.

And that he talked all day long about what great heroes these soldiers were,
and how anyone who criticized his policies was not supporting the troops,
while simultaneously failing to provide sufficient armor and equipment to
protect them.

But that he was nevertheless doling out heaping scoops of the public
treasury (and borrowing more) to well-connected mercenary and construction
companies who do nothing and are paid exorbitantly via no-bid contracts.

What if you heard that this president staffed his administration with
cronies who would do anything he asked of them, but nothing for the people?

Imagine that these cronies stole everything in the country that wasn't
bolted down, and gave it to the president's already ueber-wealthy
supporters.

What if this president rearranged the tax structure so that in the future
the middle class would have to pay today's and tomorrow's taxes for the
wealthy, plus interest?

What if he told the most outrageous lies about the environmental destruction
he was supporting, in order to protect the profits of massively rich oil
companies?

What if he was too lazy to do anything about the warnings he received prior
to his country being attacked, and instead remained on vacation for a solid
month?

What if he remained on vacation again, when one of his country's greatest
cities drowned, and was left to struggle on its own thereafter?

Suppose his policies made Zimbabwe one of the most reviled countries of the
world.

What if those policies encouraged the international proliferation of
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction?

Imagine all of these things, and then ask yourself: What would you call
someone with a record like that?

No matter where he lived, you'd call him a predatory kleptocrat. And a
traitor.

If this president lived in Zimbabwe, you'd call him Robert Mugabe.

But he doesn't. He lives here.

So call him American Mugabe.

And what is more, he knows it, too. Americans may be fooled (by him), but
this president knew exactly what he came to Washington to do, and exactly
what would happen if he got caught at his pillaging of the commonweal.

Anyone who thinks the latest scandal concerning the firing of the US
Attorneys is some random anomaly of some sort hasn't been paying attention.
It is perfectly of a piece with everything this administration has done
since coming to office.

Before they had even located the men's room of their new office suites, they
had already withdrawn the United States from the International Criminal
Court treaty. Not content with that, they then began hammering vulnerable
countries throughout the world to exempt Americans within their borders from
jurisdiction of the Court, using extortion racket techniques any two-bit
thug from Brooklyn would find painfully familiar.

Next, Bush unilaterally changed the traditional rules for the handling of
presidential papers, issuing an executive order giving himself complete
control of his papers, and those of every other president, for as long as he
wants.

Then this junta proceeded to conduct the affairs of their administration
with probably more secrecy than any presidency in American history, making
the regime in North Korea look like a battered information-leaking sieve by
comparison.

Since then they've loaded up the courts with right-wing Borkians whose main
qualification for office is a fawning adoration of unlimited executive power
(as long as Bush is the executive, of course). Does anyone seriously
question that that was Harriet Miers' only real 'qualification' earning her
a Supreme Court nomination?

Now they're firing US Attorneys who aren't quite Bushist enough, and
replacing them with any unqualified hack who can be found, provided they
possess unshakable loyalty to the Dauphin.

Hmmm. Anybody seeing a pattern here?

If Americans could get beyond their training, beyond Rove's marketing
campaign, and beyond the psychological horrors of first degree cognitive
dissonance, what they'd see is a president who - like Mugabe in Zimbabwe -
came to town to fill his pockets, and just as fast as he could.

And they'd see a president who knew precisely what he was doing, and as such
took every conceivable precaution to make sure his tracks were covered, and
that no criminal justice institution could touch him.

But justice might just find him, after all.

I don't think the American public is in any mood now to make him Senator for
Life, with full immunity privileges, like Chile did to buy out Pinochet. And
I don't think the next president - even a Republican (yeah, right) - is
going to be much inclined to throw a pardon in the direction of this
radioactive sinking ship of a larcenous former president, this Enron of the
Oval Office.

Watch out. With any luck, American Mugabe might just become American
Milosevic.
