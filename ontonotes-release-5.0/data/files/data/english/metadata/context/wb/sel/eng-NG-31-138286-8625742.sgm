IDEAS LIVE FOREVER: IN MEMORY OF RUTH FIRST

Who was Ruth First?

Ruth First was the National Secretary of the Young Communist League in the
1940's. Together with Joe Slovo, Esther Barsel, Ahmed Kathrada and many more
resuscitated the YCL. The activities they were involved in included ensuring
that there is access to skills development, equal access to education and
the sale of Umsebenzi.

She was born in Johannesburg on the 4th of May 1925 into a communist family.
Both her parents were founder members of the Communist Party of South
Africa. She was an active journalist, writer and activist. Amongst the
people she studied with included Nelson Mandela.

During the era of Ruth First in the YCL, one of the critical debates that
were undertaken at the time included that of the relationship between the
YCL and the SACP. First and the YCL cadres insisted on an autonomous youth
formation with an independent voice and programme which will introduce the
youth of the country to the strategic vision of socialism and the ideas of
the SACP.

First was killed in 1982, 17 August as a result of a letter bomb that was
sent by the Apartheid regime. The person responsible for her assassination
was Craig Williamson, former Apartheid operative. The fact that First was
one of the targeted leaders of the revolutionary movement shows the extent
which she was a threat to the regime.

First was a leading cadre of the YCL and SACP at the time of the passing of
the Suppression of Communism Act, a law that made it illegal for anyone to
be part and parcel of the activities of the Communist Party of South Africa.

Why should we commemorate Ruth First?

Firstly, as a leader of the YCL and an icon for the struggle of the
liberation of blacks in general and African people in particular. Secondly,
any revolution that forgets its leaders and heroines is doomed to failure as
it will easily forget the struggle which they pursued. The most important
element of commemorating our fallen heroes is not to merely sing praises
about them, but also to understand the context within which they lived and
their world outlook at the time.

The life of Ruth First should also be celebrated as a woman who, in the
midst of male domination and patriarchal preoccupation, she claimed her
space and contributed towards the liberation of our people.

The ideas of Ruth First, as Thomas Sankara proclaimed, should never die.
Although the apartheid regime thought that by killing her they are killing
the ideas she stood for, we should ensure that we keep them alive and hand
them over from one generation to another generation.

What struggle did Ruth First pursue?

Ruth First was in the first instance dedicated to the overthrow of the
Apartheid regime. She was committed to the pursuance of the National
Democratic Revolution, whose main goal was the liberation of Africans in
particular and blacks in general from national, gender and class oppression.
In the ultimate, First believed that the NDR is the shortest route towards
socialism. She at all times articulated the revolutionary link between the
national, the gender and the class struggle.

As a member of the SACP, First also believed in the ideals of socialism. She
believed and struggled for an end of exploitation of one person by another.
She struggled for the creation of a society where from equal work there
shall be an equal stake for all.

In that context, for us socialism should be about land redistribution.
Without land, there is no food as we cannot plant. Without land there is no
spring water. There is no meat and other meat products as we cannot have
kraals. Therefore, the struggle for the common ownership of land by all,
held in trust by the state, should be our primary struggle.

Taking Forward the Memory of Ruth First on Education

The kind of education that we receive already determines the kind of society
that we seek to build. All education systems are an embryo for the defense
of and taking forward a form of social and productive relations. Under
Apartheid, it was Bantu education whose main object was to inculcate the
idea that Apartheid was best under the circumstances. Today, the learning
environment entrenches fear of authority and suppresses critical knowledge
and learning. Learners are taught to accept what the teacher teaches. The
classroom is regarded as the only place for learning, thus, everything else
outside the classroom is sometimes regarded not as education. If a teacher
says 1+1=3, then so be it. Free education for the YCL is also about the
freeness of the ideas expressed and the critical nature that it should
unearth amongst students.

Taking Forward the Memory of Ruth First on Housing.

The housing question is a pressure question. Prices of houses are determined
by the market. The state has no say in how much a house of such and such a
number of rooms, in such and such a place will cost. There are millions in
our country who have no houses, not because there are no houses, but because
they cannot afford them. Many houses in the suburbs are left unoccupied with
a board written FOR SALE. Mansions costing millions. The poor should resolve
the housing problem through mass struggles by actually moving into these
houses.

How should we take forward the Memory of Ruth First?

In taking forward the memory of Ruth First, we have the challenge of
ensuring that we make the post-Apartheid state workable. This democracy that
we have is as a result of the effort of cadres such as Ruth First who
believed in the will of the people. She dedicated and gave her life for 1994
to happen. She ensured that it becomes a reality for all of us.

Also critical in remembering First is to ensure that we go all out to the
youth and the working class and explain what the programme of the SACP is.
It should not be about complex concepts and long quotations from Marx and
Lenin. It should be about exposing the inequities in our society. It is
about exposing the fact that we are living in a world where some people die
because they have malnutrition, whilst others die because they are obesity.
We need to go out there and say that a better and just world is possible. We
need to send a message that we have enough resources to feed every one and
that it can only be through struggle that we can evenly distribute these
resources.

We must ask critical questions. We should demand to know why there are
schools for the rich and why there are schools for the poor. Why are those
who relax in their offices are the ones who earn more, whilst the actual
work is done by those who sweat? Why is it that it is the workers who build
the cars, who mine the gold, who build the mansions and yet it is they who
cannot afford even the cheapest of cars, the lowest of carats and smallest
of houses? We need to ask these questions as an entry for our political
education. We then need to say what should be done, together with the
working class and the youth. This is how we should take forward the memory
of Ms Ruth First. That's the Bottomline, cos the YCL said so!

Viewpoint : Tumelo Makae

Response to &quot;A Revolution Compromised&quot; [The Bottomline - Issue 18, Vol 4: 2
August 2007]

&quot;The thesis (apartheid status quo that need to be changed), antithesis
(inclusive democracy, that is, equal opportunities in the politics, access
to land, economic wealth of the country, citizenry, welfare and basic human
rights), synthesis (the methods to attain inclusive democracy)&quot;.

Apartheid and its legacy have been regarded as being active and the effects
can be witnessed on the economy, political freedom land issues as the three
basis of the South African revolution. Linked to the basis of revolution are
effects of the old regime on the current regime. That is the challenges of
democratic state in reversing the special effects of apartheid on the
political, economy and land issues.

Needless much to say, this paper merely seeks to engage an article &quot;A
revolution compromised: Is South African revolution an abandoned wagon left
to steer itself to an unspecified destination?&quot; and perhaps provide
contribution on the current status quo.

A conclusion would be based on the agreement with the article &quot;A revolution
compromised: Is South African revolution an abandoned wagon left to steer
itself to an unspecified destination?&quot;

The politics of South Africa were not inherently black and white, rather
they (politics) were based on who arrive first at a particular destination
as a result if you were to arrive at the same time with the opponent then a
battle can be broken. Again the politics were based on the arrival of
resources. Lessons can be learned from the Xhosa – Afrikaner battle in
Eastern Cape. In contrast to the tribal battles and wars, the Anglo – Boer
war in 1902 must not be left behind as we are engaging with the politics of
resources. This war was based on two nations clutches.

In the interest of apartheid is introduced in 1948. There are several
reasons for apartheid to strife. First, it was to ensure that white settlers
are prioritised on the economy, land and political affairs of South Africa.
Second, it was to ensure that the political hegemony of the Afrikaners is
protected and thirdly, to ensure that blacks remain away from core
operations apartheid.

In 1994 the democratic state was declared. It was only by this time that
freedom to all who belong to South Africa became beneficiary. The democratic
state introduced many programmes to roll back the frontiers of apartheid. In
the inception it introduced the Constitution as the supreme law in the
country. It further introduced the economic policy which was based on the
empowerment of the disadvantaged communities (Reconstruction and Development
Programme (RDP)).

Integral to the RDP was a programme of Masakhane, which was based on the
distribution of the economy and ensuring that developmental programmes are
initiated by the people themselves. In it (Masakhane) there was a collective
approach on the economy.

I would agree with the author that land reforms slow in terms of ensuring
that people of South Africa are still confronted by crisis of accessing
land. However, challenge to provide land is whether they are able to use it
effective for economic reasons. I would not agree that &quot;blacks are good farm
workers and poor farmers&quot;, rather usage of land for economic recovery
remains critical to land issue.

The current approach towards the economy on the Black Economic Empowerment
(BEE) has done no wrong; rather it has been a vehicle by the few to enrich
themselves. For obvious reasons, it has been designed to ensure that the
majority of the disadvantaged communities benefit in the proceedings of BEE.
In a more comprehensive manner, the Mid Term Vision of the Party reflects
full participation of the disadvantaged groups in the economy. Hence it
speaks of cooperatives as a mode of economic participation. However, the
reality of the economy in where in the world will have the existence of
class and their approach to the economy.

Perhaps if Sebake would have indicated the historical challenges of
apartheid that seems to be apparent to date would have been something.
Again, what is the relation to the Communist Manifesto (CM) and the
apartheid, on the other hand democracy? Because Communist Manifesto reflects
the tale of class oppression in which the societies were differentiated into
&quot;the bourgeoisie&quot; and &quot;proletariat&quot;. It further indicates how communist
should view the world should and reflect on the current realities of their
struggles in day to day operations.

We further need to note the thesis that the author is referring to; as to
whether is it based on a theoretical analysis of South African politics. In
this case there has been a lot that has changed from the theory of apartheid
being active. In fact there is no link between the thesis, anti – thesis and
synthesis as the author has been able to reflect of the occurrences of
history, current and most definitely future prospects on the democratic
state.

From the understandings of the CM itself, caution should always be applied
as it reflects the dominance of one class to another and should such be
abolished by a progressive movement. Such a movement stand to benefit and
enjoy the influence it has on the people it seeks to lead. In this regard,
politics within the African National Congress (ANC), South African Communist
Party (SACP) and Congress of South African Trade Union (COSATU) have been
far progressive in seeking to change the so called status quo of apartheid.

To attest to the above statement, the realities of the Freedom Charter and
the approach of the CM in reforming South Africa have been true to the
convictions of the existence of the democratic state. This again is
supported by the National Democratic Revolution (NDR) which has reflections
of the motive force. Such a motive force stand to benefit out the gains of
the NDR once it has been completed.

The reality of our struggles as the Young Communist League (YCL) will always
be based on the historical reflects that the people of South Africa have
created. Therefore, there has never been a situation where the revolution
being compromised. As a result a democratic state has been achieved on the
basis of the Freedom Charter and the unfolding NDR. Again, the revolution
continues and such it cannot be on the abandoned wagon left to steer itself
to an unspecified destination.
