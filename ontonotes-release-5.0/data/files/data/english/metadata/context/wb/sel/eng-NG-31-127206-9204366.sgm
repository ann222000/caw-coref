It's called not wanting to hit into a double play.

Still, it was pretty weak.

Yeah.  If they assume they will fail then why do they bother to play
in the first place?

That's a lame question.  Lester probably hasn't swung a bat in years.
Why should he expect to be a decent hitter.  It's not silly to play to
get a productive out at a minimum.

OTOH, DiceK apparantly hit in the Japanese league and was apparantly
a reasonably decent hitter, for a pitcher.  And Beckett was in the NL not
all that long ago, and he's a pretty decent hitter, for a pitcher.

Frankly, it's one of the disadvantages that AL teams have in the WS.
Some of their pitchers may be utterly useless at the plate.

Well in that case I guess he did the best he could with that
situation.
