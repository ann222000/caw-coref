So, have you guys seen this fools auctions on Ebay lately?  I won't justify
them by posting a link, but this guy is a total ass.  He has no conception
of what the Commodore gear is worth, and is just treating this like a
commercial endeavour.  He has no feeling for the fact that that the
Commodore community has moved into the realm of being a humanitarian-driven
marketplace.

Anyone else have any thoughts on this?  I say, from a collector's viewpoint,
that everyone boycott this bastard.  Otherwise we have commercial entities
dictating the marketplace as opposed to the rest of us.

Supply and demand &quot;dictate the marketplace.&quot; That's their job.

That doesn't preclude anybody from having a good laugh over some of the prices (his Wizard and the
Princess listing is pretty hilarious) but, really, there's no leg to stand on other than having
your laugh and deciding you won't pay those prices.

I feel the same way.

I'm all for capitalism, but capitalism does not equal opportunism.

So dissimilar they are in fact, there are laws to protect customers
from gouging, pump &amp; dump, etc.  Both of which hyper-capitalists still
defend.

The best way to perceive is to have been on both sides of the

If you want to spend $250 for a C= game then go right ahead.  It's his

Indeed. I bought four different C65 prototypes from four different - but
equally nice and collaborative - people and the price was always the same:
the price those items were actually SOLD on eBay _at the time_ - it's almost
three years I don't see one, honestly I don't know how much they're worth
today.

I've been offered a couple prototypes for twice the price I used to pay and
I always refused, because I personally did my homework very well. Those
items ended up sold for their real price.

The fact someone lists Commodore software for 250$, 300$ doesn't mean
anything... All he'll get at the end will be an eBay's auction fees bill.
Also, try to understand people are cheating on eBay all the time: if you see
some software sold for 250$, which you bought the other day for 30$, odds
are a friend of the seller, or even the seller itself, made that perfect
final bid...

Well you can boycott him if you like, it's as simple as not buying
anything off him. As to why I would/wouldn't buy his stuff, well that
depends entirely on what he's charging. I really can't see how's he
any different from 101 other sellers on ebay, except some of his
prices are chunky to say the least! A look through his inventory shows
he knows which games are rare, even if they look overpriced to me.
Then again the commoner stuff would appear UNDERpriced.

Yes, it is possible with a small enough market place to actually buy
up enough equipment and sell it to yourself enough times on ebay to
make it appear as if the stuff is worth more than it is.  These two
things may be Worldlam's mission.  However, I am counting on the
Commodore community being large enough in supply and demand that he
will not be able to continue this forever.  After all, there are
always going to be other people posting stuff on ebay and he can't buy
all of it.  Eventually, he'll run out of money before he totally owns
all the Commodore equipment in the world.

Exactly!  If I'm trying to complete a collection, I may be willing to
pay a lot more for that last item than if I'm just buying spares.

I think it's pretty difficult to argue that someone auctioning off computer
equipment from the '80s is guilty of &quot;opportunism.&quot;  Anyone still trading
Commodore stuff is clear doing so because they enjoy it as a hobby, out of
nostalgia, etc. -- not because they need C-64's to keep their mother's life

OK, make that &quot;price gouging&quot; then?

What I meant was that it's difficult to argue that there's something
inherently wrong about heading down the &quot;pure capitalism&quot; route (charging
whatever the market will bear) when you're talking about goods that are purely
for one's own enjoyment and not at all necessary for &quot;basic living&quot; as, e.g.,
food, medical care, housing, etc. are.

Heck, look at how much money people were willing to pay for Beanie Babies not
too many years ago... and those have *far* less utility than a Commodore 64!

Damn right! Item X is &quot;worth&quot; whatever Joe Buyer is *willing* to pay for
it. That's how pretty much everything gets priced; the price of bacon is
basically a markup on the street price of pork belly futures, which is
set based entirely on what people who buy them are willing to pay for them.

Capitalism is not evil; it is the sole logical economic system in a free
society. Communism, by contrast, is also not evil; however, it is only a
logical economic system in a society where there is no liberty of any
kind, where all must bow to the whim of the State.

If you don't like what someone is charging, *don't* *buy* *from* *them*.
Voting with your wallet is the only political power the common man has
left these days.

This is not to be taken as a defense of Worldlam; I couldn't care less
what he's charging for C64 gear, or whether anyone wants to pay his price.

Well, you're entitled to your opinion certainly, but most people believe that
a fair amount of regulation for such necessities of life is warranted.  The
exact amount of &quot;regulation&quot; (aka, limits, taxes, prohibitions, incentives,
etc.) is of course open for endless debate...

&quot;Free society&quot; there is a bit of a weasel word.  In fact, it's really
oxymoronic... being a part of a society implies that you've given up some of
your freedom for the &quot;good of the whole.&quot;

There have never been any countries that were 100% capitalistic nor 100%
communistic.  Given a choice, I believe most people prefer to live in a
society that's far closer to capitalism (but not &quot;pure&quot; capitalism) than
communism, but of course this is largely influenced by where you were born and
the your upbringing.

Back to the definition of worth..

Surely most people's value systems are not based on $ amounts.

12 eggs cost a dollar and so does a 40 oz beer. Other than cost, these
two products are in no way equivalent. Luxury vs necessity.

However, $ amounts exist for human life as insurance.

What you end up with is a system that makes little sense and is based
on trust - which has never and will never work correctly.

It doesn't matter to me how much he buys or sells for. What's
disturbing is his proclaiming how much he loves this stuff, then
turning around and selling it.

So he wants to make $. We all need to. Yet wouldn't someone who loves
these books and programs spend time scanning the documents and
archiving the programs?

corn
beer
book

That's right, but if you remove the right to freely acquire luxuries then

Technology does lessen how much work it takes to achieve a given objective,
but society stays we're supposed to be working something like 8 hours a day, 5
days a week (varies significantly from country to country, though, and of
course historically) -- hence we just do more today.  Or at least that's the
theory... :-)

The standard of living today is, in many ways, better than ever before,
worldwide... at least when it comes to &quot;luxuries&quot; such as fancier cars (stuff
like power windows/locks/seats/steering, airbags, anti-lock brakes, etc. are
largely standard today), TV/stereo systems, computers, etc.  The economy is a
little messed up when it comes to, e.g., property/housing in that the cost has
risen *much* faster than inflation over the past handful of decades.  Even in
the past decade, in many areas within the U.S. housing prices have doubled
yet, on average, *no one's* income has (OK, maybe Fortune 500 CEOs, but other
than that...).  *That* housing &quot;bubble&quot; has now burst, and many people are
suffering the consequenes of it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

This is a good point, although at some level everything's &quot;just a question of
time&quot; -- eventually we will completely use up the fossil fuels on this planet,
we will seriously screw up the environment to the point where it's blatantly
obvious to anyone going outside, etc.  The optimisitic view is that shortly
before or as those things are happening, we'll have the technology and money
to remedy the problems.  Sometimes &quot;fixing&quot; the problem earlier on is much
cheaper than fixing it at a later stage, but as a society it's never going to
be easy gaining consensus on what all the problems brewing right around the
corner are when they can't easily be felt or seen.  (The environment is the
obvious example here.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes, they certainly would be.  It was only a generation ago that many a
high-school or college kid spent their summers and parts of falls working on
tabacco farms, and it was considered a fine vocation.

Ah, but the thorny part there is... what's a &quot;harmless&quot; drug?  Much of the
medical profession views, e.g., marijuana as less harmful than regular tobacco
cigarettes, yet there's plenty of ongoing campaigns to demonize marijuana far
more than we do cigarettes.

&gt; &gt; So, have you guys seen this fools auctions on Ebay lately?  I won't
&gt; &gt; justify them by posting a link, but this guy is a total ass.  He has no
&gt; &gt; conception of what the Commodore gear is worth, and is just treating this
&gt; &gt; like a commercial endeavour.  He has no feeling for the fact that that the
&gt; &gt; Commodore community has moved into the realm of being a
&gt; &gt; humanitarian-driven marketplace.

&gt; &gt; Anyone else have any thoughts on this?  I say, from a collector's
&gt; &gt; viewpoint, that everyone boycott this bastard.  Otherwise we have
&gt; &gt; commercial entities dictating the marketplace as opposed to the rest of
&gt; &gt; us.

&gt; Sorry, you get no sympathy from me.  Capitalism is always welcome in my
&gt; book.

That &quot;preserved history&quot; as you call it is private property. It doesn't
belong to &quot;society&quot;, or &quot;posterity&quot;, it belongs to them. That's life.

I can see where my lack of punctuation would cause some confusion.  I was
countering the argument that we must have piracy to preserve the software.
My counterpoint is that at least one person owns an original copy to every
commercial program sold and that collectively all software is indeed
preserved.  With the quantity in which software was sold, even in the 80's,
it's just statistically improbable that any mass produced software title
would become extinct.

I think thats probably untrue... I am sure there are titles that have
slipped through the cracks and are long gone, save for pirated
copies.  Copying this software now and archiving is a fine way to
preserve it.  If you are a hoarder and not interested in preservation,
then I can understand to &quot;no piracy&quot; standpoint.  But as someone who
thinks IP laws are BS and could care less about legality of copying, I
say share the wealth.....

I'll point out that in the 80s i had zero original games for my
commodore 64 save a few carts..... do i feel bad about it? hell
no.....

now that i said my piece, i'll remind us all that opinions are like
assholes..... everybody has one and they all stink....

you are free(in this country, at least) to express your opinion.....
(just try to make it more like mine in the future please :)

Let me take the time out to express my pleasure with the 99% of the
present C= community who see the value in freely copying software.

As attested by the hundreds of C= fan sites with literally tens of
thousands of archived games and documents for the benefit of us all I
heartily condemn the insinuation that you (or WE) have done anything
even remotely inappropriate in this matter. In fact, we have done the
RIGHT thing.

When I was a youth I both bought and copied software. Most of my
software collection was copied.

This is a distraction though. Digital media is a new paradigm. It
takes effort to create software but once it's created it can be copied
a trillion times over at absolutely no cost. As anyone can see, this
is much different than a table, a car, produce or livestock.

For example, a book. I buy a book from the bookstore. The bookstore
bought the book from the publisher. The publisher gave the author a
royalty on each book sold.

I buy a book from a used bookstore, the bookstore gets the money. The
author does not receive any money for that book. In a way you are
paying a storage fee to the used bookstore for keeping that book in
stock.

Used C= software earns the original author and publishing house ZERO.
Claiming copyright as a matter of principal when the original author
receives no kickback from continued sales is illogical.

Your analogy fails because the bookstore does not make copies of their
books.  Same thing goes on in GameStop or other game stores -- people
sell, buy, and trade games that have been purchased, but don't make
*copies* to sell.
