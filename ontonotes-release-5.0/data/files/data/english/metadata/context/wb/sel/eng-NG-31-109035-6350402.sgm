Chocolates from Lessiter's.  Nothing exotic, I know, but still
they make Good Stuff.

They are tucked away now, and I am having to contain myself to
keep from presenting them early.  I think daily, 'Keep away from that
box.  Do not go near it.  It is not calling my name.  It is just a
box of chocolates.  I have will power.  I will _not_ open a box that
I got for a present.  Keep away from that box.'

I bought some new toys for Valentine's Day-
I bought a collar and cuff set with the swivel type 'D ring hooks,'
some new exciting lubes, an evil butt plug that vibrates and pumps up
(width I'm assuming), and some brand new colorful candles to set the
mood. ((okay, maybe the candles were for me, but the rest was
definately for him!!))

I'm sure I'll regret the butt play stuff, but he has been disappointed
with my lack of experience with this area, so I'm hoping these toys
will make amends...or at least more enjoyable.

I was going to buy the TENS unit but the cost of all the attachments
put me off. Maybe I'll get that for his next B Day.

while eating chocolate are similar to those of love.

It is my sincere hope that the toys will aid my inhabitions in that
particular area and help us both to enjoy butt play more. I guess you
could say that I was thinking the 'foreplay' these toys will provide

Yeah, I'm being a little selfish by NOT getting it yet. Although we

You can't go wrong with chocolate.  That's why it is the favorite currency
of ssbb.  Since it is supposedly a source for the release of chemicals to
the brain that stimulate the pleasure centers, I am thinking about doubling
her pleasure this Valentine's Day ---- by giving her a nice spanking while
she eat the chocolates.

You might use a very weak battery at first.  Perhaps that might
limit the output of the TENS unit?  (My experience with those things
is nil.  I believe it ought to work analogously to a battery powered
lamp, in which the light output decreases as the battery wears down.)

Some generic help for Google posters, MID: &lt;j9vuoe.aqm ... @spuddy.org&gt;
==================================
(fair use extract)
Hint: The following text was written for people who are new
to Usenet and who recently started to post via Google. It
might also be useful to experienced netizens.

Dear Google poster,

nice to see you on Usenet. Obviously you posted using
Google. groups.google.com is an archive that collects postings
from something called Usenet. Maybe you didn't yet notice that you
have arrived in Usenet but you think that you're using a Web
forum.

This is not true.  For example, the majority of people who create
posts and who read posts are not using Google Groups. Google Groups
is just one of the many interfaces to Usenet. Programs to access
and post to Usenet are called 'newsreaders'.
==================================

You do not have to read via a news reading program, but it can make
it more enjoyable for you. This site has links for information and
downloading a variety of newsreaders.

A newsreader is not required, but if you want help getting set up that
way -- which is a LOT nicer for both reading and posting -- please
contact me via email.

What Ty is asking you to do is to put your replies below the quoted
text, not above it. That is the convention on Usenet, which is where you
are when you post here.  The exception is in replying to Brian, who uses
a screen reader and therefore can suffer a long delay if he is trying to
get to your new material at the bottom.

If you want some basic tips on making your Usenet experience easier,
please also email me and I can give you some links &amp; such.

And I, for one, really enjoy your presence here and hope you won't let
these procedural things cause you to back out.

Ya know, folks here have become more prescriptive about the "top-posting" thing
compared to when I was hanging out here some years back, when there was more of

Don't use "reply to this message" in order to reply.  (Weird, huh?)  You can
quote properly by using the "options" selection, as shown in this tutorial:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have no idea what top posting is.
">

It's putting your reply on above (on top) of the message to which you are
responding, rather than putting it below the original message.

Newsgroup propagation being what it is, some folks will see your response before
they see the post on which you're commenting.  (Others, in fact, may *never* see
the original post or didn't bother reading it.)

Another problem is that given the way threads drift, a subject line may have
little or nothing to do with what the current discussion involves.

Bottom-posting lets folks see *first* the material you're commenting on, *then*
read your reply.  If someone has missed a post or two, your comments won't make
any sense to them unless they first scroll down to read the other stuff, then
scroll up again to read what you wrote.

Here's an old joke about the whole thing:

Smith: Oh! Now it makes sense to me. Okay! No more top-posting for me!

Jones: It's annoying because it reverses the normal order of conversation. In
fact, many people ignore top-posted articles.

Smith: What's so wrong with that?

Jones: That's posting your response *before* the article you're quoting.

Smith: People keep bugging me about "top-posting." What does that mean?

A: Top posters.

Q: What is the most annoying thing on Usenet?

A genuine newsreader makes Life a *lot* easier when reading newsgroups, it's not
necessary to have one in order to post properly. Attention to detail and
learning how usenet works in general (and this newsgroup in specific) will
usually keep any poster in good stead.

Could be.  Also could be it's because usenet is no longer new or a novelty to
most of us, most usenet groups *do* have a group norm, and as newbies come on
board it's easier to teach them how to bottom post than it is to spend one's
life scrolling up and down.

Personally, I don't bother with it the scrolling up and down crap; I'm too lazy
to fight to read someone's top-posted stuff, so I tend just to kill-file them.

Okay I get it now. On other BB's they want the post on the top to make
it easier for them. This was something I was doing out of habit.  I
sometimes forget that not everyone knows I read this via google (re:
profile).

So far as a newsreader is concerned, this is my Master's PC, I do not
feel comfortable putting programs on here without his permission. If
it were my own PC I would have done so right away as it seems most
posters read via a newsgroup.

Thank you for taking the time to educate me in my faux pas.

&gt;      While that is true, when floating on the top of a chocolate-

&gt; of indulgence.

&gt;&gt;It is my sincere hope that the toys will aid my inhabitions in that

&gt;&gt;could say that I was thinking the 'foreplay' these toys will provide
&gt;&gt;will help both of us enjoy the experience more. As he often rushes
&gt;&gt;things a bit much...and it's difficult for me (as a 'newbie') to keep
&gt;&gt;up.
&gt;&gt;In short yes, I anticipate both our needs being met.

&gt;      Good.  Have fun!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I was going to buy the TENS unit but the cost of all the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;attachments put me off. Maybe I'll get that for his next B Day.

&gt;&gt;&gt;There's something to look forward to!

&gt;&gt;Yeah, I'm being a little selfish by NOT getting it yet. Although we
&gt;&gt;both *love* electric play, I'm not fully ready to trust him with
&gt;&gt;such a device as this. The sadist in him would crank that baby up -
&gt;&gt;I just know it.

&gt;      You might use a very weak battery at first.  Perhaps that might
&gt; limit the output of the TENS unit?  (My experience with those things
&gt; is nil.  I believe it ought to work analogously to a battery powered
&gt; lamp, in which the light output decreases as the battery wears down.)
">

Speaking as a confirmied Tenist, I'm sorry to say that putting in a weak
battery wouldn't have much affect.  The sensation for most people
becomes almost too intense at about half setting, but if your dom wants,
he can crank up even a weak battery to cause intense sensations.  But
even cranked fully up, they hurt strangely but do no damage.

Peoples response to tens units varies widely.  I know one subbe who
likes it turned fully up!  Between clit and anus, no less.  She just
goes into repeat orgasms and I have to watch her closely to make sure
she doesn't faint or hyperventilate.

On the other hand, Kim really can't stand it beyond about half setting,
but "enjoys' being tightly bound so that she has no choice to accept the
intensity of sensation at higher settings.

They are really fun toys.

Then I stand corrected.  It may be that the sensation perceeived
by the user is the thing that is non-linear.  At any rate, above some
low-end battery voltage below which the unit does not work at all,
the electrical signals from a TENS unit are much larger than the
signals generated by the body.

Update: The collar and cuffs are fine. They made their test run early
last week, with mild sucess. I was happy with the restrictions minus
the fact my elbows were forced in front of my head and hands stuck to
my ears all night. Not so bad. (the cuffs lock to the collar.)

The lube was a total let down. It is in a *very* small tube and
flavored. This is not what I ordered. We haven't even used it. I want
something *very* lubricating and slick. Looking at the tube i feel
there is probably enough for one scene (maybe). *sigh*

The butt plug is something he is VERY pleased with, though we have not
used it with any sucess. He assures me that we will make it work and
that he loves it. I will need more practice with this sort of toy /
play. (which was why i bought it) :)

The candles were something I was interested in and they remain
unopened, although he said he would like to try them (for me). I can
tell he is totally uninterested in them. I love HOT sensations, it
really revs me up (so to speak) and I don't really think he
understands this yet, though I have mentioned it on several
occasions.

He bought me some 'heating' lube, but it is not nearly enough for my
kink. Vaporub is close but not nearly hot enough. I think ben gay etc
would be too hot (and I'm chicken to try). Any ideas?

thanks,
T
