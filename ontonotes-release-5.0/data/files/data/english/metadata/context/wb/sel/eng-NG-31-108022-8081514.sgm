Orange Juice Cake

Jan Smith - San Jose Mercury News

1/2 cup shortening
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon grated orange rind
1 cup sugar
2 eggs, well-beaten
2 cups flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup sour cream
1/3 cup orange juice
1 cup walnuts or pecans, finely chopped

Glaze:

1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup orange juice
1/4 cup lemon juice
1 1/2 tablespoons total grated orange and lemon rind

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cream together shortening, salt, orange rind
and sugar. Stir in eggs, mixing well. In another bowl, sift together
flour, baking powder and baking soda. In a third bowl, mix together sour
cream and orange juice. Add dry mixture and sour cream mixture alternately
to creamed mixture. Stir in nuts and spread in a greased 9-by-13-inch pan.
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until cake passes the toothpick test.

To make glaze, mix sugar, juices and grated rind until sugar is dissolved.
Drizzle mixture evenly over cake as soon as cake is removed from oven, or
poke small holes all over cake, then drizzle. Cool in pan before serving,
and serve with whipped cream. Cake tastes better if it sits overnight at
room temperature before serving.

Orange Chiffon Cake With Orange Or Lemon Butter Frosting

Yield: 12 to 16 servings

For cake:

2 1/4 cups cake flour (see note)
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup vegetable oil
5 egg yolks
3/4 cup cold water (see note)
2 tablespoons grated orange zest (colored portion of peel)
1 cup egg whites (7 or 8)
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
For frosting:
1/3 cup margarine or butter, softened
3 cups powdered sugar
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons grated orange or lemon zest
About 3 tablespoons orange or lemon juice

To prepare cake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Mix flour, sugar, baking
powder and salt in a bowl. Make a well in the dry ingredients. Add, in
this order, oil, egg yolks, water and orange zest. Beat with a spoon until
smooth.  In a large bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar with
electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Pour yolk mixture
gently over beaten whites, gently folding with a rubber spatula just until
blended.  Pour into an ungreased 10-inch tube pan.  Bake cake until top
springs back when touched lightly, about 1 1/4 hours.  Invert pan on
heatproof funnel; let hang until cake is cold. Remove from pan.

To prepare frosting: Combine margarine, sugar, zest and juice in a  large
bowl; beat with an electric mixer until of spreading consistency. Frost
top and sides of cake.

Note: You can substitute 2 cups all-purpose flour for the 2 1/4 cups cake
flour if you also increase the number of egg yolks to 7. If you use
self-rising  flour, omit the baking powder and salt.  For more orange
flavor, juice 2 oranges after grating the zest, then add  enough water to
equal 3/4 cup.

Marmalade-like Fresh Orange Curd

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From The Oregonian
">

Makes about 2 cups or two 8-ounce jars

We tried this recipe substituting commercial orange juice -- in our case,
the pulp-free kind from a refrigerated carton -- while still adding the
fresh orange zest. It was surprisingly good. While the fresh orange juice
version makes a chunkier, sweeter, more marmalade-like mixture, the one
with
commercial juice is smoother and less translucent.

6 to 8 oranges, at room temperature (see note)
1 lemon
1 cup granulated sugar
6 egg yolks, beaten
1/2 cup unsalted butter (1 stick), cut into 4 pieces

Grate enough orange zest to equal 1 packed tablespoon (1 or 2 oranges);
set aside. Roll oranges and lemon on countertop to allow more juice to be
released. Cut oranges in half; squeeze or ream out juice. Remove any
seeds, but don't strain out pulp. Measure 1 1/2 cups fresh orange juice.
Measure and reserve 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, including pulp. In a
small heavy saucepan, place orange juice and bring to a boil over
medium-high heat. Let it simmer until reduced to about 1/2 cup; mixture
will be slightly syrupy. Add lemon juice. Transfer to the top of a double
boiler set over simmering water. Add sugar, zest and egg yolks; whisk to
combine. Continue stirring until mixture is consistency of light pudding.
Whisk in butter, a chunk at a time, until it melts. (Mixture will thicken
as it cools.) Pour into a medium bowl, let cool slightly. Press plastic
wrap directly onto top of curd to prevent a pudding-like skin from
forming, or pour directly into jars. Seal and refrigerate.

Serve with toasted English muffins, toast, scones. Or use as filling for
small tart shells, or baked dry meringue shells. Or serve over slices of
poundcake with a dollop of whipped cream.

Note: In FOODday's testing, it took 6 oranges to make 1 1/2 cups juice
including pulp, but oranges vary.

Juicy Orange Cake

Time: 1 hour and 30 minutes

8 ounces (2 sticks) unsalted butter, slightly softened, more for pan
3 cups all-purpose flour, more for pan
3 oranges, preferably organic, for zest and juice
1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice, more as needed
2 1/3 cups sugar
3 eggs
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup buttermilk

Heat oven to 350 degrees. Thickly butter and flour a 9-inch round cake pan
or 6-cup loaf pan. Zest and juice oranges. Mix 1/2 cup orange juice, 1
tablespoon lemon juice and 1/3 cup sugar. To remaining orange juice add
lemon juice to make 1/4 cup. Stir in zest.

In mixer, cream butter and remaining sugar until fluffy. With mixer
running, add eggs one at a time. Turn off and add 11/2 cups flour, baking
soda and salt, and mix. Add half the buttermilk, and mix. Repeat with
remaining flour and buttermilk. Add zest mixture, and mix.

Pour dough into pan and place on baking sheet. Bake until tester comes out
dry, 1 to 11/4 hours. Cool in pan 15 minutes. Set wire rack over a rimmed
sheet pan and turn warm cake onto rack. Using a pastry brush or baster,
spread glaze over top of cake and let soak in. Repeat until all glaze is
used. Let cool at room temperature. Can be refrigerated in plastic wrap
for a week.

Yield: One 9-inch cake.
