Folks- my dad Jim &amp; I headed NE on I76 today to look for shorebirds,
etc.

Our first stop, Prewitt Reservoir (Washington/Logan Cos.), was mainly
a bust.  The lake is still very high, with water still mainly up into
smartweed or against the cement dam.  The feeder canal is running
full, so dropping water there probably isn't imminent.  We did find
some adequate looking muddy sand shoreline in places but still could
only rouse up about a dozen Baird's Sandpiper, a Greater Yellowlegs,
and a flyby Least Sandpiper in addition to Killdeer.  Of interest was
a juvenile Franklin's Gull, beginning to molt in gray feathers on its
back.  One Sterna tern was seen in the distance- I had the impression
that it was a Forster's Tern but I can't be sure.  We crossed a few
medium-sized flocks of Lark Buntings, each with an assortment of
young birds and adults, males and females, some well into their pre-
basic molt and some only starting.

Already that far along, we tucked up to Sterling (Logan Co.) to try
for Mississippi Kites and were rewarded with a pair near Columbine
Park.  This is the city park that is on the north of Hwy 6 right as
you come into town from the west, just before the road jogs to the
north.

From there we retreated back towards Denver by way of Loloff
Reservoir, Lower Latham Reservoir, and Beebe Draw (Weld Co.)

Loloff Reservoir was teeming with birds.  As we approached we saw
that it was peppered with white birds that turned out to be
Franklin's Gulls in their hundreds.  Besides a weak showing of Ring-
billed Gulls, three transitional Black Terns rounded out the Larids.
Black-necked Stilts, both Yellowlegs, Least &amp; Baird's Sandpipers, and
Wilson's Phalaropes populated the shore and water.  Two Redheads were
in the mix of expected dabbling ducks.

Recent heavy rains (about 5 1/2 inches out of two storms within a
week, according to a farmer we talked to) have filled the pans south
of Lower Latham Reservoir.  In fact, they may be a bit too full right
now, flooding into the grass, but I think they will be worth watching
as the water recedes and exposes some mud.  Not too many shorebirds
were there but we picked up a Solitary Sandpiper and a Wilson's Snipe
along with a around two dozen Black-necked Stilts and a handful of
Lesser Yellowlegs.  Nine Snowy Egrets worked the inlet canal but
despite a fair bovine presence and lots of tempting flooded grass no
Cattle Egrets were found.

The productive pond at WCR 42 in Beebe Draw was also completely full,
right up to the drain culvert on the dirt levee.  Plenty of American
Avocets gathered here (20 or so), with about half resting in the NW
corner and the other half acting like dabbling ducks, foraging in
water up to their breasts and sticking their whole heads and necks
down to feed, tipping their butts up in the air.  It looked like they
were swimming but I think they were in water about as deep as they
could go and still touch bottom.  Despite the lack of a good mud
perimeter, shorebirds clustered on the far side, particularly in the
NW corner.  About a half-dozen Semipalmated Sandpipers joined some
Least &amp; Baird's Sandpipers and lone yellowlegs of either ilk.

Enjoy- Bill
