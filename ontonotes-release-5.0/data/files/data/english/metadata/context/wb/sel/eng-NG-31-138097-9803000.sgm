Warning signs on food front

The record rise in the prices of wheat and most other food items coming on top of an unprecedented and unanticipated shift in global food supplies has prompted
a sharp warning from the Food and Agriculture Organisation. Its top official said recently that fewer people, especially in the developing world, will
be able to get food. FAO's food price index has gone up by 40 per cent this year compared with 9 per cent the year before, when it was already high. The
food bill of the most needy countries rose by 25 per cent to touch $107 million last year. Compared to a year ago, wheat prices are up 52 per cent. Very
recently, for the first time ever wheat futures broke the $10-a-bushel mark, which is roughly $370 a tonne and the equivalent of global oil breaching the
$100-a-barrel level. The price of not just wheat but the prices of most other cereals, oil seeds, milk, and meat have also gone up. But it is the inflation
in wheat prices that has become the reference point and has, in many ways, been responsible for the all-round increase in food prices.

In an ominous parallel development, FAO records show that wheat stocks have declined to their lowest levels since 1980, corresponding to just 12 weeks of
the world's total consumption, which is sharply lower than the average of 18 weeks during 2000-05. An unprecedented drought in Australia for two years
in a row and unfavourable weather conditions in Argentina, Ukraine and Southern Russia - all principal wheat producing regions - have sharply reduced global
output. Less understood but an obviously potent factor is the effect of global warming. The shift to biofuels, especially in the United States, is an immediate,
well-documented cause. Besides, in China, India and some other developing countries, there has been a significant change in the consumption patterns with
affluent families taking more of meat, milk and vegetables than cereals. The consequent increased demand for grains as cattle and poultry feed has aggravated
the shortage. High global food prices have figured prominently in Indian policy making. When announced in November, the minimum support price for the winter
wheat crop at Rs.1,000 a quintal seemed appropriate, balancing the interests of the farmers and the consumers. Evidently the government may have to pay
more next April, as private trade is likely to bid up the prices. Even as the government is pinning its hopes on achieving a production target of 75.5
million tonnes of wheat, a great deal of uncertainty remains over the immediate direction of food prices and the impact they will have on inflation and
the quantum of food subsidies.

Overriding social interest

The European court of Justice (ECJ) has upheld the trade unions' right to collective action, including striking work, as a fundamental right. It has justified
this in terms of the public interest of protection of workers, even where that right amounts to a restriction on the right of movement of establishments
guaranteed under European Union (EU) law. The decision could force western European enterprises that relocate to the new EU member states in Eastern and
Central Europe to agree to terms of employment similar to those they implement in EU states further west. Broadly, this will give a big boost to the demand
for the universalisation of labour standards, a prerequisite for equity and fairness in a globally competitive situation. The ECJ ruling was delivered
in a dispute where the principles of free movement of establishments and the workers' right to collective bargaining were in contention. A Finnish shipowner
had sought to fly an Estonian flag of convenience so as to hire a less expensive crew outside the framework of collective bargaining with the seamen's
union in Finland. In response, the Finnish Seamen's Union, with backing from the International Transport Workers' Federation, threatened industrial action.
The court, while maintaining that restrictions on the registration of vessels in another country amount to an infringement of the freedom of establishment,
nevertheless held that such a curtailment could be reasonably justified if its purpose is to guarantee the protection of workers and if it does not go
beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.

Under EU law, the general principle laid down by the Luxembourg court would serve as a basis for the final decision to be pronounced by the Court of Appeal
of England and Wales. The ECJ ruling is an affirmation of the rights and conditions of labour enshrined in all the major treaties of the EU, beginning
with the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951. The right to collective action is also an explicit provision in the European Charter
of Fundamental Rights, which has legal sanction under the Reform Treaty signed recently by the 27 member states. This is especially critical in today's
highly polarised debates over the so-called social versus liberal Europe in the context of the European Commission's drive to implement market-orientated
reforms. Such distinctions at best exaggerate differences among EU states and undermine the definitive commitments that have sustained post-war European
democracies. The ECJ ruling, binding on all the member states, is a vital reminder that the EU - a model in international cooperation - is not just an
economic triumph but a social triumph too.

Examining a post-Prabakaran scenario

D.B.S. Jeyaraj

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Acting on intelligence, the Sri Lankan security forces have been effectively targeting the LTTE at different levels. On November 28, the Air Force came
close to eliminating Velupillai Prabakaran. This naturally raises the question: what will happen to the LTTE without its supremo?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

For many years in Sri Lanka's politico-military landscape, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been the predators, preying on members of the
government, the security establishment, the administrative apparatus, non-LTTE politicians, and so on. A remarkable reversal in recent times has seen the
predator becoming prey. Carefully coordinated action by the Sri Lankan security forces has seen the Tigers being targeted at many different levels. From
destroying LTTE ships carrying arms to ambushing LTTE operatives in landmine attacks, the forces have been hitting hard and consistently.

A key component of this strategy has been the targeting of Velupillai Prabakaran, the 53-year-old LTTE leader hailed by his followers as the Tamil 'national
leader.' Relying on information made available through intelligence sources, the Sri Lankan Air Force has been regularly targeting areas where the Tiger
supremo was suspected of roaming. Air Force morale was boosted greatly after the November 2 bombing in which the LTTE Political Commissar, Suppiah Paramu
Thamilselvan, was killed along with six others. This was at Thiruvaiaru, a southern suburb of Kilinochchi, which is regarded as the de facto capital of
the Tiger-controlled regions in the northern mainland known as Wanni.

On November 28, the Air Force came very close to getting the LTTE chief himself when Jeyanthy Nagar, a northern suburb, was bombed. The same area had been
bombed on November 26. The bombing was so intense that the Tigers closed the Uruthirapuram Road, along which Jeyanthy Nagar is situated, for two weeks.
While the pro-LTTE website, 'Tamilnet,' reported both incidents and claimed that there were no civilian casualties, the authorities in Colombo divulged
nothing about them for more than three weeks.

A Colombo English weekly, The Nation, reported on December 16 that the LTTE leader was slightly injured on November 28. He was reportedly in a fortified
bunker at Jeyanthy Nagar, a settlement consisting of six housing schemes. A bomb had caused damage to the bunker and Prabakaran had sustained minor injuries
on his shoulder, arm, and back from falling debris.

In a report published in The Hindu of December 18, B. Muralidhar Reddy, the newspaper's Sri Lanka correspondent, quoted President Mahinda Rajapaksa on the
incident: &quot;Asked about the report in a Sunday English weekly paper about the LTTE chief being injured in an aerial attack on November 28, Mr. Rajapaksa
said though the government was not in a position to confirm the veracity of the report, it was sure that on that particular day the Sri Lanka Air Force
had definitely hit two 'important targets' of the Tigers in Kilinochchi. 'At the moment we are not in a position to comment on the correctness of the report.
However, the SLAF is certain that it has hit two specific high value targets of the LTTE on November 28,' Mr. Rajapaksa said.&quot;

On December 19, the Defence Ministry, in an official release through the Media Centre for National Security, confirmed that the LTTE leader was injured
in the bombing on Jeyanthy Nagar. The press release said, however, that the injuries were caused on November 26. The delay in releasing this information
was explained thus: &quot;Though the Air Force believed that Velupillai Prabakaran had been hit in this attack, non availability of ground information to confirm
such at that time prevented the Government from releasing this information to the media.&quot;

Predictably, the LTTE denied that Prabakaran was injured. The organisation's defence affairs spokesman, Rasiah Ilanthiraiyan, claimed that these were part
of psychological operations by Colombo. Once the Government confirmed that Prabakaran was injured, there were several follow-up media reports. Some went
to the extent of saying that 116 bodyguards of the LTTE leader were killed and that he was to be taken abroad for medical treatment. Even if some of the
reports evoked a sense of disbelief, there seemed little doubt that the LTTE leader had been injured in an Air Force attack. It was evident that the

Nepal without a king

All bad things must be brought to an end. Nepal's monarchy, which under King Gyanendra's benighted rule alternated between unenlightened tyranny and violent
anarchy, is now a discredited institution, bereft of political legitimacy and popular support. Following an agreement between the ruling Seven Party Alliance
and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), the Girija Prasad Koirala regime on Monday tabled a bill in the interim Parliament to declare Nepal a Feder
al Democratic Republic. Although the abolition of the monarchy is subject to ratification by the yet-to-be-elected Constituent Assembly, that seems to
be a mere formality. The interim Parliament is already empowered to abolish the monarchy if the King is found to be conspiring against the Constituent
Assembly election. The Maoists walked out of the interim government on just this point: they wanted an immediate end to monarchy while the centrist political
parties wanted the decision to be left to the Constituent Assembly. The former rebels are likely to rejoin the Cabinet after the bill is passed. The present
agreement should also pave the way for an election to the Constituent Assembly that will see no interference from the King but will actively involve the
Maoists.

The election, which is rescheduled for April 2008, was put off because the Maoists were hesitant to come on board. Their participation in the democratic
political process is crucial to the transition of Nepal from a monarchy to a republic. At the same time, it is important to ensure that the abolition of
the monarchy gets the stamp of the people's approval. In the absence of any provocation from the King, the sound constitutional course would be to let
a duly elected Constituent Assembly formally end the monarchy that dates back to 1769. From the start, King Gyanendra showed signs of ending up as the
last monarch of Nepal. The bizarre circumstances under which he ascended the throne in June 2001 - following a palace bloodbath that took the lives of
King Birendra and his family, including the maniacal and drunken parricide, Crown Prince Dipendra, who reigned as a virtually brain-dead King for four
days - in no way added to the legitimacy of his reign. He became a detested figure after he assumed dictatorial powers in February 2005 in an attempt to
crush the Maoist revolt. The ignominious collapse of King Gyanendra's power and legitimacy has effectively ended the centuries-old royal lineage. Clearly,
the future of Nepal lies in developing into a modern democratic republic, with a progressive Constitution and the rule of law, free from the trappings
of a semi-feudal past. The monarchy must be given a swift and unfussy burial.

Beyond the primate barrier

By successfully cloning monkey embryos and producing two lines of embryonic stem cells, scientists at the Portland-based Oregon National Primate Research
Center have broken the primate barrier. Despite the success with cloning the sheep Dolly more than ten years ago and many other mammals including mice
subsequently, cloning primate embryos had proved to be difficult. By cloning monkey embryos, which are closely related to humans, Shoukhrat Mitalipov has
greatly contributed to our understanding of the processes involved, and has brought stem cell research one step closer to cloning of humans for studying
and treating certain diseases. However, the process of producing embryos using skin cells taken from a nine-year-old male rhesus macaque and fusing them
with unfertilised monkey eggs is highly inefficient - it required 304 eggs from 14 monkeys to produce two cell lines, the level of efficiency being less
than one per cent. The encouraging part is that Dr. Mitalipov has been able to increase the number of embryos significantly by making a small but crucial
change in the cloning process. This shows that embryonic stem cell science, still in its infancy, can reach a level of maturity where cloning human embryos
for studying diseases and for therapeutic purposes is possible, provided of course scientists are allowed to work in a conducive environment, unfettered
by laws born out of unwarranted apprehensions.

If the South Korean stem cell researcher Hwang Woo Suk's fraudulent research prompted Dr. Mitalipov to shift his focus from reproductive cloning to producing
embryonic stem cell lines, the journal Nature exercised abundant caution and took the unusual step of getting the scientist's claims verified by an independent
team before publishing the latest paper. When Science published two papers based on Hwang's fraudulent research on human cloning, journals came in for
severe criticism for not having in place a proper screening mechanism for detecting any fabrication of data. While Science considered providing &quot;additional
procedural safeguards&quot;, Nature had indicated early last year the measures it proposed to take for detecting faked work. By instituting a process of independent
pre-publication scrutiny, the journal has shown the way of making it difficult for the likes of Hwang to cheat the scientific community and deflect the
course of research. It is for other journals to emulate it and for scientists themselves to set up self-regulatory mechanisms lest the basic fabric of
scientific enterprise should be soiled.

Oil-for-food scandal: fault not with U.N.

Ramesh Thakur

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

It was largely a media beat-up that served to disguise the primary responsibility of member states driven by commercial and strategic calculations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

In the course of seminars and lectures during my recent visit to India, I was taken aback by references to the U.N.'s oil-for-food scandal and was asked
why, in one of my articles in The Hindu (May 25), I had been so dismissive about it. The story begins with sanctions as a bridge between diplomacy and
force and ends with opposition to the United Nations being motivated by its failure to endorse the war on Saddam Hussein.

Once seen as an attractive non-violent alternative to war, sanctions became discredited for their harsh humanitarian consequences on the civilian population.
Many of the contradictions, inconsistencies, perverse consequences, moral costs, and impassioned differences over when to lift sanctions came to a head
with respect to the sanctions imposed on Iraq by the Security Council Resolution 661 after the first Gulf War. Around 80 per cent of Iraq's civilian population
was adversely affected by the U.N. sanctions while the leadership enriched itself by cornering the black market for goods in the resulting scarcity. The
humanitarian costs of the sanctions regime slowly but surely destroyed the fragile consensus in the U.N. Security Council. The feeling grew that the right
to life, dignity, and livelihood of a people should not be forfeited to the international community because their leaders violated international norms.

In 2004, the oil-for-food scandal gave fresh life to critics who could not forgive the U.N. for having been proven right about Saddam's weapons of mass
destruction. Allegations flew thick and fast well in advance of investigation and substantiation. While some of the charges were based on genuine and legitimate
questions, others were ill-informed and some were ill-intentioned (the timing coincided with efforts to transfer authority for Iraqi nation-building and
reconstruction from the United States-led coalition to the U.N.).

One would think that the cheerleaders for waging war on Saddam would have retreated into a period of quiet introspection. In fact, for a long time it was
as difficult to find any trace of embarrassment, humility or repentance among them as to find a trace of the supposedly ubiquitous and deadly WMD in Iraq.
Instead, many of those columnists and newspapers, clearly believing that attack is the best form of defence, went on the offensive against the U.N. and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan. When Mr. Annan dared to caution against a major military offensive in Fallujah because of the heightened risk of civilian
casualties, The Wall Street Journal described his letter as 'a hostile act' (Nov. 8, 2004): not just wrong, not an error of judgment or a difference of
interpretation, but an act of hostility towards the U.S. The fiercest attack focussed on the oil-for-food scandal. Thus William Safire, writing in his
New York Times column (Nov. 15, 2004) accused Mr. Annan of 'stonewalling' and 'obstruction of justice.'

The oil-for-food programme (OFFP) ran from 1996 to 2003 with the goal of relieving the misery inflicted on Iraqis by Saddam. It was created to ensure that
Iraq's oil money was used to meet the basic needs of the people and not for rearmament. In return for being allowed to export oil, Iraq would be required
to transfer all revenues earned into a U.N.-controlled escrow account in Paris which would pay for the purchase of food and medicines. Saddam rejected
this as an infringement of sovereignty. After five years of stalemate, with the increasingly devastating impact of the sanctions regime on the ordinary
people, a deal was struck giving Baghdad the power to determine who bought the oil and supplied the relief goods.

Two separate scandals were rolled into one: smuggling and bill padding. The General Accounting Office (GAO) of the U.S. Congress estimated that the Saddam
regime got $10.1 billion in illegal revenues from the OFFP. Of that, $5.7 billion came from oil smuggled out in violation of U.N. sanctions during and
before the OFFP. Washington turned a blind eye to extensive sanctions-busting in the pre-war sale of Iraqi oil, according to a Senate investigation. U.S.
oil purchases accounted for 52 per cent of the kickbacks paid to the regime in return for sales of cheap oil - more than the rest of the world put together
and dwarfing the amounts allegedly paid to U.N.

The shine in solar energy

With a global installed capacity of just about 5,000 megawatts and relatively high costs, solar photovoltaic energy has come to be viewed as a futuristic,
even somewhat utopian, option. Yet concern is growing over climate-changing carbon emissions and innovative ways are being sought to bring electricity
to millions who are not plugged into conventional power grids. Encouragingly, the efficiency of solar photovoltaic cells is improving. In combination with
energy-efficient light emitting diodes, solar modules are achieving good results in lighting. The potential of such devices to light up dark homes has
been recognised by a Mondialogo engineering award, instituted by Daimler and UNESCO, to a solar-powered LED lantern. As with other simple technology applications,
the lantern, developed jointly by teams from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, United States, and the Jagannath Institute for Technology
and Management, Orissa, can potentially revolutionise 'off-grid' lighting. What such projects need is support from governments to commercialise and achieve
scales of manufacture on a fast track. Grid-connected projects seem to be getting fresh attention. Rajasthan is to set up a big solar farm. However, national
capacity to manufacture LEDs (which, incidentally, have been deployed to light up Christmas trees in international cities this year) remains a challenge.

Solar photovoltaic systems, a source of clean power, have grown worldwide at an annual rate of about 25 per cent during the past decade, touching nearly
45 per cent in 2005. Solar photovoltaic cell production in the recent past has been at a peak in Japan, Germany, and the United States; global capacity
was augmented by 1,727 megawatts in 2005 alone. Some scientists argue that with sufficient investments on a 'grand solar plan,' the United States could
meet as much as 69 per cent of its electricity demand and 35 per cent of all its energy demand (including transport) by 2020 through solar, with provision
for demand growth and at prices comparable with those of fossil fuels. For many countries, India in particular, solar energy should be attractive going
by a recent solar 'hotspot' map generated by the U.S. space agency, NASA. Australia and the Niger top in harvesting potential, according to the map, but
much of India can reap the sun's bounty. Indeed, the Tenth Plan projected an R&amp;D policy for 2025 incorporating a range of alternative energy technologies
but the solar option remained a weak element. For a start, an accelerated programme of rural LED lighting and solar thermal technologies for cooking can
achieve substantial results. It can contribute to public health by greatly reducing the adverse health effects of indoor smoke from lamps and stoves that
use fossil fuels. It is time India got serious about solar energy.

Growing clout of sovereign funds

Some recent developments bring into sharp focus the enormous financial clout that oil producing nations have come to wield in the global economy. The most
spectacular of them has been the $7.6 billion investment by the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority for a 4.9 per cent stake in the beleaguered Citigroup. That
in effect has provided a lifeline to the world's biggest financial services group that is reeling under the effects of bad loans to the housing sector.
With that investment Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, a sovereign wealth fund, joins Prince Walid Bin Talal of Saudi Arabia as a top shareholder of Citigroup
- significantly, both are from the oil producing nations of West Asia. There was no political opposition to the Abu Dhabi investment in what is generally
considered a sensitive sector. Less than two years ago, politicians in the United States rallied against and eventually blocked the successful bids for
a few major American ports by a Dubai-based, UAE government-owned ports operator. Strong commercial and financial considerations seem to have overwhelmed
any incipient political opposition to the Citi deal. It is not clear whether such transactions will become a common feature with countries that are flush
with oil money and other export earnings and have accumulated assets in the developed world.

It is however certain that the sovereign wealth funds, set up by governments to manage profitably their abundant foreign exchange resources, will acquire
further clout. According to reliable estimates, the seven largest sovereign wealth funds - those of Abu Dhabi, China, Norway, Kuwait, Russia, and two Singapore
entities - control nearly $1.8 trillion. The assets under their management will significantly exceed those managed by private equity, hedge funds, and
other unregulated entities currently making a big splash in the world of high finance, including in India. Barring those of China and Singapore, they are
awash with petrodollars. The OPEC's recent decision to leave its output unchanged - thereby tacitly suggesting that the ruling price of nearly $100 a barrel
will stay - is a further shot in the arm for the sovereign wealth funds of oil producing countries. In India there is a growing clamour to deploy the burgeoning
foreign exchange reserves more profitably, but the idea has, so far, not found favour with the monetary authorities. However, India will certainly attract
a portion of investments by these wealth funds as foreign direct investment.

UPA government must overcome fear

M.K. Bhadrakumar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

In its Iran policy, New Delhi must jettison

its fear of displeasing Washington and revive the traditional exchanges with Tehran. In this it can take a leaf out of Beijing's book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

After a recent visit to China, the prominent American strategic thinker, Zbigniew Brzezinski, wrote that it was &quot;timely and historically expedient&quot; for
Washington to enter into a strategic dialogue with Beijing on applying their combined experience vis-À-vis the North Korean nuclear problem to resolving
the potential crisis with Iran. From all accounts in the Chinese media, the leadership in Beijing attentively received Mr. Brzezinski. His demarche offers
much insight.

Especially so, since our own Iran policy needs an exit strategy. Constructing a friendship with Iran has not proved easy for successive Congress governments.
In the early 1990s, when the Congress was last in power on its own steam, North Block was scared stiff that if New Delhi reached out to Tehran, the International
Monetary Fund would be annoyed. The phantoms of fear, alas, have been stalking the corridors of South Block too during the past 2-3 years.

The Foreign Secretary's recent visit to Iran has been a timely initiative. But there is no substitute to reviving our traditional political exchanges with
Iran at the highest level. A visit by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to that country will just be the bold signal needed today. Iran is poised to move to
the centre stage of the energy scene, and is set to play the key role of a regional power.

The United Progressive Alliance leadership, which scores political brownies by citing China's pragmatic examples, could learn from Beijing's statecraft.
Mr. Brzezinski highlighted three points. First, in &quot;wide-ranging private conversations,&quot; Chinese leaders impressed upon him that the magnitude of their
country's internal transformation made it vulnerable to global political and economic instability. China is especially worried about the consequences of
any major eruption of violence in the Persian Gulf.

Secondly, China is &quot;geopolitically a status quo power.&quot; It says that in dealing with Iran, the U.S. must be guided by strategic patience. Mr. Brzezinski
says, &quot;In China's view, the United States should avoid being drawn into tit-for-tat salvos&quot; but should rather focus on a formula that &quot;effectively forsakes
the allegedly unwanted nuclear option.&quot; Thirdly, Beijing offered help in breaking the U.S.-Iran stalemate. But the U.S. should be &quot;more active in the negotiating
process with Iran.&quot;

China's motivations are no doubt largely self-centred. Iran is a major supplier of oil to China. China, which plans to invest hugely in Iran's oil and gas
fields, intends boosting its bilateral trade to more than $100 billion annually in the near term. It also supplies weapons and industrial products to Iran
and participates in major projects such as the Tehran metro.

Mr. Brzezinski strongly advocates that the U.S. and China become equal stakeholders in resolving the Iran question. Chinese leaders implied in conversations
with him that in actuality, Iran did not pose as serious a crisis as North Korea did, since unlike Pyongyang, Tehran had consistently denied any intent
to acquire nuclear weapons.

Intelligence estimate

Curiously, the Chinese offer came just ahead of the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) representing the consensus view of all 16 American spy agencies
regarding the Iran issue. Coincidence or not, the NIE quintessentially echoed the line of thinking in Beijing. Two conclusions made by the NIE are simply
staggering. First, &quot;Tehran's decisions are guided by a cost-benefit approach rather than a rush to a weapon irrespective of the political, economic, and
military costs.&quot; Secondly, &quot;opportunities for Iran to achieve its security, prestige, and goals for regional influence.might - if perceived by Iran's leaders
as credible - prompt Tehran to extend the current halt to its nuclear weapons programme.&quot;

Why has the Bush administration chosen to come out with the NIE at this point? Indeed, there are straws in the wind. It needs no reiteration that like Banquo's
ghost at Macbeth's banquet table, the uninvited presence at the conference on the Middle East in Annapolis on November 27 was that of Iran. The historic
decision by the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), the flag-bearer of the U.S.

Pakistan at the edge

&quot;I am not afraid,&quot; Benazir Bhutto declaimed at her father's mausoleum two months ago, &quot;of anyone but Allah.&quot; In the last weeks of her life, Benazir demonstrated
that she possessed a depth of conviction that was, beyond dispute, exceptional. When she returned to Pakistan earlier this year after long exile, she made
clear to family and confidantes that she was well aware of the great dangers lying ahead. She was undeterred by the murderous bombing that greeted her
on her return home. During her two tenures as Prime Minister of Pakistan, she was charged by adversaries and critics with corruption, with sponsoring Islamist
terrorism directed at India, with dilettantism. Whatever be the truth in relation to these accusations, the Pakistan People's Party chief showed, in word
and deed, that she possessed the raw courage needed to set past wrongs right. In his last interview before his execution by the military regime of General
Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto said: &quot;I am not afraid of death. I am a man of history and you cannot silence history.&quot; Democrats across Pakistan
will recall these words as they ponder how best to respond to a despicable act by terrorists who made no secret of their loathing at the prospect of a
progressive, secular woman emerging as Pakistan's ruler.

With this body blow to democracy in Pakistan, what is clear is that epic struggles lie ahead for its hard-pressed people. Some analysts fear the assassination
will spell the end of the tentative movement towards democracy witnessed in recent months. While such an outcome will suit the military establishment as
well as the Islamists, it will have dangerously destabilising consequences. As Benazir pointed out movingly in a recent interview, &quot;people are just being
butchered and it has to stop, somebody has to find a solution and my solution is, let's restore democracy.&quot; It was this combination of extraordinary courage
and well-reasoned commitment to democracy that made Benazir stand out among Pakistan's political leaders. Her death illustrates in stark relief the failure
of Pervez Musharraf's regime, which continues to be underwritten by the United States, to confront al-Qaeda- and Taliban-linked religious neoconservatives
who are working to obliterate the last traces of democracy in Pakistan. It is one of the grimmer ironies of history that Benazir was killed at the gates
of Rawalpindi's Liaqat Bagh - the very location where a gunman shot dead Prime Minister Liaqat Ali Khan in 1951, an action some believe was provoked by
his opposition to clerics' calls for Pakistan to be declared an Islamic state. In the decades since, the country has lurched ever closer towards the abyss.
All those who care for its future - and for the future of our shared region - must join hands to ensure it is pulled back from the edge. The Hindu shares
the deep grief of the people of Pakistan over this terrible loss during a time of troubles.

Human costs of climate change

The Human Development Report 2007-2008 of the UNDP draws attention to climate change as a potential impediment to social sector progress in the developing
economies. The question is particularly important for India as it attempts to overcome mass deprivation and associated challenges in various areas. Modest
improvements have been registered over the long term in health, education, and poverty indicators. India's Human Development Index value is rising but
in relative terms the country fares abysmally: 128th in a list of 177 countries. The gains - raising life expectancy at birth by four years and the virtual
doubling of per capita GDP between 1990 and 2005 - are not insignificant. But much more could have been achieved in the social sector after economic liberalisation
had national policy taken on the challenge of overcoming mass deprivation as a priority. A determined state-led expansion of public health, education,
and welfare would have created wider access to good quality healthcare, literacy, universal education, and economic opportunity. Now these unmet goals
must be pursued under the shadow of new costs for climate change mitigation and adaptation.

Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen sets out the human development perspective lucidly in his special contribution to the UNDP report. Development in its true sense,
he points out, is an enabler of human freedoms and well-being, rather than a mere enhancement of inanimate objects of convenience. It is inseparable from
environmental and ecological concerns such as clean air and water, epidemic-free surroundings, and the preservation of all life forms. Well conceived policies
will recognise this need to harmonise economic and environmental imperatives. India cannot avoid factoring in the likely climate change effects: economic
stress from changes in rainfall patterns, debilitating losses in agriculture, the continuing retreat of Himalayan glaciers feeding vital river systems,
and more extreme weather events. The common future of Indians, as with people everywhere, urgently demands policy changes to reduce climate risks . In
the area of climate, India must give up its defensive, do-little stance and become a world leader in working out and implementing emission reduction, mitigation,
and adaptation strategies.

Islamists in the other Europe

Praveen Swami

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

As radical Islam gathers momentum in western Europe, concerns grow in east and central Europe.

Below the crucifix in the magnificent church that presides over the main square of Pecs runs an Arabic inscription extolling another god. When the Ottoman
rule collapsed in Hungary, a tourist brochure unselfconsciously asserts, what was once a mosque &quot;matured into a Catholic church.&quot;

For some, the Arabic-inscribed crucifix is a discomfiting signifier. Hungary is preparing to send troops to Afghanistan to serve alongside its North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation partners. Poland, Bulgaria and Romania, for their part, have committed troops to Iraq.

Some argue this could lead central and eastern Europe into conflict with its Muslim populations, and drag the region into a larger war against Islamists.
Islamists have often laid claim to the swathe of lands running from Indonesia to Spain which were once ruled by Muslim leaders - and central European states
are well aware they lie in this arc.

How well founded are such fears? And just how likely is it that central Europe could become the next battlefield for Islamists? Just a decade ago, the fallout
from the anti-Muslim carnage in Bosnia made it appear probable that central Europe would emerge as a site for the clash of civilisations both Islamic and
Christian neoconservatives have long worked to bring about. Desperate to defend his people during the most murderous conflict Europe has seen since the
Second World War, Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic, opened his country's doors to mujahideen from across the world. Hundreds of Taliban and Al Qaeda-trained
cadre from Afghanistan and West Asia fought alongside Bosnian forces against what was seen as a crusade for the extermination of Islam.

So too did many young people from western Europe, as we are informed by Ed Husain's The Islamist, an autobiographical account of life as an organiser for
the United Kingdom's Hizb ut-Tahrir. Among them was Syed Omar Sheikh, a London School of Economics dropout-turned-terrorist who was released from an Indian
jail in return for the lives of the hostages on board Indian Airlines flight IC 814. Indeed, the war in Bosnia had a truly global impact. Sheikh's mentor
now - Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar - is believed to have helped raise funds for the jihad in Bosnia. Kafeel Ahmad, the Bangalore-trained
engineer who attempted to blow up the Glasgow airport earlier this year, was radicalised by viewing tapes of the carnage.

But a decade on, the spectre of post-communist Europe dissolving into a battlefield between Islam and Christianity appears somewhat surreal. Instead, the
real conflict is unfolding in western Europe - in France, for example, where Islamist-led youth are battling police, or the U.K., where second and third
generation immigrants have been involved in a string of terror plots. But central Europe holds out instructive lessons for the future, which merit close
attention.

From the early 1990s, several West Asian charities and proselytising organisations began operations in central and eastern Europe. Most, though not all,
were funded by Saudi Arabia. They focussed on setting up new mosques and encouraging the adoption of Salafi neoconservative practices. Among the organisations
which acquired a large-scale presence were the World Association of Muslim Youth, the al-Haramein Foundation and the Islamic International Relief Organisation.

As events spiralled out of control in Bosnia - and as Christian Europe stood by and watched the carnage - the Islamist case acquired moral momentum. WAMY,
which also had close links with the now-proscribed Students Islamic Movement of India, was represented in central and eastern Europe by Elfatih Ali Hassnein.
An old friend of Izetbegovic, Hassnein helped facilitate illegal weapons transfers to Bosnia, breaking a United Nations arms embargo of dubious ethical
legitimacy.

Many of the mujahideen who fought in Bosnia married local women, and stayed on, forming the core of what some experts feared would be an Islamist state-within-a-state.
Soon, though, the mujahideen's involvement with car bombings, hostage-taking and armed robbery compelled their wholesale expulsion. In the wake of the
terror strikes of September 11, 2001, Bosnia cooperated with the worldwide crackdown on the Al Qaeda. Six Algerians, for example, were deported from Sarajevo
to Guantanamo Bay.

Such action was facilitated by the fact that Salafi

BJP rising

Continuing its victory run in State Assembly elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party has crowned its decisive wins in Gujarat and Punjab with a 60 per cent
sweep of the seats in Himachal Pradesh. As 2007 draws to a close, the BJP and the Congress will surely marvel at the reversal of political fortunes. Three
years ago, the BJP was a demoralised loser to a Congress basking in the afterglow of two major triumphs - in the May 2004 Lok Sabha election and in the
October 2004 Maharashtra Assembly contest. Today with three successive Assembly election wins, the BJP has not just wiped off the ignominy of the 2004
defeats. It seems to have stolen a march over its rival with a maximum of 18 months left for the 15th general election. The Congress' abysmal performance
in Himachal Pradesh came as no surprise, and as much is evident from the party's stoic acceptance of the verdict. Unlike in Gujarat, the party made no
tall claims here. In an all too familiar story, the State unit was riven by factionalism and the administration was perceived to be corrupt, inefficient,
and lacking the political will to counter the adverse effects of price rise and anti-incumbency. For the BJP, the electoral hat-trick could not have come
at a better time - with Lal Krishna Advani positioned as the party's shadow Prime Minister.

Just where did the Congress go wrong? Punjab and Himachal Pradesh have a history of rejecting incumbent regimes. But in Gujarat, even this fig leaf was
not available to a party whose only selling point was the Gandhi family charisma. Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul drew big crowds in Gujarat. Nevertheless,
the party lost all seven Assembly seats in the Surat Lok Sabha constituency. In the aftermath of the Gujarat debacle, it held its customary introspection
session only to absolve mother and son of all blame. A similar ritual can be expected to follow the Himachal rout. Ms Gandhi's commitment to secularism
and social democracy and her political skills are not in question. After all, she put in place the 2004 winning combination. Yet to regain lost ground,
the Congress needs far more than Ms Gandhi's helmswomanship. It needs a reformed party organisation, a new unity of purpose, and, above all, a fighting
secular spirit that distinguishes it from the BJP and a socio-economic programme that is responsive to mass deprivation and livelihood issues. The party
leading the Central government will count on doing well in 2008 by tapping into anti-incumbency sentiment in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh.
It may also hope to do well in Karnataka. What it cannot afford to do is underestimate the tenacity, mobilising capacity, and alliance-forging and tactical
skills of the BJP, which in recent months has determinedly put its house in order.

Safety in a time of growth

India's aviation industry continues its remarkable growth. Air traffic increased by 27 per cent last year and the number of aircraft has doubled over the
past three years. As Indian skies become more crowded, regulating growth and ensuring air safety have become increasingly important. However, there are
growing concerns within the industry that as regulatory authorities and airlines struggle to sustain this growth and hold on to their margins, safety is
slipping in their list of priorities. While a shortage of pilots and trained personnel looms, airlines, particularly the low-cost carriers, continue to
add new sectors and flights to tap new markets in the face of increasing competition. Airports are becoming crowded, and there has been a sharp rise in
the number of ground accidents in recent months. Poorly maintained runways have also led to an increase in the number of overrun incidents.

What stands out is a lack of foresight and planning in handling growth in a vital sector. The big challenge before the Airports Authority of India (AAI)
as well as the Civil Aviation Ministry that it works for is to ensure that safety is privileged in the pursuit of commercial growth. The very organisation
of aviation authorities in the country raises troubling questions. Safety regulation is under the control of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation
(DGCA), which, like the AAI, works under the Civil Aviation Ministry. In the United States and the United Kingdom, safety monitoring and accident investigating
authorities exist outside the framework of the government. In the U.S., the National Transportation Safety Board, and not the Federal Aviation Administration,
monitors safety. The Board was set up in 1974 by the U. S. Congress with the power to make recommendations that &quot;may be critical of or adverse to any agency
or officials.&quot; In India, it is impossible to envisage the DGCA hauling up its employers for violating safety regulations or irresponsibly handling growth.
There is an imperative need for an independent authority that exists outside the banner of the Ministry. It is hardly reasonable to expect the licensing
authority, entrusted with sustaining the industry's expansion, to regulate - and not mindlessly promote - growth. Countries in the West might envy Indian
aviation's 30 per cent growth rate. But this has been aided by an environment that lacks real checks and balances. India, which is several years behind
implementing internationally accepted standards of air safety, needs urgently to close the gap.

Implications of Benazir's assassination

Ramesh Thakur

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Benazir Bhutto's assassination provides another tragic opportunity to grasp the reality that the destinies of all South Asians are bound up with one another.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Born in the religiously targeted mass slaughters of the innocent with the Partition of the subcontinent in 1947, Pakistan has never escaped from the cycle
of violence, volatility and bloodshed. Benazir Bhutto (1953-2007) is the latest casualty of that murderous cycle. Many features of her life and death are
common to South Asia: birth into and inheritance of a famous political dynasty; political triumphs punctuated with personal failings and assassination
of family members; the weight of carrying the hopes and aspirations of millions of followers against the temptations of collapsing the institutions and
treasury of the state into personal fiefdoms; and political parties that are vehicles of personal and family, political and financial advancement instead
of repositories of competing visions and instruments of national development.

The murderers of 9/11 came out of the mountainous caves of Afghanistan where the Taliban regime, a monstrous creation of the United States and Saudi-backed
mujahideen against the Soviet-installed regime and of Pakistan's search for strategic depth against arch-enemy India, had nurtured them as a potent weapon
against all infidels. For years, India had warned that the epicentre of international terrorism had shifted from the Middle East to Southwest Asia. Like
the warnings of Pakistan as the centre of nuclear proliferation, these were dismissed as the self-interested rants of the regional hegemon that failed
to rise above its local conflict.

Pakistan was created on the premise that the Muslims of the subcontinent could not live in peace under a Hindu-majority rule. As a territorial dispute,
Kashmir could be solved by declaring the Line of Control as the international border. As the embodiment of the mutually negating principles on which India
and Pakistan were founded and their respective identities forged - secularism for India, Islam for Pakistan - any resolution of the Kashmir dispute is
far more problematic. Yet so long as the dispute is not resolved, like other potent symbols of Islamic jihadism, Kashmir too will nurse a bloody grievance.
The existence of Pakistan and the ongoing dispute over Kashmir in turn feed Hindu extremism in India which occasionally targets Christians as well, including
the arson against some churches in Orissa recently.

Westerners tend to forget that before Iraq, the biggest practitioners of suicide terrorism were the largely Hindu Tamils of Sri Lanka who had found sympathy,
support and most likely funds and training grounds across the narrow strait in India. Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a Tamil suicide terrorist in the
middle of a general election campaign in 1991. The Bhutto family saga is strongly reminiscent of the Gandhi-Nehru dynasty in India in the peaks of political
triumph and personal tragedies. Indira Gandhi manipulated Sikh religious extremists to discredit political opponents in Punjab; she was assassinated by
her own Sikh bodyguards in 1984 in the aftermath of the worldwide anger among Sikhs after the assault on their holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in Amritsar,
which had an echo in Canada with the Air India flight from Toronto being bombed in mid-air.

Across the border, similarly, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was drawn into the passion and turmoil of politics and died because of it when hanged by the military
dictator who overthrew him. Whereas in India the assassinated mother was followed by her son throwing himself into the rough and tumble of subcontinental
politics and being felled by an assassin in turn, in Pakistan the father was followed by his daughter who too has now been felled by a suicide terrorist.
Where one military dictator hanged the father, another failed to provide adequate security for the daughter. That she was killed in the garrison town of
Rawalpindi further underlines the chaos and security vacuum in contemporary Pakistan. And while Sanjay Gandhi died in an air accident, Murtaza Bhutto was
killed by the police in 1996 while his sister was Prime Minister, and the other brother Shahnawaz was found dead in his apartment on the French Riviera
in 1985. To complete the analogy, finally, Bhutto family members are politically estranged just as Maneka Gandhi fell out

Anti-terror reforms can't wait

Nothing better demonstrates just how ineffectual India's responses to terrorism has been than the lessons emerging from the ongoing investigation into last
month's court-complex bombings in Uttar Pradesh. Police in Jammu and Kashmir, it transpires, had communications-intelligence that could have led their
counterparts in Uttar Pradesh to the terror cell that carried out the bombing - and thus could have saved twelve lives. While counter-terrorism authorities
in Jammu and Kashmir knew that a Kishtwar-based suspect was in regular contact with then-unknown associates in Faizabad, they chose not to pass on the
available information. No malice was involved. The J &amp; K police had no way of knowing that its wiretaps held the key to preventing a terrorist attack in
another State. Nor did the U. P. Anti-Terrorism Squad know that the J &amp; K police had stumbled on intelligence essential to securing Lucknow, Faizabad,
and Varanasi. Why? Because there is no institutional mechanism or protocols for the police forces in multiple States to collaborate and share information
in the same fluid, seamless ways that terrorists do. In this particular case, different State police forces all had knowledge of a part of the picture
- but there was no one to put the puzzle together.

It isn't hard to compile a long list of comparable failures to collate and correctly interpret intelligence: the Indian Institute of Science attack in Bangalore,
or the Mecca Masjid bombings in Hyderabad are stark examples. While it is easy to blame the police or intelligence services for these failings, India's
politicians and people must look hard at the institutional weaknesses that underpin them. Unlike many other countries, India still has no comprehensive
criminal-intelligence database available to all end-users in real time. The sale of chemicals that can be used to make explosives remains unregulated.
The Intelligence Bureau, which coordinates inter-State counter-terrorism operations, is hopelessly short-staffed and under-funded in comparison with its
global counterparts. Setting up modern systems needs both will and hard cash - and here, both the State and Union governments have come up short. Fighting
terrorism needs a clarity of purpose and a strong focus but India's responses to terror have, for the most part, consisted of setting up committees. In
1999, one such committee - a Group of Ministers who considered national security reform - came up with a blueprint for change that won acceptance across
the political spectrum. Some of it suggestions have been acted upon; most have not. While border security measures have improved, the promised enhancement
of the country's technical intelligence capabilities has been slow while the necessary upgrading of human resources capabilities has just not happened.
The Indian people deserve an explanation - and more important, urgent action.

Tackling communal mischief in Orissa

By setting off a spiral of provocation and retaliation, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad is threatening to push Orissa through another spell of communal violence.
Over the past week, at least 30 churches, prayer houses, and Christian schools and convents have been attacked or burnt down by VHP activists. Although
the State government imposed curfews in the affected Kandhamal district, Hindutva activists put up road blockades in several areas. A police station was
attacked when the police tried to prevent an attack on the Christian community in Brahmanigaon. Three persons were killed in the resultant police firing.
Evidently the administration did not anticipate that the violence, which began on December 23 after an anti-conversion rally led by the VHP was attacked,
allegedly by Christian activists, would escalate so quickly. In some rural areas, the law enforcing authorities failed to act until it was too late. Only
when the situation spun out of control did the State requisition the help of Central paramilitary forces. Naturally, questions have been asked about the
political will of the coalition government of the Biju Janata Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Party to tackle the recurrent communal mischief.

For the past several years, the VHP and its sister organisations have targeted Orissa's Christian minority community, which constitutes a mere 2.44 per
cent of the State's population (which is 94.35 per cent Hindu), especially during the Christmas season. As in January 1999, when Bajrang Dal activists
burnt to death the Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two pre-teen sons in Manoharpur, the conversion bogey is being raised to target Christians
in Orissa. Scheduled Tribes constitute more than one-fifth of the State's population; 88.2 per cent of the ST population is Hindu and 7.4 per cent Christian,
according to the Census of 2001. There is absolutely no evidence to back up the VHP's claim that missionaries have 'forcibly' converted a large number
of tribal folk. What the communal outfits are targeting is &quot;the freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice, and propagate religion&quot;
guaranteed as a fundamental right in Article 25 of the Indian Constitution. The administration of Navin Patnaik has been hamstrung by the BJD's need to
protect its political alliance with the BJP. The Chief Minister, who otherwise has a reputation for sober governance, needs to rise above such considerations
and uphold the rule of law, especially in Kandhamal district.

The unending war in Pakistan's neighbourhood

Hasan Suroor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

After a six-year-long campaign, representing the Western world's combined military might, the &quot;war&quot; in Afghanistan is far from over with a rag-tag band
of guerrillas able to run rings round their sophisticated enemies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

With the world's attention focussed on Pakistan in the wake of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination, it has gone almost unnoticed that in
Afghanistan next door, the Western military campaign against extremist forces (the sort who killed Benazir) has entered its seventh year with a warning
from Lord (Paddy) Ashdown - tipped to be the joint United Nations-European Union envoy to Kabul - that the West has &quot;lost&quot; the war. And the fall of Kabul,
he has warned, means that &quot;Pakistan will also fall&quot; with serious implications for the entire region.

After six years, there is now a tacit acceptance in Western capitals, barring Washington, that military action alone cannot deliver peace in Afghanistan
and the &quot;jackboot&quot; policy preferred by the U.S. will not work, as indeed it has not worked in Iraq where Americans themselves have been forced to co-opt
the disillusioned militant groups to tackle the Al-Qaeda hardcore.

The idea of talking to the Taliban is gaining ground but officially no government wants to be seen to be hobnobbing with the enemy. Hence the sort of contortions
witnessed last week when Kabul expelled two senior Western officials (a U.N. political adviser and an EU envoy) after accusing them of holding meetings
with Taliban leaders.

The expulsions coincided with a blazing row in Britain over reports that the British government too had been in &quot;secret&quot; talks with Taliban representatives,
contrary to its publicly-stated policy of not negotiating with militants.

Claims in a front-page splash in The Daily Telegraph (December 26) that MI6 agents met senior Taliban figures &quot;up to half a dozen times&quot; over the summer
embarrassed the government as only recently Prime Minister Gordon Brown categorically ruled out any talks with the Taliban. In a statement in the Commons
on December 12, Mr. Brown was emphatic: &quot;We will not enter into any negotiations with these people.&quot;

Officially, this remains Britain's position with the Foreign Office insisting that there is no change in the government's policy of &quot;not engaging&quot; with
the Taliban. That was also the line from the U.N. and the EU in the wake of the expulsions of their envoys on the ground that they posed a &quot;serious threat&quot;
to national security because of their alleged links with Taliban leaders. Mervyn Patterson, who was a political adviser to the U.N. mission in Kabul, and
Michael Sample, acting head of the EU mission at the time, were arrested during a visit to the Helmand province where, according to the provincial governor
Aassadulla Wafa, they met Taliban leaders ignoring his warning.

A U.N. spokesman firmly rejected the charge. &quot;We do not talk to the Taliban - full stop. That is not what we were in Helmand province to do,&quot; said an angry
Aleem Siddique, explaining the U.N. position. Whatever the truth in this case and the Telegraph's claims, the developments are part of a larger problem
- namely, the sheer impossibility of a military victory in the &quot;war on terror&quot; in Afghanistan.

After a six-year-long relentless campaign, representing the Western world's combined military might, the &quot;war&quot; in Afghanistan is far from over with a rag-tag
band of guerrillas (with almost no friends in the world beyond a fanatically-motivated tribal network) able to run rings round their sophisticated enemies.
If anything, there has been a resurgence in the Taliban's activity in recent months, inflicting heavy casualties on the coalition forces.

With body bags piling up and no prospect of an early end to the conflict in sight, there is growing pressure on governments whose troops are bogged down
in Afghanistan to find an honourable way out. This means talking to the enemy. And that is what Britain and other European countries - and the U.N. - have
been quietly doing as part of a covert strategy to weaken the Taliban by weaning away ( or &quot;peeling off,&quot; to use a diplomatic jargon) the less ideologically
committed elements through dialogue and inducements, including cash payment to those willing to cooperate.

A crude form of back-channel

Political dynasts and martyrdom

Dynastic politics is South Asia's common currency. Whether it is Sri Lanka or India or Bangladesh or Pakistan, the dynastic principle seems effortlessly
to defy the republicanism of constitutions, political systems, and democratic processes. It mocks the spirit of freedom struggles and movements against
dictatorial rule. It seems peculiarly at home in parties that claim to be pro-poor, have 'roti, kapda, makan' (bread, clothing, shelter) as their mobilisi
ng slogan, and tirelessly chant the mantra of popular democracy. The principle of dynastic privileging in the democratic arena naturally breeds a sense
of entitlement to the republican throne - even among the most improbable of presumptive heirs. The tragic irony of 19-year-old Oxford student, Bilawal
Zardari - catapulted by a brutal killing and the sacred principle of dynastic succession to the 'chairmanship' of the Pakistan People's Party - extolling
democracy as the best 'revenge' on those who assassinated his mother and urging that the party be run &quot;democratically . for the poor and downtrodden people&quot;
of his country will be an enduring memory of 2007. Equally striking was what the young man said at the press conference about the sacrificial principle
in dynastic politics: his father, Asif Ali Zardari, would not be succeeding to the top post (as his mother had willed) and he was taking up the job because
&quot;the chairmanship of the party is a position occupied by martyrs, and we do not know for how long my father will be able to keep his position.&quot; It is a
terrible thought but it can be substantiated with facts: in more than one South Asian case, dynastic successors have fallen victim to assassins' bullets
or bombs.

The tragic sacrifices, in turn, inspire millions of people, generate groundswells of sympathy, bring about sharp swings in the public mood, and power political
parties to win elections. The political situation in Pakistan, caught in a maelstrom, has been transformed overnight by the martyrdom of Benazir Bhutto,
a courageous but deeply flawed political leader whose record in opposition was far more creditable than her performance in office. Towards the end of her
life, her popularity in Pakistan clearly suffered from the impression that she had struck a less than honourable deal with the discredited dictator, Pervez
Musharraf, and that, unlike her chief political rival, Nawaz Sharif, she was willing to contest elections under dubious conditions in order to have a third
term as Prime Minister. Post-Benazir, a PPP dominated by Asif Zardari is poised to make a clean sweep of the parliamentary election, which is scheduled
for January 8 and cannot, in any case, be put off by more than a few weeks. Even though they are likely to be the losers, the Pakistan Muslim League (N)
and its chief, Mr. Sharif, have done the right thing in agreeing to reverse their decision to boycott the polls. Paradoxically, as Bilawal Bhutto Zardari
might have implied, the martyrdom of his mother promises to provide a democratic and perhaps even bloodless way out of the deep crisis in which Pakistan
finds itself.

An end to the stalemate

Belgium's new interim dispensation, headed by the outgoing liberal Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt and drawn from rival parties representing the two main
linguistic regions, ends a six-month political stalemate. The deadlock in the formation of government by the victors in the June 2007 elections - constituents
of the so-called &quot;orange-blue&quot; umbrella coalition - reflects the strains experienced by the Belgians in the country's evolution f rom a unitary to a federal
system. Talks on a common programme broke down on at least four occasions and the Flemish Christian Democrat leader and potential prime minister had to
step down twice as the official negotiator. His party's cohabitation with the far-right secessionist and anti-immigrant ally on an agenda of self-rule
for the Dutch-speaking Flanders in the north is at the root of the current crisis.

Another sticking point in the conservative-led coalition has been the demand for the bifurcation of the electoral district of the Brussels Capital Region,
where French is the language of the majority and where the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has its headquarters. After gaining independence from the
Netherlands in 1830, Belgium's predominantly French and Dutch populations co-existed in the cosy political comfort of the uniquely Belgian consociational
model of democracy, characterised by mutual accommodation among political elites. This phase of innocence eventually gave way to the assertion of competing
demands for linguistic and cultural autonomy from the mid-20th century, culminating in a series of constitutional reforms from 1970 that led towards a
federation of power-sharing arrangements. Extreme nationalist forces have sought to exploit the economic backwardness of the French-dominated areas for
articulating separatist claims of the prosperous Flanders. To suggest a break-up of the country, as commentators have tended to do, is perhaps premature,
if not downright naïve, and it exaggerates the importance of the far-right that is a fringe element. Belgium's formidable centrist and left forces may
well rise to contain this misapprehension.

Agricultural strategy, internal security &amp; sovereignty

M.S. Swaminathan

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

If the National Policy for Farmers 2007 is implemented in letter and spirit by the Central and State governments, we can say goodbye to the era of farmers'
suicides.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The year 2007 ended with some significant steps in areas relating to internal security and food sovereignty. In November 2007, alarmed by the persistence
of agrarian distress in several parts of the country resulting in those engaged in a life-sustaining profession taking their own lives, the Government
of India placed a National Policy for Farmers in Parliament. The document is based on the draft submitted by the National Commission on Farmers in October

2006. This Policy , the first of its kind in the history of either colonial or independent India, calls for a paradigm shift from a commodity-centred to
a human-centred approach in agricultural planning and programmes. The aim of the Policy is to stimulate attitudes and actions that should result in assessing
agricultural progress in terms of improvement in the income of farm families not only to meet their consumption requirements, but also to enhance their
capacity to invest in farm-related activities. The National Policy for Farmers has for the first time recognised the &quot;need to focus on the economic well
being of the farmers, rather than just on production.&quot; If this Policy is implemented in letter and spirit by the Central and State governments, we can
say goodbye to the era of farmers' suicides.

Another area where some recent policy decisions were announced relates to containing the threat to internal security caused by the spread of Naxalite movements.
Here, the major focus has been on strengthening police and para-military forces and providing them with better arms and equipment. While this is important,
we should learn lessons from the tragic human consequences of the U.S.-led strategies to contain terrorism. History teaches us that violence breeds violence.
Even as the Chief Minister's Conference on Internal Security announced the decision to strengthen the police-centric approach to contain the Naxalite danger,
there was a report that Naxalite leaders have also decided to modernise their weapon power. Where will this end?

A third development is in the area of food sovereignty. India's decision to import wheat is facing problems related to both cost and quality. The international
prices of food grains are going up, partly due to the steep increase in the price of petroleum products and the consequent desire to produce more bio-fuels,
leading to the diversion of prime farm land from food to fuel production. In his book, Hand of Destiny, C. Subramaniam, who was Minister for Food and Agriculture
from 1964 to 1967, has described vividly the humiliation he had to undergo while seeking urgent food shipment under the PL 480 programme of the U.S. Indira
Gandhi's decision to build substantial food reserves was related to her clear understanding of the relationship between food self-reliance and national
sovereignty.

What should we do in 2008 to concurrently strengthen internal security and national sovereignty? The means to both lies in accelerated agricultural advance
based on conservation farming, or what I have been referring to as the &quot;ever-green revolution&quot; pathway of improving productivity in perpetuity without
associated ecological harm.

Let me take the example of Jharkhand, a Naxalite hotspot, and examine what needs to be done to avoid the gradual collapse of a democratic system of governance.

Of Jharkhand's total population of 27 million, nearly 21 million, or 78 per cent live in villages. Nearly 49 per cent of the population lives below the
poverty line, and India's poverty line is probably the most austerely defined in the world. In some districts like Gumla and Simdega, where Naxalite activity
is serious, more than 85 per cent of the predominantly tribal workforce depends on crop and animal husbandry and minor forest produce for its livelihood.
Over 80 per cent of the farm holdings belong to the small and marginal farmer category. More than 80 per cent of the average annual rainfall of 1300 mm
to 1400 mm is received between June and September, when farmers cultivate crops such as paddy, maize, pulses and oilseeds. Productivity is low and the
marketable surplus is consequently modest. Systematic steps to harvest and store the rainwater during the South West monsoon period and to use the conserved
water for a second October to March crop

Signs of stability and maturity

For the Indian stock markets, 2007 was an exceptional year, not merely because of the phenomenal rise of the benchmark stock indices, the Sensex and the
Nifty. The Sensex climbed from 12,500 in early January - itself seen to be reflecting healthy valuations - to close at 20,257 at the end of the year. The
Nifty too set up new records and ended the year at 6,138. The strong performance of the domestic stock markets is part of the recent trend of Asian and
other emerging markets coming into their own. The slowing down of the U.S. economy along with the persistent weakness of the American dollar has caused
fund managers to seek more lucrative but safe avenues elsewhere. India and a few other markets filled the bill ideally. While foreign institutional investors
(FIIs) have always been the dominant force behind the rise in market valuations, their motivations are now more varied. Besides, the successful economic
growth story, with an average annual GDP growth rate of 9 per cent and above, remains intact. The onset of the sub-prime crisis in the United States in
September, with strong negative connotations for the financial systems of the developed world, was the time when India along with a few other markets emerged
as sanctuaries attracting large investments from across the globe. The Sensex went up from 16,000 to 20,000 in a matter of three months.

However, the important messages of the year 2007 go beyond the role of the foreign institutional investors. When the final tally is made it will be seen
that, although the FIIs will be the single largest group of investors in the Indian markets, they are less dominant than in the recent past. Domestic financial
institutions, led by the public sector LIC and the mutual funds, have invested substantial amounts and, on many occasions, taken positions that neutralised
the FII actions, as they did remarkably in November and December when the FIIs pulled some $5 billion out of Indian stocks. Indian financial institutions
were able to check what would have been a precipitous fall. The domestic retail investor base remains weak but volatility, which has been a worrisome feature,
is showing signs of moderating. Insurance companies have overtaken mutual funds as the second largest category of investors. With a variety of investors
having divergent objectives and different time horizons operating in the field and with no single category driving the prices, the Indian stock markets
seem to be moving towards a greater degree of stability and maturity. For the new year, there cannot be a more salutary message.

Messy divorce, unhappy reunion

More often than not, the losses from a divorce are far greater than any gains from a reunion. A homecoming cannot undo any of the damage K. Karunakaran
did to himself and his party when he walked out of the Congress more than two years ago. In 2005, the consummate factionalist who was thrice Chief Minister
of Kerala took away with him several members of the Legislative Assembly, and damaged the organisational structure of the Congress beyond repair. Now at
the beginning of 2008, the veteran who is only six months shy of becoming a nonagenarian brings back to his parent party nothing of significance - not
even his son, K. Muraleedharan. The Congress high command, if it has learnt anything at all from past experience, will not trust Mr. Karunakaran with any
kind of decision-making role. The reunion might have been originally conceived to secure the political future of his children, as also of the few remaining
loyal supporters. However, as things stand, Mr. Muraleedharan is not willing to desert the Nationalist Congress Party. Although the father believes the
son will follow him back into the parent party sooner or later, Mr. Muraleedharan has signalled his aversion to the reunion in no uncertain terms. Indeed,
his supporters went to the extent of attacking the venue of a meeting where the Karunakaran faction was discussing the reunion option.

Mr. Muraleedharan must be acutely aware that his camp's bargaining power has been severely weakened. If he is to return to the Congress fold, he will be
obliged to settle for far less than what he enjoyed in the organisation at the time he walked away with his father to form a new party, the Democratic
Indira Congress (Karunakaran). As the Assembly election of 2006 demonstrated, DIC(K), even as part of the Congress-led United Democratic Front, was a poor
vote-gatherer. The party subsequently merged with the NCP, but it has gained nothing from this manoeuvre other than the 'nationalist' label. Unless Mr.
Karunakaran is able to wrest some significant organisational post for him, Mr. Muraleedharan is unlikely to be tempted to join the Congress. But the father's
reasoning seems to be more pragmatic. He cannot expect to gain anything for himself in the Congress, but he appears to have grasped the fruitlessness of
managing the NCP when it is not guaranteed a meaningful place in either the UDF or the Left Democratic Front. In Kerala's polarised politics, a third front
is likely to be squeezed into electoral insignificance and, in any case, it will not offer immediate returns. The homecoming is decidedly a sign of Mr.
Karunakaran's desperation. Nothing of political significance needs to be read into this unhappy reunion.

South Africa headed for leadership change?

M.S. Prabhakara

The election of Jacob Zuma as the African National Congress president is certainly a setback to Thabo Mbeki and may mark the beginning of the decline of
his political authority.

Despite the acrimony of the bruising electoral battles at the 52nd national conference of the African National Congress (December 16-19) at Polokwane, it
would be wrong to see the outcome as the beginning of the ANC's end as a movement and political party. However, it was certainly a setback to the incumbent
ANC president, Thabo Mbeki, and may even mark the beginning of the decline of his political authority even though he will remain President of South Africa
till A pril 2009. This position invests him with executive power that, according to his rival, Jacob Zuma's supporters, is already being misused to hobble
Mr. Zuma and curb his political ambitions, if not destroy him politically.

The scale and near-totality of the rejection of Mr. Mbeki and his supporters by the national conference are truly immense. Not merely did he lose the contest
for ANC president to Mr. Zuma, the ANC deputy president whom he sacked as the country's Deputy President in June 2005; all the other candidates for the
remaining five top party executive positions (deputy president, national chairperson, secretary general, treasurer general and deputy secretary general),
openly identified with Mr. Mbeki, lost to known Zuma supporters. Further, the outcome of the election to the powerful 80-member National Executive Committee
(NEC), 'the highest organ of the ANC between Conferences [with] the authority to lead the organisation,' a day later, emphatically reconfirmed the overwhelming
support Mr. Zuma enjoys in the organisation. Again, almost all known Mbeki supporters were defeated, including three of the five who had formed the Mbeki
'ticket' - a rather inaccurate American importation - for the six top positions.

Among the notable and vocal Mbeki supporters who failed to retain their seats in the powerful NEC were Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, who was appointed Deputy
President of the country after Mr. Zuma was sacked; ANC national chairperson Mosiuoa 'Terror' Lekota, who earlier lost the contest for secretary general;
Smuts Ngoynyama, head of the ANC president's office; Frank Chikane, director general in the presidency; Essop Pahad, Cabinet Minister in the presidency;
Ronnie Kasrils, Minister for Intelligence; Charles Nqkula, Safety and Security Minister, who was earlier replaced as chairperson of the South African Communist
Party (SACP) by Gwede Mantshse and was now the new ANC secretary general. However, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, the Foreign Minister who Mr. Mbeki favoured
for deputy president but lost the contest, and Joel Netshithenze, a close Mbeki advisor who had lost the contest for national chairperson, managed to retain
their NEC seats.

Significantly, while most ministers dealing with the economy failed to retain their seats, Trevor Manuel, Finance Minister and main driver of the macroeconomic
policy, which was firmly opposed by both the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) and the SACP who backed Mr. Zuma, retained his seat, albeit
at a lowly 57th position, in contrast to the first position he secured at the 2002 national conference in Stellenbosch.

This growth strategy, encapsulated in the June 1996 document, Growth, Employment and Redistribution (GEAR), under President Nelson Mandela has, from its
inception, been contested by Cosatu and the SACP, partners of the ANC at the political level even if not formally in the government as Cosatu and SACP
members. Even sections of the ANC are known to be opposed to GEAR. However, the ANC-SACP-Cosatu tripartite alliance, forged during the struggle against
apartheid, continues to be operative, though in the years since liberation it has been fraught with tension, mainly because of differences over the macroeconomic
policy. The alliance has not broken down, despite the open differences over the Zuma issue, and the wish-fulfilling prognoses of the dominant sections
of the media.

Considering the outcome, which was evident in the very composition of the nearly 4,000 delegates elected from the branches, most of them Zuma supporters,
one wonders why Mr. Mbeki, with two terms as ANC president, decided to enter the fray at all. The reason could well be his genuine conviction that Mr.
Zuma, whose personality flaws are more apparent than those of his peers in the ANC, was not fit to be his successor as head of the party and the state.
The 'irretrievable breakdown' between the two

Out of bounds for SEZs

A coastal State with an area of 3,700 square kilometres and a population of about 1.4 million, Goa has always been extremely sensitive to the impact of
unrestrained economic development. The upsurge of public activism against the setting up of Special Economic Zones, which eventually forced the State government
to announce the scrapping of all 15 such projects, is an impressive case in point. Early last year, a similar agitation coerced the government into calling
for a re vision of the Goa Regional Plan 2011, a controversial document that opened up large swathes of land, including green belts and coastal stretches,
for construction. The broad-based agitation against SEZs has demonstrated the power of popular protest in the State. Those opposed to the projects had
questioned the propriety of the government acquiring large tracts of land and then selling them to promoters at low prices. There were also suspicions
that some of the SEZs were real estate speculative plays, fronts for the entry of big construction companies.

Ironically, the government's defence of the projects on the ground that they would result in a sharp surge in employment boomeranged on it. It led to the
SEZ issue getting tied up with that of Goan identity, with worries that the projects would attract large numbers of 'outsiders' and alter the State's demographic
profile. The very nature of Goa demands that issues of land use, environmental management, industrial development, and resource conservation need to be
looked at independently - in a way that takes into account the State's unique economic and socio-cultural character. The tiny State, which attracts more
than 12 per cent of foreign tourists visiting India and about 75 per cent of the direct charter traffic, is one of the country's most popular tourist destinations.
Ecological well-being - a high priority for the people of Goa and also the basis of its appeal as a tourism hot spot - must not be diminished by short-sighted
developmental projects. The scrapping of the SEZ projects, which has been well received by all major political parties in the State, should put a definitive
end to the long-drawn out controversy. The Digambar Kamath government must be commended for respecting the wishes of the people and taking a decision to
keep Goa totally SEZ-free. In turn, the Central government must respect this democratic outcome and help the State government speedily resolve all remaining
issues, especially the question of how land already allotted to private parties in the three notified SEZs will be recovered.

What affordable housing takes

It will take extraordinary political commitment and liberal public funding during the 11th Plan for affordable housing to become a credible goal. The National
Urban Housing and Habitat Policy of the United Progressive Alliance government seeks to make access to housing, long acknowledged as a fundamental right,
a reality for all. The task is staggering even if we go by conservative estimates. The housing shortage to be met during the Plan is 26.53 million units,
which incl ude the backlog from the 10th Plan. If the existing stock of poor quality dwellings and the growing urbanisation-driven demand are taken into
account, the real deficit will be even higher. The new national policy has the laudable objective of prioritising housing access for the Scheduled Castes,
Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, minorities, economically weaker sections (EWS), women, and the physically handicapped. Improving housing for
the EWS is not a new goal; it has been incorporated in city development plans for years. But it has not been a success because it is poorly enforced and
does not have an innovative financing mechanism.

By way of initiatives to improve housing supply, the new housing and habitat policy suggests repealing land ceiling Acts, amending rent Acts, relaxing building
rules like the floor area ratio, and promoting integrated townships. The first two initiatives are carry-forwards from earlier policies and the rest will
deliver only when the subsidies are directed towards the target groups and realised. A functional new rent Act to protect the interests of landlord and
tenant alike is overdue. But this alone will not be enough. As UN-HABITAT studies recommend, rental housing is one of the essential housing options and
needs to be further explored through creative financial schemes. The policy encourages private sector participation in housing for the needy. This will
be productive if there is an efficient regulatory framework that assures sufficient delivery of affordable housing. In the main, the housing policy must
recognise that the real challenge in urban housing concerns the economically weaker sections who have no bankable assets and look up to the state for meeting
their basic needs. Without fundamental and deep-going reform, the housing policy is unlikely to make any major impact. The housing deficit has led to a
quarter of the country's urban population living in some of the worst slums found anywhere in the world, insecure and perpetually in conflict with the
more affluent and the state. The remedy lies in creating more public housing and expanding common spaces.

The race for influence in West Asia

Atul Aneja

The National Intelligence Estimate's findings on Iran may mark the beginning of Washington's post-Cold War decline in West Asia.

The full impact of the observations in the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) report - produced collectively by Washington's numerous intelligence agencies
- on the Iranian nuclear programme is still unfolding. However, it is evident that after the release of the report, according to which Iran has not had
a nuclear weapons programme since 2003, power equations in the world's oil heartland are shifting dramatically.

Iran, fourth largest producer of oil, and Saudi Arabia, global leader, are rapidly consolidating their political influence in the region. The other countries
that are also enhancing their geostrategic profile in West Asia's energy bastion include Russia and China. After voting twice against Iran in the International
Atomic Energy Agency - apparently at Washington's behest - India also appears to be making a belated attempt at mending fences with Tehran. For the first
time after World War II, the United States is struggling to retain its substantial politico-military influence in the region.

Iran and Saudi Arabia, along with Iraq and the rest of the Persian Gulf states - Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman - hold the largest reserves of oil in the
world. Any change in the international pecking order in this region, therefore, is bound to have a profound impact on the world's economy and politics.

The NIE's findings have already unhinged the case for war against Tehran. Its conclusion that Iran ceased its weapons programme in 2003 implies that Tehran
does not pose a nuclear threat to anyone in the near future. The findings have also weakened the case for tightening sanctions.

The NIE's clean chit appears to have raised by several notches the relatively low-key interaction between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Both countries exercise
enormous influence in their constituencies in the region. Saudi Arabia is now widely recognised as the de facto leader of the Arab world. It has taken
the lead in trying to resolve the Arab-Israeli dispute. The 22-nation Arab League has already adopted the plan of the Saudi monarch, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz,
to resolve the Israel-Palestine dispute. Riyadh also exercises considerable clout because of the key role it can play in the global oil markets. Besides,
Saudi Arabia is the birthplace of Islam and two of the holiest shrines revered by Muslims the world over are in the Kingdom. The footprint of Saudi influence
is, therefore, seen far and wide.

There have been significant changes in the foreign policy of Saudi Arabia, known for long as a faithful U.S. ally, after King Abdullah's accession in 2005.
The new monarch adopted a &quot;look east&quot; policy, which became evident when he chose India, Malaysia and China for his first overseas visit. Stepping out of
line from the Washington-led peace process on Palestine, King Abdullah engaged both the Fatah and rival Hamas on its home turf in order to persuade them
to form a national unity government. He met with some success when the factions agreed in Makkah to accept a political compromise despite Washington's
strong opposition to the deal.

Despite the setback the initiative suffered when bitter street battles broke out in Gaza and led to the virtual partition of Palestinian territories between
the Fatah and Hamas, the Saudi monarch has not given up. Hamas leader Khalid Meshaal recently revisited Saudi Arabia and met King Abdullah. Efforts are
being made to revive talks between Hamas and the Fatah, in order to advance the Saudi Arbia-initiated Makkah peace process.

Iran, on the other hand, exercises unique influence, especially among the region's Shia population. Its substantial influence in Bahrain, a country with
a majority Shia population and Sunni leadership, is well known. Iran is also a player in oil-rich Kuwait. Besides, ties between Iran and the Hizbollah
in Lebanon are extremely close. The Hizbollah's profile in Beirut as well as the region rose dramatically after it blunted the Israeli attack on Lebanon
in August 2006.

Saudi Arabia and Iran began to work closely together after sectarian violence in Iraq inflamed the region. Lebanon became the first nation in which both
countries decided to coordinate their activities in order to heal its growing sectarian and religious divide. While the Iranians were well positioned to
influence the Shias under the Amal and Hizbollah movements, the Saudis could exercise clout over the wealthy Sunni community, which had made considerable
investments in Saudi Arabia and vice versa. The interaction proved fruitful and now helped internal
