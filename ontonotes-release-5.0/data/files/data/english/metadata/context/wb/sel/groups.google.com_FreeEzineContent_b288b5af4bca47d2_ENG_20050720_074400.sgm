7 Tips for Beautiful Skin
Written By: Mike Law
Wealth On Tap

For most women, part of their morning and evening routines
involve a skincare regiment of applying cremes, moisturizers,
tonics, lotions, and the like. Why do women put themselves
through this? To combat the signs of aging, and to maintain
youthful looks and beautiful skin! However, how many women
consider what is in the products they are using?

Some women probably do not realize that what they are putting on
their skin may actually be undermining what they are trying to
prevent to begin with. In fact, the average woman puts twelve
products on her skin daily, most of which contain harmful
chemical preservatives. Dr. Myron Wentz, founder and chairperson
of USANA Health Sciences has this to say about beauty in the
June/July 2005 issue of the &quot;USANA Health Sciences&quot; magazine:
&quot;Some say that beauty is only skin deep. Nonsense! I believe that
true beauty is a reflection of true health, and true health
begins deep inside each and every cell in the body. But true
health and true beauty have an outer component, which is why we
require protection from environmental insults such as solar
radiation, pollutants in our environment and the drying effects
of air. . . The fact is, you simply cannot contain a healthy body
if your skin isn't healthy. And your skin can't be healthy if
your are subjecting it to toxic substances that are ultimately
absorbed into your body.&quot;

So, what can women do? How can they combat environmental
pollutants, the affect of solar radiation, and the drying effects
of air? How can they be sure they are using the very best
products on their skin so they can be healthy inside and out?
Here are 7 tips to assist in this process:

1. Be very aware of what is in skincare products. Use products
that are all natural as much as possible.

2. Look for products that contain Dermal Surface Renewal
Technology. DSR smoothes away existing signs of aging such
as laugh lines, crows feet, and dullness.

3. Use products that have regenisomes. Regenisomes penetrate the
skin to speed cell renewal after sun exposure. They also use
the light of photosomes to undo sun damage, and have
ultrasomes to renew skin while sleeping.

4. Find products with Proteo-C and Proflavonol-T. These two
vitamins protect the skin from premature aging caused by the
sun, pollution, and other environmental factors. They also
provide advanced nutrition to the skin to keep it appearing
smooth and firm.

5. If possible, use products that are paraben free. Parabens are
synthetic chemical preservatives that are widely used in
personal care products such as shampoos, conditioners, hair
styling products, make-up, facial masks, skin lotions and
creams, and deodorants. They also are typically found in baby
lotions, shampoos, and other personal care products for
infants and children. In addition, parabens are in many foods
and pharmaceutical products. Researchers are beginning to
find parabens in benign and malignant human breast tumors.
While some studies have challenged their toxicity in many
products and question their long term affect on humans, using
products that are paraben free can eliminate the risk of
exposure to this harmful chemical.

6. Drink plenty of water! Water hydrates skin and hair as well
as flushes toxins out of the body.

7. Limit stress or learn to manage it effectively. Stress is
harmful both emotionally and physically. Find that stress
reliever activity that works best and use it on a daily basis!

Follow the above 7 tips to true beauty and health.
