&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I don't believe it to be a complete waste of time. Checkout today's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Breakpoint:

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What Darwinism Can't Do
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The Edge of Evolution

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;October 19, 2007

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The intelligent design (ID) movement has been accused of a lot of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;things over the years. Among the mildest of those accusations is that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;ID is just religion masquerading as science.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Anyone who could seriously think that, cannot be paying attention.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Intelligent design, as defined by the Discovery Institute, teaches
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;simply &quot;that certain features of the universe and of living things are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected [random]
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;process such as natural selection.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Natural Selection isn't random.

&gt;&gt; &gt;If Natural Selection isn't random, as you've just stated, then it must
&gt;&gt; &gt;be directed.

&gt;&gt; That really depends on what you mean by &quot;directed&quot;. Are falling
&gt;&gt; objects directed? Do you consider the cubic shape of salt crystals to
&gt;&gt; be the result of direction?

&gt;&gt; &gt;And I'll claim victory for my side a second time.

&gt;&gt; I think that we can agree that there are regularities in nature. If
&gt;&gt; you want to claim that admission as a victory, it seems like a pretty
&gt;&gt; small one.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Of
&gt;&gt; &gt;course, I did it the first time below, however, I'm scrolling up to
&gt;&gt; &gt;answer each of your points. See if you can figure that out :)

&gt;&gt; Were you in a hurry?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That's it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It boils down to &quot;Somewhere, somehow, someone did something, at some
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time. Maybe.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;I'd remove the maybe, and you'd be right.

&gt;&gt; That's a pretty vague claim, and can encompass everything from God(s)
&gt;&gt; to aliens to time travelers. Wouldn't it be amazing if the scenario
&gt;&gt; depicted in 2001: A Space Odyssey were true? Yet ID advocates don't
&gt;&gt; find this to be an interesting question.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It does not attempt to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;define or describe that cause.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why not? Why don't ID advocates find that to be a question worth
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pursuing?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Because at that point, beliefs are called into question,

&gt;&gt; So what? In science, beliefs are called into question all the time.

&gt;&gt; &gt;including I
&gt;&gt; &gt;would guess, yours. Which you haven't actually stated in this
&gt;&gt; &gt;thread....

&gt;&gt; The only beliefs relevant to a scientific question is the belief that
&gt;&gt; nature isn't trying to trick us when we observe it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;It's more important to decide whether or not ID is fact first,

&gt;&gt; ID advocates have already done that, haven't they? If not, why are
&gt;&gt; people trying to teach it in schools?

&gt;&gt; &gt;and
&gt;&gt; &gt;then we can move on and decide if we can figure out if there's one or
&gt;&gt; &gt;many designers, and who that is.

&gt;&gt; Recognizing design is dependent on understanding the motivations of
&gt;&gt; the designer. The two are inseparably intertwined.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Most scientists who subscribe to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;intelligent design do believe in some form of evolution. And some of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;them are not even believers in the Bible-they are secularists.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Who?

&gt;&gt; &gt;In an opinion piece of limited length, I don't believe he needs to
&gt;&gt; &gt;list them.

&gt;&gt; Yeah, he does. Didn't you write in news:ff84ij$f8m$1@reader1.panix.com
&gt;&gt; that

&gt;&gt;      Unless you're willing to provide this supposed evidence, I'm not
&gt;&gt;      going to be convinced on just your say so....

&gt;&gt; Why does Colson get a free pass?

&gt;&gt; &gt;They do indeed exist, if you were to take the time to do a
&gt;&gt; &gt;search....

&gt;&gt; It's not my job to support Colson's claims.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;They
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;simply believe that Darwinism does not have all the answers,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;especially about how life originated. (Darwin himself never pretended
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;certainty on that.)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But Darwin never intended evolution to explain the origin of life.

&gt;&gt; &gt;You're serious? What do you call his first book,

&gt;&gt; &quot;Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;and subsequent works?

&gt;&gt; They certainly have nothing to do with the origin of life. Abiogenesis
&gt;&gt; is separate from evolution.

&gt;&gt; &gt;If A does not imply B, then this thread is over. And the side of,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;There is a creator&quot; wins. Note the small C.

&gt;&gt; I don't know if you'll interpret what follows as a victory or not.
&gt;&gt; Here's the last sentence of the sixth edition of The Origin of
&gt;&gt; Species:

&gt;&gt;      There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers,
&gt;&gt;      having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms
&gt;&gt;      or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on
&gt;&gt;      according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning
&gt;&gt;      endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and
&gt;&gt;      are being evolved.

&gt;&gt; Even Darwin saw biological evolution as being separate from
&gt;&gt; abiogenesis.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Now, with the publication of Michael Behe's second book, there is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;little excuse left for anyone to remain ignorant of what intelligent
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;design actually is. Behe, you may remember, is the professor of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;biological science from Lehigh University who shook up the scientific
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;world when he published Darwin's Black Box over a decade ago. Now he
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;has written The Edge of Evolution: The Search for the Limits of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Darwinism. Behe leaves no doubt of his belief in natural selection. He
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;even goes much further than many of us, including myself, by declaring
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;his belief in a common ancestor.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why does the writer reject that when Behe doesn't?

&gt;&gt; &gt;See below.

&gt;&gt; You never get around to addressing the question.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;In short, he is more than willing to acknowledge common ground with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the evolutionists. All he is trying to show here is that there are
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;certain things that Darwinism cannot answer.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But no one ever claimed that Darwinism had an answer for everything.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Isn't that what youv'e been claiming this entire thread?

&gt;&gt; Where did I do that?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Maybe you
&gt;&gt; &gt;need to restate your arguments.

&gt;&gt; My argument is that biological evolution happens. That's it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Are you now claiming that Darwinism
&gt;&gt; &gt;and evolution are mutually exclusive?

&gt;&gt; No. What makes you think that?

&gt;&gt; &gt;If you're now claiming that
&gt;&gt; &gt;your entire argument is flawed,

&gt;&gt; Fortunately, I'm not.

&gt;&gt; &gt;then clearly, we have to look to other
&gt;&gt; &gt;sources to find the answers.

&gt;&gt; The answers to what? The reason for the existence of the tree of life?
&gt;&gt; Biological evolution does a pretty good job of that, as even Behe
&gt;&gt; admits.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But even for that, he
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;gets pilloried. The New York Times showed Behe's book the ultimate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;disrespect by assigning someone who had publicly disagreed with and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;denounced him to review it: the vehement &quot;anti-theist&quot; Richard
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Dawkins, of all people. So much for the objectivity of the New York
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Times.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why is it that disrespectful? Should the reviewer have been someone
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; who agreed with everything Behe wrote? If ID isn't about religion, why
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is Dawkins's atheism relevant?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Because journalistic integrity went out the window a long time ago.

&gt;&gt; That's an unsupported assertion.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Clearly, you get a different review based on the reviewer of the book.

&gt;&gt; I won't argue that. But why is atheism relevant to the review of a
&gt;&gt; supposedly scientific book?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Someone with a preconceived notion against the subject being reviewed,
&gt;&gt; &gt;will probably not be objective.

&gt;&gt; Dawkins is biased against science?

&gt;&gt; &gt;And the answer to your question is,
&gt;&gt; &gt;the reviewer should've been someone on the NY Times staff, a opposed
&gt;&gt; &gt;to bringing in an outside source with his own agenda, to promote his
&gt;&gt; &gt;own book.

&gt;&gt; Here's the review: http://select.nytimes.com/preview/2007/07/01/books/1154680128921.html .
&gt;..
&gt;&gt; Where does Dawkins promote his book?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That would be roughly the equivalent of the New York Times
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;asking me to review one of Dawkins's books. Fat chance.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Naturally, Dawkins accuses Behe of doing exactly what he does not do:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Namely, he suggests that Behe states that where evolution reaches its
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;limits, &quot;God must step in to help.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Who does the writer think the designer(s) are?

&gt;&gt; &gt;Chuck Colson is a God fearing Christian, so, my guess is, that he
&gt;&gt; &gt;thinks that God is the designer. If you're referring to Behe, I don't
&gt;&gt; &gt;know what he thinks, however, I have a good idea.

&gt;&gt; If Behe thinks the designer is God, why is it a problem for Colson
&gt;&gt; when Dawkins writes that &quot;God must step in to help&quot;?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Behe does no such thing. What he does is provide a series of case
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;studies, such as the malaria virus,

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Malaria isn't a virus. Did the writer of this piece actually read the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; book?

&gt;&gt; &gt;I'm sure he did read the book. Is this part of your argument relevant
&gt;&gt; &gt;to the quote at hand?

&gt;&gt; If Colson doesn't understand what's being discussed, why should anyone
&gt;&gt; care about his opinion? It's like someone discussing electric power
&gt;&gt; when they think

&gt; &gt;&gt; Biological evolution does a pretty good job of that, as even Behe
&gt; &gt;&gt; admits.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But even for that, he
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;gets pilloried. The New York Times showed Behe's book the ultimate
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;disrespect by assigning someone who had publicly disagreed with and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;denounced him to review it: the vehement &quot;anti-theist&quot; Richard
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Dawkins, of all people. So much for the objectivity of the New York
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Times.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why is it that disrespectful? Should the reviewer have been someone
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; who agreed with everything Behe wrote? If ID isn't about religion, why
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is Dawkins's atheism relevant?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Because journalistic integrity went out the window a long time ago.

&gt; &gt;&gt; That's an unsupported assertion.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Clearly, you get a different review based on the reviewer of the book.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I won't argue that. But why is atheism relevant to the review of a
&gt; &gt;&gt; supposedly scientific book?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Someone with a preconceived notion against the subject being reviewed,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;will probably not be objective.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Dawkins is biased against science?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And the answer to your question is,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the reviewer should've been someone on the NY Times staff, a opposed
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to bringing in an outside source with his own agenda, to promote his
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;own book.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Here's the review: http://select.nytimes.com/preview/2007/07/01/books/1154680128921.html .
&gt; &gt;..
&gt; &gt;&gt; Where does Dawkins promote his book?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That would be roughly the equivalent of the New York Times
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;asking me to review one of Dawkins's books. Fat chance.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Naturally, Dawkins accuses Behe of doing exactly what he does not do:
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Namely, he suggests that Behe states that where evolution reaches its
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;limits, &quot;God must step in to help.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Who does the writer think the designer(s) are?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Chuck Colson is a God fearing Christian, so, my guess is, that he
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;thinks that God is the designer. If you're referring to Behe, I don't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;know what he thinks, however, I have a good idea.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If Behe thinks the designer is God, why is it a problem for Colson
&gt; &gt;&gt; when Dawkins writes that &quot;God must step in to help&quot;?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Behe does no such thing. What he does is provide a series of case
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;studies, such as the malaria virus,

Ray, once again, you are not allowed to just go around re-defining

Of course there is nothing &quot;pro-atheist&quot; about science, and

Why would one need a &quot;source&quot; for this view?   It's a matter of faith.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The methodological naturalism that science uses does not exclude God.
It simply doesn't allow an appeal to the supernatural to explain natural
happenings.  The idea that God uses natural methods is entirely
consistent with science.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; of course, says and presupposes that life was a direct

Actually, the Bible doesn't make any presuppositions.  Only those who
read the Bible have them.   The Bible doesn't say how God created, and
what mechanism he used.   The belief that God used a &quot;magic poof&quot; to
create has no more &quot;source&quot; than the belief that God used natural
processes.  However the idea that God used natural processes is at least
consistent with the physical evidence.   There has never been any
observation of God, or any other supernatural being, using magic.  There
is, of course the observation that natural processes exist.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

And the answer, as has been explained to Ray several times, is that
evolution is the scientific theory that best explains the physical
evidence.   Even if all atheists &quot;rabidly&quot; supported evolution, (a
statement that's not true), evolution would still be the best
explanation for the evidence.   Atheists also &quot;rabidly&quot; support the idea
that the Earth is round, that the sky is blue, or that if you drop an
object it will fall.

No, you're simply confused. One might claim that the science of

First, even Darwin was not &quot;pro-atheist;&quot; he privately declared
himself an agnostic, and publically announced that he saw no reason
that his theory should overturn anyone's faith (he also refused to
have a genuinely pro-atheist book by Marx's son-in-law dedicated to
him).  And the turn away from explanations in terms of miracles, and
the search for explanations in terms of natural causes, had begun,
even in biology, before Darwin set pen to paper.  Indeed, the idea
that scientific explanations should be based, not on miracles, but on
the regular operations of natural causes established by God, had been
set forth by Christian philosophers back in the Middle Ages.

Second, is it at all satisfactory to have God be only, or primarily, a
God of the gaps?  Have you ever read Mark Twain's _Letters from
Earth_?  Part of the text is a complaint that Christians routinely
praise God for things done by human beings -- for, e.g. a treatment
for sleeping sickness found by scientists funded by Rockefeller.  Of
course, one need not go to Twain for this attitude: in an episode of
_The Simpsons_, Bart prays &quot;We bought all this food ourselves, God, so
thanks for nothing.&quot;  Now, I think every Christian would regard Bart's
attitude as wrong and Twain's critique as somehow missing the point:
God works through natural processes, including the actions and
decisions of human beings, and provides through natural means more
than through miracles.  It is no more absurd to suppose that God
creates the diversity and complexity of life through evolution, than
that He accomplishes His will in history through the donations and
deeds of human agents.

I think that not all atheists do rabidly defend evolution; consider
the cartoonist Scott Adams, who at least is not any sort of
conventional theist, but who also refuses to accept the mainstream
view of evolution.  But many atheists do indeed defend evolution, for
much the same reason that they defend, against its critics, the idea
that HIV causes AIDS, or, on the rare occasions modern geocentrists
make themselves obvious, they defend heliocentric astronomy.  That is,
atheists defend evolution because the evidence supports it, and they
think that evidence ought to trump dogma.  But then, there is a long
(if often a minority) tradition in Christianity that evidence ought to
trump, at least, human interpretations of scripture and the dogmas
invented by human &quot;experts.&quot;

The view that God created the evolutionary process has two roots: one
is the biblical doctrine, accepted on faith, that God created,
directly or indirectly, everything that exists, and the other is the
vast empirical evidence that evolution, in fact, has happened and
continues to happen.  There are many Christians who feel that God is
not served by denying and lying about scientific facts in His name.

I don't know if this has already been pointed out or not, but the
statement above could only be made by someone who is unfamiliar with
the NY Times Book Review. Many of the reviews, I believe slightly more
than half, are written by people not on the Times' staff. Quite often
the reviewer will be well-known, working in a field related to the
book's subject matter and famous for a viewpoint in opposition to the
author's. It is also common for there to be a lengthy response from
the author in the next week's issue, Behe being one example.

Yesterday was the &quot;music&quot; issue, so I didn't find any obvious examples
of &quot;opposition&quot;, but Stephen King wrote the review of Eric Clapton's
autobiography. Presumably this isn't a regular side-gig for King.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What Darwinism Can't Do
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The Edge of Evolution

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;October 19, 2007

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The intelligent design (ID) movement has been accused of a lot of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;things over the years. Among the mildest of those accusations is
that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;ID is just religion masquerading as science.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Anyone who could seriously think that, cannot be paying
attention.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Intelligent design, as defined by the Discovery Institute,
teaches
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;simply &quot;that certain features of the universe and of living
things are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected
[random]
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;process such as natural selection.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Natural Selection isn't random.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If Natural Selection isn't random, as you've just stated, then it
must
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;be directed.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That really depends on what you mean by &quot;directed&quot;. Are falling
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objects directed? Do you consider the cubic shape of salt crystals to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; be the result of direction?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And I'll claim victory for my side a second time.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I think that we can agree that there are regularities in nature. If
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you want to claim that admission as a victory, it seems like a pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; small one.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;course, I did it the first time below, however, I'm scrolling up to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;answer each of your points. See if you can figure that out :)

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Were you in a hurry?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That's it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It boils down to &quot;Somewhere, somehow, someone did something, at
some
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time. Maybe.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I'd remove the maybe, and you'd be right.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That's a pretty vague claim, and can encompass everything from God(s)
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to aliens to time travelers. Wouldn't it be amazing if the scenario
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; depicted in 2001: A Space Odyssey were true? Yet ID advocates don't
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; find this to be an interesting question.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It does not attempt to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;define or describe that cause.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why not? Why don't ID advocates find that to be a question worth
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pursuing?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Because at that point, beliefs are called into question,

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So what? In science, beliefs are called into question all the time.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;including I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;would guess, yours. Which you haven't actually stated in this
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;thread....

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The only beliefs relevant to a scientific question is the belief that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; nature isn't trying to trick us when we observe it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It's more important to decide whether or not ID is fact first,

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ID advocates have already done that, haven't they? If not, why are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; people trying to teach it in schools?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;then we can move on and decide if we can figure out if there's one
or
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;many designers, and who that is.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Recognizing design is dependent on understanding the motivations of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the designer. The two are inseparably intertwined.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Most scientists who subscribe to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;intelligent design do believe in some form of evolution. And some
of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;them are not even believers in the Bible-they are secularists.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Who?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;In an opinion piece of limited length, I don't believe he needs to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;list them.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah, he does. Didn't you write in news:ff84ij$f8m$1@reader1.panix.com
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      Unless you're willing to provide this supposed evidence, I'm not
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      going to be convinced on just your say so....

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Why does Colson get a free pass?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;They do indeed exist, if you were to take the time to do a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;search....

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It's not my job to support Colson's claims.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;They
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;simply believe that Darwinism does not have all the answers,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;especially about how life originated. (Darwin himself never
pretended
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;certainty on that.)

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But Darwin never intended evolution to explain the origin of life.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You're serious? What do you call his first book,

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and subsequent works?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; They certainly have nothing to do with the origin of life.
Abiogenesis
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is separate from evolution.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If A does not imply B, then this thread is over. And the side of,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;There is a creator&quot; wins. Note the small C.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I don't know if you'll interpret what follows as a victory or not.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here's the last sentence of the sixth edition of The Origin of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Species:

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a
beginning
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      are being evolved.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Even Darwin saw biological evolution as being separate from
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; abiogenesis.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Now, with the publication of Michael Behe's second book, there is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;little excuse left for anyone to remain ignorant of what
intelligent
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;design actually is. Behe, you may remember, is the professor of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;biological science from Lehigh University who shook up the
scientific
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;world when he published Darwin's Black Box over a decade ago. Now
he
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;has written The Edge of Evolution: The Search for the Limits of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Darwinism. Behe leaves no doubt of his belief in natural
selection. He
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;even goes much further than many of us, including myself, by
declaring
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;his belief in a common ancestor.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why does the writer reject that when Behe doesn't?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;See below.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You never get around to addressing the question.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;In short, he is more than willing to acknowledge common ground
with
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the evolutionists. All he is trying to show here is that there
are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;certain things that Darwinism cannot answer.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But no one ever claimed that Darwinism had an answer for
everything.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Isn't that what youv'e been claiming this entire thread?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Where did I do that?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Maybe you
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;need to restate your arguments.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; My argument is that biological evolution happens. That's it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Are you now claiming that Darwinism
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and evolution are mutually exclusive?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; No. What makes you think that?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you're now claiming that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;your entire argument is flawed,

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Fortunately, I'm not.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;then clearly, we have to look to other
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;sources to find the answers.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The answers to what? The reason for the existence of the tree of
life?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Biological evolution does a pretty good job of that, as even Behe
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; admits.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But even for that, he
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;gets pilloried. The New York Times showed Behe's book the
ultimate
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;disrespect by assigning someone who had publicly disagreed with
and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;denounced him to review it: the vehement &quot;anti-theist&quot; Richard
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Dawkins, of all people. So much for the objectivity of the New
York
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Times.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why is it that disrespectful? Should the reviewer have been
someone
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; who agreed with everything Behe wrote? If ID isn't about religion,
why
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is Dawkins's atheism relevant?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Because journalistic integrity went out the window a long time ago.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That's an unsupported assertion.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Clearly, you get a different review based on the reviewer of the
book.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I won't argue that. But why is atheism relevant to the review of a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; supposedly scientific book?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Someone with a preconceived notion against the subject being
reviewed,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;will probably not be objective.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Dawkins is biased against science?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And the answer to your question is,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the reviewer should've been someone on the NY Times staff, a opposed
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to bringing in an outside source with his own agenda, to promote his
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;own book.

I feel this has some very good points. People like to say that Darwin
shook the boat, but the stormy weather that preceded him is oft
overlooked.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; -- [snip]

&gt; &gt; The objective meaning and understanding of 'evolution' (within the
&gt; &gt; context of the Creation-Evolution debate since Darwin) means that God
&gt; &gt; was not and is not involved in any biological production. Darwin's
&gt; &gt; proposal, within twenty years of publication, achieved scientific
&gt; &gt; paradigm change from pro-Creationism suppositions to the pro-Atheist
&gt; &gt; suppositions of Materialsim-Naturalism.

&gt; First, even Darwin was not &quot;pro-atheist;&quot; he privately declared
&gt; himself an agnostic, and publically announced that he saw no reason
&gt; that his theory should overturn anyone's faith (he also refused to
&gt; have a genuinely pro-atheist book by Marx's son-in-law dedicated to
&gt; him).  And the turn away from explanations in terms of miracles, and
&gt; the search for explanations in terms of natural causes, had begun,
&gt; even in biology, before Darwin set pen to paper.  Indeed, the idea
&gt; that scientific explanations should be based, not on miracles, but on
&gt; the regular operations of natural causes established by God, had been
&gt; set forth by Christian philosophers back in the Middle Ages.

&gt; Second, is it at all satisfactory to have God be only, or primarily, a
&gt; God of the gaps?  Have you ever read Mark Twain's _Letters from
&gt; Earth_?  Part of the text is a complaint that Christians routinely
&gt; praise God for things done by human beings -- for, e.g. a treatment
&gt; for sleeping sickness found by scientists funded by Rockefeller.  Of
&gt; course, one need not go to Twain for this attitude: in an episode of
&gt; _The Simpsons_, Bart prays &quot;We bought all this food ourselves, God, so
&gt; thanks for nothing.&quot;  Now, I think every Christian would regard Bart's
&gt; attitude as wrong and Twain's critique as somehow missing the point:
&gt; God works through natural processes, including the actions and
&gt; decisions of human beings, and provides through natural means more
&gt; than through miracles.  It is no more absurd to suppose that God
&gt; creates the diversity and complexity of life through evolution, than
&gt; that He accomplishes His will in history through the donations and
&gt; deeds of human agents.

&gt; &gt; Any person who believes or accepts that God created the evolutionary
&gt; &gt; process, does not, of course, have any source for said view. Evolution
&gt; &gt; is bridled by God excluding Materialism-Naturalism presuppositions and
&gt; &gt; the Bible, of course, says and presupposes that life was a direct
&gt; &gt; product of Divine creation and power. Those who, nonetheless believe,
&gt; &gt; that God created by evolution would do well to ask themselves why all
&gt; &gt; Atheists rabidly defend evolution?

&gt; I think that not all atheists do rabidly defend evolution; consider
&gt; the cartoonist Scott Adams, who at least is not any sort of
&gt; conventional theist, but who also refuses to accept the mainstream
&gt; view of evolution.  But many atheists do indeed defend evolution, for
&gt; much the same reason that they defend, against its critics, the idea
&gt; that HIV causes AIDS, or, on the rare occasions modern geocentrists
&gt; make themselves obvious, they defend heliocentric astronomy.  That is,
&gt; atheists defend evolution because the evidence supports it, and they
&gt; think that evidence ought to trump dogma.  But then, there is a long
&gt; (if often a minority) tradition in Christianity that evidence ought to
&gt; trump, at least, human interpretations of scripture and the dogmas
&gt; invented by human &quot;experts.&quot;

&gt; The view that God created the evolutionary process has two roots: one
&gt; is the biblical doctrine, accepted on faith, that God created,
&gt; directly or indirectly, everything that exists, and the other is the
&gt; vast empirical evidence that evolution, in fact, has happened and
&gt; continues to happen.  There are many Christians who feel that God is
&gt; not served by denying and lying about scientific facts in His name.

Yes, we do.  We believe in God, and the source of evolution is
science.  So if everything comes from God, then so must evolution.
The theory of relativity doesn't mention God, but I don't think that
it any more or less supports atheism than evolution does.

So what? The Bible is full of all sorts of minor inaccuracies.

Really?  I doubt that all atheists even know about evolution, so they
couldn't defend it &quot;rabidly&quot; or otherwise.  And if they did, so what?
The religious stance of its adherents has absolutely nothing to do
with the truth or value of a theory, and that's just a matter of
simple, iron-clad logic.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What Darwinism Can't Do
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The Edge of Evolution

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;October 19, 2007

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The intelligent design (ID) movement has been accused of a lot of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;things over the years. Among the mildest of those accusations is that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;ID is just religion masquerading as science.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Anyone who could seriously think that, cannot be paying attention.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Intelligent design, as defined by the Discovery Institute, teaches
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;simply &quot;that certain features of the universe and of living things are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected [random]
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;process such as natural selection.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Natural Selection isn't random.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If Natural Selection isn't random, as you've just stated, then it must
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;be directed.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That really depends on what you mean by &quot;directed&quot;. Are falling
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objects directed? Do you consider the cubic shape of salt crystals to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; be the result of direction?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And I'll claim victory for my side a second time.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I think that we can agree that there are regularities in nature. If
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you want to claim that admission as a victory, it seems like a pretty
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; small one.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;course, I did it the first time below, however, I'm scrolling up to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;answer each of your points. See if you can figure that out :)

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Were you in a hurry?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That's it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It boils down to &quot;Somewhere, somehow, someone did something, at some
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time. Maybe.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;I'd remove the maybe, and you'd be right.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That's a pretty vague claim, and can encompass everything from God(s)
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to aliens to time travelers. Wouldn't it be amazing if the scenario
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; depicted in 2001: A Space Odyssey were true? Yet ID advocates don't
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; find this to be an interesting question.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It does not attempt to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;define or describe that cause.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why not? Why don't ID advocates find that to be a question worth
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pursuing?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Because at that point, beliefs are called into question,

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So what? In science, beliefs are called into question all the time.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;including I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;would guess, yours. Which you haven't actually stated in this
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;thread....

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The only beliefs relevant to a scientific question is the belief that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; nature isn't trying to trick us when we observe it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;It's more important to decide whether or not ID is fact first,

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ID advocates have already done that, haven't they? If not, why are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; people trying to teach it in schools?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;then we can move on and decide if we can figure out if there's one or
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;many designers, and who that is.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Recognizing design is dependent on understanding the motivations of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the designer. The two are inseparably intertwined.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Most scientists who subscribe to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;intelligent design do believe in some form of evolution. And some of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;them are not even believers in the Bible-they are secularists.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Who?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;In an opinion piece of limited length, I don't believe he needs to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;list them.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah, he does. Didn't you write in news:ff84ij$f8m$1@reader1.panix.com
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      Unless you're willing to provide this supposed evidence, I'm not
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      going to be convinced on just your say so....

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Why does Colson get a free pass?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;They do indeed exist, if you were to take the time to do a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;search....

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It's not my job to support Colson's claims.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;They
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;simply believe that Darwinism does not have all the answers,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;especially about how life originated. (Darwin himself never pretended
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;certainty on that.)

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But Darwin never intended evolution to explain the origin of life.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You're serious? What do you call his first book,

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and subsequent works?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; They certainly have nothing to do with the origin of life. Abiogenesis
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is separate from evolution.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If A does not imply B, then this thread is over. And the side of,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;There is a creator&quot; wins. Note the small C.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I don't know if you'll interpret what follows as a victory or not.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here's the last sentence of the sixth edition of The Origin of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Species:

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      are being evolved.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Even Darwin saw biological evolution as being separate from
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; abiogenesis.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Now, with the publication of Michael Behe's second book, there is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;little excuse left for anyone to remain ignorant of what intelligent
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;design actually is. Behe, you may remember, is the professor of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;biological science from Lehigh University who shook up the scientific
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;world when he published Darwin's Black Box over a decade ago. Now he
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;has written The Edge of Evolution: The Search for the Limits of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Darwinism. Behe leaves no doubt of his belief in natural selection. He
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;even goes much further than many of us, including myself, by declaring
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;his belief in a common ancestor.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why does the writer reject that when Behe doesn't?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;See below.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You never get around to addressing the question.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;In short, he is more than willing to acknowledge common ground with
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the evolutionists. All he is trying to show here is that there are
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;certain things that Darwinism cannot answer.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But no one ever claimed that Darwinism had an answer for everything.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Isn't that what youv'e been claiming this entire thread?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Where did I do that?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Maybe you
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;need to restate your arguments.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; My argument is that biological evolution happens. That's it.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Are you now claiming that Darwinism
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and evolution are mutually exclusive?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; No. What makes you think that?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you're now claiming that
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;your entire argument is flawed,

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Fortunately, I'm not.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;then clearly, we have to look to other
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;sources to find the answers.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The answers to what? The reason for the existence of the tree of life?
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Biological evolution does a pretty good job of that, as even Behe
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; admits.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;But even for that, he
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;gets pilloried. The New York Times showed Behe's book the ultimate
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;disrespect by assigning someone who had publicly disagreed with and
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;denounced him to review it: the vehement &quot;anti-theist&quot; Richard
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Dawkins, of all people. So much for the objectivity of the New York
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Times.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why is it that disrespectful? Should the reviewer have been someone
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; who agreed with everything Behe wrote? If ID isn't about religion, why
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is Dawkins's atheism relevant?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Because journalistic integrity went out the window a long time ago.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That's an unsupported assertion.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Clearly, you get a different review based on the reviewer of the book.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I won't argue that. But why is atheism relevant to the review of a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; supposedly scientific book?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Someone with a preconceived notion against the subject being reviewed,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;will probably not be objective.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Dawkins is biased against science?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;And the answer to your question is,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the reviewer should've been someone on the NY Times staff, a opposed
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to bringing in an outside source with his own agenda, to promote his
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;own book.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here's the review: http://select.nytimes.com/preview/2007/07/01/books/1154680128921.html .
&gt; &gt; &gt;..
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Where does Dawkins promote his book?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That would be roughly the equivalent of the New York Times
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;asking me to review one of Dawkins's books. Fat chance.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Why?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Naturally, Dawkins accuses Behe of doing exactly what he does not do:
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Namely, he suggests that Behe states that where evolution reaches its
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;limits, &quot;God must step in to help.&quot;

Evolutionary theory is not meant to &quot;refute&quot; anything.  It's meant to
explain the evidence.  It happens to do a much better job than the
creationism of the 19th century.   That was refuted by the evidence,
so much that it was largely abandoned by the time Darwin published.
That's why your assuption about the &quot;Darwinian revolution&quot; is

Because evolution did not attack, or claim to refute Creationism.
Evolution attacked no one, and made a claim only to explain the
evidence.    I doubt there are any &quot;scholars&quot; who would claim that
&quot;Darwinian evolution&quot; attacked creationism, nor are there any who
would claim that the goal of evolution was to refute Creationism.
Can Ray produce a single &quot;source&quot; that makes such a claim?

A literal reading of Genesis as a scientific idea was already
almost dead by the time Darwin wrote his book, and was just needing a
testable theory that explained the evidence better to put the final
nail in the coffin.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Answer: Because they seek to misportray evolution as friendly to
&gt; believers and not anti-God.
">

Well, evolution is just as &quot;friendly&quot; to believers as is the theory of
the solar system (which raised some religious objections when it was
first proposed).  It's just as &quot;friendly&quot; to believers as germ theory,
which suggested that it was tiny organisms that caused disease, not
God.   It's just as &quot;friendly&quot; to believers as the theory that planets
orbit due to gravity, not rest in celestial spheres, as the Church
once taught....    All of those ideas were met with resistance from
religious persons when first proposed.   But eventually religious
persons realized that they weren't a threat to their faith.  In the
same way, most reasonable religious persons don't see evolution as a
threat to their beliefs.

Evolution is not &quot;anti-God&quot;.  It's just a scientific theory, which
makes no mention of God.   How a believer adjust his faith to the fact
of evolution is another matter, but the theory itself is not anti-God
in any way.

A scientific theory doesn't need &quot;theist support&quot;.   Scientific
theories stand and fall in relation to how well they explain the
evidence.  Even if every &quot;theist&quot; in the world opposed the theory, it
would still stand, based on it's explanitory power.

All science makes use of methodological naturalism.  Without it,
science can't function.   Evolution survives qutie well, only because
it explains the evidence better than any other scientific concept.

The above statement simply says that Christians believe God created
the evolutionary process. The Bible explicitly says that He did no
such thing, and spends two chapters denying common ancestry. This
leaves these Christians subordinate to their traditional enemy. This
is why we know that these Christians are not real Christians, if you
are objective.

An objective understanding says that when an Atheist and a Christian
accept the same biological origins theory then one party is not
genuinely as such. I believe that the Atheists who defend evolution (a
unanimous lot) are real Atheists.

&quot;Thus saith Darwin, that settles it&quot; - is that your argument?
Evolution overturned Darwin's faith so his comment, like a host of

As for your Marx comment: He did so because he was a closet Atheist,
which was very common back then. Privately, he encouraged the editor
of that publication and invited them to have supper at his home (which
they did).

Edward Aveling, an avowed Atheist, the person who asked for the

The Bible shows plainly that God uses what appears to be the chance

control. Lets face it: the sex drive of Potiphar's wife got Joseph
thrown in jail on a trumped up rape charge. If this did not happen
then the events which led him to be known to Pharoah as an interpreter
of dreams would not have happened, even though it could have been
brought to Pharoah's attention some other way. The point is that God
is in control and that he tested Joseph's faith in the dream he had as
a youth (which was from God) until that day in Pharoah's court
thirteen years later.

There is an interesting article on the Panda's Thumb archives, here:

It notes, among other examples, how the philosopher and cleric Jean
Buridan argued six hundred years before Darwin that natural causes
should be preferred to miracles as explanations for natural
phenomena.  Even a purely materialistic approach to life and human
thought predates Darwin by over a century: see, e.g. Julien Offray de
la Mettrie's _L'Homme Machine_ in the 18th century.

For references for the proposition, &quot;for thousands of years, 'god did
it' led nowhere,&quot; consider the insistence of the ID movement that we
are entitled to no assumptions about how the Designer would create.
If &quot;god did it&quot; had been a fruitful approach to devising theories,
there would by now have been at least the beginnings of a theory of
creation, a few basics known about the methods and design philosophy
of the Designer/Creator, and there would be no need for IDers and
creationists to retreat into belligerent epistemological nihilism to
defend their ideas.

modification and of natural selection.  But note that in the early

as it earlier refuted the geocentrism that earlier generations of
Christians had thought necessary to a correct understanding of the
Bible.  It is as true, or as false, to say that the purpose of
evolutionary theory was to install an atheist-materialist view of

install such a view of reality.  It is only your own attachment to the
creationist views of Gene Scott, and not any point of logic or

Darwin, and subsequent evolutionists, often argued against

itself is an explanation for much of the data in biology, and was
devised as such an explanation; it is a competitor for other
naturalistic theories in biology, not to any religious dogma.  And
neither Christianity nor theism are identical to creationism.  Darwin
himself argued that his theory ought not trouble any religious person,

reasonable person might suspect that they had motives other than
opposing God.

Heliocentric astronomy contradicts Genesis (which has the Earth
created before the sun, which is a real problem if planets are
supposed to orbit the sun), and Judges to boot (in which the writer
declares that the sun, not the Earth, obeyed Joshua's command).  Given
that the Bible itself frequently attributes to God actions that have
natural explanations in human actions (e.g. the Babylonian captivity
of Judah), I think it is unbiblical to suggest that explaining
something without reference to God amounts to a refutation of the
existence of God.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There's a least one falsehood in there. Evolution (common descent with
modification through the agency of natural selection and other
processes) is inferred from the evidence - there are literally billions
of supporting observations; evolution (transmutation of species) has
been observed in the field, under domestication and in the laboratory;
evolution (change of allele frequencies) is observed over and over
again.

Whether it contradicts Genesis may be an unanswerable question; there is
internal evidence that the first two chapters of Genesis weren't meant
to be taken &quot;literally&quot;, but at this remove I'm not sure we can reliably
reconstruct the intended meaning. But regardless of this many people who
accept the factuality of common descent with modification through the
agency of natural selection and other processes don't care about whether
the theory of evolution contradicts Genesis or otherwise.

The meaning of your first sentence above is unclear. It seems to imply
that Genesis is compatible with theistic evolution, in which case you
statement boils down to Genesis (particularly the claim that God created
the world) is incompatible with atheism, which would be (near?)
universally agreed on. But from your past writings one would assume you
meant something different, in which case your claim that everyone agrees
on it would be false.

&gt; &gt;Genesis specifically rules out non-supernatural evolution/common

&gt; There's a least one falsehood in there. Evolution (common descent with

&gt; processes) is inferred from the evidence - there are literally billions
&gt; of supporting observations; evolution (transmutation of species) has
&gt; been observed in the field, under domestication and in the laboratory;
&gt; evolution (change of allele frequencies) is observed over and over
&gt; again.

&gt; Whether it contradicts Genesis may be an unanswerable question; there is

&gt; agency of natural selection and other processes don't care about whether
&gt; the theory of evolution contradicts Genesis or otherwise.

I don't think that is true; in fact, with critical interpretations I
think we *can* now understand Genesis in ways that were not available
beforehand. And the interpretation is not fantastic for creationists:
God does not create ex nihilo, it is not the same God in different parts
of the text, there are other gods that are real and of similar if not
equal standing, God is limited in his capabilities, the world is like a
cooking pot inverted under water, etc.

Basically, Genesis is a composite document from divergent religious
traditions, which asserts the reality of a physical world that cannot,
under any circumstances, be reconciled with the world today. The only
conclusion a &quot;scientific creationist&quot; could derive is that at some
point, God swapped out the old cosmos for the present one unannounced.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The meaning of your first sentence above is unclear. It seems to imply

Darwin said any number of things without settling them; for example,
he suggested that lungs evolved from the swim bladders of fish,
whereas modern phylogenic reconstructions have it the other way
around.  But surely Darwin is the primary authority on what Darwin
himself thought.  Given sufficient evidence, we might conclude that he
was lying or confused, but if it comes down to your word vs. Darwin's
on what Darwin believed, I'm going with Charles.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Evolution overturned Darwin's faith so his comment, like a host of
&gt; similar ones, makes no sense.
">

Darwin's loss of faith seems to have proceeded in stages from a
multitude of causes, including the death of his favorite daughter.
Evolutionary theory closed a rather large gap into which apologists
had been in the habit of stuffing God, and seriously weakened one of
the classic medieval arguments for theism.  For Darwin, who seems
(despite having once studied for the clergy) never  to have been a
particularly religious man, this apparently left no particular reason
to believe.  Of course, from a strictly logical standpoint, even the
absence of any naturalistic explanation for the origin of life and its
diversity and complexity is no reason to invoke any particular God as
a supernaturalistic explanation.  Faith in God cannot be adequately
grounded merely on a god of the gaps argument, no matter how imposing
the gap might be, and if grounded on something else, does not need the
gap.

It's an interesting document, but I'm not sure it helps your case.  I
have pointed out in responses to &quot;backspace&quot; that words can have
different meanings depending on context, and this is a case in point.
Aveling asserts that he and Darwin avoided alike &quot;the folly of God
denial&quot; and &quot;the folly of God assertion.&quot;  He calls this &quot;atheism,&quot;
lack of belief in God, and Darwin agrees with him, but obviously this
is not the sort of atheism you have in mind when you speak of
evolution as meaning that &quot;God was not and is not involved in any
biological production.&quot;  That would be not merely lack of belief in
God, but what Aveling refers to as &quot;the folly of God denial,&quot; which he
states that Darwin (and, surprisingly to me, Aveling himself) seek to
avoid.  This position is entirely consistent with Darwin's later
avowal that his position was &quot;agnostic:&quot; he made no claim to know
anything about God or His possible role in creation.

Note also that according to that article, Darwin did not abandon
Christianity until he was forty.  That would be in 1849, more than a
decade after he first accepted that humans shared ancestors with
apes.  So his decision to accept human evolution, on his own account
of the matter, could not have proceeded from his prior rejection of
God or Christianity, as you have suggested in the past.

creation.  And several &quot;Darwinists,&quot; from Asa Gray through Theodosius
Dobzhansky to Kenneth Miller, have held precisely that God did create
natural processes and act through them.  So I think that &quot;evolution&quot;

In the main, they don't, as far as I know. To you , there is only one
kind of God, one that is inextricably bound to Genesis. Evolution, and
other scientific ideas do contradict Genesis. No one I know disagrees
with that. But that does not preclude *any* sort of God, whether or
not you can see it.

Well, evolution does directly contradict Creationism as it is usually
understood. That does not support your assertion that it was

Darwin that nature seemed to work at least mostly on its own.

&gt; &gt; &gt;Genesis specifically rules out non-supernatural evolution/common

&gt; &gt; There's a least one falsehood in there. Evolution (common descent with
&gt; &gt; modification through the agency of natural selection and other
&gt; &gt; processes) is inferred from the evidence - there are literally billions
&gt; &gt; of supporting observations; evolution (transmutation of species) has
&gt; &gt; been observed in the field, under domestication and in the laboratory;
&gt; &gt; evolution (change of allele frequencies) is observed over and over
&gt; &gt; again.

&gt; &gt; Whether it contradicts Genesis may be an unanswerable question; there is
&gt; &gt; internal evidence that the first two chapters of Genesis weren't meant
&gt; &gt; to be taken &quot;literally&quot;, but at this remove I'm not sure we can reliably
&gt; &gt; reconstruct the intended meaning. But regardless of this many people who
&gt; &gt; accept the factuality of common descent with modification through the
&gt; &gt; agency of natural selection and other processes don't care about whether
&gt; &gt; the theory of evolution contradicts Genesis or otherwise.

&gt; I don't think that is true; in fact, with critical interpretations I
&gt; think we *can* now understand Genesis in ways that were not available
&gt; beforehand. And the interpretation is not fantastic for creationists:
&gt; God does not create ex nihilo,....
">

Here we have a comment that presupposes ancient Holy Torah Text, the
most examined Text of all time, was not understandable (but it is now)
and that the original Hebrew can be changed to say exactly opposite of
what it does say in many places: creation ex nihilo, which is expected
and conducive with how an almighty omnipotent Deity would produce. By
asserting no creation ex nihilo at any point the author is saying that
matter always existed and did not require a Creator, extreme illogic

Yet you have asserted, a couple of posts upthread, that &quot;evolution
means that God not and is not involved in any biological production.&quot;
Evolution (common descent with modification) is part of nature.
Natural selection (as the name rather implies) is part of nature.
Your contention that if evolution continues so far that, e.g. humans
and chimpanzees share common ancestry, then God cannot be involved,
must imply that there are at least potentially natural processes that
escape and defy God's control.  Or, conversely, if all natural
processes must be under God's direct control, then, again, common
descent through natural selection cannot toss God off His throne any
more than meteorology or developmental biology can.

Admitting that you have a problem is the first step towards getting
help.  Let me rephrase: it is common to point out that, e.g.
biological features like the inverted retina of the vertebrate eye (as
compared to the &quot;verted&quot; retina of the cephalopod eye) are not the way
that any known sort of designer would design things; in that respect,
the eye does not look designed.  Creationists tell us, when confronted
with this argument, that we are not entitled to any assumptions about
how God (or the Intelligent Designer) would design an eye.  This is
not a defense of design, and still less is it an explanation of
design.  If the assumption of design/creation had yielded any fruit in
scientific research, creationists would be able to say, with respect
to some structures, that it was designed such-and-such a way for such-
and-such a reason (that is, they would have at least parts of a theory
of creation), rather than simply saying  that there is nothing we can
say about how God ought to design and create.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you denying what is known in scholarship circles as the &quot;Darwinian

&gt; &gt; Most intellectual revolutions are overrated: Darwin had precursors for

&gt; False.

&gt; Two or three persons used the term but it had zero correspondence to
&gt; how Darwin defined it and popularized it.
">

Natural selection had been discussed in, albeit not called &quot;natural
selection,&quot; as far back as Aristotle, who, like many later writers,
saw it as preserving groups of living things from degeneration.  The
term itself was used by Patrick Matthew in 1831, in an obscure essay
which may well have been the first suggestion that natural selection
could not only preserve a species from degeneration but, under
appropriate environmental conditions, change it into another species.
Darwin was apparently unfamiliar with Matthew's essay until after he
had published the first edition of _Origin of Species_, but mentioned
his priority in later editions.

&gt; &gt; -- [snip]

&gt; &gt; &gt; The objective meaning and understanding of 'evolution' (within the
&gt; &gt; &gt; context of the Creation-Evolution debate since Darwin) means that God
&gt; &gt; &gt; was not and is not involved in any biological production. Darwin's
&gt; &gt; &gt; proposal, within twenty years of publication, achieved scientific
&gt; &gt; &gt; paradigm change from pro-Creationism suppositions to the pro-Atheist
&gt; &gt; &gt; suppositions of Materialsim-Naturalism.

&gt; &gt; First, even Darwin was not &quot;pro-atheist;&quot; he privately declared
&gt; &gt; himself an agnostic, and publically announced that he saw no reason
&gt; &gt; that his theory should overturn anyone's faith (he also refused to
&gt; &gt; have a genuinely pro-atheist book by Marx's son-in-law dedicated to
&gt; &gt; him).  And the turn away from explanations in terms of miracles, and
&gt; &gt; the search for explanations in terms of natural causes, had begun,
&gt; &gt; even in biology, before Darwin set pen to paper.  Indeed, the idea
&gt; &gt; that scientific explanations should be based, not on miracles, but on
&gt; &gt; the regular operations of natural causes established by God, had been
&gt; &gt; set forth by Christian philosophers back in the Middle Ages.

&gt; &gt; Second, is it at all satisfactory to have God be only, or primarily, a
&gt; &gt; God of the gaps?  Have you ever read Mark Twain's _Letters from
&gt; &gt; Earth_?  Part of the text is a complaint that Christians routinely
&gt; &gt; praise God for things done by human beings -- for, e.g. a treatment
&gt; &gt; for sleeping sickness found by scientists funded by Rockefeller.  Of
&gt; &gt; course, one need not go to Twain for this attitude: in an episode of
&gt; &gt; _The Simpsons_, Bart prays &quot;We bought all this food ourselves, God, so
&gt; &gt; thanks for nothing.&quot;  Now, I think every Christian would regard Bart's
&gt; &gt; attitude as wrong and Twain's critique as somehow missing the point:
&gt; &gt; God works through natural processes, including the actions and
&gt; &gt; decisions of human beings, and provides through natural means more
&gt; &gt; than through miracles.  It is no more absurd to suppose that God
&gt; &gt; creates the diversity and complexity of life through evolution, than
&gt; &gt; that He accomplishes His will in history through the donations and
&gt; &gt; deeds of human agents.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Any person who believes or accepts that God created the evolutionary
&gt; &gt; &gt; process, does not, of course, have any source for said view. Evolution
&gt; &gt; &gt; is bridled by God excluding Materialism-Naturalism presuppositions and
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Bible, of course, says and presupposes that life was a direct
&gt; &gt; &gt; product of Divine creation and power. Those who, nonetheless believe,
&gt; &gt; &gt; that God created by evolution would do well to ask themselves why all
&gt; &gt; &gt; Atheists rabidly defend evolution?

&gt; &gt; I think that not all atheists do rabidly defend evolution; consider
&gt; &gt; the cartoonist Scott Adams, who at least is not any sort of
&gt; &gt; conventional theist, but who also refuses to accept the mainstream
&gt; &gt; view of evolution.  But many atheists do indeed defend evolution, for
&gt; &gt; much the same reason that they defend, against its critics, the idea
&gt; &gt; that HIV causes AIDS, or, on the rare occasions modern geocentrists
&gt; &gt; make themselves obvious, they defend heliocentric astronomy.  That is,
&gt; &gt; atheists defend evolution because the evidence supports it, and they
&gt; &gt; think that evidence ought to trump dogma.  But then, there is a long
&gt; &gt; (if often a minority) tradition in Christianity that evidence ought to
&gt; &gt; trump, at least, human interpretations of scripture and the dogmas
&gt; &gt; invented by human &quot;experts.&quot;

&gt; &gt; The view that God created the evolutionary process has two roots: one
&gt; &gt; is the biblical doctrine, accepted on faith, that God created,
&gt; &gt; directly or indirectly, everything that exists, and the other is the
&gt; &gt; vast empirical evidence that evolution, in fact, has happened and
&gt; &gt; continues to happen.  There are many Christians who feel that God is
&gt; &gt; not served by denying and lying about scientific facts in His name.

Your comments simply presuppose evolution and human evolution to be
true; and they presuppose that if God exists then He &quot;created&quot; through
evolution and human evolution. The objective meaning of evolution and
human evolution says God does not exist, if true. This is why all
Atheists rabidly support evolution. Your comments seek to cover the
objective meaning of evolution in order to trick undecided believers
into accepting evolution.

Your comment also misrepresents me by speaking for me while asserting

But when a evolutionist uses the phrase &quot;natural processes&quot; it

direct supernatural power - the exact thing evolution rejects.

But it doesn't really matter: MN is false. It simply dares anyone to

methodological supernaturalism: evolution could be true and we are not

&gt; &gt; Yet you have asserted, a couple of posts upthread, that &quot;evolution
&gt; &gt; means that God not and is not involved in any biological production.&quot;
&gt; &gt; Evolution (common descent with modification) is part of nature.
&gt; &gt; Natural selection (as the name rather implies) is part of nature.
&gt; &gt; Your contention that if evolution continues so far that, e.g. humans

&gt; &gt; must imply that there are at least potentially natural processes that
&gt; &gt; escape and defy God's control.

&gt; Your comments simply presuppose evolution and human evolution to be
&gt; true; and they presuppose that if God exists then He &quot;created&quot; through
&gt; evolution and human evolution. The objective meaning of evolution and
&gt; human evolution says God does not exist, if true. This is why all
&gt; Atheists rabidly support evolution. Your comments seek to cover the
&gt; objective meaning of evolution in order to trick undecided believers
&gt; into accepting evolution.

I do accept that humans evolved and share common ancestors with other
species (or, if that is insufficiently blunt for you, that some of our
ancestors were nonhuman apes, and earlier ancestors were monkeys, and
far earlier, some of our ancestors were fish).  But my comments in the
paragraph above do not presuppose this; they presuppose, rather, that
*if* human evolution occurred, then it is a natural process (Behe
would disagree, I suppose, but his position ends up at the conclusion
of my argument all the faster for that).  You have said that ALL
natural processes are under the direct control of God.  No scientific
theory takes a position one way or another on that question; it is a
theological rather than a scientific point.  Therefore, you ought to
accept that if human evolution occurred, then God was directly in
charge of it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your comment also misrepresents me by speaking for me while asserting

">

What have I accused you of saying, which you do not believe?  Do you
recant your earlier statement that &quot;evolution means that God is not
involved in any biological production,&quot; or your more recent assertion
that &quot;God is in direct control of all natural processes?&quot;  I merely
point out that these two statements contradict one another; you may
logically believe one or the other, but not both.  I am trying to
point out to you the implications of your own statements.  Perhaps you
do not in fact believe these implications; that would show that you
had not thought through the ideas that rattle about in your head,
which is your problem, not mine.

Please note that it is not especially relevant whether individual
evolutionists believe that God exists or is, in fact, in direct
control of all natural processes.  Evolutionary biologists are experts
on biology and evolution, not on God (whether anyone is an expert on
God is another matter), and their opinions on whether God is, in fact,
in control of natural processes, or even exists, is worth, as we say
here on T.O., as much as the opinion of Lenny Flank's pizza-delivery
boy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Or, conversely, if all natural
&gt; &gt; processes must be under God's direct control, then, again, common
&gt; &gt; descent through natural selection cannot toss God off His throne any
&gt; &gt; more than meteorology or developmental biology can.

&gt; But when a evolutionist uses the phrase &quot;natural processes&quot; it
&gt; objectively means that the supernatural was not involved. 'Natural'
&gt; and 'Supernatural' are antonyms. You are either confused or like I
&gt; said: simply attempting to intertwine two words for the purpose of
&gt; saying and presupposing that God &quot;created&quot; the natural process of
&gt; evolution. The Bible says God did not create this way, but through
&gt; direct supernatural power - the exact thing evolution rejects.
">

When an evolutionist (or other scientist) uses the phrase &quot;natural
processes,&quot; it means &quot;regularities of nature that can be uncovered,
understood (to some extent), predicted and used by human beings.&quot;  It
is true that the most obvious reading of the Bible states that God
created living things in their present form, without evolutionary
precursors (it is not clear to me that Genesis actually distinguishes
between &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;supernatural&quot; causes).  Of course, the most
obvious reading of the Bible also indicates that God created the Earth
flat, topped with the solid dome of the sky, to which the sun, moon,
and stars were attached.  You deny this, of course, which merely shows
that you do not realize that you yourself interpret the Bible and
decide to take some parts literally and others figuratively, or to
impose tortuous and unlikely readings on the &quot;literal&quot; text.   The
theistic evolutionist is arguably more consistent in his handling of
the text than you are.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Atheists deny for obvious reasons.

&gt; &gt; It is becoming increasingly obvious that you define &quot;atheist&quot; as
&gt; &gt; idiosyncratically as you define &quot;racist&quot; (and, by the way, you haven't
&gt; &gt; called me a racist even once yet in this thread; where's the love,
&gt; &gt; Ray?).  We know that humans can design genetic algorithms that are
&gt; &gt; capable of &quot;designing&quot; (through generating random variations on a
&gt; &gt; starting design and testing them) aircraft wings, electronic circuits,
&gt; &gt; and other things.  Surely an omnipotent Creator could do more, and
&gt; &gt; design natural processes that can generate life and its complexity and
&gt; &gt; diversity from scratch.  If you find the evidence of design &quot;beyond
&gt; &gt; abundant,&quot; that is an argument for seeing a divine Designer of
&gt; &gt; evolution, not for denying evolution or for insisting that &quot;if God, no
&gt; &gt; evolution, and if evolution, no God.&quot;

&gt; Evidence of design is evidence of a invisible Designer, not evolution
&gt; which denies design. I suspect that you are so desparate to trick
&gt; undecideds into accepting evolution that you are now saying evolution
&gt; produced design. Dawkins has said abundantly that natural selection
&gt; produces the ***illusion of design.*** In other words, design does not
&gt; actually exist. That is a better argument for what you are attempting
&gt; to accomplish and it has a recognized scholar for a source if anyone
&gt; asks for a reference. You are welcome.

Have you actually read what I actually wrote?  I used &quot;design&quot; in
scare quotes, mindful of Dawkins's point (although I should point out
that &quot;Dawkins has said&quot; and &quot;all evolutionists must accept&quot; are not
equivalent statements; evolutionary theory has no Pope, nor even a Dr.
Gene Scott, to lay down dogma for all).  You have two arguments here:
one is, &quot;the universe and life are obviously designed,&quot; and the other
is &quot;the Bible says that God created directly and supernaturally.&quot;  I
have two counterarguments: an omnipotent God could have designed the
universe with the ability to produce &quot;design&quot; on its own, and you
already accept many parts of the Bible either figuratively or in
senses that are not obvious to anyone who is not a disciple of Gene
Scott (i.e. 99+% of Christendom and a larger fraction of the rest of
the world).

&gt; Atheists deny for obvious reasons.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Darwin's proposal, within twenty years of publication, achieved
scientific
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paradigm change from pro-Creationism suppositions to the
pro-Atheist
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppositions of Materialsim-Naturalism.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uh, no. that was happening long before this, due to the fact that,
for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thousands of years, 'god did it' led no where.

&gt; &gt; &gt; When? Do you have any references?

&gt; &gt; There is an interesting article on the Panda's Thumb archives, here:
&gt; &gt; &lt; http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/03/on-the-origins.html &gt;

&gt; It is quite interesting.

&gt; &gt; It notes, among other examples, how the philosopher and cleric Jean
&gt; &gt; Buridan argued six hundred years before Darwin that natural causes
&gt; &gt; should be preferred to miracles as explanations for natural
&gt; &gt; phenomena.  Even a purely materialistic approach to life and human
&gt; &gt; thought predates Darwin by over a century: see, e.g. Julien Offray de
&gt; &gt; la Mettrie's _L'Homme Machine_ in the 18th century.

&gt; So?

&gt; What's the point?

&gt; &gt; For references for the proposition, &quot;for thousands of years, 'god did
&gt; &gt; it' led nowhere,&quot; consider the insistence of the ID movement that we
&gt; &gt; are entitled to no assumptions about how the Designer would create.
&gt; &gt; If &quot;god did it&quot; had been a fruitful approach to devising theories,
&gt; &gt; there would by now have been at least the beginnings of a theory of
&gt; &gt; creation, a few basics known about the methods and design philosophy
&gt; &gt; of the Designer/Creator, and there would be no need for IDers and
&gt; &gt; creationists to retreat into belligerent epistemological nihilism to
&gt; &gt; defend their ideas.

&gt; Again, I literally have no idea as to what you are talking about.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you denying what is known in scholarship circles as the &quot;Darwinian
&gt; &gt; &gt; revolution&quot;?

&gt; &gt; Most intellectual revolutions are overrated: Darwin had precursors for
&gt; &gt; the idea of natural selection,

&gt; False.

&gt; Two or three persons used the term but it had zero correspondence to
&gt; how Darwin defined it and popularized it.

&gt; &gt; for descent with modification, even for
&gt; &gt; common descent, and certainly for the hope of finding some sort of
&gt; &gt; natural mechanism for evolution.  Darwin's writings caused a major
&gt; &gt; shift, certainly, popularizing the idea of common descent with
&gt; &gt; modification and of natural selection.

&gt; So you agree?

&gt; &gt; But note that in the early
&gt; &gt; 20th century, there was what was called &quot;the eclipse of Darwinism,&quot;
&gt; &gt; when the importance of natural selection was widely disputed, but this
&gt; &gt; was not accompanied by any widespread return of biologists to
&gt; &gt; creationist ideas.

&gt; What is meant by the &quot;Darwinian revolution&quot; is the triumph of
&gt; transmutation (I did not say NS) over Creationism before 1880.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Origin&quot; caused paradigm change from pro-God suppositions of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Creationism to pro-Atheist suppositions of Materialism.

&gt; &gt; Belief in God and creationism was in retreat before Darwin,

&gt; It was stagnant to say the least starting in ***1850*** (not before).
&gt; But your comment is deceptive in that the &quot;Origin&quot; CAUSED major shift
&gt; within two decades. This is a undisputed fact of history.

&gt; &gt; on the one
&gt; &gt; hand, and on the other, many of Darwin's early supporters were
&gt; &gt; themselves Christians.  You grossly oversimplify the long change in
&gt; &gt; how Christians thought about the Bible and creation, and in how people
&gt; &gt; in western civilization thought about Christianity.  If you want to
&gt; &gt; complain about a paradigm change,

&gt; I didn't complain; I stated that it happened by 1880, why are you
&gt; denying?

&gt; Evolution, beginning in 1850-1859, overturned Creationism by 1880.

&gt; &gt;  perhaps you should go back to the
&gt; &gt; 17th century, with geocentrist physicists on the one hand, and the
&gt; &gt; wars of religion on the other.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If not, what theory dethroned Creationism-Design? The only ones prior
&gt; &gt; &gt; to Darwin were &quot;Vestiges&quot; (physics and biology explanation) and
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lamarck. Darwin published in 1859.

&gt; &gt; &gt; My point is that this NG could care less about uncontested facts of
&gt; &gt; &gt; history; what their own scholars have redundantly established, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; deny all facts by assertion that say evolution sought to refute
&gt; &gt; &gt; creationism in the 19th century. I cannot even find ONE author or
&gt; &gt; &gt; scholar who denies this but has, in fact, said it plainly in their
&gt; &gt; &gt; writings beyond abundantly. This proves that this NG and its
&gt; &gt; &gt; evolutionists are horribly ignorant or dishonest. In my view they are
&gt; &gt; &gt; both.

&gt; &gt; Evolutionary theory does flatly contradict what is usually called
&gt; &gt; creationism (although, to be sure, the Russian-American biologist
&gt; &gt; Theodosius Dobzhansky called himself &quot;both a creationist and an
&gt; &gt; evolutionist&quot;), although it is the evidence that refutes creationism,
&gt; &gt; as it earlier refuted the geocentrism that earlier generations of
&gt; &gt; Christians had thought necessary to a correct understanding of the
&gt; &gt; Bible.  It is as true, or as false, to say that the purpose of
&gt; &gt; evolutionary theory was to install an atheist-materialist view of
&gt; &gt; reality, as to say that the purpose of heliocentric astronomy was to
&gt; &gt; install such a view of reality.  It is only your own attachment to the
&gt; &gt; creationist views of Gene Scott, and not any point of logic or
&gt; &gt; evidence or the biblical text, that makes you insist on a literal
&gt; &gt; reading of the creation account but a figurative reading of the
&gt; &gt; geocentric texts of the Bible.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Why do the evolutionists in this NG have a concerted campaign to deny
&gt; &gt; &gt; that Darwinian evolution attacked and claims to refute Creationism
&gt; &gt; &gt; (which no scholar denies)?

&gt; &gt; You are conflating creationism, Christianity, and theism.

&gt; Where did I mention &quot;Christianity&quot; or &quot;Theism&quot;?

&gt; How could I conflate two things that I did not mention? I said
&gt; Creationism - period.

&gt; &gt; They are
&gt; &gt; separate concepts, and one can believe in the latter two, or even the
&gt; &gt; last of these, without accepting the first of them.  So far as I know,
&gt; &gt; no one on this newsgroup denies that &quot;Darwinian evolution&quot; was opposed
&gt; &gt; to creationism

&gt; But I said &quot;refuted,&quot; not 'opposed.'

&gt; http://groups.google.com/group/talk.origins/msg/dbc8614ddbc55cf9

&gt; Dana Tweedy (an evolutionist) writes:

&gt; &quot;Because evolution did not attack, or claim to refute Creationism.
&gt; Evolution attacked no one, and made a claim only to explain the
&gt; evidence.  I doubt there are any &quot;scholars&quot; who would claim that
&gt; &quot;Darwinian evolution&quot; attacked creationism, nor are there any who
&gt; would claim that the goal of evolution was to refute Creationism.&quot;

&gt; If you agree with Dana, can you or the author produce ANY reference in
&gt; support of these opinions?

&gt;  &gt; (although modern creationism arose, in part, as a
&gt; &gt; reaction to &quot;Darwinian evolution&quot; and the evidence for it); what is
&gt; &gt; widely insisted is that evolutionary theory is not opposed to theism
&gt; &gt; or Christianity themselves.

&gt; The ***objective claims of evolution*** claims to refute Theism,
&gt; nobody denies this fact. This is why all Atheists are evolutionists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Answer: Because they seek to misportray evolution as friendly to
&gt; &gt; &gt; believers and not anti-God. The price of such a gross and brazen lie
&gt; &gt; &gt; is severance from their own authors and scholars.

&gt; &gt; Again, evolutionary theory is no more &quot;anti-God&quot; than heliocentric
&gt; &gt; astronomy or modern meteorology.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I might add that credentialed members like John Harshman and John
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wilkins, if they deny that evolution sought to refute creationism,
&gt; &gt; &gt; then I will gladly portray them against their peers as liars in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; near future. Their alleged degrees will be worthless if they are not
&gt; &gt; &gt; already. But I do know that these persons are responsible for the
&gt; &gt; &gt; ignorance of this Group and its belief that evolution was not
&gt; &gt; &gt; specifically developed to oppose God and Creationism.

&gt; &gt; Darwin, and subsequent evolutionists, often argued against
&gt; &gt; creationism; this is true, and no one denies it.

&gt; Dana did above.

&gt; &gt; Evolutionary theory
&gt; &gt; itself is an explanation for much of the data in biology, and was

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Genesis specifically rules out non-supernatural evolution/common
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ancestry. Everyone agrees on this. Evolution is only postulated
because
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it contradicts Genesis.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There's a least one falsehood in there. Evolution (common descent with
&gt; &gt; &gt; modification through the agency of natural selection and other
&gt; &gt; &gt; processes) is inferred from the evidence - there are literally
billions
&gt; &gt; &gt; of supporting observations; evolution (transmutation of species) has
&gt; &gt; &gt; been observed in the field, under domestication and in the laboratory;
&gt; &gt; &gt; evolution (change of allele frequencies) is observed over and over
&gt; &gt; &gt; again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether it contradicts Genesis may be an unanswerable question; there
is
&gt; &gt; &gt; internal evidence that the first two chapters of Genesis weren't meant
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be taken &quot;literally&quot;, but at this remove I'm not sure we can
reliably
&gt; &gt; &gt; reconstruct the intended meaning. But regardless of this many people
who
&gt; &gt; &gt; accept the factuality of common descent with modification through the
&gt; &gt; &gt; agency of natural selection and other processes don't care about
whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; the theory of evolution contradicts Genesis or otherwise.

&gt; &gt; I don't think that is true; in fact, with critical interpretations I
&gt; &gt; think we *can* now understand Genesis in ways that were not available
&gt; &gt; beforehand. And the interpretation is not fantastic for creationists:
&gt; &gt; God does not create ex nihilo,....

&gt; Here we have a comment that presupposes ancient Holy Torah Text, the
&gt; most examined Text of all time, was not understandable (but it is now)
&gt; and that the original Hebrew can be changed to say exactly opposite of
&gt; what it does say in many places: creation ex nihilo, which is expected
&gt; and conducive with how an almighty omnipotent Deity would produce. By
&gt; asserting no creation ex nihilo at any point the author is saying that
&gt; matter always existed and did not require a Creator, extreme illogic
&gt; noted, especially in behalf of a Text that is filled from cover to
&gt; cover with every miracle imaginable.

Yes, reminds me of Harry Potter. Funny how magic works so well in books, but

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have never said that any part of nature was not under God's control
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - I am a Creationist, we believe and know that all of nature is under
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; God's direct control.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet you have asserted, a couple of posts upthread, that &quot;evolution
&gt; &gt; &gt; means that God not and is not involved in any biological production.&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Evolution (common descent with modification) is part of nature.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Natural selection (as the name rather implies) is part of nature.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your contention that if evolution continues so far that, e.g. humans
&gt; &gt; &gt; and chimpanzees share common ancestry, then God cannot be involved,
&gt; &gt; &gt; must imply that there are at least potentially natural processes that
&gt; &gt; &gt; escape and defy God's control.

&gt; &gt; Your comments simply presuppose evolution and human evolution to be
&gt; &gt; true; and they presuppose that if God exists then He &quot;created&quot; through
&gt; &gt; evolution and human evolution. The objective meaning of evolution and
&gt; &gt; human evolution says God does not exist, if true. This is why all
&gt; &gt; Atheists rabidly support evolution. Your comments seek to cover the
&gt; &gt; objective meaning of evolution in order to trick undecided believers
&gt; &gt; into accepting evolution.

&gt; I do accept that humans evolved and share common ancestors with other
&gt; species (or, if that is insufficiently blunt for you, that some of our
&gt; ancestors were nonhuman apes, and earlier ancestors were monkeys, and
&gt; far earlier, some of our ancestors were fish).  But my comments in the
&gt; paragraph above do not presuppose this; they presuppose, rather, that
&gt; *if* human evolution occurred, then it is a natural process (Behe
&gt; would disagree, I suppose, but his position ends up at the conclusion
&gt; of my argument all the faster for that).  You have said that ALL
&gt; natural processes are under the direct control of God.  No scientific
&gt; theory takes a position one way or another on that question; it is a
&gt; theological rather than a scientific point.  Therefore, you ought to
&gt; accept that if human evolution occurred, then God was directly in
&gt; charge of it.
">

First off: science does take a position on God: evolution excludes
God; creationism includes God; both offer interpretations of the same
database of scientific evidence. Evolution is illegitimate &quot;science&quot;
because of its exclusion and is called Scientism. Creationism owns the
right to be called Science for its inclusion.

Why would anyone accept human evolution when there is no evidence for
it, but much to the contrary? Your acceptance of human evolution is an
Atheist philosophical need since Genesis is not an option.

Also, when I said or implied that God is in control of 'natural
processes' that means two things: that they exist and that they
reflect direct Divine power. Human evolution cannot be a natural
process since it does not exist except by pro-Atheist presupposition,
and the Textual evidence explicitly singles out Adamkind to have been
created from the clay-like redness in God's image - a claim that is
voodoo to evolution and its pro-Atheist presuppositions.

But you already knew that I was a Creationist who rejects human
evolution, which baffles me as to why you would seek such a
&quot;concession&quot;?

&gt; What have I accused you of saying, which you do not believe?  Do you

Your misrepresentations are when you do not recognize the meaning of
the phrase 'natural processes' and assume a contrary and subjective
one in my behalf.

To the evolutionist the phrase presupposes that the supernatural was
not and is not involved. That is why the antonymic word 'natural'
begins said phrase.

To the creationist the phrase presupposes something reflecting the
direct work of Divine power. In my forth coming paper I am careful to
make these distinctions ad nauseum.

&gt; Please note that it is not especially relevant whether individual

&gt; on biology and evolution, not on God (whether anyone is an expert on
&gt; God is another matter), and their opinions on whether God is, in fact,

Do you know how much confusion Darwin started by commencing the

how nature operates?

Some persons actually thought that he was not talking about reality.
Of course most of these persons were Creationists who were fucking
stupid. Anyone with any amount of comprehension could instantly tell
that Darwin was comparing intelligent artificial breeding selection to
nature in the context of claiming that nature behaves the same minus
intelligent agent selecting. One could,of course, disagree, but that
assumes one understands his position and view. Instead, many persons
didn't even get what he was saying, but were hung up on his metaphor
and its intent.

The same with the Bible: it is stupid fucking Atheists who do not
understand and who do not want to understand. There will always be
persons who just don't get it for whatever reason no matter how clear

OK so far. We understand that you don't believe this is how life arose

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

The clearly stated meaning of evolutionary theory is that life on
Earth descended and diversified from a common ancestor through natural
processes. It does not even address how the first life got started.
But I'm sure that most biologists expect that natural abiogenesis,
although separate from evolution, also occurred on Earth.

But how does any of that preclude God from existence? Could not God,
even the Christian God you believe in, have used evolutionary
processes if it had suited his fancy? Does that same God have the
knowledge and power to create a universe in which complexity
(including stars, planets and life) would arise through the natural
laws that He installed in the system? We understand that you believe
that the Bible says that that is not what God DID do, but couldn't he
have if he had wanted to?

There isn't anything about evolutionary ideas that suggests how the
universe got started and why it is the way it is. It just says that
the laws of nature HOWEVER THEY CAME TO BE, can explain the diversity
of life on Earth.

My Toyota produces power using chemical and physical processes and

Methodological naturalism is essentially the idea that we can only
study observable phenomena, and is the linchpin on which effective
science rests. But beyond that, creationists have a problem, because
if God created the world we live in, he quite evidently intended for
it to be one in which natural causes could be found for all the
phenomena we observe. That logical, decipherable quality of the world
(at least at our macro, non-quantum scale) is demonstrated over and
over again.

God could have done otherwise, could he not? Imagine a world in which
rain, crop yields, disease and the like were controlled by the whim of
various spirits and demigods; not regular, not predictable, not
controlled by discernable laws. But that is not what we find. If God
exists, then a rational world must have been his intent.

I agree that evolution does indeed &quot;say something&quot; about traditional
creationism. It says that that variety of creationism is incorrect.
Buit creationism does not equal God, at least not for everyone, and
certainly not by any necessity of logic..

Evolution does not refute the existence of God, but if He exists, He
must be the creator of THIS universe, the way we find it. And what we
find, at least on our planet, is that life diversified from a common
ancestor through natural processes. Some people find in that history a
testament to the elegance and power of God. Others assert that such
natural processes show any conception of God to be unnecessary.

Those differing opinions, and their myriad cousins around the globe,
are real and can't be reduced to Christian, Atheist and Dupe.

&gt; &gt; I do accept that humans evolved and share common ancestors with other

&gt; &gt; far earlier, some of our ancestors were fish).  But my comments in the

&gt; &gt; *if* human evolution occurred, then it is a natural process (Behe
&gt; &gt; would disagree, I suppose, but his position ends up at the conclusion
&gt; &gt; of my argument all the faster for that).  You have said that ALL
&gt; &gt; natural processes are under the direct control of God.  No scientific
&gt; &gt; theory takes a position one way or another on that question; it is a
&gt; &gt; theological rather than a scientific point.  Therefore, you ought to
&gt; &gt; accept that if human evolution occurred, then God was directly in
&gt; &gt; charge of it.

&gt; First off: science does take a position on God: evolution excludes
&gt; God; creationism includes God; both offer interpretations of the same
&gt; database of scientific evidence. Evolution is illegitimate &quot;science&quot;
&gt; because of its exclusion and is called Scientism. Creationism owns the
&gt; right to be called Science for its inclusion.
">

Creationism excludes the possibility that humans actually share
ancestors with nonhumans, or the possibility that their interpretation
of the Bible happens not to correspond to reality.  Evolutionary
theory does not exclude God.  If God is a natural phenomenon (as, say,
human designers are natural phenomena), then provide us with a theory
of how God creates, and evidence supporting it, and evolutionists will
accomodate their theories to this.  If God is supernatural, beyond
human understanding or testing, then science can say nothing about Him
anyway, so it makes little sense to try to incorporate Him into a
theory.

I reject your assertion that &quot;both [creationism and evolutionary
theory] offer interpretations of the same database of scientific
evidence.&quot;  To the extent that creationists actually deal with the
evidence, they spend a lot of time arguing that of course God could
have made, e.g. dinosaurs with feathers, or ape-men without souls, or
whatever; this is not an interpretation of the evidence but an attempt
to argue that the evidence doesn't really matter.  Of course, often
creationists simply misrepresent or ignore the evidence, which even
more obviously is not an interpretation of the evidence.  You, for
example, simply deal with all fossil evidence for human-ape
transitionals by asserting that the discoverers are racists; this is
not an interpretation of the evidence, but an excuse for not looking
at it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why would anyone accept human evolution when there is no evidence for
&gt; it, but much to the contrary? Your acceptance of human evolution is an
&gt; Atheist philosophical need since Genesis is not an option.
">

I do not know why anyone would accept human evolution if there were no
evidence for it; there do not seem to have been any such people before
evidence for evolution (biogeography, faunal succession in the fossil
record, an appreciation of the nested hierarchy of life) began to
accumulate.  Atheists have no &quot;philosophical need&quot; for common descent;
some sort of Lamarckian scheme for separate origins and evolution
would serve, as would the Aristotelian notion that humans and other
species had always existed.  There is, of course, a great deal of
evidence for human evolution, from shared pseudogenes and endogenous
retroviruses in humans and other primates, to the fact that the
greatest degree of human genetic diversity is found on the same
continent where the most humanlike apes are found, to the existence of
transitional fossil hominids that straddle any dividing line you might
wish to draw between &quot;fully-formed humans&quot; and nonhuman apes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, when I said or implied that God is in control of 'natural
&gt; processes' that means two things: that they exist and that they
&gt; reflect direct Divine power. Human evolution cannot be a natural
&gt; process since it does not exist except by pro-Atheist presupposition,
&gt; and the Textual evidence explicitly singles out Adamkind to have been
&gt; created from the clay-like redness in God's image - a claim that is
&gt; voodoo to evolution and its pro-Atheist presuppositions.
">

Ray, unless you wish to claim that you already know all the laws of
nature and all the ways in which they can operate together (i.e.
unless you claim to know more than all scientists alive put together),
you cannot know all the natural processes that exist or all the ones
that don't exist.  Therefore, logically, either you are claiming that
God controls only the natural processes that you admit exist, or else
you are claiming that God controls all natural processes, whether you
know about them, or acknowledge them or not.  Your insistence that
evolution cannot exist does not make it not exist, and therefore can
have no bearing on whether God is in control of evolution, or whether
evolution is a natural process.

&gt; &gt; &gt; brazenly misrepresent your opponent since it reveals inability to
&gt; &gt; &gt; refute what he actually said and rage caused by that fact.

&gt; &gt; What have I accused you of saying, which you do not believe?  Do you
&gt; &gt; recant your earlier statement that &quot;evolution means that God is not
&gt; &gt; involved in any biological production,&quot; or your more recent assertion
&gt; &gt; that &quot;God is in direct control of all natural processes?&quot;

&gt; Your misrepresentations are when you do not recognize the meaning of
&gt; the phrase 'natural processes' and assume a contrary and subjective
&gt; one in my behalf.

In other words, as Dana Tweedy as already noted, I failed to realize
that you attach your own special definitions to words, and then expect
the rest of the world to use them.  _Mea culpa, mea maxima culpa_.

&gt; To the evolutionist the phrase presupposes that the supernatural was
&gt; not and is not involved. That is why the antonymic word 'natural'
&gt; begins said phrase.
">

In the very common phrase &quot;natural selection,&quot; the word &quot;natural&quot;
means, in most cases, &quot;not artificial&quot; or &quot;not done by humans.&quot;
Compare, e.g. such usages as &quot;a natural lake&quot; as opposed, not to a
magical lake, but to a man-made lake, or &quot;natural ingredients&quot; as
opposed to &quot;ingredients synthesized in a factory.&quot;  Or, if you will,
&quot;natural selection&quot; is &quot;selection (or the equivalent) done by nature
rather than by human beings.&quot;  When I said &quot;in most cases,&quot; above, I
meant to call to mind that evolutionists will, from time to time,
point out that humans are part of nature and that the distinction
between natural selection and human artificial selection is blurry and
somewhat arbitrary.  But &quot;natural&quot; means &quot;the supernatural is not
involved&quot; only if you assume that dog breeders are miracle workers.

And I stand by my earlier statement that in general, &quot;natural&quot; means
&quot;having a discoverable nature, and behaving consistently according to
it.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To the creationist the phrase presupposes something reflecting the
&gt; direct work of Divine power. In my forth coming paper I am careful to
&gt; make these distinctions ad nauseum.

First, I think that if this paper ever shows up, it might be useful to
make a distinction between &quot;natural processes&quot; and &quot;miracles.&quot;  If
both reflect the direct work of divine power, what distinguishes
between them, and why should you prefer to be directly and divinely
made by one means rather than the other?

Second, thank you for warning us that your forthcoming paper will be
nauseous.

&gt; &gt; I merely
&gt; &gt; point out that these two statements contradict one another;

&gt; Only if you ignore the meaning I intended and insert your own in my
&gt; behalf without informing the audience. What you did was pure Dana
&gt; Tweedyistic, stop it!

I cannot read your mind.  If you haven't bothered to inform the
audience of the secret meanings you have bestowed on common phrases,
how I am supposed to know what you mean?  I am, after all, part of
your audience.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You presupposed human evolution true and then said: &quot;Ray, since you
&gt; accept natural processes to be God ordained or controlled, why not
&gt; accept human evolution?&quot;
">

I presuppose that *if* human evolution occurred, it was a natural
process, and that you do not, in fact, *know* that it did not occur,
and that your personal beliefs do not determine reality.  Now, you of
course do not accept that evolution did occur.  But your principle
argument for this position is not that the evidence contradicts it
(you say it does, of course, but you have only the most cursory and
error-laden aquaintance with the evidence, so that cannot be your
primary reason), but that evolution automatically rules out God.  I am
attempting to point out that evolution does NOT automatically rule out
God, so that if you wish to continue to argue against evolution, you
ought to learn something about the evidence and how to interpret it.

&gt; Answer: you already know that I am a Creationist, which makes this
&gt; whole issue a sorry charade.

You're a very concrete thinker, Ray.  Normally, that would mean that
you cannot deal with abstractions and hypotheticals, but in this case
I am seriously considering the possibility that the space between your
ears is filled with a mixture of cement, sand and gravel rather than
brains.
