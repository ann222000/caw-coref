What was &quot;unsuccessful&quot; or &quot;unwordly&quot;about Kennedy re: Cuba?

http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB103/index.htm

And what was &quot;unwordly&quot; about Kennedy's Vietnam approach, which kept
the US's military commitment to a minimum? Not a big enough bang for
you?

&quot;At the time of the Kennedy and Diem assassinations, there were 16,000
military advisers in Vietnam. The Kennedy administration had managed
to run the war from Washington without the large-scale introduction of
American combat troops. The continuing political problems in Saigon,
however, convinced the new president, Lyndon Baines Johnson, that more
aggressive action was needed. Perhaps Johnson was more prone to
military intervention or maybe events in Vietnam had forced the
president's hand to more direct action. In any event, after a dubious
DRV raid on two U.S. ships in the Gulf of Tonkin, the Johnson
administration argued for expansive war powers for the president.&quot;

However, I was referring to &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner.&quot; Kennedy did not
say, as you might have, &quot;Ich bin ein Amerikaner, so fuck off.&quot;

I don't think Kennedy was selfish, like you are.

President Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, on
March 2, 1963, in which they discuss concerns that a Senate
investigating committee might reveal that the president had authorized
jets from the U.S. aircraft carrier Essex to provide one hour of air
cover for the brigade's B-26 bombers on the morning of April 19.  The
unmarked jets failed to rendezvous with the bombers, however, because
the CIA and the Pentagon were unaware of a time zone difference
between Nicaragua and Cuba. Two B-26s were shot down and four
Americans lost.

Kennedy's policy. You'd be wrong, as usual.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Um, I don't recall asking for any pass, 2pid.

Using your 'logic', Kennedy is a bad guy for holding the lid on
Vietnam, while Johnson's increase was somehow equivalent. Kennedy had
less than one division in country. Johnson revved that up to several
divisions.

Kennedy worked to keep the US from becoming decisively engaged.
Johnson wanted to become decisively engaged. Can you see the subtle
difference?

You still have not read COL H.R. McMaster's book _Derilection of
Duty_. You should, as it is almost required reading in the military
these days. And we all want you to maintain your reputation for
military 'expertise', don't we?

Typical unsubstantiated claims on your part.

Johnson followed the natural progression of a failed Kennedy policy.
If Kennedy had truly kept a lid on Vietnam, Johnson would never
have had the opportunity to do what he did.

Remember, it was Kennedy who said,
&quot;Now we have a problem making our power credible and
Vietnam looks like the place&quot;
It was Kennedy who approved the coup and execution of Diem.
It was Kennedy who sent the Green Berets to Vietnam as &quot;advisors&quot;.
It was Kennedy who sent in the helicopters and created a joint
US - South Vietnames Air Force.
It was Kennedy who admitted he didn't know how to get out of
Vietnam.

Kennedy gets crowned for being executed..if history judged
him by his policies...he gets condemned.

Remember, this was Kennedy:

&quot;Kennedy's policy towards South Vietnam rested on the assumption that
Diem and his forces must ultimately defeat the guerrillas on their
own. He was against the deployment of American combat troops and
observed that &quot;to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today,
while it might have an initially favorable military impact, would
almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the long run,
adverse military consequences.&quot;[53]

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War#John_F._Kennedy.27s_escalati...

Sending advisors isn't &quot;committing the military&quot;, 2pid. Kennedy was
against that. The quotes you chose, as usual, run counter to the
'point' you are trying to make.

You haven't read _Dereliction of Duty_ yet, have you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&quot;The CIA was in contact with generals planning to remove Diem. They
were told that the United States would support such a move. President
Diem was overthrown and executed, along with his brother, on November
2, 1963. When he was informed, Maxwell Taylor remembered that Kennedy
&quot;rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his
face.&quot;[58] He had not approved Diem's murder.&quot;

Here, 2pid, I'll even spend the time... again, knowing that it's very
likely a total waste of my time. It's OK, 2pid: I enjoy reading
military history. Most professional soldiers do if they are in a
leadership position.

Here you go, 2pid. In an effort to 'discuss' this, I am linking you to
the official US Army history of Vietnam. If you decide to read it, pay
attention to the year 1964 and later. Note the shift from performing
an advisory function to authorization for offensive operations. Note
the other signs of &quot;mission creep&quot; (a self-explanatory military term.)
initiated by Johnson, including large-scale deployments of US troops.
It was McNamara and Johnson, in addition to the JCOS and other
military personnel (Westmoreland comes to mind), who got the ball
rolling after Kennedy's death.

http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/vietnam...

For a look into the true beginnings our escalation, from the
perspectives of both the military and civilian leadership, you could
always read _Dereliction of Duty_. The author, H.R. McMaster, is a
full colonel currently serving on active duty, although he was only a
peon major when he wrote it. COL McMaster is one of the architects of
the manual on COIN and I believe also serves as an advisor to GEN
Petraeus.

Now that I've gone to this effort to factually advance our
'discussion' and now that I have substantiated the counter to your
erroneous position which you said did not exist, you can just say,
&quot;Ooooops! I was wrong! My bad!&quot; and we'll be done with it.

Or you can always keep defending an impossible 'point' and prove what
everybody already knows: that it's wasted effort in linking you to the
correct information, that clearly-laid-out information is beyond you,
and that you are not really interested in discussions at all. You much
prefer 'discussions' (propaganda) and 'insults' (brainless).

Now for the &quot;Oh, BTW&quot;. The conclusion of the chapter on Vietnam in the
official US Army history:

&quot;The rediscovery of the Vietnam War suggests that its most important
legacy may be the lesson that unique historical, political, cultural,
and social [i.e. I would presume that religion is rolled into
&quot;culture&quot; or &quot;social&quot; here, or else its omission is clearly glaring]
factors always impinge on the military. Strategic and tactical success
rests not only on military progress but on correctly analyzing the
nature of the particular conflict, understanding the enemy's strategy
[i.e. within the context of those non-military factors above], and
realistically assessing the strengths and weaknesses of allies. A new
humility and a new sophistication may form the best parts of the
complex heritage left the Army by the long, bitter war in Vietnam.&quot;

Perhaps now you begin to see, 2pid, why tactical military successes
are not very high on my radar regarding our overall potential for
success in Iraq. Looking only at the military at the tactical level is
one way to insure failure, as we have done up until now, and which
bushie is trying his ass off to perpetuate. GEN Petraeus' report was
the second most important report given to Congress that day. And
perhaps you'll also begin to see some pretty striking similarities
between Iraq and Vietnam.

Here's another interesting quote from this article:

&quot;First under the auspices of the Central  Intelligence Agency and then
under a military commander, the Special Forces organized the highland
tribes into the Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) and in time
sought to recruit other ethnic groups and sects in the South as well.
To this scheme, underwritten almost entirely by the United States,
Diem gave only tepid support. Indeed, the civilian irregulars drew
strength from groups traditionally hostile to Saigon. Treated with
disdain by the lowland Vietnamese, the Montagnards developed close,
trusting relations with their Army advisers. Special Forces detachment
commanders frequently were the real leaders of CIDG units. This strong
mutual bond of loyalty between adviser and highlander benefited
operations, but some tribal leaders sought to exploit the special
relationship to advance Montagnard political autonomy. On occasion,
Special Forces advisers found themselves in the awkward position of
mediating between militant Montagnards and South Vietnamese officials
who were suspicious and wary of the Americans' sympathy for the
highlanders.&quot;

Substitute &quot;Sunni&quot; and &quot;Shia&quot; and &quot;Kurds&quot; for &quot;Montagnards&quot; and
&quot;Lowlanders&quot; and substitute &quot;Diem&quot; for &quot;Maliki&quot; and see what you get.
This is why I'm not overly optimistic about basing &quot;success&quot; on our
new-found friends, the Sunnis.

And yet another striking similarity: &quot;But potential benefits were
nullified by the absence of a clear doctrine and a coherent
operational strategy for the conduct of counterinsurgency, and by
chronic military and political shortcomings on the part of the South
Vietnamese.&quot; You can read about the rampant corruption in the
government of the RVN on your own.

History is a bitch, isn't it, 2pid? It's too bad people never seem to
learn anything from it. It's not too late for you, though, 2pid. I
promise.

Lol!

Yes...Johnson made a transititon Kennedy had opposed.
But there was nothing that proves Kennedy would not have changed his
mind and your post does NOTHING to refute my assertion that Kenndy's
policy was a significant escalation on it's own and led to Johnson's
actions...and to a large degree forced him to do so.
Especially the coup which led to anarchy.
He died leaving Johnson faced with accepting the complete
failure of Kennedy's policy or sending in the troops.
Failing to recognize Kennedy's role in laying the groundwork
for events to come after his death is to ignore history.

Indeed. There's NOTHING to prove that Kennedy, if he had lived, might
not have &quot;changed his mind&quot; and dropped a nuke on Hanoi. Kennedy
clearly added more advisors. Who committed the US military and
escalated the war to the point of inextricably engaging the US
military as a combat force?

When arguing history, 2pid, it is often better to use things that
actually happened, rather than speculation on what MIGHT have
happened, if only...

So you're clearly right. Kennedy MIGHT HAVE done anything, once he had
changed his policy and changed his mind, if indeed he had ever done
so.

Using your 'logic' Roosevelt MIGHT HAVE surrendered to the Japanese
had he lived. So where does that leave us?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Especially the coup which led to anarchy.
">

He supported a coup that was going to happen anyway. In fact, an
argument could be made that the mess was Diem's fault to begin with:

&quot;As opposition to Di m's rule in South Vietnam grew, a low-level
insurgency began to take shape there in 1957. Finally, in January
1959, under pressure from southern cadres who were being successfully
targeted by Di m's secret police, Hanoi's Central Committee issued a
secret resolution authorizing the use of armed struggle in the South.
On 20 December 1960, under instruction from Hanoi, southern communists
established the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam in
order to overthrow the government of the south. The NLF was made up of
two distinct groups: South Vietnamese intellectuals who opposed the
government and were nationalists; and communists who had remained in
the south after the partition and regrouping of 1954 as well as those
who had since come from the north, together with local peasants. While
there were many non-communist members of the NLF, they were subject to
the control of the party cadres and increasingly side-lined as the
conflict continued; they did, however, enable the NLF to portray
itself as a primarily nationalist, rather than communist, movement.&quot;

So Johnson faced a choice. That happens to leaders sometimes, 2pid,
and then they have to decide which path to take. That happens to
sergeants and second lieutenants, and it maybe even happens to low-
level lackeys like you.

The failure was not Kennedy's: that ball had started rolling under
Truman. Why are you giving Truman and Eisenhower a 'pass'? Johnson
made the choices (or probably more accurately, McNamara did).

Kennedy's policy was an extension of Eisenhower's policy. Therefore,
using your 'logic', it was all Eisenhower's fault. Unless Eisenhower
might have changed his mind if his term hadn't ended when it did.
Therefore, it is Eisenhower who might have nuked Hanoi, and who may
have escalated the war. Unless you consider Truman... Lol!

Case closed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Who's 'ignoring' it, 2pid? Stopping at Kennedy removes Eisenhower from
the chain.

So where does Eisenhower fit in? He had 500 advisors on the ground.
The escalation that Johnson oversaw, as well as the switch from a
clearly advisory role to one of offensive operations and a commitment
of the US military, must have been his fault.

Johnson, as President of the US and CinC of all the military, made his
choices. Did Kennedy make mistakes? Sure, as did Eisenhower and
Truman. To attempt to blame Kennedy for Johnson's escalation and
greater involvement in the war is a stupid position. That's like
trying to blame bushie's folly in Iraq on the British for their
creation of Iraq in the first place.

As I said, 2pid, 'discussing' things with you is a waste of time.
Basing an argument on what &quot;might have&quot; happened is clearly not a
rational position, particularly when we're not trying to
prognosticate.

And you haven't read _Dereliction of Duty_. Why not? What are you
afraid of? Lol!

Kennedy clearly recognized he did exactly that

that he had no idea how to get out of Vietnam.
The &quot;inextricable engagement&quot; occurred long before the
first combat troops were deployed, Kennedy's own words
show that clearly.
His comment shows that while he loathed having to commit combat troops,
he was also subject to the same inevitability of his policies that
Johnson was.

Here's an interview with Robert Kennedy that clearly says there
was no plan to pullout and they had to stay in and could not lose.

http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/vietnam.htm

Here's what Kennedy said in an interview with Huntley/Brinkley in
Sept. '63.

Mr. BRINKLEY. Mr. President, have You had any reason to doubt
this so-called &quot;domino theory,&quot; that if South Viet-Nam falls, the rest
of Southeast Asia will go behind it ?

The PRESIDENT. No, I believe it. I believe it. I think that the
struggle is close enough. China is so large, looms so high just beyond
the frontiers, that if South Viet-Nam went, it would not only give them
an improved geographic position for a guerrilla assault on Malaya but
would also Live the impression that the wave of the future in Southeast
Asia was China and the Communists. So I believe it.

&quot;Kennedy's policy towards South Vietnam rested on the assumption that
Diem and his forces must ultimately defeat the guerrillas on their

observed that &quot;to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today,
while it might have an initially favorable military impact, would
almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the long run,
adverse military consequences.&quot;[53]

You want to argue history based on your opinions and beliefs and
hypothetical probablilities, when your reading on the subject is
obviously sorely lacking. I prefer to argue history on what actually
happened.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You seem to imply that Johnson's escalation was a continuation of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kennedy's policy. You'd be wrong, as usual.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Typical unsubstantiated claims on your part.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Here, 2pid, I'll even spend the time... again, knowing that it's very
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; likely a total waste of my time. It's OK, 2pid: I enjoy reading
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; military history. Most professional soldiers do if they are in a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; leadership position.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Here you go, 2pid. In an effort to 'discuss' this, I am linking you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the official US Army history of Vietnam. If you decide to read it,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pay
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; attention to the year 1964 and later.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes...Johnson made a transititon Kennedy had opposed.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Oh, really? That's news to me!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But there was nothing that proves Kennedy would not have changed his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mind and your post does NOTHING to refute my assertion that Kennedy's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; policy was a significant escalation on it's own and led to Johnson's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; actions...and to a large degree forced him to do so.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Indeed. There's NOTHING to prove that Kennedy, if he had lived, might
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not have &quot;changed his mind&quot; and dropped a nuke on Hanoi. Kennedy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; clearly added more advisors. Who committed the US military and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; escalated the war to the point of inextricably engaging the US
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; military as a combat force?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Kennedy clearly recognized he did exactly that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with his admission shortly before his assassination
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that he had no idea how to get out of Vietnam.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The &quot;inextricable engagement&quot; occurred long before the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; first combat troops were deployed, Kennedy's own words
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; show that clearly.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; His comment shows that while he loathed having to commit combat troops,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he was also subject to the same inevitability of his policies that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Johnson was.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Here's an interview with Robert Kennedy that clearly says there
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was no plan to pullout and they had to stay in and could not lose.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/vietnam.htm

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Here's what Kennedy said in an interview with Huntley/Brinkley in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sept. '63.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mr. BRINKLEY. Mr. President, have You had any reason to doubt
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this so-called &quot;domino theory,&quot; that if South Viet-Nam falls, the rest
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  of Southeast Asia will go behind it ?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The PRESIDENT. No, I believe it. I believe it. I think that the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; struggle is close enough. China is so large, looms so high just beyond
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  the frontiers, that if South Viet-Nam went, it would not only give them
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; an improved geographic position for a guerrilla assault on Malaya but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; would also Live the impression that the wave of the future in Southeast
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Asia was China and the Communists. So I believe it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When arguing history, 2pid, it is often better to use things that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; actually happened, rather than speculation on what MIGHT have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happened, if only...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; We know what happened.  The issue you are unable to contemplate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are why they happened.  Kennedy is central to that.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So are Truman and Eisenhower.

&gt;&gt;  Certainly...it was all a chain of events. Each depended on history.
&gt;&gt; Johnson couldn't do what he did if Kennedy had pulled out.
&gt;&gt; Kennedy couldn't do what he did if Eisenhower had forced
&gt;&gt; legit elections according to Geneva accords and so on.

&gt;&gt; But then there is also the possibility that if any had done so...
&gt;&gt; there would not be democracies in the region like Singapore and
&gt;&gt; the Philippines.

&gt; History is full of possibilities, 2pid. What if Hannibal hadn't
&gt; &quot;discovered&quot; the elephant?

&gt;&gt; &gt; The same kind of rhetoric is now
&gt;&gt; &gt; revolving around Iran. Does that automatically mean that we're &quot;going
&gt;&gt; &gt; in&quot;?

&gt;&gt; No.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; IMO, Johnson simply carried on with a policy Kennedy put
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in place.  I have little doubt that if Kennedy had not been killed,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he would have made the same decisions Johnson made.

&gt;&gt; &gt; At least you admit that your argument is only based on opinion and
&gt;&gt; &gt; belief.

&gt;&gt;  Pathetic and childish but typical of you.

&gt; Why would that be, 2pid? 'Discussions' are based on what one party or
&gt; the other says. You state &quot;IMO&quot; and &quot;I have little doubt&quot;. What would
&gt; you call that aside from opinion and belief?

&gt;&gt; &gt; His beliefs AND his policy were both against what Johnson ended up

&gt;&gt; Common misconception not supported by all the relevant facts

&gt; &quot;Kennedy's policy towards South Vietnam rested on the assumption that

&gt; observed that &quot;to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today,

Yes you would accept such a trifle bit of evidence simply because it
agrees with your POV.
In the meantime his actions told a different story.
He increased advisers 30 fold. He authorized US combat air force operations.
He increased military aid.
He approved the use of defoliants, authorized destruction of rice crops
and then approved a coup of Diem.

Not true.

&quot;In 1964 the United States began full-scale military operations on the
side of South Vietnam and, in 1965, launched Operation Rolling Thunder
against targets in North Vietnam.&quot;

http://www.airforce.com/mission/history_p3.php

&quot;The first American military personnel to arrive at NKP in 1963 were
the U.S. Navy's Mobile Construction Battalion Three (Seabees) who
undertook the task of constructing the runways and raising the first
buildings as part of a United States commitment under SEATO. In early
1964 the 507th Tactical Control Squadron became the first USAF unit
assigned to the base, with the 5th Tactical Control Group being the
host unit.

*****Nakhon Phanom originally housed search and rescue forces and
maintained a communications capability in support of U.S. Air Force
objectives in Southeast Asia.***** (emphasis mine, note the types of
missions authorized.)

In May 1965 the 6235th Air Base Squadron was formed and assumed host
command responsibilities. On 8 April 1966 the 6235th Air Base Squadron
was discontinued and the 634th Combat Support Group along with its
subordinate squadrons was activated.&quot;

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakhon_Phanom_Royal_Thai_Air_Force_Base

Kennedy did send Army Aviation to Vietnam. These were transportation,
medical lift, and search-and-rescue assets.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You seem to imply that Johnson's escalation was a continuation
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kennedy's policy. You'd be wrong, as usual.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Typical unsubstantiated claims on your part.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Here, 2pid, I'll even spend the time... again, knowing that it's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; very
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; likely a total waste of my time. It's OK, 2pid: I enjoy reading
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; military history. Most professional soldiers do if they are in a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; leadership position.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Here you go, 2pid. In an effort to 'discuss' this, I am linking
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the official US Army history of Vietnam. If you decide to read it,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pay
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; attention to the year 1964 and later.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yes...Johnson made a transititon Kennedy had opposed.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Oh, really? That's news to me!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But there was nothing that proves Kennedy would not have changed his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mind and your post does NOTHING to refute my assertion that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Kennedy's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; policy was a significant escalation on it's own and led to Johnson's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; actions...and to a large degree forced him to do so.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Indeed. There's NOTHING to prove that Kennedy, if he had lived, might
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not have &quot;changed his mind&quot; and dropped a nuke on Hanoi. Kennedy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; clearly added more advisors. Who committed the US military and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; escalated the war to the point of inextricably engaging the US
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; military as a combat force?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Kennedy clearly recognized he did exactly that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with his admission shortly before his assassination
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that he had no idea how to get out of Vietnam.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The &quot;inextricable engagement&quot; occurred long before the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; first combat troops were deployed, Kennedy's own words
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; show that clearly.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; His comment shows that while he loathed having to commit combat troops,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he was also subject to the same inevitability of his policies that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Johnson was.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Here's an interview with Robert Kennedy that clearly says there
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was no plan to pullout and they had to stay in and could not lose.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/vietnam.htm

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Here's what Kennedy said in an interview with Huntley/Brinkley in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sept. '63.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mr. BRINKLEY. Mr. President, have You had any reason to doubt
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this so-called &quot;domino theory,&quot; that if South Viet-Nam falls, the rest
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  of Southeast Asia will go behind it ?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The PRESIDENT. No, I believe it. I believe it. I think that the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; struggle is close enough. China is so large, looms so high just beyond
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  the frontiers, that if South Viet-Nam went, it would not only give
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; them
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; an improved geographic position for a guerrilla assault on Malaya but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; would also Live the impression that the wave of the future in Southeast
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Asia was China and the Communists. So I believe it.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When arguing history, 2pid, it is often better to use things that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; actually happened, rather than speculation on what MIGHT have
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happened, if only...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; We know what happened.  The issue you are unable to contemplate
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are why they happened.  Kennedy is central to that.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; So are Truman and Eisenhower.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Certainly...it was all a chain of events. Each depended on history.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Johnson couldn't do what he did if Kennedy had pulled out.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Kennedy couldn't do what he did if Eisenhower had forced
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; legit elections according to Geneva accords and so on.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But then there is also the possibility that if any had done so...
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there would not be democracies in the region like Singapore and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the Philippines.

&gt;&gt; &gt; History is full of possibilities, 2pid. What if Hannibal hadn't
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;discovered&quot; the elephant?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The same kind of rhetoric is now
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; revolving around Iran. Does that automatically mean that we're &quot;going
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in&quot;?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; IMO, Johnson simply carried on with a policy Kennedy put
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in place.  I have little doubt that if Kennedy had not been killed,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he would have made the same decisions Johnson made.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; At least you admit that your argument is only based on opinion and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; belief.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;  Pathetic and childish but typical of you.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Why would that be, 2pid? 'Discussions' are based on what one party or
&gt;&gt; &gt; the other says. You state &quot;IMO&quot; and &quot;I have little doubt&quot;. What would
&gt;&gt; &gt; you call that aside from opinion and belief?

&gt;&gt; My opinion is based on the preponderance of the evidence which
&gt;&gt; you choose to ignore and counter with posturing.

&gt; &quot;Posturing&quot; and &quot;ignorance&quot; usually does not include references to
&gt; official histories, 2pid.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Perhaps it is your argument that is &quot;pathetic&quot; and &quot;childish&quot;.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That's progress.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; His beliefs and his policy left him no choice.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; His beliefs AND his policy were both against what Johnson ended up
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doing.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Common misconception not supported by all the relevant facts
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as I've shown.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Kennedy's policy towards South Vietnam rested on the assumption that
&gt;&gt; &gt; Diem and his forces must ultimately defeat the guerrillas on their
&gt;&gt; &gt; own. He was against the deployment of American combat troops and
&gt;&gt; &gt; observed that &quot;to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today,
&gt;&gt; &gt; while it might have an initially favorable military impact, would
&gt;&gt; &gt; almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the long run,
&gt;&gt; &gt; adverse military consequences.&quot;[53]

&gt;&gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War#John_F._Kennedy.27s_escalati ...

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yup. I'm convinced.

&gt;&gt; Yes you would accept such a trifle bit of evidence simply because it
&gt;&gt; agrees with your POV.

&gt; And because it fits with Kennedy's actions, but you go girl.

&gt;&gt; In the meantime his actions told a different story.

&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt; He increased advisers 30 fold. He authorized US combat air force operations.

&gt; Not true.

&gt; &quot;The first American military personnel to arrive at NKP in 1963 were
&gt; the U.S. Navy's Mobile Construction Battalion Three (Seabees) who
&gt; undertook the task of constructing the runways and raising the first

As relevant as defoliation is to the subject at hand.

I answered this once, perhaps the long answer will show up eventually.

Here you go, 2pid. As usual, you're too lazy to research. Your
'opinions' and 'beliefs' are more important than mere facts. Note
where this is published, as well.

&quot;McNamara [in his book] said, 'We were wrong, terribly wrong'[about
Vietnam] but that he and others were prisoners of the Cold War
ideology of containment. So they had no flexibility. It didn't matter
who the President was, who the Secretary of Defense was, who the
members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were, because they were compelled
by the ideology of the time.&quot;

&quot;What this new evidence shows dramatically is that these were men who
not only should have known better but who did know better. It also
shows that the war, far from being inevitable, was only made possible
by the deliberate deceit and manipulation of the American public, the
Congress, and members of Johnson's own administration.&quot;

Now why do you suppose this is on the recommended reading list for the
military? Any 'thoughts' on that, 2pid? Why has it been read by most
senior Army leaders? If you know more than they do about it, 2pid,
they will listen to you. Call the Pentagon right away!

Data says.....yes.

Since the rapid escalation was in response to the anarchy created
by the Kennedy approved coup of Diem...is it likely he would have
declared that strategy a failure and pulled out?

We know...McNamara says it was not discussed but thinks maybe.
Bobby Kennedy says they never discussed withdrawal.
You seem to think Kennedy would have suddenly implemented a policy
never discussed.

Yes, &quot;Code Pinkos&quot; like COL H.R. McMaster, Colonel, USA. BTW, 2pid, do
you suppose that a person who wrote a book as a major would make
colonel if what he wrote was not true, not well researched, not well
referenced, and so on? Do you suppose a book on history that was not
valid would survive the scrutiny of historians and fellow military
officers? Duh.

So why don't you support the troops, 2pid? Isn't calling an active-

What a dilemma you've created for yourself. It would be &quot;lucky&quot; if one

If McNamara could have such discussions with Johnson...what makes

Anyway, none of that matters.

Here's another take on the issue.

http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DC1E39F936A25751...

&quot; President Kennedy's view of Vietnam in July 1961: In the summer of 1961, Gen.
Maxwell D. Taylor and I were working with the President on this matter. Our
joint memorandum to the President dated Aug. 4 said:
&quot;As we understand your position: you would wish to see every avenue of diplomacy
exhausted before we accept the necessity for either positioning United States
forces on the Southeast Asian mainland or fighting there; you would wish to see
the possibilities of economic assistance fully exploited to strengthen the
Southeast Asian position; you would wish to see indigenous forces used to the
maximum if fighting should occur; and that should we have to fight, we should
use air and sea power to the maximum and engage minimum United States forces on
the Southeast Asian mainland.&quot;

On this basis the Taylor mission went to Southeast Asia in October. &quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; You seem to think Kennedy would have suddenly implemented a policy
&gt;&gt; never discussed.

&gt; No, again, this is a strawman. I have never said anything about
&gt; Kennedy pulling out.
">

That is to deny history. The choices in '65 were limited to go in
with force or get out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; We *do* know what Johnson *did.*

But that is not the question under discussion.

&gt; It's funny, too: every time it's made, it's true. LOL!

&gt;&gt; Meawhile this little discussion reveals your deep-seated

&gt;&gt; accept a different pov about things that can never be known.

&gt; What this actually shows, 2pid, is your particular habit of adhering
&gt; to a set position, regardless of differing evidence that you not only
&gt; do not know, but refuse to look at. Um, kind of like a dog with a

Evidence is easy to evaluate.
Is it relevant to the question?....if no disregard.

I have looked at:

2. Kennedy's stated opinions and his official policies, and

3. The personality differences between Kennedy and Johnson. I came up

Here's the question for you 2pid:

Do you 'think' JFK would have lied to Congress, would have told his
advisors what to tell him, would've been ultimately concerned with
&quot;keeping everybody 'on the Johnson [Kennedy] team'&quot;, would have
secretly sent in combat troops in dribs and drabs until we were
actually committed before anybody knew what was happening, would have
been as open to the machinations of the JCOS and others, would have
been ultimately concerned with loyalty and presenting a united
front...

Your position is that Johnson was forced into making the choices he
did. The evidence strongly says otherwise, but it is, after all,
evidence that you refuse to consider or look at.

What is that you're chasing? Ah, yes. It's your tail... again.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Here you go, 2pid. As usual, you're too lazy to research. Your
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 'opinions' and 'beliefs' are more important than mere facts. Note
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; where this is published, as well.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;McNamara [in his book] said, 'We were wrong, terribly wrong'[about
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Vietnam] but that he and others were prisoners of the Cold War
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ideology of containment. So they had no flexibility. It didn't matter
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; who the President was, who the Secretary of Defense was, who the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were, because they were compelled
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; by the ideology of the time.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sounds like he agrees with me.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Uh-huh. Did you keep reading? Watch:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;What this new evidence shows dramatically is that these were men who
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not only should have known better but who did know better. It also
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shows that the war, far from being inevitable, was only made possible
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; by the deliberate deceit and manipulation of the American public, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Congress, and members of Johnson's own administration.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt;  and it also says...

&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;_______ forgot about integrity and followed a course of &quot;arrogance,
&gt; &gt;&gt; weakness,
&gt; &gt;&gt; lying in the pursuit of self-interest, and, above all, the abdication of
&gt; &gt;&gt; responsibility to the American people.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; You could easily insert Harry Reid or Pelosi and be spot on.

&gt; &gt; Did they lie and start a war that I wasn't aware of?

&gt; Nah...they just try to lie and lose one for political gain.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; And if you go read this, look at how important Johnson's personality
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and emotional traits were an issue.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Yeah...but this say nothing to the question...what would Kennedy do.

&gt; &gt; And to discuss that... ...you need to understand what Johnson and crew
&gt; &gt; *did*.

&gt; You appear to presume that the only course to war was the
&gt; &quot;crooked&quot; one Johnhson took...and presume Kennedy would
&gt; not follow that path nor make his own to war.
&gt; That's just plain bizaare.  BTW...Kennedy's Bay of Pigs fiasco
&gt; shows he wasn't all that strong in resisting foolish recomendations
&gt; of his advisors.

&gt; &gt; You do not. Therefore, further 'discussion' on this topic will
&gt; &gt; likely result in &quot;circular&quot; 'logic' which is very much like a dog
&gt; &gt; chasing its tail.

&gt;  BS spin...

Fact based on long evidence.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You want to anoint him and claim the deity could never have been
&gt; &gt;&gt; the schmuck that Johnson was...except his track record while in office
&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't support it.  And that's really the only relevant evidence there
&gt; &gt;&gt; is.

&gt; &gt; I have not &quot;anointed&quot; anybody, 2pid. My, what an 'imagination' we
&gt; &gt; have!

&gt; &gt; I have looked at:

&gt; &gt; 1. How Johnson (and crew) got us into Vietnam in a big way, and with
&gt; &gt; combat soldiers, and

&gt; &gt; 2. Kennedy's stated opinions and his official policies, and

&gt; &gt; 3. The personality differences between Kennedy and Johnson. I came up
&gt; &gt; with a different conclusion.

&gt; Perhaps Kennedy wouldn't have been the schmuck Johnson was...but
&gt; that does not support the conclusion that when faced with the choices
&gt; of defeat or commit troops...he would have withdrawn and accepted defeat.
">

I never said that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There is no evidence of that beyond his stated &quot;desire&quot; to not have to commit
&gt; troops to prevent defeat, but nothing shows he would have chosen defeat.
&gt; In fact...there is much to the contrary.

Here's the question for you 2pid:

Do you 'think' JFK would have lied to Congress, would have told his
advisors what to tell him, would've been ultimately concerned with
&quot;keeping everybody 'on the Johnson [Kennedy] team'&quot;, would have
secretly sent in combat troops in dribs and drabs until we were
actually committed before anybody knew what was happening, would have
been as open to the machinations of the JCOS and others, would have
been ultimately concerned with loyalty and presenting a united
front...

Your position is that Johnson was forced into making the choices he
did. The evidence strongly says otherwise, but it is, after all,
evidence that you refuse to consider or look at.

What is that you're chasing? Ah, yes. It's your tail... again.
