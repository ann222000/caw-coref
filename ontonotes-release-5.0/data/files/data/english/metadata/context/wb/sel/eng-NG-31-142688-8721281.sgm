The NYT's Admits Mistake In MoveOn Ad

A &quot;stunner&quot; from the NYT's on a Sunday:

FOR nearly two weeks, The New York Times has been defending a political
advertisement that critics say was an unfair shot at the American commander
in Iraq.

But I think the ad violated The Times's own written standards, and the
paper now says that the advertiser got a price break it was not entitled to.

~~~

Did MoveOn.org get favored treatment from The Times? And was the ad
outside the bounds of acceptable political discourse?

The answer to the first question is that MoveOn.org paid what is known in
the newspaper industry as a standby rate of $64,575 that it should not have
received under Times policies. The group should have paid $142,083. The
Times had maintained for a week that the standby rate was appropriate, but a
company spokeswoman told me late Thursday afternoon that an advertising
sales representative made a mistake.

The answer to the second question is that the ad appears to fly in the
face of an internal advertising acceptability manual that says, &quot;We do not
accept opinion advertisements that are attacks of a personal nature.&quot; Steph
Jespersen, the executive who approved the ad, said that, while it was
&quot;rough,&quot; he regarded it as a comment on a public official's management of
his office and therefore acceptable speech for The Times to print.

~~~

Catherine Mathis, vice president of corporate communications for The
Times, said, &quot;We made a mistake.&quot; She said the advertising representative
failed to make it clear that for that rate The Times could not guarantee the
Monday placement but left MoveOn.org with the understanding that the ad
would run then. She added, &quot;That was contrary to our policies.&quot;

Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the publisher of The Times and chairman of its
parent company, declined to name the salesperson or to say whether
disciplinary action would be taken.

Jespersen, director of advertising acceptability, reviewed the ad and
approved it. He said the question mark after the headline figured in his
decision.

The Times bends over backward to accommodate advocacy ads, including ads
from groups with which the newspaper disagrees editorially. Jespersen has
rejected an ad from the National Right to Life Committee, not, he said,
because of its message but because it pictured aborted fetuses. He also
rejected an ad from MoveOn.org that contained a doctored photograph of
Cheney. The photo was replaced, and the ad ran.

Sulzberger, who said he wasn't aware of MoveOn.org's latest ad until it
appeared in the paper, said: &quot;If we're going to err, it's better to err on
the side of more political dialogue. ... Perhaps we did err in this case. If
we did, we erred with the intent of giving greater voice to people.&quot;

Oh yeah, we see ads in the NYT's all the time from conservative groups.  Who
does this guy think he's kidding?  While admitting that they made a mistake
is one thing they must also admit their political bias played a big part in
this story.  This was most definitely not an admission of this fact instead
its an admission of an accounting error by a employee who failed to tell
MoveOn that they could not guarantee the day and placement of the ad at that
rate.

This is a problem of bias inside the newspaper plain and simple.  They think
nothing about revealing state secrets which hurt our war on terrorism.  They
think nothing about putting an ad which disgraces a man who has served this
country honorably almost all his life.

And then this editor admits to an accounting error and that the only thing
they are upset about is that the ad didn't hurt Bush, rather it had the
opposite effect.

There should be a congressional inquiry into the practices of the NYT's to
see just how far back these illegal political contributions to the Democrat
party have gone on.  Won't happen but it's what is called for in this
instance.

The New York Times is nothing but a irrelevant big city leftist cult rag, it
is NOT a legitimate newspaper anymore.

Kim's North Korea, as Kirkpatrick says, was, and is, truly a &quot;psychotic
state.&quot; Said Carter of the &quot;Great Leader,&quot; &quot;I find him to be vigorous,
intelligent, surprisingly well informed about the technical issues, and in
charge of the decisions about this country&quot; (well, he was absolute ruler).
He said, &quot;I don't see that they [the North Koreans] are an outlaw nation.&quot;
Pyongyang, he observed, was a &quot;bustling city,&quot; where shoppers &quot;pack the
department stores,&quot; reminding him of the &quot;Wal-Mart in Americus, Georgia.&quot;
Carter also employed his longstanding technique of praising the beauty of a
dictator's wife. Kim Jon Ae, he noted, &quot;is a very attractive lady.&quot;

Why do you clip the actual text of the message, Harry? Could it be you
are... LYING? Here's the actual text (available on the NY Times site):

How did this happen?

Eli Pariser, the executive director of MoveOn.org, told me that his
group called The Times on the Friday before Petraeus's appearance on
Capitol Hill and asked for a rush ad in Monday's paper. He said The
Times called back and &quot;told us there was room Monday, and it would
cost $65,000.&quot; Pariser said there was no discussion about a standby
rate. &quot;We paid this rate before, so we recognized it,&quot; he said.
Advertisers who get standby rates aren't guaranteed what day their ad
will appear, only that it will be in the paper within seven days.

Catherine Mathis, vice president of corporate communications for The
Times, said, &quot;We made a mistake.&quot; She said the advertising
representative failed to make it clear that for that rate The Times
could not guarantee the Monday placement but left MoveOn.org with the
understanding that the ad would run then. She added, &quot;That was
contrary to our policies.&quot;

Hmm. Seems like that's not at ALL what she said. Gee, what a surprise,
Republicans lying.

And then there is this...

Bradley A. Blakeman, former deputy assistant to President Bush for
appointments and scheduling and the head of FreedomsWatch.org, said
his group wanted to run its own reply ad last Monday and was quoted
the $64,575 rate on a standby basis. The ad wasn't placed, he said,
because the newspaper wouldn't guarantee him the day or a position in
the first section. Sulzberger said all advocacy ads normally run in
the first section.

Gee, seems like the Times was being a newspaper. And you were being a
liar. What a stunning surprise.

The NY Times can charge whatever it wants to whomever it wants.  I
didn't know there was a law saying they had to run their business in a
way that suits right wing nuts.

When news organizations banned free speech, such as banning all anti war
and anti Bush ads prior to war, that was something to whine about. But
to whine about MoveOn.org getting a less expensive ad borders on pathetic.
