Way back in the early dawn of my post adolescent life, I met a bike
rider.  He had a Yamaha Virago 750.  This was my first real encounter
with a motorcycle and someone who rides one just for the sake of
riding.

At first I didn't get the appeal.  I used to peddle around on a
bicycle as my only means of transportation.  I never really liked it.
Going up hills gets tiring after a while.  But this thing had a motor
on it.

I had a shit job at the time.  But I was able to get enough money
together to buy a very, very used Kawasaki 442 LTD.  It even came with
some spare bits because the bike was built out of two such bikes.  I
got it for a song (in those days, a song was $100).

The LTD had no working guages.  It also had no working signals or
headlamp.  At least the brake light worked.  I think.  I never
bothered to register it.  I didn't have a permit or anything.  It was
not in any way legal for street use.

The former owner was nice enough to ride the bike to my house.  At
least that proved it ran!

The place I lived in at the time belonged to my Grandmother and used
to be a working farm.  It had a nice large field in the front where I
could start to get a feel for this machine that was much heavier than
any two wheeler I had ever been on in the past.  No, I was never
allowed to touch the Virago.

I got a quick introduction to the controls and then I was on my own.
The inline twin sputtered and choked until it reached operating
temperature.  At that point it just ran really rough.  Did I mention
the bald tires?

I took the bike out into the field to practice.  Falling down in grass
is quite painless.  I learned how to get the bike moving without
stalling.  I learned how to control a rear wheel skid.  I practiced
leaning until the bike would shoot out from under me.  I dropped that
sucker more times than I can count.  And I can count pretty well
because I've always been good at math.

Eventually I dared to take it out on the road.  I was always pushing
myself.  All I had for protection was an ancient Bell helmet with no
visor, some leather gloves, and old construction boots.  I guess if I
ever went down on the road, I would have left most of my skin behind.

I had a few scares from going into turns too fast.  But I found that
the bike had more traction than I gave it credit for.  Of course I
knew nothing about this thing called counter steering.  I didn't
understand motorcycle dynamics at all.  About all I had learned from
practice in the field was that if I lock the front wheel, the bike
falls down fast.

I got about three months out of the LTD before the front tire stopped
holding air.  Then my dog decided the electrics would make a good chew
toy.  That was that for the LTD.  It would never run again.  And I had
no money for another bike.

And so the years went by.  I learned a more lucrative trade and would
occasionally think back on the good times I had with the LTD, short
though they were.  I had this itch I couldn't scratch.  Occasionally I
would buy some bike magazines.  The prices of new bikes were not
encouraging.  I never again considered going used because of the LTD.
I had seen what other bikers did to their bikes and decided that I
would never know how to pick out a good used bike.

I also thought that motorcycles were like bicycles.  Once you know how
to ride one, you never forget.  Well, you all know how that turned
out.

So back in January of 2006 I had some money.  Not a huge amount of
money.  But I also had some credit (not good, but apparently not so
bad that I couldn't finance at an exorbitant interest rate).  Also
there was a new Honda dealer just minutes from my home.

I knew what kind of bike I wanted going in the door.  I knew the bike
would fall over so anything covered in plastic was out.  I wanted to
be able to flat foot the bike.  I didn't want a cruiser.  I wanted a
standard.  Honda had one: the 599.  It also matched another criteria I
had.  I knew that I was buying for the long haul.  I didn't want
something where I would be unhappy with the power after six months.

I was assured that the 599 would be perfect for me.

I also fell in love with it.  It seemed perfect in every way.  When I
sat on it, it fit.  This was my bike.

I knew that I would need training and such.  I was going to do things
right this time.  I got my PA learner's permit at the DMV and
scheduled an MSF course through the PAMSP program.  But I couldn't
wait to ride a bike that I now had in my posession.  And this time I
didn't have a large field I could play in.

I did have a local high school near by and I practiced in one of their
parking lots.  I discovered that I had indeed forgotten how to ride a
motorcycle as people on a certain news group had pointed out.  I wish
I had listened.  More to the point, I wish I had believed.  Between
MSF training weekends I fixated on and rode into a rock.  I was
devastated.

The old joy of riding on two wheels with a motor to push me along had
come back with a vengeance and suddenly I did more damage than I had
money to repair.  Only the evil beast known as credit was able to save
me.  A smaller down payment and a higher interest loan later put me on
an identical bike.

Why would I do such a fiscally irresponsible thing?  Well that is the
point of this post.

Back in the day, before I met the Virago and LTD, I was going to a
small college in Daytona Beach, Florida that taught aviation.  I
wanted to be a pilot.  Sadly things didn't work out for me.  Flying is
freaking expensive as all get out.  Time spent in a Cessna 172 was a
dollar a minute.  I could have overcome that except for one rather
major problem.  I was not getting over air sickness.

Flying would be enjoyable for perhaps thirty minutes and then I would
start to feel deathly ill.  The sky was just not my environment.

But a motorcycle steers much like a plane does.  You lean a bike just
the way you roll a plane in a coordinated turn.  It feels a lot like
flying except you are rolling along the ground.  There is also the
rush of the wind and acceleration that you would have to pay major
cake for to get out of a car.  A bike is the next best thing to flying
and it doesn't make me sick.  It's also a lot cheaper and I don't have
to park at an airport.

I can also hop on the bike whenever the mood strikes me.  Is it
raining?  Who cares?  I don't need IFR certification.  And rain gear
does a remarkably good job of keeping me dry.  Is it hot outside?
I've got mesh gear to keep me reasonably cool.  Is it cold outside?
I've got cold weather gear too.  Just so long as it isn't too cold.

Night time is not a problem either.  There are fewer cars and their
headlights give them away around curves and over hills.  Deer are a
problem.  For some reason I ride more sensibly at night.  I can stop
well withing my visibility.  I'm not quite so carefull in the daylight
and that may well bite me in the ass one day.

But I didn't get a motorcycle to be safe.  Motorcycle and safe don't
seem to go together in a sentence.  Then again, a risk free life, if
there is such a thing, is a deadly dull boring life.  Fuck that.  I am
not yet so old that I want to play things safe all the time.  Don't
get me wrong.  Prudence often gets the better part of me.  But not
always.

I love riding a motorcycle because it gives me feelings that I don't
get any other way.  I can't afford an airplane or exotic sports car.
But I can afford (just barely) a motorcycle.  And it is fun.  It makes
me feel alive.  Not even the divine pursuit of programming does that
for me.

So how about you?

Are you into *any* kind of sport that involves the body in rapid motion?
Playing basketball, trail running, swimming, surfing, rock climbing,
gymnastics, ice skating, hockey, inline skating, skiing, snowboarding,
bicycle MX?

Anything like that will lead to a kinesthetic addiction. Parts of the brain
that aren't
used for abstract thinking and reasoning operate the muscles and the
intellect is just along for the ride as each new kinesthetic session begins.

The conscious mind thinks, &quot;Well, here I go again,&quot; and training takes over
and the muscles do the drill. That's why you'll see kids on beat up
sportbikes stunting or riding the same road over and over again.

They claim that they are &quot;adrenaline junkies&quot;, while actually they are
addicted to the kinesthesia of repetitive motion.

After an adrenaline rush, the body is literally &quot;pissed off&quot; and the person
urinates a lot. That's not a pleasant aftermath to a day of sport..

But, if the repetitive motion never reaches the level where adrenaline is
released, the person feels great after endorphins and dopamine, etc. are
flowing through the bloodstream.

I remember how great it felt to be headed home after a motorcycle race or a
track day that went well. All the stresses of work were forgotten.

As for me, I never wanted a motorcycle. I couldn't afford a sports car though,
and a guy in the Air Force told me where I could get a Honda cheap and I went
through all the tipovers and minor crashes just like you've experienced
recently.

But then I discovered that I liked mountain biking and trail running and
hiking a lot more than I liked riding, so I would be up at the crack of dawn
headed up into the hills while my four motorcycles sat in the garage.

The only places that I could get the full kinesthetic rush from a motorcycle
was on deserted back roads or on the racetrack, and if I just ran one sprint
race on a weekend, the cost of that activity was about $200 an hour.

That makes flying a Cessna 172 look like a bargain. Track days will run you
about $30 or $40 an hour, not counting tires or gasoline.

You pretty well summed it up for me in these last two paragraphs.

For me it started with moto-X, then as my first form of transport for
work. I worked my way up to road bikes....then got taken out by a blind
driver. Since then my bikes have been purely for pleasure. I get the
same buzz when a corner is taken cranked over and smooth as I do when
I'm hard on the brakes passing someone. The occasional &quot;Bloody hell!&quot;
with accompanying forearm sweats and hairs standing up on the back of
the neck when things look like they are going pear shaped is a different
buzz, but equally rewarding (afterwards).

FUN.  :)

As the phrase goes

&quot;Work to ride
Ride to work&quot;

I have a motorbike for those days when it is too wet to cycle to work.
Admittedly that might be an odd use for a 2004 R1. I bought it to
replace my previous R1 when I was faced with a 40 mile commute through
twisty country roads (the horror!). You can't complain when your daily
commute appears in a Bike magazine &quot;great rides&quot; pull-out.

As for the question of why I have a bike as my only motorised transport
and have never owned a car? I guess I am just a freak. A freak with a
sense of irony, as I work as a development engineer for one of the
world's biggest car makers.

One day I will feel like a grown-up, settle down and buy a car, but I
was only 40 last birthday so there is plenty of time left for that. :-)

The heck I wouldn't! Then every squid and wannabe would be out there screwing it

ride from the Port of Piegan to St. Regis...it's tight and twisty, it has BIG
fast sweepers and evil camouflaged decreasing radius turns that are right up
against a rock wall and all on nice quiet two lanes road. 8^) Mind the tourista

Not practical or cheap? How about:

* Lower cost insurance than a car

* Better gas mileage than a car

* Easier to park than a car (lots of urban nooks
and crannies)

* Goes through narrow places a car can't go
(Just yesterday I squeezed past an accident site
on a bridge, where cages were backed up for miles)

* Simpler than a car; easier to wrench on them myself

* No annual vehicle inspection (at least around here)

* Girls smile at them [and the riders]
(mebbe this shouldda been at the top of the list)

It's not all bike related talk unfortunately.  And I have yet to
encounter a protocol that is better than NNTP for discussions.  OK,
IRC is nice for real time chat.  But the web based forums that are
out?  No.  Not a chance in hell.  They may allow you to post pix or
other media (usually not more than just pix though).  But you can use
links on usenet.  Web forum software has no proper threading.  It has
an abysmal interface compared to GNUS.  Google Groups is also the
total suck.

I've a friend with a Cardinal. When we go for rides, I threaten to grab
the wheel and execute a Split-S .. and he cringes.  :-)

I'm not a pilot, but am a flying enthusiast. A few years ago I got a
ride in the front seat of an AT-6. During the ride (I was in control all
the time - instructor-pilot in rear seat), I executed a Split-S from
10,000 feet, but did a complete roll during the vertical downward part,
then finishing the Split-S around 2,000 feet or less. Around 3.5 G's on
the pullout as I recall.

Motorcycling is far less exciting than that!

At the beginning of my first real pilot's lesson (as opposed to flying
my friends' planes) the instructor told me to turn to the left, after
which he informed me that the plane was not rated for stunt flying :)

I have flown quite well during a high side.  Even spent enough time
aloft to reposition myself for a better landing.  The landing still
sucked!

I got hooked on bikes because I could afford a bike that was way
faster than any car I could buy.

I had some lessons way back in the late 50s, and was also lucky enough
to get rides in aerobatic-capable aircraft - and to take the stick.

Alas, college intervened, so I never pursued to completion.

It was unintentional.  I didn't pull the yoke back fast enough to
stall the plane.  When it did reach stall, the engine torqued it
over.  Recovery is supposed to be done within 50 feet.  I lost closer
to 500.
