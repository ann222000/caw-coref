I have a problem with a 20 gb laptoptravelstar harddisk. It fails to be
recognised in the BIOS also in other pc. Now it keeps ticking again and
again when starting and  the geometry data is not read.

I have 2 guestions:

1. IS the geometry of the disk stored in the disk that has become defective
causing this typical tick?

2. Is there some tool or method that I can use to rewrite this IDE data back
on the disk? Or is this done externally by cloning this disk somehow to
another same disk or procedure or how is this done?

The disk is not damaged by fall but just started ticking while in use.  I
used several tools from Hitachi like DFT and other tools but none of them
sees the harddrive... the drive still spins up and ticks...

Thanks...for practical tips (freezer didnt help)

Nope, the ticking is just the drive recalibrating when it cant read the platter.

Nothing to rewrite.

Nope.

Thats the most common way modern hard drives fail.

Then its passed its useby date.

Because it cant read the platter anymore.

If you need to get the data off the drive, you could try buying
another identical drive off ebay and swapping the logic card.
That can let you see the data. The two drives need to be
as identical as you can manage firmware version wise to
maximise the chance of success.

The thick is the sidk trying (and failing) to read. If is does not give
the geometry, that basically means it failed its power-on selftest and
refuses to wirk at all.

You misunderstand the problem. Such an utility would not help.

The disk is dead. If you really need the data, try professional
data recovery. BTW, the second worst thing you can do to a disk
is heat. Also disks fail sometimes without apparant reason.
