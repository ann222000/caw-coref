WASHINGTON: President Saddam Hussein had been gone from Iraq for just
a few weeks, and U.S. forces in Fallujah, west of Baghdad, already
were being called unwelcome invaders. One of the first big anti-
American protests of the war escalated into shootouts that left 18
Iraqis dead and 78 wounded.

It would be a familiar scene in Iraq's next few years: Crowds gather,
insurgents mingle with civilians. Troops open fire, and innocents die.

All the while, according to internal military correspondence obtained
by The Associated Press, U.S. commanders were telling Washington that
many civilian casualties could be avoided by using a new nonlethal
weapon developed over the past decade.

Military leaders repeatedly and urgently requested the device. It uses
energy beams instead of bullets and lets soldiers break up unruly
crowds without firing a shot.

It is a ray gun that neither kills nor maims, but the Pentagon has
refused to deploy it because of the possibility that the weapon might
be seen as a torture device.

Perched on a Humvee or a flatbed truck, the Active Denial System gives
people hit by the invisible beam the sense that their skin is on fire.
They move out of the way quickly and without injury.

On April 30, 2003, two days after the first Fallujah incident, Gene
McCall, then the top scientist at Air Force Space Command in Colorado,
typed out a two-sentence e-mail to Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

&quot;I am convinced that the tragedy at Fallujah would not have occurred
if an Active Denial System had been there,&quot; McCall told Myers,
according to the e-mail obtained by AP. The system should become &quot;an
immediate priority,&quot; McCall said.

Myers referred McCall's message to his staff, according to the e-mail
chain.

McCall, who retired from government in November 2003, remains
convinced the system would have saved lives in Iraq.

&quot;How this has been handled is kind of a national scandal,&quot; McCall said
by telephone from his home in Florida.

A few months after McCall's message, in August 2003, Richard Natonski,
a Marine Corps brigadier general who had just returned from Iraq,
filed an &quot;urgent&quot; request with officials in Washington for the energy-
beam device.

The device would minimize what Natonski described as the &quot;CNN Effect&quot;:
the instantaneous relay of images that depict U.S. troops as
aggressors.

A year later, Natonski, by then promoted to major general, again asked
for the system, saying a compact and mobile version was &quot;urgently
needed,&quot; particularly in urban settings.

Natonski, now a three-star general, is the Marine Corps' deputy
commandant for plans, policies and operations. He did not respond to
an interview request.

In October 2004, the commander of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force
&quot;enthusiastically&quot; endorsed Natonski's request. Lt. Gen. James Amos
said it was &quot;critical&quot; for Marines in Iraq to have the system.

Senior officers in Iraq have continued to make the case. One December
2006 request noted that as U.S. forces are drawn down, the nonlethal
weapon &quot;will provide excellent means for economy of force.&quot;

The main reason the tool has been missing in action is public
perception. With memories of the 2004 Abu Ghraib prison scandal still
fresh, the Pentagon is reluctant to give troops a space-age device
that could be misconstrued as a torture machine.

&quot;We want to just make sure that all the conditions are right, so when
it is able to be deployed the system performs as predicted - that
there isn't any negative fallout,&quot; said Col. Kirk Hymes, head of the
Defense Department's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate.

Reviews by military lawyers concluded it is a lawful weapon under
current rules governing the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan,
according to a Nov. 15 document prepared by Marine Corps officials in
western Iraq.

Private organizations remain concerned, however, because documentation
that supports the testing and legal reviews is classified. There's no
way to independently verify the Pentagon's claims, said Stephen Goose
of Human Rights Watch in Washington.

&quot;We think that any time you have an emerging technology that's based
on novel physical principles, that this deserves the highest level of
scrutiny,&quot; Goose said. &quot;And we really haven't had that.&quot;

Another issue for the weapon is cost.

The Pentagon has spent $62 million ( 45.5 million) developing and
testing the system over the past decade, a scant amount compared to
other high-profile, multibillion-dollar military programs.

Still, officials say the technology is too expensive, although they
will not say what it costs to build. They cite engineering challenges
as another obstacle, although one U.S. defense contractor says it has
a model ready for production.

For now, there is no firm schedule for when the system might be made
and delivered to troops.

Commanders in Iraq say the go-slow approach has had devastating
consequences.

There is no way to calculate how many civilian deaths could have been
avoided had the energy beam been available in Iraq. The bulk of the
civilian casualties are due to sectarian warfare.

According to Associated Press statistics, more than 27,400 Iraqi
civilians have been killed and more than 31,000 wounded in war-related
violence just since the new government took office in April 2005.

The Active Denial System is a directed-energy device, although it is
not a laser or a microwave. It uses a large, dish-shaped antenna and a
long, V-shaped arm to send an invisible beam of waves to a target as
far away as 500 yards.

With the unit mounted on the back of a vehicle, U.S. troops can
operate a safe distance from rocks, fire bombs and small-arms fire.

The beam penetrates the skin slightly, just enough to cause intense
pain. The beam goes through clothing as well as windows, but can be
blocked by thicker materials, such as metal or concrete.

The system was developed by the Air Force Research Laboratory in New
Mexico. During more than 12 years of testing, only two injuries
requiring medical attention have been reported; both were second-
degree burns, according to the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate
Web site.

Prototype units have been assembled by the military, the most
promising being a larger model that sits on the back of a flatbed
truck. This single unit, known as System 2, could be sent to Iraq as
early as next year, according to Hymes of the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons
Directorate.

Hymes' office, which nurtures promising technologies that can be used
by the military branches, plans to spend $9 million ( 6.6 million)
over the next two years on the effort.

Money for additional systems is not likely to be available until 2010,
when an Air Force command in Massachusetts is expected to take control
of the program, he said.

Recognizing the potential market, defense contractor Raytheon has
invested its own money to build a version that the company calls
&quot;Silent Guardian.&quot; Although Hymes said the Raytheon product &quot;is not
ready yet,&quot; company representatives say it is.

Mike Booen, Raytheon's vice president for directed energy programs,
said the company has produced one system that is available
immediately.

&quot;We have the capacity to build additional systems as needed,&quot; he said.

Raytheon has not sold any Silent Guardians to U.S. or foreign
customers, and Booen would not discuss the product's price.

American commanders in Iraq already have asked to buy Raytheon's
device.

A Dec. 1, 2006, urgent request signed by Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Robert
Neller sought eight Silent Guardians.

Neller, then the deputy commander of the 1st Marine Expeditionary
Force in Iraq, called the lack of such a nonlethal weapon a &quot;chronic
deficiency&quot; that &quot;will continue to harm&quot; efforts to resolve showdowns
with as little firepower as possible.

Other requests from officers in Iraq asked for the system as part of a
broader weapons package on wheels, one that could shoot bullets as
well as the nonlethal beam.

Such a versatile system would let troops deal with &quot;increasingly
complex operational environments where combatants are routinely
intermixed with noncombatants,&quot; Army Brig. Gen. James Huggins said in
an April 2005 memo to Pentagon officials.

Huggins, then chief of staff of the Multi-National Force in Iraq and
now deputy commander of the 3rd Infantry Division, wanted 14 vehicles
for missions ranging from raids to convoy escorts.

U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in Iraq from
its base in the United States, endorsed the request, saying it was
&quot;critical to build upon our success in the counterinsurgency battle,&quot;
according to its memo to the Pentagon.

The vehicles were not delivered, however. Robert Buhrkuhl, a senior
Pentagon acquisition official, said during congressional testimony in
January that combining the various fixtures on a single vehicle
presented major technical challenges.

In an interview, Franz Gayl, who was Neller's science adviser until
the unit returned in February, blamed an entrenched, &quot;risk-averse&quot;
military acquisition system for moving too slowly.

Gayl calls the system a &quot;disruptive innovation&quot;: an unconventional
piece of equipment that breaks new ground and therefore is viewed
skeptically by the offices that buy combat gear.

If the energy-beam weapon had been fielded when U.S. forces invaded
Iraq, &quot;many innocent Iraqi lives would have been spared,&quot; Gayl said.

Well a few could be avoided by the spending of a couple of the hundreds of
thousands of dollars wasted on this particular useless &quot;boy's toy&quot; to clean
up the water supply of the US allies currently dropping like flies from
Cholera.

So,  who got the big contract to build that new water purification plant and
the sewage farm?

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.
Barbeques on fire by the chalets past the castle headland
I watched the gift shops glitter in the darkness off the Newborough gate
All these moments will be lost in time,  like icecream on the beach
Time for tea.
