At the moment, there are many package tours for Albertans to go to Las vegas,
for shopping and so on.
These packages include air fare, hotels and often car rentals - all for
extremely good prices, especially for seniors.

Is there such packages for seniors to go to Seattle-Tacoma, for lots of
shopping, say with Horizon/Alaska Air, from edmonton or Calgary?

Washington State Tourism, there are lots of us willing to spend, spend, spend,
if you can organize the trips.

Why would you want a shopping package making you captive to the places
your tour operator takes you to?  Do your research on shopping in your
destination city. Check for easy to get to Outlet Centers or Malls. Get
a package air/land deal from Priceline, Hotels.com or whichever
discounter you wish to use.  Use a travel agent, sometimes they can
offer packages not available on the internet.

Do a little research on the things you want to buy.  Better bargains may
be available at places like Amazon.com, Overstock.com,  hsn.com, qvc.com
or shopping.com

The OP was asking about shopping in SEATTLE, not Las Vegas.

I don't know why you would want to do that.  But apparently enough
people want to do that to make it profitable for someone to offer this
package.

When prices in vegas are 30-40% cheaper than in Alberta, sensible shoppers
gladly go on shopping package tours to vegas!!

Until Canuck retailers stop swindling buyers, more and more Canadians will
shop where they are appreciated, and where they get more for their money.

How much could you possibly save flying to Vegas, taking taxis from the
airport, staying in a hotel, meals, etc.?  You can only bring a few
dozen pounds of luggage back, so it's not like you can buy a plasma TV
or something expensive and bring it home on the plane.  It's sounds like
an excuse to justify an unnecessary shopping spree.

It seems that Boyle has never had the pleasure of an excursion package to Lost
wages.

The hotels always include FREE shuttle from the airport to the hotels.
Meals are a bargain at the casino buffets - breakfast around $5 for all you
can eat, and lunch and supper around $9 for all you can eat.

Many hotels are now offering superb discounts for fantastic rooms, for a
fraction of that charged in most Canadian hotels.

As for duty free shopping, for 2 days one is allowed duty free $400 a person,
and $750 if out of Canada for a week.

With bargain prices in the USA, one can save a lot of money shopping there,
rather than in Canada. A plasma TV can be fitted into a large suitcase, by the
way.

With Christmas coming, and the C$=US$, might as well shop there, rather than
here.

Should be seeing good package tours shortly, from Seattle Torism, jointly with
Horizon/Alaska Air, and Washington State Tourism.
Perhaps some Canadian tour operator may even get involved?

Wow, that just reeks of cheapskate.  You probably feed your family from

Funny, last time I was there I had a really nice lobster and steak with
trimmings for $9.99.  Drinks (booze) were quite reasonable and the service
was great.  As was the scenery.  Some of those buffet's are actually quite
good.  I sure don't compare what I had to McDonalds.

Grosvomit isn't flying anywhere - he can't afford to. His wife holds all the cards,

For Grosvenor Relief, contact ab ... @shaw.ca, and include
full headers from his articles, most of which violate Shaw's
Acceptable Use Policy, which includes the following text:

=== Newsgroups

Messages posted to newsgroups must comply with the
written charters or Frequently Asked Questions (?FAQ?s?)
for those newsgroups. Advertisements, solicitations, or
other commercial messages may be posted only in those
newsgroups whose charters or FAQ?s explicitly permit
them. You are responsible for determining the policies
of a given newsgroup before posting to it.

(Grosvenor's articles are often off-topic and in
violation of the groups he routinely posts to.)

Posting or cross-posting the same or substantially
similar messages to more than 9 newsgroups is
prohibited. Our news software will automatically
cancel any messages posted to 9 or more newsgroups.

(Grosvenor often circumvents this restriction
by cross posting identical articles to several
batches of different newsgroups.)

Forging, altering or removing header information
is prohibited. This includes attempting
to circumvent the approval process for posting
to a moderated newsgroup.

(Grosvenor jumps from identity to identity in
the vain hope he won't be recognized. This
by necessity involves forging the &quot;From&quot;
data in the header.)

You may not flood or disrupt Usenet newsgroups.
Disruption is defined as posting a large number of
messages to a newsgroup which contain no
substantive content, to the extent that normal
discussion in the group is significantly hindered.
Examples of disruptive activities include, but
are not limited to: posting multiple messages
with no text in the body, posting many follow-ups
to messages with no new text.

(Grosvenor does this as a matter of routine,
particularly in the soc.culture groups.)

When I think of holidays and shopping the East Coast is the place to
be.  I would avoid New York City taxes are high.  However both the
Meadowlands in New Jersey and Jersey Gardens Mall in Elizabeth, NJ
feature bargains in outlet stores.  While I reside in NJ, I have seen
buses from NYC with tourists at both locations.   You might want to
rethink your plans viewing what New York City has to offer in holiday
lights, the Tree at 30 Rock, St. Patrick's as well as your shopping safari.

Seattle is on the WEST coast, which is of more interest, and lower travel
costs, than visiting the over-priced US East coast.

I understand the geographic and transport issues.  But if you know where
to shop on the East Coast savings can be very good.  Perhaps there is a
Steve &amp; Barry's in Seattle.  They feature mens and womens casual
sporting wear for $7.98 - $12. 98.  Their stuff holds up too.  I have
some jeans, shirts, and a starter jacket that have lasted more than 3
years.  At Bob's I got $100.00 Asics running shoes for $35.00. At
Marshall's, I got a $400 Tommy Hilfiger wool suit for $ 129.00. Of
these, I think Marshall's is nation wide.  So you might want to check
one out in Seattle.

It seems that Boyle has never had the pleasure of an excursion package to
Lost Wages.

The hotels always include FREE shuttle from the airport to the hotels.
Meals are a bargain at the casino buffets - breakfast around $5 for all you
can eat, and lunch and supper around $9 for all you can eat.

Many hotels are now offering superb discounts for fantastic rooms, for a
fraction of that charged in most Canadian hotels.

As for duty free shopping, for 2 days one is allowed duty free $400 a person,
and $750 if out of Canada for a week.

With bargain prices in the USA, one can save a lot of money shopping there,
rather than in Canada. A plasma TV can be fitted into a large suitcase, by the
way.

With Christmas coming, and the C$=US$, might as well shop there, rather than
here.

Should be seeing good package tours shortly, from Seattle Tourism, jointly
with Horizon/Alaska Air, and Washington State Tourism.
Perhaps some Canadian tour operator may even get involved?

&gt;How much could you possibly save flying to Vegas, taking taxis from the
&gt;airport, staying in a hotel, meals, etc.?  You can only bring a few
&gt;dozen pounds of luggage back, so it's not like you can buy a plasma TV
&gt;or something expensive and bring it home on the plane.  It's sounds like
&gt;an excuse to justify an unnecessary shopping spree.
