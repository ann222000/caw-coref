On the way to Emiquon last Wednesday morning, I drove past Rick Lake
SFWA, and in the flooded field north of Duck Creek there were about
six Great Blue Herons, several Blue-winged Teal, and some Coots.

In a field across the highway from Banner Marsh a Wild Turkey tom was
grazing in the grass.

At Emiquon, I spent a couple of hours exploring the ridge on the
Northwest side of the preserve. A Northern Harrier was soaring over
the fields and bluffs as I arrived. As soon as I got out of my car I
found two bluebirds squabling with a couple of Tree Swallows over one
of the nest boxes.  The Bluebirds appear to have won the squabble, as
they were sitting on the box when I left to walk the ridge.  I
encountered several more Bluebird and Tree Swallow couples along the
way, and could hear the song of what turned out to be Field Sparrows,
spaced 10 or 20 feet apart, singing their territory songs.  But the
most exciting to me was hearing a strange (to me) song that made me
look until I spotted the singer at the top of a tree. It was a Brown
Thrasher. I had never heard one singing like that before! I usually
see them as they are darting into the brush to hide from me, so this
was exciting.

The Pelicans were out in the field near the Pumphouse road.  The field
was dry enough, so I walked out to the edge of the water in the center
of the field to get some better photographs of the Pelicans, who were
totally not concerned with me as they rested and milled around by a
large pool of water in the center of the field north of the Pumphouse
road.

I'm posting photos from Emiquon on a separte blog, as I intend to
spend a lot of time there watching is transformation. They have
started planting trees, marsh and prairie plants.  The entire
landscape will be changing. Here is a link to that blog:

Location: Chautauqua National Wildlife Refuge, Mason County

After birding at Emiquon, I had lunch in Havana and then drove home on
the east side of the river, passing through the Chautauqua refuge to
see if I could find the Cattle Egret reported there a few days
earlier. And Yes I found it!!! However, when I returned on Saturday
hoping to show the Egret to my friend, we could not find it.
