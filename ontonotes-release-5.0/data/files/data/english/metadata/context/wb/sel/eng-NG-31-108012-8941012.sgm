Hello All,

I am fixing a german casserole called Graupeneintopf (pg. 79 of &quot;The
German Cookbook&quot; for those of you who have it) this evening.  It calls
for baking 2 pounds of ground lamb, 2 cups of uncooked pearl barley,
and 4 cups of beef broth for 1 hour and 20 minutes at 325 degrees.
Now, my problem is that the only barley I was able to procure is quick
barley, which the box instructions says to boil for 10-12 minutes.
So, I am looking for advice on how to adjust the recipe to compensate
for the different type of barley.

As is, I am thinking of halving the baking time to 40 minutes, but
that is pretty much just guessing on my part.  Or, I could just boil
the barley in the beef stock for the alloted 10-12 minutes and add it
to the casserole at the end, but I'd prefer to bake it all together so
that the flavors can meld together.  Any advice would be much
appreciated, and I'll post back afterwards to let everyone know how it
turned out.

Kind regards to all.

Have you tried places besides the big box mart? Around here only the
smaller stores have pearl barley.

The instant barley will be goo at the normal cook time. The only thing I
can think of would be to add the instant barley towards the end.

My idea is to add the barley about 20 minutes before the end of cooking.

I don't like Quick Barley. It ends up like oatmeal. I nall of the
stores here (even the &quot;big box stores&quot;) have pearl barley. It is
always by the dried beans, lentils, etc. I love barley.
