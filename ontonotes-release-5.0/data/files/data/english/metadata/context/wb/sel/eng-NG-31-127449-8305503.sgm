I am planning a month-long driving trip and am wondering if I should
drive my own car or rent?  If I rent I want a convertible which will
cost $1300.  However, if I drive my own car I can use that $1300 and
put it into my own car and make it good as new or else save it in case
of a mechanical problem along the way.  What would you do?  My care is
already nearly as good as a new car even if it is 12 years old.  I
don't even know where I would put the $1300.

So I'm not sure I understand...you have a perfectly good car but too
much money and need to get rid of $1300?

If he had a new car, he might drive so many miles onto it that it
depreciated more than $1300. I can't believe that the cost to rent a car
would be less than whatever the depreciation was. A car that is 12 years
old is valued more on its condition than anything else, so driving it
would just make little difference unless it were to break down. Of
course it would probably do that anyway just a little later if he didn't
drive it on the long trip. So if it's a trustworthy car, I don't see why
he shouldn't take it:

1) What if it breaks down thousands of miles from home and he can't get
it fixed and can't get around and can't get it back home and there's no
one to fix it and there's no parts to fix it in the little pissant town
for two weeks?
2) A rental breakdown should just mean they give him another car.
3) If he gets tired and wants to fly home, he can just leave the rental.

There's probably more.

A month long driving trip in a 12 year old car is always a risky
adventure no matter how good you think your car is.  If you are not
sure about where to invest the $1300 in your old car, then just start
driving on the trip and you will find out.  By the way, what is the
make of the car, and how many miles are on your
good-as-new-but-old-car?

I am confident that AAA can handle anythign if I break down and I
don't have any issues with fixing the car.  But there are a lot of
plusses to renting.  I am just wonderign if it is worth $1300 to do so
or if $1300 is better spent on my car.

I have just over 90k miles on a 1995 Miata.  All replacement parts
have been OEM or better and oil has been changed at every 3000 miles
or sooner and tuneups every 15 to 20k miles.  I have lifetime
guaranteed sparkplugs and gold ignition wires put on and the engine is
near mint condition.  Like I said, it really is in near new consition
and is a joy to drive.  This trip would put anout 20k+ miles on it,

Take the Miata; you'll regret it if you don't.  90K is just getting
warmed up!  If something breaks, it's easy to fix and you'll have the
money to do it.  If nothing breaks, that's $1300 in your pocket to
spend as you see fit...maybe on a new softtop as a reward for your
faithful steed!

I just replaced the brake pads like two weeks ago - even though this
trip is in March or April, so I might replace them again.  I can get
the pads cheaply enough on Ebay.  I might go ahead and get new tires
also, even though the tires on now are also about a month old.  And if
I do take the car I will run it through my mechanic and make sure
eveythign is in tip top shape.  I am still wondering if it is worth
putting 20k+ miles on the car itself to save $1300.  Along the way it
will need like 7-8 oil changes and at least one more tune up.  I am
also putting on a new muffler this weekend.  Also, i am thinking that
if I take my own car I can extend the trip if I need to without
worrying too much about extending the rental agreement.  Also, if I
take my own car I will have to up the insurance to comprehensive
coverage at least for that month.

I am plannign to make the trip from friend with a bed to friend with a
bed and stopping along the way where I think is interesting.  If
anyone wants to put me up along the way in your town that would be
cool also.  :)  So far, I have Orlando, Atlanta, NYC, Houston and San
Diego as points to shoot for.

Drive your Miata.  It will be fun.  What kind of convertible were you
looking at renting?  I had a rental Mustang convertible once and it
was a pig to drive.

But then I'm trying to figure out why the hell our CEO sold his Miata
and bought a Corvette.  Ugh.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;don't even know where I would put the $1300.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A month long driving trip in a 12 year old car is always a risky
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; adventure no matter how good you think your car is.  If you are not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sure about where to invest the $1300 in your old car, then just start
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; driving on the trip and you will find out.  By the way, what is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; make of the car, and how many miles are on your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; good-as-new-but-old-car?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have just over 90k miles on a 1995 Miata.  All replacement parts
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;have been OEM or better and oil has been changed at every 3000 miles
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;or sooner and tuneups every 15 to 20k miles.  I have lifetime
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;guaranteed sparkplugs and gold ignition wires put on and the engine is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;near mint condition.  Like I said, it really is in near new consition
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and is a joy to drive.  This trip would put anout 20k+ miles on it,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;though.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If you decide to take your car, before you start out check for unusual
&gt; &gt; &gt; tire wear, the belts, radiator hoses, and the percentage of brake pads
&gt; &gt; &gt; left.

&gt; &gt; I just replaced the brake pads like two weeks ago - even though this
&gt; &gt; trip is in March or April, so I might replace them again.  I can get
&gt; &gt; the pads cheaply enough on Ebay.  I might go ahead and get new tires
&gt; &gt; also, even though the tires on now are also about a month old.  And if
&gt; &gt; I do take the car I will run it through my mechanic and make sure
&gt; &gt; eveythign is in tip top shape.  I am still wondering if it is worth
&gt; &gt; putting 20k+ miles on the car itself to save $1300.  Along the way it
&gt; &gt; will need like 7-8 oil changes and at least one more tune up.  I am
&gt; &gt; also putting on a new muffler this weekend.  Also, i am thinking that
&gt; &gt; if I take my own car I can extend the trip if I need to without
&gt; &gt; worrying too much about extending the rental agreement.  Also, if I
&gt; &gt; take my own car I will have to up the insurance to comprehensive
&gt; &gt; coverage at least for that month.

&gt; &gt; I am plannign to make the trip from friend with a bed to friend with a

What does it cost per mile to drive your car exclusive of fuel. If
it's like 10 cents per mile, it will cost you $2000 to drive your car.
If it's 5 cents, then it will cost $1000.

There is an added  value that if the rental car breaks down, or you
get into an accident, you call the rental car company, and they bring
you a new car.

If you drive your cars into the ground (like I tend to do) that 20,000
miles on your car might shorten it's life for you by one or two years.

YMMV

Well, as I see it there are three factors to how much this'll cost you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and it might have cost me $3000 in repairs in upkeep.

That's two, and the third is its earlier death and purchase of a new
car.

15k miles in 5 years makes around 3k/year, so 20k miles extra represents
6-7 years off the lifespan of the car.  Estimate how much you'd spend on
a new car (in 2007 dollars), and how much you can earn on that money in
6-7 years.  That's the other.

(I'm assuming a new car runs through consumables at about the same
rate.)

Ditto, on everything. I'll add:

I forgot we were talking about a Miata. Of course you should take the
Miata--nothing else will be as fun to drive, the car is notoriously
reliable, and the car isn't going to depreciate much at this point. I
wouldn't hesitate to take my own '95 Miata on a trip like that and I've got

Also, that rental pricing seems awfully cheap...I'd double-check it. You're

&gt; &gt; warmed up!  If something breaks, it's easy to fix and you'll have the
&gt; &gt; money to do it.  If nothing breaks, that's $1300 in your pocket to
&gt; &gt; spend as you see fit...maybe on a new softtop as a reward for your
&gt; &gt; faithful steed!

&gt; &gt; Jeannie
&gt; &gt; and &quot;Wendy&quot; the white '90 Miata - 199,620 (s)miles

&gt; &gt; P.S.  Gold ignition wires??

&gt; Ditto, on everything. I'll add:

&gt; I forgot we were talking about a Miata. Of course you should take the
&gt; Miata--nothing else will be as fun to drive, the car is notoriously
&gt; reliable, and the car isn't going to depreciate much at this point. I
&gt; wouldn't hesitate to take my own '95 Miata on a trip like that and I've got
&gt; 20k more miles than you.

&gt; Also, that rental pricing seems awfully cheap...I'd double-check it. You're
&gt; going to put 20k miles on the car in a month and you're looking at $1300
&gt; out-the-door?
">

I thought the rental pricing seemed very cheap, especially for a
convertible, and especially for the number of miles planned to put on
it.

The last car I rented cost me right around $250 for a full-size American
sedan.  They charged me the 'weekly rental rate', unlimited mileage.

Based on those numbers, I don't see $1300 for a month's rental in a
convertible to be too far off the mark.

I just ran the numbers at Enterprise for a 30-day rental.  Luxury and
Premium weren't available, but the most expensive of the remaining
was a sport utility.  Enterprise quoted $1123.75 USD.  Unlimited
miles in the continental US.

&gt; The last car I rented cost me right around $250 for a full-size American

&gt; Based on those numbers, I don't see $1300 for a month's rental in a
&gt; convertible to be too far off the mark.

&gt; I just ran the numbers at Enterprise for a 30-day rental.  Luxury and
&gt; Premium weren't available, but the most expensive of the remaining
&gt; was a sport utility.  Enterprise quoted $1123.75 USD.  Unlimited
&gt; miles in the continental US.

I guess my next question (and I'm not remembering) is mdginzo really
expecting to put 20k in mileage in a month? I put 5,000 on a 1972 VW
Bug in three weeks, doing a wide swing south from Oregon into Texas
and back up to Maryland, stopping at a multitude of national parks. I
mean, I'm certain he CAN put 20,000 miles on a car in 31 days, but why
would he want to if the point of the trip is to actually see something
besides interstates? And if he realistically won't be putting that
mileage on the car, then that changes the rental v. wear and tear
equation.

Enterprise must differ with their rules, because they would not rent a
car to me to drive further than one state over. Eg, I could drive to
Nevada or Oregon or Arizona, but not New Mexico, Washington, or
Colorado. Which sucked, because I wanted to drive to Colorado.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; changed at every 3000 miles or sooner and tuneups every 15
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to 20k miles.  I have lifetime guaranteed sparkplugs and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; gold ignition wires put on and the engine is near mint

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Take the Miata; you'll regret it if you don't.  90K is just
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; getting warmed up!  If something breaks, it's easy to fix
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and you'll have the money to do it.  If nothing breaks,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that's $1300 in your pocket to spend as you see fit...maybe
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on a new softtop as a reward for your faithful steed!

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; P.S.  Gold ignition wires??

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If I were in your shoes (car), I would take the Miata and not
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; even consider renting. Of course, my experience is based on
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the crappy condition of those cars that I have rented over
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the years. None of them were in as good a condition as my
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; own.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt; &gt;&gt; That's how it's leaning for me at this point.  I drove a car in
&gt; &gt;&gt; poorer condition once from Miami to NYC and back with no
&gt; &gt;&gt; problem.

&gt; &gt; I drove a '68 VW Beetle from California to Oregon to Montana to
&gt; &gt; Washington DC to Oregon and back to California between 1989 and
&gt; &gt; 1992.

&gt; If you'd had a more reliable car it wouldn't have taken three
&gt; years.
">

On the last cross-country trip, I put about $500 into the front end
and brakes (in 1992 dollars.) This did not stop us from having a
nearly fatal case of vapor-lock 17 miles outside of Gillette, Wyoming,
but compared to the '72 Bug (photos cross-country of car in various
garages being repaired), the current one is basically trouble-free.

The part that's weird is the idea of doing 20K miles in a month.
20,000/31 = 645.  Even if you could average as much as 60 mph that'd
still be more than 10 hours per day.

As someone who has criss-crossed the country automobily numerous
times, that's still a huge amount of driving:sightseeing.

Well, maybe a Miatam, from the sound of things.  And my Sienna has
withstood me pretty well so far, but at 181K miles I've begun to think
twice about putting it in stressful situations far from conveniences.
It may do another desert trip before 200K, but not in mid-summer or
mid-winter, and trips to the mountain will be limited to those just
outside LA.   Tahoe and even Mammoth are a little too many casts of
the dice for this vehicle.

And man Big Three cars don't make it much past 90K without a lot of
help -- engine rebuilds could be expected at any moment.

Some Euro cars wouldn't go on this trip, either.  My Saab ran like a
champ until around 120K, and then the engine needed a rebuild, and I
was getting ready to do a transmission transplant, and smog tests
would have had the rebuilt engine getting a major overhaul.  Somewhere
in there, I had to replace an A-strut, which would have been
inconvenient in the back woods.

The Bug I had back when was looking worn at about 150K, but wasn't too
bad mechanically after I replaced the aftermarket muffler and carb
with stock items.  It was leaking oil when I said goodbye, but I might
still have done an Ore-Wash-BC trip in it.  On the other hand, I could
change the belt by myself, so I was a little more hands-on with that
vehicle.

Anyway, I hope mdginzo enjoys the trip, and doesn't do anything that
will get into the newspapers.

My 99 S-10 turned 145,000 last week, and the only thing I've had to do
to it besides tires and oil changes is a fuel pump. I think I have a
tiny leak in the radiator, though, probably have to look at that one of

You're asking us which option would leave you a larger margin of
safety but you're leaving the spare tire at home?  At least take one
of those cans of goop that semi-seals a slow leak and sorta reinflates
the tire.  I've used something like that twice, and in one case, the
tire remained &quot;fixed&quot; for the remaining lifespan of the vehicle.  In
the other case, I had the tire fixed properly a half hour later.

When I was shopping for gas-miser cars over the winter, one of the
candidate cars had no spare -- the remaining trunk was smaller than
the tire.  I guess that means that the spare is not mandatory.  Do any
production cars other than the Smart leave out the spare?

All modern cars have two independent braking systems.  Three if you

OK, Shawn or Bill or whoever I'm arguing with in that other thread.  I
surrender.  By avoiding American built cars, I haven't run into those

My Ontario-built econobox (Suzuki design) has 180K Km on it (well over

Makes renting rather less desirable if you live near the border, and the
