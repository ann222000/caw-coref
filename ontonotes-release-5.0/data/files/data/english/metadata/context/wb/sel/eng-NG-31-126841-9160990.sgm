Where Does the Right-Wing End and the  Media Begin?

I had the opportunity to sit down this week with one of America's top
economists, Paul Krugman, who of course doubles as an influential op-ed  columnist
for the New York Times. It's more than a bit surprising  when the guy from the
New York Times sounds more radical than  anyone else in the room, but Krugman
and his twice-weekly column have been  more consistently surprising and
radically different than anything else  allowed to appear in the Times (or indeed
anywhere else in the  so-called &quot;mainstream media&quot;) for so long that even
Krugman himself no  longer seems surprised by the force of his own outrage.
He certainly pulled no punches during our conversation, stating in a
forthright manner his opinions on such controversial topics as truth and  lies in the
newsroom (&quot;The Big Lies are all on the right&quot;), media bias (&quot;A  large part of
it is in fact right-wing bias, because they are effectively  part of the
right wing&quot;) and corporate pressure (&quot;It's very clear that  when the parent
companies of the major news sources have issues at stake  before the federal
government ... this definitely influences the  coverage.) Perhaps the fact that he's
a tenured professor at Princeton --  and not a professional journalist still
on the make -- has freed Krugman  to speak truth to naked emperors and Times
readers on a biweekly  basis.
We spoke at the beginning of a national publicity tour for Krugman's  latest
book, The Conscience of a Liberal, which ranges over the  history of the past
century to explain what went wrong in America -- and  then attempts to point
the way to a &quot;new New Deal.&quot; Part of what went  wrong with America, of course,
was the role played in our democracy by the  mass media, as Krugman recognized
and parsed in one chapter in his book  entitled &quot;Weapons of Mass
Distraction.&quot;
***
Rory O' Connor: You speak in your book about &quot;movement  conservatism,&quot; which
you call a &quot;radical new force in American politics  that took over the
Republican Party.&quot; What role if any do the media play  in movement conservatism?
Paul Krugman: The media are a very important force in it. They  shape
perceptions, and they conceal issues. Look at the 2000 presidential  campaign, for
example, where the media were so heavily biased against Al  Gore. That's what
brought Bush to within a Supreme Court decision of the  White House. So if you
look at, certainly these last seven years, the role  of the media in not
telling you reasons why you should be skeptical about  the course of the war, for
example, it's enormously important.
We have a situation right now in which there are several major  parts of the
news media that are for all practical purposes part of  &quot;movement
conservatism&quot; -- Fox News, the New York Post, the  Washington Times -- and in which other
news organizations are  intimidated, at least to some extent. I sometimes talk
about what I call  &quot;asymmetrical intimidation.&quot; If you say a true but
unflattering  thing about Bush or in fact about any other prominent conservative, oh,
boy! People are going to go after you. I mean, I've got people working
full-time going after me, right? But if you say a false,  unflattering thing about
a Democrat or a progressive, no risk ... And that  shapes coverage, no
question about it. It's better now, but it's still  very asymmetric. The other thing
we should mention about the media is  their addiction to the trivial. We've
got the most substantive election  coming up, I think, ever. We've got clear
differences on policies  between parties. And what are we seeing news stories
about? John Edwards'  hair and Hillary Clinton's laugh ... this is horrifying!
And again -- it's  asymmetric. I can think of lots of unflattering things to
say about any of  the Republican candidates -- Mitt Romney's saying his sons are
serving the  country by helping him get elected! -- but it doesn't get nearly
as much  play in the media.
ROC: It sounds like you're saying there's a bias in the media.  If you are,
what is the bias?
PK: The media's bias, a large part of it is in fact right-wing  bias, because
they are effectively part of the right wing. Fox News ...  there's nothing
like Fox News on other television networks that you can  look at. There is no
liberal equivalent of Fox News, there is no network  that, if a conservative got
the Nobel Peace Prize, would have responded  the way Fox News did to Al
Gore's Peace Prize, by first saying nothing at  all, then when they figured out the
line, talking about how fat he is ...  So there's no correspondence there.
Beyond that, there's two things at least; first, the hatred of  substance --
they really want to talk about all that trivia -- and there's  also the fetish
of evenhandedness. If one candidate says something that's  completely false,
and the other something that's true, the media will say,  &quot;Some people believe
what that guy said was false, and some people say it  was true.&quot; Way back in
the 2000 campaign, I wrote a piece in which I said  that if Bush said the
earth was flat, the headline would read: &quot;Opinions  Differ on Shape of the
Planet.&quot; I was thinking specifically about what  Bush was saying about taxes and
Social Security, which were just out and  out lies! But no one would say that, and
they still won't. It's better  now, a little, but they still won't say it,
and that tends -- I imagine in  some future environment that might work to the
advantage of some dishonest  candidates on the left -- but the fact of the
matter is the Big Lies are  all on the right right now. So it works much more to
their advantage.
ROC: Do you think it's possible that economics is driving  politics in the
media?
PK: The role of economics in driving the media is an interesting  one. One
question is simply, &quot;Do they respond to what sells?&quot; And to some  extent the
focus on the trivial is there due to that. And also, by the  way, talking heads
screaming at each other is a lot cheaper than actually  having reporters out in
the field doing reporting, so that's one reason  why you get that.
I guess the question that you want to ask is, &quot;To what extent is news
coverage biased by the corporate interest of the parents?&quot; And that's hard  to pin
down in any direct way, but one of the interesting things that you  notice
right now is the remarkable reluctance of some of the networks to  follow what the
viewer ship numbers seem to be saying. I mean, look at  Olbermann's show
versus anything else at MSNBC, for example. Why aren't  there more programs like
that? Why is CNN still trying to be Fox Lite,  when you clearly can't outfox
Fox and there clearly seems to be a bigger  market opportunity on the other
side? And you really do start to think  that -- there probably aren't, at networks
other than Fox, there probably  aren't memos saying here is how we are going
to slant the news today -- at  Fox there are, every day. But there's probably
this general sort of  pressure to go for the views that won't upset the CEO of
the firm that  controls the network that has a lot of business interests that
are best  served by one side or the other ... so yes, this is a problem.
ROC: So deregulation, consolidation and corporate issues like  that might
affect news coverage?
PK: Oh sure. It's very clear that when the parent companies of  the major
news sources have issues at stake before the federal government  -- and if one
party controls the White House and both houses of Congress,  and has made it
very clear that it keeps lists and remembers who its  friend and not-so-friend
are -- this definitely influences the  coverage. A lot of people I talk to in
the media say that they have  received pressure in ways that only seem to make
sense if you think that  at some level management -- not the guys that think
about audience shares  but the guys who think about broader concerns -- are
taking into account  the political liabilities. Which is one reason why it is
remarkable,  although it's still not what I want, that the news coverage has
gotten a  whole lot better -- funny, no? -- after the polls really turned the other
way.
ROC: In your book, you talk about the media's use of  &quot;storylines&quot; and what
you've called the &quot;Rambofication of history.&quot;
PK: Yes, I'm rather proud of the term &quot;Rambofication.&quot; In the  years
immediately following Vietnam, all of this stuff that now seems so  much a part of the
story -- that we lost the war because we were stabbed  in the back, that the
&quot;weak&quot; politicians, the Democrats, can't be trusted  on national security --
wasn't very much out there. I actually went back  and looked at a lot of
polling and what people had to say at the time. In  1977, people still remembered
what Vietnam had actually been like, and why  we needed to get the heck out of
there.
It wasn't really until the 1980s that the history began to be  re-invented,
so if only we'd let Sylvester Stallone flex his muscles, we  could have gone
back and won the war. The idea of Democrats as &quot;weak&quot; on  national security
really got invented then -- and you know there were a  couple of events that
played into that, such as the collapse of the Soviet  Union, which I really don't
think had much to do with Reagan, but helped  make the storyline. So when 9/11
came along, the realities of 9/11 were  that the Clinton people had been
working pretty hard to try to so  something about Bin Laden, and the Bushies said
as soon as they came in,  &quot;We're not interested, we want to think about a war
with China.&quot; But the  storyline that the media fell into was that, &quot;We're the
tough guys, the  other guys neglected it.&quot; And that gave them a good run --
they won two  elections, in '02 and '04, which I think otherwise they would have
lost --  by playing on this notion of &quot;We're strong, and they're weak.&quot; I
guess the  sort of good news is that they have done such an incredibly  terrible
job at all of that that we may have at least a while before all  that scare
tactic stuff comes back.
ROC: Or we may hear in four years how the Democrats &quot;lost  Iraq.&quot;
PK: I'm worried, obviously. Clearly, if it's a Democrat who  withdraws from
Iraq, which it appears likely it will be, then it will be  more of the, &quot;We
were winning, we were on the edge of victory, then they  stabbed us in the back
...&quot;
ROC: &quot;They spit on our soldiers ...&quot;
PK: Yeah, that's amazing, the &quot;spitting on our soldiers&quot; thing  -- because it
never happened, there are no documented cases -- but it  became part of the
storyline. Will that happen again? Certainly they'll do  their damnedest to
make it happen ...
I guess I'm more optimistic about the American public, that it will  take a
lot more than four years, for us to see that again, because it took  more than
four years after Vietnam, and right now the American public has  a pretty good
sense of just what a disaster that's all been ... I think  people have made
up their minds that this is a disaster. Maybe 10 years  from now, they'll have
forgotten and be willing to, you know, see movies  in which some heroic guy
goes back and wins the Iraq war but ... not for a  while anyway.
ROC: Well, I'm more of a Mencken disciple when it comes to the  American
public, but I hope you're right.
PK: I hope I'm right too!
