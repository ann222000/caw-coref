To all criminals against GPS,

Have you noticed Poor St Hilaire?  It seems that he is misunderstood
by most CN navigators, even the authors of CN books.  Of the more than
20 authors I've read, I think none has it correct.  Now recent
postings on the List have reminded me of the St. Hilaire discussion in
my recent book, &quot;Celestial Navigation in the GPS Age.&quot;

It goes back to Capt. Marcq himself.  In my English translation of his
1873 publication, he refers to the &quot;estimated position&quot; when
explaining his intercept method.  This unfortunate terminology has
guided many CN students to a Sea of Mystery engulfing the DR position
and the confusing concept of &quot;assumed position&quot;.

The confusion even dates back to Sumner.  I'm sure most List members
are familiar with his 1837 calculation of a points on the ship's LOP
by calculating its longitudes from its stipulated latitudes. Sumner
called these &quot;assumed&quot; latitudes.  At first he thought he was using
unreliable latitudes.  But after plotting three such &quot;trial&quot;
positions, he had an epiphanic realization that his calculations
actually gave exact locations of points on his celestial LOP.  Two
such calculations give two exact points on the LOP.  The straight line
connecting these two points has an error between the points that
depends on several factors, such as the LOP's curvature and the
chart's projection.

Hilaire's intercept method invites further confusion.  First, we
observe that the altitude observation and the knowledge of the body's
GP completely determines the celestial LOP.  Therefore no sight
reduction method uses estimations or assumptions.  Again, it's the
terminology that screws up the concepts.

There are several ways to determine the exact LOP by directly
computing and plotting latitudes and longitudes of as many points as
we wish (Sumner's being one such method).  But St. Hilaire is
different -- it doesn't compute Lats and Lons at all.  Rather, it
specifies a point's latitude and longitude which I'll call the
reference point, RP, even though conventionally it's called the
&quot;assumed&quot; position -- a misnomer.  St. Hilaire calculates the great-
circle distance and azimuth from this RP to the nearest point on the
LOP.  This point is exactly on the LOP; let's call it the St. Hilaire
point (SHP).  Both the great-circle distance and the azimuth to the
SHP are exact.  No errors.  Even if we use inspection tables (such as
HO 214, 249, or 229) with their whole-degree limitation, the SHP is
located exactly on the LOP within the table's accuracy.  (HO 229
states a max altitude error of 0.3'; and for altitudes less than 86
degrees, the max azimuth error is 0.2'.)  If we use a $12 calculator
we get 10-digit accuracy.

However, unlike the Sumner method that calculates Lats and Lons
directly, the St Hilaire method produces errors when the LOP is
plotted.  On a gnomonic chart the intercept distance is correct, but
the azimuth is in error.  On a Mercator chart it's the reverse.  This
statement is true no matter what RP is used, using whole degrees of
latitude and LHA with inspection tables, or not.

In common practice at sea, we use a Mercator projection where the
intercept's azimuth is correct and its intercept distance has
negligible error when approximated by a rhumb line (error less than
0.3 nm for a 300 nm intercept, unless in polar latitudes).  Therefore,
in practical terms, several SHPs can be calculated with inspection
tables (or other means), tracing out the LOP exactly.  This method
uses no iterations, no estimations, and no assumptions.

However as List members know, these multiple SHPs are seldom
calculated because drawing a straight line through the SHP
perpendicular to the azimuth is usually an acceptable approximation to
the curved LOP at altitudes below about 75 degrees.  If the LOP's
curvature deviates unacceptably from the straight-line approximation,
another (or even a different) calculation can be made.  But in any
case, with an 75 degree observed altitude, a point along the straight-
line LOP 40 nm from the SHP is offset from the true curved LOP by 0.9
nm.  So at lower altitudes, the whole-degree limitation of inspection
tables would never contribute significant error.

My book also discusses why the St. Hilaire method is superior to other
methods even though (1) it requires exactly the same amount of
calculation as other methods, (2) it doesn't give latitudes &amp;
longitudes directly, (3) it has plotting inconveniences, and (4) it's
only approximate.  I'm new to the NavList; so I apologize if members
find this all verbose,  irrelevant, or old hat.

John Karl has posted a thoughtful message about St Hilaire. I for one, have
no objection to him delving into such matters in serious detail. But I have
difficulties which much of what he has said.

I'm a bit puzzled when he writes-

In my English translation of his
| 1873 publication...

When he says &quot;my&quot; translation, does that imply that he has translated it? Or
is it John referring to his copy of  a translation, perhaps the one by
Michel Vanvaerenbergh, in the book he wrote with Peter Ifland, &quot;Line of
Position Navigation&quot;.

John goes on to say-

| Hilaire's intercept method invites further confusion.  First, we
| observe that the altitude observation and the knowledge of the body's
| GP completely determines the celestial LOP.

No disagreement about that...  But he continues-

I don't understand why that follows. There are all sorts of sight reduction
methods making all sorts of estimations and assumptions.

That's exactly what his 1873 paper, &quot;Note sur la determination du point&quot;, IS
doing! In section VI, he assumes a nunber of different lats (or longs), and
deduces the corresponding longs (or lats), using the formulae in section
VII. If there are enough such points, he can draw an exact curve through
them. If there are only two, he can draw a chord between them. And if
there's only one point, obtained by using his estimated lat (or estimated
long) he can work out, using the formulae in section VII, the corresponding
long (or lat) and the azimuth, the position line being taken as the line
through that position at right angles to that azimuth. And the precision of
that approach depends on how good is his initial estimate, for one of those
coordinates.

It's rather strange: John and I seem to be referring to different papers
here. I just can't find any of that in the 1873 paper I have referred to.
Perhaps John could give section and page numbers. If he is working from the
same translation as I have, it follows the original pagination.

Actually, I do mean accuracy.  Here I'm talking about the accuracy of
calculators compared to inspection tables.  HO 229 states that its max
error in computed altitude is 0.3', and for altitudes below 86
degrees, a max error of 0.3' in computed azimuth.

I've always assumed that my 10-digit TI-30 has 10-digit accuracy,
which checks out where I can check it easily, such as in
Log[sqr(2PI)].  I assume the same for trig functions.  Now the
equations for altitude and azimuth use so few arithmetic operations
that not more than one, or two, places could be lost.  So I'm
reasoning that the calculator altitudes and azimuths are accurate to
eight or nine places.  In any case, it's sufficiently more accurate
than the claimed accuracy of inspection tables that the calculator
results can be considered exact.

I'm speaking of a priori estimations and assumptions, such as the
&quot;assumed position&quot;, which, in fact, is not an assumption at all.
Rather it simply specifies a region of interest where the navigator
wishes to compute a point on the celestial LOP. This point on the LOP
is computed exactly, with no estimations, no assumptions.  He can
compute as many of these points as he wishes.  But if instead he
decides to draw a straight line tangent to the LOP at this point, he's
making an approximation for computational convenience (with known
errors, in fact).  OK, we can also call that approximation an
estimation, but that's in a different sense; it's not a required
estimation of some quantity peculiar to that sight.  So maybe I
shouldn't attempt to use &quot;estimation&quot; in too different senses; but in
any case, there are no assumptions in the process.

Because the LOP is determined exactly from the observed altitude and
the body's GP, no assumptions are necessary for any sight reduction.
And I known of none that makes assumptions.  Approximations, yes.

I'm sorry. I used the shorten &quot;St. Hilaire&quot; for the St. Hilaire
intercept method.  It does not compute lats and Longs, but determines
them graphically from the computed intercept distance and azimuth.

The method George describes above of specifying a latitude and
computing the corresponding longitude is not the St. Hilaire intercept
method.  This method does (obviously) compute the lat and lon of a
point on the LOP.  Now here's the confusion wrought by terminology:
The terminology traps George (and many others) into thinking that the
&quot;estimated&quot; latitude generates an approximation whose error depends on
how good the estimate is.  Not so.  The point's location is exactly on
the LOP, no matter what initial latitude is specified (providing
there's a solution at all).  When it comes to approximating the LOP
with a straight line, the error depends only on the curvature of the
true LOP relative to the distance along the straight-line LOP.  The
error does not depend on the initial latitude.

So it seems to me that it would be better to call this &quot;estimated&quot;
latitude something else, maybe a specified latitude, or a reference
latitude.  Likewise for the &quot;assumed&quot; position.

Responding to John Karl's posting about St Hilaire, I had written-

Aha! Now it's starting to become clearer. Indeed, John and I WERE referring
to different papers! The only identification of the paper was John's mention
of  &quot;my English translation of his 1873 publication&quot;, and that publication
was the one I was referring to. This was &quot;Note sur la determination du
point&quot;, as I said, and its date was 1873. And that paper is really little
more than an elaboration of the Sumner method, though I don't think that it
credits Sumnerin any way, or contains any reference to his pamphlet.

However, what John Karl now tells us he was quoting from, &quot;Calculation of a
Single Observation&quot; on page B2-345,  is not his 1873 paper at all, but is
taken from &quot;Calcul de Point Observe&quot;, dated 1875. In the interval, St
Hilaire's ideas had advanced considerably.

John's comments about my response to his posting were based on a
misunderstanding about which St Hilaire paper I was talking about. Truly, a
bad example of mutual misunderstanding.

Now that's been resolved, I will return to John Karl's original posting and
re-read it
in a rather different light.

John makes a big thing of such confusion, but to me it seems pretty
clear-cut and I really can't see where any such trouble arises.

The &quot;estimated position&quot; is simply your best guess at where you are, taking
everything possible into account, using dead reckoning and any other
evidence..

However, if you are going to use altitude azimuth tables, working from those
tables is much simplified, and interpolation avoided, if you work from a
whole number of degrees for your latitude, and a whole number of degrees for
your local hour angle. So instead of using your estimated position, you
choose as a starting point another position, nearby, which meets that
requirement. That is the &quot;assumed position&quot;. Always, it will be within 30',
in lat and long, of your estimated position. With some tables, such as
HO214, latitudes are tabulated in half-degree steps, and then the assumed
latitude will be within 15' of the estimated value.

Working from that assumed position, the tables will provide a calculate
altitude, to 0.1' or 1', depending on which tables you choose, and you take
the difference with observed latitude to give an intercept, towards or away
from the assumed position. And the azimuth, to 0.1 deg or 1 deg, depending,
tells you in which direction to displace that intercept from the assumed
position.

Working from a small boat, any of those tabulations is quite accurate enough
to be better than the errors involved in estimating where the horizon is, to
measure altitudes.

If you are working with a calculator and not tables, there's no advantage in
choosing whole-number values, and no point at all in bothering with an
assumed position. Work directly from the estimated position.

The procedure I've described above is well known to any navigator worth his
salt. Indeed, there was hardly any point in writing it down, for most
listmembers. The only reason for doing so was to explain the difference
between estimated and assumed positions, and the simplicity of those
concepts.

So tell us, John, where this &quot;Sea of Mystery&quot; comes from. To most of us,
it's no mystery.

Perhaps, though, I have completely misunderstood what he is getting at.

It could perhaps, but it doesn't detract from the point. Many people
schooled in engineering or measuring sciences, including navigation, feel
that it's important to distinguish between &quot;precision&quot; and &quot;accuracy&quot;. Of
course, to people without that specialized education, these words sound
synonymous. There is a good introduction to the issue on Wikipedia here:

that's certainly not the last word, nor the best account, but it's a good

John,

Navigation suffers from more than its fair share of confusing terminology.
The classic is the expression &quot;horizontal parallax&quot;. In modern English,
horizontal refers to something that is lying flat, but once upon a time, it
referred to anything relating to the horizon. So horizontal parallax means
the value of the parallax at the horizon. Perhaps a better modern term would
be &quot;Zero Altitude Parallax&quot; --ZAP instead of HP. Of course, it's too late to
make any actual change in terminology in celestial navigation but when one
is teaching the concept, maybe this would help??

In the case of the &quot;estimated position&quot; of the St. Hilaire article, the
problem is not archaic word usage but translated word usage. If you take the
French phrase and translate it literally, word for word, you get &quot;estimated
position&quot; but if you look at the way the phrase is defined and used in
French navigation lingo, it means no more nor less than &quot;dead reckoning
position&quot;. Personally, if I had translated this article, I would have used
&quot;dead reckoning position&quot;, but it's a judgement call. This is a frequent
issue when translating technical French to English. Many words have obvious
cognates in English that mean something very different, and many other
cognates have subtly different meanings. There is always a compromise
between literal translation, word for word, and paraphrase translation,
which attempts to translate concept for concept.

Ok, one last try on Poor St. Hilaire, using a different approach:

We can say that the St. Hilaire intercept method is a process
(containing both computational and graphic components), perhaps
thinking of it as a machine.  It has inputs and outputs:  We feed in x
and y, the latitude and longitude of a point, let's call it the RP
(the reference point).  For every x and y that's input to the process,
out comes another pair of coordinates, the lat and lon of a point on
the celestial LOP.  Let's call this point SHP (St. Hilaire point) for
convenience of discussion.  The SHP is the unique point closest to the
RP that is exactly on the LOP.

Some List members will recognize that the above descrinption is close
to mathematical phraseology:  The St. Hilaire method is a function
F(x,y) with inputs (independent variables) x and y.  You feed in these
coordinates of the RP.  Out comes the coordinates of a point exactly
on the LOP, which we're labeling the SHP.  You can find as many points
on the LOP as you like, tracing out the LOP - exactly.

Now for comparison, consider the hull speed of a displacement boat, Hs
= 1.34 sqrt(Lw), where Lw is the waterline length (in feet) and Hs is
the hull speed (in knots), and sqrt means take the square root.  This
also represents a function, a process, or a machine, however you want
to look at it.  You input Lw, out comes Hs.

Now the major point:  If we wanted to plot the hull speed versa the
waterline length, would we call the waterline length an estimate?
Would we call it an assumed Lw??  NO.  It's called an independent
variable,  meaning we can specify any Lw we like and we get the
corresponding Hs.  There is no estimation, no uncertain reckoning, no
assumptions in specifying Lw.  The same is true for the specifying St.
Hilaire's RP.  We SPECIFY a point where we wish no know the nearest
point on the LOP.  No estimation, no assumptions.

Now if members think that this is unnecessary and unproductive nit-
picking of terminology, consider that:

1.  All CN books (well, all that I have seen) either don't attempt to
explain the reason for the assumed position, or they explain it
incorrectly.  For example, some say that an assumption is necessary
because the distance between the sun's GP and the ship is too great to
plot, some because there's insufficient information to plot the LOP,
and others because we don't know how to plot the exact LOP.

2.  A List member has stated that the accuracy of the St. Hilaire
result depends on how good the initial estimated position is.

3. And therefore the St. Hilaire method is really an iterative method.

We've just seen that all of this is wrong.  This misunderstanding may
not stem from the unfortunate terminology of &quot;estimated&quot; position and
&quot;assumed&quot; position.  But if it doesn't, where does it come from??

| Ok, one last try on Poor St. Hilaire, using a different approach:
|
| We can say that the St. Hilaire intercept method is a process
| (containing both computational and graphic components), perhaps
| thinking of it as a machine.  It has inputs and outputs:  We feed in x
| and y, the latitude and longitude of a point, let's call it the RP
| (the reference point).  For every x and y that's input to the process,
| out comes another pair of coordinates, the lat and lon of a point on
| the celestial LOP.  Let's call this point SHP (St. Hilaire point) for
| convenience of discussion.  The SHP is the unique point closest to the
| RP that is exactly on the LOP.
|
| Some List members will recognize that the above descrinption is close
| to mathematical phraseology:  The St. Hilaire method is a function
| F(x,y) with inputs (independent variables) x and y.  You feed in these
| coordinates of the RP.  Out comes the coordinates of a point exactly
| on the LOP, which we're labeling the SHP.  You can find as many points
| on the LOP as you like, tracing out the LOP - exactly.
|
| Now for comparison, consider the hull speed of a displacement boat, Hs
| = 1.34 sqrt(Lw), where Lw is the waterline length (in feet) and Hs is
| the hull speed (in knots), and sqrt means take the square root.  This
| also represents a function, a process, or a machine, however you want
| to look at it.  You input Lw, out comes Hs.
|
| Now the major point:  If we wanted to plot the hull speed versa the
| waterline length, would we call the waterline length an estimate?
| Would we call it an assumed Lw??  NO.  It's called an independent
| variable,  meaning we can specify any Lw we like and we get the
| corresponding Hs.  There is no estimation, no uncertain reckoning, no
| assumptions in specifying Lw.  The same is true for the specifying St.
| Hilaire's RP.

John Karl has had another go, and to be honest, I am little the wiser, which
may well be my problem rather than his. Let me summarise, mostly to check
whether I am following him correctly.He argues, at some length, that for any
arbitrary position that you specify, (call it the RP) and a defined GP and
altitude of a body, the St Hilaire process will generate another position
(call it the SHP), on the corresponding position circle around the body, as
close as you can get to the RP, and will do so exactly. And I agree. So
what?

That is only a part of the St Hilaire process. The next step is to draw a
tangent to the position circle through that point, knowing the azimuth
direction. And the next step is to do the whole thing again for another
body, and find the position where those tangents intersect.Only then is the
process completed. And it's those parts of the operation that are affected
by any errors in choosing the RP, divergent from the true position.

and John goes on to say-

| 2.  A List member has stated that the accuracy of the St. Hilaire
| result depends on how good the initial estimated position is.

I wonder if that was me? Whether or not it was, I think that it's true.

| 3. And therefore the St. Hilaire method is really an iterative method.

And I think that is true also. And indeed, so does St Hilaire. See his
comments on page B2- 368, in which he writes &quot;It seems to us necessary to
determine, at least roughly, the approximations that one obtains by the
calculations and thus to know if it is necessary to make a second
calculation to obtain a more correct position&quot;. And on page B2-375 he works
an example in which the error from the true position after one calculation
is 16 miles, which after a second iteration has reduced to 0.2 miles. I
admit that I've made no attempt to follow these sections in detail, however.

| We've just seen that all of this is wrong.

I've seen nothing of the kind. I remain unconvinced, as yet. What am I
missing?

It looks like it's boiling down to our definition of the St. Hilaire
intercept method.

To quote from the 1962 edition of the glossary in Bowditch:  &quot;St.
Hilaire -- The establishing of a line of position from the observation
of the altitude of a celestial body by use of an altitude difference
and azimuth&quot;.

This is also the definition in other glossaries, and is used in the
books I have seen.  In St. Hilaire's original papers he doesn't bother
with a one-line definitions, of course,  but discusses all sorts of
sight reductions under a general section headings.

I had hoped that it was clear that I'm using the traditional Bowditch
definition of the method - establishing a single LOP.  As I've stated,
the error in the straight-line approximation is only due to the
curvature of the true LOP compared to the distance along the straight-
line LOP.

This error is well known and can be corrected without iterations.  HO
229 has a table of offsets that does exactly this (or you can
calculated them yourself).  When it comes to comparing the St. Hilaire
LOP to other information, such as another altitude observation, again
there are several methods.  And yes the Almanac presents an iterative
method using intercepts.  My book presents a direct calculation (no
iterations) at the bottom of page 77.  It uses the same two equations
of the St. Hilaire method, five times.  Whereas a two-body St. Hilaire
fix uses four of these equations.  So with just one more equation, of
the same type, we eliminate the straight-line approximation, using no
iterations.

Yes, one CAN use St. Hilaire iterations to improve the straight-line
approximation, using other information.  But the St. Hilaire method
itself as defined by Bowditch (and others) doesn't use iterations.  So
this part of the discussion has boiled down to semantics.  I was using
the traditional Bowditch definition when I wrote

If we want to expand the definition of St. Hilaire method to include

Well, if we're playing with words, and the Bowditch definition becomes
important, John's quote differs significantly from the definition in vol. 2
of my 1981 edition of Bowditch, which runs as follows-

&quot;St Hilaire method - The establishing of a line of position from the
observation of  the altitude of a celestial body by the use of an assumed
position, the difference between the observed and computed altitudes, and
the azimuth. This is the method most commonly used by modern navigators. The
assumed position may be determined arbitrarily, by dead reckoning, or by
estimation. The method was devised by Marcq St. Hilaire, a French naval
officer, in 1874. ...&quot;

Yes, I agree with John about that. A one-page table of offsets can also be
found as table 4 in Bowditch vol 2, and probably other editions. It allows a
straight-line LOP to be bent into an arc of the right curvature, so that on
the chart it corresponds to an arc of the circular LOP. If this has been
done, for both bodies, then the intersection of those arcs should determine
the true position precisely, independent of how good or bad the initial
estimated positions were (within limits). Therefore, no reiteration would be
called for. Is that part of a &quot;St. Hilaire procedure&quot;, though? I doubt it.

John goes on to say-

That is indeed of great interest. It's at the bottom of page 78, by the way,
not 77. It takes the simultaneous altitudes of two bodies, together with the
decs and LHAs of those bodies, and deduces the position (actually, two
alternative positions) of the observer to satisfy those requirements. It
requires no estimations, and no chartwork. I haven't come across it before,
and wonder whether it's an entirely new piece of work, from John. Certainly
very different from any St. Hilaire procedure.

But I wonder whether there are shortcomings that might show up on closer
investigation. A few questions come to mind-

How does that method handle a situation in which there's a distance-run, or
just an interval, between two sights?
As equations 7.5b, 7.5c, and 7.5e use an arc-cos, how well do they manage
when that angle nears zero degrees, and its cos is changing hardly at all?
Are there problems of putting angles into the right quadrant?

St. Hilaire himself though that iterations were called for in certain

Should we gather, then, that John withdraws points 2 and 3? Those were the

hard to agree or disagree.

OK, so now we have Bowditch editions 1958, 1962, 1981, and 2000, all
defining the St. Hilaire method as a process that determines one
single LOP - not multiple ones with iterations.  So that's what we're
addressing, the determination of a single LOP.

My statement No. 1 was:  All CN books (well, all that I have seen)
either don't attempt to explain the reason for the assumed position,
or they explain it incorrectly.  For example,

A. some say that an assumption is necessary because the distance
between
the sun's GP and the ship is too great to plot,
B.  some because there's insufficient information to plot the LOP,
and
C.  and others because we don't know how to plot the exact LOP.

List members can judge for themselves whether these statements are
definitive, and can be judged either true or false.

Hi John, I've been slowing working through your posts and various replies in
this thread. I'll try to reply in more detail later. For now, at one point
you wrote, &quot;terminology... screws up the concepts.&quot; In a later message, you
wrote, &quot;the terminology traps George (and many others) into thinking that
the estimated latitude generates an approximation.&quot;

I do think that you've got a good point here, but it's going to be a hard
sell. First of all, I can guarantee you that the terminology has not
'trapped' George Huxtable. He understands this material inside and out at a
very deep level (and although George is temporarily lurking, I will add that
he is a tremendous asset to this group). The catch is that experts often
have a hard time remembering what it's like to be a beginner and unless
they've done some recent teaching at the beginner level, any concerns about
terminology are almost incomprehensible. I agree with you that many people
hear the expression &quot;assumed position&quot; and find it very confusing --for a
variety of reasons. I also agree that the approximations or lack of
approximations in many celestial navigation techniques are misunderstood
partly because of strange terminology.

Something else to consider in this St. Hilaire business. The use of
&quot;plotting&quot; on a little chart to get a positional fix caused a lot of worry
for late 19th century navigators. It seems as if many felt that it was
automatically less accurate than a trigonometric solution with log tables.
Very often, for example, Sumner's method was muddied up with logarithmic
equivalents which added no accuracy but seemed to do so because of the
computational biases of that era.

one position and measure an azimuth  and intercept, plot that point
and then draw the LOP perpendicular to the azimuth and I recommend
this method to you.

Hi all,

Gary is absolutely correct - as far as he goes.

As the Sumner method was refined, it became
unnecessary to calculate two (2) positions and to draw
the LOP between the two.

With the realization that the Latitude employed with
and the Longitude determined by the Time Sight
calculation demonstrated a point on a LOP, and that
the LOP ran in a direction 90 degrees to the
right/left of the azimuth of the body employed, it
became customary to simply plot the LOP through the
demonstrated point. This obviated the need for the
second Time Sight calculation and significantly
simplified the work - this method beame one of the
standard LOP methods through the 1930s and was popular
in the MM.

There is little difference in computational time
between the Time Sight and Marc St. Hillare founded
LOP methods and both provide an integrated logarithmic
computation for the azimuth. Aside from use for
compass error determination, one reason for the
proliferation of Azimuth Tables was that many
navigators preferred their use in combination with
these LOP methods, as opposed to use of the integrated
logarithmic solutions.

Regards,

Henry

&gt; very confusing --for a
&gt; &gt; variety of reasons. I also agree that the

&gt; &gt; automatically less accurate than a trigonometric

&gt; &gt; Very often, for example, Sumner's method was

Gary is right about everything he said - almost.

The Sumner 2-point method and the St. Hilaire method take exactly the
same amount of calculation, each solving two equations of the same
complexity.  And Henry agrees.

So all the fuss is about why we use St. Hilaire.  My original point,
19 posts ago, was that all the books that I have seen either don't
explain why we use St. Hilaire, or they explain it incorrectly.

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; Gary is absolutely correct - as far as he goes.

&gt; As the Sumner method was refined, it became
&gt; unnecessary to calculate two (2) positions and to draw
&gt; the LOP between the two.

&gt; With the realization that the Latitude employed with
&gt; and the Longitude determined by the Time Sight
&gt; calculation demonstrated a point on a LOP, and that
&gt; the LOP ran in a direction 90 degrees to the
&gt; right/left of the azimuth of the body employed, it
&gt; became customary to simply plot the LOP through the
&gt; demonstrated point. This obviated the need for the
&gt; second Time Sight calculation and significantly
&gt; simplified the work - this method beame one of the
&gt; standard LOP methods through the 1930s and was popular
&gt; in the MM.

&gt; There is little difference in computational time
&gt; between the Time Sight and Marc St. Hillare founded
&gt; LOP methods and both provide an integrated logarithmic
&gt; computation for the azimuth. Aside from use for
&gt; compass error determination, one reason for the
&gt; proliferation of Azimuth Tables was that many
&gt; navigators preferred their use in combination with
&gt; these LOP methods, as opposed to use of the integrated
&gt; logarithmic solutions.

&gt; &gt; I don't get all the fuss about what is or is not the
&gt; &gt; St. Hilaire
&gt; &gt; method. Sumner discovered the &quot;Sumner Line&quot; by doing
&gt; &gt; two &quot;time sight&quot;
&gt; &gt; computations using two different &quot;assumed latitudes&quot;
&gt; &gt; to determine the
&gt; &gt; corresponding longitudes based on ONE observation.
&gt; &gt; His discovery was
&gt; &gt; his coming to the realization that if he did
&gt; &gt; additional such
&gt; &gt; computations using a series of &quot;assumed latitudes&quot;
&gt; &gt; that he would
&gt; &gt; arrive at all the possible positions for his vessel,
&gt; &gt; the first &quot;line
&gt; &gt; of position&quot;. He also realized that for short
&gt; &gt; distances and within the
&gt; &gt; reasonable estimates of the accuracy of the sight
&gt; &gt; that this series of
&gt; &gt; points looked a lot like a straight line. This led
&gt; &gt; to his realization
&gt; &gt; that he only had to use two &quot;assumed latitudes&quot; to
&gt; &gt; calculate two
&gt; &gt; points, plot those points on the chart and draw a
&gt; &gt; straight line
&gt; &gt; between them thus the &quot;Line of Position&quot; was born.

&gt; &gt; My understanding of St Hilaire's contribution was
&gt; &gt; his method of
&gt; &gt; calculation of where to draw the LOP. In the days
&gt; &gt; before modern tables
&gt; &gt; and calculators, the computation of a &quot;time sight&quot;
&gt; &gt; was time consuming,
&gt; &gt; burdensome and open to the possibility of a
&gt; &gt; mathematical error. Using
&gt; &gt; Sumner's method of calculation a navigator had to do
&gt; &gt; this difficult
&gt; &gt; computation twice thus doubling the work and chance
&gt; &gt; of error. St.
&gt; &gt; Hilaire's method created the exact same LOP as
&gt; &gt; Sumner's method but
&gt; &gt; only required doing the computation one time, saving
&gt; &gt; work and reducing
&gt; &gt; the chance for an error.

&gt; &gt; Today, with programmable calculators, it is trivial
&gt; &gt; to go back to
&gt; &gt; Sumner's method and plot the LOP after determining
&gt; &gt; two points using
&gt; &gt; the &quot;time sight&quot; computation. I programed a
&gt; &gt; calculator at least twenty
&gt; &gt; five years ago to do just this. I put in the
&gt; &gt; declination and GHA of
&gt; &gt; the body, the observed altitude, and two assumed
&gt; &gt; latitudes, bracketing
&gt; &gt; my D.R. latitude. The calculator turned out the
&gt; &gt; longitudes to go along
&gt; &gt; with the two assumed latitudes and I just plotted
&gt; &gt; these positions on
&gt; &gt; the chart and drew a straight line between them thus
&gt; &gt; drawing the LOP
&gt; &gt; using Sumner's method. It is simpler to prick the
&gt; &gt; two positions on the
&gt; &gt; chart and lay a straight edge across them than it is
&gt; &gt; to have to plot
&gt; &gt; one position and measure an azimuth  and intercept,
&gt; &gt; plot that point
&gt; &gt; and then draw the LOP perpendicular to the azimuth
&gt; &gt; and I recommend
&gt; &gt; this method to you.

Hi All,

I wonder if we are all talking about the same thing.
The St. Hilaire method solution as originally proposed
was somewhat complicated, necessitated 2- distict
operations and required more attention to signs; it
used only sines and cosines. A later method was
entitled originally the &quot;cosine-haversine method&quot; -
same result, however, simpler solution. When I learned
the Marc St. Hilaire solution it was actually the
cosine-haversine method.

This is obviously no big deal, but I thought it
interesting from the point of view that these solution
methods were sometimes separated in older texts, i.e.,
perhaps 1931 and earlier, in that the latter method
was not actually credited to the old boy.

Regards,

Henry

Right. And one advantage of the Sumner approach compared to the St. Hilaire
intercept approach is that you can use any old graph paper, including graph
paper drawn up on the spot. With a Sumner line, it doesn't matter if you
have the correct local scale for minutes of longitude. Sumner himself erred
by suggesting that his lines should be drawn on a Mercator projection, and I

I sure can understand why some of you are wondering what all the St.
Hilaire fuss is about.  I'm new to the List and 'am finding out how
hard it is to carry on technical discussions in this format - as some
of you have mentioned.  A major, major, part of the problem is
definitions, and understanding what each other means - as others of
you  have said.  After starting this topic, now with 36 posts under
two topic headings (are topic headings &quot;threads&quot;?), I still haven't
got my point across.  I'm embarrassed, and apologize for not being
able to communicate better.

I was speaking from the viewpoint of a modern author introducing the
St. Hilaire method and the reader trying to understand.  I'm talking
about how the method is introduced in any number of commonly used
books: books by Blewitt, Bowditch (2000 edition), Cunliffe, Dutton
(2004 edition), Howell, Letcher, Meyrier, Moody, Schlereth, Turner,
and Toghill, to name a few.  These authors all are discussing using HO
229, HO 249, or a calculator.  They are all talking about finding a
single LOP - not a fix, not an iteration of fixes.  They're not taking
about older log-trig methods or the Sumner method.

My statement was that all of these authors either don't attempt to
explain the REASON for the assumed position, or they explain it
incorrectly.  For example,

A. Some say that an assumption is necessary because the distance
between the sun's GP and the ship is too great to plot.  While that's
true (for most sights and charts), it's not the reason for the assumed
position.

B.  Some say the AP is necessary because there's insufficient
information to plot the LOP.  That's false.  We know everything
necessary to plot the LOP

C.  Others say the AP is necessary because we don't know how to plot
the exact LOP.  That's also false.  They are several ways to plot the
LOP exactly.

I mused about WHY so many authors either don't explain the reason for
the AP, or they have it incorrect - I think that the term &quot;assumed
position&quot; has misled these folks.  But of course, that's only my
guess.

I wonder what List members think the reason is for their
misunderstanding, particularly when they're supposed to be teaching
others!  No one has addressed this - yet.

If you are correct that your examples A,B and C are the only explanations
given .... then I am truly surprised.

Surely an assumed position is used because any body's altitude angle and
azimuth can be found quickly from Reduction Tables:  the parameters of the
assumed position having to correspond to the restricted increments of
entries in those tables.  No other tables, mathematical knowledge or
calculator are then required to plot an LOP.

The accuracy of the plot was adequate to meet the needs of aircraft flying
increasingly long distances and at increasing speeds in the mid-20th
century.  The estimate of speed over the ground introduced a potentially
larger error due to assumptions which had to made about the wind vector.

I was talking recently to a school friend who flew BOAC VC10s on long-haul
routes in the 60/70s.  He described his transatlantic navigation
qualification flights as a non-stop round of sight-taking, plotting and
application of wind vector estimates.  The need for a rapid and simple
method for plotting estimated LOPs was paramount.

question that many students ask:  If we know everything necessary to

I learned something new in this discussion.  I had never heard that the
Sumner method had evolved into using just one point and an azimuth to
plot the &quot;tangent&quot; method. It may have been easier computationally after
azimuth tables were available but I think that plotting two points on a
chart and connecting them with a straight line is easier and less prone
to error and inaccuracy than plotting an azimuth. This is especially
true since you can choose the latitudes that are lines already printed
on the chart with tick marks showing the longitudes. By the time you
walk a parallel rule across the chart from a rose you are bound to lose
some accuracy. This is also a problem with the St. Hilaire method so the
original Sumner &quot;chord&quot; method would appear to allow the most accurate
plotting of the LOP and a calculator today makes fast work of the
computation.

You asked a while back about the use of the word &quot;assumed&quot; and whether

were there, then  this is the altitude I would have measured.&quot; The
assumed latitude and longitude are exact but are only used to feed in
the values need to compute an altitude for comparison with the actual
measured altitude. Using the Sumner method one also assumed a latitude
for the computation because you need this value to plug into the
computation. There was no advantage to using your D.R. latitude. Even if
you used your D.R.  its latitude was actually assumed for the
computation and  the other latitude was some convenient latitude most
likely one of the lines printed on the chart.

In response to your &quot;A&quot; statement, because the distance is too great to
plot on the chart at a sufficiently large scale to be useful (except for
very high altitude shots for which you actually plot the circle of
position around the GP) you must calculate where to draw a segment of
the circle of position on the chart near where you think you are and the
AP gives you exact values to feed into the computation for St. Hilaire
or an exact latitude to use for Sumner.

John,
Some goods books have mistakes.

For example Bowditch use for the calculation of the meridional parts two concepts that are based in none model:

a = 21600.0/(2.0*PI)  is used in the spherical model of The Earth
f  = 1.0/298.26       is used in WGS72, but this use a = 6378135.0/1852.0

I sure can understand why some of you are wondering what all the St.
Hilaire fuss is about.  I'm new to the List and 'am finding out how
hard it is to carry on technical discussions in this format - as some
of you have mentioned.  A major, major, part of the problem is
definitions, and understanding what each other means - as others of
you  have said.  After starting this topic, now with 36 posts under
two topic headings (are topic headings &quot;threads&quot;?), I still haven't
got my point across.  I'm embarrassed, and apologize for not being
able to communicate better.

I was speaking from the viewpoint of a modern author introducing the
St. Hilaire method and the reader trying to understand.  I'm talking
about how the method is introduced in any number of commonly used
books: books by Blewitt, Bowditch (2000 edition), Cunliffe, Dutton
(2004 edition), Howell, Letcher, Meyrier, Moody, Schlereth, Turner,
and Toghill, to name a few.  These authors all are discussing using HO
229, HO 249, or a calculator.  They are all talking about finding a
single LOP - not a fix, not an iteration of fixes.  They're not taking
about older log-trig methods or the Sumner method.

My statement was that all of these authors either don't attempt to
explain the REASON for the assumed position, or they explain it
incorrectly.  For example,

A. Some say that an assumption is necessary because the distance
between the sun's GP and the ship is too great to plot.  While that's
true (for most sights and charts), it's not the reason for the assumed
position.

B.  Some say the AP is necessary because there's insufficient
information to plot the LOP.  That's false.  We know everything
necessary to plot the LOP

C.  Others say the AP is necessary because we don't know how to plot
the exact LOP.  That's also false.  They are several ways to plot the
LOP exactly.

I mused about WHY so many authors either don't explain the reason for
the AP, or they have it incorrect - I think that the term &quot;assumed
position&quot; has misled these folks.  But of course, that's only my
guess.

I wonder what List members think the reason is for their
misunderstanding, particularly when they're supposed to be teaching
others!  No one has addressed this - yet.

I don't know if it takes exactly the same amount of calculation since
I have never worked the cosine-haversine method. But, we do know that
navigators who were using celestial navigation in the good old days
(end of the 19th- beginning of the 20th century) quickly switched to
the &quot;new navigation&quot; St. Hilaire method of computation so THEY
obviously thought that it was an improvement over the Sumner &quot;tangent&quot;
and &quot;chord&quot; methods. Those navigators &quot;voted with their wallets&quot; so
they must have carefully considered what they were doing. In addition,
the St. Hilaire intercept leant itself to the development of short
tables to make the computation easy such as Weems Line of Position
Book, H.O.208, H.O. 211, and then the modern inspection tables, H.O.
214, etc.

My previous post about the 1919 navigation text (I had incorrectly
stated that it was a 1909 text)

&quot;The description of the Sumner method starts on page 186. On page 212
it
discusses &quot;The New Navigation, &quot; invented by Marq St. Hilaire. On page
213 it states &quot; This is but another method of determining a line of
position, or Sumner line, and among intelligent navigators both of the
navy and merchant marine, this method has almost entirely supplanted
the
old time sight for longitude, and the chord and tangent method for
obtaining the sumner lines...&quot;

http://books.google.com/books?id=lPY3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg;=PA57&amp;lpg;=PA57&amp;dq;=bow ...

makes this clear.

&gt; Gary is right about everything he said - almost.

&gt; The Sumner 2-point method and the St. Hilaire method take exactly the
&gt; same amount of calculation, each solving two equations of the same
&gt; complexity.  And Henry agrees.

&gt; So all the fuss is about why we use St. Hilaire.  My original point,
&gt; 19 posts ago, was that all the books that I have seen either don't
&gt; explain why we use St. Hilaire, or they explain it incorrectly.

John, you wrote:

&quot;... many students ask:  If we know everything necessary to

Because they want to use Sight Reduction Tabels as a quick, mentally
undemanding method to plot LOPs.

I teach a lot of commercial sailors who require AN for Deck Officer tickets.
They want a method which works, and which requires a minimum of
sophistication.

Similarly, when I am cruising, I carry a selected few sheets from SR Tables
to cover the latitudes I need and a few pages of Almanac data.  That's all.

When at home with computer and library resources I agree with you:  there is
no need to assume anything to plot an LOP.  But that's not real life on a
small boat or a minimally manned commercial vessel.

John Karl has continued his attempts to tease a bit more yarn from this

Yes, that's so true. A list such as ours has the advantage of immediacy. But
where the author of a book or a paper has space and time to build up to a
topic, here it all has to be compressed into a posting, definitions and all.
Some readers will respond off-the-cuff, without reading carefully enough (I
know. having done just that about another topic).

John, you shouldn't need to apologise or feel embarrassed about our failure
to grasp the point you are making, a point that clearly, you feel strongly
about. Do try again.

Well, I have, from that list, Letcher, Bowditch, Dutton, Blewitt but maybe
in editions that differ from his. I have many others, not on his list, some
of very doubtful quality. But the trouble is that John has taken a
scatter-gun approach. He has listed a number of texts, and three perceived
errors. But he doesn't associate which with which. If I pick up Letcher, for
example, I can't be sure which, of A, B, or C, John is pointing out to be
its defect, in this regard.

I have the advantage of now owning a copy of John's own book, &quot;Celestial
Navigation in the GPS age&quot;, and perhaps already some list members have their
own. and I wonder whether he brings some of the difficulties of definition
upon himself. For example, he defines his use of &quot;estimated position&quot; to
mean a point on a celestial position circle that's as close as can be to the
DR position. Other authors might use those words to describe the best
estimate of position before any celestial observation is taken into account.
That's either the DR position or the DR modified by any other information,
such as a sounding, perhaps, or a tidal stream correction (if the DR had
been defined in such a way as to exclude that, as sometimes it is).

And (reluctantly) he accepts the name Assumed Position, or AP to refer to
&quot;any preselected point defining the region of interest&quot;, quibbling somewhat
about that name by saying &quot;... that's misleading; we are not assuming the
ship is there- on the contrary, we usually expect that it is not&quot;. But (to
quibble back) isn't that what the word &quot;assuming&quot; implies? You &quot;assume&quot;
something to be the case, whether or not it actually IS the case. Usually,
&quot;assumed position&quot; has been used for a position which is deliberately
displaced from the DR, to allow whole-degree entries in the alt-az tables
(and an unnecessary distraction when using a calculator, as John Karl
recommends). Later in the book, he uses AP in that special context.

What I'm saying, really, that his use of DR, AP, EP can be different from
the usage you may find elsewhere, which is fair enough, when those meanings
have been carefully defined. Indeed, you may find in other works the terms
chosen position, trial position, just to add to the complicated mix.

I believe you have put your finger on precisely why there is misuse and
misunderstanding of the term 'Assumed' Position:  and clarified for me why
some of my students don't instantly latch on to what I am saying to them
about sight reduction.

The original meaning of the word 'to assume' meant to take up a position or
office;  &quot;he assumed the position of first mate&quot;.  Only later did 'to
assume' acquire the meaning in popular usage of making use of a convenient
value or fact.

For some reason (probably due to receiving an 'old-fashioned' education from
literate teachers) I have always understood 'Assumed Position' to mean what
would have been the understanding when inspection tables were first produced
(eg Revd Ball, 1907) - namely, that one imagined physically relocating to
the AP and used the tables to find what would be seen from that position.

'Assumed' means 'going to a location' not 'taking up a convenient value'.
