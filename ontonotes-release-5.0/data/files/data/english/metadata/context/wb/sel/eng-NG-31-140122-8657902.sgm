Prepared, schmepared. The Jets can't stop the run, they haven't been
able to do so for two years in a row since Parcells first came on.
Last year, they were historically bad against the run. Brady made some
tough throws with defenders on Moss, but the passes were on the money
all day. I would have liked to see more blitzing, but with the success
Brady was having on deep passes, it's tough to argue.

DeWayne Robertson, simply put, blows. I'm sorry - he sucks. I'm so
tired of this guy getting engulfed at the POA on 9 straight running
plays, then makes a decent stop for 2 yards and the commentators
praise him. All this talk about how he's a &quot;good, not great&quot; player is
absurd. He's a borderline bust. And I don't want to hear about scheme,
either. The only year he didn't blow was 2004, when he was in the
middle of a loaded defense. He played in a 4-3 in 2003 and 2005, and
sucked just as hard as he has the past 2 seasons.

I actually thought the Jets were well-prepared on offense. They were
creative, they tried to spread the ball around. Chad actually played a
very good game. Just too much pressure and zero running lanes. Plus
few opportunities given to them by an embarassing defensive display.

One guy who is officially on notice with me is D'Brickashaw Ferguson.
I defended him all last year - enough. Time to step it up. Who knows
how badly Pennington is hurt. (though the worse he's injured, the
happier most Jet fans will probably be) Time to start playing like the
4th overall pick, and not a 4th rounder.

And how about Baretts whif on Welker to set the tone, I mean this was wes

Agre on Robertson, enough already. It just isn't working out, but how can
you say they were prepared on ofense?
They only scored twice. I'm just happy this only counts as one loss.
Letting Moss have that catch in the middle of three defenders was pathetic.

How were the Jets unprepared on offense ? Chad had an idea of where to
go with the ball, they tried to mix in the run. They put guys in
motion and they spread the field. Just too much pressure and too few
running lanes. That's not preperation, that's getting beat at the
LOS.

Pennington's numbers were actually pretty solid. Completed a high
percentage with over 8 yards per pass attempt, 2 TDs-0 INTs and got
both starting WRs involved.

&quot;Not prepared&quot;?

Well, in the sense that that coaches haven't yet prepared either an
O-Line or D-Line that can play with the Pats, that's true enough.

But when your running backs are producing less than 1 yd per carry in
the first half because the line is stuffed on every play, while your
QB is being sacked on fully 25% of his pass attempts (12 att, 3 sacks,
1 scramble out of one for a yd.), it's hard to place blame on &quot;lack of
preparation&quot; in any other sense, like failing to choose the right
schemes or give a better motivational speeche or whatever.

And given no running game at all and that sack rate, I'd say Chad and
the receivers looked plenty well prepared in generating their 147
passing rating.

As to the DL -- it was much worse than the OL even last year, and in
today's game there was no visible evidence of any improvement. Brady's
not going to be paying much to get his uniform cleaned after this
game. Zero sacks for him.

Really, what's to &quot;prepare&quot; to compensate for getting crushed on both
lines??

Agreed.  Moss is a player, and Brady is a player getting him the ball.
So they deserve some credit.

The answer to them would be a DL good enough to generate some pass
rush on its own (in addition to being at least mediocre against the
run) so there'd be no need to creates D-backfield weaknesses by
blitzing-from- weakness that Brady &amp; Co can rip to shreds.

Dream on....

I don't know what &quot;prepared&quot; means in this context except as some
cliche.

Say you see Mike Tyson walking down the street, you spit in his eye
and call him &quot;ear chomper&quot;, he flattens you and you lay there on your
back until an ambulance crew scrapes you off the pavement.  Was it
because you weren't &quot;prepared&quot; for a punching match with him?   If you
had been, it wouldve turned out different?

The Jets O-line was crushed into a running game producing less than 1
yd a carry while the QB was sacked or forced to scramble on fully 25%
of his attempts in the first half, while it was still a game. How does
one  &quot;prepare&quot; an O to overcome that to get more TDs?

Actually, given the passing numbers when sacks were avoided and the
&quot;quick play&quot; ploys the O used a couple times to grab first downs, it
looked to me like the things that they could prepare mentally --
passing schemes and play calling -- worked well and were prepared just
fine.

It's just that the O-line got physically manhandled into submission
... while the D-line never bothered Brady at all, and you if don't
bother a QB as good as Brady throwing to a WR as good as Moss, the
results are entirely predictible.  I don't know any way to prepare to
avoid them.

Preparation wasn't the issue.  Nor was the game all that bad considering the
Jets talent level vs. that of the Gaytriots.  Take away the TD runback and
one of the Moss big plays due to blown coverage, and you've got a close run
game even though the Patriots outplayed the Jets.  It is no secret that the
Patriots have a much better team then the Jets on a man for man level.
Given that the Pats are considerably more well manned then the Jets and
touted to go to another super, Id say the Jets did as good as you could
expect.  Chad had a very good game.  He did NOTHING to prevent the Jets from
winning the game.  He was playing well even after he got twisted up.
Also.... I don't think the Jets fans who cheered Clemens meant to be
disrespectful to Pennington.  It was more of a knee jerk reaction due to the
team loosing and the fans being excited about Clemens given his seemingly
good play on the preseason.

Here is the Jets problem.

Aside from Mangold, they have no talent on the offensive line.  Brick isn't
playing all that well either.   The Jets have no... I mean NO 'effing talent
on the defensive line nor do they have lb's that come anywhere close to
being any help on the line.

I think we were on the same channel today, Rule.
I've had it with DRob, &amp; Brick crossed that line today.

About the blitzing, it's strange how many think the Jets blitzed a lot today.

&gt;&gt; And how about Baretts whif on Welker to set the tone, I mean this was wes

If you have an OL that can't block, you run a lot of screens, end arounds,
and draws to slow them down. Funny but I only saw about two screens no end
arounds and draws at times even Simms called them out before they were run..

&gt; Pennington's numbers were actually pretty solid. Completed a high

He threw for 167 ads to Bradys 297 and Brady only attempted 7 more passes.
The only thing Chad did that was a real positive was not throw any picks and
got two TDs' He had a pedestrian game to say the least.

&gt; I don't know what &quot;prepared&quot; means in this context except as some
&gt; cliche.

&gt; Say you see Mike Tyson walking down the street, you spit in his eye
&gt; and call him &quot;ear chomper&quot;, he flattens you and you lay there on your
&gt; back until an ambulance crew scrapes you off the pavement.  Was it
&gt; because you weren't &quot;prepared&quot; for a punching match with him?   If you
&gt; had been, it wouldve turned out different?

&gt; The Jets O-line was crushed into a running game producing less than 1
&gt; yd a carry while the QB was sacked or forced to scramble on fully 25%
&gt; of his attempts in the first half, while it was still a game. How does
&gt; one  &quot;prepare&quot; an O to overcome that to get more TDs?
">

I don't know, how about a three step drop and pass.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Actually, given the passing numbers when sacks were avoided and the
&gt; &quot;quick play&quot; ploys the O used a couple times to grab first downs, it
&gt; looked to me like the things that they could prepare mentally --
&gt; passing schemes and play calling -- worked well and were prepared just
&gt; fine.

&gt; It's just that the O-line got physically manhandled into submission
&gt; ... while the D-line never bothered Brady at all, and you if don't
&gt; bother a QB as good as Brady throwing to a WR as good as Moss, the
&gt; results are entirely predictible.  I don't know any way to prepare to
&gt; avoid them.

YThere are plays like screens and draws that will make a pas rush slow down.
I don't think they did enough of that.

&gt;&gt;sucked just as hard as he has the past 2 seasons.

When I yessed the previous poster, I included the offseason as part of
prepartion. The Pats were aggressive in addressing their weaknesses.
They effectively have an entirely new WR core. They also addressed a
need with AT, and may have upgraded at RB and TE.

We used the offseason to weaken a weak OL, and unless some surprise
happens, made no noticeable improvement to the front seven either.
Kenyon and Bowens looked weak.

To me, that is not being prepared.

Glenn this is unreasonable. In spite of numerous blitzes, Brady had time
for a cup of coffee, a look downfield, time to set his feet, and then he
could throw to whoever Barret wasn't covering or whoever Coleman had
deep responsibility for. The yards per catch or pass were high because
Brady had all day.

We gave up 5 sacks. Chad was hit on several more plays. Better than 76%
completions, more than ten yards per completion, two TDs, no
interceptions. All with no pass protection and no running game. Give it
up already.

They played a pretty straight game... not much disguising, etc.

I think they should have blitzed more, but I suspect, they wanted to see how the *new*
line performed.
We'll be seeing more blitzing, as we did during the 2nd half of last season.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; able to do so for two years in a row since Parcells first came on.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Last year, they were historically bad against the run. Brady made some
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tough throws with defenders on Moss, but the passes were on the money
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all day. I would have liked to see more blitzing, but with the success
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Brady was having on deep passes, it's tough to argue.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; DeWayne Robertson, simply put, blows. I'm sorry - he sucks. I'm so
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tired of this guy getting engulfed at the POA on 9 straight running
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; plays, then makes a decent stop for 2 yards and the commentators
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; praise him. All this talk about how he's a &quot;good, not great&quot; player is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; absurd. He's a borderline bust. And I don't want to hear about scheme,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; either. The only year he didn't blow was 2004, when he was in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; middle of a loaded defense. He played in a 4-3 in 2003 and 2005, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sucked just as hard as he has the past 2 seasons.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I actually thought the Jets were well-prepared on offense. They were
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; creative, they tried to spread the ball around. Chad actually played a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; very good game. Just too much pressure and zero running lanes. Plus
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; few opportunities given to them by an embarassing defensive display.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One guy who is officially on notice with me is D'Brickashaw Ferguson.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I defended him all last year - enough. Time to step it up. Who knows
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; how badly Pennington is hurt. (though the worse he's injured, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happier most Jet fans will probably be) Time to start playing like the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 4th overall pick, and not a 4th rounder.

&gt; &gt;&gt; And how about Baretts whif on Welker to set the tone, I mean this was wes
&gt; &gt;&gt; welker runing through Barett as if he was trying to tackle Jamel Lewis.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Agre on Robertson, enough already. It just isn't working out, but how can
&gt; &gt;&gt; you say they were prepared on ofense?
&gt; &gt;&gt; They only scored twice. I'm just happy this only counts as one loss.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Letting Moss have that catch in the middle of three defenders was
&gt; &gt;&gt; pathetic.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Take the penalty.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt; How were the Jets unprepared on offense ?

&gt; How about the running game.
&gt; Chad had an idea of where to&gt; go with the ball, they tried to mix in the run.
">

The running game needs blocking to work. Jones knew there wasn't much
blocking, and tried to bounce some runs later in the game.

If you can't block their DL, there is no preperation that is going to
help you. You either block them, or you don't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You and I have different ideas on that.
">

I suppose Chad's 70 yard TD drive after sustaining an ankle injury,
and his overall game rating 130.5 QB rating (76 completion %), is
evidence that he was unprepared ?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  They put guys in&gt; motion and they spread the field. Just too much pressure and too few
&gt; &gt; running lanes. That's not preperation, that's getting beat at the
&gt; &gt; LOS.

&gt; If you have an OL that can't block, you run a lot of screens, end arounds,
&gt; and draws to slow them down. Funny but I only saw about two screens no end
&gt; arounds and draws at times even Simms called them out before they were run..
">

You can't blame them for running draws on 2nd and 3rd and 25+, that's
Joe Benigno-type criticizing right there. The half was nearly over and
they were trying to get to the locker room only down 7.

The Jets threw quick passes all day, and many of their planned quick
passes at the LOS were sniffed out by the Pats. (one to Washington was
defensed perfectly)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Pennington's numbers were actually pretty solid. Completed a high
&gt; &gt; percentage with over 8 yards per pass attempt, 2 TDs-0 INTs and got
&gt; &gt; both starting WRs involved.

&gt; He threw for 167 ads to Bradys 297 and Brady only attempted 7 more passes.
&gt; The only thing Chad did that was a real positive was not throw any picks and
&gt; got two TDs' He had a pedestrian game to say the least.
">

Are you joking ? Seriously. I cannot believe the lack of respect this
guy receives from Jet fans every year. Brady's team held the ball
longer in large part due to their +18 advantage in rushing attempts.
Pennington, with no running game, was excellent yesterday. He averaged
8 yards per pass attempt - you'd take that every game.

The Jets employed plenty of blitzes w/ the linebackers.  They were
just ineffective.  Mangini discussed in his postgame.  For people
to say the Jets didn't blitz makes me think that they weren't
really paying attention.  I was hoping to see more safety or even
corner blitz.  But the Jets did blitz 5 or 6 periodically
yesterday.  Pats picked it up every time.  They are a well coached
team.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;how badly Pennington is hurt. (though the worse he's injured, the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;happier most Jet fans will probably be) Time to start playing like the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;4th overall pick, and not a 4th rounder.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think we were on the same channel today, Rule.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I've had it with DRob, &amp; Brick crossed that line today.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; About the blitzing, it's strange how many think the Jets blitzed a lot
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; today.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I expected them to, and was surprised they didn't more.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They didn't Blitz more because NE was killing us on them .

&gt;&gt;&gt; They didn't blitz more, because they didn't blitz more.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They played a pretty straight game... not much disguising, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I think they should have blitzed more, but I suspect, they wanted to see
&gt;&gt;&gt; how the *new*
&gt;&gt;&gt; line performed.
&gt;&gt;&gt; We'll be seeing more blitzing, as we did during the 2nd half of last
&gt;&gt;&gt; season.

&gt;&gt;Burf, did you watch the same game I did? They were blitzing LB's. They
&gt;&gt;just
&gt;&gt;didn't bring a S and I can see why with the way Brady was picking us
&gt;&gt;apart.

&gt; Yup, I did, and was not seeing the blitz very often.

Burf, they brought the LB's a lot in the second half. They were just picked
up.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Prepared, schmepared. The Jets can't stop the run, they haven't been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;able to do so for two years in a row since Parcells first came on.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Last year, they were historically bad against the run. Brady made some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tough throws with defenders on Moss, but the passes were on the money
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all day. I would have liked to see more blitzing, but with the success
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Brady was having on deep passes, it's tough to argue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;DeWayne Robertson, simply put, blows. I'm sorry - he sucks. I'm so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tired of this guy getting engulfed at the POA on 9 straight running
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;plays, then makes a decent stop for 2 yards and the commentators
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;praise him. All this talk about how he's a &quot;good, not great&quot; player is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;absurd. He's a borderline bust. And I don't want to hear about scheme,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;either. The only year he didn't blow was 2004, when he was in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;middle of a loaded defense. He played in a 4-3 in 2003 and 2005, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sucked just as hard as he has the past 2 seasons.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I actually thought the Jets were well-prepared on offense. They were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;creative, they tried to spread the ball around. Chad actually played a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;very good game. Just too much pressure and zero running lanes. Plus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;few opportunities given to them by an embarassing defensive display.

Yeah, but they should have brought Rhodes at least.  I think on one play
they were ready to send him which forced Brady to call a timeout.

Yeah, in terms of blitzing, it was a tale of two halves.  But it was mostly
linebacker blitzes.
