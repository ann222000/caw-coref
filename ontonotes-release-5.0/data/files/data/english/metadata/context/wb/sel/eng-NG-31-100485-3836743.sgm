a lot of people are saying the 6 cyl and v8 will interchange
transmissions, but the tranny will be weaker. Please let me know. I am
trying to get a 5spd for my v8 bird but can't find one....the only ones out
there are the stupid v6 2.8's ..if thats all I can find then so be it.

Have you done a search on T-5 rebuilders.  Here's one guy that I use
for my rebuild kits.  Very knowledable in manual transmissions.

True but not totally true.  T-5s are in most Third gen F-bodies that
came away with a gear stick.  The exceptions are I believe the 82'
models, which came with T-4s.

I don't have any concrete specs on the differences between V-6 and V-8
applications but judging from GMs past, I'd go the route of caution
with using a tranny out of a V-6 car.  In fact what the OP is really
looking for would be an 88' or newer World Class T-5 which are
slightly stronger than the older models.

'82s had Borg Warner Super T10s and Saginaw 4-speeds.  They were probably the
weakest designed and used 3.42 first gears to help the anemic engines get the
car moving.

I don't think the T-4 was used until '83 or '84.

. The differance between I-4, V6 &amp; V8 T-5 is the bell housing. Which
are removable.

I-4 &amp; most V6 use the same bellhosuing bolt patern. 4.3 V6 &amp; V8 use the
same bellhousing bolt pattern.

F-car T-5's use a slighly different case &amp; bellhousing. The bell
housing puts the transmission at a angel, and the case has the shift at
a angel.

Any good transmission shop can repair/rebuild a T-5 for you. Including
upgraded internials.

If you really want a heavy duty 5 speed, you can buy a richmond 5-speed
from jegs or summit.

The V8 and V6/I4 5-speed (T-5) transmissions are not interchangeable.
The V8 transmission has a larger 26 spline input shaft and the
bellhousing bolt patterns are different.  As others have said, the
newer V8 T-5's are better than the older ones.

Make it interesting and swap in a T56 6-speed from a '93+ car.  They're
probably more common anyways.

Yes they are ... except for the very late models.   There were actually
problems with the bearing mid plate stretching.

As with many things in the late 70's/early 80's.  Quality was down ... and so
was power.

Remember that the transmissions in the 3rd gen cars have something
like a 18º or 22º kant to them to fit in the tranny tunnel.  I think
that the T-4 is the 4 speed that was standard in these cars.  In 83'
the T-5 was an option for the plane janes but a factory part for the
Berlinettas and Z28s.  Besides, how would they have set up the
shifting linkage at and angle and with no room to play with?  It would
have had to have been a top loader type transmission.

The 70's &amp; 80's had many good body styles. The power trains didn't get
really good untill the mid 90's. Well let me amend that, it's damn hard
to choke a 454 with a q-jet to where it has no torque (yea yea it's a
truck engine).

Now if only that new fangled GTO came with 475 HP, and a real GTO look.

1982 Firebirds and Camaros did indeed use Borg Warner T10 and Saganaw
transmissions.  Do a search on the net and you'll get many hits on the subject.

They are actually one year only transmissions as the tail housings have a
provision for mounting the torque arm that was used on 3rd-gens.

There is a lot of 2nd-gen engineering and design that was passed onto the early
3rd-gens.  '82-83 F-bodies use a mechanical clutch linkage(Z-bar and rods) Most
people think 3rd-gens have always had a hydraulic clutch.

I was wrong, thanks.  I read something about them being a second
design T-10.  Didn't understand it, maybe you know if there are
differences in the 82' transmission versus T-10s and Super T-10s.
Maybe they had smaller shafts?
