And give your daughter explicit permission to say something like: &quot;I
really don't want you to quiz me.&quot; And to change the subject.

Adults, and even other kids, seem to feel free to quiz all sorts of kids
and intrude into their lives in all sorts of rude ways.

Imagine how this conversation would go if it were your husband being
quizzed by some stranger instead of your child.

NO KIDDING!  Or if someone were to come to me and say &quot;Do you know
what a gerund is?&quot;  (I do, but I probably wouldn't be inclined to
tell them, if their intent was to approve or to &quot;out&quot; me or shame me
somehow.)

And I wouldn't ask another folksinger to explain to me in words what
kinds of music should end in unison on the last verse instead of a
chord, or to ask them which style needed WAY more thirds and fifths
and rarely any fourths (though sevenths are cool there).  And how
cruel would I be if the person had to say &quot;I have no idea what you're
talking about.&quot;  And what if the person just didn't know the
teminology but could harmonize like God or Emmylou Harris, so it was
really none of MY business anyway?

So maybe run a few scenarios like that in terms of your own knowledge
and see what emotions come up and that might help you shield and
fortify your child when similarly unreasonable requests are made of her.

Well my answer would be &quot;I'm not sure, but you're welcome to tell me all
about it&quot; and then pause expectantly.

Would that work to dissuade quizzers - the idea that they were in for having
to give a lengthy explanation after every question? Or maybe it would forge
pleasant bonds instead?

I used to tell people, when Jayn would silently gaze at them with a &quot;don't
*you* know?&quot; expression, &quot;she isn't a performing monkey.&quot; I hope my smile
made it seem less rude, if no less final.

My kids have a variety of ways of dealing with quizzing attempts.
Their most common response was, &quot;I don't really know much about that,
but do you know...&quot; and would to proceed to discuss something they had
recently discovered that was usually way beyond what kids do in school
(though not always.)  It inevitably would redirect the conversation.

Of course it would depend on the person who was doing the quizzing
(and which of my kids was responding.)  Even if they knew the answer,
sometimes they might just answer but more often than not they would
use the &quot;if you don't now, I'm not going to tell you,&quot; approach.
Jacob has been known to explain to people how they can find the
answer--but not answer the actually question.

When my then mother-in-law tried to quiz my oldest three on
multiplication tables, Jacob proceeded to explain the concept of
multiplication in his then 8-year-old understanding of the process.
He knew the concept, but did not have the tables memorized.  When she
persisted in trying to get him to tell her what 8X7 equals, he said,
&quot;But I just told you how to get the answer!  If you don't understand,
just use a calculator.&quot;  and walked away from her.

My oldest three are Kelsey, almost 16; Jacob, 14; and Kaleb, 13 now.
I haven't heard them getting quizzed in years.  Kelsey is the queen at
redirection.  Jacob has a way of turning things back at a person so
you feel like a fool.  Kaleb tends to just give a look of disgust.

Before she died this spring, Jossilyn (9) had strong similarities to
Jacob.  But she would often start with, &quot;Oh, I don't know that.  What
is the use of that? &quot;  and might launch into a discussion of what is
wrong with school and why she didn't like it there.  (Though she only
ever spent maybe 8 weeks in school when she was seven--at her
insistence.)  She liked to talk, that girl...  But she was also a big
fan of the look of disgust.

My youngest two are only 5 and 3, so they haven't experienced the
quizzing yet, but I tend to think they will receive less of it thanks
to the older kids.

I have also been known to run interference with quizzing.  I might
jump in with my own answer as if I was the one being asked (acting
like I thought they actually just wanted to know the answer.)  This
has worked well to redirect the conversation to me and then we can
have a discussion about quizzing and why it is rude and doesn't prove
anything.

There are any number of ways of dealing with this issue--some seem
more rude than others.  What works best for you and your daughter will
depend on you personalities.  It is important that you get past being
uncomfortable over what you child does NOT know and focus on what she
DOES know.

Hope this helps

This is great!

Marty had found one multiplication &quot;problem&quot; and memorized it when he
was five or six or so, and it was a big random one, like 17 x 33 or
something.  And he memorized the answer.  This was all his idea.
When someone would ask him 7x8 was he would either tell them (if he
knew) or he would say, &quot;I don't know, but do you know what 17x33 is?&quot;
and they would say &quot;no,&quot; and he would tell them the answer.

I'd like to keep your post for others to see when this question comes
up, because it has great ideas.  And I'm sorry to hear about
Jossilyn's death.

Hey, that's what my husband Keith said to ME once when I was trying
to get five-year-old Marty to roller blade for his grandparents!
&quot;He's not a performing monkey.&quot;

Go ahead and use whatever you think might be helpful.
Thank you regarding Jossilyn.
