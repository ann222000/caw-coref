KING ESAE'S SLAVE
A Tale of Babylon
BY THE AUTHOR OF &quot;KIDDLE-A-WINK,&quot; &quot;MILDRED'S WEDDING,&quot; ETC.

PART THE FIRST.

A wide waste, a dry land and wilderness, a land wherein no man
dwelleth or can dwell, a habitation of owls and place of dragons. The
wild beasts of the desert are here- the jackal and the wolf; but no
stone lieth upon another to be for a corner or a foundation, for
Babylon is become a desolation. Her broad walls are utterly broken;
and there remain of her temples only these burnt heaps scattered over
an arid plain.

This mound, where the lizards lie in the dry sun, was perchance
the palace of the king. I rest my hand upon it, and, crumbling the
dust through my fingers, I permit my thought like a spirit to pass
over perished peoples and mighty ruins, through dynasties and battles,
tradition and prophecy; and through all these it comes again to
Babylon. What a change! I see the city in her glory--when the nations
flocked to her, and the whole heathen world paid her tribute.
Thousands throng her streets; but, passing them swiftly by, I find my
way to the palace of the king. I enter, and in corridor and hall I
pass men of war, silken-robed courtiers, armies of slaves, groups of
sages. The Magi of the East are here, the Chaldean and the sorcerer,
the soothsayer and the prophet. Penetrating the noiseless crowd, I
come to a high chamber shut out from the sun--a chamber roofed with a,
fret-work of gold and gem, supported on jasper columns; and for
windows it has arches of wrought cedar, filled with a trellis of
carved ivory. Beyond these arc pillars of marble, with silken hangings
of green and crimson, amber and blue, whereon the fretted ivory of the
trellis shines white and clear--beautiful in the marvel of its
sculptures. Between the rustling curtains I see the hanging gardens
borne up on pillars, with fountains sparkling in the perfumed air, and
birds and flowers gleaming in the sun.

The couches in this chamber are of silk, worked in silver; and
the cushions on the marble floor  are broidered by the hands of
queens.

The throne is empty; but the crown, shining like a sun, rests on
it; and the royal robe of purple, heavy with gems, hangs across it.
Both are here because the king sleeps. He lies on a couch of gold,
whose cushions of Tyrian purple are wrought with mystic characters,
and fringed with pearl. The king sleeps, but a cold sweat stands upon
his brow, and his face is ashen pale, and ghastly with the shadow of
death.

He uncloses his haggard eyes, and calls with dry and fevered lips
for a cup of water to ease his pain. As he drinks and leans his
fainting head upon the cushions, he commands the presence of his
soothsayers and sorcerers.

They come in troops and stand silent before him. Then lifting
those sad eyes, so kingly yet so worn, he says, half in sorrow, half
in scorn:

&quot;Miserable comforters are ye all! Wisdom has departed from your
counsels; and since ye cannot heal me of this fell disease, certify
how long I have to live, and leave me in peace to die.&quot;

No voice answers him. Then his face changes towards them, and he
cries sternly:

&quot;Depart from me, ye men of shallow cunning and lying words! Neither
life nor death nor knowledge is in your hands. Ye cannot tell me even
when I shall die.&quot;

&quot;Only the gods can tell the king this,&quot; answers one among them.
&quot;There is not a magician, a sorcerer, or a Chaldean that can certify
such a matter.&quot;

There is a gleam in the king's eye, a momentary glance of fire,
telling much --telling that, before this pain and sickness came, such
an answer would have doomed the speaker to instant death; but now he
is too weary even for cruelty. Sinking back upon the couch, the gleam
of fury dies from his haggard eye, changing to a smile of scorn, and
with a wave of his hand he dismisses them.

They take with them his last hope, for he clings to magic still;
and he had thought to hear from their lips that a year or two of life
was left him. But he is a king, having a kingly courage; and the smile
upon his wan face has a sort of scorn for death itself, as he turns
upon his uneasy couch, and lifts prayerless eyes to heaven.

&quot;Gods! there are no gods -- mockeries are they all, and lies--
deceivers of the multitude, scorn of the wise!&quot; His eyes droop, and
fall upon a shadow standing near-- a shadow from the West, dim,
unborn, and yet present.

A faint smile breaks upon the king's lips, and a spirit of
prophecy falls upon him.

&quot;Behold a nation that runneth to and fro over the whole earth,
even to this Babylon--a nation curious respecting the living and the
dead; a people who will dive down into the midst of the sea for a
bone, or travel to the outer world of ice and darkness for a shadow.
Stranger, wilt thou know my history? Write, and I will tell it.

I am Esar the king--king and magician. I have  been a searcher
into that mystic science which deals with those shadowy and phantom
truths which half seek half elude our grasp.  Seeking I knew not what,
I have found what I sought not--strange secrets, wondrous mysteries,
that, when  the time is ripe, shall change the world. T speak not of
these. Without belief in god or goddess, I have learned a better
faith. I bow to the power in matter; I worship its attributes, its
eternity, its strength.  In its boundless mutation, it reaches in its
nobler shapes of life an etherealism and beauty beyond our gross power
of thought. Matter in this pure form, having life, is endowed with all
those gifts which our sages say are hidden in flower and gem. This
much I knew, and I could see no reason why beings of these higher
types should not visit at times this lower world. From such rare
visits come stories of the gods, and legends of love between us poor
dwellers in the flesh and these bright inhabitants of purer spheres.
Might there not be a sympathy, a link, which could draw these glorious
shapes from their clear abodes? Once they might have been as poor, as
coarse as we. I had learned the diamond was but carbon, could be that
again; and though when diamond it has completed its change, it has
passed through the furnace which purifies, and wears now the highest
form its matter can take--yet it can +fall.+  It can go back to dust
again. Could these do the same? In those serene heights, where these
lustrous forms of matter dwelt, might some link with our grosser shape
yet reach them, and draw them down?

In their pride, they might deem that for them there was no more
change, which we call death, and no more fire, which some call
gehenna. And truly, when the highest point of their nature was
reached, they must remain there fixed, immutable for ever, unless they
fell. Then they would go back through fading glories, from shade to
shade of sorrow, from shape to shape of pain, perchance of death and
evil, till they sank--whither?--into what?

But could temptation exist for matter in this ethereal shape?
and, if so, could I hope to be the tempter? A daring question--a mad
thought; and yet it came to me again and again. Ah! I tremble even now
in telling why it came. I bad seen a phantom, and yet not a phantom--
a face among the stars--pale, lustrous, beautiful--a vision such as I
had deemed one of the dwellers on the heavenly hills might be.

My flesh quivered with hope as I thought that this unveiling of
her face to me was in itself a fall--a looking back to things
discarded. And she drew nearer, nearer to me every time I saw her. By
infinite longings, I drew her on. I cast from out my heart a spell
that a wizard of the East had taught me. I wrought about the air a
mighty incantation. O, I called her to me by a voice of anguish--a
voice of joy--a voice of unfathomable yearning. My will was like iron
and adamant; the threads of light that streamed from my hands and hair
went towards her, dragging her down, down, ever downwards. What
mattered it to me that she suffered? What mattered it that I was
tempting her into death and sin? Tempting! no, it was she who was the
tempter. How dared she unveil her face to me as I lay lonely on the
mountain? I, a boy, and she a dweller among the stars! It was years
ago when her eyes first met mine; and had I not passed through fire
since then? I had waded to a throne through blood, and reached the
heights of magic lore through pain unspeakable, all for her. Then let
her come, and suffer and die like me.

Nearer--bring her nearer, even if every lower change be a torture
beyond the power of flesh to imagine.  Nearwer!  She +shall+ come to
me.  Ages ago, when the world was newborn, she was a woman.  She  can
be a woman again. The diamond can  change, and she  shall change, even
if she pass through fire.

There was some flaw, some spot in her beauty, or she would not
have shown her face to me on the mountain. In that serene sphere, a
thousand worlds above me, this flaw had wrought a sympathy between us--
this had unveiled the vision of her face as I lay lonely on the hill-
top, dreaming like a boy. What was this hideous spot upon my soul,
that linked me with her? A spot that in her a thousand fires had not
burned out and purified. And this was bringing her down nearer--nearer-
-ever nearer.

In that vision on the mountain in the far East, where the ice
lies piled, she was so far above me, that when I threw my longing arms
upwards, and strained my eyes towards her, my very heart wept for
sorrow, and, gathering all my blood, it left my face white as the snow
by which I lay.  0, it was horrible to feel the sharp pain that
quickened me as I gazed, and knew she was countless worlds above me.
And yet there was a road between us. A long, long ray of light spanned
worlds like bridges, and went from star to star, till it lighted on
her face. By this she could come to inc. The light ended here, at my
left hand, no higher than my heart, at which it strained with cruel
strength. How dared she do it? I would bring her down hither, and
teach her in this lower world what it was to puffer. She should not
from heights sublime show me her lustrous face only to torture and to
madden.

O that I could find out the flaw in her, that sent out this line
of fire bridging all the worlds till it reached my heart, and linked
her with me in unspeakable pain and passion!

At night I outwatched the stars, and once in every moon I had a
vision of that pale lustrous face, growing sadder, unutterably sadder,
yet nearer. O ecstasy, joy, and faintness of the heart-nearer !

Star after star was crossed. I could count the worlds now that
stood between us. I could measure the line of fire she traversed as I
drew her on; paler and paler grew her face; and once, in the anguish
of her eyes, I thought 1 read a prayer, a cry sent out across the
stars:

&quot;0 man, cruel and relentless, release me from this spell!·
Believe and strive, and thou shalt rise to me. In this lower world,
far beneath the one from which thy hand hath drawn me, lo, I will wait
for thee! These meadows of asphodel, this sky of ringed jasper will
seem to thee a paradise; and I will be content to linger here, till I
can bear thee up to that bright star from whence, through blight and
pain and fiery death, thou hast cruelly dragged me down.&quot;

I smiled at her prayer. And in the incantation I wrought that
night I held a bird above the flame of my lamp till its life was
scorched away. Then looking from my window, I saw the dying bird, this
cruel symbol of my burning love, had drawn her from the star whence
her prayer came, and her face was whiter, sadder, more human than I
had seen her yet.

I burst into a wild laugh of joy, and flung the fluttering bird
from my hand upwards into the darkness. But, alas, my joy was
premature! For months she moved not from that star; and when I saw her
faintly visible across the ray, me-thought there gleamed . upon her
face a look of scorn. This maddened me, but I would not desist or
tremble at her frown. In the days to come I .would' be greater and
nobler than she; for though she was worlds above me now, and I was
only man, and she I knew not what, yet she +had been+ woman; and by
all her remembrance of that time, by her bitterness and sorrow, by her
slavery--for are they not all slaves, these women?--by all my rights
as man and master, I would draw her down and bring her to my side, a
slave again.

I wrought my incantation with double power. I strove with soreery
and magic-names the multitude give to science; I plunged into the
deepest secrets of life and
death to bring her down, and vainly!  Across the abyss of worlds her
eyes met mine, proudly defiant still. Then I saw the flaw within her,
by which I had hoped to bring her across the death and flame of these
lower stars, was not earthly love, and I must seek a stronger spell
than the one in my burning heart, if I wished for
victory.

I journeyed to the East for counsel. The learning of the West
looks downwards, on the earth, dealing with things of time; but the
wisdom of the East soars into heights serene, where truth, guarded
mystically, sits enthroned, untroubled,
and unchanged for ever.

To an aged man, who held the melancholy secret of lengthening his
days, I told my tale. His eye kindled as he listened.

&quot;If thou wilt grant my prayer, I will give thee a talisman that
shall win her,&quot; he said.

&quot;Speak!&quot; I answered. &quot;What is thy request?&quot;

&quot;My son, there will linger with her some faint memory of the
worlds above; let her be mine for a year, that I may learn her wisdom,
and lighten this earth somewhat of its sorrow.&quot;

&quot;Thine!&quot; I cried, indignant. &quot;Shall I draw her down from the
upper spheres to give her to the arms of a skeleton?&quot;

&quot;A touch of earthly sorrow, a clasp from earthly passion,&quot;
replied the sage, &quot;would destroy any clinging memory of the spheres;
from these I wish to save her for one little year. In that brief span
I trust to gather from her still pure lips some mighty secrets, to
bless a groaning world. Dost thou begrudge her so short a time of
peace, during which she shall be to me as mine own child?&quot;

I remained angry and silent.

&quot;Think not,&quot; continued the sage sadly, &quot;that this being, who is
linked to thee by some strange flaw in thy soul and in hers, will
remain unchanged on earth. She will sink lower and lower, until she
pass from this planet into some outer and less happy world. Bethink
thee, spare her; forego thy purpose, and ask naught of my skill.&quot;

&quot;Spare her! No; she shall be mine, though she sink to the lowest
deep, and curse me as she dies.&quot;

The cunning sage had spoken thus to try me. Coldly curious and
cruel, he, too, would have killed her, to add one secret to his
science.

&quot;For the sake of the wonders her eye hath seen and her ear
heard,&quot; he answered, &quot;which her lips shall recount to me, that I may
change the face of the world and lighten toil and sorrow, I, too,-am
willing she should come and suffer. But I claim my compact. For a year
she must be my slave, being to me even as a cherished daughter.&quot;

I could do naught else but yield, though his request seemed to me
harder than death, A year! She was to be on earth a year, and I was
not to see her, not to touch her hand, not to tell her that I loved
her!

Still, I bound myself by an oath that no man could break and
live. And then, through months of mystic study, I learnt from the sage
the secret that should win her. Yet one thing we still lacked, and the
knowledge of this the sage gained from me in a sleep into which, he
threw me. In my sleep I saw a deep cave, dark save for a purple light
gleaming on the roof. And the cave was filled with a sea like blood;
and wading through it, I drew down the light, and with it I clasped
the hands of the far-off vision that 1 loved, quenching the light in
the sea, and we both left m darkness.

&quot;A sad vision for thee, my son,&quot; said the sage. &quot;Pause even now:
quench not the light of mercy in thy heart, lest the darkness of
cruelty and of passion cover thee as with a sea of blood.&quot;

I was deaf to his voice. Then he took from a casket a rare gem.

&quot;All starry things have their type on earth,&quot; he said; &quot;and I
have found hers in this stone, which not all the fires of the burning
mountains can cleanse.&quot;

He showed me a sapphire of purest blue, except for one spot,
blood-red, which shone within it.

&quot;But for this flaw, it would he the fairest in the world,&quot; he
said; &quot;this blemish will one day split it into atoms. Take it; it is a
talisman. When the spot shines red, she will be drawing nearer; when
it waxes pale, she will be escaping thee.&quot;

We parted, and I went my way exulting. Soon, through the ring I
wore, I should know the sin-spot in her that drew her back to earth.

Shall I tell the catalogue of evil deeds I did, hoping to redden
the spot in the gem? No, the list is too long and ghastly. Enough,
that one day a slave vexed me, and I cried in anger,

&quot;Throw him to the lions!&quot;

As they flung the boy--he was a pretty child--before the jaws of
the beasts, I saw my ring flash and sparkle as with joy. A moment
before I had been half sorry, and would have snatched the lad from
those cruel teeth, but now I threw mercy and sorrow to the winds. I
had found the spot in her--I had found the craving in myself--a thirst
for blood--we were vampires both. And this was the dread link that
drew her on; this dragged her back to earth across that ray of fire no
eye saw but mine.

From that day T strove no more with my sin. What cared I who bled
and suffered, so she came to me? The captives I took in war perished,
my prisoners groaned, my slaves trembled. And to see these things, she
drew nearer--nearer every day. Not once a moon now, but nightly, the
pale lustrous face was visible to my sight. At length I saw across a
chasm of the sky, nearer than the moonlight, her eyes fixed on mine,
mournfully, with tears in them.

Tears! I was mad with joy, Tears! Had she come so near earth that
she could weep? A little while, and bitterer tears than these should
be her portion, for she would be a woman and a slave, and I, her
master, would command her love.

Looking up, I saw her face again, her long hair floating among
the stars, and her eyes raining tears, gazing back in painfulness on
the glory she had lost. I was jealous of her grief. Down here, I too
would make her weep, and her tears should have a keener salt than now;
she should tread on thorns, and wear an iron crown of anguish on her
head. Why had she tortured me so long? She should never weep again
among the stars for her lost home. I hoarded tears for her here.

From my youth for her I bad been a stargazer, a madman; and for
years I had waded in blood to reach her. She should come, she should
kneel at my feet and ask for mercy; that mercy which, for her sake, I
had cast away for ever.

So the moon waned, and her face drawing ever nearer no longer
looked defiant or proudly sad, but there grew a fear upon it, which I
rejoiced to see. I had steeled my heart in cruelty. I wore the
sapphire ever, and the spot in it was blood-red and bright as is the
heart of the sunset.

The last night of her stay in the sky the clouds were black with
thunder and with rain, and amid the lightnings her face shone so near,
it, seemed even at my window. I bent forward arid would have kissed
her, but a crashing thunderbolt rent the earth open at my feet, and 1
fell blinded by the flash.

PART THE SECOND.
I LAY sick a week, and when I woke to sense again, there seemed
to be on my brain only a dimmed memory of the past. I was heavy and
full of sorrow. They brought me dancing-girls, and men and women
singers, but I looked and listened without pleasure. And I grew
sadder, for the sky was empty; her face no longer shone on mine
through the shadowy mists of the night, and I knew she walked on
earth.

How should I find her? I proclaimed throughout the land that I
would choose a wife, and the loveliest damsels were brought before me,
all thirsting to be queens. But +her+ face was not among them, and I
turned wearily away, not caring to glance twice on that long line of
flashing eyes.

Vexed at this, the people murmured--so many disappointed maidens
returning home bred discontent--and my counsellors pressed me to
marry. &quot;A caravan had entered the city,&quot; they said, &quot;bringing
merchants, who had for sale a slave of rare beauty; a damsel of
fifteen, who spoke no language, and whose eyes were wondrous sad.&quot;

She was brought before me. And shining pale among the tresses of
her fair hair floating to her feet was the face I knew. With a bound
at my tightened heart I recognised her, and my lips grew white, and my
eye gleamed with a joy fierce as madness.

&quot;Kneel before the king,&quot; said the merchant gravely.

But she fixed her eyes on mine, and standing up defiant with her
small hands folded beneath her hair, she bowed only, smiling with sad
scorn at the man's behest.

&quot;Pardon her,&quot; said the merchant, &quot;she is an untaught maiden.&quot;

&quot;Whence comes she?&quot; I asked with trembling lips.

&quot;I know not, 0 king. In the midst of the great storm we found her
at the edge of the wilderness, weeping beneath a rock.&quot;

&quot;And she hath not told thee of what country she is?&quot;

&quot;We understand not her language; but thou, O king, art learned as
the stars; wilt thou not try some strange tongue in her ears?&quot;

I spoke to her in many tongues, but she continued mute till her
eyes fell upon the ring I wore, then suddenly, with a bitter cry, she
clasped her hands above her head and sank down and wept, hiding her
face in her hair.

How beautiful she looked thus! How I rejoiced in her tears!
showing she was of the earth now--a veritable woman, ready to weep
with the weakest,--ready to tremble at a word.

With my eyes fastened on her, I asked her price of the merchant;
and he named a sum that would have bought a province, but I bade my
treasurer count the money to him, and with a deep obeisance he left
me.

Then, rising from my throne, I went towards her, and setting
aside the shining tresses of her hair, I gazed upon her face. Swift
blushes rose upon her cheek, chasing each other into paleness; then
her lip trembled, and her eyes filled again with tears--indignant
tears, like those I had seen upon her face when it shone upon me from
the stars, when she was worlds away--unattainable, not a woman and a
slave as she was now. There arc no words to tell my triumph and my
joy.

&quot; Mine from across distant stars,&quot; I whispered. &quot;Say, art thou
content to love me, maiden?&quot;

I took her by the slender wrist, and she, frightened and
quivering like the aspen, knelt suddenly and pressed her lips upon my
hand. Then bending her forehead to the ground, she remained at my feet
silent.

I stooped to raise her, to clasp her in my arms, hut a voice at
the door drew me back.

It was the Eastern sage.

&quot;Justice, O king!&quot; he cried. &quot;A certain merchant hath found my
slave in the wilderness, and he hath sold her to thee unrighteously.
Lo! she kneeleth before thee now.&quot;

Then drawing near to me he whispered, &quot;Remember thine oath!
Thinkest thou that such a man as I knew not the hour and the place in
which to seek her? It is well that I am come.&quot;

I crossed my eyes with my hands that I might not see her go, and
he led the maiden away.

The year passed, that was a century long, and I had waited
patiently, mindful of my oath; but now I trembled with ire, for a
missive had reached me from the East:

&quot;The maiden was mute, she knew no tongues of earth. I have taught
her language. Let her abide with me another year, that I, who have
given her speech, may learn from her that starry lore, which leaveth
her memory swiftly as the shadows fly the noonday sun. Vex not thyself
for this delay; think of the power and wisdom we shall gain for man.&quot;

Wisdom! What cared I for his foolish dreams? I would not wait
another day.
I declared war against the King of the East, and we fought battles in
which no tongue could number the slain. But I issued a decree sparing
the women and children; and when victory was proclaimed with the sound
of trumpet, and the noise of shouting, I sat in my tent while the
captives were brought before me.

Weeping they came--a long line of women with dishevelled hair,
and garments dusty and travel-soiled; chained and weary they trailed
their limbs past my tent, turning streaming eyes upon me, and holding
out imploring hands to beg for mercy. The long, long line went by,
with passionate cries and wails of anguish, but +she+ was not among
them. So I heeded not their tears, their sorrow, or their beauty.
Lastly came the king's daughters with their garments of divers colours
rent, and ashes on their heads, and they passed by in proud
bitterness, for I had given them for slaves to my camel-driver, to be
his hewers of wood and drawers of water.

Thus the day of the victory went down in darkness, and there was
revelry in the camp mingled with the cries of the captives and the
groans of the dying. But I was sad. She was no nearer than when, a
dreaming boy, I saw her face among the stars. She was slain, or
perchance the spoiler had seized her for a prey. Even as I thought
thus, the curtain of my tent was lifted by the guard, and there stood
by him a man holding a weeping woman by the hand.

&quot;Hidden in the Temple of Baal, 0 king, I found this woman, and,
mindful of thy commands, I bring her hither, no eye having seen her
but mine.&quot;

Carelessly I turned without a hope, and shining in the pale
moonlight, white as a marble goddess, I met her face.

&quot;Reward him with the reward of a prince,&quot; I said to the guard,
&quot;and let him go.&quot;

The curtain of my tent was dropped, and we were left alone.
Greedily my eye drank in the pallid beauty of her face, the grief in
her tear-streaming eyes, the glory of her dishevelled hair, and the
scarlet of her trembling lips. Her mantle was stripped from her
shoulders, and I saw upon her white arm the cruel mark of the
soldier's hand, as he had dragged her by force to my tent. Upon her
small wrists hung heavy shackles, and with their weight her hands
drooped powerless, and her limbs shook as she knelt before me, and
laid her forehead in the dust.

I raised her, and she trembled exceedingly, crossing her chained
hands upon her bosom, and standing pale and still before me as marble
that breathes. Then I set aside her flowing hair--that I had seen
among the stars--and I looked into her eyes--those eyes that I had
lured down from spheres of light. She grew faint beneath my look; her
hands, uncrossed, fell with their chains drooping nearly to the
ground; and her lips, blanching with a terror that was half joy,
murmured tenderly:

&quot;Great king, thine eyes are as the eagle's in power. I have
dreamed of thee these many days. Let thine handmaid be the least among
thy servants.&quot;

&quot;Thou art my wife and my queen,&quot; I answered. And taking the veil
from her head, I pressed my lips to hers.

Then I proclaimed throughout the camp that I had found my queen,
and I made my bridal amid the rejoicings of my soldiers, and the cries
of enemies 'and captives. As I apparelled my bride in royal robes and
put the crown upon her head, I whispered:

&quot;Ask what I shall give thee, and it shall be thine, even, to half
my kingdom.&quot;

&quot;Give me,&quot; she answered, and her lips smiled, &quot;the head of the
old man who has kept me from thee for a year.&quot;

I sent swift messengers to the temple, where he had taken refuge,
and returning they laid the gift at her feet.

We journeyed to the royal city in state, and seated on my throne,
with my bride veiled on my right hand, all peoples and nations came
before us to do us homage. Then I made a great feast for many days to
my princes and nobles, and I caused her to come before them unveiled
that her beauty might be seen. And they said she was fairer than the
fairest of the daughters of women, and wiser than the wisest of my
counsellors. Thus I had honour in their sight for my choice.

But, alas, she was cruel; and this flaw in her nature craved at
my hand deeds that made the world shudder. When slaves were tortured,
when captives died, when the people perished, she loved me more. And
what would I not do for her love?

Among my slaves there was one who was my friend. He had been
taken captive a child, and given to me for a playmate. He was a
barbarian, a man of great stature and of singular aspect, for his hair
was yellow, and his eyes wore the colour of a pale sky. This man she
hated, and she asked his life of me many times, but I put her off with
fair words. And to appease her I put into her hand the lives of kings
and princes, or the lives of maidens saved from the spoil. Of these
she made sport for herself and the women of the palace by flinging
them to the lions, or making them fight with beasts as is the manner
of some nations. Thus I saved my friend for awhile.

But one day she invited me to a banquet of wine, and when my
heart was merry she knelt down at my feet, and lifting her silver veil
she leaned her cheek on my hand, and murmured low sweet words of love.

I gazed down upon her beautiful face, and my heart trembled with
joy. Ah, I loved her so dearly! I had lured her from the spheres to be
mine; for me she had left glories of which my dull mind could not
dream. Should I begrudge her aught in return? True, she had forgotten
the lore of the stars; but in her mood at times I saw a sadness that I
alone could understand. I recognised a craving that no earthly thing
could fill.

On her life, before the merchants found her on the edge of the
wilderness, she was silent.

&quot;What do I know?&quot; she would say. &quot;I remember nothing. My life
began on the day I saw you. And yet we had met before. Ah, where? Tell
me, cruel man, when you first put your spell upon my soul.&quot;

Thus we talked with kisses, I laughing at her fancies. But in
secret I repented the death of the sage, to whom, doubtless, she had
told much of that starry lore, which earthly love had banished from
her heart.

Suddenly, as  her warm  cheek pressed my hand, I felt tears upon
it. Tears! I had never seen her weep since the day I had placed a
crown upon her head, and taken the chains from her hands, and now her
grief startled me.

&quot;My beloved, why dost thou weep? Are not all the riches of India
thine, and from the borders of the wilderness, even to the land
shadowed by the sun, are not the people thine? Thou shalt harrow them
with harrows of iron, if thy soul desires it, or make them pass
beneath a yoke of steel.&quot;

&quot;0 king, live for ever!&quot; she answered; and she bowed her head to
the ground till her shining hair touched my feet. &quot;All these things
are mine, and yet I am weary, because thou dost not love me.&quot;

Then I hasted to raise her in my arms, and I put my own crown
upon her head and kissed her.

&quot;I love thee better than my throne, my kingdom, and my people.
See, have I not put all their lives in thy hand?&quot;

&quot;What are the lives to me of a thousand princes, when thou keepest
from me the life of one barbarian? A slave is dearer in thine eyes
than I am.&quot;

And taking the crown from her brow, where I had placed it, she
laid it on the couch as a thing of naught, while she sat upon the
ground and wept. Then she tore the jewels from her hair and the
bracelets from her arms, and laid them at my feet.

&quot;Take back thy gifts, great king! Without thy love they are to me
as nothing. And now slay me if thou wilt, for what good shall my life
do me, seeing, my soul is weary even unto death?&quot;

Alas, for my weakness! I gave her the life of the man who had
been to me as a brother. Even with her arms about my neck and her
thanks in my ear I was sorry,
and I quitted her heavy with grief. I had stood silent when her soft,
silvery voice gave its cruel order's:

&quot;Seize Attilins the barbarian, and carry him chained to the
lowest dungeon. Build in the night a scaffold beneath my windows, and
in the morning bring him forth that I may see him die. And I will
fling his heart to the dogs of the city.&quot;

In the night, as I lay sleepless, I cast about in my thoughts how
I should save the man, and yet not have a warfare daily with the woman
I loved. &quot;If he might escape to some distant land,&quot; I said.

I arose, I took with me two mutes, and I went to the door of the
dungeon. Between the bars I passed him my hand.

&quot;Attilius, draw the ring from my finger, and when the warder
comes at dawn give him this signet, and demand fleet horses, then flee
for thy life.&quot;

&quot;My king! my brother!&quot; returned the captive, &quot;what is my life
that thou shouldst save it? The queen--&quot;

&quot;Name her not,&quot; I answered. &quot;Take the ring quickly.&quot;

He put forth his shackled hand, and drew the signet from my
ringer; and I, with lightened heart, returned to my couch and slept. I
awoke to the noise of a tumult and the clash of swords. The rest
seemed to me like a dream.

I was dethroned. I was a prisoner. I was to die.

Attilius reigned in my stead, and on the throne by his side sat
the woman I had loved.

PART THE THIRD.
THEY spared my life.

&quot;Let him live,&quot; said the woman, as she placed the hand of
Attilius on her head. &quot;Death is momentary; we can make life harder to
him than death. Let him live in misery and iron, under scourge and
torture; let him live, and pray to die.&quot;

&quot;Let him live,&quot; repeated Attilius.

Then rising from her throne, she hastened to bow before Attilius,
with her fair face touching the dust, and sweet low words of thanks
dropping from her red lips.

That night they had me up from my dungeon to make sport for them,
as they sat together after their bridal feast. I heard her slavish
words; I saw her kisses and her false smiles. He was a sterner man
than I--a greater tyrant; to him she was not a queen, but a slave. A
year passed thus, and I knew she wearied. I lived in a secret dungeon;
the people thought me dead.

One day when luxury, cruelty, power weighed heavy on her, she
sent a slave to fetch me from my prison.

&quot;Esar,&quot; she said, and her proud lip shook, &quot;tell me the secret of
my birth, and I will free you from your chains. You shall sleep on a
soft couch, and eat no more the bread of bitterness.&quot;

&quot;What have I to tell you?&quot; I answered.

Her face flushed, and her eyes filled with tears--those large sad
tears that I bad seen among the stars.

&quot;I have dreams, horrible dreams of what I was,&quot; she said. &quot;At
times, like one in a strange madness, I see abodes of crystal, where
happiness was pure, not hot and cruel, as it is here. Then waking, I
loathe myself and you. Surely, it is your power, your sorceries, that
have dragged me through shame and misery. These hands, that in Elysian
fields gathered lilies, have worn chains; and I, who have visions of
gods who loved me, have learned to bow down to swine in human shape.
Have I not lain with my face to the earth before the slave Attilius?
And knowest thou that at times he fails to hold out the golden sceptre
that bids me rise, and I kneel trembling, knowing not if I snail live.
I fear death, because a voice within me says that I have fallen, and
must fall still lower, into some worse pain than this. 0 that death
were freedom! for I hate--I hate this life. One sole pleasure has been
mine: I have drunk blood like water; it has done me good to see men
die. Thee 1 hate too much to kill. Thinkest thou I ever loved? Ah, no;
but the man who wears that talismanic ring makes me his slave. I was
yours; you gave it to Attilius, and I was his. I cannot pluck it from
him; I am withheld by pangs not human, when I would put forth my hand
and take it from his finger. Alas! what have I not  suffered, since
lured from some great height I woke to weep on the edge of the
wilderness! Scorn and shame and chains have been mine-I who had come
from gardens of lilies, where perfume and music are our breath, awoke
in the desert, amid sand that scorched, and rocks that cut the flesh.
And as I wept, strangers came to me. Did they give me succour? No;
because I was defenceless, I was a prey; and because I was a woman, I1
was a slave. They put chains upon me, and sold me; and you who bought
me looked for thanks. I gave them, for you wore a gem whose slightest
flash thrilled through my flesh in an anguish that subdued, as the
lash subdues the tiger. This is the secret of the talisman; let any
man wear it hating me, and I die; such flesh as mine could not bear
that pain and live.

&quot;Nay, stop me not; I finish quickly. I, who had been so great,
came to you in chains--chains worn for you; for my heart tells me it
was you whose wicked incantations lured me from some far world to this
star of death and sin. Was that enough? No; you yielded me to a cold
tyrant, who would have cut my veins in pieces to learn the secrets my
dumb lips could not speak. He early found the secret of my nature, and
ruled through cruelty. With chains and stripes and darkness he drew
from me those dim memories that I would fain have kept sealed up for
ever. And having in my soul this half-formed sense of beauty and of
glory, from which I had fallen, I suffered in these low tortures a
depth of pain your grosser clay can never feel. What are your chains
to mine? Do you marvel now that I hate you? Then listen--the catalogue
of your sins against me is not done. When your armies came, the old
man, who through my woe hoped to learn the mysteries of tho stars, hid
me in the temple of his god. Thence, scarcely escaping the rude
soldiery, I was brought to you in chains--yours now by right of
conquest, the captive of your bow and spear. It pleased you to put a
crown upon my brow; it pleased you to lay your head upon my breast;
but had it been your pleasure that I should wear the shackles of a
slave, and bear the scourge while I ground your corn, I must have worn
the yoke and bowed submissive to your tyranny. Now say, shall I be
grateful because you fulfilled your pleasure? Why with those gaunt
eyes do you weep your own woes? If I tore you limb from limb, I could
not pay you back what you have made me suffer.

&quot;No, I am not mad. There is madness on this earth, too--a shape
of pain more merciful than some. O star, ethereal and pure, wherein I
once wandered beautiful, look down upon my anguish, and if there be
within thy rays forgetfulncss, pour them on my scorched brain and
wither it!&quot;

Here she stayed the torrent of her words a moment, and looked out
upon the starry night, whose deep blue shone calm above us. The sight
made her bosom heave, and her small hands, clenched, tore at her white
flesh.

&quot;Lost, lost for ever! 0 cruel man, to find out the flaw I had
hidden from the. gods, and lure me hither to this hard world, through
that one sin-spot!&quot;

Then, turning to me, she laughed; and this sudden laughter was
horrible.

&quot;And shall you escape the judgment of the gods? Tyrant and
sorcerer, I tell you no! In my womanly impatience, I have hurried the
day of vengeance. I should have waited. 1 prayed Attilius to draw the
signet from your finger, and kill you, and for reward I offered him my
love; not that I loved him--slaves never love. But he refused, and
then I hated him, and asked his life. I asked with tears and
importunity that night, because I knew he had resolved to break his
silence, and tell you of my treachery. That was the name he gave it.
Were women free, it might be treachery; but in a slave it is revenge.
He would have died, but you gave him the fatal ring, and from that
moment I was his slave, and he was mine. Like the call I had heard in
the stars, his voice reached me in the night, and I arose and set him
free. I placed him on your throne, and you awoke to a dungeon and to
chains. I have finished.&quot;

&quot;And wherefore tell me this, O queen?&quot; I asked, as I shifted the
heavy chains that hung upon my aching arms.

&quot;Because I am weary. Poison me this man Attilius, and take thy
crown again. Draw the ring from his finger while he sleeps. I will
make him sleep upon my knees. I would liefer be thy slave than his,
for his hand is crueller to me than thine. Kill him, and thou art king
again; refuse, and my slaves shall carry thee back to thy dungeon, and
scourge thee till thou diest.&quot;

&quot;Why should I refuse ?&quot; I answered. &quot;Bring me to the feast to-
night, and thou shalt see my hand is steady when it strikes.&quot;

I came. I knelt before them in my chains, while Attilius, the
barbarian, flung the wine lees on my prison garment, and required of
me a song. I sang of his greatness, his honour, his glory, while the
queen with dainty fingers beat time upon the board. But being heavy
with wine, the song lulled Attilius,. and as he sat upon the velvet
cushions that lay piled upon the floor, he roughly bade the queen draw
near, and take his head upon her knees, and let him sleep. I sang on,
a sweet low song, murmuring of summer life, and slumber among the
flowers in the gardens of Babylon. And the king slept. The great doors
were closed softly, the silken hangings rustled in the perfumed air,
and every footstep in distant corridor and hall died into silence.

Then from beneath her eyelids a look stole forth, a look of
death, that beckoned me; and creeping towards her on the thick
carpets, I bent to hear her whispered words.

She drew a key from his jewelled belt, and placed it in my hand.

&quot;Unlock your chains,&quot; she whispered. The shackles fell, startling
the king, who frowned in his sleep, mid I, with my eyes fixed on him,
drained a goblet of rich wine, for my throat was parched. Then
stretching forth my hand I took the dagger that the traitress held
above the sleeping face of Attilins, and stooping, I stabbed him to
the heart, I rose from that blow a king, and as I drew the mystic
insignia of royalty from the dead man's hand, I felt myself a king
again. Then hastily arraying myself in royal apparel, and with the
crown upon my head, I went forth to the soldiers and the people,

Acclamations rent the air. Nobles, counsellors, and princes
rushed to my side, and my majesty and my glory were strengthened to
me, because secretly the people had chafed at the rule of the
barbarian.

And Attilius' friends, their wives, their children, their kindred
and their slaves, I caused to be cast to the lions.

As morning broke, I returned to my palace, and in the inner hall
the queen met me, and bowed herself before me to the earth.

&quot;Forgive me my madness,&quot; she said. &quot;My tongue has spoken wildly,
for when the stars shine down upon my brain, I am as one who knoweth
not his right hand from his left. Now let me lie in the dust till I am
pardoned, for the king is even as the sun to revive the fainting heart
of the miserable. And who is this dead dog Attilius that his sin and
his rebellion should take from me the favour of my lord the king?
Thine handmaiden is but a slave, and when he was master, I bowed
myself before him, though my heart went not with it; for had he not my
life in his hands?&quot;

With quivering lips, she said this on her knees before me, with
forehead touching the ground. 'And when I answered her not a word, she
covered my feet with tears and kisses. Then I stretched out my hand
above her, the hand that wore the ring; and as she trembled, her
kisses grew hot and quivering, and a cry of fear broke from her lips.

&quot;Pardon, pardon!&quot; she murmured faintly. The anguish in her voice
thrilled through my veins, and made my heart leap up for joy. Again I
saw her as I had seen her among the stars; and it seemed to me a joy
worthy of a king to bring a being once glorious and lovely into this
abject shape, into this breathing beautiful slave at my feet.

I raised her, I clasped her in my arms, I kissed her once, twice,
thrice--the last kiss these lips have ever given--the last joy I ever
knew on earth--the last proof of my weakness and my love. Then, as the
flush upon her cheeks died into leaden paleness, as the flash of
triumph in her eye changed to fear, I thrust her from me, and in a
whisper that thrilled through every ear I said to my Ethiopians:

&quot;Cover her face.&quot;

I could not look upon its beauty and condemn her to die.

Veiled in the coarse sackcloth which scarcely stifled her cry,
and held in the strong hands of the guard, she heard her sentence:

To be clothed in a slave's garment, and bare-footed and face
uncovered, holding the head of the traitor Attilius in her hands, and
with shackles upon her wrists, she was to be led three days through
the streets of the great city, while heralds proclaimed before her:
&quot;Thus shall it be done to the slave that rebels against her master!&quot;
And for these three days no man, upon pain of death, should give her
food or water.

I looked not out from the palace, windows to see that sad
procession; but spectators shuddering told me ,that on. the second day
her eyes were dry and bloodshot, her lips cracked, her feet torn and
bleeding; and on the third day it was only the thongs of the slaves
that forced her along.

I heard the sharp crackle of the whips as she passed the palace,
and I wondered if her thoughts went back to the wine-feasts and the
early days of my love, or whether, further still, they wandered to
that dim time when she lived, glorious and free, in some bright world
where sin and death enter not.

At the palace gate she fell, and with a shriek that rang from out
her lips in a curse upon my race, she died.

My kingdom was established, my power strengthened; I reigned from
India to the Red Sea. All the treasures of the earth are mine, and men-
slaves and women-slaves bow down before me; but my sorrow is greater
than I can bear, and even as I speak I perish. For at night, in my
sleep, there fastens upon my heart a vampire who lives upon my blood.

I have called together my physicians and my soothsayers, and even
from Egypt have I brought magicians; but their skill availeth not.  I
die; and I know this vampire is the woman I loved.

No hand can touch her. She fleeth like a shadow, she escapeth
every net, every toil, and every weapon. In vain slaves watch my
sleep, and soldiers guard it. She comes silently, like the shades of
the dead come, and with cold lips shy draws away my life.

I loved her; in this dread sleep I love her still; and as she
drains my blood, I cover her with kisses of love, and tears that cry
for pardon. I awake with a start of anguish, the death-drops upon my
brow, and, lo, she is gone! Then through my palace there rings a low
cry of pain, and a whisper of fear passes from lip to lip: &quot;Upon the
heart of the king there lieth a vampire, and his day goeth down, in
darkness.&quot;

The pen with which I write: for Esar the king' drops from my
weary fingers, and with my hand resting upon this dry heap I look
across the dreary waste and see the phantoms of my brain vanish. The
gorgeous palace, the temples, the kingly streets, the hanging gardens,
lie beneath my hand in this mound. Upon the arid plain I see only
these heaps crumbling in the shadowless sun; and the crown of Esar,
his glory, his power, and his might, fall from my fingers, as I shake
from them the dust I gathered up on the plains of Babylon.
