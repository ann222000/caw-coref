Wrong Wireless Router on Slackware 12

I'm well into the process of moving from Windows to Linux.  I can
handle most of the problems myself, but there are a handful that have
me fairly baffled.  I thought I'd post a few of them over the next
month and see if anyone here has a thought.

Problem 1:  I have an AcerPower 1000 with one of those $#%@) Broadcom
Wireless chips that doesn't work with the Linux Broadcom driver.
Against all odds, ndisdriver actually works and it only took be about
16 hours to set it up.  Worked fine under Slackware 11.  On Slackware
12.0, it works ... except ...

If I run the following commands manually, everything is fine:

modprobe ndiswrapper
modprobe ndiswrapper ESSID51 WRT54GK
ifconfig eth0 down
ifconfig wlan0 up
#iwconfig wlan0 ESSID WRT54GK           #This doesn't help
#iwconfig wlan0 ap 00:18:F8:BD:59:78  #Nor does this
dhcpcd wlan0

If I run the same commands in /etc/rc.d/rc.local, the wireless
interface works but instead of connecting to the router called
WRT54GK, it picks a router according to some set of arbitrary rules
that are opaque to me.  Sometimes it is WRT54GK and everything is
fine.  Sometimes it is my kid's router which has a different ID and is
on a different subnet.  Not so good.  So mostly I just use the wired
eth0 interface.

iwlist scanning shows both routers.

Someday I'd like to get rid of the 50 foot patch cable running under
beds, through a closet and across the hall.

Anyone have any thoughts?

Take a look at the wireless section of /etc/rc.d/rc.inet1.conf its here
ndiswrapper should be loaded from and all setting like ESSID are read

Why did you change from 11 to 12?  Perhaps you should simply go back
to 11?  Or perhaps you should just stay with windows in the fist

The rules aren't &quot;arbitrary.&quot;  Nothing in computing is ever
&quot;arbitrary&quot;, be definition.

If your purpose is to connect to the internet and your system does
it fine using windoze, then there is no reason to change to linux.
And, if you do need to change, there is no reason to change from
Slackware 11 to 12 if 11 works ok.  And according to you, 11 works
ok.

If so, I can see why he hates you: you obviously know something about

I recalled that I haven't put that line anywhere yet.

That line is a command I ran in xterm (konsole) as root.  It works.  From
several different broadcasting wireless routers, it hooks up only to the
specified router.

But I also recalled that I'm using the madwifi driver and tools whereas you
reported ndis in your case.

Thus you may need to discover if equivalents to the (above, ie iwconfig)
listed madwifi tools command exist for or when using ndis.  Or, are some of
the tools interchangeable back and forth between ndis and madwifi?

I didn't care to &quot;fool&quot; Linux into using a Windows driver (ndis).

So I looked the Linux HCL for wireless card and then got my pcmcia card.

Didn't I have to go:

ifconfig ath0 up

(wlan0 for you rather than ath0)

first, before the above iwconfig command.  I can't remember and laptop is
not on at the moment.

I just saw your orig post once again, that you had it working using
modprobe.

I'm not up on ndis and the difference in the tools commands between madwifi
and ndis.

I'm unaware if your listed modprobe command is totally correct or not. (I
*do question* it since modprobe loads kernel module).

Probably you need to verify about the correct command/method in ndis to tell
it to hook up only to a certain router.

Where's the ndis doc/man/howto's/articles at?

It just occurred to me how similar the names Dan C and Tom N are.
Neither use periods after their last initial, both of which are
consonants. They both have three-letter first names,
consonant-vowel-consonant.  The names are common nicknames for Daniel and
Thomas, which both have six letters in them.  If you take their names, add
a &quot;u&quot;, an rearrange them, you get &quot;damn count.&quot;  Is it more likely that
those are all coincidences, or that Dan C == Tom N?

The regulars are more concerned with suppressing any deviations from
the mandates of the living god PV than they are with discussing Slackware.

PV has decreed that KDE is to be the user interface used by Slackers,
and therefore it's written in stone and not to be questioned by mere
mortals.

(Yes, that's sarcasm.)

So instead of participating in what could be a truly edifying discussion,
they have heaped abuse upon me, much of it quite subtle, but abuse
never-the-less.

Trolling, thus adding to the problem.

Helmut has decided that I am a troll for daring to deviate from the
Party Line. (National Socialists Party, Slackware Branch?)

And more than half of the regulars respond to Dan C's and Realto Margarino's
posts (they are both the same person, as are half of the 'other' trolls)
on a regular basis.

You reap what you sow.

Nobody's telling ME what I can talk about, I can assure you that.
I'll see this group destroyed before I'll allow that to happen.

Okay. Time for you to shut your punk mouth. I'll do what I want

I'll find out who was responsible and I'll hurt them and I'll get

You know, Beej, it just occurred to me that the puzzle I am trying to solve at the
moment, is KDE, the Korporate Desktop Environment: www.kde.org

The more I examine it, the more it becomes obvious that it is nothing but a collection
of programs, apps and utilities, that are knitted together by a menu tree.

All I have to do to create the shell equivalent, a shell desktop, is to create a bash menu
tree that has all of the equivalent programs. Because I run X, I could use many of the K
programs, but since the console apps are generally superior, I'd prefer to use them.

No need to have the main menu, or submenus, cluttering up my working screen when I
can have it come up in window 6 at startx  and get there with just Ctrl-t 6. Any app or utility
or script I choose to run from the menu will open in its own window (if any), and I'll automatically
&quot;be there&quot; with it. The menu stays accessible like it is.

So what I'm saying, is that KDE is an illusion. It's a bunch of hype and technocratic
bullshit wrapped in a pretty package. It's just collection of programs knitted together
by a menu tree. Big woo. Some eye-candy to impress the peasants who think that clicking
on a cutesy icon is superior to entering a number.

Sounds good!  Just let us know when you get the site up.

Lots of Linux users do their own thing and heavily optimize their

I already have the menu, but I do so many things with aliases that
it's not as complete as the one used to run KDE.

I'll make it that complete and put it up on my FTP server. It's up
most of the time, though I usually just use it for file sharing with
individuals. (Better than mail attachments).

Although the way I do it now is better. But there's no problem having
the same commands on the menu, too.

How do I remember all those aliases? Mostly because they have clues to their
use expressed in the choice of letters. For example, if I can't remember an
alias I enter the alias &quot;al&quot; and I get a list of them catted to the screen.

alias al='grep ^alias /etc/profile'

Here's a sample of the output:

alias fm='fetchmail &amp;&amp; mutt -y'
alias ls='ls -shF'
alias ff='/usr/bin/firefox &amp;'
alias cw='/sbin/dhcpcd -d'   #clearwire up
alias cwd='/sbin/dhcpcd -k'  #clearwire down
alias v='vi'                 #nvi
alias al='grep ^alias /etc/profile'
alias l='less'
alias sl= `slrn -C- -f /home/hokomo/.jnewsrc-aioe'
alias sp=`slrnpull -d /var/spool/slrnpull -h aioe.org'
alias j='jobs'
alias a='apropos'
alias ftp='ftpserver.sh &amp;'           #ftp server no uploads
alias ftpu='ftpserver-upload.sh &amp;'   #ftp server with uploads
alias cl='watch -t -n 1 date'        # 'clock' with 'secondhand'
alias li='links -html-numbered-links 1 -enable-javascript 1 -html-tables 1 -html-frames 1 -html-image-names 1'
...

Thanks for that, Beej. I think I can take it one step further and create a
minimalist replacement for KDE. Am trying.

What I really need is to be good enough with awk to be able
to write a script that will allow a user to easily edit the
menu script and alias file, entering their own choices of
applications. No reason that I can't bundle screen and ratpoison
along with the menu and other scripts, in the same package...

Total would only be about 1M, unpacked, and they could both
be pre-configured for a default layout, including the xinitrc.

Got an awk book coming in by UPS any day now.

Dan C and I have the following in common.

a) We have both served our respective communities in uniform, he in the
Military, (either the US Navy or the Marine Corps I seem to recall), I
in one of the 'Civil' Uniformed services.

b) We are both male and both retired from our respective services.

From those common points we begin to differ, he has probably been
decorated more than I. He is, to the best of my knowledge, both a
resident and citizen of the US, I am a resident and citizen of one the
English speaking Nations/States of Europe. If you can't differentiate
by reading the headers to our respective posts then that is yet another
skill you may wish to acquire, as you recently did in discovering that
Google Groups will provide posting histories for you.

That's embarassing!

So I'm going to alias al to alias...

Har!  As I've told you more than once, Alan, I post under *only* this
