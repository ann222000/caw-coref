Can you bull rush someone in a grapple?  If so, what happens?  Do you
break up the grapple that way or do you push the whole grapple along?
Can you even do suach a thing?

I am a firm believer in &quot;Anything you can think of can happen&quot; so in my game
you could. Depending on the opponents in a grapple, I think you would have
a chance to break the grapple. (it works in wrestling, so why not here?) I
would
set a difficulty class based on

1. size of grapple vs size of rusher: two medium size grapplers are a large
size grapple.

2. number of arms in the grapple: an octipus grappling a human would be
hard to break up, they just can't let go with all those arms!

3. if one grappler is trying to break: If the human is trying to break from
the octopus this should certainly help!

and any other modifiers that you can think of. If you beat the DC then you
add
a size modifier to help break free. If you miss the DC then you push the
grapple
5 feet in the direction of the charge and open yourself up to be grappled.

This kind of a corner case probably isn't covered by the book, but my
ruling would be that both of the grapplers oppose your bull rush check
and you move them according to better of their two checks.

Of course, if one of the grapplers is an ally, they could conceivable
just let you push them, and forgo their check.
