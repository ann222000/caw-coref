What's YouTube?
After $1.65 billion, it's time to learn.

"Google to acquire YouTube for $1.65 billion in stock."

What's YouTube?

Probably the world can be divided in our time between people who really
know what YouTube is and people who don't. No need to be embarrassed if
you're clueless about YouTube. It's hard to keep up. That's because
there is one fact no one will ever challenge: The earth still spins on
its axis every 24 hours, and work and sleep own most of them. Thus we
may posit an iron law of the universe: You can do whatever it is you
choose to do with your few free hours, or you can spend them with
YouTube.

Millions prefer YouTube. So on Monday Google bought it for $1.65
billion. Should you care? I think so.

YouTube.com is a Web site. It entered the World Wide Web in February
2005 with a homepage that said: "YouTube: Broadcast Yourself." The
site's technology lets people create a personal channel and then upload
video to it for everyone to see. That's pretty much it. Why is this
worth $1.65 billion and your idea isn't? Because every day 65,000 new
videos are uploaded to YouTube's site, and every day the world's people
tune into 100 million of these videos. One consultant with time on his
hands has calculated that during YouTube's short life, people have
spent 9,305 years watching it.

A cynic would say YouTube's home-video billions proves investors would
put money in people watching ice melt if the numbers added up. Well,
there are at least 15 videos on YouTube that let you watch ice melting,
including one of a group of Japanese rubbing a block of ice to get at
the coins inside. My own instinct at the news of Google's big buy was
to mock YouTube. Put it this way: The five American scientists who just
won Nobel Prizes probably haven't, nor would they, spend five seconds
on YouTube. But then I paddled my surfboard onto the Web site over a
few days. It may not be long before the Nobelists arrive with videos.

The politicians have already landed. The good news is this means they
won't strangle YouTube in its crib with legislation. The bad news is
the politicians' own videos, or those of their proxies, may give the
site a worse name than the thousands uploading videos of cats playing
Bach and similar whimsies.

News articles have begun to appear noting that some campaigns are
uploading videos to YouTube. The campaigns hire someone with a
camcorder to follow an opponent, film the candidate constantly and post
embarrassing moments on YouTube.

Sen. George Allen was famously caught calling his camcorder stalker a
"macaca." Then there is "Conrad Burns' Naptime," which has had 80,000
views and was put up by his opponent Jon Tester. Or "Rick Santorum
Throws a Tantrum," posted by SantorumExposed, with 57,000 views. In
fact, Sen. Burns is fighting sleep at a committee hearing, which is
unremarkable, and Sen. Santorum didn't throw a tantrum, but simply
argued with a woman about taxes while walking on a street. This is
essentially the embarrassing technique Michael Moore used at the
opening of "Fahrenheit 9/11," catching people in a weak moment.

So the new-media types discovered YouTube and rode its potential
straight to the bottom. If the weak-moment tactic catches on, it will
of course drive what's left of normal people out of politics. More
ironic is that the explicit goal of the YouTube political sites is to
attract the attention of mainstream-media reporters for print and TV,
which is the only way these videos can gain traction. Search YouTube
for video of the Montana debate between Sen. Burns and Jon Tester.
Number of views? A few hundred.

Political videos are just a blip in the vast YouTube ocean. The power
of this site is simply the power of the moving picture, a force not
fully understood since Edison unleashed it. Like Google, the mother of
all search engines, YouTube is a town square where the locals come to
find out things, or now with YouTube, see something--anything.

It is easy to imagine YouTube (or a competitor's site if YouTube blows
it) becoming the repository for most of the world's moving images. The
amateur archivists are already there, finally able to share their
collections with everyone. I typed in "Thelonious Monk." Instantly, I
was watching Monk play "Round Midnight" in Europe in 1964. It is
mesmerizing. Then I watched Keith Jarrett solo in Tokyo in 1984; Chet
Baker, Bill Evans, Barney Kessel; Duke Ellington playing "C-Jam Blues"
in 1942, John Coltrane with Miles Davis, Arthur Rubinstein, Glenn Gould
discussing Bach fugues, Andres Segovia. This was the video experience
of visiting the Morgan Library in New York and looking at famous
writers' original manuscripts.

The list of attendant issues and problems raised is endless, not least
copyright. Or the even more powerful new ethos that it all has to be
"free."

It would be awful, though, if whatever is going on here was driven
underground. This isn't Grokster, where virtually the whole game was
"steal this song." There is a weird, naive innocence about much of
YouTube now. A lot of the videos on YouTube remind me of the garage
bands and living room doo-wop groups of the 1950s. There is a widely
viewed video of a young Korean guitarist named "funtwo," sitting on his
bed and playing a rock version of Pachelbel's Canon with eye-popping
skill.

Do I wish more people chose to spend some of life's precious free hours
listening to Ian McKellan's reading of Robert Fagels's translation of
the Odyssey? Yes, but maybe the publisher should put up a 10-minute
clip of Mr. McKellan doing exactly that to drive buyers to it. And
rather than just trudge cross-country to readings at endless Barnes &amp;
Nobles, might not authors also present their work and ideas in person
on YouTube? (Though not 'til Google gives its partner a decent search
function.) Even a Nobelist might wish to explain his brilliance to a
wider audience than he'll get in Oslo. Stand up a camcorder and start
talking.

In keeping with the times, YouTubers try not to waste yours. Most clips
run under five minutes. Guess they have other things to do.

You Tube appears to be the "Wal-Mart" of the internet.

I think one of the developers of this program is a young man from
St.Paul. It's like performance art, in a way. Have no idea how to
access it from my desktop or laptop, however. The big howl is how mom
is still clinging to her C-64 now doomed to the rec room.
