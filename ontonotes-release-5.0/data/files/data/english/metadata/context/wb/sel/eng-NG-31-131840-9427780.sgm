Out Here In The Fields

Out here in the fields, I fought for my meals.
I get my back into my living.
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right.
I don't need to be forgiven.

Don't cry.
Don't raise your eyes.
It's only teenage wasteland.

THE WHO: &quot;Baba O'Riley&quot; (1971)
Written by Peter Townshend

I can remember when I was in fifth or sixth grade, riding past my
future high school on the bus. At that time, I hung around with a kid
who was somewhat cynically shallow, and said that everything sucked.
That was his take on life, so it didn't surprise me when he said &quot;That
school sucks. It's a punkass school.&quot; However, his words were strangely
prophetic.
My mother told me that my oldest brother Peter thought high school was
a waste of time. I also remember my older sister Charmian told me that
high school should be two years, rather than four. She was right. By
the time I had been in high school six months I had realized that I had
a real problem with high school. The problem I had was, I fucking hated
it.
The place where I went from the years 1996 to 1998, between the ages of
fourteen and sixteen was the Co-operative Arts and Humanities Magnet
High School, in New Haven, Connecticut. They called themselves an arts
magnet school. Bullshit. If a school calls itself an arts magnet
school, it should at least provide for all the art classes, not just
less than half of them. In that respect, they should go all the way, or
fucking forget it, not just go halfway and pussy out. The gym was also
used as an auditorium and the acoustics were so terrible in there, that
someone would have to shout until their voice was gone in order to make
themselves heard while doing a play. I know this, because I acted in
school plays.
Another deplorable aspect of the school was some of the worthless,
backwardass, fuckhard teachers I've had to deal with. Some were stupid,
some were ineffectual, and some were flat-out assholes. It boggled my
mind that they were hired by the school, and it still does. There were
a few good teachers, but most of the smart ones got away.
And those God damned brochures they used to lure kids into the school
sickened me. The idea of it still does. They made the school look all
cute and nice and show people having a good time. When I was a
freshman, they dressed me up as a graduating senior in the brochure,
which was totally lying. The truth is, those brochures were staged and
if it weren't for them and all their gloss and sickly sweet sugary
candy coating, nobody would even go there! In reality, life in that
school sucked.
If you go to a public high school that advertises with brochures, WATCH
OUT! That probably means that the administration at that school
collectively has the sincerity of a used car salesman or an ambulance
chaser.
But even so, I realized by sophomore year that as much as I hated my
school, I didn't want to drop out. All my friends were at the school,
and if I had dropped out, I wouldn't have had anyone to talk to.
Everybody needs friends.
The first two years of high school (especially the second) was one of
the worst times in my life. A fair amount of adversity was dealt to me,
and yet I managed to survive. I guess it's just my Capricorn's
determination that got me through it.

Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere

Every time I think about back home,
It's cool and breezy.
I wish that I could be there right now,
Just passing time.

Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here.
I gotta get away from this day to day running around.
Everybody knows this is nowhere.

NEIL YOUNG: &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; (1969)

I walked off the yellow school bus and looked at the fairly small, red
brick building with excitement and apprehension. I ran my fingers
through my long hair and took a deep breath. Today was the first day of
school, and this place was totally new to me.
As I walked in, I looked around. I felt more and more relaxed. I
figured that since the school was small, I would know my way around
within a week. I was right. I also knew I would make lots of friends
because I consider myself a reasonably outgoing and pleasant person. I
was also right. After about a week in school, I felt somewhat
comfortable.
Around that time I was in Mrs. Morrison's class—physical science. I
didn't mind it at first. The second or third class, we started a
ruckus. The class was boring, so what were we to do? I didn't do much,
just sat back and enjoyed the show, as not to get into trouble. Mrs.
Morrison was talking and writing notes on the board. &quot;The word science
comes from the Latin scire, to know. One of the things we are going to
learn about is the scientific method, which involves hypothesizing,
experimenting, and solving problems.&quot;
She turned around to write some notes on the board. As she was writing,
I heard this noise coming from various areas of the classroom. A noise
like sheep or goats bleating. &quot;Baah. Baaaaah. Baaaaaaaaaah.&quot; The kids
were doing this was because Mrs. Morrison had this annoying goat-like
tone to her voice.
She stopped writing and turned around slowly. &quot;There is a serious
disease that affects people,&quot; she said. It is called Tourette's
syndrome. People with this disease make uncontrollable noises. I have
worked with children who had it. I knew a girl who barked, and a boy
who would shout out expletives. I hope none of you have it.&quot; The class,
me included tried to muffle their laughter, which was next to
impossible to do.
John Lisa sat next to me. He was a short, frail, boy with glasses, a
retainer and close cropped blond hair. He turned to me. &quot;My cousin has
that.&quot; I looked at him. &quot;No kidding?&quot;
&quot;Yeah. He swears uncontrollably. Especially when he loses at video
games. He usually rips the game out and chucks it in the oven. Once he
knocked over the TV and it fell apart because he was playing Sonic The
Hedgehog and Dr. Robotnik stepped on him. He's gone through several
copies of that game.&quot;
&quot;No shit. What does he say?&quot;
&quot;'Fuck, shit! I break you, TV!&quot;
We both chuckled. &quot;That's awesome,&quot; I said. The bell rang for class to
end. Mrs. Morrison addressed the class. &quot;Our first project is to do a
poster of something about science. It is due next Thursday.&quot;
I never got to do the project. When I was in eighth grade, my guidance
counselor promised me biology. Later at home my mom asked me why I was
taking physical science when I had been promised biology. &quot;I thought
you were going to take biology. Isn't that what your guidance counselor
said when you were in eighth grade?&quot;
&quot;Oh, yeah. But I can't take biology yet because physical science is a
prerequisite for biology.&quot;
&quot;I don't care. You were promised biology.&quot;
We went to see my guidance counselor, Ms. White and after several
visits, rearranged my schedule as follows: Period 1, Latin. Period 2,
Ancient Civilization. Period 3, Biology. Period 4, Freshman English.
Period 5, Lunch. Period 6, Algebra 2. Period 7, French 3. Periods 8 and
9, Drama.
Mr. Halloran, the guy who worked the computer in the office, handed me
my schedule. &quot;So, Mr. Halloran, have I set the school record for most
schedule changes yet?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Not by a long shot, James.&quot;
Soon, I found the jump from eighth grade to ninth grade, middle school
to high school far too sudden and abrupt for me. I couldn't handle it.
I had only been in high school about two and a half to three months,
and the routine was already starting to get to me. At that time, the
day at Co-operative Arts and Humanities High School was from 8:00 a.m.
until 3:30 p.m, and you didn't get home until 4:00. Christ. That's
eight hours. You piss away a third of your day in some building,
learning shit you probably won't even need in the real world, and after
that you only have time to eat and sleep. At this time, I rarely did my
homework, thus racking up numerous outstanding assignments at the end
of a term, as well as plenty of warning of failure notices.
When I tried to do my homework, I would be so tired that I fell asleep
right in the middle of it. One minute I'd be solving an algebra problem
and the next I'd be out cold, only to wake up in a face full of papers.
Sometimes, I'd be so disinterested, I'd just stop right in the middle
of it and play my guitar. My mom would yell at me to stop, but I'd
always turn my amp off and play &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;. Other times I
simply refused to do my homework. Hell, sometimes I just decided that I
didn't want to go to school. I'd just pretend I was sick, which was
usually something minor like a headache or a stuffy nose and I'd stay
home.
Finally my mother came down on me after I'd been hit with a barrage of
warning of failure notices. &quot;It says here that you owe work in biology
and English class. How come?&quot;
&quot;It was from being absent from school.&quot; I replied.
&quot;Well, I want you to do it. Stay off the phone and the computer and no
TV or guitar until it's done.&quot;
I sighed and took my backpack to my room. I put on some music and
tackled the make-up work. It took me a long time to learn this, but
ignoring problems doesn't always make them go away.
The long day wasn't the only thing that irritated me. It was a lot of
little things that got more and more copiously awful over time. One day
I reported to homeroom, and my homeroom teacher, Mrs. Morrison, the
same teacher I briefly had for physical science, addressed us.
&quot;All right, class. We're going to take a survey. This survey is taken
by students across the state. What it does is find out the strengths
and weaknesses of all the schools. I will read a question, and you are
to fill in Strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly Disagree, or
Unsure.&quot;
I yawned. I'd taken so many surveys like this, and I personally find
them tedious in general. But I thought, let's just get it over with and
make it quick. I sat near a kid named Travis Hall. I could tell he was
just as bored as me.
Mrs. Morrison began the survey. &quot;The first question,&quot; she said, &quot;'Do
you feel that you learn anything in school?'&quot;
Travis frowned and said &quot;Hell, no!&quot; Everyone laughed. Mrs. Morrison
didn't. &quot;Travis, please control yourself. The next question, 'Do you
feel that the teachers try to help students if they have problems?'&quot;
&quot;Hell, no!&quot;
&quot;Travis, this is the second time I have to ask you. Please keep quiet.
O.K., now for the next question: 'Do you feel that your peers are
interested in school?'&quot;
&quot;Hell, no!&quot; More hearty laughter.
Mrs. Morrison was starting to look a little angry at this
point. &quot;Travis, one more outburst, and I will send you out in the
hallway!&quot; I had noticed that at this point she had some trouble giving
this survey, because of her wrath, but she soon collected herself and
continued. &quot;'Do you feel that your school is kept clean?'&quot;
&quot;Hell, no!&quot;
&quot;Travis! Go in the hallway. As for the rest of you, you can complete
this survey on your own!&quot;
We did. At the bottom, they asked for a commentary. I wrote: Your
survey sucks! You make up these lame-ass surveys because you have
nothing better to do! I bet you got kicked out of the Milli Vanilli Fan
Club! You suck!&quot;

Tales Of Bovine Feces

The ones who dedicate the flags to make you brave,
They also consecrate the headstone on your grave.
Ritual remembrance when no one knows your name
Don't help a single widow learn to fight the pain.

Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, you all know what I mean.
What's the use of a cry for help, if no one hears the scream,
No one hears the scream?
No voices in the sky, confusion blinds the eye,
Can't take it with you when you die,
No voices in the sky.

MOTORHEAD: &quot;No Voices In The Sky&quot; (1991)
Written by Ian Kilmister, Michael Burston, Philip Campbell and Philip
Taylor

One day I was sitting in the cafeteria, eating my lunch. When I
finished, I took a sandwich bag, inflated it and popped it. Everyone
within a radius of two cafeteria tables was startled. I loved it. But
then, I saw this woman looking at me. Figuring her to be an
administrator, I gritted my teeth and got an early start on my
homework. But I felt as if she was still looking at me. For about three
days afterward, every time I passed her, it seemed as if she had this
lost in thought kind of look on her face every time she saw me.
I finally figured out why.
At lunchtime one day she approached me. &quot;Hi, I'm Donna Frederick and I
am designing the brochure for this school. You seem to be a fine
looking young man. I was wondering if you would like to participate in
a photo shoot.&quot;
&quot;Hey, why not?&quot; I said. But why did I say that? Why did I say
that? &quot;But why me?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Not to be racist, but we need to have a nice balance to play up the
diversity of the school, and we need just one more good looking white
boy. You seem perfect.&quot;
&quot;Thanks.&quot;
I procured a copy of the brochure. In addition to photographs, there
were quotes from various students. I thought that I might submit one of
my own. I approached Ms. Frederick with my quote, submitted for her
approval. &quot;At Co-op, I feel as if I learn a lot,&quot; she read. &quot;In
addition, I feel as if my academic needs are met. Co-op has an academic
environment like no other school I have been to.&quot; She handed the paper
back to me. &quot;Well, kiddo,&quot; she said, &quot;that's a start. I do think it
could be worded a bit more articulately.&quot;
I nodded.
&quot;Of course we don't want to say anything nasty about the other schools.&quot;
&quot;Not at all,&quot; I said.
&quot;I would say, 'Co-op has an academic environment that meets my needs,
and I feel as if I learn a lot,'&quot; she said.
&quot;That sounds good,&quot; I said.
&quot;Good,&quot; she said. &quot;Of course, I don't know that we may be able to fit
that into the brochure, kiddo. There really is so much space.&quot;
&quot;I see.&quot;
&quot;But, I guarantee that your picture will be in there. We begin shooting
the week after next.&quot;
&quot;O.K.&quot;
The photo shoot began within a week and a half. The photographers came
in and discussed with Ms. Frederick how it all should go. &quot;I have an
idea,&quot; one of them said. &quot;Let's make it look as if they're about to
graduate.&quot; He gestured toward me. &quot;We could have this gentleman in it,
because he's kind of tall.&quot; They began the shoot, and photographed me
in a red cap and gown, holding diplomas in a cross with another girl
dressed up as a graduating senior.
Why the fuck didn't I realize at the time that this was perhaps the
ultimate reason that Co-op was such a bullshit school when I went
there? For Christ's sake, I was only fourteen and just because I was
six feet tall and had some stubble they were going to dress me up as
someone about to graduate. This should have been a sign—a big fucking
neon sign. But I didn't care. All that mattered to me was that I would
be getting my fifteen minutes of fame.
What the fuck was wrong with me?
Finally, when the brochures came out, I took one look, and I got a bad
taste in my mouth. Of course, there was the infamous &quot;graduation&quot;
picture. But not only that, I saw kids pictured in art departments they
we not part of. One of my friends from drama class was singing with the
choral ensemble in one picture. What? Also, in every picture, the kids
seemed to be smiling. At the time, this seldom was the case at Co-op.
Not only that, I later learned that the quotes saying that it was &quot;a
good academic environment and a real community&quot; and referring to the
teachers as &quot;nurturing, understanding people&quot; were from kids who
obviously despised the school. &quot;A good academic environment?&quot; &quot;A real
community?&quot; Bull-motherfucking-shit! Except for the community part,
none of this was true! The academics sucked and so did most of the
teachers! It's really just as well that what I said about the school
earlier did not appear in the brochure. Otherwise, I would have rued
the day I said such nice things about the Co-operative Arts and
Oh-the-Humanity-of-it-all Magnet High School even more than I do now.
No wonder I took great comfort in reading George Orwell's 1984 at this
time. At least none of the students wound up getting prosecuted for
their &quot;thought crimes.&quot; Shit.
Over time, I really grew and grew not to like Co-op High School. One
particular reason was the absolute dishonesty of the people in charge
of the institution. I mean, by and large. The principal, Dr. Warner,
was often absent due to complications of diabetes, and hence, the
inmates began running the asylum.
One particular problem arose because of problems I had with a certain
clique of seniors. I would often try to be pleasant and friendly, and
at best I was snubbed, at worst ridiculed. During fourth period, I our
classes were directly across the hall from each other. We sat where we
could see each other. Often, I would be staring out into space and they
would be giving me the finger. from across the hall. I knew that they
were honor students and much loved by the administration and faculty.
However, they seemed like assholes to me.
One day, it was the middle of middle of mid-terms, and I was about to
walk home. I was eating a Reese's peanut butter cup I had just bought.
Charles Tirrell and Kevin DiChello, two members of said group walked
by. I smiled at them with the dark brown lining of the Reese's cup over
my front teeth, which made it look like they had been knocked out.
Charles walked by and sarcastically said, &quot;Ha ha ha, very fuckin'
funny.&quot; I rounded the corner and kept walking, minding my own business.
Suddenly I saw a red car suddenly pull into the driveway that I was
walking across. I jumped out of the way, scared shitless. I quickly
collected myself, and looked over at the red car. In the driver's seat
was Kevin DiChello, and Charles Tirrell was riding shotgun. I lividly
gave them the finger. They reciprocated and drove off. &quot;YOU
SONSABITCHES!!!!!&quot; I screamed. &quot;I'M CALLING THE FUCKING COPS!!!! I
SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD!!!!&quot;
I went to the pay phone on Orange Street, muttering under my
breath, &quot;I'm gonna get you, you fucking assholes! You guys are fucking
dead! You bastards fucked with me for the last time!&quot;
I went to the pay phone at the corner of Orange and Audubon Street, and
called the police. I then bummed a quarter from an old man, and called
my mother. I told her everything. The officer came and we went into
school. My mother arrived shortly afterward. After a quick conference,
a decision was made. &quot;This is a breach of peace, which is an arrestable
offense, but I would rather the school deal with it,&quot; said the
officer. &quot;Otherwise, things will get far too complicated.&quot;
So the next day, I went into school with my parents. We all crowded
into an office in the main office, which was Mr. Mongillo's; me, my
parents, Charles, Mrs. Tirrell, Kevin, Mrs. DiChello. I basically told
my side of the story, and Mr. Mongillo listened intently. He then asked
Charles for his side of the story.
&quot;Mr. Mongillo,&quot; said Charles, &quot;we have been having problems with him
since the beginning of the year. He follows us around the school, he
calls us names, he threatens us, stuff like that.&quot;
&quot;That's not true,&quot; I blurted out hyperventilating. &quot;I never
meant.........I really never meant to get off on the wrong foot with
you guys.&quot;
&quot;Still, he should have gotten the message the first time around. Who
wants to be forced to be friends with anyone.&quot;
&quot;Who says I was forcing anyone?&quot; I asked furtively.
&quot;I can understand that you would be annoyed with him, but that's no
reason to swerve the car at him,&quot; said Mr. Mongillo.
&quot;Look, we only meant it as a joke,&quot; said Kevin with considerable
exasperation. Some fucking joke, I thought.
&quot;Well,&quot; said Mr. Mongillo, &quot;What if you didn't put the brakes on? He
could have been seriously hurt. Or worse.&quot;
Charles nodded. His mother piped up, &quot;I want you to do everything in
your power to keep him away from my son.&quot; She gestured toward me. I
seethed. I really did. I may have been an annoying little shit, but I
never took a chance on killing anyone.
&quot;Don't worry, we'll handle this,&quot; said Mr. Mongillo. &quot;Mr. Mongillo,&quot;
said Kevin's mother, &quot;I am very disappointed in Kevin. He will never
drive again, and I am taking his license away.&quot;
&quot;Here is what is going to be done,&quot; said Mr. Mongillo. He gestured
toward me. &quot;You are to stay away from Kevin and Charles.&quot; I nodded. &quot;As
for you two,&quot; he said, gesturing toward Kevin and Charles, &quot;I am going
to give you both in-school suspension for five days.&quot;
To this day, such a punishment for an offense of that nature seems
laughably paltry to me. I ran into Dr. Warner, the principal at a
school function, and she mentioned to me that what those two did
was &quot;appalling&quot; and that she &quot;would do everything in her power to make
sure they got the punishment they deserved for treating a favorite
student of hers like that.&quot; Hmmmmm. Bullshit.
For just about the rest of the year, we would keep a safe distance from
each other, giving each other dirty looks. I remember seeing those two
on garbage detail in the cafeteria, serving their suspension. As much
as I felt they'd got off easy, I couldn't keep myself from a chuckle.
Especially since they seemed genuinely humiliated. Especially since
all's well that ends well. I guess.............

Pharmacology 101

Well, they'll stone when you're at the breakfast table.
They'll stone you when you're young and able.
They'll stone you when you're trying to make a book.
They'll stone you, and then they'll say, &quot;Good Luck.&quot;
But I wouldn't feel so all alone.
Everybody must get stoned.

BOB DYLAN: &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot; (1966)

One bitterly cold December day in biology class, we were doing
experiments with fruit flies. One of the required components of the
experiment was ether. However, there was one small problem. Due to the
freezing weather, the windows were tightly drawn shut. Since there was
no ventilation, I had no choice but to breathe the toxic air within the
classroom. Out of curiosity, though, I would discreetly sniff the
bottle for a moment when Ms. Arnini, the teacher wasn't looking. I did
this a few times.
By the end of the period, I felt completely burnt out. I was tired,
disoriented, and had a wicked headache. I staggered into English class.
As I shuffled to my desk, my English teacher, Ms. Marshall asked me
what was wrong. &quot;Nothing,&quot; I said, not wanting to get myself or anybody
else in trouble. &quot;Just tired.&quot; When English class was over, felt
somewhat better.
Around this time, I made a new friend, Anthony McVety. He was the
archetypal neo-hippy: Corduroy trousers, tie-dyed shirt, Birkenstock
sandals and the obligatory Hendrix perm. We would often eat lunch
together and talk about classic rock.
He was also in my French class. One day, the teacher wasn't there and
there was no substitute. I saw him take out a little plastic bag with
some chopped green leaves and buds and a packet of Rizla rolling
papers. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Rolling a joint,&quot; he said quietly.
&quot;I don't want to risk getting in trouble, dude,&quot; he added. I need a way
to keep a low profile.&quot;
Without a word I put my bookbag up on the desk, and he thanked me and
set about the task. I watched, fascinated, as he separated the seeds
and stems from everything else, and proceeded to assemble the joint. It
seemed as if the world had gone mad. If I had told any of my adult
friends about this, they'd probably ask, &quot;Where was the teacher?&quot; Good
question.
&quot;Why do you throw away the seeds?&quot; I asked. &quot;The seeds taste like
shit,&quot; he said. &quot;This is a pretty straight-ass batch,&quot; he
continued. &quot;Can't wait to smoke this baby. James, would you mind eating
the seeds? I don't want to leave any evidence around.&quot;
&quot;Don't mind if I do,&quot; I said, and started nibbling. &quot;They won't get me
fucked up, will they?&quot;
&quot;Nah.&quot;
I continued to watch, in awe, as he put the finishing touches on the
joint. It showed how backwards the authority figures were, and what can
happen when a school runs short of substitute teachers!
Shortly before Christmas 1996, I had marijuana in my system for the
very first time. Anthony and some of his friends were hanging out in
front of the school. Soon, Anthony produced a small blue ceramic pipe.
He put a very small amount of reefer into the pipe, and began passing
it around. One of the kids, Sam Karp blew a hit into my face. It didn't
seem to affect me much at first, but just as I stepped inside, it
kicked in. For the first half of the day, I felt really paranoid. In
biology class, my classmates were ragging on me.
&quot;James, you're high as fuck, ain't you?&quot;
&quot;No, I'm just tired.&quot;
&quot;Bullshit, motherfucker! You been smokin' them trees! I know.&quot; I just
ignored
them.
But shortly afterward, I would try pot for the very first time.
I was at Anthony's house, and I had my guitar in tow: a red Fender
Squier Strat. We went into his room. It was a total hippy haven.
Posters all over: Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Jimi
Hendrix, the Beatles, etc. Tiedyed fabric hanging from the walls. An
incense holder on the window sill. He got out his white Kramer Baretta
and plugged it into his Marshall amp. I got my guitar out and plugged
it into my Fender amp. We jammed for awhile.
Three-quarters of an hour later, Anthony said, &quot;I think I'm going to
smoke a bong.&quot; He got a purple bong out and took two hits.
&quot;Can I try some?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Sure,&quot; he said, passing me the bong. &quot;This is how you do it,&quot; he said,
demonstrating how to use it. &quot;You put your index finger over the hole
in the front, light, and inhale. You take your finger off, inhale, hold
it, and exhale.&quot;
I took about three hits. It seemed like a rite of passage. Today, James
Conrad, you shall become a man! Now, some people think that they don't
get high the first time they smoke pot. I did, but I just didn't know
it then. I passed the bong back to Anthony, he did a couple of hits,
and gave it back to me. I took about two or three more. After that, I
started to giggle a little. &quot;Chill, dude, don't get too fucked up,&quot; he
said. &quot;My dad'll kill me.&quot; With that, he put the bong back. We sat on
the couch in his room, listening to Canned Heat. There was a lit stick
of incense in the holder. We talked about all kinds of stuff: What our
old school was like, rock music, our parents, our friends, and so on.
Later on, we played pool. Not only was it my first time playing pool,
but I was also quite stoned. &quot;Hey, Jim,&quot; said Anthony. &quot;Number
thirteen, corner pocket.&quot; With that, he sank said ball into said
pocket. I just stood there, dazed. Aside from being more experienced in
billiards, he obviously had a greater tolerance than I did. We had both
just smoked up, but he was playing like Paul Newman and I couldn't hold
the cue right. Hell, at one point I knocked the cue ball clean off the
table. His father chuckled. &quot;Careful, Jim,&quot; he said. &quot;You do that at
the wrong place, they'll probably shoot ya.&quot;
Later, when my parents came to pick me up, I was trying to act casual.
I was so paranoid, and was hoping they wouldn't suspect anything. They
didn't.
Not to glamorize drug use, but I remember feeling triumphant having
smoked pot for the first time and boasting to some of my friends. Now
that I am older, I realize it was a stupid thing to be triumphant
about. But at that time, it seemed like a rite of passage. Besides, I
was fifteen; old enough to know better, but young enough not to give a
shit.

Latin Class Sucks

We don't need no education.
We don't need no thought control.
No dark sarcasm in the classroom.
Teacher, leave them kids alone.
Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

PINK FLOYD: &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Part 2&quot; (1979)
Written by George Roger Waters

I took Latin in ninth grade. My teacher's name was Ms. Schread. I don't
remember much about the class, except that Ms Schread neither expected
me to have a life outside the classroom nor a chance to be human,
something she reiterated by screaming. I had other things on my
schedule that were just as important, if not more, since we had a hell
of a long day, and not much time was left for homework.
The class was extremely small, as I was one of five students. The
others were Michael Donadio, his friend Krystan Zbikowski, Anthony
Candelario, and Lisandra Sanchez. It would be the same thing every day.
I'd try to tell her the reason that I didn't have my homework was that
I was incredibly busy, and it'd be like telling that to King Kong:
&quot;Ms. Schread, I was unable to do my homework because I had a lot of
homework to do in my other classes.&quot; I said.
She looked at me with her trademark death stare. Ms Schread had these
piercing blue eyes that seemed like that they didn't belong in her
face. Scary as hell. &quot;You never have your homework,&quot; she'd yell. &quot;You
had two days to do this assignment!&quot;
&quot;I'll bring it in tomorrow.&quot;
&quot;You had better, or it's a zero!&quot;
&quot;O.K.&quot;
Of course, Michael, Krystan, and Anthony received the same treatment
for the same reason. Ms. Schread would really come down hard on
us. &quot;You people never have your homework. You people make me sick!&quot;
One day I came into her class. She would be arriving late as usual, so
then I would be able to do a little bit of the assignment. Of course, I
didn't quite finish. Almost, but not quite.
&quot;Ms. Schread, I didn't quite finish the assignment. I'm almost done
though......&quot;
Here came the death stare. Then she yelled at me. &quot;That's not good
enough! I want you sit there and finish this assignment and don't say
another word!&quot;
I sat there, but I didn't finish the assignment. Having recently seen
The Shining, with Jack Nicholson, I scrawled &quot;All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy&quot; all over the back of my Latin folder as anger
boiled in me. Mike looked over my shoulder as I was doing it. &quot;All work
and no play makes Jack a dull boy,&quot; he read. He chuckled. &quot;You're
fucking crazy,&quot; he said.
Later, Lisandra admitted to not having her homework. &quot;Oh, that's all
right,&quot; she calmly said. &quot;You can bring it in tomorrow.&quot; Then she
turned to me. &quot;I'm passing out this worksheet,&quot; she said, her voice
becoming dangerous. &quot;You'd better bring it in tomorrow or I'm going to
fail you on ten tests and then I'll fail you for the year!&quot;
&quot;O.K., Ms. Schread,&quot; I said in monotone.
This pissed me off something awful. How the hell can she turn a blind
eye to Lisandra not having her homework and threaten to fail me for the
year because I don't have mine? Something doesn't make sense.
The next morning I reported to her class. She was late, as usual. I
didn't have my homework, as usual. I sat in the class with Lisandra,
Mike, and Krystan and talked.
&quot;Man, I'm sick of this fuckin' class,&quot; I said indignantly. &quot;She gives
me work that she thinks won't take an hour and never considers that I
have five other fucking classes.&quot;
&quot;I know, right?&quot; said Mike.
&quot;Personally,&quot; said Krystan, &quot;I think you should stick up for yourself.
Tell her that, man.&quot;
&quot;You think she'll understand?&quot; I asked. Krystan shrugged.
&quot;You know,&quot; said Lisandra, &quot;I feel sorry for you guys. Ms. Schread
gives us a lot of work and she doesn't care about what else we have to
do. I wouldn't feel as sorry for you if this wasn't such a small class,
but it is.&quot;
&quot;Thanks. You know know what else I don't like about her?&quot; I said. &quot;She
plays favorites.&quot;
&quot;No, she doesn't!&quot; said Lisandra.
&quot;She does too! Yesterday she threatened to fail me on ten tests and
also for the year, and she was all calm about you not having your
homework, like it was no big deal.&quot;
&quot;That's because you never have your homework.&quot;
&quot;And it's because I never have my homework and that you almost always
do that she favors you. I'm into equal treatment. I mean, if two people
commit the same crime, you can't let one get off easy and sentence the
other to hard time. It's the principle of the thing.&quot;
Ms. Schread came in a few minutes later. &quot;Do you have your homework?&quot;
she said.
&quot;No,&quot; I said.
&quot;I'm getting so sick of this! You never have your homework!&quot;
&quot;For one thing, Ms. Schread, I have things that are just as important
on my schedule, and it just so happens that I don't consider this class
as important as my other classes!&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Krystan slapping me high five. &quot;Right on!&quot;
&quot;Also,&quot; I continued, &quot;you can't expect me to do my work by threatening
to fail me. This actually does not even motivate me at all.&quot;
&quot;I don't care!&quot; she screamed. She was really mad now. &quot;No excuses! If I
give you work, you do it! You are down to about a C+ average. I know
you can do better, James.&quot;
Later that day, I did my homework. Mad as I was, I thought it was time
I should make her life a living hell...............
I walked into class the next morning, my homework safely tucked away in
my battered yellow accordion folder. I had a plan. Ms. Schread walked
in. &quot;All right everyone, let's get started,&quot; she said. She turned to
me. &quot;Where's your homework?&quot;
&quot;I'm sorry, I don't have it,&quot; I said. &quot;Someone broke into my locker and
sold it to buy drugs.&quot; With a pathetic excuse like that it was hard to
keep a straight face. Since I was studying acting at the time, I
managed to do it.
She sighed with exasperation. &quot;You are in big trouble. I gave you two
weeks to do that worksheet and now you're telling me someone broke into
your locker and stole it. Do you expect me to believe that?&quot;
&quot;Ms. Schread, I'll straighten out and fly right, it's just..........&quot;
She cut me off. &quot;You aren't straightening out at all. Don't even talk
to me.&quot;
I produced the homework. &quot;By the way, here it is,&quot; I said, grinning.
&quot;So why are you making me upset?!&quot; I just stood there smirking. Yeah, I
thought. Deal with that, you psychotic bitch!
This single action set up a pattern. Mike, Krystan and I on a regular
basis would do something to make her crazy. Once, Krystan turned the
clock ahead before she came in. Mike and I loved it, seeing her look at
her watch and be all confused. &quot;Why does that clock say quarter after?&quot;
she asked. We shrugged. Another time, when Ms. Schread was talking to
Lisandra, Krystan and I pushed our bookbags off of our desks. She
looked up at us angrily, but immediately took a deep breath and
continued talking to Lisandra.
Mrs. Schread often would have us put sentences we did for homework on
the board. One sentence I was assigned was &quot;The farmer walks into the
woods with his beautiful wife.&quot; In Latin, this translates
into &quot;Agricola ambulabat in silvam cum pulchra femina.&quot; I put
down: &quot;E-thay armer-fay alks-way into-way e-thay oods-way ith-way
is-hay eautiful-bay ife-way.&quot; Mike took one look and started cracking
up incessantly. Ms. Schread didn't find it too funny. &quot;James, put the
sentence on the board correctly and stop being silly.&quot; I grinned and
shrugged my shoulders. &quot;Latin, Pig Latin, what's the difference?&quot; I
said.
While we were taking a quiz, Krystan started talking to me. &quot;Hey
James,&quot; he said, gesturing to his paper. &quot;Check this out.&quot; While Ms.
Schread wasn't looking, I looked at his paper. Seeing that he had only
answered the first question, and correctly, I might add, and had
deliberately left the rest of the paper blank, I laughed quietly, but
quickly stifled it so that Ms. Schread wouldn't hear me.
One day neither Mike nor Krystan nor me had our homework. Ms. Schread
really lost it this time. &quot;I don't know what I'm going to do with you
three.&quot; she fumed. &quot;You never have your homework.&quot; Not true, I
thought. &quot;I want you to sit there and do it.&quot; As we begrudgingly did
her bidding, a car alarm went off. I'm pretty sure it was hers, because
her car alarm went off at least twice a week. &quot;Ms. Schread, I think
that's yours,&quot; said Mike. &quot;I don't care whose it is,&quot; she said
angrily. &quot;Do your work and be quiet.&quot; After five minutes, it was still
going. We all thought it was pretty amusing. &quot;Just wait until she goes
to her car and the battery's dead,&quot; said Mike, laughing. Although the
sound of a car alarm is a pet peeve of mine, I was loving it that we
had agitated her to the point where she couldn't turn off her own car
alarm. Oh, revenge is so very, very sweet.

Crushed

When you were here before,
I couldn't look you in the eye.
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry.
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world.
And I wish I was special.
You're so fuckin' special.
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts.
I want to have control.
I want a perfect body.
I want a perfect soul.
I want you to notice
When I'm not around.
You're so fuckin' special.
I wish I was special.
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo.
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

RADIOHEAD: &quot;Creep&quot; (1993)
Written by Thomas Edward Yorke, Jonathan Greenwood, Edward O'Brien,
Colin Greenwood, and Philip Selway

I was in drama class one day. I looked at a girl next to me. She was
bespectacled, fairly tall, with a dark complexion, brown eyes and long,
black wavy hair. &quot;Hi,&quot; I said. &quot;You're Melissa Lopez, right?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied. &quot;You're James, right?&quot;
&quot;Yeah. What kind of music do you listen to?&quot;
&quot;Oh, anything that sounds good, I guess. I like the Beatles.&quot;
&quot;Oh, I totally love the Beatles. I've got a lot of their albums on
tape. You like the Who?&quot;
&quot;Never heard of them.&quot;
&quot;Formed in Shepherd's Bush, London about 1964. They were the first band
to trash their instruments. Does this sound familiar?&quot; I started to
sing the song 'My Generation'. &quot;'People try to put us d-d-d-dowwwn,
talkin' 'bout my generation.....'&quot;
&quot;Oh, yeah. I heard that before.&quot;
I was totally infatuated with her. She was pretty, enjoyable to talk
to, and on top of which, she had a cute voice. They weren't many girls
like her, that's for damn sure.
Just then the bell rang for class. &quot;Well,&quot; I said. &quot;gotta go.&quot;
Awhile after, we were on a field trip to see a play at the Long Wharf
Theatre. All her friends were sitting together, and I was in the same
row as them. She got a seat way off somewhere else. &quot;James, what seats
did you get?&quot; she asked. We looked at each other's tickets. &quot;Oh, jeez,&quot;
she said. &quot;Would you like to switch seats?&quot; she asked.
Without a word, I nonchalantly handed my ticket. There was a long
synchronized &quot;Awww&quot; that came from her and her friends, as well as
comments like &quot;What a sweetheart&quot;, &quot;He's so nice&quot;, etc. This felt good.
&quot;James,&quot; she said softly, &quot;you're such a sweetheart.&quot; I smiled and we
hugged each other.
Some time afterward, I asked her for her number, and I got it. Our
phone conversations started out friendly and ordinary.
&quot;So how do you like Co-op?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Oh, it's alright,&quot; she replied. &quot;Most of the boys there are assholes,
though.&quot;
&quot;How so?&quot;
&quot;Oh, all that matters to them is sex, they're all into themselves, and
they're phony.&quot;
&quot;I'm not like most boys.&quot;
&quot;I know. You're a good friend.&quot;
&quot;Thanks.&quot;
Of course, love is a strong emotion, and I never was one who holds back
his emotions. Needless to say, things I said to her got to be pretty
mushy. One day, I finally admitted to her over the phone how I
felt. &quot;Melissa, I hope you won't laugh at me if I say this,&quot; I said.
&quot;Of course I won't, James.&quot;
&quot;I kind of have a crush.....on........you.&quot; I was incredibly nervous
about saying so.
&quot;Oh, James, I totally understand, and I think you're sweet, but I'm not
ready for a relationship about now.&quot;
&quot;Oh, O.K.&quot;
God damn it, I should have taken the hint. Old habits die hard, though,
particularly for a guy like me. I would constantly give her love
letters. When I talked to her on the phone, the main subject would be
how great she was. I remember one particular phone conversation, when I
decided to say something nice to her in Spanish, since I knew she spoke
some Spanish. I looked for my sister's Spanish textbook, and after
skimming through it, I called her.
&quot;Melissa?&quot; I said.
&quot;Yes, James?&quot;
&quot;Tu eras muy bonita.&quot;
&quot;Oh, Gracias.&quot;
&quot;When would you like to get together sometime? I kinda like you, you
know.&quot;
&quot;James, I'm not ready for a relationship right now. I think you are
sweet and all, but you aren't the only boy who feels this way about
me.&quot; Another hint I should have taken.
Then one day, a few weeks later, it happened. I was walking through the
hallways at school during seventh period, and I saw Melissa walking
with a fairly tall Hispanic kid. I noticed he had his arm around her. I
grew somewhat uncomfortable and suspicious, but decided not to worry
too much and went on my way to the water fountain as they rounded the
corner. As I walked away from the fountain, I noticed the boy walking
towards me. He stopped and said to me, &quot;Are you James Conrad?&quot;
&quot;Yes.&quot;
&quot;I just want to tell you to lay off of Melissa, because that's my
girlfriend.&quot;
&quot;Oh.&quot; I had this sinking feeling inside me. &quot;I can be regular friends
with her right?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, but not boyfriend and girlfriend. I had to beat up the last
person who tried to mess with my girl, just so you know.&quot;
&quot;Oh, don't worry,&quot; I said.
Around the end of that day, I confronted her. &quot;I had no idea that you
had a boyfriend,&quot; I said, hurt but not necessarily angry. &quot;You never
even told me.&quot;
&quot;I'm sorry, James,&quot; She said, sadly. &quot;I didn't want to hurt your
feelings.&quot;
&quot;Oh.&quot;
I was absolutely speechless. Now what the hell was I supposed to say? I
just walked away, and headed home. As I walked downtown, I produced a
pack of Camel cigarettes from my pocket, took one out, and lit it up.
Some of my long hair had gotten in the way of the match and got singed,
but I was too depressed to care. I silently shuffled my way home.
About a few days later, I called her. &quot;Hello, is Melissa, there,&quot; I
said, my voice in monotone. &quot;Yeah, hi James, can you hold on for a sec?&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said. Then right after that, I suddenly blacked out for some
reason. I still don't know why. Then Melissa's voice came back over the
phone. &quot;Now, James, listen to me.&quot; Those words woke me up
immediately. &quot;I've told you, and my boyfriend's told you, and even
though I think you're very sweet, I really only want to be just
friends, so I think you should kind of back off a little.&quot;
&quot;But when I first met you, I thought you were the girl of my dreams.&quot;
&quot;James, I'm not the girl of your dreams. The thing is, you latched on
to me in an unhealthy way, and I know that old habits are hard to
break, but I already have a boyfriend.&quot;
I sighed. &quot;O.K., well, bye.&quot;
&quot;Bye.&quot;
For about the next few days after that, I didn't even talk to her. I
held nothing against her. I could only blame myself. Even just looking
at her reminded me of the whole predicament that my stupid ass had
gotten myself into.
Then, while we were doing a play for the school, our friendship was
renewed. It was closing night, and after the curtain call, everyone
went backstage. While we were hanging backstage, I approached
her. &quot;Melissa,&quot; I said, &quot;I just thought you might like to know that you
did really well out there.&quot;
&quot;Thanks, James. You were good, too.&quot; We hugged. I knew at that very
moment, that everything was all right. Of course, I was soon to make
the same ass-backward mistake about love again soon, but with someone
else.
Just for the record, Melissa and I are still friends.

&quot;He Loved Big Brother.&quot;

Automatically defrosted when manhood came on time,
I became a man and left the &quot;ice school&quot; behind.
And now I am to begin the life that I'm assigned;
The life that's been lived before a thousand times.

I have a feeling deep inside that something is missing.
It's a feeling in my soul, and I can't help wishing
That one day I'll discover that we're living a lie,
And I'll tell the whole world the reason why.

Well, until then, all I know is what I need to know,
And everything I do's been done before.
Every idea in my head, someone else has said.
At each end of my life is an open door.

THE WHO: &quot;905&quot; (1978)
Written by John Entwistle

My locker had been cleaned out. My books had all been turned in. I
grabbed my jean jacket and walked out of the school. Freshman year was
finally over, and I didn't have anything more to worry about for three
months. Sure, I had suffered emotionally. Aside from the immense
culture shock, my experience in Latin class traumatized me and turned
me into a passive-aggressive jackass, and I had suffered greatly from
developing an unhealthy crush on a girl. O.K., so these things
happened. Tough shit. I had survived them. Now that the school year was
over, I felt as if I should not let them bother me, but think of them
as preparations for the journey ahead of me.
My grades may not have been their best, but I didn't care. At least I
wouldn't have to stay back. As I walked downtown, I decided that since
I got out early for a change, I would hang around for a bit. I walked
into a bookstore, and toward the books about rock and roll music, one
my favorite subjects. I sat down and started reading one.
The end of this year couldn't have come soon enough for me. It was so
hard for me to adapt to the routine, since it was only my first year. I
had this optimistic feeling that next year would be easier, because by
then I had adapted well to the routine, but my journey was far from
over, and in light of what was to come, I was wasting wishes.
For the whole year, I had been oblivious to what really went on at
Co-op High School, because I was busy adjusting to a new life. Within
the next two years, I would discover the most horrifying aspects of the
school, and these experiences would change me as a person, and make me
think as to how naive I was between the ages of fourteen and fifteen,
and also think about how politics comes into play within the school
system. Until I was sixteen, I didn't think about it. On the last day
of school, as I walked around downtown, I wasn't even thinking about
that. At that moment, all I cared about was the fact that for three
months, I would have nothing to worry about, and that I had survived
freshman year.
I was so unenlightened as to how badly I got fucked and how badly I was
about to be fucked, because everything I suffered became tolerable
after awhile. Due to this, the school turned me into a lean, mean
propaganda machine. For example:
During the summer after my freshman year, I was riding my bike. As I
was pedaling nearby the school, I saw a mother and four children; a
teenage boy, another boy who looked to be the right age for middle
school, a girl who looked elementary school age, and a baby girl. The
mother started talking to me. &quot;Excuse me, is this the Co-operative Arts
and Humanities High School?&quot; she said, pointing to the red brick
building.
&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; I said.
&quot;What's it like there?&quot;
&quot;It's basically your regular high school,&quot; I said, shrugging. &quot;Why do
you ask?&quot;
&quot;We have heard about it, and my son is thinking of going here,&quot; she
said, gesturing to her elder son.
I looked at him. He was lean, craggy, almost as tall as me and
bespectacled, with wild dark brown hair and a goatee. &quot;What's your
name?&quot; I asked. &quot;Mike,&quot; he replied. I shook his hand. &quot;Nice to meet
you. What class are you?&quot;
&quot;2000.&quot;
&quot;Me, too,&quot; I said.
&quot;I'm Mrs. O'Malley,&quot; she said, shaking my hand. &quot;I heard that this
place is oriented toward the arts.&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said.
&quot;I might send Sean here when he's old enough,&quot; she said gesturing
toward her younger son. &quot;He likes to draw.&quot;
I looked at him. &quot;You look like an artist, kid,&quot; I said.
He nodded.
&quot;What is the music program here like?&quot; she asked.
&quot;It's all right,&quot; I said. &quot;I hear it's kinda hectic, though, but I
don't do music there. Why do you ask?&quot;
&quot;Mike's a musician. I hear about all these ties the school has with the
Symphony Orchestra, and I said to Mike, 'What about the guitar?'&quot;
&quot;Oh, he'll be able to play guitar here,&quot; I said coolly. &quot;What kind of
music do you play?&quot;
&quot;I like Pantera,&quot; he said.
&quot;I make him play Jimi Hendrix for me, though,&quot; said his mother.
&quot;Hendrix is very cool,&quot; I said. &quot;I like Pink Floyd, too.&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; said his mother. &quot;What are the kids like?&quot;
&quot;They aren't too bad,&quot; I said. &quot;There used to be something of a drug
scene around here, but it died down when these two kids got expelled
for selling marijuana.&quot;
&quot;That's good,&quot; she said. &quot;There was something of a drug scene at Platt
Tech, when Mike was there, and I thought it would be good for him to be
in a better environment.&quot;
&quot;I understand.&quot;
&quot;Where do I go to see Mr. Cunningham?&quot;
&quot;Through that door....&quot; Suddenly, I was cut off by the sound of a door
opening. Mr. Cunningham stepped out. &quot;You must be Mrs. O'Malley,&quot; he
said.
&quot;Yes,&quot; she said. &quot;This gentleman was telling me about your school. Is
he a student here?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mr. Cunningham.
&quot;I'm sure you know him very well,&quot; said Mrs. O'Malley.
&quot;Hard to forget someone who wears a hat like that,&quot; said Mr.
Cunningham, in reference to the purple and yellow stovepipe hat I was
wearing. I chuckled.
&quot;I gotta be on my way, but it was nice meeting you,&quot; I said, and then
pedaled off.
In addition, I had been corresponding with my best friend Adam. During
the summer we would talk on the phone a lot. He was especially
interested in Co-op High.
&quot;So James, what's your school like?&quot; he asked.
&quot;Oh, it's great. I like it. The teachers I had this year were
wonderful.&quot;
&quot;Really? Like who?&quot;
&quot;I had Mrs. Powell. She's a history teacher. She's tough and strict,
but at least she cares.&quot;
&quot;That sounds good. Anybody else?&quot;
&quot;I had French last year with Mrs. Apicella. She's nice and her class is
easy.&quot;
&quot;Cool.&quot;
&quot;You should definitely come here, you might like it.&quot;
&quot;O.K.&quot;
But the powers that be at the school weren't the only people that were
bent on brainwashing me. Who were they? The KKK? No. The KGB? No. The
CIA? No. The military? No. A terrorist organization? No. The
government? No. Aliens? No. Some fucked up religious cult? No. They
were my own parents. The issue was the length of my hair. (How typical!)
Almost every time I was visible to my parents, they would say the same
thing: &quot;James, you need a haircut.&quot; It was like a broken record.
&quot;But mom,&quot; I said. &quot;I like my hair long.&quot;
&quot;Too bad. It's not tidy.&quot;
I groaned.
&quot;But James, if you get a haircut, you'll be more attractive to girls.&quot;
(As we shall find out later, this turned out to be bullshit.)
&quot;I don't care.&quot;
&quot;That's too bad, Mister, because you are getting your hair cut!&quot;
&quot;No, I'm not,&quot; I said. &quot;It's my hair.&quot;
&quot;James,&quot; my mother said. &quot;You are a part of my body, so it is not
entirely your hair.&quot; Folks, this is the classic argument of a control
freak. I may have been a part of my mother's body, but that was only
until about noon on January 10, 1982. What a crap argument.
My father decided to be &quot;conciliatory.&quot; &quot;I tell you what, James. If
there are no Cs on your report card, then you can keep your long hair.&quot;
&quot;Can algebra be exempt?&quot; I asked.
&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;But that's not fair. You know it's not my strong suit.&quot;
&quot;James, at least give it a try. You might actually like it.&quot;
I thought for a minute, and then calmed down. &quot;Perhaps,&quot; I said, &quot;I'd
probably like to look a little like David Bowie during his Thin White
Duke years.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, there you go,&quot; said my father.
My final grade in algebra was a C. God damn, parents can be so
manipulative. They can be so fucking controlling. My mother took me to
a salon in Norwalk to get it cut. Looking back, every single aspect of
it—Waiting for the day, driving out there, waiting to get it cut, and
getting it cut,—felt like every aspect of a slow painful death. In a
way, it was. But when I saw the way I looked afterward, hair neatly cut
and slicked back, I liked it.
But who the fuck was I kidding?

Part Two:
Fear And Self-Loathing In New Haven

Same Old Shit

I may never get what I want,
But I'm happy just to die trying.
And I hope I ain't done nobody wrong,
But I miss you smiling.
And I'm looking for a cure, 'cause I'm bored to tears,
And I'm stuck in here, stuck out here, stuck in here.

We lived through another day,
It's a good excuse to celebrate.
Take a number, knock on wood,
We'll find the reason to feel good.
I know you know, just want to know, how I feel.
I can't even tell.
I can't even tell.
I can't even tell.

No one knows nothing about me,
I guess I'll have to keep them guessing.
No one sees what I see,
This is my blessing.
And I'm looking for a way to get out of here.
Get me out of here, out of here, out of here.

We lived through another day,
It's a good excuse to celebrate.
Take a number, knock on wood,
We'll find the reason to feel good.
I know you know, just want to know, how I feel.
I can't even tell.
I can't even tell.
I can't even tell.

SOUL ASYLUM: &quot;Can't Even Tell&quot; (1994)
Written by David Pirner

And so, school started again. On the morning of the first day, I was
dozing peacefully in my bed. Suddenly I heard my mother's
voice. &quot;James, are you up?&quot; With a start, I awoke. I looked at the
alarm clock. &quot;Oh man,&quot; I said, groaning. &quot;I missed my bus! Shit!&quot;
&quot;Now what?&quot; said my mom, exasperated. &quot;I guess I've got to drive you!&quot;
Suddenly, I calmed down. &quot;Oh, I can ride my bike there.&quot; I said.
&quot;You'd better eat first.&quot; said my mom. &quot;Are you sure you won't be late?&quot;
&quot;Pretty sure.&quot; I said.
I wasn't late. I rode to school and made good time. As I was locking my
bike to a signpost, I felt someone kick me square in the ass. I turned
around, angry, but soon realized it was only Sam Karp. &quot;Oh hi, Sam.&quot;
&quot;Hi, James,&quot; he said laughing.
Within a few seconds, this kid who was nearly as tall as I am, but
stocky and muscular came up. &quot;James, he kicked you in the ass,&quot; he
said, laughing.
&quot;Hey, what's up, Adam. I'd like to introduce you to Sam Karp,&quot; I said
to him. I had known Adam since I was about eleven or twelve. We both
went to Betsy Ross Arts Magnet School for middle school, and had met
when we played in our school band. I played tuba, Adam played drums. I
continued locking my bike to the signpost. &quot;James, you brought your
bike to school?&quot; Adam asked.
&quot;Yeah, why?&quot;
&quot;It's gonna get stolen.&quot;
&quot;No it isn't. This is the most reliable kind of lock there is.&quot; I said,
gesturing toward the Kryptonite U-bolt lock that was holding my bike to
the signpost.
&quot;Trust me,&quot; said Sam. &quot;First half-day, it'll be gone.&quot;
About halfway through the day, I was sitting in drama class, when three
girls walked in. &quot;These must be the new students.&quot; said Mrs. Kaczynski,
the drama teacher. I looked over at one of them. She was wearing a Spam
T-shirt. &quot;You like Spam?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Never ate it before,&quot; she said. &quot;I just like the shirt.&quot;
&quot;You know what it stands for?&quot; I asked. She shrugged. &quot;Scientific
Principles Are Moot.&quot; We both laughed politely.
&quot;I DON'T LIKE SPAM!&quot; I said, in a shrill voice, imitating a character
in the Monty Python sketch. She laughed.
&quot;What's your name?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Ginny.&quot;
&quot;I'm James.&quot; We shook hands.
Later on in the class, Ginny was talking to this other new, girl, who
was taller than her and had braces. I noticed a patch on Ginny's
bookbag that said &quot;School is a drag&quot;. &quot;I agree with that patch on your
bookbag, Ginny,&quot; I said.
&quot;School totally is a drag, that's why I bought it,&quot; she said, matter of
factly.
&quot;I personally feel that high school is a waste of time,&quot; I said.
&quot;High school is an incredible waste of time,&quot; said the other girl.
&quot;I'm James. Nice to meet you.&quot;
&quot;I'm Shannon.&quot;
The next day I walked into Mr. Herndon's classroom for U.S.
History. &quot;Hello, Mr. Herndon,&quot; I said.
&quot;Hey James, how's it going?&quot; he replied. I looked around the room. I
finally made eye contact with this girl. She smiled at me. &quot;Hi. You're
in my acting class, aren't you?&quot; she said, in a very perky manner.
&quot;Yeah, I'm James Conrad,&quot; I said, and offered a warm handshake.
&quot;I'm Natassia Parlato,&quot; she said, shaking my hand. &quot;Please, call me
Tassia, though.&quot;
&quot;Nice to meet you, Tassia.&quot;
&quot;You seem to have a lot of views on things,&quot; she said.
&quot;I guess,&quot; I said, shrugging sheepishly.
&quot;Are you smart?&quot;
&quot;People say so, but I don't take my education in school that seriously.
At least not as much as what I learn elsewhere.&quot; She nodded.
At fourth period that day, I went into Mrs. Morrison's classroom for
chemistry. &quot;Hey James, how are you?&quot; said Chris Martineau. &quot;Not bad,
Chris. How was your summer?&quot;
&quot;Not bad, James.&quot;
Soon after that, Mrs. Morrison passed out the textbooks. &quot;You are
expected to cover these books. I have some covers up front, If you
would like to cover your books here.&quot;
Several kids took book covers. I took one as well.
I turned around, and saw Melissa. Her glasses were gone, by now, in
favor of contact lenses. &quot;Hey Melissa,&quot; I said.
&quot;What's up, James?&quot; she said.
I then proceeded to start covering my textbook. When I was finished, I
heard Melissa say &quot;Does anyone know how to cover a book? I've forgotten
how.&quot;
&quot;I'll help you,&quot; I said enthusiastically. &quot;You lay the book out like
this, in the center, and mark right right by the top and bottom edges
of the book, so you know where to fold it. Next, you fold it where you
marked,&quot; I said, folding the book cover where I'd marked it. I then
went through the rest of the process as I gave the instructions. &quot;Now
you lay the book's binding in the middle of the cover, and wrap the
cover over it. Make sure it is even on both sides. Then you take this
end, since it is even, and fold it over this cover. Now you do the same
on the other side. Finally, you tuck the front cover into this flap,
repeat the process on the other side, and there you go, one marking
period's worth of guaranteed protection.&quot;
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, smiling.
It appeared that it would be a good year, but it was just the
beginning, and I didn't know what lay ahead. School started to suck yet
again. Take chemistry class. Please! At first I tolerated chemistry
class, but it got more and more boring. The second hand on the wall
clock seemed to move as if the clock had been taken apart, had its
insides doused with molasses, reassembled, and put back on the wall. I
often fell asleep in class. The slumbers, for some reason, were fairly
golden despite the irritating nasal drone of Mrs. Morrison's goat-like
voice, and the fact that the desks were as hard as all hell.
Sometimes, just to keep myself amused I would decorate the inside front
cover flap of the spiral notebook Mrs. Morrison required us to take
notes in. It started out with small vanity license plates saying such
things as &quot;IH8 CHEM&quot;, &quot;CHEM SUX&quot;, &quot;KEM ROTZ&quot;, &quot;KEM BLOWZ&quot;, &quot;FUK
CHEM&quot;, &quot;NUKE KEM&quot;, and &quot;SKRU KEM&quot;.
The one that said &quot;NUKE KEM&quot; pointed to a mushroom cloud that I drew
that had test tubes, graduated cylinders, beakers, flasks, and all
sorts of laboratory equipment flying out of it. There were also little
jokes such as:

Q: What do you call 10,000 chemistry teachers chained to the bottom of
the ocean?
A: A good start!

Q: What is the difference between chemistry class and hell?
A: You don't tell people to go to chemistry class.

Other things that I put down said: &quot;Difference number 2: People smile
in hell!&quot; and &quot;Note taking pisses me off!&quot;
I often showed my art to Melissa, who sat right next to me. She usually
thought it was kind of funny. Other times I would put graffiti on the
tables using latent fingerprints and blow on it so that the smudges
would spell out &quot;Fuck You&quot;, &quot;Fuck Mrs. Morrison&quot;, &quot;This Sucks&quot;, etc.
Other times, I would balance Bic pens on my desk, a favorite pastime of
mine since eighth grade.
One time when I came to class, I had only gotten six hours sleep, which
was a normal occurrence for me at the time. I walked to my seat,
nodding out, and sat down. I put my head on the desk. I didn't care
what the lesson was going to be about, whether we'd be tested on it, or
how it affected my grade, because I was fucking tired.
I stared around the room, my head still on the desk. I looked at the
windows, the chalkboard, the clock on the wall. The time was 10:15. The
beginning of fourth period. What do you mean, class has just started, I
thought. With my eyes half closed, I looked up at Melissa who glanced
at me, smiled, and shook her head. I closed my eyes. Mrs. Morrison's
monologue about the Systième Internationale and the scientific method
seemed to get slower and slower, and then it faded out. It got very
quiet. I had this feeling that I was sinking into the floor, very
slowly. Some time passed, and then the bell for us to go to fifth
period rang. I felt myself zip up quickly as I awoke abruptly. I got
up, gathered my books and staggered to fifth period.
One day, we were taking a test in her class. &quot;You will have until the
end of the period to complete this test.&quot; she said. &quot;There will be
absolutely no talking, or else you will receive a zero. You may begin
as soon as you get the test.&quot;
About mid-way into the test, I was working on this part about
identifying various chemical reactions. I was fucking stumped. At that
point I had kind of wished I had paid attention. Oh, well, I thought.
Better try and wing it.
About this time, I heard this girl's voice mumbling quietly. &quot;Mrs.
Morrison looks like a gremlin.&quot; I snickered, but tried not to make
myself obvious. The voice came again. &quot;Mrs. Morrison looks like a
gargoyle.&quot; I put my head down and buried my face in my arms to muffle
my laughter. I know it seems kind of immature, but sometimes things are
funny because they are true. Fortunately, Mrs. Morrison didn't notice.
A few days later, Adam and I went into the cafeteria on one rainy day
before school started. We sat down at a table. &quot;So Adam,&quot; I said, &quot;How
do you like Co-op?&quot;
&quot;Man, I fucking hate it. I'm failing a lot of my classes. I hate my
English teacher. She's arrogant and gives too much fucking work. Most
of the kids here are fucking punks. God dammit, this place fucking
sucks.&quot; I nodded. I knew where Adam was coming from. I felt the same
way last year, and this year wasn't much better so far.
There's no easy way to be free.

Life Skills Class Sucks

Concrete shoes! Cyanide! T.N.T.!
Done dirt cheap!
Neckties! Contracts! High voltage!
Done dirt cheap!

AC/DC: &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; (1976)
Written by Angus Young, Malcolm Young and Ronald Scott

One class I had to take at the Co-operative Arts and Humanities High
School was Life Skills. It dealt with adolescent issues: Stress
management, peer pressure, drug abuse, violence, crime, and sex. The
program was well intended, but there was one small problem: I didn't
find it necessary, nor did anyone else. I had already taken it in sixth
and seventh grade. Most kids about that age, at least in my middle
school had never even seen marijuana, let alone smoked a cigarette.
Most of them were still virgins. Most of them had never seen a gun, let
alone use one, unless they had fathers who were N.R.A. members, or had
gone to Boy Scout camp, as was the case with me. Most of them had only
stolen the occasional pack of gum. It was all preparatory.
But in high school, the point of the class is moot. By ninth grade, I
had met girls who had gotten pregnant, stoners, boozers, gang kids, and
pregnant, stoned, boozing gang kids. I had at least three friends who
had gotten busted, usually for trespassing, theft, drugs, assault, etc.
I had known people who had been shot. The point is, these kids for the
most part don't want to listen to some moron at the front of a
classroom saying &quot;Marajawana's bad, mmmkay?&quot; Most of them either are
used to or like the lifestyle. Come ninth grade I myself had had
experiences with drugs.
My first experience actually came at age two when I accidentally binged
on stomach medicine that had paregoric in it. Paregoric is an opium
tincture, by the way. By eighth grade, I had used various inhalants,
including laughing gas, but soon grew bored and quit. The following
year, I was high in school twice. The first time was when we using
ether in biology class .The second time was when Sam Karp blew a hit of
reefer smoke in my face.
The class was also a prescription for misery because the teacher, Mr.
Roberts was a real tool. He wasn't even the real teacher. The real
teacher had not surprisingly gotten a job somewhere else, and we were
stuck with a long term substitute. Mr. Roberts was an ineffectual bozo
who couldn't control the class to save his life. He was a prime target
for rowdy obnoxious kids who crucify substitutes of any kind,
especially since he looked like a frog.
I walked into the class for the first time and it was an absolute zoo.
I controlled myself and enjoyed the show. &quot;O.K. class, behave,&quot; he
said. No good. It was still rowdy. He started calling the roll. &quot;Mike
Donadio,&quot; he said.
&quot;No, it's Donardio,&quot; said Mike, laughing.
&quot;Stop making trouble,&quot; he said.
After he finished with the attendance. He addressed the class. &quot;O.K.
class, we are going to talk about violence in our communities.&quot; The
class didn't settle down. &quot;People, be quiet,&quot; he said. &quot;Settle down,&quot;
he said a little bit louder. That didn't work either. Finally, out of
nowhere, he made this weird chirping noise really loud: &quot;BRRRRRRRRT&quot;
Everybody died laughing, including myself. Twenty minutes into the
class, we settled down, and we had a discussion about the lesson.
One day saw us in the computer room. He wanted us to list ways we could
solve various problems in our communities. I could only think of one

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
thing. I wrote: &quot;If their was more understanding and communication
">

within the community there would be less violence.&quot; I showed it to him
while it was still on the computer. &quot;That's very good,&quot; he said. I
printed it out and gave it to him. He totally said something completely
different from what he said before. &quot;I know you can do better than
that,&quot; he said. &quot;I though you said it was good,&quot; I said in
disbelief. &quot;It's not enough,&quot; he said. I sighed, tore it up and threw
it in the recycling bin. I just hung around for the rest of the period
doing nothing. He eventually came up to me and said, &quot;Why aren't you
doing anything? You're a troublemaker. Keep this up you get F.&quot;
Sometimes in class, he gave us these worksheets to quiet us down. It
worked, but all we did was talk quietly. The worksheets had egregious
grammatical errors. &quot;Hey John,&quot; I said. John Lisa turned to me. I read
the worksheet. &quot;Check this out. 'How do cocaine effects the
body?'&quot; &quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; said John. &quot;What was he drunk?&quot; I said. &quot;No, he
was hitting the pipe,&quot; John said laughing. We both had a cheap snicker
Mr. Roberts' expense.
Finally our assignments degenerated into stupid grunt work. The class
became a typing class. We were given something xeroxed from a typing
book and we were supposed to copy some stupid paragraph. I refused flat
out to do any of these assignments, because they were hella tedious and
because I learned to type when I was three. I wasn't the only one. Most
of the kids went on the internet and got on porno sites and this one
gruesome site called www.rotten.com that showed accident victims, cases
of elephantiasis of the balls and dead people. &quot;Hey James,&quot; said
John. &quot;Check it out. Suicide in bed.&quot; The computer showed this dead guy
with his face no longer recognizable, and his brains splattered across
the wall. &quot;Whoa,&quot; I said. At one point, Mr. Roberts was bawling out
this one kid, Tommy &quot;Italian Ice&quot; Burwell. &quot;I want you to do your work
and don't give me any lip or you get F.&quot; &quot;Whatever, Kermit,&quot; said
Italian Ice. &quot;Look,&quot; said Mr. Roberts. &quot;I'm a black teacher with
degrees from two universities, and I don't appreciate you disrespecting
me.&quot; I found it pretty pathetic that he was playing the race card,
since I was one of five white kids out of a class of maybe fifteen
people. Besides, Italian Ice didn't even use the n-word. I turned to a
girl in the class. &quot;Where do you think he got his degrees?&quot; I said
sarcastically. &quot;Cracker Jack box,&quot; she said.
When Mr. Roberts left the room, Italian Ice said &quot;Hey guys, I got an
idea how we can get this motherfucker fired.&quot; Everybody turned toward
him. &quot;I got this movie, Kids, that I could bring in and have him show
it to the class. I mean, it is educational, after all, right? Since Dr.
Warner won't be having it, she'll fire him.&quot;
Everybody knew about the movie Kids. It was one of the most graphic and
controversial films of its day. I hadn't even seen it yet. I wanted to,
though. And in the process, I would help in getting a teacher fired.
Everybody, including myself responded to Tom with a resounding &quot;Hell,
yeah.&quot; Mr. Roberts came back in the room. &quot;Mr. Roberts,&quot; said Italian
Ice. &quot;I have an educational video that the class could watch. It's
called Kids.&quot; A few people smirked and snickered.
&quot;What's it about?&quot; he asked.
&quot;It's about sex, and peer pressure, drugs, and all that.&quot;
&quot;All right. Bring it in.&quot;
Mr. Roberts main weakness in this situation was that he had never heard
of the movie, since it's an obscure indie film. He also was unaware of
the fact that Italian Ice was a sneaky fucker. Most of the time he sold
us bootlegged videos and shoplifted candy. Other times he gave us the
candy to eat so he wouldn't get pinched. He easily sweet-talked Mr.
Roberts into letting him bring in a dirty film. Mr. Roberts was now set
up.
I called Italian Ice later that day. &quot;You really going through with
this?&quot; I asked. I couldn't believe what was happening. &quot;Yeah,&quot; he
said. &quot;You don't want me to?&quot;
&quot;No, it's a brilliant idea. I just can't believe it. Pretty ballsy, I
must say.&quot;
&quot;All right.&quot;
&quot;See you tomorrow,&quot; I said.
The following day, we sat for two periods, watching the movie. Our
faces lit up as we saw people doping, fucking, partying, drinking,
fighting, and so forth. Kids came from other classes, just to watch the
movie. Mr. Herndon came in the room. Everybody got really nervous and
somebody turned the movie off. As Mr. Herndon left the room, he had a
suspicious look in his eyes. I ignored it and continued to watch the
movie after he left.
The next day, Mr. Roberts came up to me in the hallway. &quot;I hope nobody
was trying to get revenge on me. I'm worried I might get fired for
this.&quot; I nodded and walked off. Mr. Roberts was at Co-op for a few more
months, but by the end of the year, we never saw him again.

Ms. Freeman's &quot;Class&quot; Sucks

Nobody will ever let you know
When you ask the reasons why.
They just tell you that you're on your own,
Fill your head all full of lies.

You bastards!

BLACK SABBATH: &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath&quot; (1973)
Written by Anthony Iommi, Terence Butler, William Ward and John Osbourne

&quot;Class,&quot; Mrs. Apicella, our French teacher said, &quot;In conjunction with
our study of French literature, we are going to work with Ms. Freeman.
She will come to our class every Thursday to teach us about various
forms of poetry. &quot;I sat there, wondering what this would be like. It
turned out to be quite an interesting experience.
Ms. Freeman came in the following Thursday. She was rather tall and had
a somewhat large nose, prominent front teeth, and a serious, dour
expression on her face. She was not very popular with the students at
all. Her rodent-like appearance earned her the nickname &quot;Master
Splinter.&quot; In later years, it transpired that she had no teaching
credentials whatsoever.
&quot;All right, everyone,&quot; she said. &quot;The first style we are going to learn
about is haiku. A haiku is a Japanese poem that is three lines long.
Each line has five syllables, seven syllables, and five syllables,
respectively.&quot;
&quot;Ms. Freeman,&quot; I said, raising my hand. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said.
&quot;I have a haiku.&quot; I quoted one that I had heard on an old episode of
Beavis and Butt-Head. &quot;That was cool, huh huh. When we killed that
frog, huh huh. It won't croak again.&quot; The class groaned.
&quot;Good,&quot; she said. &quot;Now write it in French.&quot; I went to the bookshelf,
got a French dictionary, and went to work. &quot;What I want the rest of you
to do is to write haikus and translate them into French. Don't worry if
they fall out of the format.&quot;
Within a few weeks, the novelty of having Ms. Freeman teach the class
soon wore off. As French class ended one Wednesday, Mrs. Apicella
addressed the class. &quot;Just to remind you, Ms. Freeman is coming
tomorrow.&quot; My friend John, who sat next to me scowled and said, &quot;Oh,
great,&quot; dripping sarcasm. &quot;What's wrong with Ms. Freeman?&quot; I asked him,
given that I was sort of oblivious to what was going on at the
time. &quot;She's got this attitude like she has some kind of bug up her
ass.&quot;
John turned out to be right. Ms. Freeman taught us various forms of
poetry, cinquain, free verse, and everything in between. What she did
was make us write a poem in whatever form we were learning and
translate it into French, and often times we had to do that sort of
thing for homework. But even though it was one way of learning new
words in French, I felt that what she did was totally non sequitur to
what we were doing, and it became tedious for everyone in the class,
including myself. Another reason why we weren't motivated was that she
had no sympathy for anyone who didn't have their homework. Usually,
everybody in the class didn't have their homework. We would get the
same rap from her on a daily basis. &quot;I am very disappointed in every
one of you,&quot; she said. &quot;When you people get to college, your professors
aren't going to care about what else you have on your schedule. If you
don't do your assignments when you are in college, then you will flunk
out of school.&quot; It was deathly still in the classroom. Nobody said
anything. &quot;In addition, if you do not do your homework in my class, it
will be reflected on your report card for this term. Your assignment,
due next time we meet, is a brief report on the life of Leon Damas. I
expect that everyone will have it, and I will not accept it if it is
late.&quot;
The following week, just before Ms. Freeman came in, two girls from my
homeroom were complaining to Mrs. Appicella about Ms. Freeman. I didn't
say anything. &quot;Mrs. Appicella, she gives too much work, and she doesn't
care about anything else you gotta do.&quot;
&quot;I understand how you feel about her, but do your classmates feel the
same way?&quot; asked Mrs Appicells.
&quot;Let's see,&quot; said one of the girls. &quot;If anyone thinks that Ms. Freeman
should stop teaching our class, raise your hand.&quot; Everyone's hand shot
up, including mine, although I had been rather quiet that day. One of
the girls looked at me in surprise. &quot;James, you are phony,&quot; she said. I
shrugged. Ms. Freeman came in shortly afterward. &quot;Does everybody have
their homework?&quot;
&quot;I found some stuff about him on the internet,&quot; said a girl named
Sylvia. Nobody else said a thing.
&quot;Sylvia at least looked him up on the internet and the rest of you
didn't do anything? I've told you again and again, when you get to
college, the professors aren't going to care about whether or not you
do your homework.They'll just flunk you if you don't. A friend of mine
has a woman clean her house. This woman is fluent in five languages.&quot;
Good for her, I thought. Why should we care? I mean, if she's so
fucking smart, why is it that all her knowledge of foreign languages
got her is a job cleaning houses? Shouldn't she have a more high-paying
career? She's fluent in five languages, isn't she?
Ms. Freeman continued. &quot;Given that there is a serious problem of not
doing homework among you, the next time any of you don't have the
homework, you will serve detention with me at ninth period, up in Room
306. Your assignment, due next time we meet is to write a poem, and
translate it into French.&quot;
Next Thursday, Ms. Freeman came into class. &quot;Please pass the homework
over to me,&quot; she said. The class did just that. She turned to
me. &quot;Where's your homework?&quot;
&quot;I don't have it,&quot; I said.
&quot;Well, you will have to serve detention today at ninth period.&quot; She
turned to another girl. &quot;What about yours?&quot;
&quot;I don't have it either,&quot; said the girl.
&quot;Well, you both will have to serve detention. Report to room 306 at
ninth period today, or else I will write you up and you will be
suspended.&quot;
When we reported to the sin bin, Ms. Freeman addressed us. &quot;You are
each to write 'Completion of homework is essential to success in
school' fifty times.&quot;
&quot;O.K.&quot; I said. Considering I definitely won't finish before the bell
rings, I thought. I got to work. Since I was thoroughly disgusted at
having to do this, I decided to be a lazy sod and write the sentence
once, and draw vertical lines down the page where every
lowercase &quot;p,&quot; &quot;l,&quot; &quot;t&quot;, &quot;h&quot; and &quot;k&quot; was and add the rest of the parts
of those letters. Then I would fill in the rest of the letters of the
sentence in their respective places. While I was hurting my wrist doing
this loathsome, oppressive task, a boy walked in. &quot;I'm here for the
detention for being tardy,&quot; he said. &quot;Since you came in late,&quot; she
said, &quot;you are to write 'Tardiness is a symptom of an unprepared
student, mind, and brain' fifty times.&quot; I stopped writing, shocked. &quot;If
you'll excuse me, I'll be back in a minute,&quot; she said, and left the
room. When the door closed, thus spewed forth a tirade from the mouth
of young James Geoffrey Parfitt Conrad. &quot;This is bullshit,&quot; I said
angrily. &quot;She is making me write this stupid punishment assignment,
simply because I didn't have my homework. Seriously, do you think this
motivates me? I mean, why should I care, since this is not part of my
French class!&quot; The other students started agreeing with me with cries
of &quot;Yeah, James!&quot; and &quot;Rock on!&quot; I continued. &quot;And
seriously, 'Tardiness is a symptom of an unprepared student, mind and
brain?' Well so is redundancy!&quot; At that moment, Ms. Freeman came back
into the room. I froze and gritted my teeth. &quot;Get back to work,&quot; she
said. I worked until the bell rang. I didn't finish, but I handed her
what I could get done.
As it turned out, I got a B in French for that marking period. God
dammit, why did I ever have to worry about Ms. Freeman's shit in the
first place? Personally, I think teachers shouldn't make harsh threats
against students if they're rarely followed through on, since they only
achieve the opposite of what the teacher wants to accomplish. For this
same reason, they shouldn't be made at all, period, whether or not they
are followed through on. I should know. I've seen it happen too often
for my liking.

Daydreaming Is Good For You

We freely speak of dreams.
We marvel at what they conceal,
But in my Wonderworld, each sleeping vision is so real.
So I believe and hope that all the things I see
May one day bring such truth and peace as we can feel.
Free from this waking world, deep in sleep's mystery,
My will is free to wander, free to wander carelessly.
At times it's not so far from what we call reality,
And at times I know I wonder if it all could come true.

URIAH HEEP: &quot;Wonderworld&quot; (1974)
Written by Kenneth Hensley

I really only have one happy memory of sophomore year. In drama class
one day, the teacher, Mrs. Kaczynski assembled us. &quot;Today we are going
to try a meditation exercise,&quot; she said. &quot;I want you to get into a
comfortable position, and go to a place that you create in your mind
where everything is perfect for you.&quot; I was collapsed listlessly on the
floor, and Mrs. Kaczynski walked up and stood over me. &quot;I see you're
ready, James.&quot; I laughed weakly. &quot;Believe me,&quot; I said. &quot;I need it&quot;.
This occurred on a day that I was sustaining myself on six hours of
sleep, so this was only a minimal remedy. Nonetheless, it was pleasing.
I lay on the carpeted floor in a fetal position, smiling, with my eyes
closed, and just breathed.
In my mind, I pictured myself in the middle of a green field with a
stream at the center of it wide enough to skip rocks across. Although
the sun would be always shining in spite of the rain, the weather was
always moderate. Everything I needed—food, drink, clothing, books,
music, tobacco, etc.—would be right at my disposal. The only other
people there besides me were either close friends of mine, or kind
strangers; anybody who could or would hurt me was excluded. The only
creatures there were benevolent ones—birds, butterflies, rabbits, etc.
In this place, I would lie on my back, looking for shapes in the
clouds, walk or run around, listen to music, read, write, play my
guitar, or talk to any person there without worry, even if that person
was a stranger, since nobody there would hurt me.
It's strange, isn't it? Only a decade before I was an energetic and
hyperactive kindergartener who used to run across the playground at
recess nonstop and only went through the motions when the teacher
announced that it was naptime. At this point, I was fifteen years old,
overburdened by school, and constantly sleep-deprived. It took me ten
years to realize how important it is just to be able to relax, and when
I was fifteen I realized that the opportunities become increasingly
scarce as one grows older.
I loved thinking about this place. The more we did the meditation
exercise, the more I felt as if there were any place I could live for
the rest of my life, it would be there. However, my time in that place
was always limited to ten minutes, and after that it was back to
reality. That notwithstanding, having &quot;gone&quot; there made me feel
refreshed, and ten minutes in that place was not only better that
naught, it was more than enough time for me to find the strength to get
through the rest of the day, which thankfully by then was more than
half over.

Chemistry Class Sucks

People try to put us d-down.
Talkin' 'bout my generation.
Just because we get around.
Talkin' 'bout my generation.
The things, they do look awful c-c-cold.
Talkin' 'bout my generation.
I hope I die before I get old.
Talkin' 'bout my generation.

This is my generation.
This is my generation, baby.

Why don't you all f-f-f-fade away?
Talkin' 'bout my generation.
And don't try to dig what we all s-s-s-say.
Talkin' 'bout my generation.
I'm not trying to cause a big s-s-s-sensation.
Talkin' 'bout my generation.
I'm just talkin' 'bout my g-g-g-generation.
Talkin' 'bout my generation.

This is my generation.
This is my generation, baby.

THE WHO: &quot;My Generation&quot; (1965)
Written by Peter Townshend

Although I don't even like to think about chemistry class in general
because it was so fucking tedious, there are some things I can remember
that were fairly amusing, such as the doodles I did on the inside front
cover of my spiral notebook, or scrawling &quot;Pink Floyd: Dark Side of the
Moon&quot; in my chemistry textbook near a picture of a prism with light
going through it. Even though stuff like that was non sequitur to what
I was really supposed to do in that class, I had no respect for Mrs.
Morrison and didn't really give two damns at the time, nor do I now.
I can actually pinpoint the event that caused me to lose respect for
her. As I was walking into class one day, Mrs. Morrison was handing out
xeroxed sheets. &quot;Today, we are going to take a survey about chemistry.
As soon as everybody is finished we are going to tally the results.&quot;
I looked at the survey. The first question was:

How much do you know about chemistry?
a) Nothing.
b) A Little.
c) A Fair Amount.
d) A Lot.

&quot;Oh, God,&quot; I said. I couldn't believe my eyes. What a crock of shit.
The survey was just pathetic, as was the person who created the survey.
I picked &quot;d&quot;, simply on the grounds that I had done a lot of geological
research, and had a substantially big rock collection, which I still
do. The next question was:

Which of the following do you think are made of chemicals?
a) Wood.
b) Books.
c) Household cleaners.
d) Fruit juices.
e) All of the above.

For fuck's sake, what was this detritus doing in a high school
chemistry textbook? The answer obviously was &quot;e&quot;. Next:

How often do you do something that involves chemistry?
a) Always
b) Frequently
c) Sometimes
d) Rarely
e) Never

God, how stupid did they think I was? I circled &quot;a&quot;. Finally, there was
one question left. This was an open ended question, as opposed to the
previous three. It read: &quot;Do you feel you need to know more about

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
chemistry?&quot; I wrote: &quot;No, because I'm sure that I'll learn new things
">

about chemistry on my own.&quot;
About a few minutes after I finished, Mrs. Morrison started tallying
the results of the survey. She did it like this: She would call out a
possible answer to each answer, except for the open ended question, and
had whoever put that answer down raise their hand, while a student
would record the results on the blackboard. I laid back and propped my
elbows on the desk behind me, which happened to be that of one of my
classmates, Lars. He didn't mind, though. I just sat there,
disinterested, raising my hand only when applicable.
Suddenly, right in the middle of tallying the survey Mrs. Morrison
started rebuking Lars. &quot;Lars, you have detention,&quot; she said.
&quot;What did I do?&quot; he said, puzzled, and a bit angry.
&quot;You were talking to Isis.&quot; Isis was a girl who sat next to Lars.
&quot;We were talking about the survey.&quot;
&quot;That doesn't matter.&quot;
Mrs. Morrison continued tallying the results of our survey. What a
bitch, I thought. Suddenly, Mrs. Morrison started rebuking Lars
again. &quot;Lars, that's another detention,&quot; she said.
&quot;Mrs. Morrison, I didn't do anything.&quot;
&quot;You were bothering Isis and James.&quot; I sat up and looked Mrs. Morrison
in the eye. &quot;Mrs. Morrison, Lars was not bothering me,&quot; I said,
somewhat disgruntled. &quot;Don't even try to involve me in this.&quot;
Mrs. Morrison continued to tally the survey, and finally, she came to
the open ended question. &quot;O.K., class I want some of you to tell me
what you put down for the open ended question. A girl raised her
hand. &quot;Ainette,&quot; Mrs. Morrison said.
&quot;I put down 'No', because I feel that I already know enough about
chemistry, anyway,&quot; said Ainette. &quot;O.K.,&quot; said Mrs. Morrison. I raised
my hand. &quot;James?&quot;
&quot;I put down the same thing, more or less,&quot; I said, listlessly.
Mrs. Morrison called on Lars. &quot;What did you put down, Lars?&quot;
&quot;I put down 'No', because I don't like you,&quot; he said. The room fell
silent, overcome with shock and disbelief. I turned around. Lars had
this defiant look on his face. &quot;Lars, that's another detention, and I
will call your mother.&quot; said Mrs. Morrison sternly.
&quot;I don't care,&quot; said Lars. The students started saying things
like &quot;Yeah, Lars&quot;, &quot;You tell her&quot;, &quot;You go, boy&quot;, etc. Mrs Morrison
looked at Lars. &quot;Would you like another detention?&quot; she said, the tone
in her voice becoming dangerous.
&quot;I don't care. I don't like you. Whenever I learn anything related to
chemistry, I'm reminded of you,&quot; said Lars.
&quot;I don't teach this class to be liked.&quot;
&quot;Good, because I don't like you.&quot;
&quot;Lars, I think you had better stop before you get another detention. I
will definitely call your parents and arrange a conference.&quot; Lars
shrugged.
Later, near the end of class, I approached Lars. &quot;I gotta tell ya,
man,&quot; I said. &quot;That was one of the ballsiest things I've ever seen.&quot;
&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Lars, somewhat exasperated by the whole situation. &quot;I'm
just sick of her shit, that's all. The detention's no big deal, it's
just that my mom's going to find out that I flunked chemistry class.&quot;
&quot;It won't be too bad, I bet,&quot; I said.
Isis piped up. &quot;You know, I can't stand teachers who expect more of us
honor students all the time, just because we make good grades.&quot;
&quot;I know,&quot; I said. &quot;It's a fuckin' stereotype.&quot;
We got to keep the surveys. As I was leaving the class, I realized my
sinuses were congested, so I took the survey and blew my nose in it. My
nose felt kind of raw afterward, but hey, small price to pay for
showing genuine contempt.
Not long afterward, in fact, it might have been the following Thursday
if memory serves, I found myself in the same situation. This kid was
visiting our school. He was in my chemistry class, and was sitting next
to me as Mrs. Morrison was lecturing us. &quot;So what do you think?&quot; I said.
&quot;Boring,&quot; he said.
Soon, he produced an egg of Silly Putty, opened it, took a smidgen, and
rolled it into a miniscule ball. I turned toward him. &quot;What are you
going to do with that?&quot; I asked.
&quot;I'm gonna wing it at her.&quot;
I smiled. &quot;Cool.&quot;
A few minutes passed, and he threw it at her. I didn't notice, and
neither did she. Stupid, senile old bitch. Oh well. I turned to him
again. &quot;Did you do it?&quot; I asked.
Just then, Mrs. Morrison directed her attention to me. &quot;James, I want
you to sit here,&quot; she said, gesturing to a seat near the front of the
class.
&quot;Mrs. Morrison, if you want me to stop talking, I will.&quot;
&quot;That's good, but I want you to sit here.&quot;
&quot;I'm all comfortable, though.&quot;
&quot;Too bad.&quot;
&quot;I don't want to, though.&quot;
&quot;James, I want you to sit there, and that's that.&quot;
&quot;Fine, if it makes you happy, I'll sit there. God!&quot; I got up, picked up
my books, and moved. After I had sat down, Mrs. Morrison handed me a
detention slip for Friday, after school. Great, I thought.
As I was leaving her class on Friday she said, &quot;James, don't forget,
today at 1:30.&quot; I nodded, and went on to fifth period. But when I came
to the room at 1:30, I was in for a shock. The door was locked up
tight. Mrs. Morrison wasn't even there. I couldn't believe it. Why the
hell did she give me detention, God forbid, remind me, and then not
even show up? Christ. &quot;SCREW YOU, MRS. MORRISON!&quot; I said at the top of
my lungs, and then just walked my ass out of there. She didn't even say
anything to me afterward. What a waste of my precious time.

A Lost Opportunily

I want to live,
I want to give.
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.
It's these expressions I never give
That keep me searching for a heart of gold,
And I'm getting old.
Keeps me searching for a heart of gold,
And I'm getting old.

NEIL YOUNG: &quot;Heart Of Gold&quot; (1972)

I had the chance to have a real relationship for the first time during
sophomore year. In drama class, during a lull in the teaching, I saw a
short girl, with sandy blond hair, and perhaps the most lovely face I
had seen up to that point. I walked over to her. &quot;Hello,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm
James.&quot;
&quot;I'm Kelly,&quot; she said.
&quot;Where are you visiting from?&quot; I asked.
&quot;I live in Ansonia.&quot;
&quot;What kind of music are you into?&quot;
&quot;I like classic rock. You know, Beatles, Stones, Floyd, Zep, the Who.&quot;
&quot;Good stuff, especially, the Who,&quot; I said.
&quot;Great band,&quot; she said. &quot;'Substitute' is a good song.&quot;
&quot;Yeah,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm really into astrology. What's your sign?&quot;
&quot;My birthday is May 1st. I'm a Taurus.&quot;
&quot;You must be pretty stubborn,&quot; I said.
&quot;Oh, yeah.&quot;
Looking down at her notebook, I saw that she had various South Park
characters drawn on it. &quot;You like South Park ?&quot; I asked, even though it
was self-evident.
&quot;Uh-huh. My friends and I worship that show.&quot;
I started talking like Cartman. &quot;Yeah, that show is really cool. It
kicks ass.&quot; She laughed a little. &quot;Can I borrow your notebook?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Sure,&quot; she said, handing it to me.
I drew a picture of Cartman, his mouth wide open and his eyes squeezed
shut, screaming, &quot;Goddammit, I'm not fat, I'm big boned!!&quot; She laughed
and thanked me.
Shortly afterward, I excused myself to go to the lavatory. When I got
back, she ripped a small piece of paper from her notebook and gave it
to me. It had her phone number on it. I smiled and thanked her.
Later, near the end of lunch, I saw her. She looked me dead in the eye
with a soft smile on her face. Knowing not what words to say, I smiled
back, said &quot;Hi,&quot; and went on my merry way to geometry class, assuring
myself I would call her later. But when I looked for her number, I
couldn't find it. Where the hell could it have gone? I frantically
searched for it, but no such luck.
I had the chance to have a real relationship for the first time during
sophomore year. Of course, I just had to fuck it up.

Heartbreaker, Soulshaker

Talky jivey, poison ivy.
You ain't gonna cling to me.
Man taker, born faker.
I ain't so blind I can't see.
Red hot mama, velvet charmer,
The time's come to pay your dues.

Now you're messin' with a,
A son of a bitch.
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch.
Now you're messin' with a,
A son of a bitch.
Now you're messin' with a son of a bitch.

NAZARETH: &quot;Hair Of The Dog&quot; (1975)
Written by William McCafferty, Peter Agnew, Manuel Charlton and Darrell
Sweet

I remember once I had this terrible tream. I was in some crummy old
hotel in the backwoods on the Mississippi River, somewhere out in East
Bumfuck, and there were cottonmouth snakes all over the place. I kept
getting bitten by all these poisonous snakes, and yet I wasn't dying.
Some time after I had the dream, Catherine Gardner joined our happy
Cooperative Arts And Humanities Magnet High School family in September
of 1998. She was shorter than me, with a tanned complexion, long, dark
hair, dark eyes, and was extremely curvaceous. As she walked into my
U.S. History class, my head turned toward her. &quot;Class,&quot; said Mr.
Herndon, &quot;we have a new student. Her name is Catherine Gardner. She is
transferring here from Wolcott. Why don't we all introduce ourselves.&quot;
We all took turns saying our names.
However, it wasn't until fifth period drama class that day, that I
learned her secret. &quot;Class,&quot; said Mrs. Kaczynski, &quot;We have a new
student. This is Catherine Gardner. She is an actress who has been on
the soap opera All My Children.&quot; There was a smattering of applause
from the rest of the class. I got down on one knee and asked her &quot;Can I
have your autograph?&quot;
&quot;James, sit down,&quot; said Shannon, somewhat exasperated.
One day, in early October, I was sitting at the lunch table with
Catherine, Lizzy Whitney, Tassia, and a slick boy named Geoff Pusko. I
sat next to Catherine. We were socializing, as usual, when suddenly
Geoff said, &quot;Hey Catherine, I dare you to kiss James.&quot; I didn't think
much would happen. After about a minute, she gave me a peck on the
cheek. Since at the time, I was an extreme romantic introvert, and
since this kiss came from a celebrity of sorts, my ego was inflated to
dangerous proportions. Everybody looked at me, waiting for me to say
something. &quot;Kick ass,&quot; I said, imitating Cartman, a character from
South Park, one of my favorite T.V. shows.
&quot;Oh, wow, I feel so bad,&quot; said Catherine. I didn't know then why she
said that, nor do I now. At any rate, after lunch, I approached her and
said, &quot;Catherine, I don't think you had anything to feel bad about.
Sure, that was sorta random, but I appreciated it.&quot;
&quot;James,&quot; she said, and kissed me on the cheek, and then walked away,
leaving me speechless, but sort of in a good way. As I was going to my
next class, Tassia approached me. &quot;Do you like Catherine?&quot; she
asked. &quot;I dunno,&quot; I said. &quot;She seems kinda fine.&quot;
&quot;Well I just thought you might like to know, she really likes you.&quot;
I smiled to myself. This girl, it seemed really had the hots for me,
and if we were an item, the fact that A: I would have a girlfriend and
B: she was a celebrity, no less, would boost my status as well as my
ego. That's how I wanted it to happen. But unfortunately, or actually
in retrospect, fortunately, it didn't happen that way. Every time I
asked Catherine if we could get together, she kept dragging her feet
about it. She'd usually give excuses like &quot;I'm seeing someone&quot;, &quot;I'm
busy&quot;, etc. However, from time to time she'd look at me as if she
really dug me. Plus, every so often, Catherine would hand me a rather
syrupy love letter. She always said she was relaying some message that
some girl really dug me. One of them said:

Dear James:

I really love the way you look. You have the best body of all the boys
in the school. I especially love your blue eyes. Maybe we could go
downtown someday!

—Your Secret Admirer

In the middle of October, I went out to California because my oldest
brother Peter was getting married on the 18th. The reception was held
under a pavilion in a vineyard in Woodside, California. As I was
shuffling around tired and a tad drunk, a small but pretty girl about
my brother's age with a wine glass in her hand gestured toward me, so I
went to her. &quot;Hi, I'm the groom's brother, James,&quot; I said offering a
warm handshake. &quot;What's your name?&quot;
&quot;Amy. I'm a friend of Peter's from college. How old are you, James?&quot;
&quot;Fifteen.&quot;
&quot;Really?&quot; she said, amazed.
&quot;Yeah, I'm tall, so I get that a lot. Where do you live?&quot;
&quot;Los Angeles. And you?&quot;
&quot;I'm from New Haven. Born and raised. What's your sign?&quot; This was
around the time I was starting to show interest in astrology. She was
really amazed when I said this. Finally, after she calmed down a bit
she said &quot;Virgo. What are you?&quot;
&quot;I am a Capricorn. Single-minded, practical, industrious, ambitious,
overcompetitive, arrogant...&quot;
&quot;I take it you're into astrology. What are Virgos like?&quot; she asked.
&quot;Meticulous, honest, tidy, finicky......&quot;
&quot;I'm kinda like that. Would you like a sip of my wine?&quot; she asked.
&quot;O.K.,&quot; I said calmly, and had a small sip.
&quot;You know, James, you are a looker.&quot;
&quot;Thanks,&quot; I said appreciatively.
&quot;I just want to tell you one thing. Don't go breaking young girl's
hearts.&quot;
I didn't know that she was flirting with me. I stepped outside the
pavilion into the parking lot and walked around for a bit. I saw a five
dollar bill, and snatched it up. &quot;Cool,&quot; I said. After about five
minutes I saw Amy walking fast toward me, arms outstretched, crying
out &quot;Oh, James, the love of my life!&quot; I smiled, hugged her, and gave
her a kiss on the cheek.
Given that I was single at the time, and because Catherine was
continuously dragging her feet about the two of us going out, I boasted
to my friends about Amy. Eventually, Catherine found out, and all
fucking hell broke loose. In class one day, the two of us were sitting
together, and talking, when she asked, &quot;James, you don't have a
girlfriend, do you?&quot;
&quot;Well, no, not right now, I don't think.&quot;
&quot;What about me?&quot;
&quot;Uhh......&quot;
&quot;What about that girl you met in California?&quot; Tassia piped up.
&quot;Oh, she just flirted with me. I wasn't planning...&quot;
&quot;She WHAT?&quot; Catherine suddenly became furious and this unnerved me.
&quot;Flirted with me, that's all. Sure, I kissed her, but...&quot;
&quot;YOU DID WHAT, JAMES?!!&quot;
&quot;I kissed her.&quot;
Suddenly, it appeared that Catherine was crying, but I couldn't see her
face and therefore couldn't tell just yet. &quot;Come on!&quot; I said. &quot;It was
just a peck on the cheek!&quot;
&quot;What was her name?&quot; said Tassia, angrily.
&quot;Amy,&quot; I said.
&quot;Oh my God,&quot; said Catherine, sobbing.
&quot;I can't believe this, James,&quot; said Tassia. &quot;Look at Catherine!&quot;
Catherine faced me. She actually was crying. &quot;Oh no,&quot; I said under my
breath. &quot;Tassia, can I tell my side of the story?&quot;
&quot;No, James,&quot; she said curtly. &quot;Don't even say anything. Don't even sit
at the lunch table.&quot; Ginny and Shannon also started chastising me as
well. Tassia had explicitly instructed me not to sit at the cafeteria
table at lunchtime, but I was determined to get my side of the story
across. I sat down at the table. &quot;What the fuck did I tell you?&quot; asked
Tassia angrily.
&quot;I don't care,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm going to defend myself whether you want me
to or not. To begin with, the very idea of me going out with Amy was
furthest from my mind. She may be a nice person, but she lives in L.A.
Let's be realistic. L.A. is way the hell out there, and I'm stuck here.
Why the hell would I want to do that? Since I don't pay the phone bill,
it wouldn't be too fair of me to make long distance calls all the time.
Plus, I don't particularly like flying. If I went out with Amy, it
would cost me too damn much.&quot; I took a deep breath and turned to
Catherine. &quot;If I did you wrong, I'm sorry.&quot;
&quot;It's O.K., James, I was just kidding.&quot; I walked over to her with the
intent to give her a hug, but got a handshake, which was good enough. I
know I should have been angry, but I didn't care.
After awhile, I decided that I didn't really want to go out with her.
To begin with, she lived way the hell out in Wolcott, and in addition,
she kept dragassing her feet about going out with me. Judging what I
would find out about her, it perhaps was one of the best decisions I
had made. I rode my bike into school on a chilly December morning,
locked it up, and went to a cafe down the street from the school called
The Coffee Table, which was a favorite haunt of hers. Sure enough, she
was there. At any rate, I walked in, and approached her. &quot;Can I talk
with you privately?&quot; I asked.
&quot;Sure,&quot; she said rather casually.
We went outside, and I
