Everything is on YouTube. ;)  I figured there must be  clips of
excited ferrets, and so there are.

Another thing I really enjoy is that a group of ferrets is called a
"business of ferrets."  Just that idea cracks me up.  I get some
interesting pictures in my mind. ;)

If you want to see more ferret movies, I have several of my ferrets on You
Tube, just look for Fuzzmom.

Ferrets are der biz.  I had them for 10 years or so.  They are not to be
taken on lightly though.  To keep them properly is a lot of time and trouble
but...I do miss mine.
Mostly they are lovely but here is a tale of what not to do with a ferret.

My late DH was a drinker.  He came home after a Saturday lunchtime session
the worse for wear.  He was still in friendly mode and decided he wanted to
say  hello to the ferrets.  He took a female ferret out of her hutch and
held her up to his face.  He was so ferret-friendly that he nuzzled her.
That was okay.  Then he started to play games where he held her and kept
zooming her towards his face - like I've seen people do with babies.  It's
supposed to be fun.
She started to open her mouth so I knew immediately she didn't like it.  I
told him to stop, that she was going to bite him, but hey, what did I know?
So he carried on.
So she bit him right through his lip. Served him right ;-)

Don't they though!!   Except that unlike kittens, they never grow up!

Never thought of looking on utube,  I miss mine too sometimes Tweed,
so I get my fix at a friend's house. :)

It sounds like the title of a murder mystery. :)

But yes, that's a particularly nice collective noun.
