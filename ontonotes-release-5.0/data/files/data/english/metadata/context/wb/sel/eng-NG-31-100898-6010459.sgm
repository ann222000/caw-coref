The skill is in playing so that people can't tell
that one is playing. Stumper is very sneaky
and stealthy about that. But one telling feature
is that he is incredibly stable. The people who
fake enlightenment (for real) and make inane,
cryptic remarks to look enlightened have
tended to break, and break hard, within a few
years. It seems to me that faking enlightenment
(with all the supposed paradoxes and inanities)
tends to mess up the human psyche so severely
that spiraling lunacy almost automatically
ensues. Whatever little gains from that scarcely
make it worth it. As you say, honesty is the
best strategy.

There is a distinction. Honesty to oneself is what I

My dear sweet and loving son, Robert, others are fluff.  You are fluff.
It is ok for one to be dishonest to fluff, because fluff is just
fluff, and others are fluff, so one is only being dishonest to the
fluff of one's own mind, while one masterfully baits the fluff.  All
that matters is to be serene and honest to oneself, as others are
merely fluff.  Many of these people feel ahead of time that they are
about to crash and break up or down, and so they come to TRB to crash
and break up or down in front of the public, as if they want witnesses
to their crash and break up or down. The rage that followed the crash
and break up or down, as with Hal, Sphere, and Jigme (now posting under
the nym of DharmaTroll and still seething with hatred and vengeance
because I pointed out his crash seven years ago) could precede the
crash and break up or down, as with Lightfoot. It could also both
precede and follow it, as with the crashed and pathetic Fu.  There is
never any reason for one to be honest with these crashers, just be
serene and bait them as they are looking for help to crash, as that is
probably why they even came here.  One is actually being compassionate
by means of one's dishonesty and masterful baiting.  But all of this is
made up, it is all fluff in the closed loop of my mind.  Nothing to
worry about.  Just be serene.  All is fluff-ed off.  All is fluff.

Hee Hee, I am serene, I am serenely in the Kingdom of Grace, only
others are crashed.  I only tell them what they need as they come here
to crash.  They are all fluff, all is fluff, all is in my mind, nobody
can bother me.  Other people are hot and bothered, they are not serene
and locked in closed loop as am I.  Hee hee hee.  I laugh my teeth out
when I read Stumper's wonderful posts.  Stumper can't do anything with
somebody who is at peace with himself and in reconciliation with
himself. Such a person will instantly perceive his intentions and laugh
his teeth out at them, if he perceives them as hostile (I am not saying
that Stumper's intentions are hostile, but hypothetically, somebody who
is at peace with himself, jerking off with himself, and in
reconciliation with himself, will instantly perceive Stumper's
intentions and laugh his teeth out at them, *if* he perceives them as
hostile).  But a person who is not at peace with himself and in
reconciliation with himself may well charge in to reify Stumper's
words, make them hard and real, and impale himself on them, all
unasked. It may well be fated. This, regardless of Stumper's
intentions, which can be innocent (I am not saying that they are
innocent, but that they can well be innocent). So one need not reify
Stumper's words or Stumper, but let them only apply to Stumper.  I am
serene, only in conversation with myself in the closed loop of my mind,
hand, and penis, while words are fluff, Stumper is fluff, Robert is
fluff, Tara is fluff, and one cannot care about fluff, one can only
take fluff as fluff and be serene.  But all this is made up, just
disregard it and be serene.

&gt; My dear sweet and loving son, Robert, others are fluff.  You are fluff.
&gt;  It is ok for one to be dishonest to fluff, because fluff is just
&gt; fluff, and others are fluff, so one is only being dishonest to the
&gt; fluff of one's own mind, while one masterfully baits the fluff.  All
&gt; that matters is to be serene and honest to oneself, as others are
&gt; merely fluff.  Many of these people feel ahead of time that they are
&gt; about to crash and break up or down, and so they come to TRB to crash
&gt; and break up or down in front of the public, as if they want witnesses
&gt; to their crash and break up or down. The rage that followed the crash
&gt; and break up or down, as with Hal, Sphere, and Jigme (now posting under
&gt; the nym of DharmaTroll and still seething with hatred and vengeance
&gt; because I pointed out his crash seven years ago) could precede the
&gt; crash and break up or down, as with Lightfoot. It could also both
&gt; precede and follow it, as with the crashed and pathetic Fu.  There is
&gt; never any reason for one to be honest with these crashers, just be
&gt; serene and bait them as they are looking for help to crash, as that is

&gt; How many sons have you got?  :D
">

Hee hee hee, all of the posters here are my sons for two reasons,
sweetie.  First, after
years and decades studying the minutiae of Buddhist theory and
practice, I here stand back and present the Buddha's Buddhism.  I alone
am perfect and rigid and have nothing to learn, and everyone else here
needs to learn and be taught harsh lessons, so I call them my sons for
that reason as I am like a father to all.  And secondly, they are like
suns, because they tend to go supernova and blow up in technicolor and
surround sound.  Poke them with a few words on the screen and they blow
up, and the same words can be used year after year with the same
effect.  I don't touch the nice people and the little people,  unless
they willingly want to bend over, but only the biggies and meanies.
And they never learn, year after year. They keep charging in to make
claims.  Of course they can also stop reading my posts and replying to
them, so that my tests will go unread and untaken, but their ego stands
in the way.  Some people blow up on mere words on the screen year in
year out, some people get frantic, impulsive, jumpy, impetuous when I
constantly insult them and some people lose balance and perspective and
get carried away by little details in a recurrent and predictable
manner, etc.  The people who throw temper tantrums whenever they get
challenged, especially regarding their claimed attainments, are quite
easy to show up.  They get hugely angry and hateful whenever their
claimed attainments are challenged -- and I know all of this from my
unquestionable intuition from practicing serenity for so many decades
-- I can know everything about a posters' thoughts and intentions and
even childhood, and what's best for them after reading a few posts.  I
stay completely serene, mentating on fluff, and treating all of them
and all of their words as fluff, thus constantly proving that only I
pass the greatest tests and achieve the greatest attainments, and of
course these boards provide the most accurate tests of attainment that
exist.  For I am serene and to me they don't exist, they are fluff,
their words are fluff, all is fluff, and not caring about anyone and
seeing that everyone is fluff only in my mind is what not mentating the
world means, which is full awakening of course.  And so nobody bothers
me.  I am serene and all is fluff, dear.  Come be my stooge and bend
over, my sweet and loving son.  Remember, it is all fluff.

&gt;&gt; ~Stumper

&gt; Hee Hee, I am serene, I am serenely in the Kingdom of Grace, only
&gt; others are crashed.  I only tell them what they need as they come here
&gt; to crash.  They are all fluff, all is fluff, all is in my mind, nobody
&gt; can bother me.  Other people are hot and bothered, they are not serene
&gt; and locked in closed loop as am I.  Hee hee hee.  I laugh my teeth out
&gt; when I read Stumper's wonderful posts.  Stumper can't do anything with
&gt; somebody who is at peace with himself and in reconciliation with
&gt; himself. Such a person will instantly perceive his intentions and laugh
&gt; his teeth out at them, if he perceives them as hostile (I am not saying
&gt; that Stumper's intentions are hostile, but hypothetically, somebody who
&gt; is at peace with himself, jerking off with himself, and in
&gt; reconciliation with himself, will instantly perceive Stumper's
&gt; intentions and laugh his teeth out at them, *if* he perceives them as
&gt; hostile).  But a person who is not at peace with himself and in
&gt; reconciliation with himself may well charge in to reify Stumper's
&gt; words, make them hard and real, and impale himself on them, all
&gt; unasked. It may well be fated. This, regardless of Stumper's
&gt; intentions, which can be innocent (I am not saying that they are
&gt; innocent, but that they can well be innocent). So one need not reify
&gt; Stumper's words or Stumper, but let them only apply to Stumper.  I am
&gt; serene, only in conversation with myself in the closed loop of my mind,
&gt; hand, and penis, while words are fluff, Stumper is fluff, Robert is
&gt; fluff, Tara is fluff, and one cannot care about fluff, one can only
&gt; take fluff as fluff and be serene.  But all this is made up, just
&gt; disregard it and be serene.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; everyone as you do, they wouldn't have any friends.  At the very least they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be told to fluff off.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; soooo....Fluff Off.  ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tara

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is a distinction. Honesty to oneself is what I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; talk about here. With that honesty to oneself as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; basis, one can play with others. But without that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; honesty to oneself, one is gone for good, regardless
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of how one deals with others. That is the distinction.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There is no contradiction.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tang &quot;Fluff Off&quot; Huyen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No virtue in being honest to others?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What kind of fluffing bull-fluff is that?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Robert
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - - - - - - - -
&gt;&gt;&gt; My dear sweet and loving son, Robert, others are fluff.  You are fluff.
&gt;&gt;&gt;  It is ok for one to be dishonest to fluff, because fluff is just
&gt;&gt;&gt; fluff, and others are fluff, so one is only being dishonest to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; fluff of one's own mind, while one masterfully baits the fluff.  All
&gt;&gt;&gt; that matters is to be serene and honest to oneself, as others are
&gt;&gt;&gt; merely fluff.  Many of these people feel ahead of time that they are
&gt;&gt;&gt; about to crash and break up or down, and so they come to TRB to crash
&gt;&gt;&gt; and break up or down in front of the public, as if they want witnesses
&gt;&gt;&gt; to their crash and break up or down. The rage that followed the crash
&gt;&gt;&gt; and break up or down, as with Hal, Sphere, and Jigme (now posting under
&gt;&gt;&gt; the nym of DharmaTroll and still seething with hatred and vengeance
&gt;&gt;&gt; because I pointed out his crash seven years ago) could precede the
&gt;&gt;&gt; crash and break up or down, as with Lightfoot. It could also both
&gt;&gt;&gt; precede and follow it, as with the crashed and pathetic Fu.  There is
&gt;&gt;&gt; never any reason for one to be honest with these crashers, just be
&gt;&gt;&gt; serene and bait them as they are looking for help to crash, as that is
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably why they even came here.  One is actually being compassionate
&gt;&gt;&gt; by means of one's dishonesty and masterful baiting.  But all of this is
&gt;&gt;&gt; made up, it is all fluff in the closed loop of my mind.  Nothing to
&gt;&gt;&gt; worry about.  Just be serene.  All is fluff-ed off.  All is fluff.

&gt; Hee hee hee, all of the posters here are my sons for two reasons,
&gt; sweetie.  First, after
&gt; years and decades studying the minutiae of Buddhist theory and
&gt; practice, I here stand back and present the Buddha's Buddhism.  I alone
&gt; am perfect and rigid and have nothing to learn, and everyone else here
&gt; needs to learn and be taught harsh lessons, so I call them my sons for
&gt; that reason as I am like a father to all.  And secondly, they are like
&gt; suns, because they tend to go supernova and blow up in technicolor and
&gt; surround sound.  Poke them with a few words on the screen and they blow
&gt; up, and the same words can be used year after year with the same
&gt; effect.  I don't touch the nice people and the little people,  unless
&gt; they willingly want to bend over, but only the biggies and meanies.
&gt; And they never learn, year after year. They keep charging in to make
&gt; claims.  Of course they can also stop reading my posts and replying to
&gt; them, so that my tests will go unread and untaken, but their ego stands
&gt; in the way.  Some people blow up on mere words on the screen year in
&gt; year out, some people get frantic, impulsive, jumpy, impetuous when I
&gt; constantly insult them and some people lose balance and perspective and
&gt; get carried away by little details in a recurrent and predictable
&gt; manner, etc.  The people who throw temper tantrums whenever they get
&gt; challenged, especially regarding their claimed attainments, are quite
&gt; easy to show up.  They get hugely angry and hateful whenever their
&gt; claimed attainments are challenged -- and I know all of this from my
&gt; unquestionable intuition from practicing serenity for so many decades
&gt; -- I can know everything about a posters' thoughts and intentions and
&gt; even childhood, and what's best for them after reading a few posts.  I
&gt; stay completely serene, mentating on fluff, and treating all of them
&gt; and all of their words as fluff, thus constantly proving that only I
&gt; pass the greatest tests and achieve the greatest attainments, and of
&gt; course these boards provide the most accurate tests of attainment that
&gt; exist.  For I am serene and to me they don't exist, they are fluff,
&gt; their words are fluff, all is fluff, and not caring about anyone and
&gt; seeing that everyone is fluff only in my mind is what not mentating the
&gt; world means, which is full awakening of course.  And so nobody bothers
&gt; me.  I am serene and all is fluff, dear.  Come be my stooge and bend

Pretty good there, Stumper my sweet and loving son.
Just to correct your spelling:

"There's nothing cliche'd about here and now."

The here and now is not subject to criteria and
references.

And the irony is that the here and now is much
cliche'd in Zennie circles. But as you have noticed,
some of the Zennie wannabes display little sense
of the here and now. They know that they have to
resort to the cliche of the here and now to look
Zennie, but can't live it beyond the lip service.

Without them, there would not be much to talk about.

Hell, if anyone can do that, then from my LSD experiences alone, not to

enlightened, but God!  I've had tripping moments back in my teens where
I was utterly convinced that I was the World Soul in disguise
pretending to hide behind the eyes in the mirror, and that the whole
universe was some sort of super-synchronous novel, of sorts, and that
every song on the radio, no matter how I changed the dial, was meant
for me at that moment.  And I can go on and on.

I had such a moment driving to work the other day, when I suddenly
started thinking about how all the molecules in my body were billions
of years old and forged in the hearts of stars long since dead (I had
just read a cool astronomy article) and I was awed for a moment at a
stoplight and suddenly the memory of Delenn's words suddenly echoed
through the caverns of my humongous ego and I felt shivers up and down
my spine.

Do I claim (or even secretly egoistically believe) that I had some
kensho or satori?  Hell no.  Such interpretations only squeeze dry the
original traditional Zen terms of any meaning at all.  More like makyo,
I say!  That's why I laugh at a moronayanist bozo who babbles, "well,

silly it is and how easy it is to be duped by one's own interpretations

why Kornfield's book on doing the laundry after the ecstasy makes so
much sense to me.  That's where the real awakening is, in the slow
process of deepening and opening the heart more, not in flashy mystical
and sci-fi inspirations, as fun and thought provoking as they are.

--My Divine Grace Yabba Dabba Dukkha Dharmakaya Trollpa

Sheridan: What makes you think this is the right place for me?

Delenn: The universe puts us in places where we can learn. They are
never easy places, but they are right. The pain that sometimes comes is
part of the process of constantly being born.

Sheridan: You sound like you've been doing some thinking about this on
your own.

Delenn: Perhaps. We both, I suppose, are going through transitions. But
the universe knows what it is doing.

Sheridan: I wish I had your faith in the universe, I just don't see it
sometimes.

Delenn: Then I will let you in on a secret, Captain. Perhaps the
greatest of all time. The molecules of your body are the same molecules
that make up this station and the nebula outside that burn inside the
stars themselves. We are star stuff, we are the universe made manifest
trying to figure itself out. As we have learned, sometimes the universe
requires a change of perspective.

[A couple of scenes later:]

Sheridan: Have you ever had a long talk with ambassador Delenn,
Commander?

Ivanova: From time to time, Why?

Sheridan: She and the universe seem to have a special relationship.

Ivanova: Don't we all?

Sheridan: (Ponders for several seconds) Star stuff? (Still pondering)&gt;&gt;

You misunderstood as usual.

If a rape victim suddenly realize that
she cannot hate her rapist any longer,
she is not quite awakened
but is sharing something common
with all fully awakened Zen masters.

Surely you have heard of Tathagatagarbha.
How is your awareness here and now
different from those of fully awakened beings?

BTW I seriously doubt
any fully awakened being would start a family.

&gt; after year. They keep charging in to make claims.  Of course they can
&gt; also stop reading my posts and replying to them, so that my tests will
&gt; go unread and untaken, but their ego stands in the way.  Some people

&gt; regarding their claimed attainments, are quite easy to show up.  They
&gt; get hugely angry and hateful whenever their claimed attainments are
&gt; challenged -- and I know all of this from my unquestionable intuition
&gt; from practicing serenity for so many decades -- I can know everything
&gt; about a posters' thoughts and intentions and even childhood, and what's
&gt; best for them after reading a few posts.  I stay completely serene,
&gt; mentating on fluff, and treating all of them and all of their words as
&gt; fluff, thus constantly proving that only I pass the greatest tests and
&gt; achieve the greatest attainments, and of course these boards provide
&gt; the most accurate tests of attainment that exist.  For I am serene and
&gt; to me they don't exist, they are fluff, their words are fluff, all is
&gt; fluff, and not caring about anyone and seeing that everyone is fluff
&gt; only in my mind is what &quot;not mentating the world&quot; means, which is full
&gt; awakening, of course.  And so nobody bothers me.  I am serene and all
&gt; is fluff, dear.  Come be my stooge and bend over, my sweet and loving
&gt; son.  Remember, it is all fluff.

Oh, My Dear Pan-Fried Oriental Entree,

Don't worry. Just as the Buddha intended to instantiate
and perpetuate a religion (in spite of having to be
persistently persuaded to "teach"- ha!), and the music
sponsors drag out stale old Beethoven Symphonies just
to showcase some ghastly bits of modern "music", so
too will your own efforts be forever archived and
preserved in the soon-to-be-infinite jar of google's
pickled vegetables.

No effort is needed, no work need be done. No beads of
sweat need appear upon the brow, no effort need be expended.
Serenity is simply something you can choose as easily as
ordering a pizza or sneering at that antique CD of some
ancient piano concerto while buying the complete orchestral
works of, say, Amy Williams, and reveling in their unique
construction and sound just as you would if you brushed
your teeth with sand, downloaded a really loud sheet-metal
garage band piece, or tuned your radio to the static station.

It's entirely unnecessary to spend time practicing Chan/Zen
or Soto/Vipisanna - they are a waste. Just be serene,
fluff up, read some philosophy - no work needed. As we
all know, "buddhism seeks to transcend the world". Oh -
wait a minute - there's something wrong with the orchestra...
No - "adaptation to reality, be it social, economic,
politicaland *religious* reality, is part of Buddhism". Whoops -
this program is not responding...please press &lt;exit&gt;.

And, btw - anyone who claims to be "enlightened" has to
meet my criteria for that particular piece of catshit.
I mean, how would it be if there were no "standards"?
Anarchy would reign! Nobody would be able to get a proper
certificate! There would be no "masters", no Buddha, no
Lineage! We need Standards, Tests, Definitions! What the
hell is happening to the Buddhist Educational System anyway?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all definitions are delusions too, and if
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there seems to be a need to tie totem pole

Of course the world cannot get to you if you do not mentate the world,
sweetie.  "Do not mentate the world!"  That means the world is only
fluff, others in the world only fluff, words only fluff, there is
nothing but fluff and that is serenity and the Kindom of Grace.  I am
peaceful and serene, unlike our our angry seething with hatred Jigme
(the fake DharmaTroll (the fake Tangy Hunan Chicken (the fake Tang
Huyen (the fake Human Being)))) who also posted as Lotus26, Mizar5, Son
Myung Jae and at least 50 other nyms, and was and is obsessed about
contradicting me rather than having something positive to say on his
own after his breakup/breakdown/crash in the Summer of 1999.  Jigme
after his crash became confused and lost his plot, bounced around like
mad, with his only "linking pin" being his consuming hatred of me
(though before his crash had been friends with me) and in his Mizar5
incarnation was so incoherent and zigzaggy that Jeffrey Nelson called
his style "confusionism". Probably he will remain so for the rest of
his life, or get worse, but not better. The three decades spent in
Korean Son are of no help to him and now he is pretending to be the
crashed DharmaTroll but he now only hides under Evelyn's skirt, unlike
the real DharmaTroll.  He is a "real gone cat".  Really gone.  Spaced
out forever and ever more.  But all that is made up, just words I
repeat to myself while I mentate fluff in the closed loop of mind,
hand, and penis in my Kingdom of Grace.  No need to bother, dear, just
be serene, all is made up, you are made up, nothing is real, all is
fluff.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;believe it or not, even shrinks don't do this outside of the office.  In
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;their personal lives they are honest and vulnerable and if they related to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;everyone as you do, they wouldn't have any friends.  At the very least they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;would be told to fluff off.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;soooo....Fluff Off.  ;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;tara

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a distinction. Honesty to oneself is what I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;talk about here. With that honesty to oneself as the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;basis, one can play with others. But without that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;honesty to oneself, one is gone for good, regardless
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of how one deals with others. That is the distinction.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no contradiction.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Tang &quot;Fluff Off&quot; Huyen

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No virtue in being honest to others?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;What kind of fluffing bull-fluff is that?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Robert
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;- - - - - - - -

&gt;&gt;&gt;My dear sweet and loving son, Robert, others are fluff.  You are fluff.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is ok for one to be dishonest to fluff, because fluff is just
&gt;&gt;&gt;fluff, and others are fluff, so one is only being dishonest to the
&gt;&gt;&gt;fluff of one's own mind, while one masterfully baits the fluff.  All
&gt;&gt;&gt;that matters is to be serene and honest to oneself, as others are
&gt;&gt;&gt;merely fluff.  Many of these people feel ahead of time that they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;about to crash and break up or down, and so they come to TRB to crash
&gt;&gt;&gt;and break up or down in front of the public, as if they want witnesses
&gt;&gt;&gt;to their crash and break up or down. The rage that followed the crash
&gt;&gt;&gt;and break up or down, as with Hal, Sphere, and Jigme (now posting under
&gt;&gt;&gt;the nym of DharmaTroll and still seething with hatred and vengeance
&gt;&gt;&gt;because I pointed out his crash seven years ago) could precede the
&gt;&gt;&gt;crash and break up or down, as with Lightfoot. It could also both
&gt;&gt;&gt;precede and follow it, as with the crashed and pathetic Fu.  There is
&gt;&gt;&gt;never any reason for one to be honest with these crashers, just be
&gt;&gt;&gt;serene and bait them as they are looking for help to crash, as that is
&gt;&gt;&gt;probably why they even came here.  One is actually being compassionate
&gt;&gt;&gt;by means of one's dishonesty and masterful baiting.  But all of this is
&gt;&gt;&gt;made up, it is all fluff in the closed loop of my mind.  Nothing to
&gt;&gt;&gt;worry about.  Just be serene.  All is fluff-ed off.  All is fluff.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Tangy Hunan

&gt;&gt;If the mind is a penis, and one mentally masturbates, what is the result?

&gt; Hmm.. Tough one.

&gt; Hairy palms? No, makes no sense.
&gt; Mental blindness?
&gt; Or maybe just that the mind will eventually shrink to its normal size?

I was thinking more like, spewing thoughts.  But that is a nasty image I

&gt;&gt; Of course the world cannot get to you if you do not mentate the world,
&gt;&gt; sweetie.  &quot;Do not mentate the world!&quot;  That means the world is only
&gt;&gt; fluff, others in the world only fluff, words only fluff, there is
&gt;&gt; nothing but fluff and that is serenity and the Kindom of Grace.  I am
&gt;&gt; peaceful and serene, unlike our our angry seething with hatred Jigme
&gt;&gt; (the fake DharmaTroll (the fake Tangy Hunan Chicken (the fake Tang
&gt;&gt; Huyen (the fake Human Being)))) who also posted as Lotus26, Mizar5, Son
&gt;&gt; Myung Jae and at least 50 other nyms, and was and is obsessed about
&gt;&gt; contradicting me rather than having something positive to say on his
&gt;&gt; own after his breakup/breakdown/crash in the Summer of 1999.  Jigme
&gt;&gt; after his crash became confused and lost his plot, bounced around like
&gt;&gt; mad, with his only &quot;linking pin&quot; being his consuming hatred of me
&gt;&gt; (though before his crash had been friends with me) and in his Mizar5
&gt;&gt; incarnation was so incoherent and zigzaggy that Jeffrey Nelson called
&gt;&gt; his style &quot;confusionism&quot;. Probably he will remain so for the rest of
&gt;&gt; his life, or get worse, but not better. The three decades spent in
&gt;&gt; Korean Son are of no help to him and now he is pretending to be the
&gt;&gt; crashed DharmaTroll but he now only hides under Evelyn's skirt, unlike
&gt;&gt; the real DharmaTroll.  He is a &quot;real gone cat&quot;.  Really gone.  Spaced
&gt;&gt; out forever and ever more.  But all that is made up, just words I
&gt;&gt; repeat to myself while I mentate fluff in the closed loop of mind,
&gt;&gt; hand, and penis in my Kingdom of Grace.  No need to bother, dear, just
&gt;&gt; be serene, all is made up, you are made up, nothing is real, all is
&gt;&gt; fluff.

Tang's idea that nothing is real and is all fluff is not really all that
Buddhist.  Buddha made a point of treading the line between defining
things one way or the other, because it always led to a position.  He
often said that things were "neither Real nor Unreal" as this
established a middle way where things were taken as they were, rather
than being defined in Name and Form.  To call something Unreal is to
oppose it and that has the affect of setting it up as something real to
be made unreal by regarding it as unreal, a subtle but gruesome effect
for practice.  To say that something appears, but is not substantial,
seems a good way to look at it, but one should look into what this
means, not just settle on it, as if it is already known.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pretty good.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why don't you go all the way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and imitate the Buddha?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tang's idea that nothing is real and is all fluff is not really all

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than being defined in Name and Form.  To call something Unreal is to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oppose it and that has the affect of setting it up as something real to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be made unreal by regarding it as unreal, a subtle but gruesome effect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for practice.  To say that something appears, but is not substantial,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seems a good way to look at it, but one should look into what this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means, not just settle on it, as if it is already known.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Robert
&gt;&gt;&gt; nisargadatta maharaj stated that the world
&gt;&gt;&gt; could be said to 'appear' to be but didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually exist per se.

&gt;&gt;&gt; when it is seen as merely an appearance
&gt;&gt;&gt; it loses what may have been considered
&gt;&gt;&gt; its great importance as such and that by
&gt;&gt;&gt; which one identifies with it as important
&gt;&gt;&gt; can more easily be relinquished.

&gt;&gt; If such &quot;seeing&quot; is too difficult,
&gt;&gt; it would help to give away all you got
&gt;&gt; and sit under a tree
&gt;&gt; wondering what to eat tomorrow.

&gt; i have no trouble seeing the world

Interesting to know how he makes this amazing claim.  For me, the most I
can say is that I experience what appears to my senses.  Beyond
appearances, I try to be careful about reasoning as to what may or may
not "exist per se" even if some of what appears to me and others appears
with some apparent regularity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You're seriously stuck with issues of ultimate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reality or what &quot;exists per se&quot;. Just forget about
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it and develop calm, detachment and serenity.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Once you develop calm, detachment and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; serenity, you don't care about issues of ultimate
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reality or what &quot;exists per se&quot;. It's just your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Abhidhammist proclictivity masquerading (in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reverse)

&gt;&gt;&gt; I wondered how long it would take for you to react to my criticism of
&gt;&gt;&gt; your Fu/Jigme obsession - and an overblown one at that.  But no need
&gt;&gt;&gt; to bother, dad.  It's all fluff, eh?

&gt;&gt; Not at all. &quot;It's just your Abhidhammist proclictivity
&gt;&gt; masquerading (in reverse)...&quot; as incomplete sentences that
&gt;&gt; your observations proclictivate others to write about.
&gt;&gt; Personally, I'm proclictive toward mango pie (if there
&gt;&gt; are no proclictivating 'buddhists' around, that is...).
&gt;&gt; Oh...with fluff topping, of course...

Kind of abstract.  A bit intellectual.
After all, the earth and the cosmos are
really none of our business anyway.

What about the big little things of concern
in 'normal life'?  See through disappointment
and fear. Know gain and loss for illusions.
'Real life' is a fraudulent game of no real
substance.  A mind game only.

Depending on your vision of Buddhism, it could mean a number of things.
For some, it is a claim about reality itself.  For others, it may be
no more than the idea that the dharmas (whatever they are) are empty of
our egoistic imaginings.  Take your pick anywhere on the spectrum as
long as it eases your suffering.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; its great importance as such and that by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which one identifies with it as important
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can more easily be relinquished.

&gt; &gt;&gt; If such &quot;seeing&quot; is too difficult,
&gt; &gt;&gt; it would help to give away all you got
&gt; &gt;&gt; and sit under a tree
&gt; &gt;&gt; wondering what to eat tomorrow.

&gt; Except for the wondering part...

&gt; &gt;i have no trouble seeing the world
&gt; &gt;as insignificant. this little speck of
&gt; &gt;dust called earth will pass away
&gt; &gt;and the universe won't even notice.

&gt; Kind of abstract.  A bit intellectual.
&gt; After all, the earth and the cosmos are
&gt; really none of our business anyway.

exactly why there should be
no concern

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What about the big little things of concern
&gt; in 'normal life'?  See through disappointment
&gt; and fear. Know gain and loss for illusions.
&gt; 'Real life' is a fraudulent game of no real
&gt; substance.  A mind game only.

you began this paragraph in what
appears to be a championing of
'important' things and in the same
breath downgraded the importance
to what you consider to be a mind
game only. if you waffle that rapidly,
please don't let me pull up behind
you in the take out drive thru.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Tang's idea that nothing is real and is all fluff is not really all
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddhist.  Buddha made a point of treading the line between defining
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; things one way or the other, because it always led to a position.  He
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; often said that things were &quot;neither Real nor Unreal&quot; as this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; established a middle way where things were taken as they were, rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than being defined in Name and Form.  To call something Unreal is to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; oppose it and that has the affect of setting it up as something real to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be made unreal by regarding it as unreal, a subtle but gruesome effect
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for practice.  To say that something appears, but is not substantial,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seems a good way to look at it, but one should look into what this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means, not just settle on it, as if it is already known.
&gt;&gt;&gt; nisargadatta maharaj stated that the world
&gt;&gt;&gt; could be said to 'appear' to be but didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; actually exist per se.

&gt;&gt; Interesting to know how he makes this amazing claim.  For me, the most I
&gt;&gt; can say is that I experience what appears to my senses.  Beyond
&gt;&gt; appearances, I try to be careful about reasoning as to what may or may
&gt;&gt; not &quot;exist per se&quot; even if some of what appears to me and others appears
&gt;&gt; with some apparent regularity.

&gt; i wouldn't care to speak for him as
&gt; to how he makes this claim but from
&gt; the totality of his words i would tend
&gt; to believe him.
">

I'm sure he is a nice, calm, intelligent sort of person.  Why you would
believe another's claims about what is or isn't real, though, is another
matter.  For example, if listening to him and taking what he says to be
true (and not really worrying about whether it is or not) is helpful in
whatever manner you define it, then great.  But why not just say that
instead of wrapping it up as some universal truth?
