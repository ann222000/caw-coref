Trip Report - Kota, Rajasthan

My work took me to Kota from 4th to 8th October. Was able to squeeze in two birding sessions on Sunday (whole day) and Monday(morning). Visited

Sunday (7th Oct) -

Utpuria Panited Stork Breeding Center

Left Kota at 6.00 am on the Kota-Sultanpur Road. Take a right turn at Digod and proceed for about 4 kms to reach the Painted Stork Breeding Center at Utpuria. Not unlike our own Delhi Zoo, what struck me was that the Storks were breeding right in the center of the village in a small march. There appeared to be about 150+ active nests with 2-3 milk white young in most of the nests. Other birds present there were Purple Herons, Swamphens, and other common waterbirds. Watchout for the indian softshell turtles which seems ubiquitous in every small pond basking themselves and diving into the water at the first sign of disturbance.

Sorsan Grassland Bird Sanctuary

From Utpuria went to Sultanpur and from there a pot-holed road alongside a large canal took me onto the Kota-Baran Highway where we turned towards Baran. After reaching Antah (the last stop for water and other supplies) took a right turn and headed towards Nayana Talai. Directions are easy. Saw my first harrier which turned out to be a Montague's and a little further on saw two steppe eagles on the ground near a water-hole. Saw plenty of wolly-necked storks, painted storks, a migrating flock of about 50+ Demoiselle Cranes.

At Nayana Forest Rest House, asked the guard to accompany me to Nayana Talai. The guards were extremely friendly and most eager to help with directions and also accompany me. This helpfulness is something that is unique to Rajasthan and always leaves me wishing that people from my home state of Haryana learn even a fraction of this courtesy. Nayana Talai is a small large lake with undulating grassland. Had a glimpse of a large Monitor and an Indian Krait within minutes of entering the enclosure. There were about 400+ Blackbucks which were very shy unlike the Blackbucks at Tal Chapar and ran off when we were more than 500 meters away. Left me wondering whether they were disturbed or hunted but the guard expectedly said a strong no.

The water hole itself was like an oasis in the otherwise dry stony grassland and had a lot of surprises. There were plenty of ducks - Shovellers, Common Teals, Pintals, Gadwalls, 3 Marsh Harriers, a flock of about 20 White Storks and other usual waterbirds. Was about to leave the place when to my delight saw a group of 13 Eurasian Curlews. While they could have been something else, they were too far off to give anything but a blurry picture.

From Nayana proceeded to Aini Kath which was again a small waterbody with the same assortment of Ducks. From Aini Kath went to the Sorsan checkpost which is next to a very old temple. Beside the temple there is a dense thicket of bamboo and other trees which are surrounded by a small pond. This thicket had a few surprises - 4 Paradise Flycatchers (rufous &amp; white phases), 1 common kingfisher, 1 Water Monitor, 1 Star tortoise, and 1 cinnamon bittern (is the timing right?)

There are many large, shallow lakes in the Grassland with most of them begin used for cultivation of Singara and almost all these ponds had jacanas. Mostly I had sightings of only the Bronze Winged (numerous). I had only two sightings of the Pheasant tailed that too in the center of Kota City.

Chambal National Gharial Sanctuary:

Contrary to the name, there isn't a single gharial in the sanctuary. A per the boatman, one hasn't been sighted for almost 4 years now. However there are plently of mugger in the river. The only way to make your way through the sanctuary is by boat. There is only one person who has the licenses to ply the boats on the river. The charges are Rs. 800 per hour. While I thought that this was extremely steep, curiosity got the better of me and I decieded to hire the boat for two hours from 7-9 AM. Starting the journey from Chambal Gardens, within the first 2 minutes, saw a lifer - Great Thicknee. There were almost 20-30 of these all concentrated on the banks of the Chambal opposite to the point where we got onto the boat. A little farther there were plenty of grey herons which posed beautifully for pictures. Unfortunately the waters were slightly choppy and most of my pics were all shaky. Within a few seconds saw a shikra trying to take a dive at two juvenile bronze-winged jacanas.

The chambal ravines were extremely beautiful with sheer cliffs on both sides and plenty of house swifts, a few dusky crag martins and other swallows/swifts which I could not id. There were also 4 nests of Wolly necked storks and overall we saw atleast 6 pairs of these beautiful storks during the trip. There was also a really close sighting of the Brown Fish Owl and it's nest (a shallow depression) on a sheer vertical cliff.

Soon the boatman started pointing to white marks on cliffs far away and I realised that we were beginning to come upon the roosting sites of the vultures. Sure enough the first vulture swooped just above my boat leaving me cursing myself for not having the camera ready. Soon there were plenty of these majestic beauties soaring all above us giving me ample photo ops. I counted about 70+ vultures after which I gave up. The boatman said that in an earlier survey this season Mr. Ravinder Tomar (Owner of the boat) had counted 104 active nests of these vultures.

My advice to anyone who has the opportunity to go to Kota - DO NOT MISS OUT on the boat ride. While expensive, it is well worth the trip. Mr. Ravinder Tomar also organises adventure trips in the Chambal Ravines. Unfortunately I could speak with him only after the boat ride when it was time for me to go. Contact him at 09828079769 or email him at cygnusk ... @yahoo.com ( www.adventurechambalsafari.com ). He is also an avid birder and an amateur photographer. If enough of us can visit, maybe we can ask him for a Delhibird discount on the boat ride.
