One cannot blame Amtrak for thinking out of the box to generate revenue.

&gt; &gt;Perennially cash-strapped Amtrak has found a new way to generate
&gt; &gt;revenue - by turning an entire train into a moving billboard.

&gt; Wrapping an entire train may be new, but Amtrak has been wrapping a

NJ Transit is wrapping the busses, so a train cannot be that far away.

I have to wonder how successful that will be, given that Amtrak's trains are
rarely in places where people are forced to stare at them -- unlike buses,
which are stuck in traffic surrounded by cars, or subway trains, which are
seen by a new load of passengers on the platform every few minutes.  Amtrak
trains spend the _vast_ majority of their time in the countryside or in
industrial areas with little to no visibility from the general public.

We've got a few &quot;wrapped&quot; buses here, but the top advertising dollars go for
the _back_ of the bus, where tens of thousands of drivers per day will see
each ad.  We don't have _any_ advertising on the outside of our trains;
since nearly our entire system is exclusive ROW, there's little return on
exterior advertising since the trains aren't &quot;seen&quot; much -- but plenty of
ads on the inside where passengers will see them.

I gotta admit, the advertising guys earned their pay with that idea...

Not quite true, esp on the NEC.  It is in easy eyeball shot of

Again, Amtrak is wrapping Acela train sets, which are very much seen
from Washington DC through NY all the way to Boston. No one said
anything about wrapping long distance or any other Amtrak trains for
that matter.

Why not?  It is revenue for NJT.

I remember in the 80's when NJT got the first MCI over the road
busses.  They wanted to put some ads on the busses.  The honchos at
NJT were against the visual pollution, but Gov Kean said the revenue
was more important.

True, but I remember when some of out mcts buses got ads and you couldn't
see out the windows anymore. I think they have since improved the dithering
so you can see the ad and see out better.

There are only 11 of them left, all in SE CT.  That's hardly worth wrapping
an Acela for...

Based on the article, their main goal target seems to be passengers.  I
suppose a wrap would make a bigger impression on them than other forms of
advertising, but it's still not as large a group of people as would see a
wrapped bus and the bang-for-buck factor doesn't feel great.  Still, it's
essentially free money to Amtrak, so why not?

Many European airlines (Virgin comes to mind) have been wrapping and or
doing some kind of advertising on their planes for years, and it seems
to work well for both the airline and advertiser. Yet, no one is going
to see the wrapped/advert adorned plane once it leaves the ground, but
yet the programmes continue.

Indeed, IIRC, some European RR's also have been wrapping their trains,
even HSR ones which certainly aren't going to be more than a blur as
they run through the country-side.

It was a fine trandition on American freight cars in the 1880s or so.
However, there has been a ban on interchanging such cars for many
decades.  Here locally, several freight cars that advertise local
universities are banned from interchange, but they are dedicated for local
traffic on one of our short lines anyway so it doesn't matter.

My guess is that this ban was instituted because customers didn't want to
transport their products in freight cars that advertised a competitors
product.

Is this similar to the system in the train tunnels approaching Narita?

They basically have a bunch of single-colum LED &quot;displays&quot;, with big
gaps between them, and the movement of the train itself provides the
&quot;scanning&quot; to make it appear two-dimensional (they must have sensors to
get an accurate measure of the train speed and synchronize the display
update with that).

The implementation there is a bit primitive (monochrome, kinda flickery),
but I imagine the results with a higher budget could be pretty
interesting...

That seems hardly worth it for 11 crossings.  There must be something

Adam,
The crossings on the NEC in MA were eliminated through a mix of federal
and state funding over the years if they weren't closed entirely.  For
example, the East Foxboro grade crossings of Summer St. and Cocasset St.
were eliminated by a WPA program in 1936.  Both were replaced with a road
underpass plus the extension and re-routing of several local streets.  The
Mansfield crossings downtown (Rt. 106 &amp; North St.) were eliminated by the
state with a pair of pretty large highway underpass in the mid-1950's, which
also involved paving over the Taunton Branch (and calling it Old Colony
St.), cutting the North Common in half, creation of new streets, etc.
Meanwhile, a crossing in Sharon Heights (Mohawk St.) was simply closed.
As far as the rest of the Shore Line, the ones west of New Haven were
eliminated by the New Haven RR itself when it rebuilt the line for 4-tracks
back around the turn of the 20th Century.  Others east of New Haven have
either survived or have been closed by a variety of methods.  There was
certainly no concerted effort to remove them...just the desire to be rid of
them.

Depends on what you call the NEC, I guess.  If you count the ex-New
Haven portion, there used to be many crossings on the NEC in the 20th
Century.  And IIRC, the ones in New London are still there.

&gt; &gt;&gt; http://news.bostonherald.com/business/media/view.bg?articleid=1043160

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Perennially cash-strapped Amtrak has found a new way to generate
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;revenue - by turning an entire train into a moving billboard.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Wrapping an entire train may be new, but Amtrak has been wrapping a
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pacific Surfliner car here and there for quite some time now.

&gt; &gt; I have to wonder how successful that will be, given that Amtrak's
&gt; trains are
&gt; &gt; rarely in places where people are forced to stare at them -- unlike
&gt; buses,
&gt; &gt; which are stuck in traffic surrounded by cars, or subway trains, which
&gt; are
&gt; &gt; seen by a new load of passengers on the platform every few minutes.
&gt; Amtrak
&gt; &gt; trains spend the _vast_ majority of their time in the countryside or
&gt; in
&gt; &gt; industrial areas with little to no visibility from the general public.

&gt; Again, Amtrak is wrapping Acela train sets, which are very much seen
&gt; from Washington DC through NY all the way to Boston. No one said
&gt; anything about wrapping long distance or any other Amtrak trains for
&gt; that matter.
">

I wonder how long until they start showing up on Amtrak Cascades.
That train's getting it's own ROW that appears to be elevated in part
of the puget sound area, and it runs on the I-5 median for a good
distance, and has high visibility along the ROW from Vancouver, WA to
Oregon City.

Not really. If the purpose of the grade crossing was to allow access to
a property; if the later is removed then the reason for access is as
well.

They did that here in Portland to an entire dead-end street when the
Westside MAX line was built.  There were probably about 7 houses or so
involved.  It's a shame too, because they probably could have developed a
better solution if they had worked at it.

It parallels highway 99E for a fairly long distance south of Oregon City

The problem is that there is an American Association of Railroads ban on
any piece of rolling stock showing advertising like that.  You can use it
on your own railroad, but it can not be interchanged.  Since Amtrak is
operating over other railroads here, it would be pushing the limits of

It would be interesting to go through all the AAR stuff and see what the
actual wording is.  The ban dates from the steam age, and was primarily
aimed at the billboard boxcars of the time.  Possibly the wording is so
dated as to ignore the possibility of this happening to a locomotive.
DMUs would be considered locomotives here for most practical purposes, but
at the time that restriction was added, people weren't putting billboards
on the sides of steam locomotives.

&gt; The couple of times that I have seen a Pacific Surfliner car wrapped

&gt; It appears that there are ways around this restriction.

If you never interchange the piece of rolling stock to another railroad,
then you don't have to worry about it.  They don't worry about the Acela
since it always operates within a system controlled by Amtrak, and would
never go to Beech Grove for repair like most of Amtrak's other fleet.

Done in Athens Metro too (around 2000, if I am not mistaken), but it was

Or maybe the stroboscopic effect was making some passengers sick?

It could be an interesting idea to search the actual reason.
