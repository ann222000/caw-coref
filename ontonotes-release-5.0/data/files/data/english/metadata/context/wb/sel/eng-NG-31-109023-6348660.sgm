As I posted months ago and years ago that when the dust is settled on
Iraq that Mr Bush and Cheney will probably end up in jail here in the
USA for having liared about the need to go to war in Iraq. I made that
forecast before this recent talk of a Troop surge.

I believe the Constitution has passages pertinent to the fact that we
have a President and Vice President who liared to the American people
about waging war on Iraq in 2003. That liaring is enough of a reason to
put Mr. Bush and Cheney on trial. But now we are in the absurd
situation of where a president still has time in office and where he
and Cheney are perhaps the only people who believe a troop surge is
going to do any good.

I believe our USA Constitution defends the American people from a
president who has gone amok and crazy while in office. When 99 percent
of the American people do not approve of a Troop Surge and the only one
or few that approve is the president and some military, well, that is
no longer a Democracy and that the Constitution itself is ignored.

The Constitution starts out saying " We the people...."

Mr. Bush's troop surge is "Ignore the people and the people be damned,
for I am president and I arrogantly do what I want to do...."

I, as a citizen, watching this absurdity of the Iraq War for almost 4
years now, asks of our fellow citizens that we no longer have a
president that abides by the Constitution of our country. And asks that
the Congress charge Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney as liars and acts of
treason for starting the Iraq War in 2003 and for now wanting to apply
a Troop Surge. Charge them and thus relieving them of duty as president
and vice president and that Nancy Pelosi fill out the remainder of the
2 years of Bush's term.

So charge Mr. Bush and Cheney as treasonable liars to the USA republic
and while on trial, have Nancy Pelosi fill in the last 2 years of the
Bush presidency.

If this is not done, then our country can have the situation where we
have a stark raving crazy in office of presidency where he pushes the
nuclear button and starts nuclear bombing someplace. Even though 99
percent of the citizens disapproved of his actions in office, he is so
crazy that he does them anyway.

This is a test of our Constitution that we have a president who no
longer can think clear and straight, and a Troop Surge is craziness.
And our Constitution should provide us and allow us to immediately
remove such a crazy from the office of president.

As far back as 2003 I posted here on the Internet the solution to Iraq.
I said call up strongmen of the Kurds, the Sunni and Shia such as Al
Sadr and ask them how much land they can control in a peace and how
much land they can fence for themselves. Thus dividing Iraq into
smaller countries, much like Yugoslavia was divided in the 20th
century. This plan allows our troops to come home after a mere month
and could all be home by March 2007. This is logical because no matter
what Bush does, it will end up like this anyway --- a divided Iraq into
smaller countries.

Bush and Cheney have insulted the intelligence of the American people
and the people of the world for 4 years now, and this Troop Surge idea
is a further insult to the intelligence of the world. So I for one,
proposes that Congress in the next 100 hours files a indictment on Bush
and Cheney as conspiracy against our Constitution and liaring to the
people of this republic, and have Nancy Pelosi fill in the last two
years as president.

Seems to me Mr. Bush has gone roguish. He probably went roguish when he
began his "make the case for going to war in Iraq". But the American
people would not see him roguish until the middle of 2006. And to prove
that he is a rogue and gone awry and gone amok is his Troop Surge plan.

In Parliamentary Democracies they have a fast track way of getting
rogues out of office. Here in the USA our system is deficient in
getting rid of rogues who have years to complete their office. And we
should remedy that problem. We should have the ability to boot out a
rogue president when he does not lead with a straight and clear mind
and a logical way forward.

So, mentally, Mr Bush has lost it, and it seems reasonable for me to
think that the health care doctors in the USA of all the psychology
profession as well, should declare and announce that Mr. Bush is
mentally broken down that he simply is unable to lead this country for
the remaining two years of his term, and that Mr. Cheney likewise is
unable. So that Mr Bush and Cheney should exit the office in a matter
of a week and let Nancy Pelosi fill the vacuum of the presidency. Have
Nancy sworn in by the end of next week.

If Mr. Bush and Cheney were in Britain they would have gotten rid of
them in a matter of a week and a new prime minister by next week.

The USA already has lost 3,000 lives and 30,000 wounded and lost
hundreds of billions of dollars and Iraq will divide into smaller
countries, so there is no point to losing 5,000 dead and 50,000 wounded
and more money lost for the last 2 years of the Bush White House when
Iraq is going to be divided into smaller countries no matter what we
do.

On TV last night were two vapid thinkers who said that since the USA is
the sole superpower that we can always secure a city like Baghdad in a
troop-surge. These two gentlemen lack logic, because according to their
way of thinking the USA should have won in Vietnam. We did win every
major battle in Vietnam and in Iraq, the trouble with Vietnam and Iraq
is that no political victory is possible since neither Vietnam nor Iraq
want a USA type of government.

A troop surge for Iraq is the same as Johnson increasing the troops in
Vietnam in the 1960s.

The proper and correct analogy of past history that applies to Iraq is
Yugoslavia where the USA went in as only bombing exercises and where
the political solution was the breaking apart of Yugoslavia into
smaller countries. Likewise, if the USA has only done some bombing of
Iraq and never sent any ground troops that today, the Shia and Sunni
and Kurds would be fencing in their smaller countries and they can live
in peace and happiness.

I see no reason why the American people and the rest of the World
should have to suffer 2 more years of this crazy and illogical
president Bush and Cheney.

My above two posts to Internet newsgroups over my reaction to a Troop
Surge appears in the newsgroups okay but does not appear under a author
Google search. So I am guessing that someone has a setup where they do
censoring and the method they are using is to forge my name and then
cancel the post out of a author Google search.

Can someone verify there is a censor in our midst.

Since Google performed "maintenance" on Google Groups on the 9th, tons of

i agree with waht you say....but the part missing is the fact Bush and
dickHALLIBURTONcheney as well as the old crew of Bush sr. Baker, Rumsfeld
who delovered the bio chem weapons stock to Hussein and both Gates and
Negroponte also of the big Fish in the scheming game from way back in the
80"s all began plotting this divide Iraq strategy to conquer it  . I say
they would far rather have Bush jr and his thug crew be seen as inept
incompetant and having no strategy for succes and victory in our exiting
than for all to know they have had a very effective strategy all along to
divide and conquer Iraq, mess up what they say it's about on the surfave so
to have a reason to stay on and on and on for IRAQ resource....they have
lusted after a long time....coveting the fields of other lands and taking
these over by force. They do not want to leave Iraq...having a foothold over
the oil isn't suffcient for them./..they need a mighty stronghold...massive
control....a civil war..mess and upheavel for the excuses until they have
US/Bush dynasty/dick Halliburtoncheney puupetts in place there
firmly....just like they once did in Iran waith the torturing, brutal
dictatorship of the Shah of Iran...It botjhers me so when so many keep
believing iraq was a terrorist hot spot prior to the war...and for all those
who still believe we did go in there to bring them freedom and
democracy...but now just can't really achieve such militarily...though the
latter be true  Bush didn't take us into war there for this arrogant,
pompous, noble act on his/US part but for the power, control, access to Iraq
resources. It bothers me to no end that he know claims and so many others
buy it....that its the Iraqi security force who ineptly couldn't get it
right, and now the Iraqi government who has to step up to the plate....or
otherwise Bush cannot the US cannot keep their committment to protect the
Iraqi people and help them have a democratic government. Oh the arrogance of
this vies....They Never asked us there ...they never said come and bomb
us...allow all the looting...hire everyone else for the lucrative contracts
while we remain unemployed and hungry without electricity and water....They
never said come over here and sabatoge  undermine every chance for sucess by
stirring up trouble, chaos and utter hell hole mess, place incompetant
leaders in so to keep assurance it will be unstabel. allow for disparate
placement of leaders to help ensure their will be factions and sectarian
violence, operate in such a way to undermine the Iraqi security forces and
also work in ways to keep them demoralized so you can then blame them and
the Iraqi governmetn...Thay never asked us over there to dao any of the
things that have been carried out. Clear to see in looking back over wall
history...a perfect strategyu used again nad again in deliberate plans for
invading to divide and conquer. As muc  as all proclaim Hussein to have been
a brutal dictator he was a friend and ally to the US ...fully backed and
built up by the new world order/Bush/Hlliburton dynasties....he provided a
stability to Iraq the country had not known before and all of the
Reagan/Bush  to the BushCheney administrations were warned if they messed
with Iraq..its structure they would bring on a civil war. Now thaey act
surprised and blame it on Iraq. Rev. Al Sharpton spoke the wisest words that
have about this war been said when he proclaimed: "We can't start out in the
wrong and think we will end up OK!"  There is much more explained in typing
in on the internet" History of US and Iraq Relations"  (also history of US
with Iran___... sudan, ect.) What isn't written there is the meeting Baker
held with Saddam Hussein, on behalf of Bush SR.  with Baker asking Saddam
how they could drive up the prices of oil. Saddam answered saying how Kuwait
had annexed the land to be left open as it was abuutted to close next to
Iraq oil fields and they were not moving back. Also that Kuwait had
rescinded on their promise to forgive Iraq their debt, accrued while
fighting Iran for the US..(.I wonder how much Bush had to do with Kuwait
rescinding on this promise?hmmmm!) Thus Saddam told Baker this gave him a
reason to invade Kuwait and the action would surely drive up the price of
oil Bush and Baker were wanting. With this Baker said bold and clear that if
saddam invaded Kuwait Bush ..er The US government would NOT intervene. Then
Wham!very ugly wicked stuff on the part of
Bush/Baker/Cheney/Rumsfeld/Gates/Negroponte from way back then...and now
here there are all  back again playing a part with Bush jr. actaully one of
the little middle men.  It is all true.help me get the word out. Clinton
knew all about these underhanded dirty deallings and was persuaded to help
Bush sr. cover this up...supposedly as a matter of our national security
....boy the more rope they are given the more they put a noose around the
neck of our entire nation.....we cannot escape the wicked dirty dealings and
all the destruction these greedy thieves have caused....no matter whethr a
troop surge..or not brings about an outer appearance of sucess in
Iraq...still for what has actuall underlying behind the scenes occurred and
for the actual purpose all of it has served we inevitably will face serious
consequences and have built up massively just millions of new enemies.!the
whole Bush dynasty and the entire dick cheney crew all need to be exposed
and stopped!There are so far gone believing their own twisted dastardly
ideologies that are all based on greed and sense of entitlement to have
whatever they please at any means that they are all removed entirely from
reality or any inkling of integrity and concern for humanity.

I agree that the USA politicians have lost sight of reality. Most of
those in Washington are ideologs and who should be in a church as a
preacher in Texas not the White House.

But I can condense the logic of the present situation into one short
paragraph. It is the reason we lost the war in Vietnam and the reason
we are now losing in Iraq. We have failed to learn the primary lesson
of Vietnam.

We are the superpower, and the only present day superpower. That means
we can bomb all we want and win and we can fight wars and win every
battle. But when it comes time to force an entire foreign country to
have a democracy like the USA or to have government like the USA, well,
it is almost impossible for us to accomplish that. Europe after WW2
wanted to be like the USA and that is why it was so easy for Germany
and then Japan to have a stable and peaceful country after WW2. But
Vietnam never wanted whatever the USA tried to set up as a Vietnam
country or Vietnam government. We won every battle in Vietnam and we
won the Vietnam military war, but we lost Vietnam because the war is
not military alone but politics. Only a few of the Vietnamese of both
South and North wanted the politics that the USA was forcing on
Vietnam.

Only a few of the Iraq people want the government and the country that
the USA is trying to force on them. They do not want democracy. They
want their theology as government.

So try as we may. Put in 200,000 more army and marines and after the
end of the day, the Iraqis still want a theology and not a democracy.

This is where the Bush White House lost touch with reality. Where they
never learned a stitch about the lessons of Vietnam.

We could send every USA citizen over to Iraq to police the place and we
could drain our entire wealth and put it into Iraq, and at the end of
the day, they still will not want our imposed democracy or our imposed
government. They will want their old ways of Shia of Sunni and Kurd.
They will form a theology and probably divide their country into 3
smaller countries.

So this is the stupidity of George Bush. He never learned nor
understood the lesson of Vietnam and now Iraq is a repeat of Vietnam.

Wars have at least 2 components-- military and political. And if the
country that is invaded will never accept the politics forced and
thrust upon them, then the invader will be there to the end of time and
bankrupt itself. Or else kill every one of the inhabitants.

Anyone, even a stupid person like George Bush, can understand that you
can win every battle but if the people's hearts and minds do not want
your politics, then you have lost that reconstruction. We could have
won Vietnam, only by killing every Vietnamese, because the Vietnamese
were only going to be happy with a politics that they saw fit.

History itself has a force and the force of history now is in the
direction of making large countries with problems into smaller
countries such as Yugoslavia in the 1980s and such as USSR in the
1990s. And unless the USA gets leaders who have a modicum of
intelligence and who are the best and brightest in the land, the USA
itself will split apart in the future.

As I said so often before, we need to *test* our candidates for
political office. Instead of this TV debates we need to put candidates
through a battery of college tests made public while they "take the
test" and which have questions of reaoning ability and logic
commonsense abilities and a sign that they know history. If testing had
occurred before 2000, George Bush would have never made it to the White
House and Al Gore would have been president in 2000 and the USA would
have never invaded Iraq.

If Gore had been elected in 2000, we probably now would have a M.A.D.
Fleet operational and that Iran and North Korea would be now disarmed.
We would never have entered Iraq. And our solution to dictators like
that is those drone aerial bombing surprizes. In fact our war and
military would now be mostly all *bombing* with a diminishing of
soldiers. We can rely mostly on bombing. And of course Gore would have
started the world community on a road to solve global warming.

So we need *testing* of our president candidates for we cannot afford
another 8 years of a airhead president like George Bush.

The solution is simple and easy. And if I were president that by the
end of the week I will have solved it with the majority of our troops
at home by the end of the month.

Here is the solution:
(1) I would get on the phone and call the strongman of the Kurds and
say to them, fence out a region of Iraq that you can control with your
people living in peace.
(2) I would call up a strongman or several of the Shia and Sunni and
say to them, fence up a region of Iraq which you can control and have
stability and peace. I would call on Al Sadr to carve out his country
in Iraq.
(3) As the fences are going up I would send all troops home except for
those soldiers who would aerial watch over Iraq that no neighbor such
as Iran or Syria attacks Iraq while the fences go up. And aerial
watching for sometime until those new countries are in the UN.

The thing that Bush does not understand is that no matter what he does,
Iraq is going to end up as a divided smaller countries. So his correct
response to the present situation is not a troop-surge but a blitz
phone calling of people like Al Sadr and other strongmen to fence in
their own new smaller country.

Our troops won every battle, but Iraq is not a war now, it is all about
politics. And no increase in soldiers is going to change the politics.
The Iraqis do not want democracy, they want to be Shias and Sunnis and
Kurds.

There is nothing new about this proposal. Biden has suggested numerous
times, probably after he heard me talk about it. These people murdered
too many of each others' children to just kiss and make up and
separating them into parts seems the only way to end the violence. It
would probably have been done a long time ago if not for Turkey's
opposition to an independent Kurd entity. The US just has to tell the
Turks to mind their own business since they have been the most
unreliable and expensive ally (if you want to call Turkey an ally) the
US had in a long time.

Your notion that Bush and Cheney would end up in jail is about as crazy
as I have seen in some time. It would enormously disrupt and damage the
country and that is the reason why Ford pardoned Nixon. Culpability has
nothing to do with my position as I also believe that they did lie to
the American public but that is what most (if not all) politicians do.
You just do not put the President in jail for lying about politics and
for making bad decisions. That is what the ballot box is for.

I put out this plan in summer 2003 and posts to the Internet proves
this.
When was yours and Biden's?

But that aside.

The complaints I hear for the "partition plan" is that Iraq will be
invaded by
its neighbors and the USA would have to come back in. Well that is
nonsense
because what I propose is an altogether new view of the USA foreign
military
posture. That we rely almost 100% on bombing and aerial surveillance
and drone
bombing of select targets. So whereas we bring say 100% of the troops
home
that we still have complete military control of Iraq with the USA daily
flybys.

So the excuse that the White House gives that if we bring all our
troops home
that we will have to enter back is nonsense because our air-force and
offshore
ships will still control Iraq.

Consider how totally easy it would have been to subordinate Saddam
Hussein prior
to 2003 by aerial drones or flybys such as we are doing right now with
Mogadeshu.
Where to get SH takes only one aerial drone and not cost the lives of
3,000 USA.

Bush has the notorious distinction in world history for paying the
highest price for
the life of one man -- SH--. The Ancient Romans are laughing, because
when they
wanted to rid a despot they did it at a price of almost for "free"
compared to Bush.

I think a know a little about the American people and that they are not
going
to let Bush and Cheney get away with having spent 3,000 lives, 20,000
wounded
and 1 trillion dollars thrown away without some accountability. I think
I know
Americans somewhat and they will want someone held accountable for a
waged
war that the USA lost. Americans are not happy or comfortable of having
been
duped into going to war, spent all that cost and end up losing the war.

Nay, if I have any sense of Americans, they will hold someone to
account for
that. So I think that by 2010, both Bush and Cheyney will be spending
some
jailtime. Of course their defense is that they are and were stupid
leaders
and the blame is on the American people for having elected them into
office. So they will call the American people as stupid and the
American
people will call them as stupid leaders. But someone has to be blamed
for starting a war and losing it.

Now I wonder if the Democrats in their so called first 100 hours can do
some
bill like a California Referendum bill. One similar that got Gray Davis
out of
office and put A. Schwarzenneger into office. A Federal Referendum
where
the US populace can get rid of a president that has gone rogue. Why
waste
the next 2 years of the president when that time is valuable such as
NorthKorea or Iran flair ups.

Bush is having a meltdown of his presidency, so that if we had a
Referendum Law
so that in the month of February we can hold an election that gets rid
of Bush
and Cheyney and votes a new president to finish the last 2 years.

We need some process to get rid of a president that does not serve the
people and
it is a shame to waste the time of his office when he turns roguish.

I could not remember the proper word for that California event when
Governor
Gray Davis was put to vote and Schwarzenneger was elected.

So why not have say Barbara Boxer introduce a bill into the House that
gives the American people a chance to vote out of office any president
that goes awry or becomes rogueish. So that the public does not have
to put up with a president that no longer serves the people.

I use to remember when Kennedy was in office how he often started a
speech with "Your government....." With Bush in office, his behaviour
is
"My government, and my government is going to troop surge..."

So in this modern day of computers, let that also be in the bill that
the
recall election can be done over computers.

Say something like 10,000,000 of the voters if they email to a website
with a ballot cast would initiate a Recall Election. And have a judge
oversee the election. Have the election speedy for time is of the
essence. Make it so that in a Federal Recall Election from start
to finish that it take no more than 2 months.

In Parliamentary democracies they seem to have a "vote of no
confidence"
which initiates a getting rid of a rogue leader. So we need something
so
that people do not have to wait years to remove bad leaders.

No, California is better off with its Recall possibility. So the entire
nation
would be better off if it also had a Recall capability, with time is of
the
essence, and when a president is in such a mess, that he do even
more crazy actions and behaviour. He could nuke Iran or NorthKorea
in the middle of the night and say "what the heck, I am still in
office"

What if a future president comes down with Alzheimers in the first
year of his office, unlike Reagan who had it after office. Or some
other
medical incapacitation. Where the country needs a president, not a
sick person. Such a Recall Mechanism in place would be very
valuable.

Anyway, our modern society is fast fast fast and go go go, something
that
the Founding Fathers did not anticipate for our Constitution and which
our
Constitution now needs that extra dimension of speed.

We need to be able to hold the president tightly bound to the people
during
every minute of his/her term in office. At the moment, Bush is a loose
cannon
who brought us into this Iraq mess and can do even larger damage to the
USA.
His Troop Surge is no solution and is the reaction of a crazy mind.
When his
generals tell him a troop surge will not work, he fires them and finds
a general
that agrees with him. Bush and Cheney did the same thing with the CIA
in
finding an excuse to wage war on Iraq.

If a Recall Election makes California a better place, why not a Recall
election
to make all of the USA a better place.

Set up a Website titled "RECALL election to boot out Bush and Cheney by
February
2007. If that site musters 10,000,000 voters who agree, then in March
have a National
Recall Election so that by April the USA has a new presidental team in
the White
House.

In the meantime have the House and Senate pass a Amendment to the
Constitution
allowing for National Recall Elections when warranted.

That is too long and too cumbersome and that is why we need a speedy

You should think about your logic above, for you are saying that the
Constitution is more important than the people it is designed to serve.
I do not think you want to say that but that is what your arguement
says.
You are saying that no matter how much and how long the people suffer
from a crumby president and vice-president, just suck it up and wait
years
for the next election.

One of the words of the Constitution is " in order to form a more
perfect union"
which means that the Constitution itself is blemished and must be fixed
as we
go along into the future. And one of its big flaws and blemishs is that
we cannot
get rid of a rogue and his bunch when they need to be kicked out as
fast as
possible.

That is exactly what I am saying! It is better to suffer some
discomforts than to risk turning our nation of laws into anarchy. The
Founding Fathers declared independence only after they came to the
conclusion that King George wouldn't ever give in to any of their
demands. There was no other way but all we have to do is wait two more
years until the next presidential election. The US is not a democracy
but a republic and most Americans like it this way because it gives
them a sense of continuity and stability. There is a perfectly legal
and constitutional process for removing a president from office but it
is not easy and it should not be easy. The Senate must convict by 2/3
majority and the republicans could not get it to convict Clinton, as it
should be but a better man would have resigned instead of putting the
Nation through impeachment. The much condemned and deviled Nixon did
not want the Nation to go through the disruptive process of impeachment
(not the same as conviction) and resigned. He also chose to let Kennedy
become president rather than challenge the results in spite of well
known ballot stuffing by Johnson's people. Bush is not my favorite
president but I can put up with him for two more years especially since
his powers are much curtailed by a democratic majority in Congress.
There is no need for drastic actions.

A Recall Election is all within the law. It would be part of the Laws
of the
Land. Just as the California Recall Election of Schwarzenegger was all
within the Law. You must think that the California Recall of Gray Davis
was a form of anarchy.

I find that most people who are in politics or engage in politics are
very
often very much lacking in logic. And those entering politics should be
tested for their ability to logically think clear and think straight.

In the past 8 years, much of the time was spent on education in the USA
with its "no child left behind", but we have "left behind politicians
for the past
100 years" What I mean by that is we have most presidents who would
probably never pass a test on Logical thinking. That many of the
presidents
in the history of the USA were poor on reasoning, poor on thinking
clearly
and thinking straight.

One of the largest complaints I have of the Bush years in the White
House
is that the man does not know "priorities". Before the Iraq Invasion of
2003
I made many posts to the Internet saying that Bush needed to build a
MAD Fleet before ever invading Iraq. That Bush needed to progress on a
Israel Palestine solution before ever invading Iraq. At that time the
issue of
North Korea and Iran going nuclear was not in the spotlight but
obviously
NorthKorea and Iran were more important than chasing after SH in Iraq.

So our system of government is very weak on getting qualified people to

lead this country. And the way to solve that is to give them a battery
of
tests in the campaigns. If they fail the testing, then they cannot
proceed.
Bush would have failed if testing had been applied in 2000 and Gore
would have been president.

So Testing is one new law that should be added to the Constitution
because the Founding Fathers thought that the defunct Electoral College
was going to provide the insurance that the leaders would be qualified
when in fact the Electoral College never worked.

And another new law besides Testing is to make this Recall Law, so that
when we get a "dud" in office we can get rid of him/her instead of
having to
sit it out and wait years for the next scheduled election.

The person arguing against me has a narrow minded view of what a
Constitution
is all about, as if it is permanent fix. It is not static and fixed but
in a dynamic
motion of change to better serve the people. And the people need better

leadership of qualified and clear thinking leaders and if they become
rogue or
gone awry in office the people should have a easier way of replacing.

And it is not as if Recall Elections are so totally new for California
showed us
one recently that worked very well. And the Federal Constitution would
be
even better if it included (1) testing of candidates for office and (2)
Recall
possiblity. It is when our Constitution becomes static and never
changing
and cumbersome to work with or too time consuming that we are in danger
of social violence and anarchy.

The Recall Election of Gray Davis in favor of Arnold Schwarzennegger
was not as pressing and demanding as what
a Recall of the president is demanding and urgent. California booted
out its governor in a Recall Election. But
it is more urgent to boot out George Bush before he finishes his term.
Why do I say this?

Because George Bush invaded Iraq to the detriment of the whole world,
especially to the USA, and rather than
divide Iraq into 3 smaller countries of Kurd, Shia, Sunni and leave and
depart Iraq, in that Bush will widen the
war by attacking Iran on some other pretense just as he invaded Iraq
under the pretenses of Al Queda living
there and weapons of mass destruction existing in Iraq.

The man is a war-monger. And the man can never turn any way except more
warring.

So if left with the rest of his term in office, what Bush will concoct
is a excuse to war against Iran and Syria
and when he does leave office in January of 2009, the USA will be in 3
theaters of War-- Afghanistan, Iraq,
and Iran.

You cannot change the spots on a leopard, the man is a war monger. Just
read what George Bush said about
Vietnam when that conflict was raging. He thought it was winnable and
would have sent more troops to
Vietnam in the 1970s.

So this country needs for Congress to draft a Recall Election Bill. And
for the American People to get rid of this
rogue and gone awry president as fast as possible. If the American
people do not do this, then the rogue will
have us embroiled in a 3 theater war by January of 2009.

Why would Bush love a 3 theater war? Simple. Because it absolves him of
the huge mistake of Iraq. His Troop
Surge in Iraq is a prelude of him attacking and invading Iran.

Bush's "change of course" in Iraq is that of an attack on Iran with the
Troop Surge a prelude.

Malecki is unable to ever bring security to Baghdad and his plan is not
security but that the Shia win in
a Civil War. So the Troop Surge is a failure from the git go, a failure
at the starting block.

No matter what Bush does in Iraq, it will end up as 3 smaller countries
and that is what Bush should be doing now
is to call up strongmen of Kurd, Sunni and Shia to erect fences for
their new country. Al Sadr is a friend of the USA
because he can provide security to a smaller Shia country inside
Baghdad.

But Bush can never recognize that Iraq needs its own smaller countries
and not some pipe-dream of a democracy.

So, unless Bush is booted out of office, we, as Americans face the huge
risk that this dumb president will widen
the war and that by 2009 we are embroiled in a 3 theater wars in the
Middle East.

So have Congress pass a Recall Election Bill, and start the REcall
Election by February 2007 and by March of 2007
have the election and a new president team to fill out these last two
years.

&gt;&gt; My above two posts to Internet newsgroups over my reaction to a Troop
&gt;&gt; Surge appears in the newsgroups okay but does not appear under a author
&gt;&gt; Google search. So I am guessing that someone has a setup where they do
&gt;&gt; censoring and the method they are using is to forge my name and then
&gt;&gt; cancel the post out of a author Google search.

&gt;Since Google performed &quot;maintenance&quot; on Google Groups on the 9th, tons of
&gt;recent GG postings don't show up via search.

buzz ! How is he going to think he's IMPORTANT now, important
enough for the Vast Konspiracy to notice and censor ???
