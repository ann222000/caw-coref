Diabetes blood glucose readers?

Bayer on TV is giving away free readers so I called and ordered one.

They're sending me the Contour reader (strips only, no disk) 5-second reader.

Any comments, better readers available?

Thanks

Cost of the strips and whether or not your insurance (if you have it) cover
the strips, etc. are often the most important factors. But, otherwise there
are pluses and minuses &amp; personal preferences. I use the Freestyle Flash &amp;
one of the things I like most about it is that I can test at alternate
sites. For me this means that I test on certain areas of my lower outer
thighs instead of fingers. Another thing I like about it is its software &amp;
connection to my computer. My insurance company wants me to change to either
of two others, which is as annoying as all get out.

I don't like the Contour but perhaps that is because I have gotten used to
the Ascencia.  Yes, the Counter is quick but what I didn't like about it is
the strips come on a canister.  I find it hard to get just one strip out and
I'm always afraid I will dump them all out on the floor or something.  The
Ascencia comes with individually wrapped strips.  I find it easier to tuck a
few strips in with my meter rather than having to carry the whole canister.
But I guess we're all different.  The Counter is a lot quicker than the
Ascencia.

They all seem to be about the same. FDA requires accuracy of +-20% and the
information you can get out of manufacturers indicate theirs are all about
+-15%. They make money on the strips, so are quite happy to give the
meters away.

I got a free Contour awhile ago and they actually included some test strips
with it.  They rarely do that anymore!  I did like it and found the results
were nearly identical to my Lifescan One Touch UltraSmart meter.  My Contour
took 15 seconds to get the results but I know they've cut that down to 5
seconds.  I found the strips needed a tiny sample and sucked up the blood
well.  I like my UltraSmart for all of the data capabilities, so I don't
plan on switching.  If I had to, the Contour would definitely be at the top
of the list.

Don't think so, neither from my own experience, nor from a review done
in April by a German institute, 'Stiftung Warentest', which more or
less confirmed my own findings. I'd see me at a loss with a meter
accuracy that exhausts the FDA target of +/- 20% or even only +/- 15%
and attach great importance to basing decisions on a testing device
much more accurate.

The results of finger and earlobe blood was compared with the numbers
coming from a Beckmann laboratory analyzer (hexokinase method). The
score represents school notes, the lower the better. In parantheses
the overall results, 50% of which are represented by the accuracy.

0,9 (2,4) MWD Pen Sensor
1,1 (1,4) Ascensia Contour
1,1 (1,6) Gluco Smart +
1,2 (1,5) OneTouch Ultra 2
1,6 (1,8) AccuChek Compact Plus
1,8 (2,0) Bionime Rightest GM 300
1,9 (2,1) Gluco Talk
1,9 (2,1) Wellington Smart System
2,1 (1,9) Omnitest plus
2,4 (2,4) FreeStyle Freedom
2,4 (2,3) GlucoMen Visio
3,0 (2,9) Major II
3,5 (3,0) Terumo FineTouch

IMHO it's important to base one's decision on accuracy in order to
make the industry move in this direction.

Where do you get that from Ray? I see it quoted often here.
Maybe it varies internationally.

The insert in my Accu-chek &quot;Go&quot; strips says 4% in hospital
use, with 2% repeatability subject to various
qualifications. That's tighter than the numbers quoted by US
posters. Of course, those are lab numbers but I doubt it
changes by a factor of 3 or 4 in domestic use.

I've found that to be reasonably true for repeatability with
my own meters, although there is a 0.4 mmol/L(7mg/dl) steady
difference between my old Accu-chek Active and my newer Go
which reads higher.

What does the insert on your own strips say?

ISO Standard 15197 allows for a +/- 20 mg/dl variation for glucose
values under 100 mg/dl and +/- 20% for higher glucose values between
blood glucose meter readings and a laboratory value. That's what the
FDA refers to.

My Accucheck strips say the same thing, and it's clear that with the
exception of the odd improperly cleaned finger my repeatability with
my Accucheck is less than 5%. I suspect that what Ray means is that a
deduction from the test solution advice suggests that the
manufacturers won't accept blame for results that are under 15%. IIRC
most of the folk who have done careful assessments of their own
testing here have reported figures well under 10%.

IMO, you get a feel for what results are really significant.  Every so
often, someone reminds me that a particular result isn't really
different from another because of the 15% thing, when my experience
shows my meter is more precise than that - there *is* a difference
between an 85 and a 100 reading even on my cheapest meter.

That's apparently what is allowed in the USA, not what is
actual in the meters. A CYA limit. It is only 20% at the
100mg/dl (worse below that, better above) although that
certainly wouldn't be acceptable to me.

I suggest that it may be wiser to read the information that
comes with your meter and strips. That may lead to a
pleasant surprise.

Hi Andy.

I just received this old joke in the emails today. I think
you can relate to it:

I just read an article on the dangers of  drinking....

Scared the shit out of me.

So that's it!

After today, no more  reading.

Which scares you most - doing the test or knowing the
results?

If it's the doing, read this:
http://loraldiabetes.blogspot.com/2006/10/painless-pricks.html

If it's the knowing, I can't help a lot. Except to say that
not knowing, for me, is much more frightening.

While you think about it, re-read these:

&gt;Alan,

&gt;It's not the numbers so much. I think it's my fear of bleeding. That and
&gt;the shift of gout and diabetes diet. Like walking a tight rope if I didn't
&gt;mention it.

Go on mate - take a stab at it...:-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi Andy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I just received this old joke in the emails today. I think
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can relate to it:

&gt;&gt;&gt;     I just read an article on the dangers of  drinking....

&gt;&gt;&gt;     Scared the shit out of me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;     So that's it!

&gt;&gt;&gt;     After today, no more  reading.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which scares you most - doing the test or knowing the
&gt;&gt;&gt; results?

&gt;&gt;Alan, T2, Australia.

Andy,
I too, am fairly recently diagnosed. I felt that it would be
terrible to have to prick my finger once or twice per day. As it
turned out, the technology is such that it is not at all painful, and
the drop of blood needed is quite small. All in all, it is far less
terrible than I imagined, and as a result, I have no qualms about
testing far more than my doctor called for, in order to find out my
personal tolerances to various foods.

If you can believe me about the ease of using the meter, all that's
left is your fear of bleeding, and that, I can't help you with. Such
fears are not something you can just dismiss easily, but I would urge
you to just go ahead and try. I think that in your case, balancing
your diet between diabetes and gout, will require good testing, and if
you can overcome your fears, you will be far better for it.

Trust me - testing is nicer than being bitten : )

You're not going to believe it until you try - but you'll think it's
completely trivial in a short while. I do remember my first time,
though :{}
