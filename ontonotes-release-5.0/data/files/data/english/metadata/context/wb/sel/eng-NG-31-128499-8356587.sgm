How to forward to whole contact list

Hi,

Two issues are getting me MAD! Please someone kindly advise...

One: if there's a thing that bothers me is I cannot forward a message
to all my contact list, without picking one by one. Does anyone know
hot to do this? (I've looked everywhere and could not find the answer,
so maybe I am the stupid one in this case).

The other is,  not all cantacts appear when you type initials of their
names, following perhaps the same criteria of Google indexing but
which, if applied to Gmail, generates the dumbest of criteria -
showing only those more oftenly used - to show what Gmail thinks,
instead of you. That´s really a bug and I do not know where - if there
is one - to turn this stupidity off.

Don't take me badly, if not for these two silly &quot;details&quot;, I would be
totally happy with Gmail.

Help Me, if you please!!!

For emailing all your contacts, go to All Contacts, scroll to the
bottom, hit the All button so that all are ticked, then hit the
compose button...  then you'll have to copy-paste the email contents
you wanted to forward into this new blank email...

I normally then move all the To: recipients to the BCC: field for
privacy and anti-spam reasons.

As far as the filtering of typed addresses goes, is it that it is
limitting how many are showed, but then shows you the ones you want as
you refine the seach by typing more and more letters of the name?
I've notice this with mine i think when i email anyone called steve...
i hava a lots of Steves in my contacts.

Howdy, Rich,
thanks, really, for trying. But you did not, unfortunately, get my
point which is &quot;forwarding&quot; a received msg.
I know how to compose to all, but think GMail SUCKS when you want to
forward.
Try doing that with an important notice you want to send to all of
your contacts, and then report me the amount of work you had!

Creating a fake new one to get all the addys and then cutting/pasting,
reviewing and picking and all that?  Couldn't there be a BUTTON to do
that for us? It's not a mighty task!!!

I have around 350 people in my list, so... adding them one by one, as
allowed, simply sucks. Mainly if they are never shown totally (only
the ones most mailed, by their criteria!!!

That's why I nicked myself BADFEATURES to post this one.

Does any of the post-grad geniuses from GMail/Google ever reads these
lines? Would love to hear from them also!!!

Anyway thanks for trying and help.
Hope!
