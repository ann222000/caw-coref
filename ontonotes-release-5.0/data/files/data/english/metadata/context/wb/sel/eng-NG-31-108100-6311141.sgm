Wow! I can't picture my cats biting anyone. Of course, they usually
disappear when anyone comes over but, even so...  The guy obviously provoked
the poor, innocent, little kitty and ought to be countersued for kitty's
mental distress.

As a card-carrying BEMOAF, I know from experience they don't need to
be tormented to lash out indiscriminately. A cairn terrier (Archie) in
my neighborhood tried to play with one and got a slash across his nose
for his pains. That got infected as well and he ended up at the Vets.
Poor little guy just wanted to play...

They probably deliberately put poison on their claws when they're out
to get you... either that or they're just toxic in the first place.

One of my cats once bit me, in the hand. He plunged his teeth in so
far all you could see above my skin was the tiny little front teeth.

He was a sweet cat and he adored me.

The thing is, I had just been vacuuming. I stopped the vacuum and
picked him up because he was upset.

Then I'm not sure if I went to also pick up the vacuum to put it away
or if I kicked it out of the way... either way he freaked and plunged
those teeth into my hand.

What happens is, the bite site seals over and the wound festers. I
wound up in the hospital )c:

That's why when cats fight, you almost always need to put them on
amoxi because the wound is going to abscess.

Dang! The things one learns around here. But I still can't picture our cats

Adding a negative doesn't increase the total. Hunter admits that she her

&gt;&gt;&gt;hamster?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Kitty has, and up with that she will not put.

&gt;&gt;Oh, geez... I think I ran afoul of the cat lobby. It's like the RORT
&gt;&gt;conservative lobby or the RORT gun nut lobby but worse.

&gt;&gt;I kinda thought to myself that I'd better keep an eye on Giddings
&gt;&gt;after he sent that poor dog to the pound - he's obviously a closet cat
&gt;&gt;person. At least Kevin is open about it...

&gt;&gt;Let's rally around 'dog' people!

&gt;&gt;David &quot;The Hamster&quot; Malone

&gt; I'll throw a monkey wrench into this. I don't like dogs. Or cats. Or
&gt; hamsters. Or even gecko's. And I have one of those. Damn thing won't
&gt; die, he's already seven years old!
&gt; I dislike all pets, simply because of the care they require.

My math is not that good but I don't think you can divide and subtract
in the same operation.

Besides she declined to join so there's still the two of us... plus

In chaos theory I think she's known as a "strange attractor". Not easily

yahbut... using various avians as the 'load' in such devices was _very_
common.  It seems that they were aerodynamically unstable, and would
exhibit severe oscillation about the pitch axis.   The beak, claws, and
other pointy bits all contributed to 'slashing' damages on impact.

From _this_ comes the classic term "flipping 'em the bird".

It has been reported previously, that people encountering this bit
historical arcania  have  been known to spontaneously emit a great awk
of dismay.  Thus proving that -- contrary to popular belief -- _THOEE*
are not extinct, either.
