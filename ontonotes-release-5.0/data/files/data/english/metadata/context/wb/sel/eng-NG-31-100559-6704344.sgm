We just had the 30K service on our '05 XC90, but the dealer apparently
failed to disengage the service light which has just now kicked in.

The dealer is 60 miles away, so if anyone can tell me how to disengage the
service light (it's a computer message as well as an amber light on the
dash),  we can save ourselves the run, and that would be appreciated.

Thanx.

Unfortunately, as countless others before you have also discovered,
the service light can only be reset by the dealer with a special OBDII
controller -- the good news is that it's just an annoying little
reminder light and it doesn't mean much of anything (at this point,
since you have already had the service), but the bad news is that
you're going to have to make that trip again.

What I was afraid was the answer....  I guess we'll be off and running next
opportunity.  That light is a pain even tho it's only only for a couple of
minutes --- but when it is, it blocks out any other information.  So, we'll
git er done at some point.

Thanx

Step 1:) Press the trip reset button in & hold it
Step 2:) Turn the key on to position 2 wait until the yellow triangle
flashes turn key off & then start car service reminder message will be off

Glenn, when you refer to the trip reset button, is that one of the odometer
trip counters (there are two on this car), or the reset button on the stick
that controls the computer read-outs?
