So this dude in London just got arrested for using someone else's
unsecured wi-fi connection.

http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,136326-c,wireless/article.html

Apparently that's against the law (or the law can be construed such) in
the UK. Article doesn't say what the possible sentence is.

Is this illegal in the US as well?

What's the consensus (by which I mean the diverse and unresolvable
range of conflicted opinion) in AFCA about the ethics of the situation?

Seems to me a lot depends on the specifics. I've heard this situation
likened to someone reading your newspaper over your shoulder while
travelling on public transport - annoying but no biggie.
I don't have a wi-fi connection myself but I understand there are different
packages for the broadband connection that usually goes with it. If I was
paying a set charge for an unlimited service I wouldn't care if someone
going past my house piggy-backed it, unless that would in some way restrict
*my* access if I wanted to be on at the same time. But if I was on a capped
connection (eg limit 50Gb per month or whatever) then I'd care very much if
someone took a big bite out of that by downloading the first series of
&quot;Heroes&quot; and leaving me with barely enough capacity to read Opus.
But the general response over here seems to be that you can easily protect
your connection from this kind of intrusion so you shouldn't cry if you
haven't and someone takes advantage - bit like leaving your front door wide
open while you go to the shops.

That's my view of it -- what would you expect if you don't encrypt
the router -- and also that piggybacking on a wireless connection is
usually a victimless crime.  (Usually, although -- as you pointed out
-- it might not be victimless if the connection is limited or if the
piggy-backer downloads something illegal that way.)

But it's also worth pointing out that if you *do* leave your door
wide open while you go to the shops, that doesn't invariabllyy give
someone a legal right to go in an pinch some of your stuff.  (It
might make it predictable and inevitable, but that doesn't
necessarily make it legal.)

If by &quot;illegal in the US&quot; you mean is it a federal crime, the answer is
maybe. It's been argued that it's a violation of the federal computer
crime statute although I don't recall hearing anyone prosecuted under
that. I suspect if they were it was in relation to another crime and
they were piling on charges.

If you mean is it a violation of any state laws the answer is yes,
although I don't know of any comprehensive list of state computer laws
which you can easily browse like those &quot;age of legal consent in all 50
states&quot; charts. There certainly have been prosecutions of people solely
for piggybacking wifi in the US. In the cases I've heard of the people
have received traffic ticket level fines. A fast google showed me
convictions in MI and IL for starters.

I know at one point a New York legislator was trying to make it illegal
to set up an unsecured wifi access point which would have made the
piggybackee a criminal as well. I'm not sure if that actually made it
into law though. Once again, Google is my friend. Here's a link to the
actual announcement...

According to the article, he was sitting on wall using his computer
and the policemen started questioning him and he admitted using the
unsecured connection. Do the police interrogate everybody using a

Sure, I understand that attitude. Of course that still doesn't make it
right for someone to enter your house and watch TV while you're away.
But that's seems several levels of creepy beyond borrowing a connection

I don't think I've seen a single broadband provider acceptable use
policy that specifically mentions this. Of course, if you do that, and
it gets abused in some way that DOES violate your provider's policy,
it's your name on the user agreement and you would be in violation, but
that's your problem to deal with. It's not generally against the law or
a violation of any contract to leave your keys in your car and the
engine running either, it's just not all that bright.

Hmmm, most specifically say services are provided for your own
personal use. My old ISP had this clause in it's TOS, which seems to
indicate to me that you weren't allowed to leave an open connection
for anyone else. I'd be surprised if this style of clause wasn't
common for most ISPs, otherwise many people would be selling wireless
internet to their neighbours to defray the cost.

Uh oh. I guess I should mention that I'm asking this in part because
apparently I committed a criminal act the other day. Do you think
they'll go easier on me if I turn myself in?

I'm also curious about the flip side (but not with any intent to
further my life of crime). What if I set up an unsecured wireless
network on purpose? And then someone starts using it. How would I even
know? And how easy would it be to capture every keystroke they make and
read their email and get their credit card numbers and have my way with
their women?

You could know by using the interface to your wireless router and looking
at the connections, or DHCP clients, or MAC connections. Capturing the
packets that flow through your router shouldn't be all that difficult, but
I've never tried to do something like that. Getting their credit card info
SHOULD be difficult, as any reputable e-commerce website should be using
SSL encryption. Their women want nothing to do with you.

There was a thread here a year or so ago.  Someone connected a Linux
machine as a gateway between his wireless access point and played with
the mind of anyone who logged in to his unsecured port other than the
one laptop that he hardcoded into the gateway routines.

Anyone else would get the web page text piped through babelfish or all

such.

The motel where I stayed on my Christmas trip last year gave me an ID
code card to some company called bigpipe or fatport or some such.
This was supposed to give me 24 hours access.  But when I turned on
the laptop, I couldn't find the bigpipe signal.  The first three
signals I clicked onto were all fully unlocked.

Another time I had left my car in Vancouver and took the bus to my
friend's town on Vancouver Island.  After she dropped me at the
Greyhound station (or PCL, I can never keep them straight), I climbed
onto the bus and started playing a game.  I was massively startled
when she IM'ed me after she got back to her apartment.  I had
forgotten to turn off the radio to save battery, and someone next to
the greyhound station had an open port.

Non-technical way: watch the little blinky lights on the router. If you

If they're doing stuff over an unencrypted protocol, trivially easy.
For example, somebody with a wireshark pointed at me right now could see
the webpages I'm looking at as they come to me. If they're using weak
auth, you can set up a proxy that does man-in-the-middle attacks, i.e:
when they go to talk to their bank, you pretend to be their bank, and
then you go talk to their bank, and pretend to be them. If they're using
strong crypto, it's varying degrees of 'effectively impossible'.

Right, the user login and billing type stuff are all over SSL

So I think that this would probably be OK with a bill designed
to &quot;protect&quot; users on open networks, though again, having not
looked at any specifics of the actual legislation you can't tell

Bills of this nature are more likely to hurt the small, independent

wifi router at the end of a DSL line or something.

A smart wireless router wouldn't allow such actions from a wireless
connection, insisting on wired.  Then again, a smart router wouldn't
default to &quot;ravish me&quot; mode.  (Just because they haven't put any
security on the signal doesn't mean they haven't got a password on the
admin account.  Certainly increases the odds though.)  Try &quot;password&quot;
as the password if there is one.

If they aren't using any sort of encryption it's pretty easy. There are
plenty of programs that let you view the contents of all packets that go
through your router.

However if they're doing something like I usually do when I need to use
a wifi connection (at a hotel or conference or something) and tunnel an
encrypted VPN connection through the wifi then you can capture the
encrypted packets but you won't be able to read them.

By process of elimination someone has the least secure wifi network and
I bet if you found it you could have your way with their computers.

Some routers allow remote administration but I've never seen one that
had it on by default. If someone was stupid enough to turn that on while
at the same time not setting an administrators password for said router
then yeah, you could &quot;take over&quot; their connection and set a password.

If you are connecting to their wifi access point and it's configured in
a common manner you have &quot;access&quot; to other computers on their LAN.
You'll have to guess their internal IP addresses but there are some
pretty common ones to try. If they then had remote desktop connections
or ssh connections or whatever enabled for one of their machines and it
wasn't password protected you could log in to their machines and do what
you will.

Which is why if you're going to set up an unsecured access point you
should really know what you're doing to secure the rest of your network.
I need access to my machines from remote locations but I have it set up
so you can only ssh in to the machines if you are first using an
encrypted vpn using preshared keys to connect to the router and then
once inside you can only ssh in to machines where you've preshared a
public/private key (i.e. no password based logins allowed). Many times a
day I log someone trying to ssh in by blasting thousands of common
name/password pairs at my network. Even with the security I have if a
competent hacker really wanted access to my machines I assume he could
get them.

There was a pretty notorious incident earlier this year which
illustrates the danger. Hackers broke into kiosks which accepted
employment applications at TJX and from there were able to access the
corporate network including credit card records. The corporate firewalls
weren't protecting against internal access and the kiosks were
considered internal.

Why me in particular?

It had occurred to me, actually - there's a guy next door with a PC
who really wants an internet connection, but has no phone line.  The
reason he doesn't have a line is that he owes the phone company
several hundred pounds.  Hmm, not a practical business model,
methinks.

Besides, I don't have a wireless router here.  And if I did, I
certainly wouldn't want anyone using my ISP account, especially
considering it's got a capped download limit.

Slightly off-topic, I've had a lot of headaches trying to get
Marianne's wifi LAN sorted out.  She's got a new PC in the loft, and
the router's downstairs (ie three storeys inclusive); other PCs on the
ground (US: first) and first (US: second) storeys can access the
router fine.

Before I moved out, the router was in the loft (on a second phone line
that's now been disconnected), and all PCs in the house could see it
just fine, but now the one in the loft has problems, even though it's
the same distance, etc, just in the reverse direction.  Jeez, this
takes some explaining.

Anyhoo, the situation is that the wireless card drivers on her PC in
the loft give an indication of an &quot;excellent&quot; signal, somewhere in the
region of 90%, whatever that means.  Yet ... and this is the bit that
baffles me ... the internet is *extremely* slow up there, to the point
that web pages sometimes time out, POP/SMTP email likewise.

And, to complicate matters, I was round there on Thursday, and
everything was absolutely fine.  It's intermittent, dammit.

I'd test bulk LAN transfers, but I've completely forgotten how to add
an XP machine to a Windows LAN for file sharing (although I remembered
how to set an individual folder for sharing).  Dammit.

You are inside their first (and for many, only) firewall.  The routers
don't accept commands from the WAN side of the connection, but do
accept such connections from the inside.  In most cases, the inside
(&quot;LAN&quot;) side of the connection still has the password assigned by the
designers at the factory.  In such cases, you can take over the
router, set passwords, deny connections to the owner's computers, turn
off the firewall etc.  But doing any of these makes it more likely
that the owner realizes something is wrong and hiring someone with the
skills to lock down their system.

Taking over their computer?  Most of these routers are not used for
file networking, so there's not a lot of chance to implant hooks into
their systems that way.  But since you're inside the hardware
firewall, you have a lot more of Windows exposed to your hacking
prowess.  And if they ARE doing file sharing of more than just a
well-defined &quot;share&quot; directory, then you probably can do something.

It's a long time since the early days of always-on internet
connections.  I remember arguing with someone that he should password
protect his file shares.  He had two computers on a local net.  When
he got an ADSL modem he just plugged it into his existing hub and
changed his computers to pick up IP addresses from the telco.  After
failing to convince him to change his mind about file share passwords,
I went home, plugged his email address into Windows &quot;find a computer
on the network&quot; query and linked to his C drive.  I added a command
saying &quot;You really are vulnerable here.  Press enter to continue&quot; to
his bootup script (autoexec.bat).  This was, of course, before
networks of slave computers took over the email systems of the world.

It's hard to say without knowing more. Having access to their computer
(via their network connection, or some other way) is necessary but not
sufficient for taking it over.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Can I at least take over their connection and set a password?

Again, necessary but not sufficient. If they have an unsecured wireless
network AND a default password is still set AND remote administration is
turned on, it's trivially simple. If you're missing the middle one, you
can dictionary-attack the machine and probably get the password (most
people still use retarded passwords), and if you're missing the last
one, you can attack a machine that IS directly connected to it and get
access that way.

&gt; A smart wireless router wouldn't allow such actions from a wireless
&gt; connection, insisting on wired.  Then again, a smart router wouldn't
&gt; default to &quot;ravish me&quot; mode.  (Just because they haven't put any
&gt; security on the signal doesn't mean they haven't got a password on the
&gt; admin account.  Certainly increases the odds though.)  Try &quot;password&quot;
&gt; as the password if there is one.

or 'admin'/'admin', or 'admin'/(no password), or (no userid)/'admin',
or... ...well, just go down the list:

You can also fingerprint the thing. Most of 'em will either outright
tell you what they are, or at least give you some hints, if you hit the
right ports on 'em, and a lot of them have a default SSID - a lot of
wireless connections advertise themselves as 'linksys', for example.

The two wifi routers I know have (IIRC) both asked specifically if
wireless administration should be enabled as part of their initial

&gt; I'd test bulk LAN transfers, but I've completely forgotten how to add

&gt; how to set an individual folder for sharing).  Dammit.

Assuming you're on the machine _without_ shared folders:  There's a
folder on the desktop called &quot;My Network Places&quot; or similar.  Go to
&lt;that&gt;\Entire Network\Microsoft Windows Network\&lt;workgroup&gt;\&lt;other
machine&gt;\&lt;share&gt; .  Or skip all that gooey stuff and go to Start -&gt;
Run... -&gt; \\&lt;other machine's IP&gt;\ .  Or the local shares may show up
when you open &quot;My Network Places&quot;.

That's if you just want to access a remote network share, which is fine
for testing LAN throughput.  A remote folder can be permanently mounted
and assigned a drive letter for programs that don't grok UNC paths, so
you don't need every machine to be a file server, only one of them.

Finding out what network traffic is moving across a network you control
is trivial.  Programs like Ethereal(aka wireshark) can capture all traffic
running across a wire.  Depending on the speed of your connection, a simple
desktop PC would be enough to capture 100% of the traffic.

Given 100% of the traffic and sufficient knowledge, you can reconstruct
the entirety of the session.  If we assume for a moment that no encryption
of any sort is being used, then you can quite literally see exactly what
they saw.
