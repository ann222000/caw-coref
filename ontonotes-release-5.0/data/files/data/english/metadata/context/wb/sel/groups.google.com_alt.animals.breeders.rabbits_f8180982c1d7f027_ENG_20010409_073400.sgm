Hi, i'm new at this - new to both the rabbit world and to
writing/e-mailing, seeking info from others through internet. i don't
even know how you can respond back to me? we'll see soon enough.

I just (they are 6 weeks old, have had them at home for 2.5 days) bought
two female bunnies, one is a mini lop (mixed with a holland lop) and the
other is a mini rex. They were together in a cage at the pet store, and
the girl said worse case scenario is they don't get along and i will
have to give them their own space in the (large) cage i bought. They
seem to be fine together, I THINK. Apparently, if there are going to be
dominance issues, it will be the lop (Sophie) bossing the Rex (Stella)
around. So far, Stella seems more dominant; more rambunctious. She
grooms Sophie and she licks her eyes, which kinda freaks me out. Sophie
is pretty mellow in the cage, just plops down and stretches out.

So, my first concern is that this eye licking/washing is normal, not
harmful.

Secondly, i let them run around (exercise) the hall and my kitchen and
barricade the rest of the place, which has wires, hiding spots, carpets,
etc. They - especially the Rex, Stella, is chewing EVERYTHING. All the
corners of the kitchen cabinets (wood and all fabric stuff), carpets,
tassels, rubber mat, my pillows and shoes that i have shoved under the
couch so they can't crawl under and through the rest of my place. I read
that, with cats anyhow, if you rub SOAP, they will stay away. I have
done that, but they are still finding bits of corners i have missed, or
start in on the carpet (area rugs only, so i suppose i could move them,
don't want to though - could i temporarily, is this like a bunny
teething thing?. They are going to destroy my stuff!! I think they will
start on my couch soon, which i can't rub soap on! Stella, is nipping at
me and chewing my hair, toes, clothes, etc. I bought a wood chew 'toy'
but i think one of them peed on it. i washed it, but they aren't
interested in it. Do they have a NEED to chew, what can i substitute?
(they have pellets, hay, alfalfa, a good supply of/from water bottle)
how do i discipline them?
What would be a good barricade? I was thinking, (also for convenience),
the sun shade things people fold up and stretch out for their car
windshields, but i think 'my girls' will chew right threw them, or push
them over.

Also, do you find they get to be affectionate? know their names?
respond? any tips, tidbits, good and bad would be most appreciative! i
want to be happy and enjoy them, and for them to be healthy and happy. I
am not sure how to read a rabbit, have only had dogs before. i am in a
condo, am away a lot and wanted two for company for each other. i bought
a book, but i didn't find it all that great.
Can i give a bunny TOO much affection/attention?

Thank you so much for any guidance!

Julie Ann

Hi!
Most everything id normal here. I dont think there is much you can do a
bout chewing. You can never love bunnies too much. Dont worry. Licking is
normal and unharmful if one starts hurting the other it will defend itself.
Good luck
