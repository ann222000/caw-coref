Fantastic. Kickin butt on the Dman.. IMO much like yourself any anni is a
good anni. I can't remember how the stats fall though.... +15 stats? / 11
resists? / 10% mf??? If so that's a nice mf anni. 10% is the highest for an
anni i think. Most pplz look for the stats on the resists and mf. Not so
much stats but like any other sought after item a Perfect is Priceless...

Stats/Resists/XP gained. No MF on an Anni. And from my experience, stats is
looked at as much or more than XP gained is, cause a lot of players, PvPers
in particular, greatly want max stats. Mainly cause
1)For a pala for example, 20 vita=60 life, compared to 30 life for a 10
vita, which is then in turn boosted higher by BO.
2)Lots of them like to strength bug, and an anni that provides 20 strength
means saving 20 strength points for gear, as opposed to saving just 10 from
a 10 stat anni. And 10 less strength needed in turn means 10 more in vita.

That said though, any Anni is indeed a good Anni.
