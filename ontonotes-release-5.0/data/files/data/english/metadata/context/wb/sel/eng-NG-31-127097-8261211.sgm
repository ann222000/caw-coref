Incorrect.

The etiquette for Usenet always has been to post in context, at the
bottom and if appropriate, to trim to context.

If you don't wish to follow that procedure, you are not obliged to post

Anyone interested enough in a thread will already know all the old stuff
because they will have just read it somewhere between one minute and one
day ago and will not need to do several page-downs to get to the new
stuff. This is especially true nowadays, because retention of text-only
messages has become very good. Nobody expects to bottom post when
replying an email.  It's just not business-like or professional.

But back in the days when Usenet was starting, and so starting its
conventions, posts fell off quite quickly.  So a person coming in on the
third leg, say, of a discussion could not necessarily go back and start
with the beginning post.  If the third leg had all three posts, by
quoting both of the first two,  the newcomer could jump right in.  And
of course the beginning came at  the top, since the continuances were
extended along the bottom.  In ancient times, it was the natural way to post.

Times have changed, of course, but the convention of bottom posting is
used nowadays generally by the dinosaurs. Conventions do change, but
usually slowly.  If one insists on bottom posting, you must remove most
of the previous posters text; otherwise, it's bad netiquette or internet
posting manners. Besides, it shows that you are a lazy shit if you
don't.

This is absurd. Bottom posting is the convention that maintains
the logical order in the postings (if everyone does it correctly,
and there is not a mix of top and bottom postings), a logical
following of the header &quot;tree&quot; order, and it also permits a logical
order to continue in the thread if a response is &quot;interleaved&quot;
with the previous poster's post. Scrolling is um, well.
EXTREMELY fast and easy, either with a mouse move, or
by clicking in the bar on the right - and this avoids missing
anything in the thread which may have appeared earlier. It is
not bad &quot;netiquette&quot; to edit earlier posts in the thread to
bring your post to the point and to condense the thread, so
long as the essential parts of the thread are not lost.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Besides, it shows that you are a lazy shit if you

I think quite the reverse! And, I spend some time trying to
sort out correct posting order for previous posts and edit
them to restore logical order and content when I post...

But if you snip the existing material, you aren't retaining the previous
posts, so the argument to bottom post loses some continuity. It just
becomes a top post with the comment you are answering (such as the
above) leading the post. &lt;g&gt;

As a long time lurker and only occasional poster, I'm anything but a
newbie or a troll, and I personally find the bottom posts to be rather
annoying. I'm reading the posts in order, and don't really need to see
the previous posts to understand the content. If it is a long
conversation, scrolling down to the bottom gets old quickly. And if a
lot of people simply paste comments into the body of a several previous
posts (especially when they already contain other comments) it gets durn
near unreadable.

Top posting is easier to my mind. FWIW

I didn't bottom post - I copied a small portion of the previous comment
and responded to it - in a far more pleasant manner than you, I might
add. It is a logical format for posting a response to only a part of
another post.

I part company with the thought that an entire thread should be
maintained in every post. Perhaps some news readers don't have a visual

replied to what &amp; when, and don't need the entire thread to keep

Drook: I apologize if I lumped you with a troll.  I realize that a

The battle over top posting isn't worth continuing.  I'll continue to bottom
post as that is the normal convention in Usenet land. Consistency makes it
easier for all of us.

Hear hear! (about Hal and David R).  This NG tends to attract a lot of
short-term visitors who arrive with questions and then depart once their
questions have been answered.  Hal and David are among a small group who are
generous enough to answer the same questions over and over, sharing a lot of
technical knowledge without too much impatience.  (Hal can get testy
sometimes, but he's paid a high price for his OSA.)  I think they deserve
thanks rather than attacks.

&gt;&gt; at all.

&gt;&gt; I don't consider Hal &amp; David R to be old curmudgeons. Their information
&gt;&gt; is usually useful and timely, and I have gained from them in the past. My
&gt;&gt; comment was intended for levity, but obviously didn't quite attain it.

&gt; Hear hear! (about Hal and David R).  This NG tends to attract a lot of
&gt; short-term visitors who arrive with questions and then depart once their
&gt; questions have been answered.  Hal and David are among a small group who
&gt; are generous enough to answer the same questions over and over, sharing a
&gt; lot of technical knowledge without too much impatience.  (Hal can get
&gt; testy sometimes, but he's paid a high price for his OSA.)  I think they
&gt; deserve thanks rather than attacks.

Helco, thanx a lot but I disagree a bit: I can get testy &quot;lots of the time.&quot;
I have an inborn habit  of not suffering trolls and fools kindly.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, drook why bottom post then? Sounds like you're intimidating by those
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who bottom post?  That's what they want, you know.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I didn't bottom post - I copied a small portion of the previous comment
&gt;&gt;&gt; and responded to it - in a far more pleasant manner than you, I might
&gt;&gt;&gt; add. It is a logical format for posting a response to only a part of
&gt;&gt;&gt; another post.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I part company with the thought that an entire thread should be
&gt;&gt;&gt; maintained in every post. Perhaps some news readers don't have a visual
&gt;&gt;&gt; thread order, but in Thunderbird, which I use, I can easily see who has
&gt;&gt;&gt; replied to what &amp; when, and don't need the entire thread to keep
&gt;&gt;&gt; continuity. Having to scan a long thread usually stops me from reading it
&gt;&gt;&gt; at all.
