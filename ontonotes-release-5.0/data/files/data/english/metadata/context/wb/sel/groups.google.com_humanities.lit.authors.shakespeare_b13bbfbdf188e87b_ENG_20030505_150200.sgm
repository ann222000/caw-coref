In his biography of the Renaissance genius Francis Bacon,
the famous English writer and barrister from Middle Temple,
William Hepworth Dixon, answers the test question that
Stratfordians, Oxfordians, Marlites and Derbyites persistently
flunk:

Did Francis Bacon have the time to write the
write the Shakespeare works?

If no one at the court could match [Bacon's] tongue of fire,
so no one in the House of Commons could breast him in the race
of work. He put the dunce to flight, the drudge to shame.

If [Bacon] soared high above rivals in his more passionate
play of speech, he never met a rival in the dull, dry task of
ordinary toil.

Raleigh, Hyde, and Cecil had small chance against him in debate;
in committee Yelverton and Coke had none.

And your evidence that the Burgher was a genius is what?
Taken from the Shakespeare works? There's nothing outside
the works to suggest that the Burgher was a genius and
the non-literary evidence listed on the Kathman-Ross site
attests to the fact that he was quite ordinary.

History's greatest genius doesn't have to make a living
collecting tithes from parishioners in the form of bags
of corn and wool.

That's how the Burgher spent his time, Grumman.

The farmers around Stratford didn't have coinage so the
Burgher went out with a wagon and collected bags of
commodities and sold them on behalf of Trinity parish.
He turned 80% of the money over to Trinity and he
kept 20%. That's how &quot;history's greatest genius&quot;
made his living.

Do you seriously believe that the genius who wrote
the Shakespeare works was out in a waggon picking
up hides and livestock and selling it to pay the
parish? Grow up, Grumman.

I was under the impression that Will of Stratford spent a
good deal of his time on and around the London stage.

&quot;Historys greatest geniuses&quot; made their livings doing lots
of things that frequently didn't have much to do with their
genius travail.

We think Will was a genius, and his fellow actors - and
playwrights like Ben Jonson - thought he was bloody brilliant,
but most other people just thought he was a damn good
playwright.

We also think Van Gogh is a genius, for example, but his fellow
men, with the exception of his brother and a few other painters,
thought he was a nutcase, for example, and only bought two of his
paintings during his lifetime.

Try to pay attention, Elizabeth. I said nothing about any Burgher's genius
above. As for Shakespeare's genius, my evidence is the monument that gives him
the genius of Socrates. His name on various well-received plays supports this
record. It must be admitted that the record was carved six or seven years after
the Burgher died, when no one could be expected to remember anything of
consequence about him, so is weak evidence.

My evidence is that Jonson was a monumental parodist.

I've already cited Annabel Patterson, Sterling Professor of
Literature, Yale, who wrote a study on Jonson's &quot;double speak.&quot;
Jonson is mocking the Burgher. Jonson knew the identity of the
author of the Shakespeare plays as early as 1598.

Every mask in literary history has his or her name on the title

In an authorship dispute a name on a title page is just the
starting point in the search for evidence.

Now if the Stratford Shakespeare had a handwriting match with
the Henry IV draft you'd have something but sadly it wasn't
written an illiterate barbaric scrawl.

That's not an officially registered Strat Excuse. You'll have

Jonson was a brilliant parodist and he did his best work
in the First Folio. A distinguished scholar, Annabel Patterson,
has written a book on Jonson's mastery of &quot;double speak.&quot;
Jonson's so-called eulogy is a mock encomium in the

The word &quot;genius&quot; has been so debased that if you type
&quot;francis bacon&quot; + &quot;genius&quot; in a search engine you get
20,000 hits for the Irish painter who had about the same
level of genius as Lucien Freud.

That Francis Bacon was a collateral descendant of the genius

factoidal evidence against Shakespeare: the opinion that he lacked sufficient
education of the proper kind to have been a playwright.

I hope to write a short essay concerning the above theme, but will not argue

There is no such thing as &quot;hard and soft evidence,&quot; Grumman.
Those are colloquialisms.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Factual evidence for Shakespeare:

"/>

The P R O B L E M for Strats, Grumman, is that while they have
evidence of the first order of the Burgher's burghership in
Stratford, they have only ambiguous literary evidence of the
Burgher's authorship of the Shakespeare works. Nothing first
hand. No reliable witnesses. No evidence such as a holograph
that can exclude inferences.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; the testimony of his monument;

"/>

A few objections to that theory: An anonymous epitaph cannot
be considered to be evidence. It could be considered part of
a circumstantial case but it has to be backed up by corroborative
evidence. Names on title pages would be very weak corrobrative
evidence for the monument. You would need something like a scrap
of paper that had a draft version of the epitaph or something
about it in a letter from a contemporary who had direct knowledge
of the Burgher's authorship.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; factoidal evidence against Shakespeare: the opinion that he lacked sufficient
&gt; education of the proper kind to have been a playwright.

"/>

In the authorship distpute Strats have to assume a
burden of proof and show evidence that the Burgher
had sufficient education not to be a mere playwright
but that he received an extraordinary education to
prepare him to write the most intellectual of all
literary works.

Of the four leading authorship candidates, only Francis Bacon
received an extraordinary education, an education almost
unique in history.

You don't understand anti-Strat logic:

Effective use of language is easy.
Precise observation and drawing of character is easy.
Pacing is easy.

Shakespeare is a great author
But it couldn't have anything to do with language, or
character drawing, or pacing, because all of those
are easy (and even a little disreputable).
So his greatness must lie elsewhere.
It must be his educational value.

In a way, it's rather amusing that Weird Lizzie, who so readily goes
into orgasms over the Renaissance, should actually have such a
fundamentally medieval attitude. She seems to have Shakespeare confused
with Jean de Meung.

Bob, you're working too hard! Just kick out any
theory obviously nurtured solely by its own conclusion.

Antis need to deconstruct the knowledge base. SO they
become oh-so-obvious in the selective treatment of the
historical record. I will use the best and the brightest, Diana
Price, as an example here...

That Diana Price's cold teachings do not point to any writer
does not distract us from the fact that Diana has her own mind
set on where her detail will lead, and hence she can feature only
details that support THAT conclusion.

SO, Susanna Hall is illiterate in Diana's teachings but only
because Diana thinks it helps lead us to her conclusion. Diana is
obviously working backward toward her conclusion because
Susanna's level of literacy is not known.

No one knows how much Susanna could read or write,
but Diana Price actually declares Susanna functionally illiterate!

Why does Diana Price base her unnecessary CONCLUSION
on just one random piece of evidence? Why does Diana Price
portend that this was the one and only time that Susanna
attempted any penmanship?

Very obviously, Diana is working from her own conclusion.

Diana thinks she is LEADING us to her conclusion, but we see
that it is where she STARTED. Diana has no basis to judge
Susanna's literacy. One sample does not amount to much
so it is Diana who is lacking, not Susanna. We know Susanna
owned books which happens to be A CRITERION DIANA
PRICE SETS AS THE INDICATION OF BEING A WRITER!

Wow, her self contradictory monstrosity of a hatchet job is
so convoluted it's no wonder Diana and Pat don't respond.

SO--Diana Price's reading deficiency is known, whereas
Susanna's is not. If Dooley believes Price gave Susanna
a fair hearing on this one, he is a mercenary hangdog.

That's what I'm trying to do, in a slightly new way, inspired by the slightly
new way my heroine, Diana Price, presents standard Ogburnianism (i.e., why dint
nobody say nothing about Will Shakespeare of STRATFORD being a writer?)

Nice writing from you, though, on Ms. Price's entry in the clash of opinion.
I note that in this case, as in so many specimens of Shakespeare-rejecter's
argumentation, a double opinion is used: (1) Susanna was illiterate; (2) the
daughters of great writers are not illiterate.

&gt;That Diana Price's cold teachings do not point to any writer
&gt;does not distract us from the fact that Diana has her own mind
&gt;set on where her detail will lead, and hence she can feature only
&gt;details that support THAT conclusion.

&gt;SO, Susanna Hall is illiterate in Diana's teachings but only
&gt;because Diana thinks it helps lead us to her conclusion. Diana is
&gt;obviously working backward toward her conclusion because
&gt;Susanna's level of literacy is not known.

&gt;No one knows how much Susanna could read or write,
&gt;but Diana Price actually declares Susanna functionally illiterate!

&gt;Why does Diana Price base her unnecessary CONCLUSION
&gt;on just one random piece of evidence? Why does Diana Price
&gt;portend that this was the one and only time that Susanna
&gt;attempted any penmanship?

&gt;Very obviously, Diana is working from her own conclusion.

&gt;Diana thinks she is LEADING us to her conclusion, but we see
&gt;that it is where she STARTED. Diana has no basis to judge
&gt;Susanna's literacy. One sample does not amount to much
&gt;so it is Diana who is lacking, not Susanna. We know Susanna
&gt;owned books which happens to be A CRITERION DIANA
&gt;PRICE SETS AS THE INDICATION OF BEING A WRITER!

&gt;Wow, her self contradictory monstrosity of a hatchet job is
&gt;so convoluted it's no wonder Diana and Pat don't respond.

&gt;SO--Diana Price's reading deficiency is known, whereas
&gt;Susanna's is not. If Dooley believes Price gave Susanna
&gt;a fair hearing on this one, he is a mercenary hangdog.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the testimony of his monument;

&gt;&gt;&gt;A few objections to that theory: An anonymous epitaph cannot
&gt;&gt;&gt;be considered to be evidence.

&gt;&gt; It is a FACT that someone said Shakespeare of Stratford was a writer sometime
&gt;&gt;between 1616 and 1623. That cannot be denied. It is therefore evidence that he
&gt;&gt; was a writer. You can claim that it is weak evidence, though it of course is
&gt;&gt; not.

&gt;No one denies that &quot;someone&quot; said that the Burgher was a
&gt;writer. All witnesses have to be tested, Grumman. Jonson
&gt;can't pass the test.

"/>

My point is ONLY that the testimony of the monument is a fact. Unlike your
opinion that Jonson wrote, and your opinion, with no factual evidence, that he
was lying when he did so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; factoidal evidence against Shakespeare: the opinion that he lacked sufficient
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; education of the proper kind to have been a playwright.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In the authorship dispute Strats have to assume a
&gt;&gt;&gt;burden of proof and show evidence that the Burgher
&gt;&gt;&gt;had sufficient education not to be a mere playwright
&gt;&gt;&gt;but that he received an extraordinary education to
&gt;&gt;&gt;prepare him to write the most intellectual of all
&gt;&gt;&gt;literary works.

&gt;&gt; You really think it is a FACT that the author of the Shakespearean oevre
&gt;&gt;&quot;received an extraordinary education to prepare him to write the most
&gt;&gt; intellectual of all literary works?&quot; Unbelievable.

&gt;What is more unbelievable, Grumman?

&gt;1. That a country lad spontaneously wrote the
&gt;most intellectual of all literary works or
&gt;2. The author of the most intellectual of
&gt;all literary works received an extraordinary
&gt;education?

"/>

Well, one write who wrote literary works that were much more intellectual than
Shakespeare's was Tom Stoppard. He had only a high school education at the
time. Another who wrote literary works more intellectual than Shakespeare's was
Wallace Stevens. He went to Harvard but can't be said to have had all that
&quot;extraordinary&quot; an education.

But in answer to your question: (2) is more likely than (1); going from my
knowledge of writers, however, if (1) were stated honestly, without
&quot;spontaneously,&quot; I would say it was a toss up.

Note that you ignored what I said was unbelievable: which is that you seem to be
claiming as a FACT that the author of the Shakespearean oevre

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Bob, you're working too hard! Just kick out any

&gt; That's what I'm trying to do, in a slightly new way, inspired by the slightly
&gt; new way my heroine, Diana Price, presents standard Ogburnianism (i.e., why dint
&gt; nobody say nothing about Will Shakespeare of STRATFORD being a writer?)

&gt; Nice writing from you, though, on Ms. Price's entry in the clash of opinion.
&gt; I note that in this case, as in so many specimens of Shakespeare-rejecter's
&gt; argumentation, a double opinion is used: (1) Susanna was illiterate; (2) the
&gt; daughters of great writers are not illiterate.

What is hilarious about Price's arbitrary test
is that Susanna Shakespeare scores higher than Marlowe!

2. Record of correspondence concerning literary matters
See Cooke if books are literary matters

6. Handwritten inscriptions, receipts, letters, etc. touching on literary
matters
See Cooke if books are literary matters

7. Commendatory verses, epistles, or epigrams contributed or received
Witty, some of Shakespeare in that

9. Evidence of books owned, borrowed, or given.

10. Notice at death as a writer
Witty, some of Shakespeare in that

SO, if Shakespeare wrote too little, Price has written TOO MUCH!
She's contradicting herself and confusing everyone except Dooley.

I can't follow some of your evidence but I can see at a glance
that Susanna scored higher than Shakespeare.

I'll give you 7. if your including epitaphs but you can't
have 10. because the OED shows &quot;witty&quot; as having a religious
connotation:

B. witty

1. Having wisdom.

a. Said of God or Christ: cf. WISE a. 1 (b). Obs.

Beowulf 685 Witi god..hali dryhten. a1000 Cædmon's Exod.
25 Hu as woruld worhte witi drihten. . . . 1380 Lay Folks'
Catech. (L.) 531 This god is most myty yng at may be.

i. (1908) 18 The persone of the sone [is] al wyse and witty.
c1480 HENRYSON Swallow vi, God in all his werkis wittie is.

Honigmann missed a crucial allusion in Hall's epitaph
that would have identified Susanna Hall as a Presbyterian.
Honigmann considers Hall's ephitaph to be secular but
the pius Presbyterian Puritans would never have a
secular tombstone.

The phrase &quot;something of Shakespeare in all of that&quot;
is a bit of historical revisionism to make the Burgher
look religious after the fact. The line translates to
&quot;Shakespeare had a hand in training his daughter to
be witty [have wisdom] in religion&quot; not &quot;Shakespare had
a hand in giving his daughter an education.&quot;

If you want constantly to lie about our position, Paul, why not be creative and
say we think aliens for the 23rd dimension told him what to write?

Just for the record, I believe he became the writer he did because of his genes,
and his learning somehow to read, and because he became an actor at the time he
did. I doubt that you will credit me with this view--I've stated it ten or
twenty times, but you consistently ignore what I say. I doubt that other
Stratfordians believe he became what he did for exactly the same reasons as
mine, but none believe in any sort of magic pen, only that he no more needed a
university education than Hardy, Yeats, Keats, Jonson, Stoppard, Mencken, Twain,
Thomas, Shaw and many other writers of the first rank in English did.

That's a lie.

It is true that it certainly wasn't education beyond what the works
actually exhibit, which is a standard Elizabethan grammar-school
education. Genes, as any educated person knows, are nearly meaningless
as a predictor of literary talent. He did not have a background of
illiteracy. He did, in fact, have _some_ social connections through his
profession, but the supposition that social connections are necessary to
the literary life is nothing but plain old snobbery (no doubt you
pronounce your name &quot;cro-LAY&quot;), and can empirically refuted a thousand
times over. We have no record of whether he had or did not have a
&quot;mentor&quot;, though he almost certainly did, theatre being what it is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the testimony of his monument;

&gt;&gt;&gt;A few objections to that theory: An anonymous epitaph cannot
&gt;&gt;&gt;be considered to be evidence.

&gt;&gt; It is a FACT that someone said Shakespeare of Stratford was a writer
sometime
&gt;&gt; between 1616 and 1623. That cannot be denied. It is therefore evidence
that he
&gt;&gt; was a writer. You can claim that it is weak evidence, though it of
course is
&gt;&gt; not.

&gt; No one denies that &quot;someone&quot; said that the Burgher was a
&gt; writer. All witnesses have to be tested, Grumman. Jonson
&gt; can't pass the test.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; factoidal evidence against Shakespeare: the opinion that he lacked
sufficient
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; education of the proper kind to have been a playwright.

&gt;&gt;&gt;In the authorship dispute Strats have to assume a
&gt;&gt;&gt;burden of proof and show evidence that the Burgher
&gt;&gt;&gt;had sufficient education not to be a mere playwright
&gt;&gt;&gt;but that he received an extraordinary education to
&gt;&gt;&gt;prepare him to write the most intellectual of all
&gt;&gt;&gt;literary works.

&gt;&gt; You really think it is a FACT that the author of the Shakespearean oevre
&gt;&gt;&quot;received an extraordinary education to prepare him to write the most
&gt;&gt; intellectual of all literary works?&quot; Unbelievable.

&gt; What is more unbelievable, Grumman?

&gt; 1. That a country lad spontaneously wrote the
&gt; most intellectual of all literary works or

&gt; 2. The author of the most intellectual of
&gt; all literary works received an extraordinary
&gt; education?

"/>

The author of the plays displays a profound knowledge of:

1. Law. (The one Elizabeth champions practiced law; Shaksper - of course
not.) This is not merely a passing knowledge but precise knowledge.

2. Politics. (Elizabeth's candidate was part of the Royal Court and also in
Parliament. Shaksper - neither of course.)

3. Academic learning. Shaksper went to no university, most of the other
candidates did.

4. The author knows Latin, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian. This is partly
evidenced from his quoting and referring to works not then translated into
English, and only available at the Courts of Europe. All impossible for
Shaksper. Not for Bacon. Possibly not for other candidates.

5. Philosophy.

6. Intimate knowledge of European geography, including distances from place
to place, as one having travelled there. How far did Shaksper travel?

7. Actually, the author uses terms, acording to other sources of mine (I
admittedly would not know) only at use at Cambridge University at the time:
not even at Oxford, etc. Bacon went to Cambridge. Shaksper?

Of course, over half the folio plays had only been published or played
anonymously before 1623. Someone around 1623 &quot;decided&quot; to put them under the
name of Shake-Speare (with that curious hyphonation not otherwise used then
or now for such a name - after all Shaksper's name has no hyphon). Why,
then, the hyphon?

The Shaker of the Speare was Pallas Athena, also apearing on frontiespieces
of various Shake-Speare MSs. And Pallas Athena was the Muse Bacon has
referred to.

The author loved a good joke. It was common practice at the time to write
under pseudonymns or even the real names of others who were paid at times
for the practice. How wonderfully apt it must have been to have discovered
one called Shaksper or Shakspere, where a mere hyphen would instill the real
meaning, give the joke away to those with eyes to see.

Who knows? Even the true name &quot;William&quot; may have been viewed as part of the
joke in paying this man to use his name... the real author of the plays
&quot;Will Shake [the] Spear&quot; of Pallas Athena, the Spear-Shaker and the Greek
tenth muse and chief of all the muses....

Just some thoughts...

Hyphon / hyphen. Apologies for typos. In my case due to writing quickly; in

e.g. that very hyphenation.

Ah! And I tracked down more on Bacon and the use of &quot;in&quot; terms only used at

To try uncharacteristically to be civil, I would say that there are experts in
all fields who believe that Shakespeare was an expert in those fields, but there
are also experts in the same fields who are sure he was not. There is no
factual evidence, such as the testimony of someone that he was--or was not--a
lawyer, to support an expert. Shakespeare's expertise is therefore a matter of
opinion. As for the rest of your very unoriginal opinions, they have been
refuted too much already at HLAS for me to want to take the time to refute them
again. I note, also, that you ignore all the factual evidence for Will
Shakespeare of Stratford.

From a post by Christian Lancai last June:
--------------------start of quote -----------------------

In &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, Timon to Apemantus:
&quot;Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
....
Thy nature did commence in sufferance.&quot;

Only Cambridge graduates 'commence' in a faculty, which ceremony is
called 'the Commencement'. If he goes to a higher degree, he
proceedeth. The same kind of Cambridge university language is also
found in Henry IV and King Lear. Lear tells Regan in a rage:

&quot;'Tis not in thee to scant my sizes.&quot;

What on earth does he mean by 'sizes'? 'Size' is a very peculiar
Cambridge term. It is a portion, a farthing of brew and drink which
scholars at Cambridge have at the buttery. To then be 'scanted of
sizes' was a punishment for undergraduates and an indignity revolting
enough to drive Lear at any length in his fury. It was a uniquely
Cambridge term, which you could only learn the hard way by being
subject to that very punishment - at Cambridge only, in the university
only.

Now, what about Dr John Caius? There are various doctors in the plays,
but only one is being ridiculed: Dr John Caius of Kay, founder of the
Caius College in Cambridge, who died in 1573, the very year when the
Bacon brothers went to Cambridge and when Oxford was at his most
active as a student there. Now, doctor Caius was an awesome authority.
He had been the Queen's physician, and he was wirthout an equal as a
medical expert in the realm. But he took himself too seriously. He
travelled widely on the continent and adopted foreign manners, which
especially the Queen found ludicrous. The character in MWW is a French
doctor and precisely a caricature of an eccentric with artifical
foreign manners. He was not popular with the students, and they were
not popular with him: he made a sport out of expelling fellows - there
were 20 expulsions in all authorized by him. He was exactly the right
sort of old fogey for students to ridicule and make fun of behind his
back, which Oxford certainly must have enjoyed taking part in, and
which the Bacons must have heard many stories and legends of
immediately after his death. The stories would certainly have
survived even to Marlowe's student days.

--------------------end of quote -----------------------

Christian's argument works fine until he comes to
Dr Caius. The author clearly knew the man and
had a strong personal animus against him. Caius
was dead long before Marlowe attended (and Bacon
only went up in September 1573, after the man had
died). Whereas Oxford was 14 years older than
Marlowe, and 11 years older than Bacon, and almost
certainly had personal experience of the man and of
the student riots he caused by his autocratic behaviour.
(While he was not enrolled as a student, his private
tutor was a highly respected Cambridge don; Oxford
lived nearby, and almost certainly attended lectures
and mixed with Cambridge students to some extent.

There is no great point to making fun of a man who is
long dead. Those scenes of the MWW were clearly
written before 1573 and played before an audience who
knew him. (Clue: He was well-known at court, having
been the Queen's physician.)

of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and

Want more of Shakespeare's philosophy? Try this....

...One man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
--Jaques

So, that's the infant, the school-boy, the lover, the soldier,
the justice, the aged, and the senile. That is Shakespeare's
philosophy. Where is there any stage of man about nobility,
court, power, influence, or stature? Doesn't have one!

Please show any philosophy portrayed in the works that
you find impossible for this named author to have known
and understood.

Yours are just hackneyed brand &quot;x&quot; condemnations, silly
hand-me-downs from antiStrats who are driven not by fact but by spite.

&gt; Of course, over half the folio plays had only been published or played

&gt; or now for such a name - after all Shaksper's name has no hyphon). Why,
&gt; then, the hyphon?

Hyphens can be punctuation and/or spelling variances, two areas of
Elizabethan writing that were not consistent then, and not similar
to our modern usage. But the men who produced the First Folio
were not being cagey--they named a man they were well associated
with both in James' court AND in Stratford.

It can't be an artistic pseudonym if the name is in use currently

I called myself Diana-Price or Paul-Crowley.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How wonderfully apt it must have been to have discovered

&gt; joke in paying this man to use his name... the real author of the plays
&gt;&quot;Will Shake [the] Spear&quot; of Pallas Athena, the Spear-Shaker and the Greek

The joke would be on the IDIOT who forwent the million pounds
Shakespeare earned in his place. That would defeat the premise that

Elizabeth (hi), I must disagree with you. Of course, there's absolutely
profound philosophy in the Shakespeare works - not just obviously profound
philosophy, but also with deeper meanings only caught upon close scrutiny.
They are certainly philosophical. However I see no problem with this in
regard to Shaksper having written it all. We don't know if he was in fact
such a profound visionary, I admit: he certainly left no letters to prove
it, nor straight philosophy. But surely he could have bought a bin of law
books in a 'barrow'? Why, there was even a book shop nearby - it may have
had a tome or two (no longer extant) from which to quote, surely?

Then he could have included this profound thinking into his plays, acted in
them, been paid for acting in them, but (since he felt he'd pilfered some of
the philosophy), graciously often declined (as records show) the much larger
sum due the author of the plays (often there was no payment accounted to the
author, though we have records of all other payments in some instances).
After all, it was only money, and philosophers (such as Shakespeare) have
their heads in the clouds.

Oh, yes, yes. I know what you'll say. No doubt you'll quote Francis Bacon
himself from &quot;The Essay of Friendship&quot; as found only in the 1607 &amp; 1612

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
edition, where he writes:

"/>

&quot;There be some whose lives are as if they perpetually played a part upon a
stage, disguised to all others,
open only to themselves.&quot;

Oh, and then you might quip that in Tobie Matthew's letter to Bacon , in
1623, written from France, we read: &quot;The most prodigious wit, that ever I
knew of my nation, and of this side of the sea, is of your Lordship's name,
though he be known by another.&quot;

But it probably means nothing. Mead was about in those days, and Essex had
the monopoly on sweet wine.

What is that I detect you think in reply? That in 1603, Bacon wrote to a
friend of his, the poet, John Davis, who had gone north to meet the King:
&quot;So desiring you to be good to concealed poets, I continue, yours very
assured, Fr. Bacon.&quot;

Francis Bacon, a concealed poet? Surely not. Even if he did write so of
himself. Why, since a newcomer is continually reminded along the lines &quot;This
was discussed and dealt with in HLAS in 1996&quot; and etc., etc., they've surely
found perfectly good reasons for these and a thousand other instances, yes?
E'en myself, right off the top of my head I have it: So Bacon, then, was a
concealed poet. (One who writes poetry, and is known by many to do so, yet
doesn't come out with it in his own name.) You know, if I wrote poetry, and
it was simply appalling, I might keep it concealed myself! That's it, yes?

But wait! Bacon is known to have written Sonnets! They are known and exist!
(Oh, but true, therefore are not concealed, I give you.)

What is this you say? That in a letter to Count Gondomar, Ambassador from
the Court of Spain, dated 6th June, 1621, Bacon writes: &quot;Now that at once my
age, my fortunes, and my genius, to which I have hitherto done but scanty
justice, call me from the stage of active life, I shall devote myself to
letters, instruct the actors on it, and serve posterity. In such a course, I
shall, perhaps find honour. And I shall thus pass my life as within the
verge of a better.&quot;

You've got me there. I admit it. Bacon spending his last five years devoting
himself to &quot;letters&quot; (authoring), in combination with the instruction of
actors?? Please tell, I know HLAS has dealt with this one. Which post and
year? Or might I save myself the trouble? I can already imagine that perhaps
Bacon discovered some ingenious means whereby his works of philosophy might
be acted out on the stage?

If Novum Organum could somehow have been acted, that would explain
everything here. It might even explain one of the 32 poems published
together upon Bacon's death (mighty strange they all are), this one of which
goes.

&quot;.ah! the tenth Muse and the glory of the choir has perished. Ah! never
before has Apollo himself been truly unhappy! Whence will there be another
to love him so? Ah! he is no longer going to have the full number; and
unavoidable is it now for Apollo to be content with nine Muses.&quot;

No, no, no. I see no reason to perceive anything of interest in Bacon being
called, over and over, by so many of his contemporaries, a &quot;Muse&quot;. And what
was that, above? That he was &quot;the tenth Muse&quot;? Ha! I can see where this is
going already. Yes, yes, yes, this is a poem in praise of Bacon upon his
death, and &quot;the tenth Muse&quot; is in Greek mythology Pallas Athena, the Shaker
of the Spear. Alright, so Bacon, admittedly, was being called upon his death
&quot;the Shaker of the Spear&quot;. I expect your point is that this was some form of
clue, a witty jest to those in the know. Have you never heard of
coincidence? (Or that sweet wine Essex enjoyed the monopoly of, and could
spread around to his pals?)

Well, must close. Nighttime here. To sleep, perchance to dream of Ben
Jonson, since it seems he's a very heartily revered fellow on HLAS. Deserves
it all too, I'd say.

Yawn. Must go. Starting to dream already. But before I do, what was it
Jonson once wrote? Oh, yes, he enumerated sixteen of the &quot;greatest wits&quot; of
his day. And he knew Shaksper, right? So allow me a placid dream, and tell
as I lay my head of his eulogy upon Shaksper.

Mmm? Nothing? Jonson didn't rate Shaksper among the top 16? Strange.
And what?? He did include Bacon? Surely he ranked lowly, however, with one
as able-minded as Jonson? Mmm? He wrote of Bacon:

&quot;it is he who hath filled up all numbers, and performed that in our tongue
which may be compared or preferred either to insolent Greece or haughty
Rome. . . . . So that he may be named the mark and acme of our language.&quot;
(Discoveries, Dominus Verulamius and Scriptorum Catalogus).

Egad! And I was just drifting off.

You've got me up and thinking now, darnation! All I wanted to do was sleep
in peace, and now you've forced me up and thinking...

&gt;--------------------start of quote -----------------------

&gt;In &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, Timon to Apemantus:
&gt;&quot;Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded
&gt;The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
&gt;....
&gt;Thy nature did commence in sufferance.&quot;

&gt;Only Cambridge graduates 'commence' in a faculty, which ceremony is
&gt;called 'the Commencement'. If he goes to a higher degree, he
&gt;proceedeth. The same kind of Cambridge university language is also
&gt;found in Henry IV and King Lear. Lear tells Regan in a rage:

"/>

How would even the Renaissance Genius Francis DeVere be allowed to use these
SECRET TERMS in a PLAY???!!!!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;'Tis not in thee to scant my sizes.&quot;

&gt; What on earth does he mean by 'sizes'? 'Size' is a very peculiar
&gt;Cambridge term. It is a portion, a farthing of brew and drink which
&gt;scholars at Cambridge have at the buttery. To then be 'scanted of
&gt;sizes' was a punishment for undergraduates and an indignity revolting
&gt;enough to drive Lear at any length in his fury.

"/>

But Lear lived before there was a Cambridge. So we have a joke, yes? (I assume
only bishops and Cardinals served anything to scholars at Cambridge since only
they could be expected to keep terms like &quot;sizes&quot; secret.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;It was a uniquely
&gt;Cambridge term, which you could only learn the hard way by being
&gt;subject to that very punishment - at Cambridge only, in the university
&gt;only.

"/>

What an incredibly stupid remark. You'd only hear about &quot;sizes&quot; at Cambridge if
you were deprived of them?!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Now, what about Dr John Caius? There are various doctors in the plays,
&gt;but only one is being ridiculed: Dr John Caius of Kay, founder of the
&gt;Caius College in Cambridge, who died in 1573, the very year when the
&gt;Bacon brothers went to Cambridge and when Oxford was at his most
&gt;active as a student there. Now, doctor Caius was an awesome authority.
&gt;He had been the Queen's physician, and he was wirthout an equal as a
&gt;medical expert in the realm. But he took himself too seriously. He
&gt;travelled widely on the continent and adopted foreign manners, which
&gt;especially the Queen found ludicrous. The character in MWW is a French
&gt;doctor and precisely a caricature of an eccentric with artifical
&gt;foreign manners. He was not popular with the students, and they were
&gt;not popular with him: he made a sport out of expelling fellows - there
&gt;were 20 expulsions in all authorized by him. He was exactly the right
&gt;sort of old fogey for students to ridicule and make fun of behind his
&gt;back, which Oxford certainly must have enjoyed taking part in, and
&gt;which the Bacons must have heard many stories and legends of
&gt;immediately after his death. The stories would certainly have
&gt;survived even to Marlowe's student days.

&gt;--------------------end of quote -----------------------

&gt;Christian's argument works fine until he comes to
&gt;Dr Caius. The author clearly knew the man and
&gt;had a strong personal animus against him.

"/>

Clearly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Caius was dead long before Marlowe attended (and Bacon
&gt;only went up in September 1573, after the man had
&gt;died). Whereas Oxford was 14 years older than
&gt;Marlowe, and 11 years older than Bacon, and almost
&gt;certainly had personal experience of the man and of
&gt;the student riots he caused by his autocratic behaviour.
&gt;(While he was not enrolled as a student, his private
&gt;tutor was a highly respected Cambridge don; Oxford
&gt;lived nearby, and almost certainly attended lectures
&gt;and mixed with Cambridge students to some extent.

&gt;There is no great point to making fun of a man who is
&gt;long dead.

"/>

Right, Paul. One does not mock a person in literature to reveal universal
absurdities, but only to get at someone living. I didn't think it possible that
there was something about literature that you knew less about than you do about
poetry, but comedy may be it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Those scenes of the MWW were clearly
&gt;written before 1573 and played before an audience who
&gt;knew him. (Clue: He was well-known at court, having
&gt;been the Queen's physician.)

Being a writer is the main qualification.
Your pontifications that Shakespeare must be educated

You'd be hard-pressed to explain which university taught

ownership of the venues! They were all church-going family men with
longstanding ties in London and they all became wealthy on Shakespeare's
plays. Who are you to deny their own unsolicited testimonies?

Why would your words overrule theirs?

I have a feeling you are another loudmouth with no foundation. If you
ignore history you hurt yourself, not Shakespeare.

Which Greek author identifies Athena as a tenth Muse? A quick internet
search suggests only Sappho of Lesbos as having, extravagantly, been so
acclaimed. Nor do I readily grasp how the Muses, attendant upon Apollo,
could include one of the great Goddesses.

Incidentally, over what art do you suggest Bacon, as a tenth Muse, would
preside? He wouldn't be needed for tragedy (patron Muse, Melpomene), or
comedy (Thalia), or history (Clio), or love poetry (Erato). All of which
pretty well eliminates him as responsible for the works of Shakepeare.

There is nothing 'secret' about these terms. But

&gt;&gt; What on earth does he mean by 'sizes'? 'Size' is a very peculiar
&gt;&gt;Cambridge term. It is a portion, a farthing of brew and drink which
&gt;&gt;scholars at Cambridge have at the buttery. To then be 'scanted of
&gt;&gt;sizes' was a punishment for undergraduates and an indignity revolting
&gt;&gt;enough to drive Lear at any length in his fury.

&gt; But Lear lived before there was a Cambridge. So we have a joke, yes?

Not really. Lear lived before they spoke English.
But, while a play written in ancient Celtic would
have been more historically accurate, it probably
wouldn't have been very successful on any
Elizabethan stage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;It was a uniquely

It's not my remark, and I agree that the author had
probably not suffered the penalty (although he may

&gt;&gt;Caius was dead long before Marlowe attended (and Bacon

&gt;&gt;certainly had personal experience of the man and of
&gt;&gt;the student riots he caused by his autocratic behaviour.
&gt;&gt;(While he was not enrolled as a student, his private

&gt; Right, Paul. One does not mock a person in literature to reveal universal

&gt; there was something about literature that you knew less about than you do about
&gt; poetry, but comedy may be it.

Can you give any examples of bitter mockery in
a play (or in a similar work, such as a TV film)
against some quite obscure figure (whom the
playwright had never met) and who died more
than twenty years before it was written?

No . . of course not. Well, can you give me any
remotely likely scenario? For example, when I
was at university there was a real bastard of a
dean, by the name of 'Tierney'. You obviously did
not know him, and he died over 20 years ago.
But how about putting him into one YOUR plays?
Following Shake-speare's example, it would not
be a play about a university -- so you would not
show him in his original setting, but doing quite
different things. You will slate the man --
particularly his accent and other personal
characteristics, just because that's what you
want to do.

How does that idea grab you?

Muse as in Muse: inspirer of all and unrestricted.

As to the origin of the &quot;tenth&quot;, since there were already nine, it seems
that any figure of greatness throughout history (even modern rock bands in
their names) therefore play upon being the ultimate or &quot;tenth&quot; Muse. There
are innumerable relationships between Bacon and Pallas (the Spear Shaker) -
and Shakespeare in general and Pallas, such as in her frequent apearances on
frontispieces (why??????).

As Ben Jonson broadly hinted regarding the Shakespeare / Pallas link as a
clue to deeper things in his somewhat awkward introductory verse to The
First Folio:

&quot;In each of which he seemes to shake a lance, As brandish't at the eyes of
ignorance.&quot;

The Baconian site

has it that:
Traditional muses did not suffice either. So he chose a tenth muse while he
was still in his teens in France. A letter Bacon received in 1582, from Jean
De la Jesse, personal secretary to the duc d'Anjou identifies his tenth
muse. Jesse asserts that his own Muse has been inspired by &quot;Bacon's Pallas&quot;,
&quot;bien que votre Pallas me rende mieux instruit&quot;.

Why Pallas Athena at all? A long story, enough for a book. Very briefly she
is patron of Justice, the Arts, Goddess of Wisdom, and much else beside.
When she shook her lance, Light flew out to strike down ignoarance.
Basically she was adopted as the symbolic patron of whomsoever peoples
(plural in some ways, I'd say) were behind the &quot;Shake-Speare&quot; works. For imo
the grand goal of the Works and many other endeavours beside the literature
were a planned scheme to replace ignorance with wisdom in England and
beyond.

Bacon is one who did write in his own philosophy on how the arts could be
used to influence people, of their long-term cultural importance; and of
course he is generally acknowledged as the father of the modern scientific
method of &quot;test and see if it works - don't just verbally repeat received
wisdom&quot; from which one may argue our modern civilisation is largely born in
terms of its science and technology. Before Bacon, of course, &quot;science&quot;
consisted merely of quoting Plato or Aristotle.

Somewhere I heard that at Cambridge in Bacon's day, they would debate
endlessly upon the subject - for example - of how many teeth has a horse? No
one ever thought to simply go out and count! Hence Bacon's frustration at
the &quot;science&quot; of his day which led to no progress whatsoever, and his great
philosophical works introducing a new practical science.

You got me interested into delving further into that, Alan. From this and
that book here and there I learn that the Nine Muses are all considered to
be aspects of the one Supreme Muse, rather as the seven colours come from
white through a prism. You may not find it in Greek mythology, but it begins
at least as early as the mystics of Elizabethan England.

The &quot;supreme Muse&quot;, as a symbol if you will, can therefore be more tangibly
referred to in terms of Pallas Athena, Mother Mary, the Virgin Queen,
Britannia , etc. The idea is there in The Faerie Queen, Book 1. The gentle,
holy man introduced into English literature there has as his sacred Muse the
&quot;holy Virgin, chiefe of nine&quot;. So does this answer for you? Look to
Elizabethan literature itself. Continuing Faerie Queen: this greatest of all
Muses, chief of nine, is &quot;Gloriana... Queene of Faerie land.&quot;

This goes deep and the correspondences are many. For example in how some
frontispieces of Elizabethan literature play upon correlating Pallas Athena
(sitting or standing with her traditional shield and Spear) with Elizabeth I
herself. We then get correlations between Pallas Athena and Britannia. (Many
of our coins until recently, and the 50 pence piece still, depict Britannia
seated with shield, trident - spear - and helmet. Pallas also famous for her
shield, spear, and helmet. So Britannia is a more modern version of Palas
Athena. Or Pallas Athena is Britannia.)

Whoever were behind the &quot;Shakespeare&quot; and other works of the day, they were
sometimes at pains to create this image of a patron Goddess or Muse of
England / Britain, whether we call her Britannia or Pallas. &quot;Shakespeare&quot;
called her Pallas Athena obviously, hence the many allusions and clues to
spear-shaking, by &quot;Shakespeare&quot;, Jonson and others.

But more - Elizabeth I is included into the symbology. Some frontispiece
depictions appear to play artfully as partly Elizabeth and partly Pallas,
half-human, half-divine. The &quot;Virgin Queen&quot; then had to somehow play the
role! She can't have been at all sorry to have been exonerated so. But
playing a &quot;Virgin Queen&quot; - to whatever extent she willingly went along or
really understood - was not easy for her. And anyone truly believing she was
a virgin is imho foolish, hence the idea that there may have been offspring
is to the point, but that's another story.

If all this is a little too esoteric concerning correlations between Pallas
Athena the Spear Shaker, Britannia, Elizabeth I and the general concept of a
Faery or Virgin Queen, to sum up:

in answer to your question: one place to look for the &quot;tenth Muse&quot; is in
Faery Queen, Book 1. (Which, while attributed to &quot;Spencer&quot; I'd say relates
to the whole &quot;Shakespeare&quot; canon as an early example.) And earlier today I
posted one example that Bacon, in his teens in France, chose a &quot;tenth Muse&quot;
as one to be above all others. The citation I gave could probably be tracked
down closer still to source. Hope that helps, and it helped prod me into
digging further, for which thanks.

Jonson doesn't mention a thing about Pallas. This topic has been done

consult the Google archives, especially the posts written by Terry Ross. Also,

12th century through 1640 can be found here at the Kathman/Ross website:

Can you explain, Kennedy, why there are over 350,000 books, most

Over 90,000 post-graduate theses on the &quot;unlearned&quot; Shakespeare works
were registered with the LOC by 1980--I don't have the latest
figures--and that's only the US tally. I have no idea how many
journal articles have been written on the &quot;unlearned&quot; Shakespeare
works--I would guess into the high hundreds of thousands--possibly over
a million and that's in English alone. Shakespeare has been mined in
hundreds of languages--the Germans were especially adept at
finding philosophies in the plays. I just saw a journal article
on the influence of pre-socratic philosophers in the Shakespeare
works.

So you're wrong, Kennedy. The Shakespeare works only appear
unlearned to Strats because Strats have been culturally inhibited
from reading the plays on any but the most superficial level
to preseve the Strat myth. Religious texts get the same treatment--
scholars are trained to ignore contradictions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;certainly had personal experience of the man and of
&gt;&gt;&gt;the student riots he caused by his autocratic behaviour.
&gt;&gt;&gt;(While he was not enrolled as a student, his private
&gt;&gt;&gt;tutor was a highly respected Cambridge don; Oxford
&gt;&gt;&gt;lived nearby, and almost certainly attended lectures
&gt;&gt;&gt;and mixed with Cambridge students to some extent.

&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no great point to making fun of a man who is
&gt;&gt;&gt;long dead.

&gt;&gt; Right, Paul. One does not mock a person in literature to reveal universal
&gt;&gt;absurdities, but only to get at someone living. I didn't think it possible that
&gt;&gt;there was something about literature that you knew less about than you do about
&gt;&gt; poetry, but comedy may be it.

&gt;Can you give any examples of bitter mockery in
&gt;a play (or in a similar work, such as a TV film)
&gt;against some quite obscure figure (whom the
&gt;playwright had never met) and who died more
&gt;than twenty years before it was written?

"/>

I don't need to, Paul. My knowledge of comedy and the workings of the human
mind tell me it must be so. In any case, I don't have time to hunt for names.
So consider yourself a winner again. If you want to boast about asking someone
to spend a couple of weeks doing research of no value at all except to refute
you--who won't acknowledge the refutation, anyway.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;No . . of course not. Well, can you give me any
&gt;remotely likely scenario? For example, when I
&gt;was at university there was a real bastard of a
&gt;dean, by the name of 'Tierney'. You obviously did
&gt;not know him, and he died over 20 years ago.
&gt;But how about putting him into one YOUR plays?

"/>

I've read about obscure characters and put them in my plays, but I don't think
I've ever used their real names. In an early play, I was quite amused by some
English eccentric who adopted a pre-teen girl and raised her in such a way as to
make her the ideal wife for him. I believe he married her.

Shakespeare, of course, did it with Monarcho, but you refuse to accept that.
And, no, I don't want to go through that debate again.

I'm not sure Shakespeare was referring to the Cambridge Caius, but I just can't
see why he could not have heard about him, thought him funny, and made a
character somewhat based on him--and named him Caius to amuse his Campbridge
friends.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Following Shake-speare's example, it would not
&gt;be a play about a university -- so you would not

&gt;different things. You will slate the man --
&gt;particularly his accent and other personal
&gt;characteristics, just because that's what you
&gt;want to do.

No, Paul, I'd use the things I'd heard about him that seemed comic to me--which
might include his accent.

It seems to me the kind of thing writers of comedy often do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Those scenes of the MWW were clearly

&gt;&gt;&gt;been the Queen's physician.)

&gt;&gt; And no one was allowed to talk about him outside the court.

&gt;The only people who talked about him were
&gt;those who knew him.

"/>

And they only talked about him to each other, right?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But (and you may find
&gt;this strange on your planet) after he retired and

It would not be strange if people stopped talking about him; but it would be
equally unstrange if people didn't continue to talk about him for a long time.
In the Monarcho threads, someone brought up an American West eccentric who was
joked about long after he died. And I just read a little write-up about Diamond
Jim Brady, an American eccentric know for extreme gluttony. I think he died in
1930 or so. A minor but colorful figure thought interesting enough to modern
high school students to write about in an auxiliary text for english
classes--for slow readers, in fact.

I think Elizabeth is raising an interesting point here. If
one is to judge the 'learnedness' of Shakespeare by the number of
learned books and articles written about his works, then Shakespeare
probably was the most learned person ever to take pen (or quill) to
paper.

The thing I wonder about, though, is how many of these learned
theories and analyses were intentionally embedded by Shakespeare into
his works, and how many of them are simply being read into the works
by some very smart people.

It's always been my feeling that if Shakespeare could be
reincarnated today, he would be absolutely flabbergasted by the number
of learned works that have been written about his plays - &quot;This guy

This was not in a letter, in fact, but in a sonnet addressed
to Francis, (undated) which we on HLAS tried translate back
in Nov/Dec 1998. The thread was &quot;Sonnet X&quot;, started by me,
because at that time I suspected that 'La Jessée' might have
been a pseudonym for you-know-who. I know better now!

SONNET (by 'La Jessée')

CE qu'inspiré du Ciel, et plein d'affection,
Je comble si souvent ma bouche et ma poitrine,
Du sacré Nom fameus de ta Royne divine:
Ses valeurs en sont cause, et sa perfection.
Si ce siecle de fer, si mainte Nation
Ingratte á ses honneurs, n'avoit l'ame Aemantine:
Ravis de ce beau Nom qu'aus Graces je destine,
Avec eus nous l'aurions en admiration.
Donc (Baccon) s'il advient que ma Muse l'on vante,
Ce n'est pas qu'elle soit ou diserte, ou scavante:
Bien que vostre Pallas me rende mieus instruit.
C'est pource que mon Lut chante sa gloire sainte,
Ou qu'en ces vers nayfz son image est emprainte:
Ou que ta vertu claire en mon ombre reluit.

I found this poem among the Anthony Bacon papers in the
Lambeth Palace Library archives (MS.653 f.281), where
there is also a longer 'Elegy' by La Jessée, this time
addressed to *Anthony* (MS.661 ff.263-4). I recall with
some guilt that I promised to post it in full once I had
transcribed it, but still have done neither. Sorry Greg!

The first four lines (of 88), however, do have some
relevance to what you are discussing here.

BACCON, fleur des Angloys, et l'honneur des neuf Muses,
Des Muses, et Pallas: qui tristement confuses
Loing de leur cher Parnasse, errent parmy les bois,
Sans guide, sans recours, sans support, et sans voix.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It was a uniquely

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;subject to that very punishment - at Cambridge only, in the university
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What an incredibly stupid remark. You'd only hear about &quot;sizes&quot; at Cambridge if
&gt;&gt;&gt; you were deprived of them?!

&gt;&gt;It's not my remark, and I agree that the author had
&gt;&gt;probably not suffered the penalty (although he may
&gt;&gt;well have done so). However, he would have heard
&gt;&gt;it spoken in context by other students, and noted it
&gt;&gt;for later use.

&gt; My point, which you seem not to see, is that &quot;sizes&quot; would have been used
&gt; in ordinary talk about drinking: Kit: &quot;I used up my sizes for this term in two
&gt; days.&quot; Of course, he'd ONLY make such a remark to a fellow student or an

That is not the use in Lear -- which was

Lear to Regan: &quot;'Tis not in thee to scant my sizes.&quot;

This is a good example of the accurate idiomatic
use of a phrase, where Stratfordians have to claim
that 'it all came from books' (or something equally
idiotic). It's similar to the argument over the use
of legal terms.

Leaning how to use such words and phrases
accurately takes time. You _don't_ pick them

The obvious simple explanation is that the poet
spent time at the university (and in legal studies)

using such terms.

Of course Strats must desperately avoid all normal

Yes, we all have to live. The economic dimension
_must_ be brought into every theory that claims
to explain aspects of human behaviour. It is here
(as everywhere) that Stratfordians so spectacularly
fail. His plays are clearly not aimed as a mass
market; they are not designed to put bums on
seats . . . and, (under the Stratfordian view of his
career) he would have been a hopeless failure in
commercial terms.

Why, for example, spend all that time writing
sonnets? There is no money in them. Most
Oxfordians (following the stupid Strat pattern) are
equally at a loss to explain the 'economic justification'
of the sonnets -- something which HAS to be
explained (or explained away). You will notice that
Baconians and Marlites rarely refer to the sonnets.

Those 'very smart people' are 99.99% frauds.
Often they are slick and clever frauds (Donald
Foster is a good example). What they read in is
invariably whatever is currently fashionable in
contemporary 'thought'. There is a market for
that stuff in academic journals -- and they have
to churn it out to advance their careers. It has

The point is, most of those authors believe William

who don't believe that Shakespeare wrote only for money, but did

I don't think we should swing from one exteme to another. To
suggest that an artist has a financial interest in his art doesn't
mean that that is his **only** interest. As well, he might very well
indulge in an artistic work (such as the sonnets) for mainly artistic
reasons, with very little thought given to financial renumeration.

&gt;&gt; This is the money question. Just how much was Shakespeare
&gt;&gt; deliberately trying to put into his plays, and how much is being read
&gt;&gt; into those plays by some very smart people?

&gt;Those 'very smart people' are 99.99% frauds.
&gt;Often they are slick and clever frauds (Donald

&gt;invariably whatever is currently fashionable in

Hmmmm....as I mentioned, I don't read the stuff very often.

&gt;&gt; I am puzzled why some people have such a hard time with the
&gt;&gt; idea that a writer, or any other artist, might be concerned with

Okay, I don't think money was Shakespeare's sole motivation.
As I said, he may also have been trying to impress the ladies. And
perhaps he was also indulging in art for art's sake. He enjoyed
writing, and he was one of those lucky people who could make a living
doing something he enjoyed.

I'm not following your argument, Paul. Earlier, you seem to
suggest that most of the books and articles that give a 'serious
analysis' to this or that profound aspect of Shakespeare's writings
are frauds. But here you seem to be suggesting that there is some
profound meaning in the works, intentionally placed there by the
author. Which is it?

The records don't back up your theory, Grumman.

The Inns of Court revels account book show two entries

So the playwright who &quot;wrote for money&quot; and who was

None, Bob. The Inns of Court had a rule that no professional
plays could be played at the Inns.

That rule didn't bend until after the English Civil War
when the Renaissance was over and the Inns couldn't
produce good playwrights anymore. Then the revels were
deregulated and privatized and the economy collapsed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (2) Were those who performed the Shakespearean plays paid?

"/>

Yes, but if you're hoping that the Stratford Shakspere
was listed as a player, give up hope. There were no names
of players ever listed, only companies. The Master of the
Revels gave the players a lump sum--usually the whole L5--for
performances and costumes and whatever. Scenery was borrowed.

We have a letter from Francis Bacon to an aristocratic relative
asking to borrow horse and armour for some Gray's Inn revel.
[Grumman is experiencing a chill of fear].

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (3) Is it impossible for a person who writes, IN PART, for money to TWICE allow

"/>

The Inn of Courts rule that no professional playwrights
could be hired covers that contingency, Grumman.

The Inns of Court were the finishing schools for the
student playwights mostly from Cambridge. There was
very serious revels competition between the Inns.

Gray's Inn, the largest Inn, and the one with most of the
Cambridge MA's nearly always won because they had, well,
Shakespeare, and also because Cambridge was famous for
its student Latin plays. If future scholars look very
carefully at Cambridge they will find that a very
young Will Shakespeare did his acting and playwriting
apprenticeship there.

The whole point, Grumman, was to create an opportunity
for the readers at Gray's Inn to practice amateur playwriting.
That's why professional playwrights were banned unless they
were also members of the Inns and that covered only two names
in the revels accounts--Bacon and Chapman.

That's a good analogy, because we all know
games with which we have only a vague
acquaintance. My knowledge of terms used in
baseball and American football comes only from
their application to everyday uses, even if I've
often seen the games played (e.g.in cinema and
TV films). I just have no interest in them, so I
don't make the effort to learn the meanings of the
terms -- or if I do, I quickly forget them. That's
exactly the same for everyone else. A surprising
number of people in France got interested in
soccer in 1998 when the World Cup was being
played in that country, and they leaned the
meanings of (some) soccer terms. But then
most forgot them. Shakespeare would have
been no different from that general pattern. He
learnt various terms, codes and languages, and
he used them in his plays. End of story. So we
know he had a great interest in law, falconry,
music, Italy and so on . . and that he attended
Cambridge.

You can invent crap about him having a special
gift that enabled him to remember and use terms
from books or the like. The argument is no
different from the standard Strat story of 'the magic
pen'. Any theory you need is pulled down from
the sky, as if it was all magic.

I suppose that's how it has to be for you. Stone-
age peoples have no other way of explaining
things they don't understand, such as airplanes,
TV, or other aspects of modern technology
Likewise, you can only conceive of the wonderful
faculties of the Stratman as manifestations of
magical powers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;The Inns of Court revels account book show two entries

&gt;&gt; (1) How many records of the Inns of Court revels indicate a payment to a
&gt;&gt; playwright?

&gt;None, Bob. The Inns of Court had a rule that no professional
&gt;plays could be played at the Inns.

"/>

Your evidence for this? I would also like to know if the plays by Shakespeare
were the only plays performed at the Inns that also were performed at public
theatres.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That rule didn't bend until after the English Civil War
&gt;when the Renaissance was over and the Inns couldn't
&gt;produce good playwrights anymore. Then the revels were
&gt;deregulated and privatized and the economy collapsed.

&gt;&gt; (2) Were those who performed the Shakespearean plays paid?
&gt;Yes, but if you're hoping that the Stratford Shakspere
&gt;was listed as a player, give up hope.

"/>

No, I assumed that his company put on the plays and was rewarded for them, and
that he therefore benefitted financially from their performance, the same way he
benefitted financially from the production of all his plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;We have a letter from Francis Bacon to an aristocratic relative
&gt;asking to borrow horse and armour for some Gray's Inn revel.
&gt;[Grumman is experiencing a chill of fear].

"/>

Not really. In fact, I've been reading a book called FRANCIS BACON, PHILOSOPHER
OF INDUSTRIAL SCIENCE, by Benjamin Farrington, which pretty convincingly shows
how unlikely it was that Bacon wrote any plays. For instance, he is documented
as having written ADDRESSES for the Revels at Gray's Inn in 1594, and they seem
to have been explicitly philosophical, one of them sketching his eideas for
improving the realm such as setting up libraries and museums. Odd that nowhere
in the Shakespearean plays does a ruler discuss this sort of thing (that I know
of). Bacon writes about it all the time. Odd, too, that Bacon can be recorded
as writing orations but not plays for the Inns.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;(3) Is it impossible for a person who writes, IN PART, for money to TWICE allow
&gt;&gt;a play of his to be performed gratis (especially as it might help to publicize
&gt;&gt; it)?

&gt;The Inn of Courts rule that no professional playwrights
&gt;could be hired covers that contingency, Grumman.

"/>

So you say, but you rarely get your facts right. I think what happened was that
Shakespeare did not write for the Inns; rather, his company was asked to perform
plays for the Inns, and performed his. Also, whoever wrote the Shakespearean
plays, he had written material that appeared on the public stage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The Inns of Court were the finishing schools for the
&gt;student playwights mostly from Cambridge. There was
&gt;very serious revels competition between the Inns.

&gt;Gray's Inn, the largest Inn, and the one with most of the
&gt;Cambridge MA's nearly always won because they had, well,
&gt;Shakespeare, and also because Cambridge was famous for
&gt;its student Latin plays. If future scholars look very
&gt;carefully at Cambridge they will find that a very
&gt;young Will Shakespeare did his acting and playwriting
&gt;apprenticeship there.

"/>

Not likely, since there is no factual evidence suggesting that he did.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The whole point, Grumman, was to create an opportunity
&gt;for the readers at Gray's Inn to practice amateur playwriting.

No, the point was to have entertainments. Something Farrington gives little
hint that Bacon cared about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That's why professional playwrights were banned unless they

&gt;&gt; --Bob G.

&gt;What, this?

&gt; So the playwright who &quot;wrote for money&quot; and who was
&gt; willing to sue for a shilling, and who would starve
&gt; the poor of Stratford to make an extra quid would refuse
&gt; to accept money for the plays he wrote for the Inns of
&gt; Court?

&gt; That's not very Shakespearean of him.

I figure most of these people are quite sincere in their

&gt;&gt;&gt;commercial terms.

&gt;&gt; Upon what information do you base this claim?

"/>

On the face of it, this is an interesting point. I'm
certainly not aware of any attendance figures for Shakespeare's plays.
Yet we have Francis Mere's testimony that Shakespeare was regarded as
the best playwright for comedy and drama. Clearly he was popular with
some people.

Elizabeth Weir initially seemed to suggest (I think) that given the
number of learned essays, articles and books written by some highly
educated people about the works, the works themselves must have been
written by some equally highly educated person. (If that was not
Elizabeth's point, I apologize.) I questioned this premise,
suggesting that much of the profundity being found in the plays was in
fact being read into the plays by some smart people. I questioned
whether Shakespeare deliberately placed these profound theories in the
plays. You seem to agree. At least, earlier above you point out that

&quot;Anyone can write 'scholarly' papers on navel-scratching or

them. So what is your point?

&gt;&gt; No, Paul, because I do not list things like that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's one thing to work up a

&gt;&gt;&gt;Nonsense. People see many more trials

&gt;&gt;&gt;e.g. Judge Judy, or the O.J. Simpson trials,
&gt;&gt;&gt;or all the trial scenes in TV soaps. Their
&gt;&gt;&gt;knowledge of legal terms is as weak as ever.

&gt;&gt;I wouldn't know since I'm not much of a legal buff. But I do know that people
&gt;&gt; that follow sports pick up an incredible amount of specialized terminology,
&gt;&gt;accurately. Such terminology is just as opaque to the uninitiated as legalese,
&gt;&gt; but often used automatically by writers.

&gt;That's a good analogy, because we all know
&gt;games with which we have only a vague
&gt;acquaintance. My knowledge of terms used in
&gt;baseball and American football comes only from
&gt;their application to everyday uses, even if I've
&gt;often seen the games played (e.g.in cinema and
&gt;TV films). I just have no interest in them, so I
&gt;don't make the effort to learn the meanings of the
&gt;terms -- or if I do, I quickly forget them. That's
&gt;exactly the same for everyone else. A surprising
&gt;number of people in France got interested in
&gt;soccer in 1998 when the World Cup was being
&gt;played in that country, and they leaned the
&gt;meanings of (some) soccer terms. But then
&gt;most forgot them. Shakespeare would have
&gt;been no different from that general pattern. He
&gt;learnt various terms, codes and languages, and
&gt;he used them in his plays. End of story. So we
&gt;know he had a great interest in law, falconry,
&gt;music, Italy and so on . . and that he attended
&gt;Cambridge.
&gt;You can invent crap about him having a special
&gt;gift that enabled him to remember and use terms
&gt;from books or the like. The argument is no
&gt;different from the standard Strat story of 'the magic
&gt;pen'. Any theory you need is pulled down from

What in the world is magical about getting interested in a subject and reading
about it, and talking about it with friends, enough to pick up its jargon? I
feel I've done it with many subjects--aside from the ones I studied (belatedly)
in college. Why couldn't Shakespeare have done the same?

And that's it for me, once again, on this subject. The only way properly to
consider it is to get a list of all the passages in Shakespeare that indicate to
wacks that Shakespeare had dome kind of specialized knowledge that the man from
Stratford could not have had, and analyze it. When you do that, you find things
like a line or two about how blue Italian skies are, something no one who hadn't
been to Italy (according to Ogburn) could have known about.

&gt;&gt;&gt;that stuff in academic journals -- and they have
&gt;&gt;&gt;to churn it out to advance their careers. It has
&gt;&gt;&gt;no other meaning. No one ever reads the stuff.

&gt;&gt; Hmmmm....as I mentioned, I don't read the stuff very often.
&gt;&gt; And I gather from your remarks that you don't either. But I don't
&gt;&gt; think that entitles either one of us to conclude that **nobody** reads
&gt;&gt; the stuff.

&gt;If it had any value or meaning wouldn't it be
&gt;referred to from time to time? When did you
&gt;last see a reference in this NG to a paper in a
&gt;learned journal? Amid the tens of thousands
&gt;that are published every year, only a tiny number
&gt;are readable, or are ever quoted.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Shake-
&gt;&gt;&gt;speare all had to earn a living. But it is utterly
&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong to suggest that:
&gt;&gt;&gt; (a) money was their sole motivation,

&gt;&gt; Okay, I don't think money was Shakespeare's sole motivation.

&gt;Gosh, that's big of you!

&gt;&gt; As I said, he may also have been trying to impress the ladies. And
&gt;&gt; perhaps he was also indulging in art for art's sake.

&gt;Only 'perhaps'? Do you say the same about
&gt;Michelangelo, Da Vinci, and all other great
&gt;artists?

&gt;&gt; He enjoyed
&gt;&gt; writing, and he was one of those lucky people who could make a living
&gt;&gt; doing something he enjoyed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (b) they made it from a mass market,

&gt;&gt; I've always been under the impression that Shakespeare's plays
&gt;&gt; were written and performed for the mass Elizabethan market.

&gt;You are completely wrong. Next time you
&gt;see or read a play, ask yourself how it
&gt;would go down with an average illiterate
&gt;Elizabethan Joe.

&gt;&gt;&gt; (c) they did not know what they were doing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;How come Strats are so ready to assert all
&gt;&gt;&gt;three propositions in respect of their man,
&gt;&gt;&gt;when they would never dream of saying that
&gt;&gt;&gt;sort of thing about any other great artist?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Isn't that enough to tell them that they have
&gt;&gt;&gt;slipped up somewhere along the line?

&gt;&gt; I'm not following your argument, Paul. Earlier, you seem to
&gt;&gt; suggest that most of the books and articles that give a 'serious
&gt;&gt; analysis' to this or that profound aspect of Shakespeare's writings
&gt;&gt; are frauds.

&gt;I suggested no such thing. Strat academics
&gt;ARE frauds. They pretend to present 'profound'
&gt;analyses etc., -- but it is all (or virtually all) empty
&gt;meaningless verbiage.

&gt;&gt; But here you seem to be suggesting that there is some
&gt;&gt; profound meaning in the works, intentionally placed there by the
&gt;&gt; author. Which is it?

&gt;The author knew exactly what he was
&gt;doing -- in the same way as Michelangelo,
&gt;and Da Vinci did, and as all other great
&gt;artists necessarily do.

Bacon's imprisonment for debt in 1693 is a story that
begins with his republican speech in Parliament the same
year that changed the course of constitutional history
by transferring the power of the purse from the Crown
to Parliament.

Elizabeth was not a republican and punished Bacon
by cutting of his money while at the same time commanding
him to stay at Court. She eventually gave him a salary
but entailed it until 1609. Bacon was by no means
the only victim of Elizabeth's favorite maxium about
&quot;starving unruly horses.&quot;

He got a play out of it when his loving brother Antonio,

The Baconians have documented evidence that Bacon was in the

Did Bacon's speech really initiate the transfer of the power

&quot;I have here an idle pen or two.... I pray send me somewhat else for them to
write out.... From my Lodge at Twickenham Park,
Your entire Loving Brother,
Francis Bacon&quot;, in a letter dated January 25, 1594, he wrote to Anthony
Bacon.

The &quot;idle pens&quot; are referred to here also as &quot;them&quot;, who would work
consequetively to &quot;write out&quot;. They were Bacon's i.e. he was the head or
core of these &quot;pens&quot;. If Bacon himself found one of his &quot;pens&quot; had finished
a project, he did not of course have to write a letter to himself about
finding them the next thing to do. Why, in the letter above, he was saying
this to his brother is unclear (to me) except for the fact that it obviously
includes Anthony within the network.

&gt; suggesting that much of the profundity being found in the plays was in

&gt; whether Shakespeare deliberately placed these profound theories in the

Shakespeare did, of course, deliberately put

The academic twats might as well be writing on
nose-picking as on Shakespeare -- for all that
they understand of him. (Haven't you ever seen
any of that garbage? Sign up to the SHAKSPER
list to get a broad sense.)

Shakespeare is great -- and has long been
recognised as such. But Strats have got him
utterly wrong. In a largely separate development
hideous academe evolved, and part of it devotes
its time to 'analysis' of its conception of Shake-
speare. So we get enormous piles of crap.
Given the nature of academe, even IF it had
Shakespeare right, it would still produce a lot
of crap. But getting him wrong results in much
greater quantities of crap -- greater by several
orders of magnitude.

If you had time, I'd be interested still, Elizabeth, if you had more in mind
that the below in writing of a scriptorium. Nevertheless...

Thinking about it, without even looking deeply, the following are examples
of how his contemporaries - even the great writers of the day - looked up to
him, it seems. And these are just a few of the indications that he was
considered the centre of a &quot;choir&quot; of authors...

Ben Jonson, in Ode for Lord Bacon's Birthday (1621) , publ. in Underwood,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
No.51, wrote:

"/>

Hail, happy Genius of this ancient pile!
How comes it all things so about thee smile?
The fire, the wine, the men! and in the midst,
Thou stand'st as if some Mystery thou did'st!

Here we have Bacon &quot;in the midst&quot; as a &quot;Genius&quot; - this even written of him
by none less than Jonson - and.......&quot;as if some Mystery thou did'st!&quot; Say
no more, squire.

John Williams, in Manes Verulamiani (1626), Elegy 12, upon Bacon's death,
wrote:

&quot;Is it thus falls the rarest glory of the Aonian band? and do we decree to
entrust seed to the Aonian fields? Break pens, tear up writings, if the dire
goddesses may justly act so. Alas! what a tongue is mute! what eloquence
ceases! Whither have departed the nectar and ambrosia of your genius? How is
it happened to us, the disciples of the Muses, that Apollo, the leader of
our choir, should die?&quot;

Nowadays he is known for his philosophical writings. But what is this that
he was the leader of disciples of the Muses, the &quot;Apollo&quot; and leader of the
others, the &quot;choir&quot;? Why, according to conventional wisdom, would Bacon have
been considered the leader of such disciples of the Muses? Would not
Shakespeare have been considered so? Who else but the author of the Works
would have been considered such a figure?

In the same document, in another elegy upon Bacon's death, an anonymous
writer also says: &quot;Ah, the tenth Muse and glory of the choir has perished.
Ah, never before has Apollo himself been truly unhappy!&quot; Again, Bacon as the
tenth Muse - and glory of the choir. A philosoher and statesman alone would
hardly be considered so. Surely these are words befitting only the author of
the Works? (There's also the reference, again, to the &quot;tenth Muse&quot;, a
reference in those times to Pallas Athena, the Spear Shaker.)

Interested in continuing Elizabeth's thought that B had a &quot;scriptorium&quot;, I'm
restricting myself only to references that come to mind wherein Bacon is
considered a form of leader or chief of other writers - even writers of the
stature of Ben Jonson, his friend. I'm omitting here all other references,
numerous as they are, to B as a concealed poet. And will close with one
further quote from Jonson. Jonson knew both Shakespeare and Bacon. Did he
write *thusly* and so overwhelmingly of the man of Stratford? Never. Hear
the heart of the song within these words, wherein we also seem to catch a
glimpse of disciples listening around him, around the table, in wrapt
attention upon his every word:

&quot;Yet there happened in my time one noble speaker who was full of gravity in
his speaking; his language, where he could spare or pass by a jest, was
nobly censorious. No man ever spake more neatly, more pressly, more
weightily, or suffered less emptiness, less idleness, in what he uttered. No
member of his speech but consisted of his own graces. His hearers could not
cough or look aside from him without loss. He commanded where he spoke, and
had his judges angry or pleased at his devotion. No man had their affections
more in his power. The fear of every man that heard him was lest he should
make an end.

&quot;But the learned and able (though unfortunate) successor [Bacon] is he who
hath filled up all numbers, and performed that in our tongue which may be
compared or preferred either to insolent Greece, or haughty Rome. In short,
within his view, and about his times, were all the wits born that could
honour a language, or help study. Now things daily fall: wits grow downward,
and Eloquence grows backward. So that he may be named and stand as the mark
and acme of our language.

&quot;My conceit of his Person was never increased toward him by his place or
honours. But I have and do reverence him for the greatness that was only
proper to himself, in that he seemed to me ever, by his work, one of the
greatest men and most worthy of admiration that had been in many ages. In
his adversity I ever prayed that God would give him strength: for greatness
he could not want. Neither could I condole in a word or syllable for him, as
knowing no accident could do harm to virtue, but rather help to make it
manifest.&quot;

Ben Jonson, Discoveries (1641), p 102.

So that was Jonson, writing of one who he considered &quot;the mark and acme of
our language.&quot; Who else could be such other than &quot;Shakespeare&quot;?
Realistically, surely Jonson should have written, that Bacon was &quot;second
only to Will Shakespeare&quot; or some such. But of S not a mention.

In support of the concept of &quot;one amid a choir&quot;, a leader, we also read
above from Jonson that &quot;within his view, and about his times, were all the
wits born that could honour a language, or help study&quot;. Not necessarily
accurately, for great writing continued, but at the thought of Bacon's
demise (not Shaksper's), Jonson writes: &quot;Now things daily fall: wits grow
downward, and Eloquence grows backward.&quot; - meaning, without a doubt, after
Bacon.

Such things can be viewed variously, through variously tinted spectacles of
one's own character and inclination, of course. But I fancy here that I read
the words of a disciple in memory of a Master.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point is, most of those authors believe William
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the works. So there are many 'Strats'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; who don't believe that Shakespeare wrote only for money, but did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indeed have something profound to say.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That does not follow. Anyone can write 'scholarly'
&gt;&gt;&gt;papers on navel-scratching or nose-picking -- IF
&gt;&gt;&gt;they get paid to do so. All Strats are being paid
&gt;&gt;&gt;-- or are engaged in some career move where
&gt;&gt;&gt;earning money is the game plan.

&gt;&gt; I figure most of these people are quite sincere in their
&gt;&gt; writings and findings.

&gt;'Sincere'? The word has no application here.
&gt;Would you apply it to the army of academics
&gt;and officials in the Soviet Union producing vast
&gt;libraries of Marxist-Leninist books and journals
&gt;on every topic you can imagine (and on many
&gt;more that you can't) . .?

"/>

'Sincere', in the sense that they honestly believed in what
they are writing? Yes, I think that some of those academics and
officials actually believed their own theories.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; They may have accompanying motives for
&gt;&gt; publishing, whether it be money, reputation, or just the kick of
&gt;&gt; having their name in print. And I think Shakespeare had similiar
&gt;&gt; mixed motives in writing his works.

&gt;Shakespeare works should not be compared
&gt;with those vast libraries of meaningless
&gt;Marxist-Leninist junk.

"/>

Since no-one, and certainly not me, has compared Shakespeare's
works to Marxist-Leninist libraries, I'm uncertain why you're saying
this, but I'll agree anyways. Nor should Shakespeare's works be
compared to a bag of week old potatoes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And the vast libraries
&gt;of Stratfordian junk written on his works have
&gt;about the same value . . and about the same
&gt;relevance to the works

"/>

I wonder what the Marxist-Leninist line on Shakespeare was?
They must have had an opinion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;Read the first speech of 30 or more lines in
&gt;&gt;&gt;any of the canonical plays -- post it here and
&gt;&gt;&gt;show how it would appeal to groundlings.

&gt;&gt; Are we agreed that the playhouses were quite popular with all
&gt;&gt; sorts of people in the Elizabethan age?

&gt;Yes. And they competed with the bear pits.

&gt;&gt; If so, and if you don't
&gt;&gt; believe that Shakespeare's plays were popular amongst the general
&gt;&gt; population, then whose plays do you think were popular?

&gt;Maybe you can some guidance on this from
&gt;the records of Henslowe and Alleyn (which
&gt;are remarkably free of references to Shake-
&gt;speare).

"/>

As I recall, Shakespeare didn't write for Henslowe during the
time covered by the records we have. Or something like that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;But do you know the names of the
&gt;writers of popular TV shows?

"/>

No. What does this have to do with anything we're discussing
here?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;How can I prove an absence? There is almost
&gt;&gt;&gt;no evidence to show that they were commercial
&gt;&gt;&gt;successes.

&gt;&gt; On the face of it, this is an interesting point. I'm
&gt;&gt; certainly not aware of any attendance figures for Shakespeare's plays.
&gt;&gt; Yet we have Francis Mere's testimony that Shakespeare was regarded as
&gt;&gt; the best playwright for comedy and drama. Clearly he was popular with
&gt;&gt; some people.

&gt;He certainly became a success with the
&gt;critics; we can take Meres as the first of them.
&gt;That does not mean that he made money, nor
&gt;even that his plays were performed on the
&gt;public stage -- other than a few and those
&gt;rarely.

"/>

As I said, this is an interesting point. But then how can we
establish that **any** Elizabethan playwright made money, or that his
plays were performed on the public stage, given the scarcity of
records from the time? You know, Paul, if you're going to raise
questions like this, we're going to have to get someone who knows what
they're talking about into this discussion. And then where will we
be?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think we should swing from one exteme to another. To
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; suggest that an artist has a financial interest in his art doesn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mean that that is his **only** interest. As well, he might very well
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; indulge in an artistic work (such as the sonnets) for mainly artistic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons, with very little thought given to financial renumeration.

&gt;&gt;&gt;An artist _might_. But you are clearly not aware
&gt;&gt;&gt;of the enormity of the effort that the poet put into
&gt;&gt;&gt;most of the sonnets. They are incredibly dense
&gt;&gt;&gt;complex enterprises. Your argument is rather
&gt;&gt;&gt;like saying that Michelangelo might have painted
&gt;&gt;&gt;the roof of the Sistine Chapel for free. It would be
&gt;&gt;&gt;nonsensical. You cannot exclude the financial
&gt;&gt;&gt;aspect as though it did not exist. The man had
&gt;&gt;&gt;to live. He could not have put in that much work
&gt;&gt;&gt;without recompense.

&gt;&gt; Okay. But aren't you the one who squawks every time someone
&gt;&gt; brings up the idea that Shakespeare might have had a financial
&gt;&gt; interest in his work? I'm getting confused here.

&gt;I squawk at Strats who speak of Shakespeare
&gt;in terms they would never dream of using
&gt;when referring to other great artists.

"/>

What terms are those?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmmmm....as I mentioned, I don't read the stuff very often.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And I gather from your remarks that you don't either. But I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think that entitles either one of us to conclude that **nobody** reads
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the stuff.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If it had any value or meaning wouldn't it be
&gt;&gt;&gt;referred to from time to time? When did you
&gt;&gt;&gt;last see a reference in this NG to a paper in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;learned journal? Amid the tens of thousands
&gt;&gt;&gt;that are published every year, only a tiny number
&gt;&gt;&gt;are readable, or are ever quoted.

&gt;&gt; Hmmmm...perhaps that says more about this newsgroup than it
&gt;&gt; says about the various papers or learned journals?

&gt;Nope. No one refers to those papers --
&gt;ever. They are unreadable junk.

"/>

Classic Crowley. Paul, you may not read those papers. I may
not read those papers (and I admit that I've seen more than a few
books and articles that I considered pretentious nonsense). But does
that mean that **no one** reads those papers? Does it ever occur to
you that your disinterest in those papers and journals is more of a
reflection of your own intellectual limitations (and mine, for that
matter) than that they are &quot;unreadable junk&quot;?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As I said, he may also have been trying to impress the ladies. And
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps he was also indulging in art for art's sake.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Only 'perhaps'? Do you say the same about
&gt;&gt;&gt;Michelangelo, Da Vinci, and all other great
&gt;&gt;&gt;artists?

&gt;&gt; Fair enough. Shakespeare had a strong artistic interest in
&gt;&gt; his works.

&gt;That's a ridiculous thing to say. You would
&gt;never say that sort of thing about Michelangelo.

Sure I would. Michelangelo had a strong artistic interest in

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Give me the first 30+ line speech from a play that you think
did please them, and let's see how it compares to Shakespeare's plays.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But here you seem to be suggesting that there is some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; profound meaning in the works, intentionally placed there by the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; author. Which is it?

&gt;&gt;&gt;The author knew exactly what he was
&gt;&gt;&gt;doing -- in the same way as Michelangelo,
&gt;&gt;&gt;and Da Vinci did, and as all other great
&gt;&gt;&gt;artists necessarily do.

&gt;&gt; I'm not sure if we're any further ahead than when we started.
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Weir initially seemed to suggest (I think) that given the
&gt;&gt; number of learned essays, articles and books written by some highly
&gt;&gt; educated people about the works, the works themselves must have been
&gt;&gt; written by some equally highly educated person. (If that was not
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth's point, I apologize.) I questioned this premise,
&gt;&gt; suggesting that much of the profundity being found in the plays was in
&gt;&gt; fact being read into the plays by some smart people. I questioned
&gt;&gt; whether Shakespeare deliberately placed these profound theories in the
&gt;&gt; plays. You seem to agree. At least, earlier above you point out that

&gt;Shakespeare did, of course, deliberately put
&gt;profound issues into the plays. We all know
&gt;that. What the academic twats write has no
&gt;bearing on anything -- whatever Elizabeth Weir
&gt;or anyone might say.

"/>

This is the crux of the original post. Just how much did
Shakespeare put into his works, and how much is simply being read into
the plays by clever people? I'm of the opinion that too much is being
read into the plays. But perhaps I'm wrong, and perhaps I'm seriously
underestimating Shakespeare and his intentions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&quot;Anyone can write 'scholarly' papers on navel-scratching or

&gt;The academic twats might as well be writing on
&gt;nose-picking as on Shakespeare -- for all that
&gt;they understand of him. (Haven't you ever seen
&gt;any of that garbage? Sign up to the SHAKSPER

&gt;Shakespeare is great -- and has long been

Here, from memory alone, are a few things that DO, for me, tell us that
Shakespeare's plays were performed on the public stage, and made money.

(1) Greene expressed jealosy of Shakespeare the playwright, and Greene was a
professional writer of plays for the public stage.

(2) Some of the title-pages of published plays indicate that they were performed
on the public stage.

(3) That they were published suggests they were being performed, and were
well-received.

(4) They were performed by the Chamberlain's/King's Men, a company of players
who performed a great deal on the public stage; if these men had the plays of
Shakespeare in their possession, why would they not have performed them on the
public stage?

(5) We have the testimony of play-goers of the day who attended Shakespearean
plays--e.g., those who were at the Globe during the Henry VIII performance that
caused the Globe to burn down.

(6) Nash wrote somewhere about the popularity of a Henry VI play by Shakespeare.

(7) Shakespeare's company was at least twice recorded as being asked to perform
a play, and their answers indicate that they considered the plays they performed
as a result just plays in the repertory--i.e., plays to be performed for the
public.

(8) We have no records of any Shakespearean play that was privately performed.

(9) The Parnassus plays mention Shakespeare as a play-writing rival of Ben
Jonson's, and Jonson wrote for the public stage.

I'm sure there is better evidence that Shakespeare wrote for the public stage
than the above. I hope someone with more time than I have can correct and add
to my list.

We don't have detailed records telling us how often
Shakespeare's plays were performed in public. Agreed. (However, as
was mentioned earlier, we know that he attracted the attention of
several critics who acclaimed his work, and that his plays were chosen
to be presented at Court during the Christmas season. And, of course,
his co-workers saw fit to preserve his work in the First Folio.)

No, because the answer is quite obvious. While there is some
disagreement over who wrote the works of Shakespeare, there is no
comparable debate (I don't think) over who created the works of
Michelangelo. If there were such a debate, then we would have to
state the obvious about Michelangelo, as we do about Shakespeare in
our discussions in this newsgroup.

That's an interesting, albeit unsubstantiated, point, Paul.
It is possible that the aforementioned drek that was produced for the
lowest common denominator went by the waysides shortly after it was
produced. Thus we have no record of it. The limited number of plays
we do have from the Elizabethan age represent the cream of the crop,
the ones people saw fit to preserve through publishing.

But I'm still not sure where you're going with this.

That's (i) not true; and (ii) a cop-out. Your
expression of opinion had nothing to do with
any authorship matter. And the notions that he
wrote (a) only for money; (b) for a mass-market
(c) without any conception of an overall purpose
and without any artistic intention . . . . . are all
standard parts of the Stratfordian ideology.
They form a fully integrated whole and are
entirely recognisable.

What would the mass-market want with ART?
Why write for such a market unless money is
the sole purpose? How could he have any
supervening purposes if he was churning out
yet another product to get bums on seats?

The Stratfordian conception of the man, his life
and his work is wholly at odds with everything
we see in the plays and the poems.

Why can't you admit it?

The only explanation then available to Strats for
the remarkable quality of the works (in the limited
way in which you understand them) is . . . err . . .
um . . . . err . . . . his magic pen!

There doesn't seem to be any record of a professional acting company of the time
that had plays for court performances only, or primarily. It makes no sense.
Consider that the printed plays advertise their having been performed at court;
why wouldn't the same plays be performed for the public because they had been
performed at court? That is, if a play was successful at court, why wouldn't
the players take advantage of the snob appeal of a play that had done well at
court and put it on the public stage?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;(8) We have no records of any Shakespearean play that was privately performed.

&gt;What are you talking about? 38 separate performances

I meant records of plays that were known to have been performed only at court.
We DO have records of some plays that were both publically performed and
performed at court, which suggests that the plays were like other plays in being
written for the public stage--but take to court if requested. (The statistics
here don't mean much, by the way, since court performances were generally
recorded, public performances not.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I'll await the opinion of someone more trustworthy, Paul. Meanwhile, I
remembered another record supporting my case: a preface to Troilus and Cressida
makes a point of saying that IT was NOT &quot;clapper-clawed&quot; by the general public,

&gt;&gt; I'm still not sure what your point is. In fact, I've lost
&gt;&gt; track of what this thread is all about.

&gt;This sub-thread started with me 'squawking'
&gt;at some expression by you of Stratfordian
&gt;nonsense (i.e Stratfordian orthodoxy).
&gt;And it's still on that. You originally wrote:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It's always been my feeling that if Shakespeare could be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reincarnated today, he would be absolutely flabbergasted by the number
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of learned works that have been written about his plays - &quot;This guy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; says I wrote this play to depict the existential dilemma of man!
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hell, I was just trying to pay my bar bill at the Mermaid!&quot;

"/>

So you agree, then, with those many 'Strat' commentators who
read all sorts of different profundities into Shakespeare's works?
Fair enough. As I said, I suspect there is a lot that is being read
into the plays that was never intended by the author. But I may be
mistaken.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;[..]
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That's a ridiculous thing to say. You would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;never say that sort of thing about Michelangelo.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The art goes to the core of the work. It has no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;sense without it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sure I would. Michelangelo had a strong artistic interest in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his works. There!

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes -- and doesn't it look stupid? No one
&gt;&gt;&gt;with an interest in art would ever say it --
&gt;&gt;&gt;and certainly not to a friend who shared that
&gt;&gt;&gt;interest. So how come it seems reasonable
&gt;&gt;&gt;to say the same about Shakespeare?
&gt;&gt;&gt;Do I have to tell you?
&gt;[..]

&gt;&gt; No, because the answer is quite obvious. While there is some
&gt;&gt; disagreement over who wrote the works of Shakespeare, there is no
&gt;&gt; comparable debate (I don't think) over who created the works of
&gt;&gt; Michelangelo. If there were such a debate, then we would have to
&gt;&gt; state the obvious about Michelangelo, as we do about Shakespeare in
&gt;&gt; our discussions in this newsgroup.

&gt;That's (i) not true; and (ii) a cop-out. Your
&gt;expression of opinion had nothing to do with
&gt;any authorship matter. And the notions that he
&gt;wrote (a) only for money; (b) for a mass-market
&gt;(c) without any conception of an overall purpose
&gt;and without any artistic intention . . . . . are all
&gt;standard parts of the Stratfordian ideology.
&gt;They form a fully integrated whole and are
&gt;entirely recognisable.

"/>

Actually, I think that a lot of 'Strats' would agree with you
that Shakespeare did have a &quot;conception of an overall purpose&quot; and
that he did have some very definite artistic intentions. However,
what that overall purpose and artistic intention was, I suspect,
varies from analyst to analyst. Which leads me to conclude that at
least some of these analysts, clever as they are, are reading things
into the works that aren't there. And it opens the possibility that
they all are. (BTW: I must admit, given my limited readings on the
'interpretations' of Shakespeare, that I'm actually in over my head on
discussing this topic of interpretations of Shakespeare's aims. My
observation is based simply on a casual glancing at the varied books
on Shakespeare available at any decent library.)

And while I overstated the matter in the above quote, I
definitely believe that writing for money was one of Shakespeare's
concerns, as it would be a concern for any other Elizabethan
playwright.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;What would the mass-market want with ART?
&gt;Why write for such a market unless money is
&gt;the sole purpose? How could he have any
&gt;supervening purposes if he was churning out
&gt;yet another product to get bums on seats?

&gt;The Stratfordian conception of the man, his life
&gt;and his work is wholly at odds with everything
&gt;we see in the plays and the poems.

&gt;Why can't you admit it?

&gt;The only explanation then available to Strats for
&gt;the remarkable quality of the works (in the limited
&gt;way in which you understand them) is . . . err . . .
&gt;um . . . . err . . . . his magic pen!

Hmmm....I suppose I'm just going to have to wait for your book
on what Shakespeare is really all about, Paul. I'll look for it in
the library next to all the other books about what Shakespeare is
really all about.

Read what I wrote -- 'court and private performances'.
Blackfriars might later have taken over much of
that work, but there can be no doubt that (of any
potential theatre-going audience) the aristocracy
had much more money and paid much better.
They would generally not have wanted to mix
with the lower orders at the Globe and the like.
The Queen would never have gone there (pace
'Shakespeare in Love').

'Snob appeal' does not make much sense to
me here. I bet that there is little evidence to
support it. It tends to be a 'respectable' female
middle-class thing, and I doubt if many who
attended the Globe were either female or
middle-class, or thought of themselves as
'respectable'.

You fail (as ever) to see the importance of the
class divide. The 'vulgarity' of the theatre is
known to have dismayed the middle-classes.
Upper-classes were not usually bothered by
'honest vulgarity' and found the middle-class
dismay amusing but, at the same time, they
had a reputation to maintain and preferred to
enjoy the theatre away from disapproving
middle-class eyes.

It _might_ suggest that -- until you read them,
(and study the politics of the era) when the
suggestion has to be reversed --they were
written for court (and private performances)
and were played on the public stage only on
occasion -- and by permission. You can hear
that in the tone of the Queen when in 1601
she complained about *Richad II*: &quot;this
tragedy was played forty times in open streets
and houses&quot;.

She knew exactly how many times it had been
played to the public, and she was not too
happy about any of them. She regretted giving
permission (tacit or otherwise) for those
performances. We can be certain that it was
not played in public again before she died.

I do _not_ say that you are wrong here.
Why are you being so dense -- or finding
it so hard to see my point? I've agreed
with you on this several times. Let's try
to go through it once again.

Strats have not a clue as to the meaning of
any of the plays or poems. (What else is to
be expected when you've got wrong the
author, the audience, the circumstances and
date of composition and the whole context?)
However, everyone can sense that the works
are great, and there is a story to be told
about them, so there is a market for books
claiming to explain them. But every one
produced is fraudulent. As you say, their
authors put out absurd sets of theories,
reading in all kinds of nonsense.

Surely that is all self-evident? Yet both of
you pretend to believe that Strats have got
the basics right. So how do _you_ account
for the rakes of nonsense splurged out
upon the innocent public?

No other great writer generates a small
fraction of the critical nonsense we see
written about Shakespeare.

Why is that?

Most books about Shakespeare contain no nonsense, only reasonable
guesses that you consider nonsense because you don't think Shakespeare
was Shakespeare. But we were talking about scholarly papers, and many
of them teem with what you and I would both call nonsense. This,
however, is true of all such papers about all such writers. I'm not
going to support this statement with a list, but can you doubt that
the many papers that apply a kind pf psychology to various writers
that you consider idiotic, as do I, are not nonsensical. All the
Freudian interpretations that were in vogue for such a long time, and
applied to just about any writer you could name, for example. If you
did any kind of in-depth study of any writer beside Shakespeare, you
would find many papers, and even
books, about your author that you would consider nonsense. More
nonsense is written about Shakespeare than about any other writer
simply because more is written about him than is written about any
other writer.

I generally find out something. But sometimes not much. Another
factor is, of course, that Shakespeare lived earlier than most writers
much written about. So we have less hard data about him.

You'r problem is merely that you want to find a scholar who agrees
with you, and you can't.

&gt;&gt;Actually, I think most of the thousands of books and articles
&gt;&gt;that Elizabeth mentioned in her post were actually written by
&gt;&gt;'Strats'.

&gt; Most are written by academics or students, and
&gt; are quite unreadable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;We know that theatres existed, and roughly
&gt;&gt;&gt;how much was spent on them. We know
&gt;&gt;&gt;that a lot of people (such as Alleyn) made
&gt;&gt;&gt;good money from them. However none of
&gt;&gt;&gt;that tells us how often Shakespeare's plays
&gt;&gt;&gt;were performed in public.

&gt;&gt;Here, from memory alone, are a few things that DO, for me, tell us that
&gt;&gt;Shakespeare's plays were performed on the public stage, and made money.

&gt;&gt;(1) Greene expressed jealosy of Shakespeare the playwright, and Greene was a
&gt;&gt;professional writer of plays for the public stage.

&gt; Only a dyed-in-the-wool Strat would quote that
&gt; as 'evidence' -- and then they have to distort
&gt; their anatomy into hideous shapes to get it out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It's always been my feeling that if Shakespeare could be

John, would you try to be a little clearer--for those of us whose reading
comprehension is so poor that we &quot;don't have a clue as to the meaning of any of
the plays and poems&quot; of Shakespeare. Those of us, for instance, who somehow
think Romeo and Juliet is about two lovers whose families don't want them to
marry.

"/>

The &quot;rakes of nonsense splurged out&quot; are not splurged out by ALL comentators.
Similar rakes are splurged out about ALL great authors by SOME commentators, as
in this case. Moreover, the rakes are almost all SECONDARY to the CORE MEANINGS
just about all commentators find in the plays. The basics. Which are right.
Romeo and Juliet IS a play about two lovers whose families are enemies. Macbeth
IS a play about a man whose ambitions (and wife) lead him to murder, and suffer
for murdering, a king. &quot;A tale told by an idiot&quot; IS a metaphor for existence.
And so forth.

As I said before, a main reason for the nonsense is the need to say something
new--against an enormous amount of competition since Shakespeare is considered
The World's Greatest Writer and thus draws the most discussion of any writer.
There is also the temptation to apply every new philosophy or pseudosophy that
comes along to great authors; hence, for example, the spate of Freudian
interpretations of various plays that you and I would agree were nonsensical.
There is the problem, too, that the plays were written long ago, so have a
relatively great amount of allusions difficult for us to figure out. They are
also relatively complex, like most poetry, so difficult to get right all the
time.

Now my old question for you. Considering that no one agrees with your
interpretation of the plays and poems, and that no one considers your ideas
about any literary subject of sufficient value to publish, and that you have no
experience as a poet or dramatist to draw on, nor even much knowledge of any
writers but Shakespeare and Oxford, how is it that you can be so sure you're
right on this question--aside from the fact that you know you are (because you
know your data is sound and your reasoning correct)?
