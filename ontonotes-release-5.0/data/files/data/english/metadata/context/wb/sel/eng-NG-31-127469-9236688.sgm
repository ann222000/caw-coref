What if there were two angels, and only two angels in the whole wide world?

What if those two angels got bored, because all they could do was chit chat?

Maybe they would intentionally get into a fight...

...just so that they could strengthen each other...

If there were only two entities, and they got into a fight, they would have
a disagreement between them. If a disagreement existed then one of the entities
would be correct and the other entity would be wrong. The correct entity would
have the strength of truth on its side, defeat the wrongful entity, and then
there would be a pause.

At that point in time, the wrongful entity could only redeem itself by accepting
the truth. If it did not accept the truth, then it would forever be wrongful,
and it would forever be RIGHT for the correct entity to point the finger of
derision at the wrongful entity until such a time when it would accept the
truth. The truth is what the incorrect entity decided for itself to abandon
and that which instigated the disagreement in the first place. The truth flows
in a single direction. Anything that deviates from that direction is untrue,
and is in disagreement and disharmony with the universe.

But you are the one in error, Rrock.
You see, there was an Earthquake at the time Jesus died.
The Scriptures prove it.  And I have proven it to you.
And you can ask most anyone whom lives by the Scriptures,
and they will probably verify it to you as well.

If we are going to be locked in an eternal dual over whether
there was an Earthquake at the moment Jesus died, then
I would win, because an Earthquake at the moment Jesus died
glorifies Jesus, the one who ultimately decides what is right and
what is wrong.

Ghod Damn, Mark~!

You have 4 writers that do NOT fucking agree with each other.  Why are you
going along with one writer and NOT 3 other writers that mention not a damn
thing about A fucking earthquake.  Mary was there also and in Gnostic
writing, nothing is stated about a damn earthquake~!

Sorry, Mark, but this is bullshit~!

There isn't a single person that you can point to that
will agree with your misinterpretation of plain English.

You do not know what a semi-colon is, and you do not treat
a semi-colon with its intended purpose. Therefore, until
you learn how to read, what a semi-colon is and how it is
used, you will never be able to know the truth on that
topic.

You use the word &quot;if&quot; which means that you do not know.
I do not use the word &quot;if&quot; because i do know.

I did not say &quot;IF&quot; you knew what a semi-colon was... i said that
you do not know, and you don't; period. And notice that you are
unsure about your understanding as well, you said that &quot;they will
probably verify&quot;, and it shows that you KNOW you are unsure.
You did not say that they WOULD verify, but only &quot;probably&quot;.
So continuing to argue about it is, again, wrongful.

This is not the only instance, though, of your refusal to
see the truth. On practically every occasion someone offers
it to you freely, you prefer to deny it, become argumentative,
begin name-calling, blaming, and act like a troll.

Notice also that i only spoke the truth in my reply and referred
to the truth about any two entities. Notice that YOU intended to
say that &quot;angels&quot; were yourself and me, but that is not what you
wrote, now is it. So again, you are trying to run from the truth
and divert the conversational topic from even your own original
post to something personal you have against me. The only thing
that you can blame on me is telling you the truth even while you
spit on it. If i didn't care about you in the least bit, i wouldn't
even offer you the truth, but simply ignore you like a common
stray dog that roams the streets unattended. And i am not the only
person that you treat in this fashion. You haven't any right
whatsoever to do so, and are wrongful.

And ONE sentence. The meaning is that you saw the dog running; i.e. at
the same time.

But you are still denying the obvious. You purposely left out the
remainder of the quote from the bible because you knew that you
were wrong. That makes you a cowardly troll and a liar. Do you think
that people like me are so stupid that we cannot determine your
motives for such things? IT'S SO OBVIOUS! And only YOU think that
YOU could get away with such a thing. You are hiding from your
own act of lying and LYING TO YOURSELF. I already know the truth,
it doesn't matter what you tell me, i know what is true and what
is a lie. But to lie to yourself, MARK! HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK
THAT YOU ARE??? And how can you call yourself &quot;pure of heart&quot; when
you give lies to yourself and then force yourself to believe them?!?!?!
