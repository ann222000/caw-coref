It seems to me that although there is now little evidence for Bacon or
Oxford as the true author of the Shakespearean canon, at least the
Baconians have the advantage that their claims of ciphers can be
verified or falsified. Witness for example the devastating effect that
The Friedman's book &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined&quot; had on the
Baconian movement, where Bacon was once the most popular alt
candidate, now it's all about Oxford. But, The Friedmans took pains to
make it clear that they were only disproving the validity of the
ciphers that they examined, and they left the issue open as to whether
Bacon was the true author, going so far as to establish a set of
cryptological criteria by which all new claims might be evaluated, and
proved or disproved. The Strats who post here love to talk about
'evidence' and 'rational arguments', my question is; If a cipher were
to be found in the works of Shakespeare that named Bacon as the author
and that professional cryptographers agreed met the criteria set by
the Friedmans, how many of you would accept said findings and switch
your position? And since the primary Oxfordian argument against the
Actor is that he doesn't fit the profile of the author revealed in the
works, (an argument that doesn't hold against Bacon)how many of you
would accept a verified cipher and change your opinions?

If such a cipher were found, and professional cryptanalysis indicated
that it was authentic, I would accept said findings as evidence that
someone hid an authentic cipher in Shakespeare's works -- which would be
interesting, but not much of a basis for attributing the works to Bacon,
especially since all of the other evidence would still point to
Shakespeare.

Of course, I'm a Shake, not a Strat, so you may not find my answer
helpful.

that Bacon paid to have the code inserted so he could take credit for texts he
recognized as superior to anything he ever wrote.

With much less timidity than than the other respondents so far, I'll
gladly declare my willingness to convert to Baconism if the conditions
that Mr. Dias-Porter sets forth are satisfied. I have, however, the
advantage of having seen his decipherment, which he was good enough to
send to several people, including me, for comment. Quite inexcusably,
I haven't yet gotten back to him, but there's really little to say
about his work. He combs through the numerical values of words in the
Shakespearean corpus until he finds interesting coincidences. That
method, even were the coincidences far more striking than they are,
fails the most elementary test of a true cipher: There is no key that
can be provided to enable a reader to derive an unambiguous message.
Therefore, I don't anticipate endorsements from professional
cryptographers and won't trouble myself with trying to reconcile all
of the anomalies that Baconian authorship of Shakespeare would entail.

This would constitute absolute proof that someone had inserted a cipher,
maybe deVere or even Ben Jonson on a bad 7-year streak?

I think the possibility of Bacon informing a particular play or two (LLL,
eg) can't be well received by anyone in 'a camp' even though real historians
&lt;grin&gt; suggest it.

If it smells like bacon.... what price a collaboration? The modalities of

Tom, you make interesting remarks, although Baconian [neo-Platonic] textual
encoding as you reference below is not intended as a cipher, simply a
number-for-letter substitution. Ciphers also have substitution or letter
transpositional features.

That's how a cipher works, but neo-Platonic encoding is not of that sort.
Its basis is in geometric proportion, an intermediary mathematics links
proportion to a specific textual reference.

To save 10,000 words, do you know of two illustrations by the early
sixteenth century writer Ambrosius Leo? Their titles both contain references
to the city of Nola.

As may be observed from archaeology, the proportions used within this system
pre-date Greek's usage ~Greeks incorporated them linguistically. It is also
notable that units of measure on a world wide basis concur with each other
on this canonical basis.

Therefore, what is occulted in the text is resolved by the abstrusity of the
beholder, and if you know the keys to this canon, the text reveals not so
much a quanitity, but more a quality [of something in relation to something
else, or to the whole].

Of course this is no endorsement of anyone's authorship, but it is the basis
of wide-spread gematraic referencing in the writing of the time, and the
neo-Platonic revival.

Someone wrote me asking for specifics. Here is a completely perfunctory idea
of it:-

sample reading of Greek terms with an equivalent value
of [exactly] 1080.

Such phrases as:-

The Holy Spirit
The Spirit of the Earth
Fountain of Wisdom
Tartaros, the abyss
Cocytos
The Virgin

1081 = the abyss

1080 =radius of the moon in miles
108 =atomic weight of silver
1080 =number of breaths drawn in one hour (traditional)
10800 =number of stanzas in the Rigveda
10800 =number of bricks in the Indian fire altar
108 =number of beads on the Hindu or Buddhist rosary

a 'yin' number

whereas the number 666 is a yang number

their combination 1080+666 reveals the esoteric significance of the term 'a
grain of
mustard seed', 1746, as does also the Greek phrase the Spirit of the World.
That number is sometimes called 'the number of fusion'.

&quot;It is like a grain of mustard-seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is
less than all the seeds that be in the earth: But when it is sown, it
groweth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and shooteth out great
branches; so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.&quot;
/Mark iv, 31-32

And continues:

&quot;But without a parable spake he not unto them; and when they were alone, he
expounded all things to his disciples.&quot; /Mark iv, 34.

Cordially, Phil Innes

And the poets are led along the banks of rejoicing
With harp and drum and trumpet and clarion.
They are unknown but they lie now in the rough basement,
For who else built the stubborn structure of language
And rose against a silent melancholy and a dumb despair?
I call you now by your proper name..............

/Ackroyd, from English Music

It is interesting to observe that Veal has neglected to mention that
not only did I comb through the numerical values of words in the
Shakespearean corpus, but that I also combed through the numerical
values of two messages found in the Shakespearean corpus- one an
acrostically concealed substitution cipher, the other a keyed
transciption cipher found on p. 287 of King Lear in the First Folio.
And that the keys for both of these ciphers are provided. And that
both of these messages are unambiguous (in the crytographic sense)
that is that anyone who follows the outlined procedures will get
exactly the same message. Veal also neglected to mentioned that both
of these ciphers are structured in such a way that only the writer of
the open text could have created them. If anyone can answer why the
actor from Strat would have gone through the trouble to encrypt
Bacon's name into both the Sonnets and the First Folio, I'm all ears.

Did you send a copy to Terry Ross? He'd soon tell you if your cipher
was genuine. In fact he'll be giving a talk on ciphers this year at
our Shakespeare Fellowship conference, if you'd like to come and
listen.

Those who are interested may read Mr. Dias-Porter's paper for
themselves. The first of his alleged ciphers produces an
unintelligible text, for which he produces an interpretation that
requires the reader to be familiar with Napier's work on logarithms
(not published until five years after the Sonnets). The second
consists of the final syllables of five lines, which the reader must
rearrange to make into a facsimile of &quot;Sir Francis Bacon&quot;. The
argument that &quot;only the writer of the open text could have created
them&quot; rests on numerology. If you believe that sort of thing, then, as
Lincoln said, that is the sort of thing that you will believe.

&gt; both of these messages are unambiguous (in the crytographic sense)
&gt; that is that anyone who follows the outlined procedures will get
&gt; exactly the same message. Veal also neglected to mentioned that both
&gt; of these ciphers are structured in such a way that only the writer of
&gt; the open text could have created them. If anyone can answer why the
&gt; actor from Strat would have gone through the trouble to encrypt
&gt; Bacon's name into both the Sonnets and the First Folio, I'm all ears.

Two important points of clarification. One is the Veal has read an
early draft of my paper which differs in some important ways from the
current draft. The second is that at no time, in any place does my
paper rely on 'Numerology'. Numerology is the use of numbers (however
derived) for the purposes of divination (how to find a lover,
financial success, predict one's longevity, etc.)what my paper does
use is 'code numbers' derived from computing the numerical values of
words, this is a perfectly legitimate cryptological procedure, since
one my derive code numbers any way one wishes, and this practice gives
the number a verifiable connection to the word, name or phrase it
represents. As long as the alphabet one uses to spell the names is
stipulated, this practice allows an independent observer to calculate
the values and achieve the same results, that is , the connection
between the numbers and the names is independently verifiable and
thus, does not as Veal claims, suffer from ambiguity. The use of the
names of numbers in this fashion has a documented two-thousand year
history, and was particulary common among the Greeks and Romans. If
Veal wishes to disagree with my conclusion that is fine, what i'm
having difficulty understanding is why he consistently chooses to
mis-represent what i have written. While the level of incredulity
being displayed in the responses to my post is understandable (given
the demonstrated nuttiness of many Baconians, past and present), the
rancor, and lack of civility is not. Whether one accepts my paper's
conclusion with respect to the authorship or not, it will be clear
that the Baconian thesis is viable, and unlike the Oxfordian thesis,
has actual historical evidence in its favor. earlier two posters
referrred to &quot;hard evidence&quot; in favor of the actor. I would like to
ask them to give their definition of 'hard evidence' since it seems to
differ from mine. With respect to any authorship issue I would
consider &quot;hard evidence&quot; to consist of; manuscripts in the author's
hand; diary entries by the author that mention said work;letters to or
from the author that mention the disputed work or works; legal or
financial documents that mention both the author and the disputed
work; correspondence or written materials (including diary
entries)from individuals with a demonstrated (as opposed to
conjectured)personal knowledge of both the author and the work. I
consider any authentic evidence from the above categories to be
incontrivertible documentary evidence of authorship, thus the
designation 'hard evidence'. My point here is not that authorship
claims can only be founded on such evidence, but rather that these
documents comprise the strongest category of evidence. In the case of
many Elizabethan writers such evidence is not extant for every work
attributed to every writer. However such evidence is extant for some
works of some writers (Jonson, Middleton, Greene, and Heywood for
example) Thus this is not an unreasonable standard. To the best of my
knowledge ( please correct me if I'm wrong) none of the evidence for
the actor comes from the above category, this does not mean that he
isn't the author, but rather that his authorship has not been verified
to the highest level of proof. It should be manifestly obvious that in
an authorship dispute involving a pseudonymous author and another
individual of the same name, title-pages are useless as 'proof' since
they will bear the same name regardless, not withstanding the fact
that title-page attributions must always be corroborrated anyway,
since they could be erroneous, either accidentally or deliberately.
Since none of the contemporary literary allusions or references to the
writer William Shakespeare were made by individuals who had a
demonstrated personal knowledge of the author, they cannot be accepted
as 'hard evidence' since these writers would have responded to the
pseudonymous writer in the same fashion. In the case of Shakespeare
this leaves us with the Stratford Monument and the First Folio. Since
the provenance of the Monument is unknown, it cannot be placed in the
highest category of evidence. So the question is- is the First Folio
legitimate or a fraud? Anyone claiming that it is a fraud should be
required to produce evidence of a most compelling nature, speculation
or conjecture will not do. A very high level of scepticism is in
order, i think. However an authentic cipher meets the requirement of
compelling evidence. In previous cases the encrypted name of the true
author alone has been accepted as sufficent evidence to overturn
title-page attributions. In their dicussions of this Authorship
question, both Friedman and David Kahn (The CODEBREAKERS) provide
examples of attributions changing because of cryptological evidence.
These are the facts gentlemen, if i am in error, please demonstrate
where and how.

Your paper was not believable. No 'belief' was necessary! Its
straightforward encipherment of the period as Walsingham &amp; Co. may have
used. Added to which are those number substitutions which you correctly do
not call gematria - which is an esoteric system (or gnostic/hermetic
encoding from Jewish Qabbala).

The system you describe uses some of these features but its number system is
used exoterically. [Even though some numbers used have particular
significance in Qabbala] It is essentially neo-Platonic rather than
Platonic. It entirely lacks any geometric import.

It's not impossible to answer this question. I think the biggest 'Strat' and
Elizabethan scholar of all time even /suggested/ it! Especially a collusion
over LLL with Bacon. Even collaborations on other /early/ plays and the
sonnets with yet other people(s).

What is much more interesting to me is why anyone would expend so much
effort, beyond clever intellectual exercise, and if there is ALSO an
esoteric factor to these coded texts. It has interested me to talk with an
Oxfordian on the same issue.

What importance does it have if the brightest minds of an age did actually
collude with this actor/playwright? Is all the material encoded in the texts
merely reference to authorship, or something else too; even something ex
cathedra any text which localises for Britain a glimpse of lost canon or
mythogony, which indeed, is the fons et origo of most of its inspiration.

Let me answer the insinuation that I have uncivilly misrepresented Mr.
Dias-Porter. Here is the plain text of the cipher that he purports to
find in the dedication to the Sonnets: &quot;OONYPIRCYPPHRSBEKAANBACON&quot;,
&quot;or in normal English 'OO Napier ciphers beacon Bacon'&quot;. His
explanation of the odd spelling is that it was intended to make the
cipher more difficult to break - rather strange if the reason for
inserting it was to *disclose* the identity of the Sonnets' author!

The other &quot;cipher&quot; is in the First Folio text of King Lear. It
consists of the last syllables of four nonconsecutive lines, singled
out because each, omitting the last word, contains 33 letters, plus
the catch-word at the bottom of the page. The syllables are &quot;is&quot;,
&quot;bee&quot;, &quot;Con-&quot;, &quot;France&quot; and &quot;Sir&quot;, which can be rearranged as &quot;Sir
France is bee Con-&quot; if one is so inclined.

The rest of the paper consists of what I called &quot;numerology&quot;, a
familiar term that conveys, I think, a good sense of what the author
is doing. If I gave anyone the impression that he uses the text of
Shakespeare to predict the future, I apologize.

While others may judge for themselves, Mr. Dias-Porter's arguments
don't come within furlongs of convincing me that he has found
deliberate ciphers in Shakespeare. At most, he has demonstrated that,
if one begins with a preconceived idea and manipulates a large body of
data with sufficient vigor, it is possible to find coincidences that
will impress those ready to be impressed.

Actually, the author of the paper is at some pains to explain that it is not
a common numerology based on some predictive system. And furthermore,
differentiates between two other number-based systems, one of which is used
extensively, he also cites the use of anagrams and other purely verbal

I once read an on-line review of a particular translation of Dostoyevski
which began; &quot;if this guy thinks he's going to get published with that

I can read the Dias-Porter paper without resorting to having to believe it
or not, and simply take in what is presented so that I could re-present the
material arguing either side of it ~ no belief necessary at all! At one time
this method was used as a test of comprehension in the reader, rather than a

The clues as I understand them are in Napier followed by the double emphasis

In another post where I used 4 different ciphers in two paragraphs, I
speculated afterwards on both numeric and linguistic ciphers. Why, indeed,
go to all this trouble and complexity?

But Elizabethan encipherment is nothing new. What is novel in this case, is
the insistance upon using the name Bacon. The author of the paper we both
read does not dilate on this subject; being content to notice the
encipherment. In other instances, as you note, we see references to other
people; Baconian references may be subtly but specifically different
however, since they are related to a numeric canon of sorts; and that canon
contributes a value to the name Bacon beyond the mere fact of the name.
(Contrast with references elsewhere to deVere)

There is nothing at all strange about this, other people who have
hidden authorship attributions have also taken steps strengthen their
ciphers. It depends on how much time one wishes to elapse until the
cipher is broken. the following is from my paper:
<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

"/>

OO NYPIR CYPPHRS BEKAAN BACON.

The above message appears strange to modern eyes, however one should
keep in mind the Friedmans' admonition, &quot;We have already remarked that
acrostics were popular in Elizabethan literature; it should also be
stressed that spelling in those days was erratic&quot; In normal English
this message reads:

OO Napier ciphers beacon Bacon.

This message, at 25 letters long is too long to have appeared by
chance and long enough to be accepted as a unique mono-substitution
cipher solution. The above actions all meet the twofold requirements
established for substitution ciphers by the Friedmans, when they
wrote:

We shall only ask whether the solutions are valid: that is to say,
whether the plain texts make sense, and the cryptosystem and the
specific keys can be, or have been, applied without ambiguity.
Provided that independent investigation shows an answer to be unique,
and to have been reached by a valid means, we shall accept it, however
much we shock the learned world by doing so.

There is also another explanation for the phonetic spelling employed
in the message. The primary method for attacking mono-alphabetic
ciphers is an analysis of the frequencies with which the various
letters of the alphabet appear. Phonetic or deliberately bad spelling
changes the letter frequencies and makes the cryptanalyst's job
harder. In The Code Book, Simon Singh writes of attempts by sixteenth
century cryptographers to make their ciphers more secure:

An equally simple development was that cryptographers would sometimes
deliberately misspell words before encrypting the message. Thys haz
thi ifekkt off diztaughting thi ballans off frikwenseas- making it
harder for the cryptanalyst to apply frequency analysis.

In fact, in his manual on cryptography De Furtivis Literarum (1563),
Giambattista della Porta wrote of messages to be enciphered:

It will be a help not merely to be indifferent to the correct
spelling, but to make the writing so wrong that neither the right
number, or order, of letters, nor the right letters be written; as for
example, if Ingnis or Ingis be written for Ignis, Filipus for
Philippus, Furos for furor, etc. So that the author be thought
absolutely ignorant, not merely of spelling, but of common writing.
For it is better for a scribe to be thought ignorant than to pay the
penalty for detection of plans.

It appears that Bacon has taken della Porta's words to heart and the
words in the Sonnets cryptogram have had their spelling changed to
make the message more difficult to decipher.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;. At most, he has demonstrated that,
&gt;&gt; if one begins with a preconceived idea and manipulates a large body of
&gt;&gt; data with sufficient vigor, it is possible to find coincidences that
&gt;&gt; will impress those ready to be impressed.

"/>

The above is an excellent example of what I mean by misrepresentation,
Veal gives the idea that I went through all of Shakespeare willy-nilly
looking for coincidences, but this is not the case. in the version of
the paper that Veal has, what Veal is calling numerology
(isopsephia)was only applied to two cipher messages (a total of nine
words) which had already been found, neither by me. So there is no
large body of data, only two cipher messages, both of which bear
perfect numbers, the Kay value of the words which make up Sir Francis
Bacon as found on p.287 is 418, which is the anciently attested number
of Pallas Athena's name. So Veal wants us to believe that the three
33's are a coincidence, the fact that the last words of their lines
make up the name 'Sir Francis Bacon' is another coincidence and the
fact that the numerical value of these words adds up to the number of
Athena's name is still another coincidence, and the fact that all this
is found on p.287 (a number that Friedman mocked Baconians for putting
so much emphasis on)is a fourth coincidence. The fact that this occurs
on p 287 of the tragedies also gives the lie to the idea of people
'combing through large bodies of data'. There is only one p 287 in the
entire First Folio. The Kay value of the sonnets plaintext is 529,
there is only one word in that message which is spelled correctly,
&quot;Bacon&quot;, if we subtract the Kay value of &quot;Bacon&quot; (111) from 529, we
get 418. This would be the fifth coincidence, and one which connects
the two ciphers. People are free to believe want they want, but have
some ethics.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Two important points of clarification. One is the Veal has read an
&gt;&gt;&gt; early draft of my paper which differs in some important ways from the
&gt;&gt;&gt; current draft. The second is that at no time, in any place does my
&gt;&gt;&gt; paper rely on 'Numerology'. Numerology is the use of numbers (however
&gt;&gt;&gt; derived) for the purposes of divination (how to find a lover,
&gt;&gt;&gt; financial success, predict one's longevity, etc.)what my paper does
&gt;&gt;&gt; use is 'code numbers' derived from computing the numerical values of
&gt;&gt;&gt; words, this is a perfectly legitimate cryptological procedure, since
&gt;&gt;&gt; one my derive code numbers any way one wishes, and this practice gives
&gt;&gt;&gt; the number a verifiable connection to the word, name or phrase it
&gt;&gt;&gt; represents. As long as the alphabet one uses to spell the names is
&gt;&gt;&gt; stipulated, this practice allows an independent observer to calculate
&gt;&gt;&gt; the values and achieve the same results, that is , the connection
&gt;&gt;&gt; between the numbers and the names is independently verifiable and
&gt;&gt;&gt; thus, does not as Veal claims, suffer from ambiguity. The use of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; names of numbers in this fashion has a documented two-thousand year
&gt;&gt;&gt; history, and was particulary common among the Greeks and Romans. If
&gt;&gt;&gt; Veal wishes to disagree with my conclusion that is fine, what i'm
&gt;&gt;&gt; having difficulty understanding is why he consistently chooses to
&gt;&gt;&gt; mis-represent what i have written. While the level of incredulity
&gt;&gt;&gt; being displayed in the responses to my post is understandable (given
&gt;&gt;&gt; the demonstrated nuttiness of many Baconians, past and present), the
&gt;&gt;&gt; rancor, and lack of civility is not. Whether one accepts my paper's
&gt;&gt;&gt; conclusion with respect to the authorship or not, it will be clear
&gt;&gt;&gt; that the Baconian thesis is viable, and unlike the Oxfordian thesis,
&gt;&gt;&gt; has actual historical evidence in its favor. earlier two posters
&gt;&gt;&gt; referrred to &quot;hard evidence&quot; in favor of the actor. I would like to
&gt;&gt;&gt; ask them to give their definition of 'hard evidence' since it seems to
&gt;&gt;&gt; differ from mine. With respect to any authorship issue I would
&gt;&gt;&gt; consider &quot;hard evidence&quot; to consist of; manuscripts in the author's
&gt;&gt;&gt; hand; diary entries by the author that mention said work;letters to or
&gt;&gt;&gt; from the author that mention the disputed work or works; legal or
&gt;&gt;&gt; financial documents that mention both the author and the disputed
&gt;&gt;&gt; work; correspondence or written materials (including diary
&gt;&gt;&gt; entries)from individuals with a demonstrated (as opposed to
&gt;&gt;&gt; conjectured)personal knowledge of both the author and the work. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; consider any authentic evidence from the above categories to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; incontrivertible documentary evidence of authorship, thus the
&gt;&gt;&gt; designation 'hard evidence'. My point here is not that authorship
&gt;&gt;&gt; claims can only be founded on such evidence, but rather that these
&gt;&gt;&gt; documents comprise the strongest category of evidence. In the case of
&gt;&gt;&gt; many Elizabethan writers such evidence is not extant for every work
&gt;&gt;&gt; attributed to every writer. However such evidence is extant for some
&gt;&gt;&gt; works of some writers (Jonson, Middleton, Greene, and Heywood for
&gt;&gt;&gt; example) Thus this is not an unreasonable standard. To the best of my
&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge ( please correct me if I'm wrong) none of the evidence for
&gt;&gt;&gt; the actor comes from the above category, this does not mean that he
&gt;&gt;&gt; isn't the author, but rather that his authorship has not been verified
&gt;&gt;&gt; to the highest level of proof. It should be manifestly obvious that in
&gt;&gt;&gt; an authorship dispute involving a pseudonymous author and another
&gt;&gt;&gt; individual of the same name, title-pages are useless as 'proof' since
&gt;&gt;&gt; they will bear the same name regardless, not withstanding the fact
&gt;&gt;&gt; that title-page attributions must always be corroborrated anyway,
&gt;&gt;&gt; since they could be erroneous, either accidentally or deliberately.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Since none of the contemporary literary allusions or references to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; writer William Shakespeare were made by individuals who had a
&gt;&gt;&gt; demonstrated personal knowledge of the author, they cannot be accepted
&gt;&gt;&gt; as 'hard evidence' since these writers would have responded to the
&gt;&gt;&gt; pseudonymous writer in the same fashion. In the case of Shakespeare
&gt;&gt;&gt; this leaves us with the Stratford Monument and the First Folio. Since
&gt;&gt;&gt; the provenance of the Monument is unknown, it cannot be placed in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; highest category of evidence. So the question is- is the First Folio
&gt;&gt;&gt; legitimate or a fraud? Anyone claiming that it is a fraud should be
&gt;&gt;&gt; required to produce evidence of a most compelling nature, speculation
&gt;&gt;&gt; or conjecture will not do. A very high level of scepticism is in
&gt;&gt;&gt; order, i think. However an authentic cipher meets the requirement of
&gt;&gt;&gt; compelling evidence. In previous cases the encrypted name of the true
&gt;&gt;&gt; author alone has been accepted as sufficent evidence to overturn

&gt;&gt;&gt; Let me answer the insinuation that I have uncivilly misrepresented Mr.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Dias-Porter. Here is the plain text of the cipher that he purports to
&gt;&gt;&gt; find in the dedication to the Sonnets: &quot;OONYPIRCYPPHRSBEKAANBACON&quot;,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;or in normal English 'OO Napier ciphers beacon Bacon'&quot;. His
&gt;&gt;&gt; explanation of the odd spelling is that it was intended to make the
&gt;&gt;&gt; cipher more difficult to break - rather strange if the reason for
&gt;&gt;&gt; inserting it was to *disclose* the identity of the Sonnets' author!

&gt;&gt; To hide from some, to reveal to others. It is _common_ in cipher systems to
&gt;&gt; use differing spellings especially of proper-nouns that would otherwise
&gt;&gt; reveal themselves by their repetition or format.

&gt; My main point, which I didn't think needed elaboration, is that both
&gt;&quot;OONYPIRCYPPHRSBEKAANBACON&quot; and its supposed &quot;normal English&quot;
&gt; equivalent &quot;OO Napier ciphers beacon Bacon&quot; are nonsense. My secondary
&gt; point is that heightening the difficulty of the cipher makes little
&gt; sense if the True Author hoped to use this device to gain recognition
&gt; for his work. Parallel instances from real literary history are all
&gt; very simple - typically acrostics.

"/>

I haven't seen the alleged cipher, but it must be quite similar to one of
Penn Leary's. The string &quot;OONYPIRCYPPHRSBEKAAN&quot; is a genuine Learyism.
I pointed out some of the problems with some of Leary's methods in &quot;The
Code That Failed: Testing a Bacon-Shakespeare Cipher,&quot; which is available
at

The presence of the string &quot;OONYPIRCYPPHRSBEKAAN&quot; in Dias-Porter's
&quot;plaintext&quot; is evidence not of a genuine cipher but of a remarkable
devotion to Leary's methods. I hope Dias-Porter credited Leary -- from
the accounts posted here, one might almost think that Dias-Porter was
claiming Leary's methods for himself.

Terry,
The cipher was found by Penn leary and he is credited. i have read
your critique of Leary's other so-called ciphers, but it is not
relevant here since the string is 25 letters long, which is long
enough to constitute a legitimate cipher. I agree with you that his
other ciphers are all too short to be accepted. The Friedmans set 25
letters as long enough for a substitution cipher to preclude its
appearing by chance. however this particular cipher is also an
acrostic, and 25 letters is more than enough to preclude an acrostic
appearing by chance. it is outside of the realm of chance that one can
select 25 letters acrostically, then shift them four spaces (or any
number of spaces) and get a grammatical message.

That's irrelevant, since even if one accepts your revised spelling of
&quot;OONYPIRCYPPHRSBEKAANBACON&quot; as &quot;OO Napier ciphers beacon Bacon,&quot; that
still doesn't make it a grammatical message: it's just a series of
words (and the meaningless &quot;OO&quot;) strung together.

As to the spelling -- while it is true that Elizabethan spelling was
erratic, it was not so erratic as to allow Napier to come out &quot;nypir&quot;
and beacon to come out &quot;bekaan.&quot; And the hypothesis that Bacon
deliberately altered the spelling of every plaintext word *except his
own name* is a bit odd.

If one bends over backwards far enough to allow 'bekaan' to represent
the word 'beacon' *and* allows it to function as a verb, thus making the
phrase marginally grammatical, it *still* provides no evidence that
anyone named Bacon wrote Shakespeare's works.

There is a large set of purported Baconian ciphers in Shakespeare.
There is a large set of &quot;significant&quot; numbers. There is a large set
of ways to manipulate the numerical values of words to produce
significant numbers. To connect five of the &quot;significant numbers&quot; to
one of the &quot;ciphers&quot; is hardly a formidable task, if only, in Dr.
Johnson's phrase, a man abandons his mind to it.

A patient inquirer can find multiple coincidences of this sort in any
passage by any author. Pre-modern Biblical commentators produced
reams of such stuff.

I think that your own statements are enough to show that I haven't
misrepresented your method, unless you regard failure to be convinced
as a sure sign of bad faith.

This is also true. But my paper does not avail itself of this &quot;large
set&quot; The number 33 is the simple value of 'Bacon', a number that would
be allowed under even the most conservative sets of numbers. And this
number is found in direct connection with the name 'Sir Francis
Bacon'. the number 418 is the number of Pallas Athene, once again a
number which would be allowed under the most conservative of
circumstances. Even if I am restricted to only the numbers of the
names of Bacon, Athene, and Shakespeare, and certain agreed upon

&gt; one of the &quot;ciphers&quot; is hardly a formidable task, if only, in Dr.

If you are referring to the isopsephia of the sonnets cipher message,
note that the significance of the number 103 and 77 are allowable
since they are numbers of names (Shakespeare and Minerva), the
significance of the other two numbers 136 and 151 was not established
by me, but rather has been part of the Baconian lore for over 90
years. These numbers are derived from anomalies in the text of F1. the
'long word' appears on page 136 of the Comedies, and is the 151st word
printed in Roman type, and the simple value of this word is 287 (136 +
151 = 287). Thus these are 'hard numbers' whose significance is
established BY the TEXT itself. The cipher of Bacon's name found in
F1, appears on p. 287, and the numbers 151 and 136 appear in the
isopsephia of the sonnets cryptogram (as the Kay values of the words
'cypphrs' and 'bekaan'), not to mention the fact that both cryptograms
connect the word 'beacon' (variously spelled 'bekaan' and 'beecon') to
the name Bacon. thus there is no &quot;large set&quot; employed, although
theoretically one does exist. These are not mere coincidences but
quadruple and quintuple coincidences that occur in relation to Bacon's
name in both cases. An excellent argument can be made for EVERY number
used in the above example. But let us approach this from another
angle, there are two numbers that were known to be of great import in
Elizabethan England, the numbers 49, (7 x 7) and 63, (7 x 9). They
were known as 'climacteric numbers' and were considered portentous
(this is numerology proper), when a man reached these two ages
significant changes in his life were expected. These two numbers are
known to be of great interest to Shakespeare because of all the
sonnets, only nos. 49 and 63 begin with the word 'against' and both
involves changes occurring over time. Two ciphers have been found in
the works of Shakespeare that meet the Friedmans' requirements, one in
the Sonnets (1609) the other in F1 (1623), in 1609 Francis Bacon
turned 49 years of age and in 1623 Bacon turned 63. Co-incidence? Then
explain why the first piece of writing ever published under the name
William Shakespeare (Venus and Adonis) appears in 1593, which is the
year Bacon turned 33.

nothing odd about it, this was done to establish the parallel between

Why is it necessary for one to 'allow' the word beacon to be used as a
verb? it is listed as such in every dictionary of the English
language. the existence of a legitimate cipher in the sonnets that
states that &quot;Napier ciphers (whatever they are) beacon (or signal)
Bacon&quot; may not be conclusive proof in and of itself (nor am i arguing
that it is) but neither is it of no import whatsoever. Strats
consistently deny that there is no Authorship Question and no evidence
for Bacon, this proves both of those contentions wrong, even if it
doesn't overturn the orthodox attribution. Along with the Historical
evidence in my paper (which Veal is amazingly silent about) this means
that the Authorship Problem is a legitimate path of scholarly inquiry.
I think that the additional evidence (the other cipher) for example,
and the fact that isopsephia can explain some anomalous features of
the texts clinches the point. But it takes an entire paper to make all
these points. the paper is available to any and all who wish to read
it. it is fully referenced and makes both a historical argument (based
on documentary evidence not conjecture) and a cryptological argument.

&quot;Beacon,&quot; simple of itself, was not used as a verb prior to the 19th

But it isn't a legitimate cipher unless one accepts your re-spelling,

&quot;Only Percy papers beckon Bacon,&quot; and at least Bacon would have been
able to understand that without access to the OED. That's the wonderful

You seem to forget that what you are calling superstition,
numerology-the use of numbers in a portentous way-was very common in
Elizabethan England, even among the learned. Even that staunch
Baconian Katherine Duncan-Jones wrote that the ordering of
Shakespeare's sonnets adheres to some of these concepts. Explain the
49 and 63 thing in the sonnets otherwise.

"/>

&quot;Marginally grammatical&quot; is a very far cry from &quot;perfect sense.&quot; And
let's take another look at that verb. As I already noted, there is no
attested use of the word 'beacon' as a verb before Milton's phrase
&quot;beaconed up&quot; appeared in 1644, thirty-five years after Shakespeare's
Sonnets were published and eighteen years after Bacon's death. But
that's not the only problem with your decipherment. Following Leary,
you interpret 'beacon' as a synonym for 'signal.' The OED gives the
following meanings for the verb 'beacon' (I've added the date of the
earliest citation):

1: beacon up: to raise or kindle as a beacon (1644)
2: to light up, as a beacon-fire does (1803)
2b:(figurative) to give light and guidance to: to lead (1835)
3: to furnish with beacons (1821)
4: (intransitive) to shine like a beacon (1821)

The only one of these that even comes close to your interpretation is
2b, and unfortunately for your decipherment, the OED's earliest
attestation to that use is taken from Robert Browning's &quot;Paracelsus.&quot;

But of course, there are other dictionaries. Let's look at Webster's
Third New International, where the verb 'beacon' has the following
meanings:

1 a: to light as a beacon
b: to give light to: inspire and guide: summon to achievement
2: to furnish or mark with a beacon; (intransitive) to shine as a beacon

Once again, we see that 'signal' is not among the meanings. (As a side
note, the authority cited for meaning 1b is none other than Browning.)
You appear to have been badly misled by Penn Leary's claim that beacon
&quot;was used in the 17th century as a verb, meaning 'to signal,' or 'to
give light and guidance to.'&quot; ( )
In fact, there is *no* evidence that it was ever used to mean &quot;to
signal,&quot; and five minutes' worth of research would have disclosed to you
that Leary quoted the second meaning directly from the OED while
omitting the date of first occurrence -- two hundred and nine years
after Sir Francis Bacon's death!

&quot;Only Percy papers beckon Bacon,&quot; my revised version of Tom Veal's
decipherment, is much more sensible than &quot;OO Napier ciphers beacon
Bacon,&quot; and as I already noted, it has an added advantage in that it
would have been intelligible to Bacon and his contemporaries.

If there *were* a record that Shakespeare was hoarding grain (as opposed

anyone not bearing a grudge against Shakespeare could find it
unflattering that he had 1.35% of Stratford's total malt supply, and 0%
of its total wheat supply, in 1598.

despite the fact that no one knows what 'Napier ciphers' are and no one
knows that he is using 'beacon' as a verb, the message will be too easy to
understand, so he introduces misspellings, producing &quot;OO Nypir cypphrs
bekaan Bacon.&quot; No worry about anyone understanding that! But he is
worried; because next he encrypts it. But not by using the English
alphabet; for no reason, he omits the letters W, X, and Z, and ciphers his
message thus: SS RDTNY GDTTMYA FIOEER FEGSR. Then he goes to the printer,
designs a phony cover page and dedication for his book of sonnets, and sets
the type himself. Now all he needs to do is sit back and wait for three
hundred and fifty years, until Penn Leary comes along and deciphers it!

But people encountering this 'neologism' would not be encountering the word
beacon, but rather the ciphertext FIOEER. If they had a key to Bacon's
alleged 21-letter cipher, they would encounter the word BEKAAN. Since
there is no such word, they would have to guess at what word Bacon
intended. Is there any reason why they should prefer 'beacon' to 'beckon'
or 'began' or 'became'? If the word must be a verb, parsimony demands that
we rule out existing verbs before introducing unprecedented usages.

"/>

It's not my fault that you don't understand the elementary principles of
encipherment. But I will be generous, and explain. Messages are
encrypted so they may be read only by the persons to whom they are sent.
The encryptor assumes that the person receiving the message will have
the key to the cipher. If the message can be deciphered without the
key, the cipher is worthless and should be discarded immediately.

Since the early treatises on encryption were premised on the assumption
that coded messages would be used to send military and diplomatic
information, there was no reason for them to belabor the obvious.

Unlike ciphers, acrostics have never been used to conceal important
secrets; they are a form of literary amusement, and are invariably
composed in plaintext. The composer of an acrostic is showing off.
Anyone can read one: some truly ingenious composers set acrostic riddles
everywhere -- a clever reader always finds them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But you've no doubt anticipated this objection and produced Bacon's

&gt; This is lovely. Now you are not only making up facts, but you are
&gt; making up my response to your made-up facts. I have made no such
&gt; claim, not in my paper (which i doubt you've read) or in any post to

"/>

Yes, I know. I thought you would be familiar with the concept of
sarcasm; my mistake. I assumed you had not made such a claim, because
if you had, this whole discussion would be moot: Bacon's code-book would
be decisive evidence in favor of the putative cryptogram. I will go out
on a limb here and predict that no such code-book ever will be found.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&quot;Beacon,&quot; simple of itself, was not used as a verb prior to the 19th
&gt;&gt; Century. Milton used the phrase &quot;beacon up&quot; in 1644, but it never
&gt;&gt; really caught on. Neither Francis Bacon nor any of his
&gt;&gt; contemporaries would have found the message &quot;Napier ciphers beacon
&gt;&gt; Bacon&quot; intelligible.

&gt; This statement about Elizabethans not understanding the use of the
&gt; word is simply not true.

"/>

Yes it is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The use of an existing noun as a verb is a very common form of
&gt; neologism, and is easily understood.

"/>

It is easily understood *if found in an unambiguous plaintext.* No one
would employ a neologism in an ambiguous ciphertext unless they never
wished said text to be properly deciphered. Bacon could not anticipate
that 19th Century would use 'beacon' as a verb.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We have hundreds of years of linguistic history to verify this. The
&gt; use of beacon as a verb may have been a neologism, but the Elizabethan
&gt; era was the age of neologisms. using your logic, Elizabethans would
&gt; have found the plays of Shakespeare (which contain thousands of
&gt; neologisms) unintelligle, and we know that not to be the case.

"/>

Using your logic, Shakespeare would have concealed his thousands of
neologisms behind a double wall of deliberate misspelling and
encryption, and then further concealed them as acrostics on ordinary
title pages of other people's works, thus making them thoroughly
unintelligible -- and not only to Elizabethans.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In 1609 there was no dictionary of the English language, so people

&gt; your logic is faulty here, only those instances of the word 'shake'
&gt; or 'spear' found in CRYPTOGRAMS can strengthen the actor's case.

So by your logic, the discovery of the plaintext phrase &quot;I, Francis
Bacon, wrote these works&quot; in a copy of the First Folio wouldn't
strengthen the case for Bacon. I see.

Mark, please take a breath, quote my whole missif &lt;yawn&gt; then argue if you
will on 'Bek'. I think your suggestion of its correlation with beacon is
refuted, nevermind what Joel understood by it. One's orientation should be
toward what is evidently there, rather than what one regrets, no?

In your post you do not honour the statistical validity of such a cipher -
do you in fact accept it? And if so we could choose to explore its meaning,
or alternatively blagh about what is convenient to our own understanding...
which will place you as either a genuine researcher or as a Strat
barnyard-fellow, fit to moooo with the herd, and all.

You seem to have a genuine interest in discussing such things, as said
before (and why snip in this case?) if the math refutes chance probability,
what then could the inclusion mean?

why not respond to the entire post I wrote on the word in question, rather
than this impostiteur and hauteur you brayingly assume which is utterly
indistinguisable from a laziness or even impotence in addressing any issue,
but resembles incohate noise from the 100 acre wood?

Are you immune or superior to a conversation on content in posts? I know
this is the often the de riguer method of many Strats here, that no
discussion is necessary and only ad hominem is required as response to the
perceived inadequacy of other's opinion, because they hold the castle, and
only defence is necessary......

However, this establishes nothing but a retreat into a conservative barnyard
huddle, and is symptomatic of such a great philospher as Pelonius eg.
&lt;snore&gt; or Eyeore, upon the remote world of real people's concerns.

[incidentally, how would you define ad hominem?]

But should you insist on such reactions, it qualifies your own attitude
rather than mine which you fail to address at all. Thereby you might at
least state so much if you are intellectually honest, which it must be said,
is entirely in question.

Should you have further trouble in reading this text and infer it the result

The string is not a &quot;genuine cipher,&quot; as you would know if you read the
Friedmans' book. As others have already pointed out, the supposed result
is not grammatical, but in any event it is not even the product of a
consistent and neutral set of procedures. If you have read my essays on
Penn Leary, you will know that while I was able to apply his methods (such
as they are) precisely, he himself frequently cheats. As I said in my
reply to him,

====

For example, in his procrustean attempt to find traces of Bacon in the
front-matter of the sonnets, he shifts from a cipher where an &quot;f&quot; in
English is a &quot;b&quot; in Bakish to one where &quot;b&quot; in English is &quot;f&quot; in Bakish.
For a time he uses the last letters of each capitalized word (plus some
numbers), until he gets stuck; then he starts using penultimate letters;
then when he gets stuck again he starts using the first letter, and when
he gets stuck again, he decides to ignore an inconvenient letter; then
when he gets stuck yet again he starts picking out antepenultimate letters
(omitting the occasional inconvenient letter). His only principle seems to
be &quot;If I'm stuck then Bacon must have just switched ciphers on me&quot;; not
once does he ever consider the more reasonable conclusion: &quot;There is no
cipher.&quot;

====

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I agree with you that his other ciphers are all too short to be
&gt; accepted.

"/>

Do you also agree that his proposed ciphers from *Shakespeare's Sonnets*
are the product of fudging, cheating, and massaging?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The Friedmans set 25 letters as long enough for a substitution cipher to
&gt; preclude its appearing by chance.

"/>

What &quot;cipher&quot;? The 25-letter string is not a cipher.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; however this particular cipher is also an acrostic, and 25 letters is
&gt; more than enough to preclude an acrostic appearing by chance.

"/>

No, it is not an acrostic, either. Nor is it a deciphered acrostic. In a
genuine acrostic, letters are chosen on the basis of a strict procedure.
In a genuine substitution cipher, letters are changed on the basis of a
strict procedure. Leary arbitrarily changes his selection and
transformation procedures whenever he gets stumped.

To quote the Friedmans once more, &quot;In every acrostic, the rules for
selecting the letters of the secret text are invariable, and the selection
follows a fixed pattern; moreover, the selected letters are chosen in a
particular order, and the rules for setting them out in the form of a text
are rigid and inflexible. It is never a matter of taking, say, the first
letter of the first line, the seventh and tenth of the second line, and
the fourth of the third line; nor is it a matter of rearranging these
letters until we find an anagram of them which makes sense. This must be
true of any acrostic whose existence is not to be open to doubt.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; it is outside of the realm of chance that one can select 25 letters
&gt; acrostically, then shift them four spaces (or any number of spaces) and
&gt; get a grammatical message.

"/>

No, it is very much within the realm of chance -- in fact, the odds of
such a thing's happening by chance could even be calculated, but there is
no reason to go down that road until we see a &quot;grammatical message&quot; that
results from selecting &quot;25 letters acrostically&quot; and then shifting then 4
spaces.

Even if the 25-letter string you so admire had been produced by fair
methods (and it was not), it would not count as &quot;plaintext.&quot; You cannot
present &quot;plaintext&quot; that is gibberish and then tell us that your cipher is
genuine but that the &quot;plaintext&quot; requires decoding. If it requires
decoding, IT IS NOT PLAINTEXT!

As the Friedmans say, &quot;the plain-text solution must make sense, in
whatever language it is supposed to have been written; it must be
grammatical ('Hearts green slow mud' would not do) and it must mean
something ('Pain is a brown Sunday' would not do either). It does not
matter whether what the solution says is true or not; it may be a pack of
lies, but that is not the cryptologist's business. The important thing is
that it must say something, and say it intelligibly.&quot;

Explaining Leary's cheating will take some time, so pull up a chair, if
you are interested. Leary wanted to find a message about Bacon in the
title page and dedication to the sonnets. He explained his labors in
considerable detail, but the story he tells is not important to his
demonstration: only the method and the results are. Leary's basic method
is to take the last letter of each word in the title page and dedication,
and then to replace each letter with another according to a fixed
procedure. Here, expressed in simple Perl, are his rules for replacement:

s/[0XZ]//ig;

That is, delete or ignore the numeral &quot;0&quot; and the letters &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;.

tr/jJuUwW123456789/iIvVvVABCDEFGHI/;

That is, change every &quot;J&quot; to an &quot;I&quot;; every &quot;U&quot; or &quot;W&quot; to a &quot;V&quot;, and
replace the numerals &quot;1&quot; through &quot;9&quot; with the 1st through 9th letters of
the alphabet respectively.

tr/ABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRSTVYabcdefghiklmnopqrstvy/STVYABCDEFGHIKLMNOPQRstvyabcd efghiklmnopqr/;

That is, replace each remaining letter with the one that comes 4 places
before it in a 21-letter alphabet. (Bacon assumed a 24-letter alphabet in
his writings about ciphers, by the way).

This method is not difficult to follow, and it is an easy matter to write
a simple program that will transform any Latin-alphabet text in the Leary
manner. There are problems with his replacement method (e.g., it does not
amount to a strict one-to-one substitution procedure; it is designed to
inflate the number of accidental &quot;Bacons&quot;); nevertheless, IF strictly
following these two processes (the selection by rule and the replacement
by rule) produced a 25-character plaintext message that was grammatical in
English (or any other language), then we might have to consider whether
Penn might finally on to something genuine at long last. As we shall see,
Leary cheats by violating both parts of his method, but let us see what
WOULD happen IF we applied such a method consistently.

Here are all the words from the title page and dedication, aligned so that
it is easy to pick out the last letters (if they are seen in a fixed-width
font):

This is what we would see if we used a &quot;last letter of each word&quot; acrostic
method honestly:

SSredTNyGdrTTdeoeeymy9OEERFEGSrWHLEDTEDYRGTHEGRNGHTT

While you talk of a &quot;25-letter&quot; string, the &quot;acrostic&quot; that we get when we
apply the &quot;take-the-last-letter&quot; method faithfully is 52 characters long.
Why did you jettison 27 of the 52 letters?

The 52-letter &quot;acrostic&quot; is not very promising, it it? It looks like
gibberish, with occasional substrings that look like words: &quot;RED,&quot;&quot;DEO,&quot;
&quot;LED,&quot;&quot;TED,&quot;&quot;THE.&quot; I suppose one could try to put some of the words
together and force some kind of meaning out of the remaining gibberish,
but any attempt to do so would only confirm that the proposed last-letter
acrostic is not a &quot;plaintext&quot; in any recognizable language.

Now let's transform the letters according to Leary's standard method, but
without any cheating:

OOnayPIrCynPPyakaarhrEKAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDPP

Not very promising, is it? It looks like gibberish, with occasional
substrings that look like words: &quot;nay,&quot;&quot;yak,&quot;&quot;BACOn,&quot;&quot;Con,&quot;&quot;nOD,&quot;
&quot;GAY,&quot;&quot;PAY.&quot; I suppose we could, for our own entertainment, try to put
some of the words together and force some kind of meaning out of the
remaining gibberish, but any attempt to do so would only confirm that the
proposed &quot;last-letter acrostic with substituted letters&quot; is not a
&quot;plaintext&quot; in any recognizable language. Political junkies might see
&quot;GAYPAYRNC&quot; as &quot;GAY PAY RNC,&quot; and tell us that the gay Republican &quot;Log
Cabin&quot; organization has decided to give money (&quot;PAY&quot;) to the republican
National Committee (&quot;RNC). One can play various &quot;word-find&quot; games with
the entire string, but the fact remains that it is not &quot;plaintext&quot; in
English or any other language. It is not grammatical. It is not
meaningful.

Penn Leary must have seen the trouble he was in, so he cheated. Rather
than using the consistent rule of taking the last letter of every word, he
decided to ignore some words entirely.

If he had honestly followed a consistent method of selecting the last
letters of each word, Leary would have had this for the first 21 words:

SsredTNyGdrTTdeoeeymy

Leary prefers this subset

SSr_dTNyGd_TT______my

The underscores mark the letters Penn wishes to ignore. Note that the
longest stretch in the first 21 where where he follows the &quot;last letter&quot;
method is 6 words.

After 21 words, he begins to cheat even more. Rather than treating the
date &quot;1609&quot; as a &quot;word&quot; subject to the &quot;last letter&quot; method (that is, to
select the &quot;9&quot; as the 22nd character in his acrostic), Leary take the 1,
the 6, AND the 9, and transforms them into &quot;AFI.&quot;

Leary then resumes the &quot;take the last letter&quot; method, but stops in the
middle of the ...

Now, now, Terry, as I know you are aware, the scholarship of Peter Farey has
demnonstrated beyond doubt that Elizabethan poets had no problem with concealing
one part of a secret message by one procedure, another by an entirely different
(unannounced) procedure. That's how Marlowe proved he was Shakespeare. I'm
sure we will ultimately find at least twenty-seven Elizabethans each of whom
also used the multiple/random super-method of concealing secret messages in
texts that seemed innocent to the naive to prove he was Shakespeare. I myself
am trying to show that Shakespeare himself concealed his name in the title of
&quot;Shakespeares Sonnets&quot; using such a method, and am only having trouble with the

I know that quite well. And if we had Bacon's code-book, we could see
whether or not he used one. In the absence of said code-book, it is
painfully obvious that Leary arbitrarily chose to omit several letters
from the alphabet in order to get the right message out of the gibberish
he knew must be a cipher. Look hard enough, and you will find anything.

Yes, that does put it in its proper historical context -- sheer fantasy.
It was a bit disappointing to find so little about the Knights Templar

I especially like the fact that whoever put the page up forgot to

The truth *is* out, and has been for over four hundred years. What is

resort to such pitiable tactics as pulling letters off the cover pages
of Shakespeare's works and fiddling around with them until they get
nonsensical 'ciphers.'

Here's the truth about Penn Leary, summed up nicely by the man himself.

for so dismissing the rest of a sonnet in which the author repeatedly
puns on his own name, ending with the famous final line:

And then thou louest me, for my name is Will.

Not Frank, not Ed, not Chris.

None of Penn Leary's supposed &quot;plaintexts&quot; states that Bacon wrote the

Shakespeare did indeed conceal his name in the title of *Shakespeares
Sonnets* -- but he did so in a very clever way, and we have Penn Leary to
thank for allowing us to prove it.

Here is the original title:

SHAKE-SPEARES SONNETS

Now let us shift every letter four places to the left, using Leary's
methods:

ODSFA-OLASNAO OKIIAPO

Hey, I think we're onto something. Let's take &quot;ODSFA-OLASNAO OKIIAPO&quot; and
shift every one of its letters another four places to the left, using
Leary's methods:

KYOBS-KGSOISK KFEESLK

Better and better. Since Leary uses a 21-letter alphabet, let's see what
happens if we use his method 21 times. We'll number the original title
&quot;O&quot;, and use &quot;1&quot; for the first transformation, &quot;2&quot; for the second, and so
on.

I do incidentally agree with your comments about prepositions and the
vageries of post-Latinate grammatical construction. The test though is in
poetry, even if blank verse, and where the natural stress falls if declamed.
Any prepositional end-stopping would therefore acquire a significance which
would be as well intended!

What is particularly interesting (sorry to VERe back on topic) about the
Work is that it is intended to be spoken, no? To resist for a moment all
these ideas of complicated enciphering within the body of the text ~ unless
they are literary allusion, rather than cipher ~ no one listening could
possibly work them out as they were spoken, especially any estranged
spelling.

If, I say 'if', one wanted to deploy a complex mathematical cipher, it would
logically need to appear on endpapers, posters and hand-bills, monuments,
and such, where the reader has leisure to decrypt it. &lt;right?&gt;

And finally, why do you reject some level of collaboration between say Billy

verbal

that
&gt; Phil IS incoherent at times, and that Mark is NOT out of line correcting
what he
&gt; thinks are his errors rather than his logic, if there is any. Not that
I'm
&gt; against being out of line.

I completely agree with you Bob! Well said! Someone needed to just plain say
it, and only such a truly noble mind in our midst, while still possessing an
impartial and cool regard to fact, could so conjoin both these elements into
that cohesive appelation which you have now shared with us.

Happy Birthday to You (yesterday), Phil :))

Nuts, you beat me to it, Terry. That's the way I was doing it, but I couldn't
get the &quot;k&quot; to come out right.

As for Peter Farey's procedure, I knew it was exempt from the Friedmans' rules;
what it validated, however, was the use of more than one method of
text-extraction where required to determine a secret message, whether the
message was concealed with ciphers or some combination of wordgame manipulations
plus or minus the use of ciphers. And certainly for those not biased against
alternative candidates, the message Peter found does indicate that Marlowe was
Shakespeare. What could be clearer than &quot;Not without bacon?&quot; Or am I getting
the secret messages mixed up?

&gt; No, it is not an acrostic, either. Nor is it a deciphered acrostic. In a

Neither of these statements are true if one is restricted to the first
25 letters. If you had read my paper you would know that it quotes the
Friedmans extensively.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; No, it is very much within the realm of chance -- in fact, the odds of

If you're going to argue that a 25 letter acrostic is within the realm
of chance (by which i meant extremely unlikey to have happened only by
chance), then you will have to show the calculation of the odds, a
simple declaration won't do.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Even if the 25-letter string you so admire had been produced by fair
&gt; methods (and it was not), it would not count as &quot;plaintext.&quot; You cannot
&gt; present &quot;plaintext&quot; that is gibberish and then tell us that your cipher is
&gt; genuine but that the &quot;plaintext&quot; requires decoding. If it requires
&gt; decoding, IT IS NOT PLAINTEXT!

"/>

This depends on what you mean by 'decoding', phonetic spelling was
often employed in the crypto of the era, if reading something spelled
phonetically is what you mean by 'decoding' then your statement is not
true.

(Bacon assumed a 24-letter alphabet in

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; his writings about ciphers, by the way).

"/>

This is because the Elizabethan alphabet had only 24 letters. i and j
were not considered 'separate' letters, nor were u and v..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; This is what we would see if we used a &quot;last letter of each word&quot; acrostic
&gt; method honestly:

&gt; SSredTNyGdrTTdeoeeymy9OEERFEGSrWHLEDTEDYRGTHEGRNGHTT

"/>

The above statement is a distortion of the truth. Leary never states
that the acrostic is formed from 'the last letter of every word'. Your
entire post implies that he did and then deviated from it, but this is
not true. Constructing an acrostic from the last letter of every
Capitalized word is a legitimate method as long as it is followed
strictly. and the above statement implies that it is not. If you
really think Leary's cipher isn't valid, then demonstrate it without
the above kinds of tactics.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; While you talk of a &quot;25-letter&quot; string, the &quot;acrostic&quot; that we get when we
&gt; apply the &quot;take-the-last-letter&quot; method faithfully is 52 characters long.
&gt; Why did you jettison 27 of the 52 letters?

"/>

Because the creator of an acrostic is not obliged to use every
possible letter available to him, if some of them fall past the word
or phrase he is constructing. In other words, in a string of say 20
letters one may use only 10 letters as long as those 10 letters run
consecutively. Shakespeare does this in Midsummers Night Dream, with
the name of Titania.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; One part of Leary's cheating was vital -- the selection not of the last
&gt; digit of the date &quot;1609&quot; but of three of the four digits. The &quot;6&quot; (the
&gt; antepenultimate digit) is changed to an &quot;F&quot; and then to a &quot;B&quot;. Without
&gt; the illegitimate (even by Leary's methods) selection of the &quot;6&quot; in order
&gt; to add an illegitimate &quot;B&quot;, Leary would not have had the substring
&gt;&quot;BEKAAN,&quot; which he expects us to accept as the equivalent of &quot;Bacon.&quot;

"/>

I disagree that treating numbers differently than letters is cheating,
as long as one uses a consistent rule for all the numbers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Now let us transform each of these rows using Leary's method.

This is not Leary's method, This is Ross' distortion of Leary's

Who knows? I have never seen your paper; I have never had the opportunity

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; lie.

"/>

No, it is the truth.

I searched my old emails and, to my surprise, DID find something from you
dated &quot;04 Jan 2003,&quot; which I could not remember ever having read before,
but which was not your Leary paper. Your note includes such gems as this:

&quot;Before we continue, I would like to note that a central idea to the
Baconian thesis is that the name 'Shakespeare' was chosen by Bacon,
because he had as a teen devoted his life to the goddess Pallas Athena.
Athena was known as 'hastivibrans' or 'the Spear Shaker' and was usually
depicted brandishing a spear at the snake of ignorance.&quot;

Actually, Athena was NOT known as &quot;hastivibrans&quot; or &quot;the Spear Shaker,&quot;
and there was NOT typically a snake in depictions of her (though one often
finds an owl, which was sacred to her). The term &quot;hastivibrans&quot; was never
used by Virgil or Ovid or any classical author; it was coined in the 17th
Century as a witty tribute to William Shakespeare of Stratford on Avon.
What you call &quot;a central idea of the Baconian thesis&quot; is pure twaddle, but
I suppose that's a good indication of how valuable Baconism is.

At any rate, your note of 04 Jan 2003 does not seem related to Penn
Leary's methods or the Friedmans, and I can find no other note from you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; not only have i repeatedly offered it everyone since this list began, i
&gt; e-mailed the paper to you at the same time i sent it to Veal.

I don't have it, and I don't believe that I ever received it. Of course
you tried to dodge some of Tom's criticisms by saying he had seen only an
early draft, so even if I had seen it (which I have not), you would have
an excuse ready-made for whatever boo-boos I might have pointed out.
Given your inability to type Penn Leary's name correctly, I don't think it
is impossible that you mistyped my email address (if you even tried to
send your paper -- a claim for which we have only your word), or perhaps
you meant to send it but forgot to, as you keep forgetting that there are
two Friedmans, or perhaps it was simply lost in the ether.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If you chose not to read it that's fine, but don't lie about not having
&gt; a chance to do so.

"/>

I think we have all come to expect a certain degree of inaccuracy from you
-- a pardonable fault, but an unfortunate weakness in a cipher-monger. A
lie is a deliberate falsehood. In order to tell a lie, one must utter
what is false while knowing it is false. To the best of my knowledge I
have not said anything false about you, either knowingly or unknowingly.

It is not my style to call those I disagree with &quot;liars.&quot; In one usenet
post you made the false claim that &quot;proposed ciphers meet all of the
criteria for new claims established by William Friedman in his book 'The
Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.'&quot; I would not call this statement a
&quot;lie,&quot; because (I surmise) you did not know that your claim was false.
How could you? I doubt that you have read the Freidmans' book, but even
if you had, you do not seem capable of understanding it. One must have
some understanding of truth in order to be able to lie. As for calling
someone else a liar -- that takes no wit at all, does it?

To repeat what I said,

Since your paper has not been made available to me, I could not have read

to be seriously marred by, among other things, a touching faith in the

By gad, sir, you're a character!

Your persistence has worn me down. I shall now address the matter of

'Bek' is an Old English verb meaning 'beckon.' As I have already
proposed the word 'beckon' as an alternate reading of the 'plaintext'
BEKAAN, I see no reason to suppose that Bacon inexplicably introduced a
verb obsolete for centuries and then followed it with AAN, which is
either misspelled or meaningless. You did mention that you found the
double A significant, but that still leaves the N.

N. BACON...was Francis concealing a message about his brother, or
perhaps his father?

As it happens, I don't believe that Francis, or anyone else, concealed
any ciphers at all anywhere in any of Shakespeare's works. I don't
believe that the letters Penn Leary winkled out of the front matter of
the Sonnets can be shown to have any significance whatsoever beyond the

&gt; within the body of the text ~ unless they are literary allusion,
&gt; rather than cipher ~ no one listening could possibly work them out as
&gt; they were spoken, especially any estranged spelling.

&gt; If, I say 'if', one wanted to deploy a complex mathematical cipher, it
&gt; would logically need to appear on endpapers, posters and hand-bills,
&gt; monuments, and such, where the reader has leisure to decrypt it.
&gt;&lt;right?&gt;

&lt;Wrong.&gt;

It is a rather comic view of Sir Francis, though. Here we have this
unsurpassed genius who (we are told) wrote not only his own works but
Shakespeare's, yet we are to suppose him incapable of creating an
unambiguous message and inserting it into the body of his own work.
Instead, he must impersonate the lowly Thomas Thorpe!

What do you mean? I have never rejected the possibility that Bacon and
Shakespeare may have collaborated; neither have I rejected the
possibility that De Vere and Shakespeare may have collaborated; nor
Marlowe and Shakespeare, nor Jonson and Shakespeare, nor anyone else and
Shakespeare. Perhaps he collaborated with all of them, as he
collaborated with John Fletcher. I should be greatly interested to see
any evidence that it was so.

I was hoping you'd say that!

Della Porta's plaintext alphabet has twenty letters. The supposed Bacon
alphabet has twenty-one. Leary couldn't get his 'decryption' to work
using della Porta's alphabet, so he had to fudge it and throw in a Y.

Does it not strike you as lamentable that even with all of his fudging,
and his disregarding of the rules governing acrostics, Leary could come
up with nothing better than &quot;oonypircypphrsbekaanbacon&quot;? I could
sprinkle corn on a typewriter and let a chicken peck at it and produce
better plaintext than that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an entirely different (unannounced) procedure. That's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; how Marlowe proved he was Shakespeare.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter claims his whatchamacallit is not a cipher, so he

Correct. What I claim it definitely says, however, is that
Christofer Marley is returned, is 'with' Shakspeare in the
monument, and that *he* (i.e. Marley) &quot;hath writt&quot;,
whatever that may mean in such a context.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; As for Peter Farey's procedure, I knew it was exempt
&gt;&gt; from the Friedmans' rules;

"/>

Not being a cipher, it is exempt from those 'rules' which
are clearly applicable only to ciphers. What I found once
I read the Friedmans' book, however, was that part of their
approach to the validation of ciphers would be appropriate
for other forms of concealed message, like the one I found.

In particular, I saw that the demonstration of such a
message's validity requires the key (or clue) to its
solution to be identified, and that it is the probability
of *this key* occurring by chance that is the important
part, and not (as most cipher-searchers seem to think, if
they bother to think about it at all) the probability of
the message itself occurring.

Incidentally, I am currently pursuing the possibility that
a further part of the clue exists, and that odds of the
whole thing happening by chance are well over a billion
(1,000,000,000) to one.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; what it validated, however, was the
&gt;&gt; use of more than one method of text-extraction where
&gt;&gt; required to determine a secret message, whether the message
&gt;&gt; was concealed with ciphers or some combination of wordgame
&gt;&gt; manipulations plus or minus the use of ciphers.

"/>

No of course it doesn't, and I'll assume that you are being
sarcastic. That mine turned out to consist of a series of
different word games, one after the other (and in fact it
now looks as if yet another type has turned up) has nothing
to say about whether similar changes would be acceptable in
a true cipher.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And certainly for those not biased against alternative

Well, I don't go as far as that, Bob, nor does the monument,
but what is important is whether the message was put there
*deliberately*, regardless of what it indicates. And I have
demonstrated, at least to my own satisfaction, that this is
in fact the case.

You have now written ~2000+ words here on a paper you haven't read, and

There is a difference between fair attempt to understand the paper, and any
assessmrnt of the worth the resulting cypher.

It does no credit to 'Strat' researchers if they conduct an investigation
this way. Its not much different than lacking any real attempt to assess
anything contrary to one's own opinion, from a lack of curiosity?

In fact it reflects poorly on any Strat case for authorship if the standards
of assessment are indistinguisable from the researcher's comfort level or
perspicacity.

I think you should provide Joel Dias-Porter an informed response by reading
his paper, since otherwise this investigation reflects more upon 'Strat'
lacksadaisical methodology.

Cordially, Phil Innes

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes. I gave a citation of two transitive Anglo-Saxons verb forms; Bek 'to

BEKNYGE; A beckoning.

There is also a noun BEKENE; a beacon.

&gt; As I have already

Teuch! But this is the point! Both BEK and AAN are Anglo Saxon words, and
both words then current.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Thank you. Though I should doubt that the word was unknown to any romance
reader, and is actually in use in the C21th, though we spell it
&quot;Beck&quot;-and-call.

However, all that is completely unnecessary speculation, because...

There is a word AAN which just happens to mean 'own'. This now becomes more
interesting, no? Since the claim made for the cipher was one of ownership!

(There is also an alternative meaning for AAN; on)

I have 2 text citations of AAN:-

A sterte to his helm and pult him aan,
And to OlyVER thanne a selde.
/MS. Ashmole 33 f.8

Do, cosyn, anon thyn armys aan,
And array the in syker wede.
/ibid f.44

Unless there is a particualr significance of 'the beard growing out of
barley', we can put aside AANE, a citation of which exists in Googe's
Husbandry 1577. f.25

Would you like to reconsider this awhile? It is no discredit to you since
Joel Dias-Porter also failed to recognise the two words as extant C15th.

I am very familiar with the work of Penn Leary, and my discussion
concentrated on a Penn Leary cipher that appears to be central to Joel's
story. I have not claimed to have read Joel's paper -- in fact, I have
repeatedly stated that I have NOT read it. I HAVE, however, read a great
deal of Penn Leary's work -- enough so that even without reading Joel's
paper, I spotted the gibberish string &quot;OONYPIRCYPPHRSBEKAANBACON&quot; as
something that he could only have gotten from Penn Leary. I was the first
to mention Leary on this thread, and both Tom and Joel have confirmed that
Joel does indeed acknowledge his debt to Leary in the paper. I don't know
what else may be in the paper, but I don't have much hope for great things
from someone who thinks Leary ever in his life found valid Shakespearean
ciphers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; There is a difference between fair attempt to understand the paper, and
&gt; any assessmrnt of the worth the resulting cypher.

"/>

I provided a fair assessment of the methods used by Penn Leary, which
(Joel confirms) are an important basis of his own. I did not discuss
whatever other Shakespearean &quot;ciphers&quot; Joel thinks may be valid. In
principle, Joel would agree with me that if the Leary &quot;cipher&quot; cannot meet
all of the Friedmans' standards, it should be rejected. All I was doing
was helping readers see that the proposed cipher is not demonstrably
valid.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; investigation this way. Its not much different than lacking any real
&gt; attempt to assess anything contrary to one's own opinion, from a lack of

"/>

Can you tell me which part of my analysis you think was wrong? I took
some pains to assess the alleged cipher, including showing the results of
every possible &quot;nth-letter&quot; and &quot;nth-from-the-end&quot; letter acrostic, both
straight and as transformed by Leary's methods (or as they would be if
Leary were consistent in his application of those methods). In each case,
the results were qualitatively the same -- every such string of any length
was essentially gibberish in which a few substrings that looked like words
could be found. I cited the Friedmans, whom Joel and Leary acknowledge as
the experts in the field.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In fact it reflects poorly on any Strat case for authorship if the
&gt; standards of assessment are indistinguisable from the researcher's
&gt; comfort level or perspicacity.

"/>

In this area the standards of assessment for any proposed Shakespearean
cipher are those set forth by the Friedmans. The perl scripts that I
wrote to select and transform letters in the dedication have no rooting
interest in Shakespeare or Bacon; they are neutral tools of the kind that
anyone making a serious claim to have found a cipher should employ.

I have provided an informed response on the Penn Leary cipher that Joel
was so dazzled by. In a post to another newsgroup, Joel listed the Leary
&quot;cipher&quot; and &quot;a unique code found on p. 287 of King Lear in the First
Folio.&quot; I have not commented on the &quot;unique code,&quot; but I have shown that
Joel was wrong to claim that the Leary &quot;cipher&quot;&quot;meet[s] all the criteria&quot;
established by the Friedmans.

&gt;&quot;Before we continue, I would like to note that a central idea to the
&gt; Baconian thesis is that the name 'Shakespeare' was chosen by Bacon,
&gt; because he had as a teen devoted his life to the goddess Pallas Athena.
&gt; Athena was known as 'hastivibrans' or 'the Spear Shaker' and was usually
&gt; depicted brandishing a spear at the snake of ignorance.&quot;

&gt; Actually, Athena was NOT known as &quot;hastivibrans&quot; or &quot;the Spear Shaker,&quot;
&gt; and there was NOT typically a snake in depictions of her (though one often
&gt; finds an owl, which was sacred to her). The term &quot;hastivibrans&quot; was never
&gt; used by Virgil or Ovid or any classical author; it was coined in the 17th
&gt; Century as a witty tribute to William Shakespeare of Stratford on Avon.

"/>

All of the above is true, i did write that and the facts are as you
state them, however i had already reached that conclusion and removed
that particular qquote from the paper (you can ask Steese, i sent him

While the 'Hastivibrans' thing wasn't true, I was able to verify that
Athena was connected to 'Spear-shaking', that info is in the latest

Even if that were true (and he ignored three instances of the word

&gt; As I have stated previously the Leary string is not 'central' to my
&gt; thesis.

"/>

Here is what Joel said in a post on another newsgroup:

&quot;I was wondering if any members of this forum might be interested in
evaluating the cryptographic validity of a paper that attempts to
prove that Francis Bacon wrote the works of Shakespeare. The proposed
ciphers meet all of the criteria for new claims established by William
Friedman in his book &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.&quot; Neither of
the cipher systems proposed were evaluated by Friedman because they
hadn't been discovered yet. One is a monoaplphabetic sub. cipher found
by Thomas Leary in the dedication to the Sonnets. The other is a
unique code found on p. 287 of King Lear in the First Folio. I am
aware of the fact that few people take such claims seriously and am
particularly interested in having someone with a strong sense of
scepticism review the paper. Anyone interested should respond to
djreneg ... @hotmail.com and I'll forward a copy of the paper to you.&quot;

Let's see -- he mentions two (count 'em) two ciphers in this post, one of
which is Leary's, the other of which he seems not to consider a cipher but
a &quot;unique code.&quot; He speaks of the ciphers in terms of his &quot;attempt to
prove&quot; that Bacon wrote Shakespeare. Any reader would conclude from this
that Leary's cipher was central to Joel's offer of proof and thus to his
paper.

By the way, this post was to the &quot;sci.crypt&quot; newsgroup. Douglas A. Gwynn
replied to Joel's post thus:

&quot;I've just finished reading Dias-Porter's paper and will be preparing a
review which I will send to him. The bottom line is that I am convinced
that he has *not* found actual embedded clues.&quot;

On January 26, Douglas A Gwynn said,

&quot;the suggested clues are (for the most part) not of a nature that would be
reasonable for an author to choose for such a purpose, are too indirect
and require too much interpretation, and are produced by a methodology
that is but one instance of a whole class whose parameters can be tweaked
to find comparable 'evidence' of any author one wishes, in any large
corpus. Therefore my conclusion is that the investigator has found only a
reflection of his own presupposition, not objective evidence.&quot;

The entire thread may be found at

Joel has not been heard from on sci.crypt, but on this group he continues
to maintain the validity of his work despite my criticisms and those of
the regulars at sci.crypt. He does not accept my criticisms; will he at
least share those of Douglas A. Gwynn? On March 26 he promised &quot;as soon
as i hear back from the cryptograher who is evaluating it, i will make
whatever changes and revisions he suggests and post it. if he says none of
the crypto is valid, i won't post the paper, but i will post a message to
this discussion group giving his analysis.&quot;

What's Joel waiting for?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I provided a fair assessment of the methods used by Penn Leary,

&gt; I strongly disagree with this statement. your definition of an acrostic
&gt; for example is far more narrow than any definition i have seen including

&gt; capitalized word' acrostic appeare to be illegitimate.

"/>

Whether taking the &quot;last letter of every capitalized word&quot; is an
acceptable method in this case is subject to debate, but what is NOT is
that neither Leary nor Joel uses this method. I will elaborate (once
more) below.

Joel was kind enough to send me his paper. He quotes with approval these
words by the Friedmans about two acrostics they DO consider genuine:

&quot;In each case, there is no room to doubt that they were put there by the
deliberate intent of the author; the length of the hidden text, and the
absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear, combine to make it
enormously improbable that they just happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Leary's proposed cipher fails on all counts, as I have shown and will
again below.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; In principle, Joel would agree with me that if the Leary &quot;cipher&quot; cannot meet
&gt;&gt; all of the Friedmans' standards, it should be rejected.

&gt; this statement is true

"/>

Then you must reject the Leary &quot;cipher.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;All I was doing
&gt;&gt; was helping readers see that the proposed cipher is not demonstrably
&gt;&gt; valid.

&gt; This statement is not true.

"/>

Then I will try once more -- this time having the benefit of Joel's paper.
Joel says,

&quot;The capitalized words on the Title page are as follows: Shake-speare's,
Sonnets, Never, Imprinted, AT, LONDON, By, G, Eld T, T, William, Aspley,
1, 6, 9, TO, THE, ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, and MR.&quot;

There are several errors here:

First -- &quot;1,&quot;&quot;6,&quot; and &quot;9&quot; are not &quot;capitalized words,&quot; being neither
&quot;capitalized&quot; nor &quot;words.&quot;

Second -- &quot;TO, THE, ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, and MR&quot;
are not on the title page at all; they are the first nine words of Thomas
Thorpe's dedication.

Third -- Although Joel refers to &quot;the&quot; title page, there are actually two
imprints of *Shakespeares Sonnets*, and the title page of the other has
THESE capitalized words: Shake-speare's, Sonnets, Never, Imprinted, AT,
LONDON, By, G, Eld T, T, Iohn Wright, Christ, Church.&quot;

To remind Joel -- on neither title page are the numerals &quot;1,&quot;&quot;16,&quot; and
&quot;9&quot; capitalized letters.

The Friedmans once more:

&quot;In each case, there is no room to doubt that they were put there by the
deliberate intent of the author; the length of the hidden text, and the
absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear, combine to make it
enormously improbable that they just happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Taking the last letter of each word in order would satisfy the requirement
of an &quot;absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear.&quot; We might even
allow Penn and Joel to take the &quot;9&quot; from the date by considering the date
a sufficiently word-like string, and by taking final &quot;characters&quot; rather
than &quot;letters.&quot; Here are the results of performing this operation on the
two versions of the title page:

Wright imprint: SSredTNyGdrTTdeoeeyntgtthe9

Aspley imprint: SSredTNyGdrTTdeoeeymy9

Here are the same strings transformed by Leary's &quot;four-to-the-left&quot;
method:

Wright imprint: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaaripcppdaE

Aspley imprint: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaarhrE

In each case, the result is the same: gibberish in which a few substrings
that resemble words (e.g., &quot;OON,&quot;&quot;nay,&quot;&quot;yak,&quot;&quot;rip&quot;) may be found.

Now let us omit the last letters of words that are not capitalized. Our

Wright imprint: SSr_dTNyGd_TT______ntgtth_

Aspley imprint: SSr_dTNyGd_TT______my

Does either of these lines comply with the Friedmans' requirement of an
&quot;absolutely rigid order&quot;? I think it is questionable -- but it hardly
matters. Let us now see these strings as transformed by Leary's
&quot;four-to-the-left&quot; method:

Wright imprint: OOn_yPIrCy_PP______ipcppd_

Aspley imprint: OOn_yPIrCy_PP______hr

The result is similar to the gibberish we saw last time. If anything, the
wordlike strings are harder to pick out, but in any event we do not have a
result that is in plaintext.

The Friedmans once more (remember, this is a passage Joel quoted in his
paper):

&quot;In each case [of the two genuine acrostics], there is no room to doubt
that they were put there by the deliberate intent of the author; the
length of the hidden text, and the absolutely rigid order in which the
letters appear, combine to make it enormously improbable that they just
happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Can anyone think there is &quot;no room to doubt&quot; that such gibberish was &quot;put
there by the deliberate intent of the author&quot;?

If Joel wishes, we can continue the selection process on the dedication
page, but this does not help matters. Here are

The capitalized words on the dedication page are as follows: &quot;TO, THE,
ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, Mr, W, H, ALL, HAPPINESSE,
AND, THAT, ETERNITIE, PROMISED, BY, OVR, EVER-LIVING, POET, WISHETH, THE,
WELL-WISHING, ADVENTVRER, IN, SETTING, FORTH, T, T.&quot;

The last letters of these words are

OEERFEGSrWHLEDTEDYRGTHEGRNGHTT

When transformed ala Leary, the string becomes

KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

Gibberish again. Let us tie this string to the title page variants and
see if any of the results turns into plaintext:

The last characters of every word (including &quot;1609&quot;):

Wright: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaaripcppdaE|KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

Aspley: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaarhrE|KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

The last letters of every word that begins with a capital letter:

Wright: OOn_yPIrCy_PP______ipcppd_|KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

Aspley: OOn_yPIrCy_PP______hr|KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

None of these strings meets the Friedmans' standards for plaintext:

&quot;the plain-text solution must make sense, in whatever language it is
supposed to have been written; it must be grammatical ('Hearts green slow
mud' would not do) and it must mean something ('Pain is a brown Sunday'
would not do either). It does not matter whether what the solution says is
true or not; it may be a pack of lies, but that is not the cryptologist's
business. The important thing is that it must say something, and say it
intelligibly.&quot;

None of them says anything at all.

Just in case Terry Ross has better things to do (a rather high
probability), let me summarize some of the weaknesses in Mr.
Dias-Porter's decipherment:

1. The first two letters of his &quot;plaintext&quot;, &quot;OO&quot;, are meaningless and
seem to have been included only in order to make the string 25 letters
long (thus meeting one of the Friedmans' criteria for a valid cipher).
Mr. Dias-Porter asserts in his paper that &quot;OO&quot; means that the message
is doubly enciphered (i.e., an acrostic transformed by a substitution
cipher) but presents no evidence that anyone, in the 17th Century or
at any other time, gave that meaning to those letters. Nor does his
explanation make sense: The hypothethical decipherer is given this
clue only *after* he has solved the second cipher and doesn't need it.

2. The acrostic is supposedly based on the last letters of each
capitalized word, but all of the capitalizations are perfectly
ordinary. If the capitalization were idiosyncratic, that might be a
signal that one should probe the text more deeply, but no one who
planted *this* acrostic could have any realistic expectation that it
would ever be found. Or did Bacon foresee the rise, over 200 years
after his death, of unwearying Baconian cryptography?

3. Three letters of the plaintext are derived not from the last
letters of capitalized words but from three of the four digits of a
number. As Mr. Dias-Porter observes, a valid cipher might treat
letters and numbers differently, but one expects some analogy in how
they are handled. The procedure that he posits is wholly arbitrary.
Again, it is impossible to see how the encipherer could ever hope that
his cipher would be recognized.

4. The purported plaintext is not, as Mr. Dias-Porter asserts,
recognizable though misspelled; it is mere gibberish open to a variety
of interpretations. Penn Leary has one. Mr. Dias-Porter has another.
Mark Steese and I had no trouble coming up with more. The Dias-Porter
paper suggests that various numerical coincidences furnish the key,
but someone who didn't know the &quot;right&quot; answer in advance could not
work through all of the possible numbers in a reasonable length of
time.

5. Mr. Dias-Porter's reading, &quot;OO Napier ciphers beacon Bacon&quot; is
uninformative. He concedes that he doesn't know what a &quot;Napier cipher&quot;
might be. He certainly doesn't claim to have found any of them
anywhere. If, as he thinks, &quot;ciphers&quot; is a noun and &quot;beacon&quot; a verb,
we are perhaps being told that we will find &quot;Bacon&quot; in the vicinity of
&quot;Napier ciphers&quot;, which is not exactly lucid. Alternatively, &quot;ciphers&quot;
might be a verb and &quot;beacon&quot; an adjective, so that Napier has ciphered
the beacon-like Bacon. The question is, are these readings pictures in
the clouds or a message intentionally inserted for the enlightenment
of readers? The answer doesn't seem to me to be much in doubt.

6. Finally, it should be noted that, in order for this &quot;cipher&quot; to
work, the encipherer needed to be able to select the publisher,
printer and bookseller, all of whose names are part of the &quot;acrostic&quot;.
That is a lot of trouble to take when anyone as ingenious as Sir
Francis Bacon could have encrypted his message into, say, the first
sonnet. (As it happens, half of the surviving copies of the First
Quarto of the Sonnets bear the name of a different bookseller, &quot;John
Wright, dwelling at Christ Church gate&quot;.)

All in all, it is very hard to take seriously anyone who gives serious
weight to a &quot;secret message&quot; like this one.

It rather looks that way. He claims that there is an Anglo-Saxon word

If there are any attested Anglo-Saxon words with a double a, they are
exceptionally well-hidden: of all the Germanic languages, I believe Dutch
is the only one that regularly uses &quot;aa.&quot; In fact, the only language in
which &quot;aan&quot; means anything is Dutch. And &quot;bek&quot; is a Dutch word as well!
Aha! The cryptogram is actually a scurrilous insult against Bacon,

the notorious Netherlander, Frans Spek.

You must have stopped reading the thread. The alleged cipher does not
preceed by rigorous methods and its results are in any event not
&quot;plaintext.&quot; When we DO apply rigorous methods, we get a variety of
similar results: gibberish in which a few substrings that resemble English
words may be plucked out by inspection.

Hi Mark, what's written above is actually in disagreement with Joel.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but may I ask when it was pointed out that &quot;oo,&quot;&quot;nypir,&quot; and
&gt;&quot;cypphrs&quot; were real words? Don't keep us in suspense, Phil -- what did
&gt; they mean in &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot;?

"/>

Let me make a few things clear here, Mark.

I am interested in an earlier period, and in antiquarian studies which
sometimes preceed any written record, but certainly in writing of the C11th
to C15th where Anglo Saxon was the primary language in England (supplemented
earlier by Latin and French).

In order to grapple with this material there needs to be a displayed method
of research in order to promote even just a thesis, never mind a proof,
otherwise we are in a von Daniken-wonderland of more or less informed
speculation beyond any resolution.

What interested me in Joel's paper was (1) an open statement of his method.
Naturally (2) scrutiny and diligence is then necessary to evaluate the
veracity of the method, and I only decided to write about it here because
other's seem to quibble about his citations more than what he himself wrote.
I did in fact have (3) a few demurs after reading the paper, and these are
mostly of the nature 'second sourcing'. I notice that others then continued
to commit the same /methodogical/ 'offence' in being overly prescriptive in
their evaluations without (4) conducting primary research.

Unless these terms aren't clear, and since these things occur in any
abstruse range of inquiry, let me contrast them a bit more:- primary
researchers all look to whatever is the origin in question [fons et origo],
whereas secondary researching cites varieties of opinion, not always of
primary researchers, but often of other secondary researchers.

As a methodology citing secondary sources has little to recommend it if
primary research is available and can possibly be conducted. This is all
logical, no? and not at all controversial as a statement of optimum
procedure as perhaps you can verify from your own knowledge of other fields
of inquiry.

I say all this since (6) quoting secondary sources as we have mostly done
here often leads to no more than great equivocation, and my intent in
writing all this is &lt;stress&gt; that being so bullishly prescriptive &lt;unstress&gt;
is thereby unwarranted.

Okay! If you haven't nodded off..........

I think you do not quibble with (7) BEK~AAN as A.Sax words. If they in fact
meant 'slept in a fish-market' they would be more difficult to accept,
however, since they can be resolved as &quot;commit to own&quot; in a cipher about
identity, this would be an extraordinary coincidence, and suggestive of
other A.Sax possibilities such as (8) &quot;OO&quot; and on which I posted a text
citation on 2/4/04

And at oo worde sche platly gan him telle
The childis myzte his power dide eccelle

In fact OO, OON, OONE are all A. Sax. and OO means 'one', which in turn can
be either a number or figured as a possessive pronoun.

I think this is a fair summary of my own comments. I also think that none of
the above is absolute, but as before, is best refuted by primary research
rather than the equivocations of second-sourcing.

Cordially, Phil Innes

&gt;&gt; I am very familiar with the work of Penn Leary, and my discussion
&gt;&gt; concentrated on a Penn Leary cipher that appears to be central to Joel's
&gt;&gt; story.
&gt; As I have stated previously the Leary string is not 'central' to my
&gt; thesis.

"/>

Here is what Joel said in a post on another newsgroup:

&quot;I was wondering if any members of this forum might be interested in
evaluating the cryptographic validity of a paper that attempts to prove
that Francis Bacon wrote the works of Shakespeare. The proposed ciphers
meet all of the criteria for new claims established by William Friedman in
his book &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.&quot; Neither of the cipher
systems proposed were evaluated by Friedman because they hadn't been
discovered yet. One is a monoaplphabetic sub. cipher found by Thomas Leary
in the dedication to the Sonnets. The other is a unique code found on p.
287 of King Lear in the First Folio. I am aware of the fact that few
people take such claims seriously and am particularly interested in having
someone with a strong sense of scepticism review the paper. Anyone
interested should respond to djreneg ... @hotmail.com and I'll forward a
copy of the paper to you.&quot;

Let's see -- he mentions two (count 'em) two ciphers in this post, one of
which is Leary's, the other of which he seems not to consider a cipher but
a &quot;unique code.&quot; He speaks of the ciphers in terms of his &quot;attempt to
prove&quot; that Bacon wrote Shakespeare. Any reader would conclude from this
that Leary's cipher was central to Joel's offer of proof and thus to his
paper.

By the way, this post was to the &quot;sci.crypt&quot; newsgroup. Douglas A. Gwynn
replied to Joel's post thus:

&quot;I've just finished reading Dias-Porter's paper and will be preparing a
review which I will send to him. The bottom line is that I am convinced
that he has *not* found actual embedded clues.&quot;

On January 26, Douglas A Gwynn said,

&quot;the suggested clues are (for the most part) not of a nature that would be
reasonable for an author to choose for such a purpose, are too indirect
and require too much interpretation, and are produced by a methodology
that is but one instance of a whole class whose parameters can be tweaked
to find comparable 'evidence' of any author one wishes, in any large
corpus. Therefore my conclusion is that the investigator has found only a
reflection of his own presupposition, not objective evidence.&quot;

The entire thread may be found at

Joel has not been heard from on sci.crypt, but on this group he continues
to maintain the validity of his work despite my criticisms and those of
the regulars at sci.crypt. He does not accept my criticisms; will he at
least share those of Douglas A. Gwynn? On March 26 he promised &quot;as soon
as i hear back from the cryptograher who is evaluating it, i will make
whatever changes and revisions he suggests and post it. if he says none of
the crypto is valid, i won't post the paper, but i will post a message to
this discussion group giving his analysis.&quot;

What's Joel waiting for?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I provided a fair assessment of the methods used by Penn Leary,

&gt; I strongly disagree with this statement. your definition of an acrostic
&gt; for example is far more narrow than any definition i have seen including
&gt; the Friedman's. this was done to make Leary's 'last letter of every
&gt; capitalized word' acrostic appeare to be illegitimate.

"/>

Whether taking the &quot;last letter of every capitalized word&quot; is an
acceptable method in this case is subject to debate, but what is NOT is
that neither Leary nor Joel uses this method rigorously. I will elaborate
(once more) below.

Joel was kind enough to send me his paper. He quotes with approval these
words by the Friedmans about two acrostics they DO consider genuine:

&quot;In each case, there is no room to doubt that they were put there by the
deliberate intent of the author; the length of the hidden text, and the
absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear, combine to make it
enormously improbable that they just happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Leary's proposed cipher fails on all counts, as I have shown and will
again below.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; In principle, Joel would agree with me that if the Leary &quot;cipher&quot;
&gt;&gt; cannot meet all of the Friedmans' standards, it should be rejected.

&gt; this statement is true

"/>

Then you must reject the Leary &quot;cipher.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; All I was doing was helping readers see that the proposed cipher is
&gt;&gt; not demonstrably valid.

&gt; This statement is not true.

"/>

Then I will try once more -- this time having the benefit of Joel's paper.
Joel says,

&quot;The capitalized words on the Title page are as follows: Shake-speare's,
Sonnets, Never, Imprinted, AT, LONDON, By, G, Eld T, T, William, Aspley,
1, 6, 9, TO, THE, ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, and MR.&quot;

There are several errors here:

First -- &quot;1,&quot;&quot;6,&quot; and &quot;9&quot; are not &quot;capitalized words,&quot; being neither
&quot;capitalized&quot; nor &quot;words.&quot;

Second -- &quot;TO, THE, ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, and MR&quot;
are not on the title page at all; they are the first nine words of Thomas
Thorpe's dedication.

Third -- Although Joel refers to &quot;the&quot; title page, there are actually two
imprints of *Shakespeares Sonnets*, and the title page of the other has
THESE capitalized words: Shake-speare's, Sonnets, Never, Imprinted, AT,
LONDON, By, G, Eld T, T, Iohn Wright, Christ, Church.&quot;

To remind Joel -- on neither title page are the numerals &quot;1,&quot;&quot;16,&quot; and
&quot;9&quot; capitalized letters.

The Friedmans once more:

&quot;In each case, there is no room to doubt that they were put there by the
deliberate intent of the author; the length of the hidden text, and the
absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear, combine to make it
enormously improbable that they just happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Taking the last letter of each word in order would satisfy the requirement
of an &quot;absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear.&quot; If we were
reckless or generous enough, we might even allow Penn and Joel to take the
&quot;9&quot; from the date by considering the date a sufficiently word-like string,
and by taking final &quot;characters&quot; rather than &quot;letters.&quot; Here are the
results of performing this operation on the two versions of the title
page:

Wright imprint: SSredTNyGdrTTdeoeeyntgtthe9

Aspley imprint: SSredTNyGdrTTdeoeeymy9

Here are the same strings transformed by Leary's &quot;four-to-the-left&quot;
method:

Wright imprint: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaaripcppdaE

Aspley imprint: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaarhrE

In each case, the result is the same: gibberish in which a few substrings
that resemble words (e.g., &quot;OON,&quot;&quot;nay,&quot;&quot;yak,&quot;&quot;rip&quot;) may be found.
Neither result would satisfy the Friedmans' standards for &quot;plaintext.&quot;

Now let us omit the last letters of words that are not capitalized.
Since &quot;1609&quot; is neither capitalized nor a word, we will not take its &quot;9.&quot;

Wright imprint: SSr_dTNyGd_TT______ntgtth_

Aspley imprint: SSr_dTNyGd_TT______my

Does either of these lines comply with the Friedmans' requirement of an
&quot;absolutely rigid order&quot;? I think it is questionable -- but it hardly
matters. Let us now see these strings as transformed by Leary's
&quot;four-to-the-left&quot; method:

Wright imprint: OOn_yPIrCy_PP______ipcppd_

Aspley imprint: OOn_yPIrCy_PP______hr

The result is similar to the gibberish we saw last time. If anything, the
wordlike strings are harder to pick out, but in any event we do not have a
result that meets the Friedmans' standards for plaintext.

The Friedmans once more (remember, this is a passage Joel quoted in his
paper):

&quot;In each case [of the two genuine acrostics], there is no room to doubt
that they were put there by the deliberate intent of the author; the
length of the hidden text, and the absolutely rigid order in which the
letters appear, combine to make it enormously improbable that they just
happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Can anyone think there is &quot;no room to doubt&quot; that such gibberish was &quot;put
there by the deliberate intent of the author&quot;?

If Joel wishes, we can continue the selection process on the dedication
page, but this does not help matters.

The capitalized words on the dedication page are as follows: &quot;TO, THE,
ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, Mr, W, H, ALL, HAPPINESSE,
AND, THAT, ETERNITIE, PROMISED, BY, OVR, EVER-LIVING, POET, WISHETH, THE,
WELL-WISHING, ADVENTVRER, IN, SETTING, FORTH, T, T.&quot;

The last letters of these words are

OEERFEGSrWHLEDTEDYRGTHEGRNGHTT

When transformed ala Leary, the string becomes

KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

Gibberish again. Let us tie this string to the title page variants and
see if any of the results turns into plaintext:

The last characters of every word (including &quot;1609&quot;):

Wright: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaaripcppdaE|KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

Aspley: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaarhrE|KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

The last letters of every word that begins with a capital letter:

Wright: OOn_yPIrCy_PP______ipcppd_|KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

Aspley: OOn_yPIrCy_PP______hr|KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

None of these strings meets the Friedmans' standards for plaintext:

&quot;the plain-text solution must make sense, in whatever language it is
supposed to have been written; it must be grammatical ('Hearts green slow
mud' would not do) and it must mean something ('Pain is a brown Sunday'
would not do either). It does not matter whether what the solution says is
true or not; it may be a pack of lies, but that is not the cryptologist's
business. The important thing is that it must say something, and say ...

&gt; 3. Three letters of the plaintext are derived not from the last letters

"/>

A valid cipher might be based on letters and ignore numerals; a valid
cipher might be based on characters and treat numerals and letters alike,
but if a proposed cipher &quot;treats them differently&quot; then it is two ciphers
rather than one. It is typical of Leary's work that he constantly shifts
cipher methods in order to pluck characters he wishes to have or to pass
over those that are not sufficiently helpful. In other words, he cheats.

According to the Friedmans,

In every acrostic, the rules for selecting the letters of the secret text
are invariable, and the selection follows a fixed pattern; moreover, the
selected letters are chosen in a particular order, and the rules for
setting them out in the form of a text are rigid and inflexible. It is
never a matter of taking, say, the first letter of the first line, the
seventh and tenth of the second line, and the fourth of the third line;
nor is it a matter of rearranging these letters until we find an anagram
of them which makes sense. This must be true of any acrostic whose
existence is not to be open to doubt.

Penn Leary (and therefore Joel) wishes to select the last letter from
words (treating initials as &quot;words&quot;) 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13,
20, and 21 of the Aspley title page. Where is the &quot;fixed pattern&quot; here?
Leary (and therefore Joel) then wishes to select the first, second, and
fourth digits of the date. This is a completely different method of
selection, and no &quot;3-character cipher&quot; can be considered valid.

Leary (and thus Joel) is now finished with the title page, and Leary now
moves to the dedication, where he once again uses a variety of different
methods of selection. He begins by taking the last letters from words 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. He then shifts to other methods, just as he
had when he came to the date on the title page. If one wished to use a
&quot;rigorous&quot; method, then one would continue for the remaining 21 words of
the dedication -- but Joel does not do this. Where is the key that
compels him to stop?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but one expects some analogy in how they are handled. The procedure that
&gt; he posits is wholly arbitrary.

"/>

This is certainly true.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Again, it is impossible to see how the encipherer could ever hope that
&gt; his cipher would be recognized.

"/>

There is no reason to posit any &quot;encipherer,&quot; even hypothetically. It is
Leary's job (or Joel's) to produce a demonstrably valid cipher according
the the standards set forth by the Friedmans -- standards to which both
Leary and Joel pretend allegiance. They have failed on all counts, and
the proposed cipher (or pastiche of ciphers) must be rejected.

Gwyn has already gone on record stating that he is &quot;convinced&quot; that you
have &quot;*not* found actual embedded clues.&quot; Moreover, according to Gwyn,
&quot;the suggested clues are (for the most part) not of a nature that would be
reasonable for an author to choose for such a purpose, are too indirect
and require too much interpretation, and are produced by a methodology
that is but one instance of a whole class whose parameters can be tweaked
to find comparable 'evidence' of any author one wishes, in any large
corpus. Therefore my conclusion is that the investigator has found only a
reflection of his own presupposition, not objective evidence.&quot;

As my own analysis and those of other readers on this newsgroup have shown
repeatedly, your proposed &quot;cipher&quot; does not satisfy the conditions set
forth by the Friedmans -- conditions you profess to accept.

It is now time for you to join us in rejecting the proposed &quot;cipher.&quot;

have found two attestations of the word &quot;aan&quot; in a single Middle English

than an idiosyncrasy of the scribe in question? And what reason do you

*If* they could be so resolved, it would be an interesting coincidence, but
they can't. And of course you're presupposing that the cipher was &quot;about

in the first place.

But I do owe you an apology. I was wrong about double-a words in Anglo-

I accused you of ignorance in this matter when my own ignorance was at

&gt;&gt; Let me make a few things clear here, Mark.

&gt;&gt; I am interested in an earlier period, and in antiquarian studies which
&gt;&gt; sometimes preceed any written record, but certainly in writing of the
&gt;&gt; C11th to C15th where Anglo Saxon was the primary language in England
&gt;&gt; (supplemented earlier by Latin and French).

You did snip my post Mark, and your use of 'anglo-saxon' not explicit. There

You also went on about visiting Mr Brennen too.

So *yes* you *did* mention his name. Yes you *did* threaten him, both
with the FBI(!) and with &quot;something sharper than wit&quot;. Yes you *did*
threaten to visit him. I can't say I am surprised that you wound him

examine the manuscript in question.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's why I said &quot;otherwise-unattested,&quot; Philsy. (What manner of

So, no reason, then. I didn't think so.

&quot;Aan&quot; was not extant in the 15th Century: even if your citation is
correct (I'm still waiting for the tickets), all it demonstrates is that
one scribe spelled two different words &quot;aan&quot; in a single manuscript of
the 14th Century.

Look up air fares from the local airport to Oxford? Certainly. You're

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You gave two citations of a scribal spelling for 'aan' (meaning two
different things), and no citations at all for the spelling 'bek.' Hop
to it!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; And of course you're presupposing that the cipher was &quot;about

I am wrong about the Italian part; it was actually a Latin phrasebook for

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; my translations are from C. O. Sylvester Mawson, [1870-1938] copyright
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1934, Litt. D, PhD.

&gt;&gt; Okay, Phil's given the author and a copyright date, but he's neglected
&gt;&gt; to mention the _title_ of Mawson's work from which he got his
&gt;&gt; translation.

&gt;&gt; What is that title?

&gt; why do you ask? isn't this an equal question?

"/>

More to the point, why don't you answer? You spend scores of lines taking
little digs at Sharon and everyone else, teasing with little snippets like
&quot;wrong!&quot; and &quot;if only you knew&quot; before finally completing the half
reference that you failed to cite earlier. This reference then is:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; try berlitz, ed. Katharine Manson, ISBN 0-690-00171-2
&gt; Dictionary of Foreign Terms 1934. poor Mawson was a wonder of his age

"/>

So a quick check shows this to be the out of print second edition (1987) of
the 1972 Berlitz dictionary of foreign terms, updated from the 1934 work by
Mawson. Not surprising that we could not identify it from the misleading
information you gave us earlier. I find I must agree with Sharon's analysis
- that you deliberately obfuscated the reference to make it appear as if
Mawson were some Latin authority, whereas the fact is quite different.

This little work is called &quot;a dictionary of foreign terms&quot;, but let us be
quite clear: it is neither a Latin dictionary, nor a language dictionary in
the classical sense. Rather it is a list of foreign terms and phrases in
&quot;everyday&quot; English usage (everyday in 1934 literary circles maybe, but not
quite what one might hear in the Millennium stadium at weekends!)

So now the mystery is explained: why would a dictionary list phrases like
the one under discussion? The answer is that this is not really a
dictionary as such, but rather a kind of glossary of foreign terms in
English usage.

When Phil insists that he is using a dictionary, we note that he is not
using a *Latin* dictionary!

But I wonder if Phil would be so good as to type out the definition under
&quot;Litem lite resolvere&quot; from his Berlitz guide? Such would be most
interesting!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In other words, Stephen guessed correctly about Phil's source -- it is a
&gt;&gt; phrasebook, albeit an English one rather than an Italian one.

&gt; wrong!!

Look Mark - you snipped my previous post on first and second sourcing.

Predictably second sourcing focuses less and less on the text in question,
and devolves into equivocating about commentators. If you want to play
around with second sourcing as a sole means of research, go ahead! I already
admitted no further interest in doing so myself.

[First there were no such words as.... then you admit there are, then you
continue to quibble about the citations... and want me to fly you to Oxford
... there were no AAs in Anglo Saxon, which you later admit there are, as
well as other AAs in middle English... extant words which Bacon could use
whether they originated in 'middle-English' or A.Sax or whatever.]

Any acuity in the discussion of the purported cipher would resolve around
the fact that these words existed, and if they have any cogent sense beyond
a random occurrence. Anything else is just Usenet blagh.

You inquire below what citation dictionary: Halliwell, published 1850.

&gt;&gt; Oh dear. :))))

&gt; Yes, that's rather a problem for you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you do not quibble with (7) BEK~AAN as A.Sax words.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, I find no indication that *either* word was
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anglo-Saxon, but then I actually understand what Anglo-Saxon means.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You claim to have found two attestations of the word &quot;aan&quot; in a
&gt;&gt;&gt; single Middle English manuscript.

&gt;&gt; Did you snip them, again? &lt;snore&gt; Claim?&quot;??????????????

&gt; Yes..............

&gt;&gt; I GAVE CITATIONS. What manner of reader are you?

&gt; The manner of reader who doesn't trust your citations. Also the manner
&gt; of reader who rarely has access to the Bodleian, and so is unable to
&gt; examine the manuscript in question.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Assuming your transcription to be accurate,

&gt;&gt; I GAVE CITATIONS!

&gt; Are you willing to pay my airfare to Oxford so I can check your
&gt; citations? I'd be greatly obliged.

&gt;&gt;&gt; what reason do you have for supposing this otherwise-unattested

&gt;&gt; Unattested??! I gave citations.

&gt; That's why I said &quot;otherwise-unattested,&quot; Philsy. (What manner of
&gt; reader are you?)

&gt;&gt; I also suggested you get off your mouth and go and look them up. Do
&gt;&gt; some work and stop flapping!

&gt; I'll have to do quite a bit of flapping to get to the Bodleian if you
&gt; don't pay my airfare.

&gt;&gt;&gt; spelling is anything other than an idiosyncrasy of the scribe in
&gt;&gt;&gt; question? And what reason do you have to suppose that Bacon ever saw
&gt;&gt;&gt; the manuscript in question?

&gt;&gt; ROFL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

&gt; So, no reason, then. I didn't think so.

&gt;&gt; You snipped my post about secondary sourcing, but here you go... What
&gt;&gt; reason do I have that Bacon would have known words extant in the
&gt;&gt; C15th......

&gt;&quot;Aan&quot; was not extant in the 15th Century: even if your citation is
&gt; correct (I'm still waiting for the tickets), all it demonstrates is that
&gt; one scribe spelled two different words &quot;aan&quot; in a single manuscript of
&gt; the 14th Century.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If they in fact meant 'slept in a fish-market' they would be more
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; difficult to accept, however, since they can be resolved as &quot;commit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to own&quot; in a cipher about identity, this would be an extraordinary
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; coincidence,

&gt;&gt;&gt; *If* they could be so resolved, it would be an interesting
&gt;&gt;&gt; coincidence,

&gt;&gt; So look em up and let me know.

&gt; Look up air fares from the local airport to Oxford? Certainly. You're
&gt; in luck! Round-trip fare can be had for as little as $569 (plus coach
&gt; fare to Oxford). I generously offer to pay for my own lodging, and I do
&gt; accept PayPal. Hop to it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; but they can't.

&gt;&gt; WHAT? I gave you CITATIONS of a text.

&gt; You gave two citations of a scribal spelling for 'aan' (meaning two
&gt; different things), and no citations at all for the spelling 'bek.' Hop
&gt; to it!

&gt;&gt;&gt; And of course you're presupposing that the cipher was &quot;about
&gt;&gt;&gt; identity&quot; -- for that matter, you're presupposing that there was a
&gt;&gt;&gt; cipher in the first place.

&gt;&gt; A monkey wrote it! the last 3 words of the cipher being I commit
&gt;&gt; (admit to) own Bacon. Clever monkey!

&gt; I doubt if Penn Leary appreciates your characterization of him. He is
&gt; an ape, as are we all. But perhaps you, as a disciple of Rupert
&gt; Sheldrake, find fault with evolutionary biology (with all that emphasis
&gt; on bio-mechanics).

&gt;&gt;&gt; But I do owe you an apology. I was wrong about double-a words in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Anglo- Saxon; there are a few, e.g., aac &quot;oak,&quot; and aaþ, &quot;oath.&quot; I
&gt;&gt;&gt; am sorry that I accused you of ignorance in this matter when my own
&gt;&gt;&gt; ignorance was at fault.

&gt;&gt; You did snip my post Mark,

&gt; I did my best to spare you the embarrassment of having even more people
&gt; see that you thought the tale of Sir Ferumbras was written in Anglo-
&gt; Saxon. Not that I was expecting gratitude, of course.

&gt;&gt; and your use of 'anglo-saxon' not explicit.

&gt; There seems to be a verb missing. I use &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; correctly, as the
&gt; name of a language (also called Old English) which died out c. 1100,
&gt; replaced by Middle English, which begat Early Modern English, which
&gt; begat Modern English.

&gt;&gt; There are four main influences on theat language; the south, the
&gt;&gt; north, celtic western, and celtic northern (Scots and Irish
&gt;&gt; influences).

&gt; And not one of them is relevant to Ashmole ms. 33, which is not only
&gt; composed in Middle English (and late Middle English, at that), but is
&gt; also a translation from a French original (&quot;Fierabras&quot;).

&gt;&gt; There are 24 AAs recorded in my dictionary.

&gt; Which dictionary are you using?

&gt;&gt; I will not reply again until you investigate the content. Why should
&gt;&gt; I?

And, to correct you again, the claim I have NO Latin is false. I have very
small Latin. However, one does not need to be fluent in Latin to doubt your

doubt your Latin. In short, Phil, you are a fraud.

Consider this post.

&amp; a few days ago you did nothing other than attack the writer in four
seperate messages in this newsgroup, never addressing any subject.

Yesterday you made yet another demonstration about a Latin translation. Then
had to admit you were wrong. But why prosecute the subject in the first
place? What's Neil Brennen's interest in, or knowledge of, the subject? Ipso
facto, denigrating the writer of posts you don't even understand is
ad-hominem.

You don't deny you chase around from newsgroup to newsgroup bad-mouthing the
person, not addressing any content. You then invent arguments, not based on
what something means, but whether a person had any business quoting Mawson
from a particular book. Why on earth not? He was quite an eminent scholar,
and the Berlitz book a quality one of its time.

I have no doubt about the translation, I don't know why you or 'Sharon' have
occasioned such abuse over it. I suspect it has nothing to do with your
understanding or interest in the phrase Litem lite resolvere.

to settle strife by strife; explain one obscurity by another : /Horace/
(adapted). Mawson.

WHEREAS: J.R.V. Marchant (Wadham Coll. Oxford) and Joseph F. Charles
(Master, City of London School) resolve the phrase in their Latin/English
dictionary, page 320;-

to illustrate one obscure point by another, /Hor/.

I recently heard a senior Canadian academic bewail current investigatory
conduct in universities; &quot;Once&quot; he said, &quot;everyone would congregate at the
University, students of every level, faculty and sundry non-academic
experts, and together investigate the subject, not each other! But these
days everyone wants to write why no one else should write!&quot; [paraphrased
from radio]

I propose to you, and anyone else, the same sentiment that we are all
fallible researchers, but what can be known to be true lies not by focussing
on other's fallibility, but on attending to the primary subject ourselves.

Phil Innes

&quot;In Hell there are always shortages; in Heaven there is exactly enough.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; More to the point, why don't you answer? You spend scores of lines taking
&gt; little digs at Sharon and everyone else, teasing with little snippets like
&gt;&quot;wrong!&quot; and &quot;if only you knew&quot; before finally completing the half
&gt; reference that you failed to cite earlier. This reference then is:

&gt;&gt; try berlitz, ed. Katharine Manson, ISBN 0-690-00171-2
&gt;&gt; Dictionary of Foreign Terms 1934. poor Mawson was a wonder of his age

&gt; So a quick check shows this to be the out of print second edition (1987)
of
&gt; the 1972 Berlitz dictionary of foreign terms, updated from the 1934 work
by
&gt; Mawson. Not surprising that we could not identify it from the misleading
&gt; information you gave us earlier. I find I must agree with Sharon's
analysis
&gt; - that you deliberately obfuscated the reference to make it appear as if
&gt; Mawson were some Latin authority, whereas the fact is quite different.

&gt; This little work is called &quot;a dictionary of foreign terms&quot;, but let us be
&gt; quite clear: it is neither a Latin dictionary, nor a language dictionary
in
&gt; the classical sense. Rather it is a list of foreign terms and phrases in
&gt;&quot;everyday&quot; English usage (everyday in 1934 literary circles maybe, but not
&gt; quite what one might hear in the Millennium stadium at weekends!)

&gt; So now the mystery is explained: why would a dictionary list phrases like
&gt; the one under discussion? The answer is that this is not really a
&gt; dictionary as such, but rather a kind of glossary of foreign terms in
&gt; English usage.

&gt; When Phil insists that he is using a dictionary, we note that he is not
&gt; using a *Latin* dictionary!

&gt; But I wonder if Phil would be so good as to type out the definition under
&gt;&quot;Litem lite resolvere&quot; from his Berlitz guide? Such would be most
&gt; interesting!

&gt;&gt;&gt; In other words, Stephen guessed correctly about Phil's source -- it is
a
&gt;&gt;&gt; phrasebook, albeit an English one rather than an Italian one.

&gt;&gt; wrong!!

&gt; Actually right!
&gt; *************************

&gt;&gt; Anything beyond your own understanding is a lie, no? Which is mostly
&gt;&gt; everything.

&gt;&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; surely someone has assured him the poet meant otherwise, and so he
is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; convinced to offer 'Italian phrasebook' hoping he may be right :)))
&gt;&gt;&gt; ROFL!!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [what an imbecile!]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is the usual idiocy and expected ad hominenem misrepresentation
&gt; from
&gt;&gt;&gt; Mr.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stalker (4 years!) who ventures to a Cornish newsgroup and also a
&gt; Celtic
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; studies one where he never posted before, to volunteer his ignornant
&gt;&gt;&gt; malice.

&gt;&gt; You do not deny STALKING, and do not address your own LYING. I am going
to
&gt;&gt; make it clear to everyone here what a LIAR you are.

&gt; Go ahead.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And again, the subject of the discussion I joined in on
&gt;&gt; soc.culture.Cornish
&gt;&gt;&gt; was YOUR POSTINGS TO OTHER NEWSGROUPS! And here is part of the
&gt; discussion
&gt;&gt;&gt; from that time:

&gt;&gt; Here is an admission of stalking!

&gt; Not at all.

&gt; You never have anything substantive to say
&gt;&gt; beyond ad hominem - 4 here in one day without the slightest atempt to
&gt;&gt; address any subject, and when people offer to sue you, you dissapear for
a
&gt;&gt; few days. :))

&gt; Actually Phil, you claimed three people were going to sue me, I mentioned
&gt; the Vermont State Police, and you retracted the claim. It's all on Google.
&gt; As for my being off-line, I moved and didn't have my computer hooked up.

&gt;&gt; What a worm!

&gt;&gt; If you want to find out about who moderates internet postings call the
&gt;&gt; police department and they will refer you to the FBI.

&gt; I doubt the FBI &quot;moderates&quot; HLAS.

&gt;&gt; If you keep stalking me I will certainly take note of it. And something
&gt;&gt; sharper than wit is a _writ_.

&gt;&gt; There was actual stalking of my family which you instigated and
&gt; continually
&gt;&gt; mock. You are beneath any contempt.

&gt; Please note this claim that I was involved in criminal activity is libel
on
&gt; the part of Mr. Innes.

&gt;&gt; Since I requested in a post that you take note of your own issue in a
&gt; thread
&gt;&gt; 'legal sense and nonsense' you have posted the most amazing filth and
&gt; lies.

&gt;&gt; Go ahead, make my day!

&gt;&gt; Phil Innes

&gt;&gt;&gt; *************
&gt;&gt;&gt; His I-ness Phil Innes spewed:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the mr brennan who posted here is reacting to the fact that i posted
in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;another newsgroup - did not mention his name or make any prevocative
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;statements that are known to be causus belli for him. the anon poster
&gt; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;also evident in the other newsgroup - curious isn't it?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hmm... this is what you wrote (among other things):

&gt;&gt;&gt; + The FBI will possibly in touch with you Brennen; for your own
&gt;&gt;&gt; + expressions seem to inexplicably engender abuse of others
&gt;&gt;&gt; + (not only myself). But for myself, I simply offer you the reflection
&gt;&gt;&gt; + that their are sharper things than wit.
&gt;&gt;&gt; +
&gt;&gt;&gt; + And if you f*** with me and mine I will certainly make entirely
&gt;&gt;&gt; + sure you understand me without a shadow of a doubt.

&gt;&gt;&gt; [*** is my editing. Posting found with groups.google.com]

&gt;&gt;&gt; You also went on about visiting Mr Brennen too.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So *yes* you *did* mention his name. Yes you *did* threaten him, both
&gt;&gt;&gt; with the FBI(!) and with &quot;something sharper than wit&quot;. Yes you *did*
&gt;&gt;&gt; threaten to visit him. I can't say I am surprised that you wound him
&gt;&gt;&gt; up sufficiently that he felt the need to warn us about your
&gt;&gt;&gt; activities!

I'm afraid I owe Plil an apology, for too readily assuming that all his
pronouncements were of the same quality. &quot;Lis&quot; does indeed mean 'strife';
it also means 'lawsuit', so &quot;litem lite resolvere&quot; could mean &quot;to
countersue, obviate one lawsuit with another&quot;. But it also means &quot;point of
contention, knotty point&quot; and in context where Horace uses it (&quot;Nihil agit
exemplum litem quod lite resolvit&quot;) it means something like &quot;to remove one
difficulty by introducing another&quot;. Not quite the same as Phil's source
(&quot;explain one obscurity by another&quot;), which is indeed a poor translation,
but closer than I thought (ironically, Phil is the one always urging us to
use primary rather than secondary sources).

Joel, the question is not &quot;what you think&quot; about my analysis but whether
you can produce one of your own that will satisfy all of the Friedmans'
conditions -- conditions that, you tell us, you accept, and conditions
that you have not met. I am glad to see some movement on your part --
that is, you no longer believe that in the date &quot;1609&quot; the numerals &quot;1&quot;,
&quot;6&quot;, and &quot;9&quot; are &quot;capitalized words,&quot; so there is some hope you may
understand some of your other blunders.

&quot;If he rejects it&quot;? As you have known for some time, and as Gwyn publicly
stated last month, he HAS rejected it. You already have more than enough

As my own analysis, since you may have forgotten how much else you got
wrong, here is a brief reminder.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Terry Ross&quot;&lt;t ... @bcpl.net&gt; wrote
&gt;&gt; I am very familiar with the work of Penn Leary, and my discussion
&gt;&gt; concentrated on a Penn Leary cipher that appears to be central to
&gt;&gt; Joel's story.
&gt; As I have stated previously the Leary string is not 'central' to my
&gt; thesis.

"/>

Here is what Joel said in a post on another newsgroup:

&quot;I was wondering if any members of this forum might be interested in
evaluating the cryptographic validity of a paper that attempts to prove
that Francis Bacon wrote the works of Shakespeare. The proposed ciphers
meet all of the criteria for new claims established by William Friedman in
his book &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.&quot; Neither of the cipher
systems proposed were evaluated by Friedman because they hadn't been
discovered yet. One is a monoaplphabetic sub. cipher found by Thomas Leary
in the dedication to the Sonnets. The other is a unique code found on p.
287 of King Lear in the First Folio. I am aware of the fact that few
people take such claims seriously and am particularly interested in having
someone with a strong sense of scepticism review the paper. Anyone
interested should respond to djreneg ... @hotmail.com and I'll forward a
copy of the paper to you.&quot;

Let's see -- he mentions two (count 'em) two ciphers in this post, one of
which is Leary's, the other of which he seems not to consider a cipher but
a &quot;unique code.&quot; He speaks of the ciphers in terms of his &quot;attempt to
prove&quot; that Bacon wrote Shakespeare. Any reader would conclude from this
that Leary's cipher was central to Joel's offer of proof and thus to his
paper.

By the way, this post was to the &quot;sci.crypt&quot; newsgroup. Douglas A. Gwynn
replied to Joel's post thus:

&quot;I've just finished reading Dias-Porter's paper and will be preparing a
review which I will send to him. The bottom line is that I am convinced
that he has *not* found actual embedded clues.&quot;

On January 26, Douglas A Gwynn said,

&quot;the suggested clues are (for the most part) not of a nature that would be
reasonable for an author to choose for such a purpose, are too indirect
and require too much interpretation, and are produced by a methodology
that is but one instance of a whole class whose parameters can be tweaked
to find comparable 'evidence' of any author one wishes, in any large
corpus. Therefore my conclusion is that the investigator has found only a
reflection of his own presupposition, not objective evidence.&quot;

The entire thread may be found at

Joel has not been heard from on sci.crypt, but on this group he continues
to maintain the validity of his work despite my criticisms and those of
the regulars at sci.crypt. He does not accept my criticisms; will he at
least share those of Douglas A. Gwynn? On January 26 he promised &quot;as soon
as i hear back from the cryptograher who is evaluating it, i will make
whatever changes and revisions he suggests and post it. if he says none of
the crypto is valid, i won't post the paper, but i will post a message to
this discussion group giving his analysis.&quot;

What's Joel waiting for?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I provided a fair assessment of the methods used by Penn Leary,

&gt; I strongly disagree with this statement. your definition of an acrostic
&gt; for example is far more narrow than any definition i have seen including
&gt; the Friedman's. this was done to make Leary's 'last letter of every
&gt; capitalized word' acrostic appeare to be illegitimate.

"/>

Whether taking the &quot;last letter of every capitalized word&quot; is an
acceptable method in this case is subject to debate, but what is NOT is
that neither Leary nor Joel uses this method rigorously. I will elaborate
(once more) below.

Joel was kind enough to send me his paper. He quotes with approval these
words by the Friedmans about two acrostics they DO consider genuine:

&quot;In each case, there is no room to doubt that they were put there by the
deliberate intent of the author; the length of the hidden text, and the
absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear, combine to make it
enormously improbable that they just happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Leary's proposed cipher fails on all counts, as I have shown and will
again below.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; In principle, Joel would agree with me that if the Leary &quot;cipher&quot;
&gt;&gt; cannot meet all of the Friedmans' standards, it should be rejected.

&gt; this statement is true

"/>

Then you must reject the Leary &quot;cipher.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; All I was doing was helping readers see that the proposed cipher is
&gt;&gt; not demonstrably valid.

&gt; This statement is not true.

"/>

Then I will try once more -- this time having the benefit of Joel's paper.
Joel says,

&quot;The capitalized words on the Title page are as follows: Shake-speare's,
Sonnets, Never, Imprinted, AT, LONDON, By, G, Eld T, T, William, Aspley,
1, 6, 9, TO, THE, ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, and MR.&quot;

There are several errors here:

First -- &quot;1,&quot;&quot;6,&quot; and &quot;9&quot; are not &quot;capitalized words,&quot; being neither
&quot;capitalized&quot; nor &quot;words.&quot;

Second -- &quot;TO, THE, ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, and MR&quot;
are not on the title page at all; they are the first nine words of Thomas
Thorpe's dedication.

Third -- Although Joel refers to &quot;the&quot; title page, there are actually two
imprints of *Shakespeares Sonnets*, and the title page of the other has
THESE capitalized words: Shake-speare's, Sonnets, Never, Imprinted, AT,
LONDON, By, G, Eld T, T, Iohn Wright, Christ, Church.&quot;

To remind Joel -- on neither title page are the numerals &quot;1,&quot;&quot;16,&quot; and
&quot;9&quot; capitalized letters.

The Friedmans once more:

&quot;In each case, there is no room to doubt that they were put there by the
deliberate intent of the author; the length of the hidden text, and the
absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear, combine to make it
enormously improbable that they just happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Taking the last letter of each word in order would satisfy the requirement
of an &quot;absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear.&quot; If we were
reckless or generous enough, we might even allow Penn and Joel to take the
&quot;9&quot; from the date by considering the date a sufficiently word-like string,
and by taking final &quot;characters&quot; rather than &quot;letters.&quot; Here are the
results of performing this operation on the two versions of the title
page:

Wright imprint: SSredTNyGdrTTdeoeeyntgtthe9

Aspley imprint: SSredTNyGdrTTdeoeeymy9

Here are the same strings transformed by Leary's &quot;four-to-the-left&quot;
method:

Wright imprint: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaaripcppdaE

Aspley imprint: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaarhrE

In each case, the result is the same: gibberish in which a few substrings
that resemble words (e.g., &quot;OON,&quot;&quot;nay,&quot;&quot;yak,&quot;&quot;rip&quot;) may be found.
Neither result would satisfy the Friedmans' standards for &quot;plaintext.&quot;

Now let us omit the last letters of words that are not capitalized. Since
&quot;1609&quot; is neither capitalized nor a word, we will not take its &quot;9.&quot;

Wright imprint: SSr_dTNyGd_TT______ntgtth_

Aspley imprint: SSr_dTNyGd_TT______my

Does either of these lines comply with the Friedmans' requirement of an
&quot;absolutely rigid order&quot;? I think it is questionable -- but it hardly
matters. Let us now see these strings as transformed by Leary's
&quot;four-to-the-left&quot; method:

Wright imprint: OOn_yPIrCy_PP______ipcppd_

Aspley imprint: OOn_yPIrCy_PP______hr

The result is similar to the gibberish we saw last time. If anything, the
wordlike strings are harder to pick out, but in any event we do not have a
result that meets the Friedmans' standards for plaintext.

The Friedmans once more (remember, this is a passage Joel quoted in his
paper):

&quot;In each case [of the two genuine acrostics], there is no room to doubt
that they were put there by the deliberate intent of the author; the
length of the hidden text, and the absolutely rigid order in which the
letters appear, combine to make it enormously improbable that they just
happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Can anyone think there is &quot;no room to doubt&quot; that such gibberish was &quot;put
there by the deliberate intent of the author&quot;?

If Joel wishes, we can continue the selection process on the dedication
page, but this does not help matters.

The capitalized words on the dedication page are as follows: &quot;TO, THE,
ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, Mr, W, H, ALL, HAPPINESSE,
AND, THAT, ETERNITIE, PROMISED, BY, OVR, EVER-LIVING, POET, WISHETH, THE,
WELL-WISHING, ADVENTVRER, IN, SETTING, FORTH, T, T.&quot;

The last letters of these words are

OEERFEGSrWHLEDTEDYRGTHEGRNGHTT

When transformed ala Leary, the string becomes

KAANBACOnQDGAYPAYRNCPDACNICDP

Gibberish again. Let us tie this string to

Firstly to demonstrate an utter contempt for sincere inquiry. Usually Strats
claim this about others, however, I think non-Strats have no monopoly on the

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wouldn't &quot;first sourcing&quot; involve looking through *Bacon's* works to
&gt;&gt;&gt; find out whether or not he knew the 'words' in question?

&gt;&gt; Reading Bacon's works would not provide such information!

&gt; Of course it would.

&gt;&gt; Look at the 150 year hoo-hah on Johnson's 'small Latin' about the
&gt;&gt; Author of Shakespeare's Work. Is it evident from Shakespeares Works
&gt;&gt; the amount of Latin he had?

&gt; Of course it is.

&gt;&gt; Why did you propose this idea?

&gt; Because looking for evidence of Baconian ciphers in Bacon's own works
&gt; makes a hell of a lot more sense than looking for evidence of Baconian

His comments to the newsgroup amount to a complete rejection of your
paper. Let me refresh your memory a bit. Here is your original post to
sci.crypt:

======

I was wondering if any members of this forum might be interested in
evaluating the cryptographic validity of a paper that attempts to prove
that Francis Bacon wrote the works of Shakespeare. The proposed ciphers
meet all of the criteria for new claims established by William Friedman in
his book &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.&quot; Neither of the cipher
systems proposed were evaluated by Friedman because they hadn't been
discovered yet. One is a monoaplphabetic sub. cipher found by Thomas Leary
in the dedication to the Sonnets. The other is a unique code found on p.
287 of King Lear in the First Folio. I am aware of the fact that few
people take such claims seriously and am particularly interested in having
someone with a strong sense of scepticism review the paper. Anyone
interested should respond to djreneg ... @hotmail.com and I'll forward a
copy of the paper to you.

=====

Of course the central claim in your post was false -- neither of your
proposed ciphers meet all of the criteria established by the Friedmans.
Even you do not pretend that the &quot;unique code&quot; (as you so whimsically call
it) would satisfy the Friedmans' standards, and several competent readers
on this newsgroup have pointed out numerous flaws in the Leary &quot;cipher&quot;
that you used to be so fond of but that you have now demoted to the status
of a mere &quot;string.&quot;

Douglas Gwyn in two separate posts on January 26 rejected your claims on
sci.crypt. He said in one post, &quot;I've just finished reading Dias-Porter's
paper and will be preparing a review which I will send to him. The bottom
line is that I am convinced that he has *not* found actual embedded
clues.&quot;

In another post he said, &quot;the suggested clues are (for the most part) not
of a nature that would be reasonable for an author to choose for such a
purpose, are too indirect and require too much interpretation, and are
produced by a methodology that is but one instance of a whole class whose
parameters can be tweaked to find comparable 'evidence' of any author one
wishes, in any large corpus. Therefore my conclusion is that the
investigator has found only a reflection of his own presupposition, not
objective evidence.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm not sure which part of the following sentence you're having trouble
&gt; understanding, but until i read Doug's review I won't be assuming
&gt; anything.

"/>

So you think he twice posted a public rejection of your claims but
secretly falls for them? Oh puh-leeze. Even without seeing his more
detailed comments you have sufficient information to know that in his
judgment your claims are without merit. Are you looking for loopholes, as
you tried to do with the Friedmans' work?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm the one who decides when i have enough information. Some
&gt; of us like to have our facts in order before we speak.

Such as the &quot;fact&quot; that in the date &quot;1609&quot; the &quot;1&quot;, the &quot;6&quot;, and the &quot;9&quot;
are &quot;capitalized words&quot;?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; i'm looking forward to reading Doug's review and revising my paper
&gt; accordingly.

"/>

When are you going to &quot;revise&quot; it in light of the valid criticisms that
have been made on this newsgroup? When are you going to withdraw your
claims that your proposed ciphers meet all of the criteria established by
the Friedmans? You have more than enough information now to understand
some of the blunders you have made even without waiting for more details
from Gwyn. As you seem shy about dealing with the details of your errors,
perhaps a reminder would be useful to you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Terry Ross&quot;&lt;t ... @bcpl.net&gt; wrote
&gt;&gt; I am very familiar with the work of Penn Leary, and my discussion
&gt;&gt; concentrated on a Penn Leary cipher that appears to be central to
&gt;&gt; Joel's story.
&gt; As I have stated previously the Leary string is not 'central' to my
&gt; thesis.

"/>

Here is what Joel said in a post on another newsgroup:

&quot;I was wondering if any members of this forum might be interested in
evaluating the cryptographic validity of a paper that attempts to prove
that Francis Bacon wrote the works of Shakespeare. The proposed ciphers
meet all of the criteria for new claims established by William Friedman in
his book &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.&quot; Neither of the cipher

people take such claims seriously and am particularly interested in having
someone with a strong sense of scepticism review the paper. Anyone
interested should respond to djreneg ... @hotmail.com and I'll forward a
copy of the paper to you.&quot;

Let's see -- he mentions two (count 'em) two ciphers in this post, one of
which is Leary's, the other of which he seems not to consider a cipher but
a &quot;unique code.&quot; He speaks of the ciphers in terms of his &quot;attempt to
prove&quot; that Bacon wrote Shakespeare. Any reader would conclude from this
that Leary's cipher was central to Joel's offer of proof and thus to his
paper.

By the way, this post was to the &quot;sci.crypt&quot; newsgroup. Douglas A. Gwynn
replied to Joel's post thus:

&quot;I've just finished reading Dias-Porter's paper and will be preparing a
review which I will send to him. The bottom line is that I am convinced
that he has *not* found actual embedded clues.&quot;

On January 26, Douglas A Gwynn said,

&quot;the suggested clues are (for the most part) not of a nature that would be
reasonable for an author to choose for such a purpose, are too indirect
and require too much interpretation, and are produced by a methodology
that is but one instance of a whole class whose parameters can be tweaked
to find comparable 'evidence' of any author one wishes, in any large
corpus. Therefore my conclusion is that the investigator has found only a
reflection of his own presupposition, not objective evidence.&quot;

The entire thread may be found at

Joel has not been heard from on sci.crypt, but on this group he continues
to maintain the validity of his work despite my criticisms and those of
the regulars at sci.crypt. He does not accept my criticisms; will he at
least share those of Douglas A. Gwynn? On January 26 he promised &quot;as soon
as i hear back from the cryptograher who is evaluating it, i will make
whatever changes and revisions he suggests and post it. if he says none of
the crypto is valid, i won't post the paper, but i will post a message to
this discussion group giving his analysis.&quot;

What's Joel waiting for?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I provided a fair assessment of the methods used by Penn Leary,

&gt; I strongly disagree with this statement. your definition of an acrostic
&gt; for example is far more narrow than any definition i have seen including
&gt; the Friedman's. this was done to make Leary's 'last letter of every
&gt; capitalized word' acrostic appeare to be illegitimate.

"/>

Whether taking the &quot;last letter of every capitalized word&quot; is an
acceptable method in this case is subject to debate, but what is NOT is
that neither Leary nor Joel uses this method rigorously. I will elaborate
(once more) below.

Joel was kind enough to send me his paper. He quotes with approval these
words by the Friedmans about two acrostics they DO consider genuine:

&quot;In each case, there is no room to doubt that they were put there by the
deliberate intent of the author; the length of the hidden text, and the
absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear, combine to make it
enormously improbable that they just happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Leary's proposed cipher fails on all counts, as I have shown and will
again below.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; In principle, Joel would agree with me that if the Leary &quot;cipher&quot;
&gt;&gt; cannot meet all of the Friedmans' standards, it should be rejected.

&gt; this statement is true

"/>

Then you must reject the Leary &quot;cipher.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; All I was doing was helping readers see that the proposed cipher is
&gt;&gt; not demonstrably valid.

&gt; This statement is not true.

"/>

Then I will try once more -- this time having the benefit of Joel's paper.
Joel says,

&quot;The capitalized words on the Title page are as follows: Shake-speare's,
Sonnets, Never, Imprinted, AT, LONDON, By, G, Eld T, T, William, Aspley,
1, 6, 9, TO, THE, ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, and MR.&quot;

There are several errors here:

First -- &quot;1,&quot;&quot;6,&quot; and &quot;9&quot; are not &quot;capitalized words,&quot; being neither
&quot;capitalized&quot; nor &quot;words.&quot;

Second -- &quot;TO, THE, ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, and MR&quot;
are not on the title page at all; they are the first nine words of Thomas
Thorpe's dedication.

Third -- Although Joel refers to &quot;the&quot; title page, there are actually two
imprints of *Shakespeares Sonnets*, and the title page of the other has
THESE capitalized words: Shake-speare's, Sonnets, Never, Imprinted, AT,
LONDON, By, G, Eld T, T, Iohn Wright, Christ, Church.&quot;

To remind Joel -- on neither title page are the numerals &quot;1,&quot;&quot;16,&quot; and
&quot;9&quot; capitalized letters.

The Friedmans once more:

&quot;In each case, there is no room to doubt that they were put there by the
deliberate intent of the author; the length of the hidden text, and the
absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear, combine to make it
enormously improbable that they just happened to ...

"/>

Speaking of what you &quot;left out,&quot; here is a passage you quote from the
Friedmans:

&quot;The perpetual question is-Is the new one right? If it is a matter of
cryptology we have indicated tests and standards which may be invoked. It
will have occurred to the reader that these are in fact the principles of
common sense writ large, or more exactly the principles of logic and
scientific method. These are the principles on which a true cryptographer
proceeds, and they are the principles on which cryptological 'solutions'
must be judged.&quot;

Since your longer paper will include things that you &quot;left out,&quot; you might
wish to quote the very next sentence, as it applies very much to your own
efforts:

&quot;Basically it is by misunderstanding or misuse of these principles and
methods that the devisers of the systems we have investigated fail.&quot;

Your methods too have failed, Joel, and they failed for the very reasons
the Friedmans noted (O their prophetic souls!) nearly 50 years ago.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; until i see his review, and his specific reasons for rejecting them, i
&gt; won't know.

He is unlikely to mention every error, every &quot;misunderstanding or misuse&quot;
that appears in your paper, but the tenor of his remarks on sci.crypt is
similar to the Friedmans' &quot;prediction&quot; of how you would go wrong.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You posted on this newsgroup also. You sought skeptical criticism, and
you received it. Phil Innes thought I &quot;should provide Joel Dias-Porter an
informed response by reading his paper, since otherwise this investigation
reflects more upon 'Strat' lackadaisical methodology.&quot; I don't think I
owed you any such favor, given your inability to handle even the mildest
correction, but I have indeed given you an &quot;informed response,&quot; and your
inability to deal with it is one more testament to the emptiness of your
project.

One more time (as a favor for Phil):

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Terry Ross&quot;&lt;t ... @bcpl.net&gt; wrote
&gt;&gt; I am very familiar with the work of Penn Leary, and my discussion
&gt;&gt; concentrated on a Penn Leary cipher that appears to be central to
&gt;&gt; Joel's story.
&gt; As I have stated previously the Leary string is not 'central' to my
&gt; thesis.

"/>

Here is what Joel said in a post on another newsgroup:

&quot;I was wondering if any members of this forum might be interested in
evaluating the cryptographic validity of a paper that attempts to prove
that Francis Bacon wrote the works of Shakespeare. The proposed ciphers
meet all of the criteria for new claims established by William Friedman in
his book &quot;The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined.&quot; Neither of the cipher
systems proposed were evaluated by Friedman because they hadn't been
discovered yet. One is a monoaplphabetic sub. cipher found by Thomas Leary
in the dedication to the Sonnets. The other is a unique code found on p.
287 of King Lear in the First Folio. I am aware of the fact that few
people take such claims seriously and am particularly interested in having
someone with a strong sense of scepticism review the paper. Anyone
interested should respond to djreneg ... @hotmail.com and I'll forward a
copy of the paper to you.&quot;

Let's see -- he mentions two (count 'em) two ciphers in this post, one of
which is Leary's, the other of which he seems not to consider a cipher but
a &quot;unique code.&quot; He speaks of the ciphers in terms of his &quot;attempt to
prove&quot; that Bacon wrote Shakespeare. Any reader would conclude from this
that Leary's cipher was central to Joel's offer of proof and thus to his
paper.

By the way, this post was to the &quot;sci.crypt&quot; newsgroup. Douglas A. Gwynn
replied to Joel's post thus:

&quot;I've just finished reading Dias-Porter's paper and will be preparing a
review which I will send to him. The bottom line is that I am convinced
that he has *not* found actual embedded clues.&quot;

On January 26, Douglas A Gwynn said,

&quot;the suggested clues are (for the most part) not of a nature that would be
reasonable for an author to choose for such a purpose, are too indirect
and require too much interpretation, and are produced by a methodology
that is but one instance of a whole class whose parameters can be tweaked
to find comparable 'evidence' of any author one wishes, in any large
corpus. Therefore my conclusion is that the investigator has found only a
reflection of his own presupposition, not objective evidence.&quot;

The entire thread may be found at

Joel has not been heard from on sci.crypt, but on this group he continues
to maintain the validity of his work despite my criticisms and those of
the regulars at sci.crypt. He does not accept my criticisms; will he at
least share those of Douglas A. Gwynn? On January 26 he promised &quot;as soon
as i hear back from the cryptograher who is evaluating it, i will make
whatever changes and revisions he suggests and post it. if he says none of
the crypto is valid, i won't post the paper, but i will post a message to
this discussion group giving his analysis.&quot;

What's Joel waiting for?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I provided a fair assessment of the methods used by Penn Leary,

&gt; I strongly disagree with this statement. your definition of an acrostic
&gt; for example is far more narrow than any definition i have seen including
&gt; the Friedman's. this was done to make Leary's 'last letter of every
&gt; capitalized word' acrostic appeare to be illegitimate.

"/>

Whether taking the &quot;last letter of every capitalized word&quot; is an
acceptable method in this case is subject to debate, but what is NOT is
that neither Leary nor Joel uses this method rigorously. I will elaborate
(once more) below.

Joel was kind enough to send me his paper. He quotes with approval these
words by the Friedmans about two acrostics they DO consider genuine:

&quot;In each case, there is no room to doubt that they were put there by the
deliberate intent of the author; the length of the hidden text, and the
absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear, combine to make it
enormously improbable that they just happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Leary's proposed cipher fails on all counts, as I have shown and will
again below.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; In principle, Joel would agree with me that if the Leary &quot;cipher&quot;
&gt;&gt; cannot meet all of the Friedmans' standards, it should be rejected.

&gt; this statement is true

"/>

Then you must reject the Leary &quot;cipher.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; All I was doing was helping readers see that the proposed cipher is
&gt;&gt; not demonstrably valid.

&gt; This statement is not true.

"/>

Then I will try once more -- this time having the benefit of Joel's paper.
Joel says,

&quot;The capitalized words on the Title page are as follows: Shake-speare's,
Sonnets, Never, Imprinted, AT, LONDON, By, G, Eld T, T, William, Aspley,
1, 6, 9, TO, THE, ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, and MR.&quot;

There are several errors here:

First -- &quot;1,&quot;&quot;6,&quot; and &quot;9&quot; are not &quot;capitalized words,&quot; being neither
&quot;capitalized&quot; nor &quot;words.&quot;

Second -- &quot;TO, THE, ONLIE, BEGETTER, OF, THESE, INSVING, SONNETS, and MR&quot;
are not on the title page at all; they are the first nine words of Thomas
Thorpe's dedication.

Third -- Although Joel refers to &quot;the&quot; title page, there are actually two
imprints of *Shakespeares Sonnets*, and the title page of the other has
THESE capitalized words: Shake-speare's, Sonnets, Never, Imprinted, AT,
LONDON, By, G, Eld T, T, Iohn Wright, Christ, Church.&quot;

To remind Joel -- on neither title page are the numerals &quot;1,&quot;&quot;16,&quot; and
&quot;9&quot; capitalized letters.

The Friedmans once more:

&quot;In each case, there is no room to doubt that they were put there by the
deliberate intent of the author; the length of the hidden text, and the
absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear, combine to make it
enormously improbable that they just happened to be there by accident.&quot;

Taking the last letter of each word in order would satisfy the requirement
of an &quot;absolutely rigid order in which the letters appear.&quot; If we were
reckless or generous enough, we might even allow Penn and Joel to take the
&quot;9&quot; from the date by considering the date a sufficiently word-like string,
and by taking final &quot;characters&quot; rather than &quot;letters.&quot; Here are the
results of performing this operation on the two versions of the title
page:

Wright imprint: SSredTNyGdrTTdeoeeyntgtthe9

Aspley imprint: SSredTNyGdrTTdeoeeymy9

Here are the same strings transformed by Leary's &quot;four-to-the-left&quot;
method:

Wright imprint: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaaripcppdaE

Aspley imprint: OOnayPIrCynPPyakaarhrE

In each case, the result is the same: gibberish in which a few substrings
that resemble words (e.g., &quot;OON,&quot;&quot;nay,&quot;&quot;yak,&quot;&quot;rip&quot;) may be found.
Neither result would satisfy ...

Whether one takes the first, second, or third letters from each word on
the title page -- or the last, penultimate, or antepenultimate from each
-- the resulting string will essentially be gibberish within which one
could probably pick out a few substrings that resemble words. The same is
true if one takes those &quot;resulting strings&quot; and transforms the letters

A &quot;competent scholar&quot; of what? For the Friedmans, supposed true OR false
clues can have no bearing on the demonstration that a valid cipher exists.

&quot;The 'system' Theobald refers to is, of course, no system at all, and the
manipulations are so easy that one can without difficulty devise 'at least
two different forms' of any name and proceed to find them on the same
page, and scattered liberally through any collection of works. But it is
interesting to notice this attempt to bolster the weaknesses of a 'system'
with quite extraneous considerations. We have come across similar cases
before: there is Owen's challenge that one could not carry a cipher story
through to its completion if one 'neglected the guides', Cunningham's
emphasis that a true 'cover name' must 'check through 100 per cent', and
Arensberg's recourse to hints in the text which signal the acrostic
'signature'. In valid cryptography there is no need for such devices; the
system itself is foolproof, and involved arguments to substantiate a
correctly deciphered message are nothing to the point.&quot;

I read that book shortly after it came out last year. I was shocked at how

A genuine cipher could involve substituting numbers for letters (e.g., &quot;A&quot;
= &quot;01,&quot; B= &quot;02,&quot; etc.) but summing the results does not produce a valid
cipher -- there are a great many ways to arrive at any particular sum.
Baconians generally use several different numerical substitutions (e.g.,
Joel uses both the &quot;simple&quot; and the so-called &quot;kay&quot; systems, and he
sometimes likes to add the resulting sums of various systems together),
which makes it even easier to find matches. One requirement of any
demonstrably valid cipher (or code, for that matter) is that the result
must be unique.

I wouldn't be able to accept a gold (or any color Rolls Royce) myself.
Parking is sometimes tight on my street, so a smaller car would be more
useful; and the neighborhood thieves might find a Rolls an attractive
target. I hate to think what the insurance would run (and how much does a
Rolls dealer charge for an oil change these days?). I would have to move,
and that seems like too much trouble just to be able to drive a Rolls; so
I'll have to just wave sympathetically at Joel as he cruises nervously by.

&gt;&gt; Wolfenbutel and the engraver's notes... and so on, until we encounter
&gt;&gt; the sentence 'cunningly designed false clues, snares for the
&gt;&gt; uninitiated' but not to 'the writer, who possesses a &quot;Baconian library,

&gt; A &quot;competent scholar&quot; of what? For the Friedmans, supposed true OR false

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; It is crucial to any genuine cipher that the methods be rigorous and
&gt;&gt;&gt; the results be meaningful. The temptation to shade a bit on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; selection or transformation process, and then to shade a bit more on
&gt;&gt;&gt; the results can be very strong, but any such &quot;shading&quot; invalidates the
&gt;&gt;&gt; entire process.

&gt;&gt; Agree. Non-cypher, yet still encoded Greekgematria, allows 1 number
&gt;&gt; deviation in value plus/minus, hence a nominal word of 600 value, can be
&gt;&gt; 599 or 601.

&gt; A genuine cipher could involve substituting numbers for letters (e.g., &quot;A&quot;
&gt; = &quot;01,&quot; B= &quot;02,&quot; etc.) but summing the results does not produce a valid
&gt; cipher -- there are a great many ways to arrive at any particular sum.
&gt; Baconians generally use several different numerical substitutions (e.g.,
&gt; Joel uses both the &quot;simple&quot; and the so-called &quot;kay&quot; systems, and he
&gt; sometimes likes to add the resulting sums of various systems together),
&gt; which makes it even easier to find matches. One requirement of any
&gt; demonstrably valid cipher (or code, for that matter) is that the result
&gt; must be unique.

this was a reference to magic squares, on the cube of 3, 5 then their

&gt;&gt;&gt; free dinners.

&gt;&gt; But Terry, if Joel next writes to us that he has abandoned his quest

And most of it is a regurgitation of &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy

Dan Brown's books do offer a few incidental pleasures. I quite liked
the scene in &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; in which the Illuminati reveal their

That had a nice Gary Larson feel to it.

A novelist's art depends upon much more than just an &quot;ability to choose the
right words.&quot; It also depends on plotting, characterization, the ability to
concentrate, a work ethic, and often the ability to take constructive
criticism, in addition to other things. Very few novels that I know of were

Seems to me that there is some problem here with the word &quot;incompetent&quot;.
It doesn't apply to just one quality. There is literature which is incompetent
from an artistic standpoint, and there is writing which is incompetent
from a business standpoint. King's novels are artistically incompetent,
but financially competent, just as I'm sure that Snoop Dog has sold
more records than Murray Perahia. I'm sure that if you take any writer
who has withstood the test of time from the artistic standpoint, with
the possible exception of Dickens, you will find that they have sold
far fewer copies of their work in their lifetime than King has. And many
of the most popular writers of their time are long forgotten today. I'm
reminded of Frank R. Stockton, one of the most popular writers of
the second half of the 19th century, whose 23 volume &quot;Collected Works&quot;
was published around 1905, a couple of years after his death. Who?
Exactly. And it's not that he's a forgotten genius. He's forgotten
because for the most part he doesn't write about anything that would
interest us today, and while his style is certainly competent (much
more so than King's) there is nothing in the style that would overcome
the limitations of his subject matter. He IS interesting from a purely
historical point of view, because much of his writing was published
in women's magazines for the home, and as a result even his science fiction
is an unusual hybrid of domesticity and science.

You could argue differently. King's books are competent because they don't
claim to be art. They succeed at what they claim to do. Likewise Snoop Dog
is competent at his artistic task (cussing in rhythem), while many
pianophiles think little of Perahia (his underpowered Beethoven Concertos,
etc).

If you define that as the novelist's main task, then yes, bestselling

Even allowing for the sake of argument that all bestselling novels are

&gt; create readers. sometimes the two overlap, but not very often.

"/>

Writers can be competent in the craft of getting as many readers as
possible without being competent in the craft of writing. The people
who enthusiastically seek out the new Clive Cussler or Tom Clancy novel
are not looking for well-crafted sentences, interesting characters,
insight into the human condition, or anything of the other defining
marks of the competently-written novel.

If you wish to believe that any novel that sells is ipso facto a
competently-written novel, then we must agree to disagree.

&gt;&gt; There are many competent -- even superb -- writers who will never be

Verbosity is using too many words, Mark, so it IS, in a sense, not choosing

I don't go out of my way to listen to many different versions. I know

owned by a relative and it was Rubinstein, but I don't know if it was
the one above. I liked it. If anything, his (in my memory) seems

one reason that I like Perahia's version of the Beethoven 4th is because
he plays the coda in the first movement that I prefer.

I don't recall Perahia's 4th, but it and the 2nd strike me as suiting his
