For whoever may be interested:

Last week MEAN BML was transiting 18* Leo, the degree of my natal
Jupiter. I obviously wondered how this would effect and increase any
knowledge that I may or may not possess. With retro.tr. Mars hovering
conjunct my 9th house 21* Sun, the 'sword-like clashes in the beliefs
section' was not unexpected.

I received a request from abroad, with birth data, to offer some ideas
regarding someone's MEAN BML placing, and did a lot of work on it.
"Fits in with the conjunctions" thinks I. Reply was duly posted.

Yesterday, as transiting Mercury in Scorpio in my 3rd house squared my
natal Jupiter-separating tr. BML conjunction, I received an apologetic
message....
"Sorry, birth data was incorrect. Explanation doesn't fit."
I couldn't help but smile at how fact matched coincidence.

I have observed Mercury-MEAN BML aspects to coincide with
misinformation, misinterpretation, unknown information, misleading
correspondence and false information (even imaginary !),unknown
siblings, and even how difficult it is for some to say that little word
'sorry'; quote: "which is just a word and doesn't mean anything" (yet
corresponding to admittance that one is wrong). So this current 'event'
seemed to dot yet another 'i' for me as to how such a combination of
planets can work.

Reading AAM over coffee this morning, there is a post in the BML thread
from Raymond concerning the Canopus program from Clairvision. My
Mercury curiousity is aroused. I send Google off to search the Black
Moon Lilith Files in the program. HUNDREDS of them !! That new set of
information is going to keep me actively busy for a l-o-n-g
Jupiter-tr.BML square Sun-tr.Mars while, and hopefully add as yet
unknown and new insights.
Special thanks, Raymond xx.

As a matter of personal interest, does anyone have planets on 18/19* of
the signs, and had similar experiences this week of receiving (wrong,
insightful) information, according to the planet involved?

Regards,
Christine.

Hi Christine,

I don't know whether this is it...if not, please ignore it.

Anyway, I have Uranus at 19 Scorpio, 2nd house.

Right now I am writing a seminar paper, which is based on a mini
research I had to do (Uranus rules science, I believe). And this
Thursday I discovered that I did wrong statistical analyses on the
experiment results....which is a receiving of the correct information.
Right now I am expecting an email (Uranus = Internet communications)
from the professor that she approved my new analyses....:-) Hope this
is where Lilith transit influence ends :-)

But...the analyses were prformed last week...in which, as Astro shows,
Lilith was also 18 Leo...so the wrong information/data manipulation was
performed under the transit. May I also add that the statistics were
run using a computer software, which is also in the responsibility of
Uranus :-)

Good luck with your research :-)

Hi Lena,

Would this be the 1979 'Lena'?

Thank you for the observation, which has been duly noted :-). I NEVER
ignore BML.

Don't be in such a hurry to blame MEAN BML for the fault; it could well
be influential towards the reason behind the correction and doing it
right. If the chart I have on file is yours, there is a Uranus-BML in
Virgo sextile. Accuracy and perfection *should* come  first nature :-)

What made you recheck your analysis data? Intuition or plain old logic
:-)

In modern astrology the outer planets have become associated with
various areas of the natural sciences, and it's Uranus that covers the
natural laws of their nature, whilst Saturn provides the confirmation
in proven laws :-)
However, I have to admit that I always find BML's aspects to
Scientists' 'discoveries' very intriguing.
Hope your 'unseen' professor (BML to Neptune?)
doesn't find any mistakes and marks your work with an A+.

Regards,
Christine.

Thank you :-)

Yes, this is me - 1979' Lena. I had to close my former email...

I totally forgot about my poor Neptune - 18 Sag....in the 3rd house of
communications :-)

I don't blame Lilith for anything - in fact I take full responsibility
on myself, I just thought its transit and my mistake could be
connected...although, you know, its aspect to Neptune makes much more
sense: I actually showed my analyses to the professor, and she also
didn't see my mistake :-) So, when Lilith was in aspect (although, a
trine) to Neptune, I made the mistake. Now that it gets close to
Uranus, I correct the mistake :-)

The interesting thing is, that after I completed the mistaken analisys,
I had the feeling that something is not quite right...but I only
realized what exactly is wrong after I read other papers, in which
similar research was described...I knew what I shoud do, but I could
not label it in words, that was my problem. And since I could not
verbalize it, I could not choose the right programm...

Have a nice day :-)

Lena.

Hi Christine,

This is very interesting. I have Jupiter on 19 Scorpio opposite Saturn on 18
Taurus. I just attended a 3-day conference abroad and came back with mixed
feelings about its success for me: for a large part it had been
dissappointing to me, a lot of the workshops were too general to really help
me in doing a better job and the general organisation was messier than it
should have been (causing delays and such) . On the other hand, there were a
a few very interesting sessions.
I was still wondering about whether I thought it had been worth all that
money my boss has payed for that trip, when I saw your post. When I got
thinking about it I also realised that my opinions have been flipping back
and forth a lot his weekend: one minute I thought this of a situation, the
next the opposite. Of course that does happen to me more often with a
Jup-Sat opposition, but this time it was definitely more yes-no-yes-no ;-)
I do also have juno &amp; vesta in this picture, Juno 18 Tau and Vesta 18 Sco. I
received a very generous invitation to stay with someone if I ever visited
his city (vesta?), but I'm not really sure yet how Juno fits in. I don't
think spending quality time with a former colleague who transferred to
Germany a year ago counts, especially since I hadn't spoken to her since.
Maybe she is symbolized by BML which T-squares the Jup-Sat-opp? She is
dark-haired ;-)

Something else about BML: during the conference someone mentioned "the dark
lady of DNA, Rosalind Franklin". She was a co-discoverer of the
DNA-structure with James Watson &amp; Francis Crick, but didn't get the
Nobel-prize, because she had died before the prize was awarded.For this
reason she is often ignored when the topic of discovery of DNA comes up. I
immediately thought of BML at the mention of "dark lady". Born 25 July 1920
in London, UK, time unknown.
The most obvious thing I can see is Sun inconjunct BML, but I'm not familiar
enough with inconjunct aspects to know what that would mean. You may want to
investigate it further.

Hello Ingrid,
Thanks for your response
Unfortunately I lost your birth data so can't check your chart for
house details.
With your remarks regarding 'too general to help ME in doing a better
job' and 'worth all that money', maybe you felt that you personally
gained nothing from the conference (outer manifestation), whilst you
inwardly gained deeper insight into, and understanding of how
knowledgeable you truly are in your personal field of expertise. If
this is something you incline to ponder upon,
then you may have now learned to trust your judgement, even if it was
reflected in a simple form like, "I'm not all that bad as I imagined,
after all."

Very good of you to provide this data.  Your mention of her often being
ignored for her role in the research could fit with BML. My first
thought was that DNA-structure could show a Pluto-Saturn aspect with a
BML link. Pluto-Saturn sextile each other but her MEAN BML in the first
degree of Capricorn is just outside the max. 6* orb I use to make the
opposition with Pluto, although I would count the 4* orb to Uranus as
'in'. Natal Sun in Leo is definitely inconjunct MEAN BML, putting it at
the apex of a YOD with Uranus. I know nothing of her at all but would
think that such a figure would obviously put a tremendous strain on her
private life.
BML in Capricorn has shown some very strong women able to take care of
themselves with total disregard towards convention and how others think
they should act. Yet that YOD makes me wonder if this was something she
never totally inwardly achieved, as well as the lack of outer
recognition you mentioned.

Regards,
Christine.

This is spot-on. During the first lecture I attended I kept thinking that I
agreed with the person giving the lecture, mostly because I was already
doing what she suggested. Later in the weekend a colleague complimented me
on my expertise, which is when I realised that indeed I am doing a good job
and maybe I'm being too strict on myself.
The houses these planets are in: Jup in 11th (communities), Sat in 5th
(children) and therefore BML in 8th. If you need more data for your
research, let me know.
