In August of 2001 Robert Brazil posted this listing below to the
Phaeton group. What's to be noticed is that the stoney broke and
buggering Edward de Vere was admired for some reason or other, and one
wonders what it was. Notice also that several of the books are of a
religious nature, which freshens the notion that he might have had
something to do with &quot;translating&quot; the KJV.

Notes:

Franklin Williams' list suggests that the Euphues Anatomy of Wit
reprint of 1617 is dedicated to Oxford, though the original isn't. I
haven't seen the 1617 yet.

In the covert department there are probably many examples beyond
Nashe's
Strange Newes.

One of the most interesting dedications is Angel Daye's The English
Secretary of 1586 which begins:

&quot; Zeuxis endeavoring to paint excellent lie, made grapes in shew so
natural that presenting them to view, men were deceived by their
shapes and the birds with their colors. When Apelles drew Venus ... &quot;
Daye then goes on to flatter Oxford as being in the same category
of talent as Zeuxis and Apelles.

To me, the &quot;killer&quot; aspect of the Oxford dedications books is that so
many are on the list of Bullough's Sources of Shakespeare. And others
probably should be on the list as well.

The &quot;Dedicated to Oxford&quot; books are important because they provide
research vectors - through the texts, through the bibliographic
details, and through the authors and alleged authors of the
works.investigating the authors of the
books, many of whom are cited by Stratfordians as authors of works
used by Shakespeare.

The broader issue to be determined is whether any generalizations can
be formed about what it meant to have a book dedication in those days,
whether contact &amp; friendship between author and recipient can be
reliably inferred, or if patterns of social &amp; 'business' connections
can be reconstructed. An additional issue is: when is a book
dedication a plea for money, and when does it represent pre-paid
patronage ?

Another prickly issue is the spectre of &quot;phony name&quot; authors who might
represent the patron ghosting his own book and dedication (as has been
suggested in the case of Robert Greene's dedication to Oxford in &quot;
Card of Fancie&quot;).

Print shops 400 years ago shared one thing with modern times: up front
cash money to begin the press run. The exception to this rule is when
the printer or publisher (often in an alliance) owned the project or
an interest in it.

What I am trying to determine over time is whether it can be proven
that major patrons of books, like Leicester, Burghley, and Oxford,
took an active interest in some of those books that bear their names,
and that their interest included not just the outlaying of money, but
occasionally some editorial or &quot;publisher&quot; functions. In Oxford's
case, it is seems almost intuitively obvious that de Vere took an
active role in &quot;producing&quot; some of the books, even if that took the
form of delegating the jobs to others and then carefully examining the
results and approving or nixing. &quot;Proving&quot; that involvement is not
going to be easy, but it's a fine challenge.

WHY DID Shakespeare ask for patronage from the Earl of
Southampton? This is a reasonable question of any scholar.

Now take the same question in an Oxfordian premise...

WHY DID the Earl of Oxford ask for patronage from the Earl of
Southampton?

And you get a laughably stupid entanglement that embarrasses
OXFORDIAN SCHOLARS as they grapple with reality to make
sense of their wholly inexplicable hate crime called Oxfordianism.
You'll double over as Oxfordians explain the dedications of VA
and Lucrece! No two Oxfordians quite tell it the same way, but they
are all hilarious in their delineations! What a laugh!

Surrender. No way did Oxford kiss up to Henry with the
first heir of his invention. (Which was chronologically about the
38th heir of the Earl's invention anyway, of course.)

Greg Reynolds
Here's a favorite poem by Oxford, his onlie sonnet.
Crowley regards it as Viagra because it mentions court.
Notice it is not included in anyone else's canon.

Who taught thee first to sigh, alas, my heart ?
Who taught thy tongue the woeful words of plaint ?
Who filled your eyes with tears of bitter smart ?
Who gave thee grief and made thy joys to faint ?
Who first did paint with colors pale thy face ?
Who first did break thy sleeps of quiet rest?
Above the rest in court who gave thee grace ?
Who made thee strive in honour to be best ?
In constant truth to bide so firm and sure,
To scorn the world regarding but thy friends ?
With patient mind each passion to endure,
In one desire to settle to the end ?
Love then thy choice wherein such choice thou bind,
As nought but death may ever change thy mind.
Finis.
Earle of Oxenforde.

Unlike Shakespeare, the earl felt to tell us when the fourteen lines were finished.

The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia, 1593

Dedication

T O M Y D E A R E L A D I E
AND SISTER, THE COUN-
TESSE OF PEMBROKE.

H Ere now have you (most deare, and most worthy to be most deare Lady) this
idle worke of mine : which I fear (like the Spiders webbe) will be thought
fitter to be swept away, then worn to any other purpose. For my part, in
very trueth (as the cruell fathers among the Greekes, were woont to doo to
the babes they would not foster) I could well find in my harte, to cast out
in some desert of forgetfulnes this child, which I am loath to father. But
you desired me to doo it, and your desire, to my hart is an absolute
commandement. Now, it is done onelie for you, onely to you : if you keepe
it to your selfe, or to such friendes, who will weigh errors in the
ballaunce of good will, I hope, for the fathers sake, it will be pardoned,
perchance made much of, though in it selfe it have deformities. For
indeede, for severer eyes it is not, being but a trifle, and that
triflinglie handled. Your deare selfe can best witnes the maner, being
done in loose sheetes of paper, most of it in your presence, the rest, by
sheetes, sent unto you, as fast as they were done. In summe, a young head,
not so well stayed as I would it were, (and shall be when God will) having
many many fancies begotten in it, if it had not ben in some way delivered,
would have growen a monster, &amp; more sorie might I be that they came in, then
that they gat out. But his chiefe safetie, shalbe the not walking abroad ;
&amp; his chiefe protection, the bearing the liverye of your name ; which (if
much much good will do not deceave me) is worthy to be a sanctuary for a
greater offender. This say I, because I knowe the vertue so ; and this
say I, because it may be ever so ; or to say better, because it will be
ever so. Read it then at your idle tymes, and the follyes your good
judgement wil finde in it, blame not, but laugh at. And so, looking for
no better stuffe, then, as in an Haberdashers shoppe, glasses, or feathers,
you will continue to love the writer, who doth excedinglie love you ; and
most most hartelie praies you may long live, to be a principall ornament to
the familie of the Sidneis.
Your loving Brother

Philip Sidnei.

Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,
With full as many signs of deadly hate,
As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:
*My TONGUE* should stumble in mine earnest *WORDS*;
*Mine EYES* should sparkle like the beaten flint;
Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:
And even now *MY burthen'd HEART* would break,
Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
Their softest touch as *SMART* as lizards' sting!
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,
And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--

"/>

He didn't Art. He was dead. The Arcadia is
just one more work that is stuffed with anomalies.
There's a mysterious biography that was inserted
into the Arcadia which Sidney did not write, there are
&quot;Shakespearean passages,&quot; and the dedication
below wasn't written by Sidney. Sidney's manuscripts
have little to do with the finished Arcadia. Some
scholars believe that it was written by Mary and an
assistant to capitalize on Sidney's death to further
the ends of Leicester's party but what else is new?
The Dedication below reads suspiciously like the
dedications to the V &amp; A and Lucrece. Same style.
And most interesting of all, I just found out that Bacon
wrote the very famous &quot;Sidney&quot; letter to the Queen
trying to discourage her from going through with the
Catholic marriage.

I've seen a couple of Sidney's letters and he was
no genius by any means. At least one orthodox scholar
doesn't believe he wrote any part of the Arcadia. And
of course who was at Wilton helping Mary 'edit' the
Arcadia?

The first was probably written at a tender age.

And Bacon's Promus is possibly simply
a list of common Elizabethan clichés.

Shake-speare certainly didn't use the WORDS:
*BITTER* &amp; *SMART* very often:
---------------------------------------------
Shake-speare use:

1) *HEART* 1075
2) *EYES* 769
3) *TONGUE* 440
4) *WORDS* 438
5) *BITTER* 77
6) *SMART* 9
--------------------------------------------
So why do these two words just happen to
occur together in both Oxford &amp; Shake-speare?

The manner of my pity-wanting pain.

As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
No news but health from their physicians know;

And in my madness might speak ill of thee:

----------------------------------------------------
Hamlet, Prince of Denmark Act 2, Scene 2

Now I am alone.
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
That from her working all his visage wann'd,
Tears in his *EYES*, distraction in's aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
The very faculties of *EYES* and ears. Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
Upon whose property and most dear life
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
Ha!
'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must, like a whore, unpack my *HEART* with *WORDS*,
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
That guilty creatures sitting at a play
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul that presently
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
For murder, though it have no *TONGUE*, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
May be the devil: and the devil hath power
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
More relative than this: the play 's the thing
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

Five hundred pounds a play? That must be about a hundred times the
going rate!

The purpose of his grant was simple and public. The premier earl of
the kingdom was on the point of bankruptcy. If that happened, it would
disgrace him, the country, the court and the queen. So the queen
devised a way of keeping his head above water, however reckless he
might be. And when he tried to get the income commuted into a capital
sum, she made sure he was not allowed to. That would have let him
spend the lot in a single spree, defeating the original purpose.

He lived on it. He was an extravagant man - it cost him a lot to live.

&gt;&gt;&gt; WHY DID Shakespeare ask for patronage from the Earl of

&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------
&gt;&gt; WHY DID Sir Philip Sidney ask for
&gt;&gt; patronage from his sister Mary Sidney?
&gt; He didn't Art. He was dead. The Arcadia is
&gt; just one more work that is stuffed with anomalies.
&gt; There's a mysterious biography that was inserted
&gt; into the Arcadia which Sidney did not write, there are
&gt;&quot;Shakespearean passages,&quot; and the dedication
&gt; below wasn't written by Sidney. Sidney's manuscripts
&gt; have little to do with the finished Arcadia. Some
&gt; scholars believe that it was written by Mary and an
&gt; assistant to capitalize on Sidney's death to further
&gt; the ends of Leicester's party but what else is new?
&gt; The Dedication below reads suspiciously like the
&gt; dedications to the V &amp; A and Lucrece. Same style.
&gt; And most interesting of all, I just found out that Bacon

&gt;&gt; The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia, 1593

&gt;&gt; Dedication

&gt;&gt; T O M Y D E A R E L A D I E
&gt;&gt; AND SISTER, THE COUN-
&gt;&gt; TESSE OF PEMBROKE.

&gt;&gt; H Ere now have you (most deare, and most worthy to be most deare Lady) this
&gt;&gt; idle worke of mine : which I fear (like the Spiders webbe) will be thought
&gt;&gt; fitter to be swept away, then worn to any other purpose. For my part, in
&gt;&gt; very trueth (as the cruell fathers among the Greekes, were woont to doo to
&gt;&gt; the babes they would not foster) I could well find in my harte, to cast out
&gt;&gt; in some desert of forgetfulnes this child, which I am loath to father.
&gt;&gt; But
&gt;&gt; you desired me to doo it, and your desire, to my hart is an absolute
&gt;&gt; commandement. Now, it is done onelie for you, onely to you : if you
&gt;&gt; keepe
&gt;&gt; it to your selfe, or to such friendes, who will weigh errors in the
&gt;&gt; ballaunce of good will, I hope, for the fathers sake, it will be pardoned,
&gt;&gt; perchance made much of, though in it selfe it have deformities. For
&gt;&gt; indeede, for severer eyes it is not, being but a trifle, and that
&gt;&gt; triflinglie handled. Your deare selfe can best witnes the maner, being
&gt;&gt; done in loose sheetes of paper, most of it in your presence, the rest, by
&gt;&gt; sheetes, sent unto you, as fast as they were done. In summe, a young
&gt;&gt; head,
&gt;&gt; not so well stayed as I would it were, (and shall be when God will) having
&gt;&gt; many many fancies begotten in it, if it had not ben in some way delivered,
&gt;&gt; would have growen a monster, &amp; more sorie might I be that they came in,
&gt;&gt; then
&gt;&gt; that they gat out. But his chiefe safetie, shalbe the not walking abroad ;
&gt;&gt;&amp; his chiefe protection, the bearing the liverye of your name ; which (if
&gt;&gt; much much good will do not deceave me) is worthy to be a sanctuary for a
&gt;&gt; greater offender. This say I, because I knowe the vertue so ; and this
&gt;&gt; say I, because it may be ever so ; or to say better, because it will be
&gt;&gt; ever so. Read it then at your idle tymes, and the follyes your good
&gt;&gt; judgement wil finde in it, blame not, but laugh at. And so, looking for
&gt;&gt; no better stuffe, then, as in an Haberdashers shoppe, glasses, or feathers,
&gt;&gt; you will continue to love the writer, who doth excedinglie love you ; and
&gt;&gt; most most hartelie praies you may long live, to be a principall ornament to
&gt;&gt; the familie of the Sidneis.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Surrender. No way did Oxford kiss up to Henry with the

&gt;&gt;&gt; Who taught thee first to sigh, alas, *MY HEART* ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Who taught *thy TONGUE* the woeful *WORDS* of plaint ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Who filled *your EYES* with tears of *BITTER SMART* ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Who gave thee grief and made thy joys to faint ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Who first did paint with colors pale thy face ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Who first did break thy sleeps of quiet rest?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Above the rest in court who gave thee grace ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Who made thee strive in honour to be best ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; In constant truth to bide so firm and sure,
&gt;&gt;&gt; To scorn the world regarding but thy friends ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; With patient mind each passion to endure,
&gt;&gt;&gt; In one desire to settle to the end ?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Love then thy choice wherein such choice thou bind,
&gt;&gt;&gt; As nought but death may ever change thy mind.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Finis.

It would have been most unusual for the Queen to pay off an
embarrassment. Most likely an grevious embarrassment would have died
from a stomach ache, or maybe have its embarr separated from its
assment. With an ax.

Not unless Oxford was the Queen's &quot;premier personal playwright&quot; --
and of course there is no evidence of any kind that he was. And how
exactly would such a grant to the Queen's putative &quot;premier personal

Huh? Robert Stonehouse opined that the *purpose* of the grant was
public, namely, avoidance of the humiliation that would have been
occasioned by the bankruptcy of one of the highest ranking peers (and
incidentally one of the most improvident wastrels) of the realm. Robert
Stonehouse did not claim that the grant itself was bruited about by fast

&gt; religious nature, which freshens the notion that he might have had
&gt; something to do with &quot;translating&quot; the KJV.

"/>

The KJV of the Bible presents the same problem as the Shakespeare
Authorship. Although it is certain that King James authorized the
Bible, which was to correct and amend existing versions, and that he
appointed a group of scholars, 56?, to work on it, after that it gets
mysterious. Each group was assigned different portions of the Bible,
yet there is no evidence of any communication between the scholars,
notes, places of meetings or anything else about the group's
activities. As with the man from Stratford, assumptions are made that
this group wrote it, and then the case made by words such as &quot;must be
the case,&quot;&quot;most assuredly,&quot;&quot;without a doubt,&quot; etc.

The second problem with the KJV is that there is a unity of style to
the entire work as if it had been written by one man. More than one
man has suggested that the two greatest works of the English language
are the KJV and Shakespeare's works. The parallels and knowledge of
the Bible by the author Shakespeare are also quite extraordinary.

Oxfordians are caught in their paradigm of believing that Oxford died
in 1604, although the evidence on that is quite conjectural. While
Oxfordians make the case that the man from Stratford could not be the
author, one of the reasons being that he was not eulogized at his
death, strangely they fall silent as to why there were no public
eulogies of Oxford (Shakespeare or not), burial ceremony or other
public displays concerning his death. He was on good terms with James
I, so why not? Also, there are articles written in SF by a doctor
that say the plague is not the cause of Oxford's death.

Oxford, of course, had a well marked Geneva Bible, and even if not
Shakespeare, his knowledge of the Bible was rather extensive.

To say that Oxford, or whomever, wrote the KJV is not exactly correct.
Rather, it was a combination of editing, rewriting, cleaning up, etc.,
to give it a new unity and freshness. For example, changing passive to
active tense, etc.

However, whoever worked on the Bible seemed to work mostly from the
Geneva Bible, and overlooked the Coverdale Bible, which in some cases
has more poetic merit than the KJV. Remember that strict
interpretation of the original Hebrew was not issue. Here is the
Cloverdale vs. KJV

Job 14:1, 2
Coverdale
Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live and is full
of diverse miseries.
He cometh up and falleth away like a flower

KJV
Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.
He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down.

There is a poetic-literary choice made here. My preference is that the
flower blooms and then falls away, while the KJV chooses to say that
the flower comes forth and then is violently cut down, which is not at
all the sense of the Coverdale, and would seem less appropriate to
flowers. Oh, well, simply a matter of taste.

Here is another set of differences between the Coverdale, Geneva and
KJV.

There is even a loss of meaning from the Coverdale to the Geneva not
corrected in the KJV. Here the man is excused from military duty so
that he may sleep with his wife, and presumably have children. The
sense of this is lost by the KJV. The sense of sexuality and
procreation are lost by the time one gets to the KJV.

Deuteronomy 24:5
Coverdale
When a man hath newly taken a wife, he shall not go out a warfare,
neither shall he be charged with withal. He shall be free in his house
one year long, that he may be merry with his wife which he hath taken.

Geneva
When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go a warfare, neither shall
he be charged with any business, but shall be free at home one year,
and rejoice with his wife which he hath taken.

KJV
When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither
shall he be charged with any business; but he shall be free at home
one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.

The unity of the KJV and the deliberate artistic choices, and a unity
of those choices, indicate that one man was most likely responsible
for the editing of the KJV. Again, a theory much advanced, just there
seem to be no likely candidates around to do the job. Of course,
there is Oxford, but since he died, hardly seems like the case, or did
he not die, but just disappear?

Wrong. By the way, Coverdale didn't even translate from Hebrew; he

In view of the guidelines drawn up before the translation was
undertaken, this unity is not at all surprising, as explained in more
detail below. Briefly, the translators were charged, among other
things, with altering the Bishops' Bible as little as was compatible
with fidelity to the original texts. They were also instructed to
circulate their work among themselves and to reach consensus when
disputes or doubts arose; questions that remained were to be resolved at
a final meeting at the completion of the project.

I own an older edition of &quot;The Lay of the Last Minstrel&quot; and other
works whose editor asserts as an obvious truism that the greatest works
in the English language are those of Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott.
Does Mr. Streiz conclude from this circumstance that the Shakespeare
canon and the Waverley novels were written by the same hand?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Only to someone so completely ignorant of the literature of the
period as to be blithely unaware of the knowledge of the Bible exhibited
by other authors. In any case, the Bible of which Shakespeare made most
use was evidently the Geneva Bible, not the King James version.

True -- compared to those of Mr. Streitz, most Oxfordians' eccentric

That circumstance is not surprising. Oxford was a wastrel and
libertine who botched nearly everything he undertook, abandoned his wife
and children, decamped from a military commmission, and was accused of
pederasty, among other disgraces. Matters being so, praise of Oxford
could only be expected to emanate from those trying to curry favor with
him (e.g., as a possible patron); after his demise, there would be
little point in such toadyish tributes.

If &quot;SF&quot; means what I fear it does, then the reliability of that forum
is about on a par with that of the Weekly World News. The cause of
Oxford's death is, as far as I am aware, still unknown.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Shakespeare, his knowledge of the Bible was rather extensive.

"/>

Huh? The annotations in the Geneva Bible believed to have been
Oxford's certainly do not support such a conclusion. Some books --
among them Joshua, Judges, Ruth, the Song of Solomon, the Lamentations
of Jeremiah, and several minor prophets -- are not marked at all, and
many of the marginalia are concerned with a very few narrow topics
(e.g., usury). This is hardly indicative of &quot;rather extensive&quot;
knowledge of the Bible, except perhaps to someone who has never read
either the Bible or the annotations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; To say that Oxford, or whomever, wrote the KJV is not exactly correct.

"/>

That the above locution is &quot;not exactly correct&quot; is a ridiculous
understatement -- in fact, there is absolutely no evidence that Oxford
had anything whatever to do with the King James Bible (other than to
transgress many of the commandments enumerated therein).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Rather, it was a combination of editing, rewriting, cleaning up, etc.,

Active and passive are not normally considered tenses in English, but
rather voices. For example, an utterance can be in the simple past
tense, but in either the active or the passive voice.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; However, whoever worked on the Bible seemed to work mostly from the
&gt; Geneva Bible, and overlooked the Coverdale Bible, which in some cases

"/>

No, that's wrong. The translators were charged with altering the
Bishops' Bible (*not* the Geneva) as little as was consistent with the
charge of fidelity to the original tongues. Although the translators
may have consulted the Geneva Bible, as would be expected of thorough
scholars, it was not even their primary *translated* source. Indeed,
King James himself opined that he

&quot;...could never yet see a Bible well translated in English; but
I think that, of all, that of Geneva is the worst.&quot;

As for the perceived neglect of the Coverdale Bible, that's probably
because there was no particular reason to consult it except in passing.
As noted above, the translators were instructed to take the Bishops'
Bible as a point of departure, but to bring it into as scrupulous
fidelity to the texts in the original tongues as the scholarship of the
day permitted. The Coverdale was *not* translated from the original
tongues, but rather from the Latin Vulgate and from Luther's German
version -- although in view of Mr. Streitz's previous pratfalls, I
wouldn't be at all surprised to learn that he believed Latin or German
to have been the original tongue of one or both Testaments. (In Mr.
Streitz's bizarre alternative universe in which only one of
Shakespeare's plays is set in a foreign country other than Italy, why
not?)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Remember that strict
&gt; interpretation of the original Hebrew was not issue.

"/>

No, that's flatly wrong, as usual. James was induced to undertake
the project in the first place at the Hampton Court Conference in
January 1604, in part as a result of the exhortations of John Reynolds
of Corpus Christi College, who objected that existing translations were
corrupt and unfaithful to the original. Accordingly, the Resolution
that resulted read in part:

&quot;That a translation be made of the whole Bible, as consonant as
can be to the original Hebrew and Greek....&quot;

The importance of fidelity to the original is underscored by the
decision to permit marginal notes &quot;...for the explanation of the Hebrew
or Greek Words, which cannot without some circumlocution, so briefly and
fitly be expressed in the Text&quot;; this decision was contrary to the
Resolution quoted above, which had stipulated that the new Bible be
prepared &quot;without any marginal notes.&quot;

&gt; Here is the
&gt; Cloverdale vs. KJV

&gt; Job 14:1, 2
&gt; Coverdale
&gt; Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live and is full
&gt; of diverse miseries.
&gt; He cometh up and falleth away like a flower

&gt; KJV
&gt; Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.
&gt; He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down.

&gt; There is a poetic-literary choice made here. My preference is that the
&gt; flower blooms and then falls away, while the KJV chooses to say that
&gt; the flower comes forth and then is violently cut down, which is not at
&gt; all the sense of the Coverdale, and would seem less appropriate to
&gt; flowers. Oh, well, simply a matter of taste.

"/>

No, there is also the matter of fidelity to the original text. Taste
is a seconday consideration.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Here is another set of differences between the Coverdale, Geneva and
&gt; KJV.

&gt; There is even a loss of meaning from the Coverdale to the Geneva not
&gt; corrected in the KJV. Here the man is excused from military duty so
&gt; that he may sleep with his wife, and presumably have children. The
&gt; sense of this is lost by the KJV. The sense of sexuality and
&gt; procreation are lost by the time one gets to the KJV.

&gt; Deuteronomy 24:5
&gt; Coverdale
&gt; When a man hath newly taken a wife, he shall not go out a warfare,
&gt; neither shall he be charged with withal. He shall be free in his house
&gt; one year long, that he may be merry with his wife which he hath taken.

&gt; Geneva
&gt; When a man taketh a new wife, he shall not go a warfare, neither shall
&gt; he be charged with any business, but shall be free at home one year,
&gt; and rejoice with his wife which he hath taken.

&gt; KJV
&gt; When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither
&gt; shall he be charged with any business; but he shall be free at home
&gt; one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.

&gt; The unity of the KJV and the deliberate artistic choices, and a unity
&gt; of those choices, indicate that one man was most likely responsible
&gt; for the editing of the KJV.

"/>

No, once again Mr. Streitz displays rather remarkable ignorance. In
fact, over a dozen rules were adopted to guide the translation. Among
them was

Quite right. But in view of Mr. Streitz's track record for moronic
misconceptions, he probably thinks that Latin is the original tongue of
most of the Old Testament. Perhaps the Vulgate was delivered directly
from Mt. Sinai. Indeed, in Mr. Streitz's world, perhaps &quot;Mene, mene,

Stonehouses shouldn't grow at HLAS.

Agriculture of Massachusetts

by Ralph Waldo Emerson

&lt;&lt;But who is this book written for? Not for farmers; no pains are taken to
send it to them; it was by accident that this copy came into my hands for a
few days. And it is not for them. They could not afford to follow such
advice as is given here; they have sterner teachers; their own business
teaches them better. No; this was written for the literary men. But in that
case, the State should not be taxed to pay for it. Let us see. The account
of the maple sugar, - that is very good and entertaining, and, I suppose,
true. The story of the farmer's daughter, whom education had spoiled for
everything useful on a farm, - that is good too, and we have much that is
like it in Thomas's Almanack. But why this recommendation of stone houses?
They are not so cheap, not so dry, and not so fit for us. Our roads are
always changing their direction, and after a man has built at great cost a
stone house, a new road is opened, and he finds himself a mile or two from
the highway. Then our people are not stationary, like those of old
countries, but always alert to better themselves, and will remove from town
to town as a new market opens, or a better farm is to be had, and do not
wish to spend too much on their buildings.&gt;&gt;

The Ending of Nathaniel Hawthorne's the House of the Seven Gables

by Jan Helten

&lt;&lt;Holgrave gives up his radical ideas and wishes to build a stone house for
Phoebe. He surrenders to her. But since he is only twenty two, it is
understandable that he changes his mind. Baym claims that Holgrave gives up
the idea of life in one's own pace. Holgrave becomes strangely melancholy in
the ending. And it is strange for someone who is about to marry the beloved
fiancee to fall into a brooding mood. He understands that it is impossible
to escape the family heritage. He understands that there is no life without
the influenece of the past. Finally, the house of the seven gables has
sucked him inside. But Phoebe, the radiant, will sunlight his life.

The question whether The House of the Seven Gables is meant bitterly
ironical or the opposite cannot be solved since there is evidence to prove
both varieties.
Remember the death scene where Judge Pyncheon refuses to wake up. This might
be the most prominent scene of Hawthorne's devilish irony. He spends pages
to describe the Judge in his ancestral chair with the climax where a common
housefly is licking death. This irony fills the entire eighteenth chapter!
The final chapter is almost plastered with irony: just a few examples. The
chickens (we recall how they looked in the Garden of the house of the seven
gables) moved to the country already, where they &quot;had forthwith begun an
indefatigable process of egg laying, with an evident design, as a matter of
duty and conscience, to continue their illustrious breed under better
auspices than for a century past&quot; (Hawthorne, p.314). The chickens also give
us a clue about the future prospects. Since they are so well, the
Pyncheon-Maules may be well, too. They are a sign of hope. The image of
houses built of stone or wood occurred several times throughout the book.
Ironically, Holgrave wants to build a house of stone and even more paradox:
the country estate is made of wood, as the house of the seven gables. He is
an ironic image of the inconsistencies of youth. Their wish to take Uncle
Venner with them also implies irony since he is rather plain and ordinary in
opposite to the Pyncheon aristocracy. They take a democratic symbol with
them. He may be a linker between the united struggle of mankind and the
inward nature of the Pyncheon sphere.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Stonehouse is by no means a new settlement - stone cists have been found
indicating that this scenic part of the Avon Valley was inhabited as long
ago as 2000BC. These stone cists were found at St. Ninian's graveyard in the
town and in Patrickholm.&gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Built in 1765, the Old Stone House is believed to be the oldest surviving
building on its original lot in the federal city, predating the creation of
the District of Columbia. Claims persisted for years that George Washington
used the Old Stone House as his headquarters when choosing land in 1791 for
the nation's capital. In the same vein, some thought that Pierre Charles
L'Enfant worked there while he laid out the city's design. The Old Stone
House passed through many hands. The building has served as a residence, a
paint shop, a clock store, a HABERDASHERY, and the office for a used-car
lot. &gt;&gt;
--------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Fine homes lined High Street, and among them was one built by Nathan Starr
in 1831-32. He was an arms manufacturer who was rumored to have made a small
fortune smuggling arms to the South during the Civil War. We know this
house as &quot;Old Stone House.&quot; It was next occupied by The Colton School for
Boys. Harriet Beecher Stowe's son was a pupil there. Notables such as
Charles Dickens frequented the house. It is said that he call High Street
the most beautiful street in America.&gt;&gt;

&quot;Sacred English original&quot;? That's not consistent with any sane
criticism of _any_ retelling of the Gospels, actual or merely hypothetical.

Moreover, the words of the books, in or out of their context,
are by great numbers of British Christians held to be sacrosanct
in such a sense that they must not be expanded, interpreted, or
added to, even in order to set the scene, supply obvious gaps in
the narrative, or elucidate the sense. And this sacrosanctity
is attributed, not to the Greek of the original and only
authentic documents, but to every syllable of a translation made
three hundred years ago (and that not always with perfect
accuracy) in an idiom so old-fashioned that, even as English, it
is often obscure to us or positively misleading. The editor of
a newspaper expressed this point of view very naively when he
said: &quot;In quoting the Bible we must take the Authorized
Version, and not the interpretations of scholars, however wise.&quot;
That is to say, we are to pay attention, not to the
ascertainable meaning of what the Evangelist wrote, but only to
the words (however inexact or unintelligible) used by King
James's translators--who, incidentally, were themselves mere
scholars, however wise.&quot; (Presumably, those of our fellow-
Christians who happen not to speak English are debarred from
quoting the Bible at all, since this gentleman--who is typical--
will allow authority neither to the Greek nor to the Vulgate,
but only to &quot;the sacred English original&quot;.) [Note] Of this
singular piece of idolatry I will say only that it imposes
difficulties upon the English playwright from which the Greek
tragic poets were free. Nor are things made any easier by the
existence, side by side with the instructed and the
bibliolaters, of a large and mostly youthful public to whom
the whole story of Jesus is _terra_ _incognita_ --children who
do not know the meaning of Christmas, men and women to whom
the name of Christ is only a swear-word--besides a
considerable body of agnostics and semi-Christians who accept
some incidents of the story and firmly disbelieve the rest, or
who propose to follow the teaching of Jesus while rejecting
the authority on which He founded it.

[Note] The dispute in this case arose from the fact that the
editor in question, misunderstanding a common Jacobean idiom,
had placed upon a saying of Our Lord an interpretation which
involved a violent wresting of the English text, and could
not legitimately be derived from the Greek at all. [DLS]

Sayers's selective quoting makes it impossible to know what the context
for the phrase 'sacred English original' was, and her coyness as to
exactly which 'common Jacobean idiom' the editor putatively
misunderstood makes her account suspect, in my opinion. I'd like to see
the editor's original article so I could judge for myself. Her
dismissal of the Authorized Version as &quot;old-fashioned&quot; doesn't inspire
confidence - perhaps she found Shakespeare's plays similarly &quot;obscure&quot;
and &quot;misleading.&quot;

Moreover, there is a difference between the earliest known texts of the
Gospels and the 'original and only authentic documents.' So far as I am
aware, there are no extant original and authentic versions of any of the
Gospels. If there was a historical Jesus, he cannot be seen clearly
through the Greek Gospels, in which there are only a few fragments of
the Aramaic he would have spoken; in arguing that we can better
understand Jesus through the Greek he didn't use rather than the English
he didn't use, Sayers hardly seems less naive than the newspaper editor
she quotes.

We've got quite away from the question this thread poses, and I'll put
it up again
-----------------------------------

In August of 2001 Robert Brazil posted this listing below to the
Phaeton group. What's to be noticed is that the stoney broke and
buggering Edward de Vere was admired for some reason or other, and one
wonders what it was. Notice also that several of the books are of a
religious nature, which freshens the notion that he might have had
something to do with &quot;translating&quot; the KJV.

OXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO

Notes:

Franklin Williams' list suggests that the Euphues Anatomy of Wit
reprint of 1617 is dedicated to Oxford, though the original isn't. I
haven't seen the 1617 yet.

In the covert department there are probably many examples beyond
Nashe's
Strange Newes.

One of the most interesting dedications is Angel Daye's The English
Secretary of 1586 which begins:

&quot; Zeuxis endeavoring to paint excellent lie, made grapes in shew so
natural that presenting them to view, men were deceived by their
shapes and the birds with their colors. When Apelles drew Venus ... &quot;
Daye then goes on to flatter Oxford as being in the same category
of talent as Zeuxis and Apelles.

To me, the &quot;killer&quot; aspect of the Oxford dedications books is that so
many are on the list of Bullough's Sources of Shakespeare. And others
probably should be on the list as well.

The &quot;Dedicated to Oxford&quot; books are important because they provide
research vectors - through the texts, through the bibliographic
details, and through the authors and alleged authors of the
works.investigating the authors of the
books, many of whom are cited by Stratfordians as authors of works
used by Shakespeare.

The broader issue to be determined is whether any generalizations can
be formed about what it meant to have a book dedication in those days,
whether contact &amp; friendship between author and recipient can be
reliably inferred, or if patterns of social &amp; 'business' connections
can be reconstructed. An additional issue is: when is a book
dedication a plea for money, and when does it represent pre-paid
patronage ?

Another prickly issue is the spectre of &quot;phony name&quot; authors who might
represent the patron ghosting his own book and dedication (as has been
suggested in the case of Robert Greene's dedication to Oxford in &quot;
Card of Fancie&quot;).

Print shops 400 years ago shared one thing with modern times: up front
cash money to begin the press run. The exception to this rule is when
the printer or publisher (often in an alliance) owned the project or
an interest in it.

What I am trying to determine over time is whether it can be proven
that major patrons of books, like Leicester, Burghley, and Oxford,
took an active interest in some of those books that bear their names,
and that their interest included not just the outlaying of money, but
occasionally some editorial or &quot;publisher&quot; functions. In Oxford's
case, it is seems almost intuitively obvious that de Vere took an
active role in &quot;producing&quot; some of the books, even if that took the
form of delegating the jobs to others and then carefully examining the
results and approving or nixing. &quot;Proving&quot; that involvement is not
going to be easy, but it's a fine challenge.

Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
his art to Virgil:

IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
(&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in
art a Virgil; the earth buries him, the people
mourn him, Olympus possesses him&quot;)

STAY PASSENGER, WHY GOEST THOV BY SO FAST,
READ IF THOV GANST, WHOM ENVIOVS DEATH HATH PLAST
WITH IN THIS MONVMENT SHAKSPEARE: WITH WHOME,
QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,
FAR MORE, THEN COST: SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT,
LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

(&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
[notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
(If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
light of Nature...;&quot;

In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
(Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
- notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
(from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
his will.&quot;

In addition:

That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
appears on the list of players who acted in
&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
of his time due to his close associations with
the court of King James, and would certainly
have heard any rumours involving the Earl
of Oxenforde if there had been any related
to playwrighting.
Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
William Drummond&quot;:

&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
children: but no poet.&quot;

&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
performed what he promised to write, the deeds
of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
world, in some things: his verses of the lost
chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
years old.&quot;

And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
these conversations is quite typical:

&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
criticism with praise:

&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

I remember, the players have often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
circumstance to commend their friend by,
wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
his memory - on this side idolatry - as
much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
an open, and free nature: had an excellent
fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
wherein he flowed with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be
stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
would the rule of it had been so too. Many
times he fell into those things, could not escape
laughter: as when he said in the person of
Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
shows:

&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
Wherein the Graver had a strife
with Nature, to out-doo the life :
O, could he but have drawne his wit
As well in brasse, as he hath hit
His face ; the Print would then surpasse
All, that was ever writ in brasse.
But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
quite convinced that the man who acted in
his plays was a better playwright than
Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
HATH LEFT US.

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
While I confess thy writings to be such
As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
A little further, to make thee a room:
Thou art a monument without a tomb,
And art alive still while thy book doth live
And we have wits to read and praise to give.
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
For if I thought my judgment were of years,
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
Euripides and Sophocles to us;
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
Leave thee alone for the comparison
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an age but for all time!
And all the Muses still were in their prime,
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!
Nature herself was proud of his designs
And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines,
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit,
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes,
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please,
But antiquated and deserted lie,
As they were not of Nature's family.
Yet must I not give Nature all: thy art,
My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part.
For though the poet's matter nature be,
His art doth give the fashion; and, that he
Who casts to write a living line, must sweat,
(Such as thine are) and strike the second heat
Upon the Muses' anvil; turn the same ...

One wonders this only if one has failed to notice that Edward de Vere
was not always stone broke; he ended up broke because he loved to spend
money, and he spent quite a bit of it on the arts, something that
artists seeking patronage could not have failed to notice.

He was also one of the highest-ranking hereditary peers of the realm;
winning his patronage would be a feather in the cap of any lower-middle-
class struggling poet.

Moreover, some of his relatives and employees were writers; see below.

What a pity that most of Shakespeare's sources aren't on the list, then.
How thoughtless it was of Arthur Brooke not to dedicate 'Romeus and

a dedication to Oxford in his histories. Golding could certainly have
dedicated his translation of the Metamorphoses to Oxford instead of
Leicester. And what was Robert Greene thinking when he dedicated 'Carde

&gt; active role in &quot;producing&quot; some of the books, even if that took the
&gt; form of delegating the jobs to others and then carefully examining the
&gt; results and approving or nixing. &quot;Proving&quot; that involvement is not
&gt; going to be easy, but it's a fine challenge.

"/>

Unfortunately for Brazil, what &quot;seems almost intuitively obvious&quot; to him
is not necessarily so to others. Oxford's introductory letter to
_Cardanus Comfort_ indicates that he took an active interest in its
publication, but I don't think there's any similar evidence extant for
the other works dedicated to him. That's not to say that no such
evidence will turn up in the future, but if so, it will be found in
archives rather than at hlas; and even if it is found it will do nothing
to strengthen the case that Oxford wrote Shakespeare's works.

Mr. Streitz would have to clarify what he meant, but I conjectured
that his acronym referred to the Shakespeare Fellowship, aptly
characterized by Dave Kathman as follows:

&quot;The Fellowship is the wack-job splinter group which broke off
from the Shakespeare-Oxford Society over a variety of issues,
but mainly the Prince Tudor 'theory' -- those in the Fellowship
(including Roger Stritmatter and, I believe, Dan Wright) are
sympathetic to the Prince Tudor idea and think it deserves to
be investigated more, while those remaining in the SOS think
it's idiocy which makes Oxfordians look bad. Believe it or not,
there are some Oxfordians with standards, such as they are.
Dan Wright's Edward de Vere Studies Conference, at which
Brame and Popova are speaking (and where I'm sure they'll
be warmly welcomed) is another element of the crazy wack-job
branch of Oxfordians. Diana Price and Pat Dooley are among
the saner branch, though readers of this newsgroup will
recognize from that description that such things are very
much relative.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (and, indeed, the Weekly World News)?

"/>

The Weekly World News is a tabloid that makes the National Enquirer
look like a paragon of journalistic sobriety and circumspection; its
headlines are so ridiculous that not even a moron would take it
seriously, although perhaps the same could be said of some of the more
colorful Oxfordian publications. Those headlines range over a variety
of lurid topics, but revelations concerning space aliens are a recurrent
theme. Like Art Neuendorffer's beloved Brotherblue site, the Weekly
World News helpfully identifies certain celebrities, politicians, etc.
as space aliens, and alerts the reading public to the activities of
various conspiracies. Here are the headlines of some of the current
news stories, from the online edition at

&lt;&gt;:

TERRORISTS RECRUITING ZOMBIE ARMY TO INVADE U.S.

Hillary Clinton was interviewed by Jay Leno on the Tonight Show on

THE UNITED Nations has hatched a secret plan to implant a bar code in

I imagine that Oz must have something similar. Mr. Streitz evidently
adopted the research and fact-checking techniques employed by the staff
of the Weekly World News in writing his book. If you haven't read the
latter, permit me to recommend it enthusiastically -- it is one of the
funniest things I have ever read, and it reduced me to a state of such
helpless laughter while reading the first chapter that I had to leave
the library to avoid disturbing other patrons.

Considering that she took a First in Modern Languages at Oxford in 1915

_One_ of the Gospels (Matthew) is _rumored_ to have had an Aramaic

One letter a year is really enough in the effort toward untwisting a
tangled Web.Still if this feeble nightbird marred by misfortune
persists in beating at the door we are always to expose his ignorance
in yet another area of Elizabethan learning.
Last year he exposed himself as having faked references to his
alleged readings of Abel Lefranc,references which he had repeated here
over a somewhat extended period .
He was also faking references regarding the author of &quot;Shakespeare
Unmasked&quot;(of whom he knew nothing) which we waited until this year to
point out.
Now this is rather more serious as there were(until recently) only
three recorded writers on Rutland as Shakespeare in Russian. And Webb
had managed to get two of their three contributions ,and spellings,
wrong.
In other correspondence addressed to me e also professed to be an
expert on the Golden Dawn(he did not intend to include Tarot cards in
that expertise he recently assured us) but seemed to be ignorant of
the fact that the discussion was in no way concerned with Golden Dawn
but with a number of antecedent organizations from which certain
members, such as W.B.Yeats,later joined the Golden Dawn.
Neither Arthur Edward Waite(who stole the designs of his Tarot pack
from W.B.Yeats and Florence Farr) nor Yeats himself derived their
basic information from materials utilized in the GD.
Today Webb is showing what he does not know about Shakespearean
Hermetic studies ,which are in no way the invention of our good friend
Art N.,but were pioneered in the 20th century(WFC Wigston left curious
nineteenth century memorials) by Abel Lefranc, with whose work Webb
professes intimate knowledge.
Lefranc's work has since been expanded by many volumnes authored by
Dame Frances Yates.
If Webb spent less time lucubrating over Prometheus Press
publications and actually read,just once, one of the authorities he
claims to have read,we would all,just possibly, be better served.
And ,no, I don't take Webb seriously enough to have my typist(I
live six miles travel distance) recheck anything I telephone in to
him.At age twelve he is doing better than Webb was doing a couple of
years ago.And occasionally has done better than Webb since.
Webb is now free to lucubrate indefinitely on these or any other
subjects which he chooses.

Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
his art to Virgil:

IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
(&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in
art a Virgil; the earth buries him, the people
mourn him, Olympus possesses him&quot;)

STAY PASSENGER, WHY GOEST THOV BY SO FAST,
READ IF THOV GANST, WHOM ENVIOVS DEATH HATH PLAST
WITH IN THIS MONVMENT SHAKSPEARE: WITH WHOME,
QVICK NATVRE DIDE WHOSE NAME, DOTH DECK YS TOMBE,
FAR MORE, THEN COST: SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT,
LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

(&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
[notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
(If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
light of Nature...;&quot;

In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
(Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
- notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
(from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
his will.&quot;

In addition:

That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
appears on the list of players who acted in
&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
of his time due to his close associations with
the court of King James, and would certainly
have heard any rumours involving the Earl
of Oxenforde if there had been any related
to playwrighting.
Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
William Drummond&quot;:

&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
children: but no poet.&quot;

&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
performed what he promised to write, the deeds
of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
world, in some things: his verses of the lost
chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
years old.&quot;

And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
these conversations is quite typical:

&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
criticism with praise:

&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

I remember, the players have often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
circumstance to commend their friend by,
wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
his memory - on this side idolatry - as
much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
an open, and free nature: had an excellent
fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
wherein he flowed with that facility, that
sometime it was necessary he should be
stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
would the rule of it had been so too. Many
times he fell into those things, could not escape
laughter: as when he said in the person of
Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
shows:

&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
Wherein the Graver had a strife
with Nature, to out-doo the life :
O, could he but have drawne his wit
As well in brasse, as he hath hit
His face ; the Print would then surpasse
All, that was ever writ in brasse.
But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
quite convinced that the man who acted in
his plays was a better playwright than
Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
HATH LEFT US.

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
While I confess thy writings to be such
As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
A little further, to make thee a room:
Thou art a monument without a tomb,
And art alive still while thy book doth live
And we have wits to read and praise to give.
That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
For if I thought my judgment were of years,
I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
Euripides and Sophocles to us;
Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
Leave thee alone for the comparison
Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
He was not of an age but for all time!
And all the Muses still were in their prime,
When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!
Nature herself was proud of his designs
And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines,
Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit,
As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit.
The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes,
Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please,

&gt; Mr. Streitz would have to clarify what he meant, but I conjectured

&gt;&quot;The Fellowship is the wack-job splinter group which broke off
&gt; from the Shakespeare-Oxford Society over a variety of issues,
&gt; but mainly the Prince Tudor 'theory' -- those in the Fellowship
&gt; (including Roger Stritmatter and, I believe, Dan Wright) are
&gt; sympathetic to the Prince Tudor idea and think it deserves to
&gt; be investigated more, while those remaining in the SOS think
&gt; it's idiocy which makes Oxfordians look bad. Believe it or not,
&gt; there are some Oxfordians with standards, such as they are.
&gt; Dan Wright's Edward de Vere Studies Conference, at which
&gt; Brame and Popova are speaking (and where I'm sure they'll
&gt; be warmly welcomed) is another element of the crazy wack-job
&gt; branch of Oxfordians. Diana Price and Pat Dooley are among
&gt; the saner branch, though readers of this newsgroup will
&gt; recognize from that description that such things are very
&gt; much relative.&quot;

"/>

However sane Dooley and Price may be, they are not Oxfordians; Price used
to be an Oxfordian, and her writings are marred by (among other things) a
clinging to some of the weakest views of some of the least reliable of
Oxfordians; she is perhaps best described as &quot;recovering&quot; but subject to
relapse.

Some Oxfordians in the SF do seem to be fond of the &quot;Prince Tudor&quot; bit,
but it is hardly definitive of the organization. I don't know anybody in
the SF that I would consider insane -- or even more likely to be &quot;wacky&quot;
than antistratfordians outside the SF.

There are antistratfordians of various stripes who are demonstrably
capable of acute insights and even careful research when the topic at hand
does not draw too near their own particular brand of folly. The &quot;Prince
Tudor&quot; bit, as silly as it is, is not much sillier than the &quot;Oxford wrote
almost everything&quot; view promulgated by a number of non-PT Oxfordians.

Joseph Sobran, who I don't believe is a member of the SF, and who does not
seem to accept the PT theory, might be thought one of the &quot;saner&quot;
Oxfordians, but this presumably saner person thinks not only that Oxford
wrote his own poems AND Shakespeare's works but that he also wrote the
sonnets of Sidney, Daniel, Spenser, Daniel, Drayton -- in fact, just about
all the Elizabethan sonnets that we have. See Sobran's essay &quot;The Bard's
Orphans&quot; at

Sobran opens his essay with the words &quot;Maybe I'm crazy.&quot; The editor of
his website ASKED me to put a link to this essay on the Shakespeare
Authorship page, and I of course obliged.

If there is a line separating &quot;saner&quot; Oxfordians from &quot;wack-jobs,&quot; it
cannot reasonably be drawn in such a way as to put the non-PT and non-SF
Sobran in the &quot;saner&quot; camp and the SF in the other. Unlike Sobran, the SF
has also made at least one genuine contribution to the record in
publishing Paul Altrocchi's essay on the annnotation in which Shakespeare
is described as &quot;our Roscius.&quot;

&gt; Here is why Shakespeare is the author of the works attributed to him:

&gt; His name on over forty title pages; his monument in Stratford,
&gt; which quite clearly states that he is a writer, and compares
&gt; his art to Virgil:

&gt; IVDICIO PYLIVM, GENIO SOCRATEM, ARTE MARONEM,
&gt; TERRA TEGIT, POPVLVS MAERET, OLYMPVS HABET.
&gt; (&quot;In judgement a Nestor, in wit a Socrates, in
&gt; art a Virgil; the earth buries him, the people
&gt; mourn him, Olympus possesses him&quot;)

&gt; FAR MORE, THEN COST: SIEH ALL, YT HE HATH WRITT,
&gt; LEAVES LIVING ART, BVT PAGE, TO SERVE HIS WITT.

&gt; (&quot;SIEH&quot; is a typo for &quot;Sith&quot;)

&gt; Robert Greene's attack on Shakespeare in Greene's Groatsworth
&gt; of Wit (1592), where he paraphrases a play by Shakespeare while
&gt; referring to &quot;Shake-scene&quot;, a clear pun on his name; the
&gt; Parnassus plays (1598-1601), where Shakespeare is mentioned by name
&gt; and Venus and Adonis and Romeo &amp; Juliet are parodied, and
&gt; where Shakespeare is said to have &quot;put them [university playwrights]
&gt; all down, aye, and Ben Jonson too&quot;; Gabriel Harvey (nlt 1603), who said
&gt;&quot;The younger sort takes much delight in Shakespeares Venus, &amp;
&gt; Adonis: but his Lucrece, &amp; his tragedie of Hamlet, Prince of
&gt; Denmarke, have it in them, to please the wiser sort,&quot; and who
&gt; called Shakespeare &quot;one of our florishing metricians;&quot; and
&gt; Francis Meres (1598), who said &quot;...so the English tongue is mightily
&gt; enriched, and gorgeously invested in rare ornaments and
&gt; resplendent abiliments by sir Philip Sidney, Spencer, Daniel,
&gt; Drayton, Warner, Shakespeare, Marlow and Chapman....&quot;
&gt; [notice that he distinguishes between Marlowe and Shakespeare
&gt; and mentions Oxenforde separately in another section as well]
&gt; and who also said that Shakespeare was one of England's
&gt;&quot;best Lyrick Poets&quot; and &quot;our best for tragedie&quot; and among the
&gt;&quot;best Poets for Comedy&quot; and &quot;the most passionate among us
&gt; to bewaile and bemoane the perplexities of Love;&quot; and
&gt; Francis Beaumont (1608), who said &quot;...here I would let slippe/
&gt; (If I had any in mee) schollershippe,/ And from all Learning keepe
&gt; these lines as cleere/ as Shakespeare's best are, which our
&gt; heires shall heare/ Preachers apte to their auditors to showe/
&gt; how farre sometimes a mortall man may goe/ by the dimme
&gt; light of Nature...;&quot;

&gt; In 1604 appeared Antony Scolloker's &quot;Diaphantus; or, the
&gt; Passions of Love.&quot; In his preface, telling us what an epistle
&gt; to the reader should be, Scolloker writes: &quot;It should be like
&gt; the Never-too-well read Arcadia, where the Prose and verce
&gt; (Matters and Words) are like his Mistresses eyes, one still
&gt; excelling another and without Co-rivall: or to come home to
&gt; the vulgars Element, like Friendly Shakespeare's Tragedies,
&gt; where the Commedian rides, when the Tragedian stands on
&gt; tip-toe: Faith it should please all, like Prince Hamlet.
&gt; It's difficult to see how Scolloker could refer to Shakespeare as
&gt;&quot;friendly&quot; unless he knew him personally.

&gt; http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ahnelson/price.html:
&gt;&quot;a letter survives in the hand of Leonard Digges, who in 1613
&gt; compared the sonnets of Lope de Vega to those of &quot;our Will Shakespeare&quot;
&gt; - notice the use of the familiar &quot;Will&quot; by a close neighbor of Shakespeare's
&gt; in both Aldermarston and in London....Leonard Digges was the step-son
&gt; (from 1603) of Thomas Russell, a man who was not only a neighbor of
&gt; Shakespeare's both in London and in Stratford, but whom Shakespeare
&gt; remembered in his will, and indeed appointed one of the two overseers of
&gt; his will.&quot;

&gt; In addition:

&gt; That Jonson was acquainted with Shakespeare
&gt; personally is indisputable: Shakespeare's name
&gt; appears on the list of players who acted in
&gt;&quot;Every Man in His Humour&quot;, and Jonson's
&gt; extended comments upon Shakespeare in his
&gt;&quot;Timber&quot; (see below) are proof of that: he
&gt; says that Shakespeare was &quot;(indeed) honest,
&gt; and of an open, and free nature:&quot; and that
&gt; he &quot;loved the man&quot;. Jonson, moreover, was
&gt; familiar with many of the nobility and gentleman
&gt; of his time due to his close associations with
&gt; the court of King James, and would certainly
&gt; have heard any rumours involving the Earl
&gt; of Oxenforde if there had been any related
&gt; to playwrighting.
&gt; Jonson's comments on his contemporaries were
&gt; typically a mix of praise and censure. Here
&gt; are some examples from &quot;Conversations with
&gt; William Drummond&quot;:

&gt;&quot;Samuel Daniel was a good honest man, had no
&gt; children: but no poet.&quot;

&gt;&quot;That Michael Drayton's Poly-Olbion (if he had
&gt; performed what he promised to write, the deeds
&gt; of all the worthies) had been excellent: his
&gt; long verses pleased him not.&quot;

&gt;&quot;He esteemeth John Donne the first poet in the
&gt; world, in some things: his verses of the lost
&gt; chain he hath by heart; and that passage of
&gt; 'The Calm', that dust and feathers do not stir,
&gt; all was so quiet. Affirmeth Donne to have written
&gt; all his best pieces ere he was twenty-five
&gt; years old.&quot;

&gt; And many more. His comment on Shakespeare in
&gt; these conversations is quite typical:

&gt;&quot;Shakespeare, in a play, brought in a number of men
&gt; saying they had suffered shipwreck in Bohemia, where there
&gt; is no sea near by some 100 miles.&quot;

&gt; In &quot;Timber: or Discoveries&quot;, Jonson again mixes
&gt; criticism with praise:

&gt;&quot;De Shakespeare Nostrat

&gt; I remember, the players have often
&gt; mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that
&gt; in his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never
&gt; blotted out line. My answer hath been, would
&gt; he had blotted a thousand. Which they thought
&gt; a malevolent speech. I had not told posterity
&gt; this, but for their ignorance, who choose that
&gt; circumstance to commend their friend by,
&gt; wherein he most faulted. And to justify mine
&gt; own candour (for I loved the man, and do honour
&gt; his memory - on this side idolatry - as
&gt; much as any). He was (indeed) honest, and of
&gt; an open, and free nature: had an excellent
&gt; fancy; brave notions, and gentle expressions:
&gt; wherein he flowed with that facility, that
&gt; sometime it was necessary he should be
&gt; stopped: sufflaminandus erat; as Augustus said
&gt; of Haterius. His wit was in his own power;
&gt; would the rule of it had been so too. Many
&gt; times he fell into those things, could not escape
&gt; laughter: as when he said in the person of
&gt; Caesar, one speaking to him; &quot;Caesar, thou
&gt; dost me wrong'. He replied: 'Caesar did never
&gt; wrong, but with just cause': and such like;
&gt; which were ridiculous. But he redeemed his
&gt; vices, with his virtues. There was ever more in
&gt; him to be praised, than to be pardoned.&quot;

&gt; Jonson clearly doesn't feel that the portrait
&gt; in the Folio does Shakespeare any justice
&gt; as far as portraying his wit, as his little poem
&gt; shows:

&gt;&quot;This Figure, that thou here seest put,
&gt; It was for gentle Shakespeare cut,
&gt; Wherein the Graver had a strife
&gt; with Nature, to out-doo the life :
&gt; O, could he but have drawne his wit
&gt; As well in brasse, as he hath hit
&gt; His face ; the Print would then surpasse
&gt; All, that was ever writ in brasse.
&gt; But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
&gt; Not on his Picture, but his Booke.&quot;

&gt; And finally, Jonson's masterful eulogy
&gt; for Shakespeare, where he seems to be
&gt; quite convinced that the man who acted in
&gt; his plays was a better playwright than
&gt; Marlowe, and worthy of Euripides and
&gt; Sophocles. Notice that he calls Shakespeare
&gt; the &quot;sweet swan of Avon&quot;, not the &quot;tempestuous
&gt; tin-miner of tuxbury&quot; or some such:

&gt;&quot;TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED THE AUTHOR,
&gt; MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, AND WHAT HE
&gt; HATH LEFT US.

&gt; To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name,
&gt; Am I thus ample to thy book and fame;
&gt; While I confess thy writings to be such
&gt; As neither man nor muse can praise too much;
&gt; 'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways
&gt; Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise;
&gt; For seeliest ignorance on these may light,
&gt; Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right;
&gt; Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance
&gt; The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance;
&gt; Or crafty malice might pretend this praise,
&gt; And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise.
&gt; These are, as some infamous bawd or whore
&gt; Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more?
&gt; But thou art proof against them, and indeed,
&gt; Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need.
&gt; I therefore will begin. Soul of the age!
&gt; The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage!
&gt; My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by
&gt; Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie
&gt; A little further, to make thee a room:
&gt; Thou art a monument without a tomb,
&gt; And art alive still while thy book doth live
&gt; And we have wits to read and praise to give.
&gt; That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses,
&gt; I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses,
&gt; For if I thought my judgment were of years,
&gt; I should commit thee surely with thy peers,
&gt; And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine,
&gt; Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line.
&gt; And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek,
&gt; From thence to honour thee, I would not seek
&gt; For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus,
&gt; Euripides and Sophocles to us;
&gt; Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead,
&gt; To life again, to hear thy buskin tread,
&gt; And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on,
&gt; Leave thee alone for the comparison
&gt; Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome
&gt; Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come.
&gt; Triumph, my Britain, thou hast one to show
&gt; To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe.
&gt; He was not of an age but for all time!
&gt; And all the Muses still were in their prime,
&gt; When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm
&gt; Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm!
&gt; Nature herself was proud of his

Thank you, Terry.

Just to put the record straight (again) the Shakespeare Fellowship is
not a a &quot;PT&quot; splinter group. It's actually not a splinter group of any
kind, simply an organization which now has just about as many members
as the SOS and which is using different means to arrive, presumably,
at the same ends.

Dan Wright is not an supporter of the Tudor Heir theory, neither am I,
nor are many others. We are Oxfordians of all stripes who are striving
to be open and pursue various areas of research. This, as you know,
includes having non-Oxfordians as members or speakers and listening in
a respectful way to what they have to say. There are still many
advocates of the Prince Tudor theory in the SOS, by the way, and there
are many Oxfordians who are members of both organizations.

With regard to Joe Sobran: unlike Terry, the Shakespeare Fellowship
does not link to his site, nor have we invited him to become a member,
because of his unpleasant &quot;hate&quot; articles on Jews, homosexuals, etc.

I am sorry that David K chose to characterize the SF in such a
negative way, especially as I've always had polite dealings with him
and he's helped me in the past with research for my novels. He clearly
has no idea why the Fellowship chose to form a new group and his
theories are completely and rather devastatingly wrong.

Best wishes,
Lynne
Vice President, Shakespeare Fellowship

"/>

Dr. Paul Altrocchi wrote a rather interesting and cogent article in
Shakespeare Matters (&quot;It was not Ye Plague&quot;) which indicated that
although many Oxfordians have believed for some time that Oxford died
of the plague, there is no evidence to suppose that he did. There were
no cases of plague in Hackney in July of 1604. The last &quot;sporadic&quot;
recorded case was in June. Altrocchi conducted more research and also
examined the death records. There was no diagnosis of &quot;Ye Plague&quot; next
to the entry for Edward de Vere.

I am a little more skeptical. It's well known that the rich could
&quot;bargain&quot; the plague tag away so they didn't have to observe
quarantine. But you are arguing *with* Altrocchi, David--although his
forum is, according to you, &quot;about on a par with that of the Weekly
World News&quot;--not against him, as he too believes the cause of Oxford's
death is unknown. Although he leans towards a diagnosis of Myocardial
Infarction (I believe Altrocchi is a cardiologist), and gives reasons
for his theory, the last sentence of the article reads: &quot;There is
insufficient evidence to allow a conclusive diagnosis of De Vere's
death at the age of 54.&quot;

David Kathman and I link to a host of antistratfordian sites (see the

the most prominent Oxfordians of the day (granted that &quot;prominent

In my other life I manage the website of the Baltimore Bird Club -- an

all of the club's online material is freely available to members and

We ask for dues to support the newsletter which comes out four times a
year, Terry, not to support the site, the articles on which are free
to all. But I agree, you do a very good job with your bardlinks. We
have a difference of opinion, that's all, where Sobran is concerned.
You believe in freedom of speech above all. I believe in freedom of
speech unless the material concerned comes under the heading of hate
literature (perhaps that really is an oxymoron). The Shakespearean
articles on Sobran's site link to others which are not so salubrious.
I live in Canada where we have laws which prohibit such material, and
I'm glad of it.

I also think it behooves us as an Oxfordian organization not to get
tarred with Sobran's nasty, sticky, and broad-stroked brush.

But here's a howdy do, as the folk in The Mikado would say: An
Oxfordian arguing against inclusion of Sobran links, and a
Stratfordian arguing for them. :)

&gt; although many Oxfordians have believed for some time that Oxford died
&gt; of the plague, there is no evidence to suppose that he did. There were
&gt; no cases of plague in Hackney in July of 1604. The last &quot;sporadic&quot;
&gt; recorded case was in June. Altrocchi conducted more research and also
&gt; examined the death records. There was no diagnosis of &quot;Ye Plague&quot; next
&gt; to the entry for Edward de Vere.

"/>

The &quot;death from the plague excuse&quot; was quite common
in England even when there were no plagues because it
was a way to keep curious mourners away from a funeral
so that the Catholics could arrange a private burial--like Oxford's--
to conceal the fact that the deceased was a Catholic.

The description of Oxford's burial is typical--his
body was swaddled in a winding-sheet so the identity
of the corpse could not be known.. My guess is
that excavation will show that like Beaumont and the
Stratford Catholic, Oxford's tomb will prove to be
empty or have an older child's remains in it--Oxford
was a tiny little man.

Oxford himself--a radical Catholic according
to the Jesuit documents on Oxford's &quot;reconcilation with
Catholicism&quot; kept at the Jesuit English College at Rome
[Fr. Thomas McCoog, SJ]--would have then been taken to
sanctified ground and buried on top of some Catholic
relative.

Needless to say, Oxford's Catholicism disqualifies him
as author of the Shakespeare works not to speak of
annotator of the Folger Geneva Bible. The juvenile
handwriting is probably Anne Cecil's whose family
were closet Calvinists. The &quot;text&quot; of the annotations
is Protestant, not Anglican or Catholic.

The big doctrinal dispute between the Anglicans
and Catholics was over Death Itself and English
Roman Catholics were totally paranoid about being
buried among Anglican &quot;heretics&quot; in unhallowed
ground. Conformity put a real strain on Catholics
in England, particularly since the doctrines on death
were so antithetical and when Catholics died they had
to be prepared to stage a fake funeral.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I am a little more skeptical. It's well known that the rich could
&gt;&quot;bargain&quot; the plague tag away so they didn't have to observe
&gt; quarantine. But you are arguing *with* Altrocchi, David--although his
&gt; forum is, according to you, &quot;about on a par with that of the Weekly
&gt; World News&quot;--not against him, as he too believes the cause of Oxford's
&gt; death is unknown.

"/>

Webb is just defending when he brings up Weekly World
News. Like Weekly World News, Webb refuses to do the
slightest research, he's intellectually lazy in the extreme
and often gets things wrong, for example his opinion of
Rips bible code which is universally dissed--even Orthodox
Jewish physicists maintain websites refuting Rips--and
his opinon of Akrigg's assessment of Southampton's
homosexuality is another Webbian denial which I'll be
correcting with quotes from Akrigg himself.

You can't get anything through Webb's skull--I've posted
Southampton's cross-dressing portrait repeatedly--that's
a sweet little dress Southampton is wearing and a very
tight corset beneath it--but Webb keeps raving on about
my allegedly wrong claim that Southampton was a
cross-dresser. Only 400 magazine and journal articles
back me up and I posted at least 40 urls to Webb which
he ignored.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Although he leans towards a diagnosis of Myocardial
&gt; Infarction (I believe Altrocchi is a cardiologist),

"/>

Altrocchi is exactly right about the &quot;Roscio&quot; emendation
in Camden--a discovery that will bite--but myocardial
infarction is a tissue event for lack of a better word, and
hard to diagnose unless you have a list of symptoms made
by a contemporary witness--Oxfordians are hopelessly
weak on their understanding of the need for witnesses--
nothing is fact unless it is reliably witnesses--or have the
corpse itself to dissect.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and gives reasons
&gt; for his theory, the last sentence of the article reads: &quot;There is
&gt; insufficient evidence to allow a conclusive diagnosis of De Vere's
&gt; death at the age of 54.&quot;

"/>

There are some big clues in Harvey's account with his stay
at Oxford's estate in his letter to Immerito. Oxford had a
&quot;copper beak&quot; according to Harvey and that is very close
to the slur against those that had the pox. The victims
had an bright orangy-red infected nose.

A second possibility is death by alcoholism, a very common
disease among Elizabethans since the drinking water in
England was so fetid even infants were given beer to drink
because it was the only alternative to death by dysentery.

There are at least two sources that identify Oxford as an
alcoholic.

Harvey flatly states it--Oxford gets up in the morning
intending to write poetry, he starts drinking at noon and
by afternoon assigns his sonnets to Harvey.

Jonson also calls Oxford the &quot;Oracle of the Bottle,&quot; a
reference to Oxford's alcoholism and the Bottle of State
or whatever it was, a flask that Oxford was required to
carry on a pillow during Occasions of State. Since Oxford
was a tiny little thing it must have been quite amusing to
see him at the head of the processions.

Jonson also takes the opportunity to dismiss Oxford's
authorship of the Shakespeare works in The Staple of News.
Jonson would be the one to know.

O dear. I wrote a long reply to this but it disappeared into the
ether. It might turn up. Who knows? I don't have the energy to rewrite
but would just like to say the following:

I am personally uncomfortable with what Sobran writes. I don't believe
anyone who spews hate should be allowed a forum under the guise of
&quot;freedom of speech,&quot; whatever his or her view on the authorship
question. Aren't you uncomfortable with some of your fellow
travellers?

I don't know Sam Sloan at all. His web page, though, is a disgrace.

I have no knowledge of PWBard's supposed anti-Catholicism either, so
can't comment. Am not often on HLAS, am just between books at the
moment, so am not au courant with many of the posts.

I don't agree with Streitz that AIDS is a hoax, and know nothing of
Crowley's nationalism, but cannot see either as a deliberate and
vicious smear campaign against minority or other groups.

Art's posts, which I've read elsewhere, are absolutely harmless, often
interesting, and to yoke his name with that of Sobran's is to do him a
grave injustice.

Terry knows I would never smear him, even subtly, though I thank you
for understanding I have the capacity to be subtle. I consider him a
friend, exceptionally well-read, exceptionally knowledgeable about
Elizabethan history and literature, Stratfordian though he is,
&quot;Oxfraudian&quot; though you believe me to be.

Best wishes,
Lynne

Sobran considers his unorthodox views on various historical and political
questions to be interrelated. Just as he departs from the orthodox views
about World War II and AIDS, so he also is an Oxfordian. For him, his
various dissents are signs of his own brave openness to views that
scholarly and political establishments not merely reject but, he thinks,
suppress.

There are some antistratfordians whose views on the authorship of
Shakespeare's works are linked to their beliefs in the actuality of
Atlantis, or visits to earth by intelligent extraterrestrial creatures, or
extrasensory perception, or any number of other notions that might be
classed as &quot;pseudo-science&quot; by such writers as Martin Gardner or James
Randi. Of course, it is also possible to be an antistratfordian whose
unorthodox views on this one issue are not part of a general opposition to
the views of a large number of scholarly communities, just as it is
possible to believe that Shakespeare wrote the works generally attributed
to him AND to believe in flying saucers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; But here's a howdy do, as the folk in The Mikado would say: An Oxfordian
&gt; arguing against inclusion of Sobran links, and a Stratfordian arguing

"/>

You are free to link or not to link to Sobrans's or anybody else's pages
as you see fit; I am not arguing that you should not be free to decide as
you like.

I do not call myself a &quot;Stratfordian&quot;; I do not have different procedures
for evaluating the evidence for Shakespeare's authorship of his works than
I would use for other authors, but I know of no antistratfordian &quot;case&quot;
that is not based on the use of special interpretive rules and special
pleading.

In some ways, the &quot;Bacon wrote everything&quot; (and its parody the &quot;Oxford
wrote everything&quot;) views attest to a kind of partial integrity among some
antistratfordians. Given that antistratfordians must replace the methods
used by genuine literary historians with whatever they find in their own
toolkits, it is inevitable that some will ask, &quot;what if we apply the
methods we use to prove that X wrote Shakespeare to authors other than
Shakespeare?&quot; Since those methods generate false positives for
Shakespeare, they may also generate false positives for other writers as
well (&quot;what do you know -- X was not only Shakespeare but also Golding,
Nashe, Sidney, Lyly, Spenser, Drayton, Greene, etc.&quot;).

The strange thing about the &quot;X wrote everything&quot; antistratfordians is that
while their limited integrity leads them to test their methods on other
authors, it does not compel them to doubt the validity of those methods.
Sobran hears his &quot;methods&quot; whisper to him that Sidney's *Astrophil &amp;
Stella*, Spenser's *Amoretti*, Drayton's *Idea*, and *Shakespeare's
Sonnets* were all written by the same person; if he were less impaired by
his emotional commitment to antistratfordianism, he might have the wit to
realize that the more different authors his methods show were really
Oxford, the more he demonstrates the utter worthlessness of those methods
and his own limitations as a reader.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I, so why not? Also, there are articles written in SF by a doctor
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that say the plague is not the cause of Oxford's death.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If &quot;SF&quot; means what I fear it does, then the reliability of that forum
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; is about on a par with that of the Weekly World News. The cause of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxford's death is, as far as I am aware, still unknown.

&gt;&gt; Dr. Paul Altrocchi wrote a rather interesting and cogent article in
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare Matters (&quot;It was not Ye Plague&quot;) which indicated that
&gt;&gt; although many Oxfordians have believed for some time that Oxford died
&gt;&gt; of the plague, there is no evidence to suppose that he did. There were
&gt;&gt; no cases of plague in Hackney in July of 1604. The last &quot;sporadic&quot;
&gt;&gt; recorded case was in June. Altrocchi conducted more research and also
&gt;&gt; examined the death records. There was no diagnosis of &quot;Ye Plague&quot; next
&gt;&gt; to the entry for Edward de Vere.

&gt; The &quot;death from the plague excuse&quot; was quite common
&gt; in England even when there were no plagues because it
&gt; was a way to keep curious mourners away from a funeral
&gt; so that the Catholics could arrange a private burial--like Oxford's--
&gt; to conceal the fact that the deceased was a Catholic.

&gt; The description of Oxford's burial is typical--his
&gt; body was swaddled in a winding-sheet so the identity
&gt; of the corpse could not be known.. My guess is
&gt; that excavation will show that like Beaumont and the
&gt; Stratford Catholic, Oxford's tomb will prove to be
&gt; empty or have an older child's remains in it--Oxford
&gt; was a tiny little man.

&gt; Oxford himself--a radical Catholic according
&gt; to the Jesuit documents on Oxford's &quot;reconcilation with
&gt; Catholicism&quot; kept at the Jesuit English College at Rome
&gt; [Fr. Thomas McCoog, SJ]--would have then been taken to
&gt; sanctified ground and buried on top of some Catholic
&gt; relative.

&gt; Needless to say, Oxford's Catholicism disqualifies him
&gt; as author of the Shakespeare works not to speak of
&gt; annotator of the Folger Geneva Bible. The juvenile
&gt; handwriting is probably Anne Cecil's whose family
&gt; were closet Calvinists. The &quot;text&quot; of the annotations
&gt; is Protestant, not Anglican or Catholic.

&gt; The big doctrinal dispute between the Anglicans
&gt; and Catholics was over Death Itself and English
&gt; Roman Catholics were totally paranoid about being
&gt; buried among Anglican &quot;heretics&quot; in unhallowed
&gt; ground. Conformity put a real strain on Catholics
&gt; in England, particularly since the doctrines on death
&gt; were so antithetical and when Catholics died they had
&gt; to be prepared to stage a fake funeral.

&gt;&gt; I am a little more skeptical. It's well known that the rich could
&gt;&gt;&quot;bargain&quot; the plague tag away so they didn't have to observe
&gt;&gt; quarantine. But you are arguing *with* Altrocchi, David--although his
&gt;&gt; forum is, according to you, &quot;about on a par with that of the Weekly
&gt;&gt; World News&quot;--not against him, as he too believes the cause of Oxford's
&gt;&gt; death is unknown.

&gt; Webb is just defending when he brings up Weekly World
&gt; News. Like Weekly World News, Webb refuses to do the
&gt; slightest research, he's intellectually lazy in the extreme
&gt; and often gets things wrong, for example his opinion of
&gt; Rips bible code which is universally dissed--even Orthodox
&gt; Jewish physicists maintain websites refuting Rips--and
&gt; his opinon of Akrigg's assessment of Southampton's
&gt; homosexuality is another Webbian denial which I'll be
&gt; correcting with quotes from Akrigg himself.

&gt; You can't get anything through Webb's skull--I've posted
&gt; Southampton's cross-dressing portrait repeatedly--that's
&gt; a sweet little dress Southampton is wearing and a very
&gt; tight corset beneath it--but Webb keeps raving on about
&gt; my allegedly wrong claim that Southampton was a
&gt; cross-dresser. Only 400 magazine and journal articles
&gt; back me up and I posted at least 40 urls to Webb which
&gt; he ignored.

&gt;&gt; Although he leans towards a diagnosis of Myocardial
&gt;&gt; Infarction (I believe Altrocchi is a cardiologist),

&gt; Altrocchi is exactly right about the &quot;Roscio&quot; emendation
&gt; in Camden--a discovery that will bite--but myocardial
&gt; infarction is a tissue event for lack of a better word, and
&gt; hard to diagnose unless you have a list of symptoms made
&gt; by a contemporary witness--Oxfordians are hopelessly
&gt; weak on their understanding of the need for witnesses--
&gt; nothing is fact unless it is reliably witnesses--or have the
&gt; corpse itself to dissect.

&gt;&gt; and gives reasons
&gt;&gt; for his theory, the last sentence of the article reads: &quot;There is
&gt;&gt; insufficient evidence to allow a conclusive diagnosis of De Vere's
&gt;&gt; death at the age of 54.&quot;

&gt; There are some big clues in Harvey's account with his stay
&gt; at Oxford's estate in his letter to Immerito. Oxford had a
&gt;&quot;copper beak&quot; according to Harvey and that is very close
&gt; to the slur against those that had the pox. The victims
&gt; had an bright orangy-red infected nose.

&gt; A second possibility is death by alcoholism, a very common
&gt; disease among Elizabethans since the drinking water in
&gt; England was so fetid even infants were given beer to drink
&gt; because it was the only alternative to death by dysentery.

&gt; There are at least two sources that identify Oxford as an
&gt; alcoholic.

&gt; Harvey flatly states it--Oxford gets up in the morning
&gt; intending to write poetry, he starts drinking at noon and
&gt; by afternoon assigns his sonnets to Harvey.

&gt; Jonson also calls Oxford the &quot;Oracle of the Bottle,&quot; a
&gt; reference to Oxford's alcoholism and the Bottle of State
&gt; or whatever it was, a flask that Oxford was required to
&gt; carry on a pillow during Occasions of State. Since Oxford
&gt; was a tiny little thing it must have been quite amusing to
&gt; see him at the head of the processions.

&gt; Jonson also takes the opportunity to dismiss Oxford's
&gt; authorship of the Shakespeare works in The Staple of News.
&gt; Jonson would be the one to know.

&gt; Elizabeth, I wanted out of this thread but I'm fascinated. How do you

&gt; when he died?

&gt; Oxford's tomb, by the way? In Hackney or Westminster or elsewhere?
&gt; There are conflicting accounts of where he was buried, I believe, and
&gt; as far as I know, there is no tomb extant.

&gt;&gt; Needless to say, Oxford's Catholicism disqualifies him
&gt;&gt; as author of the Shakespeare works not to speak of

&gt; Why would the handwriting be Anne Cecil's? Have you compared her

&gt; expert go over your comparisons? What was the outcome?

&gt; Thanks for the information. I try to learn a bit more every day.

&gt;&gt; We ask for dues to support the newsletter which comes out four times a

&gt;&gt; all.

&gt; The Baltimore Bird Club asks for dues to support its activities and

&gt; have published our newsletters online for the past eight years and have
&gt; made them available to all.

That's wonderful. Please send the url. I'd like to know more about
Maryland birds. The flora and fauna were in general so different (when
I visited, and I assume always) from those of Toronto. I was surprised
at how tropical everything looked to me, your neighbour to the north.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But I agree, you do a very good job with your bardlinks. We have a
&gt;&gt; difference of opinion, that's all, where Sobran is concerned. You
&gt;&gt; believe in freedom of speech above all. I believe in freedom of speech
&gt;&gt; unless the material concerned comes under the heading of hate literature
&gt;&gt; (perhaps that really is an oxymoron).

&gt; I don't consider Sobran's Shakespeare/Oxford essays &quot;hate
&gt; literature&quot; -- I don't even think they display a hatred of genuine
&gt; scholarship.

"/>

Agreed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As for Sobran's other and viler writings, I would not want
&gt; him to be prohibited from putting them online.

&gt;&gt; The Shakespearean articles on Sobran's site link to others which are not
&gt;&gt; so salubrious.

&gt; The man's own essays indict him more powerfully than I could.

"/>

I agree here too. But you are an intelligent person and you read his
writing critically. Many others may not. His quite unreasonable hatred
of certain groups could be seen by some as a rallying cry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I live in Canada where we have laws which prohibit such material, and
&gt;&gt; I'm glad of it.

&gt; I'd rather not have a government protect me in that way.

"/>

Is there something that the government should protect us from? Would
you link to a writer who had an interest in Shakespeare if he'd
written a book such as Mein Kampf, and material from the book appeared
somewhere else on his website? Does your tolerance for free speech
have a limit?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; I also think it behooves us as an Oxfordian organization not to get
&gt;&gt; tarred with Sobran's nasty, sticky, and broad-stroked brush.

&gt; Sobran considers his unorthodox views on various historical and political
&gt; questions to be interrelated. Just as he departs from the orthodox views
&gt; about World War II and AIDS, so he also is an Oxfordian. For him, his
&gt; various dissents are signs of his own brave openness to views that
&gt; scholarly and political establishments not merely reject but, he thinks,
&gt; suppress.

&gt; There are some antistratfordians whose views on the authorship of
&gt; Shakespeare's works are linked to their beliefs in the actuality of
&gt; Atlantis, or visits to earth by intelligent extraterrestrial creatures, or
&gt; extrasensory perception, or any number of other notions that might be
&gt; classed as &quot;pseudo-science&quot; by such writers as Martin Gardner or James
&gt; Randi.

"/>

Right. I'd rather not be associated with those beliefs...although
maybe Atlantis did exist...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Of course, it is also possible to be an antistratfordian whose
&gt; unorthodox views on this one issue are not part of a general opposition to
&gt; the views of a large number of scholarly communities, just as it is
&gt; possible to believe that Shakespeare wrote the works generally attributed
&gt; to him AND to believe in flying saucers.

"/>

You mean there's no such thing as flying saucers? O damn. :) (I've
added the emoticon so Spam Scone doesn't call me a weird sister again.
But maybe he will anyway.) I think one must take into account that in
general the consensus among Stratfordians (forgive the
term--traditionalists?) seems to be that only Anti-Strats have strange
notions, are nutters, wacks, etc. Therefore it is wise to separate
oneself or one's organization from such views. To my mind it becomes
imperative when the notions are not harmless, when, in fact, they are
both hate-mongering and hateful.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; But here's a howdy do, as the folk in The Mikado would say: An Oxfordian
&gt;&gt; arguing against inclusion of Sobran links, and a Stratfordian arguing
&gt;&gt; for them. :)

&gt; You are free to link or not to link to Sobrans's or anybody else's pages
&gt; as you see fit; I am not arguing that you should not be free to decide as
&gt; you like.

"/>

Thank you. I didn't think you were.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; I do not call myself a &quot;Stratfordian&quot;; I do not have different procedures
&gt; for evaluating the evidence for Shakespeare's authorship of his works than
&gt; I would use for other authors, but I know of no antistratfordian &quot;case&quot;
&gt; that is not based on the use of special interpretive rules and special
&gt; pleading.

"/>

No, the rules are different from the ones you use, that's all. My
rules--I can't speak for the views of others--are contingent to some
extent on the idea that autobiographical detail is always, in some
way, displayed in one's work. Writers can't help it, I believe. We
accept that concept very readily with regard to authors such as
Dickens and Hardy. I'm very aware that Shakespeare was a great genius
whilst I'm only a lowly poet and young adult author. But please,
anyway, read my new book, The Thought of High Windows, when it comes
out in spring. I'll send you a copy. You'll recognise almost everyone
in it although it purports to be about the Holocaust (you'll be glad
to know you're not portrayed--maybe next time).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In some ways, the &quot;Bacon wrote everything&quot; (and its parody the &quot;Oxford
&gt; wrote everything&quot;) views attest to a kind of partial integrity among some
&gt; antistratfordians. Given that antistratfordians must replace the methods
&gt; used by genuine literary historians with whatever they find in their own
&gt; toolkits, it is inevitable that some will ask, &quot;what if we apply the
&gt; methods we use to prove that X wrote Shakespeare to authors other than
&gt; Shakespeare?&quot; Since those methods generate false positives for
&gt; Shakespeare, they may also generate false positives for other writers as
&gt; well (&quot;what do you know -- X was not only Shakespeare but also Golding,
&gt; Nashe, Sidney, Lyly, Spenser, Drayton, Greene, etc.&quot;).

&gt; The strange thing about the &quot;X wrote everything&quot; antistratfordians is that
&gt; while their limited integrity leads them to test their methods on other
&gt; authors, it does not compel them to doubt the validity of those methods.
&gt; Sobran hears his &quot;methods&quot; whisper to him that Sidney's *Astrophil &amp;
&gt; Stella*, Spenser's *Amoretti*, Drayton's *Idea*, and *Shakespeare's
&gt; Sonnets* were all written by the same person; if he were less impaired by

&gt; realize that the more different authors his methods show were really
&gt; Oxford, the more he demonstrates the utter worthlessness of those methods
&gt; and his own limitations as a reader.

"/>

I'm not a supporter of the &quot;X wrote everything&quot; or &quot;Super Oxford&quot;
theory, Terry, and I don't think I subscribe, in the main, to Sobran's
methods of determining authorship. I believe that Shakespeare, whoever
he was, had enough to do writing the canon. Maybe he got to edit the
work of others occasionally as a good will gesture.

Best wishes,
Lynne

&gt;&gt; see the editor's original article so I could judge for myself. Her
&gt;&gt; dismissal of the Authorized Version as &quot;old-fashioned&quot; doesn't
&gt;&gt; inspire confidence - perhaps she found Shakespeare's plays similarly
&gt;&gt;&quot;obscure&quot; and &quot;misleading.&quot;

&gt; Considering that she took a First in Modern Languages at Oxford in
&gt; 1915 (degree not awarded until 1920 because she was a woman), I rather

That was sarcasm. And I doubt very much that Sayers found the language
of the Authorized version either obscure or misleading; it simply suited
her purposes to describe it as such.

Yes, I have. But I wasn't talking about 'the proletariat'; I was
talking about Sayers, who presumably included herself among the &quot;us&quot; to
whom the idiom of the Authorized Version is &quot;so old-fashioned that,
even as English, it is often obscure to us or positively misleading.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Moreover, there is a difference between the earliest known texts of
&gt;&gt; the Gospels and the 'original and only authentic documents.' So far
&gt;&gt; as I am aware, there are no extant original and authentic versions of
&gt;&gt; any of the Gospels. If there was a historical Jesus, he cannot be
&gt;&gt; seen clearly through the Greek Gospels, in which there are only a few
&gt;&gt; fragments of the Aramaic he would have spoken; in arguing that we can
&gt;&gt; better understand Jesus through the Greek he didn't use rather than
&gt;&gt; the English he didn't use, Sayers hardly seems less naive than the
&gt;&gt; newspaper editor she quotes.

&gt; _One_ of the Gospels (Matthew) is _rumored_ to have had an Aramaic
&gt; original. The other three, along with the rest of the NT, were
&gt; written in Greek in the first place.

Strange, that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And presuming that Jesus, Himself, didn't know Greek is rather like
&gt; presuming that a 30ish rabbi in present-day Israel doesn't know
&gt; English.

"/>

That's rather like presuming that first-century Palestine and present-
day Israel have comparable educational systems. Why would Jesus have
needed or wanted to learn Greek? Why would he have spoken it amongst
his fellow Judeans?

It seems to me that arguing for the historical veracity of the Gospels
is a bit like arguing for the historical veracity of Edward de Vere's
authorship of Shakespeare (see, I have managed to drag this back on
topic). To a believer, the claim seems obviously true, and to a
skeptical observer, the claim seems obviously false. Both the Oxfordian
and the Christian allow their faith to trump their ability to analyze
evidence, and both typically assume that anyone who holds an opposite
view is being wilfully blind. It happens that I hold an opposite view
with regard to both Oxford's authorship of Shakespeare and the
historical accuracy of the Gospels; so far as I can see, all the extant
evidence stands squarely against both propositions; but I don't expect
to convince anyone else, alas.

To my recollection, the only three Russian Rutland partisans I have ever
mentioned in this forum are Gililov, Porokhovshchikov, and Lunacharsky,

I have also used the alternative transliteration &quot;Porohovshikov&quot; on
occasion, generally when pasting text from elsewhere or when conversing
with anti-Stratfordian cranks, as this seems to be the spelling that
they prefer. However, that transliteration is an unfortunate one, so I
prefer to avoid it: the Cyrillic letter &quot;x&quot; appearing as the fifth
letter of the name is far more commonly (and from a phonological
viewpoint, arguably more accurately) transliterated as &quot;kh&quot; than as &quot;h&quot;;
indeed, one rarely sees references to the writer &quot;Anton Chehov&quot; or the
statesman &quot;Mihail Gorbachev&quot;; rather, the transliteration conventions
widely used in English mandate &quot;Chekhov&quot; and &quot;Mikhail,&quot; using &quot;kh&quot;

poet Velimir Khlebnikov or the politician Nikita Khruschcev is far less
often spelled &quot;Hlebnikov&quot; or &quot;Hrushchev.&quot;

Indeed, names like &quot;Chehov,&quot;&quot;Hlebnikov,&quot;&quot;Hrusev&quot; (there is an
inverted circumflex over of the &quot;s&quot;) are generally employed only by
zealous would-be orthographic reformers who are troubled no end by the
fact that the common transliteration conventions often employ two or
more Roman letters (in one case, as we shall see below, as many as four
letters) to transliterate a single Cyrillic letter; however regrettable
this state of affairs may be, it is virtually inevitable in view of the
undeniable fact that there are six more letters in the Russian alphabet
than in the alphabet used in English, so one must either employ digraphs
or alter the Roman letters with various accents, circumflexes, and other
adornments. Since there is no phonological equivalent of the letter
Roman letter &quot;h&quot; in Russian, one could plausibly elect to transliterate
Cyrillic &quot;x&quot; as &quot;h&quot; rather than as &quot;kh,&quot; but this is less commonly done,
probably because the pronunciation suggested by &quot;kh&quot; to a speaker of
English is a closer approximation to the Russian velar spirant &quot;x&quot; than
the mere aspiration of the English pronunciation of &quot;h.&quot; However, Mr.
Parisious, who evidently reads English very poorly and Russian not at
all, is evidently blithely unaware of these complexities.

The eighth letter of Porokhovshchikov's name, the Cyrillic letter
&quot;I_I_I_,&quot; often transliterated as &quot;shch,&quot; presents even more of a
problem. It is occasionally rendered as &quot;sh,&quot; but this expedient is
quite regrettable, because there is another Russian letter (which I
attempt to reproduce in ASCII as &quot;I_I_I&quot;) that is far more commonly and
more sensibly transliterated as &quot;sh&quot; -- indeed, it represents the
closest Russian equivalent of the English sibilant sound &quot;sh.&quot; The
letter usually transliterated as &quot;shch&quot; (which I attempted above to
reproduce in ASCII as &quot;I_I_I_,&quot;) is pronounced more like the consonant
cluster emphasized in the phrase &quot;freSH CHeese&quot;; in some regions the
pronunciation omits the &quot;ch&quot; part of the consonant cluster, but it is
still completely different from the sound of the letter commonly
transliterated as &quot;sh&quot; -- indeed, the former is palatalized while the
latter is not. I refer Mr. Parisious to

&lt;&gt; and

&lt;&gt;

for charts summarizing the modified Library of Congress transliteration
system in common use. I have before me a copy of I. M. Gililov's book,
and if Mr. Parisious can find someone to read it to him, he can check
for himself that Porokhovshchikov's name in Russian is spelled (forgive
the ASCII):

½ O P O X O B |_|_|_, I/I K O B

-- exactly as my favored transliteration &quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot; would
suggest. But Mr. Parisious, who evidently reads English exceedingly
poorly and Russian not at all, is evidently blithely unaware of these
complexities.

Finally, the surname of Nikita Krushchev is an excellent test case
for Mr. Parisious's presumed preference in Russian transliteration, as
it contains both the letters &quot;x&quot; and &quot;i_i_i_,&quot;: if one adopted the
transliteration conventions resulting in the spelling &quot;Porohovshikov,&quot;
then Khrushchev's name would apepar as &quot;Hrushev&quot; -- but perhaps Mr.
Parisious prefers it so.

Finally, the name of the third Russian Rutland partisan, Lunacharsky,
is also spelled in a perfectly unexceptionable way. &quot;Lunacharskii&quot;
would be preferable and certainly more consistent, but the
transliteration &quot;Lunacharsky&quot; is so commonly used that one is stuck with
it (much as one is stuck with monstrosities like &quot;Tchaikowsky&quot; rather
than &quot;Chaikovksii,&quot; the latter more in keeping with the modified Library
of Congress transliteration system, but the former and its variants
firmly established because Chaikovskii's name came into prominent use in
English via French and German). But Mr. Parisious, who evidently reads
English very poorly and Russian not at all, is evidently blithely
unaware of these complexities.

In any case, there is NO transliteration system in use on the entire
planet that would render Lunacharsky's name as &quot;Lunachevsky,&quot; Mr.
Parisious's own preferred spelling; see

&lt;&gt;.

However, Mr. Parisious, an irremediably ignorant Lunatikovsky, is
oblivious to such matters, as he plainly knows no Russian.

So far your evidence that this notion was &quot;astonishingly widespread&quot;
consists of a phrase from the writings of a single newspaper editor, the
context of which is unknown. I'd like to see a little more evidence. I
don't doubt that people have believed, and continue to believe, things
which are obviously untrue, but I like to see compelling evidence before
I accept specific examples; I was once taught that everyone in Europe
believed the world was flat before Columbus proved otherwise, and having
been disillusioned on that score, I have become wary of similar claims.

&gt;&gt;&gt; unless the material concerned comes under the heading of hate literature
&gt;&gt;&gt; (perhaps that really is an oxymoron).

&gt;&gt; I don't consider Sobran's Shakespeare/Oxford essays &quot;hate
&gt;&gt; literature&quot; -- I don't even think they display a hatred of genuine
&gt;&gt; scholarship.

&gt; Agreed.

&gt;&gt;As for Sobran's other and viler writings, I would not want
&gt;&gt; him to be prohibited from putting them online.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Shakespearean articles on Sobran's site link to others which are not
&gt;&gt;&gt; so salubrious.

&gt;&gt; The man's own essays indict him more powerfully than I could.

&gt; I agree here too. But you are an intelligent person and you read his
&gt; writing critically. Many others may not. His quite unreasonable hatred

&gt; Is there something that the government should protect us from? Would you
&gt; link to a writer who had an interest in Shakespeare if he'd written a
&gt; book such as Mein Kampf, and material from the book appeared somewhere
&gt; else on his website? Does your tolerance for free speech have a limit?

"/>

I have read Mein Kampf; I own a copy of the book. I would not be happy if
the government told me I mustn't keep it or quote it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; I also think it behooves us as an Oxfordian organization not to get
&gt;&gt;&gt; tarred with Sobran's nasty, sticky, and broad-stroked brush.

&gt;&gt; Sobran considers his unorthodox views on various historical and political
&gt;&gt; questions to be interrelated. Just as he departs from the orthodox views
&gt;&gt; about World War II and AIDS, so he also is an Oxfordian. For him, his
&gt;&gt; various dissents are signs of his own brave openness to views that
&gt;&gt; scholarly and political establishments not merely reject but, he thinks,
&gt;&gt; suppress.

&gt;&gt; There are some antistratfordians whose views on the authorship of
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare's works are linked to their beliefs in the actuality of
&gt;&gt; Atlantis, or visits to earth by intelligent extraterrestrial creatures, or
&gt;&gt; extrasensory perception, or any number of other notions that might be
&gt;&gt; classed as &quot;pseudo-science&quot; by such writers as Martin Gardner or James
&gt;&gt; Randi.

&gt; Right. I'd rather not be associated with those beliefs...although
&gt; maybe Atlantis did exist...

"/>

I certainly would not say such a thing is true of all, or even of most,
antistratfordians, but there is some tendency for the holders of one
fringe belief to hold others as well, and to see a connection between the
various fringes. Similarly, if you go to a demonstration against some
particular action of the government, you are likely to find others at the
demonstration who have a very large set of governmental actions they
oppose. What you have in common with them is merely your opposition to
policy &quot;P&quot;; some of them may ask where you were last week when they
demonstrated against policy &quot;O&quot; and whether you will show up next week
when they demonstrate against policy &quot;Q&quot;. If you don't oppose &quot;O&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;
with the same fervor you bring to your opposition of &quot;P,&quot; then you are not
fully engaged in the struggle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;Of course, it is also possible to be an antistratfordian whose
&gt;&gt; unorthodox views on this one issue are not part of a general opposition to
&gt;&gt; the views of a large number of scholarly communities, just as it is
&gt;&gt; possible to believe that Shakespeare wrote the works generally attributed
&gt;&gt; to him AND to believe in flying saucers.

&gt; You mean there's no such thing as flying saucers? O damn. :)

"/>

I could answer that question, but the tiny voice in my tooth would say bad
things to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; (I've added the emoticon so Spam Scone doesn't call me a weird sister
&gt; again. But maybe he will anyway.) I think one must take into account
&gt; that in general the consensus among Stratfordians (forgive the
&gt; term--traditionalists?) seems to be that only Anti-Strats have strange
&gt; notions, are nutters, wacks, etc.

"/>

If that is the consensus, it is a silly one. If you ask all the nutters
and wacks in this country &quot;who wrote *Hamlet*?&quot; you'll find that most of
them will say &quot;Shakespeare.&quot; That doesn't mean their replying
&quot;Shakespeare&quot; marks them as nutters or wacks.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Therefore it is wise to separate oneself or one's organization from such
&gt; views. To my mind it becomes imperative when the notions are not
&gt; harmless, when, in fact, they are both hate-mongering and hateful.

"/>

Tactically, it is very tempting for those who share a minority view to
ignore what divides them and to press for a solidarity based on the one
thing that unites them. I think it is admirable that the SF will not
ignore the vileness of some of Sobran's views even though he agrees with
the SF on Oxford's authorship of Shakespeare's works.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt;&gt; But here's a howdy do, as the folk in The Mikado would say: An Oxfordian
&gt;&gt;&gt; arguing against inclusion of Sobran links, and a Stratfordian arguing
&gt;&gt;&gt; for them. :)

&gt;&gt; You are free to link or not to link to Sobrans's or anybody else's pages
&gt;&gt; as you see fit; I am not arguing that you should not be free to decide as
&gt;&gt; you like.

&gt; Thank you. I didn't think you were.

&gt;&gt; I do not call myself a &quot;Stratfordian&quot;; I do not have different procedures
&gt;&gt; for evaluating the evidence for Shakespeare's authorship of his works than
&gt;&gt; I would use for other authors, but I know of no antistratfordian &quot;case&quot;
&gt;&gt; that is not based on the use of special interpretive rules and special
&gt;&gt; pleading.

&gt; No, the rules are different from the ones you use, that's all.

"/>

I am pretty familiar with the SF site; I see almost everywhere the
operation of Oxford-specific or Shakespeare-specific rules that could not
be generally applied for Gascoigne and Sidney and Spenser and Daniel. I
also see a carelessness, a disregard for what does not support the BIG
IDEA, a slavish devotion to such unreliable sources as Looney and the
Ogburns merely because they are on the SF's side of the BIG IDEA.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My rules--I can't speak for the views of others--are contingent to some
&gt; extent on the idea that autobiographical detail is always, in some way,
&gt; displayed in one's work. Writers can't help it, I believe.

"/>

That is not implausible, but it is also not very helpful. If we knew
everything there ever was to know about Aristotle, including what even he
did not know about himself, we might think we would then be able to point
to every line of the *Prior Analytics* and argue for its inescapably
autobiographical character, but the project would be an exercise in
futility. Every line would have possible sources in a great variety of
data about Aristotle, and a great many of those data would be so similar
to what we might know about someone else of his time that the we would not
be able to assign the work to Aristotle if the attribution had not come
down to us.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We accept that concept very readily with regard to authors such as
&gt; Dickens and Hardy.

"/>

If you wish to accept it about Shakespeare there is no shortage of
biographies to help you; this detail or that from some play or another can
be connected to something Shakespeare might have felt or experienced. If
we knew everything there ever was to know about Shakespeare, including
what even he did not know about himself, we might then think we would be
able to point to every line of *Lucrece* and argue for its inescapably
autobiographical character, but I don't think we could do so persuasively
-- in fact, we cannot do so even for such seemingly autobiographical works
as *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*. Richard Ellman made
mistakes in the first edition of his biography of Joyce because he assumed
that *Portrait* was more accurately autobiographical than it was.

The &quot;Shakespeare's works are X's autobiography&quot; belief is not a method and
cannot be made into a method for showing that X is someone other than
Shakespeare. ALL antistratfordianisms play with this approach because it
is so easy. There are hundreds of characters and thousands of incidents
and emotions portrayed or related in ...

than that. Those who will concede, for example, that the original texts
of the Bible were, indeed, Hebrew (with a little Aramaic) and Greek, but
who nevertheless maintain that the King James Version is what God had in
mind all along, Who carefully arranged the Hebrew and Greek words so
that they would ultimately be translated into what He really wanted in
the first place. See

Unfortunately, my UK copy of &quot;The Man Born to be King&quot;, which, unlike
the US editions, includes additional commentary by Val Gielgud (John's
brother, her producer) and James Welch (Director of Religious
Broadcasting for the BBC), went walkabout. It has more details of the
controversy, which was considerable. (The Lord's Day Observance Society

&gt;&gt;&gt;Lynne joins the Weird Sisters. I guess we can promote Elizabeth to Hecate then.

&gt;&gt; That's not just a sexist remark, it's one that's
&gt;&gt; evocative of the institutionalized burning of women
&gt;&gt; in the Middle Ages.

&gt;&gt; Webb started this thing by making my name into

&gt;&gt; in HLAS made a joke that faintly resonated with the
&gt;&gt; institutionalized gassing of Jews by the Nazis because
&gt;&gt; Webb's political sensibilities are skewed to one thing
&gt;&gt; only.

&gt; So many errors, so little time....

&gt; A) Witch hunts are characteristic of the Renaissance, not the Middle Ages.

&gt; B) In England, at least, witches were not burned, but hanged.

&gt; C) Women are not witches, per se.

&gt; D) All he did was _mention_ witches.

&gt; E) If it is a &quot;sexist remark&quot; to mention that Weird Lizzie is a woman,
&gt; then we must conclude one of two things. Either Weird Lizzie thinks
&gt; that it is disgraceful to be called a woman, or else she thinks that it
&gt; is an insult to women to suggest that they number her among them.

The Weir-bot is just upset that I scored a point. Notice in another

Oh, I don't doubt it; there were similar fulminations over Scorsese's
movie version of _The Last Temptation of Christ_, as I'm sure you know.
However, the fulminations principally concerned the invention of details
not found in the Gospels rather than use of the wrong translation.
Sayers herself alludes to such problems in the passage you quoted:
&quot;Moreover, the words of the books, in or out of their context, are by
great numbers of British Christians held to be sacrosanct in such a
sense that they must not be expanded, interpreted, or *added to, even in
order to set the scene, supply obvious gaps in the narrative*, or
elucidate the sense.&quot; (emphasis added)

I'm afraid Sayers was once again being disingenuous, as the controversy
over whether it is permissible to add to Scripture predates the
establishment of Christianity in Britain.

So am I -- it's a remarkable spectacle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

By the same means -- pure invention. Indeed, that expedient is also
evidently the source of Elizabeth's assurance that

&quot;The term 'shake-scene' was Elizabethan theatre slang for the
factotum who toted scenery around between acts.&quot;

Of course, one can always ask Elizabeth for evidence or sources for the
colorful factoids she invents so profusely, and many people have done
so, but her response is generally some variant of her now classic
utterance:

&quot;This is the perishable internet and Wayback doesn't have a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Stratford Catholic, Oxford's tomb [sic] will prove to be
&gt;&gt; empty or have an older child's remains in it--Oxford

A dearth of data has never yet prevented Elizabeth from inventing

I'm genuinely puzzled by Elizabeth's syntax here. Does she really
mean that a Catholic could not have annotated the Geneva Bible, as her

disqualify Oxford as author of the Shakespeare canon?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Since the text consists mostly of words like &quot;usury,&quot; how does
Elizabeth arrive at this conclusion? I'm genuinely curious.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Why would the handwriting be Anne Cecil's?

Because Elizabeth WANTS it to be! And what she wants, she can always
arrange easily, by invention (or hallucination) of supporting factoids.

Of COURSE not!

Elizabeth's chronological cluelessness remains staggering -- not to

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Elizabeth seems to believe that my use of the sobriquet &quot;Elizabeth

Here's a quotation from Stephanie Caruana beside which my jocular use of
&quot;Weird&quot; pales in comparison:

&quot;'We're loooooking.' for a complete asshole named Elizabeth Weird,
and she is all too easy to find.--Stephanie Caruana&quot;

Does Elizabeth think that Stephanie is sexist also? Granted, there was
some provocation for Stephanie's intemperate remark, as Elizabeth had
misquoted her -- but Elizabeth misquotes me routinely, sometimes even
attributing her OWN WORDS to me, yet I have never used an epithet
comparable to the one Stephanie bestows upon Elizabeth here. Moreover,
Elizabeth has added an accusation of racism as utterly unfounded as her
idiotic accusation of sexism. (Of course, she has not troubled to

I find ALL forms of racism loathsome, regardless of the identities of

Elizabeth, of course, knows nothing whatever about my &quot;political

to Elizabeth's promotion of her unfounded speculation to the status of
fact (e.g., not long ago she confidently informed all and sundry what my
college major and minor were, and she was wrong on both counts), so it
doesn't surprise me that she has weighed in on my politics with her
customary discernment. The more complete Elizabeth's ignorance of a

Elizabeth has shown herself to be abysmally ignorant of virtually EVERY

Agreed! Indeed, if one took the union of the works variously

Well, I'm not sure. Certainly it's difficult to characterize him as
one of the saner ones if one takes into account some of his other

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Sobran opens his essay with the words &quot;Maybe I'm crazy.&quot; The editor of

&gt; If there is a line separating &quot;saner&quot; Oxfordians from &quot;wack-jobs,&quot; it
&gt; cannot reasonably be drawn in such a way as to put the non-PT and non-SF
&gt; Sobran in the &quot;saner&quot; camp and the SF in the other. Unlike Sobran, the SF
&gt; has also made at least one genuine contribution to the record in
&gt; publishing Paul Altrocchi's essay on the annnotation in which Shakespeare

organization by its most scholarly contributions. Indeed, if I'm not
mistaken, one SF member produced a U. Mass. Ph.D. thesis with whose many
shortcomings you are far more familiar than I, and another SF member (at
least, I think that he is a member) is the author of _Oxford: Son of
Queen Elizabeth I_, a work which, even setting aside its &quot;Prince Tudor&quot;
silliness, is one of the most astonishing displays of incompetence I
have ever seen in any field.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dave and I don't have a club, don't have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; members, don't ask for dues or any kind of financial support.
&gt;&gt;&gt; We ask for dues to support the newsletter which comes out four times a
&gt;&gt;&gt; year, Terry, not to support the site, the articles on which are free
&gt;&gt;&gt; to all. But I agree, you do a very good job with your bardlinks. We
&gt;&gt;&gt; have a difference of opinion, that's all, where Sobran is concerned.
&gt;&gt;&gt; You believe in freedom of speech above all. I believe in freedom of
&gt;&gt;&gt; speech unless the material concerned comes under the heading of hate
&gt;&gt;&gt; literature (perhaps that really is an oxymoron).
&gt;&gt; Lynne, I'm not sure this is a freedom of speech issue at all. Isn't it
&gt;&gt; rather that you are personally uncomfortable with some of your
&gt;&gt; Oxfraudian fellow-travelers, such as Sobran?
&gt;&gt; The Shakespearean
&gt;&gt;&gt; articles on Sobran's site link to others which are not so salubrious.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I live in Canada where we have laws which prohibit such material, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm glad of it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I also think it behooves us as an Oxfordian organization not to get
&gt;&gt;&gt; tarred with Sobran's nasty, sticky, and broad-stroked brush.
&gt;&gt; But what about PWDBard's anti-Catholic postings, Art N.'s Masonic
&gt;&gt; nutterings, Crowley's ill-informed nationalistic garbage, Streitz's
&gt;&gt;&quot;Aids is a hoax&quot; nonsense, and Sam Sloan's adventures with underaged
&gt;&gt; Asian girls  http://www.ishipress.com/daa.htm?  It seems whenever one
&gt;&gt; comes across an Oxfraudian, one comes across a nutcase. Or a Gemstone
&gt;&gt; file.

"/>

One might add to the list Mr. Crowley's &quot;aquatic ape&quot; contributions,
Mr. Streitz's repudiation of the Bernoulli Principle in fluid dynamics,
Ken Kaplan's assurance that John Edward really does talk to dead people,
Lord Burford's antics, and the countless varieties of eccentricity --
some harmless crankery, some far less harmless -- that used to grace
Raeto West's web site.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; But here's a howdy do, as the folk in The Mikado would say: An
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oxfordian arguing against inclusion of Sobran links, and a
&gt;&gt;&gt; Stratfordian arguing for them. :)
&gt;&gt; I don't think Terry is specifically arguing FOR them, but defending
&gt;&gt; himself against a subtle smear by you.
&gt; O dear. I wrote a long reply to this but it disappeared into the
&gt; ether. It might turn up. Who knows? I don't have the energy to rewrite
&gt; but would just like to say the following:

&gt; I am personally uncomfortable with what Sobran writes.

"/>

Agreed!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I don't believe
&gt; anyone who spews hate should be allowed a forum under the guise of
&gt;&quot;freedom of speech,&quot; whatever his or her view on the authorship
&gt; question. Aren't you uncomfortable with some of your fellow
&gt; travellers?

&gt; I don't know Sam Sloan at all. His web page, though, is a disgrace.

"/>

The link Neil posted was just a small part; you really should visit
the main page, which by its sheer volume of eccentric material qualifies
as a worthy successor to Raeto West's page.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I have no knowledge of PWBard's supposed anti-Catholicism either, so
&gt; can't comment. Am not often on HLAS, am just between books at the

&gt; I don't agree with Streitz that AIDS is a hoax,

"/>

Good! How do you stand on his repudiation of the Bernoulli Principle?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and know nothing of
&gt; Crowley's nationalism, but cannot see either as a deliberate and
&gt; vicious smear campaign against minority or other groups.

&gt; Art's posts, which I've read elsewhere, are absolutely harmless, often
&gt; interesting, and to yoke his name with that of Sobran's is to do him a
&gt; grave injustice.

"/>

While I agree emphatically that Art's presence is mostly benign, I
would amend the above to read that Art's posts are MOSTLY harmless. The
one in which he announced, in a forum read worldwide, the death of a
prominent Yale historian because it never occurred to him that two
distinct persons might share the same name was not entirely &quot;harmless&quot;;
Art's subsequent expression of regret that the deceased was someone
other than &quot;the Stratfordian&quot; he assumed had perished was exceedingly
tasteless. In addition, Art's idiotic suggestion that Vladimir Nabokov,
a man who brazenly defied the Nazis' prohibition upon trading in Jewish
establishments in pre-war Berlin when it was perilous to do so, was
antisemitic is beyond tasteless, and far from &quot;harmless.&quot; Nor did Art,
when his ignorance of Nabokov's ignorance was disspelled, ever retract
his cretinous remark.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Terry knows I would never smear him, even subtly, though I thank you
&gt; for understanding I have the capacity to be subtle. I consider him a
&gt; friend, exceptionally well-read, exceptionally knowledgeable about
&gt; Elizabethan history and literature, Stratfordian though he is,
&gt;&quot;Oxfraudian&quot; though you believe me to be.

"/>

While you are certainly not among them, one of the things I find
objectionable about many Oxfordians is their eagerness to assume that
scholars are not merely in error (if error there is), but are actually
engaging in deliberate intellectual dishonesty -- suppressing documents,
altering paintings, disseminating misinformation, etc. Such charges of
dishonesty have been hurled at Dave Kathman and Terry Ross time after
time in this forum, and you can find countless instances of the same
rubbish in the Oxfordian literature (one of the most incompetent
expressions of such paranoia can be found in Mr. Streitz's book, for
example).

Webb really has out done himself.The fatuous little heehaw
exactly confirms what was previously written here. He fails to
identify the author Porohoshikov by the signature by which said author
was known for nearly half his life in the English speaking world and
which was invariably used by the White Russian international community
when writing in English.But as Webb has obviously never gotten as far
as the title page of &quot;Shakespeare Unmasked&quot; he is puzzled by this
fact.

He has only three authors to deal with and he botched two.

The same applies to his knowledge of Lefranc, whom he claims to
have read.As late as 10/15/200l he is referring to him as the author
of &quot;a tome&quot; and on 6/06/99 he knew one Lefranc title. There is nothing
to show he read even that.

I think you and I have been talked about this in the past. The holding
of unusual beliefs, as Terry R and I discussed on another forum, is
not restricted to Oxfordians. The kind of garbage that was on Rae
West's site, however, comes under another category and is another
matter entirely. It's vicious and vile. The Shakespeare Fellowship
does not link to Joe Sobran's site, and asked the De Vere Society in
Britain to remove its links to the West site. The DVS did so. Again,
though, while not wishing to excuse either Sobran or West in any way,
I would say that not all fascists/far right conservatives are
Oxfordians. My guess is that the majority of them believe that
Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the canon if they think about the
subject at all.

I have to agree that when honest beliefs are called lies it is

Stratfraudian.

I have not read Mr. Streitz's book, so the only comment I can make in

Christopher Paul in Shakespeare Matters, the newsletter of the

This is the confession I know is looming in all Oxfordians.
Lynne just let down her front and admitted to all that she has an Agenda.
This is the unfair and dishonest and hoaky aspect of Oxfordianism--that they
are interested in arriving at their prescribed end. They have already decided
that Oxford wrote Shakespeare and now through their meetings and their
papers and their work they WILL arrive some day at their selected conclusion.

It is what separates them from scholars.

Using means to arrive at an end shows a very rotten intent, Lynne.
I don't expect you to realize what you just said. I think you are too

This is a disturbing difference between antis and so-called Strats in regard to
appreciating Shakespeare.

or composed on their website, then it would be reasonable of you to announce that
you are trying to achieve an end.

Maybe if you had already satisfactorily answered the Oxfordian Frequently
Unanswered Questions and showed some acceptable believability for the
&quot;candidacy&quot; of your Oxford, then it would be reasonable of you to announce that
you are trying to achieve an end.

But you are simply ignoring history and foisting a hoax of your own.

I salute you, Lynne, for incriminating yourself, and your fellowship.
You are deliberate and honest.
Most of the people practicing your craft are not so honest and would not admit

You have shown here your desire to achieve an end. This is not

It is by no means restricted to Oxfordians -- but judging by the
Oxfordian habitués of this forum, such eccentric beliefs (I refer you to
Stephanie Caruana's web site, &lt;&gt;, for a sample)
arise with unnerving regularity among Oxfordians, even when one
disregards Sobran, Raeto West, Lord Burford, Enoch Powell, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Agreed. And as I said before, I do not believe that the political
center of mass among Oxfordians is appreciably farther to the right (to
the extent that such a simplistic reduction to a linear continuum makes
any sense in the first place) than that of the general population;
however, while I think that both distributions probably have roughly the
same mean, I would conjecture the standard deviation among the Oxfordian
population is probably greater, hence there are more conspicuous
outliers.

&gt;&gt; one in which he announced, in a forum read worldwide, the death of a

&gt;&gt; Art's subsequent expression of regret that the deceased was someone
&gt;&gt; other than &quot;the Stratfordian&quot; he assumed had perished was exceedingly
&gt;&gt; tasteless. In addition, Art's idiotic suggestion that Vladimir Nabokov,
&gt;&gt; a man who brazenly defied the Nazis' prohibition upon trading in Jewish
&gt;&gt; establishments in pre-war Berlin when it was perilous to do so, was
&gt;&gt; antisemitic is beyond tasteless, and far from &quot;harmless.&quot; Nor did Art,
&gt;&gt; when his ignorance of Nabokov's ignorance was disspelled, ever retract
&gt;&gt; his cretinous remark.

&gt;&gt; Shakespeare had a robust sense of humor, Art; there's no way he would
&gt;&gt; have been prejudiced against you, despite your attempts to deny him
&gt;&gt; authorship of his great works.
&gt; Despite my attempts to credit the author with his great works.
&gt;&gt; Nabokov was once asked about his &quot;preference in celestial neighbors.&quot;
&gt;&gt; Nabokov replied that &quot;It would be fun to hear Shakespeare roar with ribald
&gt;&gt; laughter on being told what Freud (roasting in the other place) made of his
&gt;&gt; plays.&quot;
&gt; Roasting in the other place? Speaking of anti-Semetism?

"/>

Jesting aside, I can't let this utter rubbish pass. Nabokov certainly
ridiculed two Jewish *individuals*, Marx and Freud, relentlessly, but his
contempt for Marx and Freud had *nothing whatever* to do with their
ethnic origin. Indeed, Nabokov, like his father, was an eloquent and
outspoken foe of anti-Semitism, and indeed of racism in various forms;
in particular, he spoke out forcefully against anti-Semitism on many,
many occasions, and even incurred considerable personal risk by openly
defying the Nazis' attempts to intimidate the non-Jewish population into
boycotting Jewish business establishments. Nabokov's wife Vera Slonim
was Jewish, and Nabokov's family history, particularly his father's
courageous defense of Beilis, the innocent victim of a notorious blood
libel case in Moldavia, induced Jewish relief organizations to assist
Nabokov's impoverished family escape Europe and the holocaust -- just in
time. Even after Nabokov emigrated to the U.S., when he was destitute
and desperately in need of a job, he turned on his heel with an oath and
walked out of a promising job interview when the interviewer
complimented him on his lovely Russian and added a casual remark to the
effect that most Russian speakers she had heard recently were &quot;Yids&quot;.
Nabokov's son Dmitrii recalls being proud of his father's tendency to
express outrage forcefully, even if it meant making a scene in public,
in response to discriminatory behavior or even to &quot;Jewish jokes.&quot;
Nabokov was outraged even by &quot;genteel&quot; and scarcely detectable forms of
anti-Semitism -- for instance, some American motels' practice of
advertising their locations as &quot;near area churches&quot; as a discreet signal
that Jewish guests were not especially welcome. For abundant evidence
of Nabokov's implacable opposition to even the vaguest hint of
anti-Semitism, see Brian Boyd's magisterial two-volume Nabokov
biography.

Your delusions (or at any rate, those to which you pretend) are
harmless enough, and your trolling is often quite amusing. However,
your casual suggestion that Nabokov was anti-Semitic is *completely*
beyond the pale, and is as demonstrably outrageous and idiotic as would
be a casual and flippant claim that Albert Schweitzer was a misanthrope,
or that James Herriot enjoyed torturing animals. Your almost complete
ignorance of countless subjects from which your &quot;evidence&quot; is drawn is
of course well-known, and your inferences from ignorance concerning
Shakspeare authorship are thoroughly entertaining, but a charge of
anti-Semitism -- and the accompanying assault on Nabokov's reputation --
is completely unwarranted and indefensible. This is Neuendorfferian
&quot;loose cannon&quot; bahavior at its shoddiest, and it is not in the least
amusing.

Let's not.
I just rechecked Google to see how an extra ll5 references to
&quot;Pierre Porokhovshchikov&quot; got on there since the last time that I
checked.There are still approximately 8. And around twenty more
relating to a DVD auction featuring A.Porokhovshchikov, who starred in
a Russian spaghetti Western of the l970's.
The earliest references to Porokhovshchikov and Shakespeare date
from January 3 and 4,l998. on soc.culture.russian.moderated.The same
article was also published in The Christian Science Monitor. The
author states,&quot;One of the first to moderate it was an emigre professor
named Porokhovshchikov and one of its earliest adherents was Anatoly
Lunacharsky, the first Soviet commisar of culture.&quot; The writer also
refers to the theory that Philip Marlowe wrote Shakespeare(lookout,
Peter and Dave!).
Since the first book on Rutland as Shakespeare was authored in
Germany in l906 by &quot;Peter Alvor&quot;,and Porohoshikov could not have
emigrated prior to the Revolution,this entire pedigree is extremely
suspect.
Porohoshikov's own bibliography(l940) does not list any prior
publications.
If Webb has any evidence of such let him produce to our eternal
gratitude.
Meanwhile he still hasn't got to the title page of the first
Porohoshikov publication.
And has further become entangled in his own Webb by JK's maladroit

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And has further become entangled in his own Webb by JK's maladroit

&gt; RNP

"/>

Mr. Karisious's OWN &quot;manipuilations&quot; are far more amusing than
anything even a gifted humorist like John Kennedy could contrive! I
have explained in painstaking detail and in simple language (for Mr.
Karisious's benefit) why I prefer standardized transliteration
conventions -- thus, for example, I write &quot;Chaikovskii&quot; rather than
&quot;Tchaikowsky&quot; (or any of the name's other myriad variants) and
&quot;Khrushchev&quot; rather that &quot;Hrushev,&quot; regardless of how either man was
known among his White Russian intimates; that these modest complexities
far exceed Mr. Karisious's intellectual capabilities is indeed
unfortunate, but not surprising.

Mr. Karisious obviously has not read Gililov's book or he would be
aware that when Gililov cites Porokhovshchikov's English-language book,
he uses yet a *FOURTH* spelling of the poor man's surname!

It is precisely this Hydra-headed proliferation of competing
transliterations that leads me to employ the standardized
transliteration conventions widely adopted by libraries, if only to
furnish readers of Russian the wherewithal to locate the name in Russian
language references. Generally I deviate from this practice only when
discussing Porokhovshchikov with h.l.a.s. anti-Stratfordians, most of
whom begin frothing at the mouth at my transliteration, and virtually
none of whom know any Russian anyway, and on whom my good intentions
would therefore be wasted in any case.

However, this amusing discussion still has not resolved one point.
Mr. Karisious avers that I misspelled TWO of the three names of the
prominent Rutland partisans whom I mentioned. We have already seen that
he does not accept the standard transliteration convention I generally
adopt -- but what OTHER name does he hallucinate that I have supposedly
misspelled?

Is Mr. Karisious still under the bizarre impression that the Soviet
commissar's name was &quot;Lunachevsky&quot;? See

&lt;&gt;,

where, in addition to his &quot;Lunachevsky&quot; gaffe, Mr. Karisious revives --
without ANY evidence -- the Oxfordian urban legend that Nabokov was an
anti-Stratfordian.

Or is Mr. Karisious fulminating, for some unfathomable reason, about
the perfectly unexceptionable transliteration &quot;Gililov&quot;? In the former
case, he is even more of a Lunatikovsky than I imagined. In the latter
case, I cannot imagine what his gripe is, unless for some reason he
prefers some monstrosity like &quot;Ghililoff&quot; (amazing as it seems, one
occasionally encounters such aberrations, the &quot;gh&quot; owing to the tendency
in English for the vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;i&quot; to soften a preceding &quot;g,&quot; the
&quot;ff&quot; to insure that the reader does not voice the final consonant).

If Mr. Karisious will specify precisely which spellings of the names
Gililov and Lunacharsky he prefers, I will endeavor, within reason, to
use those spellings when conversing in h.l.a.s. with monoglot (or, in
Mr. Karisious's sad case, semiglot) cranks. However, I draw the line at
&quot;Lunachevsky&quot; -- I will NOT misspell Lunacharsky's name that way, no
matter what demented delusions Mr. Karisious may continue to harbor --
it is simply wrong.

censorship than there is in present-day England.

There are sound reasons to defend freedom of speech, but cultural health

nothing in and of itself to promote the health of a culture; indeed, in
a nation like the United States, free speech actually helps retard
culture.

Thank you, Mark. And to put what I said in context, I was primarily
arguing for censorship of Sobran *on the Shakespeare Fellowship site*
and other sites which promote Shakespeare. In a sense his own rag
censored him first, by firing him. And it wasn't for his views on
Oxford.

It's ironic that the Stratfordians have for years on this forum
taunted Oxfordians for not taking a stand against the nastier essays
of Joe Sobran because he was &quot;one of their own.&quot; Then, when an
Oxfordian does take a stand by denouncing him, quite openly, and
suggesting he is not welcome in the organization she belongs to, she
is called a fascist for it.

&gt; Rips bible code which is universally dissed--

I expressed no opinion of Rips's work on equidistant letter sequences
(_pace_ Elizabeth, this work was never as far as I know referred to as
the &quot;Bible Code&quot; by Rips, but by a popularizer named Drosnin, much of
whose book was repudiated by Rips himself); rather, I noted that
Elizabeth's claim that Rips and Penn Leary shared a &quot;defective program&quot;
was completely wrong (as one has by now come to expect of virtually any
Elizabeth Weird &quot;fact&quot;); indeed, as I noted, Rips's work was published
by a journal that enjoys high prestige in the mathematical sciences,
having been refereed and even suggested for publication by one of the
best statisticians in the world. Here are Elizabeth's words:

&quot;...the program that he [Penn Leary] wrote to find cyphers throughout
the plays is the same defective program the so-called 'Bible Code'
uses. Terry Ross wrote a saracastic and mean-spirited article
debunking Leary's program. I thought Ross was unscholarly. Penn
Leary is a nice man.&quot;

Here is my reply:
-----------------------------------------------------
As usual, you haven't the remotest idea what you're talking about
here, although that circumstance has never impeded your unsupported
speculations before. The work popularized in _The Bible Code_ and
elsewhere was undertaken independently by Eliyahu Rips, a gifted
Israeli mathematician and a world-renowned specialist in geometric
group theory, who owes no debt to Leary. Certainly the two didn't
share any &quot;defective program&quot; -- Rips's original work was undertaken
entirely on his own, and the program used in the later article by
Witztum, Rips, and Rosenberg in _Statistical Science_ was written by
Yaakov Rosenberg. Indeed, I'm inclined to doubt that Rips even has any
awareness of Leary. I remember translating a very early Russian
samizdat version of the very first Rips paper on the subject (evidently
produced on a defective Cyrillic typewriter, with much of the Hebrew
text written out in longhand) from Russian to English for a colleague
back around 1985, while the Soviet Union was still in existence, and,
while I didn't bother to check that the versions of the Hebrew and
Samaritan texts of _Genesis_ that he used were accurate, I certainly
found no mathematical mistakes. Most of the idiotic claims appearing
in the popular press are spectacular and wildly irresponsible
distortions of Rips's claims; some have been publicly repudiated by
Rips himself. Later Rips papers on the subject (in some cases with
coauthors) were published in peer-reviewed journals such as _Journal of
the Royal Statistical Society_, _Statistical Science_ (you can read
this one online), etc., in one case with a disclaimer from the editors
that, although the paper had been carefully refereed, no error had been
found. The work of Rips and his collaborators has been criticized by a
great many well-known mathematicians, among them Shlomo Sternberg (in
_Notices of the American Mathematical Society_ and in the scholarly
periodical _Bible Review_), Barry Simon, Dror Bar-Natan and Brendan
McKay, and others; Maya Bar-Hillel and others have offered statistical
explanations for the Rips phenomenon. In any case, to the extent that
Rips's work can be said to have been &quot;debunked,&quot; it has taken some
effort by some excellent mathematicians and statisticians; it is
certainly not on a par with the ridiculous rubbish of Leary, a sample
of which I reproduce from &lt;&gt;:

punctuation and one change in sense (faire in line 8 becomes

examine them:

In case you're not viewing this with a fixed-width font, Leary has

Indeed, Elizabeth knows this because I pointed it out to her myself:
orthodox physicists and mathematicians who have criticized the work
include, as I noted above, very prominent mathematical physicists like
Shlomo Stenberg and Barry Simon.

Moreover, Elizabeth has ALREADY admitted that she had misunderstood
Rips's work (because she had never even read it, quite apart from her
complete ignorance of mathematics and statistics), although she seems to
have forgotten that admission:

&quot;I'm going to admit that I thought that Rips was looking for a code
in the Samarian Torah. Bereshit. Then I realized that he was not
looking for a code but for internal consistency--elegance--in the
Hebrew Torah compared to the Samarian Torah.&quot;

and

&quot;I now understand what Rips was looking for. Let's drop it.&quot;

Akrigg wrote:

&quot;It all adds up to one thing: nothing would be less surprising

Southampton passed through homosexual phases but, until better
evidence is found, only a fool will declare that he did.&quot;

&gt; You can't get anything through Webb's skull--I've posted
&gt; Southampton's cross-dressing portrait repeatedly--that's
&gt; a sweet little dress Southampton is wearing and a very

Elizabeth's claim goes far beyond Southampton's putative
transvestism; here are her exact words:

&quot;Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the
theatres hoping to play female roles. He was given a few parts
and was apparently very convincing as a girl.&quot;

&lt;&gt;.

How does Elizabeth infer, from a portrait of Southampton attired in what
Elizabeth takes to be a dress, that he &quot;used to hang about the theatres
hoping to play female roles,&quot; far less that he &quot;was given a few parts&quot;
in which he was &quot;very convincing as a girl&quot;? Elizabeth has never posted
a shred of evidence. Why? Because she invented the whole thing, of
course! Just as she invented the following, for which she still has
supplied no source:

&quot;The term 'shake-scene' was Elizabethan theatre slang for the
factotum who toted scenery around between acts.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; but Webb keeps raving on about
&gt; my allegedly wrong claim that Southampton was a
&gt; cross-dresser.

"/>

Elizabeth has not supported her claims about Southampton hanging
around the theatres; rather, when I asked about evidence, she cited what
she took to be evidence of his homosexuality! She does NOT EVEN KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE between cross-dressing and homosexuality! Here is her
reply to my request for evidence concerning Southampton's cross-dressing:

&quot;Here are some academic pages that point to the fact that Wriothesley
was gay followed by A.L. Rowe's rapturous appreciation of
Southampton's femininity:....&quot;

See
&lt;&gt;.

When I objected that Akrigg did NOT claim that Southampton was
homosexual, Elizabeth rejoined:

&quot;Why else would a site on queer studies have a book on Southampton
listed in the biography [sic! -- she means &quot;bibliography&quot;!]?

See
&lt;&gt;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Only 400 magazine and journal articles

No, I noted that none of the articles in question says anything
whatever about Southampton hanging around theatres, being given female
roles, being convincing in them, etc. That is entirely Elizabeth's
invention.

In fact, here is a challenge for Elizabeth:

PRODUCE EVEN ONE RELIABLE URL THAT ASSERTS THAT SOUTHAMPTON USED TO HANG
AROUND THEATRES HOPING TO FEMALE ROLES, THAT HE WAS GIVEN A FEW PARTS,
AND THAT HE WAS QUITE CONVINCING AS A GIRL.

Plainly, Elizabeth will not do so because she cannot -- if she could,
she would have done so a year ago.

Elizabeth's propensity for making an utter ass of herself publicly,
time after time, is astonishing -- does she not even realize that anyone
can look up the Google links that I've provided above for themselves and
find out what Elizabeth really said? I note that for all her bombastic
bluster, Elizabeth does not furnish a SINGLE Google link to any of the
things that she incorrectly alleges that I said, whereas above I have
provided links to the posts from which I have quoted verbatim. I think
it's pretty clear who is inventing complete hogwash.

There do seem to be a lot of people who consider editorial discretion to

It looks to me as though most of the Shakespeare-is-Shakespeare people
on hlas take the position that *anything* an anti-Stratfordian does is
wrong; it's an attitude often manifested in American politics, where a
politician will be excoriated for failing to 'renounce' a connection to
some person or group the excoriator finds objectionable (e.g., the
outcry over Cruz Bustamante's connection to MEChA); on those occasions
when the politician does renounce the connection, the excoriator
typically complains because the politician didn't do it soon enough, or
clearly enough, or sincerely enough.

&gt;&gt; a Russian spaghetti Western of the l970's.

RNP
More Webb fulminations omitted.He is still trying to disguise the
fact that he presented an erroneous account of the relationship
between Lunacharsky and &quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot;, which erroneous account of
said relationship and the spelling which Webb utilized in describing
it derive solely from the article.The latter spelling ,saving in this
single,three times reprinted article,is otherwise unknown in any
Western publication.Webb obviously copied both pieces of (at best)
misleading information simultaneously from the article and has at some
very recent date deluded himself into believing that he was covertly
correcting the titlepage of a book which title he was unable to
identify when I cited it a few days back. Oh well,George IV told the
story about having fought at the Battle of Waterloo so often that he
really got to believe that he had done so.
Still since Webb does not remember how &quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot; got into
his life, or maybe even how Elizabeth Weir got into his life,he should
be less authoritarian about what Heminge and Condell claimed to have
remembered three hundred and seventy-five years back.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; RNP(last letter)
&gt;&gt; Since the first book on Rutland as Shakespeare was authored in
&gt;&gt; Germany in l906 by &quot;Peter Alvor&quot;,and Porohovshikov could not have
&gt;&gt; emigrated prior to the Revolution,this entire pedigree is extremely
&gt;&gt; suspect.
&gt;&gt; Porohovshikov's own bibliography(l940) does not list any prior
&gt;&gt; publications.
&gt;&gt; If Webb has any evidence of such let him produce it to [sic] our eternal
&gt;&gt; gratitude.

&gt; Huh? I never made any claims concerning Porokhovshchikov's (or if
&gt; Mr. Karisious prefers, Porohovshikov's) priority, nor even that he had
&gt;&quot;moderated&quot; the theory. I merely noted that I had READ Porokhovshchikov
&gt; and Gililov, something that Mr. Karisious does not appear to have done.

RNP
Well,on checking the Google group list,it turned out old JK was
making Falstaff sound like a piker.He had turned 26 references to
Porokhovchshikov into l41. Seventeen of these were to a completely
different person;three are the misleading reports under discussion;two
are by Webb and the others are me trying to correct both of them and
JK trying to minimize the damage.The documents cited by JK have
completely corroborated my original contention.The reference to Pierre
Porokhovchshikov comes straight from the newspaper account and Webb
did not know what that excellent author had actually published on the
subject.
Hoping to provide Mr. Webb with further possible examples of John
Kennedy's wit, I checked the larger Google list for
Porokhovshchikov,Pierre.They are ,all eight of them, allusions to the
&quot;western&quot; actor whose first initial is &quot;A&quot;,not &quot;P&quot;;
however,since there was a Pierre involved in shooting the flick,the
entry can be obtained under &quot;Pierre&quot; as well as &quot;A&quot;, if Kennedy the
lesser turned 8(rather than 26) entries for the wrong Porokhovshchikov
into l41 entries he possesses even more wit than you previously
suspected.

We've been through this.I was off by two letters on
Lunacharsky,Webb was previously off by three on the same name.As for
Nabokov I stand by my statement from a man who knew him well in the
forties and is cited in Nabokov letters.I doubt if he ever knew of
Nabokov's writings on the subject.Webb suggested a couple of times
back that Nabokov may have putting on Yanovsky for the sake of an
argument.As neither of us was there ,and Webb is basing his
interpretation solely on an anti-Freud squib which Nabokov penned many
years later(perhaps more anti-Freud than pro-Stratfordian),I suggest
Nabokov may have had his doubts upon the subject.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; one in which he announced, in a forum read worldwide, the death of a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; prominent Yale historian because it never occurred to him that two

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Art's subsequent expression of regret that the deceased was someone
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other than &quot;the Stratfordian&quot; he assumed had perished was exceedingly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tasteless. In addition, Art's idiotic suggestion that Vladimir
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nabokov,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a man who brazenly defied the Nazis' prohibition upon trading in Jewish
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; establishments in pre-war Berlin when it was perilous to do so, was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; antisemitic is beyond tasteless, and far from &quot;harmless.&quot; Nor did Art,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; when his ignorance of Nabokov's ignorance was disspelled, ever retract
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; his cretinous remark.
&gt; Lynne: I like Art a lot. I think I'd prefer to see the posts for
&gt; myself
&gt;&gt;&gt; before passing judgement.

&gt;&gt; (article snipped)
&gt; David: But by all means, check out the entire thread yourself.
&gt; Lynne: Thank you, I will. But I imagine we all say things on occasion
&gt; that we later regret. As to whether Art did in this case, I cannot
&gt; say.

"/>

The depth of Art's regret is perhaps best gauged by Art's own words
in his own followups. After having called Nabokov anti-Semitic and
having been criticized for doing so, Art rejoined:

&quot;Oops! Spelling mistake :-) I meant to write anti-Sematic.

Sematic, a. Significant; ominous; serving as a warning of danger; --
applied esp. to the warning colors or forms of certain animals.&quot;

Although the triumphant (if inane) display of lexicographic prowess is
typical of Art's posts, note that he does *not* retract his contemptible
and utterly groundless accusation; rather, he posts just about the
feeblest excuse one could possibly imagine, even for a haplessly
irresponsible loose cannon like Art.

As for Art's reckless announcement of the death of a prominent
historian, the depth of his regret for that cretinous contretemps is
again perhaps best gauged by Art's own response: when asked whether he
still believed the historian Peter Gay to have been the victim, Art
replied, &quot;Sadly, no.&quot; To admirers and friends of the historian Peter
Gay, such a callous remark, made by someone who had just announced with
wanton recklessness in a forum read worldwide the death of their friend
(because he could not fathom the fact that two distinct persons can
share the same name), merely added insult to injury. Art *never*
apologized for his slapdash irrespnsibility, but continued to refer to
the supposed deceased as &quot;the Freud basher.&quot; (Indeed, Art actually
attempted to *defend* his howler by &quot;arguing&quot; that, since Peter Gay was
supported by a Mellon Foundation grant and since there was a Mellon bank
in Manhattan, it was reasonable to assume that Peter Gay was flying to
New York to collect his monthly Mellon grant check -- IN PERSON at the
Mellon Bank(!) -- when the tragedy occured!)

In response to the outrage expressed in my post at the time, I
received considerable e-mail, the gist of which was that it was utterly
beyond the pale to announce something like that without having checked
it, then to add contemptible comments like Art's &quot;Sadly, no&quot; above.
More than one person expressed some variant of the opinion that, while
he or she had formerly thought Art to be merely a benign and harmless
kook, Art was going into his or her filter file permanently after this
incident.

So, I repeat: although I like Art and often enjoy his humor, he is
MOSTLY harmless, not &quot;absolutely harmless,&quot; as you characterized him
above.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But let's not let facts get in the way of an ignorant rant.
&gt;&gt;&gt; RNP
&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's not.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I just rechecked Google Groups to see how an extra ll5 references &gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Pierre Porokhovshchikov&quot; got on there since the last time that I
&gt;&gt;&gt; checked.There are still approximately 8. And around twenty more
&gt;&gt;&gt; relating to a DVD auction featuring A.Porokhovshchikov, who starred in
&gt;&gt;&gt; a Russian spaghetti Western of the l970's.

&gt;&gt; The earliest references to Porokhovshchikov and Shakespeare date

&gt;&gt;&quot;One of the first to PROPOSE it was an émigré professor named
&gt;&gt; Porokhovshchikov, and one of its early adherents was Anatoly

&gt;&gt;&gt; RNP continuing to quote l997 article

&gt;&gt;&gt; was an emigre professor
&gt;&gt;&gt; named Porokhovshchikov and one of its earliest adherents was Anatoly
&gt;&gt;&gt; Lunacharsky,

&gt;&gt;&gt; the first Soviet commisar of culture.&quot; The writer also
&gt;&gt;&gt; refers to the theory that Philip Marlowe wrote Shakespeare(lookout,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Peter and Dave!).
&gt;&gt; I have already commented upon the article in question in this forum;

&gt; RNP
&gt; More Webb fulminations omitted.He is still trying to disguise the
&gt; fact that he presented an erroneous account of the relationship
&gt; between Lunacharsky and &quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot;, which erroneous account of
&gt; said relationship

I said nothing about any &quot;relationship&quot; among the two men; I merely
noted, correctly, that both were early champions of substantially the
same version of the Rutland theory.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and the spelling which Webb utilized in describing
&gt; it derive [sic] solely from the article.

"/>

No, as I have said consistently, I prefer, when transliterating
Russian names, to adhere to more or less standard transliteration
conventions, regardless of how the names are commonly written in
English, if only for the benefit of speakers of Russian. I have, in
fact, deviated from that practice frequenly in THIS forum, at least in
discussions with h.l.a.s. anti-Stratfordians, few if any of whom know
any Russian anyway, and many of whom begin foaming at the mouth at any
unfamiliar-looking spelling like &quot;Chaikovskii.&quot; That Mr. Parisious
knows no Russian (and is evidently incapable of comprehending the
transliteration conventions) is unfortunate, and apparently irremediable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The latter spelling ,saving in this
&gt; single,three times reprinted article,is otherwise unknown in any
&gt; Western publication.

"/>

It is, as I said, the standard transliteration of the original
Russian name.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Webb obviously copied both pieces of (at best)
&gt; misleading information simultaneously from the article and has at some
&gt; very recent date deluded himself into believing that he was covertly
&gt; correcting the titlepage of a book which title he was unable to
&gt; identify when I cited it a few days back. [...]
&gt; Still since Webb does not remember how &quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot; got into
&gt; his life,

"/>

Gililov, writing in Russian, uses the Russian spelling of the name
that would be transliterated &quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot; accoring to standard
modified Library of Congress transliteration conventions. To be
precise, Gililov uses the spelling that I represented in ASCII as

½ O P O X O B I_I_I_, I/I K O B.

If he can find someone to read it to him, Mr. Paraleresis can check this
himself, on p. 469 in Gililov, who incidentally is NOT referring to an
actor in &quot;Russian spaghetti Westerns.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; or maybe even how Elizabeth Weir got into his life, he should
&gt; be less authoritarian about what Heminge and Condell claimed to have
&gt; remembered three hundred and seventy-five years back.

&gt; the list: &quot;Porohovchikov.&quot; As I have carefully and repeatedly explained
&gt; to Mr. Karisious, apparently without a trace of comprehension on his
&gt; part, the Russian letter &quot;I_I_I_,&quot; is commonly pronounced &quot;shch&quot; as in
&gt;&quot;freSH CHeese&quot;; when Porokhovshchikov Anglicized his name, he chose a
&gt; form at variance with what are now accepted transliteration conventions.
&gt; This choice has evidently confused even the bilingual Gililov. Indeed,
&gt; there are three Russian letters in question here: &quot;|_|_|&quot; (pronounced
&gt;&quot;sh&quot;), &quot;|_|_|_,&quot; (pronounced &quot;shch&quot;), and &quot;`-|&quot; (pronounced &quot;ch&quot;); thus
&gt; the sound of the letter &quot;|_|_|_,&quot; is roughly (disregarding
&gt; palatalization) is roughly that of the digraph &quot;|_|_| `-|&quot;. Gililov
&gt; apparently recalls -- correctly -- that Prokhovshchikov transliterates
&gt; the letter &quot;|_|_|_,&quot; as though it were one of the two letters of the
&gt; digraph &quot;|_|_| `-|&quot; -- he merely gets the wrong one. As I already said,
&gt; this Hydra-headed proliferation of spelling variants induces me to
&gt; prefer the original Cyrillic spelling of the name, transliterated
&gt; according to standard transliteration conventions.

&gt; Mr. Karisious's incompetence here reminds one of an earlier post of
&gt; his, in which he apparently complained about Dave Kathman's spelling of
&gt; his name, &quot;Parisious&quot; -- yet Dave spelled it exactly as Mr. Karisious
&gt; himself always has in this forum:

&gt;&lt;http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl1772900911d&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-
&gt; 8&amp;selm=060620021539572402%25David.L.Webb%40Dartmouth.edu&amp;rnum=53&gt;.

&gt; Indeed, these two instances lead me to fear that perhaps Mr. Parisious
&gt; actually suffers from dyslexia. If so, I sincerely apologize for
&gt; needling him about lapses that he evidently cannot control due to what
&gt; must be a vexing disability.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And has further become entangled in his own Webb by JK's maladroit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manipuilations [sic].
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RNP

&gt;&gt;&gt; DW
&gt;&gt;&gt; Mr. Karisious's OWN &quot;manipuilations&quot; are far more amusing than
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything even a gifted humorist like John Kennedy could contrive!

&gt;&gt; RNP
&gt;&gt; Well,on checking the Google group list,it turned out old JK was
&gt;&gt; making Falstaff sound like a piker.He had turned 26 references to
&gt;&gt; Porokhovchshikov [sic] into l41.

&gt; No -- astonishingly enough, Mr. Parisious has actually misspelled the
&gt; name YET *AGAIN*(!) -- which probably explains why he found so few hits.
&gt; The standard transliteration would be &quot;Porokhovshchikov,&quot; not
&gt;&quot;Porokhovchshikov&quot; -- Mr. Parisious has transposed the clusters &quot;sh&quot; and
&gt;&quot;ch&quot;. In fact, a Google search for &quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot; returns 219 hits.
&gt; (I'm not sure why John found only 141.)

&gt; Again, if Mr. Parisious suffers from dyslexia or from some genuine
&gt; cognitive impairment, I certainly do not wish to make light of his
&gt; disability, and I apologize if I have inadvertanly done so. However, in
&gt; that case Mr. Parisious would do well not to ridicule his interlocutors
&gt; for supposed misspellings, as Mr. Parisious has done.

&gt;&gt; Seventeen of these were to a completely
&gt;&gt; different person;three are the misleading reports under discussion;two
&gt;&gt; are by Webb and the others are me trying to correct both of them and
&gt;&gt; JK trying to minimize the damage.The documents cited by JK have
&gt;&gt; completely corroborated my original contention.The reference to Pierre
&gt;&gt; Porokhovchshikov comes straight from the newspaper account and Webb
&gt;&gt; did not know what that excellent author had actually published on the
&gt;&gt; subject.

&gt; As I have patiently explained to Mr. Karisious several tims now, I
&gt; read the demented nonsense of &quot;that excellent author&quot; many years ago; my
&gt; preference for the transliteration &quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot; arises from a
&gt; desire to transliterate the original Russian as accurately as possible
&gt; according to widely adopted conventions. That Mr. Karisious is
&gt; evidently incapable of understanding this simple preference can scarcely
&gt; be explained even by his hypothetical dyslexia. I don't seriously doubt
&gt; that Mr. Paraleresis has read Porokhovshchikov, despite his bizarre
&gt; misspellings of the name, and I marvel that he does not afford me the
&gt; same basic presumption of honesty. Indeed, I have never doubted Mr.
&gt; Parisious's honesty in any discussion, merely his reading comprehension
&gt; and other requisites for minimal scholarly competence.

&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Mr. Karisious still under the bizarre impression that the Soviet
&gt;&gt;&gt; commissar's name was &quot;Lunachevsky&quot;? See

&gt; which contain two occurrences of the letter &quot;V.&quot;

&gt;&gt; RNP
&gt;&gt; Got you Webb.Porohovshikov IS the author's spelling.

&gt; But &quot;Porohovshikov&quot; is *NOT* the spelling used by Mr. Paraleresis in
&gt; the post to which I was responding! Again, here are Mr. Paraleresis's
&gt; exact words, from Google, at

&gt;&lt;http://groups.google.com/groups?q=manipuilations+group:humanities.lit.au
&gt; thors.*+author:parisious&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=a3cc4070.0309241258.59d0
&gt; b11d%40posting.google.com&amp;rnum=1&gt;:

&gt;&quot;Since the first book on Rutland as Shakespeare was authored in
&gt; Germany in l906 by &quot;Peter Alvor&quot;,and Porohoshikov could not have
&gt; emigrated prior to the Revolution,this entire pedigree is extremely
&gt; suspect.

&gt; Porohoshikov's own bibliography(l940) does not list any prior
&gt; publications.

&gt; If Webb has any evidence of such let him produce to our eternal
&gt; gratitude.

&gt; Meanwhile he still hasn't got to the title page of the first
&gt; Porohoshikov publication.&quot;

&gt; Note that Mr. Paraleresis, in this short selection, has spelled the name
&gt; as &quot;Porohoshikov&quot; THREE TIMES, thereby omitting the first &quot;V&quot; in the
&gt; spelling &quot;PorohoVshikov&quot; [emphasis added] that he assures us above is
&gt; the author's spelling! Mr. Paraleresis's words again, from above:

&gt;&quot;Got you Webb.Porohovshikov IS the author's spelling.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; deliberatelly wanted to see if you could recognize it if I scrambled
&gt;&gt; them yet again.

&gt; And indeed I duly noted that Mr. Paraleresis's &quot;Porokhoshikov&quot; is
&gt; missing the first &quot;V&quot; in the spelling &quot;PorokhoVshikov&quot; [emphasis added]
&gt; that Mr. Paraleresis claims is correct. How does Mr. Paraleresis
&gt; hallucinate that he &quot;got&quot; me? By wishing into existence the &quot;V&quot;s that
&gt; he omitted?

&gt;&gt; You still can't recognize the Westernized form which I
&gt;&gt; am sure you now sincerely believe that you corrected back to whatever.

&gt; No, the Google record is quite plain on the matter: Mr. Paraleresis,
&gt; while objecting that I supposedly failed to recognize the what Mr.
&gt; Paraleresis insists is the &quot;correct&quot; spelling &quot;Porokhovshikov,&quot;
&gt; complains that I corrected his thrice-repeated &quot;Porokhoshikov.&quot;

&gt; One might add that there is not a SINGLE Google hit on the name
&gt;&quot;Porohoshikov,&quot; the spelling that Mr. Karisious used three times in his
&gt; earlier post, although there are certainly references to
&gt;&quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot; and of course to &quot;Porohovshikov.&quot;

&gt; One might add further that in Gililov's book (p. 462) when he refers
&gt; to Porokhovshchikov's book in English, he adds yet a FOURTH spelling to
&gt; the list: &quot;Porohovchikov.&quot; As I have carefully and repeatedly explained
&gt; to Mr. Karisious, apparently without a trace of comprehension on his
&gt; part, the Russian letter &quot;I_I_I_,&quot; is commonly pronounced &quot;shch&quot; as in
&gt;&quot;freSH CHeese&quot;; when Porokhovshchikov Anglicized his name, he chose a
&gt; form at variance with what are now accepted transliteration conventions.
&gt; This choice has evidently confused even the bilingual Gililov. Indeed,
&gt; there are three Russian letters in question here: &quot;|_|_|&quot; (pronounced
&gt;&quot;sh&quot;), &quot;|_|_|_,&quot; (pronounced &quot;shch&quot;), and &quot;`-|&quot; (pronounced &quot;ch&quot;); thus
&gt; the sound of the letter &quot;|_|_|_,&quot; is roughly (disregarding
&gt; palatalization) is roughly that of the digraph &quot;|_|_| `-|&quot;. Gililov
&gt; apparently recalls -- correctly -- that Prokhovshchikov transliterates
&gt; the letter &quot;|_|_|_,&quot; as though it were one of the two letters of the
&gt; digraph &quot;|_|_| `-|&quot; -- he merely gets the wrong one. As I already said,
&gt; this Hydra-headed proliferation of spelling variants induces me to
&gt; prefer the original Cyrillic spelling of the name, transliterated
&gt; according to standard transliteration conventions.

&gt; Mr. Karisious's incompetence here reminds one of an earlier post of
&gt; his, in which he apparently complained about Dave Kathman's spelling of
&gt; his name, &quot;Parisious&quot; -- yet Dave spelled it exactly as Mr. Karisious
&gt; himself always has in this forum:

&gt;&lt;http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl1772900911d&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-
&gt; 8&amp;selm=060620021539572402%25David.L.Webb%40Dartmouth.edu&amp;rnum=53&gt;.

&gt; Indeed, these two instances lead me to fear that perhaps Mr. Parisious
&gt; actually suffers from dyslexia. If so, I sincerely apologize for
&gt; needling him about lapses that he evidently cannot control due to what
&gt; must be a vexing disability.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; And has further become entangled in his own Webb by JK's maladroit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manipuilations [sic].
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; RNP

&gt;&gt;&gt; DW
&gt;&gt;&gt; Mr. Karisious's OWN &quot;manipuilations&quot; are far more amusing than
&gt;&gt;&gt; anything even a gifted humorist like John Kennedy could contrive!

&gt;&gt; RNP
&gt;&gt; Well,on checking the Google group list,it turned out old JK was
&gt;&gt; making Falstaff sound like a piker.He had turned 26 references to
&gt;&gt; Porokhovchshikov [sic] into l41.

&gt; No -- astonishingly enough, Mr. Parisious has actually misspelled the
&gt; name YET *AGAIN*(!) -- which probably explains why he found so few hits.
&gt; The standard transliteration would be &quot;Porokhovshchikov,&quot; not
&gt;&quot;Porokhovchshikov&quot; -- Mr. Parisious has transposed the clusters &quot;sh&quot; and
&gt;&quot;ch&quot;. In fact, a Google search for &quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot; returns 219 hits.
&gt; (I'm not sure why John found only 141.)

&gt; Again, if Mr. Parisious suffers from dyslexia or from some genuine
&gt; cognitive impairment, I certainly do not wish to make light of his
&gt; disability, and I apologize if I have inadvertanly done so. However, in
&gt; that case Mr. Parisious would do well not to ridicule his interlocutors
&gt; for supposed misspellings, as Mr. Parisious has done.

&gt;&gt; Seventeen of these were to a completely
&gt;&gt; different person;three are the misleading reports under discussion;two
&gt;&gt; are by Webb and the others are me trying to correct both of them and
&gt;&gt; JK trying to minimize the damage.The documents cited by JK have
&gt;&gt; completely corroborated my original contention.The reference to Pierre
&gt;&gt; Porokhovchshikov comes straight from the newspaper account and Webb
&gt;&gt; did not know what that excellent author had actually published on the
&gt;&gt; subject.

&gt; As I have patiently explained to Mr. Karisious several tims now, I
&gt; read the demented nonsense of &quot;that excellent author&quot; many years ago; my
&gt; preference for the transliteration &quot;Porokhovshchikov&quot; arises from a
&gt; desire to transliterate the original Russian as accurately as possible
&gt; according to widely adopted conventions. That Mr. Karisious is
&gt; evidently incapable of understanding this simple preference can scarcely
&gt; be explained even by his hypothetical dyslexia. I don't seriously doubt
&gt; that Mr. Paraleresis has read Porokhovshchikov, despite his bizarre
&gt; misspellings of the name, and I marvel that he does not afford me the
&gt; same basic presumption of honesty. Indeed, I have never doubted Mr.
&gt; Parisious's honesty in any discussion, merely his reading comprehension
&gt; and other requisites for minimal scholarly competence.

&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is Mr. Karisious still under the bizarre impression that the Soviet
&gt;&gt;&gt; commissar's name was &quot;Lunachevsky&quot;? See

If Elizabeth Weir is indeed dyslexic, then I apologize for needling
her for her many errors of spelling (although it seems unlikely that
dyslexia could account for the copious errors in usage as well); I
certainly have no intention of making light of what must be a very
vexing disability.

However, Elizabeth seems to have changed her explanation radically:
earlier, she explained these lapses as follows:

&quot;I am making typos because I'm using a $4 keyboard. The keys
stick. I can't get into some of my password sites because I
can't type the numbers. I spilled a coke into my $48 keyboard
and I haven't replaced it because I want to get it for $20 when
I buy a new main board. It's just a thing. I know it's
irrational.&quot;

Actually you don't, Webb.Until recently you spelled
Porohovshikov in such a manner as to render it possible for readers to
consult standard library catalogues,educational
bibliographies,etc.,and judge for themselves how much or how little or
how little you know about the author in question. Unfortunately
instead of noting that this Porokhovshchikov business was only
introduced once in the last hundred years into the English language
and that as the useage of a reporter who likewise believes that
Philip Marlowe is an Elizabethan dramatist,you have chosen to obscure
the fact with thousands of words about your much belated spelling
affectation.

and you did fail to identify the title &quot;Shakespeare Unmasked&quot; as
being the work of Porovhoshikov when the question was put to you.This
raised the obvious
question as whether you had read the book or ,at best, had any
recollection of having read the book.If the readership wants to check
back on your previous comments on a writer whose intellectual
qualifications in general,and reading in Elizabethan literature more

Two Rutland partisans, Porokhovshchikov and Il'ya Gililov, are

David has compounded his original misrepresentation with another
stating that both men were early advocates. This is theoretically
possible and ,if Webb has any evidence to this effect,let him produce
it. As he has not done so,the Rutland bibliography,as now known,stands
as follows:Alvor(l906,2d ed.
l907)Bleibtrau(l907,l909,l923),Demblon(l912 and
l914),Bostlemann(American c.l913 and useless),F.G.Muskat who first
propounded that Rutland collaborated with his Countess(in a German
periodical l924 cited by Alvor,&quot;Der Shakespearefrage&quot; l930),Landau-a
psychoanalytical study c.l937,a German publication,&quot;New Evidence
