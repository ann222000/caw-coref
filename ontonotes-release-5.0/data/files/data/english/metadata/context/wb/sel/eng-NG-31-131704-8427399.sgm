&gt; For all of the victims of tillman's constant stalking and harrassment:

&gt; As you may or may not know, tillman has been banned by Google Groups
&gt; three times (so far) for various reasons (death-threats, stalking,
&gt; posting pornographic, scatological, and obscene materials where minors
&gt; might be present, threatening members of RMO, harrassment, threatening
&gt; the relatives of members of RMO, posting rape fantasies involving
&gt; children, etc.). These activities are well documented by Google and
&gt; are considered illegal, EVERYWHERE.

&gt; What you may not know is that by re-registering with a new ID in order
&gt; to resume his crimes, he is demonstrating an increasing level of
&gt; Malicious Intent, which will soon seal his fate. For most people,
&gt; being banned would be a wake-up call and the predator, feeling
&gt; embarrassment, would cease and desist. His defense would be that he
&gt; got carried away in the heat of the moment and he would promise to
&gt; never do it again. That defense is now lost to tillman; he has chosen
&gt; to ignore the warnings.

&gt; Many would consider his spending hours (or, if one of his victims has
&gt; posted, entire days), monitoring and compusively spamming RMO, a
&gt; fitting self-imposed punishment. There are more severe punishments
&gt; available.

&gt; If you have been stalked and harassed or personally threatened in any
&gt; way by this guy, you can solve the problem permanently by visiting
&gt; your local police station. You will have to fill out a short form and
&gt; be interviewed, but your visit should last much less than an hour. You
&gt; will need to take a copy of his banned IDs ( tapefana ... @webtv.net  ,
&gt; leonard_till ... @yahoo.com , and lnrd_tl ... @yahoo.com ). While Google
&gt; and MSN will not enforce the law themselves, they will fully cooperate
&gt; with both your and his local law enforcement agencies.

&gt; tillman will then receive either a summons or a visit from the police.
&gt; In the end, there WILL be fines,  he WILL be prohibited from internet
&gt; use, he WILL receive probation, and he may lose his freedom.

&gt; Hope this helps.

&gt; p.s. tillman, I do not want to communicate with you in any way. Please
&gt; leave me and my family alone.

RMO is the disgrace of the internet (it's no joke) because a few
people start thread after thread of nonsense and filth, then roll on
the floor about how &quot;clever&quot; they are.

Several thousand of those few - share one carcass; that of Pujol 'ljo'
Bollmann.

When it rolls on the floor, any floor, an instant mopping is required.
At the immediatest.
