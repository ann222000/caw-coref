During a service at an old synagogue in Eastern Europe, when the Shema
prayer was said, half the congregants stood up and half remained sitting.
The half that was seated started yelling at those standing to sit down, and
the ones standing yelled at the ones sitting to stand up.

The rabbi, learned as he was in the Law and commentaries, didn't know what
to do. His congregation suggested that he consult a housebound 98 year old
man who was one of the original founders of their temple. The rabbi hoped
The elderly man would be able to tell him what the actual temple tradition
was, so he went to the nursing home with a representative of each faction of
the congregation.

The one whose followers stood during Shema said to the old man, "Is the
tradition to stand during this prayer?"

The old man answered, "No, that is not the tradition."

The one whose followers sat said, "Then the tradition is to sit during
Shema!"

The old man answered, "No, that is not the tradition."

Then the rabbi said to the old man, "But the congregants fight all the time,
yelling at each other about whether they should sit or stand."

The old man interrupted, exclaiming, "THAT is the tradition!"

Evening Prayers When young David was asked by his father to say the evening
prayer, he realized he didn't have his head covered...so he asked his little
brother Henry to rest a hand on his head until prayers were over. Henry grew
impatient after a few minutes and removed his hand. The father said, "This
is important...put your hand back on his head!" to which Henry exclaimed,
"What, am I my brother's kipah?"

Two Texans are sitting on a plane from Dallas and an old Jewish Texan is
stting between them.

The first Texan says, "My name is Roger. I own 250,000 acres. I have

1,000 head of cattle and they call my place The Jolly Roger."

The second Texan says, "My name is John. I own 350,000 acres. I have

5,000 head of cattle and they call my place Big John's."

They both look down at the Jewish man who says, "My name is Irving and I own
only 300 acres."

Roger looks down at him and say, "300 Acres? What do you raise?"

"Nothing" Irving says.

"Well then, what do you call it?" Asked John.

"Downtown Dallas."

Morris returns from a long business trip and finds out that his wife has
been unfaithful during his time away.

Who was it!!!???" he yells. "That alta kakker Goldstein?"

"No," replied his wife. "It wasn't Goldstein."

"Was it Feldman, that dirty old man?" "No, not him."

"Aha! Then it must have been that idiot Rabinovich!"

"No, it wasn't Rabinovich either..."

Morris was now fuming "What's the matter?" he cried. "None of my friends are
good enough for you?"

A Doctor was addressing a large audience in Tampa.

"The material we put into our stomachs is enough to have killed most of us
sitting here, years ago. Red meat is awful. Soft drinks corrode your stomach
lining. Chinese food is loaded with MSG. High fat diets can be disastrous,
and none of us realizes the long-term harm caused by the germs in our
drinking water."

"But there is one thing that is the most dangerous of all, and we all have
eaten, or will eat. Would anyone care to guess what food causes the most
grief and suffering for years after eating it?"

After several seconds of quiet, a small 75-year-old Jewish man in the front
row, raised his hand and said, "Vedding Cake?"

Doctor Bloom who was known for miraculous cures for arthritis had a waiting
room full of people when a little old lady, completely bent in half,
shuffled in slowly, leaning on her cane. When her turn came, she went into
the doctor's office, and,amazingly, emerged within half an hour walking
completely erect with her head held high.

A woman in the waiting room who had seen all this went up to the little old
lady and said, "It's a miracle! You walked in bent in half and now you're
walking erect. What did that doctor do?"

She answered, "Miracle, shmiracle . . . he gave me a longer cane."
