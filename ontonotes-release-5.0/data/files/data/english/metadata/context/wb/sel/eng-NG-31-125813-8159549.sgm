Would have been a far more interesting TV programme - there was Pamela
Bordes who dallied with Andrew Neil and little Colin Moynihan the
Sport's Minister - there was the Paymaster General who made gifts of
hundreds of thousands of pounds to Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson
and then threatened Mandy with compromising photos of Mandelson with
rent boys - Mandy's tormentor is *still* Gordon Brown's financial
adviser, I understand.

There must have been a whole can of worms Widdicombe could have delved
into rather than going for soft, easy targets.

Just turning up on the streets late at night and shouting &quot;We're
making a film about prostitution&quot; to various mini-skirted girls, it
was hardly surprising that the first reaction she got was a load of
abuse.  Going in with preset opinions based on her idea of morality
was hardly likely to result in anything particularly meaningful.  She
tried to &quot;save&quot; some poor drug-addicted kid and we had the shots of
used needles and condoms.  Great.

Making it illegal won't stop it happening.  (Er... it *is* illegal,
isn't it?  As is using prohibited drugs.  Ah, yes.)

I don't think Ms Widdicombe contributed anything to help solve any of
the associated problems.  Cheap tv, that's all.

It IS illegal to loiter or tout for business in a public place, it is
illegal (as a &quot;client&quot;) to ask someone if they are there for the purposes of
prostitution (eg. kerb crawling), you can't run a brothel, and you can't
control prostitution for financial reward (eg. pimping).

But, no it is not illegal to charge and/or receive payment for sex.

There'll be more of that because that's what
the Great British Public want.

Oh and soaps, voting-off shows, how-much-is-your-house
shows, newsreaders with no gravitas who chat to you
instead of read the news.............

It's all shit shit shit.

I spend my evenings in watching old telly clips
on YouTube, surfing the web, chatting to people
on the phone and playing Forza
Motorsport 2.

Every few days the telly gets switched on.
