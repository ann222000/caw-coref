The funeral arrangements will be held tomorrow at noon for this ng.
It's a sad day said one bystander, when well known trainers run away
after being asked hard questions to which that have no answers. A few
nlp cult memebers hang on but in their death throes, still hang on to
the belief that richards dick is the way to enlightenment. Now watch
as all the mindless ilky followers post more on crap. ( wonder if they
saw it??? )

mindless irky follower here.

talking of hanging on, it is amazing how accurate a description that
is of your presence here.

You say your piece, then you say the same piece a few days later, then
same again and again and again.  What belief state drivers have you
not yet balanced that prevent you from admitting to yourself the fact
that you continue to increasingly crave validation from this ng.

I only come to this ng to mock you, cos you have a target strapped to
your forhead.  This group ceased to be productive way back, yet here
you are, deluded that you are heralding the fall of the mighty kingdom
of NLP.

This is much different than what some people state. They think that Tim
ruined this group. I say that is not true. This group sucked in 1996. The
highest traffic ratings occured during the highest flame wars.

I am glad we put the "Tim ruined this group" crap to rest.

Damn I wanted that title of ruining this ng, thanks for ruining it for
me.

5,000 years from now my name would have been down in the "anals" of
history as me being the one who took down these slack jawed bitches.
Damn, now I am going to go have to find another ng and start all over.
