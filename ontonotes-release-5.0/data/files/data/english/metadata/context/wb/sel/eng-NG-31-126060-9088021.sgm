Marj Hahne, left, and Emily Wortman-Wunder, recipients of
artist-in-residence awards from the Durango Art Ranch, spoke about
their work Wednesday at Mariaâ€™s Bookshop.For Emily Wortman-Wunder, a
biologist and author, her science and her fiction use similar tools of
observation. &quot;Though I've never radio-collared a character,&quot; she said
Wednesday night at Maria's Bookshop.Wortman-Wunder and Marj Hahne, a
poet, are in Durango for a month as artists-in-residence with the
Colorado Art Ranch. They read from their work and discussed writing
with a dozen people at our local bookstore.
Both talked of removing the ego from writing, nurturing the dark issues
that most people reject and being aware of the key thing to focus on
while discarding details.

Neither talked about mapping, the theme for the Durango Art Ranch
program that brought them to town. Hahne, however, read from the
project she came to Durango to work on, prose poems for every element
in the periodic table.

Colorado Art Ranch brought three writers and three visual artists to
Durango for a month-long residency. They were given a house and studio
space to share and attended this month's Durango Artposium, which was
staged by the Art Ranch.

Wortman-Wunder, Hahne and B.K. Loren are the writers of the group. Only
the first two remain in Durango. A computer problem forced Loren to
return to her home in Broomfield. But all came with a specific project.

For Wortman-Wunder, it was completing a novel set in a fictional town
like Durango. For Loren, it was working on a food book she is writing
with a celebrity chef.
Hahne explained why she chose to participate when she saw the project.
&quot;It was a body/gut hit,&quot; she said. &quot;I like that it inquires into
something in a multidisciplinary way.&quot; Hahne attended the first Art
Ranch event in Salida in May.

When asked about Durango, Hahne said she didn't yet have a sense of the
people but added that it's &quot;easy to meet your kindred here. Not because
they are few and far between, but because they live here.&quot;

Wortman-Wunder said this residency was different from others she's
attended because it was more community centered. Residents are required
to give back to the community one day. Several have worked with
students at Fort Lewis College and attended a local artists' group
meeting. See box at left for the visual artists' open house.

&quot;There was a lot of effort put into us getting to know people and
interact,&quot; she said. She added that each resident was assigned a local
art buddy. The art buddies were Katie Clark, Jules Masterjohn, Mary
Ellen Long, Carol Ozaki, Joan Russell, Carol Martin, Maureen May and
Paul Pennington.

For Wortman-Wonder, who is a mother with two children, the time she had
here in Durango to focus on finishing her novel was &quot;gorgeous.&quot; And she
got to return to the town she lived in 15 years ago.

Loren also has loose ties to Durango.

&quot;I resent that most residencies are on the East Coast,&quot; she
said. &quot;There are few in the West and very few in Colorado, so I want to
support them.&quot;
