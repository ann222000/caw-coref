Hi

I am interested in the impact that different methods of specifying
your fire has on smoke temps/mass flow/etc...

I have read an interesting paper which was presented at Interflam this
year (filename 'vi046-Kim[1].pdf ' under the 'files' heading), which
gave me a little further insight into the impact that FDS's background
calcs has on a specific application.

The paper aimed to simulate the Memorial Tunnel fire tests.  While
undertaking their analysis they observed that the results in FDS
deviated, so far as the amount of LV required to limit back layering,
when compared with the real test results. The paper concludes that
restoring the Baroclinic Torque (which the FDS user guide says is
discounted when using LES) gives results which are more in accordance
with the Memorial results. The FDS User's Guide indicates that this is
because FDS makes the assumption that under most situations the
predominate source of vorticity is provided by the fire and not by
external induced flows (like the longitudinal ventilation in a tunnel
case), which under most cases is probably true.

Taking the above into consideration, my specific question relates to
the specification of the fire. To date I have been using rule of thumb
type guidelines which I have obtained by talking to various FDS users.
This mainly relates to ensuring the HRRPUA is between two bounds,
being a lower limit of 800kW/m2 and upper limit of 1200kW/m2, with a
goal of ensuring enough energy is being simulated into the smoke at an
early stage (where the fire is growing at a t2 rate). My
interpretation of this reasoning was that if the HRRPUA is too low,
the model may underestimate smoke temps at an early stage (since the
growing HRR is averaged over the whole fire surface), and a HRRPUA
that is too high may over estimate temps at the fully developed stage?

Previously, to try to offset this impact I have used a 'growing' type
fire which initially begins as a small obstruction but continues to
grow (appropriate to the HRR) as time continues. For example, a fire
which may have an area of 20m2 at peak HRR is added 1m2 at a time so
that the HRR grows at the desired rate while still maintaining a semi-
accurate area. I used this for a while but was never sure whether this
was the correct approach.

Basically, as far as I can tell there are three basic concepts for
specifying your fire,

1. You can use an accurate fire area and specify the realistic HRRPUA
which may come straight out of SFPE or FEDG, etc. This accepts that
while initial temps are underestimated, peak or steady-state
conditions are more likely to be accurate.

2. You can increase the HRRPUA and reduce the fire area (resulting in
the same overall energy content). This approach requires some type of
'rule of thumb' approach as to which bounds are appropriate. This
attempts to bring the growing smoke/temp more in line with 'reality'
and accepts that results may be over estimated at peak HRR.

3. You could attempt to create a 'growing' fire which increases in
area as time continues and maintains a consistent HRRPUA as well as
fire perimeter.

The main concern I have is that knowing that smoke buoyancy is such a
dominant aspect, the way we specify the fire has the potential to have
a large impact on outputs. Also, unlike mesh sensitivity, performing
HRRPUA sensitivity tests are less obvious since you cant just vary the
HRRPUA until results converge as such.

Any information/thoughts/solutions/common approaches would be
appreciated, since I assume this is something that most FDS users will
have considered.

There is a feature in FDS (U Guide, 8.2.6 Radially Spreading Fire)
that attempts mimic a spreading fire while allowing the user to
control the overall HRR. Maybe this is what you meant by Option 3. In
any case, I implemented this feature several years ago based on this
very type of discussion, but I've never had the occassion to use, and
I have not received much feedback on it. This issue is tricky because
it is both numerical and physical -- is a t2 fire a good &quot;model&quot; of
fire growth, and if so, how do you apply one in FDS.

A good rule of thumb for checking resolution in FDS is to consider D*/
dx (U Guide, 6.3.4 Choosing the Right Mesh Dimensions). I usually
apply this rule to the &quot;steady state&quot; HRR, but in fact, it applies to
the transient start up as well. Given that FDS does not refine the
mesh on the fly, you almost always &quot;under resolve&quot; the fire early on.
Concentrating the fire within a smaller radius is a good way to better
capture reality, but there still remains a resolution issue because D*
is the characteristic fire diameter, not the actual one. D* is a
function of the HRR only, whether it is spread out, or concentrated.

As for Baroclinic Torque, I think that is a slightly different issue.
BT is a source of vorticity that is important when you have very steep
gradients in density (temperature), like at a flame sheet. When we do
fire calcs with very fine resolution, we often invoke
BAROCLINIC=.TRUE. because we are trying to capture the fire behavior
as faithfully as we can. However, for simulations of smoke movement in
large spaces where the fire itself is not well-resolved, we have not
found the BT to play an important role, at least not compared to
buoyancy. That being said, the Interflam paper that you cite is
interesting, and it might suggest that BT is important at the
interface between the hot smoke layer and the lower ambient. For now,
a good idea is to run calcs with and without, and report your findings
to the discussion group. We might find that we need to make the
BAROCLINIC option .TRUE. by default.

If you care about the early timeline (say for smoke detection) then
trying to do option 3 is probably the right thing to do.

I've done some studies on how grid size &amp; the way to model growth
(SPREAD_RATE or TAU_Q) affect plume temperatures and flame
temperatures and will present the results at the Fire Modelling
Conference in Spain next week.

Once that conference is over I will summarize the results on this
forum also.

Judith,
The people who would care most about your work are more than likely on
this Discussion Group.  I hope that you will share more than a summary
here.
In my opinion, you will reach a more complete audience through this
group than in Spain, as I know that many of us will not be attending
the Fire Modeling conference there.

Everyone,
We have created a new vehicle for open information access and I hope
that the global Fire Modeling community realizes this and begins to
take advantage of it.  This group is more than a place to point out
problems with running FDS or Smokeview.  It is a platform to reach the
most active people in this area of work and research.  If you have a
paper or presentation that would be of interest to this group, please
put it on the web somewhere and post a description and a link to it on
this group.  If you don't know how or where to put it on the web,
please email me and I will be happy to point you to some free
resources for this.

Best Regards,
Bryan Klein

&gt; &gt; &gt; A good rule of thumb for checking resolution in FDS is to consider D*/
&gt; &gt; &gt; dx (U Guide, 6.3.4 Choosing the Right Mesh Dimensions). I usually
&gt; &gt; &gt; apply this rule to the &quot;steady state&quot; HRR, but in fact, it applies to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the transient start up as well. Given that FDS does not refine the
&gt; &gt; &gt; mesh on the fly, you almost always &quot;under resolve&quot; the fire early on.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Concentrating the fire within a smaller radius is a good way to better
&gt; &gt; &gt; capture reality, but there still remains a resolution issue because D*
&gt; &gt; &gt; is the characteristic fire diameter, not the actual one. D* is a
&gt; &gt; &gt; function of the HRR only, whether it is spread out, or concentrated.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As for Baroclinic Torque, I think that is a slightly different issue.
&gt; &gt; &gt; BT is a source of vorticity that is important when you have very steep
&gt; &gt; &gt; gradients in density (temperature), like at a flame sheet. When we do
&gt; &gt; &gt; fire calcs with very fine resolution, we often invoke
&gt; &gt; &gt; BAROCLINIC=.TRUE. because we are trying to capture the fire behavior
&gt; &gt; &gt; as faithfully as we can. However, for simulations of smoke movement in
&gt; &gt; &gt; large spaces where the fire itself is not well-resolved, we have not
&gt; &gt; &gt; found the BT to play an important role, at least not compared to
&gt; &gt; &gt; buoyancy. That being said, the Interflam paper that you cite is
&gt; &gt; &gt; interesting, and it might suggest that BT is important at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; interface between the hot smoke layer and the lower ambient. For now,
&gt; &gt; &gt; a good idea is to run calcs with and without, and report your findings
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the discussion group. We might find that we need to make the
&gt; &gt; &gt; BAROCLINIC option .TRUE. by default.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am interested in the impact that different methods of specifying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your fire has on smoke temps/mass flow/etc...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have read an interesting paper which was presented at Interflam this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; year (filename 'vi046-Kim[1].pdf ' under the 'files' heading), which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gave me a little further insight into the impact that FDS's background
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calcs has on a specific application.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The paper aimed to simulate the Memorial Tunnel fire tests.  While
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; undertaking their analysis they observed that the results in FDS
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deviated, so far as the amount of LV required to limit back layering,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when compared with the real test results. The paper concludes that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; restoring the Baroclinic Torque (which the FDS user guide says is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discounted when using LES) gives results which are more in accordance
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with the Memorial results. The FDS User's Guide indicates that this is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because FDS makes the assumption that under most situations the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predominate source of vorticity is provided by the fire and not by
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external induced flows (like the longitudinal ventilation in a tunnel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case), which under most cases is probably true.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Taking the above into consideration, my specific question relates to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the specification of the fire. To date I have been using rule of thumb
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; type guidelines which I have obtained by talking to various FDS users.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This mainly relates to ensuring the HRRPUA is between two bounds,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being a lower limit of 800kW/m2 and upper limit of 1200kW/m2, with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goal of ensuring enough energy is being simulated into the smoke at an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; early stage (where the fire is growing at a t2 rate). My
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interpretation of this reasoning was that if the HRRPUA is too low,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the model may underestimate smoke temps at an early stage (since the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; growing HRR is averaged over the whole fire surface), and a HRRPUA
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is too high may over estimate temps at the fully developed stage?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Previously, to try to offset this impact I have used a 'growing' type
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire which initially begins as a small obstruction but continues to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grow (appropriate to the HRR) as time continues. For example, a fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which may have an area of 20m2 at peak HRR is added 1m2 at a time so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that the HRR grows at the desired rate while still maintaining a semi-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accurate area. I used this for a while but was never sure whether this
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was the correct approach.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, as far as I can tell there are three basic concepts for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specifying your fire,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. You can use an accurate fire area and specify the realistic HRRPUA
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which may come straight out of SFPE or FEDG, etc. This accepts that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while initial temps are underestimated, peak or steady-state
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conditions are more likely to be accurate.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. You can increase the HRRPUA and reduce the fire area (resulting in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same overall energy content). This approach requires some type of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 'rule of thumb' approach as to which bounds are appropriate. This
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attempts to bring the growing smoke/temp more in line with 'reality'
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and accepts that results may be over estimated at peak HRR.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. You could attempt to create a 'growing' fire which increases in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; area as time continues and maintains a consistent HRRPUA as well as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire perimeter.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The main concern I have is that knowing that smoke buoyancy is such a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dominant aspect, the way we specify the fire has the potential to have
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a large impact on outputs. Also, unlike mesh sensitivity, performing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HRRPUA sensitivity tests are less obvious since you cant just vary the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HRRPUA until results converge as such.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any information/thoughts/solutions/common approaches would be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appreciated, since I assume this is something that most FDS users will
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have considered.

Judith,

I've seen on the Cantabria University site that there is no way to
access the proceedings of the conferenece, not even buying them.
Therefore I also hope that you will be sharing your article with this
group.
