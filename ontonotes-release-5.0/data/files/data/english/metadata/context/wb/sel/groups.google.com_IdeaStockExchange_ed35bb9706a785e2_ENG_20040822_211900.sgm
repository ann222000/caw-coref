I am interested in how to create on online community of collaborators.

Specifically I would like to organize ideas much like Google organizes
websites--with the best ones at the top.

To do this I need an online group of people to create a list of
reasons to agree or disagree with as many different propositions as
possible.

Once this is working I would like to create an algorithm that attempts
to put the best ideas at the top.

1. Quantity of reasons that agree or disagree with the idea: The
side
with more reasons (to agree or disagree) would get more points than
the other side. For example this idea has more reasons to agree than
disagree. Just like when you fill out a list of reasons to or not to
do certain activities, you tend to choose the side with more reasons
to agree.
2. Number of people who agree or disagree with the idea: The side
with
more people who agree should get more points. People could vote for or
against ideas.
3. The website with better web links. Better is determined by
Google
rank. There would be a field where you could enter link that &quot;agree&quot;
or &quot;disagree&quot; with the idea. The side with better web links would win.
4. Results of peer evaluations: Their would be forms that people
would
fill out that asked pointed questions about each idea. You could
respond to each question on a scale from 1 to 10. These results would
affect the total score for each idea.
5. Money. &quot;Follow the money.&quot; People could donate money to this
website if they believe in it. But a better way of doing it would be
to let people donate money towards a specific idea. If you don't like
the way this sounds you should read Atlas Shrugged by Ian Rand. I'll
just briefly say that money is the only way of measuring someone's
blood, sweat, and tears. Money is the only way that someone can pay
someone else for their work. Also, it could be used on this website as
tug of war analogue. Money could be donated to each side of an idea.
6. Experts. Each idea would get more points if it was submitted
from
the e-mail address of a professor with a degree in the subject mater
that is being discussed. For instance if someone said that Abraham
Lincoln was an idiot. And someone disagreed, and someone else agreed.
If the person that disagreed had a degree in history and the idea was
submitted to the history section, then the person who disagreed (the
professor) would win. The more prestigious the school, the more
points. Prestigious would be ranked by the US News report, or some
other un-biased judge. I don't care about you people that say, &quot;The
smartest people don't always make the best decisions.&quot; We are talking
about percentages. Of course the smartest people don't always make the
best decisions, but they would tend to make better decisions that
stupid or uneducated people.
7. Items that agree, such as: books, songs, or WebPages. People
would
be able to submit books that they think are important to read to make
an educated decision about a certain topic. For instance &quot;The
communist manifesto&quot; by Carl Marx and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; by Ian Rand may
be considered to be the most important books to read regarding weather
or not we should raise taxes. Those that had read those books, should
have more say on this idea than those who have not, because this
website decided that those books are very important to understand to
make a decision about this issue. But the algorithm could go deeper.
We are only just beginning to enter the rabbit hole. We could let
people who have read these books submit essays on them (like book
reports in school). The people with a higher &quot;grade&quot; on their essays
would get more say in those issues that people have said that those
books are important.

Do you have any suggestions?

Mike, this is a great idea ... this might sound bizarre, but I like the
way you think. My thoughts are a little scattered right now so I don't
have any intelligent comments to make at the moment. But, you
should stick with this.

Thanks! Over the past 6 years, I have only gotten a few people to
respond. To see what others have said, go to:

The only famous person to respond was Robin Hanson. He was the guy who
was working for DARPA trying to get that online stock exchange where
people bet on the likelyhood of terrorist events. The project was
famously canceled.

He is a profesor of economics, and he is interested in the side of my
website where you invest in the ideas. I am more interested in the
process of organizing reasons to agree or disagree with the ideas.
