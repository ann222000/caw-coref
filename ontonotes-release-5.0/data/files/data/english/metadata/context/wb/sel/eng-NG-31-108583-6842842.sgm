Ok..so it looks like IVs are in my future, and possibly Rocephin
(although I do have a choice of Claforan or Primaxin).

If I go w/Rocephin, and end up losing my gall bladder, is it really that
much of a loss?

Hi jloisu,

I don't know, but if I could do it over again I would try to keep mine.
It must be there for a reason? [confused]

I had a pain in my side for years after it was gone and had trouble
digesting fats. My doctor told me this happens to some people after it's
gone but not all.

I guess sometimes there is nothing you can do especailly if it is diseased.

Good luck to you. [Smile]

Hi,

Losing gallbladder in my opinion is better than not getting well.

But my daughter's experience is that 7mos later she is still having
trouble with digestion.

As you probably know they reroute bile delivery from liver straight to
small intestine or stomach--not through gallbladder. Can take a long
time to get things running smoothly.

Also, body had harder time recovering from surgery when already weakened
with lyme.

Have heard that you can have ultrasounds done to check for sludge that
precedes stones.

For us, the decision phase is the hardest.

All said, not guts no glory. I am out to demolish this evil invader.

For me, Jloisu, the surgery wasn't a choice. I had two gall bladder
attacks (the first one wrongly dx as acute gastritis). Both were so
severe I had to go to the ER.

The bouts were about a month apart. With the second, I turned a
fascinating shade of yellow; I was in excruciating pain.

I went straight from the ER to emergency surgery. They removed my gall
bladder laproscopically.

In all, I was in the hospital 4 days (my first hospitalization stay).
Although I went back to work within a week after surgery, I was still a
little uncomfortable. Nothing that was unmanageable, though.

I've had no residual pain -- just about an inch-long scar. As Beverly
said, digesting fats is tricky. I tend to be a pretty healthy eater
(even before my recent Lyme dx), so usually that wasn't an issue.

I do remember once ordering lobster fettucini alfredo. That was a big
mistake! [toilet]
Mostly, I don't ever even think about it, and it really does take an
especially rich dish to put me over the edge.

By the way, my dog had his gall bladder removed about a month after I
did (the vet said sympathetic sickness). His recovery took a lot longer,
but he's fine now too. [Wink]

hey,

I have to agree about the gall bladder being there for a reason.

My LLMD had me on it by itself and I've read about actigall being
presribed with Rocephin.

I was not on actigal and developed gallstones
(coincidence??)

I haven't had any problems in i think two weeks.

[bonk] -(me knocking on wood)

They wanted to take it out three weeks ago, but I didn't think it was
necessary because it wasn't that bad and the sx disappeared after a few
days.

I know in dr. b's guidelines there is an alternative to rocephin that
has 5% biliary....
as oposed to rocephin's 95% - yeah, I stink at remembering but I got the
#'s right!

I would definitely try to protect your gall bladder and I don't think
you HAVE to sacrifice it for treatment. unless it's not working...
Especially if you know about things like actigall or alternatives to
rocephin BEFORE you start tx..

also, I'll be starting Primaxin since my LLMD finally came through after
how many weeks.
I've read great things on this so maybe you could do that?
I don't know anything about Claforan.

What ever you decide I wish you all of the luck in the world with your tx.

I hope I've helped a little! I'm new at this and I'm sure more
knowledgable members will be by soon.

I didn't mean my post to sound like I was an advocate for gall bladder
removal.

I don't consider any major organ expendable and figure it's better to
hold on to things until you no longer have a choice. That was my situation.

Until I got on this board, I had NO idea Lyme was so linked to gall
bladder. Now I'm wondering if it's an organ especially vulnerable to
this disease (my attack occurred in the 9 years between my tick
bite/rash and treatment) or if it's the drugs that have such a bad effect.

Maybe some combination of both.

Thanks for all your responses. I know that everything serves a purpose,
so I don't really want to lose it if I don't have to. Especially if that
means even when I get better it will cause problems eating pizza!

I am in the process of deciding whether to change LLMDs. The one is
prescribing Rocephin w/Actigall. I like him, but he is far away and
feels that Rocephin is the best choice, and isn't considering any other
alternative IVs. He feels that Columbia is still using it and they are
in his words "much smarter than he is".

The new LLMD I just visited is closer (yet still a 7 hr drive each way).
I don't feel quite as comfortable with him because he is very into the
hormone treatment, heprin treatment, etc. (which is probably necessary),
but is open to alternate IVs such as Claforan (that is the 5% bilary
excretion that you are referring to Kimmi - cefotaxime sodium), but I
have heard that people aren't having good luck w/it - am I wrong?

Then there is Primaxin. Heard good stuff about it, but it is pretty new
and not many people out there to get feedback from.

Thanks,

jloisu

Hi Joe,
I had my gallbladder removed in 79; 25 yrs. BEFORE I discovered I had
lyme disease misdx!

My gallbladder hospital experience was a daily soap opera. Every day if
something wrong could go wrong, it did including a realy bad staph
infection....there 12-14 days.

This began my irritable bowel/bladder trips; where now I live in my
bathroom...ha.

Cutting those muscles still hurt me currently.

I do recommend laser surgery to avoid what I/many others went thru.

good luck.

Jloisu,

LOL.... Okay, I guess I did know a little about Claforan ...lol
besides the stones, I think I did well on rocephin though, and wish I
could stay on it.
Maybe you could ask how people did with the actigal/ rocephin.. as far
as any gall bladder problems. I think PQ is/was on it.

Andie,
I don't think you sounded at all like you had any other choice, and
believe me I'm only hanging on to it while I can. If it gets as bad as
you were discribing.... It's outta here!
I think the dr.'s I had were just a little cut happy.
How's your dog?
Posted by lymeloco (Member # 7192) on 06 October, 2005 04:32 PM :

I had no choice about having gb removed. My problems were before rocephin.

I haven't had any problems with it gone. My daughter both had there's
out, and there not on antibiotics.

I ended up with pancreatiits from a stone getting lodged in the
pancreatic duct. It was touch and go for awhile. Three weeks and 2 days
in the hospital.

I was on tetracycline only a very short time when all hell broke loose.
Sometimes it takes about a month or two for your body to adjust after
surgery. You'll have to watch your fat intake for a month till your body
adjusts.

My daughter went to work two days after her surgery. I never heard of
actigal until I came on here, so don't know much about it.

The surgeon did not believe it was the tetracycline. He questioned
whether it was the lyme. Llmd said we don't know.

Who needs it anyway? [Smile]

In my opinion also prostate is unnecessary.
Posted by Andie333 (Member # 7370) on 06 October, 2005 11:54 PM :

Kimmi,
Gall bladder surgery is so rare in dogs they had to call in a surgical
specialist. They didn't do laproscopic surgery but cut him end to end.
Then, he just couldn't seem to heal.

They kept calling us, telling us he might not survive the day...but he
kept fighting. And the charges mounted.

Friends suggested several times that we let him go. All I could think
was: if he really developed this sickness sympathetically, how could I
possibly justify putting him down.

So I tapped into my retirement account. He was in the vet's for 8 weeks.
Came away tired and stiff but fundamentally okay.

My S/O is a shiatsu massage therapist, and the pup's now a therapist
assistant. He greets people at the door, leads them into the office,
lies under the massage table for the duration of treatment then takes
them back to the door when the session is over. He's 10 now. Not as spry
as other Aussies his age, but he has a heart the size of Montana.

I just keep telling him I do not need him to get Lyme...

All I know is that after my dtr's gall bladder surgery, which she had to
have due to severe pain, and not tolerating even any food, is when she
finally started showing some improvment - this after 3 long years of
getting worse and worse with her LD.

Now was that improvement due to the 13 months of Rocephin, or having the
gall bladder removed that was harboring those nasty bugs!?!?!? We don't
know..... but at least she finally started showing some improvements -
instead of always getting worse and worse!!!!!!

We would do the same thing again - in hind sight. (Rocephin and gall
bladder removed).
Posted by CaliforniaLyme (Member # 7136) on 10 October, 2005 11:02 AM :

I don't miss mine at all!!! Some people can get diarrhea or nausea or
gas more when they eat fatty foods without a gallbladder. My system was
off-kilter for about 2 weeks after surgery and then back to normal-
!!!!! Don't miss it at all.

But if you pulse and are on acti-gall you have a better chance of no
problems. I did neither-!!
Posted by Kara Tyson (Member # 939) on 10 October, 2005 12:06 PM :

Mine burst from gall bladder disease well before I had Lyme. It was
emergency surgery the old fashioned way--something I would not recommend.

I dont miss it.
