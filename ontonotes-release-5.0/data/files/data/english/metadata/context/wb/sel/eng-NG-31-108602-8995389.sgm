I know that some cats do enjoy or at least tolerate traveling in a carrier
in a car. I have never had a cat like that. They always go to their
&quot;mountain lion&quot; voice whenever in a car.

Is car traveling something that can be taught to a cat? There is the
possibility that I will want Marmalade to do a little weekend car traveling
with me, and I can't listen to him howl the whole time.

I have a nice little traveling &quot;kennel&quot; for him. Should I start out by
putting him in this every time I go anywhere (run to town, grocery store,
etc) and taking him with me? Our weather is very mild right now, so it
wouldn't be a problem to leave him in the car while I ran into the store.

Has anyone every trained a cat in this way, or is it just something that
they either hate or like?

I dunno, Kathy, I've never tried it except when it was absolutely
necessary to take them, like to the vets. Some of them will yowl, at
least for a bit. I'd never let a cat travel free in the car unless I
had a way to say block off the back seat (to the floor or they'll crawl
under seats), or could harness them and secure the harness. Some cats
certainly do travel free in the vehicle w/o any problem - I just
wouldn't trust them not to be under your feet interfering with your
ability to control the car. Probably just depends on the cat.

By the way, I think I have a matching cat to yours now. I found a
little orange Tabby female in my yard a week ago after dark. I've
advertised and put up sign, etc., no one has claimed her (though I
suspect she may have come from a neighbor on our road - they haven't
responded). So, we now have little Alanis (she looks like Morris,
Morris-ette, ergo Alanis).

Too bad Uncle Sid has passed on. He could have told you how to travel
with a cat. :D :D :D

Old story I told once about my step-grandfather getting rid of a cat.
It was funny! I wish I could find it because I am SURE I embellished it
some. Heh.

I don't think I'd let him free in the car. If he'd just not yowl in his
carrier, I'd be happy. I spoil him rotten and don't like to hurt his
feelings. (gawd, i'm awful). Right now I have to give him a dropper of
antibiotic and put ointment on his chin, and he really scolds me and makes
me pay for that injustice.

That is so cute how you came up with Alanis for the name. I'm thinking she's
probably yours to keep now. Hopefully someone doesn't show up for her after
you're attached.

Was this the Uncle Sid with the bum foot that the cat (Ophelia or
something like that) attacked. LOL. You need to tell that one again,
even if you did embellish it a bit.

Yeah, I hope not. It's been more than a week. I've had a bright-pink
sign on mailboxes at end of our road, ad in local magazine since
Thursday or Friday, and I called Animal Control Officer and let her
know immediately - I'll give it another week or so and then proceed
with getting her fixed.

She's tiny but I think had kittens not too long ago - not lactating but
had recently. She was fine with the dogs almost immediately. Within an
hour or two, my lab went into his crate to lay down and she went in and
laid down right next to him. As far as other cats, that's getting
better. They haven't been too pushy, but she has gone after them LOL.
THey are twice her size and they run. One night she was on bed with DH
and other cat came up on chair next to the bed. Alanis launched herself
at him in a fury - sounding like she was about 10 times bigger than she
actually is. But, she's getting to sniffing noses cautiously with them
already.

When we moved from NJ to Florida 20 years ago was the last time we traveled
with cats!  Several.  I think the answer is if it is a long enough trip they
will get over howling!  We shipped our horses with a commercial carrier so
they could all come at once, so when we pulled our trailer down we brought
most of the cats.  The trailer had a dressing room, and we had cages in
there.  They were pretty loud at first, but in a couple of hours they
settled down--by the 2 1/2 days it took to get here they were seasoned
travelers.

We had left one cat that we thought we had a home for, and the people never
came to get him.  I had flown back to NJ to close on that property and bring
our other car down, so I had the cat to bring.  I started out with him in a
carrier, and he was unhappy.  I finally let him loose in the car and he
curled up on my lap and that is where he spent the whole trip.  The only
problem was that my Doberman, who was also traveling with me, did not see
why Puff could sit on my lap while I was driving, and she could not.

But, I really do think if you had the opportunity to take the cat for a very
long ride she would get used to it, but if she didn't quiet down it would be
misery for both of you.  The &quot;long ride theory&quot; works quite well with dogs.

Yep, that was Uncle Sid with the horrible foot. The other cat was
killing his birds at the feeder, at their house. He was mighty picky
about his birds, and sat in the carport with an air rifle,
systematically picking off &quot;undesirable&quot; birds - Jays, sparrows,
anybody unfortunate enough not to be pretty. This stray cat got a
cardinal so Sid trapped the cat and hauled it off. I can't remember
just how all that happened, but he put the cat in a Safeway bag and off
they went. The cat got loose in the car and nearly killed Uncle Sid. He
was lacerated from the top of his bald head to his ankles, bleeding
like a cut hog. As I recall, he got pretty infected from it later. He
got the thing way out in the country and FINALLY got it out of the car.
Went home - stopped at the drug store or something on the way - and
there was the cat. I'll have to ask my mother the rest of it, because
we laughed about it for years.

Ooh. Yes. Uncle Sid had what was at that time the absolute WORST-EVER
documented case of coccidiodomycosis. Rather than having it in his
lungs or his skin, he had it everywhere. It settled the most in his
foot (he was an inpatient for three years at the VA). His poor foot was
just horrible. It was so purple and swollen. I don't know how he ever
got to keep it. We couldn't even bear to look at it. It gagged us. I
can't imagine he didn't know that. But he kept it bare and propped up
on the recliner. He had kicked Odessa for years because she was an
ankle-biter in the morning. She hated him with a passion.

The day this thing happened, he was propped up snoozing in the
recliner. Odessa was on top of the book case. We looked up there and
she was crouched, tail twitching and eyes narrowed to slits. She AIMED
at that foot and jumped from the 6-foot bookcase.

I wish I could remember the rest of it, but I remember that we just RAN
in the other room when she landed on that poor foot.
