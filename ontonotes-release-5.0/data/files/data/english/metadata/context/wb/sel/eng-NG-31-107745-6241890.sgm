Tea: Can Tea Drinking Reverse Endothelial Dysfunction?

Article Description:
====================

Endothelial dysfunction is a precursor to heart disease. It is
often seen years before actual heart disease. In fact, it is
estimated that about half of those over the age of 40 have
endothelial dysfunction.

Tea: Can Tea Drinking Reverse Endothelial Dysfunction?

Endothelial dysfunction is a precursor to heart disease. It is
often seen years before actual heart disease. In fact, it is
estimated that about half of those over the age of 40 have
endothelial dysfunction.

The endothelium is the cells that line the inner surface of all
blood vessels including arteries and veins. When the endothelium
is functioning properly, it is responsible for mediation of
coagulation, platelet adhesion, immune function, and control of
volume and electrolyte content of the intravascular and extra
vascular spaces.

When the endothelium does not function properly, veins and
arteries have difficulty dilating properly. These problems are
thought to be the precursor to atherosclerosis, which is a
leading cause of heart disease.

Several things can cause endothelial dysfunction, including
cigarette smoking and diseases like high blood pressure and
diabetes. Diets high in fat and cholesterol can also affect the
function of the endothelium.

One interesting piece of research surrounding protecting
endothelial function is a study reported by the American Heart
Association. This study examined patients who already had
coronary artery disease. Sixty-six patients with heart disease
participated in the study, which provided them with a beverage
supplement each day.

Some of the participants received a supplement of black tea while
others received only water. They were tested 2 hours after
receipt of their first supplement and 4 weeks after they had been
receiving the supplements daily.

This study concluded that tea had a positive effect on artery
dilation as early as two hours after consumption. In addition,
long term consumption of tea helped artery dilation long term, as
well. The patients who received the water supplement showed no
improvement.

In addition, some patients were treated with a supplement of just
caffeine, to try and determine if the caffeine in tea was the
ingredient that provided the effect.

The study showed that the patients receiving a caffeine
supplement did not show the improvement in artery dilation that
was seen by the participants who drank tea. So, we know that tea
contains other important substances that help improve endothelial
function besides just caffeine.

The substances likely responsible for tea's ability to improve
endothelial function are tea's anti-oxidants. Anti-oxidants are
important to our bodies for many reasons. The most important
function of anti-oxidants is the scavenging of free radicals.
Free radicals are oxygen containing molecules that are formed as
a by-product of our digestive process.

Left unchecked, they can damage our cells and DNA, causing
damage, aging and disease. But, anti-oxidants scavenge these free
radicals before they can cause damage.

In addition to the powerful anti-oxidants contained in tea,
fruits and vegetables contain anti-oxidants as does coffee, wine
and chocolate. Ensuring that your diet is full of anti-oxidants
is important to many aspects of your health.

Your diet is important, in particular, to preventing or treating
heart disease. In addition to ensuring that your diet is rich in
anti-oxidants, there are some other things you can do to help
your heart. It's important to remove trans fats from your diet
entirely.

Read product labels looking for the words hydrogenated or
partially hydrogenated. If you see these words in the
ingredients, there are trans fats, which are believed to have a
particularly negative effect on your endothelial function.

Reduce your level of other saturated fats, too. This means
reducing the amount of red meat and egg yolks you consume; making
the bulk of your protein come from fish, poultry and low fat
dairy products. Choosing lean meats that are lower in fat and
cholesterol can make a big difference in the health of your
heart.

Another important factor in reducing endothelial dysfunction is
controlling your weight. Eat right and get regular exercise to
ensure that your weight falls within a normal range. Losing
weight can help control your blood pressure and cholesterol
levels, too, which are important to ensuring proper endothelial
function and preventing heart disease. Exercise is especially
important.

Exercise can lower your cholesterol and blood pressure, help you
lose weight and help you gain muscle. Gaining muscle mass can
help you burn more calories even when resting and can help you
stay strong as you age. Aim for some form of cardiovascular
exercise 3-5 times a week and strength training 2-3 times a
week.

And, of course, don't forget your daily dose of tea. Whether you
like it hot or iced, tea is a great way to help get your dose of
anti-oxidants and protect your heart. You can choose black tea,
or if you prefer, green tea. Green tea, in particular has been
linked to the prevention of many diseases, including some forms
of cancer.

And, while black tea is still the most popular form of tea in the
Western world, green tea is gaining popularity rapidly because of
its health benefits. But, whatever tea you choose, you can be
sure that you're protecting your health, and your heart.
