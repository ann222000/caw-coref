If the total cost of the shuttle program, about $150G, were divided by
the total number of launches, almost 120, and pretending that each
mission delivered 30 tons to orbit, the cost per pound would be over
$20000.  Now make the wild assed assumption (WAA?) that we could have
a RLV, in the range of twenty tons to leo, like the largest of the
falcon 9 series or a delta IV, that made deliveries for $4000/Kg, but
only if it is launched atleast a dozen times a year. That would be 240
tons to leo for a bit under $1G.  What could utilize the payload space
that might win public support and not run more than four times it's
delivery price.
Water, or bulk propellants have been suggested, but I don't think this
will make the kids all starry eyed.

The Keck telescopes have a bit over 16 times the light collection area
of the HST and are made of 36 mirror segments.  Most of the 270 ton
weight and $100M cost is to keep the structure rigid against
gravitational distortion.  Building a succession of assemblable space
telescopes, ASTs, would be a real coup for astronomy.  Along with its
robotic and/or human assemblers it would use up a few hundred tons of
capacity over a decade.
Robotic water prospectors at the moons pole could eat up another
hundred.  A VP assembled mass driver would be good for a couple of
years worth of cargos, but it would be a greater advance than was
landing a man on the moon.
Mastering the art of drilling on Phobos, and returning samples, could
easily call for another 200 worth, as would setting down half a dozen
rugged rovers on the geological feast that is Mars.

Of course this is so much handwaving on my part.  I can atleast dream
of a leadership that chops and pounds with its hands, while
proclaiming a new age of space exploration and enterprise, on a $5G/yr
budget, something like Kennedy did 46 years ago.

Why is space different from anything else? If there is insufficient
cargo to go up surely the logical solution is bankrupcy - that is to
say you apply natural selection and reduce the number of launchers.
That would be the solution anywhere else in the economy.

When we have Ariane, Proton, Soyuz, Long march and a few Delta/Atlas
type launchers the development of a shuttle replacement is total
madness. What we really need is the Adam Smith launcher. NASA instead
of developing launchers should pay so much per kg and get private
enterprise to provide the facilities. Probably what we would come up
with would be Proton/Soyuz technology, some purchasing of complete
systems and some licensing. Anyway that is what the management would
have to decide. Private enterpise would also cater for the global
market.

Why do we insist that space is developed by socialism? Why doesn't the
US do what it constantly nags third world countries to do and have a
genuinely open market?

There is no need for new technology such as hypersonic aircraft to
reduce launch costs. These would come down anyway with the demise of
Socialism.

No, they'd go up.  Everyone goes broke but Proton/Soyuz.  Then they

This in fact happens all the time. A company is mismanaged, goes broke

Let it be sold.

Nonsense. Demand will always find its own level. If there id no demand
why talk about new launcher facilities. IT JUST DOESNT MAKE SENSE.

The argument about monopoly is always present in a capitalist system.
In fact what I would advocate is the purchase of complete Soyuz/Proton
systems. In that way Russian bureaucracy would be circumvented. It
would be preferable from this viewpoint to have a private enterprise
company launching payloads, rather that purchase it from Russia on a
per kg basis. I am not in favor of getting rid of drawings, you always
need the ability to compete.

What I would be in favor of is this. Remove all space launchers from
national bureaucracies - Have 2 private companies purchasing IPR
rights. This might be of the form of one lump payment or a per launch/
kg basis. Then let competition start. The companies involved could
decide on their policies. Proton/Soyuz/Long March are clearly cheaper
than anything else. This might be better technology or simply reflect
low labor costs. If the latter it might be an idea to build Ariane in
Russia or China just as tea shirts are made there.

Comanies would then have to think how they could expand their
business. Attention to the customer is key to most situations. I am
told that although Ariane is more expensive than Soyuz/Long March the
bureaucratic restrictions are less. This is another characteristic of
socialism, the lack of attention to the customer. Arianespace could be
one company. Possibly Virgin Galactic could be another I dobn't know.
If space tourism is viable it should be marketed. Private enterprise
markets and tries to attact customers.

As far as energy is concerned Russia is charging the market rate. The
thing to do is to reduce dependence on imported energy. Space is of
course not like this. In energy you have a large market and a definite
international price. In space governments and socialism have inflated
market assessments. Socialism, I call NASA socialist and all the
astronauts are good socialists in this regard, does not attempt to
market, it does not have to stake its shirt on getting accurate market
forecasts.

Your posting in fact convinces me even more of the truth of what I am
saying. Space is not national virility, it is no different from any
other business. If NASA cannot do a proper market forecast its
bureaucracy should forfeit their shirts as they would anywhere else.

I've already explained to you in great detail over and over again Tork.

First of all, there will always be a demand for oxygen and fresh water,
anywhere and anytime, and anyone who claims otherwise is a crackpot.

Secondly, to establish demand for anything you have to have a product
and a means of transporting that product to market. Thus, by simple
logical deduction you need a prototype. In order to waive a great deal
of the development costs, it is a rational approach to use an existing
variation on existing products and markets. In space that means building
your prototype out of existing engines and tank technology. Since
demonstrably we do not yet have RLV technology, the rational approach
indicated that we should first attempt less ambitious variations of
existing ELV techniques, for instance, recovery of the first stages,
demonstration of cryogenic expendable single stage to orbit, etc.

Now lets get into details. Rocket stages are fragile. They break when
even just slightly dented. Ok, let's forget stage recovery. What about
stage reuse in orbit? We already have a demonstrable upper stage orbital
debris problem, so let's focus on that. For instance, when man rated
EELVs dock with the space station, they already include the upper stage
as payload, particularly with high energy cryogenic upper stages. Those
stages often contain significant amounts of residual fuel, oxygen and
hydrogen which is easily converted to water. Thus we have our oxygen to
breathe, hydrogen for propellant, and water to drink and grow plants.
There then remains the engines, which clearly can be reused in any
ambitious deep space exploration program, and the hydrogen tank, which
is large enough in any case to be converted to habitat and hotel rooms.
The unused engines can be easily returned to Earth to be reused again.

Logic is great, isn't it? Let's consider launch. Single stage to orbit
is basically a glorified large upper stage. Thus, the payload (engines,
tankage, residual fuel, payload and infrastructure) is always readily
available as product demonstrably in demand at any orbital spaceport.
The large orbiting cryogenic tankage for all purposes is the spaceport.

I've gone through all of the demonstrable benefits of cryogenic SSTO and
TSTO space flight. Now tell me, what the fuck is wrong with you people?

They aren't expendables, they are reusables. Everything is reused.

No, the guests will fly on EELVs in the beginning, until an engine is

I thought when I made my contribution that someone would have raised
the question of military space launches which would not fit so easily
into the competition scheme I have outlined.

Above is the answer. Space cannot be allowed to be used for military
purposes. As soon as ASATs get moving space will become unusable for
EVERYONE. All you need to knock the space environment out completely
is some bags of sand in a counter rotational orbit with chemical
explosives to disperse it. No nukes required.

You may be right. Your shirt please. I feel that if we got removed
from bureaucracy and subsidy we might be in a better position. I tend
to feel that Science should have a budget. It could then decide
whether to spend the money on Earth based astronomy or space. If space
it would be free to find the cheapest solution. One part of a cheap
solution that should not be ignored is this. Do you send up a single
entity where if something goes wrong the mission is useless, or do you
send a swarm where the system is failure tolerant? A failure tolerant
system might have a lower development cost with less checking and less
expensive components, but a higher launch cost. Quite clearly that
should be for scientists to decide NASA does not have a role.

One thing for sure. If people were doing this kind of tradeoff we
would be better able to look at the economics of alternatives.

&gt; Above is the answer. Space cannot be allowed to be used for military

I'm no fan of space militarization, but prohibiting military uses of
space is virtually impossible, because almost everything up there is
dual-use anyway.  Weather satellites have intelligence value, as do
some earth-resources survey satellites.  GPS has military uses
(indeed, didn't they used to encrypt the low-order fine position
information?  And I suppose it's pretty simple to reinstate it.)

You have your ASATs and you have your ASATs.  Some have proposed low-/
no-debris disabling technologies.  The main threat would be in some
opponent who decides to deny LEO to everybody, himself included,
through such low-tech means as your "bags of sand."  They'd have to
kick a lot of sand, though.  Which would mean they were already an
existing space power themselves to a great extent, and thus with some
incentive to exercise restraint, to preserve the value of a high sunk
cost (launch capability) for which they had to economize elsewhere in
their defense budget.

&gt; &gt; The first aim of NASA should be to bring launch costs down.  Henry
&gt; &gt; suggests that a RLV could do this, at least if it is launched
&gt; &gt; frequently enough.  To justify this, suitable payloads must be part of
&gt; &gt; the plan.
&gt; &gt; A mass range of 20 tons to orbit is large enough that per launch costs
&gt; &gt; under $2000/Kg might be achievable, yet small enough to require the
&gt; &gt; frequent flights that can amortise the initial costs, for an overall
&gt; &gt; cost of $4000/Kg.  It could provide the technology and experience to
&gt; &gt; pave the way for further drops in price.
&gt; &gt; The present VSE is to use SRBs and disposable RS68 engines to put a
&gt; &gt; manned base on the moon.  For less cost we could have missions that
&gt; &gt; really bring home the data for deep space astronomy and the solar
&gt; &gt; system, and a launch system that dosn't ditch itself in the Atlantic
&gt; &gt; after each countdown.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; You may be right. Your shirt please. I feel that if we got removed
&gt; from bureaucracy and subsidy we might be in a better position. I tend
&gt; to feel that Science should have a budget. It could then decide
&gt; whether to spend the money on Earth based astronomy or space. If space
&gt; it would be free to find the cheapest solution. One part of a cheap
&gt; solution that should not be ignored is this. Do you send up a single
&gt; entity where if something goes wrong the mission is useless, or do you
&gt; send a swarm where the system is failure tolerant? A failure tolerant
&gt; system might have a lower development cost with less checking and less
&gt; expensive components, but a higher launch cost. Quite clearly that
&gt; should be for scientists to decide NASA does not have a role.

&gt; One thing for sure. If people were doing this kind of tradeoff we

not prove to be a superior course, but we can never know unless it's
tried.

I haven't seen anyone complain about the various water-prospecting-

It's a relatively easy one.  Anybody who's had junior high school
science classes knows that water is hydrogen and oxygen, and that the
combination is combustible and used to power rockets.  Anybody can
testify before Congress and say "if there's water on the Moon, and we
can mine it, we'll be able to do a lot more on a budget that's about
on par with what American spend on potato chips."

I think asteroid prospecting has a better chance if it's paired with
asteroid defense, which has an appeal all out of proportion to the
assessed risks (so far).  There may be synergies.  Currently, the best
designs for deflecting asteroids depend on ion engines.  If there are
ISRU propellant scenarios, better designs might be possible.  And that
leads in the direction of ISRU for other purposes.

This is a tough one.  When the meme of manned Mars missions costing
upwards of a trillion dollars got going in the press, there was very
little public skepticism about that number, and probably because most
people think NASA's budget is many times what it really is.

It's interesting how perceptions are created and how they form on
their own.  In the building of the case for invading Iraq, the more
sober-sided intelligence analysts kept trying to keep it real, but the
pro-invasion hawks kept "sticking that baby in there" -- they
intercepted any documents going higher, and kept injecting their
highly questionable "1% likelihood" reports.

What the space program needs is some mole in the White House with a
reality agenda: to make sure that every presidential or vice-
presidential speech mentioning the space program would get a
comparison or simile that helped bring public perceptions of NASA's
budget back down to Earth.  "Our Moon-Mars program, which will only
cost what Americans spend every year on video games [soft drinks /
potato chips / doughnuts / dieting aids that don't work] ...."

Stick that baby in there!  Every time!

Sticking that baby in there one more time: various Citizens in Space

You'll always have "bridge-to-nowhere" naysayers, no matter what.
Apollo did a fairly good job of making the journey the reward, but
mainly by retracing steps and going a little further each time.  When
there wasn't much further to go, it started to die.  Bridge-building
is civil engineering.  Bridge-building in space gets less and less
interesting to the taxpayer the more it's oriented around logistics to
make all space access, exploration and exploitation cheaper.  Say
"space" and a lot of people's eyes light up.  Say "space logistics"
and brow-furrows appear, eyes glaze over.  It's a hard sales job.
Maybe selling it gets easier if you hike and maintain the human
interest, and sending more different kinds of people, more often,
might be the way to appeal to the masses.  If that works, you can
start saying "If you let us do *this*, al that human stuff you like to
see gets easier and cheaper to pull off.  Not to mention that it makes
robotic missions easier and cheaper as well."  I doubt there's a
strategy that's both cost-optimal and politically possible.

Scientists will have to choose between Hubble and two Kecks - True. I

space. We may take this question one stage further and ask how far
science should be subsidized. In fact most countries and most

not directly applicable to immediate aims. There is an obvious benefit
for example in having your best students sitting at the feet of the
great.

If you are talking about demand for items like comm sats which are
completely commercial, there is no problem. In terms of scientific
space exploration somehow scientists will have to try to put their
point of view across. The scientific establishment has, correctly,
opposed Intelligent Design vociforously and there is a sign that it
has started to get its point of view across.

One very simple question :- LISA How do you talk to a President who
believes in Adam and Eve about Inflation and the first 3 minutes? 3
minutes is how long it takes to eat an apple - only it was not an
apple it resulted from a Latin pun - mallus and malus. There is no pun
in Hebrew. Questions like these tend to make one want to say I do not
want the likes of him making any sort of decision.

It is NOT true to say that there is no connection between manned and
scientific. The scentific program was raided to pay for the Shuttle
repairs.

I don't think the task as far as the general public is concerned is
completely hopeless. On the news there was a report on the new
colliding rings at CERN. A dig for LISA could have been put in as
well.

LISA has caught my imagination. Sure there are other scientific
experiments of great merit but this, with the possible exception of
dark matter, is the only one that can win a Nobel prize.

Asteroid defense - Yes this is an excellent topic/ However yet again I
do not believe astronauts have a role.

&gt; &gt; imagination.

&gt; It's a relatively easy one.  Anybody who's had junior high school
&gt; science classes knows that water is hydrogen and oxygen, and that the
&gt; combination is combustible and used to power rockets.  Anybody can
&gt; testify before Congress and say &quot;if there's water on the Moon, and we
&gt; can mine it, we'll be able to do a lot more on a budget that's about
&gt; on par with what American spend on potato chips.&quot;
">

In principle it is simple.  In practice, there must be an energy
source, poor performing heat radiators, perhaps a three stage process
for H2 liquification and active refrigeration.  Then there has to be
transportation and connection.  I doubt that a practical system could
be set up on the moon for less than 50 tons.

&gt; &gt; Likewise, to boldly seek out new resources in the
&gt; &gt; asteroids and moons of mars might generate public support.  The
&gt; &gt; persuit isn't a dead end, it is a beginning.

&gt; I think asteroid prospecting has a better chance if it's paired with
&gt; asteroid defense, which has an appeal all out of proportion to the
&gt; assessed risks (so far).  There may be synergies.  Currently, the best
&gt; designs for deflecting asteroids depend on ion engines.  If there are
&gt; ISRU propellant scenarios, better designs might be possible.  And that
&gt; leads in the direction of ISRU for other purposes.

&gt; &gt; Actually, most people polled think NASA has a budget that is closer
&gt; &gt; the the expenditures for defense.

&gt; This is a tough one.  When the meme of manned Mars missions costing
&gt; upwards of a trillion dollars got going in the press, there was very
&gt; little public skepticism about that number, and probably because most
&gt; people think NASA's budget is many times what it really is.

&gt; It's interesting how perceptions are created and how they form on
&gt; their own.  In the building of the case for invading Iraq, the more
&gt; sober-sided intelligence analysts kept trying to keep it real, but the
&gt; pro-invasion hawks kept &quot;sticking that baby in there&quot; -- they
&gt; intercepted any documents going higher, and kept injecting their
&gt; highly questionable &quot;1% likelihood&quot; reports.

&gt; What the space program needs is some mole in the White House with a
&gt; reality agenda: to make sure that every presidential or vice-
&gt; presidential speech mentioning the space program would get a
&gt; comparison or simile that helped bring public perceptions of NASA's
&gt; budget back down to Earth.  &quot;Our Moon-Mars program, which will only
&gt; cost what Americans spend every year on video games [soft drinks /
&gt; potato chips / doughnuts / dieting aids that don't work] ....&quot;

&gt; Stick that baby in there!  Every time!

&gt; &gt; Man in space has much more of an allure in prospect, but people get
&gt; &gt; bored with it quickly.  It is a slow news day when there is a story
&gt; &gt; about the ISS, the science is not compelling and does not have
&gt; &gt; commertial applications.

&gt; Sticking that baby in there one more time: various Citizens in Space
&gt; programs have been proposed, and this might be a good way to stave off
&gt; the onset of boredom.  A fresh and unscripted face on every flight
&gt; might be good.  I think sending kids would be best, though I can
&gt; imagine the objections.  Teachers in Space had a following, until they
&gt; tried to send the first one up on Challenger.

That's the problem, one failure ends the program instead of being just

&gt; &gt; $1G, 1% of the ISS, but they are just as popular.

&gt; Yes, but would more Mars Rovers be greeted with the same enthusiasm?

That is especially true for the moon but mars will have a more

Interesting thought! Quite a lot in it. There is one major political
point and that is that the major powers do not want to go to war
anyway. If that is the case then why spend vast sums on space anyway.
I suppose there is the case of a rogue state or terrorist group
getting control of a limited space capability. Just as we are afraid
of Iran getting nuclear weapons. ABM systems and (son of) Star Wars
are of course aimed at Iran and not at Russia or China.

If the major powers do not want war armiing against them is a waste of
money.

If this is the case it might be an idea for the big boys, the US, EU,
Russia and China to get together and share ABM and ASAT technology.
There also needs to be psychological research done on Al Qaeda and
other dangerous etherial beliefs. This again is something that is in
everyone's interest. Definition etherial view - This is a psycological
term for a belief which is strongly held and has no rational
antecedents. It is ofen religious - Dawkins, religion is the root of
all evil. Atheistic etherialism is also present and is very dangerous.

As I said symmetic armament is probably a waste of money. We need to
get together and combat the mutual asymmetic threat.

"Sandbagging" space access seems an extremely unlikely scenario.  It
is too advanced a technology for N Korea or Iran to mount on any kind
of scale, and it would take a long time for collision debre to
develope, not to mention the scorn it would generate from all the
players.  My hope for some kind of launch rate competition derived
from a percieved military advantage is somewhat cynical, but the
synergism of military and civilian aviation is what has kept the US
the top aircraft manufacturer.  The US defense budget is over $530G
for fiscal 2007, some 33 times nasa's budget.  Were some of that to go
to space access via an RLV it would leave a more valuable legacy than
raptors and B2s.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that might win public support and not run more than four times it's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; delivery price.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Water, or bulk propellants have been suggested, but I don't think this
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will make the kids all starry eyed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I've already explained to you in great detail over and over again Tork.

&gt;&gt;&gt; First of all, there will always be a demand for oxygen and fresh
&gt;&gt;&gt; water, anywhere and anytime, and anyone who claims otherwise is a
&gt;&gt;&gt; crackpot.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Secondly, to establish demand for anything you have to have a product
&gt;&gt;&gt; and a means of transporting that product to market. Thus, by simple
&gt;&gt;&gt; logical deduction you need a prototype. In order to waive a great
&gt;&gt;&gt; deal of the development costs, it is a rational approach to use an
&gt;&gt;&gt; existing variation on existing products and markets. In space that
&gt;&gt;&gt; means building your prototype out of existing engines and tank
&gt;&gt;&gt; technology. Since demonstrably we do not yet have RLV technology, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; rational approach indicated that we should first attempt less
&gt;&gt;&gt; ambitious variations of existing ELV techniques, for instance,
&gt;&gt;&gt; recovery of the first stages, demonstration of cryogenic expendable
&gt;&gt;&gt; single stage to orbit, etc.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now lets get into details. Rocket stages are fragile. They break when
&gt;&gt;&gt; even just slightly dented.

&gt;&gt;    Other than perhaps Atlas, can you name some?

&gt;&gt;  &gt; Ok, let's forget stage recovery. What about

&gt;&gt;&gt; stage reuse in orbit? We already have a demonstrable upper stage
&gt;&gt;&gt; orbital debris problem, so let's focus on that. For instance, when
&gt;&gt;&gt; man rated EELVs dock with the space station, they already include the
&gt;&gt;&gt; upper stage as payload, particularly with high energy cryogenic upper
&gt;&gt;&gt; stages. Those stages often contain significant amounts of residual
&gt;&gt;&gt; fuel, oxygen and hydrogen which is easily converted to water.

&gt;&gt;     Scattered across various orbits, at various times. You want to
&gt;&gt; expend more propellant to gather it all to a useful location?

&gt; Well, orbital debris is such an extreme problem, much like global
&gt; warming, that changes in your lifestyle are not only required, but
&gt; demanded. We have a high inclination space station, and equatorial
&gt; orbit. I suggest these places be the starting point for all further deep
&gt; space and geosynchronous missions. Clearly the stopover at the ISS and
&gt; any equatorial fuel depot will require some extra fuel, but that is the
&gt; price you pay for being such stupid irrational fucks in the first place.

&gt;&gt;  &gt; Thus we have our oxygen to

&gt;&gt;&gt; breathe, hydrogen for propellant, and water to drink and grow plants.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There then remains the engines, which clearly can be reused in any
&gt;&gt;&gt; ambitious deep space exploration program, and the hydrogen tank,
&gt;&gt;&gt; which is large enough in any case to be converted to habitat and
&gt;&gt;&gt; hotel rooms.

&gt;&gt;    Will your guests be launched on these expendables?

&gt; They aren't expendables, they are reusables. Everything is reused.
">

Don't confuse re-using with re-manufacturing. If I can't refuel it
(remating a two-stage system, if I must go that route) and go again in a
reasonable turnaround time, that's not re-useable. Trying to use scrap
for something else may be recycling, but it's another issue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No, the guests will fly on EELVs in the beginning, until an engine is
&gt; developed with deep throttling capabilities, or launch vehicles large
&gt; enough for clusters of seven engines, in which case they can be
&gt; sequentially cut off, to reduce maximum gee forces at the top.

&gt;&gt;    Similar things were proposed for the shuttle ET, but it didn't
&gt;&gt; consider how fast any possible market would be saturated. Or wht would
&gt;&gt; happen when the next vehicle eventually came along that didn't use a
&gt;&gt; big ET. (And not all your upper stages are a useful volume, either)

&gt; Cryogenic upper stages are, all other fuels are pathological.

I'm okay with cryo upper stages, but not all applications can use
them efficently. (such as any need to light-up again a signifigant
later, without boil-off concerns).

And not all cryo upper stages give you any kind of useful volume.
Centaur being the best example.

You have not answered the question. Why do you assert that 'single
stage to orbit is basically a glorified upper stage?' BEcause of
propellants? Not all upper stages *or* ssto proposals use H2/O2.

Because of their mass fraction? Upper stages, by definition, are
already at a signifigant speed and altutude before operation. They
aren't as constrained by dry structural weight as SSTO.
