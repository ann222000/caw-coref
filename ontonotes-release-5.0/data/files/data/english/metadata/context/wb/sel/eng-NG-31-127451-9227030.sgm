The difference, my friend, is that you are here in alt.religion.mormon
attacking me and my faith. I am not in alt.johnp.personal.pet.interest
attacking you and yours.

I don't care what you think about Mormons or Mormonism. It's entirely your
privelege to think, feel and believe as you wish--and if you were NOT here
in a Mormon newsgroup and haranging people about it, then I wouldn't give a
hoot, or even know, about your own bigotry and intolerance. Wouldn't even be
a blip on my radar. But you are here, proudly proclaiming it.

Now, true bigotry would be me telling you that you have no right to think or
feel as you want to, or that you have no right to be in ARM, and no right to
behave as you wish to. However, I've never done that. You have every right
to come here, every right to say what you like. G'head.

But it isn't bigotry to disagree with you. It isn't bigotry to defend my
beliefs against your attacks upon it.

It is interesting to note, however, that you seem to think that simple
disagreement constitutes bigotry. Think a great deal of yourself, don't you?

I view the &quot;anti-mormons&quot; on this group as helping to prevent some poor
sap who visits this site from making what they see as a stupid decision.
I seriously doubt that any of them are here to &quot;help&quot; you, Diana, or your

the need to attack some poor sap for his/her interest in pets, or
correcting their grammer/spelling and attacking their character, I think
it's your DUTY to do just that! No harm done, eh? You obviously aren't

LDS Christians believe the *Light of Christ* flows to ALL mankind,
most of whom never recognize it as such in this life. The Lord has
revealed that there are differences between the Gift of the Holy Ghost
and the Light of Christ. Nevertheless, &quot;as I live, saith the Lord,
*every* knee shall bow to me, and *every* tongue shall confess to God.
So then *every one of us* shall give account of himself to God.&quot; But I
digress...

Following the Lord in righteousness and truth unerringly leads to
greater fellowship with His spirit, with faith in Him being the first
prerequisite in this divinely-authored, universal process. Most LDS
Christians believe repentance, baptism, and following Christ to the
end also are Biblically-based requisite parts of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ. At the end of the day, only God dictates the terms for any
actual &quot;fellowship&quot; with any portion of His spirit, regardless of what
we say...

Jesus Christ personally appeared to Joseph Smith and others. By divine
commission, they legitimately &quot;inherited&quot; from Him the knowledge,
rights, and commandments to receive full fellowship with the Holy
Ghost. LDS Christianity today strives to extend this legacy for all
who are willing to receive it.

Diana and I already recognize the sacred reality of Joseph Smith's
prophetic call and embrace the full divinity of Jesus Christ and our
spiritual dependence upon Him. I believe we both have experienced His
exquisite love and forgiveness in our lives. With gratitude and
humility, I believe we both acknowledge--though do not understand--His
hand in every aspect of existence.

For me, after many years of full participation in life, if something
&quot;builds faith&quot; in Jesus Christ and leads to actual fellowship with the
Holy Ghost, you can be pretty certain of its source. If it ultimately
leads to enmity and evil, that also is a tell-tale sign of its
source...

&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; hoot, or even know, about your own bigotry and intolerance. Wouldn't even
&gt;&gt; be
&gt;&gt; a blip on my radar. But you are here, proudly proclaiming it.

&gt;&gt; Now, true bigotry would be me telling you that you have no right to think
&gt;&gt; or
&gt;&gt; feel as you want to, or that you have no right to be in ARM, and no right
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; behave as you wish to. However, I've never done that. You have every
&gt;&gt; right
&gt;&gt; to come here, every right to say what you like. G'head.

&gt;&gt; But it isn't bigotry to disagree with you. It isn't bigotry to defend my
&gt;&gt; beliefs against your attacks upon it.

&gt;&gt; It is interesting to note, however, that you seem to think that simple
&gt;&gt; disagreement constitutes bigotry. Think a great deal of yourself, don't
&gt;&gt; you?

&gt; My belief is that mormonism sucks.   alt.religion.mormon isn't just a
&gt; place for TBMs.  This non-believing mormon wants to share his belief
&gt; in the slimy mormon religion.

Another who didn't read what I actually wrote.

ARM was not begun by and for Mormons. It was actually begun by a couple of
ANTI-Mormons (with the help of a couple of Mormons) for the express purpose
of discussing Mormonism and getting those posts out of
alt.religion.christian.

You will notice that I made it very clear that john p. has every right to
come in here and say whatever he wants to say about Mormons and Mormonism.
The problem is, he seems to think that my disagreeing with his opinion of my
religion constitutes bigotry against him.

My point is that HE is the one who is acting in a bigotted manner, not me.
I'm not attacking his religion or his pet hobby horses, after all. HE is
here.

He is also in alt.religion.mormon.fellowship, which WAS organized in the
hope that Mormons could go there and be relatively free of egregious and
nasty attacks. After all, there is ARM for that. However, ARMF is, I
believe, even worse than ARM for anti-Mormon stuff.

In effect, john p is accusing me of bigotry because I disagree with his
opinions of my beliefs--as if, to be aquitted of being a bigot, I have to
agree with him in everything he says.

Well, if that's his definition of bigotry, why doesn't he identify himself
as one because he disagrees with me?

&gt;&gt;On the other hand, increasing millions discover great personal joy and

&gt; Actually, the Holy Ghost is open to ALL who receive Jesus Christ
&gt; through faith.  No &quot;requisite terms or conditions of [smith's made-up]
&gt; gospel&quot; are required.

&gt; Even GREATER &quot;great personal joy and peace&quot; (along with the REST of
&gt; the Fruit of the Spirit&quot; come with receiving the REAL Jesus Christ

&gt;&gt;Of course, from the beginning of time, the spiritual &quot;DNA&quot; of anti-

&gt; Including the &quot;spiritual 'dna'&quot; of joseph smith and his followers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do believe you have hit it, john; in my experience, that IS the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; definition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of 'bigot' to liberals. A bigot, to you and yours, is someone who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disagrees
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with your personal bigotry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I knew you would chime in on this one.  I don't like mormonism and
&gt;&gt;&gt; think it is a bad thing.  You don't like my dislike of mormonism.  Is
&gt;&gt;&gt; there a difference?

&gt;&gt;The difference, my friend, is that you are here in alt.religion.mormon
&gt;&gt;attacking me and my faith. I am not in alt.johnp.personal.pet.interest
&gt;&gt;attacking you and yours.

&gt; Which is PART of what alt.religion.anything is about.  Attacking false
&gt; religions/defending true religions.  ALT groups are unmoderated and
&gt; open to anyone for any purpose.  If you don't like it here, go to a
&gt; moderated group.
">

Oh, my friend, I didn't tell john he couldn't come here. I simply pointed
out that he IS here. His choice, and his right. However, one can come to
certain conclusions about your presence here, both his and yours.

One of them is that of the two sides, those who are LDS and defend their
faith in alt.religion.mormon, and those who come here with the express
purpose of attacking it, the bigots are found on the attacking side, not the
defending side. john p seems to think that simply disagreeing with your
attacks and opinions is bigotry.

Sweetie, you are in alt.religion.mormon. I'm not in alt.religion.whatever

OK...but john p seems to think the opposite of this. Weren't you paying
attention? HE is the one who thinks that simply disagreeing with him is
bigotry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So which is bigotry and which is defense of the faith?  Us defending

Neither one, sweets. Bigotry is where you act in a manner that makes it
difficult, or impossible, for another to worship, or if you discriminate
against someone because of some aspect of another person's belief, culture
or ethnicity.

Personally, I would call picketing outside Temple Square bigotry. I would
call unwarrented insults bigotry. I would call painting swastikas and
'tagging' the inside of the churches bigotry. Lots of bigotry around.
Debating isn't, generally, a sign of it.

But you are acting here as if I had called YOU a bigot. I haven't, y'know.
Shoot, I haven't even called john p one, though I have some suspicions that
you both may well be bigots. However, if you are, your simple presence here
isn't proof of that. The problem here is that JOHN P is accusing ME of being
a bigot. Why?
Because I disagree with his opinion about Mormons and Mormonism.

What IS it with teenagers and some truly stupid people, who seem to think
that spewing incredible insults is just fine as long as you put a &quot;&lt;G&gt;&quot; or a

We Christians believe that the Holy Spirit lives within EVERY

Rom 8:9
9 But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit
of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of
Christ, he is not His.

smith's works to &quot;explain&quot; or add to it.  He was a convert, she a

I believe I figured it out.

If I had, I think you would have attempted to correct the error. You didn't.
Therefore, I guess I was correct about the point of your post; that is, if
someone actually disagrees with your opinion about the Mormons, then they
are being bigots.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If it's such a &quot;stupid decision,&quot; not sure why anyone would even care
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;about &quot;poor saps&quot;...?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;On the other hand, increasing millions discover great personal joy and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;peace after their decision to follow Jesus Christ in righteousness and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;truth. Without fail, the Holy Ghost is open to *all* who accept the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;requisite terms and conditions of the Gospel of Jesus Christ...

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, the Holy Ghost is open to ALL who receive Jesus Christ
&gt;&gt;&gt; through faith.  No &quot;requisite terms or conditions of [smith's made-up]
&gt;&gt;&gt; gospel&quot; are required.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even GREATER &quot;great personal joy and peace&quot; (along with the REST of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the Fruit of the Spirit&quot; come with receiving the REAL Jesus Christ
&gt;&gt;&gt; instead of joseph smith's &quot;made-up&quot; one.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I seriously doubt that any of them are here to &quot;help&quot; you, Diana, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kind.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Of course, from the beginning of time, the spiritual &quot;DNA&quot; of anti-
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Christs of all stripe seeks to undermine and destroy faith in Jesus
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Christ and the virtue linked to it :-(

&gt;&gt;&gt; Including the &quot;spiritual 'dna'&quot; of joseph smith and his followers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They probably see you as lame and completely lost.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We Christians DO indeed see mormons as completely lost, and many of us
&gt;&gt;&gt; see di as 'lame' as well.

&gt;&gt;(snort...) And *I&quot;M* the bigot?????

&gt; You are indeed _a_ bigot di.
">

I am? Why?

I am quite aware of the definition of the word, and quite frankly, checker,
I utterly fail to see where I fall under any of the paramenters of it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;You should look the word up sometime.
&gt; We Christians (including Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and
&gt; virtually ALL Christians from ALL Christian groups) DO indeed see
&gt; mormons as completely lost.  And those of us who know YOU di?  We see
&gt; you as pretty lame as well.
">

You've said that already.

Now consider; we Mormons don't think YOU folks are going to hell and will
burn forever....but you think that of us. We are not going to your
newsgroups and attacking your beliefs and calling you names there. You are
here, being insulting to us. We aren't picketing and vandalizing YOUR
meeting houses. We aren't blocking the entrances to YOUR places of worship.
We don't have websites up that warn people about YOUR beliefs.

That...would be you.

And you think I am the bigot. You don't really know the meaning of that
word, do you, sir?

Let's see: according to dictionary.com, a bigot is:

&quot;a person who is utterly intolerant of any differing creed, belief, or
opinion.&quot;

&quot;One who is strongly partial to one's own group, religion, race, or
politics and is intolerant of those who differ.&quot;

&quot;a prejudiced person who is intolerant of any opinions differing from his
own &quot;

The other definitions seem to apply mostly to computer applications.

Again, I'm not going after you in newsgroups devoted to the discussion of
whatever subset of Christianity YOU adhere to. I'm not criticising YOUR
beliefs. I am not telling you that you are going to hell. I am simply
defending my beliefs against YOUR bigoted attacks. You are here. You are
attacking. That I defend does not make me intollerant of your beliefs. It
simply proves that you are intollerant of mine. Go away and live your lives,
worship as you please, post in other newsgroups about your beliefs, and you
aren't going to see me giving you a hard time.

You. are. here.

That makes you the bigot.

&gt;&gt; &gt; it's your DUTY to do just that! No harm done, eh? You obviously aren't
&gt;&gt; &gt; trying to win anybody over to mormonism &lt;g&gt;

&gt;&gt; &gt; Have a great weekend!

&gt;&gt; Another who didn't read what I actually wrote.

&gt;&gt; ARM was not begun by and for Mormons. It was actually begun by a couple
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; ANTI-Mormons (with the help of a couple of Mormons) for the express
&gt;&gt; purpose
&gt;&gt; of discussing Mormonism and getting those posts out of
&gt;&gt; alt.religion.christian.

&gt;&gt; You will notice that I made it very clear that john p. has every right to
&gt;&gt; come in here and say whatever he wants to say about Mormons and
&gt;&gt; Mormonism.
&gt;&gt; The problem is, he seems to think that my disagreeing with his opinion of
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt; religion constitutes bigotry against him.

&gt;&gt; My point is that HE is the one who is acting in a bigotted manner, not
&gt;&gt; me.
&gt;&gt; I'm not attacking his religion or his pet hobby horses, after all. HE is
&gt;&gt; here.

&gt;&gt; He is also in alt.religion.mormon.fellowship, which WAS organized in the
&gt;&gt; hope that Mormons could go there and be relatively free of egregious and
&gt;&gt; nasty attacks. After all, there is ARM for that. However, ARMF is, I
&gt;&gt; believe, even worse than ARM for anti-Mormon stuff.

&gt;&gt; In effect, john p is accusing me of bigotry because I disagree with his
&gt;&gt; opinions of my beliefs--as if, to be aquitted of being a bigot, I have to
&gt;&gt; agree with him in everything he says.

&gt;&gt; Well, if that's his definition of bigotry, why doesn't he identify
&gt;&gt; himself
&gt;&gt; as one because he disagrees with me?

&gt; Diana, if you think that is what I was saying, then you are the one
&gt; with a comprehension problem.
">

That IS what you were saying. However, if I am incorrect, feel free to tell
me what you really were saying.

G'head. Dig yourself out of this one.

Your op said. &quot;Are you a bigot if you don't support my belief to hate your
mormonism.&quot;

I responded that in my experience, a liberal thinks that bigotry is just
that; someone who disagrees with  your own personal bigotry.

After all, you just admitted that you are bigotted against Mormons...

I dislike your opinion of Mormons. You simply dislike Mormons. There is a
huge difference, to answer the question you asked.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Are you a bigot if you don't support my belief to hate your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; mormonism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do believe you have hit it, john; in my experience, that IS the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; definition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of 'bigot' to liberals. A bigot, to you and yours, is someone who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disagrees
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with your personal bigotry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I knew you would chime in on this one.  I don't like mormonism and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think it is a bad thing.  You don't like my dislike of mormonism.  Is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there a difference?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The difference, my friend, is that you are here in alt.religion.mormon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;attacking me and my faith. I am not in alt.johnp.personal.pet.interest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;attacking you and yours.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Which is PART of what alt.religion.anything is about.  Attacking false
&gt;&gt;&gt; religions/defending true religions.  ALT groups are unmoderated and
&gt;&gt;&gt; open to anyone for any purpose.  If you don't like it here, go to a
&gt;&gt;&gt; moderated group.

&gt;&gt;Oh, my friend, I didn't tell john he couldn't come here. I simply pointed
&gt;&gt;out that he IS here. His choice, and his right. However, one can come to
&gt;&gt;certain conclusions about your presence here, both his and yours.

&gt;&gt;One of them is that of the two sides, those who are LDS and defend their
&gt;&gt;faith in alt.religion.mormon, and those who come here with the express
&gt;&gt;purpose of attacking it,

&gt; Because it is a false religion, of course.
">

I see. So it is permissable to be a bigot as long as you honestly believe
that you are right and the other guy is wrong?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;the bigots are found on the attacking side, not the
&gt;&gt;defending side. john p seems to think that simply disagreeing with your
&gt;&gt;attacks and opinions is bigotry.

&gt; Bigot -A prejudiced person who is intolerant of any opinions differing
&gt; from his own.

Indeed, isn't that precisely what you are?  Remember, you are HERE. I'm not
in alt.religion.whatever checker believes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yep, there are bigots on both sides, including YOU, di.

You are HERE. I'm not in alt.religion.checker's church.

Having you call me a bigot is rather like the kid barging into the synagogue
with a spray can, calling the worshipers there bigots because they object to
his spraying swastikas on the benches.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As is someone who disagrees with YOUR personal bigotry, huh?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Checker :-)

&gt;&gt;Strike a nerve, did I?

&gt;&gt;The thing is, Checker, I haven't called anybody a bigot. I have simply
&gt;&gt;told
&gt;&gt;the truth about what john p consideres a bigot to be, and exposed his
&gt;&gt;silliness.

&gt;&gt;....you are exposing yours without my help.

&gt; You have accused me of bigotry many times in the past, di.  And only
&gt; because I disagreed with YOUR bigotry.

&gt; Perhaps you don't know the meaning of the word:

&gt; Bigot - A prejudiced person who is intolerant of any opinions
&gt; differing from his own.
">

You are here, attacking my beliefs. I am not in alt.religion.checker's
church.

That, all by itself, is proof that you are the one who is intolerant. I am
not picketing your meetinghouses. I am not putting up anti-checker's church
websites.

Having you call me a bigot is like the tagger calling the homeowner a bigot
because he objects to having gang signs painted on his fence.

&gt; &quot;Are you a bigot if you don't support my belief to hate your mormonism.&quot;

&gt; If your point was that no, you aren't...then the question as was posed was

That is because your religion doesn't teach that people who don't
believe the God of the Bible are going to hell; according to smith's
teachings they will only go to the &quot;telestial&quot; kingdom (a word he made
up, of course), a lower level of heaven.

But according to the Bible, non-Christians (and that would include
those following false christs) DO go to hell.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;defending my beliefs against YOUR bigoted attacks.

Jesus and the Apostles hung around places where heretics were and
attacked their false beliefs too.  So I suppose you consider Jesus and
the Apostles to be &quot;bigots&quot; too, huh?

Your mormon missionaries come to our doors and claim our leaders teach
false doctrines and don't have the power of God every day.  I guess
that makes your missionaries bigots too.

Attacking false prophets and false doctrines is not bigotry, di.  It
is DOING WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO DO ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE.

&gt;You are here. You are

So when I defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ, that makes me a bigot,
but when you think you are doing that, it does not make you a bigot.
So it is supposed to be okay for your missionaries to come to our
doors and attack our faith, but it is not okay for us to come here and
point out the falsehoods of yours. . .that is bigotry?

You have a nice double-standard, di.  But it doesn't work.  We can all
see it clearly for what it is.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Are you a bigot if you don't support my belief to hate your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; mormonism.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I do believe you have hit it, john; in my experience, that IS the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; definition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of 'bigot' to liberals. A bigot, to you and yours, is someone who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; disagrees
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with your personal bigotry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I knew you would chime in on this one.  I don't like mormonism and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; think it is a bad thing.  You don't like my dislike of mormonism.  Is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there a difference?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The difference, my friend, is that you are here in alt.religion.mormon
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;attacking me and my faith. I am not in alt.johnp.personal.pet.interest
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;attacking you and yours.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which is PART of what alt.religion.anything is about.  Attacking false
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; religions/defending true religions.  ALT groups are unmoderated and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; open to anyone for any purpose.  If you don't like it here, go to a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; moderated group.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh, my friend, I didn't tell john he couldn't come here. I simply pointed
&gt;&gt;&gt;out that he IS here. His choice, and his right. However, one can come to
&gt;&gt;&gt;certain conclusions about your presence here, both his and yours.

&gt;&gt;&gt;One of them is that of the two sides, those who are LDS and defend their
&gt;&gt;&gt;faith in alt.religion.mormon, and those who come here with the express
&gt;&gt;&gt;purpose of attacking it,

&gt;&gt; Because it is a false religion, of course.

&gt;I see. So it is permissable to be a bigot as long as you honestly believe
&gt;that you are right and the other guy is wrong?
">

Attacking false religions is not being a bigot di.  Your missionaries
attack our faith every day when they come knocking on our doors.  They
claim we are all in apostasy (part of the &quot;first discussion&quot; that the
missionaries are taught) and that all of our &quot;professors&quot; preach stuff
that is not from God and don't know the power of God.

So if it is a bigot for me to point out the falsehoods of joseph
smithe here, it is EVEN MORE BIGOTTED for your missionaries to come to
our doors with their false claims, denigrating what we believe and the
groups we worship with.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;the bigots are found on the attacking side, not the

attack your beliefs?   By that I mean that they are initiating an attack on
something YOU believe, not defending against an attack on his or hers.

I think, if I remember right, you might actually be able to find one, dating
back a year or two. I think that's pretty much it, though...compared to the
myriad of such posts from anti-Mormons in here within the last day or so.

I also notice that alt.religion.christian.baptist and alt.religion.christian
are just LOADED with posts FROM Baptists and others against other religions.
They are as likely to be lambasting the Jehovah's Witnesses and
Scientologists and (pick one) as not.

Yet you don't see the Mormons in here doing that.

checker, give it up. you definately do not walk the high road on this one.

....and to switch metaphors, I think it's time you stopped digging yourself

I'm not intolerant. Go believe whatever you like. Be whereever you like. Say
whatever you like. Do it here. Just don't expect me to agree with your
stated opinions.

Intolerance implies far more than disagreement, checker. It means
&quot;unwillingness to recognize and respect differences in opinions or beliefs.&quot;
&quot;unwillingness to let others thinks as they choose.&quot; &quot;is not toelrating
other people's views, beliefs, or way of life.&quot; &quot;An attitude of not
accepting or respecting different opinions, practices, or people.&quot;

Intolerance means that you do something about it. You attempt to force
others to leave their beliefs, way of life or culture and join yours...or in
extreme cases, it means that you simply force those people that you do not
tolerate to leave; either by removing them, or by killing them.

...and that would be you, checker. You and those with whom you agree picket.
We do not. You attack our beliefs. We do not attack yours. Never mind the
early history of the church (though it is interesting to note that the first
complaint the Baptists had about us was that we were out to free their
slaves...) Let's just talk about official Baptist publications about other
religions and beliefs vs. official LDS publications about Baptists.

Baptists:  From &quot;Bible Baptist Publications&quot;
http://www.biblebelievers.com/jmelton/order.html
The Bible Believer's Handbook of Heresies
666 - Mark of the Beast: It's Closer Than You Think!
The Plain Truth about the Baptist Brider Heresy
The Plain Truth about the Catholic Church Heresy
The Plain Truth about the Jehovah's Witnesses
The Plain Truth about the Lodge
The Plain Truth about Mormons
Santa Claus and Satan's Clause

That's just the obvious ones, that I gleaned from the titles. Let's see...
From elsewhere:
&quot;What is Mormonism? A Baptist answer&quot;
The DVD's distributed by Tri-Grace Ministries, a Baptist group, that were
hung on LDS doors and were specific attacks upon LDS faith.

Then of course there are the, quite literally, THOUSANDS of websites out
there devoted to Mormonism, attacking Mormonism.

....and the folks that picket Temple Square.

.........and I'm not even talking about the Dr. Walter Martin types.

Now let's see what the Church of Jesus Christ has published that attacks
Baptist beliefs...that is, that specifically set out to attack them.

hmmn.

Nuthin.

Wow.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Are you a bigot if you don't support my belief to hate your

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I do believe you have hit it, john; in my experience, that IS the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;definition
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of 'bigot' to liberals. A bigot, to you and yours, is someone who
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;disagrees
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with your personal bigotry.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As is someone who disagrees with YOUR personal bigotry, huh?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Checker :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Strike a nerve, did I?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The thing is, Checker, I haven't called anybody a bigot. I have simply
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;told
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the truth about what john p consideres a bigot to be, and exposed his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;silliness.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;....you are exposing yours without my help.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You have accused me of bigotry many times in the past, di.  And only
&gt;&gt;&gt; because I disagreed with YOUR bigotry.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps you don't know the meaning of the word:

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bigot - A prejudiced person who is intolerant of any opinions
&gt;&gt;&gt; differing from his own.

&gt;&gt;You are here, attacking my beliefs. I am not in alt.religion.checker's
&gt;&gt;church.

&gt; Mormons are in alt.religion.christian.baptist all the time.  BOTH
&gt; PLACES ARE OPEN FORUMS FOR ALL to discuss, both pro and con.

&gt; I am attacking a false religion.  Jesus did that a lot.  So did Paul.
&gt; You would likely call THEM bigots too, it appears.

&gt;&gt;That, all by itself, is proof that you are the one who is intolerant. I am
&gt;&gt;not picketing your meetinghouses. I am not putting up anti-checker's
&gt;&gt;church
&gt;&gt;websites.

&gt; This is not your meetinghouse.  It is an OPEN FORUM for anyone who
&gt; wishes to discuss EITHER PRO OR CON, mormonism.

Indeed. But the Mormons in ARCB are not there to attack you. If they are
there, it is because they have been brought there by an attack upon their
beliefs, and are defending.

You are not here defending your beliefs. You haven't BEEN attacked. You are
here attacking ours. Now, I have not said that you can't come here. In fact,
I'm the one who told YOU how this forum was started, by whom and what for.
Feel free. However, the fact that you may come here, and that I support your
right to do so, doesn't mean that your presence and purpose here are any
less the product of purest bigotry and intolerance, because they certainly
are that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually, the Holy Ghost is open to ALL who receive Jesus Christ
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through faith.  No &quot;requisite terms or conditions of [smith's made-up]

&gt;&gt;Have I even said that you don't have the right to come here and attack us?

&gt;&gt;Why...no. I haven't.

&gt; Nor have I said any such thing about you either, of course.
">

Excuse me, sir, you are calling ME a bigot for simply disagreeing with you.
I am calling you one because you actively act upon your prejudices by coming
in here and specifically attacking LDS beliefs. That's what bigots do.

You have every right to do so...but that doesn't make you any less the bigot
you are attempting to call me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;You, however, have done all those things.

&gt; Why do you LIE like that, di?  I have never once done EVEN ONE of
&gt; those things.  That simply makes you a liar!
">

Read on. You will see why I lump you in with those who do. You see, checker,
I saw a Mormon go into a usenet group (I WILL say that it was the first time
I had ever seen such a thing, and it shamed me right down to my toes) and
attack the beliefs of the religion the group was devoted to discussing.

Here's the difference between you and me; I publically told him to cut it
out; that we are not supposed to do that sort of thing. It's one thing to
defend against attacks. It is quite another to employ the tactics people
like you use.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Intolerance does NOT equal disagreement, checker, as much as you wish it
&gt;&gt;did. After all, if simple disagreement with a position was the same thing
&gt;&gt;as
&gt;&gt;intolerance of it, then you could make yourself feel much better about the
&gt;&gt;incredible intolerance you show us by your being here and attacking our
&gt;&gt;beliefs.

&gt; Disagreement by me does not make me intolerant, either.
">

You are quite right. It does not. Coming HERE and attacking us first does,
though. Coming here and claiming that we believe and do things we do not
believe and do most certainly is.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  I do agree
&gt; that I am &quot;narrow-minded&quot; in that I do not accept false prophets,
&gt; false christs, or false doctrines as coming from God.  Neither did
&gt; Jesus, Paul, or any of the others in that group.  You would call them
&gt; &quot;intolerant&quot; too, most likely.
">

You are comparing yourself to Jesus and the apostles?

Checker. It is one thing to refuse to accept another belief. It is even OK
to tell others what you think the truth is. I have no problem, for instance,
with those people who knock on my door and tell me what they believe. That's
a good thing.

It is quite another to do what you do; that is, attack the beliefs of others
without letting them know what you believe the truth actually is.

That's telling people that they have no right to their own beliefs--and no
right to yours, either. That's bigotry.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You should look the word up sometime.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We Christians (including Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; virtually ALL Christians from ALL Christian groups) DO indeed see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mormons as completely lost.  And those of us who know YOU di?  We see
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you as pretty lame as well.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You've said that already.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It bears repeating.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Now consider; we Mormons don't think YOU folks are going to hell and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;burn forever....but you think that of us.

&gt;&gt;&gt; For reasons that are SCRIPTURAL.

&gt;&gt;I see. it's ok for you to be intolerant because you think you are RIGHT.
&gt;&gt;hmmn.

&gt; No, it is okay for me to deny false prophets, false christs and false
&gt; doctrines because the BIBLE tells we should do it.  Whether you regard
&gt; us doing that to be &quot;intolerant&quot; or not has nothing to do with it.
">

No, dear. simple disagreement does not equal intolerance. But you are
attempting to have this both ways, aren't you? you call ME a bigot because I
disagree with your beliefs, but I can't call you one because you disagree
with mine?

Make up your mind.

The fact is, I am not calling you a bigot because you disagree with my
beliefs. Feel free. I am calling you an intolerant bigot because you are IN
HERE attacking my beliefs. You and I have had conversations before. You
throw insults like you had an inexaustable supply, and your excuse is that
you have the truth.

And you call ME a bigot because I disagree; I disagree because I believe I
have the truth.

And you honestly cannot see the irony.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We are not going to your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;newsgroups and attacking your beliefs and calling you names there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You are not?  Then why do I see mormons in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; alt.religion.christian.baptist group frequently?

&gt;&gt;Would you care to post some of the quotes from those frequent Mormons that
&gt;&gt;attack your beliefs?   By that I mean that they are initiating an attack
&gt;&gt;on
&gt;&gt;something YOU believe, not defending against an attack on his or hers.

&gt; A good place for you to look is art bulla's posts. . .aaron kim's
&gt; posts, etc.

I don't read either one. Their beliefs and mine are further apart than yours
and mine. I think you would be rather annoyed if I started yelling at you
for what some Catholic did, wouldn't you?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; And I try not to do name-calling.
">

You don't try very hard, checker. I will admit that your insults are more
basic; complete and utter disrespect for those things that others do
respect, and even hold sacred, for one thing.

Why on earth you would figure that behaving in that matter will do your
cause any good is beyond me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  I frequently call bad reasoning
&gt; &quot;stupid,&quot; and such but I try to refrain from calling PEOPLE names.
&gt; Except of course, calling false prophets what they really are, false
&gt; prophets.

Yes..as I mentioned last year at this time, you are here to cheer us on the
way to hell. And you never DID respond to that post.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I think, if I remember right, you might actually be able to find one,
&gt;&gt;dating
&gt;&gt;back a year or two. I think that's pretty much it, though...compared to
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;myriad of such posts from anti-Mormons in here within the last day or so.

&gt; You have a &quot;convenient&quot; memory that doesn't quite line up with
&gt; reality.

Feel free to give us some quotes, checker. In context, if you please.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;I also notice that alt.religion.christian.baptist and
&gt;&gt;alt.religion.christian
&gt;&gt;are just LOADED with posts FROM Baptists and others against other
&gt;&gt;religions.
&gt;&gt;They are as likely to be lambasting the Jehovah's Witnesses and
&gt;&gt;Scientologists and (pick one) as not.

&gt;&gt;Yet you don't see the Mormons in here doing that.

&gt; Mostly because the mormon religion would get quickly debunked and shot
&gt; down. . .
">

(snort) In other words, you don't see the Mormons in here doing that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;checker, give it up. you definately do not walk the high road on this one.

&gt; You are welcome to your erroneous opinion, of course.

'erroneous?&quot; Fine. Give us some quotes then. In context, if you please.
