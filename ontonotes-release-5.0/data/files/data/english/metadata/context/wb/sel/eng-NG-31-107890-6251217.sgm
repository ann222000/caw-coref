Just was thinking... on lots of 80's "boom boxes" there was a switch,
sometimes a 2 position type,    that  said "beat" on it.  I read an owners
book one time for one, it said something about "reducing the beat"  I wonder
was it a low freq.  compressor?   Anyone REALLY know for sure?

On my ghettoblaster, I have to switch it on to cancel a whine that
happens when you're recording from a radio station.  That's what the
instruction books recommend.

It also just happens to switch the FM from stereo to mono when I'm
listening to FM.

How it works, I don't know.  I think it had something to do with the
stereo pilot on FM getting picked up and amplified by the recording?

The beat cut switch changed the frequency of the bias oscillator on better
radio/recorders (the cheap ones didn't need it because they had DC record
bias), in case you had interference from the bias oscillator on the
particular AM station you were trying to record.

As for the FM mono thing, I'm not sure why that would make a difference,
unless you wanted to avoid as much noise as possible when recording a weak
FM station. The other thought was that perhaps the filtering of the 19KHz
pilot from the audio was not very good, and could beat with the bias
oscillator and cause some problems.. but normally switching to mono doesn't
remove the pilot, only disables the stereo detection.

Hi!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I've seen this switch on some units labeled as "beat cancel". Most seem to
have three positions, marked as A, B and C. I've used it sometimes on units
that had such a switch, but never needed its functionality on a unit that
didn't. I never found it to have an effect on FM, and when I did use it, I
wasn't making a tape recording.

A quick Google search turned this up:

"When recording from radio to cassette the frequency of the erase oscillator
can interfere with the radio section, causing 'beating' to occur in the
sound. Chan[g]ing the position of the switch changes to oscillator frequency
slightly, canceling the beat interference ."

Maybe that oscillator continues running or is used for other purposes in the
set?

The tape recorder uses a supersonic bias oscillator to overcome the
magnetic tape hystersis to record on the magnetic tape.  Odds are that
this supersonic frequency is 20 something KHz, which will heterodyne
(beat) with the stereo FM pilot and make that whine.  This indicates bad
system design of that ghettoblaster; they should have changed the bias
oscillator frequency to something much higher, like 100KHz.  )Or better
filter the left and right channels from the multiples detector...  Seems
that the manufacturer just threw together a bunch of function blocks and
didn't bother to test the design.

Ahhhh!! It's for AM.  OK. Now I remember why I'd have to engage it
when I'd be airchecking a radio station when I had this monstrosity at
home instead of work.

As far as FM.....well the FM stereo/mono and beat cancel functions are
both on the same switch.

Well, the 'Erase' oscillator is running when recording to erase the

It's a heterodyning filter that removes adjacent channel? harmonics
and such that BEAT against the tuned signal and cause products that
make it harder to read the signal. Ever use a BFO? Seems related in
that you suppress 1 (LSB) or 2 (USB) to limit QRM.

In 28 years of seeing them that's all they seem to be. They have
NOTHING to do with the tape recorder directly, they are a signal
processing feature for the AM tuning.

I guess I've lost track of one of the premises of the thread, but if you
are recording an FM station, it would be easy to turn off the
locally-generated 38 KC subcarrier that is used for stereo demodulation
and decoding. The effect would be to switch from stereo to mono
reception. Which kind of defeats the purpose of recording an FM station
- but I guess it is better than a 2 KHz whine in the audio.

The OP may have said that the beat switch is used when recording an AM
station - but then how would he know that FM has switched from stereo to
mono?

The function has no function on FM. The pilot is at 19 kc, hence the
38 kc figure wouldn't figure.

I would have thought that the amplitude of the bias oscillator would be
more important.  It shouldn't be that hard to experiment.  Substitute an
external sine wave generator and vary the frequency, and amplitude, and
if the machine has 3 heads (so you can listen to what was just recorded
onto the tape) you can tell what matters and what doesn't, or find new
valid settings if both parameters matter (maybe the higher bias
frequency needs higher amplitude?).

Sorry for the confusion.  Seems I have been causing a lot of that with the
computer lately.

I was referring to the recording bias frequency applied to excite the tape.
I spent some time in a local recording studio when I was a kid in the 70's.
Before laying down a recording on the 1/4 inch machine.  The technician
would send a tone (400 or 1000 Hz) to the deck and set the bias frequency
while monitoring the playback head on the VU meter. He set the frequency for
max output in the meter.

That is the frequency I was referring to.
