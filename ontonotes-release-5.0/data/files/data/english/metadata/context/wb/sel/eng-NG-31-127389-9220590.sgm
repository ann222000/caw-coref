Each religion or culture  it seems has a list of virtues...not bad at
all imo.  but without any disrespect i am saying, pedantic..

in this aspect.

There is a root to all error.  creating a root that eliminates the
destructive aspects of ones error.

The root of the error is thinking that one knows all...from his itty
bitty peep hole onto the universes and beyond... when in fact he is
virtually blind.     an inert root until he acts,   with arrogance.

the act of assuming one is right, then acting with force that disrupts
or damages others because of ones own imperfect view of the gestalt of
all there is.... is the root of all evil imo.

so that simply understanding this root of error, precludes it in
anyone sensible at that level.       a single virtue.

I knew someday I would go back to this, and it took me a few minutes to
find it, but I did.

From Will Durant's &quot;The Story of Civilization&quot; vol 4, the Age of Faith,
page 820:

&quot;Gregory I and later theologians spoke of seven deadly sins--pride,
avarice, envy, anger, lust, gluttony, and sloth; and opposed to them the
seven cardinal virtues: four 'natural' or pagan virtues praised by
Pythagoras and Plato--wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance; and three
'theological' virtues--faith, hope, and charity.&quot;

Gregory I lived 540?-604 AD, and was basically one of the great church
administrators of that era. Born in Rome.

And, I will recommend, again, for those of you who would like a small bit
of exposure to a small fraction of the written humanist intellectualizing
that the human race has done over the last few thousand years, this ten
volume set of books. I've seen the volumes as low as a buck each and far
more valuable for one's educational benefit and intellectual enlightenment
than any Nintendo, X-box, iJunk, or other throw-away crap, etc.

However, phil, you get an honorable mention for trying to google the &quot;six
virtues&quot;. I somehow did not remember that there were seven of both the
sins and the virtues, and that may have thrown off your google search.
However, it also points out how dumb computers are that they can't really
help you think. I could not remember the seven of each, but I did remember
approximately where I saw them discussed and book indexes are excellent,
thought not perfect, ways to get back to that page I remember seeing.

Its interesting that the way my brain works is that I can often remember
very well where on the page I saw something (top, middle, bottom) but much
less well the details.

Yes. Absolutely. Only cheaper, and what goes into the brain memory
actually stays there better. i.e. long decay half-life. Compared to any
alcohol in which almost all comes back out in 24 hours (short
decay-halflife). If beer, then what comes back out is the same color as
when it goes in: yellow.

It happens with coffee, too. Comes out later: yellow again.

Wifey got this digital timer/thermometer/thing for helping with the
turkey...what a joke. Can't tell by reading the instructions how it works.

Put into the turkey the old-fashioned thermometer with the mechanical
movement and dial scale. She got it at a yard sale for 50 cents before
we met (25+ years ago) and it looks like hell but it always works.

Looking back, i was world class at that... maybe in the present too
there is hope.   i will tell you an odd thing about that.

here is the odd thing.

scroll down

more

Ok.

here it is.

Our brains generate crud (amyloids, toxic as hell) in the process of
thinking and working the neurons.. also by other means. (prions in
cooked meats especially, and other fractions in processed foods)

these ....in ones youth as I see it, come out the skin on the nerve
channels and throught the ganglia. (micro brains distributed thoughout
the body. some down the spine the size of almonds...some microscopic)

however with age, like silicone seal solidifies in the cut tip of a
caulking tube.. those clog the pores and purge points.. mostly on the
head, eye mask areas, down the spine and at a group of 8 symetical
ports on the tail bone area... the crud then builds up in the brain
and elsewhare, where it wreaks total havoc, old age and eventually the
host of aging diseases including limp dick.... and lack of that lovin
feeling ensue.

a build up of inter and intracellular cluge in the skin and between
the skin and bone, felt as lumps or more accurately noticed when
eliminated...a return to the smooth skin of ones youth.. with that
comes a return of that lovin' feeling, and a place to hang your wash
cloth in the shower.

at that point, if you have also been feeling better and started
working out comes female interest... including babes in their 20's
sometimes,  the genuinely hip sorts...not the faux boob types....about
half intrigue, humor and general curiosity and traces of
interest.  ..

a lot of these fill out a pair of shorts in world class fashion...
never fail to address them on the issue...

I say..  'hello... Look, I just have to tell you that fill out that
pair of shorts in absolutely world class fashion'... thats always good
for a laugh.

one  owes this compliment you see. to those who contribute so much to
mankind.... especially the ones with 'budweiser' logo emblazoned
across their ass.  now these you see, appreciate the real thing.

I met my favorite girl friend of all time in Honollulu (born in south
dakota).. she was about 20 at the time... embarrassed that a pedi cab
driver had bitten her on the thigh one evening and she had a big
scar.. full set of teeth marks no less, so bad it never went away.

She was a waitress at the waikiki hilton.. everyone in sight just
loved the hell out of her..and all along the yacht harbor....

i was 41 at the time, we had become room mates,  and she told me why
she occasionally hauled my ass from my room to hers for the night...

i was 'real' she said....

no fraud you see...and that gets better with age ..

and then if you can learn about such as Ive mentioned, and work out so
you dont get all sick and emaciated looking..., and do not kiss ass on
a job site,  and fill out your levi's. well, and dont dress like a
doofus... well there is always some intrigue and life going on...

ive seen it in many others, even in old age.   this young lady had
some very young and very old friends.. one living in a 1920's wood
racing hull in honollulu harbor (masts, sails, paint, brass etc, long
since gone,) who used to feed her his special mix of cabage, coconut
and sardines cooked over a can of sterno sitting on the bilge boards,
with his cardboard bunk resting on what was left of the helm... he did
all the cooking and eating with a knife, from borneo I think..that

she loved him too.

its a justice thing in the final analysis, a respect for life..

.the only true gift it seems.

&gt; &gt; Don't tell that you are kidding about chasing women, too. It will

&gt; I'm still in my morning coffee phase, myself. El-cheapo Wartmal, plus
&gt; elcheapo and real fake cream, and real and expensive fake sugar.

&gt; Anyone reading the book &quot;oPtions&quot; by Fake Steve Jobs? I've read two book

try this.... double up on the instant coffee, two packages of hot
chocolate mix, some fake creamer, the rest cold milk.... better than
starbucks mocca.

tsk, tsk....

Just knocked off a piece of chocolate pecan pie. When my ass dies, I'm
gonna feel like I didn't deprive myself. Not too much, not too little.

We skimp on other things to remain streamlines in other ways.

Please say hello to your gulls. Breezes are nice, too. We get them here.
72 all day.

Phil, you should write all this stuff up into a book.

&gt;&gt; Don't tell that you are kidding about chasing women, too. It will
&gt;&gt; brake my hart.

&gt; Looking back, i was world class at that... maybe in the present too
&gt; there is hope.   i will tell you an odd thing about that.

&gt; here is the odd thing.

&gt; scroll down

&gt; more

&gt; more

&gt; Ok.

&gt; here it is.

&gt; Our brains generate crud (amyloids, toxic as hell) in the process of
&gt; thinking and working the neurons.. also by other means. (prions in
&gt; cooked meats especially, and other fractions in processed foods)

&gt;   these ....in ones youth as I see it, come out the skin on the nerve
&gt; channels and throught the ganglia. (micro brains distributed thoughout
&gt; the body. some down the spine the size of almonds...some microscopic)

&gt; however with age, like silicone seal solidifies in the cut tip of a
&gt; caulking tube.. those clog the pores and purge points.. mostly on the
&gt; head, eye mask areas, down the spine and at a group of 8 symetical
&gt; ports on the tail bone area... the crud then builds up in the brain
&gt; and elsewhare, where it wreaks total havoc, old age and eventually the
&gt; host of aging diseases including limp dick.... and lack of that lovin
&gt; feeling ensue.

&gt; a build up of inter and intracellular cluge in the skin and between
&gt; the skin and bone, felt as lumps or more accurately noticed when
&gt; eliminated...a return to the smooth skin of ones youth.. with that
&gt; comes a return of that lovin' feeling, and a place to hang your wash
&gt; cloth in the shower.

&gt; at that point, if you have also been feeling better and started
&gt; working out comes female interest... including babes in their 20's
&gt; sometimes,  the genuinely hip sorts...not the faux boob types....about
&gt; half intrigue, humor and general curiosity and traces of
&gt; interest.  ..

&gt; a lot of these fill out a pair of shorts in world class fashion...
&gt; never fail to address them on the issue...

&gt; I say..  'hello... Look, I just have to tell you that fill out that
&gt; pair of shorts in absolutely world class fashion'... thats always good
&gt; for a laugh.

&gt; one  owes this compliment you see. to those who contribute so much to
&gt; mankind.... especially the ones with 'budweiser' logo emblazoned
&gt; across their ass.  now these you see, appreciate the real thing.

&gt; I met my favorite girl friend of all time in Honollulu (born in south
&gt; dakota).. she was about 20 at the time... embarrassed that a pedi cab
&gt; driver had bitten her on the thigh one evening and she had a big
&gt; scar.. full set of teeth marks no less, so bad it never went away.

&gt; She was a waitress at the waikiki hilton.. everyone in sight just
&gt; loved the hell out of her..and all along the yacht harbor....

&gt; i was 41 at the time, we had become room mates,  and she told me why
&gt; she occasionally hauled my ass from my room to hers for the night...

&gt; i was 'real' she said....

&gt; no fraud you see...and that gets better with age ..

&gt; and then if you can learn about such as Ive mentioned, and work out so
&gt; you dont get all sick and emaciated looking..., and do not kiss ass on
&gt; a job site,  and fill out your levi's. well, and dont dress like a
&gt; doofus... well there is always some intrigue and life going on...

&gt; ive seen it in many others, even in old age.   this young lady had
&gt; some very young and very old friends.. one living in a 1920's wood
&gt; racing hull in honollulu harbor (masts, sails, paint, brass etc, long
&gt; since gone,) who used to feed her his special mix of cabage, coconut
&gt; and sardines cooked over a can of sterno sitting on the bilge boards,
&gt; with his cardboard bunk resting on what was left of the helm... he did
&gt; all the cooking and eating with a knife, from borneo I think..that

&gt; she loved him too.

&gt; its a justice thing in the final analysis, a respect for life..

&gt; .the only true gift it seems.

Nah.... I prefer the &quot;disheveled&quot; proletariat coffee. It fits my &quot;class.&quot;

Or...maybe I should say: I know my place. It mixes very well with my
swashbuckling personality.
