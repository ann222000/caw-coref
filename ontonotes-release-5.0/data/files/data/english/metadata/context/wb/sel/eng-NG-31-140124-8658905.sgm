By LOWELL COHN, PRESS DEMOCRAT COLUMNIST

ALAMEDA - Lane Kiffin, the frat boy who coaches the Oakland Raiders,
walked off the practice field early Wednesday afternoon.

He has yet to coach his first real game in the National Football League,
but he has it all figured out. He came over to the media to disseminate
the usual non-information he already has grown famous for. The frat boy
is a specialist at not telling.

Many reporters awaited him, awaited his words. They wanted to know the
starting quarterback for Sunday's season opener against the Detroit
Lions, hardly an imposing bunch. Last season, the Lions were almost --
not quite -- at the Raiders' level of incompetence. The kid coach gave a
canned little speechlet on how practice went well and blah blah. No one
cared.

Naturally, someone asked who the quarterback will be. It's the key question.

&quot;I have no information for you on that,&quot; the neophyte coach shot back.

&quot;Why is that?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Because I don't want to tell you,&quot; the student coach said.

&quot;Is there a reason?&quot; I persisted.

&quot;You can figure that part out,&quot; the trainee said.

&quot;I can't figure it out,&quot; I said.

&quot;You can't? All right, ask someone else,&quot; the novice told me.

&quot;I'm asking you,&quot; I said.

&quot;Next question,&quot; he said.

When he said next question, he was giving me the kiss-off. But, that's
all right. I've been kissed off by more famous men than Kiffin.

As long as he asked, I have a next question. What state secret does
young Kiffin think he's hiding with this quarterback fiasco?

The Lions had Josh McCown last year and know everything about him.
Detroit coach Rod Marinelli has coached against Daunte Culpepper about a
million times. There are no secrets. There is no benefit in acting this
juvenile way.

While we're on the subject of starting quarterbacks, let's get real. The
Raiders will start McCown on Sunday. Got that? McCown. How do I know?
Because in practice he works with the first team. So that blows Kiffin's
cover. What did the child prodigy expect was going to happen, a total
news blackout?

He coaches the Raiders like he's Nikita Khrushchev and this is still the
Cold War. He coaches in the Al Davis total paranoia mode. At least
Khrushchev had real secrets to conceal. The Boy Wonder has nothing of
importance. He's simply acting the way he thinks a coach should act,
although no mature coach ever would act that way.

I suppose, in his inexperienced mind, Kiffin decided not to reveal his
quarterback because he thinks secrecy gives him a competitive advantage.
He's never been a head coach before and he doesn't know any better. He's
already told the two quarterbacks who is starting and he's told the
entire team, and by now so many people know the truth you could fill
Madison Square Garden with all of them.

I have other questions. Why are the Raiders always their own worst
enemy? Why do the Raiders go out of their way to tick people off? Given
a choice, why do the Raiders always pick the stupid alternative? I mean,
what's the big deal? It's not like they're playing New England. They're
playing the terrible Lions, for heaven's sake.

Kiffin also isn't revealing the starting center, and he's not saying
where the Raiders are in negotiations with JaMarcus Russell -- another
fiasco. And he won't say if the game will be televised.

So I ask you, what exactly does this guy tell?

I previously have written I had lunch with Bill Walsh in late January
along with Ira Miller. But I haven't told you this. During the lunch,
Walsh said Davis had phoned him, wanted Walsh to give Kiffin tips on
being a head coach. Bill looked at us with his wicked little grin. &quot;I
told Al I'll talk to him,&quot; he said, &quot;but I don't know if you can teach
someone to be a head coach.&quot;

On the drive home, I said to Ira: &quot;Did I hear correctly? Did Bill really
say Al wants him to give Kiffin coaching tips?&quot;

&quot;You heard right,&quot; Ira said.

Walsh visited the Raiders' training facility a month before he died. He
observed practice and had lunch with Kiffin. I don't know what he told
the apprentice coach, but I know Walsh was the ultimate diplomat, always
got along with people. I hope he said: &quot;Listen, kid, never pick a
childish fight. And for goodness sake, please grow up.&quot;

Somebody tell me what competitive advantage football teams gain by publishing
their player strategies and injury reports.

My take is it only benefits the gamblers and physically hurts the players
when their announced injuries are targeted.

Hockey's in sad shape, but at least they have the smarts not to tell the
opponent which knee is weak on their star players.

Yeah, okay, so I am the troll here, alright....TAKE YOUR DAMN MEDS BILL!!!

By the way, just because I post it does not mean that I agree with the
article.

I do agree that Lowell Cohn is a scrub but in the long run it is quite
funny, a reporter got his feelings hurt by that bad boy coach Lane Kiffin.
