Old News. Quoting the Press Association this morning quoting pTerry:

&quot;I had a stroke some time over the last two years. I don't even know when it
was. I can't tie a necktie any more but, on the other hand, I can remember
the whole of a Kleenex tissue advert from 1962. I haven't a clue why&quot; -

In the radio interview Len Oil linked to a couple of days ago,
Pterry mentioned he'd had a mild stroke recently[1], but
wasn't even sure *when* he'd had it, and the only effect seems
to be that he can no longer tie a tie.

[1] I'm not sure how recently &quot;recently&quot; is; the impression I
got was that it was back a couple of years when he announced
that health problems meant he was cutting back to one book a
year, but ICBW.

It is old news.
Last Weekend he did a book signing in Plymouth and according to my son
he was in good health.  Interestingly although the signing started at
12 (may have been one or later) my son happened to go by about an hour
and a half before and noticed the massive queue and joined it then.
When he eventually left over two hours later he checked again and the
queue was the same length.  This is with the signing only being
advertised by two small posters upstairs in the book shop.  He
wondered why the signing of a book about Plymouth Argyle got several
much larger posters in the window.  I suggested that even if TP's
event had been advertised by a hand written note hidden under a till,
it would still have been packed whereas the other event may have
trouble getting much of a queue even with the adverts!  I do feel pity
when you see authors at tables already to go but no body ready to
come.

One possible explanation is that, at least subconsciously, he likes Kleenex
adverts but is not overly fond of neckties. In any case, it probably means
that the person responsible for the advertisement should get an OBE for
services to memorable marketing campaigns (along with whoever came up with
&quot;Lip­smackin­thirst­quenchin­acetastin­motivatin­good­buzzin­cool­talkin­

On a related note, I had a somewhat similar experience recently while

To help those unfamiliar with Terry's work to get into the right frame of

night when she mentioned that she would quite like to meet Terry a supposed
fan in the audience cried out that she was too late as Terry had died in a
car accident last year. I was behind the curtain at the time and could not
let that pass which led to an amusing little discussion between myself and
Footnote about how I had seen Terry at the convention a few months before
and that he was in fact quite healthy.
Quite how these rumours start is beyond me.

OTOH someone on LiveJournal reports that the Nottingham signing has been
cancelled due to ill health.

http://community.livejournal.com/discworld/773287.html

One of the comments says that his voice was going when he was signing in
Pennsylvania. I hope he'll feel better soon.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; did say:

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I hae just heard that pTerry has had a stroke, but I can't seem to
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; find confirmation or denial of this.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Is there any news?  Is pTerry OK?

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In the radio interview Len Oil linked to a couple of days ago, Pterry
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mentioned he'd had a mild stroke recently[1], but wasn't even sure
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; *when* he'd had it, and the only effect seems to be that he can no
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; longer tie a tie.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; [1] I'm not sure how recently &quot;recently&quot; is; the impression I got was
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that it was back a couple of years when he announced that health
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; problems meant he was cutting back to one book a year, but ICBW.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; On a related note, I had a somewhat similar experience recently while
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; directing a stage production of Jingo.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   To help those unfamiliar with Terry's work to get into the right
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   frame of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind I had our Footnote do a short rundown before the curtain opened.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One night when she mentioned that she would quite like to meet Terry a
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; supposed fan in the audience cried out that she was too late as Terry
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; had died in a car accident last year. I was behind the curtain at the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; time and could not let that pass which led to an amusing little
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; discussion between myself and Footnote about how I had seen Terry at
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the convention a few months before and that he was in fact quite
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; healthy.
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Quite how these rumours start is beyond me.

So it would seem.  Somebody must have thought it sounded better than

I, too, am very glad that the rumours were false.

My source: A friend is on tour, currently in the UK (or probably
boarding/on-board a plane home around now).  He sent me an
SMS saying he'd heard that Terry had had a stroke and to try to
find out details.  (Also that he'd just passed the JCB factory.)

The answer to the rumour is &quot;yes, but it was yonks ago and
fortunately not fatal.&quot;

Don't give up hope. He sometimes visits places between the major

exactly a major metropolis, but he stopped there while in transit

I turned up at the same time as he did, and it was a strange feeling

He was at Cambridge UK signing books this afternoon.  He seemed in
good health and signed a couple of books for me.  The queue went
around the bookshop twice, but he did say on arrival that he would
sign a book for everyone in the queue.  Some people had their entire
liberary for him to sign which I thought a bit much.  At 4pm he did
stop signing paperbacks to ensure that the rest of the queue got
through before 5pm.

Madison, CT has the distinction of being (unless I'm mistaken), per median
household income, the highest ranked town ($103,822) in the highest ranked
state ($61,879) in the highest ranked country ($46,242) in the world.
The population is 91.4% white, compared to 71.2% statewide.

In other words, not just one of many random small towns, but Snobtown.
