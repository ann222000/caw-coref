Thinking about Snape´s role in Harry Potter and especially in DH there
still appear quite a few questions:

1) How did Snape get the sword he placed in that pond in the forest
for Harry. Only a Gryffindor can take it!

2) The Potions book in HBP: who wrote all these remarks in there and
why didn´t anyone know the countercurse to Sectumsempra. According to
DH Snape used it more than once - DD must have known. Latest after
Harry´s attack on Draco in Myrtle´s bathroom! Why didn´t he tell
anyone from the order the countercurse. George would have been quite
happy about it...

3)Why did Snape tell LV the exact time when the order wanted to leave
Privet drive? He risked Harry´s life and all others lives by that.

4) Mundungus was loyal to DD. Snape killed DD ( at least that is what
Mundungus must have thought). Why did he tell Snape about the date? He
had the &quot;idea&quot; of taking several Harrys. Why does he pass on his own
idea how to get Harry out. If Mundungus had trustfull contact to
Snape, why that game? Or did I miss something or get it wrong?

That appears to only be true in certain circumstances (eg fetching it
from the hat).  The snatchers had no trouble taking it from Harry, Ron,
and Hermione's tent after all.  Likewise Snape merely had to open a
hidden compartment and lift it out -- although DD does cryptically
mention that perhaps Snape should have been in Gryffindor after all (the
&quot;sort too soon&quot; remark).

There is a bigger issue with the Potions book that looks like a dropped
plot-line.  In HBP we are told the book is at least fifty years old and
much too old to have been James's or Lily's.  Snape was their
contemporary.  There must therefore have been a previous owner before
Snape (who might well have been LV).  This may have been part of how
Snape was pulled into the Dark Arts, but was dropped from the books.

In &quot;The Prince's Tale&quot; we are told he did it on Dumbledore's orders.  He
needed to remain valuable to LV, more valuable than the other Death
Eaters.  (LV was always going to appoint his most trusted servant as
headmaster -- in charge of the place closest to LV's heart -- and
Dumbledore wanted to ensure that was Snape.)

Mundungus had a bad habit of selling trinkets to bad wizards.  He met up
with Umbridge this way, and presumably met with Snape similarly.  Snape
confunded Mundungus to put the idea of the fake Harry's (which came from
Dumbledore's painting) into Mundungus's head.  It would not have been
hard for Snape to elicit the date by legilimency.

Snape was Voldemorts right hand man. His most loyal DE etc. Therefore
he had to prove he had accurate inside knowledge and show he is worthy
to Voldemort. Also he didn't risk Harry's life...if Harry hadn't tried
to disarm Stan they would never have known which was the real Harry.

Mundungus was under the Imperius curse and didn't know Snape had told

Only a true Gryffindor can take it from the *hat* (which serves as a
magical portal for the sword, in times of need). However, Harry has
pulled it from the hat in COS, and it's been in Dumbledor's office
ever since, probably hidden it's secret compartment that DD and SS
knew about, with a fake in a glass case, on the wall.  If the hat had
been far away, and put on by a Gryffindor when in need, the hat would
likely have brought it from the hidden compartment in the headmaster's
office, to whoever had the hat.  But, Snape merely allowed the fake to
be taken to Bellatrix's vault for safekeeping, then planted the real
one (after taking it in a thoroughly non-magical manner, from it's
hiding place) and placing it in the woods.

Snape himself wrote all those remarks in the potions book. It had
belonged to him.  As for the countercurse, it's possible that all he
did was *close* wounds/deep cuts.  Nothing had been removed from
Malfoy.  Also in HBP, Snape made a big deal out of &quot;getting there in
time&quot; to help Malfoy. It's possible that too much time had past for
George's ear.  And he could not tell anyone from the order the counter
curse. It would have blown his cover.

Actually, Dumbledore's portrait told Snape to do so. I forget the
reason. Dumbledore also told Snape to confund Mundungus and make him
believe that the 7 potters had been Mundungus's idea, when it had been
Dumbledore's.

Well, I took it to mean that Snape would briefly capture Mundungus,
confund him, modify his memory, and let him know. I doubt there is ANY
relationship between Mundungus and Snape.  M likely thinks Snape is a
traitor, as everyone else does.

No plot hole. The book WAS 50 years old. It had belonged to Snape's
mother first. But it was Snape who wrote in it. Too bad it had to have
been destroyed by the Fiendfyer.

I thought this an unbelievable plot twist.  Yes, Snape should have
given some information to Voldemort, but not the whole truth.  This
exposed Harry (and the other Order members) to extreme danger,
resulted in the death of Moody.  Harry himself just barely escaped
being killed. Surely, there would have been a way to feed Voldemort
just enough information to make him realize that Snape had an inside
source, without giving him the ammunition to ambush Harry.

It's dark magic and therefore not taught at Hogwarts. It's possible that
Snape is the only one who knows the counter-curse.

3)Why did Snape tell LV the exact time when the order wanted to leave

It's called keeping up the ruse.

Doesn't anyone here remember?  In Snape's memory, he gets the sword
from behind the portrait (the REAL sword).  The one hangning in the
office was the fake one.  The real sword was given by a true
Griffindor (Dumbledore) to Snape for purposes of a true Griffindor
getting it.  Snape was nothing more than a carrier for it anyway; he
didn't use it for anything and he didn't summon it.

I had assumed it was a &quot;classroom&quot; textbook (whatever you call it when
it's in that cupboard for lending instead of belonging to a student)
before Snape came, and that Snape used it (too poor to afford one of
his own ?), and that this was why ended up back in that cupboard
instead of, say, Snape's attic.
Otherwise I suppose Snape becoming teacher in Potions could explain
its presence there, but would Snape really let such a textbook lie
around if he knew about it ?
Or maybe he kept it there to show his best students ?

Well his mother certainly attended Hogwarts, and it would seem that the
basic magical textbooks had not changed in a very long time.

I'm sure he kept it for his own note purposes when he needed it. Even

I got that far myself. I just wanted to know who wrote the additional
remarks to the recipes of the potions. Snape was great at potions and
so was Lily. WHY were they so good at potions? Were the recipes
corrected by Eileen Prince and Severus and Lily took advantage from
it? If Snape worked them out himself, did he find the changes out
during lessons as a student or did he correct the original during his
studies as a teacher at Hogwarts. If he has worked on the book during
the last years as a teacher I wonder why he left it in the Dungeons.
It is so important you would not believe Snape forgot about it.

Snape recognized his Sectumsempra at once when Harry tried it out on
Draco in HBP. He murmurs a few words and touches Draco´s wounds with
his wand. They heal instantly and Snape says that maybe only a few
scars will be left over but maybe not even as much as that. He does
have a coutercurse to Sectumsempra!

Sorry... was a confundus charm... this is from the book where DD is
talking to Snape in the Penseive scene towards the end (p. 581).

From the book:

However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to
ensure Harry’s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus,
if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act your part
convincingly. . . I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort’s
good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the
mercy of the Carrows. . . ”

Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern,
Mundungus’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in
concentration.

Because it was a rarely used thing.  Not really used in &quot;battle&quot; till
Harry's time.  Snape probably would be the one that would have to
invent the counter to it.

Because Dumbledore wanted him too, telling him to do so, so that he
would be more trusted to Voldemort.  He felt that was the best
alternative (combined with their 7 Harry's plot) to save Harry, as

Why do people bring Mung up all the time?  He was loyal only to
himself.  He only followed orders when under threat (he was a coward)

Only a true Gryffindor would be given Gryffindor's sword by
Gryffindor's hat. But then, if Snape had been Sorted again at the age
of about 36 or 37, which house would he have ended up in?

Actually, according to Phineas Nigellus it seems that Snape got it
from the Headmaster's office. And it was also Snape who hid the real
one and sent a decoy to Gringott's. Seems that he thought Harry needed
it more than Ginny, Neville &amp; Luna did. At that moment, he was right.

&gt;&gt; &gt;There is a bigger issue with the Potions book that looks like a dropped
&gt;&gt; &gt;plot-line.  In HBP we are told the book is at least fifty years old and
&gt;&gt; &gt;much too old to have been James's or Lily's.  Snape was their
&gt;&gt; &gt;contemporary.  There must therefore have been a previous owner before
&gt;&gt; &gt;Snape (who might well have been LV).  This may have been part of how
&gt;&gt; &gt;Snape was pulled into the Dark Arts, but was dropped from the books.

&gt;&gt; Obvious answer: Snape got the book secondhand from his mother. There were
&gt;&gt; some signs that the Snape family was not a very wealthy one. Textbooks are
&gt;&gt; expensive!

&gt;I got that far myself. I just wanted to know who wrote the additional
&gt;remarks to the recipes of the potions. Snape was great at potions and
&gt;so was Lily. WHY were they so good at potions? Were the recipes
&gt;corrected by Eileen Prince and Severus and Lily took advantage from
&gt;it?
">

Snape's description of the art of potionmaking in PS/SS shows that he was
much impressed with the field, second only to his appreciation for dark
arts. In the same way that Hermione has no trouble in comprehending the
rule for mixed poisons, potionmaking was something that Snape just had a
knack for. My guess as far as Lily goes is that Snape helped her a lot,
plus since Slughorn liked her personally, and her being dead, it's not out
of the question that he's sprucing up her history a little bit.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; If Snape worked them out himself, did he find the changes out
&gt;during lessons as a student or did he correct the original during his
&gt;studies as a teacher at Hogwarts.
">

If he'd done the experimentation as a teacher, he'd have probably used
seperate notes, and not a textbook. I'm guessing he spent a lot of time in
the potions lab experimenting with different things.

:&gt;I had assumed it was a &quot;classroom&quot; textbook (whatever you call it when
:&gt;it's in that cupboard for lending instead of belonging to a student)
:&gt;before Snape came
:
: Well his mother certainly attended Hogwarts, and it would seem that the
: basic magical textbooks had not changed in a very long time.
:
:&gt;Otherwise I suppose Snape becoming teacher in Potions could explain
:&gt;its presence there, but would Snape really let such a textbook lie
:&gt;around if he knew about it ?
:&gt;Or maybe he kept it there to show his best students ?
:
: I'm sure he kept it for his own note purposes when he needed it. Even
: experts need to look up things in their field from time to time.

I expect that he was even more skilled as an adult and had no need
of his schoolboy notes.

I'm just surprised that something the Potions Master regarded as
so incorrect and inadequate remained the standard Advanced Potions
text...and posit,as I've noted,that after his death his office notes
(more coherent than his earlier scribbles) were used to re-edit the
text and he was given a partial byline.

Unfortunately, I'm sure Snape got satisfaction out of knowing that
none of his students was capable of reproducing his results and
enjoyed the edge he had over everyone else. He was much more of an
artist than a scientist :).

But the information could have been made available before he
&quot;went over&quot;...why not?

:&gt;
:&gt; 3)Why did Snape tell LV the exact time when the order wanted to leave
:&gt; Privet drive? He risked Harry?s life and all others lives by that.
:
: Snape was Voldemorts right hand man. His most loyal DE etc. Therefore
: he had to prove he had accurate inside knowledge and show he is worthy
: to Voldemort. Also he didn't risk Harry's life...if Harry hadn't tried
: to disarm Stan they would never have known which was the real Harry.

It does occur to me though that Snape's usefulness to the DEs
as a spy inside the Order would pretty much disappear once the
Order assumed him to be a pure DE...so why would He-Who-Must-Be-
Called-Ickle-Tommykins figure Snape would still learn Order plans?

:&gt; 4) Mundungus was loyal to DD. Snape killed DD ( at least that is what

:
: Mundungus was under the Imperius curse and didn't know Snape had told
: him anything. Instead Snape planted the idea in his head like it was
: Mundungus's idea.

Snape used Confundus as I recall...
