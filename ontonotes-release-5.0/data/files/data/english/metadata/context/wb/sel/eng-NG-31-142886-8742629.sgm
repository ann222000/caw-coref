The Crucifixion of Jesus and the Gospel of Peter

by Fariduddien Rice

Assalamu alaikum / Peace be with you,

The crucifixion of Jesus (peace be with him) is of fundamental
importance to the theology of most contemporary Christian churches. It
is of great importance to the Christian doctrine that Jesus (p.) died
so that mankind's sins could be forgiven. The standard account of what
historically happened during the crucifixion of Jesus (p.) in today's
Christian church is based on the accounts in the four &quot;canonical&quot;
gospel accounts, known as the Gospels according to Mark, Matthew,
Luke, and John (though the authors of these writings are generally in
fact anonymous). In these accounts, Jesus (p.) was crucified, died on
the cross, then arose from the dead, and after that he was raised into
the sky.

In contrast to this particular Christian account of the crucifixion,
however, we have the Islamic account. The Qur'an clearly states that
Jesus (p.) was not crucified or killed, but instead that God raised
him unto Himself.

How do we understand the conflicting accounts? In fact, the early
Christian church had many different &quot;branches,&quot; believing in different
doctrines. The four canonical Gospels are those gospels which were
approved by the Trinitarian branch of the church, that believed in the
doctrine that Jesus died to atone for mankind's sins. However, in the
early Christian church, there were also other branches of
Christianity, which had their own gospel accounts and other writings.

Historically, the Trinitarian church triumphed politically, with the
help of the Roman Emperor Constantine and his successors, and the
other non-Trinitarian branches of Christianity were suppressed.
Nevertheless, we are fortunate that discoveries, primarily within the
last century, have meant that we now have access to alternative early
gospels which belonged to early alternative Christian churches,
although some are only known to us in fragments. Regarding accounts of
the crucifixion, one of these gospels is a fragment from the Gospel of
Peter. Interestingly, the Gospel of Peter could support the Qur'anic
account of the crucifixion.

The rest of this essay will be broken up as follows: 1. First, we will
present the Qur'anic account of the crucifixion of Jesus (p.); 2.
Second, we shall present the account as it occurs in the Gospel of
Peter; 3. Thirdly, we shall discuss the authenticity and dating of
this Gospel; and 4. we shall conclude with a brief summary.

1. The Qur'anic Account of the Crucifixion of Jesus (p.)

The Qur'an's account of the crucifixion of Jesus (p.) is as follows:

...because of their [the Jews] saying: &quot;We slew the Messiah, Jesus son
of Mary, God's messenger&quot; -- They slew him not nor crucified, but it
appeared so unto them; and lo! those who disagree concerning it are in
doubt thereof; they have no knowledge thereof save pursuit of a
conjecture; they slew him not for certain,
But God took him up unto Himself. God was ever Mighty, Wise.

(Qur'an 4:157-158, adapted from Pickthall's translation.)
Therefore, the Qur'an seems clear: Jesus (p.) was not crucified or
killed, but it was made to appear that he was to those who wished to
kill him. The fact that the statement &quot;God took him up unto Himself&quot;
appears directly after the denial that he was crucified or killed
seems to indicate that this is connected to the fact that Jesus (p.)
was not crucified or killed.

Now we shall compare the account of the crucifixion in the Qur'an with
that in the Gospel of Peter.

2. The Account of the Crucifixion of Jesus (p.) in the Gospel of
Peter

We only have today part of the Gospel of Peter, however what we do
have contains a complete account of the crucifixion. The following
translations are taken from the translation of the Gospel of Peter in
&quot;The Complete Gospels: Annotated Scholars Version&quot; edited by R. J.
Miller (HarperCollins, 1994, 3rd edition), which is a compilation of
translations of various early gospels. The verse references in the
Gospel refer to the verse references in this translation.

Here is an excerpt from the Gospel of Peter, beginning with the actual
beginning of Jesus (p.) being put on the cross.

And they brought two criminals and crucified the Lord between them.
But he himself remained silent, as if in no pain. And when they set up
the cross, they put an inscription on it, &quot;This is the king of
Israel.&quot; And they piled his clothing in front of him; then they
divided it among themselves, and gambled for it. But one of those
criminals reproached them and said, &quot;We're suffering for the evil that
we've done, but this fellow, who has become a savior of humanity, what
wrong has he done to you?&quot; And they got angry at him and ordered that
his legs not be broken so he would die in agony.
5. It was midday and darkness covered the whole of Judea. They were
confused and anxious for fear the sun had set since he was still
alive.  For it is written that, &quot;The sun must not set upon the one who
has been executed.&quot; And one of them said, &quot;Give him vinegar mixed with
something bitter to drink.&quot; And they mixed it and gave it to him to
drink. And they fulfilled all things and brought to completion the
sins on their head. Now many went about with lamps, and, thinking that
it was night, they laid down. And the Lord cried out, saying, &quot;My
power,  my power, you have abandoned me.&quot; When he said this, he was
taken up. And at that moment, the veil of the Jerusalem temple as torn
in two.

(Gospel of Peter 4:1-5:6.)
After this, the text continues to say (in brief) that they took the
&quot;Lord&quot; down from the cross, the earth shook, and the sun came out.
They then gave the body to Joseph of Arimathea to bury it.

I want to highlight first that in 4:1, the text says that Jesus (p.)
on the cross &quot;himself remained silent, as if in no pain.&quot; Therefore,
according to this account, being on the cross was apparently no ordeal
for Jesus (p.), and it was not a painful event.

Secondly, I would like to highlight that in 5:5, after Jesus (p.)
cried out &quot;My power, my power, you have abandoned me,&quot; the text says
that, under the cover of an early darkness, &quot;he was taken up.&quot; On this
point, the commentators to this translation write:

Taken up may be a euphemism for death or it might refer to an
ascension into heaven. The latter meaning would suggest a rescue
combined with an exaltation of a suffering son of God.
This latter interpretation is consistent with the Qur'anic account.
Remember, the Qur'an says that, regarding the crucifixion:

They slew him not, nor crucified, but it appeared so unto them ....
But God took him up unto Himself.
(Qur'an 4:157-158.)
Therefore, the account of the crucifixion in the Gospel of Peter seems
consistent with the Qur'anic testimony, which suggests that Jesus was
not killed, though it was made to appear he was; instead God took him
up unto Himself.

Note that where the Gospel of Peter has that Jesus (p.) was &quot;taken up&quot;
during the crucifixion, the canonical Gospels say that he stopped
breathing. The two accounts are not necessarily contradictory, since
the Qur'an says that it was made to appear to them that they had
killed him.

Also, the only raising of Jesus (p.) in the canonical Gospels occurs
in Luke, where, after he had died and resurrected in this Gospel, he
&quot;was carried up into the sky&quot; (Luke 24:51). It is interesting that the
Gospel of Peter has, in contrast, Jesus being &quot;taken up&quot; while he was
on the cross (5:5), in contrast to Luke, who has him raised
afterwards. (Unfortunately, we do not know what happened to Jesus
after his tomb was found not to contain him in the Gospel of Peter,
since the last part of the Gospel has been lost.)

3. The Authenticity of the Gospel of Peter

The longest manuscript we have of the Gospel of Peter comes from a a
papyrus codex discovered by French archaeologists in a monk's grave in
Egypt in 1886. According to the compilers of &quot;The Complete Gospels,&quot;
the handwriting of this manuscript suggests that it dates from the
eighth or ninth century. However, since then two tiny fragments of the
Gospel of Peter in Greek have also been discovered. These fragments
were published in 1972, and they have been dated to the late second or
early third century (i.e. around 200 C.E.). This means that the latest
the Gospel of Peter could have been composed would be around 200 C.E.,
however, most likely it was composed much earlier since existing
fragments from around 200 C.E. means that probably the work was
already well distributed at that time.

The Gospel of Peter contains a differing account of certain events,
such as those we have noted and others also contained in the text.
Regarding this, the Jesus Seminar (a group of scholars of Jesus (p.))
write:

Depending on how one reads the relationship between Peter and the
canonical gospels, one could maintain that one or the other preserved
an earlier, historical kernel.
Therefore, with the evidence we have at present, one could argue that
either the Gospel of Peter, or the canonical accounts, preserve an
earlier historical account. It is impossible to tell.
Unlike the canonical Gospel accounts, which do not explicitly name
their authors, the Gospel of Peter explicitly names Simon Peter as its
author within the text. The very last line of the existent manuscript
says, that after they found the tomb opened and Jesus (p.) not there,

... I, Simon Peter, and Andrew, my brother, took our fishing and went
away to the sea. And with us was Levi, the son of Alphaeus, whom the
Lord....
(Peter 14:3)
That is where the text ends. Simon Peter is also identified as the
author (though not by name) in Peter 7:2. If this claim is accepted,
then the original Gospel of Peter was composed by one of the disciples
of Jesus (p.). This certainly may be possible; for example, the Gospel
of Luke refers to the existence of many earlier Gospels written by
eyewitnesses (Luke 1:1-2).

4. Conclusion

The historical evidence shows that this is an early Gospel, since the
earliest fragments of manuscript we have of it date to about 200 C.E.,
however, most likely the original text was composed much earlier, and
it may even contain an earlier account of the historical events than
the canonical Gospels contain. The manuscript itself identifies Simon
Peter, one of the disciples of Jesus (p.), as its author.

According to the Gospel of Peter, Jesus (p.) was put on the cross, but
on the cross he remained silent, acting as if he was in no pain. Near
the end of the day, the sky darkened, and Jesus was &quot;taken up,&quot; which
could be interpreted that he was saved from the crucifixion, at least
in spirit. However, a body remained on the cross, and this was later
buried. This account seems to be in agreement with the account of the
crucifixion given in the Qur'an, where it is said Jesus (p.) was
neither crucified nor killed, but it was made to appear so to them,
and that instead God took Jesus up unto Himself.

And Allah knows best.
