Hello,

I wanted to make this community aware of a batch geocoding bug I found
in the MapMarker 13.0 release.  When I set up a process to geocode
addresses at the street level I was finding that in batch mode
(running the .bat file created by MapMarker 13) the results were only
at the new geographic level of City, County or State resolution.
MapInfo did acknowledge this as a bug in the release and provided a
new .exe as a fix to this (the new .exe works like a charm).  I would
recommend to anyone using MapMarker 13.0 that you inquire with MapInfo
about the replacement .exe for this release so you don't introduce
geocoding errors into your data.

Thanks,
