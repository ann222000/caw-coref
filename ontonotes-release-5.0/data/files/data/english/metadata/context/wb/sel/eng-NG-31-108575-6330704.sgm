Dawn comes shining
like a Lady of Light,
stirring to life all creatures.
Now it is time to kindle the Fire.
The light of Dawn scatters the shadows.

Her face turned toward
this far-flung world,
she rises, enwrapped in bright garments.
Shining with gold,
with rays of light bedecked,
she sends forth the world on its course.

Our Lady of Light
brings the Eye of the Gods,
as she rides her white, beautiful steed.
Dawn shines apparent,
bestowing on all men
her store of marvelous treasure.

Come with your bounty;
drive away foes.
Grant us secure and lush pastures.
Disperse those who hate us.
O bountiful One,
give to your singer reward.

Beam forth your light
to guide and sustain us,
prolonging, O Goddess, our days.
Give to us food, grant to us joy,
chariots and cattle and horses.

Lady nobly born,
Daughter of Heaven,
worshiped by all the illustrious,
grant us your blessings,
riches and wealth.
Now and forever protect us!

ROMANCE

Like undistinguishable horses,
Gleam by my ever-painful days,
As if fade all the living roses,
And die all living nightingales.

But she is, too, upset and saddened,
My single governess - my love,
And under her skin of a satin,
The poisoned blood is now moved.

And if I stand the world I live in,
That is because I have a dream:
Both of us, like two blind children,
Will go to the highland's rims,

Where clouds are so white and close,
Where only goats run the dales,
To seek forever faded roses,
And hark to lifeless nightingales.

Alexander Pushkin          [Tr. by Timothy Sergay]

The Prophet

Sore parched for spiritual things,
In gloomy wastelands I abided.
A seraph, then, with six bright wings
Appeared to me where roads divided.

With fingers fleet as dreams will be
Mine earthly eyes at once touched he.
Those eyes then oped with second sight,
Like mother eagles' when in fright.

Mine earthly ears his fingers found;
And they were filled with mighty sound:
To heaven's quakes mine ears grew keen,
And angels' circling overhead,
And 'neath the waves, sea crawlers' tread,
And growth of vines in dales of green.

He, bending to my mouth, reached in,
Tore out my wretched tongue of sin,
To gossip and deceit long trained,
And fixed in mine insensate lips
A cunning serpent tongue's twin tips
With his right hand, by blood now stained.

My breast then with a sword he split,
My heart, still quiv'ring, he withdrew,
And in my gaping breast he fit
A burning coal of fiery hue.

I lay upon the dust, a corse,
Then called a voice with God's full force:

Arise, my prophet, see and hear,
My will alone let fill thy ken,
And wand'ring lands both far and near,
With utt'rance sear the hearts of men.
