Hello there,

I've been thinking and I reckon there might be a hidden element to the
plot that I'll have to keep my eyes out for during my re-read of DH.

We learn a lot about Harry's and Voldemort's ancestry through the
series and in the epilogue we discover that having paired up Harry-
Ginny and Ron-Hermione, the next generation are shaping up to unite
the Weasley/Delacour and Lupin/Tonks(Black) families.

While we do discover a considerable amount about Dumbledore's
immediate family history in DH, the ancestry further back is unclear.

Likewise we learn that Harry and Voldemort are descended from two of
the Peverell brothers, but the eldest brother Antioch has no recorded
descendants.

I posit that the Dumbledores are descended from Antioch Peverell. I'll
have to re-read with this in mind, but I'd be interested if anyone
else has any input on the idea.

This would mean that Dumbledore, Voldemort and Harry are the
descendants of the 3 brothers Antioch, Cadmus and Ignotus
respectively. This would mean all the major characters were ultimately
related. It would also tie in with the story of the three brothers in
that Dumbledore is (in a sense) killed by the Resurrection Stone,
Voldemort by the Elder Wand and Harry survives.

Nice theory... but wouldn't you think Dumbledore might've let on that
there was that link?? Having said that it *would* tie in nicely with
the other parts of the story.

Be nice to be able to ask JKR about it tho wouldn't it??

Looking back, I think DD is more notable for what he
DIDN'T tell Harry rather than what he did.  I wouldn't
be surprised that he wouldn't reveal this info.
