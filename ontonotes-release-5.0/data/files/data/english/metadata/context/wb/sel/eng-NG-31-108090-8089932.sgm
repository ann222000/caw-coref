Wow! What's to say? Mat got super lucky on Sat., as he looked done before
the flag and I found it a little ironic because he's one of the biggest
bitchrz ever about red flags. Heh, what goes around, comes around and I
guess it was his turn! Whatever they did during the red flag break, well,
WORKED! He ripped off a few of the fastest two wheeled laps ever at M/O,
impressive to say the least. How 'bout my man Miggy? He didn't look done
Saturday..

Sunday was a whole different deal and I know the weather happens and there's
nothing anyone can do, but you gotta wonder why they just didn't rain it
out. From what I heard today was an open track day and it would've been
great to see the SS's, as well as a full SB race too, but it's AMA racing
and when that's at M/O, well, anything can(does) happen...(rumor has it that
there's a movement afoot to rename the M/O race for Julian, I'm only happy
when it rains, Bond;)
Oh yeah, a box for Kaw, not bad even if it was a shortened race, kudo's to
Hacking!

Bottom line, Mat widdles into Ben's lead and with VIR and R/A up next he's
prolly gonna do some more widdlin' being how those are his most fav places!
If so, SB might have some drama when it heads back west. A shootout shootout
at the sand box?  It could happen...

FX was closer than it might appear, but still it was mostly Hayes.

The &quot;lad&quot; Davies might have taken a hit yesterday, he looked super strong in
SSport and it would've been great to see him dice with Rog, Josh and Jamie
on a track he's actually raced before. Rog prolly got a fairly good size
break in the title chase too and even though Jamie did well in SB, I'd
imagine he was miffed that it started as late as it did...

Danville next, be there, or as Mark says, be ____....

I guess it's a balancing act between the need to preserve the clutch and
the need to erase a margin created by lousy starts, which in turn may be
because of the need to preserve the clutch. Or something like that...

I'm not sure that they changed anything, although he put down some very
impressive lap times, that's for sure. My guess is that he was pissed
about his first start (and his second wasn't that much better) and just
got very aggressive when he still had a chance to win. I don't know how
damp the track was, but in the Sunday race his best lap was over a
second slower.

Well, he beat 2A-Ron by a fraction of a second, a guy on a bike that you
claim isn't capable of competing because of this supposed factory-AMA
conspiracy. And Rog by a fraction of a second more, a guy who's never
been on a SB podium and a bike that had only been there once before, I
believe. And he finished 17 seconds behind the winner, despite the
restart halfway through the race. But a podium is a podium, I guess...

Seems like he's really made a jump since the team forced him to use
Rog's softer settings a few races back. But he's made some pretty
hairball moves lately, ending up off the track at Laguna and down for
the count on Saturday. On that one, do you think he got in too hot or
did Miguel brake-check him, intentionally or otherwise?

Yep, could be a very good final. Mat's 17 down now, and four wins would
erase 16 of that, pole and laps led points aside. Assuming Ben finishes
second, which seems almost like a lock - he's been either first or
second in 33 of the last 35 SB races, including his 7th-place cruise to
the title at MO last year, which is a truly amazing record for anyone,
let alone a kid of his age. But if Mat can take those wins and even half
the laps-led points, never mind the poles, it's winner-take-all at
Laguna. Sweet...

Yup, he's still 13 up on Hacking now, which means Jamie might have to

Actually, I bitched because they forced the issue when they should have just

a soaked piece of cardboad, or in a steamy car, but we only hung around
until it was obvious it wasn't gonna clear up, after that it fell into the

fan fuckin', plain and simple and if you can't appreciate that you're even
dumber than I thought, either that, or your head is now permanently up AMA's
rectum. Rain, the last time I checked, is still an act of God and for any
outfit, whether promoter's, the track, or the santctioning body not to have
a contingency plan (rain date) at a track that historically has problems
speaks volumes on how they feel about the paying public. Had I spent a few
hundred to sit all day in the rain(I wouldn't have) just to watch an
abbreviated SB race as the sun set I would've said, &quot;never fuckin' again,&quot;
especially when none of the support races were run either. What I thought
was kinda funny was the press releases and their so-called &quot;wet strategy&quot;

A few responses:

1) I took a quick peek at what you said last year, and there was an
awful lot of vomit to wade through, including things like a
double-secret 5-year contract to run the final race (you know, the deal
that lasted one year), that the August race always has been a no-rain
race (which is not true, of course), that the finale was contracted as a
yes-rain race (again, no evidence to confirm that), that double points
would be rewarded (and weren't, of course), that the AMA screwed Rog
Hayden out of the SB Rookie of the Year (which he did later win), etc.,
etc. But I didn't see anything about calling the day because of rain.

2) Regarding the AMA's published rain plan, here's an excerpt from that:
4. If the rain has not stopped by 4pm, Sunday's events will be canceled.
5. If the Superbike race is completed the meet will be considered
complete regardless of whether Supersport or Superstock is completed.
6. Should no races be completed on Sunday the meet may be moved to
Monday. At this time the availability of Monday for on track activities
is in question.

RRW had earlier reported this (from &quot;two creditable sources in the
paddock&quot;): &quot;The goal Sunday will be to get the AMA Superbike race run.
If that happens the day will be considered complete whether the
Supersport or Superstock classes race or not. If necessary, AMA Racing
officials will wait out the rain until 3:00 p.m. local time. At that
point, if the rain has not stopped and drying of the track has not
begun, the day will be called rained out and racing will be moved to
Monday. The track is available for use on Monday.&quot;

At 2pm, after the official plan had been released, RRW said the rain had
stopped (rendering the scheduled stoppage moot), and the AMA had updated
their plan to run on Monday if necessary. At 3pm Soup confirmed that it
wasn't raining and vehicles were circulating on the track toi dry it. So
the AMA did what they said, not canceling the day if the rain had
stopped by mid-afternoon, tried to get the SB race in, did that after
waiting for the track to be sufficiently dry, then it got too dark, and
that ended the weekend - as they said it would. Regarding Monday, that
issue was pretty much up to The Cunt in the Tower, and who knows what
she was thinking or doing, besides minding her purse. And the AMA's plan
said nothing about TV that I can see.

3) Regarding your quick trigger on the rainout, I think the AMA has a
general philosophy that if you can get the racing in, you do it. And
that makes a lot of sense to me, and probably to a lot of the fans who'd
bought tickets and sat through that rain. If you had gone to the race,
had to head back to the Swamp on Monday, how would you feel if they'd
called it even though the rain had stopped and track was drying? I'll
bet you'd be totally trashing the AMA right now for doing that[1]. I've
been to two AMA Monday make-ups, at Laguna in '95 when there were almost
no fans left there to watch Spencer win his last race, and at Sears in
'00 when everyone (mostly participants) sat all day waiting for...
nothing. Both times I burned up a vacation day, and I don't have endless
numbers of those.

4) Regarding a further rain date, the AMA season has only a little over
a month left, and there are three more events to be run in that time.
I'm sure Mid-Ohio has a pretty full summer schedule, so when do they do
it? When Sears rained out in May of 2000, there was no reschedule,
because there was no date on which both the track and the series were
available, so they compensated the fans and took a big loss. In this
case two races had been run on Saturday, so what do they do, come back
for one day sometime in September? A rain date is hardly the norm in
racing, here or anywhere else.

[1] Of course I couldn't get a bet like that, because no bookie would be
fool enough to even possibly think you wouldn't be...

I can understand cancelling because of monsoon conditions. Some times
the rain is just all too much. But I don't understand racing on circuits
where you can't race if there's any rain at all. If the circuit is safe
in the dry, what makes it dangerous in the wet?

The answer is that's it is not really safe in the dry, but the sketchy areas
get very bad in the wet (lack of runoff, inconsistant traction)

That's half the answer. The other half is that I really doubt that there
are no tracks in the UK used by BSB that don't fall in the same
category. But because it rains so much over there, the very idea of not
racing in the rain makes no sense, you'd be canceling races all the
time. So part of rain racing becomes making sure you don't push too hard
in spots where crashing means dying. You do that or you just don't
bother to race there.

The AMA has also raced at dual-use tracks, bowls with banking surrounded
by walls and drag strips that get nasty slick when wet. They no longer
have any of the latter, since Sears changed its configuration and
Brainerd got dropped, but there's nothing that can make a place like
Daytona safe enough in the rain.

The only way to know what a true comparison would be would to have the
two series switch tracks and have all the race weekends impacted by
rain. Then the reaction of the riders would tell you everything. At
Mid-Ohio, my guess is that the BSB guys race. They just don't know any
better...

I'm not an expert on any of this but while watching either MGP or WSB
in wet race they were talking about races getting called over here
because of rain. They mentioned something about the paint they use
over there to mark to the curbs (kerbs in their language &lt;G&gt;) and such
being of a type that is specially developed so it doesn't get snot
slick when wet, and they remarked that we don't use that type of paint
over here, adding to track danger in wet conditions.
Anybody know if that's true?

&gt; 2) Regarding the AMA's published rain plan, here's an excerpt from that:
&gt;  4. If the rain has not stopped by 4pm, Sunday's events will be canceled.
&gt;  5. If the Superbike race is completed the meet will be considered
&gt; complete regardless of whether Supersport or Superstock is completed.
&gt;  6. Should no races be completed on Sunday the meet may be moved to
&gt; Monday. At this time the availability of Monday for on track activities is
&gt; in question.

&gt; RRW had earlier reported this (from &quot;two creditable sources in the
&gt; paddock&quot;): &quot;The goal Sunday will be to get the AMA Superbike race run. If
&gt; that happens the day will be considered complete whether the Supersport or
&gt; Superstock classes race or not. If necessary, AMA Racing officials will
&gt; wait out the rain until 3:00 p.m. local time. At that point, if the rain
&gt; has not stopped and drying of the track has not begun, the day will be
&gt; called rained out and racing will be moved to Monday. The track is
&gt; available for use on Monday.&quot;

And Speed said they'd for hang a day too!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; At 2pm, after the official plan had been released, RRW said the rain had
&gt; stopped (rendering the scheduled stoppage moot), and the AMA had updated
&gt; their plan to run on Monday if necessary. At 3pm Soup confirmed that it
&gt; wasn't raining and vehicles were circulating on the track toi dry it. So
&gt; the AMA did what they said, not canceling the day if the rain had stopped
&gt; by mid-afternoon, tried to get the SB race in, did that after waiting for
&gt; the track to be sufficiently dry, then it got too dark, and that ended the
&gt; weekend - as they said it would. Regarding Monday, that issue was pretty
&gt; much up to The Cunt in the Tower, and who knows what she was thinking or
&gt; doing, besides minding her purse. And the AMA's plan said nothing about TV
&gt; that I can see.

&gt; 3) Regarding your quick trigger on the rainout, I think the AMA has a
&gt; general philosophy that if you can get the racing in, you do it.
">

The only problem with that is they did not, but don't let the actual facts
of what happened get in your AMA ass lovin' ways. IIRC, they put on an
abbreviated SB race at dusk and none of the SS's, one of which is the most
widely contested in the whole series! Now, I don't know about you, but to
me, sitting all day either in the rain, or soaked just to see 25 minutes of
raicing isn't real high on my &quot;to do&quot; list and if somone had crashed after 9
laps, or about 12 minutes they would've called it a day/night then! Such a
deal for the fans, huh?

And

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; that makes a lot of sense to me, and probably to a lot of the fans who'd
&gt; bought tickets and sat through that rain. If you had gone to the race, had
&gt; to head back to the Swamp on Monday, how would you feel if they'd called
&gt; it even though the rain had stopped and track was drying? I'll bet you'd
&gt; be totally trashing the AMA right now for doing that[1].
">

No, I would've done exactly what I said, waited till the rain date and for
your info, it's the beach, not the swamp, though I understand to a desert

I've

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Both times I burned up a vacation day, and I don't have endless numbers of

Both Speed and the track were available on Monday, however, the track would
have taken a hit on the part-time people they'd have to pay. So, it's not
hard to see who might have forced the issue (again) which brings me right
back to the sanctioning body. They are the folks who negoitate the deals,
they are the folks who, one would hope, after soo many decades of dealing
with track people and putting on races that should know shit happens and you
need a fall back and especially so at M/O, but apparently that was a little
too much to ask, or for that matter, expect...

When Sears rained out in May of 2000, there was no reschedule,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; you can't race if there's any rain at all. If the circuit is safe in the
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; dry, what makes it dangerous in the wet?

&gt; &gt;&gt; The answer is that's it is not really safe in the dry, but the sketchy areas
&gt; &gt;&gt; get very bad in the wet (lack of runoff, inconsistant traction)

&gt; &gt;That's half the answer. The other half is that I really doubt that there
&gt; &gt;are no tracks in the UK used by BSB that don't fall in the same
&gt; &gt;category. But because it rains so much over there, the very idea of not
&gt; &gt;racing in the rain makes no sense, you'd be canceling races all the
&gt; &gt;time. So part of rain racing becomes making sure you don't push too hard
&gt; &gt;in spots where crashing means dying. You do that or you just don't
&gt; &gt;bother to race there.

&gt; &gt;The AMA has also raced at dual-use tracks, bowls with banking surrounded
&gt; &gt;by walls and drag strips that get nasty slick when wet. They no longer
&gt; &gt;have any of the latter, since Sears changed its configuration and
&gt; &gt;Brainerd got dropped, but there's nothing that can make a place like
&gt; &gt;Daytona safe enough in the rain.

&gt; &gt;The only way to know what a true comparison would be would to have the
&gt; &gt;two series switch tracks and have all the race weekends impacted by
&gt; &gt;rain. Then the reaction of the riders would tell you everything. At
&gt; &gt;Mid-Ohio, my guess is that the BSB guys race. They just don't know any
&gt; &gt;better...

&gt; I'm not an expert on any of this but while watching either MGP or WSB
&gt; in wet race they were talking about races getting called over here
&gt; because of rain. They mentioned something about the paint they use
&gt; over there to mark to the curbs (kerbs in their language &lt;G&gt;) and such
&gt; being of a type that is specially developed so it doesn't get snot
&gt; slick when wet, and they remarked that we don't use that type of paint
&gt; over here, adding to track danger in wet conditions.
&gt; Anybody know if that's true?- Hide quoted text -
">

Yes, that's true, at least it has been at some tracks. It's certainly
not the case at Laguna, where the FIM mandates use of a certain type
of paint for GP tracks, and other tracks where they run in the rain
have used rain-tolerant paint, in some cases at the riders'
suggestion. But there's not a single track that doesn't have wet
racing solely because of curb paint. That does raise the issue of
surface conditions, though, and I suspect that tracks in the UK, or
tracks homologated for GP and WSB, generally are more aware of rain
issues and how the track grip is impacted any water. Regarding AMA
tracks, there are only a few where they will run in the rain - Laguna,
Barber, Elkhart, assumedly Miller, I believe VIR. They won't run at
Mid-Ohio (now), Sears (where it hasn't been pressed as an issue since
the track was revised), Daytona, Fontana, assumedly Road Atlanta
(because of the last turn). So if they don't run in the rain, how the
track reacts to rain is much less of an issue. At Laguna and Miller
it's almost certain that it won't rain when the AMA is there, so there
are only a few tracks left where it's really an issue. It seems like
there were complaints about the curb paint at Barber, but I'm not
certain on that..

You honestly don't think that there is a single point on any track in
BSB that has insufficient runoff to run safely in the rain? The basis of
my comment is that Hodgson said the AMA tracks were generally safer than
those in the UK, that even Bond has admitted that some tracks aren't
safe enough, that, although it's homologated for WSB, Brands could never
be accepted for GP in it's current configuration, and I would guess it's
hardly the worst track in BSB from a runoff standpoint.

In addition to all the rain that has to be dealt with in the UK, there
has to be some impact of the IoM tradition over there on the mentality
of British racers. Steve Hislop was BSB champion only five years ago,
and he's also one of the IoM legends. On the day that McGuinness did the
first 130mph lap of IoM this year, three people died there. If the IoM
was in the UK, it would have almost certainly have been ended by law by
now. Yet it is the single-most defining event in bike racing in the UK,
and that has to effect mentality about racing.

Have you ridden it since it was repaved? I would find it sort of
surprising if it's close to bad as it used to be, which was hands-down
the worst surface in AMA racing. I suppose the only thing remotely close
might be Daytona, and that's really just the banking.

No, the crux of your argument was shitting on the AMA. But, yes, running
in the wet and the rain was at the heart of the entire weekend last
year. On the specifics of the issue, I don't believe your position was
that they should have called it rained out, that would have required a
very early call, because all the shit came down there early in the

twice now we've had WSB races rained out, and no rain date was even

Pretty much everyone involved? It costs the teams, the AMA and Speed

the promoter will react? They'll want to have maximum effort to get the
races in, so they don't have to incur extra costs, and certainly don't
want to run the risk of having to refund tickets. That's just reality,
it's a business. So what if the promoters protest that lax attitude
about protecting their interests, do you just bail on the track, a race
that is well-attended and closest to a significant percentage of the
population, essentially the entire northeast, parts of the midwest and
all of eastern Canada? If not, what is the shutdown point? Is it like
GP, you either race on schedule or it's over? Do you have to have time
to get all the races in or you don't even try? I think it's a tough call
to make.

Well you will have seen wet races at Donington, Silverstone and Brands.
And you might have seen a wet race at Silverstone cancelled due to
standing water. Almost all the UK circuits have lots of elevation
changes so water tends to run off. There's only a couple of places where
water or mud end up on the track. I suspect the big difference with all
the circuits is that they are used every weekend and get good new tarmac
every 10 years or so. They're also mature circuits where the worst of
the safety issues were dealt with a while ago. (With the possible
exception of Mallory Park which really ought to be retired)

Yes.  The Husky is a 2006 model.

According to Julian. Who thinks almost everything about BSB is heaven on
earth, nary a discouraging word. His argument that these are &quot;mature
circuits where the worst of the safety issues were dealt with a while
ago&quot; strikes me as dubious at best. What is considered safe has changed
markedly over the years, recalling that GP ran at Imola as recently as
'99, Jarama in '98, Salzburgring in '94, Spa in '90, and think about the
condition of AMA tracks only a decade ago. Older circuits have been a
bigger problem in terms of safety, both in this country and at the world
level, with newer circuits (like Miller and Barber) having designed-in
safety margins, and realize that Mid-Ohio has been on the AMA calendar
longer than any race has been on the GP calendar except Assen. If Brit
tracks are old circuits like that, and my impression is that they mostly
are, then I have to believe they either have had notable safety work
done on them recently or they likely have some safety problems. Again, I
think it comes down to one's individual and group notion of safety. In
the land of IoM, I wonder what that really is. I'm not suggesting that
they're horrible, but I also doubt that they're all of nearly GP quality.

Sounds like they really needed to do more drainage work there. Seems
like a problem for a track to have seeping cracks a year after a major

Ground water can be hard to deal with.  The best way would be to
completely replace the track bed with appropriate under-track drainage
before repaving.  Given how resistant the management was to the repave
in the first place, I have my doubts that anything was done beyond a
simple resurfacing, which would leave the underlying seepage problem
intact despite the new surface.

Do you need more or less runoff in the rain? Or runoff in slightly
different areas because people have different accidents in the rain?

BSB.
- Brands Hatch
- Silverstone
- Donington
- Thruxton
- Oulton Park
- Snetterton
- Mondello Park
- Knockhill
- Croft
- Cadwell Park
- Mallory Park

So which of those are seriously dangerous in the wet? How about in the
dry? The ones that have seriously hurt riders where that might be blamed
on the circuit are Cadwell Park (Kagayama) and Mallory Park. People have
been hurt at other circuits, but it's nearly always not so much to do
with the circuit but more that M/C racing is dangerous. Steve Hislop at
Brands, Bayliss at Donington come to mind.

In the UK and in Europe, we race in the rain. The circuits may get more
dangerous or dangerous in a different way but they don't get unrideable
until the rain gets *really* bad. In the USA it seems there's more than
one track where a wet track means no racing.

Yes, they did, twice that I heard on the re-broadcasts of 'Guna and TV, as
you have bellowed many times, reaches most all the &quot;fans.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; 3) Regarding your quick trigger on the rainout, I think the AMA has a
&gt;&gt;&gt; general philosophy that if you can get the racing in, you do it.

&gt;&gt; The only problem with that is they did not, but don't let the actual
&gt;&gt; facts of what happened get in your AMA ass lovin' ways. IIRC, they put on
&gt;&gt; an abbreviated SB race at dusk and none of the SS's, one of which is the
&gt;&gt; most widely contested in the whole series! Now, I don't know about you,
&gt;&gt; but to me, sitting all day either in the rain, or soaked just to see 25
&gt;&gt; minutes of raicing isn't real high on my &quot;to do&quot; list and if somone had
&gt;&gt; crashed after 9 laps, or about 12 minutes they would've called it a
&gt;&gt; day/night then! Such a deal for the fans, huh?

&gt; As you said, rain is an act of God, and everyone there knew that rain was
&gt; not a good thing. The AMA plan was a public statement, so people should
&gt; have known what the deal was, that if the AMA could get the SB race in and
&gt; not the SS races, they'd be done for the weekend. At least twice now we've
&gt; had WSB races rained out, and no rain date was even discussed, the fans
&gt; just lose out. Fans, knowing the deal, could have left at any time, but
&gt; the ones who chose to wait it out deserved to get their racing in, and
&gt; they got what could safely be done.
">

How in the fuck do you know what the fans on site heard? It's been my
experience that when you're hunkered down under a tarp, or in a steamed up
car you don't know shit from shinola about what the &quot;plan&quot; is. Maybe those
in the suites, flag rooms, or with pit passes knew something, but it's
doubtful many others did even if they ever got their am broadcast thing up
and you should know full well the PA systems at motor tracks inherently suk
ass, that is, if they even have one..

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;  And
&gt;&gt;&gt; that makes a lot of sense to me, and probably to a lot of the fans who'd
&gt;&gt;&gt; bought tickets and sat through that rain. If you had gone to the race,
&gt;&gt;&gt; had to head back to the Swamp on Monday, how would you feel if they'd
&gt;&gt;&gt; called it even though the rain had stopped and track was drying? I'll
&gt;&gt;&gt; bet you'd be totally trashing the AMA right now for doing that[1].

&gt;&gt; No, I would've done exactly what I said, waited till the rain date

&gt; I said if you had to bail, for work or whatever, which is the situation
&gt; for the vast majority of fans. Maybe you could just sit there for an extra

&gt;&gt;&gt; no fans left there to watch Spencer win his last race, and at Sears in
&gt;&gt;&gt; '00 when everyone (mostly participants) sat all day waiting for...
&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing. Both times I burned up a vacation day, and I don't have endless
&gt;&gt;&gt; numbers of those.

&gt;&gt; The big deal was Speed and they stated they would hang for a day, but I
&gt;&gt; have a fairly good idea of who drove the &quot;get it over&quot; thing..

&gt; Pretty much everyone involved? It costs the teams, the AMA and Speed more
&gt; money to hang another day, and it certainly costs the track. So you end up
&gt; incurring the costs, and for not much more than a handful of fans who can
&gt; hang into the workweek. Maybe the weather gets better and you get the
&gt; races in, which is good. But mostly it benefits people like a certain
&gt; lardbutt sitting on his ass chowing down while watching the races down on
&gt; &quot;the beach&quot;...

Let's review, the teams were already on the road to RA and I really doubt
Yam, Hon and Kaw wanted to not run the SSport. Speed said they'd hang for a
day, so evidently they were prepared to shoulder their end of the expenses.
The track is an unknown, but remembering the bitch and how she pinches
pennies it was prolly her, but who knows, maybe all those AMA exec's and
their expense accounts would have broke their bank?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So what do you suggest? If the AMA says they're not going to race in the
&gt; wet and will readily cancel and roll over to Monday, how do you think the
&gt; promoter will react? They'll want to have maximum effort to get the races
&gt; in, so they don't have to incur extra costs, and certainly don't want to
&gt; run the risk of having to refund tickets. That's just reality, it's a
&gt; business. So what if the promoters protest that lax attitude about
&gt; protecting their interests, do you just bail on the track, a race that is
&gt; well-attended and closest to a significant percentage of the population,
&gt; essentially the entire northeast, parts of the midwest and all of eastern
&gt; Canada? If not, what is the shutdown point? Is it like GP, you either race
&gt; on schedule or it's over? Do you have to have time to get all the races in
&gt; or you don't even try? I think it's a tough call to make.

Of course it's a tough call, but isn't that what they get paid for? Look,
for the last time, these guys/clowns have been doing this for a long, long
time and should've have made a contengency for just this sort of deal at
that track.  If the track needed an out it should've been only after the
rain date and tickets should be clearly marked no-refunds for rain out with
the make-up date right next to it. If it rained both days, oh well.. How
hard is that? Picture some poor schmuck that threw down a couple hun to sit
in the wet all day just see 25 mins of racing at dusk, I'm thikin' he might
not be back for a while and qutie frankly, who could blame him? At least
with a rain date he's got the opportunity to come back, as it was, all he

Great place to sit for a change on the outside. I watched Haslam force

Shakey stayed on, but I don't know how. And isn't that where Lavilla was

Really? Kagayama lost it on the turn in at Clearways last weekend. Both
him and the bike stopped before the air fence. He was out in the second
race. Haga has lost it on the outside of Clearways half way round a few
years ago in practice. He got a badly bruised backside but was out in
the race. Jamie Witham had a horrendous accident one year but he managed
to ride a bucking bike into the *inside* of the corner and hit the pit
wall. I've watched Rob Frost take somebody out in the early part of the
corner and they were fit enough to have a fight in the sand pit. In
theory having a high side at the end of the corner is a recipe for real
disaster. But by that time you're almost upright and nobody ever does.

You can't really judge the difference from some aerial shots.

&gt; corner and they were fit enough to have a fight in the sand pit. In
&gt; theory having a high side at the end of the corner is a recipe for real
&gt; disaster. But by that time you're almost upright and nobody ever does.

&gt; You can't really judge the difference from some aerial shots.

Crashes are pretty rare @ Clearways - it's like everybody brakes early and

For sure, the downhill 4th gear (maybe top of 3rd?) last turn at

You're making the assumption there is a sand trap of some size.
There are really tiny or non-existant ones in a couple places at
Mid-Ohio.  The one where DuHamel got hurt this week
at Atlanta is tiny, probably just big enough to toss you up
in the air one revolution before you hit the wall.

Google doesn't have enough resolution to show you where.
Mapquest does, search on Mid-Ohio sports car course and
zoom in on the top right corner of the track.  The track
runs clockwise.  After the 90 degree right at the top
corner, you go down a fast hill, partly hidden by trees,
into a braking zone that is slightly turning right and uphill.
The wall is RIGHT THERE on your left.  This uphill is one
of the places where water seeps.

I could detail each corner's problem in the rain if I had time.

My thought on the wet/dry thing is predictability. In spots that are
really dangerous, the fast guys leave themselves a bit of a margin in
the dry, they don't push it to the edge. RA's T12 is an example of that,
and made Duhamel's pass on Gobert in '98 and Rog Hayden's last lap
maneuver in SStock two years ago pretty unusual. Out here an example
would be Sears' T10, and more so before they changed the approach, when
it was very fast.

But in the wet, they can't run that edge quite so precisely, so guys
occasionally step over and go down. Inconsistent surfaces make that
worse. That's why some tracks here are run in dry conditions and not in
the wet, I think.

On RA T12 vs, Clearways, the thing that should be mentioned beyond what
has already been said, is that Brands is homologated for WSB while T12
is probably the worst corner of the entire season in the AMA in the
minds of the really fast guys, and they complain every year. So either
there is effectively a different standard or there's something I'm just
not seeing in the comparison. Maybe the biggest crowd of the year for
WSB has something to do with it?

I don't really see that mattering that much, I'm talking about tradition
and psychology and not so much a current direct connection. But there
must be a number of guys crossing over from the BSB series, Hislop and
Fogarty are fairly contemporary and certainly notable, and does BSB ever
schedule any race conflicts with the TT? This year they took a four-week
break from mid-May to mid-June, which covers the TT, so it doesn't look
like the serious professionals simply ignored that event. And is there a
connection between McGuinness' team and the HRC-supported HM Plant Honda
team contesting the BSB championship?

This race was the UK's GP for 30 years and the lore continued with
things like Hailwood's comeback there and all the respect and admiration
for guys like Joey Dunlop. I just can't see how that tradition doesn't
have some level of impact on the mentality of British racers when it
comes to risk. And British fans as well, evidenced here by Julian's &quot;if
there's no [recent] body count, then it can't be that dangerous&quot; defense

announcement in the paddock. Beyond that it's not their problem, and the
fans, sitting in the rain and not seeing anything on the track in front
of them, obviously knew something was being decided that impacted them.
If they made no effort to find out what, that's their problem.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I said if you had to bail, for work or whatever, which is the situation
&gt;&gt; for the vast majority of fans. Maybe you could just sit there for an extra
&gt;&gt; day or two days, but most people can't.

&gt; At least they would've been given the opportunity to return, or watched them
&gt; on TV, as the races would've ran, but no...
">

Sounds like you're more concerned about what you missed on TV and not
the fans on site (shades of Bond and the 125/250 races at Laguna!). I
doubt too many people would be all that satisfied going to work or
traveling home and then watching a tape of the races on Speed that they
paid to see and didn't...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Pretty much everyone involved? It costs the teams, the AMA and Speed more
&gt;&gt; money to hang another day, and it certainly costs the track. So you end up
&gt;&gt; incurring the costs, and for not much more than a handful of fans who can
&gt;&gt; hang into the workweek. Maybe the weather gets better and you get the
&gt;&gt; races in, which is good. But mostly it benefits people like a certain
&gt;&gt; lardbutt sitting on his ass chowing down while watching the races down on
&gt;&gt; &quot;the beach&quot;...

&gt; Let's review, the teams were already on the road to RA and I really doubt
&gt; Yam, Hon and Kaw wanted to not run the SSport. Speed said they'd hang for a
&gt; day, so evidently they were prepared to shoulder their end of the expenses.
">

Maybe, or maybe they had the people and equipment available but there
would be some adjustment necessary regarding the money changing hands. I
really have no idea how something like this is handled in the contract
between Speed and the AMA.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The track is an unknown, but remembering the bitch and how she pinches
&gt; pennies it was prolly her,
">

I'm sure she had an opinion, and I'm sure she wasn't shy about
expressing it. But beyond that, who knows? My guess is that she wanted
the AMA to do whatever they could to get in as much as they could on
Sunday, probably because she didn't want to get left running the event
on Monday and/or refunding tickets if nothing happened. That's input the
AMA can't just ignore, unfortunately.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; So what do you suggest? If the AMA says they're not going to race in the
&gt;&gt; wet and will readily cancel and roll over to Monday, how do you think the
&gt;&gt; promoter will react? They'll want to have maximum effort to get the races
&gt;&gt; in, so they don't have to incur extra costs, and certainly don't want to
&gt;&gt; run the risk of having to refund tickets. That's just reality, it's a
&gt;&gt; business. So what if the promoters protest that lax attitude about
&gt;&gt; protecting their interests, do you just bail on the track, a race that is
&gt;&gt; well-attended and closest to a significant percentage of the population,
&gt;&gt; essentially the entire northeast, parts of the midwest and all of eastern
&gt;&gt; Canada? If not, what is the shutdown point? Is it like GP, you either race
&gt;&gt; on schedule or it's over? Do you have to have time to get all the races in
&gt;&gt; or you don't even try? I think it's a tough call to make.

&gt; Of course it's a tough call, but isn't that what they get paid for?
">

I'm not talking about a call on specific circumstances on the fly, I'm
talking about a predetermined policy here. So what is the best way to do
this, how much of the schedule is predetermined and not subject to any
flexibility, and how much is allowed to flex on the fly, with an effort
to result in the best outcome for all, as much as that can be
determined? Totally inflexible scheduling results in stuff like last
year's Aussie GP, when everyone went out tiptoeing around on slicks on a
damp track, knowing conditions would change shortly. The AMA isn't
nailed down so tightly by live TV considerations, so they can be much
more flexible. So how much should they show, and what is the intent? I
think that is a very tough call to make, given the very diverse
interests involved.

Look,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; for the last time, these guys/clowns have been doing this for a long, long
&gt; time and should've have made a contengency for just this sort of deal at
&gt; that track.  If the track needed an out it should've been only after the
&gt; rain date and tickets should be clearly marked no-refunds for rain out with
&gt; the make-up date right next to it. If it rained both days, oh well..
">

So you're saying the plan should have been to race on Monday if Sunday
rains out. That brings the question to how to call the rainout - you
still have to decide when to throw in the towel (on Sunday and
potentially on Monday as well), and how much racing constitutes a
completed event. If SSport and SB go off on Sunday, does everyone still
hang around for just the SStock race on Monday? If those two races are
scheduled before SB on Sunday, do you still run them in predetermined
order if there is a tight window in the forecast and it also calls for
rain on Monday, do you risk the SB race that way? I just don't think
it's as easy as you suggest, not even close.

How

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; hard is that? Picture some poor schmuck that threw down a couple hun to sit
&gt; in the wet all day just see 25 mins of racing at dusk, I'm thikin' he might
&gt; not be back for a while and qutie frankly, who could blame him? At least
&gt; with a rain date he's got the opportunity to come back, as it was, all he
&gt; got was a wet fukin'...
">

And, like most of the fans there, if he can't come back on Monday, how
happy is he going to be when mid-afternoon Sunday they call the day when
it's stopped raining and the track is drying, and he knows the best
he'll get is to tape the race and watch it after work on Monday/Tuesday?
It's not as clearcut as you seem to think.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; At MO ultimately the real problem seems to be the Bitch, and unfortunately
&gt;&gt; there's not a hell of a lot that can be done about that. But it's a
&gt;&gt; long-standing event of some importance, so definitely shouldn't be dumped.

&gt; I'm not saying dump it by any means, I am saying someone needs to take into
&gt; account recent history, though from the looks of it that's beyond the
&gt; capabilities of the current sanctioning body..
">

Isn't &quot;recent history&quot; just the last two races? I can't recall when the
last time MO was significantly impacted by rain, but it might be in
1996, when they raced in that heavy rain. It wasn't absolutely certain
that they couldn't/wouldn't race in the wet going into last year's
finale after the repave, and obviously this year's rain wasn't part of
some history that they could consult prior to this year's race. What
they do next year we'll have to see. They being everyone involved and
not just the AMA.

&gt;&gt; You're right I'm not all that wild about these guys, but I certainly think

&gt;&gt; series, says to me there isn't some big answer to it all that will make
&gt;&gt; everything wonderful. If you throw the AMA out and install some
&gt;&gt; professional dictator, then you're totally at the mercy of one ego who is
&gt;&gt; really only interested in making money. That sounds exceptionally risky at
&gt;&gt; best. We've seen a lot of stumbling in racing, from the CART vs.
&gt;&gt; IndyGeorge war that has ruined open-wheel here to the folly of the
&gt;&gt; Phlegminis that smothered WSB's growth to the GP EuroMed love affair to

So you say. But you have no objectivity at all, and would probably
prefer to have a series that had maybe only a half-dozen events, no
factory involvement, no top riders as a result, but ran half their races
at Daytona...

I really don't have any idea. But my guess would be that it is, very
roughly. If you asked me how many people die there, I would likely have
said, &quot;maybe two or three a year&quot;, which is my impression based on what
I've seen as a very casual follower over the years. I don't know if the
number of participants has changed significantly over the years, or the
miles ridden. But what safety improvements there have been can't really
overwhelm the increase in speeds, I wouldn't think.

As I've said, they got a SB race out of a difficult situation that can
be blamed on the weather and the track (insufficiently safe to run in
the wet, as determined by at least some of the racers). What they didn't
get was no racing, which is what most of them would have gotten if the
day had been called. Well, perhaps they would have been able to watch it
on TV later. Or not, if it had rained on Monday, or something else went
wrong in the process of delaying the racing a day.

And btw, let me know when you're ready to answer my direct questions

Was that the sole purpose of this race? Promoting motorcycle racing in
this country in general isn't something anyone is really doing as a
singular goal, that is made up of a bunch of activities and intentions
that make up racing and associated activities. What the AMA was doing
was sanctioning a particular race, and they had many goals in that - run
a smooth event for the participants, the fans and the promoters/track,
provide races for broadcast on TV, make some money in the process. That
isn't easy at some tracks when weather intervenes, and I don't think the
Bitch being involved makes it any better. What I don't think is that
it's close to obvious that canceling Sunday's activities in the early
afternoon with the rain stopped and with the forecast so questionable
for Monday was the thing to do. You do, but that's probably based on
20/20 hindsight (it apparently didn't rain on Monday) and intentions
(shitting on the AMA, blaming them alone for everything that doesn't go
perfectly right, as always).

I was on the road the last week, and didn't give you or your AMA BS any
