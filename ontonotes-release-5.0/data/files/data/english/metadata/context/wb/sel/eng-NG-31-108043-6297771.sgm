Justisaur's Eberron Shackled City Session 22, The Smoking Eye

Garrot - Male Human Rogue 9
Seven - Male Human Fighter 5 / Cleric 2 / Kensai 3 chain fighter
Zhray - Male Human Wizard 6 / Rainbow Servant 4
Mott - Male Gnome Sorcerer 10
Lorash - Male Human Druid 10

Again starting off with gripes about the modules.  The Demonskar
Legacy leaves off with the PCs 'stranded' in the desert.  Of course
they weren't quite stranded, the artificer (no longer with us) had
teleport, and teleported half the party away to Sassarine (which
AFAICT doesn't appear in the book, but does in the individual modules,
again a problem with the book)

However the Smoking Eye starts immediately after the demonskar legacy
leaves off - and of course I hadn't READ the Smoking Eye yet, so there
was some lag.  At one time it wasn't even available in the mags for a
couple months at least after demonskar, so it's not unreasonable to
expect some down time, but NO!

So this half demon guy, is supposed to show up and con the PCs into
doing his dirty work, and 'save' them from being stranded in the
desert, immediately after the paladin dies.  Well a day had passed,
and the party was split up at that time (both arcanists still trapped
in the mirror), so it was all messed up no matter what.  But then
that's part of a DM's job is to smooth over these messes, but there's
more.

Again the main contact here is evil, if I were playing a paladin, I'd
refuse to do anything he suggested just on principle, and this is at
least the 2nd time in the series the adventure is given to the PCs by
an evil NPC, with no way to avoid detection.  Fortunately there's no
Paladin in my group, but there is the Rainbow Servant, who is kind of
an Arcanist/Prestige paladin equivalent.  Luckily he didn't detect
evil on the half-fiend, and the half-fiend's lies were convincing(high
bluff).

So I try to fit what is supposed to happen in with the reality of what
is actually going on.  I have the half-fiend show up invis, he casts
his monster summoning 9 and summons 3 babu.  The Zhray's listen picked
up on the casting and what it was (another lapse in the module seems
to assume this will be unnoticed by the party, yet no silent spell),
and freaked out, dragging the sorcerer up to meet up with the druid,
and the sorcerer cast teleport (he learned it between sessions,
otherwise everyone would have been together, and unfortunately he
hadn't been to Sassarine before so couldn't TP there.) So he tries to
teleport to the last place he felt safe, to Cauldron (which they were
warned they shouldn't go to).  Fortunately the dice showed a miss, and
he ended up a few miles away from Cauldron instead.

I had the half-fiend try to pick them up with scrying (And here again
is bad on the module, as it says he's been scrying on them for some
time, yet it hasn't been specified in previous modules, and allowed
them their saves, and chances to notice).  After 3 tries he gets
through with the scry on Mott.  I have the babu teleport immediately,
Zhray casts Dispel on them, and 2 of the 3 he beats the caster level
check on, Mott MM's, and Lorash Manouvers into place.  The Babu puts a
little hurt on Mott, then the Half-Fiend shows up saying he's there to
help, and downs the Babu with his magic missile (Babu are pretty darn
weak for the level of summon it seems).

He tells them about the test of the smoking eye, and uses his greater
teleport to take them to Sassarine where they have no trouble finding
the only 12' tall human around and the party is together.

Lorash has about 6 weeks worth of downtime he wants, but the half-
fiend pressures the party into leaving early, after a long argument
with Seven they stay for 9 days, much more than the half-fiend wants,
but what's he going to do?

The Half-fiend fakes casting Plane Shift from a scroll badly, Zhray
picks up on the fact he's fumbling the spell badly, but they still end
up on Occipitus, and Zhray is confused by this, he may be suspecting
something, but still hasn't really brought anything up yet.  The
modules gives a specific starting point on Occipitus, but Plane Shift
is supposed to be somewhat random, I would have preferred just
dropping them at the 'random' point, but it doesn't really make any
difference to the PCs, and I could have done it easily enough, but
didn't think of it at the time.

They use Mott's teleport to shave several days off their journey
teleporting to the edge of the 'forest' of giant rib bones.  They
encounter a succubus and a half-fiend cleric 7.  Succubus charms
Seven, Cleric Blasphemys party, Party Smacks down half-fiend in one
round.  An argument broke out about charm, because Seven's player
claimed that the half-fiend is the apparent ally of the succubus, and
charm states "Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens
the charmed person breaks the spell."  I find this a bit questionable,
as you could easily assume anyone is anyone else's ally, but I gave
in, and he was free, the succubus didn't last the round.

They get to the temple, and decide to go in through a hole in the
ceiling using spider climb &amp; ropes to get up there.  Going down they
encounter another succubus &amp; noble salamander.  Lorash in polar bear
form grappled the succubus, and lost a level due to 'embracing' her
(it seems kind of cheesy, but the evil dm in me interpreted it that
way). He made the will save for her suggestion to go play with someone
his own size though.

Mott lay some nasty frosty pain down on the salamander and the
salamander retaliated nearly taking him out.  Lorash released the
succubus, and just attacked her normally, but wasn't doing much
through her DR (DR has been quite a problem for him since he got polar
bear form).  Seven finished off the salamander while Zhray &amp; the half-
fiend took out the succubus.

They went down to meet the mummy lord who was the test administrator,
heard his spiel, discussed destroying him for his phat loot, but
decided against it.  They chose to go after the Bebilith, it took them
about 3 rounds of maneuvering to get him, but it wasn't really much of
a fight, with everyone buffed knowing they were going to fight
something right through the door.  After the fight they noticed the
the half-fiend was stuck at the door, and they tried to drag him
through, but to no effect.  Zhray finally got suspicious and cast
detect evil, but he found he detected evil everywhere (not sure if I
did that right, but I figure that's what you'd get detecting for evil
on an evil plane.), so it did him no good.

Garrot got nominated to take the lantern to guide the party to the
next text, it was somewhat disconcerting because he'd just bought a
ring of blinking and was popping in and out of existence.  They
followed it's path back to the entrance of the Temple and fought the
two driders there, who proved a bit more challenging than the rest of
their fights what with their multiple lightning bolts - The first
round I did as the mod suggested having one web, and the other
lightning bolt, but web wasn't effective as Lorash had freedom of
movement up, and Seven was climbing the wall, so I changed to just
lightning bolts..  Lorash used a chain lightning (or something
similar) and did some really good damage to them, they of course
retaliated hurting him a bit.

End of session.

Other than the really bad start to this mod in the series I think the
mod has some really good ideas and an interesting change from standard
dungeon crawls.

If you don't mind my saying so, you seem to worry too much about the
letter of things to fully appreciate the spirit.

My recent airship experience might be colouring my perceptions, but why
worry about things like listen checks for the summon monster if the
half-fiend's supposed to surprise them with it? Just assume he was far
enough to make listen checks very difficult.

If the adventure says he's been scrying on the party, why worry about
their saves? They obviously failed them, if that's what the basic plot
setup demands. I mean, if the adventure setup had a barbarian king
getting killed by and killing a dragon, you wouldn't even think about
rolling damage for them to see if the king really should have killed the
dragon, right?

If the NPC contact is Evil, and there's a paladin in the party, just add
a potion of undetectable alignment in his inventory. Considering the
costs of buying one, and the potential costs of *not* buying one, it's
not unreasonable that a mid or higher level Evil schemer would have one.

Focus on the parts of the adventure that your players could be talking
about a year from now, and make them happen, rather than trying to make
everything make sense according to the rules.

No, but that doesn't involve the PCs.  The PCs have a right to have a

This is true - I do have to say at least the Module writer considered
the possibility, with a 'seeking redemption' speech (total lies, but
he's got a pretty damn good bluff). Were I playing a paladin this
might convince me.  The previous situation didn't consider this at all
though.  The players did detect him, he managed to convince them he
was under an 'evil curse' (not in the module, but hey had to think
fast).

I just find it highly irritating when module writers don't even
consider these things.

If the half-fiend and succubus were just standing around, shooting the breeze,
then maybe Seven would be right to consider them apparent allies.  If they had
any inkling at all that someone might show up to attack them -- succubi are
smart enough to know what effect the half-fiend's attack would have, and would
have arranged *not* to look like an ally.

The MM entry definitely says "kiss".  In the old days grappling a vampire
might have lost you 2 levels, but these days it's a slam attack.

It's not binary. I'm not suggesting that when the PCs say "we go left"
you say "um... no, you go right" because that's the part of the dungeon
they're supposed to explore first. But when the choice is fudging a
listen check and starting a new adventure, or letting the dice fall and
possibly having the players teleport away from the adventure only to
thing get back on the beginning some time later anyway... I think the
choice is clear.

And I'm not even thinking fudging in the sense of rolling a 3 and then
saying "I rolled 17": could the PCs have succeeded on the listen check
at -10? If not, why not just place the summoner 100 ft. away? Summon
monster IX last for at least 17 rounds, that's plenty of time to cover
100 ft. + fight. Or 200 ft. for -20. At speed 30 ft. that still leaves
you 10 rounds for the fight. Or if the PCs are really such good
listeners, just scratch over an unimportant feat and give the summoner
Sudden Silent.

I understand what you're saying, and I agree it'd be bad just to let
NPCs you want to scry on the PCs succeed automatically, and have NPCs
you don't want to scry on the PCs fail automatically.

But try to look at it in another way: by saying "yes, we want to play
The Smoking Eye" the players implicitly agreed to have been scried.
Otherwise, they wouldn't be playing The Smoking Eye. They'd be playing
an adventure where they're hunting down a mysterious half-fiend who
divinations indicated was scrying on them.

&gt; Justisaur's Eberron Shackled City Session 22, The Smoking Eye
">

I love this module.  But be aware -- played properly, it's tough.  The
final encounter sequence is a killer.

I chromed hell out of this, and I invite you to do the same.  It's the
Abyss!  It should be bizarre and scary, not just another dungeon
level.

Some examples.

1)  The PCs meet a couple of powerful demons.  By "powerful" I mean
something like a big damn glabrezu -- advanced, CR obviously at least
4 over the party.

Fortunately, the demons aren't hostile -- they're well fed and lazy
and just happen to be in a mellow mood.  They only want a toll or some
tribute, and can be amused or distracted into accepting very little.

But.  While the PCs are talking to the demons, they notice a ragged
figure polishing the demon's hooves.  A Spot check reveals that it's a
chaotic evil NPC the PCs defeated and killed.  (If they've been
playing up to 9th levely, they've surely killed any number of CE
NPCs.)

If the PCs pay any attention to the dead NPC, he begins to berate
them.  "You!  You sent me here!"

At this point the demon says something like, "Are you _talking_,
lackey?  Wait -- are you cleaning my hooves with a _rag_?  Why do you
think I let your tongue grow back?"  [seizes NPC, lifts him]  "I think
I'll rip it out again, just to teach you..."  (1)

No combat, but it should put the PCs on notice that they're in a bad
place...

2)  Occupitus was once part of Heaven.  I put an encounter with a
couple of advanced lantern archons guarding an angel's tomb.  These
guys had been in the Abyss for centuries, and were slowly dying... in
fact, I had one of them drop dead while talking to the PCs.  ("You
know the sound a light bulb makes when it blows?  Like that.  A clear
glassy sphere with a crack through it falls to the ground...")   They
can give a little background information, as long as the PCs don't
bother the tomb.  (Which, not being evil, they shouldn't.)

3)  I also added an encounter with an angel who had gone mad.  He
couldn't believe that Adimarchos had really fallen.  The conflict made
him go blind.  Adimarchus put him in a beautiful villa and told him
never to leave; the angel, being lawful, is still waiting for
Adimarchus to return and cure him.  He's only dangerous if the PCs
pick a fight, but he can't be budged from his fantasy world.

4)  I added a section where the "flesh" of Occipitus seemed to be
slowly rotting.  Disgusting, and also very dangerous -- it was a place
where an Abomination had been deployed in the war, and had fallen.  As
a result, clerical spells above first level don't work there -- the
lingering taint of the Abomination blocks the transmission of divine
power.  Not a big region, but a nasty encounter or two in there.

5)  I had the half-fiend be sincerely conflicted, and seriously
considering redemption.  The PCs suspected him at all times anyway, so
I had him befriend one of them.  (By accident... the PC happened to
save his life.)

If the half-fiend is visibly tipping back towards good (or at least
neutrality), it makes the final confrontation that much more dramatic.

It really is a good scenario.  Knock yourself out!

cheers,

Doug M.

(1)  Yes, I stole this.  Steal from the best, I say.

Doesn't really work in the situation, there's a couple indoor rooms,
surrounded by a desert.  You can't see much of the surrounding area
with scry either, although I guess he could tp in invis, and have to
make move silently to get away from the general area.

The problem is I don't usually think of these ways to fix such issues
until far after the fact, and neither do these mod writers.  When I
write my own adventures I don't seem to have these problems. I much
prefer running my own adventures, I just don't have the time to write
them right now. So it's either use some module with a bunch of
irritating lapses such as these or don't play.  And I'm certainly not
going to give up D&amp;D because I'm not entirely satisfied with the mods.

The spell was off a scroll.  Fortunately the module isn't throwing an

If that's background prior to play starting I have no issue with it,
well other than that defeating a dragon sounds more like it should be
the subject of an adventure than background, but the mod is supposed
to assume all the previous mods in the adventure path, and there is no
mention of such previously.

Not me, it's a bit farther than I'd go, but the rules do seem a bit

players down the path to that story.  I suppose that's why these going
out of bounds for sake of story, which could have been avoided with
some extra thought or changing some situations a tad, irritates me
so.

I've also got a big reluctance to change anything, and feel
constrained by what others have written as the adventure, or setting.
It probably has a lot to due with some really bad experiences with DMs
both back in the bad old days, and more recently changing things which
seem designed to make my character's experience hell.  I don't want to
have the same experience these DMs have given me happen to my players.

That's admirable. But from some of your Shackled City reports, it seems
like you're worrying too much about details to let yourself fully enjoy
the adventures.

Consider changing things not from the perspective of whether you think
it should be changed, but whether you think your players would prefer
the adventure if it were changed. If the group clicks together well
enough, you'll probably end up changing much the same things, and you'll
be looking at it not as changing things for your own benefit and
possibly screwing over the players, but as changing things for the
benefit of the game as a whole.

I haven't read quite that far yet (wish I had more time), but the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Some examples.

&gt; 1)  The PCs meet a couple of powerful demons.  By &quot;powerful&quot; I mean
&gt; something like a big damn glabrezu -- advanced, CR obviously at least
&gt; 4 over the party.

&gt; Fortunately, the demons aren't hostile -- they're well fed and lazy
&gt; and just happen to be in a mellow mood.  They only want a toll or some
&gt; tribute, and can be amused or distracted into accepting very little.
&gt; But.  While the PCs are talking to the demons, they notice a ragged
&gt; figure polishing the demon's hooves.  A Spot check reveals that it's a
&gt; chaotic evil NPC the PCs defeated and killed.  (If they've been
&gt; playing up to 9th levely, they've surely killed any number of CE
&gt; NPCs.)

&gt; If the PCs pay any attention to the dead NPC, he begins to berate
&gt; them.  &quot;You!  You sent me here!&quot;

&gt; At this point the demon says something like, &quot;Are you _talking_,
&gt; lackey?  Wait -- are you cleaning my hooves with a _rag_?  Why do you
&gt; think I let your tongue grow back?&quot;  [seizes NPC, lifts him]  &quot;I think
&gt; I'll rip it out again, just to teach you...&quot;  (1)

&gt; No combat, but it should put the PCs on notice that they're in a bad
&gt; place...
">

I like this one, I think I might change it a bit, I just can't see a
demon ever in a mellow mood.  Maybe torturing one of the PCs old foes,
and out of the perverse (quite appropriate for demons to be perverse)
invite the PCs to do some torturing too.  It might go bad, but it's
likely to be fun :)

2-4 are pretty good too.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 5)  I had the half-fiend be sincerely conflicted, and seriously
&gt; considering redemption.  The PCs suspected him at all times anyway, so
&gt; I had him befriend one of them.  (By accident... the PC happened to
&gt; save his life.)

&gt; If the half-fiend is visibly tipping back towards good (or at least
&gt; neutrality), it makes the final confrontation that much more dramatic.

I'm not sure of his true intentions, I've been playing him more
neutral than evil, but he is putting on a front and using the PCs.

Ah, I think I see your problem.

You were complaining about how this module started with the
announcement that the half-fiend had been scrying on them.  That's
fair enough -- this should have been mentioned in earlier modules.
But if you'd read ahead to this module, you could have added the
scrying yourself.

It will really improve your campaign if you read a module or two
ahead.  It sounds like right now, you're not even reading the whole
module before you start playing it.  That's... not ideal.

Throw some encounters at them.  The module definitely allows this!

Make it as weird and depressing as the players can stand.  It's the
Abyss; it's not supposed to be fun.

Example: the PCs fight a demon that's basically a column of slime
studded with staring golden eyes.  Have everyone who strikes the demon
roll saving throws.  Next day, one of the PCs has lumpy, painful boils
on one arm.  A day later, tell him "suddenly, one of the boils opens.
It looks at you.  It's a bright golden eye, staring out of the back of
your hand..."  Remove Curse may fix this strange disease, but trust
me, the PCs will remember it.

Well, "mellow" in the sense of "don't feel like killing you right

Spoilers for the end of the Smoking Eye follow.

...

When you reach that big volcano thing -- after a couple of tough
encounters -- there's a geyser of magical fire, where the plasms come
from.  You meet one last mummy lord.  He tells you there's one last
test: the Test of Sacrifice.  To show you are worthy, you must
sacrifice an ally.

At this point the half-fiend is like, yeah, sounds good to me!  And he
attacks the party, trying to force someone into the geyser with
Telekinesis, or kill all the PCs but one and throw that one in.  If he
succeeds, he gains the Smoking Eye template, which gives him several
minor powers plus the chance to eventually rule the plane.

TIf the PCs beat the half-fiend, they can throw the him in.  That
works too, and will give one PC the template... except that it's an
evil act.  (Yeah, he's an evil creature who has betrayed you, but
sacrificing an intelligent creature to gain power is just bad.)

The only way to get the template without becoming evil is for one PC
to voluntarily sacrifice *himself* and jump into the flame-geyser.
That short-circuits the test and grants the PC the template.  (Only
works once, though...)  It is also possible to say "screw it" and not
gain the template at all; this is fine, though it may lead to
complications later.

Anyway... IMC I had the half fiend cry out to one PC, "My friend!
Join me, and let us rule this plane together!"  He had really made
friends with that PC, so it wasn't completely insane... And, as it
happened, one PC (a different one) did succumb to temptation; he
grabbed another PC's cohort and threw him in!  Became evil on the
spot, of course, and then the other PCs killed him, but it helped make
a nice dramatic finale...

I just read the rest of the mod and the start of the next (and I'm
wondering how I'll entice them back to cauldron after all the emphasis
on not going back there).

*Sigh* Unfortunately my last campaign featured something similar - The
Eye of The Dragon which coincidentally was a big flame that consumed
everything that entered it used for sacrifice by the followers of The
Dragon (*THE* cosmic god in my pantheon).   If their response to this
is anything like that, it will be something along the lines of "So...
who wants to go in, we've got reincarnate."

I also find the Half-Fiend's violent betrayal out of character.  He's
manipulated the party this far, why not just manipulate one of them in
there instead of pulling out the guns (of course pulling out the guns
after he's done that)? Especially as he isn't stupid and should know
that taking on the lot of them is likely suicide.
