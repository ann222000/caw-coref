If Israel has nukes, why can't the rest?

The U.S. adopts a biased stance towards countries who possess or seek
nuclear technology or weapons, allowing states like Israel, India to
proceed without any interference, although they failed to fulfill
their commitments under the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),
while it piles the pressure on and fights others like Iran, Iraq
(before toppling Saddam Hussein) and North Korea for them not to have
nukes.

Democratic People's Republic of North Korea has recently stated it
won't accept nor allow the U.S.'s double standards in dealing with
nuclear equipped countries, according to a Korean Times report that
also stated that there will only be the prospect of settling the
nuclear issue when the United States abandons prejudiced double
standards, as North Korea demands.

The United States turns a blind eye to the nuclear threat posed by
Israel, a country believed to have the most advanced nuclear weapons
program in the Middle East, while it pressures other countries like
Iran to abandon its nuclear program or face a grim future under
possible sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council if it managed to
lobby international support against the Islamic republic.

Prime Minister David Ben Gurion established Israel's nuclear program,
centered at the Negev Nuclear Research Center, in the late 1950s,
claiming it's become essential to meet the mounting threat the Jewish
State faces from its neighbours.

Israel's possession of nuclear program that has approximately 100-200
nuclear explosive devices, together with its policy of declaratory
ambiguity stand as the core of instability and tension that has
plagued the Middle East region.

Last year Israel accepted a visit from International Atomic Energy
Agency director Mohamed ElBaradei, yet asserting it will never
consider dropping nuclear arms (although it doesn't admit to that
either) only after a comprehensive Middle Eastern peace is obtained.
It also rejected to give the international inspectors access to its
Dimona nuclear complex.

Washington aided Israel in acquiring nuclear weapons, and ignored
Japan's; knowing it's stockpiling plutonium beyond what it actually
needs so as to emerge as a nuclear power.

But America's double standards regarding nuclear weapons have become
even more blatant; permitting countries that are non-signatories of
the NPT to have nuclear programs if they transfer their nuclear
technology to the United States- It seems that Washington's stance
from nuclear armed countries has become dependant on whether a country
is or is not its ally.

Another example of America's biased approach regarding the nuclear
issue, is its stance towards Korean Peninsula.

North Korea demands America to adopt measures to treat it as it does
other non-NPT signatories that possess nuclear weapons. It seems
threatening Washington indirectly that if it insisted on its policy of
double standards and ignored N. Korea's demands, the result will
paralyze the world's nuclear non-proliferation regime and disturb
global stability.

Because that will lead to nuclear war.  Israel CANNOT allow her enemies to

Because they aren't &quot;police&quot;. They are a foreign invading illegal entity.
They can't nuke the Palestinians without destroying themselves

Your post is total bullshit. It is Israel that is the rogue state,
and it has nuclear weapons, which it has yet to come out openly
and declare to the world. If anyone is going to misuse the atomic
bomb it will undoubtedly be Israel. There is no justification for
trying to prevent other states in the Middle East from obtaining
nuclear weapons with which to protect themselves from Israel and
America.

You don't know that. It may be the truth, but it's also possible that they
don't want to wait for the day when they run out of oil and would rather not
turn back into a third-world sandpile. They have NOT violated anything,
although I don't trust them. Developing nuclear power for electricity
generation is not a criminal action nor is it in violation of any treaties,
as far as I'm aware.

Really?  One of the key provisions of the NPT is the inalienable right
to pursue nuclear power for peaceful purposes.  Do you agree with that?

Another proviso of NPT is that all signatory nations shall be obligated
to attack any nation that uses nuclear weapons on a non-nuclear power.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If Israel has nukes, why can't the rest?

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Such a moral question and it's coming from someone calling himself &quot;Death
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to Israel..Israel has no Right to Exist&quot; . The answer is that Arab
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; countries are fucked up murderers. Israel is a rational state.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The U.S. adopts a biased stance towards countries who possess or seek
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; nuclear technology or weapons, allowing states like Israel, India to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; proceed without any interference, although they failed to fulfill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; their commitments under the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT),

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Israel and India have no commitments under that treaty. They never signed
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it. Iran and the Arabs did.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So you're saying it would be a good thing for Iran to leave the treaty and
&gt;&gt; &gt; acquire an arsenal of atomic bombs and missiles in secret ... as Israel
&gt;&gt; &gt; did?

&gt;&gt; &gt; -Al-

&gt; And as India did, having acquired a Candu reactor from Canada and signing
&gt; contracts to use its' output only for peaceful purposes. Suddenly, one
&gt; morning we get to pick up our newspapers to read &quot;Surprise! We lied and
&gt; built a nuclear bomb&quot;.
">

You know what my feeling is? Any other nation has as much right to
build atomic bombs as the United States of America. Where does the
USA get off, telling other peoples what weapons they can build?
Would the US listen if Iran told them they couldn't build, say, an
unmanned, armed drone aircraft? No, they would laugh at the very
idea. As far as I'm concerned, it is just as absurd on the other foot.

Iran has stated countless times that it is not building an atomic
warhead of any kind, but, should they decide to build one, they
are within their rights as a sovereign nation of the world. They
have as much right to the bomb as Israel or America.

It's time for the arrogant pricks in Israel and America to wake up
to the reality. Effectively, the United States and Israel are
*forcing* the nations of the Middle East to seriously consider
acquiring nuclear weapons. They are forcing the hands of the Arab
states by their aggressive words and actions, along with their
constant and unceasing anti-Islamic propaganda.

Let's examine your logic, shall we? You are asserting that merely
because Israel has not yet used an atomic weapon against those it
decides are its enemies, it will not use an atomic weapon in the
future? Now that doesn't really follow, does it?

Israel has shown several nasty traits. It enjoys making aggressive
military displays against its neighbors, such as sending raiding
parties across their borders and overflying their air space. It
has no compunction against killing innocent civilians. It is
willing to use illegal methods to achieve its political ends, such
as kidnapping, torture, and assassination. It spews forth an
endless stream of virulent slanders and accusations directed at
those it targets as its foes.

If any state in the entire world is going to misuse its atomic
bombs or missiles, it will be Israel. Of that there can be little
doubt or question.

Israel is the problem. Israel is an apartheid state. Israel
routinely uses military aggression in an attempt to achieve its

assassinates, and yes, terrorizes, anyone it wishes to silence,
and does it frequently, because the one thing Israel cannot
