The Oxfordians are the greatest threat to the Stratfordians. The
Strats don't bother much with Marlowe or Bacon, Derby or Dyer,
although each of those men has something to contribute to the
Authorship Question, and each of them has contributed something to the
works of &quot;Shakespeare&quot;. That's the Gumbonian position. Consequently,
the Gumbonians listen to the theories of all the other
anti-Stratfordians, and we are mild to muse upon credit, and slow to
argue. All anti-Stratfordians, after all, have the same common enemy,
the poorly set-up Stratford man.

Even before I became a Gumbonian, even when I was an Oxfordian, or say
rather, Unorthodoxfordian, I spent many words and many years talking
the HLAS talk, wasting and devouring Strats, but I never said aught
against my brothers and sisters devoted to Marlowe, Bacon, or any of
the other anti-Strats. We are all of a family, that's how I see it,
all of us with the chief agenda of proving that the Stratford man is a
worthless candidate to be &quot;Shakespeare&quot;, and it does us no good to
fight amongst ourselves, all will get a dip into the Gumbo by and by,
&quot;Shakespeare&quot; was no single man.

Elizabeth Weir is a Baconian, and she joins in the fight against the
Stratford, man, of course, and promotes her man. But even more than
her hits at the Strats, she hits at Oxford, and in such a quantity of
posts that you might think she was a closet Stratfordian. She seldom
mentions Derby, Marlowe, or Dyer, but puts most of her energy into
bringing down Oxford. She knows his history intimately, giving us more
of his history than she gives us of Bacon. For whole posts together
she doesn't even mention Bacon, and she seldom promotes him in detail,
at least in the way of offering anything that hasn't been said many
times before.

For example, these selections below, taken from the past two months.
Is it only jealousy of the Oxfordian ascendancy that she carries her
banner and torch against Oxford? The Oxfordians might even allow some
of the Baconian arguments, and the Gumbonians certainly do, Bacon was
in the thick of the gumbo, how could it be otherwise? But why is she
so angry about the Oxfordians, and why should she use so much time
attacking Oxford, the Stratfordians greatest enemy, their greatest
threat?

Weir's attacks on Oxford, furthermore, are not at all original, but
are mere re-hashings of the Kathman/Ross web site. It's all been
heard before from Knave, Nathan, Kathman, Ross, Groves, J.W. Kennedy,
Reynolds, and so forth. Why doesn't Weir let those guys carry on the
work , she adds nothing, and could devote herself entirely to Bacon.
If Kathman says, for example, that Oxford was a bastard for this or
that reason, Weir doesn't rest until she says &quot;Amen&quot; and gives us some
detailed information of this or that, evidently quite intimate with
Oxfordian arguments and the man's history, spending more time
elucidating his failures rather than promoting her own man, who she
forgets for days at a time. Also, her criticism of the Stratfordians
is, for the most part temperate, usually bounced off some insult to
Oxford.

It's a strange thing, and you must discern it for yourself. The
Gumbonian opinion is that she doesn't care if Bacon is in the gumbo or
not, she has no great interest in promoting the man, but has a much
greater interest in demoting Oxford. I've taken from her posts,
below, randomly, out of context, selectively and with all the other
faults that might be laid, but the reader will understand that her
chief agenda is to GET OXFORD. These post all taken from 2003. Gather
and surmise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

By Elizabeth Weir:

You can't prove anything conclusively with sociology or biography
although Strats and Oxfordians never stop trying.

Nelson definitely proves his case against Oxford's authorship with 70+
letters in which Oxford phonetically spells in his thick East Anglican
dialect--I'm not kidding--but Nelson then tries to make the opposite
case for the Burgher--that the runaway arrived in London with a
Warwickshire accent but unlike poor Oxford, dropped it literally
overnight to write Henry IV in university English.

Looney goes for the Stratfordian cheap shot. Freud, of course,
supported Oxford because Looney's theory is fundamentally Freudian: &gt;
[Looney} stressed that: &quot;it is not from intentional self-disclosure &gt;
that we should expect to discover the author, but from more &gt; or less
unconscious indications of himself in the writings...&quot; This is
classic. Looney doesn't seem to be aware that he has unconsciously
assigned the plays to Oxford. And his argument is a form of the
petitio principii argument in which the premises are used to prove the
conclusion. A priori Oxford wrote the plays therefore anything in the
plays can be used a posteriori to prove that Oxford wrote the plays.

Oxfordians have never attempted to connect Oxford to the mask. What's
Petzold's problem?

At no point do Oxford's own manuscripts demonstrate an &quot;adept
knowledge&quot; of medicine, art, music, geography and law and there is no
&quot;nonchalant use of metaphor&quot; in Oxford's *OWN* writings, in fact I did
not spot one metaphor. I beg you, Art. Go to Oxford's letters and try
to find a metaphor. Oxford was not even adept at sedition. And if
Jacobi were to read Oxford's own documents he would note that Oxford
*did not, in fact, survive at Court.*

To be replaced by the Oxfordian non-documented blather.

I don't see how Oxfordians can call themselves Oxfordians when they
refuse to read their own claimaint's documents. It's really
unbelievable. Strats hole up in their truncated distortion of the
Renaissance and Oxfordians won't read their own claimant's documents.
Technically, &quot;Oxfordians&quot; are nothing more than Looneyites because ALL
THEY HAVE READ IS LOONEY. And the Ogburnian parody of Looney.

As far as I know, of the Catholic aristocracy, only Oxford ducked out
on the Anglo-Spanish War.

Oxford was not raised in the rich milieu of language, intellectuality
and wit to which Francis Bacon was exposed. Oxford spent his critical
stage of development at Hedingham among the ruffians that John De Vere
kept as courtiers.

In fact Oxford's high rank eliminates Oxford from Shakespeare
authorship. Oxford's rank was too high to seek patronage Pembroke or
Southampton. Oxford was entitled to seek patronage only from Elizabeth
or James. Oxford would have had to write &quot;down&quot; to Southampton but the
rhetoric of rank of the V &amp; A and Lucrece indisputably indicate that
the writer was writing &quot;up.&quot; rhetoric of the V &amp; A and Lucrece
dedications is definitely &quot;up.&quot; Only Bacon's rank and his
approximation to Southampton in the Essex circle is appropriate to the
exacting language of the V &amp; A and Lucrece dedications. Oxford would
be compelled to &quot;write down to his patron&quot; and that, of course, would
be oxymoronic.

It's possible that John De Vere &quot;attended the most important events&quot;
but there's no record that he brought young Oxford along. Oxford would
have had to live in London to lose his local dialect and speak English
like a courtier. Nelson has posted the evidence that Oxford had a
rustic provincial dialect all his life. Oxford could not have written
the urbane English of the Shakespeare works.

The Jesuits still hold the record of Oxford's reconciliation to the
Roman Church. That pretty much eliminates Oxford as the author of the
Protestant Shakespeare works, for for that matter as the annotator of
the Folger Geneva Bible.

One of the Oxfordian websites--I believe the one that analyses
Oxford's shortage of votes for the Garter-- states that Oxford was not
at Court after the Armada. Nelson has an excerpt from his book on
Burghley's attempt to repair Oxford's damaged reputation with a
propaganda campaign.

From 1571 until 1588 Oxford received votes from his fellow noblemen in
varying numbers for the Order of the Garter. Beginning with the first
post-Armada election, however, support for Oxford collapsed utterly:
he received not a single vote between 1588 and 1604.

Oxford never stopped writing letters in provincial vernacular. Nelson
argues in another chapter that the fact that Oxford never mastered the
English of the Court eliminates Oxford from Shakespeare authorship.

The HLAS challenge to Oxfordians to put up the evidence that connects
Oxford to the Shakespeare works is still standing.

There is no evidence that Oxford was a genius and plenty of
documentation in Oxford's own hand to the contrary. There is no
evidence [evidence defined as some visible proof or a credible
witnesses] that Oxford authored the Shakespeare works.

Oxfordians have been victimized by amateur scholarship for the past
eighty years.

That's a myth perpetuated by ignorant Strats and Oxfordians.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

All of this over a short two months time, and not as much is said
about Bacon. Maybe it's only jealousy that she carries on against
Oxford so constantly. Regarding Oxford, She talks like a Stratfordian
and walks like a Stratfordian, and one wonders. I prefer to think
she's only jealous, and if so it is very misplaced scholarship, as if
she would like to incite the Oxfordians to reply, as if she would like
to distract all anti-Strats from the real fight and get them fighting
together. I'm not going to fight with her, maybe some Oxfordian would
enjoy it, Gumbonians are easy that way, but we do like to keep track
of the advertisements, and the invitations to mud-wrestling. Here is
Weir a couple of days ago, having a go at her chief enemy, the
Oxfordians.

&quot;It's always amusing to see Oxfordians like yourself turn up your nose
at Oxford's own biographical data while at the same time you are
smitten with the Oxford you extract from his cousin Francis Bacon's
genius works. You really don't like the real Oxford much.&quot;

John Bede is a Baconian also, but quite a different sort than
Elizabeth Weir. For the most part, he tends his own garden and salts
no others except for the ugly growth the Stratfordians have growing
and going to seed. He's also a good writer, a careful thinker, a
gentleman in discourse with others, and a man worthy of respect who
tends to the Gumbonian Heresy, as you will see. Here are some
selections from recent posts, with your Editor's comments added.

&quot;My theory is that Bacon, who was deeply involved in theatre
activities from the start, constructed an ideal extra existence for
himself creating a better dramatic world for the stage in which he
channeled his experience of the world. He certainly got bruised by his
dealings with debatable men like Essex and James, and it's a deeply
hurt and bitter man who writes plays like Lear, Timon and Coriolanus.
Creating this philosophical world for the stage was his way of keeping
his nose clean after all, or at least his soul, for posterity.&quot;

Editor: This serves as a reason that Bacon held himself from
discovery, and it's a good reason.

&quot;Oxford comes closest as another personality answering approximately
to the &quot;Shake-Speare&quot; character, but he falls far behind Bacon's
universality, while there is no sign whatever of Marlowe or Derby or
Shakspere having had any such endowment. Bacon is the only possible
&quot;Shake-Speare&quot; candidate, or you'll have to prove me wrong.&quot;

Editor:A nice bow towards the Oxfordians, a reasoned critique, and not
at all like the heaped insults that Weir lays on the Edward de Vere.

&quot;The problems of Oxford is not only his premature death in 1604. To
me, his major problem is his isolation. In order to write plays like
those of Shake-Speare, you have to associate on a daily basis with
actors, theatre life and town life. You can't sit alone out in the
country with only wine and dreams for company without seeing anyone,
which seems to have been how the earl of Oxford spent the last ten
years of his life. Bacon did spend his entire life in the hub of
London public and political life and in court, so his life does
provide the perfect setting for the outlook of Shake-Speare the
clandestine dramatist, who could not write in his own name.&quot;

Editor: That's the spirit, you see, and a good direction for a
Baconian to take. And once again, his comments about Oxford are
without spite, different from Elizabeth Weir. Perhaps this is only a
matter of style, but it is quite evident that Bede has no such
eagerness to tear at Oxford's faults and the wounds of his reputation.

&quot;That reason is also given for Oxford's possible later authorship,
while Marlowe is given a very different reason. But it's perfectly
clear from the plays and poems that the author must have been a
nobleman and intimate with nobility and royalty. Only Oxford/Derby and
Bacon fit that picture.&quot;

Editor: Obviously so, and stated without rancor, which Bede reserves
only for the Stratford man. Speaking of Arden of Feversham, Bede
says:

&quot;All the same, Bacon could have had interest in Kentish crimes since
he was a lawyer. So although more reasons speak for Marlowe here than
for Bacon, it's not excluded that Bacon could have written &quot;Arden of
Feversham&quot; - and, according to your reasoning, in that case also of
all of Marlowe's and Shakespeare's works.&quot;

Editor: A generous allowance. Marlowe might have written the play in
question, not Bacon, and allowing such a case, Bede is slipping into
Gumboism.

&quot;You have allowed the very knowledgeable Elizabeth Weir to lead you
astray in her very muddled arguments. That's the basic problems of
Baconianism: the research area is so vast, that it's fairly impossible
not to get lost in the maze.&quot;

Editor: A criticism of Elizabeth Weir. She IS very knowledgeable, but
she spends it all on ripping up Oxford. Her arguments for Bacon are
seldom offered, and, as Bede notes, she isn't much help to the case.

&quot;(Bacon) probably learned much from Oxford, who was his relative and
senior predecessor in dramatic poetry, but there is nothing at all of
Shakespeare in the others. And of course, either Bacon or Oxford (or
perhaps both together) wrote Marlowe.&quot;

&quot;These very interesting arguments fit perfectly into both the Oxford
and the Bacon picture.&quot;

Editor: A good Gumbonian thing to say, and John Bede will find the
application forms in the foyer. Services at 8:30 a.m. the first
Sunday of every other month. Happy hour is 4 to 6 p.m. every day.

We agree on that point. Oxfordians have the momentum.

As far as the rest of your post is concerned, I'll take action
on your positive sugestion that I post more on Bacon. I found
a posts from Groves with an assertion to the effect that
&quot;there are complexities in the plays but no philosphy.&quot;

Strats are maddening because they will write volumes on
the philosophies in the plays while denying that there are
any philosophies in the plays.

As to the rest of this post, you appear to be trying to supress
my right to free speech and debate in this forum, you made at

*debates* completely out of context and organized them into
a Bill of Indictment against me as if this were some medieval
Inquisition.

Stop trying to protect and coddle Oxford. Burghley did that
for years and in the end his heart was broken. Let Oxford take
it like a man. If Oxford authored the Shakespeare works, his
authorship will be recognized on its own merit.

Here's how it stands so far. Elizabeth says she is a Baconian, but she
hardly ever says anything about Bacon. She says she is an
anti-Stratfordian, but she has nothing but boilerplate to offer on
that account, and the Strats can ignore her about that. Her chief
intent is to attack Oxford. That's her mission at this place. Here's
the proof only slightly, bad-mouthing Oxford, and she calls the
Stratford man an &quot;affable country swain&quot; in comparison. She walks
like a Stratfordian and she talks like a Stratfordian. Oxford is the
Stratfordians biggest threat, and she hates him. Besides all, she has
recently taken up Alan Nelson's book to prove out that Oxford is as
bad as she says he is. Here she is, all spite and fume, Oxford
disturbing her bloomers:

Elizabeth vs. Oxford

Nelson definitely proves his case against Oxford's authorship with 70+
letters in which Oxford phonetically spells in his thick East Anglican
dialect

Looney goes for the Stratfordian cheap shot.

A priori Oxford wrote the plays therefore anything in the plays can be

What difference does it make who wrote the plays as long as it isn't
Oxford?

Oxford's messy life seems to be indexed all over the plays.

The Oxfordian theory doesn't account for the fact that Oxford was
widely loathed

The Earl kept two poets on his payroll--one of them was no less than
Anthony Munday. All we know with all certainty is that the Earl
indicted himself for ignorance by signing his illiterate letters with
his own name.

(Oxford was) a loathesome wife abusing child abandoning syphlitic
pederast--correction--eyebrow plucking syphlitic
pederast--correction--semi-literate eyebrow plucking syphlitic
pederast Oxford.

I'm not particularly eager to sink the HMS Stratford since the
alternative is Oxford.

No, Elizabeth, I don't think only Oxford wrote the works, but for a
long time I've asked for civility between debaters, and, I believe,
context be damned, that a lady should not use language like calling
Oxford &quot;a loathesome wife abusing child abandoning syphlitic
pederast--correction--eyebrow plucking syphlitic
pederast--correction--semi-literate eyebrow plucking syphlitic
pederast.&quot;

And no, Elizabeth, I wouldn't suppress such speech, but it does
suggest to me that you are a woman with a mean streak, and not a lady.
Furthermore, what you say in the line quoted is the usual
Stratfordian slander. If you dislike them, don't speech as they
speech.

There's no intellectual achievement in saying such things, besides
which, like it or not, this Oxford that you detest was in the midst of
the Elizabethan literary and theatrical world, along with his cousin
Bacon, who also had his faults, and some similar to Oxford, I think
you'll agree.

You end your post by saying, &quot;If Oxford authored the Shakespeare works
his authorship will be recognized on its own merit.&quot; Exactly so, and
let us not talk about Bacon's sex life either, or the other things.
The Gumbonians are tolerant that way, and to quote Alice Roosevelt,
&quot;As long as they don't do it in the street and frighten the horses.&quot;

Maybe Weir IS an anti-Strat, and maybe she considers that they are
finished, and that's an agreement we could have. Therefore, only one
person stands in the way of getting Bacon back in business, which is
to get some turds into Oxford's pocket, and she works at that. Good
for Bacon, that's the Gumbonian opinion, he's been off the chart for
some time now, and no doubt he was close to the secret and anonymous
literature of the day, but Weir is greedy about it, and wants Bacon to
have it all, and that's the sort of grabbing for spoils that
Gumbonians don't like.

Weir often dumps on Looney and Ogburn, but without reflection that the
Authorship Question was all but dead before those men got their books
out, and Bacon was long a-moldering, with absolutely no way to get him
revived. It was the Oxfordians who brought the Question back on
stage, and she should thank them, not despise them, but her nature
seems to be different from that, jealous and clutching, I would say.
She reminds me of Nina Green that way.

She actually can't STOP thinking about it, especially the Oxfordian
position. Also she says:

&quot;Here are the restored edits which contain no facts, only smears of
Baconians.&quot;

Oh, let's not smear anyone. See below, Weir's barnyard language about
Oxford, the gist of it being that Oxford had a &quot;swinish lifestyle,&quot;
and &quot;buggered boys&quot;, and the young Bacon also, yes indeed, Oxford was
a &quot;pederast&quot; and a &quot;killer.&quot; Read all about it. She hates Oxford,
sincerely, but without the PR, the magazine articles and the coming to
him by many smart people, Elizabeth Weir would be mumbling to herself
on some newsgroup about the Baconian ciphers.
Well, here's some more of her smear:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Oxford is elminated because there was no way that Oxford would ever be
anything but the highest peer in the realm and for Oxford to use his
law degree to make a living would utterly unthinkable in that culture.
Never happen.

The sonnets Peter posted can't have anything to do with Oxford. In
what conceivable way could &quot;public means and public manners' have
touched Oxford?

fawning about blood and title in the Sonnets essentially eliminates
Oxford.

The 17th earl, a peerless peer, had pissed it all away.

Shakespeare and Oxford are unqualified for authorship

Oxford was maintaining his swinish lifestyle on a thousand pounds.

Aubrey reported that Oxford liked boys and gave a graphic description
of a sweaty and panting Oxford coming in the back door after buggering
one of the kitchen boys.

Oxford was a pederast. Bacon wasn't. I have suspicions that Oxford was
the sexual predator of younger wards living in Burghley's house.

I don't know if Oxford traumatized the younger Bacon sexually but
predilection and opportunity was present.

The idea of Oxford as the author of the Sonnets nauseates me so I
haven't looked into it.

Terry Ross's authorship site has a fairly complete compilation of the
evidence against Oxford authorship but Ross has missed an argument
that disqualifies Oxford as a candidate.

From the Oxfordian point of view--I don't think Oxford could draft an
intelligible begging letter for a monopoly on herring. Oxford has to
be held to the same standard of scruitiny as the other candidates.

Oxfordians can dip from Ogburn's poisoned well.

Oxfordianism is just another *ideological system.*

I think Strats need to come up with a catchy name for Oxford's
Unspeakable Sin and start doing some PR because naive people will be
powerfully attracted to 'Oxford's Shakespeare Bible' and the
Oxfordians are already winning the PR war. If the Strats don't act on
this NAMBLA will claim the Shakespeare works and then where will
Westerm culture be?

Southampton was, however, an inner member of the literary-political
faction that hated Oxford.

The Oxfordian and Strat positions are so untenable that I don't bother
thinking about it.

The Oxfordians have no evidence.

The Ogburns used a particular style of rhetoric in 'Star of England'
that is calculated to suck your brains out.

Oxford was ridiculed by the Leicester-Sidney-Essex-Pembroke faction
into seclusion,

Oxfordians have no evidence. Looney was wrong. Biography is not
evidence and the fact that Bacon's biography is superior in every
sense to Oxfords proves it.

It's about evidence. Oxford has zero, Bacon has huge circumstantial
evidence-- overwhelming—

Oxford was out killing peasants for sport, Shakespeare was holding
horses for gentlemen and Bacon was in his study writing the plays.

I made a comparison between Nina Green and Elizabeth Weir, and I
think it holds.

Elizabeth doesn't want to share anything. She wants EVERYTHING by
&quot;Shakespeare&quot;, poems and plays alike, to be written by Bacon.

Nina also wants EVERYTHING by &quot;Shakespeare&quot; to be written by Oxford,
and that's the likeness of the ladies.

Both ladies have immense reference, you can't name a book they don't
know.

They are like twin Scroogesses in that desk-bound way, more time than
reason, and more information than good sense.

But Nina wants more than that. She has what is called the &quot;Super
Oxford Theory,&quot; and she claims also for Oxford the works of Greene,
Nash, Lily, Munday, Marlowe, Chapman, Golding, Beaumont, and several
others ALL TO BE THE WORK OF OXFORD.

The Gumbonians despise stingy people. All should be patient, all will
get their deserts, no need to claim the lion's share before the
buffalo is dead. No need to carry on like spotted hyenas, but relax,
grab an intestine, there will be enough to feed all, and the world of
literature will be satisfied if such as Nina and Elizabeth can curb
their appetites.

The Stratfordians are going down, don't worry about it. If Oxford was
established as the sole author, the one and only &quot;Shakespeare&quot; of the
mystery, it would be the worse thing to happen because they are the
most powerful of the candidates and they would turn into some sort of
Oxfordian Empire, just squat there and shit on everyone else, like the
Stratfordians have been doing for a long time, and such as Elizabeth
dumps on Oxford, and Knave, John Kennedy, Reynolds, Kathman, etc. dump
on everyone.

The Gumbonians are fearful that there is a sort of piggishness
working with these single authorship theories. Not much equality, not
much sharing, no charity amongst them, constant oinking,
mud-wrestling, and cobbish behavior at the trough. Meanwhile, for
those who are worthy and have nice manners, clean hands and
fingernails, the Gumbonian Heresy has Bishop-pricks up for grabs.

This pissed off piece of prose comes up now and then, and I'm happy to
explain it once more. Someone, and Webb is a prime suspect, was
posting under my name, which is quite a different thing from calling
names on someone dead and unable to defend himself (Weir on Oxford,
for example). But the person posting under my name stopped doing it
just as I was getting my cyber-cops on his case. Besides that, I have
never wanted to be a lady.

Other than this quoted example, I have indeed been finiky about the
abussive language used by the anti-Strats. Let the correct argument be
made, and this applies to Webb as well -- forget the name-calling, it
does no good for your argument, but if some asshole publishes under
your name, all bets are off. Here's what I said to some certain
asshole doing that, and I'm sure every word will be approved by the
fair-minded. I wrote this several years ago:

&quot;Maybe Grumman wants to enter the contest, which is to guess at the
Zensearch Kennedy. He says he has an opinion, and let us hear what it
is. And, as he says, I must confess that I have long time disturbed
the Stratfordians at this place. Zensearch has been disturbed down to

till his eyes goggle, his brains gurggle and his sinus spouts ratshit,
believe it.&quot;

Now,what Webb must do is to find some language such as the above
directed at a known person, or find that I have said such things about
the man from Stratford, which can't be done, and so Webb will now shut
his mouth on the subject,fearful that I'll post some several pages of
quotes from his foul mouth. Come on Webb, let's get into it.

STALKLING-HORSE. 1. a horse or a figure like a horse behind which the
hunter stalks game. 2. something used to mask a purpose. 3. a
candidate put forward to divide the opposition or to conceal someone's
real candidacy. -- Webster's Collegiate Dictionary

This is my feeling about Elizabeth Weir. She rarely mentions her man,
Bacon, and what she has to say can be got out of any 19th century book
about the man. Her chief purpose is to get at Oxford, and she uses
the most nasty language in doing so, as we have seen, never mentioning
that her slander of De Vere mirrors the slander that could be brought
against Bacon.

Not that the Gumbonians would reject Bacon entirely. He was
intimately involved with the principals of the day, close to the court
and a student of history. He was an excellent writer, and likely was
a contributor to the &quot;Shakespeare&quot; canon. Marlowe also, and Derby and
the rest, and Spenser as well, which is seldom investigated. More
than those choice ingredients, there were men of little account who
also claimed to be Shakespeare,&quot; or &quot;W.S,&quot; or &quot;Wm. Sh.,&quot; or whatever.
One third of the plays that have been given to &quot;Shakespeare&quot; at one
time or another, have been dropped out, and most recently, as we have
seen with the &quot;Funeral Elegy,&quot; and the &quot;Shall I Die&quot; poem, there are
men of large ambition, but with no poetic ear, who are still trying
shove something new down our scholarly gullets.

The Stratfordians have not yet taken their defeat seriously. They
need a smoking gun, and there is no smoking gun, not for anyone.
There is a steaming pot of Gumbo, but no smoking gun, which is both
testeronical and phalliconian, and the Gumbonian opinion is that there
were some women writing under the cover of &quot;Shakespeare&quot; also, and
any fixation on a single male writer to be the great poet will lock up

there are women in the mystery, women as writers, women who also, in
some part more or less, passed under the name of &quot;Shakespeare&quot;,
tomatoes and spice for the pot.

(This last paragraph is the gist of the speech I gave to the
Gumbonian Thrift Store ladies, the original was much more detailed,
with mention of the Countess of Pembroke, Anne Cecil, the Dark Lady of
the Sonnets, George Elliot, etc. Afterwards I took questions and
picked up two pairs of socks that were brand new.)

&gt; I made a comparison between Nina Green and Elizabeth Weir, and I
&gt; think it holds.

&gt; Elizabeth doesn't want to share anything. She wants EVERYTHING by
&gt;&quot;Shakespeare&quot;, poems and plays alike, to be written by Bacon.

&gt; Nina also wants EVERYTHING by &quot;Shakespeare&quot; to be written by Oxford,
&gt; and that's the likeness of the ladies.

&gt; But Nina wants more than that. She has what is called the &quot;Super

&gt; others ALL TO BE THE WORK OF OXFORD.

Oxford dramatist secretaries: Munday &amp; Lyly had nothing but praise for

Oxford &amp; Orazio Cogno, the Italian Choirboy

&lt;&lt;In 1580-81,in letters directed to members of the Privy Council, Henry
Howard &amp; Charles Arundel accused Oxford, among numerous other crimes
including multiple instances of pederasty, of having sodomized an
Italian servant of his named Auratio or HORATIO, who, they reported, had
left Oxford's employ without Oxford's permission, citing sexual abuse
as his reason. The identity of this Italian servant and many details
of his life with Oxford are verified by a deposition which he gave to
the Inquisition on 27 August 1577, shortly after his return to Venice.

Bacon is allowed, that's the Gumbonian way, the name of &quot;Shakespeare&quot;
on a title page, as we've seen, is a very thin way to determine
Elizabethan authorship. Elizabeth Weir will agree with this, the name
was a cover for those who wished to be unknown. Weir wants Bacon to
have it all, however, which is a serious error, and greedy, but for a
moment we'll pretend that whenever we see the name of &quot;Shakespeare&quot;,
it's Bacon in the closet.

Here's a serious question. Was Bacon also the actor noted in the cast
of Jonson's &quot;Sejanus&quot; and &quot;Everyman in his Humour&quot;? And was he the
principal actor in the &quot;Works,&quot; for he's first on the list of players?
Or is there any evidence that Bacon was an actor at all?

And yet I don't think that Bacon is of much interest to Weir. He's a
skulled Stratfordian, maggoty-pated, as the phrase goes, and wants
Oxford out of the question, therefore all that nasty language.
However, if the question posed can be answered even by Weir, who
doesn't give a damn about Bacon after all, it would be interesting to
know that answer. Was Bacon really an actor in those two plays by
Jonson? Gumbonians wonder.

Poe, Edgar Allan - Selected Works ** ON BOARD BALLOON &quot;SKYLARK&quot;

This Corner Stone of a Monument to
The Memory of
GEORGE WASHINGTON
Was Laid With Appropriate Ceremonies
on the
19th Day of October, 1847
The Anniversary of the Surrender of
Lord Cornwallis
to General Washington at Yorktown
A. D. 1781
Under the Auspices of the
Washington Monument Association of
the City of New York

This, as I give it, is a verbatim translation done by Pundit
himself, so there can be no mistake about it. From the few words
thus preserved, we glean several important items of knowledge, not the
least interesting of which is the fact that a thousand years ago
actual monuments had fallen into disuse- as was all very proper- the
people contenting themselves, as we do now, with a mere indication
of the design to erect a monument at some future time; a
corner-stone being cautiously laid by itself &quot;solitary and alone&quot;
(excuse me for quoting the great American poet Benton!), as a
guarantee of the magnanimous intention. We ascertain, too, very
distinctly, from this admirable inscription, the how as well as the
where and the what, of the great surrender in question. As to the
where, it was Yorktown (wherever that was), and as to the what, it was
General Cornwallis (no doubt some wealthy dealer in corn). He was
surrendered. The inscription commemorates the surrender of- what? why,
&quot;of Lord Cornwallis.&quot; The only question is what could the savages wish
him surrendered for. But when we remember that these savages were
undoubtedly cannibals, we are led to the conclusion that they intended
him for sausage. As to the how of the surrender, no language can be
more explicit. Lord Cornwallis was surrendered (for sausage) &quot;under
the auspices of the Washington Monument Association&quot;- no doubt a
charitable institution for the depositing of corner-stones.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;maggoty-headed&quot; Aubrey. Hobbes made a career out of

Here Elizabeth Weird AGAIN attributes her own final sentence to her
interlocutor! That someone who routinely posts moronic misattributions
of her OWN WORDS believes that she has unusual insight into literary
attributions from the early 1600s must be one of the most breathtaking
delusions of grandeur to be found on Usenet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We can just appeal to Aubrey's corroborative eye witness:

"/>

Since Aubrey was born some two decades after Oxford's death, one can
scarcely rely upon his &quot;corroborative eye witness,&quot; as should be quite
evident to all but the most incorrigibly ignorant. Elizabeth has issued
a credible challenge to Stephanie Caruana (who opined that Caxton was
Shakespeare's contemporary) and Art Neuendorffer (who thinks that Virgil
predated Herodotus) for primacy among the initiates of the Caruana Club
for the Chronologically Clueless.

If Elizabeth Weird will take a look at Nelson's web page, she will
find that the libel is ascribed to Charles Arundel. Of course, the
circumstance that both surnames share the same initial letter is all
that is required for someone of Elizabeth Weird's rare degree of
incompetence to confuse the two men. Even the hapless, hilarious
Stephanie Caruana, whose now-legendary dysfunctional memory is one of
the Seven Wonders of HLAS, generally manages to confine her comic
confusions to persons who share the same surname. It's official:
Elizabeth was dethroned Stephanie. Long live her Reign of Error!

Her &quot;mistake&quot;? Singular? There are at least three blatantly
obvious, hilarious howlers in Elizabeth Weird's post:

(1) Her misattribution of her own words to Peter Groves,

(2) Her riotously funny belief that Aubrey, who was born some two
decades after Oxford's death, could have been a &quot;corroborative eye
witness&quot; to Oxford's putative pederasty, and

(3) Her misattribution of Arundel's words to Aubrey.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Webb has no imagination.

"/>

If Elizabeth means that I don't wantonly invent complete crap and
announce is as fact, then she is quite right -- I am thankful that I am
devoid of that kind of &quot;imagination.&quot; Amusing instances of what
Elizabeth evidently takes to be &quot;imagination&quot; -- her invention of
idiotic crap trimphantly proclaimed as fact -- are numerous, but here
are a few personal favorites:

(1) &quot;The term 'shake-scene' was Elizabethan theatre slang for the
factotum who toted scenery around between acts.&quot;

(2) &quot;Southampton was overly fond of drag and used to hang about the
theatres hoping to play female roles. He was given a few parts
and was apparently very convincing as a girl.&quot;

(3) &quot;Verulam means 'state of truth' in Latin....&quot;

(4) &quot;Russell won [the Nobel Prize] for literature because there is no
Nobel for mathematics.&quot;

(5) &quot;Not a coincidence that Minkowski's spacetime is hyperbolic
geometry....&quot; [To be fair, this could possibly be a truly farcical
misunderstanding arising from utter ignorance rather than a wholesale
invention like the others.]

(6) &quot;...the program that he [Penn Leary] wrote to find cyphers
throughout the plays is the same defective program the so-called 'Bible
Code' uses.&quot;

(7) Elizabeth's entire post initiating the thread entitled &quot;Shakespeare
Caught Taking Payoff&quot; is too long to reproduce here, but it is available
at

&lt;&gt;.

From the standpoint of pure invention (and pure lunacy), it is one of
the undisputed classics of h.l.a.s., affording belly laughs in nearly
every line. [To be fair, these delusions could possibly arise from
hallucinations rather than from wholesale invention like the others.]

Elizabeth's own confession in regard to her pure invention is
strikingly candid: &quot;I don't have 400 years of wrong-headed 'scholarship'
to draw on. Sometimes I have to cook from scratch.&quot; Virtually
everything she posts appears to be what she calls &quot;cooking from
scratch.&quot; Yet again I am reminded forcefully of Pushkin's poem &quot;Ne dai

Purely out of charity. Of course, Peter knows far better than to
assume that Elizabeth Weird knows what she is talking about in ANY
subject, from languages to relativity, but I suspect that he can be
excused for such a provisional assumption on the same grounds that I
plead: first, I am an optimist, and hence find the alternative -- that
such extremes of apparently irremediable ignorance and/or stupidity
actually exist -- unpalatable; second, such extremes of incompetence are
difficult even to imagine, particularly for someone like Peter who
probably works with reasonably bright, educable students.

Then how on earth could Aubrey have furnished &quot;corroborative eye

&gt;&gt; We can just appeal to Aubrey's corroborative eye witness:
&gt; Now here I will admit to the inexplicable error of having momentarily
&gt; assumed that you knew what you were talking about and could distinguish
&gt; between (say) the names Aubrey and Arundel (I realise it's tricky, in that
&gt; they begin with the same letter, which must have thrown you).

If you were a careful reader, Groves, you would notice that I
wrote not &quot;Aubrey&quot; but &quot;Aubrey's.&quot;&quot;Aubrey's corroborative

A &quot;second party.&quot; I put the citation on Arundel the

What on earth does the lesser Kennedy think that Elizabeth is doing?!
She's doing exactly that, even WITH the benefit of Oxfordians' promotion

However, Kennedy redeems himself below by posting some of Elizabeth

vouch for their accuracy; however, several are so funny that I just
cannot bring myself to snip them:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well, here's some more of her smear:
&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---
&gt; --

&gt; Oxford is elminated because there was no way that Oxford would ever be
&gt; anything but the highest peer in the realm and for Oxford to use his
&gt; law degree to make a living would [sic] utterly unthinkable in that culture.
&gt; Never happen [sic].

&gt; The sonnets Peter posted can't have anything to do with Oxford. In
&gt; what conceivable way could &quot;public means and public manners' have
&gt; touched Oxford?

&gt; fawning about blood and title in the Sonnets essentially eliminates
&gt; Oxford.

&gt; The 17th earl, a peerless peer, had pissed it all away.

&gt; Shakespeare and Oxford are unqualified for authorship

&gt; Oxford was maintaining his swinish lifestyle on a thousand pounds.

&gt; Aubrey reported that Oxford liked boys and gave a graphic description
&gt; of a sweaty and panting Oxford coming in the back door after buggering
&gt; one of the kitchen boys.

&gt; Oxford was a pederast. Bacon wasn't. I have suspicions that Oxford was
&gt; the sexual predator of younger wards living in Burghley's house.

&gt; I don't know if Oxford traumatized the younger Bacon sexually but
&gt; predilection and opportunity was present.

"/>

Here Elizabeth displays the colorful, if lurid, imagination that
informs Mr. Streitz's funniest work.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The idea of Oxford as the author of the Sonnets nauseates me so I
&gt; haven't looked into it.

&gt; Terry Ross's authorship site has a fairly complete compilation of the
&gt; evidence against Oxford authorship but Ross has missed an argument
&gt; that disqualifies Oxford as a candidate.

&gt; From the Oxfordian point of view--I don't think Oxford could draft an
&gt; intelligible begging letter for a monopoly on herring. Oxford has to
&gt; be held to the same standard of scruitiny as the other candidates.

&gt; Oxfordians can dip from Ogburn's poisoned well.

&gt; Oxfordianism is just another *ideological system.*

&gt; I think Strats need to come up with a catchy name for Oxford's
&gt; Unspeakable Sin and start doing some PR because naive people will be
&gt; powerfully attracted to 'Oxford's Shakespeare Bible' and the
&gt; Oxfordians are already winning the PR war. If the Strats don't act on
&gt; this NAMBLA will claim the Shakespeare works and then where will
&gt; Westerm culture be?

Could even Elizabeth Weird have actually written this?!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; sense to Oxfords proves it.

&gt; It's about evidence. Oxford has zero, Bacon has huge circumstantial

&gt; Oxford was out killing peasants for sport, Shakespeare was holding

Here's the question again for E. Weir. Because she says that there
was a single writer of the poems and plays who passed under the name
of &quot;Shakespeare,&quot; then who was the &quot;player Shakespeare,&quot; certainly
it couldn't be Bacon. How can that be explained?

Here's the question entirely from a couple of days ago, and Elizabeth
might have an answer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bacon is allowed, that's the Gumbonian way, the name of &quot;Shakespeare&quot;
&gt; on a title page, as we've seen, is a very thin way to determine
&gt; Elizabethan authorship. Elizabeth Weir will agree with this, the name
&gt; was a cover for those who wished to be unknown. Weir wants Bacon to
&gt; have it all, however, which is a serious error, and greedy, but for a
&gt; moment we'll pretend that whenever we see the name of &quot;Shakespeare&quot;,
&gt; it's Bacon in the closet.

&gt; Here's a serious question. Was Bacon also the actor noted in the cast
&gt; of Jonson's &quot;Sejanus&quot; and &quot;Everyman in his Humour&quot;? And was he the
&gt; principal actor in the &quot;Works,&quot; for he's first on the list of players?
&gt; Or is there any evidence that Bacon was an actor at all?

&gt; And yet I don't think that Bacon is of much interest to Weir. He's a
&gt; skulled Stratfordian, maggoty-pated, as the phrase goes, and wants
&gt; Oxford out of the question, therefore all that nasty language.
&gt; However, if the question posed can be answered even by Weir, who
&gt; doesn't give a damn about Bacon after all, it would be interesting to
&gt; know that answer. Was Bacon really an actor in those two plays by
&gt; Jonson? Gumbonians wonder.

Please tell me how I can *leave* things that will

you feels the need to call me illiterate. Where can I leave
my writings? Where do you leave yours, Elizabeth.
Susanna and Judith must not have left them in
the right place.

The fact that we have anything of these girls
gives them a status above the others of her time.
Do we have thousands of other signatures
of Stratford people, or, as I suspect, is
Susanna among the very few of her peers
with extant handwriting?

In the space below, please show the
people of 2403 that you are literate.
This will be the only artifact they can
use to judge you.

So every time you call them illiterate,
you shoot another hole in your credibility.
She really brings out the skinhead in you.

Elizabeth Weird has apparently hallucinated that your essay on the
Strachey delivers the fatal blow to &quot;Stratfordianism&quot; and leaves Bacon
as the only viable authorship candidate. The basis for for such a
delusion is of course unclear to those who are not privy to Elizabeth's
hallucinations, but I reproduce below a few of her more amusing
proclamations on the subject:

&quot;Kathman has produced the sine qua non for the Oxfordians and they
cannot meet it. Oxfordians cannot place Oxford at the Virginia
Company when Bacon's friend Governor Sir Thomas Gates returns with
the 30-page Strachey report on the mass loss of life at Jamestown.
Bacon was certainly not going to hand the Strachey letter over to
the Catholic Derby to 'finish the First Folio' or whatever lunatic
nonsense the Oxfordians have come up to explain the postmortem plays.

Kathman has incontrovertibly falsified the Oxfordian case by proving
that the Strachey letter is indispensible to The Tempest and
therefore the First Folio and authorship.

Falsification is the only secure proof [Bacon, then Popper without
credit to Bacon].

Kathman leaves the polymath genius Sir Francis Bacon back at the
Virginia Company with the Strachey letter in his hand but a round
of the usual Strat cursing and name-calling should take care of
the problem.&quot;

&quot;Kathman wrote a fine paper dismissing any possibility that
Oxford might have had access to the Strachey letter but made a
fool of himself in the second half of the paper inventing ways
that Shakespeare woulda coulda had access to the Strachey letter
himself. Kathman has Richard Field carrying it down to Stratford
because he might have thought Shakespeare would likely have wanted
to see it.&quot;

&quot;I think you're right although in the case of the Digges family
Kathman thinks he's come up with a connection.

I doubt the Digges family, which was an old established family in
Kent, would have socialized with the Shakespeares, let alone
referred to the actor or even the playwright--as 'our.' Strats
cannot afford to know about the iron protocol of rank in
Tudor-Stuart England.

That doesn't stop Kathman from positing that 'Sir Dudley Digges
most likely carried the Strachey letter down to Stratford so
Shakespeare could see it.' I'm laughing hysterically.

I won't go into the Digges-Bacon connections here because
'connections,' despite what Kathman believes, don't prove authorship.

I will say that the Digges-Bacon connection spans three generations,
is documented and beats Kathman's.

In terms of evidence, the Strachey letter went to Bacon's London
office where Bacon and five *Protestant* earls on the Virginia Company
directorship had no choice but to supress the Strachey letter because
its descriptions of the horrors at Jamestown would bring the company
down.

Bacon's direct connection with the Strachey letter is still not
sufficient evidence to prove authorship. &lt;---&lt; please note that,
Kathman.

There is no doubt that Bacon read the Strachey letter since he was
on the directorship that voted to suppress it.

Bacon's authorship can only be proved by showing that neither
Shakespeare nor Oxford could have read it.

Oxford was dead and Sir Dudley Digges did not carry it down to
Stratford because the letter was suppressed. It's [sic] contents
were so explosive that I doubt that the seventy Council members
were allowed to see it. It's not coincidental that the head
directorship was composed of five Anglican Puritan anti-Spain
earls plus Bacon and his close friend Sir Henry Montagu. The only
thing that stood between the British claim to North America
and Spanish encroachment was the Virginia Colony.

I doubt they showed it to that idiot James I who was already
thinking of giving it away in a Spanish Marriage.

The fact that only Bacon could have seen it makes Bacon Shakespeare
because it is possible to prove something by excluding all other
possibilities.&quot;

&quot;There's evidence and then there's deductive conclusions and
Kathman, failing to close the deal on the Strachey letter, has
ended the Burgher's claim to authorship in any event.

Oxford's deceased but the Renaissance genius Sir Francis Bacon is
back at the London office of the Virginia Company advising Pembroke,
Montgomery and Southampton, his cousin Salisbury and friends Sussex
and Northampton to supress the politically deadly Strachey letter
[we can know this from Bacon's job description--councillor--in the
Second Charter].
[...]
There's no hard evidence positive or negative to be had in the
Burgher's claim. There are however, conclusive logical deductions
supported by incontrovertible evidence in Kathman's paper 'Dating
the Temest' that prove that the Strachey letter is vital to
Shakespeare authorship.

Alas, Kathman fails to deliver the Strachey letter to the Burgher.&quot;

See what hilarious lunacy you're missing by not reading Elizabeth
Weird's posts?

&gt;&gt; What's this debate I'm supposedly dodging? I generally
&gt;&gt; don't read Elizabeth Weird's posts, so I only see what
&gt;&gt; she writes when it's quoted by others, as it is here.

&gt;&gt; Dave Kathman
&gt;&gt; d ... @ix.netcom.com

&gt; Elizabeth Weird has apparently hallucinated that your essay on the
&gt;Strachey delivers the fatal blow to &quot;Stratfordianism&quot; and leaves Bacon
&gt;as the only viable authorship candidate. The basis for for such a
&gt;delusion is of course unclear to those who are not privy to Elizabeth's
&gt;hallucinations, but I reproduce below a few of her more amusing
&gt;proclamations on the subject:

"/>

Oh, yeah; I do vaguely remember reading most of these ramblings
at some point, but they were barely coherent enough to respond to,
let alone spend a lot of time rebutting.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;Kathman has produced the sine qua non for the Oxfordians and they
&gt; cannot meet it. Oxfordians cannot place Oxford at the Virginia
&gt; Company when Bacon's friend Governor Sir Thomas Gates returns with
&gt; the 30-page Strachey report on the mass loss of life at Jamestown.
&gt; Bacon was certainly not going to hand the Strachey letter over to
&gt; the Catholic Derby to 'finish the First Folio' or whatever lunatic
&gt; nonsense the Oxfordians have come up to explain the postmortem plays.

&gt; Kathman has incontrovertibly falsified the Oxfordian case by proving
&gt; that the Strachey letter is indispensible to The Tempest and
&gt; therefore the First Folio and authorship.

&gt; Falsification is the only secure proof [Bacon, then Popper without
&gt; credit to Bacon].

&gt; Kathman leaves the polymath genius Sir Francis Bacon back at the
&gt; Virginia Company with the Strachey letter in his hand but a round
&gt; of the usual Strat cursing and name-calling should take care of
&gt; the problem.&quot;

"/>

What evidence do you have that Bacon ever had &quot;the Strachey
letter in his hand&quot;? The mere fact that he was one of the
several hundred backers of the Virginia Company? I honestly
don't know if he had any more involvement than that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;Kathman wrote a fine paper dismissing any possibility that
&gt; Oxford might have had access to the Strachey letter but made a
&gt; fool of himself in the second half of the paper inventing ways
&gt; that Shakespeare woulda coulda had access to the Strachey letter
&gt; himself. Kathman has Richard Field carrying it down to Stratford
&gt; because he might have thought Shakespeare would likely have wanted
&gt; to see it.&quot;

"/>

Uh, no. As I believe someone else has pointed out, nowhere
in my paper do I mention Richard Field. You must have been
thinking of Sir Dudley Digges.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&quot;I think you're right although in the case of the Digges family
&gt; Kathman thinks he's come up with a connection.

&gt; I doubt the Digges family, which was an old established family in
&gt; Kent, would have socialized with the Shakespeares, let alone
&gt; referred to the actor or even the playwright--as 'our.' Strats
&gt; cannot afford to know about the iron protocol of rank in
&gt; Tudor-Stuart England.

"/>

But the Digges family did socialize with the Shakespeares --
Anne Digges, the mother of Leonard Digges and Sir Dudley Digges,
was married to Thomas Russell, one of Shakespeare's close friends
and the overseer of his will. Anne Digges and Thomas Russell
lived a couple of miles from Stratford. The one surviving letter
by Leonard Digges, written in the 1630s, gossips about &quot;the mad
relations of Stratford&quot; and talks about Thomas Combe, to whom
Shakespeare left a sword in his will. I mention some of this
in the Tempest essay and the rest of it in the &quot;Shakespeare's
Stratford Friends&quot; essay.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That doesn't stop Kathman from positing that 'Sir Dudley Digges
&gt; most likely carried the Strachey letter down to Stratford so
&gt; Shakespeare could see it.' I'm laughing hysterically.

"/>

I hope the doctors will increase your medication to get
that under control.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I won't go into the Digges-Bacon connections here because
&gt; 'connections,' despite what Kathman believes, don't prove authorship.

&gt; I will say that the Digges-Bacon connection spans three generations,
&gt; is documented and beats Kathman's.

"/>

It beats being the stepson of one of Shakespeare's best friends?
OK. Whatever you say.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In terms of evidence, the Strachey letter went to Bacon's London
&gt; office where Bacon and five *Protestant* earls on the Virginia Company
&gt; directorship had no choice but to supress the Strachey letter because
&gt; its descriptions of the horrors at Jamestown would bring the company
&gt; down.

"/>

And how do you know that anybody &quot;suppressed&quot; the Strachey letter?
Those voices again?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bacon's direct connection with the Strachey letter is still not
&gt; sufficient evidence to prove authorship. &lt;---&lt; please note that,
&gt; Kathman.

&gt; There is no doubt that Bacon read the Strachey letter since he was
&gt; on the directorship that voted to suppress it.

"/>

When do you hallucinate this &quot;vote&quot; took place?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bacon's authorship can only be proved by showing that neither
&gt; Shakespeare nor Oxford could have read it.

&gt; Oxford was dead and Sir Dudley Digges did not carry it down to
&gt; Stratford because the letter was suppressed. It's [sic] contents
&gt; were so explosive that I doubt that the seventy Council members
&gt; were allowed to see it.

"/>

Ah, seventy! A nice exact number, so she must know what
she's talking about, even though she pulled that number
out of her ass.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's not coincidental that the head
&gt; directorship was composed of five Anglican Puritan anti-Spain
&gt; earls plus Bacon and his close friend Sir Henry Montagu. The only
&gt; thing that stood between the British claim to North America
&gt; and Spanish encroachment was the Virginia Colony.

"/>

I almost hesitate to ask, but is there actual evidence for
this &quot;head directorship&quot;, or are you just making stuff up
again?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I doubt they showed it to that idiot James I who was already
&gt; thinking of giving it away in a Spanish Marriage.

&gt; The fact that only Bacon could have seen it makes Bacon Shakespeare
&gt; because it is possible to prove something by excluding all other
&gt; possibilities.&quot;

&gt;&quot;There's evidence and then there's deductive conclusions and
&gt; Kathman, failing to close the deal on the Strachey letter, has
&gt; ended the Burgher's claim to authorship in any event.

&gt; Oxford's deceased but the Renaissance genius Sir Francis Bacon is
&gt; back at the London office of the Virginia Company advising Pembroke,
&gt; Montgomery and Southampton, his cousin Salisbury and friends Sussex
&gt; and Northampton to supress the politically deadly Strachey letter
&gt; [we can know this from Bacon's job description--councillor--in the
&gt; Second Charter].
&gt; [...]
&gt; There's no hard evidence positive or negative to be had in the
&gt; Burgher's claim. There are however, conclusive logical deductions
&gt; supported by incontrovertible evidence in Kathman's paper 'Dating
&gt; the Temest' that prove that the Strachey letter is vital to
&gt; Shakespeare authorship.

&gt; Alas, Kathman fails to deliver the Strachey letter to the Burgher.&quot;

&gt;See what hilarious lunacy you're missing by not reading Elizabeth
&gt;Weird's posts?

&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Weird has apparently hallucinated that your essay on the
&gt;&gt;Strachey delivers the fatal blow to &quot;Stratfordianism&quot; and leaves Bacon
&gt;&gt;as the only viable authorship candidate. The basis for for such a
&gt;&gt;delusion is of course unclear to those who are not privy to Elizabeth's
&gt;&gt;hallucinations, but I reproduce below a few of her more amusing
&gt;&gt;proclamations on the subject:
&gt; Oh, yeah; I do vaguely remember reading most of these ramblings
&gt; at some point, but they were barely coherent enough to respond to,
&gt; let alone spend a lot of time rebutting.

You're right, of course. However, incoherence is Elizabeth's saving
grace: someone who doesn't know what she's talking about is prudent not
to express herself too clearly. When Elizabeth does spell out clearly
(for her) what she means, the results are invariably hilariously funny.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&quot;Kathman has produced the sine qua non for the Oxfordians and they
&gt;&gt; cannot meet it. Oxfordians cannot place Oxford at the Virginia
&gt;&gt; Company when Bacon's friend Governor Sir Thomas Gates returns with
&gt;&gt; the 30-page Strachey report on the mass loss of life at Jamestown.
&gt;&gt; Bacon was certainly not going to hand the Strachey letter over to
&gt;&gt; the Catholic Derby to 'finish the First Folio' or whatever lunatic
&gt;&gt; nonsense the Oxfordians have come up to explain the postmortem plays.

&gt;&gt; Kathman has incontrovertibly falsified the Oxfordian case by proving
&gt;&gt; that the Strachey letter is indispensible to The Tempest and
&gt;&gt; therefore the First Folio and authorship.

&gt;&gt; Falsification is the only secure proof [Bacon, then Popper without
&gt;&gt; credit to Bacon].

&gt;&gt; Kathman leaves the polymath genius Sir Francis Bacon back at the
&gt;&gt; Virginia Company with the Strachey letter in his hand but a round
&gt;&gt; of the usual Strat cursing and name-calling should take care of
&gt;&gt; the problem.&quot;
&gt; What evidence do you have that Bacon ever had &quot;the Strachey
&gt; letter in his hand&quot;? The mere fact that he was one of the
&gt; several hundred backers of the Virginia Company?

&gt;&gt; referred to the actor or even the playwright--as 'our.' Strats
&gt;&gt; cannot afford to know about the iron protocol of rank in
&gt;&gt; Tudor-Stuart England.
&gt; But the Digges family did socialize with the Shakespeares --
&gt; Anne Digges, the mother of Leonard Digges and Sir Dudley Digges,
&gt; was married to Thomas Russell, one of Shakespeare's close friends
&gt; and the overseer of his will. Anne Digges and Thomas Russell
&gt; lived a couple of miles from Stratford. The one surviving letter
&gt; by Leonard Digges, written in the 1630s, gossips about &quot;the mad
&gt; relations of Stratford&quot; and talks about Thomas Combe, to whom
&gt; Shakespeare left a sword in his will. I mention some of this
&gt; in the Tempest essay and the rest of it in the &quot;Shakespeare's
&gt; Stratford Friends&quot; essay.

&gt;&gt; I will say that the Digges-Bacon connection spans three generations,

&gt;&gt; In terms of evidence, the Strachey letter went to Bacon's London

&gt;&gt; its descriptions of the horrors at Jamestown would bring the company

Perhaps visual as well as auditory hallucinations are involved.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Bacon's direct connection with the Strachey letter is still not

&gt;&gt; There is no doubt that Bacon read the Strachey letter since he was
&gt;&gt; on the directorship that voted to suppress it.
&gt; When do you hallucinate this &quot;vote&quot; took place?

When you're just making up things as you go along, details like that
don't matter; Elizabeth can easily invent a date consistent with the
rest of her invention.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Bacon's authorship can only be proved by showing that neither
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare nor Oxford could have read it.

&gt;&gt; Oxford was dead and Sir Dudley Digges did not carry it down to
&gt;&gt; Stratford because the letter was suppressed. It's [sic] contents
&gt;&gt; were so explosive that I doubt that the seventy Council members
&gt;&gt; were allowed to see it.

&gt;&gt; It's not coincidental that the head

&gt;&gt; thing that stood between the British claim to North America
&gt;&gt; and Spanish encroachment was the Virginia Colony.
&gt; I almost hesitate to ask, but is there actual evidence for

I trust that the question is purely rhetorical.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; I doubt they showed it to that idiot James I who was already

&gt;&gt; The fact that only Bacon could have seen it makes Bacon Shakespeare

&gt;&gt; possibilities.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&quot;There's evidence and then there's deductive conclusions and
&gt;&gt; Kathman, failing to close the deal on the Strachey letter, has
&gt;&gt; ended the Burgher's claim to authorship in any event.

&gt;&gt; Oxford's deceased but the Renaissance genius Sir Francis Bacon is
&gt;&gt; back at the London office of the Virginia Company advising Pembroke,
&gt;&gt; Montgomery and Southampton, his cousin Salisbury and friends Sussex
&gt;&gt; and Northampton to supress the politically deadly Strachey letter
&gt;&gt; [we can know this from Bacon's job description--councillor--in the
&gt;&gt; Second Charter].
&gt;&gt; [...]
&gt;&gt; There's no hard evidence positive or negative to be had in the
&gt;&gt; Burgher's claim. There are however, conclusive logical deductions
&gt;&gt; supported by incontrovertible evidence in Kathman's paper 'Dating
&gt;&gt; the Temest' that prove that the Strachey letter is vital to
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare authorship.

&gt;&gt; Alas, Kathman fails to deliver the Strachey letter to the Burgher.&quot;

&gt;&gt;See what hilarious lunacy you're missing by not reading Elizabeth

"/>

Well, at least you're no longer calling him a plagerist [sic], but
that's scant progress. Your belief that Einstein committed plagiarism
is utterly unfounded -- Einstein actually *explained*, from two simple,
fundamental physical principles, the Lorentz transformations arrived at
but incorrectly interpreted by Lorentz, Poincaré, and others. Both your
profound ignorance of the underlying mathematics and physics and your
equally breath-taking ignorance of history have been demonstrated
conclusively, and at great length. Thus your failure to retract an
untenable accusation -- for which you never even attempted to adduce
evidence in any case -- makes your position nearly as comtemptible as
that of the few pathetic Aryan supremacists whose relativity denial is
prompted by purely nonscientific considerations.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; We don't credit Poincare because humans like to clot together
&gt; around symbolic figures and Einstein looked like a young genius
&gt; with his lovely melting eyes and tangled ringlets.

"/>

Physicists DO credit Poincaré for the striking insights in his paper;
indeed, that is why a certain group of symmetries of an indefinite,
nondegenerate quadratic form of signature one on a 4-dimensional vector
space is often called the Poincaré group. Similarly, physicists DO
honor Lorentz for his insight by calling the coordinate transformations
relating two inertial frames Lorentz transformations. Physicists do NOT
credit Poincaré and Lorentz with the creation of special relativity
because, important though their contributions were, neither Poincaré nor
Lorentz understood the vital point that a complete overhaul of Galilean
kinematics was required -- indeed, Lorentz believed that the &quot;local
time&quot; arising in the Lorentz transformations was a purely mathematical
construct with no real physical significance, and he explicitly
acknowledged the superiority of Einstein's brilliantly simple insight.
Einstein did grasp this point, then DERIVED the Lorentz transformations
from fundamental principles rather than as the _ad hoc_ contrivance of
Lorentz, Fitzgerald, and others. Einstein further derived some stunning
consequences, including the mass-energy equivalence, not envisioned by
either Lorentz of Poincaré.

Elizabeth Weir: I don't wish to be brutal about it, but what evidence
is there that Bacon was an actor? -- for if Bacon was &quot;Shakespeare&quot; he
is noted to be a player both in a couple of Jonson's plays, and he
also tops the list of players in the first folio.

If Elizabeth can't place Bacon as a actor, the Gumbonians understand,
and Bacon is entitled yet to be one of the writers who entered the
Gumbo under the name of&quot;Shakespeare&quot;. Therefore, Elizabeth, don't be
discouraged with your choice, Bacon need not have been an actor to
have played his Gumbonian part as the great poet.
