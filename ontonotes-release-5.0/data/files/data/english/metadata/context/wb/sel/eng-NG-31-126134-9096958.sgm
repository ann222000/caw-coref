I just read that he was arrested for drug possession somewhere in the
midwest and that it's possible that he can't get bail until Tuesday
when the courts open back up and bail can be set.

Sucks to be arrested over the weekend, eh?

Oh, he's very lucky.  Another article says that he's been released on
$20,000 bail today.  He's lucky that it was in Idaho where they
apparantly don't close govt offices for Columbus Day.  If he'd been
here in NY, he'd still be in jail.

Interesting article.  I  picked it up at a rest stop in CT on the way
home from the illadelph on sunday and read the whole thing in the
car.  Shoulda been a lot longer.  Some interesting stories on his
childhood that AFAIK had not surfaced until now.  Its hilarious when
he talks about his step dad and tries using a landscaping metaphor to
imply dude wasn't a drugdealer and then lets it slip hes talking about
coke and not flowers lol.  Anywho, I feel like I got fucked with no
vaseline (no homo, no ice cube) paying 5 bucks for that joint.  There
was like 2 other worthwhile articles in the whole rag IMO.  I shoulda
copped the source or xxl instead, but I'm a mark for weezy...

XXL had him n birdman on the cover, and I had to buy just for the
ridiculous picture where they show off their tattoos and jewelry. I'm
sure you got it, tho'. Weezys quoted along the lines &quot;all I do is do
drugs and make music&quot;. And of course they both have each other's faces
inked on their bodies.

man i copped both the source and XXL the other week for the bus from
san diego
to LA and my seat was bust and there was no light. finally got to read
them on the plane
back to london and there's not much too them, copped vapours for free
which was pretty good
but it was a special on sneaker freakers and all the shops, and XLR8R
which had a special on
france which was pretty cool...

Yep, one time I got arrested on a Thursday night  in Oakland resulting
in not getting processed until early Friday.  NOT GOOD.  I give the
accomodations negative two stars.

AND, I didn't do nuthin'! (really)

but as far as dude goes, He's a serious facelift havin' metrosexual
which is never a good look in urban jails!
