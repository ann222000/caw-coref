" . . . Bangkok Business . . . "  - - Chapter Four  - "Praha One"

After a restless night with little sleep, Paul awoke early, showered,
shaved, and went down to breakfast.  The Mercure was barely three
star, and breakfast was sort of buffet-Spartan.   There were only a
few other guests awake this early.  Paul couldn't help but notice a
small, long-faced young man of mixed Asian ancestry sitting alone
sipping hot tea.  Paul had this nagging feeling that he had seen the
man before, but he just couldn't place him.  Maybe it was just that
the man was Asian, and therefore a familiar face in Amsterdam's too-
European crowd.

Paul called and met Gunter and they made an agreement and worked out
the arrangements.  Paul received a slip of paper from Gunter that
contained a cryptic list of names, telephones and brief instructions.
Gunter told Paul that the "item" would be ready in exactly 24 hours.

Paul relaxed and spent the rest of the day seeing the sights, the
canals, and so forth.  There was a rental car kiosk near the hotel,
and he arranged for a full size Volvo with a roomy trunk.

Evening approached, and Paul went out and worked his way through the
crowd of pedestrians, dodging streetcars and bicycles and admiring
blonde Aryan women as tall as he or taller.  It had temporarily
stopped snowing, and Amsterdam was cold but beautiful.  Every breath
of the cold air invigorated Paul and made him feel young and alive as
never before.  Finally, he made it down to the Red Light district,
looked at the window girls, and decided to take in one of the sex
shows.  The Moulin Rouge was an odd place, with a bar on one side of a
raised stage and booths and tables on the other side.  The crowd was
an eclectic mix of old hippies and young backpackers.  They all seemed
the same to Paul.  The sex show was boring compared to even the
mildest shows along Walking Street in Pattaya or in the Patpong
District in Bangkok.  Later, more out of boredom than lust, he
selected a very dark Nigerian window girl.  "Dark Meat", Paul thought
to himself, recalling how he used to pick up the black streetwalkers
along Morehead Avenue in Atlanta, Georgia.  For fifty Euros, he got a
lacklustre covered blowjob.  A "CBJ", he thought to himself, now that
is a first.  The Amsterdam girls had a reputation for being too
expensive and overly safety conscious.  Another stereotype just moved
from the "myth" to "fact" column as far as Paul was concerned.

Back at the Mercure, it was another restless night for Paul.  He awoke
early, and called Gunter.   After receiving more detailed
instructions, he checked out, picked up the rental Volvo and drove
across town to the other side of Amsterdam.

After some delays, he picked up Gunter in front of Deutsche Bank on
Herengracht.  Gunter directed Paul to drive around to a nearby parking
garage where they parked and were soon met by a clearly marked "Group
4 Securicor" van.   This was certainly unexpected.  Men who appeared
to be regular uniformed cash courier guards, complete with sidearms,
stepped out of the van.  One motioned briskly and authoritatively for
Paul and Gunter to step out of the car.  Never disobey an armed guard,
Paul thought to himself.  Paul and Gunter moved towards one guard,
while the other guard moved to the Volvo to inspect it and open the
trunk.  Then, both guards picked up a large and obviously heavy
cardboard box, and placed it in the trunk.  The guards spoke a few
words to Gunter in what sounded like Dutch, and that was that, the
guards saddled up and drove off.  Gunter walked to the trunk, produced
a small pocketknife, and sliced away the cardboard, leaving a very
large and new looking Samsonite hardshell wardrobe suitcase lying in
the trunk.  After disposing of the cardboard in a nearby trash bin,
Gunter offered a hand- drawn map to Paul, and simply smiled and said,
"Go".

Driving away, Paul realized that he still had in his pocket the
envelope containing the $5,000-USD, Gunter hadn't asked for it back,
and Paul had momentarily forgotten about it.  Oh well, just pocket
change to these guys, I am sure.

Paul slowly worked his way across unfamiliar territory, taking the
A12, E35, A3, and B43 routes to Frankfurt.  Crossing the border into
Germany was uneventful.   He made a quick stop in Frankfurt for fuel
and food and then got back on the road.   Next, Paul took the E50 and
E48 routes out of Germany and into the Czech Republic.  Crossing over
into the Czech Republic was a little scary.   There were two border
guards with sub-machine guns and a large German Shepard that was
undoubtedly trained to sniff for drugs ("...and perhaps sniff for
money..."), registered only as an afterthought, as he passed through the
check point.

He made just one stop between the border and Prague, to relive himself
at a rest area.  There he happened upon two teenage girls who were
clearly begging and perhaps offering themselves to men for money.  The
rest stop was nearly deserted, and Paul was sorely tempted.  The older
of the two was barely budding.   She was at the "certain" age where
teenage girls could be most delectable.  Forbidden fruit beginning to
ripen.  The girls looked pale and chilled and cold.  They were both
wearing thin little dresses under their winter coats; they twirled
like little ballerinas, and seductively flashed their coats open as
they flirted with him.  He thought better of it, but feeling
charitable, he gave each of the little blonde Lolitas a 50 Czech
Koruna note, probably more than they would have made if they had sold
themselves to a stranger for a quick blowjob in the toilet.  What a
screwed up world, Paul thought as he shook his head silently to
himself.

Including stops for fuel and food, Paul made the trip in 11 hours, and
arrived in Prague at approximately 10:00pm.  Gunter's map was perfect,
and must have been drawn by someone that knew every road, exit, and
connector.   Following the written instructions, Paul opened his cell
phone and installed the Voda Fone SIM card that Gunter gave him.  He
called the number written on the slip of paper, and a voice answered
with a crisp "You are Gunter's man, this is you, ya?"   Paul simply
answered Yes, and listened to the instructions.  He was going to have
to find 17 Treyziste, in Praha 1, the city centre, and be there before
midnight.  That was fine with Paul, he was anxious to loose the burden
he was carrying in the back of the Volvo.  Just judging by the way
that the Volvo sank down when the suitcase was loaded, Paul estimated
that the suitcase weighed at least 100 pounds.  Doing the mental
calculations, and using the old estimate that a single U.S. 100-dollar
bill weighs one gram, he guessed that he was carrying around 4 or 5
Million U.S. Dollars.

With the rental car agency's map of Prague as his only guide, Paul
found the central business district that was simply "District One", or
Praha 1.    There were very few street signs and everything was
difficult to figure out at night.  He finally stopped and found a
night watchman on duty in front of a warehouse,  Paul showed the
address to the man, and gave him the universal "shrugged shoulders"
body language as if to ask a question.   The man smiled and pointed
across the street to an impressive looking older building next to a
construction site.   Paul immediately noticed that parked in the
construction site was a long black limousine with only its parking
lights visible in the cold damp gloom.  Paul nodded thanks, and drove
cautiously into the lot, just guessing that the big black limo was the
"big black car" that the mystery Czech voice on the phone had
instructed him to find.

Paul edged slowly into the lot, lights dimmed, and with his eyes
constantly moving, trying to probe every shadow for unforeseen
dangers.  He did not like doing anything this spooky in the dark on
somebody else's turf.  His sixth sense may not have been as keenly
developed as that of some career criminals, but he knew that this just
did not seem right.  He was perhaps 50 yards into the lot now, and
perhaps within 20 yards of the limo that was parked almost exactly in
the middle of the large construction site.

Suddenly, both front doors of the limo burst open, and at the same
time, Paul sensed that there was a flash of light behind him.
Glancing into his rear view mirror, and then turning around
completely, Paul could clearly see the silhouette of an old deuce and
a quarter army truck behind him, about half way to the main road
entrance from which he had just came.  Just then, he saw what were
apparently two soldiers carrying rifles jump out of the back of the
truck and take positions on either side of the vehicle.

Paul hesitated for a moment, and then panicking, he threw the Volvo
into reverse, floored it, spun a one-eighty, and shot forward, passing
the old truck.  He was almost oblivious to the shouts and gunfire, but
he somehow sensed the dull thud and plinking noises as small arms fire
riddled the engine and the front tires of the Volvo.  He made it
almost back to the main road before the "Safest Car on Earth" ground
to an ignominious halt.

Paul instinctively clasped his hands over his head and sat still
responding to the shouts of the armed men.
