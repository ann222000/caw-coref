Dear all Vaishnavas,

Please accept my fallen obeisances. All glories to our Srila Prabhupada and
Gurudev.

For so many days now, most of the Europe continent is facing the most
horrible heat cyclone ever remembered in our recent history, actually in my
36 years I have never experienced such heat, we are talking about 40-50C.
Most of the countries have declared state of emergency, people are told not
to go to work, avoid walking in street etc. What is the worst in every
country the forests are on fire and nobody with all the sophisticated air
jet-fire extinguishers and military power has been able to control the fire
and what to speak of heat. My town has only 5 months of water reserve left
for half of million populations. Nobody has any plan or remedy for all these
and frankly speaking in reality there is nil plans for such problems. I know
some of you are experienced with heat and water problems in India and UAE
but so far we in Europe have never experienced such kind of heat, for sure
the climate is drastically changing as scientist are saying but none of them
know the real reason behind all this, and that is *Godlessness and the way
out is simply the opposite.*

Many times we think that Lord Indra is in charge of rain and Lord Krsna has
nothing to do with this small management issue but on the contrary Lord
Krsna in this verse confirms that He is the one behind the rain and heat.
And Lord Krsna says to Arjuna that this is the most confidential knowledge.

*BG 9.19*
*tapaamy aham aham varsham / nigrhnaamy utsrjaami ca
amrtam caiva mrtyush ca / sad asac caaham arjuna
*
&quot;*O Arjuna, I give heat (tapami), and I withhold and send forth the rain
(varsham). I am immortality, and I am also death personified. Both spirit
and matter are in Me.*&quot;

Krsna, by His different energies, diffuses heat and light through the agency
of electricity and the sun. During summer season it is Krsna who checks rain
from falling from the sky, and then during the rainy season He gives
unceasing torrents of rain. The energy which sustains us by prolonging the
duration of our life is Krsna, and Krsna meets us at the end as death. By
analyzing all these different energies of Krsna, one can ascertain that for
Krsna there is no distinction between matter and spirit, or, in other words,
He is both matter and spirit. *In the advanced stage of Krsna consciousness,
one therefore makes no such distinctions. He sees only Krsna in everything.*

Since Krsna is both matter and spirit, the gigantic universal form
comprising all material manifestations is also Krsna, and His pastimes in
Vrndavan as two-handed Syamasundara, playing on a flute, are those of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead.

I think that purport is very clear but what I still cannot understand why we
are so fools??

There is horrible heat coming which nobody can stop, there are no rains,
fire is burning everything and again we don't go to the ONLY solution for
all the problems and beg for His mercy.

I beg for the mercy of all sincere Vaishnavas that I will be able to
real-ize this eternal truth that Krsna is all in all, satyam param dhimahi.

Your fallen and boiled servant,
Murlidhara Krsna das, Yugoslavia
