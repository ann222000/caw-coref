I built one of these for a unstable weak connection a couple miles away.

I improved the connection, but it is still not stable; transmission
appears to be better than reception using a orinoco pcmcia card (one of
the best tested for receive sensitivity; power 200mw). Interestingly the
software reports a fair 33% - 40% signal strength and link quality,
which is as high as I got when I was alot closer with a good stable
connection, but NOW that I am much farther away the connection is made
to a web page but the data transfer stalls and I get nothing. It is
related to signal strength cuz when I am close to some other access
point, everything works fine.

Here is the template I used, but I doubled the size, EXCEPT I made the
heighth about 1/2 the width (curve of parabola remains the same) The
template from http://www.freeantennas.com/projects/template/ calls for
height and width to be the same-a square.

Since my math only goes through Trig, how critical is the height/width
ratio and does it have to be a square to be maximally effective. I am
just on the borderline now of getting a stable signal. What can I do to
increase the strength, particularily the receive end? Can someone take a
look at the template at the url above and tell me where I am going wrong
or what I can do to improve the antenna?

Assuming vertical polarization, the height has to be at least 1 full
wavelength for a dipole (1/2 wave) feed.  That's 12.5 cm at 2.4GHz.
Larger is better, but less will be a problem.  If the feed is longer
than 1/2 wavelength, the total height should be at least 1/2
wavelength longer than the feed.

The width is a function of the f/D (focal length to diameter) ratio
and the feed illumination angle.  It can vary substantially.  Since
neither of these are particularly easy to determine with a PCMCIA card
feed, the optimum size is currently mostly guesswork.  I can go more
into detail once I determine what you've actually done so far.

Lose the PCMCIA card unless it has an external antenna connector.
Replace with a PCMCIA card that does have an external antenna
connector.  Build or buy a real parabolic dish antenna, yagi, panel,

The gain is not huge but certainly useful.  It's also cheap and easy,

going for the DX record over some unspecified distance.  That's going
to take a more complex system, possibly using commerical antennas.

Guestimate, stable connection at 33-40% was at about 1km, now at about
4km. Line of sight, hahahaha, u jest. Just walked around with the laptop
to see where I could find the strongest signal. Cannot actually see the

Just double the size of the template diagram at the url. Cut thin sheet

mine is twice as wide as high, roughly 12 inches by 6 inches high.

You might as well be speaking Lithuanian to me ;-). Please take a look
at the &quot;parabolic reflector template v.3&quot; at the url above. Double the
size of it, as I enlarged it by a factor of two. Now bend your metal
over foam supports conforming to the template curve and insert a roughly
6 inch rubber ducky into the foam vertical at the focal point of the

half as high as it is wide, yet still covers the complete heighth of the
rubber duckey, whereas there's is a square-as long as it is wide. Does
that explain what I have done any better?

I like the www.Freeantennas.com reflectors.  They are cheap and easy, and

I do wonder what the OP did with the reflector that he made.  It doesn't
fit so well on the Orinoco PCMCIA card that he mentioned, unless there are
some pieces missing that I don't understand.

If you have marginal signal at some location, adding a reflector might be
all you need to do.  Maybe adding one at both ends.  Or, if adding the
reflectors gives you a marginal signal where there was none before, you can
guess at what dB gain you've added over stock, and guess again at how much
gain you might need for a stable connection.

Now you can buy a real antenna, of, say 24dBi gain, knowing that is
10dBi or more higher than the reflector on a stock antenna, and have some
confidence that it will work, since the free reflector already sort of
worked.

Your half-height reflector might not be so good, according to Mike, the
author of the site. &quot;Errors of 1/4&quot; are unacceptable at these frequencies.&quot;
&quot;Parabolic reflectors also loose gain if your finished reflector varies
much from the correct curve.&quot;  I found the curve too hard to maintain, and
I prefer the &quot;Windsurfer&quot; EZ-12 from the same site.  &quot;you will lose roughly
3 dB for each halving of reflector height&quot;  Mike leaves out all the
calculations.  Jeff offered to crunch numbers for you if you measured the
one you built.  Was the image square still square?  I didn't have a problem
with that, but Mike mentions it as a problem area, throwing off the curve.

David Taylor made a free standing antenna using the parabolic template for
his reflector. http://www.nodomainname.co.uk/parabolic/parabolic.htm
He has some other interesting antennas on the site.

I think you're doing just fine if you can get a connection at that
distance, especially without line of sight.  That's much too small an
antenna to do that range reliably.  It's just too far.  The small
dishes are good for perhaps 300-500 meters maximum.  Any further
improvements will need to be in either the size of the antenna, or the
construction (i.e. feed illumination angle).

Well, thats a fair test.  However, you'll probably notice that the
signal goes up and down radically with traffic and position.  That's
because of the Fresnel zone and reflections.
&lt; http://www.terabeam.com/support/calculations/fresnel-zone.php &gt;
At that range, you should have some altitude.  For example, at 4km
(2.5 miles), you should have 9 meters (30ft) of clearance which means
both ends should be at least 9 meters off the ground.

Got it.  12 inches long and 6 inches high.  That give you an aperature
size of about 6&quot;.  Maximum gain for a 0.15 meter (6&quot;) parabola is
about:

Maximum gain for a 0.15meter diameter dish:
gain = 9.87 * Dia^2 / wavelength^2 * (feed efficiency)
gain = 9.87 * 150mm^2 / 125mm^2 * 0.4
gain = 5.7
dBi = 10 log(5.7) = 7.5 dBi gain
This is the best that can be done with such a small dish.  The 40%
efficiency is probably optimistic.  Because your feed method is very
inefficient, it will be much less than 7.5dBi.

That's fairly close to the original.  The problem is that the rubber
ducky feed radiates in all directions.  Only a part of that radiation
hits the reflector and goes in the desired direction.

The 6 inch 5dBi rubber ducky is another problem.  The original 2dBi
version only radiates in the upper half wave (6.25cm) section, so the
vertical height of the reflect can be as short as 12.5cm.  However,
the 5dBi mutation radiates over perhaps 12.5cm in length.  It should
be at least 15.6cm (1/2 wave plus 1/4 wave above the feed tip) wide.
18.8cm would be better if you can extend the reflector another 1/4
wave below the ground end.  Translation:  Make the height somewhat
longer than the feed antenna.

No, but I can guess that you're really asking is does the aspect ratio
have to be 1:1 or does the height have to be the same as the width?
The answer is no.  The height should be 1/4 wavelenth (3.125 cm) above
the tip of the antenna, plus possibly 1/4 wavelength below the base of
the antenna to insure sufficient illumination.  The width will need to
follow a parabolic curve.  If you extend the width of the reflector,
just follow the general pattern for the parabola, or extend it with a
new and larger template.  There is no direct relationship between the
height and the length.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Mine looks similar to this:

If you're getting connections at 4Km with that arrangement, I am
really impressed.  Whatever you're doing is working just fine.

Incidentally, I once built a WX satellite parabolic reflector out of a
long piece of aluminum roofers flashing.  The frequency was about
1.7GHz instead of 2.4GHz.  I used a piece of 4x8ft plywood, jig sawed
into a parabolic shape.  I then stapled the flashing to the parabolic
curved cutout forming a reflector that was about 12&quot; high, but perhaps
12ft long.  Initial measured gain was about 18dBi, which is far less
than the 26dBi I had expected.  It worked amazingly well, but was
mechanically unstable, difficult to aim, and was far too ugly to sell
commercially.  However, it might give you an idea.  Sorry, no photos.

Ok, the measurements are actually 9&quot; by 9&quot; so I guess I do have a square
after all. I'm guessing that just making it bigger with the same curve
might give me the extra oomph I need.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Guestimate, stable connection at 33-40% was at about 1km, now at about
&gt;&gt;4km.

&gt; I think you're doing just fine if you can get a connection at that
&gt; distance, especially without line of sight.  That's much too small an
&gt; antenna to do that range reliably.  It's just too far.  The small
&gt; dishes are good for perhaps 300-500 meters maximum.  Any further
&gt; improvements will need to be in either the size of the antenna, or the
&gt; construction (i.e. feed illumination angle).

yeah, it's just too far.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;Line of sight, hahahaha, u jest. Just walked around with the laptop
&gt;&gt;to see where I could find the strongest signal. Cannot actually see
&gt;&gt;the transmitter, but the signal must be pretty strong, cuz I am
&gt;&gt;marginally connecting now, even at 4km, but it is too iffy.

&gt; Well, thats a fair test.  However, you'll probably notice that the
&gt; signal goes up and down radically with traffic and position.  That's
&gt; because of the Fresnel zone and reflections.
&gt; &lt; http://www.terabeam.com/support/calculations/fresnel-zone.php &gt;
&gt; At that range, you should have some altitude.  For example, at 4km
&gt; (2.5 miles), you should have 9 meters (30ft) of clearance which means
&gt; both ends should be at least 9 meters off the ground.

Yes, ur right, very sensitive to position and angle. Is on an odd
channel for here, 11, so don't have to worry much about interference.
I'm at about 18 feet and can't go any higher cuz it's a crappy apt.

Here's the exact hardware I am using sans antenna:

&gt;&gt;Just double the size of the template diagram at the url. Cut thin
&gt;&gt;sheet metal, fold around foam supports to form the parabola in the
&gt;&gt;template diagram given. Only they are using a square piece of sheet
&gt;&gt;metal and mine is twice as wide as high, roughly 12 inches by 6 inches
&gt;&gt;high. I don't have a ruler handy but the exact dimensions can be
&gt;&gt;gotten off the template diagram at the url. I am not at home, so I
&gt;&gt;don't have a ruler with me here, but the dimensions can be gotten off
&gt;&gt;the template at the url, only I doubled the size and made the height
&gt;&gt;half as high as the width.

&gt; Got it.  12 inches long and 6 inches high.  That give you an aperature
&gt; size of about 6&quot;.  Maximum gain for a 0.15 meter (6&quot;) parabola is
&gt; about:
">

sorry I got it wrong, it's 9 X 9&quot; Will try building it bigger.

One thing I don't get, maybe you can explain. Why is the card software
reporting the same percentage of connection 33-40% as I was getting when
I was 3 times closer and had a stable connection, yet now, no good
connection?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Maximum gain for a 0.15meter diameter dish:
&gt;    gain = 9.87 * Dia^2 / wavelength^2 * (feed efficiency)
&gt;    gain = 9.87 * 150mm^2 / 125mm^2 * 0.4
&gt;    gain = 5.7
&gt;    dBi = 10 log(5.7) = 7.5 dBi gain
&gt; This is the best that can be done with such a small dish.  The 40%
&gt; efficiency is probably optimistic.  Because your feed method is very
&gt; inefficient, it will be much less than 7.5dBi.

&gt;&gt;Using a single rubber duckey 6 inch 5Dbi whip
&gt;&gt;as the focal point foam supported in a half cylinder parabola (similar
&gt;&gt;to 1/2 tin can but shaped more precisely) See approx. dimensions
&gt;&gt;above. Connector between antenna and card is about 6 inches long, so
&gt;&gt;loss minimal there.

&gt; That's fairly close to the original.  The problem is that the rubber
&gt; ducky feed radiates in all directions.  Only a part of that radiation
&gt; hits the reflector and goes in the desired direction.
">

Yeah, don't know how I'd capture the rest of it without getting rid of
the rubber duckey which is what my present and only pigtail connects to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The 6 inch 5dBi rubber ducky is another problem.  The original 2dBi
&gt; version only radiates in the upper half wave (6.25cm) section, so the
&gt; vertical height of the reflect can be as short as 12.5cm.  However,
&gt; the 5dBi mutation radiates over perhaps 12.5cm in length.  It should
&gt; be at least 15.6cm (1/2 wave plus 1/4 wave above the feed tip) wide.
&gt; 18.8cm would be better if you can extend the reflector another 1/4
&gt; wave below the ground end.  Translation:  Make the height somewhat
&gt; longer than the feed antenna.
">

Already is about 1/2 higher on both top and bottom. Guess I have to go
wider.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; The width is a function of the f/D (focal length to diameter) ratio
&gt;&gt;&gt; and the feed illumination angle.  It can vary substantially.  Since
&gt;&gt;&gt; neither of these are particularly easy to determine with a PCMCIA
&gt;&gt;&gt; card feed, the optimum size is currently mostly guesswork.  I can go
&gt;&gt;&gt; more into detail once I determine what you've actually done so far.

&gt;&gt;You might as well be speaking Lithuanian to me ;-).

&gt; Will broken Polish, French, Hebrew, Yiddish, Russian work any better?

&gt; Done.

&gt;&gt;Double the

&gt; Is there some problem with supplying your dimensions?  I can't tell if
&gt; you doubled the width, height, volume, depth, f/D ratio, wire
&gt; thickness or what.

only problem is that I don't have internet at home now, that's all.

&gt;&gt;Now bend your metal
&gt;&gt;over foam supports conforming to the template curve and insert a
&gt;&gt;roughly 6 inch rubber ducky into the foam vertical at the focal point
&gt;&gt;of the parabola. That is what I have, EXCEPT that my metal parabola is
&gt;&gt;one half as high as it is wide, yet still covers the complete heighth
&gt;&gt;of the rubber duckey, whereas there's is a square-as long as it is
&gt;&gt;wide. Does that explain what I have done any better?

&gt; No, but I can guess that you're really asking is does the aspect ratio
&gt; have to be 1:1 or does the height have to be the same as the width?
&gt; The answer is no.  The height should be 1/4 wavelenth (3.125 cm) above
&gt; the tip of the antenna, plus possibly 1/4 wavelength below the base of
&gt; the antenna to insure sufficient illumination.  The width will need to
&gt; follow a parabolic curve.  If you extend the width of the reflector,
&gt; just follow the general pattern for the parabola, or extend it with a
&gt; new and larger template.  There is no direct relationship between the
&gt; height and the length.

&gt;&gt;Mine looks similar to this:
&gt;&gt; http://www.freeantennas.com/projects/template/gallery/Ezreflector.jpg

&gt; If you're getting connections at 4Km with that arrangement, I am
&gt; really impressed.  Whatever you're doing is working just fine.
">

Very unstable, only works maybe 20% of the time. Going to increase the
width of the parabola by point 5 or more. Also were having wet weather
so that's another variable.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Incidentally, I once built a WX satellite parabolic reflector out of a
&gt; long piece of aluminum roofers flashing.  The frequency was about
&gt; 1.7GHz instead of 2.4GHz.  I used a piece of 4x8ft plywood, jig sawed
&gt; into a parabolic shape.  I then stapled the flashing to the parabolic
&gt; curved cutout forming a reflector that was about 12&quot; high, but perhaps
&gt; 12ft long.  Initial measured gain was about 18dBi, which is far less
&gt; than the 26dBi I had expected.  It worked amazingly well, but was
&gt; mechanically unstable, difficult to aim, and was far too ugly to sell
&gt; commercially.  However, it might give you an idea.  Sorry, no photos.

I suppose a dish is out of the question, since I don't know what
obstructions are between me and the transmitter; can't even see the
transmitter which is on a tower about 50 feet up from memory when I was
alot closer.
