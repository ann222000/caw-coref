Actually, there weren't any negative reviews at all.

Saying his outfit reminded someone of Liberace, I'll take it. Elvis was
often compared to (and good friends with) Liberace for his outfits.

In fact, it reminds me more of Elvis:

But that isn't what it's about anyway - reviews are just the icing.

For all VH fans, it's a victory.

The *only* thing that matters is Sammy Hagar is GONE FOR GOOD.

Nothing trumps that, he's on the long lonely road to oblivion and all he can
do now is trash Eddie for publicity.

VH can have bad reviews for the rest of the year and it won't matter - Hagar
is gone for good!

Roth's return &quot;squished&quot; Hagar's career and now Sammy can't even sellout an
800 seater.

Shitty time to be a Hagar fan...

Yeah, Sammy is gone forever and, 'if Gary leaves then Van Halen is
done; I'll score movies or something'.   Sammy was great.  Dave is
great.  Ed is the King.  Why is that so hard for dolts to get?

Well, Geoff Wad, maybe your past posts offer a clue (amazing how
&quot;Rushgedlife&quot; they sound):

&quot;I'd say I'm a faithful husband and a father of 2 great kids.  And getting
on Roth fans' nerves is really just good sport.  I have no problem with
Diamond Dave... I listen to more old VH than Sammy era stuff by far.
ButRoth's fans, like Roth, are fun and easy to mock. They can't post without
insult (much like your post).  Their (your) ignorance gives me bliss.  :-)
It's great fun.  Right Frinky?&quot; - Geoff Wad

&quot;I could give a shit about Roth, but I love getting his moronic clones, like
you, all fired up.   He such a fucking has been and so are his minions of
followers.&quot; - Geoff Wad

&quot;The greatest guitar player on the planet, perhaps ever, hates this stupid
mother fucker and yet can't get away from him because too many balding, over
weight, spandex wearing, dip-shits can't seem to get enough of his bird
screeching, E flat singing, repetitive vocals.  Oh, but 'dude knew how to
party'.  Yeah, so did your wife, but even she quit being a ho' after hookin'
up with your sorry ass.  Now, go out and watch 'little Davey wonder boy,
starring at your local 200 seat club (half filled) and listen to a great VH
'cover band'.  At least Sammy does original shit at his shows... you know,
songs that he's actually written a part from Ed.  You may think they suck,
but they're his... Dave? Roth is a fucking washed up has been, which may be
true for the whole band at this point.&quot; - Geoff Wad

&quot;That's right you little Rothian bitches.... the Great One has returned to
mock your obsequious little minds and give you the what for Sammy's back and
Dave is... well, just a bigger loser than ever.  Was that the Bald Eagle
playing loser poker on Tony's show?  Good Lord you halflings, put a bullet
in the man before he truly disgraces himself. Poor Rich boy Dave.  Everyone
chose up sides and no one picked him.... must suck... sucking.&quot; - Geoff Wad

Ah, those were great times.  Rothians have always been such little cry
babies that could dish out tons of Sammy smack but would assume the
fetal position when the Diamond one was attacked.  It's all good
show.  It's alwasy been about Ed for me. When he's on his game, VH is
simply the best.  Hell, you could sing for them and I would go see Ed
play.  Dave has really responded to the call and no, he's not washed
up, but man I've always hated Rothians.... still do. :-)  So continue
on showing just how fucking petty you all are by 'trying' to convince
us that Sammy was/is horrilble.  Van Halen has always run on the
engine of Edward..... the lead singer debate has been and still is
just really stupid. Then again fighting with Roth fans now just isn't
the same.  Enjoy the concerts; I know I will.
