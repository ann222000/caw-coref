Here's a story about a person who drank tea and lived a long
time and it wasn't Liptons Tea.

Charcoal-Gas Fuel
An Italian by the name of Professor Ferragutti invented
and developed a charcoal-gas driven car in the early 20th
century. This technology was said to have been used
extensively in Italy during the last world w-r because
Italy had no o-l wells.
Ferragutti claimed his fuel was cheaper and safer to use
than gasoline.
Cost for the charcoal-gas fuel at the time was reported
to have been only 5% that of gasoline.

Subject: Re: Charcoal-gas fuel If you can get a hold of
some old &quot;Mother Earth News&quot; magazine from the late 80's
they had several articles including step by step
instructions for converting a car that can run on such gas
or anything that could be burned like wood.  It was
basically an airtight wood stove mounted in the car and
the smoke was filtered and cleaned and then piped into
the carb. - Woody Kurschildgen of Hilden Germany.
The limited information regarding this man would have us
believe he was disproved as totally fraudulent. However,
he made many interesting claims at the time and it might
prove worthwhile to unearth details of the devices he
claimed to have worked, should anyone be able to locate
such information. Prior to the rise of Hitler's regime,
Heinrich Kurschildgen claimed to have discovered a way
to make any inorganic material radioactive by using
mysterious rays. Using this process, he claimed he could
split the atom and use it to produce gold.
Kurshildgen also claimed to have invented; a machine
that would c-re c-ncer a device that would stop any
engine by its rays, a method to purify steel is
reported to have obtained two German patents on his
inventions.
Gas &amp; Wa-er Fuel
In 1974, Portugese chemist John A-drews claimed to
have developed a water to gas additive which would
lower the cost of gasoline to 2 cents per gallon.
The additive was demonstrated to Navy officials who
confirmed that it worked as claimed without reducing
the combustability of the gasoline. The Navy decided to
make a deal for the formula, but on arriving at An-rews
lab, he was missing and the lab had been ransacked.

Heat to Electricity converter
A rooftop device, heated by the sun and using millions
of microcircuits to tap the freed electrons from the
heated molecules, was claimed to operate off the
'fluctuation voltage' derived from the static noise
heard on radios and amplifiers.
Inventor Joseph C. Y-ter claimed in 1975 that such a
device would cost the consumer approximately $-00 and
be up to 90% efficient.
It was demonstrated to the US g-vernment where it was
declared to have 'real potential'. The gov-rnment
promised a full-scale working model to be delivered
within 6 months of the demonstration, yet after the 6
month period, the inventor was notified that the
device was impractical.

Hi Jerry, I've found a little more info on Joseph C.
Ya-er's heat to electricity converter. He appears to
have 4 patents on this technology....
http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/details?patent_number=5623119
http://patent.womplex.ibm.com/details?patent_number=54703955470395
They are listed as &quot;reversible thermoelectric converters&quot;.
His last 3 patents appear to have been co-invented with 2
relatives. The patent lists....Joseph C. Ya-er - Jane A. Yat-r -
Joan E. Yate-
(contact information omitted out of respect for privacy...
Jerry) It looks to be the same guy. Well, that's all for
now. Talk to you later.

High Efficiency reflective paint
N-val Air Systems Command reported in 1981 the development
of a polished film paint which would reflect 98% of energy
directed at it from high energy laser beam weapons, thereby
rendering further Star Wa-s laser efforts useless.
OverUnity claim in patent
A report that patent #3,913,004 by Alexander claims a
discovery which would output 3 watts for every 1 watt input.

Rejuvenation tea
In a book written by French antiquarian Paul Lucas,
'Voyage dans la Turquie' (Paris, 1713), is a report stating
that the favorite wife of the Sultan had fallen seriously ill.
Lucas was summoned to see if he could help the Sultana to
recover.
On entering the Sultan's harem, he noted two beautiful
young girls leaving the room. The eunuch explained these
girls to be 'odalisques', chosen by the Padishah to nurse
the ailing Sultana. Lucas was surprised that such young,
inexperienced girls would be entrusted to care for the
favorite wife.
The eunuch laughed and said, those 'girls' are not as
young as you believe, they are both well over seventy.
Further queries by Lucas found that these 'odalisques'
drank a tea made from a certain herb which kept them young.
This herb was grown only in the garden of the Grand Serail
(in Constantinopol) and kept for the exclusive use of the
harem.

Hindu Rejuvenation

Portugese court historian Lopez de Castanheda, reported
on the life of a Hindu reported to have lived 370 years. At
the time of his death, he had rich black hair and possessed
the full youthful vigor of a young man.
The historian reports the man had been rejuvenated no
less than four times during his life but gives no hint of
the rejuvenation process. Being of Hindu extraction, it is
likely the rejuvenation process came from India.

Vacuum/Hermetically sealed Semiconductors

A couple of years ago, I was told by a friend that a German
research group had discovered a way to amplify electrical
energy extraction from semiconductor circuits enclosed in a
vacuum. The name I was given was Zielinski.
A few months later, I met an Al Zielinski at the 1994
ISNE conference and asked him about this technology. He had
an 'attitude' and refused to discuss it.

In hopes he would mention this in his lecture, I attended.
He never mentioned the fr-e energy device but did claim to be
involved with a s-cretive group in Germany who had achieved
practical le-itation and thrust. He refused to provide any
details on either technology at the lecture.
I bought tickets to his 'workshop' where the claimant
usually is expected to provide some hint of details. The
claim was they had developed a technique which I pinned him
to say involved pulsed high voltage, that would create a
'gravity well' in a preferred area in the vicinity of a mass.
His explanation was you could attach their equipment to a
heavy mass, such as a b-mb with a 100 pound nose-cone. If
the device was attached to the nose-cone, the full weight
of the 100 pound would 'fall' into the artificial gravity
well in the front of the bomb housing. This would cause
it to fall forward or in whichever direction the nose-cone
was pointing, even to 'fall up against gravity.' In the
ensuing years since this conference, I have heard nothing
more about Zielinsky, his mystery group of this technology,
despite claims by him saying they were about to come to
market.

Here is something that a person asked me to pass around to
see if someone can help her.

...................................................................
...................................................................

Hi John,? this is Margaret. I am looking for a place to live...
has to be in the country (preferably not snow country...lol)
so I can have my animals. (I have 3 dogs and 14 cats...all
fixed)? I have very bad credit (lost my mobile home, etc. back
in 2000 due to my son's addictions...long story...makes me sad
and sick to talk about it). Consequently I need to find
something that is owner financed or something that has been
repossessed etc. because I would never be able to obtain
financing. I would probably not be able to put down a down
payment...maybe a rent to own place.  As you know I live in
New Mexico now but would like to get back to Texas if possible.
Most of my grandkids are in and around Houston. When I leave
this job I will have approximately $900/mo in social security
coming in so will need to find extra work.

Maybe you could put out the word that I am looking for a
place to live and see if anyone has any suggestions or maybe
you have some thoughts about it you could share with me.? I
had heard there were g-vernment grants for getting homes but
I don't know for sure or how one would inquire about it.

Thanks...Margaret
