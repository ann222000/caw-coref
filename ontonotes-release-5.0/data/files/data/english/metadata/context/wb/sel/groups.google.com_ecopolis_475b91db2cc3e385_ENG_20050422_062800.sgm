U.S. researchers said it is possible to determine the health of an
ecosystem just by analyzing the DNA of microbes living in it.

In a report in the April 22 issue of the journal Science, researchers
at the U.S. Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute said they
have demonstrated capture of the DNA profile of microbes that reflects
the presence and levels of nutrients, pollutants, and other features in
a local ecosystem.

For example, there should be more genes associated with breaking down
plant material in the soil and more genes for photosynthesis in water
where light is the microbes' major energy source. The abundance or of
lack genes for certain functions can tell scientists about the health
of the environment at the location where the sample was taken.

The snapshot of all the genes in a sample is called a dubbed
environmental genomic tag or EGT.

These fingerprints can be used to reveal environments under stress as
well as signal progress in remediating contaminated environments. This
may well develop environmental ecology into a fully quantitative
science, said Raymond Orbach, director of the department's Office of
Science, which supported the research.
