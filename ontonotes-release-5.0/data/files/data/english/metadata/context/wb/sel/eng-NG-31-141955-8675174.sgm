What emits from Pastor Melissa Scott's mouth are
evil humors drained by infected dental roots and
gum disease, nourished by her parasitic lust for
money, which I see hasn't changed.

For two supposedly intelligent, though medically
ignorant adults, Gene and Melissa Scott certainly
have no compunction about sounding off their
preposterous health stories. They must believe
their audiences are so foolish or enthralled that
they will buy their colonic content without
putting their stories into a frame of reference
or check accessible information.

I haven't watched or followed her for awhile, as
she swings from one vine to the next, like some
crazed Jane, to assert dominance over the lower
animal kingdom life forms.

From the comments here, much that she has
apparently declared is at best illogical and more
probably, utter nonsense and self-serving exaggerations.

It is true that a dentist with additional two or more
years of training can become an oral surgeons with
a D.D.S.  Although uncommon, some oral surgeons
are M.D.s typically with a focus on &quot;oral maxillofacial&quot;
disorders, such as congenital deformities, trauma,
severe infections and cancer. The M.D.s are usually
trained through 5 years of plastic surgery or ENT
otolaryngology, with another 1 to 2 years fellowship.

It's conceivable that an oral surgeon would order
a CAT scan of the jaws which would include some
brain imaging, but not read the brain findings. Instead
the study would be read and reported out by a
radiologist, which in urban centers is often a
neuroradiologist. They have an additional 1 to 2
years of training after radiology.

The roots of the cuspids and bicuspids can
protrude through the floor of the maxillary sinuses
causing abscesses and sinus infection which must
be cleaned out, but not by an oral surgeon.

Bone infection of the mandible or maxilla, upper jaw,
can be caused by dental sources and require surgical
cleaning out or antibiotics, or both.

A panoramic x-ray study, the panalipse, is the
standard dental imaging study beyond the typical
bite wings for cavities and position of the teeth.

For TMJ, CAT scans of the temporomandibular
joint are  obtained before surgical correction
is advised.  MRI scans show more soft tissue detail
than CTs which typically are best for bone detail.

Depending on the purpose and the medical questions
being asked, both a CT and an MRI could be obtained
to identify the extent of a problem affecting both bone
and soft tissues or to plan surgical approaches.
Knowing the blood vessel, nerve and other anatomy
can help identify landmarks and weigh the pros and
cons of different operative approaches or other therapy.

It makes no sense that Melissa would arrive in a
dentist's office for oral surgery and be sent for a CT
first, on the spot. Even if she had a seizure or serious
problem, she would be sent to an emergency room
for an exam first, then if appropriate the ER would obtain
a scan.

CTs are done in separate facilities that are regulated for shielding of
radiation. They are not done in a dental
or medical office.

If she had a CT, it would be read by a radiologist in
the facility where it was done and a written report
prepared. It's inconceivable that an oral surgeon
would tell a patient there's an abnormality on the
brain images, without a radiologist's interpretation.

A preliminary reading, known as a &quot;wet read&quot; will
be available by phone to the ordering doctor on
the same day, often within minutes to hours,
especially if there's an abnormality.

An MRI scan to follow, the same day, on an outpatient
who is walking and talking is also inconceivable. There
are certain emergencies such as major head trauma
or ruptured brain aneurysm that warrant same day
CT and MRI, with MRA (MR angiogram), if appropriate.

Not in babbling pontificators who are well enough to
go on televised broadcast the next day.

Unless there's an emergency it's difficult to obtain
an on the spot same day CAT or MRI scan. They are on
different machines with different technicians and
schedules that are separate. One doesn't pop in for
one and follow with the other then drive home.

If both are obtained on an intact outpatient, they
typically are at least a few days apart to allow time to
review them in detail and decide information from the
second scan is necessary to diagnose and or treat.

Whether Melissa or any patient is loaded doesn't
matter since most payment of scan expenses is
determined by insurance allowances. The two studies
together, and assuming she received IV constrast
materials to make certain findings light up, could
run four to six grand.

It sounds like a hokey bunch of drama to dredge up
some sympathy. Maybe she is setting it up for some
miracle, like the falling PSA numbers Gene flaunted
and probably deceived himself with.

If there's anything at all to her story, her smoking
history would make her at risk for oral cancers which
can start in an infected area or look like ulcers.
The risk is directly proportional to &quot;pack-years&quot;
which are the number of years a smoker smoked
times the number of packs per day.

If she smoked two packs a day for twenty years,
that's a 40 pack year history and enough to start
sprouting oral, pharyngeal or laryngeal cancer.

Some people get a local reaction to the materials
used in veneers and whitening preparations which
increases inflammation and mucosal breaks for
infection.  From the older programs it looked
like her pre-veneer dental hygiene left much to
be desired. That leads to infection below the gums.

If the dentist found some holes not caused by implants,
a CT first to look for the extent and other bone disease
would be reasonable, though not usually on the same
day. Melissa might have thrown a fit if he saw cause
to hesitate fixing her teeth. If demanded and declared
urgent a CT could have been obtained. If it was
suspicious for a soft tissue mass near bone, or seen
unexpectedly on the brain, an MRI could be appropriate.

However, to do the two studies and to tell her there
was some abnormality he saw, the dentist would have
to be dumber than Melissa to go ahead and operate
on her for ten hours until 8 pm. That would require
at least IV sedation if not general anesthesia.

If she had an abscessed tooth or fracture risking the
tooth, opening that in the face of abnormal brain
scans would be appropriate, but not 10 hours of
presumeably elective oral surgery.  Emergencies
would include severe acute infection or trauma.

Her announcement to the world that she's abnormal
without a diagnosis is suspciously foolish or deceitful.
Public figures are more apt to keep health problems
discreet than to run off at the mouth trying to make
them more serious than they are, especially
without announcing what the problem is and what
they plan to do to treat or address it.

It makes about as much sense as Gene Scott's
declaring himself healed of prostate cancer because
his PSA levels went down after biopsies were
positive for an aggressive cell type of cancer, even
if it was too small to be imaged on the MRIs then.

The ring of something contrived is as strong as in
Melissa's claims that other pastors call her all the
time, as if to compliment her or learn from her.

I  know two highly regarded ministers who have
called her out of concern for what she's doing.
They offered her some wisdom and spiritual guidance,
which she's said to have rebuffed from every
other minister who  has tried to talk some
sense into her. Some fear for and pray for
her soul and for her congregation.

Here is a link to PMS talking about all of this:
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7287650357991317364#6m

On viewing it a second time, it looks like PMS had the CT Scan and
MRI on some other day prior to the surgery.  The dentist reviewed
the results with her the day of the surgery.

Just had a thought.  If something looked abnormal in the brain in a
CT/MRI scan, would a typical surgeon proceed with the surgery?  No way!

It's highly implausible that a dentist would venture
to discuss brain MRI or CT results, unless a
radiologist's report raised a question about some
possible abnormality warranting &quot;interpretation
or follow up as clinically indicated.&quot;  This language
is also known as arse covering by the radiologist
who has limited information about the patient.

e.g. &quot; 40 year old Cauc female smoker with bizarre
fits, delusions, hallucinations and dental root abscesses.
Rule out infection, CVA, tumor, pseudotumor,
hydrocephalus, shift, anencephaly or other etiology&quot;

If a comment on an abnormality was &quot;soft&quot;, an urgent
or minor dental procedure could be done, but if there
was a serious or definite brain abnormality and the
dental procedure was elective or cosmetic, that wouldbe delayed. An eight
or ten hour surgery probably means
general anesthetic which would be too risky with a newly diagnosed brain
abnormality. That would be the
anesthesiologist's call, unless the oral surgeon
administers nitrous oxide or does IV sedation in the office.

A competent oral surgeon would insist that she was
cleared by a neurologist or neurosurgeon first.

Melissa's story makes no more sense than her volunteering
at area hospitals and giving cookies to inpatients.

When she's this dishonest about these things for no
apparent reason or pressure, it reveals her ignorance
and the disrespect she has for being truthful with her
listeners on any other subject.

It's disingenous to go on and on about her dental surgery
without naming the diagnosis or surgery.

When she's this dishonest about these things for no
apparent reason or pressure, it reveals her ignorance
and the disrespect she has for being truthful with her
listeners on any other subject.

It's disingenous to go on and on about her dental surgery
without naming the diagnosis or surgery.-Jacko

WM-You said it. It hard to get out of a person with her past, the old ways
of operation. She probably thinks God is the big gig, the ultimate John,
shes still the pole dancer. Gods there only to serve that need to be the
private dancer.

Her compassion for example all goes back to her, its all about her.

Melissa said she had major surgery--- this was before the dental
work--maybe 3 weeks before.
Recently she stated that she had surgery in May.
Does anyone else remember hearing this crap?
It was on recent festivals.
She has never mentioned the type of major surgery,but used it as a guilt
trip since she was there and did not take time off.

Right on!

Perhaps the scan of the cranial cavity revealed a complete lack of
gray matter with the ability to relay factual Biblical information
without breaking down into incomprehensible blather and further
complicated by an ignorance of the correct pronunciation of at least 3
words in every &quot;sermon&quot;.

Diagnosis - a 35+  year old woman with the approximate abilities of a
15 year old.  Recommendation - a loooooong vacation in the Bahamas and
10 years' study in depth at a well-regarded seminary.
