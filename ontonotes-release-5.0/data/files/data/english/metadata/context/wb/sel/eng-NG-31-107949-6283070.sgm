I have now been riding again for a couple of years now, been a regular
here almost as long and now find myself wanting to ride with some other,
the problem with this is, there is a local riding group but from the
looks of some of the club photos, it looks like most of the riders are a
bit older, I would prefer to ride more with riders a little closer to my
own age group. Now I may investigate the local group a bit more and
maybe even do a ride or two when they have open rides, I don't want to
spend to join a group that I am not interested in riding with. So I
guess what this boils down to is this: Has anyone ever started a riding
group? Whats the hardest part? I would think it's probably getting new
riders. How would you go about such an endeavor if you were inclined to
make such an attempt? Thanks in advance for all the input.

What does age matter?  You aren't looking to date any of them are you?
Go riding with them until you feel you can't learn anything more from
them or feel uncomfortable riding with them.  Search out other clubs
and organized rides in your area.  Check your local craigslist.com for
other riders, or people selling/wanting bicycles.  Check
http://www.bikejournal.com for other riders in your area.  Some of the
fastest riders around are the retirees cause they have all day to ride.

Once you make a few cycling friends, perhaps you can set up your own
club if a lot of you have differences from the other riders.

They might keep you active.  Find people to bike with on a regular basis
might be just what you are looking for.

Well I have my reasons for not wanting to ride with riders that much
older than myself. Maybe for something different once in a great while
but not on a regular basis. There is only one local club and that is the
one I mentioned. Thanks for the idea of craigslist and bikejournal.

You know, I've been thinking about getting a group together here [1] as well,
not because I don't like the local club, but rather because there *is no*
club to ride with [2]. However, I'm not certain that I'd care for a formal
structure rght away, so much as just getting some folks together to ride. Our
homeowner's association has a bulletin board on their web site, so that might
be one place for me to start.

I do have one standing offer of a riding partner from an friend, but he lives
an hour away right now, and is in China for the rest of the month, so I don't
expect to see him until spring.

[1] Gilberts, IL

[2] There was a club in the West/East Dundee area, the Dundee-Cardunal [3]
bicycle club, but they seem to have gone dormant; their site has even gone
404 now. Dundee is also about a 45 minute ride down from my house, and I'd
prefer not to drive to the start point of a ride -- the point is to ride!

[3] The misspelling of Cardunal is intended: it's short for CARpentersville/
DUNdee/ALgonquin, the three groups of towns along a stretch of the Fox
River.

I've been away and so I'm responding late to this post.

1. If you actually show up, you might find that there is more of a variety
of ages in the group than it appears. It's possible that the younger group
doesn't have any people who care to take pictures.
2. Ask them what other groups are in the area.  Most people seem happy to
share this information, although naturally they think the group they ride
with is best. (and it probably is, for THEM)
3. Around here, you can ride with a group a few times before they get
serious about collecting dues, assuming they ever do. There's no real
investment involved.

The only group I was involved in starting was a spin-off.  Some of us were
refereeing youth soccer, and thought it would be good conditioning / a bit
of fun to go for a ride on Saturday morning. Sometimes there were a few
older (5th-8th grade) kids along.  We did this for two or three years.  You
might do a spin-off from a fitness center, a church men's group, or
something else.

I actually ran into my current group on livejournal.  seattlebikes and
bikepirates was a good place (for me anyway) to find interesting people
to bike with.

It's a fairly recent club, it started a little over 2 years ago.  If you
wander over to point83.com/forum and post the same question, you might
get some more ideas about how to start your own cycling group.  Of
course if you use an internet site to organize your membership, you're
self selecting for computer people, which can be good and bad...

Legal issues are probably the biggest consideration.  Like, what if
someone gets hurt and so forth.  You may not be an official club, but
I'd worry about any laws, local or otherwise, which may beg to differ
with you on that!  I know it sounds ridiculous, but...maybe it's
'cause I'm in New York, with half the world's lawyers here....

In my case -- and I'm in NYC -- it's definitely mostly middle-aged
folks.  Stands to reason.  Those are the people who do not seem to

Even though this is NYC, there aren't any that want to do any inter-
state and inter-city riding.  You'd think there was a market for this
kind of thing here, but no -- everybody's either a skinny limp-wristed
racer or a fatty who likes riding "around the block" (close to home).

There's a reason why most cyclists cycle alone or in pairs at most.

Don't draft any paperwork that calls you a "club". Then you are just a
group of cyclists that happen to be riding together.
That should make you lawyer-proof.
Having each other's phone numbers and informally riding together doesn't
make a club. You could have a separate '5s' for cycling activities. The
'5s' is for cell phones as seen on television (over and over).

I'm not sure about that.  For example, look at so-called "common law

they split the guy's still liable to pay child-support for her kids

Dude, this is liberal NYC, and the City wants bicyclists numbering
more than twenty (or whatever the exact number is) to apply for a
parade permit first.  Wedding and funeral processions in cars are all
right, but bicyclists they want to crack down on....

I'm just saying, you never know...sometimes the law thinks in the "if
it looks like duck and walks like a duck" frame-of-mind...if folks
meeting regularly to ride can look to a casual observer to be a bike
club, the law may decide that for all practical intents and purposes
they are!  I hope not, of course, but you hear about crazy lawyer-shit
in the news all the time....

Yeah, but they're both fruits!  So maybe if you're after Vitamin C,
then it does matter whether you have an orange or an apple, but if you
just feel like a healthy snack, then no, it doesn't matter too
much...I'm just saying that the City has some weird ideas about
cycling (I'd really like to meet the asses who started the whole "a
bike is a vehicle" mentality, such that now biking peaceably on
sidewalks is considered a crime), and I'd not be too surprised if
things turn out as I fear...I'm telling you, I have a lot of
experience with lawyers, and they really can con the devil himself out
his dues (ever read "Merchant of Venice"??)....

It's very curious, but I'm not sure Mayor Bloomberg even notices
bicycling matters, unlike his personal interest in gun control and
public health and grand building projects...no, the anti-bicycling
impetus seems to be from the NYPD for some reason....

Keeping the idiots out. If you have a 'ride type' in mind, whether it
be slow, conversational or fast, paceline practice, or hammer to stop
signs, getting everybody on the same page, safely, is a chore.

I must disagree.  AFAIK, bicyclists have always had road rights, as do
even pedestrians.  Driving is a *priviledge* -- it's licensed, after
all -- and I'm afraid we lose sight of that because human nature finds
it easy to bully the Little Guy....

No, bicyclists have always had road rights.  Bikes predate
automobiles!  And I don't see any benefit at all to this "a bike is a
vehicle too!" mentality -- if you really believed that, you'd be
calling for us to be licensed (with plates!) and insured as well, like
any other vehicle!

What, should skateboarders and foot-scooters have to wear helmets and
stay off sidewalks, too??  How about folks jogging at 10 mph???

Damned fascists!!

the Chicago suburbs where I could ride into the city, but chose to ride
away from it. Riding in Chicago seemed so improbable that even at 14 I
took the Metra train and hooked up with the 'El' subway/skyway system
then took buses to things like the museums. I don't know if Chicago is
bike unfriendly by law, but my common sense tells me I want to be in a

Sidewalks being illegal does not make much sense unless some hot shots
tried 20 MPH and actually caused accidents that got the law passed.
8 MPH on a sidewalk beats 20 MPH in traffic, for me, at least.

Many highways (used in the technical sense) either

a) include the pavement set aside for pedestrians; or

b) have no such pavement, and all traffic uses the road surface.

Now of course, there are differences in the details depending on the
jurisdiction, but the essential difference which results in cyclists
(and pedestrians) having a _right_ to use the roads and drivers of
motor-cars having merely a _permission_, is that driving a motor-car
is not permitted unless the individual who wishes to do so asks to do
so, pays some form of fee to do so, and undergoes various tests to
determine if he or she should be allowed to do so; whereas the
cyclists' (and pedestrians') right to use the roads exists ab initio.

No, Bloomy's been mayor for the past, what, five or six years now.  He

own jet or two for undisclosed getaways.  Seeing how he grew up middle-

One of my great life ambitions is to simply bike ride in Chicago.  I
hear the waterfront is especially attractive for that, with designated
lanes and scenic views.

Riding with cars, weaving through traffic, is a great bicycling
experience, Bill.  I've even done it with a recumbent during summer
rush-hour in NYC, through Times Square and all!  It's not dangerous at

New York's got bike riding, Bill -- and honestly, you can even ride on
the sidewalks, for all the fascists around!  Most cops would rather
chase robbers than bicyclists, and most New Yorkers are still

Again, glad you're part of the Rebel Alliance, Bill!  Yes, I think
5mph-8mph on the sidewalk with a bike isn't bad at all.  Bicyclists
really ought to be more considerate, I agree, but to categorically
deny bikes sidewalk access is just fucking fascist, and a remedy worse
than the problem it would solve.

More folks die from cars running onto sidewalks than from being run

Darwin applies. Like the fool who walked in front of a train while zoned
out to his I-Tunes. He cut himself out of the gene pool very
effectively. Unfortunately it applies in reverse too, like the girl in
San Jose who ran down 4 legal cyclists with her Bronco while searching
for a tape on the passenger floor at 45 MPH. They had a bike lane.
She, and the logging trucks are reasons why I ride on the wrong side of
the road in some bicycle unfriendly areas. No bike lane or shoulder on
either side but usually a ditch to dive into for emergencies. One
section is cut out of rock and the only way to get past is to look for a
break of about 1/4 to 1/2 mile and then haul ass, uphill.
That could get a riding group sued if anyone actually planned a ride
through that pass. That was the post, wasn't it?

&gt;&gt; Many city kids never get a chance to ride a bike,
&gt;&gt; due to money, theft, and parents concerns over the freedom to go into
&gt;&gt; bad areas. The closest I have ever come to a big city was growing up in
&gt;&gt; the Chicago suburbs where I could ride into the city, but chose to ride
&gt;&gt; away from it. Riding in Chicago seemed so improbable that even at 14 I
&gt;&gt; took the Metra train and hooked up with the 'El' subway/skyway system
&gt;&gt; then took buses to things like the museums. I don't know if Chicago is
&gt;&gt; bike unfriendly by law, but my common sense tells me I want to be in a
&gt;&gt; car in that city.

&gt; One of my great life ambitions is to simply bike ride in Chicago.  I

I was born there and I have and it is. If the wind is coming off the
lake it tames the hot days for a great ride. You can almost ride along
the lake all the way up into Wisconsin but there are a few 'iffy' places
where you probably don't want to get off the bike, much less leave it
unlocked. Near the museums is good riding. If you wind up inside a
museum plan on it taking at least 2 days to get your fill.

I ride with the cars in my small town of about 30,000 and it isn't a

&gt; New York's got bike riding, Bill -- and honestly, you can even ride on
&gt; the sidewalks, for all the fascists around!  Most cops would rather
&gt; chase robbers than bicyclists, and most New Yorkers are still
&gt; immigrant enough to recognize a bicycle when they see one, and not
&gt; mistake it for a &quot;vehicle.&quot;

&gt; Just mind your speed, of course.

&gt;&gt; Sidewalks being illegal does not make much sense unless some hot shots

&gt; really ought to be more considerate, I agree, but to categorically
&gt; deny bikes sidewalk access is just fucking fascist, and a remedy worse

traffic.
Out in the boondocks where I ride there are sometimes some 3 or 4 mile

Not sure if being in debt with T-Bills is so bad...let's face it: when
it comes to the government, they have so much more leeway than any
individual private citizen, especially simple ordinary working class
ones...but if you must look at the situation in a personal way, then
think of the the government selling T-Bills to China like you writing
an IOU on a Post-It Note to the neighborhood Chinese restaurant guy,
promising to pay your check next week...if you don't pay up, ain't
nothing going to happen.  You look bad, you might even feel bad, and
you can't go eat there anymore, but no big deal.  Likewise the US
government...it wants its good name and credit, to be sure, but
there's always another generation of taxpayers -- and that's the
triple truth.

So it's one of them wink-wink situations; you can't be casual about it
publicly, but of course actions speak louder than words, and it's
clear no one's worried because who's really harmed?  Some amorphous
next generation...heck, if worse comes to worst, they'll just do "an
Africa" and decide unilaterally not to pay.  So what?

I'm simplifying things, of course -- economic sanctions, freezing of
assets, etc. -- but you get the drift...no one wants to be the tax
collector -- there's no policeman here, so what's to worry?  You can
always renegotiate terms, blah blah blah...it's how business gets
done.  They play by a whole different set of rules than we do as
individuals of limited means.

Kinda like how cars take to the road versus bicycles, if you think
about it.  The different scales involved make for very different
options.

Conditions were that bad.

I'm reminded of that film "Europa Europa," when, in September 1939,
Poland was invaded from both sides, and the voiceover said, "the Jews
scrambled for the Russians and the Poles scrambled for the Germans."

Talk about your half-pence place, as the Irish say.

I have that very nice Outdoor Research Gorilla Wind Stopper
Bavaclava.  Unfortunately, my situational awareness is greatly
diminished.  I didn't realize how much input I had from my hearing and
peripheral vision!  But donning that whole head, full-face bavaclava,
great as it is against the elements, really makes me feel like a horse
with blinders on.

No, really, the co-leader had a fit about my not having my helmet on,
though I was off my bike with both feet on the ground serving as a
drop (which I'd even volunteered to do!  I wasn't even appointed as
one that particular time; I'd volunteered!  'Cause I'm always ahead of
the pack anyway, it's not like I'd get stuck behind, etc.).  But he
went after me for not having a water bottle!

Of course, as well as you know me by now through usenet, I got the
last laugh: I says okay, I'm off the ride, I can ride without a
helmet, then -- and I just tagged along: right back at my spot behind
the ride leader!  Who was a very cool dude, BTW.  Was the complete
opposite of his high-strung water bottle Nazi co-leader.  And that was
interesting, how you might have two ride leaders paired who are such
opposites.  I've seen it on other occasions, where some ride leaders
are a bit more casual about where they drop someone, and others drop
at every single turn, even when it's obvious traffic could have only
gone one way (for example, at a fork where one of the roads has a big
"Dead End" sign).

Well, you pay dues, I imagine.  That particular ride is hosted by teh
5BBC and they're otherwise cool about folks just joining for a ride,
sans membership or any fees.  But there's a few helmet and water
bottle Nazis among the ride leaders there.
