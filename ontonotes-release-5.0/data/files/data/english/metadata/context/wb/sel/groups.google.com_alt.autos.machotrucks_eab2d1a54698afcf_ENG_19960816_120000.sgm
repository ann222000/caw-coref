I live in Tucson, AZ and today I think I saw a surburban like Ford? It
was approximately the same size as a suburban but the back was identical
to a Bronco's. When I got closer, there was a sign on the back that
said Centurian next to the ford symbol. On the side, it said something
like F350. I was going a little too fast when I passed it to be sure.
I also think that it was a diesel from the sound of the engine. Does
anyone know anything about this truck? Is it just some custom rig that
I would never be able to afford? I posted a messege a few weeks back
asking if anyone knew of an alternative to the suburban and this vehicle
never came up. It looked pretty new.

"/> I have seen the Centurian every so often like yourself. When I
inquired about the vehicle at the local dealership they knew nothing
about it. I would guess it was a very limited production vehicle or
perhaps a custom manufactured in small quantities. Also, I had heard
somewhere that Ford tried to manufacture a direct competitor to the
Suburban but production was held off due to a lawsuit by GM.

Ford is supposed to be coming out with their Expedition next year. I
read that it's supposed to be somewhere between the Suburban and 4
door Tahoe vehicles in size. Price can only be expected to be similar
to the GM's when it does hit showrooms.

"/> I believe that Centurion is a customizer of Ford trucks. For years, I've
seen a number of body modifications that bear the Centurion name.

I've also seen a version of the truck you mention. Based on an F350
extended-cab truck, the Centurion conversion puts what appears to be a
permanent shell on the back. I didn't get a good look at the interior
of the truck, although I had more time to study it, since it was fueling
at a gas station.

If I remember what the F350's cost, the conversion would probably set you
back a total of $35k, including the cost of the truck. True, it's a one-ton,
but I've seen 3/4 ton Suburbans for under $28k recently...

"/> For what its worth there have been Ford Centurions around
since the mid-1980's. My favorite is the E 350 4 door van
with the pick-up box set up to haul a 5th wheel trailer.
The suburban style is also quite nice but they are all way
to pricey for my wallet.

These trucks are put together or finished by a *bail-bill
jobber* in this case a company named Centurion. This is the
same kind of situation as Mark lll Conversion Vans or various
companies that turn vans into 4 wheel drive vehicles, all
without voiding the warranty.

A company or group sees a need or niche or market that is too
small for the manufacturer to bother with. They submit a plan
and plans to the maker, who runs the whole thing through the
engineering/liability gambit and if approved, the partial
vehicle or parts are made available to the jobber.

You can order a vehicle from your dealer delivered with right-
hand drive. It will be converted/finished by a jobber like this.

Now if you ordered an E 350 extended with a 4 wheel-drive
conversion, a Centurion 4 seat interior and a Conversion double
sleeper with kitchette and mini-shower/potty I bet you could drop a
quick 100K. You could probably get right-hand drive for another
5 or 6!

Centurian is a shop that just makes a living on customizing Fords.
I have a 95' Chevy Blazah. My wife drives it. Chevy makes a nice
&quot;Ladies Truck&quot;. I have a 97' SuperCab Lariot that my wife loves to
drive.

Some guy in a Yukon stopped me today and asked about the mileage in my
truck. Wonder why he was even looking at a Ford:)

I have heard tell of a Ford &quot;Expedition&quot; for 97 which will have an
F150/250/350 chassis, Explorer front-end body style, and a passenger box
somewhere in size between the Suburban and the smaller Yukon. Anyone else
hear of such a thing?

Yep. There are preview photos of it in all the 4x4 truck magazines.
Looks just like an Explorer till you see them parked next to each other.
You have the details right. It will be market-positioned to compete with
the Suburban.
