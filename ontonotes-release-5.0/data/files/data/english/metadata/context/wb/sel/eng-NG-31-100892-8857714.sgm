Ask yourself why you wish to do something. Is it for inner peace?

Or to massage your ego?

Or because it feels good?

Or to improve ones karmic debt?

Or to fit in?

Or because others say so?

Or to hurt another?

Or to try and escape the consequences of our actions? What is your
driving force?

Fear based reasons for doing something are not authentic and natural
actions.

The persons actions are based on negative consequences otherwise they
would not do them.

My actions are based on inner peace and if I stray - there goes my
peace - it is my choice.

Put your inner peace foremost and you will have your answer.

When you align real and authentic actions with those that promote
inner peace you have found enlightenment.

There is a method to our madness when it comes to addictions. We
derive the following benefits from participating in our various
addictions.

&quot;7 Benefits We Derive From Our Addictions&quot;

1) Pain Reliever

Addictions help distract us from our pain. Most of this pain is
generated from an endless cycle of wrong living that produces more
pain and requires more drugging through the application of our various
addictions to try and diminish the pain. Other times we use this pain
relief our addictions provide us to dull physical pain we might be
suffering from health problems just as a doctor gives us a pill to
take to dull the pain.  You can do an experiment in this pain relief
area. If you have pain in your hand for instance, start stoking you
arm lightly. It diminishes the pain in one area and pout new
concentration in a sensation elsewhere. Addicts take natural pain
relievers and turn them into pain generators. Handicapped addicts
suffering great pain have a much harder time with finding peace - for
there is never a complete escaping of their pain even if they
restructure their life. Such addicts should get support from &quot;like
kind&quot; and seek out recovery groups along this specialized area of
handicapped addicts as well as using traditional recovery groups.

2 Pressure Relief

We use addictions to help blow off stream from stressed and unbalanced
life we live though overextending ourselves to the point of breaking
by living a lifestyle of &quot;jugglers syndrome&quot; and by having too many
irons in the fire. In a lecture I once heard, Thich Nhat Hanh
describes the Buddha as sitting on a lotus blossom which was regarded
as a sign of peace and serenity in earlier times. Hanh goes on to say
that nowadays, many people sit on burning coals instead of sitting on
a lotus blossom, so no wonder they cannot find any peace. We make no
time for inner peace, we are too busy for such useless things a
meditation and relaxation. It feels good to get drunk and drugged up
or spend money and acquire things or eat junk foods or have sex or
even blow up in rage once in a while.  One person mentioned how
&quot;profanity&quot; provides a release denied even by prayer, so for some of
us having a rage attack can provides a pressure relief. I had to learn
to channel my pressure through other healthy release valves as well as
not participating in a life that built up excess pressure within me.
Adrenal steroids (cortisol) secreted when a person is under stress
reach the brain and over time can affect the structure of the brain.
We also produce cortisol from any other stressors the body perceives,
whether it is physical stress, such as a sickness, injury, surgery, or
temperature extremes as well as psychological stress that we and the
world put on us. Each of us has produces a different amount of these
chemicals and has a different sensitivity to them and this might be
the missing link as to a part of the question as to why some of us are
more addictive than others with how we each produce and react to these
stress chemicals differently.

3) Time Filler

The devil finds work for idle hands - Thoreau. Many time I have heard
an addict say they went to their addiction out of boredom cause they
had nothing else to do to pass time. Developing a list of positive
time fillers that are healthy and sustainable was a big breakthrough
for me with my recovery work. (My earlier post entitled &quot;Positive Time
Fillers&quot; goes into more detail on this subject, if you missed it and
want a copy write me.)

4) Escape Vehicle

Addictions make great escape vehicles to distract us from our problems
- most of what we have created for ourselves by living unbalanced
lives.  We get enough problems in life for free - no use adding fuel
to the fire. This is what Voluntary Simplicity does for me in a
nutshell. It helps reduce the problems I generate on my end and makes
life more bearable so less escaping of the present is needed. I try
and catch myself when I practice this escapism and work to bring my
thoughts back to the present. Whenever the fantasy starts I check to
see what I am escaping from? Why do I fixate on something else instead
of where I'm at?  Are the problems and reasons I am trying to escape
from due to irregularities, falsehoods or lies I perpetuate?  Can I
change these problems or do I have to work on accepting them as the
serenity prayer says? Being dishonest was the foundation of most of my
earlier troubles.  Once I started with the 12 steps in correcting
these irregularities, things got slowly better and this gave me hope
to keep working in the right direction.  Inventory work identifies all
these problems and gets them off your back when you give them away. No
one is perfect, even so-called normal people go too far once in a
while, so we should not beat ourselves trying to hold ourselves to a
standard above the normal, non addicted person. As addicts we become
super sensitized to our various addictions and can really beat
ourselves with anything associated with them.  But, we have to
continue to take inventory work as long as we live and correct any
mistakes as soon as we realize them if we want continued peace.  (My 6
page post entitled &quot;Putting Peace First&quot; goes into more detail on this
subject, if you missed it and want a copy write me.) Practicing
mindfulness of the present moment as part of a Buddhist practice has
helped with staying in the present as well as working the 12 steps to
restructure my life into one that is pleasant to live and not one I
need to hide from.

5) Pleasure Vehicle

As sensation addicts we like the sensation we get when we participate
in our addiction. It feels good to receive the brain chemicals or high
I get when I participate in my drug of choice. In short, if it feels
good I over do it and keep doing it until it turns into pain - then
and only then I know I need to stop.
The normal person does not have to go this far to know when to stop,
and if they do go too far, they quickly turn things around as they see
the activity not a healthy way to live. Not so with addicts, as they
will refuse to stop even under penalty of jail or death. This is
what's separates the addicts from the normal person - stopping
ability. I had to accept that some things are just too exciting for my
sensations and stimulate my brain chemicals too much to play with,
irrespective of fixing the hole in my soul or not. I learned to use
new positive ways to feel good that were sustainable and not
destructive. But, addiction recovery is never a perfect path. Some
addictions require participation in such as eating, spending or sex
and an addict must have mechanical tools of clarity as well as
spiritual tools for inner recovery to develop a balanced recovery
program with these addictions.  (If you missed my earlier post
entitled &quot;Mechanical and Spiritual Tools of Recovery&quot; and what a copy
write me) But, once we experience a change in our path of living and
we see we can derive pleasure from other areas that are healthy and
sustainable, we can see there is a choice in how we live and decide on
which path to take. Balanced living is also of prime concern - or
following the middle path of moderation the Buddha laid out in his
teachings. A path of moderation which rejects both sensory indulgence
and the extremes of self mortification and denial. When we find more
pleasure in staying abstinent, sober solvent and are living a balanced
life within our comfortable means we have turned the corner and are
home.

In the book &quot;How to Want What You Have&quot; it details the addicts plight.

&quot;People who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of sensual pleasure
find that the more pleasure they get, the more they want. Small,
ordinary pleasures soon lose their power to please and must be
replaced with more intense or exotic ones. Heedless sensualists
usually meet a bad end. They learn the hard way that their desires are
relentless and insatiable.&quot;

6) Mystical or Religious Experience

Yes, our addiction is our religion.  All our addictions have pleasure
aspects within

What influences this state of uncertainty if you have to make a
choice, does your philosophy solve the problem itself or is it
something like meditation where you slow the mind down and you might
be better able to find a solution to the problem?

Is this &quot;divided opinion&quot; like the theory of cognitive dissonance I
pasted below?

Cognitive Dissonance Theory

&quot;Inconsistency among related beliefs . . .produces motivation to do
whatever is easiest in order to regain cognitive consistency or
consonance among beliefs.&quot; --Jones and Gerard

During the late 1950's Leon Festinger developed the cognitive
dissonance theory to explain attitude formation and change. According
to the theory, there is a tendency to seek consistency among their
cognitions (i.e., ideas, beliefs, opinions).

Cognitive dissonance is the state
of tension one feels after making
a decision, taking an action, or
being exposed to some information
that is (contrary) to a prior attitude
-(Zimbardo et al., 1999, p. 752).

The state of tension is
psychologically unpleasant,
so something must change to
reduce the dissonance --
usually the prior attitude.

For example, a person may believe smoking is bad for her health, but
when she starts smoking she finds herself with inconsistent cognitions
(&quot;Smoking is unhealthy&quot; and &quot;I smoke&quot;) creating an unpleasant state of
dissonance, so she changes her prior attitude (&quot;Smoking is not really
as bad for you as they make it seem&quot;). Festinger also theorized that,
if a person could sufficiently attribute their behavior to an external
influence, his dissonance would be lower and thus there would be a
lesser attitude change. For a great example of this, see Supporting
Studies.

Cognitive dissonance explains well the process of effort
justification. If a person puts for a great deal of effort (i.e.,
energy, time, money), he wants to feel like it was worth it. For
example, if someone pays a high price for a new car and finds the car
uncomfortable, he may experience dissonance and so to reduce it, he
alters his attitude about the car to be more positive. One well-known
study that supported this, showed that if someone puts forth a lot of
effort to get into a group, the dissonance of potentially working hard
for nothing causes them to reduce that dissonance by liking the group
more (Aronson, 1969).

Cognitive dissonance is by no means a full-proof theory for predicting
attitude change. People do not always change their attitudes when
there is dissonance. For one thing, people differ in how much
inconsistency they can tolerate. Another thing is that two cognitions
that seem inconsistent to one person may not be to another. Still,
despite some mixed results, many studies have supported the idea that
dissonance does underlie many of our attitude shifts.

I think if you sat back for a bit [lightly contemplated and specifically
&quot;asked&quot; your-Self for examples ] , and quietly recalled your own past, you'd
see some situations where you had expereinced your own &quot;cognitive
diossonace'. I believe it is a very common event ... it is often a trigger
for outbursts of anger and complaint.

In my experience, rather than dumping the past belief, it is usually a sign
of the power behind rejecting the new information being presented that
challenges one's accepted and critical internal beliefs. Either way it is a
very uncomfortable feeling, and can rattle people to their core. It's hard
to admit you have been wrong almost all your life, even to ourself in
private. That's what cognitive dissonance can do.

But it is also a very very postive sign of internal change, and shifts in
one's awareness and an expansion of our point of view on things. It depends
on the individuals character and general attitude.

and contray to a comment you made at the end, it isn't about a change in
attitude it really is about a challenge to one's pre-existing beliefs as
being not completely true.  Attitude is a way of being, cognitive dissonance
affects fixed ways of thinking/rationalising and beliefs, not attitudes ...
attitudes may change over time as a result of a change in thinking and one's
beliefs though.

imho, and expereince.

I was responding to the  &quot;divided opinion&quot; part and the &quot;cannot act&quot;

This can be either be as a result of brain programming (doing the best with
what you knew), where new patterns cause discomfort, or can be an
acknowledgement of bad judgment. Either way, it is the way of the &quot;way&quot;.
Wisdom comes only with hindsight (and some new brain programming to stop
repeat performances.
