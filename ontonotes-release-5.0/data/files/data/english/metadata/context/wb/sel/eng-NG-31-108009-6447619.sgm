I don't understand.  What is your concern?

Looks like your gonna have pretty small bowls for $40 or so.

I think I'd cry as every (expensive) chip hit the floor.

Hi Marty

I don't really like to say this, BUT, it is the way I feel, if you
don't know how to turn this wood, I think you could buy it, but first
get some more experience before you waste a very nice exotic piece of
wood.

Also this wood has allergens in it that a lot of people react badly
to, keep that in mind, other than that, a couple of nice little hollow
forms or a vase are within, you decide..

Have fun and take care
Leo Van Der Loo

Hi Marty.

Cocobolo is a lovely wood. It's not so lovely to work with though.
You'll need very sharp tools and ditto to Leo's comment. Wear all the
protection you can get. I've turned a fair amount of the stuff and I
now have to wear long sleeves, a full face respirator and make sure I
have the dust extractors running. I was okay at the beginning but over
the last year it sneaked on me and I've become very sensitized to it.
I end up itching all over.

The wood is very hard and very oily. If your tool work is good, you
don't need a finish as it will gleam like a mirror just from the
rubbing of the bevel. Take very small cuts as it will tear and rip big
chunks out at times if you aren't gentle with the tool. The pieces I
saw on the site look wonderful. Most of the cocobolo I've seen is the
darker reddish brown color. At times, you can get some that has the
most wonderful streaks of yellow, orange, pink and red, as well as the
reddish brown. The first time I saw that, it blew me away.

Have fun with the wood. Be careful and keep your tools very sharp. I
hope this helps.

Mike

Ditto on the comments abour cocobolla.  I do the dist collector, JDS
air filtration and Triton Power respirator route when I work with.  I
love the wood though.  I just picked up a spectacular board at
Woodcraft that had heartwood and all the reds and yellow streaks you
could want.
