I made a CD of some jpegs and put it into my DVD player just to see if
it would work. It did, of course, but I'm a little behind the times.

But...

The pictures, many of which were of waterfalls, looked &quot;pebbly&quot; to use
my daughter's word for it.  It's a low-end Sylvania 32&quot; lcd HDTV. The
jpgs ranged from 5 to 8 megapixels. Many of the photos look pretty
nice on my computer monitor. Some had been processed a bit
post-camera, but even the unprocessed ones didn't look so great.

I didn't sit and analyze the situation for too long, but it seemed
that the white parts of the picture stuck out too much, like what
might happen through excessive sharpening. I took a quick look at the
tv's contrast setting, which was set to maximum from the factory. I
backed hat off a bit, which helped some. Pictures without any really
bright areas didn't have as much of a problem.

The situation was especially bad for the vertical pictures, which of
course showed at a much smaller size on the screen. Any thoughts?

&gt;From your description I would hazard a guess that your HDTV or the DVD

player isn't terribly smart about downsampling larger images to match
the native vertical screen resolution of 768p or 1080p (depending on
the model). Crude downsampling by dropping pixels tends to introduce
sharp grainlike artefacts and aliassing feature like Moire patterns in
regular structures like fences and check cloth shirts. It is
suggestive that the problem is with downsampling because the effect is
more pronounced on portrait style images.

You may get better results if you use something like IrfanView to
batch downsize the images you want to display to match the native
vertical resolution of your TV.

Worth pointing out that a lot of LCD or Plasma TVs out of the box are
set for really brutal image sharpening, posterised colour and highest
contrast - you will see ringing around sharp edge transitions.
Superficially it helps sell kit in box shifter stores, but you can
usually adjust the image to get a better more natural picture than the
factory defaults. The manufacturers have learnt that sharpness sells
boxes - and act accordingly.

A still image that you can study tends to be much less forgiving of
setup config problems compared to a video stream where the image is
always moving.

Hope this helps.

We just got the TV Saturday. As I mentioned, the contrast was all the
way up. I was planning to revisit the settings when I had the time
anyway.

How are you getting the images on to the TV?  My own camera's TV output
is only analog, and only 640x480.

Also, it's the sharpen setting on the TV you should worry about, perhaps
more than the contrast.

You also have to remember the multiple stages of processing the images
are going through...

First, the image read off the CD is PROBABLY being downsampled to 480
vertical pixels.  Regardless of the quality of the resizing, it IS being
crushed down to that size.

Now by default, your player is probably set to output 420i (interlaced),
which will reduce the quality of the image.  If you're using a composite
or S-video cable to connect to the TV, that's the best you'll see; for
anything more than that, you have to use component or HDMI. If possible,
you want at least a 420p (progressive) output from the DVD player.

Then, IF your player can up-convert its output to 720 or 1080, it's now
taking the 420-pixel image resizing it back UP... and how well that
works will depend on the quality of the up-sampling process.

That will help, but again, the &quot;bottleneck&quot; is more likely the playback
capability of the DVD player, which is PROBABLY limited to 480 vertical
pixels... unless it's a good-quality player that's designed specifically
with high-res JPEGs in mind.

Ultimately, if you want a clean still image on your HDTV, the best thing
to do is just plug your computer right into its VGA or DVI port (most HD
sets have them), and just use it like a computer monitor.

Greg, in Irfanview's Resize/Resample dialog box, set Resampling filter
to Lanczos, which produces the best results when downsampling.

I just tried this myself and found that the quality I see varies
tremendously depending on how I get from the original picture to the HD
TV. I get nice quality with a VCD, but the horiziontal and vertical
scales are not the same no matter what I do  I get poor quality from
straight Jpegs on a CD, but one DVD player does better than another; I
have two.  The best quality comes from just inserting the original SD
card straight from the camera into a slot on the TV, but that's not a
convenient way to make up slide shows and save them.  I haven't yet
tried making DVDs of the images, but I suspect that may be the solution.

In short, so far I've found that there are a lot of variables, that it
is possible to get as high a quality as your set will allow, but I
haven't yet hit on the best way to burn a disc with a slide show of high
quality for a DVD player. I'm sure it can be done, but maybe it depends
on your HD TV and your DVD player and how they are set up.

Seeing as VCR spec is 352x240, you're lowering your resolution even
further going that way.

CD spec itself is 480p at best.  Up-converting players will scale
internally to 720 or 1080, but unless it also reads larger JPGs off the
disc without scaling them down first (which I would *expect* would be
limited to only high-end units), you're still just upsizing a smaller
picture.

It's hard to image that any of us will get HD quality images on our HD
TVs short of a Blu Ray or HD DVD player, or output via DVI or HDMI from
a computer with a very high resolution output. My MacBookPro is only
1440 x 900, way better than NTSC but not true Hi Def.

AFAIK, any &quot;decent&quot; contemporary DVD player (in about $80 range) will

[I did not check it myself yet, but I read what users write about

Contemporary digicams also have a possibility to encode HDTV on their
video outputs.  So if worst comes to worst, upload pictures to a
camera, and connect it to TV.

Hope this helps,

Sure it will READ them... but it still has to scale them down to NTSC
(or PAL, depending on where you are in the world) spec in order to
output them.  This is where the problem originates: in cheap players,
the scaling algorithm will be mediocre at best, which is why the
recommendation to resize them with decent software before putting them
on the disc.

Yes, according to the marketing info, this player does output larger
JPGs at (one presumes) the display's maximum resolution.  It still
requires the proper connection to do that as well - at least component,
ideally HDMI.  Of course, that only helps if the OP is willing to
replace his DVD player to go along with the new TV. It also assumes the
TV (which he classifies as &quot;low-end&quot; supports HDMI.  It likely doesn't
support anything over 720p.

My parents have a cheap UK PAL DVD recorder (chipped to be no region
like most UK kit) from their local supermarket &lt;£70. It plays my
6Mpixel JPEG images at 720p native resolution without any problem at
all. No visible artefacting - and I am picky. I don't doubt there are
some incredibly poxy ultra cheap players about but the new ones in the
UK mostly work fine. Using SCART or component video or HDMI in order
of increasing quality is necessary to get the required signal
bandwidth though.

I am not sure if I could tell if the image had been downscaled to 640
PAL lines and then upsampled to 720 by eye on ordinary material but on
a 1080p set it would be fairly obvious if that was the case. Their set
is only 720 lines.

My new set does not have either DVI or VGA, but HDMI,component, and
composite video. I didn't think it was worth it to spend the extra money
for a computer input, which may have been a mistake, and my computer is
in another room. But I have DVD players there all the time, already

I do want the full quality of the HD set. The original digital pictures
are much better. It can be done, as the images from the SD card slot on
the TV itself are full HD quality. They are in jpeg form on the SD card,
so the TV set has a good jpeg to HD conversion program. I guess the
challenge is to see how close I can come to this using a DVD input that
is upsampled by the DVD player and output through the HDMI interface.

When I use my laptop to display digital images with a high quality
projector, they are sharper and have more detail than HDTV can show.

&gt; Yes, according to the marketing info, this player does output larger
&gt; JPGs at (one presumes) the display's maximum resolution.  It still
&gt; requires the proper connection to do that as well - at least component,
&gt; ideally HDMI.  Of course, that only helps if the OP is willing to
&gt; replace his DVD player to go along with the new TV. It also assumes the
&gt; TV (which he classifies as &quot;low-end&quot; supports HDMI.  It likely doesn't
&gt; support anything over 720p.

As near as I can tell my Oppo 970HD, a cheap DVD machine with a jpeg
mode, can play them at the full resolution of the HD set over the HDMI
interface. It just thinks about it a while before it displays each picture.

Nice.  Resorting to insults now.  Real classy, shithead.

In fact, it IS noticeable... even on a computer.  Remember when all VGA
monitors were 60Hz interlaced?  Remember how much better it got when you
could go non-interlaced? The very fact that it was EVER an issue proves
that you'll get a better still image with progressive (aka
non-interlaced) over interlaced.

Interlacing still gives you &quot;shimmer&quot; that's even more pronounced on
still images than on a moving display, for the simple fact that it's NOT
changing.

Hello, Greg:

I don't know what the problem is. My Sanyo HT30744 (30&quot; wide-screen
HDTV) is a CRT, and usually does a fine job, displaying digital photos
and scans.

It's hooked to a Panasonic DMR-ES45V (VHS/DVD combination recorder), via
an HDMI connection. The latter device boasts an SD card slot and I can
also view images, on it, after copying them to a DVD or DVD-RAM disc.

Good luck!

Cordially,

It depends very much on the image. And on whether or not there are
significant line to line changes. If there are extended areas with
alternate lines are in different colours the interlace flicker can be
almost unbearable. The whole screen can appear to pulsate in an
incredibly annoying way with an unsuitable interlaced image. It tends
to be worse if the image being displayed is undersampled with very
sharp changes in adjacent pixels.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You assume more about the display than I do.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So what is it that *you* assume?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Remember, LCDs do not flicker at all.  AFAIK, the decay time is
&gt;&gt;&gt; infinite for all the practical purposes, so it would be not possible
&gt;&gt;&gt; to distinguish i vs p.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Puzzled,
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ilya

&gt;&gt; I am not assuming an LCD display.

&gt; If assuming LCD display implies better quality, why do not you assume
&gt; it?

&gt; Still puzzled,

Because the post to which I responded was talking about monitors and TV
sets.

Which are LCD too - unless you allow for some low-quality flavors...

Hello, Joe:

You can buy an HDMI-to-DVI cable or adapter, if you want to connect your
PC and TV together.

Not when they ran 60Hz interlaced VGA from 1987!
That's what Matt was talking about...

You are mistaken.  Mutt was trying to push some BS about 1080i being
bad for static images.  &quot;In fact, it IS noticeable...&quot;  VGA from 1987
was just a (misplaced) argument to support this BS.

But now I see what was the misunderstanding which lead to your posts.
Thanks,
Ilya

Thanks for the information.  I saw just such an adapter yesterday and
was wondering how well it would work. I suppose I would have to play
with the output resolution of my computer to get things looking right.

Hello, Joe:

Yes, to my knowledge, it does require some tinkering. Here's a
link to a helpful Web site, which covers these kinds of issues:

AV Science Forum &lt; http://www.avsforum.com &gt;

Incidentally, on two separate occasions, I bought an HDMI-to-DVI
adapter, at Wal-Mart (on clearance, each time, and too cheap to
resist); but, I've never used either one, as my Sanyo HT30744
(30&quot; CRT wide-screen HDTV) is on a different floor, from that of
my computers.

(The main PC's ATI &quot;All-In-Wonder Radeon 8500DV&quot; video card has a
DVI port, though.)

Good luck!

Cordially,
John Turco &lt;j ... @concentric.net&gt;

Thanks again. I did find that web site a while back and found it very
helpful in buying an HD TV, though you may to wade through a lot to find
out what you want to know.

[Although it has no relation to the discussion at hand,] I discovered
that this statement of mine may contain a factual error.  If I read
the Ref.1 of Wikipedia's &quot;HDTV Blur&quot; correctly, even white areas on
LCD display do flicker due to Pulse Code Modulation (used to get
semistransparency).

So I'm stuck:

a) If contemporary LCDs use PCM, what is the update frequency?  (Of
course, it should not carry a lot of relationship to the
frequency of input video signal, which is typically 60Hz...)

b) If contemporary LCDs use PCM, why is the response time an
important factor?  It looks like it would affect only the useful
levels of dark grays, not anything else...

c) I do not see how one would easily combine PCM with row/column addressing.

The only reasonable solution looks like LCDs of today do not use PCM,
so Ref.1 of Wikipedia's &quot;HDTV Blur&quot; is irrelevant.

People in the know, please clarify,
Thanks,
Ilya
