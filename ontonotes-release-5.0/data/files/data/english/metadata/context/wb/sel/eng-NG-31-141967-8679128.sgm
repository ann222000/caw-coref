Apparently westerns, too.

Anyone else get the feeling that he's just trying to provoke some
debate?

Or just being a dickhead.

I mean, this is a guy who's considering a &quot;Monopoly&quot; movie. And a
&quot;Gladiator&quot; sequel.

At least Deckard and Rachel were left *alive* at the end of BR - you
could kind of believe there's more of their story to be told. But a
&quot;Gladiator&quot; sequel? Please.

Anyway, films don't *have* to be about exploring the human condition and
the meaning of life. It's possible to make something entertaining
(including westerns and SF - look at &quot;Silverado&quot; and &quot;Serenity&quot;) without
needing to say something deep and meaningful.

Maybe he's getting cranky in his old age. Maybe no-one's offered him a
good script lately AND the money to film it.

I think it's just him. There's those that want to make films as an &quot;Artistic
Statement&quot; and think genre is something sterile that nothing can be done
with so if they should happen to make a genre movie it's not really genre
it's ... Others will make such things as entertainment / money makers / etc
and do something else if they want to be &quot;serious&quot; (are you listening Mr
Sp...).

I have to agree with you and Bernie; Scott's &quot;waiting for a good script&quot;
argument is *really* getting old. :-/

Surely if there's one genre that literally has limitless possibilities, it's
science fiction?

Or could it be that he is convinced he could never top Blade Runner, so he's
not going to try?

But it makes for a better movie if they're more than just CGI and loud
sound. Some friends suggested &quot;300&quot; and &quot;Memento&quot; to me. &quot;300&quot; just didn't
quite make it to &quot;nearly as good as 'Return of the Jedi'&quot; status.
&quot;Memento,&quot; OTOH, was an excellent movie. I guess it all depends on your
taste. What movie did you like better, &quot;Barton Fink&quot; or &quot;The Matrix?&quot; Both
are &quot;mess with your head&quot; movies, kind of like BR, but one is a &quot;small&quot;
movie and one is a CGI fest.

If a person *had* to pick one of either &quot;300&quot; or &quot;Memento&quot; as being more
like BR than the other, I'd say most people would pick &quot;Memento.&quot;

Am not! Anyway, I found Silverado entertaining.

SPOILERS

There was humour (John Cleese's role, and Kevin Kline getting shot
between between the legs of his underwear), drama (Danny Glover's father
dying), pathos (the settlers being robbed), and other elements - but it
didn't say anything to me about the human condition - it was just
entertaining. Of course, your tastes won't be the same as mine. What
westerns have entertained you?

&quot;The Searchers&quot; is a good western. Probably my favorite John Wayne western.
Of course with old westerns, one has to look past the Indian stereotyping.

Part of it is that I'm in the &quot;they made too many chages from the book
for no good reason&quot; crowd. But ...

Arwen is too powerful. First, by having her be the one Aragorn and the
Hobbits meet on the way to Rivendell. It's Glorfindel in the book. Bakshi
choose a better route to eliminate Glorfindel by susbstituting Legolas.
Second, by having Arwen be the one who raises the river against the
Nazgul, rather than Elrond. IMO, both of these were done to pander to
fans of hot babes doing action stuff.

The cave troll fight in Moria. How long did it last? Seemed like forever.
Catered to fans of high-energy CGI combat. Well-suited to a movie based
on &quot;Mortal Kombat,&quot; not &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;

Making Legolas a super-being. What was that for, to spur action figure
sales?

The battle at Helm's Deep. Legolas was the only Elf at Helm's Deep. The
participation of Gildor and his army was pure action movie stuff. &quot;Lord
of the Rings&quot; is not an action story.

Making Gimli the butt of so much humor. What was that for? I have no
idea.

Making Merry and Pippin the equivalent of C3PO and R2D2. What was that
for? I have no idea.

For me, the overall feel of the movies (and I only saw the extend-o-
versions on DVD) was a mixture of some Tolkien and more Hollywood stunt-
and CGI-action (yeah, I know the films were made in New Zealand).

It makes me shudder to think what BR would be like today if someone like
Peter Jackson, John McTiernan, the W-&lt;whatver&gt; brothers of &quot;Matrix&quot;
infamy or Robert Rodriguez remade it.

It sort of makes me think of a comment Scott makes during the commentary
for &quot;Legend.&quot; He's talking about how, to simulate Oona the sprite flying
around Jack's (Tom Cruise) head, they used a tiny light bulb on the end
of a filament, which was bobbed about by a crew member using a fishing
pole. Scott said the whole thing cost $50 (something like that). He also
added that if anyone were to do the same effect today, they'd do it with
CGI and it'd cost $250,000.

In the end, you're right, it's all a matter of personal taste. I'm not a
big fan of escapist movies. Not that I consider &quot;Legend&quot; a deep
commentary on the human condition, but I like it for many of the same
reasons as I like BR. It has an elegant, artistic look and sound, even if
the story is kind of lame. Both movies also lack the gratuitousness of
movies like &quot;The Matrix,&quot; &quot;Sin City&quot; and &quot;300.&quot; I know some consider the
scene of Deckard shooting Zhora gratuitously violent, for example, but I
think it conveys Zhora's toughness, and therefore the toughness of
Replicants in general, her determination to live and finally gives a
strong reason for Deckard's distate at having to do it (we don't need the
VO to tell us that).

&quot;They aren't.&quot; You're doing what in your next paragraph (snipped) you
accuse &quot;some folks&quot; of doing, namely, stating your opinion as if it were

to imply, you're basing your opinion on nothing. Now, maybe you've read
&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; 100 times, in which case this is merely a difference
of opinion.

The movies are a lot different from the books. Whether some of the
differences are necessary to turn 1000+ pages of book into 9+ hours of
movie is irrlevant. I list a litany of differences in another reply to
Lukas, but beyond those, the whole feel of the movies is different from
the feel of the books. If you're not a Tolkien-phile, you're not going to
notice that. Any blanket statement that the movies are not that different
from the movies cannot help but be wrong in that case.

&lt;snip&gt;

And I'm sure some Dick-philes get in a right tizz about BR vs. DADoES.
You'd probably get in a right tizz if someone adapted BR to an audio
drama and changed the whole feel of the story, or if some new director
re-made it a la &quot;The Matrix,&quot; full of slow motion shots of Leon and
Deckard duking it out in the 4th Sector, or Pris performing Trinity-like
flips as she zones in on Deckard. That's one reason the Westwood game is
such a good game from a BR fan standpoint. It kept the spirit and feel of
the movie, as much as it could given the limitations of the media. &quot;The
Lord of the Rings&quot; movies did not do the same. They went for cheap
thrills.

Although you've snipped the rest of the line which changes the whole meaning
of the sentence. The &quot;they aren't&quot; was really a bit of a poke in terms of my

giving my opinion, as having to qualify everything gets ridiculous, along
with the rest of the sentence. It's more the case that I tend to take issue
with those that paint it very clearly that they think their opinion = fact,
repeatedly and in detail, along with bludgeoning others with it).

I've read all the books twice, and was cogniscent enough of where the film
deviated from them. But my take on it is that changes were inevitable
because of the nature of the format, something that Peter Jackson also
pointed out. There's nothing there, in my opinion, to get upset about.
Better to be optimistic about it, that a great Director did as great a job
as possible (yep, still arguable) bearing in mind the limitations.

Conversely, it took the film and adapted to its format, and did a good job

... which is precisely what I think happened with Lord of the Rings. It had
to make a coherent trilogy of what were relatively long films, along with my
feeling that it did a great job of capturing the atmosphere.

As I emphasised in the snipped text again, it's all a matter of opinion (you
seem to be inferring that it isn't). I'd prefer people didn't get so het up
about these sorts of things and let them go, more for the people themselves
than anything, what with world stress, carbon footprints, and things (I'd
try to do the same thing if someone transferred the Stainless Steel Rat
books to the screen, and I felt they didn't &quot;get it&quot;).

I suspect that's flogging a dead horse on the topic.

I appreciate you taking the time to elaborate. I can certainly understand
your POV.

But movie adaptations from your average novel are usually different in a
number of ways. First of all, usually a lot has to be simplified, condensed
or cut altogether in order to keep it from being a 10-hour-or-more movie.

I can only imagine this proves even more necessary when dealing with a
complicated trilogy such as LOTR. The commentary tracks on the extended
edition DVD's gave probably only a hint of the number of decisions that had
to be made to adapt Tolkien's work into movies that were actually watchable
and understandable for a &quot;mainstream&quot; audience, which would include a lot of
people NOT previously familiar with Tolkien's books.

I guess it's unavoidable that along the way this resulted in changes, some
of which no doubt raised an eyebrow or two with people who know the books.
You listed many of them, so I'm not going to repeat. :-)

Concerning the comic relief introduced with Gimli and the Hobbits, this was
a deliberate attempt to lighten things up in this big epic story that takes
itself very serious otherwise. I think Jackson and the screenwriter(s)
actually commented on this on the commentary tracks.

Basically, don't look at the movie as the same thing as the book, look
at is as an additional alternate take on the universe. The book exists,
and as movies like Sin City and 300 show, a direct adaptation of a book,
with no changes whatsoever results in something fairly boring. As

Well, I don't think there'd be any point to remaking BR, but it's not

it's certainly tough, but we forget about all the awful movies churned

Indeedy, another great movie by Leone. It has been argues that this one was
a closing, a conclusion of the Wild West as it existed in the &quot;Dollar
trilogy&quot;.

In fact, an early idea for &quot;Once upon...&quot; had the Charles Bronson character
confront Eastwood and the other main characters from the previous movies at
the train station, and killing them off. Obviously that idea was abandoned,
and he confronted 3 &quot;generic&quot; baddies instead. But the theme of the dying of
the &quot;Old West&quot; did remain at the core of the film, personified by Bronson.

&gt; the whole run of the book. Certainly one of the weaknesses of
&gt; Tolkien's writing is the lack of strong women characters. That was
&gt; admittedly a product of the times, but why not update it a bit for
&gt; today?

Why not update Shakespeare, too? Politically correctifying stories is
like colorizing old movies.

&gt; Basically, don't look at the movie as the same thing as the book, look
&gt; at is as an additional alternate take on the universe. The book
&gt; exists, and as movies like Sin City and 300 show, a direct adaptation
&gt; of a book, with no changes whatsoever results in something fairly
&gt; boring. As someone who already read the Sin City comic, I got nothing
&gt; new from the movie. In this case, the appearance of those other elves
&gt; was one of the best moments in the film, and I think that emotional
&gt; peak was worth the change.
">

If you're one of those who can appreciate the movie as distinct from the
book, OK. That's the way I feel about David Lynch's &quot;Dune&quot; compared to
the book. I don't feel that way about &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; because the
changes, to me, smack of cheap marketeering.

There's a difference between making a movie based on a book and making a
film adaptation of a book. Clearly, BR is based on DADoES, and is not
merely a film adaptation of the book. It's a different story, the
characters are different, the noir-like atmosphere is different, the
paranoia of the book is missing.

&quot;Lord of the Rings,&quot; the movie, is not &quot;based on&quot; the book. It's a film
adaptation of the book, and it fails to capture the feel of the book in
many areas. BR is its own, independent of the book, and so cannot fail to
capture the feel of the book because it doesn't have to.

That's an opinion formed by how much or little you liked his movies.

There's indeed little point in discussing *opinions*; but then that's hard

I for one loved the LOTR movies (HC was ok, but didn't interest me all that

have received, makes him come very close to be safely called a &quot;talented
director&quot;. Maybe not a &quot;great director&quot;, maybe not just yet, but whatever

It was badly phrased, I admit, but the perspective part was key to what I

And there's this: &quot;Better to be optimistic about it, that a great Director
did as great a job as possible (yep, still arguable) bearing in mind the
limitations.&quot; That rather seems to be saying that Peter Jackson is,
unequivocally, a great director. You even felt the need to capitalize
&quot;Director,&quot; unless that was a typo. What appears most likely to be
&quot;arguable,&quot; in that sentence structure, is that he did as great a job as
possible, not that he's a great director. Furthermore,  your assertion that
he did as &quot;great&quot; a job as possible presupposes that he did some kind of
great job, and his great job was arguably the best great job.

Did you read the bit in brackets? (Rhetorical)

A typo.

Although what I meant was Jackson being a great director.

&gt; &gt; There's indeed little point in discussing *opinions*; but then that's
&gt; &gt; hard to avoid when talking about movies.

&gt; If we didn't discuss opinions, we would dsicuss hardly anything. If we
&gt; discussed only items that are not opinion, what would we say about BR?
&gt; That Deckard thinks Rachael plays the piano beautifully, that Tyrell
&gt; wears thick glasses, that Replicants are physically stronger than humans?
&gt; That Holden can breathe OK as long as nobody unplugs him? We'd run out of
&gt; topics pretty quickly without injecting opinion.

Usually we discuss opinion backed up with observations from the films.
Is Deck a replicant?  I say no, because he doesn't have superhuman
strength and agility and intelligence.  If Deck is the &quot;missing
replicant,&quot; then he'd have to be a lemon.

Just saying he's not a rep is a pretty boring conversation.

You and I could have a splendidly agreeable converstation.

Tagging Deckard as the missing &quot;sixth Replicant&quot; is to search for an
explantion in the fiction for a continuity error.

Hell yes! Maybe it was a labour of love, but the logistics of that
project were like nothing seen since maybe the days of Cleopatra and
Gone with the wind, and that was a different era, this is like asking
Barratt Houses to knock up a gothic cathedral.

So even if you don't care much for his direction in some way, he is a
master of the craft and that cannot be denied.

I still need to grab a copy of Frighters, now that the DVD has had a
proper edition.

Oh people, know that you have committed great sins.
If you ask me what proof I have for these words,
I say it is because I am the punishment of God.
If you had not committed great sins,
God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you.
