The &quot;birth&quot; was of an 18 week-old foetus, which was chemically aborted.
Mt wife went through the same procedure with her first pregnancy, when
the foetus was 23 weeks. At 18 weeks, the foetus is not regarded as a
&quot;baby&quot; and it is not given any of the treatment that a still-born late-
term foetus is accorded. It is not issued with a death certificate and
is not, therefore, eligible for a grave in a public cemetery. The story
is designed to create an emotional link by naming the foetus. Would you
rather that the hospital staff had spent their time treating this
unfortunate young woman, or that they instead spent it tending to those
with a genine need. Patently, despite her emotional trauma, this woman
had no medical need for their attention.

Nice try, peabrain, but another failure for Party Central. best go and
tell them you need some more material, mainly to pad your arse in
preparation for yet another &quot;whuppin'&quot;.

A reader's response to the above:

My condolences to you and your baby. The UK is now a third world
country or worse. It is full of foreign immigrants, all battling with
the indigenous population to get treatment, while many health care
workers, fed up with the NHS, are taking overseas jobs. The NHS is a
national disgrace, and should be scrapped altogether. Give us our
taxes back and we will all pay private insurance instead.

Still doing the mindless repetition of discredited bullshit thing, I
see, peabrain. Why don't you go and steal a few more pictures from the
internet and claim they're your own work? You know you want to.

While you're looking, get on down to Pety HQ and ask them what the laws
are in the US regarding late-term aborted foetuses, with special
reference to the foetal age at which the birth is recognised as having
produced a child. Ask them what the hospital policies are in the US
regarding late-term aborted foetuses that are under that age. You could
also drop in on the hags at the NFRW while you're there and ask them how
many have had a mid-term miscarriage and of those, how many had it occur
at home, with no medical treatment whatever, except post-event.

You don't half speak shit, peabrain.&gt;

Third baby dies after error at Indiana hospital

Heather Jeffers, center, is consoled by her mother
Joanna Pruitt, right, and her sister Jamie outside her home in Indianapolis.
Jeffers' daughter, Dawn, is one of three premature infants that died at
Methodist Hospital last week.

By Theodore Kim and Tammy Webber, USA TODAY
INDIANAPOLIS - A third premature baby has died in a case of medical
error here that has shaken one of Indiana's largest hospitals.
Five-day-old Thursday Dawn Jeffers died late Tuesday, said Jon Mills,
a spokesman for Methodist Hospital.

The Jeffers infant was one of six premature babies who received
overdoses of the anti-clotting drug heparin Saturday in Methodist's neonatal
intensive care unit.

Thursday Dawn was being treated at Riley Hospital for Children, where
she had been transferred after being born at Methodist.

No question that he's a complete waste of time, but it's also
true that he's being supplied with enough of this cr*p to constitute a
kind of water-drop torture for those of us in the reality-based
community.
I do wonder how long he'll last - the people running him seem to
be trying to turn him into the Energizer Bunny of disinfo.  And he
keeps thumping along, mindlessly obedient and blithely unaware of any
moral implication of what he's trying to do
On the bright side I expect my fellow citizens and I will become
practiced at countering this kind of mindless drivel, thanks to

&quot;If&quot; it was chemically aborted (not sure what that means) doesn't that mean
someone had to perform the procedure, or are you saying that it was done by
the woman who was pregnanat?

Basically, a chemical abortion is an induced delivery. Because the
foetus is undeveloped, there are far fewer risks, so I can understand
the staff administering the injection and letting her do her thing.

'Queen's Hospital was opened at the end of last year, taking over maternity
services from Oldchurch Hospital in Romford. '

I digress, but my young daughter had an orthopedic op at Oldchurch hospital.
She was booted out the same day with nothing to help her stand up and I had
to beg for crutches which the staff had difficulty finding.  The hospital
was dirty, hot and overcrowded as well.  She was stuck in a chair, still
wavering after the anaesthesia while the nurse wiped down the bed for the
next patient.  She was supposed to have had the other foot operated on but
never returned...

Well, it's generally accepted that it takes two to tango, Jerry...

In terms of the medical procedure, there was no &quot;problem&quot;. She was
administered a routine drug which has known effects and then she was
left alone to do what she had to do. When it occurred in outr situation,
the staff were very careful not to intrude, as there is a lot of grief
involved and personally, I was grateful for that approach. Our baby was
a little older than the one in question, but still under the 24 week cut
off point at which a foetus is recognised as potentially independently

in the local public cemetery. Otherwise, the foetus would be treated
like any other medical waste.

BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH!!!!!

Queen's Hospital is a privatised hospital, built under PFI - a scam

instead of into healthcare.

So this &quot;BAD Healthcare story&quot; is PROOF that PRIVATISED MEDICINE is a
dangerous swindle.
