State Sponsors of Jihadism: Learning the Hard Way*By Kamran Bokhari*

In the short period of time since some Muslim states began to employ
jihadists to further their domestic and foreign policy objectives -- in the
late 1970s and early 1980s -- none of these states has been able to quit the
relationship and remain unscathed. For various reasons, the once-symbiotic
relationships between the governments of Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and
their jihadist proxies have turned adversarial, while in Syria's case the
storm is brewing. In essence, the jihadists have come back to bite the hand
that fed them.

An examination of the development of these relationships reveals a similar
path. The security and intelligence apparatuses in each of these countries
played the lead role in supporting these militant Islamist entities -- in
some cases even helping to create them. Over time, these intelligence
agencies developed a considerable degree of influence among such groups,
though the groups enjoyed significant influence within the security
establishment as well.

For domestic reasons, most of these governments aligned themselves with
religious extremist forces to consolidate their power and counter challenges
from mainstream opposition forces. But more important, the alignment served
to further the geopolitical objectives of the state in its region. In the
beginning, such relationships tended to go well -- until the state ceased to
have a major use for the jihadist group or the group became too powerful to
manage.

Normally, despite the ups and downs in the relationship between a country
and its allied terrorist entity, the state maintains the upper hand. This is
because, although their ideology and interests differ from those of the
state, the jihadist groups depend on the state for their survival and
prosperity.

*The Afghanistan Legacy*

Such equilibrium, however, exists as long as the affair remains limited to a
one-on-one relationship between the state and its proxy, or only one or two
neighboring states get involved. Over time, however, the explosive cocktail
of religion and geopolitics has allowed Islamist militant nonstate actors to
seek help from other like-minded groups outside their areas of operation,
which has helped them consolidate their positions at home.

It all began with the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan in 1979,
when the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia supported Islamist rebels
fighting the Moscow-backed Marxist stratocracy in Kabul.

For its part, Washington provided weapons and training to the insurgents it
called &quot;freedom fighters,&quot; while Riyadh funneled money to them and Islamabad
provided logistical assistance. Moreover, these countries made a concerted
effort to unite a broad range of Islamist groups. In the process, these
groups -- which until then had limited horizons -- got their first real
taste of transnationalism. Not only did the decade-long Afghan experience
connect the groups, it also laid the foundation for a transnational network
-- one that later emerged as a global jihadist network, with al Qaeda as its
vanguard.

Although by empowering the jihadists the Afghan venture altered the nature
of the relationship between Muslim states and their nonstate proxies, many
states continued to do business with their proxies. Even
U.S.-ledinternational pressure on countries -- mostly Muslim ones --
to abandon
their sponsorship of terrorist entities was not serious enough to force the
states to shut down these operations.

The Saudis continued to bankroll Arab legions fighting in Central Asia,
South Asia, the Far East, the Caucasus and the Balkans. Pakistan continued
to back the Afghan and Pakistani militant Islamist groups, with an eye on
securing the now-infamous objective of &quot;strategic depth&quot; in Afghanistan.
Islamabad also aimed to counter Indian military superiority by backing
Kashmiri separatist groups. Yemen sought the help of jihadist forces to
defeat Marxists in the 1994 civil war.

Meanwhile, the 1991 Persian Gulf War played a key role in creating friction
between many of these states and their jihadist proxies. The falling out
between Osama bin Laden and the Saudi royal family is a classic case.
Jihadist groups by then had gained sufficient strength to begin asserting
their autonomy, especially in areas where their ideologies and objectives
clashed with those of their state patrons.

The evolving relationship between Islamist groups and Muslim states also had
a direct impact on the domestic sociopolitical conditions in the concerned
countries, which led to the rise of religious conservatives, radical
Islamists and other extremist forces. A situation developed in which the
very religious ideology the ruling elites had used to consolidate their hold
on power was beginning to undercut the state. Because the Islamist militants
did not completely turn against the state, however, the situation remained
tenable.

*The Watershed*

Then came 9/11.

The attacks against the United States completely altered the global
geopolitical landscape and forced governments in Islamabad, Riyadh, Sanaa
and elsewhere to act against their jihadist allies. In the beginning, these
Muslim governments tried to make do by simply convincing the Islamist groups
to lie low. Some complied, though many others did not -- because by then
they had established autonomous operating environments and, more important,
they had been emboldened by al Qaeda's 9/11 attacks.

The state patrons, then, were finding that many of their former proxies were
going rogue, and that a realignment of the jihadist universe was taking
place. Whereas many jihadist groups and factions in the past had &quot;special&quot;
relationships with the state, they now found an ally in al Qaeda and its
band of transnational jihadists. This pursuit of transnational objectives
brought the jihadists in direct confrontation with states whose past
relationships with the jihadists were motivated by national interest. The
jihadists, in other words, represented no more than instruments through
which governments could pursue their goals. Over time, especially during the
period following the invasion of Iraq by the United States and its allies,
these Muslim governments increased the pressure on the jihadists.

That said, the break between the jihadists and their patron governments was
neither quick nor absolute, which explains why it took some time before the
jihadists redirected their actions against the states that were responsible
for their initial rise. Despite their growing distaste for their former
patrons, the jihadists still needed to maintain operational links with their
contacts inside the states' security and intelligence networks.

In many cases, intelligence operatives and security officers who had managed
the jihadist groups sympathized with the newly shunned nonstate actors,
giving the jihadists significant access to resources that helped them
continue to operate -- even under the global counterjihadist regime being
imposed by the United States. Although some of these officials were purged
and others were transferred, still others managed to balance their official
duties with their sympathies to the jihadists. The Pakistani intelligence
directorates, particularly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), continues
to be plagued by this problem, which would explain the jihadists ease in
staging attacks against Pakistani security forces since the Musharraf
government began operations against Islamist militant interests in the
country's northwest.

Even though the official policy in these states now is based on the
conviction that Islamist extremists and terrorists represent a grave
national security threat -- and the governments are mobilizing resources to
counter the threat -- to varying degrees, the jihadists have sufficiently
penetrated the state systems to the point that they still can conduct
business.

The fatal mistake governments make is that they try to distinguish between
&quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; jihadists. For the Pakistanis, the Taliban in Afghanistan
constitute a resistance movement, though they want the Taliban operating in
Pakistan wiped out. Similarly, the Yemenis hunt down some al Qaeda-linked
jihadists, but not those who form a crucial support base for the government
of President Ali Abdallah Saleh or those who make up an integral part of
Yemen's intelligence services. In the same way, the Saudis have undertaken a
massive counterjihadist effort in the kingdom, though they still support
jihadists in Iraq as a means of containing the rise of the Shia there --
and, by extension, Iran.

However, maintaining an ambivalent policy toward jihadism, while tempting,
can be deadly. From a policy point of view, it is easy to box jihadists into
the neat categories of good and bad. In reality, however, the jihadist goal
is to overthrow secular governments and establish Islamist states, which is
why these states cannot hope to do business with jihadists and expect to
maintain internal security and stability. Of course, different governments
faced with varying domestic and foreign policy circumstances will have
different levels of success.

*The Unique Situations*

Despite having the social, political and economic environment that is most
conducive to jihadist activity, Saudi Arabia has been the most successful in
combating jihadism. In an effort to undercut the Islamist militants, the
kingdom's General Intelligence Directorate has skillfully made use of the
same religious, tribal and financial channels that the jihadists use to
stage attacks. It is not surprising, then, that the Saudis have been ahead
of the curve since June 2004 and have managed to thwart attacks and launch
successful pre-emptive strikes against jihadist personnel and
infrastructure.
Since the beginning of the jihadist insurgency in the country, Riyadh's
security forces have eliminated some half-dozen successive commanders of the
kingdom's al Qaeda node. Much of the Saudi success can be attributed to the
government's handle on the various cross sections of society. Moreover, the
Saudis have had sufficient experience in dealing with rogue Islamist
militants.

The kingdom's founder, King Abdel-Aziz bin Abdel-Rehman, successfully
quashed the Ikhwan movement (not to be confused with the Muslim Brotherhood)
when it began to threaten the interests of the state. The militant Wahhabi
movement played a major role in King Abdel-Aziz's attempts to conquer most
of modern-day Saudi Arabia in the early 1900s. But when the group wanted to
expand its operations into Iraq (then under British control) -- a move that
threatened the interest of the king's British allies -- and when it wanted
to impose its own brand of Islamic law in the kingdom, King Abdel-Aziz had
its members annihilated. Many decades later, in 1979, when the Kaba in Mecca
was taken over by a militant Wahhabi group led by Juhayman al-Utaibi, the
Saudis were again able to act against the group, even storming the Kaba to
flush out the militants.

The situation in Yemen is not that bad either. Like Saudi Arabia, attacks
still continue -- most recently against energy-related targets -- but what
has helped the Yemenis is that a significant population in the country is
Zaydi, an offshoot of the Shiite sect of Islam. Additionally, the Yemeni
government is not supporting jihadists for foreign policy purposes, but to
ensure domestic political stability. Thus, the jihadists do not engage in
active combat. Nevertheless, the country sits on the crossroad of four major
jihadist theaters -- Iraq, Afghanistan/Pakistan, Somalia and Saudi Arabia --
and the transnational elements from each arena could link up with the locals
to create problems for Sanaa in the future.

By far, the most serious threat is that faced by Pakistan. There, the
historic mullah-military alliance has fallen apart in recent months. In
fact, in the wake of the operation against Islamabad's Red Mosque, the
jihadists have taken off the gloves and declared war against the Pakistani
state. While successive governments dating back to the country's creation in
1947 have used religious groups and the ulema class to standardize
Pakistan's nationalism as one rooted in Islam, the 11-year rule (1977-88) of
former military dictator President Gen. Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq played a crucial
role in creating the Islamist Frankenstein. Though many governments before
and after Zia flirted with Islamist actors to pursue foreign policy
objectives, it was the Zia regime that empowered Islamists and mullahs at
home.

In many ways, the current polarization of Pakistani society is the logical
culmination of two competing views of the Pakistani state. Throughout their
country's nearly 60-year history as a nation-state, Pakistanis have
struggled over whether Pakistan was created to be an &quot;Islamic&quot; polity in
which its majority Muslim population could live in accordance with its
cultural norms as codified by state law, or whether its founders envisioned
Pakistan as a secular state in which the Muslims of British India could
safeguard their economic interests.

This situation continues to force the state's hand, and the government is
attempting to gain control over the jihadists who are striking at the very
security forces that nurtured them in the past. Therefore, given the
magnitude of the problem, it is not surprising to see that many Pakistanis
are beginning to wonder about the future survivability of their country.
Pakistan is unlikely to become a failed state as a result of the social
chaos and the weakening of the military-dominated establishment, but the
country is headed for serious trouble. However, it is too soon to say
whether Pakistan will face a situation like Algeria did in the 1990s, when
some 200,000 people died before the government could contain the Islamist
insurgency there, or whether it will encounter a more benign insurgency,
like that in Egypt in the 1980s and 1990s.

Another state that has recently begun using jihadist elements to pursue its
foreign policy objectives is Syria. The government not only has allowed
jihadists to use Syrian territory as a conduit to Iraq, but also has in
recent months redirected some of that traffic toward Lebanon in a bid to
regain control of its smaller neighbor -- control it lost in the storm that
erupted after the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri.

Syria in the 1970s became the first Arab state to face a serious challenge
from homegrown jihadists, which is why former President Hafez al Assad
decided to strike hard at Islamist forces in 1982 -- an act that led to the
killing of tens of thousands of people. The senior al Assad was motivated by
the fact that his Alawite-Baathist regime was a minority government in a
country where 85 percent of the population was Sunni. His son, President
Bashar al Assad, however, is ignoring that statistic and is participating in
a dangerous game of backing jihadists in Iraq and Lebanon. It will not be
long before these same forces begin to threaten domestic security and
stability in Syria, especially with Iraq exploding.

States that have exploited jihadists to further their own interests have
derived some short-term benefits, but in the long run, these groups have
come back to haunt their former sponsors -- in some cases even threatening
the security and stability of the state. In either creating or supporting
these groups, the states tend to forget that their proxies will have their
own agendas. Given their ideology and transnational links, jihadists groups
have proven to be the most deadly proxies. *Contact Us*
