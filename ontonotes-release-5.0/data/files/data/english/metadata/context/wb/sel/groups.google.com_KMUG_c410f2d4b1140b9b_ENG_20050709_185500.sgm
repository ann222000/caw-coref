An idea for an MC5 logo and a &quot;Minolta Lens Cap Cap&quot; - MC5
(Minolta Convention 2005 NYC) Memorabilia?

Hi MC5 gang,

I was thinking about memorabilia for the upcoming Minolta
Manual Convention, NYC, 2005 (MC5?!?), and I came up with a
logo idea ... and a use for it - a &quot;Minolta Lens Cap Cap&quot;.

I think it's a neat idea, can be bought by anyone, even
those not able to attend, it can outlast the one event, and it
can work as a photographer and viewfinder shade and also as a
lens shade on demand.

I scanned one of my Minolta 55mm lens caps, cut and pasted
additional lettering for &quot;n_c&quot; and &quot;_00_&quot;, and hand copied
some additional lettering styles for &quot;_y_&quot; and &quot;2__5&quot; from the
contents of my 1950's Minolta •A• &quot;Instructions for Using&quot;
manual to try to keep it all looking authentic for the vintage
Minolta Manual feel, and I also thought it might be nice to
keep it subtle, not too flashy, and so it may be longer
lasting than just for one event - all purpose?

&quot;Minolta Lens Cap Cap&quot;

It's from &lt;&gt; - ~$14US
- I have no idea what the profits would be if any (to many
layers of menus at CafePress), but up until the paying off of
any support bills for the convention, I'm happy to donate
whatever profit ensues.

Whadythink?

=8^o

I guess we could also order logo's T-shirts, too? But, I
like zipper front hooded jerseys with pockets, and I imagine
everyone else likes their own styles, too. I guess we can
slap the logo, or any logo anyone else designs, or even
multiple logos, onto whatever styles of shirts and jerseys and
mugs and so on, eh? Hmmm ... a &quot;MUG Minolta User's Group MUG&quot;
- hahahah! Anyway, I settled on the &quot;shade your eyes, your
viewfinder, and your lens&quot; baseball hat as it seemed to me to
be the most usable by anyone anytime.

I'm also working on Minolta's ancient logo copy of the old
Leica logo of a lens element and viewfinder (?) superimposed
with the company name. Minolta used either &quot;ChiyoKo&quot; (again,
from my 1950's Minolta •A• &quot;Instructions for Using&quot; manual -
which ws the first &quot;official&quot; Minolta camera built for export
by &quot;Chiyoda Kogaku Seiko K. K. Osaka Japan&quot;, I think) or just
with the &quot;Minolta&quot; name in the center as they used in logos
for a while in later years (I'm not finished stylizing the &quot;2&quot;
and &quot;5&quot; yet), but this is a w-a-y more obscure reference -
here's a draft copy:

Though, come to think of it, THIS might look s-w-e-e-t
on a thong! ;-) Any volunteers to model one?!? YIPES!!!

Also, of course, does anyone else have any other ideas for
memorabilia and possible support for financing and expenses?

PS - Here's the logo:

Antony, it's 400x pixels square 100% JPG grayscale and you can
use it as the group logo if you want! I'll put it in the
[Files] section of the group at
&lt;&gt; ... I
also have in in PNG format which is cleaner than JPG, if
anyone cares.
