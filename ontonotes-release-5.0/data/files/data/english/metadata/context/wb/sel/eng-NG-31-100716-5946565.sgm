The following post (text below) to
http://z3.invisionfree.com/911debate/index.php?showtopic=119&amp;st=30 dated
1/21/07 raises the issue of witnesses reporting an explosion in the basement
of one of the WTC towers BEFORE the first plane hit:
----------------
1) Name 1 instance of multiple, independant testimony of bombs going off in
an important and populous location, leading to injury and hospitalistion of
civilians, that has not only elicted zero investigation by authorities, but
has been actively whitewashed from public record by the government and the
mainstream media. ***NOTE*** I am NOT talking about the 9/11 Oral Histories,
damning tho that sordid saga is in itself, but the testimony of the
janitorial staff such as Rodriguez (plus David, Sanchez, Giambanco,
Pecoraro, and others) that there was a bomb taht went off in the basment
BEFORE the 1st plane hit. Note that there is video footage of David in
hospital, with severe burns on his face and body, talking about the bomb.
Give me one example, and then when you don't, tell me why you know more than
these people do.

2. Find me one independant opinion that WTC7 was not imploded [brought down
with demolition explosives]. I will give you several: Jowenko, Bachmann,
Schneider, as well as the engineers in the Scholars for 9/11 Truth, plus
articles contributed at www.journalof911studies.com .

--------------------------------
9/11 was an INSIDE JOB!

Patriotic Americans must demand that the new Democratic Congress open a new
and independent investigation.

9/11 - the IRREFUTABLE FACTS and the EVIDENCE backing them up:

WTC building 7 collapsed in a deliberate demolition by explosives just hours
after the collapse of the twin towers. There is no other credible
explanation for its collapse. The planes that struck the towers did not
structurally damage building 7, and debris did only minor damage to it. No
steel frame building has EVER collapsed from even a serious fire; the fires
in building 7 were not extensive, and were only on a few of the lower
floors. These probably were arson fires, as falling debris from the towers
would have only ignited the roof and upper floors. Deliberate, pre-planned
explosive demolition is the ONLY explanation for the sudden, complete, and
near free-fall speed collapse of building 7. This is the weakest link in the
official coverup - and the 9/11 Commission whitewash IGNORES building 7
entirely!

See documentation at http://www.wtc7.net/
and http://www.prisonplanet.com/012004watson.html

Explosive demolitions take considerable time to set up (see
http://science.howstuffworks.com/building-implosion1.htm ).
The explosives could not possibly have been properly placed around all
thestructural supports and set up for detonation in building 7 in the few
hours between the attacks and that building's collapse. Yet that collapse
was clearly a professionally executed demolition by explosives.

Therefore -
THE DEMOLITION EXPLOSIVES IN BUILDING 7 WERE PUT IN
PLACE PRIOR TO THE PLANES IMPACTING THE TWIN TOWERS!

Therefore -
The 9/11 attacks were KNOWN OF IN ADVANCE, and DELIBERATELY
ALLOWED TO OCCUR! It was intended beforehand that building 7 and the twin
towers all be completely destroyed, KILLING THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
REMAINING IN THEM! Is this anything less than mass murder, the crime of the
century aided and abetted if not perpetrated by HOMELAND terrorist traitors
to America?

The above facts, further documented below, do not alone rigorously prove
that previously placed explosives likewise brought down the twin towers, but
see the following:

A paper published by Steven E. Jones, Professor of Physics, Brigham Young
University, concludes that prepositioned demolition explosives brought down
all three collapsed WTC buildings, not the plane impacts or fires.

Consider these facts:

1. Pulverization of all three buildings:
As we all saw, all three buildings collapsed to DUST, with unusually little
solid debris remaining. It is clear that a 500,000 ton concrete and steel
building cannot be turned to a huge cloud of dust in less than 15 seconds by
a simple structural collapse, nor indeed by anything other than explosives.

2. Thermate residue in the metal:
Professor Jones of Brigham Young University has tested the metal taken from
the site, and a paper on his findings is available
( http://www.journalof911studies.com/ or video at
http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-2842384983834100001&amp;q=step...
http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=...=stephen+jones

The debris has tested positive for products of a THERMATE REACTION. Thermate
is an incediary substance used to very quickly slice through thick steel. It
is used together with high explosives in controlled demolitions.
http://youtube.com/watch?v=WrCWLpRc1yM
Professor Jones's findings have been scrutinized since June 2006 and are
scientifically undisputed. They prove on their own that this was an inside
job, as thermate could not have been present through any other
circumstances.

3. Free fall collapses:
The towers fell, according to the 9/11 Commission, at 9-10 seconds, and 7
for WTC7. This equates to almost free fall speed. The only way an object can
free fall is if it encounters no more resistance in its fall than air. This
cannot happen in a structural collapse, as the floors would pancake on top
of one another, resulting in about 90 major points of inertial resistance to
the fall. Free fall can only happen in a controlled demolition where all the
supports are blown out at once or close to it, and the structures below the
falling matter can offer little or no resistance.
Check out Dutch controlled demolition expert Danny Jowenko's statement on
this:
http://www.911blogger.com/node/3231 ] http://www.911blogger.com/node/3231

4. Eyewitness reports:
Shortly after 9/11, the FDNY recorded over 500 oral histories in which
firefighters and emergency medical workers recounted their experiences of
that day. Mayor Bloomberg's administration, however, has refused to release
them. But the New York Times, joined by several families of 9/11 victims,
filed suit and, after a long process, the New York Court of Appeals ordered
the city to release the bulk of these oral histories, which it did in August
2005. The Times then made them publicly available
http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAP...

These oral histories contain many dozens of testimonies that speak of
explosions and related phenomena characteristic of controlled demolition.

Some examples:

Several individuals reported that they witnessed an explosion just before
one of the towers collapsed. Battalion Chief John Sudnik said: "we heard . .
. what sounded like a loud explosion and looked up and I saw tower two start
coming down" (NYT, Sudnick, p. 4).

Several people reported multiple explosions. Paramedic Kevin Darnowski said:
"I heard three explosions, and then . . . tower two started to come down"
(NYT, Darnowski, p. 8).

Firefighter Thomas Turilli said, "it almost sounded like bombs going off,
like boom, boom, boom, like seven or eight" (NYT, Turilli, p. 4). Craig
Carlsen said that he and other firefighters "heard explosions coming from .
. . the south tower. . . . There were about ten explosions. . . . We then
realized the building started to come down" (NYT, Carlsen, pp. 5-6).

Firefighter Joseph Meola said, "it looked like the building was blowing out
on all four sides. We actually heard the pops" (NYT, Meola, p. 5).

Paramedic Daniel Rivera also mentioned "pops." Asked how he knew that the
south tower was coming down, he said: "It was a frigging noise. At first I
thought it was---do you ever see professional demolition where they set the
charges on certain floors and then you hear 'Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop'? . . .
I thought it was that." (NYT, Rivera, p. 9)

Timothy Burke said that "the building popped, lower than the fire. . . . I
was going oh, my god, there is a secondary device because the way the
building popped. I thought it was an explosion" (NYT, Burke, pp. 8-9).

Firefighter Edward Cachia said: "It actually gave at a lower floor, not the
floor where the plane hit. . . . [W]e originally had thought there was like
an internal detonation, explosives, because it went in succession, boom,
boom, boom, boom, and then the tower came down" (NYT, Cachia, p. 5).

Some of the witnesses spoke of flashes and of phenomena suggestive of
demolition rings:

Assistant Commissioner Stephen Gregory said: "I thought . . . before . . .
No. 2 came down, that I saw low-level flashes. . . . I . . . saw a flash
flash flash . . . [at] the lower level of the building. You know like when
they demolish a building?" (NYT, Gregory, pp. 14-16).

Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Oregon.

MORE EVIDENCE OF THERMATE-EXPLOSIVE DEMOLITION:

There were severalthousand pounds of still red-hot molten iron found under
the three collapsed WTC buildings six weeks after the cleanup began. When
metal is heated to over 3500 degrees F in a matter of seconds, and a piece
falls away, it is effectively cut just as with an oxy-acetylene torch. This
is how thermate is used to cut through steel from a safe distance.
Demolition crews use it in conjunction with C-4 explosive "kicker" charges.
Initiate the thermite by remote control, wait 12 seconds or so, then
detonate the C-4 to "kick" the column or post away from its severed support.

History can be rewritten, but the laws of physics cannot. Jet fuel can only
reach about 1100 degrees F, nowhere near the temperature required to create
a pool of molten iron slag. That only happens at thermate reaction
temperatures. Thermate is a simple substance, made mostly of aluminum and
iron oxide.

You ever read Larry Niven's "Inferno"? There's a sequence where a
person in Hell has to pump a bicycle to keep a factory from pumping
pollution. It comes out that he worked against an actual "clean"
nuclear power plant because he was the head of the protesting
organization and if he stopped because his protest was no longer valid,
he wouldn't have any visibility at all!

It's similar, if you stop and think about it.

Excellent post.  When you have eyewitness' testimony describing the
explosion sounds as if coming from bombs going off, one after another,
and counting ten explosions, and describing the event as if it were a
professional demolition, pop, pop,pop, that could raise questions in
some peoples' minds about the presence of explosives in the WTC.  Just
a thought.

&lt; snip of trollbabble &gt;

HOW TO DEFEAT THE TROLL

An Internet "troll" is a person who delights in sowing discord
on the Internet. He or she slanders others and seeks to cause
conflicts and upset people. Trolls are malicious, antisocial,
and often mentally ill. They crave attention, and care not
whether it is positive or negative. The Internet is a
convenient venue for their bizarre, misanthropic games - a
means to abuse others without fear of retaliation. Trolls are
cowards - lacking the courage to be overtly hostile towards
people, they hide behind their computers and the anonymity of
the Internet. The troll is a less intelligent version of the
malicious hacker or virus writer.

Trolls are impervious to meaningful dialogue. You CANNOT reason
with them and you CANNOT cause them to feel shame or
compassion. Trolls do not feel bound by rules of courtesy or
social responsibility. They are simply not playing with a full
deck. It is futile to try to "cure" a troll of his obsession.
Trolls are irrational and not accessible through any sane approach.

Established posters may leave a newsgroup/message board because
of troll-created conflicts, and lurkers (readers that do not
post) may not want to expose themselves to abuse and therefore
never speak up. Thus they unwisely allow the troll to violate
their rights of free speech and expression. The Internet is a
vital resource - and probably the last stand for free speech.
Being antisocial, trolls hate this and try to subvert it.

When you try to reason with a troll, he wins. When you curse at
a troll, he wins. If he succeeds in angering you, he's succeeded. THE ONLY
THING THE TROLL CAN'T HANDLE IS BEING IGNORED -
having NO EFFECT on his intended targets!

So the best way to deal with trolls is to IGNORE THEM and
occasionally (and ONLY occasionally) remind others not to
respond to them either.

Hard to ignore? You can set up your computer to AUTOMATICALLY
ignore the troll by using your KILLFILE. Just go to the
offensive message, and bring your pointer to the "MESSAGE" tab
near the top of your screen. Click, and a menu opens. Go to and
click on "BLOCK SENDER." You will no longer see any of the
sender's posts from that account. This is called "plonking" the troll.

One spiteful technique used by trolls is to pretend to be a
well-liked person. On most systems there is nothing to prevent
header forgery - somebody using your name for an offensive
message. If you react with anger, the troll wins. So if a troll
impersonates you, simply post a reply titled "That Wasn't Me"
and type only this:  "I did not write that message; it is a
forgery." Most people will know it is not yours anyway due to
its uncharacteristic contents.

IT PAYS TO REPORT NET ABUSE. Many Internet service providers
take a dim view of spamming, message flooding, and forgeries.
Complaints can cause the troll to lose the account from which
his offensive post or posts was made.  To do this, you just
right-click on the offending message, and go to the PROPERTIES
tab. Under "DETAILS" you will find a list of the FULL HEADERS
that identify the message, its route, and its sender. Highlight
and copy ALL of this text. Address an email to the address
given on the header line "X-Complaints-To:". Now paste the
copied full headers into this email. Then copy the full text of
the offensive message, paste this into the email below the full
headers, and send it. The more people that complain, the more
likely it is that the troll's account will be cancelled.

When trolls are ignored they often step up their attacks,
desperately seeking the attention they crave. Their messages
become more numerous and more offensive. The combination of
IGNORING THEM and FILING COMPLAINTS is the ONLY
way to combat them.

The only effective method to defeat these deranged individuals
is to:

1) REPORT THEIR ABUSE.
2) IGNORE them.
3) KILLFILE them.

You would have to ask them, but I surmise that they remember the explosion
in the basement occurring before the plane impact, which they couldn't
possibly have not noticed. At the speed of sound and vibration in solid

Research it yourself, and make your own decisions.

Based on our past discussions, I can only conclude that you do not want to
consider the probable truth that 9/11 was an inside job. I really don't want
to debate it any further with you. If believing as you do makes you feel
better, fine. I know that I would feel alot better if I believed that no one
in America's government was capable of such a despicable crime against
humanity. I never allowed lies and attempted brainwashing - whether by
religion, the media, teachers, etc. to stultify my independence of mind, and
I never will, even if I could be much happier by believing in the Easter

Given the testimony by trained firefighters that follows below, how can
anyone in their right mind, or without something to hide, deny that more
than sufficient reason exists to open a new, independent investigation into
9/11?

&gt; Excellent post.  When you have eyewitness' testimony describing the
&gt; explosion sounds as if coming from bombs going off, one after another,
&gt; and counting ten explosions, and describing the event as if it were a
&gt; professional demolition, pop, pop,pop, that could raise questions in
&gt; some peoples' minds about the presence of explosives in the WTC.  Just
&gt; a thought.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Firefighter Thomas Turilli said, &quot;it almost sounded like bombs going

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;like boom, boom, boom, like seven or eight&quot; (NYT, Turilli, p. 4). Craig
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Carlsen said that he and other firefighters &quot;heard explosions coming
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;from .
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;. . the south tower. . . . There were about ten explosions. . . . We
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;then
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;realized the building started to come down&quot; (NYT, Carlsen, pp. 5-6).

&gt;&gt; &gt; What was editted out there?

&gt;&gt; Not only was much edited out, sentences were outright changed.
&gt;&gt; The full quotes are:

&gt;&gt; (NYT, Turilli, pp. 4-5)
&gt;&gt; &quot;The door closed, they went up, and it just seemed a couple seconds and
&gt;&gt; all of a sudden you just heard like it almost actually that day sounded
&gt;&gt; like bombs going off, like boom, boom, boom, like seven or eight, and
&gt;&gt; then just a huge wind gust just came and my officer just actually took
&gt;&gt; all of us and just threw us down on the ground and kind of just jumped
&gt;&gt; on top of us, laid on top of us. There were rocks falling and all that.
&gt;&gt; The lights were still on at that point and all of a sudden the lights
&gt;&gt; went out and you couldn't see anything.&quot;
&gt;&gt; http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPH...

&gt;&gt; (NYT, Carlsen, p. 6)
&gt;&gt; I guess about three minutes later you just heard explosions coming from
&gt;&gt; building two, the south tower. It seemed like it took forever, but there
&gt;&gt; were about ten explosions. At the time I didn't realize what it was. We
&gt;&gt; realized later after talking and finding out that it was the floors
&gt;&gt; collapsing to where the plane had hit.
&gt;&gt; We then realized the building started to come down.&quot;
&gt;&gt; http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPH...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Firefighter Joseph Meola said, &quot;it looked like the building was blowing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;out
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;on all four sides. We actually heard the pops&quot; (NYT, Meola, p. 5).

&gt;&gt; &quot;As we are looking up at the building, what I saw was, it looked like
&gt;&gt; the building was blowing out on all four sides. We actually heard the
&gt;&gt; pops. Didn't realize it was the falling -- you know, you heard the
&gt;&gt; pops of the building. You thought it was just blowing out.
&gt;&gt; http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPH...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Paramedic Daniel Rivera also mentioned &quot;pops.&quot; Asked how he knew that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;south tower was coming down, he said: &quot;It was a frigging noise. At
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;first I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;thought it was---do you ever see professional demolition where they set
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;charges on certain floors and then you hear 'Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop'?
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;. . .
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I thought it was that.&quot; (NYT, Rivera, p. 9)

&gt;&gt; &quot;Then that's when -- I kept on walking close to the south tower, and
&gt;&gt; that's when that building collapsed.
&gt;&gt; Q. How did you know it was coming down?
&gt;&gt; A. That noise. It was a noise.
&gt;&gt; Q. What did you hear? What did you see?
&gt;&gt; A. It was a frigging noise. At first I thought it was -- do you ever see
&gt;&gt; professional demolition where they set the charges on certain floors and
&gt;&gt; then you hear 'Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop'? That's exactly what -- because
&gt;&gt; I thought it was that. When I heard the frigging noise, that's when I
&gt;&gt; saw the building coming down.&quot;
&gt;&gt; http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPH...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Timothy Burke said that &quot;the building popped, lower than the fire. . .
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;. I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;was going oh, my god, there is a secondary device because the way the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;building popped. I thought it was an explosion&quot; (NYT, Burke, pp. 8-9).

&gt;&gt; &quot;Then the building popped, lower than the fire, which I learned was I
&gt;&gt; guess, the aviation fuel fell into the pit, and whatever floor it fell
&gt;&gt; on heated up really bad and that's why it popped at that floor. That's
&gt;&gt; the rumor I heard. But it seemed like I was going oh, my god, there is a
&gt;&gt; secondary device because the way the building popped. I thought it was
&gt;&gt; an explosion&quot;
&gt;&gt; http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPH...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Firefighter Edward Cachia said: &quot;It actually gave at a lower floor, not
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;floor where the plane hit. . . . [W]e originally had thought there was
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;like
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;an internal detonation, explosives, because it went in succession,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;boom,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;boom, boom, boom, and then the tower came down&quot; (NYT, Cachia, p. 5).

&gt;&gt; &quot;As my officer and I were looking at the south tower, it just gave. It
&gt;&gt; actually gave at a lower floor, not the floor where the plane hit,
&gt;&gt; because we originally had thought there was like an internal detonation
&gt;&gt; explosives because it went in succession, boom, boom, boom, boom, and
&gt;&gt; then the tower came down&quot;
&gt;&gt; http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/nyregion/20050812_WTC_GRAPHIC/91...

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Assistant Commissioner Stephen Gregory said: &quot;I thought . . . before .
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;. .
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;No. 2 came down, that I saw low-level flashes. . . . I . . . saw a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;flash
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;flash flash . . . [at] the lower level of the building. You know like
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;when
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;they demolish a building?&quot; (NYT, Gregory, pp. 14-16).

&gt;&gt; We both for whatever reason -- again, I don't know how valid this is
&gt;&gt; with everything that was going on at that particular point in time, but
&gt;&gt; for some reason I thought that when I looked in the direction of the
&gt;&gt; Trade Center before it came down, that I saw low-level flashes. In my
&gt;&gt; conversation with Lieutenant Evangelista, never mentioning this to him,
&gt;&gt; he questioned me and asked me if I saw low-level flashes in front of the
&gt;&gt; building, and I agreed with him because I thought -- at that time I
&gt;&gt; didn't know what it was. I mean, it could have been a result of the
&gt;&gt; building collapsing, things exploding, but I saw a flash flash flash and
&gt;&gt; then it looked like the building came down&quot;

Bzzzztzttt. Wrongoe, Loon. Why don't you ask
these firefighters what they _really_ meant, not
what you and your fellow loons want to pretend?

Today's clue:

The address of the NYC Fire Department is:

FDNY
Nine Metrotech Center
Brooklyn, NY 11201

THe adress for the fire officer's union is

Uniformed Fire Officers Association
225 Broadway Suite 401
New York, NY 10007
212 293 9300

for the main group of firemen:

Uniformed Firefighter's Association
204 East 23rd Street, NY, NY 10010

I'll let you track down the EMS divisions.

In the meantime, here's a quarter to
start you on the track of _real_
facts, not your delusional fantasies.

There are quotes from NY Firemen in "Truth Movement" web pages in
which the fireman is quoted as saying he heard explosions.

When we search for the full statement, we find that someone in the
"Truth Movement" has conveniently left out the rest of the sentence
where the firemen says ".... but it was just stuff hitting the
ground."

Don't base your belief in what happened on 9-11 by ANY quote from a
"Truth Movement" source unless you are able to verify the quote in
context.

Don't trust any quote provided by the "Truth Movement" unless they
also provide a link to full text primary source.

The "Truth Movement" has quotes from NYFD folks that have been edited
to remove the "....but we saw it was just stuff hitting the ground".

Watch out for ellipsis ("...") in "Truth Movement" quotes.  On
occasion the ... substitutes for words that are contrary to the point
the "Truth Movement" wants you to believe.

The people that author that stuff have all the respect for facts of a
Goebbels, or a Rove.

I suspect that the *real* investigation we need is if any of the
instigators of the "Truth Movement" don't work for the latter with the
purpose of distracting us from what the Bush administration is really
up to.

------Relevant Facts Snipped--

There was a bomb situation in the basement near the subway exit, but
it didn't do much but warrant a lot of police attention and bombdiver
activity....I saw that *censored* video too...the Cop Photographer needed the
bux....

But what is important is that NORAD/FAA never publically admitted to
remote flying the planes like they have been doing for the last 25
years...since there was no need for a pilot anyway....there never is in any
flight ....we all know that....

You deny that and you can show how a knuckle dragging Al Quieda flies
a passenger airliner with professional precision with 2 hours of simulator
testing.......

We can close the matter realizing there never a WTC
anyway.....???....the Montauk Mind is a powerful thing....

Your entire post was based that the explosion was before the impact.
Now you have no idea why? You are just guessing at what they think they
heard? How did they know the time of the impact if a large explosiuon
had just occurred? You keep proving that you are guessing at each of
your talking points. Maybe you shouls take a second and do at least
some research before blindly pasting these.

Thanks for conceding that you cannot debate your points. Your blind

and when cornered, you reosrt to childish name-calling just after you
paste about ad hminem attacks. As for never allowing brain-washing by
anyone, it looks like you are victim of such a thing from those that
are telling about this CT. Don't you think if the govt can kill 3000 in
such a case, they can just snuff out Fetzer, Jones, avery,et al in any

I guess you would just as animate if I were to attack your belief in

We have insufficient evidence that the above (remote control of the planes)

there was plenty of time to do before the targets were struck.

&gt;&gt; But what is important is that NORAD/FAA never publically admitted to
&gt;&gt; remote flying the planes like they have been doing for the last 25
&gt;&gt; years...since there was no need for a pilot anyway....there never is in
&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt; flight ....we all know that....

&gt;We have insufficient evidence that the above (remote control of the planes)
&gt;was true on 9/11, and that claim may well be disinformation. It is however a
&gt;FACT that NORAD totally and inexplicably (other than by government
&gt;conspiracy) failed to intercept even one of the four subsonic jets, which
&gt;there was plenty of time to do before the targets were struck.

Are you guessing or know this for a fact? It seems if you can't get any
real expert to agree with you, you tell us they must be worried about
their careers. Maybe if a trained expert made a claim that goes against
reality and his experience and training, then yes, he would have a hard
time being taken seriously in the future. This is why you get tenured
professors that never have to sorry about getting fired (other than
ethics violations, right Mr Jones?).

http://z3.invisionfree.com/911debate/index.php?showtopic=119&amp;st=30 dated
1/21/07 raises the issue of witnesses reporting an explosion in the basement
of one of the WTC towers BEFORE the first plane hit:

I drew no conclusions - I left that for the reader to investigate and decide
upon. You attack and nitpick with me as if I am the person giving the quoted
testimony, but I am not. Express your doubts to the proper sources.

&gt; So the explosion was with a flammable liquid inside the elevator?

No, that is not the case, which you would know if you've been paying
attention. Or are you simply trying to divert from the matter at hand? The
issue here is that some people have stated that there was an explosion in
the basement JUST BEFORE the plane hit the building. If so, it would
indicate an attempt by the Homeland Terrorist conspirators to damage the
supporting structure so the building would collapse immediately upon the
plane's impact. If so, it didn't work - but they were apparently prepared to
take further measures when thought necessary.
