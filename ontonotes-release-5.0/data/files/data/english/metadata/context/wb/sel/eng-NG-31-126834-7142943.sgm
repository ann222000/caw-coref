*25 Advises of  Hazrat Imam Ali Zain ul Abideen a.s.*
*Asalamoalaka ya Hazrat Imam Ali Zain ul Abideen a.s.*

Do not leave him alone when he is in trouble.
22.  Help him out of his troubles, forgive him if he has wronged you and
treat him generously.
23.  Surely, I have never brought to mind the martyrdom of the children of
Fatima (A.S.) except that I have been choked with tears due to it.
24.  Try to earn a high position in Paradise (Jannah). Remember that highest
positions will be given to those who have been most useful to their brothers
in faith and who have been most helpful to the needy.
25.  Remember there are times when a person says but one good sentence and
that brings him very near to Allah and brings his freedom on the Day of
Judgment.
26.  Never think that what you do for your brother in faith is unimportant
because these are the things that will be of much use to you on a day when
nothing else will be of any use.
27.  (Speaking) Good words increase a person's wealth and sustenance,
prolong his life, make him to be loved by his wife and children and take him
to paradise.
28.  He who honors himself will debase the worldly life.
29.  &quot;Our character isn't one of kicking the fallen ones. Neither do we
avenge the enemy when he has fallen and weak. Our character is that of
assisting the poor and the needy.&quot;
30.  But just apposite to his expectation, Imam (as), in his usual manner of
a Muslim must aid a Muslim, called on him: &quot;Salaamun 'Alaikum.&quot; After
greeting him, the Imam (as) offered: &quot;If there is anything I could do for
you, I am ready to do.&quot; Bihar v. 11, p. 17 & 27. And &quot;Al Imam Sadiq Sayyed
al Ahl&quot; translated by Husayn Wijdani, p. 92.
31.  The richest of people is that who is satisfied with what Allah has
chosen for him.
32.  The whole goodness is to protect yourself (against all that which is
unacceptable).
33.  The very hypocrite is that who warns people (against evil deeds) but he
does not stop committing them and orders them (to do good acts) but he does
not do (such acts).
34.  When he stands for offering the prayer he turns right and left, when he
genuflects (in the prayer) he huddles, and when he prostrates himself, he
pecks.
35.  In evenings, his only concern is dinner while he was not fasting.
36.  In mornings, his only concern is to sleep while he has not passed (the
last) night with worship.
37.  The believer, on the other hand, mixes his acts with clemency; he sits
down so that he may learn (something); he keeps silent so that he may save
himself, he does not divulge his secrets before his friends (even); he does
not conceal witnessing for the strangers; he does not act any rightful
action out of showing off, he does not neglect any act out of prudence; if
he is praised, he fears sayings of the eulogists and seeks Allah's
forgiveness for what they do not know; he does not care for the ignorance of
those who ignore him.
38.  To spend moderately in times of poverty, give generously in times of
luxury, treat people fairly, and greet them initiatively - these manners are
within the characters of the believers.
39.  Indeed, the inner knowledge and gnosis and the zenith of the religion
of a Muslim is abandoning such talk which is meaningless and futile, and the
scarcity of his dispute and arguing, and his forbearance and his patience
and fortitude and his politeness and good conduct.
40.  The assemblies of the pious men are the invitations to righteousness
and piety.
41.  *Imam Sajjad (A.S.):* The right of Hajj for you is to know that through
this you enter your God's bounders and you turn to him instead of sinning,
and because of this your sorrow is accepted and you have achieved what God
has asked you to do.
42.  *Imam Ali ibn Hussain (A.S.) says:* When Haji sacrifices in the desert
of Mina (that is a place near Makkah) , his sacrifices will be the price of
his freedom from the fire of the Resurrection Day.
43.  *Imam Sajjad (A.S.) says:* A person, who accepts responsibility for the
family and financial matters of a Haji, has the same reward as a Haji has
himself. It is even as if he has performed Hajj himself.
44.  *Imam Ali ibn Hussain Zainul Abedin (A.S.) says:* When the night of
Arafat and the first hours of the Mina day come, God presents his dearest
Angels to the people standing in Arafat and Mina.
45.  *Imam Ali ibn Hussain Zainul Abedin (A.S.) says:* Pilgrim of God's
House will be forgiven, and he is entitled to go to heaven and his family
and  possessions will be safe and immune.
46.  *Imam Ali ibn Hussain Zainul Abedin (A.S.) says:* Feeding in Makkah is
like fasting in other places and fasting one day in Makkah is equal to
fasting one year in other places and walking in Makkah is a prayer itself.
47.  *Imam Ali ibn Hussain Zainul Abedin (A.S.) says:* Perform Hajj and
Umrah rituals in order to be safe and sound, to make it better living for
your family and make a better life.
48.  Take care. Avoid the companionship of transgressor because he sells you
for a morsel (of food) or less than that.
