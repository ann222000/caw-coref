1 Elandsrand Mine

1.1 First workers surface after mine ordeal

IOL, 4 October 2007

Harmony Gold has hoisted the first 75 of 3 200 trapped miners from its Elandsrand mine near Carletonville, a spokesperson said on Thursday morning.

&quot;We have been able to hoist the first 75 people out using a much smaller lift,&quot; Amelia Soares told Sapa at 1.30am.

&quot;It's a slow process and we will work around the clock.&quot;

She said they were in &quot;good condition&quot; and that paramedics had been sent down to check on the other miners, who were trapped at level 73 of the mine, 2 200m below the surface.

There had been no fatalities or injuries.

She added that in addition to the small lift, the mine was hoping to have a &quot;rock and ventilation lift&quot; reconfigured, which would be able to extract 300 workers per hour.

Soares said there were other outlets for workers, some of whom were making their way to shafts in an adjacent AngloGold Ashanti mine.

A total of 3 200 mineworkers were trapped underground at around 10am on Wednesday. This after a 15m section of a compressed pipe column broke - because of fatigue - just below the shaft surface and fell to the bottom of the shaft used to carry men and materials.

&quot;Nobody was injured, but there was extensive damage to the steel work and electrical feeder cords,&quot; said Soares.

Mine management was in constant contact with the workers, who had access to water and adequate ventilation, said Soares. Their families were being kept informed of developments via a special control room at the mine.

NUM spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka charged in a statement issued on Wednesday night that there was no emergency exit in the shaft, which had &quot;not been maintained for ages&quot;.

Explaining why so many people were trapped underground, Soares said the company had purchased an old mine and extended the shaft downwards.

This meant there were not only people working on the old mine, but workers busy on the new &quot;project&quot; below it, and which was scheduled for commissioning in two years. - Sapa

1.2 No injuries to miners, officials say

IOL, 4 October 2007

About 750 miners of the 3200 trapped underground at Harmony Gold's Elandsrand mine near Carletonville had been rescued by 7am on Thursday, a mine spokesperson said.

&quot;It's slow but steady and we are confident that by 4pm we'll have everybody out,&quot; Amelia Soares said.

&quot;They are in good health and waiting patiently,&quot; she said of the workers still trapped underground.

Responding to union comments that one of the alternative exits had been inaccessible because it was flooded, Soares said that &quot;no one has reported any water&quot;.

The National Union of Mineworkers had also claimed that lack of maintenance caused the pipes to collapse and fall down the mine - which severed the electricity supply to the lift normally used to hoist the workers out of the mine.

Soares said that Harmony spent R1,2-billion on its shafts last year and a further R114-million in capital expenditure.

Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica was expected to arrive at the mine at 11am.

Harmony chairperson Patrice Motsepe had been at the scene the whole night, said Soares.

The Associated Press earlier quoted Motsepe as saying he had been in the mining business since the 1980s and could not remember another incident in which so many miners had been trapped underground.

1.3 Slow progress as miners emerge from darkness

IOL, 4 October 2007

Two hundred of the 3 200 miners trapped underground at Harmony Gold's Elandsrand mine had been brought to the surface by 3am on Thursday, a union official said.

&quot;Two hundred are out. The last trip only brought fifty up,&quot; said the National Union of Mineworkers' national health and safety chairperson Peter Bailey. They had been trapped 2 200m underground for almost 15 hours.

&quot;It's going a bit slow at this stage, but the guys look okay and very exhausted.&quot;

It took about 45 minutes for the lift to come to the surface.

He said some of the workers' relatives who came to the mine had been briefed and were asked to return home &quot;because they were panicking and we had to comfort some of them&quot;.

According to Bailey the biggest problem in the rescue was that there was no alternative exit route.

&quot;We had to modify a lift normally used for materials.&quot;

He said hopes were high that everyone would be brought out safely.

Bailey said Minerals and Energy Minister Lindiwe Hendricks was expected at the scene on Thursday morning.

He said negligence was to blame for the accident which cut off power to the lift normally used to hoist workers to the surface.

&quot;We are quite certain that it was negligence because there was no servicing of the shaft as frequently as it should have.&quot;

The workers were trapped after a 15m section of a compressed pipe column broke - because of fatigue - just below the shaft surface and fell to the bottom of the shaft used to carry men and materials.

&quot;Nobody was injured, but there was extensive damage to the steel work and electrical feeder cords,&quot; said Harmony Gold spokesperson Amelia Soares.

Mine management was in constant contact with the workers, who had access to water and adequate ventilation, she said. Their families were being kept informed of developments via a special control room at the mine. - Sapa

1.4 Still-trapped miners 'anxious'

News24, 4 October 2007

Carletonville - Shouts of joy, whistling, and a big smile accompanied each load of miners as they were brought to the surface from the depths of Harmony Gold's Elandsrand mine near Carletonville on Thursday morning.

&quot;I just want to tell my family that I'm okay,&quot; said Thabang Mokhethi, 40, after almost two days trapped underground.

Many are still trapped, some having been unable to surface since their shift on Tuesday, waiting for their turn on the lift that will hoist them out of the mine.

The lift takes about 30 minutes for the return trip to the surface.

Rescue workers are underground explaining to the miners what happened and assuring them that they will be taken to the surface.

&quot;People are anxious, but once they understand what happened and that they will be brought up they are more calm,&quot; said Edward Molieleng, a mine officer who had been underground speaking to the miners.

They have also managed to take some food and water down, he said.

About 3 200 miners were trapped about 2km underground on Wednesday when a pipe fell into the lift shaft and cut off the power supply to the lift normally used to hoist them out of the mine.

1.5 Miner talks about being trapped underground

Alex Eliseev, IOL, 4 October 2007

In pitch black darkness, 1,5km underground, David Mokgosi sits and thinks about his young sons Tumelo and Kagiso.

Racing through his mind is how scared his wife Aletta and the boys must be as he remains trapped - along with 3 200 other workers - deep inside
the belly of Harmony Gold's Elandsrand mine, in Carltonville, southwest of Joburg.

Some of Mokgosi's colleagues have been underground for over 30 hours and are exhausted, hungry and stressed about how long the rescue operation
will take.

As he finally emerges, 24 hours after starting his shift, Mokgosi's first wish is to call his family - a call he has not had to make in 22 years of working at the mine.

By 8am on Thursday about 1 050 miners had been lifted to safety through a shaft designed to move rocks. As they came to the surface most laughed
with joy, some danced and a few of the women cried.

One miner was carried out of the lifter as he apparently suffered from cramps. Luckily no serious injuries have so far been reported.

Harmony Gold general manager Stan Bierschenk said that at 6.20am on Wednesday, a 70cm diameter pipe carrying compressed air had raptured and
fallen down the mine's main shaft. About 15m of the pipe had broken and crashed down the shaft, damaging its steel works and cables.

The main shaft is used to transport workers down into the 3,2km deep mine. The pipe also cut power to a subshaft.

Througout Wednesday, mine management tried to come up with a way to bring the trapped miners to
the ground.

It was decided to modify an RV (rock and ventilation) shaft by inserting a cage capable of holding 75 workers.

At 12.45am today the first batch of workers rose to the surface. From then on, every half hour 75 more emerged.

It is understood the miners who have been underground the longest descended as early as 6pm on Tuesday.

1.6 All-night rescue saves 1,500 South African miners

Fred Attewill, Chris McGreal in Johannesburg, and agencies, Guardian Unlimited, 4 October 2007

More than 1,500 miners trapped in a collapsed South African gold mine have been rescued in a dramatic all-night rescue operation.

About 1,700 workers remained stranded more than a mile underground after extensive damage to a lift shaft at the Elandsrand mine west of Johannesburg.

The miners, suffering from heat exhaustion in temperatures of up to 40C, were being brought out by a second, smaller lift with a capacity of about 75 people. Some of the men had been trapped underground for more than 28 hours.

Company officials were confident of rescuing all the miners later today. All the workers are said to be in good health.

However, unions expressed fears of a further rock fall and of workers suffocating.

&quot;The speed which people coming up has improved. It is no longer a snail's pace,&quot; said Peter Bailey, the National Union of Mineworkers' health and safety chairman.

&quot;They are very, very stressed and tired and very relieved to be out.&quot;

Sethiri Thibile, one of the first miners to be brought out, said there was no food or water underground.
&quot;I was hungry, though we were all hungry,&quot; said Mr Thibile, 32, who had been underground for 24 hours.

&quot;Most of the people are scared and we also have some women miners there underground.&quot;

Another miner said that conditions were deteriorating. He said the miners were trapped in a confined area that stank of urine and faeces.

Relatives of the miners gathered at the mine offices this morning hoping for news, with many complaining about a lack of information.

&quot;I am very traumatised, exhausted, not knowing what is going on,&quot; said Sam Ramohanoe, whose wife, Flora, 31, was among the trapped miners. He said relatives had had to force the company to send an official to talk to them.

Amelia Soares, spokeswoman for Harmony Gold, the mine owner, said rescue workers were in touch with the workers, who have adequate ventilation and water.

&quot;Nobody was injured, but there was extensive damage to the steel work and electrical feeder cords,&quot; she said. Rescue workers were trying to adapt a second lift, used mainly to carry waste and equipment, to bring the trapped miners out. The second cage can only raise about 300 people an hour.

The company said the rescue attempt involved the largest number of trapped miners in South African history but that the operation should be completed by midday. Paramedics have gone underground to help those still trapped.

The cause of the accident was disputed, with the union blaming a rock fall and the company claiming a pipe carrying chilled water down the shaft, to cool air underground, had broken off, severing an electrical cable carrying power to the main lift.

Ms Soares said some workers were heading to an adjacent AngloAshanti mine in an attempt to leave by its shaft.

Some of the miners were working on sinking the shaft to 2.2 miles to tap richer seams and extend the life of the Elandsrand mine, which taps into the world's largest gold deposits.

The NUM spokesman, Lesiba Seshoka, said workers had previously complained that the shaft had &quot;not been maintained for ages&quot;. &quot;Our guys there tell us that they have raised concerns about the whole issue of maintenance of shafts with the mine [owners] but they have not been attended to,&quot; he said.

The union also criticised Harmony Gold for allegedly failing to have an escape shaft or route, which is common in many other mines.

However, the Harmony Gold acting chief executive, Graham Briggs, rejected the criticism. He said the shaft was in very good condition with a lot of new infrastructure.

South African mines have a poor safety record. The NUM said 12 times as many people are killed in mining accidents in South Africa than in Australia. Nearly 200 miners were killed last year and a similar number are expected to die this year. About 440,000 people work in South African gold, coal and platinum mines.

In July, the minerals and energy minister, Buyelwa Sonjica, toured a goldmine where four people were killed and asked why mine owners had failed to meet a government target to cut fatalities by at least 20% a year. The number of deaths has remained consistent over the past three years.

&quot;We are where we were last year. It doesn't seem we are getting the improvement,&quot; Ms Sonjica said.

The mine owners say South Africa faces unique problems because its mines are among the deepest in the world. The NUM blames lack of investment is the problem.

1.7 Rescuers save 1 700 trapped miners

James Macharia and Staff Reporter, Mail &amp; Guardian, 4 October 2007

Rescue teams working to save 3 200 miners trapped deep underground in a South African gold mine brought 1 700 to the surface on Thursday morning, mine and union officials said.

Harmony said the rescue operation was going smoothly and that a secondary lift was bringing up batches of miners stranded underground when the electricity cable of the main lift was cut in an accident.

But the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said it suspected negligence was behind the accident and vowed to push gold firms to build secondary, or emergency, exits in the mine.

Chief executive officer Graham Briggs told Reuters he was confident all the miners would be lifted to the surface in a small elevator at mine near Carletonville, south-west of Johannesburg.

&quot;There have been no injuries or deaths ... It may take as long as 10 hours, the cage is travelling fairly slowly to avoid risks ... I'm very confident all will come out,&quot; Briggs said.

Briggs said production at the mine had been halted and would remain shut down until an investigation had been carried out and the damage repaired. Harmony is the world's fifth biggest gold producer.

But the NUM said it suspected that negligence and Harmony's practice of mining 24 hours per day caused the accident.

&quot;We suspect negligence. Because of continuous operations there is no time to make adequate checks,&quot; NUM president Senzeni Zokwana told reporters.

Zokwaba said emergency exits were needed to give workers an alternative escape route. &quot;The manner of mining is a problem, we want to push the companies to build secondary exits, linked to the neighbouring mine,&quot; he said.

The first miners emerged at around 23.30pm GMT, after being trapped 2,2km underground for over 15 hours. Between 150 and 200 women miners were among those trapped.

&quot;I feel happy to be on the surface. it was hot, dusty and I am quite hungry now,&quot; said 27-year-old Zandile Sindiwe, as he walked out of the elevator into a cold, windy night.

By 5.20am GMT, 1 350 mineworkers had been brought to the surface and mine officials said they hoped to have the remaining workers above ground by early afternoon.

NUM spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka told the Mail &amp; Guardian Online at 9.30am on Thursday morning that 1 700 miners had been rescued.

&quot;As the union we are very upset and angry at what has happened. The mine needs to be brought to book, you cannot allow an incident like this to happen where 3 000 people are trapped. The minister needs to intervene. This cannot continue and they must be held responsible.&quot;

Another NUM spokesperson said earlier that the miners were trapped in a cramped space where temperatures could reach 30° to 40° Celsius.

The miners were caught after an air pipe broke off and hurtled down the shaft, damaging steelwork and severing an electrical cable carrying power to the main lift, Briggs said.

Air and water

Rescuers were in contact with the trapped miners and clean air and water were being pumped down to them, Briggs said. &quot;It's a very serious incident, but it's under control,&quot; he added. They were using a smaller lift close to the main elevator.

South African gold mines are the deepest in the world and unions have often criticised companies for not doing enough to ensure workers' safety.

Gold mine operations have come under scrutiny over the past few months following a series of accidents as gold producers mine ever deeper to offset lower production and reap the benefits of a sharply higher bullion price.

Gold output in South Africa, the world's biggest gold producer, has tumbled by over 50% over the past decade, as high-grade mines run out of ore and firms grapple with more difficult and high-cost underground operations.

The government briefly closed an AngloGold Ashanti mine in July after two miners were killed in a rock fall.

Harmony bought the Elandsrand mine and nearby Deelkraal operations from rival AngloGold Ashanti in 2001. At the time production was declining and Harmony saw potential in digging a new mine underneath the old one.

Harmony, which employs around 44 000 people and produced 2,4-million ounces of gold in 2006, expects to complete the new Elandsrand mine by 2011 and to mine it for a further 18 years. - Reuters

1.8 Half of Harmony miners safe

Fin24, 4 October 2007

Elandsrand Mine - Around 1 500 miners remained trapped more than a mile underground in a South African gold mine on Thursday after an all-night rescue mission.

Mining officials said 3 200 workers were stranded when the electricity cable of the Elandsrand mine's main lift was severed in an accident.

Up to 200 women were among those stuck in a cramped space where temperatures could reach 40 degrees Celsius.

The first miners saved by a secondary lift emerged in the middle of the night after being trapped 2.2km underground for more than 15 hours.

&quot;I feel happy to be on the surface. It was hot, dusty and I am quite hungry now,&quot; said 27-year-old Zandile Sindiwe.

Mine owner Harmony Gold said the rescue operation was going smoothly and those underground were being pumped clean air and water. By 09:30, 1 650 mineworkers had been brought to the surface.

&quot;It's a very serious incident, but it's under control,&quot; Harmony chief executive officer Graham Briggs told Reuters.

The mine's general manager, Stan Bierschenk, said the morale of workers still stuck below ground was &quot;fairly brittle&quot;.

Both the company and the mining union said better safety standards were needed at the pit near Carletonville, southwest ofJohannesburg.

Company chairperson Patrice Motsepe described the accident as a &quot;wake up call to all of us&quot;. He said he expected all the miners, who were being pulled up in small lift slowly to avoid risks, to emerge by about 13:00.

Deepest in world

Production at the mine has been halted and it will remain shut until an investigation had been carried out and the damage repaired, Briggs said. Harmony is the world's fifth biggest gold producer.

The miners were caught after an air pipe broke off and hurtled down the shaft, damaging steelwork and severing an electrical cable carrying power to the main lift, Briggs said.

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said it suspected negligence and Harmony's practice of mining 24 hours per day caused the accident.

&quot;We suspect negligence. Because of continuous operations there is no time to make adequate checks,&quot; NUM President Senzeni Zokwana told reporters.

Zokwana said emergency exits were needed to give workers an alternative escape route. &quot;The manner of mining is a problem, we want to push the companies to build secondary exits, linked to the neighbouring mine,&quot; he said.

Motsepe agreed additional measures were needed to protect workers underground. &quot;Our safety records both as a company and as a country leave much to be desired,&quot; he told reporters.

South African gold mines are the deepest in the world and unions have often criticised companies for not doing enough to ensure workers' safety.

Gold mine operations have come under scrutiny over the past few months after a series of accidents. Gold producers are mining ever deeper to offset lower production and reap the benefits of a sharply higher bullion price.

1.9 Union says negligence to blame for mine incident

SABC, 4 October 2007

Harmony Gold has vehemently denied allegations that negligence was the cause of the accident at its Elandsrand gold mine in Carletonville on Gauteng's West Rand. Mine management responded after the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) said it suspected negligence and a 24 hour day operation were the causes of workers being trapped.

A pipe collapsed, cutting the power to the lift normally used to hoist workers to the surface. NUM's Peter Bailey says the shaft was not serviced as frequently as it should have been. Investor Relations Officer, Lizelle du Toit, says it is untrue that an alternative exit route was under water.

About 200 of the 3 200 trapped workers had been underground since Tuesday night. An alternative exit was not accessible because it was underwater, Bailey said. Those that had been brought out were exhausted, hungry, stressed out and relieved, he added. About 75 workers were being extracted at a time via a small shaft normally used to bring equipment into the mine. They were trapped around level 73 of the mine, about 2 200m underground, after a pipe fell into the lift shaft and cut off the power supply to the lift normally used to hoist workers up to the surface.

Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica was expected at the mine this morning, Bailey said earlier the Elandsrand mine was 3 566m deep and would have 117 levels when it was completed.

1.10 Harmony Gold shares slide after mine accident

Business Day, 4 October 2007

SHARES in Harmony Gold slid today after an accident trapped 3 200 miners deep underground. Shares fell as much as 4,9% to R72,50 in early trade before recovering to R73,49, a loss of 3,6%.

This compares to a dip of 0,8% in SA's gold mining index.

Rescue teams brought 1 350 of the trapped miners to the surface this morning, mine and union officials said.

Harmony said the rescue operation was going smoothly and that a secondary lift was bringing up batches of miners stranded underground when the electricity cable of the main lift was cut in an accident. But the National Union of Mineworkers said it suspected negligence was behind the accident and vowed to push gold firms to build secondary, or emergency, exits in the mine.

CEO Graham Briggs said he was confident all the miners would be lifted to the surface in a small elevator at the Elandsrand mine near Carletonville, southwest of Johannesburg.

&quot;There have been no injuries or deaths ... It may take as long as 10 hours, the cage (lift) is travelling fairly slowly to avoid risks ... I'm very confident all will come out,&quot; Briggs said.

He said production at the mine had been halted and would remain shut down until an investigation had been carried out and the damage repaired. Harmony is the world's fifth biggest gold producer.

1.11 Mine accident a wake up call, says Motsepe

Business Day, 4 October 2007

THE accident at Harmony Gold's Elandsrand mine near Carletonville, where miners were trapped underground, should be a wake-up call, the company's chairman Patrice Motsepe said today.

Looking on as load after load of miners were brought to the surface, Motsepe told reporters that he was concerned that the issue of health and safety was becoming critical.

&quot;We have to recommit ourselves to refocus on safety in this country, our safety record both as a company and an industry leave much to be desired,&quot; he said.

Motsepe committed the mine and the company to co-operate fully with the investigation into what happened at the mine. He said it was no longer good enough to just talk about safety.

&quot;We run companies that have an obligation to all constituencies. Shareholders are one of those constituencies but we have an obligation to our employees (as well),&quot; he said.

&quot;It's not a matter we should talk about, I think it is a matter where it's more urgent that we show the sort of behaviour and conduct that reflects our commitment,&quot; he said.

Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica arrived at the mine at 9am to assess the situation where about half of 3 200 miners remained trapped underground.

Spokeswoman Bontle Mafuna said, &quot;The minister has arrived to monitor the situation and to see to it that everyone is rescued. These are people's lives, we are very concerned about people's safety,&quot; she said.

Mafuna said the department had become more vigilant as to the safety of workers. Rescuers hoped to have everyone out by 1pm today.

The miners became trapped yesterday morning when a pipe fell into the lift shaft and cut off the power supply to the lift normally used to hoist them out of the mine.

1.12 Health and safety legislation to be 'tightened up'

SABC, 4 October 2007

Health and Safety legislation would be &quot;tightened up&quot; to try and prevent mining accidents, Minerals and Energy Minister Buyelwa Sonjica said today. Visiting Harmony Gold's Elandsrand mine near Carletonville, where miners were trapped underground, Sonjica shook hands with some of the workers who were brought to the surface.

She added that while incidents of this kind occurred, there was room for improvement. The miners became trapped on Tuesday night when a pipe fell into the lift shaft and cut off the power supply to the lift normally used to hoist them up to the surface.

About 1 700 hundred miners have been rescued at the Elandsrand gold mine at Carletonville on Gauteng's West Rand so far. 3 200 mine workers were trapped there.

2 SAMWU strike

2.1 Samwu threat of national strike

Amy Musgrave, Political Correspondent, Business Day, 4 October 2007

THE South African Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) is threatening to call a countrywide strike if a Labour Court ruling does not go its way today.

The union, which embarked on a two-day strike earlier this week, wants the court to grant it an order that allows it to continue with the industrial action. The union was initially given two days to strike.

If the union were to embark on a countrywide strike, there would be severe disruption of municipal services, and this just a few months after schooling and some health-care services were brought to a standstill due to a strike by public servants.

&quot;If the Labour Court ... does not give the desired result, we will apply for a national strike to pursue our demands,&quot; said the union' s Johannesburg secretary, Dumisani Langa. The union's Johannesburg members want free transport to and from work on municipal buses, salary parity for employees with the same experience and qualifications, and an end to job casualisation. Samwu and city bosses appeared in the Labour Court yesterday to make their cases.

2.2 Court rules against secondary strike

Citizen, 4 October 2007

Municipal workers in Johannesburg will not be allowed to call a secondary strike, the Johannesburg Labour Court ruled on Thursday.

The court also ordered the union to go back to the negotiating table.

Judge Annelie Basson said reasons for the ruling would be presented to both counsel at court after 2pm on Friday.

Dumisani Langa, the union's spokesman said, &quot;We believe the issues we have raised are genuine and once the court gives us the reasons for their ruling tomorrow, we will map the way forward.&quot; -Sapa

2.3 Hearing on municipal strike postponed

IOL, 3 October 2007

The Johannesburg Labour Court has postponed to Thursday a hearing on whether striking Johannesburg municipal workers could call a secondary strike.

Workers affiliated to the SA Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) have been on strike since Monday.

The court postponed the hearing on Wednesday after counsel for Johannesburg city, Paul Kennedy, said some of the union demands were unclear.

&quot;There is a disagreement about what is meant by parity. Before we can take the matter any further the city needs to understand what exactly the union is demanding.&quot;

The striking workers are demanding, among others, free transport to and from work on municipal buses, salary parity for employees with the same experience and qualifications.

They also want an end to the casualisation of jobs, and the introduction of fixed term contracts for lower-end employees.

Kennedy said the parity issue had to be clarified as the city was of the view that parity already existed.

&quot;Why is it so hard for the union to articulate what exactly they mean so that the employers know what they are talking about.&quot;

Counsel for Samwu, Robert la Grange, said parity meant different things to different people and that the city had not been able to come to an agreement with the union on the issue.

Parity had become the &quot;centre of gravity&quot; in the dispute.

The case will resume at 9.30am on Thursday. - Sapa

2.4 Jo'burg municipal workers head back to court

SABC, 4 October 2007

Striking Johannesburg municipal workers may call a secondary strike with other Gauteng municipalities if the city's Labour Court rules in their favour today.

The South African Municipal Workers Union appeared at court yesterday but the matter was postponed for a ruling today. Samwu won the first round against the city at the court last week which ruled that non-essential service workers and emergency service workers could strike.

The ruling followed a failed application by the city seeking an interdict to prevent the action. The court ruled that the city had not complied with the five-day notice period required by law.

Union spokesperson Dumisani Langa said if the union won the final round against the city today, they would rope in other Gauteng municipalities to join in the strike. &quot;If the court says we can go ahead with a protected strike, we will serve all Gauteng municipalities with notices of a secondary strike,&quot; said Langa.

The union's Eastern Cape and Ekurhuleni members have already given their assurance that if Samwu's demands in Johannesburg were not met, they would support the secondary strike. The case resumes this morning. - Sapa

2.5 Municipal workers 'short-changed'

Tania Broughton, The Mercury, 4 October 2007

Many of the eThekwini Municipality's 18 000 employees have been short-changed in their pay packets for the past six months after the municipality implemented a wage and working conditions agreement that has been struck down by the Labour Court, municipal unions say.

And now more legal action is being threatened because the municipality, while conceding the court ruled that the agreement was null and void, says it wants to appeal against the judgment. And it will not revert to previous conditions of employment in the meantime because the court did not order that it should.

The agreement, the Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union (Imatu) says, negatively affected overtime rates, travelling allowances, long-service awards and injury on duty benefits. This has prompted threats of strikes and refusal to work overtime, particularly by workers in the city's emergency services and the Electricity Department.

One of the greater ramifications was the reduction of benefits to those injured on duty from 100 percent pay to 75 percent pay.

The agreement, which was signed by both major municipal unions - Imatu and the South African Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu) - in March this year, stemmed from the municipality's quest for uniform pay and working conditions for all of its employees.

Imatu regional manager Dempsey Perumal said yesterday that negotiations on the issue began in 2006 and culminated in a workshop with facilitators in early March, at which certain issues were agreed to in principle.

He said the unions were asked to attend a meeting at the end of that month at which they were presented with a document by municipal officials which, believing it to be consistent with propo sals discussed at the workshop, they had signed.

When it became apparent that the agreement went far beyond that discussed, both unions made applications in the Durban Labour Court to have it set aside.

Perumal said this was on &quot;clear mandates&quot; from employees, even from those few who had benefited through the pay parity provisions.

&quot;We believe that the municipality rushed it through simply to save itself money in the long term. While some people did get increases in pay, in most cases these were off-set by the reduction in the overtime rate and other benefits.&quot;

The Labour Court declared the agreement unlawful, agreeing with the technical point made by Imatu that it should have been negotiated nationally, not locally. Perumal said the unions now had to go back to their members to get a fresh mandate on the way forward.

Imatu's attorney, Mark Futcher, said the municipality had lodged an application for leave to appeal, which would be opposed.

Although Municipal Manager Michael Sutcliffe could not be reached for comment, The Mercury is in possession of a circular to all employees, signed by him, which was released yesterday.

In it, he says there will be no change to terms and conditions of employment because the court &quot;did not require the conditions of service to revert to the status prior to April 1&quot;.

&quot;When leave to appeal is granted, the case will be referred to the Labour appeal court,&quot; he said, estimating that it would only be heard in 12 to 15 months.

3 Workers' issues

3.1 Fawu calls for 'farm TRC'

Sowetan, 4 October 2007

A workers' union has called for truth-commission type hearings to expose what it says is the &quot;devastating situation&quot; of farmworkers in the country.

The Food and Allied Workers' Union (Fawu) made the call yesterday following the Supreme Court of Appeal's overturning last week of the &quot;lion murder&quot; conviction of Mark Scott-Crossley.

Fawu said the ruling was a miscarriage of justice, and that it was increasingly evident that in cases where farm workers were murdered and tortured, the perpetrators got off lightly.

&quot;We call for a process similar to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to unearth the devastating situation of farm workers. Maybe such a process would start to address the endless murders and other atrocities committed against defenceless victims on farms,&quot; Fawu said.

In a statement, Cosatu said justice had been &quot;ill-served&quot; by the appeal court's decision.

&quot;Scott-Crossley is still guilty of a very serious and gruesome offence, which deserves a much more severe sentence than the five years he has now been given,&quot; the Cosatu statement said.

Cosatu was also &quot;concerned that the appeal judges had criticised the trial judge for his comments that the relationship between farm workers and their employers was characterised by a &quot;domineering&quot; and &quot;overbearing&quot; attitude on the part of the master&quot;. - Sapa

3.2 Probe food price hikes: Labour

Citizen, 4 October 2007

The Food and Allied Workers' Union (Fawu) has called on the government to probe the increasing prices of basic foodstuffs.

&quot;We believe that the sky-rocketing food prices are the result of anti-competitive conduct by the major role players in the food production and supply chain...,&quot; Fawu said in a statement on Wednesday.

This included excessive pricing in the bread industry; the abuse of dominance in the grain silo industry; and price-fixing in the diary industry, the union said.

&quot;...We believe the situation is of such a nature that an urgent commission of inquiry needs to be appointed to establish facts and recommend an appropriate course of action.&quot;

Fawu had not yet approached the government. It intended first raising the issue to a prominent place in the public discourse, said general secretary Katishi Masemola.

This, after an SABC television news report on Tuesday that grocers were seeing an 80 percent increase on prices for fresh vegetables in the past year.

A trader in Port Elizabeth told the national broadcaster the cost of a bag of cabbages had risen from R18 to R30.

Another trader, in Walmer, said prices were the highest she could remember. Her customers were not going to pay R7 or R8 a cabbage.

While the increase was put down to extreme weather conditions playing havoc with farmers' crops, SABC reported that prices were expected to rise even more on the back of the latest petrol price increase.

Masemola said Fawu would be making its submission for a price probe to the Ministries of Land Affairs, Agriculture and Trade and Industry.

He said the Competition Commission started investigations about six months ago into the prices of bread and milk. These had yet to be finalised.

However, Fawu believed the seriousness of the matter warranted an &quot;overarching&quot; investigation into all food prices was needed and would have to include the competition authorities, trade unions and civil society organisations.

&quot;It's about time the issue (of food prices) is looked at in a structured way,&quot; said Masemola.

In its statement, Fawu said it believed the nationalising of some companies in the food production and supply-chain, and the establishment of state-owned enterprises in the value-chain would help address the problem.

According to Statistics SA (StatsSA) figures, the price of a loaf of white bread rose from R4.79 in June 2006 to R5.30 in June 2007; a kilogramme of rice cost R6.34 in 2006 and R7.08 in 2007; and a kilogramme of samp went up from R3.79 last year to R4.63 this year.

Stats SA recorded an increase in the price of a litre of fresh milk from R5.12 in June 2006 to R6.01 in June 2007, and of a kilogramme of white sugar from R6.68 to R7.07.

Fawu is an affiliate of the Congress of SA Trade Unions, whose president Willie Madisha said in June that the price of meat had risen more than R8 in the preceding 12 months.

Addressing striking public service employees, Madisha said workers could no longer afford to buy bread, petrol or maize meal.

The government departments could not be reached for comment late on Wednesday afternoon. - SAPA

3.3 'Workers pay for exec bonuses'

Fin24, 3 October 2007

Trade union Solidarity has accused Denel of using employee salary funds to pay bonuses to top management.

While Denel is locked in a protracted dispute with four trade unions about exemption from national wage increases, 49 top management members have been paid performance bonuses totalling R2.2m, Solidarity spokesperson Jaco Kleynhans said on Wednesday.

Performance bonus payments to management members were discussed with the trade unions at a Denel labour forum late last year.

In terms of these discussions, individual contracts were concluded with management members to achieve certain targets.

The seven Denel trade unions approved the process, which provided for management members who achieved their targets to receive bonuses in the 2006 financial year, while staff would receive bonuses the following year, he said.

In the interim, Solidarity, the SA Chemical Workers' Union (Sacwu), the Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood and Allied Workers' Union (Ceppwawu), and the General Industry Workers' Union of SA (Giwusa) took Denel Munitions to the National Bargaining Forum for the Chemical Industry (NBCCI) in November 2006 to oppose the application for a 2.5% cut-back in the agreed wage increases.

An arbitration finding in April this year stipulated that the munitions manufacturer had to pay the increases contained in the national agreement, and that payment had to be made retrospectively from July 2006.

Denel was unhappy with this finding and the matter would be taken on review to the Labour Court soon.

&quot;Solidarity believes firmly that Denel used its employees' salary funds to pay bonuses to management members,&quot; Kleynhans said.

&quot;While Denel fights to pay its workers less than the amount stipulated in the national agreement on the grounds that finances are a problem, the company simultaneously pays exorbitant bonuses to management.

&quot;Savings from the non-compliance with the national agreement are spent on profligate management bonuses.&quot;

Solidarity did not object to the principle of incentive bonuses, but did object to the way in which these payments were made, Kleynhans said.

The bonuses were paid to management members at the end of July this year. - Sapa

3.4 Metal and engineering sector pilots artisan training project to fast-track skills

Ronnie Morris, Business Report, 4 October 2007

In a bid to address the skills shortage in the metal and engineering industry in the Western Cape, a pilot project will indenture 150 new apprentices through an accelerated artisan training project.

According to Colin Boyes, the executive director of the Cape Engineers and Founders Association, the project is aimed at the larger, well-resourced firms that have an established track record of artisan training.

The association has members in the foundry industry, steel industry, ship repairs, offshore oil and gas, precision engineering, tool making, auto components, boat building, light and heavy engineering, boiler manufacturing, electronics and information technology and plastic conversion sectors.

It is working with the Metal, Engineering and Related sector education and training authority (Seta), which has persuaded firms that plan to take on new apprentices to ramp up their intake.

Boyes said the Western Cape engineering industry employed 30 000 people and was pivotal to providing services and production to a diverse market locally and internationally.

There were learnerships available at national curriculum vocational (NCV) colleges to provide theoretical training.

&quot;We want to involve all stakeholders in the industry to have a structured approach to training,&quot; Boyes said.

&quot;To illustrate the problem we face, Eskom has said that with the recapitalisation of the power stations, it needs 10 000 local artisans.&quot;

The Western Cape was of primary interest but faced the same problems.

&quot;You find that wages for artisans with skills get chased up because of the shortage. The sensible way to address that is to have a structured training programme in place,&quot; he added.

&quot;We want to send a signal to young people out there, particularly in the townships: get maths and science as part of your curriculum to open up opportunities for yourselves in the metal and engineering industries. There are huge opportunities for a long-term career.''

The training would be funded by the Seta and each employer that covered costs would receive a grant that had tax-deductible benefits attached to it.

&quot;It's quite an attractive scheme,'' Boyes said.

The association was talking to the Western Cape provincial government to set up a co-ordinating body so that all could work in the same direction.

Colleges were subsidised by the state and students could work in vocational training for the last three years of schooling. Students would do practicals in workshops at colleges.

The association has already spent R16 million on the NCV college in Cape Town to recapitalise and set up practical facilities to give young learners an idea of what it would be like to work on proper machinery in the workplace.

&quot;There was an unfortunate start [with the Seta] and it took a long time to get up and running, but we think there's a lot of goodwill to make it work for us,'' Boyes said.

4 Union matters

4.1 D-Day for Madisha

IOL, 3 October 2007

The fate of beleaguered Cosatu president Willie Madisha is to be decided on Thursday.

Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said on Wednesday this would happen at a central executive committee to discuss issues surrounding Madisha.

Last month, Madisha came under fire from his own executive for the way he handled the matter of a R500 000 &quot;donation&quot; to the SA Communist Party (SACP).

At the end of August, Madisha and a witness told police they delivered a R500 000 donation to SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande in 2002.

Nzimande later denied ever receiving the R500 000 donation, allegedly made by businessman Charles Modise.

An SACP task team has found no credible evidence that the donation had ever existed.

The CEC comes a month ahead of schedule.

On September 17, a special Cosatu CEC meeting was held in Kempton Park. At the time, Vavi said the next special CEC session would be held in November to discuss &quot;corrective measures&quot; about the issue.

Cosatu spokesperson Patrick Craven said a news briefing would be held after Thursday's meeting, the details of which would be announced later.

&quot;Yes, we are planning one but I can't give a time. We have no idea when the meeting will finish, we may give fairly short notice,&quot; he said.

Madisha could not immediately be reached for comment on Wednesday. - Sapa

4.2 Cosatu's Willie Madisha to know his fate tomorrow

SABC, 3 October 2007

Cosatu's senior leaders will decide the fate of its President Willie Madisha tomorrow.

The Central Executive Committee will hold a special meeting to discuss Madisha's handling of the alleged R500 000 donation by arrested businessman Charles Modise to the SACP coffers five years ago.

Initially the CEC meeting was scheduled for November, but it seems as if Madisha's colleagues want to decide on his future within the structures of the movement sooner rather than later. There have been suggestions that anti-Madisha elements within Cosatu's leadership want to fire Madisha and replace him with Cosatu's first deputy president, S'dumo Dlamini, as acting president.

Madisha has earned himself the wrath of his peers for accusing SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande of embezzling the R500 000. Nzimande has denied this. An SACP internal investigation has failed to prove the existence of the donation. Cosatu's CEC will also look at the findings by the SACP task team.

4.3 Constitutional Court to rule on CCMA workplace role

Citizen, 4 October 2007

A landmark ruling relating to industrial labour relations is to be made in the Constitutional Court on Friday.

This followed an application brought by the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) in May this year on the role and authority of the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) in workplace rulings.

Cosatu spokesman Patrick Craven said the judgment would probably be the most important ever in industrial labour relations.

&quot;The ruling by the ConCourt will have major repercussions for the workers in that it will determine not only the employer/employee relationship but also the way the CCMA deals with cases,&quot; Craven said.

Two months ago, Cosatu took the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) to the Constitutional court, following a ruling it made in a matter involving Mr Z Sidumo and the Trade Union.

Sidumo worked as a security guard at the Rustenburg Platinum Mines Ltd and was dismissed for allegedly failing to fulfil his duties some years back.

The matter was taken to the CCMA and Labour Court and the employer lost, but it appealed to the SCA. The SCA overturned the ruling by the Labour Court.

In its findings the SCA said &quot;CCMA commissioners should be cautious when dealing with workplace sanctions imposed by employers and therefore respect employer's sanctions as it is primarily their function to decide on proper sanctions&quot;.

&quot;That decision by the SCA made a major change for the worse about the role of the CCMA,&quot; Craven said.
&quot;It imposes a criteria the CCMA should use in determining whether dismissals are fair or not.

&quot;As far as we are concerned this favours the employer and restricts the CCMA,&quot; he said. - Sapa

4.4 Zille booed at briefing: Cosatu reacts

SABC, 4 October 2007

The Congress of South African Trade Unions' leadership in the Western Cape has moved to restrain its members who threatened to walk out of a meeting being addressed by Cape Town Mayor, Helen Zille.

Zille was invited to address Cosatu delegates on the city's plan to fight the scourge of drug abuse in communities. Cosatu's Tony Ehrenreich has appealed for co-operation from South African municipal workers union (Samwu) members.

Last month, the City obtained an urgent court interdict against Samwu's intentions to go on strike against restructuring. A Samwu speaker from the floor says 120 traffic officials stand to lose their jobs. It was reported that there was pandemonium as she rose to address delegates when Cosatu delegates started booing Zille off the stage.

Zille accused some Cosatu leaders of playing political games.

4.5 Zille booed off stage

Karen Breytenbach, Cape Times, 4 October 2007

A meeting in the City Hall to which Cosatu had invited the provincial and city governments to discuss a joint war on drugs erupted in chaos as invited speakers - including the mayor and a member of the Mitchells Plain Community Policing Forum - were booed off the stage.

Affiliate unions also hijacked the meeting to deal with unrelated issues.

The SA Municipal Workers' Union was the first to protest about Zille's presence. Its members threatened to walk out in anger over the city's retrenchment of 120 traffic officers. The union agreed to stay after Cosatu provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich pleaded with its members to use the opportunity to engage the city administration on the issue of drug abuse.

Motivational speaker Jurgens Smit gave a presentation on dealing with drug addiction.

Norman Jantjies, on behalf of Community Safety MEC Leonard Ramatlakane, said the department was working with the department of Social Development, the NGO sector and communities to prevent gansterism and drug dealing.

The Community Safety department had tried to increase &quot;visible policing&quot; and had recruited neighbourhood watches to help it monitor communities, Jantjies said. Millions were being spent on school safety, liquor control and combating gangsterism.

The police were targeting 15 areas, he said, before being cut short by howling members of the audience.

As Zille stepped behind the microphone, she was goaded by members of the National Union of Metal Workers in the back rows.

Ehrenreich and Cosatu provincial chairman Munroe Mkalipi tried in vain to call the audience to order and before long a group of Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers' Union (SACTWU) members danced to the front of the stage.

Zille left without being able to give her speech.

Mitchells Plain Community Policing Forum deputy chair Abe Isaacs took the podium next, but spoke for less than a minute before chaos erupted again and he had to stop.

Most of about 600 shop stewards from different sectors who filled the hall began yelling, ululating and toyitoying, prompting Ehrenreich and Mkalipi to plead for calm.

The rest of the meeting was used to brief the audience on negotiations with various sectors at the National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac).

The SA Transport and Allied Workers' Union's regional secretary, Evan Abrahamse, said negotiations with Metrorail were bearing fruit. Metrorail appeared open to the union's suggestion to allow free travel for pensioners by April. Metrorail had also agreed to improve security by putting up CCTV cameras at stations.

Other issues on the table were overcrowding, damaged carriages, trains being late, the need for more trains at more frequent intervals, and the establishment of a fund for victims of accidents or crime on trains.

The National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union was to meet public health representatives at Nedlac in four weeks to discuss the underfunding of Groote Schuur and Tygerberg hospitals and cuts in beds, said spokesperson Soraya Jawoodeen.

5 South Africa
5.1 PSL sponsorship deal: CWU backs Manuel

IOL, 3 October 2007

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) on Wednesday said it fully supported Finance Minister Trevor Manuel in his criticism of the Premier Soccer League (PSL)'s new sponsorship deal.

This was after Manuel described commission payments to soccer officials as part of a R500-million sponsorship deal between the PSL and Absa Bank as &quot;morally reprehensible and corrupt&quot;.

&quot;We fully support Manuel in his endeavour to deracinate and stop the creeping ludicrous commissions claimed by the PSL executives,&quot; CWU spokesperson Mfanafuthi Sithebe said.

&quot;We firmly believe that this 10 percent commission, claimed by the PSL executives is also central to the PSL-SABC Broadcasting rights.&quot;

He said the CWU urged Manuel to further probe South African Airways, Telkom South Africa, the New York Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to see if there were any commissions paid by these institutions to these executives.

&quot;If so.. look for the possibility of recouping such loses from the respective chief executives of those institutions and the respective board of directors.

&quot;CWU will ensure that the socio-corporate investment by the aforementioned institutions does not cause any adverse effect to the poorly paid and the most vulnerable workers - by enriching the 10 percent brigades,&quot; Sithebe said. - Sapa

5.2 PSL bosses deny greed

Siyabonga Mkhwanazi and Sapa, Daily News, 3 October 2007

Parliament is to turn up the heat on Absa Bank and the Premier Soccer League (PSL) in the wake of public anger over soccer executives being in line for massive commissions on sponsorship deals.

After an emergency meeting on Tuesday the PSL denied that executive members had been paid commission for their part in the R1,6-billion television rights deal or the R500-million Absa sponsorship deal.

The PSL had not even formally decided yet whether it would pay its negotiators any commission at all, its chairperson Irvin Khoza said.

The urgent talks were called after Finance Minister Trevor Manuel criticised as &quot;morally reprehensible and corrupt&quot; the payment of commission to soccer officials involved in the two deals.

&quot;My understanding is that individuals are elected to the League's various committees to serve the interests of the sport, not in the expectation of acquiring personal fortunes to the detriment of the organisation they are representing,&quot; Manuel wrote in an open letter to Absa chief executive officer Steve Booysen.

But the swift denial of immoral behaviour by PSL executive members is unlikely to mollify the ruling African National Congress and the opposition Democratic Alliance.

The National Assembly's sport committee chairperson Butana Komphela said on Tuesday that Absa and PSL representatives would be summoned before it over the R50-million in commission apparently earmarked for the league's bosses.

Komphela did not mince his words, saying the deal smacked of corruption and that he backed Manuel over the issue.

Manuel wrote a letter of complaint last week to Absa expressing his strong opposition to the payments earmarked for PSL executives Irvin Khoza (Orlando Pirates), Kaizer Motaung (Kaizer Chiefs), Mato Madlala (Golden Arrows), Trevor Phillips (former PSL chief executive officer) and Peter Mancer (consultant).

But on Tuesday Khoza was quick to deny that the five executives were set to be rewarded a handsome 10% commission after securing the R500-million sponsorship over a five-year period with Absa.

Another deal

A few months ago the same five individuals who comprise the League's sponsorship committee raised eyebrows after they lined up for R30-million each for securing R1,6-billion broadcast rights with SuperSport International over five years.

When he learned of the possibility of the hefty commission, Manuel wrote to Absa pointing out this was tantamount to corruption.

Khoza said the PSL had not discussed commission with Absa, nor had it asked Absa to pay commission as part of the sponsorship deal.

No money had yet changed hands. All that had transpired was the signing of &quot;heads of agreement&quot; on the terms of the sponsorship.

The PSL had noted &quot;with concern&quot; recent statements on the payment of commission some of which were &quot;defamatory&quot;, it said in a statement read by Khoza.

Describing the remarks as &quot;offensive&quot;, it said they were &quot;premature and unfortunate&quot;, and not fully informed.

&quot;Payment of commission is a work in progress. No final decision was been taken. No final payments have been made,&quot; said Khoza.

The process was being undertaken in line with requirements for good corporate governance, under the oversight of auditors and in terms of the PSL's constitution.

No commissions

Khoza emphasised that no matter what the final decision, &quot;no executive committee member will be entitled to commission&quot;.

&quot;Spare us our sanity. Spare us our integrity. Wait until we make the necessary announcement at the appropriate time,&quot; he said.

Khoza said Manuel had been informed of the issue of payment of commission prior to the publication of his letter.

&quot;I respect Manuel. He has struggle credentials. He's done very well for the country.

&quot;He may have information at his disposal that enabled him to make such pronouncements,&quot; said Khoza. In his reaction, Komphela said he was fully behind the minister of finance in his criticism of the payment.

&quot;We [the sport committe] are going to request the joint committee of finance and us to get clear comment from Absa and PSL. It smacks of corruption.

&quot;We are going to check the morality of what they [Absa and PSL] are doing.

&quot;We are going to check their activities if they are in line with corporate governance. We must stop this kind of thing. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely,&quot; he said.

5.3 Activists want bed-cut facts

Di Caelers, Cape Argus, 3 October 2007

The activists leading the imminent court battle to prevent bed closures at Groote Schuur Hospital wrote to the hospital's boss, Dr Saadiq Kariem, on Wednesday demanding that he spell out exactly which beds will be cut and from where.

They have given Kariem, Groote Schuur's chief operational officer, one week to respond, after which they intend seeking an interim court order to halt the process.

This, explained the Treatment Action Campaign's Andrew Warlick, would be a move to give them more time to prepare a full-blown case against the provincial health department. They intended to file related papers by the end of September, he said.

Last week the Cape Argus reported that the provincial government would face a united front of activists and unions when the issue reached the Cape High Court.

Also involved are the National Education, Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu), the Aids Law Project, Cosatu, the People's Health Movement, the SA Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu), the Groote Schuur Crisis Committee and the Alternative Information and Development Centre.

At issue is the closure of 60 beds at Groote Schuur and 30 at Tygerberg Hospital, a cost cutting initiative by the provincial health authorities which has stirred up anger among the public and the medical staff at the hospitals.

Also in September, the Cape Argus published details of where beds would be cut at Groote Schuur, according to a memorandum from Kariem to staff at the hospital.

But Warlick said they had been forced to write to Kariem to demand clarity due to conflicting reports from staff at Groote Schuur.

&quot;We have given him a week to respond with an explicit outline of what the plans are, including how many beds will be lost, in which wards, which services will be potentially affected and what plans they have made to ensure services aren't interrupted,&quot; he said.

In the meantime, they have set up a series of meetings with people on the ground, health workers and health economists.

These are &quot;in order to make sense of how these cuts have come about, and on what basis they decided which beds should be closed&quot;.

They would launch an interim High Court application &quot;as soon as possible&quot; to halt the cuts, in all likelihood resting on constitutional grounds.

&quot;But we have to get all our facts together because, for such an urgent application to succeed, we must show that this is a life or death issue.

&quot;But our feeling on the bed cuts is that (the authorities) have not really thought this through properly,&quot; Warlick said.

What they wanted was to see the cuts halted and reversed &quot;for a period of time until we are in a position to come to court to settle this matter&quot;.

They expected to file papers for the court action proper by the end of October, he said.

In his original memorandum to staff on the bed cuts at Groote Schuur, Kariem said the closures would result in financial savings that would help address over-spending for the hospital this financial year.

5.4 Abortion bill: lobbyists unhappy

Deon de Lange and Sapa, Cape Argus, 3 October 2007

Pressure groups are threatening to take the government to court over a controversial abortion law recently approved by the National Council of Provinces (NCOP).

The Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Amendment Bill which allows children as young as 12 to terminate a pregnancy without the consent of a legal guardian is expected to be signed into law soon by President Thabo Mbeki.

In August 2006 the bill's original adoption by the NCOP was declared invalid by the Constitutional Court after Doctors for Life International successfully challenged it.

The court found that insufficient public participation had taken place before the bill was approved.

The court said the bill had generated great public interest, but &quot;neither the NCOP nor a majority of the provinces&quot; had held public hearings on it.

The order of invalidity was suspended for 18 months, giving the legislatures time to remedy the omission.

Public hearings have since been held across the country, but critics argue that the bill does not take complaints and criticisms raised during these hearings into account.

Several provincial reports show some communities are vehemently opposed to aspects of the bill, among them its failure to provide for health practitioners to refuse to perform abortions on moral or religious grounds.

Also, the bill provides for trained nurses and registered midwives to perform abortions, although the nurses union, Denosa, opposes this.

Opponents of the bill also argue that it provides scant guidance on the type of counselling girls and women should be given before and after a pregnancy is terminated. Many more are opposed to the idea that a 12-year-old could make an &quot;informed&quot; choice.

Doctors for Life International was looking into the possibility of challenging the new bill as it had come to light that the Mpumalanga legislature had not followed the correct procedure in mandating the province's NCOP members to support the bill, said Martus de Wet, of the organisation's legal department.

According to the DA's provincial leader, Anthony Benadie - who serves on the provincial health portfolio committee - the bill was not referred to a full sitting of the legislature.

&quot;Accordingly, the Speaker conferred a mandate on the province's NCOP delegates that was not authorised by a full sitting of the house.&quot;

De Wet said that, this time round, the bill could be challenged on procedural and substantive grounds.

&quot;The constitution emphasises the need for a 'participatory democracy' as apposed to a 'representative democracy',&quot; he said.

&quot;Simply going through the motions of holding public hearings is not enough. To what extent were the views raised at these hearings taken into account? Which, if any, of these concerns were incorporated into the bill?&quot;

Benadie points out that there is little the Mpumalanga legislature can do to correct the procedural error, since the NCOP has approved the bill.

The legislature may resolve to authorise a mandate retroactively.

South Africa and Tunisia are the only two African countries that offer abortion on request.

The number of women under the age of 18 who had abortions at state medical facilities increased from 4 423 in 2001 to 9 895 last year, Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang has said. The number of women over 18 who had abortions increased from 32 679 to 71 856.

6.2 Being in charge is such a nice job - no wonder presidents are seeking to rule for ever
Marcel Berlins, The Guardian, 3 October 2007
In Argentina, they do things differently. Later this month, the president will be succeeded, almost certainly, by his wife

The trouble with all those pesky constitutions that forbid presidents to stand for a third term of office is that the incumbents don't want to go. After all, they argue, they are only just getting into their stride.

Their first two terms were spent in originating brilliant policies calculated to flower and flourish under their continued leadership, but bound to fail or be ruined under the rule of their hapless successors. Unless, that is, they can find a way of still running the country in some other guise.

Russia's Vladimir Putin and South Africa's Thabo Mbeki have been giving the matter much thought. President Putin discovered that there was nothing to stop him becoming his country's prime minister in future. What was then needed was that the new Russian president would not be a strong figure with ideas of his own. But how to achieve this? Putin had an idea: why don't I pick my successor myself? And so it shall be.

Mbeki will have a much harder time of it. His wheeze, when he ends his stint as South Africa's president in 2009, is to be the president of the ruling party, the African National Congress, and, following Putin's example, exercise power through a malleable new national president, preferably one of his own choosing (he hoped his successor would be a woman, he has said).

Alas, he had not reckoned with the popularity of Jacob Zuma, in spite of his involvement with a dodgy fraudster and a rape trial that resulted in his acquittal, but left him with a sullied reputation - or so it seemed. But two weeks ago, the influential Congress of South African Trade Unions became the latest body to plump for Zuma as the next head of the ANC (the election is in December) and argue that the ANC president should also become the president of South Africa in 2009, which would rule Mbeki out. His dream, unlike Putin's, is nearing its end.

In Argentina, they do things differently, and with more panache. Later this month, Nestor Kirchner ceases to be president of Argentina - to be succeeded, almost certainly, by his wife Cristina. He didn't have to go. He could have served another term, but decided instead to designate his wife, herself a senator, to fight the elections on October 28. She is an experienced and respected politician in her own right, but no one doubts the influence her ex- president husband will exercise. (At least he'll be alive. Juan Perón, it can be argued, ruled Argentina from his grave, through his third wife Isabella, who took over the presidency when he died without bothering to get a public mandate.)

It may even be possible for a former US president, his two terms completed, to regain power - and I'm not just talking about Bill Clinton's private influence over Hillary. It may be constitutionally valid - expert legal opinion is divided - for an ex-president to become a vice-president. In theory, Clinton or George Bush could re-emerge as a shadowy Cheney-type figure running the country. How grateful we should be that our head of state is a monarch with no time limit.

6.2 From Iraq to Burma, Hypocrisy Rules the West

Paul Craig Roberts, Counterpunch, 1 October 2007

Shame has vanished from Western &quot;civilization.&quot; Hypocrisy has taken its place.

On September 28, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown could be heard on [US] National Public Radio decrying the use of violence against democratic protesters by the government in Burma. Brown declared the British people's revulsion over the violence inflicted by the Burmese government on its people. But Brown said nothing about the violence the British government was inflicting on Iraqis and Afghans.

George W. Bush also struck the blameless pose when he declared: &quot;The world is watching the people of Burma take to the streets to demand their freedom, and the American people stand in solidarity with these brave individuals.&quot;

Bush and Brown do not have the same sympathy for the peoples of Iraq and Afghanistan. Neither Bush nor Brown stand in solidarity with those who are demanding their freedom from foreign occupation by American and British troops. Indeed, Bush and Brown, as commanders in chief, are on a killing spree that makes the government in Burma look extremely restrained by comparison.

Why were British soldiers sent to kill Iraqis and Afghans? September 11 had nothing whatsoever to do with the UK. No doubt but that the corrupt Tony Blair was paid off to drag the British people into Bush's Middle East war for American/Israeli hegemony, but Brown has done nothing to terminate Bush's use of the British military as mercenaries.

The NPR announcers also supported the Burmese people, but they, too, show little disturbance over Bush's five-year old wars that we now know were based entirely on lies. Al Qaeda is not the Taliban, and Iraq had no WMD. Neither country was a threat to the US. Now that we know this, why does the media still give Bush and Brown a free pass to use violence against Iraqis and Afghans?

To cut to the chase, what is the difference between Bush and Brown on one hand and the murderous Burmese government on the other? Bush and Brown are actually worse. They pretend to be democrats concerned with what people actually want. The Burmese government doesn't pretend to be anything but a military dictatorship. Moreover, the Burmese government is clean by comparison as it hasn't committed acts of naked aggression--war crimes under the Nuremberg standard--by invading other countries and attempting to occupy them.

Despite all the killing Bush has accomplished, he thirsts for yet more blood. Iran is in his and Israel's sights. All indications are that Bush is going to attack Iran. Propaganda, demonizations, and crass lies are pouring out of the Bush regime and its media and academic propagandists such as Columbia University president Lee Bollinger. Both parties in Congress have lined up behind the coming attack on Iran. The despicable senator Joe Lieberman even snuck language into a bill to give Bush the go ahead.

Who is going to stop Bush from a third war crime? Not his vice president, Not his national security adviser, not his secretary of defense. Not his secretary of state. Not Congress. Not the US military. Not the corporate fat cats. Not the Israel Lobby. Not the bought and paid for &quot;allies.&quot; Not the anti-war movement. Not the American people. Certainly not the media.

Americans are content with whatever crimes their government commits as long as the justification is Americans' safety.

Americans' willingness to murder others out of fear for their own safety is a result of September 11. The antiwar movement is impotent, because it has accepted the government's 9/11 story. To oppose a war when you accept the government's reason for the war is an indefensible position.

The Bush regime knows that if people will believe its 9/11 story, they will believe anything. Propaganda silences facts, and Americans fall for one set of falsehoods after another. The alleged 9/11 hijackers all came from countries allied with the US, principally Saudi Arabia, but Americans believe the government's lies that Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and Syria are responsible. Americans have been convinced that without &quot;regime change&quot; in these countries, the American superpower will remain helpless in face of stateless Muslims armed with box cutters.

Americans have been brainwashed to believe that Muslims hate us for our &quot;freedom and democracy,&quot; whereas in fact the problem is the US government's immoral foreign policy and interference in the internal affairs of Muslim countries. Bush's message to the Middle East is clear: Be a puppet state or be destroyed.

In the meantime, to prevent democracy and civil liberties from getting in the way of making Americans safe, Bush has set aside habeas corpus, due process, right to legal representation, privacy, and the separation of powers mandated by the US Constitution. Otherwise, Bush says, we will lose the &quot;war on terror.&quot;

Bush says he has made Americans safe by ridding them of these constitutional impediments to their safety. And once American bombs fall on Iran and Syria, those countries will be free and democratic, too, like Iraq and Afghanistan.

In leading Americans to this conclusion, Bush has sunk the United States to a new low in human intelligence and morality.
