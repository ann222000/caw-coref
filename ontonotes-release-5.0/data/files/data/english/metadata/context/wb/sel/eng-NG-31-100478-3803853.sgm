Can anyone shed any light on the following?

My location on the sat nav map display when parked is correct. As soon as
I start driving the arrow (depicting my car and which way it's pointing)
spins round and goes off in a crazy direction.

Amusing, but also annoying...

Any help most appreciated. Thanks in advance.
