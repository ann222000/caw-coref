Daily Reflections

A PATH TO FAITH

True humility and an open mind can lead us to faith, and every A.A.
meeting is an
assurance that God will restore us to sanity if we rightly relate
ourselves to Him.
TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 33

My last drunk had landed me in the hospital, totally broken. It was then
that I was able
to see my past float in front of me. I realized that, through drinking,
I had lived every
nightmare I had ever had. My own self-will and obsession to drink had
driven me into a
dark pit of hallucinations, blackouts and despair. Finally beaten, I
asked for God's help.
His presence told me to believe. My obsession for alcohol was taken away
and my
paranoia has since been lifted. I am no longer afraid. I know my life is
healthy and sane.

Twenty-Four Hours A Day

A.A. Thought For The Day

A night club crowded with men and women all dressed up in evening
clothes looks like a
very festive place. But you should see the rest rooms of that night club
the next morning.
What a mess! People have been sick all over the place and does it smell!
The glamour of
the night before is all gone and only the stink of the morning after is
left. In A.A. we learn
to take a long view of drinking instead of a short view. We learn to
think less about the
pleasure of the moment and more about the consequences. Has the night
before become
less important to me and the morning after more important?

Meditation For The Day

Only a few more steps and then God's power shall be seen and known in my
life. I am now
walking in darkness, surrounded by the limitations of space and time.
But even in this
darkness, I can have faith and can be a light to guide feet that are
afraid. I believe that
God's power will break through the darkness and my prayers will pierce
even to the ears
of God Himself. But only a cry from the heart, a trusting cry, ever
pierces that darkness
and reaches to the divine ear of God.

Prayer For The Day

I pray that the divine power of God will help my human weakness. I pray
that my prayer
may reach through the darkness to the ear of God.

As Bill Sees It

Let Go Absolutely, p.242

After failure on my part to dry up any drunks, Dr. Silkworth
reminded me of Professor William James's observation that truly
transforming spiritual experiences are nearly always founded on
calamity and collapse. &quot;Stop preaching at them,&quot; Dr. Silkworth
said, &quot;and give them the hard medical facts first. This may soften
them up at depth so that they will be willing to do anything to get
well. Then they may accept those spiritual ideas of yours, and
even a Higher Power.&quot;

********************************

We beg of you to be fearless and thorough from the very start. Some
of us have tried to hold on to our old ideas, and the result was
nil--until we let go absolutely.

Walk In Dry Places

*** **Responsibility for our actions.
Maturity
The practice of scape-goating goes way back to biblical times. It's
easier to blame others for our problems than to take personal
responsibility for facing and solving these problems.
In the AA program, however, there's nothing that serves as a basis for
blaming others. In every way, AA insists that alcoholics take personal
responsibility... not only for finding and maintaining sobriety, but
also for past wrongs and personal shortcomings. This is a difficult
change for alcoholics who have believed that others caused many of their
problems.
But being forced to take responsibility for our actions is a blessing in
disguise. It fairly shouts the good news that we can take charge of our
lives despite what others think and do. With God's help, we can change
ourselves into the people we ought to be.  We are fortunate that life is
arranged to give us this personal responsibility.. where would we be if
our recovery depended only on others?
We also learn that this responsibility is not limited to our drinking.
We are responsible for everything we think and do, and we have the power
to make improvements in our lives beginning today.
I will go through the day without blaming others for my problems.*

Keep It Simple

* I thank God for my handicaps, for through them, I have found myself,
my work and my God.---Helen Keller.
None of us ever wanted to be addicts. It's not what we would choose to
be--- just as no one would choose to blind and deaf. Helen Keller, who
was blind and deaf, told of how her problems became her biggest gift.
Through them, she found true meaning in her life. We can accept our
handicap---our addiction--- and learn from it. The truth is, we're all
handicapped in some way. Recovery is about facing our addiction and
learning to live with it. When we see we can't do things alone, we see
the need for a Higher Power.
Prayer for the Day:  Higher Power, help me see myself as I really am.
Give me the serenity that comes from accepting my handicaps.
Action for the Day:  Today, I'll list all the ways I am handicapped.
I'll ask myself, &quot;What gift does each of these hold for me?&quot;**

**Alcoholics Anonymous - Fourth Edition

GUTTER BRAVADO - Alone and unemployable, he was given two options by the
court, get help or go to jail, and his journey toward teachability began.

However, there was one man on the staff who seemed different.  He seemed
different.  He seemed very comfortable and at ease with a bit of a
knowing sparkle in his eyes.  This guy was clearly not as stuffy as the
rest, and when he told me his story, I was surprised to find it very
similar to mine--only his was no secret.  He mentioned being a member of
Alcoholics Anonymous.  How could it be that he obviously had the respect
of the staff after having lived a life of crime? How could it be that he
was a lot like me but had made it back?  Here was someone who was sober,
yet cool; humble. yet firm in his convictions; serious, but not without
a sense of humor.  This was one to whom I could relate and maybe even
trust.  He may have saved my life just by being there, and to this day
he doesn't even know it.

Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions

Step Four - &quot;Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.&quot;

Some will object to many of the questions posed, because they think
their own character defects have not been so glaring. To these it can be
suggested that a conscientious examination is likely to reveal the very
defects the objectionable questions are concerned with. Because our
surface record hasn't looked too bad, we have frequently been abashed to
find that this is so simply because we have buried these self same
defects deep down in us under thick layers of self-justification.
Whatever the defects, they have finally ambushed us into alcoholism and
misery.

pp. 53-54

***********************************************************

God, the Master Artist, sees the whole picture and desires to make
something delightful of us.  --Gene L. Lankford

The joy is in the journey.

Life didn't end when I got sober -- it started.

Situations I fear are rarely as bad as the fear itself.

If faith without works is dead, then willingness without action is fantasy.

Resentment is like acid, eating away at the vessel it is stored in.

Walk softly and carry a Big Book.

Father Leo's Daily Meditation

CHILDLIKE

&quot;In every child who is born, under
no matter what circumstances,
and of no matter what parents, the
potentiality of the human race is
born again.&quot;
-- James Agee

Today I am able to believe and see the God-given dignity of the human
race in
the faces and lifestyles of others. In the challenge and rebelliousness
of youth is
the hope for tomorrow.

Today I can associate myself with the need to question, risk and &quot;be
outrageous&quot;. Today I can play, laugh at myself and own my craziness.
Today I do
not need to be perfect.

When I used drugs, I was so judgmental, serious and controlling.
Everything had
to have a place, or an answer, or be acceptable to others. My moments of
guilt
were caused by my inability to please others.

Today I can be childlike and identify with the radical message for
tomorrow: &quot;to
thine own self be true!&quot;

I see a child looking at the stars and I smile; I am that child.

***********************************************************

O sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Sing to
the Lord, bless his name; tell of his salvation from day to day. Declare
his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.
For great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; he is to be revered
above all gods.
Psalm 96:1-4

I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at last you have revived your
concern for me; indeed, you were concerned for me, but had no
opportunity to show it. Not that I am referring to being in need; for I
have learned to be content with whatever I have. I know what it is to
have little, and I know what it is to have plenty. In any and all
circumstances I have learned the secret of being well-fed and of going
hungry, of having plenty and of being in need. I can do all things
through him who strengthens me.  Phillipians 4:10-13

&quot;Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
will be filled.  Matthew 5:6

Daily Inspiration

There is no moment like right now. Lord, help me start one thing today
that I have been putting off.

Spend less time trying to change and more time making the best of who
you are. Lord, help me daily to put Your words into action.

*Ask and you shall receive,*
*Seek and ye shall find, *
* Knock and it shall be opened unto you. *
* Matthew 7:7
