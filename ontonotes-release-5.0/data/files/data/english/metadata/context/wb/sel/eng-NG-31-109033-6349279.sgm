Europe before WW2 imported food. With the start of WW2, the British
stopped food imports to the region, except from Russia, but once Hitler
attacked Russia this soon stop too. In NAZI dominated Europe food
shortages were common and rationing, even in Germany, was strict. Some
of these shortages were NAZI policy like in the concentration camps and
Poland, however overall food shortages did exist. Does anyone have
figures for food consumption and production and was the problem
production or distribution?

Self-sufficiency in food is a peculiarly American notion. European countries
have imported food in bulk since the 18th century; mutual trade was and is
an important part of the European economy.

Some European nations were net food exporters - France, Denmark, Holland,
Italy, Spain, Russia - others net importers - Britain, Germany, Belgium, the
Scandinavian countries.

In 1939, Britain managed to cut off some imports from Germany, but lack of
foreign exchange due to Nazi Germany's neglect of a trading economy had done
more. Denmark brimmed with dairy products in 1939-40, but Germany couldn't
afford to buy them. Barter of manufactured goods and credit only went so
far.

Germany's food import problems only really ended in 1940 when major
food-producing regions came under German rule and could be systematically
stripped for German benefit.

As Germans occupied various countries they diverted a lot of their food
production to Germany. While Danes had a history of close relations with
Germany, Danish attitude toward the occupiers went downhill as they saw
their food being sent to Germany.  The RN and the Allied air forces
pounded coastal shipping, sinking ships with food and other materials.
Toward the end of the war the Dutch were literally starving. Things got
so bad that the Germans agreed to a temporary cease fire so that RAF
planes could drop emergency relief supplies before the disaster got any
worse.

The global picture of food supply and consumption
can probably be found in early documents of the
postwar World Health Organization.  There was by
1946 quite a large corps of professional nutritionists
and public health physicians as well as statisticians
specializing in food supply and demand.  Most of what
is in print is probably organized by country, cf. the 14-
year history of food rationing in Britain -- where the main
demographic change observed was that public health
improved under rationing.  This presumably means that
the poor ate better under rationing than during the 1930s.
After the war conditions varied hugely between countries,
e.g. Britain, France and Germany (where rationing was
controlled by Occupation Zone authorities i.e. non-
uniformly.)

The starvation and mass deaths in Holland in the winter of 1944-5 was
entirely due to the illegal German refusal to allow civilian power
generation or movement of goods and supplies within the occupied part of
Holland, as a reprisal for a railway strike.

Allied food relief was sent by air and road after 21 Army Group threatened
the German administrators with being hanged post-war for war crimes.

The rail strike did not occur until the Market Garden landings near
Arnhem, and the Germans dealt harshly with the people responsible for
that, not that it was unlike the Germans to take reprisal against the
innocent.  They had started stripping Dutch factories of everything
useful looting farms of their feed and animals a month before. They took
river barges, railway rolling stock, locomotives, just about everything
they could take.  The Germans had little enough food for themselves, and
they took everything they could. In order to hinder Allied advances by
land they flooded vast areas of the lowlands.

I have heard and read of several accounts of the food drop but never
heard anything about Germans downing any of the planes.  FWIW, an
account from one of the participants from RAAF 460 Sqd. indicates that
the Australian crews were wary of the German promise not to fire on them
but were pleased to see that they had kept their word. An account from
an airman in 625 Sqd. RAF indicates that they heard that one of their
Lancasters had a few bullet holes from ground fire, but he reported no
losss.

http://users.tpg.com.au/adsls7ld/manna460.html

One of the most detailed accounts is from an airman on one of the crews
that did a test run  before the formal agreement. They had to fly down a
narrow corridor. They saw AA guns aimed at them and tanks with their
main guns aimed upward. None of them fired but when they got back to
base they did se bullet holes in one of the planes.

http://users.interstroom.nl/~heijink/manna2.html

An article in Legion magazine reports that despite the truce a few of
the Lancasters and B-17s had a few bullet holes. it reports only one
plane lost, apparently hit by ground fire near Ijmuiden. It caught fire
halfway back to England and crashed in the North Sea, killing all but
two of the crew.

This is far too broad, Britain certainly did not stop imports of food to
Europe in 1939, they did blockade Germany's sealanes.  Even during
the war neutral countries could import food and other items, the British
set up agreements to ensure only what that country needed was allowed
through, so no excess would make it to German control, in theory anyway.

France was importing food from North Africa during 1942 for example.

The overall problem was a mixture of production and distribution.  The
amount of food being produced was very close to needs and the Nazis
took a lot of food from the rest of Europe to Germany, resulting in
shortages.
In effect they did not distribute the food evenly.  The US Army noted in
1944 local French workers were suffering from the effects of malnutrition.

In 1945 the US Army in Europe enforced a 10% cut in rations to the soldiers
because of the food situation.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the series, Germany and the second world war,
">

German crop production
as a percentage of pre war, in 1944, grain 82%, potatoes
80% sugar-beet 100% (1943 92%, 75%, 117%), food
imports of bread cereals had climbed from 1.2 million tons
in 1938/39 to 3.5 million tons in 1943/4.

Pre war the average German caloric allocation was 3000
calories.  This had dropped to 2078 calories in the 1942/3
(ration periods 41-53), then 1981 calories 1943/4 (ration
periods 54-66), then 1671 calories 1944/5 (ration periods
67-79) then 1412 calories 1945/6 (ration periods 80-92).
I understand ration periods are for 4 weeks (13 to a year)
starting in September 1939.  Which makes ration period
67 October 1944.

Post war,

Food in Denmark was good, Norway, once they stopped
the 100% of the fish catch going to Germany (and coped
with the subsequent malnutrition) was acceptable, they
could use German Army stocks as well, but still needed
some 66,000 tons of food, Holland had people starving to
death, France wanted 1,000,000 tons of food and edible
fats in the first 8 months of 1945, even in the south of
Italy food production had not recovered, there was famine
in Indo China and drought in Australia and India.  The
Commander of the British sector in Germany requested
around 2,000,000 tons of wheat, which was most of the
1945 British crop.

Publisher: London : H.M.S.O. and Longmans Green, 1955.
Description: ix, 494 p., [24] p. of plates (10 folded) :

See chapter XVI, "The shortage of shipping a stranglehold
on essential civilian services" (March 1943).

It covers things like the way the Turks needed 50,000 tons
of wheat but the Egyptians would not sell unless they had
guarantees of fertiliser deliveries so they would not
experience a shortage.  Or that the 8th army advance in
1942 upped the Egyptian railway's coal requirements
from 14,000 tons per month to 30,000 tons, plus the fuel
requirements of the supply ships.

South Africa needed its fertilisers, as did Australia, the
shortages produced inflation and encouraged hoarding,
there were fewer ships.

In February 1943 in Ceylon the rubber workers were leaving
the plantations in search of food.  For Southern Rhodesia,
Mauritius and Seychelles "famine, though not an immediate
threat, might, it seems, easily become so."

And so on.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the 1950 Canada Yearbook,

"Wheat - The crop year 1948-49 brought about for the first time in
several years a near balance between world what supplies and
import requirements.  Generally excellent crops were harvested in
1948 with world production of both bread grains and coarse grains
reaching considerably higher levels than in 1947.  Production also
exceeded the 1935-39 average by a considerable margin with
improved crops being harvested quite generally in both importing
and exporting countries.  With this easing of previously existing
tight supply situation, governments of some wheat importing
countries abolished bread rationing while others lowered the
compulsory extraction rate in flour milling and considerably
reduced the amounts of coarse grains which were formally mixed
with bread grains in the manufacture of flour.  These two actions
provided larger quantities of milling offals and coarse grains for
live-stock feed, and so promoted the expansion of live-stock
production.  The optimism generated by increased available
supplies led to the dissolution of the world allocating agency, the
international food council of the Food and Agricultural Organisation."

more common then the actual occurance. OTOH, not many of the landed
rich lost their estates and went bust during the war. OTOH, they had
to, in many instances, abandon their pleasures, especially the
pleasures of table and cellar and humidor for the duration. They, like
most everyone else, had to do more walking then heretofore. They were
eating "better" in their own way, just as the guy on the other end of

then he could get otherwise was eating "better".

I rather thought there would be a how bad it was for the Germans
reply, without any context.

In March 1946 German food stocks were at 60 days, rations were
cut to 1,180 calories a day and by May and June Army foods were
being used.  The final crisis would be in the second quarter of 1947.

Also in April 1946 Argentina took measures to stop hoarding
of wheat, Argentina being a major exporter at the time.

Germany's wheat imports in the 1946/47 period were 4 times
that of pre war, in 1947/48 over 6 times pre war levels.

Put it another way pre war Germany took around 4% of the
world's imports of wheat, in 1946/47 it was 11%.  World
imports had increased by 232,000,000 bushels, and German
imports had increased by 60,000,000 bushels.

Pre war in South East Asia Burma exported around 3 million tons
of rice, Indo China and Thailand around 1.5 million tons each out
of a total production of around 14.4 million tons.  In 1945/6 Burma
could just supply enough rice for its own population and overall
production in South East Asia was 2/3 that of pre war.  In 1946/7
production was around 75% of pre war, in 1947/8 it was back to
around the pre war level.  Malaya needed 700,000 tons of rice a
year pre war, it received 94,000 tons in 1944 and 12,000 tons in
1945, rice went from $6 to $7,500 between December 1941 and
August 1945.

In Java Japanese economic management dropped the area under
crops from 8 million hectares in 1940 to 5.8 million in 1945 with
yields per hectare down maybe 20 to 30% from pre war.

See Food Supplies and the Japanese Occupation in South East Asia.

Burma was the world's biggest rice exporter but by 1945 the
fighting threatened the population with starvation.

Burma was the world's biggest rice exporter but by 1945 the
fighting threatened the population with starvation.

Japan tried to make each province, not country, it occupied
self sufficient, to reduce transport needs.  Effectively totally
disrupting trade, so areas with excess food cut back
production but could not obtain, say, cooking oil, areas
without sufficient food production were in trouble.

Then there was the demand to sell a fixed percentage of
each crop to the Japanese at a low price, bad enough
for those with surpluses, worse for those without.  Japan
neglected pest control (including mosquitoes) and irrigation
systems which did not help rice production.

A crash program to build wooden hulled ships in Java
used unseasoned wood, which warped of course, thereby
leaving only about 10% of the ships built usable.  About
1,200 small craft had been lost in Malaya and Sumatra
during the opening of the war.

Thailand built up a 1,000,000 or so ton rice reserve (the
Thais ran the economy, the Japanese the transport), which
really helped post war.  The British wrote into the peace
agreement with Thailand the requirement for the Thais to
deliver 1,500,000 tons of rice at cheap prices (given the
prices then being charged).

The fighting, even in France, had its effect on food production,
According to Allied Administration of Italy 1943-45 by C R S
Harris, between July 1943 and September 1945 the allies
imported 2,464,100 tons of food for Italy, plus 3,291,200
tons of coal, in partial return the Italians exported around
2,000,000 pounds sterling of food, about half lemons or
lemon oil.  During this period the allied armies bought about
300,000 tons of food from the Italians.  A lack of transport
prevented full gathering of the harvest in 1943 and 1944
and distribution of seed in 1945.

Like the rest of Europe the country was awash with weapons,
and revenge attacks included breaking into prisons to kill
the prisoners.

The next figures are from Civil affairs and Military Government
in North West Europe by F S V Donnison.

By the end of 1944 France was running out of food, and
put down a requirement of 1,000,000 tons of foods and fats
over the next 8 months for the civilian population, along with
2,500,000 tons of coal and 800,000 tons of petroleum products.

Belgium was assessed as needing 80,000 tons of food a
month in early 1945, the situation was in Q1/44 the ration
was 1470 calories (versus 2,000 in Germany), it dropped
to 1,200 calories during 1944, in Q4/44, after liberation
the ration was 1450 calories if coupons were honoured,
and they were often not.  By June 1945 the ration was
2,000 calories.

Holland, outside of German occupation followed Belgian
rations.  Under German occupation the Dutch starved,
and the situation became so bad a truce was organised
so food could be trucked in and air dropped, even so
many died.

Norway, by raiding German Army stocks only needed
around 66,000 tons of food in the first 6 months of
liberation.

Denmark was a food exporter, once the allies could remove
the German army and put a clamp on weapons, provided
it could receive enough coal.

Food priorities were to Allied military personnel, released
Allied POW (who were quickly moved out of Germany
anyway), England, France, the rest of formerly occupied
Europe, Italy, Displaced Persons, German civilians, and
German military  personnel -- in that order.

Coal was needed almost as much as food, as it helped food
production and distribution.  For example the need for coal
for Denmark.  After 6 years of neglect the British coal mines
in 1945 were down to 182,773,000 tons produced compared
with 231,338,000 tons in 1939, this is after drafting men into
the mines instead of the infantry.

The effects of the Nazi food policy can be noted by the way in
1945 France the average 14 year old was 7 to 9 Kg and 7 to
11 cm shorter than their 1935 counterparts.  France's population
had declined by over 1 million after war casualties of around
600,000 dead, that is a decline of around 2.5%.

There was a severe 1944/45 winter and disastrous frosts, French
1945 grain production was 50% of pre war, down 1/3 on even 1944
the 1946 harvests produced a "precarious balance".

The winter of 1946/7 produced record low temperatures in Europe,
and lingered until April and was followed by widespread drought.
Shortages of bread and refined sugar lead to riots in Verdun and
Le Mans in September 1947.  The US population started purchasing
food parcels to send to Europe.

The bad 1946/7 winter reduced the French rail system to a worse
state than in wartime.

I just have finished Adam Tooze book "The wages of Destuction" where he
talks of the the hunger plan.

A similar argument can be found in

Which I would like to quote
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
II. The =3FHunger Strategy=3F of 1941-42

In spring 1941 the Reich Food Ministry and the Armed Forces High
Command (OKW) developed what Rolf-Dieter Müller has termed a =3Fhunger
strategy=3F devised to deprive millions of Soviet citizens of food in
order to provide surpluses which would feed the German army in Russia as
well as allow foodstuffs to be sent back to the Reich from the occupied
territories in the East. This hunger strategy, as Müller has
convincingly demonstrated, was not an unintended or unavoidable outcome
of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union but was deliberately planned in
advance and must be regarded as a =3Fconsciously implemented policy of
extermination.=3F
Plans for the economic exploitation of the occupied territories
had been considered in some detail by German civilian and military
experts in advance of the invasion. A statement of goals for the
upcoming campaign from early May 1941 succinctly noted: =3F1. The war can
only be continued if all armed forces are fed by Russia in the third
year of war. 2. There is no doubt that as a result many millions of
people will be starved to death if we take out of the country the things
necessary for us.=3F A much more detailed document prepared by the
=3FEconomic Staff East, Agricultural Group=3F on 23 May 1941, painted an
even grimmer picture of the mass starvation and deindustrialization
planned for some Soviet regions. The planners commented dispassionately
that =3Fthe population of these areas, in particular the urban population,
will have to face most serious distress from famine.=3F The document went
on to state with brutal frankness that the policy being enunciated would
result in mass death for the population of the occupied regions:

It follows from all that has been said that the German administration in
these territories may well attempt to mitigate the consequences of the
famine which undoubtedly will take place, and to accelerate the return
to primitive agricultural conditions. An attempt might be made to
intensify cultivation in these areas by expanding the acreage under
potatoes or other important food crops giving a high yield. However,
these measures will not avert famine. Many tens of millions of people in
this area will become redundant and will either die or have to emigrate
to Siberia. Any attempt to save the population there from death by
starvation by importing surpluses from the black soil zone would be at
the expense of supplies to Europe. It would reduce Germany=3Fs and
Europe=3Fs power to resist the blockade. This must be clearly and
absolutely understood.

Within the context of the racial ideology of Nazism, which posited the
supremacy of the Ayran master race over the inferior Slavs and Jews, the
murder of =3Fmany tens of millions of people=3F by means of deliberate
starvation was accepted as perfectly legitimate and indeed desirable.
The utter disregard of humane values by the German planners provides
very striking evidence of what Hans Mommsen has referred to as the
=3Fdeformation of public and private morality=3F during the Third Reich. The
hunger strategy which the economic experts in the Wehrmacht and the
state ministries formulated was a clear violation of international law
which required that occupying forces insure an adequate food supply for
the indigenous population. The economic planners cynically choose to
ignore their obligations under international law and endorsed a policy
guaranteed to condemn millions to starvation. In comments made on the
eve of the invasion of the Soviet Union, Alfred Rosenberg explicitly
rejected the notion that Germany had any obligation toward the peoples
it was about to subjugate; German interests alone were paramount: =3Fthe
job of feeding the German people stands, this year, without a doubt, at
the top of the list of Germany=3Fs claims on the East=3FWe see absolutely no
reason for any obligation on our part to feed also the Russian people
with the products of that surplus-territory. We know that this is a
harsh necessity, bare of any feelings.=3F
Rosenberg was articulating a view which was shared by all
members of the top Nazi leadership. Three weeks into Operation
Barbarossa Hermann Goering spelled out German priorities when it came to
the distribution of food supplies: =3FIt is clear that a graduated scale
of food allocations is needed. First in line are the combat troops, then
the remainder of the troops in enemy territory, and then those troops
stationed at home. The rates are adjusted accordingly. The supply of the
German non-military population follows and only then comes the
population of the occupied territories.=3F He went on to note, =3FIn the
occupied territories on principle only those people are to be supplied
with an adequate amount of food who work for us. Even if one wanted to
feed all the other inhabitants, one could not do it in the newly-
occupied Eastern areas. It is, therefore, wrong to funnel off food
supplies for this purpose, if it is done at the expense of the army and
necessitates increased supplies from home.=3F The economic welfare and
indeed the survival of the subject populations was to be callously and
criminally disregarded; all that mattered was what benefit Germany could
derive from the occupied territories.         Hitler of course was in
full agreement with a policy of maximum exploitation and minimum concern
for the population of the occupied territories: =3FOur guiding principle
must be that these people have but one justification for existence=3Fto be
of use to us economically. We must concentrate on extracting from these
territories everything that it is possible to extract.=3F It can come as
no surprise that the hunger strategy could count on Hitler=3Fs complete
support. On 8 July 1941 General Franz Halder, Chief of the Army General
Staff, noted that the Führer had indicated that it was his =3Ffirm
decision to level Moscow and Leningrad, and make them uninhabitable, so
as to relieve us of the necessity of having to feed the populations
through the winter.=3F All the evidence amply justifies Theo J. Schulte=3Fs
judgement that =3Fthe economic and military leadership of the Third
Reich=3Fadvocated a radical policy of exploitation that did not merely
allow for but, rather, was based on the need for the extermination of
millions of people.=3F
The hunger strategy had a devastating impact on the Soviet
population in the occupied regions. One of the most remarkable and
brutally frank assessments of the consequences of the strategy was
provided in a report from the Armaments Inspector for the Ukraine, Major
General Hans Leykauf, dated 2 December 1941. Leykauf=3Fs report is
noteworthy for its matter-of-fact acknowledgment of the scale and scope
of mass killing being carried out by German forces in the East:

When we shoot the Jews to death, allow the POWs to die, expose
considerable portions of the urban population to starvation and in the
upcoming year also lose a part of the rural population to hunger, the
question remains to be answered: who is actually supposed to produce
economic values?

Leykauf=3Fs attention, of course, was focused not on the lethal human
consequences of the hunger strategy and the other atrocities committed
against the Soviet population but solely on the effects such a strategy
might have on the productivity of the occupied regions. As he made
clear, his own views were based not on humane =3Fsentiment=3F but on =3Fsober
economic calculations.=3F These calculations undoubtedly informed his
suggestions for a continuation of the hunger strategy:

Scooping off the agricultural surplus in the Ukraine for the purpose of
feeding the Reich is therefore only feasible if traffic in the interior
of the Ukraine is diminished to a minimum. The attempt will be made to
achieve this
1. by annihilation of superfluous eaters (Jews, population of the
Ukrainian big cities, which like Kiev do not receive any supplies at
all);
2. by extreme reduction of the rations allocated to the Ukrainians in
the remaining cities;
3. by decrease of the food of the farming population.

As military reports from 1942 indicate, the German insistence on
the =3Fannihilation of superfluous eaters=3F helped to foster famine
conditions which afflicted large numbers of the Soviet population. A
rear army group reported in May 1942: =3Fthe population is afflicted by
hunger and is therefore under pressure to wander around the countryside
to barter for foodstuffs. The fact that the German Wehrmacht has done
nothing to guarantee the nourishment of the civilian population has
influenced opinion and made the population distrustful towards the
victorious German forces.=3F
The 3.3 million Soviet prisoners of war who fell into the hands
of the Wehrmacht during 1941 were even more disastrously affected than
civilians by the deliberate hunger strategy of the Germans. Christian
Streit has estimated that approximately two million of these Soviet POWs
died or were executed. Streit=3Fs pioneering research into the treatment
of Soviet POWs by the German forces demonstrated that in the run-up to
the invasion of the Soviet Union the German military leadership made
virtually no preparations for dealing with the massive number of
prisoners of war expected to come under German control during Operation
Barbarossa. =3FIn full knowledge of the consequences, the provision of
food for the prisoners was totally subordinated to the goal of
exploiting the food resources of the East in order to raise the rations
of the German population.=3F

If you have read Tooze, then the preceding chapters deal with just

The short answer is no. Europe was a net importer of foodstuffs, and
its prewar situation rested on the possibility to import large amounts
of animal feeds and fuel, i.e. the components of a modern, high-yield
agriculture.

German occupation and British blockade put paid to all that, and
European agricultural output plummeted. So there was indeed a food
problem in early 1941.

The situation is the same today, BTW: Europe is an agricultural

In WW1, Germany controlled much of the same region, under a similar
blockade and yet they never committed such atrocities. No major outbreak
of starvation occurred although there were major food problems towards

I don't agree that this is Tooze's claim.

He writes that mass murders were primarily motivated by Nazi ideology.
The combination of Nazi racial ideology and a difficult food situation
led to the "solution" of acquiring additional food-producing areas
(the Ukraine) and planning to starve 20-30 million "racially inferior"
people so as to manufacture a surplus for use in the rest of Europe.

Tooze doesn't claim that this was the only solution, for instance
Germany could have reduced food rations all around particularly the
highest ones (e.g. Germany's). The Germans did have a food problem,
but the reason why they picked that particular solution was because it
was appealing to them.

It wasn't as bad as it would later become, but the writing was on the
wall. Europe was not producing enough food, and things were going to
get worse because the effects of the lack of food would send
agricultural production spiralling down. Lack of animal feeds mean
slaughter of livestock so in the short term the difference isn't
noticeable but in the following years it will make itself felt. Lack
of fertilizers mean slowly degrading yields, so crops would be poorer
and poorer. Etc.

That's exactly what happened and the situation was terrible by the
mid-1940s as Geoffrey Sinclair showed in another post. The Nazis tried
to react, in their particular way.

During WWI Germany did not control - and therefore did not have to

second year of war.

There is no evidence whatsoever that lack of food had any practical impact

There may well be evidence that food availability had an influence on Heer

circumstances demanded." The author proceeds to show how, in the case
of the Polish farm workers and the later Ostarbeiter program, deaths
resulted from "ideological imperatives" : "It was clear to all
involved that these conditions were counterproductive ... However, the
creation of a racially pure society was a project in which Hitler's

Yes, and that solution was retained because it fitted in so well with
the Nazi world view, and provided a technocratic answer to the
technocrats' (Backe, Sauckel) demand for 'politically-incorrect'

p.542: "a very substantial improvement in [the most disadvantaged

very modest further cut in the food supplied to the German population.

You're attributing to him claims that he didn't make. Just because in
1942 the extermination of Polish Jews was picked - and worked as a way
to alleviate the food situation - doesn't mean that the Nazis "had to"
do it. In my example above, just because I find quite a bit of money
in my victim's purse doesn't mean that I had to do it.

Andrew Clark doesn't need to have read the book to comment on whether
that point is true or not. He would only need to have read the book to
comment on whether that was or wasn't the author's point. He doesn't
do that. He wrote that whether or not Tooze made the point, it was
incorrect.

That's a perfectly legitimate argument.

Certainly, writing "read the book" a half dozen times isn't more
helpful than arguing about the case itself, regardless of whether it
was made in the book.

Incidentally, I don't believe that the attribution of that theory to
Tooze "is substantially correct", I own and have read the book (as my
previous post probably indicates) and find Bernard's way of arguing
far more convincing and helpful than repeated statements along the
lines of "Tooze is correct, he's a university professor and you're
not, read the book, you haven't read the book, read the book, you
haven't read the book, read the book (etc)".

If you want to argue that Tooze "the mass murders of so many people in
Nazi Germany [to the fact that] the Nazis did not have enough food to
feed the population", then feel free to quote chapter and verse. FYI,
Bernard and I quoted from the chapter about 1942, but the Hunger Plan
is also discussed in an earlier chapter about 1941, so there's plenty
of scope for usefully contributing to the discussion.

My understanding is that, even in 1941, the Nazis decided to solve
their food problem with mass starvation out of ideology, not because
they couldn't have done otherwise. Tooze specifically writes that the
Germans went on an ideologically-driven mass-killing spree in the east
in 1941, and only reversed that policy when the reality of Barbarossa
not working started to bite in November &amp; December 1941.

The Nazis cut down on some of their investment projects, due to lack
of steel. They lacked steel because they didn't have enough coal. They
didn't have enough coal because they were short of coal miners. They
were short of coal miners because they drafted that manpower in the
Wehrmacht and were initially reluctant (for ideological reasons) to
employ large numbers of foreign workers rather than kill them.

It was therefore a political choice to keep the Wehrmacht fully
mobilized looking for a K.O. victory over the Soviet Union and to
start "making room" by exterminating "useless mouths" in the East,
rather than, say, demobilize 500,000 workers from the Wehrmacht,
allocate them to coal and steel production so as to gather additional
capacity to build fertilizers and increase agricultural output. This
would also mean less ammunition output in the short term, of course.
The 2 million Soviet POWs that were deliberately killed could have
been used as agricultural workers, since manpower shortages were
another major reason for the declining output of the food-producing
sector everywhere in Europe.

Tooze doesn't suggest that the Germans had no choice but to starve
millions so as to feed themselves. What he argues is that the food
problem was real, and starving millions was how the Germans decided
that they would cope. That's not the same thing.

I'm drawing a distinction between programme like the Final Solution and T4,

Obviously we are going to need context for the readers a few lines will
not do.  The whole paragraph in question states

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Let us remind ourselves: in the first weeks of 1941, the Reich Ministry
of Food and the Wehrmacht military-economic staff had agreed on the
Hunger Plan, a scheme which called for the deliberate starvation of no
less than 30 million inhabitants of the Soviet Union. This explicit
commitment to mass murder was made official policy, months before the SS
began to formulate a concrete and specific plan for the extermination of
the Jewish population of Europe. Food cut across the contradiction
between economics and ideology, between the need for labour and the
imperative for genocide. It provided the Third Reich with a starkly
economic incentive for murder on a scale larger even than the Holocaust.
Furthermore, the problem of food supply was at the heart of the entire
crisis of the foreign labour programme in 1942. It was for want of food
that the Soviet prisoners of war, the concentration camp inmates and the
other Ostarbeiter died in such dreadful numbers even after they were
supposed to be deployed for the purposes of the war effort. It was the
improvement in the food supply to these workers after the autumn of 1942
that was largely responsible for the stabilization of their situation
and the improvement in productivity. It is for more reasons, therefore,
than narrative consistency that we must return to the Hunger Plan, which
bulked so large in previous chapters. When we place it alongside the
ideological impulse for mass murder and the pragmatic needs of the war
economy, many of the contradictions that appear to characterize Nazi
policy, above all in 1942, resolve themselves into a ghastly pattern of
coherence.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Unfortunately Tooze has a habit of jumping around with his date so
leaving the reader a bit confused what dates he is referring too.

However I think the paragraph is clear that in 1941, Tooze claim is that
the Nazi's mass murders of so many people in Nazi Germany was because
the Nazis did not have enough food to feed the population.

"This explicit commitment to mass murder was made official policy,
months before the SS began to formulate a concrete and specific plan for
the extermination of the Jewish population of Europe."

"It was for want of food that the Soviet prisoners of war, the
concentration camp inmates and the other Ostarbeiter died in such
dreadful numbers even after they were supposed to be deployed for the
purposes of the war effort."

Furthermore when food situation in 1942 got better Tooze states here
"It was the improvement in the food supply to these workers after the
autumn of 1942 that was largely responsible for the stabilization of
their situation and the improvement in productivity. "

It works for the T4 program, but not for the Final Solution in
general. For instance, "death through work" operations were both part
of the Final Solution and aimed at forced laborers and the civilian
population of occupied territories.

There were also various aspects to the Final Solution, killing the
Jews was one thing, but eventually the goal was to kill all the
"useless mouths" among those who were deemed racially unfit to live,
i.e. Slavs. Technically these were not part of the Final Solution but
when the food supply of areas in, say, the General Government was
abruptly curtailed so as to squeeze out more exports to the Reich, it
amounted both to an economic measure and to a contribution to the
racial program.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

As you may infer from the exchanges between Bernard and myself, real
life is more complicated than these clear-cut intellectual
distinctions.
There was a clear racial policy that would have taken place regardless
of the food situation, that much is clear. On the other hand, the
difficult food situation made the search of a solution imperative, and
it was definitely a factor in killing millions by starving them off,
since the long-term goal was to replace Slavs with Germanic
populations in any case.

Bernard's case rests on the fact that the Nazis would probably not
have killed all these millions without the historical food situation,
and that is indeed a fact. If, say, the Soviet Union had produced
enough food for its civilian population and the German invaders, there
would have been no need to step up the forced starvation program in
1942 and there would have been less deaths in 1941.

It's even possible to argue that, absent the widespread concern about
food and the equally-widespread instructions disseminated to the
troops that the Reich was fighting for survival and the Slavs had to
be starved so that Germany should live in a survival of the fittest
social-Darwinist replay, atrocities like the deliberate starving of
some 2 million Soviet POWs would not have occurred.

So a case can be made for the food situation as the direct or indirect
source of a lot of the killings.

My point, beyond the fact that the Wehrmacht and other Nazi
organizations would have gone off on a killing spree anyway, is that
the reason why starving millions was even considered in the first
place was the racial worldview in the first place.

Tooze highlights that there was a chicken and egg situation between
the food problem and Nazi policies. Obviously, some Nazi policies were
unaffected like the T4 program but in terms of deaths they pale
compared to the millions starved, worked to death or killed elsewhere.
I believe that this is a case where the chicken laid the egg in the
first place, and I believe that this is also what Tooze argues.

So what?

Just because it predated the SS plan doesn't mean that it wasn't
ideologically-driven. The SS was not twiddling its thumbs in 1941, it
was already busy rounding up and massacring Jews, as well as making
what turned out to be a failed bid to run the war economy through some
"manpower-intensive" practices that would be developed later, though
not under SS supervision.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &quot;It was for want of food that the Soviet prisoners of war, the
&gt; concentration camp inmates and the other Ostarbeiter died in such
&gt; dreadful numbers even after they were supposed to be deployed for the
&gt; purposes of the war effort.&quot;
">

And how is that evidence that food was the primary cause?

As noted in the paragraph that you quote later, food rations could be
improved if necessary, by starving other people. The Nazis decided who
would starve and who wouldn't, and they made that choice out of
ideological imperatives.

There was a deadlock between the ideological program - which called
for genocide - and for the economic program - which called for
manpower mobilization. Both programs could claim support from Hitler,
but they were contradictory, given that the genocide program would
kill people that the economic program wanted to use for the war
effort.
What broke the deadlock was the food situation.

As a result, p.539: "[winter 1941/42] In light of the extension of the
war into the indefinite future, Germany was facing a severe food
problem. (...) When the order to ship large numbers of Eastern workers
to Germany for work was first given by Goering in November 1941, Backe
protested vigorously. The 400,000 Soviet prisoners of war already in
Germany were more than he could provide for. (...) If the Russians
were to be given meat, they would have to be supplied at the expense
of the German population."

So the problem was that the Germans tried to apply the logic of the
Hunger Plan i.e. feed only productive manpower and starve the "useless
mouths" but all Germans were automatically considered more productive
than the most productive of the Eastern workers, and the same more or
less held true of western Europeans. As a result, Germany deliberately
starved millions of people in defense of the racial hierarchy it
upheld.
There is no doubt that people would have experience severe problems
with food, as had been the case in WWI. But WWII Germany had resolved
to avoid a repeat of that situation, and it achieved that by
deliberately starving millions so as to keep a relatively correct
ration for the others. That's where ideology comes in.

The same holds true of the original Hunger Plan. The decision to go
with Barbarossa was taken by Hitler, and Hitler alone. While Tooze
alludes to the economic imperatives underpinning it - and indeed there
is a valid economic and strategic case to be made that to defeat the
Soviet Union was the best strategy for the Reich at that point - there
is little doubt that Hitler did it out of ideological motives. These
ideological motives are also outlined in other works, like the multi-
volume history on Germany in WWII, whereas Tooze focuses primarily on
economic factors (which is only to be expected in an economic
history).

p.459: "On 22 January 1941 Thomas [head of the OKW economic planning
staff] had informed his boss, Keitel, that he was planning to submit a
report urging caution with regard to the military-economic benefits of
the invasion. Now he reversed directions. As it became clear that
Hitler was justifying Barbarossa first and foremost as a campaign of
economic conquest, Thomas began systematically working towards the
Fuehrer."
When Hitler told his advisers that he had been warned of economic
peril prior to the 1940 attack and all had come good in the end, so he
had no intention to be swayed from Barbarossa, people like Thomas
hastened to modify the tone of their reports accordingly and presented
the Ukraine as a breadbasket able to yield millions of tons of surplus
grain for Germany.

See also the following chapter, where the Hunger Plan is outlined. The
title says it all: "The Grand Strategy of Racial War".

Quoting various bits:
p.466 "Meanwhile, the impending attack on the Soviet Union also
energized the broader programme of racila rearrangement that had been
initiated in Poland. In the middle of June 1941 German planning
offices began to consider the possibility of removing, not only the
Polish population of the German annexed territories, but the
population of the General Government as well. They began, in other
words, to consider a genocide against the entire Polish population. On
21 June 1941 Himmler instructed the staff of the RKF to prepare an
outline plan for the demographic reorganization of the entire Eastern
territory that was expected to fall under German control."
See also the preceding page about pre-Barbarossa plans for Jews. So at
a time when it looked like Germany's food problems would be solved,
and the General Government was roughly self-sufficient in food,
extermination was still being planned.

p.467: "The first and most fundamental assumption of all SS
territorial planning from 1939 onwards was the assumption that the
integration of Eastern European territory as German Lebensraum
required the removal of the vast majority of the native population."
This is in the contect of an inter-bureaucratic squabble between the
SS and the RKF about who should be responsible for the "racial
reorganization" (read: genocide) of the non-Jewish populations in the
conquered territories.

Read also about the Hunger Plan p.478: [in December 1940, after the
decision to go ahead with Barbarossa had been given] "As Backe well
understood, however, the Ukraine was not the limitless granary of
imperialist cliche. The Ukraine, in fact, produced only a small net
surplus of grain for export outside the Soviet Union. (...) To
conventional economic analysis in Berlin [the combination of a
primitive agriculture and the need to feed the urban populations
created by Stalinist policies] implied that even if the Ukraine was
successfully conquered, Germany could expect little immediate benefit.
It would, after all, take years before productivity could be
substantially increased. Hebert Backe, however, drew radically
different conclusions. To enable the grain surplus of the Ukraine to
be directed immediately towards German needs, it was necessary simply
to cut the Soviet cities out of the food chain. After ten years of
Stalinist urbanization, the urban population of the western Soviet
Union was now to be starved to death.
That such a scheme should come from the pen of Herbert Backe can come
as no surprise. He was a doctrinaire racial ideologue, a long-time
associate of Walther Darre and a personal friend of Reinhard Heydrich.
As we have seen, he had already demonstrated his willingness to use
food as a means of genocide in Poland in the first year of the war."

If that is Tooze arguing that Germany was forced into the Hunger Plan
by its food situation, he seems to be particularly oblique about it!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Furthermore when food situation in 1942 got better Tooze states here
&gt; &quot;It was the improvement in the food supply to these workers after the
&gt; autumn of 1942 that was largely responsible for the stabilization of

">

Right, so some measure of improvement was possible. It took Hitler to
state in unequivocal terms that feeding the workers in Germany had
priority before the ideologues had to stop hiding behind the food
situation and look for other solutions, i.e. starve someone else.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Again we are talking 1942.

But again, the "scientific" solution of the Hunger Plan was only
retained because it fitted so well with the prevailing ideological
mood. It was not the only solution available.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

But you could make the same argument as in 1941: this was done to
improve German food stocks, and in fact through the murder of over two
million people in Poland Germany managed to secure significant
additional exports from the General Government, whereas it had had to
send emergency food relief in late 1939.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What other strategy does he suggest for the problem in 1941?
">

He doesn't have to suggest anything, because he's not going into
counterfactuals. On the other hand, the Hunger Plan comes at the end
of a couple of chapters on economic mobilization and the all-out drive
to do Barbarossa which will solve everything. Germany could have
chosen to mobilize less troops, which would have released manpower for
use both in agriculture but also e.g. in coal mining (a critical
bottleneck) and the chemical industry (using coal, to produce
fertilizers). Obviously, this would have lessened the odds of
capturing the Soviet Union in one year, but it would have improved the
food situation.

Instead, Germany chose to improve its food situation by taking the
food away from others, the Soviets, millions of whom would be starved
in the process. *That* was what the Generalplan Ost amount to. And
*that* is the plan that they carried out. Why did they have more food
in 1942? Because they had squeezed it - at the cost of millions of
deaths - out of the General Government, in addition to a better
harvest.

&gt; that was largely responsible for the stabilization of their situation
&gt; and the improvement in productivity. It is for more reasons, therefore,

&gt; bulked so large in previous chapters. When we place it alongside the
&gt; ideological impulse for mass murder and the pragmatic needs of the war
&gt; economy, many of the contradictions that appear to characterize Nazi
&gt; policy, above all in 1942, resolve themselves into a ghastly pattern of
&gt; coherence.
&gt; +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
&gt; However I think the paragraph is clear that in 1941, Tooze claim is that
&gt; the Nazi's mass murders of so many people in Nazi Germany was because
&gt; the Nazis did not have enough food to feed the population.
">

No, Tooze does not say that. Tooze is making the point that actual food
shortage and ideology were intertwined strands in German policy.

The Hunger Plan was part of the vague German grand strategy for the occupied
territories, for Hitler's new German Empire (literally, Third Reich). The
civilian population of the Eastern occupied territories and the millions of
captured Polish and Russian POWs were to be mostly exterminated by
starvation, preparing the way for the resettlement of these areas with
'racial Germans'. The food supplies of the occupied territories, on the
other hand, were to be used to make Germany self-sufficient in food, to
avoid the problems of WW1.

After a few months, however, when it became clear that Germany's imperial
economy desperately needed labourers, the plan was altered to give a minimal
and inadequate level of subsistence to those employed as slave workers,
which made them extremely inefficient workers. But there was always a
conflict between the amount of food the Germans were prepared to give their
captives and the amount they needed to be able to be efficient workers. This
conflict was partly practical - there was not enough food to go around
however it was divided, and partly ideological - Germans had to be fed
better than anyone else.

The Final Solution plan, on the other hand, related to about 20 million
people designated as racial enemies of the German people who were to be
exterminated for racial reasons, although they could be used for labour
while waiting murder. That plan had nothing to do with food issues, although
naturally killing so many people helped create a larger surplus for Germans
to eat. Not until late in the war was the Final Solution abandoned and Jews
designated as permanent labourers, although even then racial ideology meant
they had to receive less food than any other group.

I haven't seen evidence of this. As I said above, there seems to have been
various options for the future of the Slavs in the occupied territories,
including organised permanent slavery, mass sterilisation leading to natural
wastage over two generation and mass murder. AFAIK, there does not seem to
have been any conclusions reached before the issue became moot due to the
Soviet Union not collapsing as envisaged. This fact OTOH strengthened the
slave labour camp and policy lurched in that direction, albeit within a
racial context as has already been pointed out.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the other hand, the
&gt; difficult food situation made the search of a solution imperative, and
&gt; it was definitely a factor in killing millions by starving them off,
&gt; since the long-term goal was to replace Slavs with Germanic
&gt; populations in any case.
">

It is quite hard to work out if the starvation in the East was a by-product
of German plans to feed Germans first and best, or a deliberate policy to
impose starvation for its own sake. Does Tooze illuminate this issue?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Bernard's case rests on the fact that the Nazis would probably not
&gt; have killed all these millions without the historical food situation,
&gt; and that is indeed a fact. If, say, the Soviet Union had produced
&gt; enough food for its civilian population and the German invaders, there
&gt; would have been no need to step up the forced starvation program in
&gt; 1942 and there would have been less deaths in 1941.
&gt; It's even possible to argue that, absent the widespread concern about
&gt; food and the equally-widespread instructions disseminated to the
&gt; troops that the Reich was fighting for survival and the Slavs had to
&gt; be starved so that Germany should live in a survival of the fittest
&gt; social-Darwinist replay, atrocities like the deliberate starving of
&gt; some 2 million Soviet POWs would not have occurred.

&gt; So a case can be made for the food situation as the direct or indirect
&gt; source of a lot of the killings.
">

This doesn't fit at all with what I know of the ideological drivers. Hitler
was determined in 1940-41 to destroy the cultural and ideological
foundations of Polish independence and Soviet communism, by murdering
everyone who might harbour such views, hence the murder of anyone with any
education or rank, including officers and NCO POW. That fact in itself would
have led to the systematic murder, probably by starvation, of millions of
people both civilian and military.

The fate of the rest - women, children, peasants, enlisted men - as late as
September 1941 was still open; the Russian resistance around Moscow later
that year kept the options open until mid-1942, when it became clear that
the utopian dreams of the previous summer were over.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My point, beyond the fact that the Wehrmacht and other Nazi
&gt; organizations would have gone off on a killing spree anyway, is that
&gt; the reason why starving millions was even considered in the first
&gt; place was the racial worldview in the first place.
">

Yes; I agree completely.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Tooze highlights that there was a chicken and egg situation between
&gt; the food problem and Nazi policies. Obviously, some Nazi policies were
&gt; unaffected like the T4 program but in terms of deaths they pale
&gt; compared to the millions starved, worked to death or killed elsewhere.
&gt; I believe that this is a case where the chicken laid the egg in the
&gt; first place, and I believe that this is also what Tooze argues.
">

Food cannot have been the premier factor for all policy-makers, simply
because Germany wantonly killed many primary food-producers (farmers,
peasants, animal husbandry) and still more food-processors (bakers,
butchers, etc) and destroyed the infrastructure (farms, silos, railways,
etc) which would have guaranteed a supply of food to Germany. There is very
little sign in any of the military of occupation policy documents that food
supply had been identified as a key factor prior to invasion.

Equally, there was no clear central guidance (as there was for Jews,
officers or educated people) about what to do with enlisted men, civilians,
etc. If Hitler had captured Moscow in December 1941, his euphoria would have
known no bounds, and he tended to take big bold decisions when he felt
confident. So, I'd guess that 1942 might indeed have seen an articulated
Final Solution for the Slavic Problem, just as 1940 had seen one for the
Jewish Problem and 1939 saw one for ill and disabled Germans. That FSSP
might have been a plan to kill all Slavs, but equally it might have been a
planned slavery programme, with lives of workers protected and deliberate
breeding programmes. There are certainly documents advocating such an idea
among SS files.

As it is, the measures taken were a mix of solutions carried out at
different layers within the German military and administration. The Heer,
for example, ended up with millions of POW about whom there was no clear
order either to kill or preserve. In those circumstances, the lack of food
would be decisive.

&gt; &gt; Let us remind ourselves: in the first weeks of 1941, the Reich Ministry
&gt; &gt; of Food and the Wehrmacht military-economic staff had agreed on the
&gt; &gt; Hunger Plan, a scheme which called for the deliberate starvation of no
&gt; &gt; less than 30 million inhabitants of the Soviet Union. This explicit
&gt; &gt; commitment to mass murder was made official policy, months before the SS
&gt; &gt; began to formulate a concrete and specific plan for the extermination of
&gt; &gt; the Jewish population of Europe. Food cut across the contradiction
&gt; &gt; between economics and ideology, between the need for labour and the
&gt; &gt; imperative for genocide. It provided the Third Reich with a starkly
&gt; &gt; economic incentive for murder on a scale larger even than the Holocaust.

Right, the question regarding Bernard's question is how much of the
killing of millions was an economic vs a racial decision.

Millions died after Barbarossa had failed, largely through lack of
food. The General Government was killed and starved out, with millions
of victims, in 1942. Bernard's question was how much that was an
economic decision (stop feeding the "useless mouths" so as to secure
proper rations for the workers) and how much an ideological one.

We were not discussing a history of the Final Solution or of nazi
plans for Russia after it had been conquered.

As to whether Tooze illuminates the issue and what I think his
position on that score is, the above exchange between Bernard and
myself is the best that you're going to get short of reading the
book.

Food processors are useless if food-production in general is down,
regarding food-producers the intention was to replace them and

Then there's the difference between what had been intended at

Your argument about German behavior could be used to "demonstrate"
that the Germans had no plans to use captured Soviet rolling stock as
their troops kept shooting up Soviet equipment. The reality is that
there were plans but the troops went with their own version, steering

In large parts of the former Soviet territory in 1942-43, the general
OKW/OKH occupation policy was to eliminate the general population by
whatever means available, such as fostering starvation through the
destruction of food production and processing, to reduce partisan activity
(Bartov). At the same time, the agreed German governmental policy in both
the areas under civilian rule and the military-administered areas was to
preserve the food-generating potential to enable later colonisation,
although this policy was tacitly abandoned in 1943 (Browning and Loehr).

Different policies by different agencies, basically.

But there *was* planning, discussion and policy-making about a Final
Solution for the Slavic Problem, in those terms and coincident with the
discussions about the other Final Solutions. Hitler always saw war as the
symbolic and practical opportunity to resolve the racial struggle between
the superior and inferior races: by the late 1930s, his chosen method of
governance had seen initiatives emerge from within government and the NSDAP
to deal with all the racial issues. Some were acted upon immediately - T4;
some started but unfinished - the Jews and other Volksfeind; Polish
intellectuals; and some never got started beyond the initial stages - the
Slavs en masse.

I drew an entirely valid distinction between what was planned in two cases

Not according to the studies (Browning and Loehr's) I have now skimmed
through.

Himmler, in his capacity as RKFDV Commissioner, managed to find only 1.5m
pure ethnic Germans and another 1.8 acceptable ethnic Germans. As early as
Jan 1940, therefore, the RKFDV had accepted the need to keep the bulk of the
'peasants' (aka primary food producers) of Poland alive "for at least 3
generations" in order to achieve and maintain the feasibility of German
autarky in food. By then, it was hoped, the ethnic German population would
have increased to sufficient extent to enable the cleansing of the Poles
from Poland. That was the Polish Final Solution; it was never fully agreed
and never more than patchily implemented, being finally abandoned in late
1942.

A similar pattern was seen in the even more sketchy RKFDV planning for
Russia and the Baltic States. The intelligentsia and educated classes would
be eliminated quickly, along with Volksfreind; the agricultural work force
