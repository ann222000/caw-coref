Great Plains Audio is pleased to announce the most significant advance
in the famous 604-series of loudspeakers since the advent of the
constantdirectivity
horn: The GPA Model 604-8H-II Two-Way Loudspeaker
System.
The Model 604-8H-II is a two-way loudspeaker that is designed to
provide unsurpassed reproduction of the audio spectrum over a wide
frequency range with extremely high efficiency. When connected to an
appropriate crossover unit and installed in a proper enclosure, the
GPA
Model 604-8H-II Two-Way Loudspeaker System reproduces the entire
spectrum of human hearing with naturalness, extremely accurate
phasing,
and excellent stereo imaging.
ë
Actually two loudspeakers in one, the Model 604-8H-II is comprised
of an extremely efficient low-frequency loudspeaker and a high-
frequency
compression driver/horn assembly that are coaxially mounted together.
This
method of magnet construction is what makes the Model 604-8H-II sound
so good - since both it’s low and high frequency signals emanate from
the
same vertical AND horizontal planes, extreme accuracy of reproduction
and
spatial separation are attained.

“Digital Ready” is a phrase heard often in the audio world. Part of
what
makes digital records so impressive is the amount of low-frequency
content
they contain. Most loudspeaker designers, in an attempt to make it
possible
for their products to be able to “handle” the demands of digital
audio,
utilize large, heavy voice coils, inarticulate suspension systems, and
cones
that weigh far too much to be able to reproduce the middle of the
audio
spectrum accurately. In addition, this approach results in
loudspeakers that
require large amounts of audio power so that they may operate. Not
only
that, but the majority of designs of that type have voice coils that
“overhang” outside of the magnetic field. The benefits of constructing
a
loudspeaker in this manner are many, the most notable ones being a
significant loss of control of cone movement, which reduces the
ability of
the loudspeaker to articulate sounds accurately.
The GPA Model 604-8H-II Two-Way Loudspeaker System does not
require design and construction techniques such as these in order for
it to
be able to respond to the demands of digital music and sound effects.
Instead, the Model 604-8H-II utilizes a lightweight cone with a
highcompliance
suspension, and the low-frequency voice coil remains in the
magnetic gap at all times. When combined with the largest motor
structure
ever used on a 604-series loudspeaker, these features allow the Great
Plains Audio Model 604-8H-II to exhibit cleaner, more natural
response,
tighter low-frequency control, and the most accurate low-frequency
sound
reproduction found in any other system of its type available today.

The focal point of the high-frequency section of the Model 604-8H-II
is the diaphragm/voice coil assembly, the design of which is critical
to
accurate sound reproduction. Even though many manufacturers today try
to claim they have discovered a superior method of high-frequency
reproduction, Great Plains Audio has chosen a different paradigm. By
utilizing only the finest, time-tested materials and manufacturing
methods
in the construction of it’s high-frequency section, including: (1) an
all-metal
aluminum dome structure; (2) a tangential compliance; and (3) a voice-
coil
of 1 3/4-inch edgewound copper clad aluminum ribbon. These features
assure superior sound reproduction of the frequencies above crossover
in
the Model 604-8H-II.
In order to assure that the sounds being generated by the diaphragm
leave the loudspeaker in proper phase alignment, the Model 604-8H-II
uses
our exclusive RADIAL-WAVE™ phasing system, which ensures
maximum high frequency reproduction while maintaining proper phasing
and smooth overall response to beyond 20 kHz.
When operating, the audio waves leave the high-frequency diaphragm,
go through the RADIAL-WAVE™ phasing system, enter an exponential
throat where they are conducted through the center of the low-
frequency
pole piece and into our small constant-directivity horn. Most horn
designs
tend to narrow their dispersion patterns as the pitch goes up. Our
horn
design doesn’t have this problem. It produces the same dispersion
pattern
throughout it’s bandwidth. The result at the listening position is a
startling,
nearly 3-D stereo image that exhibits superior latitude in the seating
position.
These different parts of the Model 604-8H-II - the low-frequency
section, the high-frequency diaphragm, the RADIAL-WAVE™ phasing
system, the small constant-directivity horn, and the powerful FerriteV
magnetic assemblies - all combine in the Model 604-8H-II to create a
loudspeaker capable of uniform, peak-free reproduction throughout the
range of human hearing, thus making it ideal as the loudspeaker of
choice
where natural, unadulterated sound reproduction is required.

Sentimentality?

It is well known that the 604 series basic coax horn/cone technology was
good, but that modern implementations of  that technology from Tannoy as
well as B&amp;C completely eclipse the 604 or minor upgrades of it.

While B&amp;C are not well-known to US audiophiles, they have a full line of
sophisticated products and sell for competitive prices.

Their 15 inch is rated as handling 800 watts continuous. It has to be
a heavy coned affair. Vintage speakers are prized because they do not
handle huge power: they have light cones.

The Tannoy DC is indeed a good speaker but they are not available new
to the speaker builder. I think some can be had as  complete studio
monitors if you want to pulll them down. They are expensive as hell
that way because you are throwing out the cab and x/o.

The new GPA 604 is US-made and supposedly available as a raw driver.
I'd rather have a 12" but the 15" has a great track record, In a nice
big cab it will nearly equal a LaScala in efficiency. One pair of
modest beam power tubes will drive them louder than you want.

Over-simplification. Old speakers have light cones given the efficiency of
their motors which was not always that great.  Many of the B&amp;C drivers are
right up there with the classic drivers of old in terms of efficiency, but
have neat modern features like appreciable Xmax.

Hence my comments about B&amp;C.

I have a friend who is exceedingly knowlegable about speakers, and is
marketing a system he designed that is based on B&amp;C drivers. It's definately
not Euro-junk.

Generally speaking that is a fairly sweeping generalisation that ignores how
good some older speakers were, and how bad some new speakers are.

What you should say is that speaker design knowledge, materials, production
techniques, and measurement capabilities have provided the means of making
better speakers for those companies that actually choose to.

And that is why you are not really correct. Most companies are more
interested in making money, than "SOTA" speakers.
Now if you had qualified the statement as "SOTA" in the first place, there
would be no argument.

Yes, speaker companies are generally businesses, and businesses have this
compulsion to generate profits. ;-)

Historically, there has been no money in making a true SOTA speaker. It is
easy for costs to get out of hand.

OTOH, there can be money in making near-SOTA speakers, and that's really
what I'm talking about.

Well, near-SOTA. If you look at say the Xmax of SOTA speakers of say the
1960s, and look at what Xmax is now even in fairly cheap-but-cheerful
speakers, there has been a tremendous amount of worthwhile development.

Fortunately you qualified that statement as only something you *think*.

And I'm always puzzled though why people think the biggest affect on a
speakers sound is only in the region around 50Hz or less. Not to mention the
fact that many speakers were not ported anyway. And measurement of system Q
was possible after construction, so just because design was more hit and
miss does not mean there were no successful attempts anyway.

"Popular" for who?

Most certainly, it led to a proliferation of any number of
programs not intended for or used by the more experienced
and knowledgable professional practitioners in the field.
I would hazard to suiggest, though, that the vast majority
of users of such "CAD" programs have little or no fundamental
understanding of the underlying model and WHY it does what
does. The same, unfortunately, can be said for not an
insigificnat portion of recent and current "professional"
users.

But the basic Thiele-Small model does not require the
use of computer support to be immensly useful IF you
know what you're doing.30 years ago, I was doing useful
work with the model with no auxiliary tools other than
a pencil, paper and a slide rule, and getting excellent
results.

If that's what they think, then they don't understand the
model. The model is defined over the piston range of
the speaker, and that's a damned site broader than
"50Hz or les."

But,m then again, this is the first I ever heard that some
people think this.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

So what? The Thiele/Small model is a "direct radiator" model,
not a vented model. Even Thiele's original article is directly
applicable to sealed boxes, because the transfer funtions
on which they are based cover both with no modifications
other than the correct use of coefficients.

But few knew what "Q" meant, much less what it was
in the context of a 4th-order system like a vented box
(where there is not one "Q" but twp, both of which are
composites of a number of loss factors).

David B Weems in his book has box matching stepped out for what-to-do by
diyers,
but I just use WINisd, a free program to match a driver to a box.

But such programs don't give you the full band response for the driver
chosen;
they only deal with the reactive bit at the bottom of the band, so subs
and bass
and midranges work out OK.

T&amp;S made it easy for bean counters to make boxes small and to design
drivers to fit them
so they could say they offered fine bass extension from a little box.

In fact what we got from makers was a bunch of over bean countered crap,
including silly things like AR12 with no ports, because when you tried
to fit one
it made no difference.
Its extremely common for mass made speakers made between 1950 and now to
have
appalling F response.

The public does not really know quality even if it bit them on their
bum,
and price and the wife govern sales.

Boffins using fancy programs to design wonderful speakers are routinely
ignored
and their designs dumbed down.

I once compared a Sonus Faber 2 way Concerto bookshelf to my own floor
stander
3 ways which have the extra octave of low bass and found the Sonus F
were
pretty fine speakers with good bass but they wouldn't go real low.
and once you turned up the wick they became quite muddled compared to my
3 way.
Probably because the FB is quite high, and not below 50Hz where it
should be.
But they are good bookshelfs, no doubt, and the guy who designed them
must have got his T&amp;S
parameters right IMHO.

Once the box matching gets to be too critical in ported enclosures,
bass suffers.

Many drivers are one heck of a lot better now than they were in 1972,
although the trend is now to cheap generic crap made in China
with very poor design and wide tolerances.

Human nature continues to cheat ppl of their hard earned cash.

The chronology was more like that Small discovered Thiel's 1962 work in the
early 70s and popularized it then.

Programmable calculators were becoming economical at the time, and this

Then, in the early 1980s, PCs became popular, and even the smaller of them

Define "industry." It's something I've been working in

criteria at the professional level. "Availability," "reliability,"
"repeatability," and such are frankly far more important
properties, be they of drivers or data or algorithms.

There's certainly no denying that the last 2 decades has
seen a proliferation of cute little utilities and doodads
available to anyone who has a computer. But the model
has been used at the professional level in nearly its original
form since it originally appeared.

That would be one of those "opinon" things, and, in this case,
a fairly uninformed one, I would posit.

The low-frequency performance of most of the drivers
and systems you seem to go on about endlessly is,
in any number of object measures, dismal. Extremely
non-linear, mass-stiffness and BL product ratios that
make them all but useless, no linear excursion, uncontrolled
cone modes that makes the Himalayas look glass smooth,

The nice thing about them is their relative rarity: keeps
one from being assaulted by them too often.

Initally, people just measured the drivers to derive their own T/S parameter

True.

It's nice to select a driver without having to buy one to measure first though.

Spoken like a real amateur. Any *proper* designer could make his own T-S
measurements 30 years ago, just as he can (and should) today.
Like many others have also said already, I did, and used a HP21 calculator
satisfactorily.

True, but I was referring to the port action alone, since system Q was not
an unknown concept.

Not true Dick, you have inhabited these groups for about as long as I have
(nearly two decades) just look what people have written in that time!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Not to mention the fact that many speakers were not
&gt; &gt; ported anyway.

&gt; So what? The Thiele/Small model is a &quot;direct radiator&quot; model,
&gt; not a vented model. Even Thiele's original article is directly
&gt; applicable to sealed boxes, because the transfer funtions
&gt; on which they are based cover both with no modifications
&gt; other than the correct use of coefficients.
">

Also true. However simply adjusting box size for a given driver by measuring
the resultant Q was rather easy for designers without any understanding of
the principles involved. I will admit to having done it that way myself as a
teenager.
Now of course later knowledge told us why some drivers cannot be tuned in
any sealed box, and also lead to tiny boxes with tiny drivers that have
extended bass at low SPL, which is the current trend. However that alone
does not necessarily make them any better to listen to.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; And measurement of system Q was possible after
&gt; &gt; construction, so just because design was more hit and
&gt; &gt; miss does not mean there were no successful attempts
&gt; &gt; anyway.

&gt; But few knew what &quot;Q&quot; meant, much less what it was
&gt; in the context of a 4th-order system like a vented box
&gt; (where there is not one &quot;Q&quot; but twp, both of which are
&gt; composites of a number of loss factors).
">

Exactly, which is why I said "sealed boxes", which are not 4h order and do
not have 2 resonant Q's.

My point was that a good large sealed enclosure design of the day, can still
beat the majority of small vented modern speakers in the lower octaves, AND
that the higher octaves are not goverened by the box design anyway. A lot
more speakers were three way 30 years ago, and the mid range and treble were
definitly not affected by vent size! (maybe in a non sealed mid range
without a proper enclosure)
What has really changed is preference for small box sizes and the ability to
provide much better performance in those sizes. The two obviously go hand in
hand.

My other point was that mid range and tweeter driver design and measurement
capability has had just as big an impact on sound quality IMO. The assertion
that T-S box design is the only, or even main factor in increased speaker
performance is just plain wrong, and I imagine you would agree?

Agreed. In the early days we used T/S to build boxes that matched the

&gt;&gt; &gt; Graham, the papers on Thele-Small vented box

&gt; It was published in 1962 in IRE Australia. It did not make

&gt;&gt; &gt; This is 45 years ago did this contribute to &quot;antique Sound&quot;

&gt; EV  marketing had pictures of their products in trade journals undergoing
&gt; anechoic          &gt; chamber testing , in real time, on real products
&gt; taking real data. Is this  boneheaded
&gt; design or is using A T/S box design SIMULATION boneheaded design????
&gt;LOL,

&gt; You can easily design with out T/S , Some time in the mid 60's L W Erath
&gt; came out with a line of speakers with motional feedback, He dubbed it
&gt; &quot;Electronic suspension&quot;. this feedback loop to the amplifier reduced
&gt; distortion,
&gt; speaker resonances, cabinet resonances and improved dampening. You needed
&gt; &quot;Clip Kits&quot; to connect to your amplifier feedback loops.

&gt; An audio dealer I knew sold some of these speakers,  He had photos with
&gt; the grills
&gt; removed on a model IV, Each cabinet had four 15 in speakers with
&gt;  &gt; &quot;Electronic Suspension&quot;  Unfortunately they were sold befor I could hear
&gt; them.
&gt; This dealer liked the Bozak &quot;Concert Grand&quot; but he would rave about LWE.

&gt; Data on motional feedback loops goes back to at least the late 40's
&gt; I would say these bone heads knew what they were doing....Do you ????
