Well well well... Turns out Wikipedia has a "liberal bias". Too many
articles rely on science, which is, as we all know, the Devil's
playground. Conservatroids needn't worry, though -- now you all have your
very own version of Wikipedia that's pre-filtered and pre-digested for
"conservative only" diets. It's called "Conservapedia". The NYTimes
reports on this new wellspring of Conservative Knowledge:

*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *

According to Wired, the Conservapedia project leader, Andrew Schlafly,
“started the site in late November 2006 in conjunction with 58
high-school-level, home-schooled students from the New Jersey area”
because he was frustrated by what he sees as the liberal bias in
Wikipedia. Shawn Zeller at CQPolitics tells us:

Schlafly says his bias suspicions took firm hold when his own edits to
a Wikipedia entry on the controversy over teaching evolution in Kansas
schools — which simply recorded statements, he says, from advocates of
creationism — were repeatedly removed.

*   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *

Read all about it here:
http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/03/08/conservapedia-the-word-sa...

It's my supposition that Scottie is perusing the "Conservapedia"
voraciously to learn all that the mainstream, liberal, anti-God media
suppress, and that's why we on RAO haven't been blessed with his presence
lately.

You're simply not worthy of my presence, dhimmi.   You poor saps have
nothing to discuss but your own pathetic efforts at thought control so
here's something for your cud.

How do you think you would do...in a muslim court?  Shall we call it

right up your alley.

I never knew the left shared the same view of liberals gone
conservative that many Muslims hold of apostates.   The hypocrisy
ridiculing Sanchez gay history shows the real depth of their own
shallow convictions.   Those gay conservatives....is there a more vile
and despicable creature on the planet?

But I can't leave unmentioned the poor loon from mediamatters who sees
a homophobic conspiracy behind every Fox broadcast.  That poor fool
has some serious issues to which I'm sure you can relate.

">

At first I thought this was another "interesting" blob of Scottie-speak,
but then I googled it. Wiki says:

The word dhimmi ... literally means 'protection, care, custody,
covenant of protection, compact; responsibility, answerableness;
financial obligation, liability, debt; inviolability, security of life
and property; safeguard, guarantee, security; conscience' and
ahl-dhimmi is "the free non-Muslim subjects living in Muslim countries
who, in return for paying the capital tax, enjoyed protection and
safety

GOK what you're "thinking" about, Scooter.

[snip more anti-Muslim, anti-Gay, and anti-reason ranting]

BTW, your beloved Conthervopedia doesn't know what "dhimmi" means. You
better get your highly educated kid to beef it up right away.

Um, the point was not his gay history, toopid.

Are they similar to your serious issues, toopid?

I listened to conservative talk radio yesterday for the first time in
a few weeks. Here's what I learned:

Clinton lied to a grand jury first, so Libby should win an appeal.
Further, a blow job is worse than a blown cover.

A republican Congressman has been voting with the Dems on some issues.
He is a turncoat. The host attributed his move toward the center to
"pandering" to his district, which has been electing Dems to local
office recently. The host felt that this Congressman should vote
republican no matter what. He was pissed, and he wasn't going to take
it any more!

Anyone who sells their social security card should not go to trial and
jail. Apparently, a $3 bullet would work better and be less expensive.
Another caller pointed out that you can get bullets far cheaper than
that.

With 'logic' like that, is it any wonder that the morally and
intellectually bankrupt conservative movement is getting their asses
handed to them? LOL!

BTW, toopid, have you been following GEN Petreus? Let's see what he
has to say:

"He said that "any student of history recognizes there is no military
solution to a problem like that in Iraq, to the insurgency in Iraq."

(i.e. But we all know how you feel about history, toopid... It's for
losers, right? After all, there was that one successful
counterinsurgency! LOL!)

"Military force alone is not sufficient to end the violence in
Iraq and political talks must eventually include some militant groups
now opposing the U.S.-backed government, the new commander of U.S.
forces in Iraq said Thursday. "This is critical," Gen. David Petraeus
said in his first news conference since taking over command last
month. He noted that such political negotiations "will determine in
the long run the success of this effort."

(i.e. This will be news to bushie...)

And how do you feel about "supporting the troops" like the injured
ones at Walter Reed?

Imbecile.

The Conservapedia seems to have deleted its entry on the
Northwestern Arboreal Octopus. But its entry on the
kangaroo -- http://www.conservapedia.com/Kangaroo -- contains
much that I did not know, such as the fact that "after the Flood,
kangaroos bred from the Ark passengers migrated to Australia.
There is debate whether this migration happened over land...or
if they rafted on mats of vegetation torn up by the receding flood
waters."

That's how the elephants floated to Africa, too. 5,000-year-old

You know, it's possible to get carried away with this "proof" thing.
Sometimes a real scientist has to take a beat, step back for a minute,
draw a deep breath, pound a tom-tom, re-examine the evidence, and sign up
for a refresher course in poopology.

I have a new, improved guess as to why Scottie Terrierdork is lying low.
It's because of the new round of scandals rocking his beloved Republican
regime. There's the indefensible horror show at the Army medical centers,
the conviction of Libby and the coming conflagration when Dumbya pardons
him, the pressure from Congress to tell the truth about Iraq, the ongoing
shame of the disaster in New Orleans, the shameful prostituting of junk
science to serve politics... Even Scottie, dumb as he is, is smart enough
to see how hopeless it is to defend the worst presidency in U.S. history.

Is that like the one where you admitted you were stupid? You know, the
one you said you posted after blowing a donkey.

Actually, I don't know what you are talking about, toopid. How about a
message ID, like you always ask for?

That would be eversohelpful.

TIA.

you?

Let's see the message ID, toopid. Then I can tell if you're only
hallucinating or if you're lying...again.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So why do you think Sssshhead broke his vow[sic] and followed my link?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Boredom would be my guess.
&gt; &gt; I'm still trying to figure out what link of his he supposes I

&gt; &gt; Do you have any idea?

&gt; Hmmm.... Apparently dear little Scooter was confused. This is very

Poor little fool is really melting down now.

I think you're right about the reason: all of his 'moral' and
'intellectually-driven' conservatism is tumbling down all around him.

It appears that a response got lost. If it shows up, sorry for the
redundancy.

I'm not sold, toopid, unless that was like the one where you posted
that you were a client of the gay prostitute in Denver, but you
stopped patronizing him, not because it was wrong, but because you
found a better source for your crack habit. You know, the one where
you said you had sex with a camel at the San Diego zoo.

Perhaps you could provide a message ID? That might help your case more
than "You know, that one where you said..."

Or (more likely) it is a figment of your imagination. Or a lie.

Message ID?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Hope plus your post equals proof, toopid. Remember that one post where
you said that you liked to lick the spincters of small furry animals?
Or that one where you definitely stated you missed playing quarterback
because it gave you the opportunity to tickle the center's balls?

And once again, firm evidence that toopid cannot understand the world
around him.
