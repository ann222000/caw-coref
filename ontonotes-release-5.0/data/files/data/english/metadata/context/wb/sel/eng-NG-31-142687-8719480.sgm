Why Winston Wouldn't Stand For W

George W. Bush always wanted to be like a wartime British prime minister. He
is. But it's not the one he had in mind.

President Bush's favorite role model is, famously, Jesus, but Winston
Churchill is close behind. The president admires the wartime British prime
minister so much that he keeps what he calls &quot;a stern-looking bust&quot; of
Churchill in the Oval Office. &quot;He watches my every move,&quot; Bush jokes. These
days, Churchill would probably not care for much of what he sees.

I've spent a great deal of time thinking about Churchill while working on my
book &quot;Troublesome Young Men,&quot; a history of the small group of Conservative
members of Parliament who defied British Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain's policy of appeasing Adolf Hitler, forced Chamberlain to resign
in May 1940 and helped make Churchill his successor. I thought my audience
would be largely limited to World War II buffs, so I was pleasantly
surprised to hear that the president has been reading my book. He hasn't let
me know what he thinks about it, but it's a safe bet that he's identifying
with the book's portrayal of Churchill, not Chamberlain. But I think Bush's
hero would be bemused, to say the least, by the president's wrapping himself
in the Churchillian cloak. Indeed, the more you understand the historical
record, the more the parallels leap out -- but they're between Bush and
Chamberlain, not Bush and Churchill.

Like Bush and unlike Churchill, Chamberlain came to office with almost no
understanding of foreign affairs or experience in dealing with international
leaders. Nonetheless, he was convinced that he alone could bring Hitler and
Benito Mussolini to heel. He surrounded himself with like-minded advisers
and refused to heed anyone who told him otherwise.

In the months leading up to World War II, Chamberlain and his men saw little
need to build up a strong coalition of European allies with which to
confront Nazi Germany -- ignoring appeals from Churchill and others to
fashion a &quot;Grand Alliance&quot; of nations to thwart the threat that Hitler posed
to the continent.

Unlike Bush and Chamberlain, Churchill was never in favor of his country
going it alone. Throughout the 1930s, while urging Britain to rearm, he also
strongly supported using the newborn League of Nations -- the forerunner to
today's United Nations -- to provide one-for-all-and-all-for-one security to
smaller countries. After the League failed to stop fascism's march,
Churchill was adamant that, to beat Hitler, Britain must form a true
partnership with France and even reach agreement with the despised Soviet
Union, neither of which Chamberlain was willing to do.

Like Bush, Chamberlain also laid claim to unprecedented executive authority,
evading the checks and balances that are supposed to constrain the office of
prime minister. He scorned dissenting views, both inside and outside
government. When Chamberlain arranged his face-to-face meetings with Hitler
in 1938 that ended in the catastrophic Munich conference, he did so without
consulting his cabinet, which, under the British system, is responsible for
making policy. He also bypassed the House of Commons, leading Harold
Macmillan, a future Tory prime minister who was then an anti-appeasement MP,
to complain that Chamberlain was treating Parliament &quot;like a Reichstag, to
meet only to hear the orations and to register the decrees of the government
of the day.&quot;

As was true of Bush and the Republicans before the 2006 midterm elections,
Chamberlain and his Tories had a large majority in the Commons, and, as
Macmillan noted, the prime minister tended to treat Parliament like a lapdog
legislature, existing only to do his bidding. &quot;I secretly feel he hates the
House of Commons,&quot; wrote one of Chamberlain's most fervent parliamentary
supporters. &quot;Certainly he has a deep contempt for Parliamentary
interference.&quot;

Churchill, on the other hand, revered Parliament and was appalled by
Chamberlain's determination to dominate the Commons in the late 1930s.
Churchill considered himself first and foremost &quot;a child&quot; and &quot;servant&quot; of
the House of Commons and strongly believed in the legislature's
constitutional role to oversee the executive (even when, after becoming
prime minister, he often railed against MPs who criticized him). In August
1939, when Chamberlain rammed through a two-month parliamentary adjournment
just weeks before the war began, Churchill -- then still a backbencher --
exploded with anger in the House, calling the prime minister's move
&quot;disastrous,&quot; &quot;pathetic&quot; and shameful.&quot; He encouraged his anti-appeasement
colleagues to mount similar attacks against Chamberlain, and when one of
them, Ronald Cartland, called the prime minister a dictator to his face in
the same debate, Churchill congratulated Cartland with an enthusiastic,
&quot;Well done, my boy, well done!&quot;

Likewise, Churchill almost certainly would look askance at the Bush
administration's years-long campaign to shut down public debate over the
&quot;war on terror&quot; and the conflict in Iraq -- tactics markedly similar to
Chamberlain's attempts to quiet his opponents. Like Bush and his aides,
Chamberlain badgered and intimidated the press, restricted journalists'
access to sources and claimed that anyone who dared criticize the government
was guilty of disloyalty and damaging the national interest. Just as Bush
has done, Chamberlain authorized the wiretapping of citizens without court
authorization; Churchill was among those whose phones were tapped by the
prime minister's subordinates.

Churchill, by contrast, believed firmly in the sanctity of individual
liberties and the need to protect them from government encroachment. That's
not to say that he was never guilty of infringing on them himself. In June
1940, when a Nazi invasion of Britain seemed imminent, he ordered the
internment of more than 20,000 enemy aliens living on British soil, most of
them refugees from Hitler's and Mussolini's fascist regimes. But as the
invasion scare abated over the next few months, the vast majority were
released, also by his order. &quot;The key word in any understanding of Winston
Churchill is the simple word 'Liberty,' &quot; wrote Eric Seal, Churchill's
principal private secretary during the early years of the war. &quot;He intensely
disliked, and reacted violently against, all attempts to regiment and
dictate opinion. . . . He demanded for himself freedom to follow his own
star, and he stood out for a like liberty for all men.&quot;
Writing about Churchill and Chamberlain, I've discovered, is like
administering a Rorschach test to one's readers. People see in Churchill and
Chamberlain what they want to see. They draw parallels between the 1930s and
the events of today according to their own political philosophy. I've
received congratulatory letters and e-mails from people who see similarities
between the current U.S. woes in Iraq and Chamberlain's disastrous conduct
of the so-called phony war in 1939-40. But I've also gotten fan mail from
readers who favorably compare the Tory rebels' courageous fight against
Chamberlain to the Bush administration's campaign against those opposing the
Iraq war. Among those who've written me in praise of the book are Bush
adviser Karl Rove and Howard Wolfson, the communications director of Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential campaign.

The president no doubt has his own Churchill. &quot;He was resolute,&quot; Bush has
remarked. &quot;He was tough. He knew what he believed.&quot; But Churchill would
snort, I believe, at the administration's equation of &quot;Islamofascism,&quot; an
amorphous, ill-defined movement of killers forced to resort to terrorism by
their lack of military might, to Nazi Germany, a global power that had
already conquered several countries before Churchill took office in 1940.
Still, key members of the Bush administration have compared critics of the
wars on terrorism and in Iraq to the appeasers of the 1930s, thus implicitly
equating their boss and themselves to Churchill and the &quot;troublesome young
men&quot; who helped bring him to power. During bleak days in Iraq, the
administration's hawks can be forgiven for hoping that history will show
them to be as far-sighted about a gathering storm as Churchill was in the
1930s.

But history has its own ways, and we cannot make the long-dead titans we
admire give us their modern blessing. As the world's two most prominent and
powerful democracies, the United States and Britain had a responsibility to
serve as exemplars of democracy for the rest of the world, Churchill
believed. But to be fitting role models, he argued, both countries had to do
their best to ensure that the &quot;title deeds of freedom&quot; were strongly
safeguarded within their own boundaries. &quot;Let us preach what we practice,&quot;
he declared in his 1946 &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; speech in Fulton, Mo. &quot;But let us
also practice what we preach.&quot;

White Rose (German: die Wei√üe Rose) was a non-violent resistance group in
Nazi Germany, consisting of a number of students from the University of
Munich and their philosophy professor. The group became known for an
anonymous leaflet campaign, lasting from June 1942 until February 1943, that
called for active opposition to German dictator Adolf Hitler's regime. [1]

Six members, the core members, of the group were arrested by the Gestapo,
convicted and executed by beheading in 1943. The text of their sixth leaflet
was smuggled out of Germany through Scandinavia to England, and in July 1943
copies of it were dropped over Germany by Allied planes, retitled &quot;The
Manifesto of the Students of Munich.&quot; [2]

Today, the members of the White Rose are honored in Germany as great heroes
who opposed the Third Reich in the face of deadly danger for such
resistance.
