Physicians tell what you must do to take charge of your health

By R.J. Ignelzi
January 16, 2007

Thanks to modern science and an abundance of research, staying healthy
has never been easier. Or more confusing.

Medical studies, most often presented to the public in 30-second sound
bites, frequently seem to contradict each other, adding frustration to
an already perplexed consumer.

First we heard: Hormone replacement therapy is good for women. Then:
HRT is bad for women. And, now: Sometimes, it can be good in limited
doses. For years we were told: Vitamin E may prolong your life. More
recently: High doses of vitamin E may kill you.

Who or what is a health-conscious person to believe?

Start with your doctor, preferably one who's familiar with you and your
health history. Instead of jumping on a trendy bandwagon, get your
health care practitioner's opinion and interpretation of the latest
medical research, and ask if any of the new information can be of
interest or benefit to you. To get you started on the right track, 11
San Diego County physicians offer what each considers crucial advice
for good health:

BE A PROACTIVE PATIENT.
- Dr. Mimi Guarneri, cardiologist and medical director for Scripps
Center for Integrative Medicine

"Don't wait for someone else to tell you something's wrong. Pay
attention to your health," Guarneri says. "Be aware of what foods
you eat. Get the weight off. Exercise. Take charge."

It's important to "know your numbers," she adds.

Know your blood pressure; total cholesterol; good (HDL) and bad (LDL)
cholesterol levels. Get screened for diabetes and get a colonoscopy
when you're 50.

"Take ownership. Be an active and responsible participant in your
health and well-being," she says.

PARTICIPATE IN A CLINICAL TRIAL.
- Dr. Michael Lee, Scripps Clinic endocrinologist

"We can only get better treatments to market if we have more studies
to test them," Lee says. "It's a win-win situation for the patient.
They get good dietary advice, good follow-up care and have a chance of
getting the medication." He noted that a growing number of studies
today are "crossover" studies in which the patient may get the
placebo for the first half of the study, but will be assured of getting
the real medication for at least the second half of the trial. To find
a trial that you may be eligible for, ask your physician or check the
National Institutes of Health Web site, clinicaltrials.gov.

GET FREQUENT CARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE.

- Dr. Denise Barnard, cardiologist and director of UCSD's Women's
Cardiovascular Health Program, and Dr. William Norcross, chief of
family medicine at the UCSD Medical Center

"If I could give you a prescription for something that does all of
the following, would you take it?" Barnard asks.

Her "prescription" reduces stress, lowers blood pressure, lowers
bad cholesterol, raises good cholesterol, fights osteoporosis, induces
weight loss, improves bowel regularity and is a natural and
non-addictive sleep aid. It also lowers blood sugar, reduces joint
stiffness, improves mental alertness and is a mild antidepressant.
Plus, when taken regularly, three to five times a week, it reduces your
risk of having a heart attack or stroke.

"Sound too good to be true? It's not. It's called physical activity
and it's free," she says. "It's been tested repeatedly and always
comes out showing health benefits."

Even if you're a smoker, diabetic or overweight, "doing something as
simple as 20 minutes of brisk walking can help," Norcross says. "It
will encourage a smoker to quit, help bring diabetes under control, and
move a person in the direction of losing weight."

EAT MORE FIBER.
- Dr. Thomas Savides, gastroenterologist at the University of
California San Diego and professor of clinical medicine at UCSD School
of Medicine.

"If everyone would just have a half-cup of a high-fiber cereal, like
Fiber One, every day, it would take care of most of our GI problems,"
Dr. Thomas Savides says.

The average adult needs about 25 grams of fiber a day, but most of us
get a measly 12 grams.

"You can't get as much fiber as you need based on just fruits and
vegetables. In the United States, we don't have enough fiber available
to us, since all the fiber is milled out of breads and other foods,"
he says, noting that even bran muffins or grainy, whole-wheat breads
aren't enough.

Gastrointestinal problems that can result from not enough fiber include
constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, hemorrhoids and diverticulosis.

HYDRATE AND PROTECT YOUR SKIN.

- Dr. Hugh Greenway, chairman of dermatologic surgery at Scripps
Clinic.

"The skin is the largest organ of the body and protects everything
else inside, so it's important to hydrate it both inside and out and
protect it," Greenway says.

He recommends drinking six to eight glasses of fluid a day and using a
topical moisturizer on the skin, focusing on those areas that are most
exposed, including the face, neck, hands, arms and legs.

For the face, he also advises an exfoliating "topical retinoid-like
product to help peel off the outer layer" of skin.

Additionally, he urges everyone to wear a broad-spectrum (UVA and UVB
protection) sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30.

"We live in a Mediterranean climate, and we love to be outdoors. But,
we need to use common sense," he says. That means staying out of the
sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., and wearing protective clothing, a
wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses.

MAINTAIN YOUR OPTIMAL WEIGHT.

- Dr. John Willems, director of gynecology at Scripps Clinic and Dr.
Homer Chin, director of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of
California San Diego Medical Center

Staying at a healthy weight is good advice for anyone, but it's
particularly important for women at certain ages, the two San Diego
gynecologists say.

"It's well established that if a woman varies too much in her weight,
a slew of abnormalities can occur (because of fluctuating) hormone
levels," says Chin, who recommends that women stay within 10 percent
to 15 percent of their ideal weight.

For older women, weight gain during the postmenopausal years can lead
to an increased risk of breast cancer. New research reported in The
Journal of the American Medical Association shows that if a woman gains
22 pounds or more after menopause, her risk of breast cancer goes up by
more than 20 percent. It's believed that the fat stores act as
amplifiers for any estrogen in a woman's system, Willems says.

"Women often gain weight after menopause, not because of the drop in
estrogen but simply due to the aging process," Willems says. "It's
that time of life when your metabolism tanks and there's a drop in
estrogen, so you may not be feeling great. So what do you do? You
eat."

To live a long healthy life, "don't worry about estrogen. Worry about
your weight," he says.

GET SCREENED FOR DIABETES.
- Dr. Michael Lee, Scripps Clinic endocrinologist.

Approximately 21 million Americans are believed to have Type 2
diabetes. And about one-third of those with the chronic disease don't
know it, because it's most often asymptomatic.
"One of the scary things is that once you're diagnosed with Type 2
diabetes, about 50 percent of your pancreas is not working anymore,"
Lee says. "While we have good treatments to keep people healthy for a
long time, it'd be nice to get ahead of the game and prevent or delay
diabetes."

While everyone should talk to their physician about their risk for
diabetes, certain people need to be checked out early and frequently.
Risk factors include: A family history of diabetes; being overweight or
obese; being sedentary; women who have had a baby weighing more than 9
pounds; and certain ethnic groups, including African-American, Asian,
American Indian and Hispanic.

EMBRACE YOGA TO STRENGTHEN YOUR CORE.

- Dr. Robert Afra, orthopedic surgeon, division of sports medicine at
University of California San Diego Medical Center.

"We used to work only the show muscles. But when it comes to
function, that's only part of the equation," Afra says.

To keep the body strong and help prevent all kinds of injury, it's
important to work the core muscles, those of the upper and lower trunk
and the pelvic area. And, one of the best ways to do that is to
practice yoga.

"Yoga is great for the core because it does a good job at balancing
strengthening and stretching," he says. "A weak core is a huge
source of back pain that so many people get. Practicing yoga regularly
is a different way of stretching those muscles, which may ease or
prevent many back problems."

PROPERLY TRAIN FOR A PHYSICAL JOB.

- Dr. Don Herip, occupational medicine physician and medical director
of corporate health services at Palomar Pomerado Health Foundation.

Frequently neglected and too often injured on the job are what Herip
calls the "worker or industrial athlete."

This is anyone who performs physical labor as part of his or her job.
It can include a warehouse employee who lifts heavy boxes, a hospital
nurse who must reposition patients. or a construction worker who hoists
heavy equipment.

Just as professional or college athletes must train regularly to
perform their best on the field or court, "worker athletes must also
be trained for their work and ease into their work activity," he
says.

"The worker needs to prepare for a physical job beforehand by
practicing aerobic, flexibility and strength training," he says.
"Their bodies must be prepared and conditioned for the physical work
they do."
