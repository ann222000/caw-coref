&quot;Hillary Clinton would bring change,

Mitt Romney, Basking In the Momentum
By Perry Bacon Jr. | Washington Post
Tuesday, September 4, 2007

ASHLAND, N.H., Sept. 3 -- Former senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee
will grab most of the headlines this week as he enters the race for
the White House, but Mitt Romney likes where he stands in the contest
for the Republican nomination.

&quot;When I started running seven months ago, I was at 5 percent in the
national polls,&quot; the former Massachusetts governor said at a question-
and-answer session here. &quot;Now I won the Iowa straw poll; I'm ahead
here in New Hampshire, ahead in Michigan, ahead in the Nevada.&quot;

The energetic Romney, who is shown jogging in a television ad that his
campaign is running in the Granite State, put his energetic approach
to work on Labor Day: two speeches, two town hall meetings, a parade
and a breakfast stop to greet voters at a restaurant in
Moultonborough. His exertions required several outfit changes, from
tie but no jacket to jacket and tie and then, before the parade in 80-
degree heat, khakis and a polo shirt. But Romney's manner never
changed; whether describing his appreciation of the symbolic
importance of the American flag or talking about issues such as
illegal immigration, the ex-governor almost never stopped smiling.

Even at 8 a.m. in Moultonborough, a tiny town in central New
Hampshire, Romney was his usual hyper-focused self as he surveyed the
Village Kitchen, shaking more than a hundred hands, posing for dozens
of pictures and signing a slew of autographs, all in about 30 minutes.
When a man told Romney, &quot;I like what you're saying,&quot; Romney quickly
grinned and replied, &quot;I like what you're saying, too.&quot; The candidate
did not pause for an explanation, but the voter later volunteered that
he liked Romney's tough stance on &quot;illegals.&quot;

In Milford, Romney darted back and forth at what could have been a
presidential convention, with Romney and Sens. Christopher J. Dodd (D-
Conn.) and Barack Obama (D-Ill.) all leading large groups of
supporters through the streets.

More than any of the other presidential campaigns, Romney's is a
family affair. His wife not only attended most of the day's events but
introduced her husband at one and noted the heavy involvement of the
couple's five sons.

Romney was the only GOP contender in New Hampshire on Labor Day, and
two of his main opponents, the undeclared Thompson and former New York
mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, did not hold any events yesterday. At a
news conference before the parade, Romney could not resist a few jabs
at Thompson. &quot;Why the hurry? Why not take a little longer?&quot; he said
when asked about Thompson starting his official campaign after months
on the sidelines. On Thompson's decision to skip a GOP debate in New
Hampshire tomorrow and instead appear on late-night television, Romney
added, &quot;I think it will boost the ratings of the Jay Leno show, but I
would rather be doing well in New Hampshire.&quot;

Most of Romney's attacks, though, were not aimed at his Republican
rivals. While the Democrats are increasingly beating up on one another
and President Bush, the Republican candidates are unified: They cannot
bash Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) enough. Noting Clinton's
repeated use of the word &quot;change&quot; in her recent speeches, Romney had a
rejoinder he repeated over and over. &quot;Hillary Clinton would bring
change, but it would be a sharp left turn.&quot;

Hey, isn't that the supposed GOP candidate that flip-flopped on
key issues like illegal immigration and abortion rights?

It appears more and more that Romney is &quot;integrity-challenged&quot;..

Romney's honesty problem

By Joan Vennochi, Globe Columnist  |  August 9, 2007

MITT ROMNEY is determined to prove he's pro-life. How about proving he's
pro-truth?

Every time Romney tries to explain his evolution from supporter to
opponent of abortion rights, his honesty comes into question. That's
because his explanations over the years don't add up.

When Republican presidential candidates were asked recently to cite
their biggest mistake, Romney replied: &quot;Probably from a political
standpoint and a personal standpoint, the greatest mistake was when I
first ran for office, being deeply opposed to abortion but saying, 'I
support the current law,' which was pro-choice and effectively a
pro-choice position. That was just wrong.&quot;

The truth is, when Romney ran for office in Massachusetts he went far
beyond saying, &quot;I support the current law.&quot;

He begged voters to accept him as an embracer of abortion rights. &quot;I
believe that abortion should be safe and legal,&quot; he said. He staked his
credentials on his mother, Lenore. He said she ran for the Senate in
1970 on an abortion-rights platform, inspired by the death of her
son-in-law's teenage sister from an illegal abortion. &quot;My mother and my
family have been committed to the belief that we can believe as we want,
but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter. And you will
not see me wavering on that,&quot; he said.

In June 2005, former Globe columnist Eileen McNamara challenged Romney's
assertion of his mother's pro-choice position. Two longtime Romney
family friends and political supporters -- former governor William
Milliken and former Republican National Committee co-chairwoman Elly
Peterson -- told McNamara they could not recall Lenore Romney speaking
out publicly for abortion. If she had, it would have represented a
dramatic change of heart and break with the Mormon Church. Peterson, who
worked on Lenore Romney's campaign, said, &quot;If it happened, I'd remember
it. It didn't and I don't.&quot; Milliken, who served as George Romney's
lieutenant governor, also expressed skepticism.

In response to the column, Romney produced a statement of his mother's
position at the time: &quot;I support and recognize the need for more liberal
abortion rights while affirming the legal and medical measures need to
protect the unborn and pregnant woman.&quot; The statement is ambiguous and
Romney never accounted for the ambiguity.
