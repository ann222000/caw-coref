good solid entertainment that has a twilight zone/trek kinda feel to it

s

It! The Terror From Beyond Space* (1958) *

*Director:* Edward L. Cahn

*Starring:* Marshall Thompson, Shirley Patterson

*Run Time:* 69 mins

*Certificate:* PG

*Plot Outline:* The first manned flight to Mars is decimated by an alien
lifeform which stows away on the ship. When a rescue ship picks up the sole
survivor, they think he has murdered the crew and don't believe his story of
the Martian. That is until the monster stows away on the rescue ship as
well.

*The Review:* Don't let the title fool you into thinking this is just some
terrible sci-fi/horror hybrid that was popular back in the 50s and 60s. It
isn't. In fact it was way ahead of its time and had so much potential to be
a true genre classic but was held back by its obvious low budget.
*Alien*took this film's concept about people being trapped in a
confined space with
an alien killing them off and gave it the budget a film like this needed
(and you can see the improved results). There is a great deal of suspense to
be had when you don't actually see what is doing the killing which helps in
the favour of low budget films sometimes. The less you see the better. For
instance, the scene inside the air vent is way ahead of its time in terms of
suspense and horror. With a bigger budget and a better looking monster, you
saw this air vent scene live up to its potential in *Alien*. The use of
lighting, shadows and smoke is also excellent so that we never really get a
good shot of the monster for quite some time and it looks scary when you do
briefly glimpse it. The monster also manages to smash down doors to add to
it's scare factor - I remember being pretty scared by this film when I was a
kid. But any suspense is more or less ruined when the monster does show
itself fully and comes out of the shadows. In its day it would probably
(ahem) have been scary and realistic. But now the monster looks terrible and
is one of the most laughable things I've ever seen and there are moments I'm
sure you can see the zipper. Another problem to which the budget didn't
stretch past was the sets - or lack of them. This is a ship with only a few
levels so anything that does get aboard isn't going to be hidden for long
and the characters aren't going to do much hiding. At only 70 minutes in
length, the film isn't too long for its own good either (it needed to be
short because I don't think I could have watched the monster act scary for
another 20 or so minutes).

*Final Verdict:* *It! The Terror from Beyond Space* looks extremely dated
now, but it still manages to deliver the goods and for it's time, it's
reasonably scary.

*Rating:*

Well, it was written by one of the guys who was a head writer for
Twilight Zone. An all time favorite of mine, and one of the main
influences on Alien.

Yeah, and as a basis for Alien I think everybody who loved that film
should see this one. kind of like an incredibly extended DVD extra: &quot;the
history of Alien.&quot;

Even on its own, though, this is pretty good, and frankly it's amazing
for a fifties sci fi movie.

Hey, who do you think would win in a fight between It, the Terror from
Beyond Space, and the Thing from Another World? Sounds like a fifties
sci-fi wrestling match.

Well, at least one or two. Of course, considering I didn't even bother
with previous Alien vs. Predator-related stuff I probably won't bother
with this one.

Anybody know anything about the Cloverleaf thing, or Greenclover, or
whatever it's called? Giant monster attacks New York? Frankly I'm no
longer teased by the trailer and I'm just sick of being manipulated.

Okay, but THEN what would happen?

Wait. Hold on a minute. Did the Thing in the original change shape? I
don't remember that. I thought it was just a guy in a rubber suit. The
Carpenter version changes shape, obviously. I'm talking about the old one.

Been about two years since I've seen it (the original). Maybe I'm wrong.
Anybody remember?

The Thing in the original short story did change shapes. Carpenter's
version is closer to the original material. The Thing in the original
movie didn't change shape, it was like a giant vegetable. No doubt
due to the inability to do the special effects required at that time
on film history. The original is still a very fine film I like as
much as Carpenter's, but it doesn't reflect the source material.

No I just collect my thoughts here keep them going. I have a BA in
Communication Arts and journalism is a skill I am credible in due to the degree. No I
only write here. But have at least one children's book coming out I think in
February. Journalism is objective thinking and anybody can do it.
