Critical massholes are like usenet trolls. They want negative attention.
They want someone to attempt to push through so they could then attack
the person's vehicle, if not the person himself.

That video is worse than looking at things through a fishbowl.

&gt; That bus driver should have leaned on his air horn, revved up his
&gt; engine, and then plowed through anyone stupid enough not to get the
&gt; fuck outta the way.

I would have on my bicycle. Since they are looking to bust up cars I
wouldn't recommend doing it with a car. The bus driver should have, but
he probably would get fired for doing so.

Simple: the people doing it would stop anyone from EVER driving if they could.

The police had better start giving 'em their just deserts before someone else
does it.

Up here in friendly, low key, P.C. Seattle, there was a much smaller,
moving group of them who blocked a couple of sheriff's deputies.
They got well beaten for it.

Wonder how many more times that guy will block an intersection.

&gt; Great story - I wish there were more like it.

&gt; I love how these CM-holes try to spin the story to make them all
&gt; appear like innocent victims of police brutality. But no amount of
&gt; spin can disguise the fact that, if they weren't illegally blocking
&gt; the intersection in the first place, none of this &quot;head cracking&quot;
&gt; would have ever occurred.

It's hard to decide who to hate, so I'll just hate them both.

&gt; Why would you hate someone who stands up to MFFY behavior? We need
&gt; more cops who will kick MFFY ass and take MFFY names, instead of
&gt; turning a blind eye to MFFY behavior.

Who stands up to the cops and their MFFY intersection behavior?

Yesterday was fun.... my light turns green, there is a cop in the left
turn lane of oncoming traffic. Cop turns right in front of me, cell phone
up to his ear. I stop and raise my hands in a WTF? gesture.  He swings a
U-turn and comes after me at 65mph in a 40. Now keep in mind, this is one
town over from where I live. The town I live in actually puts a
motorcycle cop on the sidewalk and tickets people who do what this cop
did. I've had the exact same thing happen and the motorcycle cop comes
off the sidewalk and tickets the person who turned in front of me.

So the cop huffs and puffs insisting he had a yellow arrow and telling me
to stop talking any time I try to say anything and runs my papers. Then he
comes back and huffs and puffs some more. shows his frustration asks
where I was going in such a hurry and I told him I wasn't in a hurry,
the light turned green and I went and then that's the end of it. He
clearly figured out that he was in the wrong and didn't want this in court.

Yeah... I know, I shouldn't have showed my displeasure at his piss poor
driving because he's cop. I just don't care any more, I am sick of
putting up with cops who think they are above everyone, they aren't.

'cause they're cops, who are generally the worst offenders.
