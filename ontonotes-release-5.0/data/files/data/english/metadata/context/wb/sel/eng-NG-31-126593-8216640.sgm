Dear Robert,

I was given Etoposide and Cisplatan which is pretty close to what you will be receiving.  It is what I started with and ended the treatment with.  I did not have to change, except for transfusions in between treatments.  I was also given Neulasta, and Arensep ( don't know if I spelled it right) in conjuction with the treatments.  It was bumpy but the outcome was well worth it.  It really is not an accident that I am here.  Good luck.  Moment by moment we take on what life gives us, it is a gift.  Good luck Robert.  We are all pulling for you.

Best wishes,
Audi

Audi,
Thank you for your experience. Audi, did the treatment knock you off your
feet?  Dr. Nghiem felt I would still be able to work some.  Is there a lot
of hair loss?
Thanks,
Robert

Robert,
Mu husband John tolerated the chemo, the same  meds as Audi quite well, but
he could not work for 2 weeks after the treatment. Total he was able to work
for about 1 week out of the whole month. And his job is hard physically- he
is a welder.  The third and the Fourth treatment was the worse, he was very
dehidrated after the 3rd treatment because he could not keep a drop of water
until next morning I took him to the doctor to get fluids through IVY.
He lost all of his hair, including facial hair( did not need to hsave), lost
eye brows, chest ad legs hair. He looked very pale but after a few months
ater the chemo it all came back a little darker than it was and a little
thicker.   I think at that time his doctor made a right decision, becuase of
the little spot on his liver.  Folloeing radiation treatment went easy on
him, he did not  have much of side- effects form that.

Hang in there!
Oxana

Dear Robert,

I did have difficulty with the chemo meds - the treatment set up was every 2 1/2 weeks I given the etoposide and cisplatin which would take anywhere from 5 to 7 hours.  Before each treatment began, I was given anti nausea meds, and ativan.  The ativan was for the migraine.  I also had a port in-planted before any treatments began.  The port was easier to access than the veins.  They would always call me no-vein Audi.

Like I said everyone is different and reacts differently to treatment.  I was able to tolerate the treatment but it raised hell with my blood counts and immune system.  I lost my hair after the first treatment, which lasted 3 days.  It wasn't that big a deal for me considering, I knew it would grow back and  I more than understood what I needed to do.  My counts crashed on three separate occasions and I had to be hospitalized and given blood and platelet transfusions.  We figured out regarding the nausea, I would come back to the cancer center after I completed each 3 day treatment and I was given fluids and more anti nausea drugs via the port for the next three days.  After I completed that phase I would start on the Emend capsules for more assistance with the nausea.  I was also given Nulesta and Arenesp (not sure of spelling) to help things along.

Listen, I even hate to explain the impact this all had on me, because I cannot begin to stress enough that we are all different. There are those who never or get sick  very little and some don't lose all their hair.

I was also given fluids prior to each and every treatment.  Also, while I was receiving Chemo therapy and was getting Radiation Therapy 5 days a week for 5 days.

Please don't forget, you do your part, the doctors do theirs, and God will do his.  My explanation is merely what happened and how I felt and is not to be compared but in part maybe to identify with.  Everyone is Different when it comes to their bodies handling treatment.

My oncologist was pushing for a total of 18 chemo treatments, about half way thru he was willing to change the meds, I refused.  The kidney and liver functions were not that bad, and I was half way thru - so lets do it. I tried my best not to hang on to the moments and to trust what was happening and how the process was going.  I didn't do this alone.  I just showed up and those around me helped.

Every step you take, every breath you draw is always in partnership with a spiritual source which enables you to develop that inner strength you have always had.  As time went on I was able to remove the sting from this Bully of a cancer.

The fight is for time!!  So, again, roll up your sleeves, grab what is around you especially this group, give it all you can - while you are doing this everyone here will be praying, waiting, watching, supporting all we can.  YOU Are NOT ALONE!!!  Follow the path that so many here have already taken and we will not let you down and we will all be at the other end of your treatment journey waiting.  You will be heard and we will be listening.

Best wishes and God Bless,
Audi
