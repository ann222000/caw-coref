I am sure someone has, for instance, you. Can you describe what has
happened? Include platfrom and method of setting up printing.

G'day John. Using a dual boot XP Pro and Windows Vista 64 bit with 4GB of
RAM. My CRT monitor has been accurately calibrated. I set printing up to be
totally controlled by Photoshop CS3 rather than let the epson 3800 printer
control the printing process. Correct printing paper profile setup etc.

Print output is far darker than image on the CRT monitor despite accurate
calibration with a spyder2Pro.

I have read that there is a major problem with printing from the epson 3800
printer and CS3 with both blaming each other for the problem.

Users with this problem report dark muddy looking prints that in no way
matches the screen image.

Cheers

Ron

Just a thought, sure it's not a Gamma problem?
PC's, Mac OS-X, Adobe, and Epson not singing from the same

What paper profile are you using? I have an R 1800 and have found for the
best results, I use Premium Glossy as my default. When I use Luster, Matte
or other papers, I too get a darker, muddier look.

While this might not explain why, I now am getting what I see on my
calibrated monitor.

Thanks Steve that is also the same paper profile I am using but still having
problems. There is a known problem between some epson printers and adobe
photoshop CS3 - there is a very heated adobe forum with many people
attacking adobe about the problem and telling them to sort it out quick
smart. Adobe blames epson and epson blames adobe.

Cheers

I was aware that there was this &quot;He said - She said&quot; tiff between Adobe and
Epson.

At least for my system, doing it the way I've described, my photos are
coming out well and accurate.
