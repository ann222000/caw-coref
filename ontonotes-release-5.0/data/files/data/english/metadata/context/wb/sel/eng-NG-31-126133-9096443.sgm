As always with &quot;Bleach&quot;, the episode title is not provided during the
episode only the number.  We know from last week's preview that the title
of episode 140 is &quot;Urquiola's Strategem: When the Sun Sinks&quot; (Sakubou no
Urukiora: Taiyou ga Shizumu Toki&quot; - 策謀のウルキオラ、太陽が沈む時).

For those who are interested in the relationship between the anime and the
manga, we're now up to volume 27 of the manga - a Tankoubon with the
English title in lowercase letters, &quot;goodbye halcyon days&quot;.  Episode 140
recounts the first three chapters from that volume:  Ch 234 - Not
Negotiation, Ch 235 - The Frozen Clutch, and Ch 236 - The Sun Already Gone
Down.  The first half of chapter 234 was covered, though, in the previous
episode.

The titles of those three chapters are in English as are most of the title
chapters in the Bleach manga.  In fact, when occasionally a chapter title
in Japanese appears in the serialized Weekly Shonen Jump version, it
usually (if not always) is changed to English in the Tankoubon.  In
contrast, the anime episode titles are in Japanese as you can see from the
title of this episode.

Orihime is the volume 27 cover character.  She is the only character
besides Ichigo who has appeared on the front cover of more than one
tankoubon.  Orihime was first featured on the front of volume 3 around the
time she first appeared in the story.  Her reappearance on a front cover
marks the central role she will play in the next story arc.

Orihime is not the only one who is becoming a more central figure.
Although we don't yet know where Urquiola stands in the Arrancar hierarchy,
he seems to enjoy Aizen's special confidence perhaps even more so than
Arrancar who might 'outrank' him.  As the title implies, he is a
strategist.  He approaches the mission at hand dispassionately - devising
the most effective and efficient strategem to accomplish it:

Episode 140 ups the intensity.  We get some very good fighting as we see
some cool reversals in the action.

Last episode, we had seen Urahara arrive in the nick of time to thwart
Lupi's attack only to be blindsided by Wanderwice Margiela.  Wanderwice
appears simple and innocent but is capable of wielding tremendous power.
At present, we don't know much about him.

Back to this episode, the unruffled Urahara appears more curious than
perturbed about Wanderwice's attack which he says he has never seen before.
After Wanderwice had done the hard work, the more -brawn-than-brains Yammy
steps in and begins to pulverize him with an energy attack called 'bala'.

In the manga (chapter 234), this particular Arrancar attack is written in
kanji 虚弾 with katakana phonetics indicating it is to be pronounced 'bara'.
The first kanji means empty or hollow and is the kanji used to depict
hollows.  The second kanji means bullet.  Thus, we understand its meaning
to be a bullet used by a hollow.  In Japanese, the kanji would normally be
pronounced as 'kyodan'.  However, the manga gives us the reading of 'bara'.
Since the Arrancar powers have Spanish names, we know that the Japanese
katakana バラ (bara) is a transliteration for the Spanish word for bullet -
bala.

As Yammy pulverizes Urahara, he explains what the bala attack is.  Arrancar
can harden their reiatsu and can use it in machine gun fashion twenty times
faster than the more powerful 'cero' blasts we had seen in previous
episodes.

Meanwhile, Lupi has failed to impress or intimidate Rangiku.  She cuts off
his drivel, berating him by saying she hates guys who talk too much.  Lupi
doesn't get it and jabbers on about how she's in no position to talk since
he's got the upper hand.  FAmous last words.  Before he completes his
threat to administer the coup de grace; in one of several great reversals
of this episode, Hitsugaya deep freezes Lupi and all his appendages with a
spectacular Zanpakutou attack.  Hitusgaya adomonishes Lupi saying he was
too laid back having rested on his laurels after only one attack.  He
rhetorically asks him if he's not familiar with the term of keeping one's
guard up.  Hitsugaya then finishes Lupi off by engulphing him in a glacier.

Lupi isn't the only blowhard.  It turns out that Yammy's attacks were
ineffective against Urahara.  After he accuses Urahara of being an idiot
and starts to say something about [smashing him to] smithereens, an
untouched Urahara appears and easily counters with the crimson blade of his
zanpakutou.  The next time, Yammy tries to use his bala, Urahara nullifies
it with a cool move - casually touching Yammy's fist with the tip of his
sword.

Meanwhile, after starting out strong last episode, Ichigo has lost the
powers of his inner hollow and is having a hard time of it.  But, just as
Grimjaw prepares to deliver the fatal blow, we get yet another cool
reversal.  We hear Rukia say, &quot;Tsugi no Mai: Hakuren&quot; (Ensuing Dance:
White rippling waves).  We recall that this is the second technique of
Rukia's zanpakutou, Sode no Shirayuki (Sleeve of Snow).

It's nice to see Rukia save Ichigo for a change.  She seals Grimjaw within
a huge wave of ice.  Unfortunately, Grimjaw is incapacitated only shortly.
While Rukia is preoccupied with removing Grimjaw's sword that has impaled
Ichigo's hand, Grimjaw breaks free and prepares to fire a Cero blast point
blank at Rukia.

In the nick of time, Rukia is saved by the unexpected appearance of Shinji
(the Vizard that looks like Beavis of &quot;Beavis and Butthead&quot;).  Up till now,
Shinji has been more like Lupi or Yammy, talking big but with little to
show for it.  Nevertheless, after Shinji dons his Vizard mask, he quickly
gets Grimjaw on the defensive.  Shinji's cero blasts are more powerful than
Grimjaw's and one nearly destroys him.  Barely able to move, Grimjaw has no
other recourse against his more powerful opponent than to draw his
zanpakutou.  However, before he can draw it, Urquiola - moving faster than
the eye can follow - stays his hand.  He tells Grimjaw that their assigned
task has been accomplished and that they're heading home.

Urquiola activates a Negación field around each of the Arrancar.  As soon
as the field is activated, the target is shielded from harm.  Thus, Lupi,
Yammy, and Grimjaw are immediately extricated from the predicaments they
are in and return with Urquiola and Wanderwice to Hueco Mundo.

Urquiola is the last to disappear.  As he's disappearing, he notes that
Ichigo has attained some new powers.  He goes on to note that at that level
it won't make a difference.  He says, &quot;This is the end.  There's already no
way out for all of you.  The sun, too, has already sunk within our grasp.&quot;
We see Orihime with her back to us set against the healing shield she had
created last episode.  It glows like a setting sun.

To be continued:

Impressions:

This was an action-packed episode that had some very cool reversals and
some great 'famous last words' just before the reversals.  However, in the
end, I have to agree with Ayasegawa's observation, &quot;This is not a beautiful
outcome.&quot;  Urquiola is completely focused at the task at hand and does not
allow distractions to enter into his calculations.  As soon as he completes
the task Aizen had assigned him, he pulls the plug and everybody vanishes.
The fighting has just been a tactical distraction so Urquiola could get to
Orihime.  It would have been nice to have seen Grimjaw release his
zanpakutou.  That would have forced Shinji into invoking bankai and then we
would have seen some real fire works.

We feel a little cheated.  The good guys had got the better of the bad
guys.  However, a decisive victory alludes them.  Hitsugaya observes that
things are only going to get more troublesome from this point on.  Of
course, we know that a decisive victory can't come with Ichigo on the
sidelines.  This confrontation merely sets the stage for the next arc - the
Hueco Mundo arc - that will start after a few transition episodes.
