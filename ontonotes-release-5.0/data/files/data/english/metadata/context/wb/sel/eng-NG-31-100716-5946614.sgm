Here's a photo taken by an anonymous patriot of Bush shortly after he parachuted
from one of the planes that hit the towers.

Renowned expert Alex Jones of www.prisonplanet.com has certified this picture as
being an authentic photo of
Bush in a flight suit just after a flying.

ABC 9/11 MOVIE SHOWS CLINTONS DESTROYING WORLD TRADE CENTER
“It’s very common to boil down many real life people to one character in a movie,”
ABC president Steve McPherson said in response to the criticisms. “We simply
thought it would be too confusing to have all the different people responsible
for 9/11 in our film, we combined them all into one composite character
named William Jefferson Clinton.”

Even as wave after wave of terror appear over the horizon, why are the LIBs oddly unconcerned?
The only thing necessary for Evil to prosper is for Good Men to do Absolutely Nothing.
What have you done today to deserve your freedom?

A LIBs ceaseless quest for the unearned remains
ceaseless because a Value illicitly obtained
retains no value...

This is Clinton's Bridge to the 21st Century.

"to leave now we would send a message to terrorists
and other potential adversaries around the world that
they can change our policies by killing our people.
It would be open season on Americans."
-- Bill Clinton '93
just before he pulled out of Somalia.

It is amazing how many LIBs will read 1000pages of Clinton's 'My Life'
but refuse to acknowledge the facts of the 911 report;
LIB denial is an essential part of their syndrome.

it would be wrong to cut off contact with the terror group just because
they may have killed people "in a way that we hate."
-- Bill Clinton'06

“Iran is the only country in the world that has now had six elections since the
first election of President Khatami (in 1997). (It is) the only one with elections,
including the United States, including Israel, including you name it, where the liberals,
or the progressives, have won two-thirds to 70 percent of the vote in six elections:
Two for president; two for the Parliament, the Majlis; two for the mayoralties.
In every single election, the guys I identify with got two-thirds to 70 percent of the vote.
There is no other country in the world I can say that about, certainly not my own.”
-- Bill Clinton'05

I tried to represent a better America when I was president.
But now I don't have to...
-- Bill Clinton'06

Why won't Clinton openly acknowledge and disclose his meetings with Ahmadinejad?
What is he ashamed of? Why not let the world know what an Arch-Traitor he is?
Let the LIBs once again, tolerate the intolerable, defend the indefensible...
The mind of Clinton Evil knows no rest, especially now...
His is a betrayal most foul, and it is NOT over yet.

Bill Clinton failed to prevent 9/11
..
In his insufferable 957-page autobiography, "My Life,"
former President Bill Clinton devotes a total of four paragraphs
to the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993.
..
The attacks of 9/11 were successful because our enemies saw weakness in Bill Clinton
..
The path to 9/11 was clearly delineated for anyone willing to pay attention.
It was Bill Clinton's job to connect the dots and respond accordingly to
protect American lives. Clinton failed us.

On Feb. 26, 1993, during the second year of Clinton's presidency,
a powerful bomb exploded in a parking garage under the World Trade Center.
..
On Oct. 3, 1993, 19 Americans died and 84 were wounded in an ill-planned mission to Somalia
..
On Nov. 13, 1995, five Americans were killed when a bomb exploded at a U.S.... in Riyadh.

In February 1996, the government of Sudan offered to turn over Osama bin Laden
and his top al-Qaida lieutenants to the United States. Bill Clinton passed up a chance
...
In June 1996, 19 Air Force personnel were killed and 300 Americans and others were wounded
when terrorists drove a truck full of explosives into the Khobar Towers,
..
The Taliban came to power during the Clinton administration, capturing Kabul,
the capital of Afghanistan, in September 1996. The Taliban would offer sanctuary to
bin Laden and his terrorist network.

Powerful bombs destroyed the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya on Aug. 7, 1998,
killing 257 people, including 12 Americans, and injuring 4,500 others.
..
On Oct. 12, 2000, the USS Cole was attacked in the port of Aden in Yemen.
..
History has been far too kind to Bill Clinton.
..
We need to think long and hard about the future of this country, especially now that
Hillary Clinton is promising to bring back the "Clinton years" as she prepares to run
for president in 2008. Are you willing to put your life on the line under another Clinton presidency?

I remember Judas, that was Bill Clinton,
He was the one elected President before he
Disgraced his Office and betrayed us ALL, and
he did it simply because he could, because he could force us to watch.

of the Five things that Clinton factually did do:

1. Grant Clemency to convicted terrorists who Murdered American Citizens.
2. Vandalize the White House
3. Dare us to stop him.
4. Trust our Adversaries so much he sent them Nuclear Blueprints
5. Find it intolerable to trust you child with soda, candy bars and M&amp;M's in school,
classifying them as 'harmful' and banning them from schools...

Such inventive humor. both you guys in group together?
I frankly think Alex Jones is a Jackass, but the 911 expose is a
democratic movement, and we cant stop him from claiming the mantle even
tho he exaggerates so much it supports the Big Media view of 911.

But I am content to wait to see if the new congress will call
Silverstein into a hearing and explain why he should not be charged with
arson on an insurance scam that made him 7 billion.

Don't hold your breath. The real world doesn't really care too much
about your kook theories and other nonsense, like the Silverstein
comment above. You even thinking that arson/insurance scam shit is true
is pretty whacked out. Goes along with the "Pulled" madness I guess.

And of course, that doesn't surprise me...

And I'm all for another investigation, as long as you kooks pay for it,

Read Machiavelli. We are at the stage to "discover his faults."
Partisan supporters like yourself are already falling away in droves.

You mite benefit from the psychological studies of group think as well.
People will believe the most outlandish bullschitt about what is in
front of their very eyes if they believe that's the way that most others
see them. Big Media characterized 911 for sheeple.

But now, we are at the 'emperor's new clothes', and your response is to
say that those who are paying attention are deluded.

I frankly dont if the electorate will wake up to reality. False flag
events often dont get discovered until decades later. its only been in
recent times that the "Gulf of Tonkin" and the sinking of the Maine in
Havana harbor were exposed. But not, the Net is speeding this kind of
thing up as well.

BDK. I'm the one with the psychology degree that has worked in clinical
settings. And the general run of unwarranted dismissiveness about 911
fits the limited composing characteristics of mental patients. Granted
that there are some 911 ranters out there, but the websites have been
put together very professionally by people who understand the ambiguity
of the situation we have now, and the lack of logic in the original 911
commission report.

However, I am concerned that this whole thing could spin out of control
and cause a financial panic on Wall Street. But congress moves with much
slower deliberation than the Net. Have it your way. Either we will wait
to see what congressional hearings produce, which will be dribbled out a
little at a time like Watergate, or we will see it go on on the Net,
where damn near any idea can gain credence among sheeple, and the whole
situation get economically unstable over nite.

Telling it to go away wont work.

OK. Your mind is made up, you dont need facts.

But either we will have a congressional hearing, which will be slow and

time to think more clearly about what happened, as at Watergate... Or,
we will do it on the Net, at modern communication speed, and there is no
way that you or those you admire in government can control it.

If you know anything about software and the interface, and then visit
both the debunker sites and the expose sites, it becomes clear what the
professional hackers think. They are already having fun with 911, and
would just love it if the government and Big Media tried to keep a lid
on the truth about 911. Exposing the lies empowers the hackers.

Big Media is like the Junker family, that owned all the newspapers in
Germany, and thot they could control any demagogue. But then some arose
who figured out how to exploit the new media of radio and movies. So
now, Vandar, there is another new media. You are looking at it, and the

All that awaits now are the demagogues who know how to use it, and the

Been there.
The conspiracists like to claim that the building collapses somehow
violated the laws of physics (they don't demonstrate how) and that
controlled demolition is the ONLY explanation for observed events.

Unless they are ready to admit that the collapses did not violate
physics, they are claiming that controlled demolition does.

Yes... that is the psychology of the conspiracy theorist; An amateur

Deluded, ignorant, gullible, whatever, it seems to have the same result:
Believing in things that are impossible, extremely unlikely, or just so
far out there, they might as well be impossible. One of the things I

then there's the thermite..but the obsession with Silverstein and

When I was in school, "Plate tectonics" was a crank theory. When I began
taking psych in college, I looked up the early theories. 100 years ago,
the experts were saying that masturbation caused insanity. 80 years ago,
they said that premarital sex caused bad marriages. During WWII, they
were treating what we now call "Post Traumatic Stress" with aspirin and
sending them back to the front. 40 years ago, they were saying that
autism was caused by erratic mothering (we now have the DNA markers).

20 years ago, they were saying they could cure homosexuality (but now we
have the bloodwork and see the abnormal hormones). So, I ask myself,
what is it now that the experts are claiming that is bullschitt?

"conspiracy" could use some definition. Was it a conspiracy when the
media took everything that Goldwater said out of context to get LBJ
elected? Or- was it just 'group think'?

Goldwater, unlike LBJ or Bush, said either allocate the necessary
resources to win the damn war, or get the fuck out.

So, later on, I was one of the 70 on the Federal courthouse steps
demonstrating against the Vietnam war, because I knew it was a lost
cause that was just getting soldiers killed. And when I saw the local TV
cameras there, I wondered what would be on the evening news.

Sure enough, they showed us, and said that '70 people demonstrated at
the Federal courthouse.' But they *never* turned the camera to show the
street full of 4000 more who would not fit on the courthouse steps. So,
I didnt think TV media has changed, and took an interest in what kind of
spin they would put on 911.

Now, you can listen to the voice over, or- you can listen to the people
who were actually there. The editing and script writing of the voice
over began almost immediately. BUT- they didnt see the Net coming, and
didnt realize all the people who were there with *their own cameras*
recording what the people who were there actually said, that you never
saw on the Big Media TV news.

And all those people like me, who were pissed about it wanted to do
something. There was nothing I could do about the misrepresentation of
the demonstrations I took part in. But after 2001, there were enough
computers, wired up to the Net, and enough webmasters who were willing
to look and listen to what the real witnesses to 911 had to say.

You dont care? that's your problem. Sure, lotsa webmasters are whackos.
But they have also learned how to produce professional looking video,
and along with the voice over and audio of the people *who were actually
there*, are challenging the Big Media spin about 911, and that whole
scam is slowly coming apart.

I dunno if it will have an effect on the electorate yet. But if not, a
new 911 investigation will go on, online, driven by hackers who know how
to work the networks better than the Big Media spin meisters do. That'll
make more problems for the Powers That Be than they ever imagined.

Had there been a 'pancake' collapse like the 911 commission said, then
the stack of collapsed floors hasta impact the next lower floor. But
just like driving a car thru the woods knocking down saplings, each hit
is felt in the driver's seat. And why? because the *speed* is reduced by
the impact of each tree. Course, if you keep your foot on the gas, you
accelerate again, til you hit the next one.

So, as a stack of collapsed floors comes down the impact of each floor
would slow the whole stack down by fraction of a second. And if it does
this thru 100 hundred floors, those fractions would add up. They dont.

And that aint what the video shows us. The rate of fall is continuous,
and even when you slow the video down, you dont see any reduction in the
rate of fall from hitting the next lower floor. The *reason* you dont,
is that by then, that floor has already been pulverized by explosives.
Some of the frames show debris from these explosions blowing out the
windows *before* the floor gets hit by the stack.

Maybe this does not convince you. Be that as it may, consider the mind

time it is slowed down and even freeze framed while the voice over
explains the physics that seems to escape your understanding. We will
see whether enough voters get it to install a congress that wants some
rational answers about questions that have arisen since the commission
issued its report. Which many professional engineers and architects have
said was not adequate.

What's going on is a change in the national group think that the Jews
who run Big Media never imagined would happen cause it never occurred to
them that someone would slow down the video for a closer look at it.

I have no idea what part, if any, Bush played in all this. Its hard to

did not have a clue. But the place to start asking is Silverstein. No
doubt, all the anti-Semites in this country would love to see this

Some of these "squibs" are something like 20 floors below the
collapse.  NIST explains these as air escaping due to the pressure of
the collapse.  How did air travel 20 storeys down and go out the side
of the building so quickly?  If the only explanation for these
"squibs" is explosives, then they constitute proof, not just evidence,
of explosives.

SNAP! I wonder if it is something in the developer mindset - e.g. a
refusal to accept on trust that which can be verified and, dare I say
it, a slightly more logical thought process, or at least more practise
in using logic on a daily basis,  than some other disciplines -  that

lol
I think the latter might be more accurate.

Honestly, I attribute it to analytical thinking, rather than thinking in
the visual. As developers, we need to break each aspect down into core
components, create them, and then assemble those components in a way
that makes a functional whole for the client (or employer). If any one
of those components fails, the whole package fails (and you get a
million phone calls about the "bug"), so we need to make sure that every
piece of the puzzle fits.
It's the same method I employ with the conspiracy theories. The
conspiracists claim that "the guvmint did it" based on X, Y, and Z.
If just "Y" is proven wrong, then the theory doesn't work, as X and Z
alone aren't enough to formulate an accurate conclusion.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The conspiracists like to claim that the building collapses somehow
&gt; &gt;&gt; violated the laws of physics (they don't demonstrate how) and that
&gt; &gt;&gt; controlled demolition is the ONLY explanation for observed events.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Unless they are ready to admit that the collapses did not violate
&gt; &gt;&gt; physics, they are claiming that controlled demolition does.
&gt; &gt;What you say violates the laws of logic by not representing what was
&gt; &gt;said correctly, ie, a strawman.

&gt; &gt;Maybe you werent paying attention when you visited one of the websites
&gt; &gt;like http://loosechange911.com or didnt want to. or were getting coffee
&gt; &gt;when it was explained. We dont have the video here, but I'll try.

&gt; &gt;Had there been a 'pancake' collapse like the 911 commission said, then
&gt; &gt;the stack of collapsed floors hasta impact the next lower floor. But
&gt; &gt;just like driving a car thru the woods knocking down saplings, each hit
&gt; &gt;is felt in the driver's seat. And why? because the *speed* is reduced by
&gt; &gt;the impact of each tree. Course, if you keep your foot on the gas, you
&gt; &gt;accelerate again, til you hit the next one.

&gt; &gt;So, as a stack of collapsed floors comes down the impact of each floor
&gt; &gt;would slow the whole stack down by fraction of a second. And if it does
&gt; &gt;this thru 100 hundred floors, those fractions would add up. They dont.

&gt; &gt;And that aint what the video shows us. The rate of fall is continuous,
&gt; &gt;and even when you slow the video down, you dont see any reduction in the
&gt; &gt;rate of fall from hitting the next lower floor. The *reason* you dont,
&gt; &gt;is that by then, that floor has already been pulverized by explosives.
&gt; &gt;Some of the frames show debris from these explosions blowing out the
&gt; &gt;windows *before* the floor gets hit by the stack.

&gt; Some of these &quot;squibs&quot; are something like 20 floors below the
&gt; collapse.  NIST explains these as air escaping due to the pressure of
&gt; the collapse.  How did air travel 20 storeys down and go out the side
&gt; of the building so quickly?  If the only explanation for these
&gt; &quot;squibs&quot; is explosives, then they constitute proof, not just evidence,
&gt; of explosives.
">

OMFG, do you think before you post stuff like "How did air travel 20
stories (fixed your spelling) down.." Don't you understand there is air
on every floor, and it pushes down on air below it? Think of a train, if
you push on one end of a 10 car train, the slack compresses, and the
other end moves!

&gt; &gt;Maybe this does not convince you. Be that as it may, consider the mind
&gt; &gt;of the voter who sees the very same video he's seen on FOX, but this
&gt; &gt;time it is slowed down and even freeze framed while the voice over
&gt; &gt;explains the physics that seems to escape your understanding. We will
&gt; &gt;see whether enough voters get it to install a congress that wants some
&gt; &gt;rational answers about questions that have arisen since the commission
&gt; &gt;issued its report. Which many professional engineers and architects have
&gt; &gt;said was not adequate.

&gt; &gt;What's going on is a change in the national group think that the Jews
&gt; &gt;who run Big Media never imagined would happen cause it never occurred to
&gt; &gt;them that someone would slow down the video for a closer look at it.

&gt; &gt;I have no idea what part, if any, Bush played in all this. Its hard to
&gt; &gt;imagine that Cheney, as connected as he is with intelligence services,
&gt; &gt;did not have a clue. But the place to start asking is Silverstein. No
&gt; &gt;doubt, all the anti-Semites in this country would love to see this
&gt; &gt;arsonist crucified. And no doubt, a new congress that got elected
&gt; &gt;despite the negatives for the major party leadership, will be happy to
&gt; &gt;do their will. Then we'll see who Silverstein fingers.

You are truly deranged. Silverstein has done nothing wrong in any way,
and there's not even the slightest, most minuscule bit of evidence that
he did..

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've already burned you, crisp.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Faaaar from it, paris.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not surprised you're too stupid to realise it - but lets just keep

&gt; &gt; Look, moron... I am not the stupid dickhead here. YOU is, paris.
&gt; &gt; And you know it. But, teaming up with Vandar or BDK has clouded

&gt; &gt; How fucking typical of lying hypocrites...

&gt; The lying hypocrite would be the one who makes assertions without

Sorry, paris... you can keep your 'evidence' for yourself.

After all, that 'evidence' is no evidence at all.

Now then, what specific manouvers did Hanjour make that you

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;But now, we are at the 'emperor's new clothes', and your response is to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;say that those who are paying attention are deluded.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes... that is the psychology of the conspiracy theorist; An amateur
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; investigator who has discovered the knowledge missed by all the experts. The
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conspiracy theorist believes he will save the masses by showing them that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which they cannot see without his keen powers of insight and investigation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This delusion of grandeur, more than anything else, is indicative of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conspiracy theorists mental state.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I was in school, &quot;Plate tectonics&quot; was a crank theory. When I began
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taking psych in college, I looked up the early theories.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;They laughed at Colombus, the laughed at Einstein. But they also

Yes, I'm aware you have no evidence.

No that would be you. You're the one asserting his manouvers were
"impossible". I'm just asking (as a PPL holder with moderate
experience) what was impossible about them?

Well, unlike you I haven't lied about anything, DeMenses.
