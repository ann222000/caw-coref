Chuck Borden is right about one thing.

A stunt like rappelling by rope or taking a fall looks a lot tougher just
before launch than it does from the ground.

&quot;All of a sudden they get up 30 feet and that bag doesn't look so big
anymore,&quot; says Borden, a long time Hollywood stuntman, describing the doubts and
adrenaline that build up just before someone launches himself from a ledge.

Borden hopes he's right about another thing.

That is, Las Vegas tourists and conventioneers will be willing to spend $400
or more to experience that rush through performing stunts like being hit by a
car, taking a midair plunge and attaching themselves to a cable to fly through
a studio.

Borden's Stunt World Action Camp is part of a trend of experience-style
attractions for tourists like flying weightless in a modified jet or driving a
stock car on a racetrack.

&quot;After a handful of days gambling, unless you are a professional gambler, you
are looking for something else to do,&quot; said Borden, who has nearly 200 stunt
credits dating back to 1984 that include stunts in everything from the 1980s
cop show &quot;Hunter,&quot; starring Fred Dryer to the 2007 comedy film &quot;Reno 911!:
Miami.&quot;

These days, when Borden isn't being lighted on fire or standing in front of a
moving car he's preparing to show other people how they can do the same thing
-- under more confined circumstances, of course.

Borden estimates he's already spent about $25,000 of his own money on the
stunt camp, which he plans to launch for the media today and begin holding
sessions for tourists next month.

By the time the camp is fully operational he estimates he'll have put in
about $250,000.

And he's confident he'll make it back $400 at a time.

&quot;This is the perfect thing because it is so unique,&quot; said Borden, who hopes
to market to tourists, corporate visitors and people in town for conventions
who want to do something memorable for clients, employees or themselves.

&quot;Most people will go out to dinner or go bowling; it is the same old stuff.
There isn't anything like this,&quot; Borden said.

After short courses on how the stunts work customers will get outfitted with
equipment and have the chance to perform. Borden and other working stunt
people will act as instructors.

The camp will operate from Dream Vision studios, 6705 S. Eastern Ave., near
McCarran International Airport.

A half-day program includes three courses, a full-day program costs $725 and
there are plans for a car chase program for $1,150.

The stunt camp is one of several experience-style attractions around Las
Vegas. The most hyped addition to the market in recent months came in April, when
Zero Gravity Corp. launched at McCarran. The company flies passengers who pay
$3,500 each in modified 727s that use airborne maneuvers to create the
sensation of weightlessness in the cabin.

At the Las Vegas Motor Speedway visitors pay anywhere from $99 to $2,499 for
varying levels of access to ride in or drive stock cars on the track.

&quot;People are looking for something new and outside your typical 'get on a tour
bus' type of thing,&quot; said Cynthia Guerrero, a sales executive for Activity
Planners, a destination management company in Las Vegas. &quot;That is definitely
something we would like to try.&quot;

Activity Planners specializes in lining up activities for corporate and
incentive groups.

Guerrero said she's familiar with Borden's plans but it's too early to tell
if it is something that will take hold with many visitors. She said pricing,
availability and the willingness of Stunt Camp operators to be flexible to
groups' needs will make that determination.

Borden said his camp aims to tap into visitors' demand for action as well the
desire to get experience in an element of the film industry.

&quot;Everybody always has a little bit of a wild side to them,&quot; said Borden, who
added there will be plenty of opportunity for visitors to have their picture
taken performing the stunts. &quot;And of course, everybody likes to brag.&quot;
