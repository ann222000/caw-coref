Strange, I've been looking for another C3, money is not the problem. Finding
one that is worth a Fig and priced appropriately is the problem. Do you have
any idea how many "rare" Corvettes were built, ALL OF THEM. I can wait till
next winter if I need to, I'm just not going to pay a bloated price.

In discussions in other groups and with other people, the consensus is that
a large chunk of the reason is the Barrett Jackson auctions. People watch a
car go out for $50,000 and say, hey, I got one of those in the weeds in the
back 40.  Maybe if I get a Maaco paint job on it, and use some Armor All on
the dash and seats, I can sell mine for $40,000.

Unfortunately, Paul didn't show us his car, but the basic statement of
needing some TLC means that it probably needs a bunch of work to be really
nice.  And those are everywhere at $3000-$5000.  So his at $5500 is not a
quick sale.

That is because too many equate "college degree" with "knowledge and
ability".

There is a big spread in pay for college degree and non-degree, yet often,
far too often, the learning curve on the college degree person if more than
the non-degree person.  So companies pay more for people who are less
productive in the first few years.  This was not a big deal when companies
hired people and 10 or 20 years later, they still worked there, but today,
many are lucky to hit 5 years.  In fact, 5 year employees are often
celebrated like a huge milestone.

And realistically, if you really stop and look at your job or jobs of those
around you, did they learn that in school or did they learn that on the job?
Most learned on the job.  I also worked fulltime when I was in college and
the school lagged the company in technology by about 5 years.  What was
really bad were things like wanting you to know things and figure things out
that took hours to do when you could look it up in 5 minutes.  The real job
was about building on existing knowledge in 10 minutes and moving on to
something more advanced.  School concentrated on the learning at each step
so much, they were left behind.

It is what a friend calls "chainsaw mentality".  Let's say you are building
a fence. You can carefully measure and cut each board by hand for great
accuracy and take 5 minutes a board.  Or you can stack 10 boards up, pull
out the chainsaw, and cut them all off in 2 minutes.  Even if the chainsaw
isn't as accurate, you have a result, and then you can clean it up where
needed.  The first method takes 50 minutes to get started. The other you are
started and doing refinement at 3 minutes.

In the real world, 47 minutes defines companies that are growing and making
money and companies that the stock has plummeted and are hoping someone will
buy them out.

Donald Trump's The Apprentice is running this scenario right now.

Have you been watching ebay lately?  Here is one of those crazy projects.

http://cgi.ebay.com/ebaymotors/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;rd=1&amp;item=45...

Or search for item  4523866776.

He has it starting at $28,000 and needs everything, including the frame.
His logic is that it will cost you $25,000 and so you will have a fully
restored Barrett Jackson equivalent Corvette for $53,000.  Unfortunately,
many will believe that.

Unfortunately, there are enough out there that the guy might get it, based
on how this '64 project is up to $21,000.

i don't know, where was he stating it was rare and why you were thinking it
was bloated ? ~ maybe due to location. ?Do you guys have a bunch out that
way ?  Here in Wis a $5500 Vette seems like a great price to me, almost a
steal, if it is in pretty decent shape.  In top end shape they are selling
over $11k here for a 75 and a bit more for a 74.

I'd still have to see his pics.. I'll reserve full judgement on the steal at
$5500.  It could be a bucket of bolts and leaking badly thus not worth $1k
let alone $5k

I guess it's because I wasn't replying to the OP but more to the process of

You're right on Tom, I watched Barrett Jackson auctions the other night and
it is a joke. Being from a family of auctioneers and having started working
auctions when I was 14 I tend to avoid them. My Dad, an auctioneer since
before I was born, used to say that "all it takes to make an auction work
was one dishonest auctioneer and one bidder".

Well you can say what you want: I spent the past summer living in my moving
van &amp; had to sell my Cabriolet (which took forever &amp; I finally had to
settle for trading for a non-running Fiero &amp; getting just 2 grand boot) in
order to build a 16 x 16 loft in my storage building/shop to stay warm this
winter. I've been trying to get work (doing *quality* - SHOW quality if you
want it - paint jobs) for the past 9 months &amp; have several folks that
*want* me to do it but none of them have the money to do *anything* right
now. My best friend lost his job, his home, &amp; everything he couldn't put
here at my place &amp; in a 10 x 10 storage building &amp; is now homeless.
Yeah - the economy is GREAT!!!!

A "B" or "C" grade '64 fuelie with non-matching wouldn't be worth $28k?
I do agree the guy is certainly dreaming - it would be near impossible
to build this car back to "original" condition. Finding or modifying all
the dated parts would be quite a task.

I do find the 4:11 rear and radio delete rather interesting - only 1325
fuelies were built, only 1295 were radio delete.

* Note the side exhaust - are there any cases of very late '64s
appearing with factory side exhaust? Upon closer inspection of the
serial # (unit #5937, November '63) it's not late at all in the model
year so the exhaust was almost certainly customer added.

* The distributor number (1111070) is applicable to late '64s, not early
in the run as this car is.

* The paint code (936) indicates the car was originally Ermine White.

* Unfortunately it's no "heater delete" car (one of 60) - then he might
have something. (Also, couldn't see well enough into the rear
compartment to see if there was a suspiciously raised floor... if so,
whoooowaaaa!)

I've also quoted as low as $1,200 for a BMW. Keep in mind I use *quality*

So what is the issue, if you are good &amp; inexpensive (different then
cheap) why aren't you getting work?  Is it your geographical location,
advertising, contacts or what?  If you ever want help getting your
business up running &amp; thriving let me know and I'll help you with a
business plan.

My previous point; there is no money in this economy. These folks are all
close by (or fairly so). In the past I've had folks bring cars from as far
away as Ohio (I'm in Ga.) for me to paint them.
Of course, there *are* folks with money, but they're not auto enthusiasts
(apparently) &amp; BTW don't give a ~(&lt;`) about other folks if my website
Screwed By insurance is any indication. BTW it will be back up soon.

It is hard to judge a car when all they say is that it needs TLC and they
need $5500 out of it, but usually if they have $8000 in and have to get
$5500 out, then they are still deep into project mode.  Odds are they have
hit the point that they will have to pile in several thousand more or bail
out now.

TLC used to mean tender loving care, and that some elbow grease cleaning the
car or polishing would make it look nice.  Today, TLC means it has been
ridden hard and put up wet, so you probably need a new interior to ever be
nice again.  Figure $1000 - $1500.

Paint is usually dead, if they say TLC, otherwise he would have said "paint
is great" or "paint is new".  We have been down the road on paint, figuring
$4000 average of a good Corvette paint job for the average owner.

So at $5500 + $1000 + $4000 you are $10,500 and you can get a very nice '74
for that and drive it home and whether you want to go, rather than spend
like crazy, work like crazy, and have your wife/girlfriend/parents/etc think
you are nuts for the next 6 months to a year.

Sad, but the mid '70s cars just don't have the market price.

it
&gt; was bloated ? ~ maybe due to location. ?Do you guys have a bunch out that

&gt; over $11k here for a 75 and a bit more for a 74.

&gt; I'd still have to see his pics.. I'll reserve full judgement on the steal
at
&gt; $5500.  It could be a bucket of bolts and leaking badly thus not worth $1k

Unfortunately, with midyears running $40,000-$60,000 restored NOM, the guy
isn't that far off.  However, it really isn't worth it since prices are
elevated right now in part due to Barrett Jackson.  They were come back down
probalby in 3-4 months some.  Not a lot, but probably 10% or so.

His big flaws are the assumption of restoring it for $25,000.  If you do all
your own work and charge nothing for your labor, maybe.  But a good
restoration is roughly $25,000 for the restoration on a COMPLETE car and
including very few parts.  Any big dollar parts and any rare parts raise the
bar considerably, not just the price of the part, but the time/effort for
finding the part and then any work needed on the part.  Heck, I can se we
need a frame, fuel injection unit, and the FI air cleaner so we are in the
$12,000 in parts area already with three parts.  Restoration on this car
will easily hit the $40,000 price tag, added to the $28,000 initial price,
and you are $68,000 for a restored NOM car.  And then there is the year to
two years to complete it.

Better to take your money out and buy something for $40,000 to $60,000 today
outright and drive it next week in the nice weather.

This is a Barrett Jackson candidate, in 3 to 4 years.  Buy it for too much,
spend too much to restore, and then wait for some drunk sports professional

Out of curiosity, what would you paint a midyear coupe for?  On that already
had the bumpers off, trim off, etc.  Down to the original red primer/sealer.

Naturally, I know that until you spray a coat across, you may not see half
the waves in the body, but just a ballpark.

*Really* need to see the car. If you're looking for a show quality job,
getting rid of *all* the waves (even the original factory ones), it won't
be cheap. It takes a *lot* of time to make a Vette *really* straight. If
you want it more original, *with* the original waves, &amp; there is no
'glasswork needed, I may be able to do it as cheaply as $2800. Still using

BTW; Reminds me of the time I painted the editor of Vette Vues magzine's
car. He ordered one from GM, &amp; when he went to pick it up it was perfect.
He then pointed to another car &amp; bought that one instead! Brought it to us
before he even drove it, &amp; had us paint it removing all the original waves

Yep, need to blame someone for those people being rich, it sure wasn't from
them working to gain any wealth. Some poor do get poorer and some rich get
richer and it always has been that way whether there was a Democrat in

Yeah, about 2,290 and it would be my pick if I were to have one, I've never
been a convertible fan since I sold the '61. From what this deal is working
out to I won't own this one. When I went to pick it up the first words out
of her mouth were Barret/Jackson. As I was getting it ready to load she kept
telling me about the $1,000 each knock off wheels that were with it. She
brought out a spinner hub cap.

Lots more to this story but as far as I'm concerned it's over, just another
job.

You'll have to tell her that Barrett Jackson is full of people with far more
money than brains.  Then they get drunk, and bid.

In the real world, that doesn't happen.  In fact, her car B-J wouldn't even
let in.  It doesn't shine enough.

Tell her it is as likely to get that money out of her car as having Paul
McCartney come to her house to play Happy Birthday for her, or maybe even
Elvis. (Yes, we know those odds.)

B-J tends to attract a lot of people who spend $10,000 the way she probably
spends $1.  Lots of Hollywood types, pro sports types, and new money types
that probably made $100,000 between breakfast and the auction.  To them,
$160,000 for a shiny car isn't a big deal.

You got that, their lighting is a great seller as far as the shine goes.
There is allot good to say about her 64 but not the 40 figure she thinks
it's worth. My 72 looks better in more ways than one, I'm sure the 64 could
be made much more valuable then can the 72.

Did you ever see Proteams 59 Retractable Hardtop?  They were asking $500,000
for it at one time.

"Docs" math isn't very good either as he calculates the 8% commission at
about 15%

"Don't ask me to appraise you car. I underestimated almost all. Note the
sold price includes the 8% auction commission. To find the sellers
payday, divide the sold price by 108, and then multiply by 92. I missed
some of the live action on the Speed channel, but captured some of the
excitement and presentation at BJ. These TV"

Anyway you figure it, it is an awful lot of money to pay for a clone.

Just think, you can't even sell it as an original 300 hp anymore because
that engine is now gone.

Only in the ads.

D&amp;A Corvettes in Gillespie, IL used to have a '58 that was redesigned as a
mini '58 Impala convertible with a continental kit.  I used to have
pictures.  If I can find them, I'll scan and post here, if no one screams
too much about a picture on a binary group.

Dad, i also work on cars for a living, and one thing that i have found
out is that an auction is a wonderful place to get an education, i
have seen folks lose enough money to put a kid in collage, buying cars
that were junk,. there used to be a very large auction house for autos
just down the road from my shop, they sold to the public on friday
nights, you would see 5-10 every saturday mouning parked on the side
of the interstate with in a few mile of the place. Greg
