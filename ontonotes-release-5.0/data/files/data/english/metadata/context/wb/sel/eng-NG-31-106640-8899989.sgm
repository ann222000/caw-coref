Hi Patti and Everyone else who chooses to read this,

Where do I start? First of all I am keeping you in my prayers and I know  you
will prevail.

Okay so I was sitting here tearing up when I read this because I so wanted
to post my experience this past Monday but I wasn't sure I could, being a
newbie  and all I am still learning the ropes.

My Mom's Mom and her sister {who is only 4 years older them me} both had
breast cancer and mastectomy's. I have been so faithful in my mammo's since I
had to have a {benign} tumor removed when I was 13, yes I said 13.  Anyway, in
2005  I had finally found a dr I really really liked and  the day I seen her
and had all my labs, mammo etc scheduled my husband came home  with insurance
paperwork saying we HAD to change dr's. I immediately called his  office to see
if my new found dr was on the list, NOPE. So I knew I had to get  the mammo
and kept putting it off and here a year later I said oh I better get  that done.
Did it a couple of weeks ago {I even posted about it}, went this past  Monday
to my new dr {that I don't really care for of course!} and she had my
results for the mammo, oh and I had received a call from the imaging center  that
did the mammo that they needed my last mammo to compare, so I did that way
before this appointment on Monday.....So I'm sitting there in the office and the
dr tells me as she is patting my leg, &quot; that something came up in my mammo on
my  right breast, she isn't sure what it is, but we will deal with it as it
comes.&quot;  Well I have to wait for a referral and I call her office this morning
and talk  to the nurse wanting to know where my referral is??? I mean to me
things like  this CAN NOT WAIT! She said it was just submitted yesterday, so they
will call  me when they get it....That didn't sit well with me so I called my
insurance  group and lo and behold they have it approved already, they fax it
to me and I  ask for a copy of the report. I want to see for myself what it
says....Well the  report does me no good, it talks mumbo-jumbo that I don't
understand! So I will  throw it out there and maybe some of you know. It says
&quot;Right breast findings:  The breast is heterogeneously dense. This may lower the
sensitivity of the  mammography. There  are several partially obscured
nodules.&quot;

Anyone have a clue??? Thanks so much and again Pati you are in my thoughts
and prayers. And so you know I did walk the Cancer Walk with my daughter, and
it  was such an awesome feeling to take part in something where you were among
all  these survivors!

Hugs to you!

Hi Dawn,
As women age, the breast tissue naturally thins and get less dense (thus
breasts begin to sag), and in your case, it hasn't thinned enough that all
areas of the breast tissue can be easily seen. It's nothing to be concerned
about, but you will probably have them look at it with particular scrutiny
every time you have a mammogram. I have this same thing happen to me.
Usually mammograms are a matter of course for women after the age of 30, and
the reason they use this age as a standard is because of the breast tissue
thinning at about that age, but not everybody's does. Sometimes I have had
to go back for the sonogram just to check certain areas that they weren't
able to see easily on the film, and sometimes they have to retake certain
shots of the mammo.
I understand the panicky feeling...when I first had this happen, I had just
been diagnosed with Graves disease, had been told I was going to have to
have a hysterectomy, and then they call to tell me I need to come back
because of my mammogram! When I asked why, the girl at my dr's office kept
being so mysterious, saying she couldn't talk to me about it &quot;over the
phone&quot;. ??????? I still don't know why she couldn't have just told me she
didn't understand the results, or have the dr talk to me about it, or
SOMETHING to keep me from going through pure hell for the next week until I
got to the dr's office. I just knew they were going to tell me I had CA,
after all the other bad news I had received in the month prior.
Hope this helps.
Pati, I'm new around here, but just wanted you to know that I'm praying for
you and sending healing thoughts your way. Wishing you the very best.

**** reply
This often happens in people that are young.. not unusual.. that is why  they
ask for your last mamo. That way they can compare them, see if anything has
changed.
You might inquire as to any dif kind of mamo you may be able to take, since
you have a direct history of cancer in the family.

Basically what they are saying.. is they can't see anything.. its  dense.
lowers the sensitivity.. means.. could be there .. but, they can't  tell.
IF you are concerned then talk to the dr.. and see what they say.. ? If you
not satisfied, there is a reason.
Gut feeling, and ya know what they always say about gut feelings.. go with
them!

Lots of luck.
