White lines on JVC 32&quot; AV-32f702

I have a 32&quot; JVC tv model # AV-32f702...I have a few thin white lines
at the very top of my set and a series of dashes below it. I have been
scouring the net for help on this and read here where someone had a
27&quot; jvc not the same model as mine not even the same size but that he
replaced the c424 capacitor and it fixed his problem which was
identical to mine. I purchased the cap tried to find it on my
board...not there, it would stand to reason that my tv is different
than that guys and thus the boards are different. It seems that my
problem is an easy fix if I just knew which cap to change. I have the
parts list and all necessary tools, I just need to know which cap to
buy. I would be forever grateful for your assistance, I really dont
want to blow over a 1000 yet on a plasma or LCD...I'd like to get
another year out of my set, I really like it, but the lines at the top
are starting to bother me as I seem to fixate on it, and have made it
my mission to resolve myself.

THANKS in advance!

Check all the electrolytic caps related to the vertical output circuit,
including the power supply. Also may consider replacing the vertical output
device. ESR the caps and you will definately find at least 1 or 2 that will
check out of range.

Maybe you just need to adjust the vertical size (height). The dashes
are the vertical interval signals such as color correction and closed
captions. They are supposed to be there but the screen size is
supposed to be set to &quot;overscan&quot; in the vertical direction by a few
lines.
