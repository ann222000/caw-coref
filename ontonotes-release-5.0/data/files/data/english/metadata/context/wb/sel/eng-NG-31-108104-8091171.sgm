I'm posting a tribute to one of my parakeets, Pandora.

A boy parakeet with a girl's name, but a lovely budgie none the less.

I got him back in 1999 to be a playmate for Patches (RB) another
parakeet.  With the two of them it was like being a mom, because i
would suddenly hear angry chirping and turn around just in time to see
one of them knock the other off the perch.

Patches went to the bridge in 2002, and Pandora did nothing but sulk.
So I then got him Tweety.  Tweety was completely yellow when i got
her, and has since grown green feathers in some places. Pandora, being
a boy parakeet, went 'HUBBAHUBBA!&quot; and for the last five years the two
of them have been quite bonded.

I don't know if you've seen parakeets, but they would preen each
other, Pandora would regurgitate his food and feed Tweety.  He would
dance around the cage, give her a kiss and then sing his happiness.

Meanwhile, I got Imp in 2003, and after an attempt by him to jump up
and see the birdies up close, the bird cage went from sitting on a
bookcase to hanging from the ceiling.

Where Pandora (or should I call him Pan?) and Tweety lived out their
days in harmony, aware that there was a mysterious 'HAND' that would
suddenly appear, refill their food and water, clean their cage, etc.
Also they would love to sing and TAUNT the strange four legged
creatures below.

Mischief would sit on my old desk and just WATCH the birdies for
HOURS.  At times she would do a butt wiggle, but there was no way she
could reach them so she would just whine.

The birdies were kinda afraid of me, no matter what I did, so i just
let them be.  They had each other and were quite bonded.  I'm sure if
they had a bigger cage and nesting material they would have been
trying to make baby parakeets.

I heard the chirping yesterday so to me everything seemed normal.

Then I went to change the food and water, and suddenly i noticed there
was only ONE parakeet.

Oh no......

Pandora was lying dead at the bottom.

Poor guy.........the problem with exotic species, especially birds is
that they hide ANY medical condition really really well.  So for all I
know, he was perfectly fine one day and then suddenly died.  I just
hope he hadn't died a few days ago and I hadn't noticed.  I still feel
guilty......

I had him for almost nine years, and I don't know how old he was when
I got him.  Lifespan for a parakeet is 6-15 years.

He lived a good life.  I buried him in the plant bed outside my
apartment, next to Patches.

*sigh*......

The weird thing is....when Patches died, Pandora sulked for a long
time.  Tweety in this case doesn't seem that affected.  She's chirping
like always and is acting normally.  When I polished the mirror in her
cage, she DID start snuggling up to it however.

Oh and while i was busy burying Pandora and doing other things and
went to work today....

I forgot to re-hang the cage on the ceiling.  I put it on a nearby
table.  ooops....

So imagine my surprise when I came home and found the cage on the
floor, birdseed EVERYWHERE.  Fortunately Tweety was ok.

First thing i said was an obscenity....

Second thing i said was &quot;ALRIGHT, WHO DID IT??&quot;

All three cats suddenly disappeared......

I cleaned up the mess, re-hung the cage and Tweety is singing away.
And the cats seem to be sulking......

Ah well....

So purrs that Pandora made it across the bridge and is in a tree
somewhere, eating all the seeds he wants and singing to his heart's
content.

I'm sorry for your loss, Kristi.  They can be great fun and also a major
PITA when they start squabbling and squawking!

I got my first parakeet in 1966.  I've pretty much had parakeets off and on
(mostly on) ever since.  When my last parakeet, Rachel, died in 2003 I
decided I wouldn't get another one.  But after a few months I realized how
much I was missing the sound of birdie chirps.  This time, however, I did
some research and decided to get a lovebird instead.  Peaches (who isn't a
peach faced lovebird LOL) is the result.  She'll be 4 in November.

Sorry to hear about your loss, Kristi.  It sounds as if Pandora
had a good long life, though, and I'm sure he'll be waiting for
you at the bridge, along with patches.

Purrs for your loss.....

I'm so very sorry to read about Pandora. He must have been a lovely
parakeet, living a good life with you. That brought back memories of
our parakeet. His name was 'Hey Joe'. As Pandora and Tweety, he was
very shy when it came to contact with us, so we let him be. He loved
the cats dearly and could meow and the telephone bell:-)

He was living in a cage which was hanging from the ceiling. His cage
door was open all the time, but he preferred to sit on his cage and
talk to the cats. He died aged 9...

May Pandora have a safe trip to the bridge and may he find peace and
happiness.

Purrs to you from
Inge and the catgang

I so sorry for your loss. I could almost hear Pandora and Tweety
chirping together as I read about them.

I'm glad that Tweety isn't depressed over the loss of her mate.

Purrs of condolence for your loss of Pandora. It isn't the size of the pet
that dictates how much we will miss them, after all, it's the size of their
purrsonality.

&gt; I'm posting a tribute to one of my parakeets, Pandora.

&gt; A boy parakeet with a girl's name, but a lovely budgie none the less.

&gt; I got him back in 1999 to be a playmate for Patches (RB) another
&gt; parakeet.  With the two of them it was like being a mom, because i
&gt; would suddenly hear angry chirping and turn around just in time to see
&gt; one of them knock the other off the perch.

&gt; Patches went to the bridge in 2002, and Pandora did nothing but sulk.
&gt; So I then got him Tweety.  Tweety was completely yellow when i got
&gt; her, and has since grown green feathers in some places. Pandora, being
&gt; a boy parakeet, went 'HUBBAHUBBA!&quot; and for the last five years the two
&gt; of them have been quite bonded.

&gt; I don't know if you've seen parakeets, but they would preen each
&gt; other, Pandora would regurgitate his food and feed Tweety.  He would
&gt; dance around the cage, give her a kiss and then sing his happiness.

I'm so very sorry to hear that.
