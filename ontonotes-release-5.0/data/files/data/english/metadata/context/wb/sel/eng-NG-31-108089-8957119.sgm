(and anyone else wondering about riding with a defibber.)

Drinks on the house.

I just wanted to tell you my defibrillator defibrillated the
other day. It was *not* pleasant. It's a cross between
getting kicked in the chest by a goat, (from the inside),
and stepping on a 50,000 volt wire for a brief moment,
Or I could imagine a gun shot feeling like this. The
first thing I did was look for blood.

Any way, it turns out it was a false alarm. I was helping
the local police apprehend a convicted fugitive child
kidnapper/molester, (not in my normal day's work,
and my adrenaline got my heart beating so fast that
the ICD couldn't decipher what was happening and
decided to zap me just in case. So all's well with me
(and nobody will see Chester for a while.)

I can't say it would have made me lose control if
I'd have been on the bike. I think if all other conditions
were OK, it would have been ok. The initial thought
of &quot;What the fuck was that&quot; was more disorienting than
the shock itself, but now that I know what it feels like,
it shouldn't be as bad.

As it were, I was driving the car, and had no problem
keeping control of it. I didn't notice any physical
effects after the shock itself.

Call me or ping me if you want more details of what
you might expect.

Good to know it's working, eh?  Also good to know that it's not
shocking/disconcerting enough to put you out of control of a bike.

Sucks to be the alpha tester for this, I'm sure, but it's good to have a
real report from one of our own about it rather than just opinions from
folks like me who would just be speculating.

Yo...Shirley, kindly find your finest and I propose a toast to Roach for
helping get the shitwad off the street.  I know it was a &quot;shocking&quot;
experience for him (sorry, couldn't help myself), but whenever someone
helps the police get a child molester off the streets, I have to say
thanks, raise a toast, and a salute.  Well done Roach.

I have only seen one other person have an ICD shock them.  Scared the
hell out of me because I didn't know what happened.  This person had a
serious history of heart disease and was actually unconcious for awhile
after the ICD triggered.  Paramedics were with him at the time.

Thanks for the feedback.

My cardiologist had told me that if my ICD ever went into EMT mode it would
be like getting kicked by a mule.  I developed a problem early in the spring
in which my heart was going into atrial fib *a lot*. Late July they put me
in the ER, turned off the ICD, chemically stopped my heart and then paddled
me. (I was sedated.) Every since this procedure (cardioversion - Google) my
heart has been in sinus rhythm which isn't too bad for a 70 year old or any
one else for that matter.

Ping me at billSPAM27612 at yahoo dot com since I've lost your number.

Also have a look at the tiny url below for our new web site. Keep the guest
book entry clean!

My worry is this episode was not indicative of a typical shock.
Most of the literature says you should feel really bad just before,
and likely would pass out first. Because this was not caused by
any of the normal firing conditions, I only got the shock,
not the peripherals. The doctor told me everyone's mielage would
vary. I would be more bworried about what happens before
and after the shock while riding than the shock itself.

Thanks. ot sure how long he'll be off the streets though. The
guy already did his ten years for kidnapping, but made the
mistake of moving into my neighborhood without registering
his address with the locals. That's all he was wanted for.
His second mistake was paying too much attention to my
daughter even before I knew about his past.

The problem is, our local Megan's Law officer only became
a cop because he couldn't even change a tire right in his
father's auto repair shop. Bunch of useless fucks.

I am finishing up 32 years as a LEO.  My last day will be this coming
Wednesday.  We do not have a specific officer to track down sex
offenders.  The state police track the sex offenders and when one does
not register, arrest warrants are issued.  When the warrants come to us,
then we will try to track him.  Eventually they turn up and are taken
into custody.

This guy doesn't look like he'd have too much trouble. He's a 6'2,
very strong martial artist. A scary guy. Mr. Remington will be
handy until I know the final disposition.

I just found out yesterday that he had been hangin around the
local pharmacy without buying anything, no doubt looking
for another victim amongst the 16 year old girls that work there.

They tried that on our Chief Engineer. Didn't work out well. He started
with CHF a couple years ago and has been sliding downhill ever since. The
pacemaker didn't work, the drugs aren't working and the cardioversion
didn't work. He's now at the top of the transplant list. 1 to 6 month wait
for a match. BTW the guy is 37, never drank, never smoked, never did drugs
just born with a bad ticker. I've been keeping him in my thoughts for a
successful transplant. Unfortunately, somebody else has to die for him to
live.

Been there got that, went to work one Monday two years ago on the

the floor. It knocked the shit out of me, not sure if it was just the

my favorite coffee cup damn it... and my hand when I punched the wall

Ended up in the ER for observation and analyses. Turns out the
drinking binge I was on for the few weeks prior was the probable
cause.

Fast forward 1 week later and back to work the following Monday and
I got hit four more times within an hour. Not near as disconcerting
this time. But I ended up back in the ER and Cath Lab. Which as it

Well Greasy, as a side note this is only the third and fourth time I
received any therapy from the device(I'm on the third one). First time
was the morning after the first install back in '94 doc said it was
because of all the trouble they had getting the settings correct.
Second time was about a year later and I did not know it happened(must
have been asleep) till I had it tested and they told me it had
delivered a therapy. Add to that I'm not the best at maintaining
myself and it was bound to happen. But like you said &quot;it's better than

&gt; This guy doesn't look like he'd have too much trouble. He's a 6'2,
&gt; very strong martial artist. A scary guy. Mr. Remington will be
&gt; handy until I know the final disposition.

&gt; I just found out yesterday that he had been hangin around the
&gt; local pharmacy without buying anything, no doubt looking
&gt; for another victim amongst the 16 year old girls that work there.

these are the scenarios that remind me of why i am glad i didn't ever have
kids.  i am wrapped way too tightly to have to endure stuff like this.  if i
was having to worry about some dude abusing my child i wouldn't have the
reserve to deal with this through the authorities.  my solution would
involve some logging chain and a large body of water or a shotgun and a
backhoe.  good job on the legal collar and if you need to borrow some heavy
equipment in the future i don't ask too many questions.

&gt;&gt;I am finishing up 32 years as a LEO.  My last day will be this coming
&gt;&gt;Wednesday.  We do not have a specific officer to track down sex offenders.
&gt;&gt;The state police track the sex offenders and when one does not register,
&gt;&gt;arrest warrants are issued.  When the warrants come to us, then we will
&gt;&gt;try to track him.  Eventually they turn up and are taken into custody.

Tanks.....
Had a college professor tell me once, &quot;the job of the police departement
is to protect 95% of the population for %5 of the population&quot;.

Yeah....I put up with some real assholes over the years.  Funny thing
was, I caught more trouble on parking violations than felony arrests.  I
have arrested people for shootings, stabbings, rapes, and they would
practically handcuff themselves and write the reports (just kidding on
that last part), but I have been assaulted and had fights over parking
violations....go figger.

The town had a nice retirement luncheon for me today.  Great sendoff.
No regrets on my choice of career.  If I had to do it over again, I
would choose the same line of work.

Just got back into riding last year.  Bought a new 06 Sportster 1200C
and have enjoyed riding it around town and on short trips.  Maybe one
day, a larger bike, but for now the Sporty serves me well.

No one hates a bad cop more than a good cop and I for one have about the
least amount of tolerance for the bad cop as anyone.  There a bad people
in any line of work.

Anyhow, again thanks for hoisting the libations in my direction.
&lt;Clink&gt; to you and the rest of the house and may you ride long and safe.

Damn!  That would have scared the crap out of me.  Glad to hear
you're OK.
