Who is using whom? Who are the victims, who are the perpetrators? In
any case, we've heard it all; most of us have heard it all: teacher-
student relationships that now and again lead to pregnancy and other
scandals. Teachers exchanging or demanding sex for better class grade
and other favors. Teachers selling or exchanging higher score for
other remunerations. Teachers pimping students and or fellow teachers
for financial and non-financial gains. Â Teachers selling handouts and
other documents to supplement their income. The list goes on and on
and on and on. It is a mess, an epidemic. But sadly, these are some of
the realities in our institutions of higher learning.

Beyond these dissolute behaviors are the academic scandals:
plagiarism, examination misconducts and falsification of data by
students and teachers. Cheating, plagiarism and falsification of data
has always been a part of the academia, but in recent years such
infringements have taken a different meaning and dimension. For
instance, there are professional exam takers, professional
interviewees, and the &quot;exchange students.&quot; For a fee, a designate can
write your exam, attend your interviews, and even attend classes for
you. You need not be a real student. There are people ready to do the
work for you if you have the money.

No one I know knows whether there have been studies done on the effect
of these transgressions; or, how these breaches impact the educational
system. Even so, these practices and transgressions cannot be good for
the country's culture and educational landscape. These injuries cannot
be wiped out, but they can be minimized. Fortunately, the
aforementioned contagions are limited to some teachers and
departments. It is here noted that Nigeria has had a glorious history
of academic excellence, and has over the years, been blessed with men
and women of high moral and ethical standard -- men and women whose
mission was to engage in research, contribute to knowledge, educate,
inform and shape young minds. All these they did!

Something else: if you've ever attempted to secure academic
transcripts from any Nigerian university, or from other institutions
of higher learning, you must know how difficult and frustrating it can
be. And in fact, such difficult experiences are not limited to
schools. Procuring medical records or any government manuscript can
also be an uphill task. Although securing documents and transcripts
may be easier if you live in Nigeria; attempting to do so from abroad
can be annoying, traumatic and time consuming. Not a few Nigerians
have commented that it is easier to rob a bank than to secure
transcripts and other documents from Nigeria.

Oversea-Nigerians who have attempted to secure school transcripts --
without an insider to help -- have a tome of woes to tell. A few days
ago, a friend called to inquire if I have friends or relatives in
Ilorin, Kwara State. He wanted to know because he needed help securing
his transcript from the University of Ilorin. This friend of mine who
needed the transcript was beginning to panic as his prospective
employer needed the document -- without which his employment prospect
would come to naught.

Fortunately, this friend of mine was able to have his transcript sent
after his friends and relatives, living in Lagos and elsewhere,
interceded on his behalf. Well, Lagos to Ilorin is not exactly a very
long distance; but considering the state of public transportation,
leaving Lagos for Ilorin for the sole purpose of securing school
documents can be worrisome. There is no guarantee that the transcript
would be secured in the first, second, fifth or sixth attempt. None!

Aside from the official fee to be paid to the school, facilitators
within the school system would also need to be paid or greased.
Moreover, friends and relatives who spent their time going back and
forth must also be compensated. Transcript (and postage) that
ordinarily should cost no more than $35 may end up costing the
supplicant upward of $200. You can't even quantify the cost of time
spent, along with the stress and other incalculable resources. And
indeed, there is no guarantee that the requested documents will
arrive, or arrive in a timely fashion.

For over a year now, a casual female friend living in the Chicago area
has been trying to get hold of her complete transcripts from the
University of Ibadan -- all to no avail. First, the sending officer --
after all the fees and bribe was given -- did not fulfill his part of
the bargain. More money and more time were spent, after which a
partial transcript was sent. Let's just say she is till waiting, and
waiting, and waiting. Greencard in hand, she is unable to attend
graduate school because of the delay in securing her official
transcripts. Such is the frustration of obtaining official documents
from Nigerian institutions of higher learning.

One of the unintended consequences of these difficulties is that some
Nigerians have taken to forging official records. Forging documents is
a crime; but it is even more criminal and malicious when an
institution refuses to, or intentionally delays sending supporting
documents to enable one &quot;go on with ones life.&quot; Procuring official
school documents shouldn't be that difficult. It shouldn't be. If
schools want to increase the fee for such services, well then, they
should go ahead. But for goodness sake, they should fulfill their
obligation to their former students.
