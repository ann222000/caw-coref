Ryan Scott has left a new comment on your post &quot;Where it will take me?&quot;:

You asked what you believe in, but you already really know:&quot;Successful
professional, happily married, emotionally healthy, two beautiful kids,
plenty of money and, strangely, a healthy spiritual outlook and sense
of purpose.&quot;You still have all that, but you've just developed a fear
that you've lost god, and that somehow matters. You need to let go of
god, and realize all those things that you value in life came from your
efforts, from what you put out in the world, from your humanity. You
sound like someone who has his act together except in clinging to this
one last damaging view. Don't try to reconcile the way you see god now
with how you saw him before. The veil has been lifted, and there's no
going back. Concentrate on what you value in the world, the love of
your family, and move forward. Maybe you 'dad' is a bastard, but that
doesn't have to affect your adult life. Let him go and keep being the
smart loving person that you seem to be.

&quot;...Bottom line: I feel like I am in mourning. I feel like I have lost
a wonderful friend. And I realise that I don't even know what that
friend ever looked like. Was he a mental construct? Was he imaginary,
like the friends you make up when you are a child?...&quot;He's the kind of
imaginary friend that seems more real than others because you know you
didn't imagine him yourself. The bible-god was imagined for you by
clever and devious people, and you were led into accepting that ready
made 'answer to all problems'......except thinking people like you
question the answers, knowing it's not really so simple. ;)

What a wonderful post! I mourn with you. It has gotten easier over
time, but there are still days that I feel I can't move forward and I
can't go back. I too, always tap danced on the heart of &quot;god&quot; hoping
he'd find pleasure in my little performance so he'd love me. I tried so
hard, but neither did I find solace in the scriptures or any reassuring
love from &quot;Him&quot;. I was given up for adoption at birth and then rejected
terribly by my adoptive family. My husband abandoned me and our
children and I have had abandonment issues my entire life. I had hoped
that god would love me infinitely more and that beneath his wings, I
would find peace, but none such existed for me, and like you, I always
felt that I was just getting in by the skin of my teeth. Human beings
need to feel validated, not continually reminded of their shortcommings
and failures, but Christianity offers no such validation and instead of
loving affirmation, reminds us sinners daily and on every fucking page
of its &quot;sacred&quot; text that we are nothing but dirt and that our
righteousness is as filty rags - our efforts in vain, our little dance,
a vain attempt for our Father's approval, because our big brother Jesus
is always outshining us, while we stand in the shadows looking on
hoping that one day our Father will look at us with that same gleam in
his eye. WTF! No more!Then we find out it's all a lie, that there is no
blood-thirsty, controlling, hateful, accusing, and demanding, god
requiring anything of us, but instead of us realising our freedom, we
stay shackled to the fear of a place called a 'Hell' and a thing
called 'wrath'. Haven't we suffered from fear and self-loathing enough?
Haven't we punished ourselves enough? What punishment can this &quot;god&quot;
inflict on us that we haven't inflicted on ourselves? I don't know
about you anonymous poster, but I'm sick and tired of being afraid of
the non-existent boogey monster. I'd like to open my closet without
feeling he's going to jump out of it, so that's what I will do every
day. I will get up the nerve to go to the closet until I forget that I
was ever afraid of his loud &quot;BOO!&quot; in the first place. The more I stare
at the Heavens, the more I learn of the Universe and the world around
me, the further away I move from fear and the closer I get to the
divine. Replace your fear of a fictitious god with an insatiable
curiosity and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Make every breath
count for this life may be all we have. Learn all you can while you're
hear, love with all you have, laugh until your gut hurts. All the best
to you and your family

Thank you for sharing your painful story.You said &quot;That God himself is
saying: &quot;I agree with you. They get me so wrong! I am the one you can
depend on. I am everything and so much more.&quot; But that would just be
making God in my own image wouldn't it? And that, I remember, is a big
no-no. God is the same today, yesterday and forever ...&quot;I have
concluded reluctantly that humans HAVE made God in their own image. God
has been born in our imagination and this image has been molded by
ignorance and fear.I look at the many confusing and conflicting &quot;God&quot;
concepts in our world and have finally concluded:If there is a God,
he/she/it is at best a disinterested observer. I have been unable to
find genuine evidence of any involvement in humankind's fate.We can
find people who will readily give you anecdotal evidence of God's
intervention in their or other's lives. But ask for evidence and they
can provide none. These folks will revert to &quot;faith&quot; statements and all
sorts of apologetic machinations to justify their belief and why you
should join them.I am recovering from a lifelong involvement in
Xianity. I now see it as a very sad and erroneous belief system.I'm no
therapist, but I can empathize with your feelings of loss. We have been
used, abused and betrayed because of our &quot;blind&quot; faith in Xianity.I
hope you have better times as you work through your changes.for truth,
Bob G.

Keep writing and you'll figure it out. When you least expect it, you
will reach the point of knowing what to do with your life--or what to
believe.The mistake some of us make is that we feel we must know NOW.
Instead of living, enjoying ourselves, and letting life happen, we want
a Christian-like, black-or-white answer immediately.Learning to live
without answers and enjoying ourselves regardless is the best way to
go. The answers always come to us, eventually.

Please don’t be so hard on yourself as you have LOTS of company,
Brother! All of us who have had a “god” in of lives have made them in
our image, that is, perceived them as having certain attributes such as
loving, kind, forgiving, generous, protective and just. But most, if
not all, of these things were taught to us by someone in authority over
us or by someone we respected. When you got to the point in your life
where you began to question and research Christianity’s Claims and
Dogmas, the religion fell like a house of cards. Be thankful for your
new found understanding and press on with the “blessed” life you seem
to have. I agree with Ryan Scott completely (and others too). The
transition phase that you are going through is kinda like divorce as it
takes time to let the other “person” go, in this case, the “God” of
Christianity. It takes time to allow the healing to begin. BTW, if you
still find it comforting to do “church stuff”, you might want to
continue with it until you become “fed up”. Nobody can tell you when
you should let it all go – only you can be the judge of that. Welcome!
I wish you and your family Wisdom, Success and Peace on your Journey.
Your Brother in Unbelief, John

Hey there, I think most of us here know what you are going through. I,m
like nvrgoinbk, in the way she explained by saying, [paraphrasing],
Sometimes I feel like I can't move forward, and I can't go back. I like
that. I shit you not; when I started seeing the turth I wanted to stop
searching, because I was eating valium like candy, trying to control
the effects of seeing my faith in god starting to vanish, but I had to
know the truth. I have gotten better in these last few months, and
truly I can say that, I don't fear death anymore, just only the way I
might go. Hang in there! Peace, Roger

&quot;I'm an anti-theist. It would be horrible if it were true that we were
designed and then created and then continuously supervised throughout
all our lives waking and sleeping and then continue to be supervised
after our deaths -- if that were true, it would be horrible. I'm very
glad there's absolutely no evidnece for it at all. It would be like
living in a celestial North Korea. You can't defect from North Korea
but at least you can die. With monotheism they won't let you die and
get away from them. It's the wish to be a slave. Who wants that to be
true?&quot;--Christopher HitchensNot my quote, but that pretty much sums up
my own feelings.You'll be okay. As time goes by more of more of what
you're finding scary now will look kind of silly in retrospect. It gets
much, much better.

Great article. Goes to show the depths that religion plays with
people's emotions and perspectives. Amazing that the harshest critics
of Christianity tends to be those who are well-educated within, by and
from Christian organizations/churches.It is painful to grow up all your
life believing something and then one day, realizing that it might not
have been what you thought it was all along.Great story.Also, I don't
want to take away from anyone, but I found this website yesterday by
accident (through Technorati). If I'd known about this website, I
would've responded to my own article, so I apologize.And, by the way,
after some disagreement with my previous blogging site, I've moved on
from them (I'm tired of content editors).Paotie's new address is: here.
Happy readings, and thank you for the kind words and support for the
previous article.:o)Paotie

Personally, when I lost my belief in the Biblical God, I felt such
relief and happiness that I was practically floating on the inside. But
everyone's different, I guess. :)But I can't pretend I don't feel a
little sad now and then. Being a Christian was really fun while it
lasted. But it didn't stay that way, and I have to remind myself that
it is only the good memories that I am missing. The constant fear of
Hell, as well as feeling like God didn't really love me, can go to,
well, Hell.Oh, what freedom!

Hey there allI posted the story above and, as I said in it, it's the

Feels kind of weird seeing your 'stuff' in the public domain and being

Found this statistic recently:Deaths in the Bible. God - 2,270,365 not
including the victims of Noah's flood, Sodom and Gomorrah, or the many
plagues, famines, fiery serpents, etc because no specific numbers were
given. Satan - 10.And Satan is the enemy?!

Congratulations on your successful life. I can only aspire to reach it
through hard work and a dash of luck.I'm sorry about your loss and the
crisis you are in. A simple way to alleviate some of the internal
turmoil you have is to put things in perspective (at least this works
for me). Your size compared to the city you are in, to the Earth, the
Sun... Your problems among the 6 billion other people with their
problems. Your life span compared to the 4.5 billion age of the Earth.
When I do this I feel that all these problems I face are not that
important and so I can focus on the positive. Family, friends and doing
something I like are my personal tiny world where I can be happy.

Anonymous 2 said:'Gotta blame God somehow.'Your comment is paradoxical,
contradictory and non-sensical anonymous 2 (can you not at least 'name'
yourself). One would think that indeed that would be enough. Isn't that
the point? What's self-absorbed about searching for something beyond
the obvious, the material, the corporeal? Isn't that what Xians do? And
what precisely am I blaming God for? Did you even bother to read the
post? Am I blaming God for all those things I have? Blaming him for my
job, my wife, my kids? Shouldn't your post reflect my need to be
thanking him? I'm not blaming God for a damn thing mate. I'd never
dare. By the way,I can't 'sound' like anything via the written word. I
can only 'seem'. Thanks for chiming in with a little bit of bile.
You're probably a Xian tho', so I forgive you. Imagine that.

I relate to your confusion and pain. Just a word of caution, those that
you know that are still christians may not be very tolerant of your
doubts.I'm still a closet atheist except to my spouse.I recently
checked out Dan Barker's book &quot;Losing Faith in Faith&quot;. I definitely
recommend it.You are not alone. There are others out there that have
puzzled over the same questions and complications that you are
currently.Atheists can be caring, compassionate, empathetic, and we
don't have to deal with all the cognitive dissonance of trying to
reconcile a belief system with so many inconsitencies and
contradictions.I post anonymous because I don't want my family to have
to deal with the fallout.
