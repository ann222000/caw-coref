After what seemed like a quiet March here in RMMP, I checked out a few
stats about the group.

It's true, March '07 was the quietest, least active posting month in
almost 10 years.
1,138 postings March '07 compared to 1,102 in August of '97.

The peak in postings seems to have been in July of  2002, with 9,942
posts.

Oddly, the number of drum-related posts between the max and min is
probably still about equal ;-)  There was a lot of crap flying around
here for a while, and a lot of it seems to have gone away.

For those of you who were here then, which extreme do you prefer?
(I've been here since Feb '98 and I sort of prefer the action and
drama that was flowing a few years ago -- there were plenty of drum
topics covered too, just to be clear).

You think some former posters went on to find other forums/groups to
socialize in, or do you think the whole idea of an Internet-based drum
group just got a bit old and unsatisfying?

Anyway, it got me thinking about something...
In my work, we've seen (over a number of years) huge rises in Internet
and media activities that foster interpersonal communication, like IM,
texting, cell phone ownership, blogging, social networking sites like
Facebook/MySpace/etc., online gaming like Xbox Live/WoW.  A huge
majority of people report having 10 or more people they would consider
real "friends" even though they have never met in person.  This was
all very exciting for a while as the buzz around these types of
activities and virtual friendships was growing.  Now very recently,
what we're starting to see is an admission that the online friendships
people have aren't all that fulfilling or satisfying.  There is more
and more of a craving for personal contact.  The Internet, despite its
people connections, is increasingly seen as a cold place.  People are
lonely, depsite going through the motions of maintaining online
friendships.  It's pretty intuitive if you really think it through,
but very interesting to see it happening -- especially after many
"experts" predicted a nearly endless increase in virtual relationships
that had the power to replace direct physical contact.

Guess RMMP may be a leading edge microcosm.

I have been around about 7 or 8 years, and have been posting about 6, I
believe.  I was here in the big posting days you cited, although I am still
a piker to a lot of guys in here.

For me, RMMP is still something I enjoy, but it just  doesn't hold the
importance in my life that it used.  I guess I am really not sure why.
Maybe I have gotten somewhat bored with it, I don't know.

Count me in as one of the guys who likes the drama in here when it is not
taken too far (you know what I am talking about), and especially when I am
not involved in it.  I like the car-crash factor.  I just have to look.

I believe RMMP will ebb and flow, just like everything in life.  A new batch
of rooks will be here any day, asking the same old silly newbie questions
and pleading for us all to just get along.  Enjoy the quiet times.

:-)

Yeah. I know what you mean! At first I was all excited about "virtual
internet sex" and now somehow I have more of a craving for personal
contact! :-)

Well for one thing, Shuch has mellowed. Back then he had obscenities
firing out of his mouth like a machine gun to any unsuspecting
bystander. I don't know that the core of him has changed but most
people do mellow out a bit with age.

I've been in and out of here since around 1997 I think. Of course we
also did the first T-shirts for the group way back when. There are
still some of the old diehards that are here. I think I stay on just
because it's one of the first groups I was involved with and I feel a
bit of a kinship with some of you. Also, for awhile there were quite a
few Nashville guys in here that I knew from living there. And of
course some of you that have moved there since I left (Pat, Mike,
etc.) ...so there's a Nashville tie too.

Concerning the Jerry Springer-like drama:  I don't care for it nor do
I believe it's healthy for society. Many of you would debate this. I
don't have the time.

All in all, I agree that there are numerous options available these
days so obviously many will go away. If no other reason to leave, the
best would be that, the more time you spend in a newsgroup, the less
you're practicing!  LOL

Here's to RMMP!  (raises glass)
