There is a big flap going on regarding Wikipedia because of a false biography that got posted about John Siegenthaler. Kyra Phillips on CNN today hosted a long discussion with him, along with the founder of Wikipedia. As usual when people talk about the web, you'd get the idea that it is the only place in the world you can find false information. The New York Times ? Every word you read there is true, I swear.

But the discussion got funny at the end, when Phillips decided to claim that her own biography on Wikipedia was in error. Here it is, in its entirety : "Kyra Phillips is an anchor for CNN, where she has been reporting since October 1999. She anchors 'Live From...', a live news show that airs weekdays from 1:00-4:00 p.m. EST. [1]

"She has been accused by liberals of showing a right-wing bias. In one instance, Nancy Pelosi accused her of asserting the position of the Bush White House during an interview with Pelosi following Hurricane Katrina." It was, of course, the second paragraph which Phillips took exception to, despite the fact that every word of it is true. It doesn't say she has a right-wing bias (although I, for one, would claim she does), only that she has been accused of that, and that is simply undeniable. Of course that didn't prevent Phillips from denying it. "Why," she sputtered, "the entry makes me look like some kind of right-wing Commie." Yeah, Kyra, just like that. At least it doesn't make you look like a complete idiot. You do that yourself.

Nailed her. CNN from one to four is unwatchable.

I've been seeing hints of this discussion all over my regular haunts on the net. I read that Wikipedia is now requiring registrations. I'm not sure how that will help unless they have somebody banning those who lie deliberately.

Your comment about the New York Times reminds me of my reading of the paper in the mid 1980s. That's when Stephen Bonner (sp) was reporting from El Salvador. As an activist, I could point out lie after lie in his reporting. I could see where he slanted the news and where he left out important facts to push a point of view. I was proud of my great media analysis.

Then I would turn the page and read something about a place I knew nothing about and think to myself "Wow, what a shame things are like that there." I'd have to slap myself in the forehead to remind myself that, since the facts on El Salvador were obviously wrong, I couldn't trust anything I read in the paper. Too many years of media saturation had given me a kneejerk ability to believe something just because it was in print!

Argh! I blame the late hour and the wine.

I meant Steven Kinzer. Ray Bonner, actually ended up quitting the Times because of their refusal to report on El Mazote.

Sorry about that!

Is Bonner the one who broke the El Mazote story for the New Yorker? (Well, broke it for the U.S.; presumably the people in El Salvador had heard about it, those who survived it.)

Paul, thanks for the tip. I'm 3/4 of the way through Danner's article for the New Yorker (available on line). An excellent piece of journalism.

Catherine, Bonner was the first U.S. journalist to report on the massacre, but he was reporting for the New York Times. He received permission and protection from the F.M.L.N. to visit the sites. Read the Danner article to learn all about it.

We have a similar situation in the UK - I stopped subscribing to the The Times after Murdoch got his hands on the paper and started controlling the content.

Like some readers I noticed that the notices correcting errors in front page stories would be buried in small print near the back of the journal a few weeks later.
