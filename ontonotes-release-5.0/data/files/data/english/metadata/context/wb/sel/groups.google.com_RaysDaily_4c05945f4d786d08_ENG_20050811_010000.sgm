Hard work spotlights the character of people:

Some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don't turn up
at all.

As some of you know I usually write our daily the day before and then delay
its transmission until after midnight. It is now four in the afternoon and
my body is weary, my eyes are closing, and I am just plain worn out. The
reason I am telling you this is to let you know that I have been getting up
awfully early this week in order to cook breakfast for horse riders, owners,
stable boys and others who are attending a big national horse show. I have
done two days and have two more to go. I don’t know if anyone else thinks it
is hard work, but I think it is, so I hope I qualify as one of the people
that turn up their sleeves.

Each year my Kiwanis club mans a food tent at the Traders Point Horse show
in Zionsville, Indiana. You might have seen some of the events on ESPN over
the years. All the profits from the show go to charity, which is really
unusual in this day and age. Our food operation provides us thousands of
dollars that we use to buy clothes for needy children every Christmas. So
even though my back hurts, my legs hurt, and even my hair hurts it is for a
worthwhile cause. I suppose my exercise program should entail more than just
a few mornings each August, however I must be careful since I have lost
fifteen pounds in the last month and a half. If I exercise too much while I
am dieting I may waste away to nothing. Fortunately I have stored up enough
fat that I should be OK for another year or two.

Cheer Up...

The parachute company says you'll get a full refund.

They say the house didn't float very far at all.

We're all amazed that you go on living each day.

Well, at least the operation was a partial success.

The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; just loved those nude shots of you.

The insects hardly touched your other eyebrow.

With the lights dimmed, it looks almost normal.

The District Attorney says he only has a few more questions.

At least the passenger side air bag inflated.

Jenny Jones wants you for this &quot;secret admirer show.&quot;

The reward for your capture has reached fifty thousand dollars.

At least we never thought you were guilty like that Jury did.

The insurance pays the full book value ($312) for your 1956 T Bird.

The thieves left the push lawn mower and hedge trimmers.

Those Grand Juries always over-react. Don't worry about it.

Lots of guys face multiple paternity suits.

The boss said while you're sick, he'd do all your work personally.

Mrs Gumbo was backing out of her driveway when she heard a sickening
'thump'. She stopped the car in a panic and rushed out to see what had
happened. There, at the end of the driveway, was a small dog lying on its
side. It was dead. (okay, everybody....'Awwwwwww!)

Mrs Gumbo felt just awful. She knew it was her neighbor's dog. Looking very
worried, she climbed the front stairs of her neighbor's house and knocked on
the door. She waited for a couple of minutes. Finally, a man answered.

&quot;I'm soooo sorry,&quot; Mrs Gumbo said &quot;I was backing out of my driveway just a
few minutes ago when I heard a 'thump'. I got out of my car to see what had
happened. Your dog was lying dead at the end of the driveway. I'm afraid
that I ran over her and I feel just terrible about it. I *insist* on
replacing her!&quot;

The man paused and then said. . . &quot;Okay, well, I guess *you* can bring
me my slippers and newspaper tomorrow morning then.&quot;

~~~

I have noticed that the people who are late are often so much jollier than
the people who have to wait for them.

Mr. Jones patted his daughter's hand fondly, and told her, &quot;Your young man
told me today he wanted you as a bride, and I gave my consent.&quot;

Oh, Papa,&quot; gushed the daughter, &quot;it's going to be so hard leaving mother.&quot;

&quot;I understand perfectly, my dear,&quot; beamed Mr. Jones. &quot;You just take her with
you.&quot;

&quot;Being told something for your own good seldom does you any.&quot;

A local pastor joined a community service club, and the members thought they
would have some fun with him.

Under his name badge they printed, &quot;Hog Caller&quot; as his occupation.

Everyone made a big fanfare as the badge was presented.

The pastor, looking at the wording on the badge &amp; then up at the members,
responded by saying &quot;I usually am called the 'shepherd of the sheep'...
but.... I guess you members know your people better than I do.&quot;

Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, and today is a gift. That's why
it is called the present.

Children's Definition of Marriage

&quot;Marriage is when you get to keep your girl and don't have to give her back
to her parents.&quot;

-Eric, AGE 6

&quot;When somebody's been dating for a while, the boy might propose to the girl.
He says to her, 'I'll take you for a whole life, or at least until we have
kids and get divorced, but you got to do one particular thing for me.' Then
she says yes, but she's wondering what the thing is and whether it's naughty
or not. She can't wait to find out.&quot;

-Anita, AGE 9

&quot;You flip a nickel, and heads means you stay with him and tails means you
try the next one.&quot;

-Kelly, AGE 9

&quot;My mother says to look for a man who is kind. So that's what I'll do. I'll
find somebody who's kinda tall and kinda handsome.&quot;

-Carolyn, AGE 8

&quot;Eighty-four. Because at that age, you don't have to work anymore and you
can spend all your time loving each other in your bedroom.&quot;

-Carolyn, AGE 8

&quot;Once I'm done with kindergarten, I'm going to find me a wife.&quot;

-Bert, AGE 5

&quot;You should ask the people who read Cosmopolitan.&quot;

-Kirsten, AGE 10

&quot;It's better for girls to be single but not for boys. Boys need somebody to
clean up after them.&quot;

-Anita, AGE 9

&quot;It gives me a headache to think about that stuff. I'm just a kid. I don't
need that kind of trouble.&quot;

-Will, AGE 7

~~~

I'd rather regret the things I have done than the things that I haven't.

Lucille Ball

&quot;Darling, I would like to ask you a question,&quot; said the wife.

&quot;Go ahead... I will answer as honestly as I can,&quot; replied her husband of
fifteen years.

&quot;How would you describe,&quot; she replied, &quot;The last fifteen years of our life?&quot;

&quot;I would say that we have a strange and wonderful relationship,&quot; replied her
husband.

&quot;Oh, darling,&quot; she commented,&quot; such a beautiful thing to say! But why do
you call it 'strange and wonderful,' I wonder?&quot;

&quot;Because you're strange,&quot; remarked the husband, &quot;and I am wonderful!&quot;

He is expected out of the hospital next week. Pity she broke the rolling
pin....

Character is what emerges from all the little things you were too busy to do
yesterday, but did anyway.
