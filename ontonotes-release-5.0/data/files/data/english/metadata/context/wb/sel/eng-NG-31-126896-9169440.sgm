*August 26, 2007, Sunday*

**

*Praise The Lord!!**

**

Start with four steps*

1. Come as you are right now to the Lord.  Tell him all your feelings,( be
it joy, anger, hate, jealousy, feelings of insecurity,ego, etc ) -
everything -    from the core of your heart.
2. Hand over to the  Lord  the blockages that hinder your path to his Holy
anointing - things you want to change but have no power to change.
3. Surrender your life to the Lord - not by mere words, but from the depths
of your soul - give Him the complete control of your life.
4.  Wait in  silent communion with the Lord in that state of surrender and
the Lord will speak to you and  you will be filled with the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;
*John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he {God} is faithful and just to forgive
us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness*

*Reading 1*
*Isaiah 66:18-21* &lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/isaiah/isaiah66.htm#v18 &gt;

Thus says the LORD:
I know their works and their thoughts,
and I come to gather nations of every language;
they shall come and see my glory.
I will set a sign among them;
from them I will send fugitives to the nations:
to Tarshish, Put and Lud, Mosoch, Tubal and Javan,
to the distant coastlands
that have never heard of my fame, or seen my glory;
and they shall proclaim my glory among the nations.
They shall bring all your brothers and sisters from all the nations
as an offering to the LORD,
on horses and in chariots, in carts, upon mules and dromedaries,
to Jerusalem, my holy mountain, says the LORD,
just as the Israelites bring their offering
to the house of the LORD in clean vessels.
Some of these I will take as priests and Levites, says the LORD.

Responsorial Psalm
Ps 117:1, 2 &lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/psalms/psalm117.htm#v1 &gt;

*R. (Mk 16:15) Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
*or:
*R. Alleluia.
*Praise the LORD all you nations;
glorify him, all you peoples!
*R. Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
*or:
*R. Alleluia.
*For steadfast is his kindness toward us,
and the fidelity of the LORD endures forever.
*R. Go out to all the world and tell the Good News.
*or:
*R. Alleluia.*

*Reading II*
*Hebrews 12:5-7, 11-13*&lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/hebrews/hebrews12.htm#v5 &gt;

Brothers and sisters,
You have forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as children:
&quot;My son, do not disdain the discipline of the Lord
or lose heart when reproved by him;
for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines;
he scourges every son he acknowledges.&quot;
Endure your trials as &quot;discipline&quot;;
God treats you as sons.
For what &quot;son&quot; is there whom his father does not discipline?
At the time,
all discipline seems a cause not for joy but for pain,
yet later it brings the peaceful fruit of righteousness
to those who are trained by it.

So strengthen your drooping hands and your weak knees.
Make straight paths for your feet,
that what is lame may not be disjointed but healed.

*Gospel*
*Luke 13:22-30* &lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/luke/luke13.htm#v22 &gt;

Jesus passed through towns and villages,
teaching as he went and making his way to Jerusalem.
Someone asked him,
&quot;Lord, will only a few people be saved?&quot;
He answered them,
&quot;Strive to enter through the narrow gate,
for many, I tell you, will attempt to enter
but will not be strong enough.
After the master of the house has arisen and locked the door,
then will you stand outside knocking and saying,
'Lord, open the door for us.'
He will say to you in reply,
'I do not know where you are from.
And you will say,
'We ate and drank in your company and you taught in our streets.'
Then he will say to you,
'I do not know where you are from.
Depart from me, all you evildoers!'
And there will be wailing and grinding of teeth
when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
and all the prophets in the kingdom of God
and you yourselves cast out.
And people will come from the east and the west
and from the north and the south
and will recline at table in the kingdom of God.
For behold, some are last who will be first,
and some are first who will be last.&quot;
**
*Psalm 69:5-6*
You know my folly, O God; my guilt is not hidden from you.  May those who
hope in you not be disgraced because of me, O Lord, the Lord Almighty; may
those who seek you not be put to shame because of me, O God of Israel.

*Happy Birthday &amp; Happy Anniversery for those who are celebrating.*
**
*Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord be
with You*
