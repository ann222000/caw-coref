Back during the summer, BellSouth offered me a deal consisting of unlimited
local and long distance service, coupled with call waiting and caller ID, for
$39.95 a month. I had been a BellSouth customer for over 30 years, but about
two years ago I had switched to using OneSuite for long distance calls.
OneSuite had the advantage of being dirt cheap, but the convenience of not
having to use an access number appealed to me. I signed up.

What a nightmare it's turned out to be. Every month since, I've had to call up
to inquire why my bill was $60-70 instead of the promised $39.95. We go round
and round. Every month they remove the extra charges and unsubscribe me from
their international plan, which I never asked for to begin with. Every month
there are pending credits. Last month they told me not to be upset with the
bill; that there was actually a credit applied and that I didn't owe them
anything. &quot;At last!&quot;

Yesterday I open the bill (having cancelled the ebill service when it became
apparent that I was going to have to closely examine their charges *every*
month) and find out that I'm past due and owe them $132. Of course, by the time
I open the bill, the business office is closed. I had all night to think (stew)
about it.

I called this morning. The person on the other end had no knowledge of the
$39.95 deal. We went round and round. I got the international plan cancelled
yet again. By the time we were through, I got the bill down to $102, which I
said I would pay. All the extra money it seems goes to &quot;access charges&quot; and
&quot;taxes&quot;. Well, whatever. She told me she could tell me what taxes I already
paid but wasn't allowed to tell me what I'd have to pay next month.

So as I'm getting ready to conclude the call, the woman asks me if I'd be
interested in their DSL service. &quot;Lady&quot;, I said, &quot;there's no way in hell I'd
let you people touch my internet service&quot;. She objected strongly to my use of
&quot;profanity&quot; and started to berate me for using it. That was the first strong
word I'd used in the conversation. I'm sure I wasn't pleasant, but I wasn't
abusive either.

I hung up on her in mid sentence.

I then called Time Warner and signed up for digital phone service: unlimited
local and long distance, plus caller ID, call waiting and call forwarding.
Since I already had cable TV service and Road Runner service, my new monthly
charge will be $101.91... all charges and taxes included, and of course Road
Runner and TV. Everything. In other words, for another $41.57 a month. And
the bill will always be $101.91. We'll see. I hope they're as good as their
word. I do know they don't screw up my internet or TV bills.

Also, with the new telephone number portability law, I don't have to give up my
phone number, which has been the same for almost 20 years.

Tonight I got an automated call asking me to complete a survey with BellSouth
rating my customer support experience today. I didn't bother to call it. I
figure my cancellation should explain my experience with BellSouth more
eloquently than I can... and they won't know about that until the day the Time
Warner guy comes out to the house to install the service for me. Not a word to
BellSouth in the meantime; I can't trust them not to cancel me early or sign me
up for another plan with a 2 year penalty clause for early cancellation.

So sad, too bad. I'm not sorry to see them go.

"/> Our local Time Warner (Bright House) service has been pretty bad the
past couple of days. We're in Central Florida. There was one period
yesterday when the internet broadband service they provide us was down
for 5 straight hours. And it keeps going down frequently for a minute
or two at a time, usually, and sometimes just a few seconds. This is
all just in the past couple of days. For some time before that, maybe
a couple of months, it was fine. But it had similar problems a few
months ago.

We're looking to switch to BellSouth DSL. But maybe not, after
reading what you wrote about them.

During the time when the internet service was down 5 straight hours
yesterday, the Bright House cable &quot;zip 2 it&quot; channel, 49, didn't show
the schedule. Maybe they rely on their own internet service to show
it. But when it goes down for a minute or a few seconds, the schedule
keeps scrolling steadily, so maybe not.

"/> I was a beta tester for Road Runner back when they first came to Charlotte and
have been with them ever since. Every now and then there's a problem; most
commonly with newsgroups. I went for almost two days without newsgroups about a
month ago, but that's the first time I can remember it ever being that bad since
I started with them. I've never had more than very rare outages with
connectivity.

Every time I visit my father down at the coast I thank God I'm with RR. If you
want to compare crappy internet service, check out Charter. My dad regularly
puts up with total outages.

from the horrors of BellSouth, I'll probably be guaranteed a place in Heaven.

Not to defend bell south.

Didn't bell south merge with sbc (Now at&amp;t)?

You do need to read those bills. They are always ending their plans
not just bell south that any companies plan.

There will be notice on the bill. Sometime it is on the back.

It Says this plan will be ending and you will be charged such &amp; such.

I don't work for a phone company.

Here was the deal I had with SBC
I asked them specifically if they were going to change or end the
plan. They said they would always have that plan.

The plan was no monthly service charge at rates were 5 cents anywhere
in the U.S. Then after a year it would go up to 7 cents. Which it
did.

Guess what happen the program changed
after two years It went up to 10 cents a minute with a $2.00 monthly
fee.

So, I dropped them and told I don't want any local or long distance
except for 1010 numbers. They asked me why. I told them that I was
told you would never have a monthly fee. he/she said the
representative should of not told you that are plans change a lot.

Thanks to Michael Powell and the republican era FCC, the
telcos can pretty much do what they want.

* Tariffed charges override any contract you have signed.
There's lots of court precedent for this. It's not in
dispute in any state.

* The telcos can file new tariffs with no prior notification
other than posting it on a web page.

* The telcos are allowed to recover any fees THEY pay from the
consumer on top of the price of your contracted phone service.

Unfortunately, at least around here, the cable company (yep,
just one) isn't very good either.

Most small businesses probably pay hundreds of dollars extra
every year in bogus charges. We audit our bills frequently
and it's unusual not to find a problem every month (we're an
ISP and get lots of telco bills). We rarely get the same
answer from two different business office reps, and it takes
forever to get credit on overcharges, but they sure threaten
to cut the lines off fast if you don't pay up.

"/> Well, they *never* delivered on the plan that I could see... at least until I
bitched. Seems a little odd that the plan would end a week after it started, if
that was what was going on. However, it wasn't... it was incompetence on their
part. Why else was I still in their international plan after five months after
complaining monthly five times that I never signed up for it. Each rep claimed
that they had fixed it for me. None of them had. And they want me to give them
more business? BWAHAHAHA!!!!

Mortimer, at first I thought you were talking about OneSuite? I have
used OneSuite for years and I have never had any problems with them and
know that OneSuite doesn't give bills, so I was confused. This is an
example that one needs to read the entire message to understand. I
switched to OneSuite for the same reason. My long-distance &quot;plan&quot;
every month turned out to be more expensive than promised each month. I
have not been once disappointed with OneSuite, and I no longer have to
call to yell at phone reps about my bills. Sorry about your experience.
Maria
