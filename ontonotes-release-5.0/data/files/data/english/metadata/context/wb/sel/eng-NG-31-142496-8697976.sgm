[T-6.I.11.]
1139. My brothers and yours are constantly engaged in justifying
the unjustifiable. My *one lesson*, which I must teach as I learned,
is that no perception which is out of accord with the judgment of
the Holy Spirit CAN be justified. I undertook to show this was
true in a very extreme case, merely because this would serve as a
good teaching aid to those whose temptations to give in to anger
and assault would NOT be as extreme.

----------
[T-12.I.3.]
1701. ... Every loving thought is true. EVERYTHING ELSE is an
appeal for healing and help. *That is what it IS*, regardless of the
form it takes. Can anyone be justified in responding with anger to
a plea for help? No response can BE appropriate EXCEPT the
willingness to give it TO him, for this and ONLY this is what he
is ASKING for. Offer him anything ELSE, and YOU are assuming
the right to attack his reality, by interpreting it AS YOU SEE FIT.

1702. .... If you maintain that an appeal for help is something
ELSE, you will REACT to something else, and your response will
be *inappropriate to reality* as IT is, but NOT to your perception
OF it. This is poor reality testing by definition. There is nothing
to prevent you from recognizing ALL calls for help as exactly what
they are, EXCEPT YOUR OWN PERCEIVED NEED TO ATTACK.

It is only THIS that makes you willing to engage in endless
&quot;battles&quot; with reality, in which you DENY the reality of the need
for healing by making IT unreal.

1703. You would not do this except for your UNWILLINGNESS to
perceive reality, WHICH YOU WITHHOLD FROM YOURSELF.
It is surely good advice to tell you not to judge what you do not
understand. No-one with a personal investment is a reliable
witness, for truth to him has become what he WANTS it to be. If
you are unwilling to perceive an appeal for help AS WHAT IT IS,
it is because YOU are unwilling to give help, AND TO RECEIVE IT.

---------

1711. If you would look upon *Love, which IS the world's reality*,
how could you do better than to recognize, in every defense
AGAINST it, the underlying appeal FOR it? And how could you
better learn of its reality, than by answering the appeal for it
by GIVING it?

1721. We are therefore embarking on an organized, well-
structured, and carefully planned program, aimed at learning how
to *offer to the Holy Spirit everything you do NOT want*. HE knows
what to DO with it. You do NOT know how to use what He knows.
Whatever is revealed to Him that is not of God, is gone. But you
must *reveal it to YOURSELF in perfect willingness*, for otherwise
His knowledge remains useless TO you. Surely He will not fail to
help you, since help is His ONLY purpose. Do you not have
greater reason for fearing the world, as you perceive it, than
for looking at the cause of fear, and letting it go forever?

Jesus, thank you forever. I am willing to practise
further, and I know my brothers and sisters are
as well. Thank you for the light of reason and of
love, of wisdom and of experience. May the joy
of remembrance hurl us straight into God's
world, which is seen as Love, not hatem, by all. This day
we're coming home, and return for a while only
to come home again; each time with treasures
gathered and refined, so they will stand the test
of time, and of timelessness as well. Glory to you.

1)      From these passages we can deduce some conclusions about TRCM and
its posting.

a.      For the large part, Course discussion on TRCM has been an exercise
in justifying the unjustifiable.

b.      Course discussion to be In accord with Course Teachings should be
conducted without anger and assault

c.      Course discussion on an unmoderated newsnet format tempt posters to
give into anger and assault, and as such is either teaching lessons
contrary to course teaching, or at best obscuring and confusing course
teachings.

d.       Anger and assault are discernible, that is anger and assault can
be perceived and meaningful discussed and meaningfully addressed in
the context of course teachings.  Moreover it's clearly a mistake to
attempt to re-interpret anger and assault as NOT anger and assault, so
that these conditions are not properly addressed.  IE, one cannot
argue that anger and assault can be seen as &quot;love,&quot; if one &quot;changes
his perception.

e.      The message and context of trolling is clearly anger and assault
against other posters, and thus represent an appeal for help and
healing.

f.      The proper response to the anger and assault is the willingness to
help.  That doesn't mean help is or has to be accepted; nor does it
mean one should force help on someone unwilling to accept help.

g.       &quot;Don't feed the trolls,&quot; could be amended to &quot;Don't feed anger and
assault,&quot; or don't respond to anger and assault with any response but
a willingness to help.  Hence, a possible response to any display of
anger and assault would be a simple reply offering help.  Certainly to
be an authentic offer of help, such help if requested, should not be
wrapped in its own anger and assault.

h.      A course student is under no obligation to engage trolls except
under the condition of willingness to give and receive help.  Hence
the plea and argument that a refusal to engage trolls in other manners
is an indication of separation or indication of not seeing Christ or
The Son of God in one's brother is suspect.

i.      Anger and assault should NOT be justified under the dubious
argument that anger and assault bring up issues in others, so those
&quot;issues,&quot; can be addressed.  As such encounter methodology where group
anger and assault is encouraged and justified is counter to course
teachings.

j.       &quot;Spiritual Discourse,&quot; where it accepted to comment on the
spiritual condition of one's brothers, or living values, or having
consistent values  is suspect, because such comments are often
motivated and perceived as anger and assault

k.      The argument that this newsgroup teaches course principles by
tempting students to engage in anger and assault is highly suspect.
Moreover and clearly re-interpreting course teachings to tolerate and
accommodate anger and assault as a integral, somehow necessary and
normal  condition of  course teaching is wrong.  As such there is no
course based reason to tout this newsgroup as a school for course
values, or as an learning environment for advanced course students
learning advanced course lessons

This still involves seeing &quot;anger and attack&quot; (tormenting, abuse,
trolls, etc) in someone else &quot;out there&quot;.   First making it real (out
there, in someone else) in order to then deal with it (course beliefs
or not)

How does this fit with the idea of projection?  Seeing something
out there (in a brother) a person doesn't want to see, face, deal
with, where it really is, inside themself?

Or, does the course mean something else when it speaks of this and
project and says it's never anything &quot;out there&quot; in any one else. Only
the mind of the one seeing it (making it real) &quot;out there&quot; that needs
to realize where it reallly is, and where any solutions to seeing it
differently are.

Tho, the way you discribe it is the way Raj does, too. There
reallly are mean, evil people who can and do attack  (out there) (even
if in one case, Raj was  basically the only one seeing it that way)
that do need defense and maybe even counter attack to keep one safe
from.

There's all that in the course about defensless being our only
safety and the need FOR defense being the only thing that makes
&quot;attack&quot; attack.

If your way of seeing ACIM is realy the true way, seeing mean,
evil people  (and problems with them that need to be fixed) &quot;out
there&quot; is correct and it's not the mind that is seeing it this way-
projecting it and creating it as real in that way, this basically
makes what the course says meaningless.

or, once again proves the idea everyone has their own version of
truth, reality (and A Course in Miracles)

Whatever feels good and right to you.

~Is this how you think, Carrie? Start somewhere in the middle and then
supply your own beginning and end? If the idea of projection has you
confused why not start at the beginning and a step at a time construct
an accurate model of what the author is saying. That takes work.  Much
more work than partial understanding.

On the other hand, you won't sound like someone trying to explain how

Oh, gee. The same response most of us have to your skewed ideas about

At any rate, Carrie you be a lot more convening if you weren't

Take a deep breath, compose yourself and think about it.

People here respond like their mind is a fork twirling spaghetti?

And it's my fault people can't understand what I'm saying?

Having an actual conversation/discussion with you, sticking to
course concepts and interpretations, when you are continually turning
it around so it's something about ME is like doing a puzzle.

A challenge.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   is that no perception which is out of accord with the judgment of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   the Holy Spirit CAN be justified. I undertook to show this was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   true in a very extreme case, merely because this would serve as a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   good teaching aid to those whose temptations to give in to anger
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;   and assault would NOT be as extreme.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Tera Free comments:

&gt; &gt;&gt; 1)      From these passages we can deduce some conclusions about TRCM and
&gt; &gt;&gt; its posting.

&gt; &gt;&gt; a.      For the large part, Course discussion on TRCM has been an
&gt; &gt;&gt; exercise
&gt; &gt;&gt; in justifying the unjustifiable.

&gt; &gt;&gt; b.      Course discussion to be In accord with Course Teachings should be
&gt; &gt;&gt; conducted without anger and assault

&gt; &gt;&gt; c.      Course discussion on an unmoderated newsnet format tempt posters
&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; give into anger and assault, and as such is either teaching lessons
&gt; &gt;&gt; contrary to course teaching, or at best obscuring and confusing course
&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings.

&gt; &gt;&gt; d.       Anger and assault are discernible, that is anger and assault can
&gt; &gt;&gt; be perceived and meaningful discussed and meaningfully addressed in
&gt; &gt;&gt; the context of course teachings.  Moreover it's clearly a mistake to
&gt; &gt;&gt; attempt to re-interpret anger and assault as NOT anger and assault, so
&gt; &gt;&gt; that these conditions are not properly addressed.  IE, one cannot
&gt; &gt;&gt; argue that anger and assault can be seen as &quot;love,&quot; if one &quot;changes
&gt; &gt;&gt; his perception.

&gt; &gt;&gt; e.      The message and context of trolling is clearly anger and assault
&gt; &gt;&gt; against other posters, and thus represent an appeal for help and
&gt; &gt;&gt; healing.

&gt; &gt;&gt; f.      The proper response to the anger and assault is the willingness
&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; help.  That doesn't mean help is or has to be accepted; nor does it
&gt; &gt;&gt; mean one should force help on someone unwilling to accept help.

&gt; &gt;&gt; g.       &quot;Don't feed the trolls,&quot; could be amended to &quot;Don't feed anger
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; assault,&quot; or don't respond to anger and assault with any response but
&gt; &gt;&gt; a willingness to help.  Hence, a possible response to any display of
&gt; &gt;&gt; anger and assault would be a simple reply offering help.  Certainly to
&gt; &gt;&gt; be an authentic offer of help, such help if requested, should not be
&gt; &gt;&gt; wrapped in its own anger and assault.

&gt; &gt;&gt; h.      A course student is under no obligation to engage trolls except
&gt; &gt;&gt; under the condition of willingness to give and receive help.  Hence
&gt; &gt;&gt; the plea and argument that a refusal to engage trolls in other manners
&gt; &gt;&gt; is an indication of separation or indication of not seeing Christ or
&gt; &gt;&gt; The Son of God in one's brother is suspect.

&gt; &gt;&gt; i.      Anger and assault should NOT be justified under the dubious
&gt; &gt;&gt; argument that anger and assault bring up issues in others, so those
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;issues,&quot; can be addressed.  As such encounter methodology where group
&gt; &gt;&gt; anger and assault is encouraged and justified is counter to course
&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings.

&gt; &gt;&gt; j.       &quot;Spiritual Discourse,&quot; where it accepted to comment on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; spiritual condition of one's brothers, or living values, or having
&gt; &gt;&gt; consistent values  is suspect, because such comments are often
&gt; &gt;&gt; motivated and perceived as anger and assault

&gt; &gt;&gt; k.      The argument that this newsgroup teaches course principles by
&gt; &gt;&gt; tempting students to engage in anger and assault is highly suspect.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Moreover and clearly re-interpreting course teachings to tolerate and
&gt; &gt;&gt; accommodate anger and assault as a integral, somehow necessary and
&gt; &gt;&gt; normal  condition of  course teaching is wrong.  As such there is no
&gt; &gt;&gt; course based reason to tout this newsgroup as a school for course
&gt; &gt;&gt; values, or as an learning environment for advanced course students
&gt; &gt;&gt; learning advanced course lessons

&gt; &gt;  This still involves seeing &quot;anger and attack&quot; (tormenting, abuse,
&gt; &gt; trolls, etc) in someone else &quot;out there&quot;.   First making it real (out
&gt; &gt; there, in someone else) in order to then deal with it (course beliefs
&gt; &gt; or not)

&gt; &gt;   How does this fit with the idea of projection?  Seeing something
&gt; &gt; out there (in a brother) a person doesn't want to see, face, deal
&gt; &gt; with, where it really is, inside themself?

&gt; &gt;    Or, does the course mean something else when it speaks of this and
&gt; &gt; project and says it's never anything &quot;out there&quot; in any one else. Only
&gt; &gt; the mind of the one seeing it (making it real) &quot;out there&quot; that needs
&gt; &gt; to realize where it reallly is, and where any solutions to seeing it
&gt; &gt; differently are.

&gt; &gt;    Tho, the way you discribe it is the way Raj does, too. There
&gt; &gt; reallly are mean, evil people who can and do attack  (out there) (even
&gt; &gt; if in one case, Raj was  basically the only one seeing it that way)
&gt; &gt; that do need defense and maybe even counter attack to keep one safe
&gt; &gt; from.

&gt; &gt;   There's all that in the course about defensless being our only
&gt; &gt; safety and the need FOR defense being the only thing that makes
&gt; &gt; &quot;attack&quot; attack.

&gt; &gt;    If your way of seeing ACIM is realy the true way, seeing mean,
&gt; &gt; evil people  (and problems with them that need to be fixed) &quot;out
&gt; &gt; there&quot; is correct and it's not the mind that is seeing it this way-
&gt; &gt; projecting it and creating it as real in that way, this basically
&gt; &gt; makes what the course says meaningless.

&gt; &gt;   or, once again proves the idea everyone has their own version of
&gt; &gt; truth, reality (and A Course in Miracles)

&gt; &gt;       Whatever feels good and right to you.

&gt; Level confusion?!

&gt;  &quot;...external conditions are produced by the thoughts of many, not all of
&gt;  whom are pure in heart as yet.&quot;

">

and people can't follow what *I* write?

Do I need a mind like a fork twisting spaghetti to understand this
stuff?

Though if you're saying that mass conscsiousness creates what we
believe is 'reality&quot; (out there, the world, illusion, etc) I agree
with that. If some might not be pure in heart, those who are would
make up for it. So, in a way, everyone who does know ACIM and what it
says should be living it, and adding as much light and joy and peace
as possible to the overall.

Right. Let's try your method of &quot;Living the Course.&quot; Bring in a
complete raving lunatic like Dean to bring out issues and then blame
people for seeing a complete raving lunatic and further blame them for
not being grateful for being subjected to a raving lunactic. Yeah, the
Carrie Starchild method of spirituality. That's wanted no where, and
not welcomed, and can only be forced on others by aggravation and
repetition

What most of here know is there was an irresponsible creep like you in
Jones Town, telling men, woman and children to drink the Kool Aid,
because it was good for them, and God wanted it, and that was what Jim
Jones wanted. You play the exact same role for Katie Dean.

So get this sweetheart. If you aren't responsible for the creepy stuff
you attempt to pull off, then all of us are going to call you on it.

We aren't drinking the Katie Dean Kool Aid. Which is exactly the
poison you push and call it &quot;living the course.&quot;

concerned  if she was going to be a party in a criminal cyber stalking
complaint.

Now lets review your position on cyber stalking:

The victim asked for it.

If anyone complains, the cyber stalker is justified in continuing her
stalking.

The cyber stalker is bringing up issues in the victim, so the victim
should be grateful to the cyber stalker.

Oh, yeah, cyber stalking cannot be cyber stalking because the cyber
stalker must believe what she says and does is right.

I think people understand what you say, they just have a hard time
believing you say the dumb and ethically repugnant things you say
without the least bit of embarrassment. And even worse, attempt to
justify the ethically repugnant with spiritual quotes. Then attempt to
shame people into accepting your wacko beliefs.

If you wish to argue ACIM as spiritual justification for Nazis,
bullies, cyber stalkers and child murderers, then I suspect you are
going to have go through me, Nancy, Maz, Bill, Kay, Sheryl, Deborah,
Lee, Alan and all the rest who understand your ideas and actions are a
destructive force encouraging chaos.
