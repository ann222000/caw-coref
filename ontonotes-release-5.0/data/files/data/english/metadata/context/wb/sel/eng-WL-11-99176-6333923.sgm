Colin Powell continues to lie to try to recover something of his reputation: "Former US secretary of state Colin Powell claims he is 'furious and angry' about being misinformed over Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

"'Hundreds of millions followed it on television,' Mr Powell said of his testimony. 'I will always be the one who presented it. I have to live with that.'

"Mr Powell told Germany's Stern magazine that before appearing at the UN he had spent four days with the Central Intelligence Agency inspecting every photograph and word.

"'The CIA believed there were weapons of mass destruction,' Mr Powell said. 'The President believed it. I believed it. Still, it was wrong. I did not know this at the time.'" The facts are otherwise. The CIA believed there might be weapons of mass destruction. And anyone with half a brain could see through the case presented by Powell at the U.N., which was thinner than the gruel served to Oliver Twist, as I documented here more than a year ago. If what Powell presented at the U.N. was the best evidence, and we have to assume it was since the U.S. definitely wanted to pursuade the world that it had a case for invasion, then it is 100% clear that they didn't "know" anything with remotely the certainty conveyed by Powell during that speech, with such phrases as "This is evidence, not conjecture. This is true. This is all well documented."

WIIIAI writes today that he (?) is agnostic about my claim that the Bush administration really didn't believe its own lies, and suggests that the lackadaisical search for WMD was due simply to incompetence. So I need to elaborate on my argument. The entire public justification for the invasion was that Iraq had stockpiles of WMD, was collaborating with Al Qaeda, and was likely to give some of those WMD to AQ at any time to be used against the United States. If that was something you believed, then your entire war strategy would be geared toward preventing such a thing from happening. As soon as possible you would be dropping special squads of commandos at known or suspected sites like Tuwaitha and Al Qaqaa and securing them (instead of securing the oil fields). But not only wasn't that done with the highest priority, in some cases (like the two mentioned), it was barely done at all! Incompetence? Sorry, not buying it.

(Hat tip to WTF Is It Now? for the Powell story lead)

Added note: By the way, if Powell were really "furious and angry", wouldn't it be appropriate for him to be denouncing his former boss and co-workers on Meet the Press or some other American news show, instead of revealing his supposed anger to Stern magazine in Germany? Evidently he's not all that angry.

That's angry with his tail between his legs. Next he will be discussing his disagreement with Bush with Big Buns Magazine.

Powell's moral character...oh, what moral character.

He's a clown, for a fool, for a cabal of rich guys. With weapons.

Well, the whole stated reason for invading Afghanistan was to capture Osama bin Laden, and that hasn't happened either. And whatever their real aims in Iraq, two years of chaos do not suggest that their tactics were well chosen. Really, you cannot overestimate these people's incompetence. But I'm not dismissive of your argument, merely agnostic. Another point in favor of your claim is that almost nothing was done to equip American troops for chemical or bio. warfare.

the whole wmd thing was a transparent lie from the start. the biggest hint that the administration didn't believe their own claims: that they invaded iraq at all! if there's one thing that's certain of u.s. military adventurism (particularly since vietnam)...it has invariably meant picking (what the decision-makers believe to be)'safe' fights.

WIIIAI, beyond Eli's clarifications, I add another argument: they probably believed that the issue will be quickly forgotten after the victory, and not exercise public opinion years later when the truth gets out.

Oh, come on people! Colin Powell has been lying for years. Like the scorpion hitching a ride, he rarely bites, but he sure knows how.

Case in point - the My Lai Massacre. From Wikipedia: Colin Powell, then a young US Army Major, was charged with investigating the massacre. Powell wrote: "In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between American soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent." Later, Powell's refutation would be called an act of "white-washing" the news of the Massacre, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public.

How many died as a result of that lie? One that I know personally - SP4 Dave Cassidy, my good buddy, KIA Bien Hoa, 11/22/68. "Tu Quoc Ghi O'n, Anh Ca!"

Let's face the truth - they are all War Pigs.

I think Eli is completely right on this one. Not only did the Bushies know that Iraq had no WMD's, so did the Clintonistas (including Dem hawks like Kerry). The years of UN inspections and the Hussein Kamel (sp?) intelligence clearly indicated that there was at most almost nothing there. Powell and Condiliar said as much in early 2001 before they'd finished their Kool-Aid.

Oil was the reason, WMD's the excuse, the whole Bush administration and many Congressional whores were the liars. (See Kerry's 2002 speech defending his vote for the war--he was lying just like Powell did the following February.)

And even if a few of these scumbags still did actually believe the WMD fairy tale in late 2002--there were FOUR MONTHS of further UN inspections which proved them wrong. We knew then that the "intelligence" was flawed, but we went to war anyway.

Kerry is NOT a hawk. The vote for that Iraq resolution was NOT authorization of war, and Bush didn't NEED authorization anyhow, as he proved.

The Senate Dems split the vote, 25/25. That's party discipline, not support of Bush policy.

Kerry SPECIFICALLY outed USPNAC airbases and repudiated the policy in the first debate, which was seen by 60 million Americans. He said, "The US has NO legitimate longterm interest in staying in Iraq."

He took considerable flack for not voting for the first $87 million.

And he won the election, but Bush stole this one too.

As for WMD, it is possible that there were some WMD in Iraq. It is obvious that whether or not they did, Bush and his cronies couldn't have cared less.

You ignore the murder of Wellstone, and the anthrax attacks on the Dem Senate leader. Very easy to toss around words like you are, but you aren't stuck in the lion's cage either. I only have the representatives I have. I still support John Kerry, he won the election, and Bush didn't. And he did not support the Iraq policy Bush rammed down the country's throat.

Paul: You couldn't be more wrong about Kerry. He supported Bush's war--he and everyone else in Congress knew that's exactly what they were voting on. In Kerry's speech explaining his vote for the war (see http://www.independentsforkerry....erry-iraq.html) , he takes as a given that Saddam had WMD's. In fact, aside from whining at the TIMING of the resolution, he sounds just like Condi Rice or Wolfowitz.

And then during last year's campaign, he repeatedly defended that criminal vote, even saying he'd do it again KNOWING that Saddam didn't have WMD's. That's a PRO-WAR candidate, Paul. An anti-war candidate would have won the election easily.

The Democrats will never win another election trying to out-hawk the Repugs like Kerry did (remember 40,000 MORE troops, Paul?).

PS--I voted for the bastard out of desperation, but he's still a bastard.

And I haven't forgotten about anthrax or Wellstone--but Kerry certainly did. Did he mention either one once during the campaign?

Eli,

If you read Glen Rangwala's 50-page dissection of Bush's, Blair's and Powell's war-motivating speeches in late 2002 &amp; early 2003, it is obvious, and not at all indirectly, that the case for WMDs was based on pure bullshit. It is found at www.traprockpeace.org.
