The third season of &quot;Avatar&quot; is set to start tomorrow.  Yesterday,
NickToons reran the Season 1 recap short.  Then the network filled out the
rest of the half hour with two super deformed shorts that I had never seen
before:

Aang challenges Sokka and his poor swamp relations to a water skiing
throwdown.  Lots of Sokka fanservice for fangirls. :-)

Aang, Katara, Toph and Zuko argue about which bending's the best.  Man
superdeformed Toph is UGLY. :-)

Are these on the DVD?

I believe there are 3 shorts on the DVDs,
&quot;Shipping&quot; of which being online, so yeah.

Laters. =)

The DVD has those three, plus a &quot;digital comic book&quot; which is mostly
still images with audio that I assume is also from the web site. That
seems to fill in what was going on in Aang's mind between the time he
loses the fight at the end of season 2 and when he wakes up on the
Bison in the final scene.

Saw the new ep of Avatar tonight, and they followed it with one of the
shorts, a rock, paper, sizzors, thing followed with a which element is best
fight.  That's just Omake, not super deformed shorts.  Think AMG
Mini-Goddesses.  That short was hilarious.
