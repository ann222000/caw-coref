Hi All,

I'd imagine this has been answered before but I can't find a succinct
answer.  Story so far:

1) Walls been re-plastered.
2) Waited 2 weeks, as recommended by plasterer.
3) First coat dilute 25%.
4) Remaining 3 coats normal

And joy of joys I've got cracks and blisters in the painting
(bathroom ceiling and hall walls).  Whether I didn't dilute enough, or
that store paint was false economoy - I don't know.

What I really need help with is how to fix the problem?!

1) peel and sand back the cracks and blisters (an unpleasant
thought)
2) first coat dilute, again.
3) repaint as normal

Should I use surface filler, or PVA or some other clever method I've
not heard of.  I'm concerned the cracks and flakes will show once
painted over.

I'd appreciate any help, this has really got me frustrated, and I
don't want to do it again just to see the same happen...

Thanks,
John - a painting Idiot!

I had the kitchen walls and ceiling plastered today, and the plasterer
told me that they can be painted after only 4 days...

A lot of this depends on the extent of the plastering (e.g.
reskim verses full plaster) and the type of paint used.
No details were given on either count.
No details were given on which coat failed to stick.

I would suggest waiting at least a week after the plaster
looks dry (returned to light colour) and then you would
be OK with matt emulsion (first coat diluted, more the
more shiney the plaster finish). Any paint which seals
the surface (silk, gloss, and kitchen/bathroom paints)
should wait longer, until you're sure the plaster is
completely dry. There are special matt emulsions for
using on wet plaster, but I've never tried them.

Not Crown paint is it ? Only ever fine &quot;spider like&quot; cracking with Crown
paint on new plaster.

I peeled, scraped, sanded it the cracked paint off, sanded, weak PVA'ed,
re-skimmed, re-sealed with proper Dulux plaster sealer followed by two Dulux
Vinyl Sheen coats. That was years ago and looks fine.

Thanks for the replies..sorry, here's more detail

1) Plaster was all re-skim, also noticed that it has happened over
painted walls too, but not as much. Predominately in the corners, but
not exclusively.
2) Paint is emulsion matt (hall) and satin (bathroom)
3) Paint is B&amp;Q 'Colour' range.

I really don't want to re-skim (plastering is an art form that I beats
me).  Any other suggestions would be much appreciated.
