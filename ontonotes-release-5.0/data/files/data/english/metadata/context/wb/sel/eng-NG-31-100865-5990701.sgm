Well we got our wires crossed...

The dog was WONDERFUL... and absolutely PERFECT for
everything we needed... but... and here it is folks... He wasn't
a cross rottie, (which we were told he was, and from seeing
him I KNEW he was crossed with something at some point)
but he was just a very very large american pit bull...  now
before anyone says anything, we personally had no problems
with him in any way... but he was to be trained as a service
dog, and with explaining our sons condition to keep people
from discriminating against him, we couldn't have the added
task of explaining why this pitbull was a service dog...

*sigh*...

We only had him for two days, but it doesn't take long to
become hopelessly attached to such a wonderful dog like him...
we found out he loved to lick heels at nighttime when he got
bored... *okay, well I found that out... *

He didn't jump on people, little kids came into our yard to
play and pet him, and he was sooooo docile with them despite
him being larger and kinda clumsy due to puppiness... but we
also live in a very populated kids area... and the locals will
inquire as to why their kids are playing with a pitbull... and
we don't need the papers coming to interview us for any reason...

But on the bright side, hes at his 'home' right now at the vet
students home with a humongoid yellow lab, and his bestest buddy,
as well as three cats hes become accustomed to... and there was a
waiting list for him, but we were given first chance, and I'm sooo
glad I did know how good these dogs were...

If we owned our own home he would never have left
and we would have just added another dog for our son...

anyhow...

feeling kinda low... but still looking for another dog, cause
now we know more of what to expect and what we want...

I'm going to go bawl right now...

Subject:           Prong Collars

Groups:   alt.pets.dogs.labrador

prong collars although they look vicious, can work for normal
dogs...if a dog is more than anxious to just go, it will likely
cause damage cause we all know if a lab is gonna chase that
squirrel, its gonna chase that squirrel... So you have to decide
if it will be more deterred to chase the squirrel by causeing it
some pain, *not always a bad thing particularily if you atrying
to train a very large dog that could do a lot of damage if loose
and untrained* or if you want to fight with the dog

choking and still pulling possibly causing muscle damage...

it works by causeing a tad bit of pain when they start pulling,
then they stop... the choke collars when used by people who don't
know how to use choke collars *which a LOT don't* can cause more
muscle pain/spasms pulls etc, than the prongs.

so on average, there are more # of damaged dogs with choke
collars than prongs, however the prongs when they cause damage
might be more vicous in general.

does that make sense...

I'm personally a halty person myself, however while growing up
my former stepfather was a choker training... *and thats why his
dogs bite and were'nt trained well at all* He had no clue how to
train.

I never knew about a halty till I had to train my lab... and although
she does pull, on the way back from walks she's not pulling at all...
so I only use the halty for part of our walk to begin with.

ever notice, those prong collars don't need to be used on smaller
dogs... walking with treats and consistency along wtih a halty is
likely the best way to train...

I also noticed if you keep the head held higher, they are less
likely to pull as well... so a short leash with the collar right
under the ears and jaw seems to work... and with no choking when
that squirrel runs by...

Not bloody likely!  Hubby put some on his shoe laces which when

originally sniffed, our lovely black lab wouldn't even go near!

So today, she was grabbing at his socks while at the table, so
he put some on his socks and she licked his fingers... for a
few moments she was rubbing her head and face on the floor,
then she came back for more!  he put the bottle down for her,
(It only had a few drops in it, thinking she must not know that
this is the source of her pain) and she licked it... twice...
ran away, then came back and waited patently for him to put it
down again!  not once or twice, or even three times, but a total
of five times she had a good lick of sauce...

We had to cut her off, but alas, we know now she is truly our dog!

Part of the ingredients is of course vinigar which we found out
rather early, that she loves the stuff. (we used it to spray over
her 'accidents' and she would run and lap it up before it hit the
floor)

Anyhow... now we need another deterrent to keep her from eating

shoelaces. Aside from standard training, shes starting her teething
phase and its all we can do to keep her from eating the couch... *G*...

so anyone know of any rreeeeaaaaaaalllllllyyy good non edible but
tasty chew toys out there she may like?  I'm thinking about putting
some sauce on some of her other toys if I didn't think it may hurt
coming out!  (before the flames, we won't be doing that)

Shes pretty happy here so far, despite being held down on occassion
for training, and crated at night... and having to sit stand down sit
down
for each individual piece of food twice a day... (she gets bored if she

has to actually eat from her bowl!! and won't eat much until we pick it

up so she can do her down sit etc...)

the dog will be with my son 24 hours a day... we need a dog that
won't be questioned... regardless of where we live or move to.

We had him for a day and a half, -two days, and my son, the little
girl that I babysit, and even my mum in law, had no problems with
the breed, the girl that I babysit didn't know the 'stigmatism'
that goes with the pit bull breed, but she was disgusted to find
out what they were bred for in the first place, and laughed when
we said what a vicious dog he was when he stuck his head under
the pillow to sleep... I do hate to say this, but we live in  an area
of low income, white trash families, most of whome I suspect would
make a great deal about their kids playing with a 'pit bull'...

I don't have time to teach everyone about dogs, nor do I have time
to teach everyone about my sons condition...  Kids make fun of him
as is because hes slower to respond and move...

Tell me how to handle this situation...

I'm totally exasburated by critisism and being called narrow minded
because I'm not trying the lated medication, or the latest implant
electronic gadgets for my son, and I do accupunture for him instead,
and my husband and I haven't been away from our son for more than 3
hours at a time because everyones too nervous around him and his
seizures that we don't need to add another burden of
nervousness........

Our son, first of all, is epileptic... He requires a LOT... and
there are laws in certain countries that have banned the breed
entirely.  The dog would have to be muzzled in some places, which
limited our sons movements in those places, and in some other places
my son and the dog would be discriminated against.  and he was a
purebred , not a mix... non aggressive, easy going and wonderful.

But neither the dog nor my son needs to be confronted by people
who don't understand.  The dog would be trained to fetch an adult
such as myself or if bychance they were alone in the mall or
something, another adult to the situation.  He would have to fetch
and carry medication, brace for my son to stand up, pull him over
to his side, and he couldn't do any of this if he were forced to
wear a muzzle.

There are few laws protecting the rights of assistance dogs that
I've actually managed to find.

We fight with the doctors, we fight with the teachers, we fight
with ALL of the other kids to accept our son, and its always an
ongoing battle... we wanted the dog to assist us.  Had it been
a mix, we could have 'faked' the mix name.

I don't need to give anyone a reason as to why we returned the
dog... but we did what we felt best for the dog and for our
situation.  Again had we owned our own home,we would have just
got another dog for our son...  but its going to a great home...
like I said there was a waiting list for this particular dog from
familys and vets...

&gt; You are kidding, right?  You passed up a &quot;perfect&quot; assistance

Thank you for this response...

I'd been brought up around people with tonnes of different
disabilities, and have no problem talking with them about
them or differently than I would with someone whos disability
is ignorance... *My aunt was slow at learning and born without
a hipbone and a bunch of other problems, so when she was sixteen
she went to live in a group home and came home for weekends and
holidays and grandma and grandpa went out to visit every other
day, and there were a lot of kids that were just 'dropped off'
there, so we never knew who we'd have over for the holidays,
because of one reason or another...

I'm positive a therapy dog living in permanent residence in

some of these homes would really help out a LOT...*  My aunt
is training one of her dogs to hold her wheelchair for her
when she gets into it, and shes wanting to train it to assist
her in opening doors and pulling her chair.

Shes been living on her own, has a house, husband, two dogs,
(both rescues) and two cats... (so much for the doctor saying
that she was going to die in 9 months and to forget about her
to my grandma when she was born)... but she lives in a smaller
town, where the kids are separated from special needs kids in
schools and play...

My aunt was even aproached and yelled at because 'she was too
damn lazy to get off her ass and WALk like the rest of the normal
people'... *sigh*... I reaaaaalllly want to build  a spaceship
and move!... *G*

Our freinds all have sided with us, even though they were becoming
quite attached the little guy too... but I do beleive we will probably
rescue an animal and pay for the vet bills and such for x rays and eye
certification... in a town not too far away, they've posted a sign on

their spca saying that they cannot take any more dogs as they have too
many already.  and I just listened to ours, and it too is pretty
full...

Another note:  up until a few years ago, there were only labs,
shepards, and toy poodles, and the odd terrier type as regulars,
now every second dog listed in the kennels is pitbull cross and
rottweiller cross... sometimes both...

I've never heard so many pitbulls mentioned before in shelters
and rescues... *sigh*....  but I KNOW the one we gave up IS going
to a good home with lots of luv and attentions...

In a world of paranoia and ignorance people always err on the side
of caution... and in a world of mass media... well... that just gets

worse... I know how the media likes to bend things, so i only read
between the lines of newspapers, and never the full article, you
wind up getting better more reliable information if you miss a word
or two...

Hello Fans,

As the leading dog behavior and training guru/personality of
our times, and as the ceo of the most important dogcasting
network on the planet, I think it's only fair that I jump in
here and break it down a little like this. I specialize not
only in dogs, but in making complicated issues easy to
understand.

Which brings us to Jerry Howe.

Jerry Howe knows moore about dogs and dog trainers and dog
training methods than anyone who participates here. As for
me, I have more skill than anyone here. As a result, I can
train dogs brilliantly, and dramatically, even offleash on
busy four lane highways in the concrete wastelands of
America...

http://dogtv.com/4LANE3.rm

without having to worry about following any of Jerry's rigid
guidelines for training dogs, or breaking any of the rules
in his "gestalt" approach. And, for that matter, without
having to rely on non-Jerry methods such as shock collars or
having to use force which makes my dogs "will to resist fade
in importance."

You see, fans, I got my own methods, and you'll be finding
out about those presently

HOWE-ever, this is about Jerry, so let's talk Jerry.

Most newbies here, or other people who are struggling,
clueless and frustrated and doing things to train their dog
that they know they should not do, or would rather not do,
which either aren't working, or are even making things
worse, etc...and so forth, can, via following the techniques
in Jerry's FREE manual, get excellent results in a short
period of time.

He'll tell you HOWE, and I'll tell you WHY.

Most of you have heard of Pavlov's bell, where dogs became
conditioned to salivate at the sound of a bell after they
were repeatedly fed immediately after the sound of the bell.

That's called conditioning.

And, while Jerry forcefully argues against the use of what
he calls "food bribes" (which is HOWE, many other kinds of
animals are trained, for instance, dolphins) dogs can be
trained/conditioned with or without the use of food.

Jerry chooses to go the non food route exclusively, and
claims to get effective results, quickly, in virtually any
kind of dog or situation.  Nothing in my  brilliant
guru-ness leads me to believe that he is not being
truthful with most of his claims about his training methods.

And scientific conditioning, which applies and is effective
on all dogs, and most other mammals and higher life forms,
is the basis of Jerry's training. This is why, when Jerry
says "a dog is a dog is a dog" he is correct, in a sense.
Yes, there are breed differences, but yes, all dogs,
regardless of breed, can be conditioned using scientific
methods.

As for Jerry's behavior here, I'm not a human trainer, and
I don't try to train humans. But I do deal with people in
the same brilliant way that I deal with dogs. I don't keep
doing something which isn't working in order to try to get
people to behave, any more than I try to do the same w/
dogs.

The moore you try to force Jerry, or put Jerry in a Time Out
or report him to his ISP, the worse his behavior gets.

Jerry is on a one man Jihad to expose and discredit trainers
who use this same idea of escalating punitivism, on dogs,
which Jerry believes is responsible for causing the best
dogs to get killed because of the fact that they will not
submit to this linear approach of escalating force and
punishment.

His classic example of this phenomenon is a german
shepherd named "Fritz" (do a google search).

Many of Jerry's critics have a vested interest in Jerry
being crazy. Because if he isn't, it makes them crazy for
preaching that Jerry is crazy, so hard and for so long.
But regardless, to anyone interested in training their dog
effectively without force or punishment, Jerry's mental
state is irrelevant and his advice is generally excellent,
if sometimes overbearing.

And finally, Jerry's approach is especially valuable for
interrupting, stopping or extinguishing unwanted behaviors.
I'm not so sure howe good it is when it comes to getting
creative results out of dogs, or for teaching dogs tricks or
complicated sequences (at least as far as I can tell). My
only caveat with Jerry's method is that the idea of
extinguishing behaviors is kind of like extinguishing
biodiversity or any other resource.  Each behavior is a
resource to me, not necessarily a problem to be
extinguished. You have to be careful what you extinguish.

But, like jerry says, dogs don't do right or wrong, they
do "dog." And his method does not punish them for doing
wrong. It only tries to extinguish certain aspects of "dog"
which can be problematical for people.

That's all for now, gotta go back to my new job at an IT
expert. It's a long and grueling one mile walk from home.

Subject:   Train Your Dog Using Pure Pleasure.
No Rewards, No Corrections, No Consequences
Except Exemplary Behaviors And Fulfilling Relationships

1 From:  Jerry Howe
Date:  Wed, Oct 17 2001 3:47 pm

Hello People,

Given the state of the art of dog training today we have expert
dog trainers like captain haggarty who occasionally writes for
the akc gazette (see my post "accentuate the positive," a review
of haggarty's article decrying pure positive trainers in the gazzette)
and our "experts" here who know HOWE to inflict pain properly on their
dogs that have no rights, and killing dogs that don't withstand
their lessons.

Well folks, that's why you're reading this forum, because your
"experts" recommended by your breeders, veterinarians, groomers,
rescue and shelter orgainzations rely on are the same self
appointed experts I've discredited here who tell us to jerk,
choke, shock, bribe, crate, bite, chin cuff, scruff shake, twist
and pinch ears and toes, beat, and hang dogs until "resisting
your will fades in importance" according to our "expert" lying
frosty dahl.

Look at this hypocrisy here:

lying douuble talking "I LOVE KOEHLER" lynn sez: "Punishing
them for jumping up is nowhere near as effective as rewarding
them for sitting to greet."

I don't punish and I don't reward. That's why you bums have
behavior problems and my FREE Wits' End Dog Training Method
manual student's do not.

Nor do they have the anticipated "adolescent rebellious stage"
because Wits' End trainers do not confront or force their dogs,
so there's nothing to rebell about.

We don't punish or crate dogs to force control of behaviors,
we address them using appropriate techniques, the ones our
"experts?" who need to use pronged spiked pinch choke collars,
crates, punishment, pain, and death to control BAD BEHAVIORS
tell you won't work, because if you find out that they do,
THEY'RE OUTTA BUSINESS.

"So rather than punish the jump, we give a correction" sez
our douuble talker. Our experts will agree: "That gentle and
joking "silly dog......" is a correction."

And I said "Sure beats getting whipped with dahl's 40" hickory
switch or a hangin."

And our expert lying "I LOVE KOEHLER" lynn said: "Every bit as
much of a correction as a nick with an electronic collar to
indicate that it isn't a wanted behavior."

"Rather than punish the jump we give a correction?"

Does that make any sense on any level? You're mimicking professor
lying doc "scruff shake" dermer who punishes behaviors and not the
dog. You're double talking us again because you don't know HOWE to
train a dog without hurting him.

Take my reward money if you think you can.

$1000.00 dollar reward for dual shock collar challenge to break dog
aggression.

$100.00 dollar reward for dual shock collar challenge to cure shyness.

$100.00 for any non restrictive non force TRAINING method for breaking
coprophagia, hole digging, trash can raiding, kitty litter kat krunchie
munching...

Get my drift?
