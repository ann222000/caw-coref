Anyone know what size spanner I need to undo this with? 10mm is too big,
so is it 8 or 9mm.

Would I be wasting my time using anything other than a specialist brake
spanner? From personal experience, what's the likelihood of them shearing
off (20%, 50%)?

I'm renewing the brake fluid. Presumably, I only need to get one on each
diagonal circuit to undo.

Any tips (including maybe, use a garage) welcome.

If they're the same as mine they'll be 7mm on the front and 8mm on the
back, you can undo them with any old round spanner. They shouldnt shear
off unless you whack them with a hammer or something, but dont overdo
it if they wont go, as if they do shear off you'll need to replace the
whole caliper or get it drilled out.

If you're going to do it, do it properly ;) you wont be able to bleed
it properly unless you can undo all the nipples, also if you want to
get it done dead quick, invest in a pneumatic bleed kit (not
expensive), especially if you plan on doing it by yourself.

It's certainly not worth getting a garage to do it if you feel like
doing it yourself! Shouldn't take you more than an hour or two at most.

Cheers
Andy

Thanks Andy,

I already have an Eazibleed pressure kit and have checked that it includes
the correct size cap. I've used it on a couple of other cars before, but
I've done a Google and read some horror stories where the nipple's sheared
off.

Ah well, if it shears off while you're undoing it then it'd shear off
for a garage too ;) I've seen them missing before but I dont know
whether that was from over zealous tightening or just road debris
knocking them off... as long as you just do them up so they stop
leaking there shouldnt be a problem.

When I had to do mine, both of the front nipples sheared off (without the
use of excessive force) = Two new calipers...
The materials Pug used for the caliper and the nipple seem to bond
chemically after a while, although I had bled the system only about 12
months previously.

According to the chap at the motor factors, this was the most common reason
for people buying recon calipers!

Same for me and I had put some copper grease on the threads about a year
before.
