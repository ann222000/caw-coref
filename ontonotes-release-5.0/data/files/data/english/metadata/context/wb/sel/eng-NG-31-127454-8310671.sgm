Spoilers for HP 7 Deadly Hallows

1. Ron could fake parseltongue and get into chamber of secrets? WTF???

2. Mrs Weasly out duels Bellatrix? Right. Very believable.

3. What the necessity of the whole Gwarp and Giants Saga that wasted
so much space in Book 5 - their role was throw away and incidental in
HP7?

4. All the major deaths - school mates and teachers were not very
moving at all. I was more shocked by the death of the pet than Snape,
George, Creevy or Lupin/Tonks. Sudden death is great for shock value
once (Cedric) or twice (Dobby). For the others you need a buildup and
investment in tension to make an impact. Here most people we would
care about mostly died off-screen.

5. A desperate voldemort who is racing against time to save his
remaining horcruxes declares a ultimatum and gives harry an extra hour
to run around finding/destroying horcruxes?! Is LV a congenital idiot?

6. The way each of Ron, Hermione and Neville get a horcrux each to
destroy seemed forced rather than natural. Specially the Hermione one.

7. Lupin was really loony in this book. What the hell happened to the
reserved, flawed and wise Lupin from Book 3? A great character was
turned into a melodramatic idiot.

8. It was so trivial to infiltrate Gringotts. All you need was to
confound and imperious a few people. Gringott security hype no longer
lived up to the reality. Griphook seemed to make no real contribution
to the breaking so don't know why he was needed (other than to give a
token representation to Goblins).

9. The way people (McGonagall) were throwing around forbidden curses
was surprising. They made such a big deal out of it. It seemed out of
character that McGonagal would not have moral objections to their use
(if not legal ones).

10. No explanation was gives as to why hogwarts sided with OOTP in the
battle of hogwarts rather than the DE who were actually running the
school. Hogwarts can make moral judgments?

11. The cavalry finally making up their minds and fighting against LV
*after* harry had been killed made no sense at all. What prompted this
now suicidal change of heart?

12. Why didn't voldemort make a run for it when he was cornered and
all his horcruxes had been destroyed. He never seemed to have problem
running away before. What kind of idiot would cast a killing curse for
a third time after it had backfired twice already.

13. What's with the 'do you feel lucky punk?' speech from Harry to
voldy at the very end?

PS: The leaked version of HP7 is the correct version after checking
the book reviews at NY Times etc.
PPS: Personal disappointment. Hagrid didn't take a dirt nap.
PPS: Personal disappointment number 2. Not one slytherin sided with
Harry against Voldemort. Slytherins are portrayed as uniformly
supporting/condoning evil till the very end (except the three faculty
members).

Point is, they were at war and a fierce battle was raging. IMO it would
have been quite unlikely for none of the 'popular' characters to have died
given those kind of enemies.

Indeed. The way Parseltongue was mysteriously portrayed, and it was
mentioned multiple times that Harry and the Dark Lord were the only
two individuals with the gift, you'd think a bit more respect would
be accorded to it. Ron faking Parseltongue and the CoS fooled by
him!?

Also notice one another thing? Harry calls Alastor Moody as &quot;Mad-Eye&quot;

He's been portrayed as nearly a moron in this purported book. In the

he was also very charismatic and intelligent, except that he doesn't

Why is that? Just because it's the NYT they might not just have reviewed

I can relate to that cause I was always thinking of Ron as a stupid git,
kinda the Wormtail of the trio albeit not evil of course. I never
understood that Hermione got interested in him (opposites attract?) and I
also did not consider it necessary from a story-telling point of view.

However, now that it happened I only wanted Hermione to be happy so let him
live...

This &quot;review&quot; could very well be a part of an ingenious ploy - wouldn't Scholastic/Bloomsbury have forced nytimes.com to take it down by now, seeing as it does give an awful lot away about the Deathly Hallows, especially the fact that they're not the same as the Horcruxes?

And I agree that - if it was the real thing - it was certainly the worst of all the books by far. The Epilogue, especially the naming of the kids has 'Captain Obvious' written all over it, it's like all the clichés condensed into one chapter - all of the main characters surviving and living happily with their loved ones...

No, I refuse to believe that this is what Rowling is so proud of - most fanfics are better than this.

I had a similar feeling about Sirius Black in Book Five.

JKR does have a way of developing great characters in one book and

Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Mad-Eye Moody -- even Luna Lovegood.

The only hope I can see is that the NYT actually did review the online

I've been expecting Hagrid to die since JKR said there was a

the exceedingly dull giant subplot proves to be as pointless as I've
always feared it would be, and won't be sorry if he lives.

Dobby, on the other hand . . .

Yes, there ought to have been some good Slytherins, and the fact there

Fred (but the mistake is understandable - they do look alike. All you

Is it possible that &quot;Hogwarts&quot; is governed by the council of its former

Well there is Snape, the tragic hero of the book, who risks everything for

Slytherin, who stood his ground and fought.  You could also say the Malfoy's

But not only did they not use Unforgivable curses, they, (i.e. the
Order), never made any effort to teach *anything* to Harry. What
little he knew he taught himself with his DA.

Considering that they *knew* that Harry would be a very important
player in the fight against Voldemort and especially considering the
fact that they knew that Voldemort would be after Harry right after
his &quot;rebirth&quot;, it's extraordinarily irresponsible on the part of the
Order, in the way they've dealt with Harry - shuttling him around
from safe house to safe house, not even having a broad consensus
that he should join the order.

Suddenly, one fine, Lupin decides to berate Harry for not going for
the kill with Stan Shunpike!?!

I'm still hoping that this *is* a fake...

&gt;&gt;&gt;Spoilers for HP 7 Deadly Hallows

&gt; &lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;9. The way people (McGonagall) were throwing around forbidden
&gt;&gt;&gt;curses was surprising. They made such a big deal out of it. It
&gt;&gt;&gt;seemed out of character that McGonagal would not have moral
&gt;&gt;&gt;objections to their use (if not legal ones).

&gt;&gt;I think they were just beyond caring. At the beginning, someone
&gt;&gt;(was it Bill or Lupin?) scolded Harry for not using more damaging
&gt;&gt;spells. I think the adult members of the Order should have been
&gt;&gt;using killing curses long before DH.

&gt; But not only did they not use Unforgivable curses, they, (i.e. the
&gt; Order), never made any effort to teach *anything* to Harry. What
&gt; little he knew he taught himself with his DA.

&gt; Considering that they *knew* that Harry would be a very important
&gt; player in the fight against Voldemort and especially considering the
&gt; fact that they knew that Voldemort would be after Harry right after
&gt; his &quot;rebirth&quot;, it's extraordinarily irresponsible on the part of the
&gt; Order, in the way they've dealt with Harry - shuttling him around
&gt; from safe house to safe house, not even having a broad consensus
&gt; that he should join the order.

&gt; Suddenly, one fine, Lupin decides to berate Harry for not going for
&gt; the kill with Stan Shunpike!?!

&gt; I'm still hoping that this *is* a fake...
">

I've advocated from the beginning that DD, Hogwarts, and the Order were
doing too little in educating Harry about basic spells. He took classes
with everyone else. Only the few Lupin lessons in PoA and Snape's
efforts in OotP did Harry get anything more. Hermione knew much more
defensive, protective spells than Harry.

I don't think it's a fake. But I'm not disappointed. Only SS, CoS, and
GoF have lived up to my expectations. PoA was a odd book out, imo, and
OotP &amp; HBP marked a downhill decline in the story. DH was better than
those three.

I think you are being a little harsh.  For starters, I doubt he wanted to
destroy the castle, given his feelings towards it.  Secondly, I doubt he
wants to kill all inside: say what you like about Voldemort, he doesn't seem
to go in for mass murder for its own sake.  He wants to rules the wizarding

He couldn't apparate away.  Besides, he had the Elder Wand, he was

My reading of this &quot;leak&quot; is that Stan Shunpike was put under the
Imperius curse when the DEs attacked Azkaban, to help do their
bidding - a nice, expendable supporter.

Rowling is reportedly &quot;appalled&quot; by the NYTimes review. If so, then
that might indicate that she considers the review to be of the Real
book, in which case, the &quot;scanned&quot; leak *is* most probably the Real

I started skimming the book right during the DE ambush but yeah, I had

Also, I've been in agreement with a livejournal that's been discussing the

start to respond to the NY Times reviews etc, and I started coming to a

I think Rowling might have tried to forewarn us to brace for a
possible disappointment. Remember, a few days back, she said that
she believed some people &quot;will absolutely hate this book&quot;?

I suppose she should have substituted &quot;most&quot; for &quot;some&quot;.

I do believe Rowling has been uncomfortably aware ever since book
five that her writings were increasingly starting to fall below the
expectations of many in her fanbase. The story and the Universe
simply got too unwieldy and complex after GoF, for Rowling to write
reasonable length, gripping books, like the first three were.

Uptil GoF, it was still a children book of magic and mystery. With
OotP things started getting messy and really dark. Also the general
nature of the story shifted from Harry, (and the reader), learning
new things to starting to focus single-mindedly on the looming
confrontation. This dark shadow started becoming really acute from
HBP.

As Rowling has said, HBP and DH are really just one big book, rather
expansive in scope and depressing. Quite a change from the first
five.

Things that I thought we were going to learn, but didn't see in the
&quot;leaked&quot; book when I skimed throught it were:

1.  Weren't we meant to understand why some wizards become ghosts and
others do not?  Does this mean they don't catch the train at Kings Cross?

2.  Was the only thing about Lily's eyes that was important the fact
that it reminded Snape of Lily?  A photo would do.

3.  Was the mirror's only purpose to show glimpses of Dumbledore?

4.  What about the veil?

There was a fanfic that went around about 2 weeks ago that had a similar
ending.  In the Harry dies and gets transported to the Gryffindor common
room where he meets Dumbledore.  The text reads:

&quot;...by imagining a steaming cup of chocolate. It appeared on the end
table next to him in a Hogwarts golden mug. Harry settled back into the
cushions, gazing at the fire and wondering what it was he was supposed
to do here. It seemed a funny place to be after…well, after everything
that had happened tonight. Dispassionately, he realized that he was
uninjured. He had full use of his arms, and there wasn’t even a trace of
blood on his clothing.
“I am glad to see that you have made yourself at home, Harry,” Professor
Dumbledore said, strolling into the room. His long white beard was
knotted at the end, and he held it as he took the chair next to Harry,
conjuring his own cup of hot chocolate and stretching his bare toes to
the fire.
“Sir!” Harry gasped, shocked. Some of his hot chocolate dribbled down
his chin, scalding him.
He wiped it quickly, blinking with astonishment and unable to voice a
coherent thought. Dumbledore merely sipped his own beverage, his blue
eyes twinkling, until Harry blurted, “Am I dead?”
“No, my boy, you most certainly are not dead, thank the Heavens. Your
body has a long recovery ahead, but I am more concerned with your mind,”
Dumbledore said, the sparkle in his eyes dimming as he looked at Harry
over his half-moon spectacles.
“My mind?” Harry asked blankly, feeling that he was several steps
behind. He sat back and tried to relax. Dumbledore was obviously in
charge of the conversation. Some things never changed.
Dumbledore raised his arms and gestured at the vast expanse of
nothingness. “This room…this place…is a representation of your mind,
Harry. Am I right in surmising that you are presently feeling rather
desolate?”
Harry shrugged helplessly, uncertain what to say or even what to make of
all the emptiness. Feeling slight embarrassed, he instead focused on
their immediate surroundings. “It looks like the Gryffindor common room
to me,” he mumbled.
“Yes. I conjured the fire to try and light your way to me. You created
the image in your mind of a place you felt warmth, some security,
perhaps,” Dumbledore said, nodding. “I am, of course, pleased that
Hogwarts has always felt like a home to you.”
“So…this place is inside my mind?” Harry asked, still feeling as if he
were grasping at straws. If that were the case, it looked as if his mind
was rather empty – a fact he was certain Ron would find highly amusing.
“Precisely,” Dumbledore said, smiling approvingly. “The only way to
enter that locked door at the Ministry is within your mind. I imagine
that you are feeling lost and rather hopeless right now, and you felt
the need for explanations hence, you called for me. I suppose I have
traditionally been the one to offer you my advice after you have been
through a trauma.”&quot;

.... then - a little later:

&quot;“Greater service?” Harry asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.
“Am I right in surmising that you knew after Miss Weasley tossed you the
Snitch in the Death Room, and you had uttered the Killing Curse
that you had created your own Horcrux?” Dumbledore asked, his eyes
piercing into Harry’s.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, shrugging. “I worked that part out myself.”
“Miss Granger came to me several weeks ago with her idea, and I thought
it quite splendid that she had worked out so much of the detail. I
merely did a bit of tweaking, as I understood some of the Romanian text
better than she. The Snitch, however, was my idea for the item to be
used as your Horcrux. I told Miss Granger how to charm it to make it fly
directly into the Veil. Rather brilliant, if I do say so myself,”
Dumbledore said, smiling.
“So, I’ve lost part of my soul? Is that why I feel so empty?” Harry
asked, his throat feeling very tight.
“No,” Dumbledore said quickly. “You’ve lost none of your own soul,
Harry. When Miss Granger told you to focus on the love that you felt for
others, it is because that great abundance of love that you hold within
your heart shielded your soul from splitting. The piece of Voldemort’s
soul that was attached to your own like a malignant growth could not
understand that great love. It was that piece that was split off while
your own soul remained whole.”
“So…the soul is split by murder, but love can shield the soul?” Harry
asked, feeling very off-kilter.
“Precisely,” Dumbledore replied. “I think you will find that the
Dementors are less likely to be as drawn to you now that there is only
one soul within you. The other – the evil presence forced upon you – is
gone.”&quot;

I think that the key concept, bandied about in early reviews of Book
7, is one of &quot;inevitability.&quot;  While I agree with some of the points
made by previous posters, I would argue that there is an overarching
consistency of tone and purpose demonstrated here that effectively
ties the series together.  While there are PLENTY of glitches, the
sense that I got was one of closure, and of a complex story
effectively planned and concluded.  In the worlds of fantasy and Young
Adult Literature that is relatively rare feat.

On to the specifics:

&gt; 1. Ron could fake parseltongue and get into chamber of secrets? WTF???
">

This is a legitimate complaint, but the sequence in question is
virtually a throw away that takes place when your focus is supposed to
be elsewhere.  I understand that it took you out of the moment, so to
speak, but it really isn't intended to be pondered over... granted,
racing Harry over to open the chamber would have added less than three
pages, but it wouldn't have added much atmospherically or narratively,
so was dropped.  It also gave Hermione a chance to show some positive
feelings about Ron and his intellect, something lacking from much of
the middle of the book.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2. Mrs Weasly out duels Bellatrix? Right. Very believable.
">

Mama duck syndrome.  Threatened child response.  One of my old writing
teachers (who now writes blockbuster trilogies and Toy Stories for
Disney and doesn't return my calls), told me that he'd track me down
and kill me if I ever used this in one of my stories.  It's cliche and
easy... but for that very reason it's common and familiar.  Lazy
writing, but you see it all the time.  It makes the moms in the
audience well up with pride, and the kids feel protected and loved...
in this case, I thought it was cute the way that it was integrated.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. What the necessity of the whole Gwarp and Giants Saga that wasted
&gt; so much space in Book 5 - their role was throw away and incidental in
&gt; HP7?
">

I think you've actually gotten on the wrong end of a strength here.
There were TONS of moments that were presented as throwaways in this
book that could only be presented as such because the heavy lifting
was done in previous novels.  The way that she dispatched with points
like this one (and house elves, and Olivander, and Centaurs, and the
Chamber of Secrets, and so on and so forth) in a breezy and casual
fashion was impressively confident, concise, and the book benefited
from them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4. All the major deaths - school mates and teachers were not very
&gt; moving at all. I was more shocked by the death of the pet than Snape,
&gt; George, Creevy or Lupin/Tonks. Sudden death is great for shock value
&gt; once (Cedric) or twice (Dobby). For the others you need a buildup and
&gt; investment in tension to make an impact. Here most people we would
&gt; care about mostly died off-screen.
">

Okay.  I'm going to side (more or less) with you on this one.  The
unmourned death toll in this book was WAY out of line.  I understand
that the scope of the evil was such that there were going to be some
losses, but one of the great virtues of literature is that loss can be
dealt with honestly, with seriousness, and with depth of emotion.  The
way that the narrative develops Rowling clearly felt that it was more
important to give value for money with an appropriately scaled battle
sequence, and that meant dispatching with the really affecting deaths,
like Dobby's, early and taking the breaks off for much of the rest of
the book.  I found the experience a little numbing, actually, and felt
that it could have been handled better.  In my eyes, the most
egregious death was Snape's a death that should be appropriately
mourned and honored, but we don't find out why until the chapter after
he dies.  If the sequence could have been reversed, his death could
have had a comparable impact to Sirius's.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 5. A desperate voldemort who is racing against time to save his
&gt; remaining horcruxes declares a ultimatum and gives harry an extra hour
&gt; to run around finding/destroying horcruxes?! Is LV a congenital idiot?
">

Nope.  He just very calculating.  It would have been interesting to
develop this theme a bit more, but, in this book, you get the sense
that his power lies more in the &quot;impression of power&quot; itself, than in
its sheer malevolent application.  When it comes to the unbridled use
of power, he has people to do that for him.  He's the scheming
mastermind to whom they look.  The &quot;hour ultimatum&quot; is a particularly
dark narrative turn when looked at through this lens.  It would have
been especially effective if you had seen more characters doing a
Pansy and threatening to turn Harry over at this point.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 6. The way each of Ron, Hermione and Neville get a horcrux each to
&gt; destroy seemed forced rather than natural. Specially the Hermione one.
">

Lame, yes, but it gives each of them a hand in the killing.  Spreads
the blame.  Leaves nobody alone, character stained by murder, even if
the victim is Voldemort.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 7. Lupin was really loony in this book. What the hell happened to the
&gt; reserved, flawed and wise Lupin from Book 3? A great character was
&gt; turned into a melodramatic idiot.
">

A freer reign was given to his insecurity, just as a freer reign was
given to Tonks' in book 6.  It didn't make him sympathetic, but it did
make his thought process interesting in human terms.  In the end, I
thought it worked, but killing them off was probably a little harsh,
though it created an interesting symmetry of orphans in the
denouement.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 8. It was so trivial to infiltrate Gringotts. All you need was to

&gt; token representation to Goblins).
">

Griphook was overstating his knowledge to get his hands on the sword.
Bill's speech about Goblins alluded to this, but could have been more
explicit.  Its very likely Griphook was a calculating bastard, who
intended to sell them out in the end anyway.  The fact that the Dragon
provided a means of escape was probably overly convenient, but not a
disproportionate stretch.

&gt; was surprising. They made such a big deal out of it. It seemed out of
&gt; character that McGonagal would not have moral objections to their use

">

Forbidden curses were overused in general.  Either they're forbidden,
or their not.  In this book they're treated like the American notion
of handgun ownership; ie. here is a tool that is only good for killing
people at close range who are themselves unarmed... buy as many as you
like... it is forbidden to kill people at close range who are
unarmed...  buy as many as you like.  If you can kill with two words,
and you are at war... you will.  This is a flaw in Rowlings'
conception of the use of magic that runs through all of the books.  If
you don't place limits on the efficacy of magic, everybody uses it all
the time for everything, and taken to its logical conclusion, all of
the peaks and valleys in the narrative are smoothed out by magic's
use.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 10. No explanation was gives as to why hogwarts sided with OOTP in the
&gt; battle of hogwarts rather than the DE who were actually running the

Hogwarts faculty?  Students?  The building itself?  I think that this
is all pretty self explanatory.  The faculty not only supports the
order, many are members.  The students are largely scared and have
inflated notions or right and wrong (as students often do), and this
is a more noble cause to rally behind.  And the loyalty of the
building, creatures, ghosts, et al, is to Dumbledore, who figuratively
and literally speaks their language, and loves them beyond all
measure.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 11. The cavalry finally making up their minds and fighting against LV
&gt; *after* harry had been killed made no sense at all. What prompted this

I saw this as a late arrival factor (except for the Centaurs, who are
a little slow to commit in general).  I didn't really see it as a
change of heart.  More of a deus ex machina coincidence of timing.

He was holding the Elder wand and he thought Harry was bluffing.  He
was looking at a teenager who was claiming to have a better grip on
the practice of magic that Voldemort had studied for his entire life.
There wasn't any question of running away.  It wasn't possible that
Harry was right.

Well... the faculty, as you point out, did stay and fight.  And,
Malfoy takes on an interestingly ambiguous role... he's not supporting
either side terribly effectually.  His confidence is shot.  He's just
kind of bumbling through.  Not sure whether he's on the right side,
but to scared to do anything about it.

Okay, on to my own comments:

First of all, when one is writing, it's easy to confuse being &quot;stuck&quot;
for an idea with your characters being &quot;stuck&quot; narratively.  Rowling
falls into this trap in a big way.  Large chunks of chapters 14 to 23

&gt; Very slim possibilities though.

This &quot;review&quot; could very well be a part of an ingenious ploy - wouldn't Scholastic/Bloomsbury have forced nytimes.com to take it down by now, seeing as it does give an awful lot away about the Deathly Hallows, especially the fact that they're not the same as the Horcruxes?

And I agree that - if it was the real thing - it was certainly the worst of all the books by far. The Epilogue, especially the naming of the kids has 'Captain Obvious' written all over it, it's like all the clichés condensed into one chapter - all of the main characters surviving and living happily with their loved ones...

No, I refuse to believe that this is what Rowling is so proud of - most fanfics are better than this.

I hope your right! I think the kid thing is just so predictable and slightly weird too............

">

Thanks everyone for comments... here are a couple more points that
stuck me.

14. What was the payoff of Snape sticking with LV and firming up his
position with him with so many sacrifices? All he did was hand Harry
the sword which wasnt very vital to begin with and it could have been
handed to him by anyone else. Second he gave Harry his memories -
which were partly self serving and partly informed him of the final
implication of the prophesy. Neither of these actions particularly
required Snape to be with LV. Dumbledore just got snape killed for
pretty much nothing but tidbits of information for the Order (which
was not vital to the downfall of the DEs). After the first reading I
am not entirely sure

15. Why did Dumbledore make Harry personally (rather the trio) locate
and destroy the horcruxes? Anyone (specially someone as capable as
Snape or Kingsley could have done it better and more efficiently).
There was no need for harry to personally destroy them - and for that
matter he didn't - ron, hermoine and neville did destroy some of them.
The only thing that Harry *had* to do by himself was to line up at the
appropriate time and get killed.

17. LV didn't really seem to be a real bad-ass in the final battle. OK
he did battle 3 people at once; but it was a bit underwhelming. He did
nothing impressive at all to show he was a terribly powerful wizard
and why people feared him so. The way it was written DD (in OOTP) and
SS (in HBP) came across as more powerful than LV did in DH.

18. Eldar Wand Changing ownership even when one is not using it for a
duel sounds unconvincing. Who else thinks that Harry as the publicly
known owner of the Eldar Wand is an open invitation to assault and
robbery? And a uncomfortable opening for sequels and fanfics?

As far as they know the last time DD destroyed a horcrux it took his
arm off. Destroying one was emotionally devestating to Ron. Given how
protective Ron was to Hermoine - Ron letting her have the 'honor' of
destroying the horcrux doesn't gel.

Madeye and ilk sure. But dumbledore or Minerva AK'ing people sounds
undigestible. It kind of compromises the very thing that they seemed

&gt; &gt; 13. What's with the 'do you feel lucky punk?' speech from Harry to
&gt; &gt; voldy at the very end?

&gt; It was very dumb. And I was disappointed by the undramatic,
&gt; anti-climatic revival of Harry

&gt; &gt; PS: The leaked version of HP7 is the correct version after checking
&gt; &gt; the book reviews at NY Times etc.
&gt; &gt; PPS: Personal disappointment. Hagrid didn't take a dirt nap.

&gt; Lol, I agree. I was hoping Hagrid would buy it.

&gt; &gt;&gt;10. No explanation was gives as to why hogwarts sided with OOTP in the
&gt; &gt;&gt;battle of hogwarts rather than the DE who were actually running the
&gt; &gt;&gt;school. Hogwarts can make moral judgments?

&gt; &gt; ...Hogwarts does have mind of its own as shown by its not letting
&gt; &gt; Umbridge into the headmaster's office.

&gt; Is it possible that &quot;Hogwarts&quot; is governed by the council of its former
&gt; headmasters?
">

I don't think so. The dead headmasters are not &quot;real&quot;.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Umbridge was not recognised as a headmistress because the
&gt; previous incumbunts did not recognise his sacking? Either that or it was a
&gt; enchantment of Dumbledore's own making.

&gt; Hmm, I wonder if there was a portrait of Snape on the headmaster's wall?

I was hoping harry sees a greasy snape pretending to be sleeping. It
was disappointing that there was no mention of Snape's portrait.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt;PPS: Personal disappointment number 2. Not one slytherin sided with
&gt; &gt;&gt;Harry against Voldemort. Slytherins are portrayed as uniformly
&gt; &gt;&gt;supporting/condoning evil till the very end (except the three faculty
&gt; &gt;&gt;members).

&gt; &gt; Yes, there ought to have been some good Slytherins, and the fact there
&gt; &gt; weren't any makes Harry's telling young Albus in the epilogue that
&gt; &gt; it's all right if he's put in Slytherin seem all the more unlikely.

&gt; Well there is Snape, the tragic hero of the book, who risks everything for
&gt; the love of a dead woman who repudiated him.  And there's Slughorn, head of
&gt; Slytherin, who stood his ground and fought.  You could also say the Malfoy's
&gt; played their part, refused to fight with the Death Eaters, and Narcissa
&gt; played a very significant part by lying about Harry being dead.

&gt; I think that the key concept, bandied about in early reviews of Book

&gt; made by previous posters, I would argue that there is an overarching
&gt; consistency of tone and purpose demonstrated here that effectively
&gt; ties the series together.  While there are PLENTY of glitches, the
&gt; sense that I got was one of closure, and of a complex story
&gt; effectively planned and concluded.  In the worlds of fantasy and Young
&gt; Adult Literature that is relatively rare feat.

&gt; On to the specifics:

&gt; &gt; 1. Ron could fake parseltongue and get into chamber of secrets? WTF???

&gt; This is a legitimate complaint, but the sequence in question is
&gt; virtually a throw away that takes place when your focus is supposed to
&gt; be elsewhere.  I understand that it took you out of the moment, so to
&gt; speak, but it really isn't intended to be pondered over... granted,
&gt; racing Harry over to open the chamber would have added less than three
&gt; pages, but it wouldn't have added much atmospherically or narratively,
&gt; so was dropped.  It also gave Hermione a chance to show some positive
&gt; feelings about Ron and his intellect, something lacking from much of
&gt; the middle of the book.
">

Well - its just bad writing. I could have swallowed Ginny pulling off
a parseltongue (too cute but more plausible given her history) but Ron
hissing... uggghhh!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; 2. Mrs Weasly out duels Bellatrix? Right. Very believable.

&gt; Mama duck syndrome.  Threatened child response.  One of my old writing
&gt; teachers (who now writes blockbuster trilogies and Toy Stories for
&gt; Disney and doesn't return my calls), told me that he'd track me down
&gt; and kill me if I ever used this in one of my stories.  It's cliche and
&gt; easy... but for that very reason it's common and familiar.  Lazy
&gt; writing, but you see it all the time.  It makes the moms in the
&gt; audience well up with pride, and the kids feel protected and loved...
&gt; in this case, I thought it was cute the way that it was integrated.

I hope you teacher didn't teach rowling. Or he would consider this
cause for justifiable homicide.

&gt; &gt; 3. What the necessity of the whole Gwarp and Giants Saga that wasted
&gt; &gt; so much space in Book 5 - their role was throw away and incidental in
&gt; &gt; HP7?

&gt; I think you've actually gotten on the wrong end of a strength here.
&gt; There were TONS of moments that were presented as throwaways in this
&gt; book that could only be presented as such because the heavy lifting
&gt; was done in previous novels.  The way that she dispatched with points
&gt; like this one (and house elves, and Olivander, and Centaurs, and the
&gt; Chamber of Secrets, and so on and so forth) in a breezy and casual
&gt; fashion was impressively confident, concise, and the book benefited
&gt; from them.
">

The crucial difference between Giants and Olivander/Elfs/Centaurs/CoS
was that they were either necessary to the plot of the book where they
were introduced or were a passing mention that added spice and detail
to the world without distracting or boring us or eating up reams of
paper. This is in marked contrast to the Giants saga.

&gt; &gt; 4. All the major deaths - school mates and teachers were not very
&gt; &gt; moving at all. I was more shocked by the death of the pet than Snape,
&gt; &gt; George, Creevy or Lupin/Tonks. Sudden death is great for shock value
&gt; &gt; once (Cedric) or twice (Dobby). For the others you need a buildup and
&gt; &gt; investment in tension to make an impact. Here most people we would
&gt; &gt; care about mostly died off-screen.

&gt; Okay.  I'm going to side (more or less) with you on this one.  The
&gt; unmourned death toll in this book was WAY out of line.  I understand
&gt; that the scope of the evil was such that there were going to be some
&gt; losses, but one of the great virtues of literature is that loss can be
&gt; dealt with honestly, with seriousness, and with depth of emotion.  The
&gt; way that the narrative develops Rowling clearly felt that it was more
&gt; important to give value for money with an appropriately scaled battle
&gt; sequence, and that meant dispatching with the really affecting deaths,
&gt; like Dobby's, early and taking the breaks off for much of the rest of
&gt; the book.  I found the experience a little numbing, actually, and felt
&gt; that it could have been handled better.  In my eyes, the most
&gt; egregious death was Snape's a death that should be appropriately
&gt; mourned and honored, but we don't find out why until the chapter after
&gt; he dies.  If the sequence could have been reversed, his death could
&gt; have had a comparable impact to Sirius's.
">

JKR's position about the abrupt demise of Sirius was that that is how
real death is - sudden, anticlimatic, undramatic, unexpected and often
an utter waste. She made that point with Cedric's demise and then with
Sirius. DD's in contrast was well handled 'heroic' and err
'photogenic' death. I think she tried to make George's death a tear
jerker but failed.

Rest of it was back to her sudden-death formula - but if we want real
unleavened dose of the real world we wouldn't be reading a fantasy
book about elfs and goblins would we? Snape's death seem to be the
most silly.

&gt; &gt; 5. A desperate voldemort who is racing against time to save his
&gt; &gt; remaining horcruxes declares a ultimatum and gives harry an extra hour
&gt; &gt; to run around finding/destroying horcruxes?! Is LV a congenital idiot?

&gt; Nope.  He just very calculating.  It would have been interesting to
&gt; develop this theme a bit more, but, in this book, you get the sense
&gt; that his power lies more in the &quot;impression of power&quot; itself, than in
&gt; its sheer malevolent application.
">

Right. LV kills a bunch of his DEs who happened to be standing by when
he gets bad news from Gringotts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When it comes to the unbridled use
&gt; of power, he has people to do that for him.  He's the scheming
&gt; mastermind to whom they look.  The &quot;hour ultimatum&quot; is a particularly
&gt; dark narrative turn when looked at through this lens.  It would have
&gt; been especially effective if you had seen more characters doing a
&gt; Pansy and threatening to turn Harry over at this point.

&gt; &gt; 6. The way each of Ron, Hermione and Neville get a horcrux each to
&gt; &gt; destroy seemed forced rather than natural. Specially the Hermione one.

&gt; Lame, yes, but it gives each of them a hand in the killing.  Spreads
&gt; the blame.  Leaves nobody alone, character stained by murder, even if
&gt; the victim is Voldemort.

&gt; &gt; 7. Lupin was really loony in this book. What the hell happened to the
&gt; &gt; reserved, flawed and wise Lupin from Book 3? A great character was
&gt; &gt; turned into a melodramatic idiot.

&gt; A freer reign was given to his insecurity, just as a freer reign was
&gt; given to Tonks' in book 6.  It didn't make him sympathetic, but it did
&gt; make his thought process interesting in human terms.  In the end, I
&gt; thought it worked, but killing them off was probably a little harsh,
&gt; though it created an interesting symmetry of orphans in the
&gt; denouement.

&gt; &gt; 8. It was so trivial to infiltrate Gringotts. All you need was to
&gt; &gt; confound and imperious a few people. Gringott security hype no longer
&gt; &gt; lived up to the reality. Griphook seemed to make no real contribution
&gt; &gt; to the breaking so don't know why he was needed (other than to give a
&gt; &gt; token representation to Goblins).

&gt; Griphook was overstating his knowledge to get his hands on the sword.
&gt; Bill's speech about Goblins alluded to this, but could have been more
&gt; explicit.  Its very likely Griphook was a calculating bastard, who
&gt; intended to sell them out in the end anyway.  The fact that the Dragon
&gt; provided a means of escape was probably overly convenient, but not a
&gt; disproportionate stretch.

&gt; &gt; 9. The way people (McGonagall) were throwing around forbidden curses
&gt; &gt; was surprising. They made such a big deal out of it. It seemed out of
&gt; &gt; character that McGonagal would not have moral objections to their use
&gt; &gt; (if not legal ones).

&gt; Forbidden curses were overused in general.  Either they're forbidden,
&gt; or their not.  In this book they're treated like the American notion
&gt; of handgun ownership; ie. here is a tool that is only good for killing
&gt; people at close range who are themselves unarmed... buy as many as you
&gt; like... it is forbidden to kill people at close range who are
&gt; unarmed...  buy as many as you like.  If you can kill with two words,
&gt; and you are at war... you will.  This is a flaw in Rowlings'
&gt; conception of the use of magic that runs through all of the books.  If
&gt; you don't place limits on the efficacy of magic, everybody uses it all
&gt; the time for everything, and taken to its logical conclusion, all of
&gt; the peaks and valleys in the narrative are smoothed out by magic's
&gt; use.

&gt; &gt; 10. No explanation was gives as to why hogwarts sided with OOTP in the
&gt; &gt; battle of hogwarts rather than the DE who were actually running the
&gt; &gt; school. Hogwarts can make moral judgments?

&gt; Hogwarts faculty?  Students?  The building itself?  I think that this
&gt; is all pretty self explanatory.  The faculty not only supports the
&gt; order, many are members.  The students are largely scared and have
&gt; inflated notions or right and wrong (as students often do), and this
&gt; is a more noble cause to rally behind.  And the loyalty of the
&gt; building, creatures, ghosts, et al, is to Dumbledore, who figuratively
&gt; and literally speaks their language, and loves them beyond all
&gt; measure.
">

I suppose it kind of makes sense (in light of the unfortunate series
of events under Umbridges stewardship). I found the other explanation
given elsewhere in the thread more appealing. Snape was master of
hogwarts. Hogwarts bends to his will.

It all sounds almost cheezie.

In some of the rumores I have head Harry dies and then somehow gets to
come back to life?

Isn't this going against what we've been told from the books and
Rowling herself???

Obviously I have been a Snape fan and feel completely disappointed if
he dies. How come the little bit of snarky scarcastic gits who Save
everyones dumb rear in the end always have to die.

What does that teach anyone? Oh, you're a git but you are generally
deep down good...but too bad...even if you do whats right and try to
save the world you die anyway?? And all the little emotional brats get
to have a happy life because they appear to be wonderful little
children...WTH...ack...okay so I'm a little bitter if my other
favorite character dies. Dumbledore and Snape were my two favorites
and I am just really disappointed if these spoilers are true.

I don't mind if he loved Lily but it's really crappy if he has to die,
especially if he were following DD orders and at all trying to do the
right thing.

Does this teach us that us oddball people in the end if we try to do
the right thing we die for it?? Sucks!!

Harry:

... doesn't die at all. Unconscious, Harry dreamed meeting Dumbledore in
an after-world and he explained everything. Harry was unable to chose
whether to stay or go back and finish fighting Voldemort. When Harry
asks if the meeting is just in his head, Dumbledore replies, &quot;Of course
it is happening in your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean
it is not real?&quot;

To stop the killing of his friends, Harry went to Voldemort to allow the
Dark Lord to kill him, to end the battle. His willingness to die without
a fight was a magical sacrifice that protected his friends. Voldemort is
unable to kill Harry because of the blood he took (GoF - remember the
twinkle in Dumbledore's eye?) Lily's blood kept Harry's protection
alive, even though it ended at Privet Drive. What Voldemort really did,
was inadvertently destroy a previously unknown horcrux - inside Harry.

&gt;&gt; Obviously I have been a Snape fan and feel completely disappointed if
&gt;&gt; he dies. How come the little bit of snarky scarcastic gits who Save
&gt;&gt; everyones dumb rear in the end always have to die.

&gt;&gt; What does that teach anyone? Oh, you're a git but you are generally
&gt;&gt; deep down good...but too bad...even if you do whats right and try to
&gt;&gt; save the world you die anyway?? And all the little emotional brats get
&gt;&gt; to have a happy life because they appear to be wonderful little
&gt;&gt; children...WTH...ack...okay so I'm a little bitter if my other
&gt;&gt; favorite character dies. Dumbledore and Snape were my two favorites
&gt;&gt; and I am just really disappointed if these spoilers are true.

&gt;&gt; I don't mind if he loved Lily but it's really crappy if he has to die,
&gt;&gt; especially if he were following DD orders and at all trying to do the
&gt;&gt; right thing.

&gt;&gt; Does this teach us that us oddball people in the end if we try to do
&gt;&gt; the right thing we die for it?? Sucks!!

&gt; an after-world and he explained everything. Harry was unable to chose
&gt; whether to stay or go back and finish fighting Voldemort. When Harry
&gt; asks if the meeting is just in his head, Dumbledore replies, &quot;Of course
&gt; it is happening in your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean
&gt; it is not real?&quot;

&gt; To stop the killing of his friends, Harry went to Voldemort to allow the
&gt; Dark Lord to kill him, to end the battle. His willingness to die without
&gt; a fight was a magical sacrifice that protected his friends. Voldemort is
&gt; unable to kill Harry because of the blood he took (GoF - remember the
&gt; twinkle in Dumbledore's eye?) Lily's blood kept Harry's protection
&gt; alive, even though it ended at Privet Drive. What Voldemort really did,
&gt; was inadvertently destroy a previously unknown horcrux - inside Harry.

Typo - Harry was *able* to chose. Sorry.

Harry didn't really die, he was unconscious.  It is my understanding
the wand Voldy had wouldn't work against Harry for the same reason the
wand Voldy borrowed in the begriming of book 7 blew up.  By trying to
kill Harry, Voldy was trying to harm himself and the wand won't work
that way.  Voldy still has Harry's blood from the resurrection at the
end of book 4 and that is the connection between those 2.

Throw away plots?

&gt;once (Cedric) or twice (Dobby). For the others you need a buildup and

Deaths seemed a bit rushed too.  Nothing bought me emotionally like
the last 2 books with Dumbledore and Sirius.

He's an egomaniac.  He had the delusion one horcrux would be
unreachable since it had been lost for centuries.

Yeah.

Yeah.

They did need something to keep the dragons away but it seemed too
easy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;9. The way people (McGonagall) were throwing around forbidden curses
&gt;was surprising. They made such a big deal out of it. It seemed out of
&gt;character that McGonagal would not have moral objections to their use

Self defense use is probably ok with her as the school was under
attack and she wanted to help bring about an end to Voldy's reign of
terror.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;10. No explanation was gives as to why hogwarts sided with OOTP in the
&gt;battle of hogwarts rather than the DE who were actually running the

Kind of hard to make judgement when you got Voldy breathing down your
neck and your loved ones in Azkaban or missing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;12. Why didn't voldemort make a run for it when he was cornered and
&gt;all his horcruxes had been destroyed. He never seemed to have problem

&gt;a third time after it had backfired twice already.

He didn't believe the wand could fail again, and didn't believe the
last horcrux had been destroyed.

number 3: not one bit about Winky, and virtually nothing about
Kreacher after the trio left the Grimwauld place for good.  Nothing
about Ford Angelia, would have been comical if the car tried to run
over the DE camped in the forest.

One thing I did notice: DADA teacher didn't last the full school year
in book 7.  So it may still be cursed.

How could one of Voldemort's Horcruxes be &quot;lost for centuries&quot;

for a story thats a bit different from the norm but I guess this story
simply follows the standard children's book theme so I suppose that
means I shouldn't be surprised.

I don't want the story to end up worse than some fanfics I've
read...heck, even written. (shrugs) I read some of the comments in
this thread about McGonagall throwing unforgiveable etc and I suppose
I should wait for the book...also with the Lupin acting out of
character....it sounds very disappointing so my comments are made in
reflection on what people are saying....as lots of people are doing.

If Snape does die in a completely lame way, it does say that the
oddball died in the end..(shrugs) I've heard JKR comment on this being
a childrens series and so whatelse am I to expect from it than it
should teach us lessons.

Not to mention the enormous enjoyment I'm going to get at the book

No, the killing curse knocked him unconscious, as it did Voldemort. He

Err, entertain perhaps. Why would you assume that children's
books should always teach them lessons. Books, (at least
fiction), should first and foremost entertain. If they manage
to &quot;teach lessons&quot;, that's just a pleasant bonus, (though it
might not be, depending on exactly what &quot;lessons&quot; it teaches,
and how much you, as a reader, agrees with the author on
these &quot;lessons&quot;).

Life, OTOH, _should_ teach lessons.
