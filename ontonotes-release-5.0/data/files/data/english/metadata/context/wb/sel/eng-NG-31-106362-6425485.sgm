Hi Everyone,

My DD just turned 9months old.  She only drinks her milk after falling
asleep using her bottle so i want to get her trained onto the cup.  I
have tired regular glass, no valvue sippy cup and the ones with the
valve (but i take the valve off).  She drinks a bit but not much more
than say 50ml.  How can i get her to drink more from the cup?

Have you tried a straw?  It takes a while, but many
babies can manage that (and then you can use the sippy cups
with a straw).  Help her learn by putting your finger over the
end of the straw and dribbling some in her mouth.  Start with
a full cup so she doesn't have to get the liquid up so far
before she can taste it.  It usually takes a while to figure
out how to use the straw, but once they figure it out, they're
off and running.

Best wishes,
Ericka

Put something really tasty in it, like watered down apple jiuce or vanilla
soy milk - well, tasty compared to plain milk, anyway.

HI

Just posted my reply to the wrong place, I'm new to this!!!!! Just
wanted you to know my little boy used the none leaking cups, which he
took to very well as they still like to suck at 9 months rather than
sip! I found with straws they instinctively tip up the cup, which can
mean many changes of clothes!!! Good luck! x x x

She will drink more as she becomes more used to it.  It is quite a different
skill from using a bottle, I understand, and she hasn't been doing it very
long.  Leave the sippy cup where she can reach it herself and you will see a
difference.

Depends on the child. #2 took to straws at about 9 months, and the only
problems we had were if she was drinking from a carton and squeezed the
carton. She certainly found straws better than sippy cups.
#1 couldn't get the idea of the non-leaking cups until she was much older.
However some children can't get the straw idea, my mil taught 5yos and she
said there was usually one in a class who still hadn't got the idea of
staws, and either would tip it or just couldn't get anything up the straw.
They usually could use a straw by the end of the year.

I have always understood that going to sleep with a bottle is a bad
idea.  How much milk does she get from the bottle at night?  How much
does she need?

It is perfectly possible to train a child to use a regular glass
(plastic glass) or cup without a sippy cup, as we did not even have
such a thing possible.  Sippy cups are a new device.

I'm not sure about #1, but #2 could drink from a straw when she was
fairly young - maybe 8 months or maybe 12 months - I don't remember
exactly (she's now 43).  The reason that she learned was that we went
to a drive-in restaurant and I had a milkshake and she wanted some. It
wasn't something I was trying to train her to do.

That brings back memories of my eldest squeezing cartons, it is fun to
watch them learn and tackle problems! Is probable a very good idea
just to leave the cup around, they soon have a go when their thirsty! x

to me that sounds a great amount to be drinking from a sippy cup at this
age, I'd just keep offering, she'll drink more when she's ready.

I think that is a very bad idea, ok, maybe the vanilla soy milk isn't going
to be too sugary or anything, but apple juice is one of the worst things for
teeth and has very little useful stuff in it, some other fruit juices are
better choices if you must do juice, but in reality kids will drink enough
plain water to meet there needs if you make it available to them.

Okay, plain water then. Anything but cow milk, which is also full of sugars
and evil for teeth.

It's also full of nutrients.  Nothing wrong with it, I say.  Okay, some
people react to it and you don't like the sugars, but I say "anything but
cow milk" is exteme, at least for a toddler anyway.  Some people hold off on
cow's milk until 1yo because of allergy concerns, though.

I don't think the recommendation was to do so
exclusively or long term, but just to encourage them to
be persistent when learning how to drink from a straw or
sippy cup.  Once they've figured it out, you can put whatever
you like in the cup.
