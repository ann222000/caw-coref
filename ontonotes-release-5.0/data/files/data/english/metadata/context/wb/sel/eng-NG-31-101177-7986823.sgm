*********************** ARTICLE START ***********************
When using essential oils on babies and children, it is always a good to dilute one to two drops of pure essential oils with ½ to 1 teaspoon of oil. The oils that can be used are jojoba, sweet almond oil or sunflower oil. These are just a few ideas for oils to use to mix with the pure essential oils. The oils can be used in the bath tub. Stir the water before bathing.

Most important is to keep the oils out of the children’s reach. If an oil is ever ingested, give the child an oil-soluble liquid such as milk, cream or half and half. A few drops of pure essential oil shouldn’t be life threatening, but it is wise to take precautions.

There are twenty oils that are safe for children. Keep an eye out for my next article for more great uses for essential oils. Always use a pure essential oil. Never use synthetic oil as you can run into allergic reactions.

Colic: combine 2 tablespoons of Almond oil with one drop Chamomile (Roman), one drop of Lavender, &amp; one drop of Geranium. Mix together &amp; apply on the stomach &amp; back. Keep the stomach warm with a warm water bottle while burping the baby. This will often bring relief.

Common cold: Combine two tablespoons almond oil with two drops Melaleuca oil (tea Tree), one Lemon, one Rose Otto. Massage a small amount on the neck &amp; chest.

Cradle Cap: Combine 2 tablespoons almond oil &amp; one drop Lemon &amp; one drop Geranium. You can also mix one drop Cedarwood &amp; one drop of Sandalwood oil. Mix &amp; apply small amount on the head.

Crying: Use for massage or diffuse: Lavender, Chamomile (Roman), Ylang Ylang, Cypress or Rose Otto.

Diaper Rash: Dilute Lavender &amp; apply.

Digestion: (Sluggish) Use Lemon or Orange oil. Dilute &amp; massage on the feet &amp; stomach.
