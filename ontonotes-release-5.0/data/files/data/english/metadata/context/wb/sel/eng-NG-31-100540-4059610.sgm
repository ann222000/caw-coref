1996 Sunfire with 2.2.

Thermostat is acting as if it does not close, or close completely. Engine
warm up fine if idling, or running in slow traffic. Speed up to 80 KPH and
the engine temp drops to half way between cold and normal. Speed up to 100
KPH and it drops right to the cold mark. Slow down again and it will come
back up to normal.

Never runs hot. - It works great in regulating during hot running
conditions.

I have replaced the T'stat and seal twice - same deal, assuming I have
gotten a bad T'stat. I have heard that the rubber gasket/seal that goes
around the t'stat can leak internally, allowing coolant to flow by the
t'stat causing this type of symptom.

Has anyone heard of this - or experienced this?

Is there a solution better than keep on trying? I have used non OEM T'stats
and seals. Might this be part of the problem? Might the OEM seal be a better
choice in this particular instance?

TIA
Mike

Mike-

I'm having the same issue.  My t-stat was going bad so I replaced it with
a non-OEM (Mopar?)part and now it seems to run too cool.  It runs halfway
in the normal zone if under 50mph, but get up to 70mph and it goes below
the normal zone.  Have you heard anything more on this issue? Thank god
for a mild winter here because the heater doesn't work worth a darn when
that happens.

I went out and bought an OEM thermostat and rubber gasket from the Dealer.
The gasket is different in that it actually captures the thermostat within a
slot in the center of the gasket. The non-OEM just had a cut-out for the
thermostat to sit in. It also was slightly thinner in profile. I also used
some RTV high temp gasket maker goo on the faces of the housing.

Problem is now solved. Engine runs at normal temps and heater is good and
hot again. It seams that the problem was definitely that the gasket did not
seal completely, and so even when the thermostat was fully closed, much of
the coolant was actually getting around the thermostat and passing through
the rad.
