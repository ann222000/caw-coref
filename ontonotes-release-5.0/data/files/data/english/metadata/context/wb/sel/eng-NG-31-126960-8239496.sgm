It is just two weeks from choosing the champion for SYTYCD this season,
and tonight there are just 8 dancers left. They again had to draw a
partner and two dance routines out of hat for their performances.

Adam Shankman, who produced (and  probably directed also?) the movie
HAIRSPRAY, is sitting with Mary and Nigel at the judge's table. I really
like him as a judge!

Danny &amp; Sara were paired up and started the show with a Argentine Tango.
I thought it was great...had fantastic moves! Sara was far and above her
normal realm in dancing, I thought, and her &quot;pretzel twist&quot; was
wonderful!

Dominic &amp; Lauren followed with a Krump routine, and this dance is hard
for me to critique, as seems so similar to Hip Hop, which I do NOT care
for, but I think they did a &quot;good job&quot;, if the judges had it right! I'd
read on a spoiler in the NG, that Lauren messed up, and she  admitted
she DID fall off Dominic's  back, but...she covered it well to my
untrained eye.

Neil &amp; Lacey were in 3rd place  with their Latin Jazz routine, and Neil
danced with no shirt!  Lacey is a very good dancer, there is no doubt
about that, but in this, I felt he was better than her. The judges were
harsh with them, about the lack of chemistry, and her not focusing
enough attention on Neil, as this was suppose to be a sizzling number,
and was hard for the audience to FEEL it.

Pasha &amp; Sabra were last in the first set, dancing a Broadway number. I
found myself watching her the most, but that could have been the
glittery-gold outfit, where he was in dark clothing, and not as
noticeable?  It wasn't as good as I expected it to be, but perhaps the
choreography had much to do with that?

Danny &amp; Sara did a cute and fun Hip Hop routine for their 2nd dance of
the evening. Shane admitted he didn't care much for Danny from the
beginning, but after working with him for this performance, he admitted
he was wrong about him. I enjoyed it more than the judges did, I think,
but yes, their outfits were WILD!

Dominic &amp; Lauren danced a Rumba which showed LOTS of chemistry, so if
the judges wanted chemistry, they got it with those two! It had
beautiful moves, and was done gracefully, and Dom listened last week,
and had GOOD facial expressions in this dance. There wasn't a lot of hip
action, but there again, much of that was the choreographers fault, and
the music was lame. She looked lovely indeed, and so did he, and how
about those HIGH heels he wore for that dance?! :-)

Neil &amp; Lacey did a Contemporary performance, choreographed by Mia, and
told a personal story about losing her dad. This was much better than
their first dance, and so emotional that Mary couldn't even speak
afterwards! They danced as if they were alone on that stage, oblivious
to anyone..talk about bringing emotion to the audience, so others can
FEEL the dance! This time Neil's FEET were bare! :o)

Pasha &amp; Sabra closed the show with  a cute Quick Step, which made them
the favorite couple of the night, as far as Nigel was concerned.

Neil &amp; Lacey's Contemporary performance was the BEST of all tonight, as
far as I'm concerned, but I thought ALL the second dances were better
than the 1st for all four couples.

Who will leave tomorrow night? It will again be 1 guy and 1 gal, and I
think it could be Dominic, in spite of his growth each week,
and.......possibly Sara. I am voting again for him, as I've done each
week, as I'm proud of his accomplishments in such a short time! No
matter who leaves, it will be a tear jerker, at this point, and I'm
already feeling sad!  :-(

Yep, he directed it, as well.  We had to pause so that DH could begin his

Yes, I thought it was very good, as well.  But, I agreed with Adam -- not
exactly a butch move at the end!  Nonetheless, we enjoyed this one.  Went
back and watched it twice.  Both Danny and Sara did a wonderful job.

I could tell, yes, but I thought she covered it well.  I like a lot of
hip-hop, (especially Shane Spark's -- usually-- and Dan Karrity) but this
was not good for me.  Lauren should have hit it harder, and the sad thing
is... she can, she just didn't.  I'm not sure I'm big on Lil C's work.

As I said in another post, an update of the bridge collapse in MN pre-empted
this entire routine.  I will have to wait until it is uploaded to YouTube to
comment.

I wasn't thrilled, but DH (who loves happy Broadway musical dances) and DD
(who typically does *not* like happy Broadway musical dances) both were
happy with it.  I just didn't feel that the choreography really showed off
their talents.

Like I said earlier, I usually love Shane's work.  Tonight, not so much.  I
thought it was really bad.  Also, it seemed to me that Danny messed up a
number of times.  The move where the arm went under the body, he never did
do correctly.  And, he did the opposite of what Lauren did when he had a
mishap (the hat coming off) -- he leaned down and made it obvious he was
casting it aside, rather than finding a way to unobtrusively move it.  My
least favorite routine of the night.

I got teary.  This is the first song this season that we didn't pause after
to discuss.  DH and I looked at each other, smiled sadly.  We just knew.
Later, we both talked about how beautiful it was.  They told that story,
and, I think, *believed* it, especially Neil.  I definitely got the feeling
he connected with it.  Beautiful.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That was really tough, too.  So often, with the quick step, the dancers move
away from one another, and they didn't.  Not typically a dance I like, but
they made it look great.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Neil &amp; Lacey's Contemporary performance was the BEST of all tonight, as
&gt; far as I'm concerned, but I thought ALL the second dances were better

The three we watched a second time were Danny's and Sara's tango, Dom and
Lauren's rumba (did I mention that was HOT???) and Neil and Lacey's last.
All three were good in their own way.... but, yeah... I'd probably say Mia's
was my favorite.   (My husband liked Sabra and Pascha's quick step, though,
and watched it a couple of times).

I think Dom will leave tomorrow, and either Lauren or Sara.  I think Lacey
has a very large fan base, which I think developed pretty early on with all
the &quot;Benji's sister&quot; clips.  While Sabra got a much slower start, I think
people have grown to see her as an excellent dancer.

Don't feel sad, though, Judy.  At this point, these guys have worked with
people they would have killed to have an opportunity to work with before.
They may not win, but they will get work.  I'd be surprised if Mia doesn't
already have Ricky on the payroll, for instance.

I'm drawing a blank here:  has Sara ever danced with Danny before?  I
thought it was a very odd combination.  In vocal terms, imagine Blake
and Opera girl (singing in her legit voice) trying to sing a duet.  I,
not surprisingly, liked Danny.  Sara was good, but I felt she was
overshadowed by Danny.  Not the best partnering for either of them.

As I said in another post, Lacey was very presentational, which is
common with Broadway musicals, but she's primarily a ballroom dancer,
isn't she?  When I have watched ballroom on television, the women do
play to the audience quite a lot, but I think the judges were correct
in nailing her for the failure to connect.  Neil was......oh my, but
he is good looking.

They did a very good job, and the tempo alone on that song will cause
many dancers to be unable to keep up the energy.  No problem with
Sabra and I felt Pasha did just fine.

I really didn't like this.  Danny tried to be jerky like the style
requires, with lots of fast movements, but his face (thank you very
much!!!!) didn't do the whole extreme thing I unfortunately see in so
many hip hop dancers.  Sara *should* have been better.  I just don't
think they were dancing the same song.

Very good, but Dominic was *still* too stereotypical in his face with
the &quot;I look *mahhvellllussss*&quot; mugging.  Sorry, he just bugs me.
Lauren was lovely to look at but still too sugary and, well, I'll wait
for CatNipped or one of the other dancers around here to tell me why
that wasn't a rumba, according to the judges.  I don't know a rumba
from a hole in the wall.

October 3, 2005, I lost my dad.  He was my muse, one of the finest
musicians I've ever known, and I miss him terribly to this very day.
When I watched that number, it took about ten seconds and tears were
flowing down my face.  I remembered a moment in our relationship was
that very, very close to the action on the stage.  My crying surprised
me.   I *never* react like that.  Everything they did rang true.  Mia
Michaels outdid herself and I felt she was very brave to put this out
there.  I don't think I would have felt comfortable being so exposed.
I'm a very private person, which is one reason why I never seriously
pursued being a professional singing actor.  This piece was
magnificently performed.  No mugging and absolute connection between
Lacey and Neil.  This was the highlight of the season and, perhaps,
even the run of this show for me.  I'm okay if either of these two
win.  Sorry Danny.  He is beautiful to watch, but I don't think he
could have pulled this off.  I still adore that guy, though.

dances together.

Wonderful review, Judy.  Yes, I agree.  I think it will be Dominic,
but with an outside chance of Lauren.  You may be right about Sara,
though, because she *should* have done better in the hip hop.  Does
anyone know the name of the song that Michaels used?  I have to
download that and listen to it....much later.....not today.

Well then, it will have to be done in heaven because I believe Divine
died. :)  Someone asked me if Divine could sing and I said, gee, I

Yes, but didn't his face stuff bug you?  I think it was after this
number that Nigel said that he expected the choreographers to kick it
up next week and not just have them do a series of poses, which adapts
the choreography to what the dancers can do comfortably instead of
forcing the dancer to stretch.  Really good point and I sure hope the
choreographers were listening.  In other words, don't dummy it down.

Most definitely agree there.  I think the &quot;Hummingbird&quot; routine by
Wade Robson was 10 times more difficult than any of the choreography
tonight and the two dancers from it (Hok and Jaime) have both been
voted off!  At this point in the competition I'm waiting to be blown
away by the choreography and, to be honest, it's just dull!

I thought the &quot;chemistry&quot; complaint was valid, but also a tad
off-target, in a competition you want to play to the audience.

This &quot;Latin Jazz&quot; is another non-existent category, so how do you

well-enough, and if Sara didn't look great doing it, then c, c, and c
all sucked, and also the song by 25 pence.

&gt;Very good, but Dominic was *still* too stereotypical in his face with

&gt;Lauren was lovely to look at but still too sugary and, well, I'll wait

&gt;that wasn't a rumba, according to the judges.  I don't know a rumba

I don't know a rumba, but this wasn't even a dance.

&gt;October 3, 2005, I lost my dad.  He was my muse, one of the finest

Well then, I'll refrain.  Mia Michaels is supposed to be brilliant,
I've liked most of her choreography, but I really wondered about this,
and the reactions of all three judges - frankly, I thought the
reaction even mystified the dancers a bit.

&gt;the second dance alone than any other couple tonight on both their

I liked Danny and Sara on the tango!

I thought none of the routines really rang the bell, but probably
Sabra was the best individual performer, then maybe Danny and Neil.  I
like Sara, but she isn't a bubbly personality and ... well, it'll be
up to the voters.

This was the best dance of the night for me - awesome.  Sara, though
nowhere near Danny's level of expertise, never-the-less really stepped
up her game and delivered a good, solid performance.  The judges made
a comment about Danny's extraordinary &quot;center&quot; - hmmmm, now where have
I heard that comment lately (oh, was it from someone who just took a
few lessons when she was 2??  ;&gt;)  I think Danny may have even bested
you-know-who's number of continuous pirouettes!  And, as Mary
mentioned, the ability to come out of that many pirouettes exactly on
your mark is awesome (try standing in one spot and spinning around

I really didn't like this routine.  Both Danny and Sara performed it
badly (don't go into shock, now ;&gt;).  It had no energy, both dancers

Really, really bad for me.  This looked more like a distant cousin to
a Tango than a Rumba.  Dominic was mugging it up again despite what

both lacked the &quot;hip action&quot; necessary for a good Rumba.

First let me say, it was very brave of these dancers to dance on a
stage filled with hundreds of silk flowers that could cause a bad slip
or fall - definitely bad decision on the part of Mia.  Second, this
dance was &quot;salted&quot; even before it began.  I thought it was bad form
for Mia to play the sympathy card making it impossible to judge this
dance fairly.  I can understand people getting teary-eyed thinking
aobut their lost loved ones (I lost my father when I was four), but
the choreography itself was uninspired and dull.  Neil and Lacey did a
good job with what they were given, but they just weren't given
enough.  I usually like Mia's routines (especially the park bench
number last year), but this was her &quot;skating&quot; on her reputation.
Really bad form IMHO.

I haven't seen the remake, though I'm sure I will eventually, but I
agree that the original was so good that no remake is necessary.

A few years ago, when Julia Roberts was interviewed for the remake of
&quot;Ocean's Eleven,&quot; she said that it was a good movie to remake, because
the original was just so-so, leaving room to improve on it.  She said
that she never understands remaking a movie that's already great,
because what can you do with it?

That happened with the remake of &quot;Psycho.&quot;  I mean, when every one of
Hitchcock's shots are already the best way to shoot that scene, why
even bother?  Your choices are to change the movie or recreate it,
neither of which are going to be successful.

Where was the tango?  This is supposed to be a passionate couple's
dance, but two thirds of it had Danny twirling around on one foot while
Sara was prancing halfway across the stage from him.  Sure, he's got a
wonderful center of balance, but this shouldn't have been a display of
his solo abilities.  When they did dance in the regular dance hold

Ok...this is where I get nasty and upset all the Danny fans!  He was
completely out of his element here.  To give him some credit, he's
gotten a little funkier since the show started and actually smiled and
connected with the audience, but his classical training just interferes
with his ability to hang loose.  Every time he got to a spot where he
wasn't sure what to do, he stiffened back up into that balletic posture
and started pointing his toes which is completely the opposite of what
he should have been doing in a hip hop routine.  Sara should have been
in here element here, but she just didn't nail it like you'd expect her
to.  I found this number a huge disappointment.

Except for her losing her center of balance while she was twirling

I'm going to go with Dom and Lauren.

I've called it for the last two weeks, so I'm trying for a third.

Next week is going to be tough for the guys, because because Danny,

final four will be Danny, Neil, Lacey and Sabra.

I  saw &quot;Hairspray&quot; this past weekend, and did enjoy it, especially John
Travolta and the heavy set gal (name?) that had a main singing role. My
daughter saw the original, and said it was better, and she insists I saw
it too, but I remember my &quot;favorite&quot; movies, even from when I was a kid,
and have no recollection of seeing it?!

The bridge accident was terrible! Do you live in Mn.? I hadn't heard
anyone else here say it interrupted the show. Glad you got Neil &amp;
Lacey's 1st performance later on Youtube.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;That was hot, hot, hot. HOT. Very hot. :-)

I too thought  Dominic &amp; Lauren's Rumba was TOO hot for words (whew!)
and maybe it wasn't the &quot;proper Rumba&quot;, as far as the hip movements, but
they did what they were instructed to do by the choreographer, and it
was GREAT! Dominic's posture and stature (and also his arm extensions
and movements) were graceful and beautiful...and even their clothes were
HOT! ;-) He looked at her through the whole dance, as if she was the
most precious thing in the world, which was the finishing touch. I loved
it!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I got teary. This is the first song this
&gt; season that we didn't pause after to
&gt; discuss. DH and I looked at each other,
&gt; smiled sadly. We just knew. Later, we
&gt; both talked about how beautiful it was.
&gt; They told that story, and, I think,
&gt; *believed* it, especially Neil. I definitely
&gt; got the feeling he connected with it.
&gt; Beautiful.

Now that I've had a chance to sleep on the show, and give it more
thought, I really was more in awe of Hok &amp; Jaime's &quot;Hummingbird&quot;
performance...THAT really moved me, and even though I lost my dear dad 5
years ago, and still miss him, Neil &amp; Lacey's Contemporary number did
not move me to tears, which usually happens when I'm touched by
emotions, and I don't think it was as superb as I first thought.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I think Dom will leave tomorrow, and
&gt; either Lauren or Sara. I think Lacey has
&gt; a very large fan base, which I think
&gt; developed pretty early on with all the
&gt; &quot;Benji's sister&quot; clips. While Sabra got a
&gt; much slower start, I think people have
&gt; grown to see her as an excellent
&gt; dancer.

My hubby doesn't watch the show, but youngest daughter does with me, and
we discuss it in length. She likes Danny the best and votes for him. I
vote for Dominic for many reasons, but mainly for all he's accomplished
since this season has started, and for his dedication in striving to
improve.

I think out of the guys, only Neil is safe tonight, and any of the other
3 could be leaving, depending on their fan base. Of the gals, I think
Sabra and Lacey are safe, but we'll know in a few hours for sure?

Actually, John Waters has said that &quot;Hairspray&quot; was the first movie

Heheheh.  &quot;blue lighting&quot;.  I've found that, pretty much, when the stage
lighting is blue, I'm likely to like the routine!

&quot;Why&quot;  had blue lighting.

Last night's &quot;Ain't No Sunshine&quot; routine had blue lighting:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0C6ERaO0mU

There have been several others.

I'm somewhat joking.

But, I do think that the choreographers/set design people are most likely to
use blue lighting for routines that are romantic or bittersweet.  I think
they may also use it for contemporary routines, more than for other types.
I'm sure the relationship is not causal, but simply correlational.  I like
bittersweet or romantic contemporary routines, and those are also more
likely to have blue lighting.

&gt;First let me say, it was very brave of these dancers to dance on a

&gt;dance was &quot;salted&quot; even before it began.  I thought it was bad form
&gt;for Mia to play the sympathy card making it impossible to judge this
&gt;dance fairly.  I can understand people getting teary-eyed thinking
&gt;aobut their lost loved ones (I lost my father when I was four), but
&gt;the choreography itself was uninspired and dull.  Neil and Lacey did a
&gt;good job with what they were given, but they just weren't given
&gt;enough.  I usually like Mia's routines (especially the park bench
&gt;number last year), but this was her &quot;skating&quot; on her reputation.
&gt;Really bad form IMHO.

I felt much the same about this.  Mia isn't my favorite choreographer
usually, but this was more about emotion than dance.  (Mom died in
January so I was primed to cry).  It seems that Mary may be losing a
parent the way Nigel spoke about her personal moment.

The flowers were a risk for dancers and the dance was kinda cheesy.
If we didn't have the backstory, I wonder if we would have reacted
with the same enthusiasm.  Moni - in Illinois

OK, but I'd say that there was something about the remake that made it
successful, like the casting, perhaps.  In the case of &quot;Psycho&quot;, the
movie was identical, but the cast wasn't better than the original, not
even on par, so what was the point.

On the other hand, the remake of &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; was very good,
because they updated a couple of references that didn't work in a more
modern time and the cast was excellent. Maybe because it was a play,
it works as long as you keep casting it with the strongest of your
current crop of actors and don't mess with it too much.

The original &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot; is the same thing, remakes that
aren't quite as magical as the original, but each still adding an
element that made it worthwhile to produce.

Remaking the Anthony Newley-Sandra Dennis movie &quot;Sweet November&quot; was
unecessary, especially when the remake ruined the sad ending by
writing a feel-good ending. I haven't seen the original in decades,
but I can still picture Newley walking in the snow; I saw the remake a
few years ago, but can't remember the end other than it being
rewritten.  But Hollywood has to have the happy ending AND tell us
about it in the trailers. Sigh.

I was playing the tape for my husband, who wants to see Neil's
routines (we're from Buffalo like Neil and my husband was a gynmast in
high school).   After the contemporary routine, he looked at me and
said, &quot;Well, he's going home.&quot;  I told him the judges loved it and he
thought I was kidding.  I thought there was too much standing and
throwing flowers and not enough dancing, but what do I know?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The story aspect was moving but the dance itself didn't move me.  I

&gt;&gt;&gt; say, Ivan and Allison dancing &quot;Why&quot; last season did (which used to be

&gt;&gt; I checked after posting this and &quot;Why&quot; is back on YouTube.

&gt;&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmB-EdV-KeY

&gt;&gt; Obviously it's a whole different emotion than the other and I didn't
&gt;&gt; mean to compare on that basis.  Just meant to say that while the
&gt;&gt; choreography itself and the passion of the dancers in Mia's dance didn't
&gt;&gt; do a lot for me, &quot;Why&quot; wrenches it out of me. And while we're on the
&gt;&gt; subject of chemistry (not between Neil and Lacey in Mia's number, cuz
&gt;&gt; that's a whole different thing) but Yowser! I think this was the dance
&gt;&gt; where Ivan suddenly became the little hip hop kid who lives down the block.

&gt;&gt; t

&gt;OK, I hope it was obvious I meant &quot;where Ivan suddenly becomes *MORE*
&gt;than the little hip hop kid...&quot;
">

Oh yeah, I got what you meant.  He suddenly became a &quot;leading man.&quot; I
think the park bench routine did the same for Travis, another cute,
boyish guy.  He suddenly looked like he'd been around the block and
knew the meaning of painful love. I took both guys more seriously
after those routines.

I think Neil and Lacey's number would have worked better if it had not
been so literal.  Neil as Lacey's father was difficult to buy; it's
hard to pull off that specific type of chemistry, especially when they
were asked to play the part of the person who experienced the loss.

If the story had been translated as a couple who were reunited after
death, it might have been easier.  Putting Neil in a bow tie makes him
look like a kid playing dress up with those boyish features and I
doubt it helped him feel &quot;fatherly&quot; toward Lacey.  Having Lacey pile
flowers on his head gave him nothing to do but stand there.

The explanation of the story should have come after the performance.
That hurt Hok, too.  Let US decide what the dance means and how it
makes us feel.

When I saw the original movie, I didn't get character from Divine,

Neil and Lacey were probably *very* grateful there wasn't a lot of dancing
to that dance - with all the silk flowers on the stage there was a good

Four!  I hated it too.  And, actually, I probably wouldn't have hated it
quite so much (but still wouldn't have liked it) had Mia not given that sob
story about her father before they danced and cried crocodile tears during
the dance.  I thought that was *VERY* disingenuous of her to do that.  I
usually really like her choreography and think she's brilliant in her
jondra - but I think that this really backfired on her *and* neil.

&gt;&gt;First let me say, it was very brave of these dancers to dance on a
&gt;&gt;stage filled with hundreds of silk flowers that could cause a bad slip

&gt;&gt;dance was &quot;salted&quot; even before it began.  I thought it was bad form
&gt;&gt;for Mia to play the sympathy card making it impossible to judge this
&gt;&gt;dance fairly.  I can understand people getting teary-eyed thinking
&gt;&gt;aobut their lost loved ones (I lost my father when I was four), but
&gt;&gt;the choreography itself was uninspired and dull.  Neil and Lacey did a
&gt;&gt;good job with what they were given, but they just weren't given
&gt;&gt;enough.  I usually like Mia's routines (especially the park bench
&gt;&gt;number last year), but this was her &quot;skating&quot; on her reputation.
&gt;&gt;Really bad form IMHO.

&gt; I felt much the same about this.  Mia isn't my favorite choreographer
&gt; usually, but this was more about emotion than dance.  (Mom died in
&gt; January so I was primed to cry).  It seems that Mary may be losing a

I don't think so - there just wasn't that much there to like.  Like Dom and
Lauren, they were just basically walking around and posing.  The
choreographers *REALLY* need to step of their game and start challenging the
dancers.  Now that there is nobody left except those who actually *CAN*
dance, they really don't need to try to play to a dancer's strengths and
compensate for their weaknesses!

I'm sure there's a whole psychology of it outlined in the Theatrical

&gt; at it.  I don't think it was possible for him to sound any more
&gt; insincere.

A-yup!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Neil &amp; Lacey did a Contemporary performance

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I disliked it.   Right from the wave, where I gagged.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'm so glad to hear that other people hated this number.  I thought I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;was going to piss everyone off by calling it barf evoking.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Make that at least three of us.  This dance was the equivilent of
&gt;&gt;&gt;Robin Williams in &quot;Patch Adams&quot; mode.

&gt;&gt; I thought more along the lines of high school dance performance as
&gt;&gt; performed by Zelda Gilroy and Maynard G. Krebs.

&gt; Ohmygawd, I can't believe there's still someone besides me alive who still
&gt; remembers Dobie Gillis!!!  ;&gt;

Count me in as a Dobie Gillis fan, too. I also like the comparison of
Neil/Lauren to Zelda/Maynard performance.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Adam Shankman, who produced (and  probably directed also?) the movie
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; HAIRSPRAY, is sitting with Mary and Nigel at the judge's table. I really
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; like him as a judge!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Yep, he directed it, as well.  We had to pause so that DH could begin his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rant --- he believes to remake Hairspray without Divine is heresy.  :-)

&gt;&gt; &gt;Well then, it will have to be done in heaven because I believe Divine
&gt;&gt; &gt;died. :)  Someone asked me if Divine could sing and I said, gee, I
&gt;&gt; &gt;didn't know Feirstein could.  Croak, yes, sing...not so much. :)  I
&gt;&gt; &gt;actually liked Travolta.  He made the role less of a drag queen and
&gt;&gt; &gt;more of a character.  Perhaps not what Waters was looking for at the
&gt;&gt; &gt;time, but that is where Travolta took it.

&gt;&gt; Actually, John Waters has said that &quot;Hairspray&quot; was the first movie
&gt;&gt; where Divine didn't play a drag queen, but played a real character, a
&gt;&gt; loving mother who just happened to be a man.  And it's true, there was
&gt;&gt; really nothing drag queenish about his performance.

&gt;When I saw the original movie, I didn't get character from Divine,
&gt;although she was certainly very watchable.  Feirstein, on the other
&gt;hand, was flat out painful to watch and listen to.

When is Feirsten ever NOT painful to watch and listen to?
