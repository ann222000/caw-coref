I currently have this house under contract, and want to assign it.  If
interested, call my cell at 703-868-7896.  -Charles

_____________________________________________
Address: 106 Church St NE, Leesburg, VA 20176
Description:  Single Family house - 2 Bed, 1 Bath, 780sq.ft.,
2178sq.ft. lot,  built: 1970

This house is in the historic district of Leesburg and is in good
condition.  The kitchen is large (relative to the size of the house),
and has an island with a granite counter.  Other kitchen counters are
wood, with Bosch appliances. Hardwood floors run throughout the house,
and are in fair condition (but would look better if refinished).
Extra storage exists in cellar, backyard shed and attic.  Bathroom is
functional, but needs updating.  The backyard is long and secluded.
House needs cosmetics, plus add air-conditioning (can be retrofitted
to the existing gas forced air furnace - less than 2k).  Rope and
pulley need replacement in some windows.  Patch and paint stucco
exterior.

This is a great house for an attorney that wants to be 2 blocks from
the courthouse, or a young couple looking for a city house.

Repair estimate:  $7K
Your Price:  $215K (firm)

A $1000 deposit with my contract is required to take it off the
market. Call me at 703-868-7896  as soon as possible if you are
interested.

Title work is being done by Albanese &amp; Associates, Fairfax, VA.  The
settlement fee shall be split evenly between buyer &amp; seller.  Buyer
pays courier fee, title search fee, title binder fee, title insurance,
recording fees and tax.  The seller pays doc. prep/processing fee,
overnight fee, and release fee.
