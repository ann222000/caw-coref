Howdy all.

Been driving my new Jetta with the DSG, and I was wondering the
following:

With an automatic transmission, I vaguely understand the funciton of
the slushbox when the car is in gear but stopped at a light.  With a
manual, you step on the clutch to disengage the engine from the
drivetrain.

Ok, how does it work with the DSG?  Is it just a matter of programming
in the computer that disengages the clutch when the car comes to a
start?  Or is it something mechanical?

With an automatic, when you are at a red light and shift into neutral,
you see a blip in the tachometer as the load is taken off the engine.
I don't get that with the DSG if I am stopped and pop it in neutral the
tach does not move at all, although I do feel/hear it in the engine
(sounds like it goes from under load to no load).  This is all with the
DSG in automatic mode.

Thanks in advance for any and all answers.

The computer has to disengage the clutch at the traffic light so
shifting to neutral has no effect that I know of.  You have two
clutches inside the transmission and if either of them is engaged the
car is moving or the engine has stalled.

I think that neutral is likely the state that both clutches are
disengaged.  I do not know if there is any true neutral that actually
disengages the gears (like a manual transmission would).
