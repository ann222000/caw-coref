WASHINGTON (AP) -- A single pill appears to hold promise in curbing
the urges to both smoke and drink, according to researchers trying to
help people overcome addiction by targeting a pleasure center in the
brain.

A study published Monday suggests not just nicotine but alcohol also
acts on the same locations in the brain.

The drug, called varenicline, already is sold to help smokers kick
the habit. New but preliminary research suggests it could gain a
second use in helping heavy drinkers quit, too.

Much further down the line, the tablets might be considered as a
treatment for addictions to everything from gambling to painkillers,
researchers said.

Several experts not involved in the study cautioned that there is no
such thing as a magic cure-all for addiction and that varenicline and
similar drugs may find more immediate use in treating diseases
including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

Pfizer Inc. developed the drug specifically as a stop-smoking aid and
has sold it in the United States since August under the brand name
Chantix. Varenicline works by latching onto the same receptors in the
brain that nicotine binds to when inhaled in cigarette smoke, an
action that leads to the release of dopamine in the brain's pleasure
centers. Taking the drug blocks any inhaled nicotine from reinforcing
that effect.

A study published Monday suggests not just nicotine but alcohol also
acts on the same locations in the brain. That means a drug like
varenicline, which makes smoking less rewarding, could do the same for
drinking. Preliminary work, done in rats, suggests that is the case.

&quot;The biggest thrill is that this drug, which has already proved safe
for people trying to stop smoking, is now a potential drug to fight
alcohol dependence,&quot; said Selena Bartlett, a University of California,
San Francisco neuroscientist who led the study. Details appear this
week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Pfizer provided the drug for the study, but was not otherwise involved
in the research.

More often than not, smoking and drinking go together -- an
observation pub-goers have made for hundreds of years. That a single
drug could work to curb both addictions isn't a given -- nor is it
surprising, said Christopher de Fiebre, an associate professor of
pharmacology and neuroscience at the University of North Texas Health
Science Center at Fort Worth.

&quot;This is an extremely important paper and hopefully it will convince
the major funding agencies that they need to examine the interactions
between nicotine and alcohol to a greater extent than they have done
to date,&quot; said de Fiebre, who was not connected with the study.

In fact, the University of California researchers, together with the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, are now planning
the first studies in humans of the drug's effectiveness in curbing
alcohol cravings and dependence, Bartlett said. That the drug is
already Food and Drug Administration-approved should speed things
along.

&quot;This is a drug that people are actually using. That's not trivial --
not at all,&quot; said Mark Egli, co-leader of the medications development
program at the NIAAA, part of the National Institutes of Health.
&quot;There is plenty of animal research that looks pretty cool but there
is no way those drugs are ever going to be used by human beings.&quot;

In the new study, researchers trained rats to drink alcohol and
measured the effect of varenicline once the animals became the
laboratory equivalent of heavy drinkers. They found the drug curbed
their drinking. Even when stopped, the animals resumed drinking but
didn't binge.

Just as varenicline doesn't work for all smokers, it's highly unlikely
it would for all drinkers.

&quot;Is this going to be a cure-all? No, not for smoking or alcoholism
because both diseases are more complicated than a single target or
single genetic issue,&quot; said Allan Collins, a professor of pharmacology
at the University of Colorado who was not connected to the study.

Still, Collins, who's worked on the topic for decades, called the
drug's potential use in treating alcoholism a &quot;no-brainer.&quot; And Egli
said it supports the emerging view that there is a common biological
basis for addictions to both alcohol and tobacco.

As for Pfizer, the New York company has yet to decide whether to seek
broader FDA approval for the drug, a spokesman said.

&quot;Without having considerable more data on this it would be very
difficult for us to say we might pursue it or not. It's almost a wait-
and-see,&quot; said Pfizer's Stephen Lederer.

Ashley! Â THANK YOU for spotting and posting this most interesting
article about another possible use for Chantix. Â I'm trying to think
back to the time I was on the stuff to think how I felt about drinking
then, if it was any different than usual. Â I don't drink much at all
as I have cronic hepatitis B [well controlled by one of my meds] and
my liver is not all that healthy. Â Still, I'll have a beer now and
then when the time is right. Â I can't say that I drank less during
that time but I know I didn't drink any more. Â I will be interested to
see what further clinical results will show.

You guys are more than welcome. I just came across this at work and
found it interesting.
I'm not on Chantix, but last time I checked my father was (he hasn't
completely stopped but had cut down, which if you're my 3-packs-a-day-
for-40-years father is better than nothing). He is an alcoholic. I'm
interested to see how this affects him, if it does and if he'll tell
me, which is kind of doubtful as he refuses to admit any sort of
alcohol issue.

I don't drink much at all either, Mike, beyond a glass of wine or two.
My boyfriend is kind of a wine afficionado so I've done a bit more
drinking since I started dating him, although not of the go-out-get-
shitty-and-throw-up variety, thank God.

Anyhoo. Just thought you guys might be interested. I, too, want to see
what further studies show.

:)

As a heavy drinker on Chantix, I can say it has an effect, though
maybe not that good without a secession plan.

I noticed (on my own) that I had to drink more and more to get that
euphoric feeling. I reasoned that it was the Chantix so I stopped the
increase in my alcohol intake. I did this because I was drinking far
too much and it was having physical effects and was probably cooking
my liver.

It's kind of like the guy here who asked about giving his father
Chantix without his knowing about it. I suggested that his father
would simply smoke more trying to get the same effects as before. I
found my drinking was the same way. Until I realized that the Chantix
was cutting the reward response to drinking down, I simply drank more.

Like here with Chantix, I think the drug should be part of a
structured plan to stop drinking, else it may do more harm than good
if abusive drinking continues.

For the inquiring minds my normal drink is .5L of 80 proof Vodka in
3-4 hours in evening. Before I realized what Chantix was doing it was
.75L with still less of a drunk feeling.

That's interesting to read, Gary, that you figured out that Chantix
was affecting your alcohol intake. Â I do hope they study this further
so that we know better how to use it while getting smober as well as
another tool to gain sobriety. Â Chantix does seem to make the phrase
'better living through chemistry' ring true. &lt;G&gt;

That is very interesting, Gary. Perhaps I'll ask my father in a
diplomatic way (of course) if it's affected him similarly.
I agree with you, though. A plan is definitely needed, whether it's
smoking, drinking, whatnot. You can't just rely on the drug to do it
for you. Unfortunately, it's just not that easy when dealing with any
sort of habit or addiction....

I don't care to stop the drinking. I like it and will do it until I
die. You know the definition of being healthy is just another way of
describing the slowest possible speed in which to die. It's coming,
sooner or later and I'm in no race to win with the longest life.

Cheer up, sorry for preaching about drinking. I sure am in no position
to preach since I have not drunk half a liter of booze in my whole
life, probably even less.

I still wish you the best of health, for very selfish reasons. You're

No worries. I did chose some dry words to express myself. I actually
take a very light hearted approach to it. I figure, why make my life a
living hell by beating myself up over it. So, ask anyone who knows me
and they will all tell you that I drink and I'm a good person. I'm
satisfied with that.

PC's are electronics. Maybe the difference is that I tend to
troubleshoot to the component level while you probably troubleshoot to
the board level. Both still require a diagnostic mind. That puts our
thinking in a close likeness.

One other thought... Have you noticed, like I have, that people who
are very good at diagnostic and technical skills seem to have an
addictive personality? I don't know about you, but I've never met a
really good technician that didn't at least smoke, if not drink. On
the other hand, I don't see this with so-so or poor technicians.

Exactly, with PC's no one even bothers to do component level
soldering. SMD's (for lack of schematics) and large custom IC's, all
on a multi layered PCB are too much trouble considering the cost of a
new board. The most I am willing to do is to recap the motherboard.
Laptops are a minor exception, people yank the connectors of the board
and most of the time it can be solved for petty cash.

Actually, having a good electronic repair table setup was always a
little dream of mine: the oscilloscope, at least 2 very expensive
irons etc, the fancy meters that can measure impedance of a rat's
ass.... Ahhh....

Here, people mostly buy the nasty cheapest possible stuff so most
don't even bother trying to repair it, your trade (and mine too, too a
lesser extent) has seen better days.

I'm not sure. When I was running my little business, my first employee
and later my right hand was this guy, Robert. He never stood out with
the soldering iron skills, but he was a real workhorse with printers,
and some other stuff.
Software.
With software you have to think in a very similar way as with
hardware. Then there is the interdependence between software and
hardware, have to have a good nose as to what the cause is, in order
to save on time. For example you get the blue screen of death exactly
45 seconds upon booting into windows. Some people would spend a whole
work day running all the standard tests first (memory, disk, etc) then
swapping PSU's, and VGA's and optical drives and so on.
He had that certain ability to nail the problem quickly, especially
with printers, which I hated. I hated them cause, you see, we would
get ONE HP 1100 Laserjet per year, and you start from nothing, get
some info off the Internet, find the problem, wait for the part,
install it, learning all the way through, since every printer is a
different beast and has it's own custom set of symptoms and related
causes. And then you get no 1100's for 2 years. Small town, narrow
customer pool, it has it's share of little problems. Sometimes we even
sent the damn things to specialised joints, in order to get the job
done properly and on time. The Lexmark ink jets with their calibration
strips, the Epson with their morning hygiene and meditation, the
Canons..... well the Canons were actually my favorite, seldom anything
went bad except for the heads.

I keep rambling on here. Point is, no, I don't see a connection, but
you have probably met many more people of your trade than I ever will,
so your mileage *must* vary.
