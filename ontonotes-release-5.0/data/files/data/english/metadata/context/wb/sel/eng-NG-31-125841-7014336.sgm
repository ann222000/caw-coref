A new one on me!

Just watching BBC London news of a kid smashing his school window with a
large lump of concrete and getting it filmed on his mobile phone.
I guess this must use someting like super8 in a cartridge that is taken
out of the SD slot in the phone to be developed at the chemist before
using a telecine to post it on the internet.

I think he was laughing at the generic use of the word 'film' whilst
meaning video.

ah, right. I'm so quick to anger with this crap that I often miss the
joke. We've had footage of kids being beaten senseless, a lad being
thrown into a river (The Tyne is not a river renowned for safe
swimming) and an old chap walking his dog thrown into a large pond by
yobs. It would be nice if the companies who allow posting of such
stuff would warn that if the videos are of law breaking activities
they will be reported and details given to the police... or better
still, just hand the details over without the warning.

Indeed, and it would help if the media didn't give any details of
such videos unless asked to do so by the police - what better
(twisted) 'street cred' can these kids get than having even a still
image - let alone the actual video - of their actions splashed across
news-papers, TV and news web sites...

Yeah, our local papers online have a habit of doing this, though they
also look out for nostalgic clips etc so they aren't all bad. It seems
these yobs look at this a little as they look at asbos, like getting a
medal or something.

If the stills/footage shown are only those of *convicted*
hooligans, I don't see the problem - "this is what can
happen to you if you commit these offences" etc. Name and
shame, I say.

I work for a large bus company and my job involves, amongst
other things, looking for CCTV footage requested by police.
It has more than once been requested for use in the media,
although that aspect is handled by the company publicity
dept rather than me.

But they're actually showing the footage in a "Look what they've done
now!" way, and in the bunch of local incidents I've not heard of a
single arrest coming from showing the clips, despite often a grinning
idiot being shown just before the act of violence.

Yes, IF the person is caught in a crime they should have their faces
plastered all over, though even then one suspects they'd wear it as a
badge.
