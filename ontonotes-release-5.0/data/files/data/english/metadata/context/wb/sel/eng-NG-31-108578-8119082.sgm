On the morning of the resurrection of our LORD Jesus Christ, nearly
2000 years ago, after concluding that Jesus is risen from what the
women described and from what John and Peter corroborated, Cleopus and
Simon asked permission to depart immediately for Emmaus to inform
other followers of the wonderful news so that none would hide in fear
of the Romans any longer.

As they walked to Emmaus, Simon and Cleopus questioned each other's
belief about the resurrection.

Simon: &quot;Cleopus, do you really believe that Jesus is risen?&quot;

Cleopus: &quot;Could be.  HIS body is missing.  So it is at least
possible.&quot;

Simon: &quot;You're right.  I think I believe it too.  Come to think of it,
wasn't Lazarus dead three days when Jesus raised him from the dead
just by calling out to him and telling him to wake up?  Yes, if anyone
can come back from being crucified, our Jesus can!&quot;

Then a stranger walked up to them and inquired about what they were
talking so excitedly about.

Cleopus: &quot;Where have you been?  Have you been living in a cave
somewhere?  Our Teacher, Rabbi Jesus was unjustly charged and
convicted, then HE was tortured, nailed to a cross, and there died
three days ago.  We took HIS body down and laid it in a tomb.  This
morning, we discovered that HIS body is missing.  We think HE is
risen!&quot;

The stranger expressed an interest in the story and inquired as to
where they were going.  After being told that Cleopus and Simon were
going to Emmaus, the stranger informed them that they had a shared
direction.  The disciples invited the stranger to walk with them so
that the time would pass quicker.  As they walked and talked, the
stranger asked if they believed their Rabbi was the Messiah.  When
they said they knew HIM to be the Messiah because of all the miracles
they had witnessed HIM perform, the stranger proceeded to open up
Scripture to them by explaining how all the prophets predicted that
the Messiah would be crucified only to be resurrected on the third
day.  And, so the disciples started to understand that instead of
guessing or wondering about it, that they should have expected it from
the outset.

Then they reached Emmaus and the stranger seemed about to continue
walking on to a farther destination.  The disciples pleaded with the
stranger to stay with them and so the stranger relented.

However, instead of their stated mission to immediately inform
everyone that Jesus is risen, they found a place to eat...

The stranger broke the provided bread and handed portions to everyone.

After they had finished eating, Simon and Cleopus looked at each other
silently mouthing the realization that their stranger was Jesus!

However, when they finally dared to look in Jesus' direction...

... HE was gone!

Disappeared, they would later tell others.  But then they were asked
how Jesus disappeared and in their embarrassment, they confessed they
were too busy eating to notice.

Cleopus: &quot;You know, that was Jesus all along.  Did you not feel that
burning in your heart?&quot;

Simon: &quot;You too? Yes, me too. Come to think of it, whenever we were
with Jesus before, we always had that burning in our hearts, didn't
we?&quot;

Cleopus: &quot;Yes!  Remember when we were on the sea of Galilee when that
dreadful storm kicked up while Jesus was sound asleep.  We woke HIM up
and HE simply rebuked the sky and the sea, everything settled down,
and HE went back to sleep.  Didn't we have that burning in our hearts
when HE did that?

Simon: &quot;Yes!  And, remember when we were at the Temple and HE took out
that large whip and snapped it about the ears of the moneychangers
driving them out?&quot;

Cleopus: &quot;Yes!  And, when HE preached to us on the mountainside
telling us about all of GOD's blessings, especially when HE got to the
blessing about... do you remember which one?

Simon: &quot;Yes!  When HE said, 'Blessed are you who hunger now, for you
will be satisfied.' ! ! ! &quot;

**end Spirit-guided exegesis of Luke 24:13-15**

Questions to ponder:

(1) What was the 'burning in the heart' that allowed Cleopus and Simon
to retrospectively recognize the risen Jesus Christ and would allow us
to prospectively recognize HIM when HE physically returns for us to
meet HIM in the air in the clouds?  Can you give three reasons why
your answer is correct?  If you can, please be prepared to give them.

(2) What kept Cleopus and Simon from recognizing the risen LORD Jesus
Christ either by sight or by voice, despite their having even had the
experience of having their feet washed by HIM?

(3) Are we better than Cleopus and Simon so that we won't be affected
by that which kept them from recognizing the risen LORD Jesus Christ?

LORD willing, the answers to these questions and more will be
discussed tomorrow from 10-11 AM EST at the Independence Day event
described within the text to be found at the following link:

Nice to see Andrew giving sock puppets 11 and 12 a rest while he uses his
emorycardiology address.  They've been worked hard recently spamming away his
unfortunate &quot;eating approach&quot; scam and it's hard not to feel sorry for them.

Very naughty cross post to sci.med snipped

Sad to note that you feel abused when you feel hungry from receiving
GOD's blessings.

For this reason, it is likely you will run to the nearest restaurant
eating until you explode when LORD Jesus Christ returns with wondrous
power for HIS brethren to meet HIM in the air.

May GOD bless you in HIS mighty way making you healthier (hungrier)
than ever.

Prayerfully in Jesus' awesome love,

Andrew lost his power of reason when he betrayed his scientific discipline
and attempted to accomodate the lies which fundamental creationists
perpetuate.  From this, Andrew has become so sensitive to the truth that
he leaves the room before it enters.
This has resulted in his posts appearing as though they were written by a
2 dimensional cartoon character.  The text below is reworked to reflect
this:
