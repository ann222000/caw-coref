My 406 1.9td 97 P failed the MOT on emissions the reading came out at
an average of 3.60 the limit being 3. Prior to the MOT i  put some
diesel treatment into the diesel tank and changed the air filter and
thrashed it for about a week before the Mot was due but it still
failed the emissions??. I ve tried some more injector cleaner since
and gave it a good thrashing, had it re tested but no change. The car
is regularly serviced and has covered 130,000 miles.  Does anyone have
any suggestions as to what it might be!!!!!!!
Thanks
Graham

Change the oil and filter.
Couple of gallons only of decent fuel in the tank, plus another flask of
anti smoke jollop.
Make an appointment for MoT (somewhere else) and half an hour before taking
it in, head up and down the nearest motorway at three to four thousand revs.
Into the centre with the engine ottasell and straight onto the emissions
test.

Hi

Your speedometer cable could be loose in the back of the speedometer.
I would check both ends of the cable to make sure they are connected
properly.  Or to eliminate the cable you could have it changed.
Failing that it could be the speedometer head which could be at fault.
