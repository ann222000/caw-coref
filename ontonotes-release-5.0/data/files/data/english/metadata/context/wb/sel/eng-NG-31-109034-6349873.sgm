Alright.  Back from a week in Florida with internet access limited in a very
extreme way (ie no access to my normal email system).

Working with the feedback from y'all, I'm going to take the following stab
at a likely course of events:
Nixon tries to appeal to the anti-war left to some extent or another; the
extent is largely up to him, but in doing so, he strains his credibility
with both sides...this does seem to be a theme for politicians.  Nixon gets
trapped by the war due to campaign bumbling on this issue (his anti-war
stance gets him very little additional support, and costs him support on the
right; when he comes back, he loses what he gained on the left, and doesn't
gain much on the right to counter it), and when he finally settles on a "new
approach" as his campaign theme, it doesn't pay off...LBJ gets everyone to
the negotiating table that Nixon historically prevented them from getting
to.

Additionally, Nixon's waffling around costs him a certain amount of support
in the South.  LBJ...I'm uncertain what is going to happen here, given that
the South revolted against him in '64.  I think he still holds Texas
solidly, but the odds of him doing well in the South are pretty slim.  With
that said, he'd have a somewhat stronger base in the northeast, and be able
to dig in more effectively in the Midwest and California, especially if
Nixon is sagging more heavily.

With all of that considered, I'll say that Wallace picks up about 4% in the
South...taken evenly from Nixon and LBJ (the latter not even trying in most
Southern states following 1964).  The exception is Texas, where LBJ simply
blows Nixon out of the water by about 7% due to a combination of home-field
advantage, Nixon's weakness, and the fact that Wallace didn't register as
well there as he did in the rest of the South.  Wallace doesn't pick up as
much elsewhere; the national net gain for him will be around 2%.  Most of
this peels off of Nixon, who loses another 2% to LBJ.  Wallace only manages
to add on Tennessee and South Carolina to his bag (Tennessee was a close
loss for him of about 3%; South Carolina was won by Nixon by 6%), the latter
only going barely in.  LBJ also adds on California in a razor-thin victory,
as well as managing to stuff his way to a victory in Illinois, courtesy of
the Mayor of Chicago.  Wisconsin, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Missouri, and
Alaska also come into the Johnson column.  The final electoral result is 330
Johnson, 143 Nixon, 65 Wallace.  The popular vote comes in at about 43.5%
Johnson, 41.5% Nixon, 15% Wallace.

Now that the election is dealt with, Johnson does know that he's in ill
health (heart problems), and he doesn't want to leave an unfinished war as
his legacy...if he gets everyone to the table in fall, 1968, and begins
peace talks, I know that they'll go on and on.  How long did the historical
talks last, out of curiousity?

By the way, peace talks aside, I can't see the Democratic party avoiding, at
the very least, a destructive 1972 bout of infighting, but we'll get to that
in due time.  With that said, again, I invite comments, other ideas for what
might happen (which I'm definitely interested in hearing, and which keep me
realistic), and the occasional snide remark.

By anti-war left, I'm thinking of the people outside the Chicago convention
in OTL.  The RFK-McCarthy-McGovern crowd, not just people who were against
the war being, in their eyes, mishandled.  Essentially, the "pull out now"
and "sack the draft" crowds versus the "new approach" line he ended up
taking.  Of course, I could just be misinterpreting things, too.

It would be very weird if Nixon adopted
an unconditional-withdrawal position.
It would probably push lots of conservative
non-Southern voters to Wallace. I don't know
how many anti-war voters he'd gain. Long
before Watergate, Nixon was demonized by
American liberals.

I could see Humphrey, McCarthy, et al
running an independent ticket.

I guess my question is this, now: In a less chaotic but still clearly bossed
convention, would the RFK-McCarthy-McGovern crowd have stuck it out with the
party, sat the election out, or bolted?

I don't think that McGovern in 1868 put himself forward as a
presidential candidate on his own merits.

The McGovern position was:  "If you cannot stand Johnson/Humphrey
warmongering, and you cannot stomach Eugene McCarthy, then vote for me."

I think McCarthy had a legitimate beef against McGovern. When the Peace
Democrats are behind the warmongers in delegate numbers, and many of
them are ronin  mourning their dead leader, Bobby Kennedy,  the
reasonable course is to regroup behind the most viable anti-war
candidate who still breathes, namely Gene McCarthy.

Men like McGovern bolluxed that possibility.

Instead, the Non Johnson Faction took off on a scavenger hunt  for
Anybody but McCarthy.  They wasted time and money on an expectation that
Ted Kennedy would inherit his brother's campaign, and  took comfort from
really tiny indications that maybe Teddy might try  to be President..
"Ted Kennedy did not say: count me out until after an hour had passed."

A Minnesotan, McCarthy was from Humphrey's home state, so the
possibility of a  Humphrey/ McCarthy ticket was not feasible. It would
have mean that  Minnesota's electoral votes could not be counted for
their favorite sons because of a constitutional requirement that each
State, in voting for President and Vice President, vote for at least one
to be from a State other than their own.

(True,  in the declining years of the Republic, there was an election
(2000) where both the President and the Vice President were from Texas.
The Vice President claimed Wyoming was his home, and everybody rolled
over and agreed that was so.  But (a) the poor old Republic was much
healthier in 1968 than it would be thirty two years later, and (b) Gene
McCarthy was in office as the Senator from Minnesota, so he could hardly
fake Wisconsin citizenship on the basis of having a fishing cabin in
that state. Maybe the Hump could be the one to claim Wisconsin origin on
the basis of a vacation home there.

(But when Nixon sees Humphrey climb in the polls after claiming to be
from Wisconsin, I can see Dick Nixon going around the country with a hat
like a wedge of cheese on his head constantly. And how can George
Wallace claim to be a Cheesehead?)

I suppose the bottom line is that McCarthy was too acerbic. He mocked
the pretenses of his fellow Senators and Congressmen, and they  saw him
as a sarcastic asshole and were not willing to see whether he would
mature into a statesman if in the Oval Office.

So what if . . . . .

The manager of the Ambassador Hotel is not a happy man. Several of the
hotel's investors have called him up, chewing his ass because he  had
not booked  Robert Kennedy's California headquarters that night. Kenndy
and Company are celebrating heartily at the Hilton and there were only
McCarthyites at the Ambassador, ordering hamburgers, not steaks, and
sleeping four to a room.

"I fired Jim over this. The idiot never consulted me when he turned down
the bookings over an argument on phone costs."

A bell hop, out of breath, runs into the office.  "Sir, sir, there was a
shooting --- this guy shoots Senator McCarthy  in the kitchens."

Months later, Bobby Kennedy is watching the  delegates cast votes at the
1968 Democratic Convention,  Bobby had given a much praised speech at
Eugene McCarthy's funeral  (tho RFK personally thought McCarthy was a
jerk) and all of the McCarthy delegates were now voting Kennedy. Alas,
the Kennedy minority, augmented by the McCarthy minority, was still a
minority at the convention.

Humphrey is the nominee, but would Kennedy sit on his hands (as
McCarthjy did in OTL) and not bother to endorse the Hump until a week in
advance of election day? I don't think so.
