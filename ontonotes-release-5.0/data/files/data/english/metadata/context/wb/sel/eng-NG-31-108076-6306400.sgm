Yeah, it was Kurdistan.  Zero US Troops killed there, thankful
population...all the neocon stuff was apparently based upon these
people.

So, what now?  We should devote investment money there and encourage
Kurdish emigration from other countries.  The biggest obstacle to
Kurdistan is Turkey and the other neighboring nations, who've
periodically had a Kurdish Problem.  However, the problem really was a
separatist movement and Turkey not wanting to have Kurds establish
some independent region at Turkey's expense.  Likewise in Iran and
Syria.

The Kurdish State can be established at Iraq's expense.  Nobody will
care about that shit.  The Kurds should be encouraged to do what the
Jews did, which is take in zealous pilgrims and put them into frontier
areas, IOW, expand south and establish solid Kurdish majorities
ecompassing Kirkuk.  The Kurds can move to their nation from Turkey,
eliminating the "problem" as Turkey may see it.  Same from other
States in the region.

Once a few years have passed, some of which already have, Kurdistan
will become a significant bilateral trade partner w/ Turkey, which it
essentially already is.  The consequent decrease in Kurdish unrest has
been an eyeopener for Turkey, and they will eventually come around to
having a mostly friendly southern neighbor.  The construction
materials and whatnot coming into Kurdistan are flowing through
Turkey...Iraq from the South is far too dangerous.  The increase in
development has been helpful for Turkey.

So, given that Bush will no longer be in power in 2 years, and the
incoming President is almost certain to draw down US involvement
there, partition is inevitable.  I'd expect the Shiites to blink
first, declaring a Shiite nation...once this occurs, the Kurds should
quietly do the same and should receive immediate western recognition.

We build up Kurdistan, drain the Kurdish "nuisance" as the arabs see
it from their countries, give them a state, back out and declare
victory.  Kurdistan would be a positive development for the region, a
staunch ally, and would actually serve to moderate Turkey's drift to
the right.  Let the arabs continue to fight, build a big wall around
the Kurds and let them live.  Within a decade, they'll be prosperous
while Baghdad remains an Arab cesspool.

No political leader in his right mind will allow a separatist movement
to break up his country. The new Iraqi leader you have propped up may
turn against you.

Panama seceded from Columbia with the help of the U.S., to protect the
"American interest", so to speak.

The U.S. did more than just Panama. The U.S. has been breaking up
other people's country for ages. North and South Korea is one example.
North and South Vietnam is another example, but the U.S. failed badly
on that one. After 10 years and 50,000 dead American soldiers, the
Americans finally turned tail and ran.

Now history is repeating itself in Iraq.

Although the U.S. is fond of breaking up other people's country for
kicks, it will be a different story if its own states try to break
away.

We've done it with the Philippines, and with Puerto Rico- Samoa. Neglected
to annex the Caribbean islands, Baja California- or even the West Coast of
Canada as an access to Alaska. As Imperialists, we're pretty much of a
failure.
Iraq was never a 'nation' except by the imposition of brute force- from the
time of Cyrus the Great.
On top of that, Persians and Arabs hate one another- their common belief in
Islam notwithstanding. Saladin, himself a Kurd, *hated* and distrusted
Arabs- and rightly so. The split between Sunni/Shiite goes back to the
*death of Mohammed* and the arrogation of power by Abu Bakr.
Iran/Iraq were split because 'Persia' is a bad motherfucker. Kuwait was
created as a tool against them both; fields and port access mostly.
Balkanizing Iraq and crippling Iran militarily is a good short-term
solution. The religious question between the various parties in the ME is so
great that no political solution is relevant.

Nixon's mistake was that he was caught. Any politician would have done
what he did.

He was forced to resign because he did the right thing. He put an end
to his predecessors' madness and crime against humanity (the U.S.
carpet-bombing of Cambodia) :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_Incursion#Incursion_operations
The bombardment of Cambodia began in 1965 as the Johnson
administration commanded primarily tactical bombing in support of more
than two thousand ground incursions by the CIA and US Special Forces.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From 1965 to 1968 US planes flew 2,565 sorties dropping 214 tons of
">

bombs. Beginning March 18, 1969, with the launch of the Menu Campaign,
the Nixon administration escalated the incursion into a massive carpet
bombing campaign that would see American forces drop 2,756,941 tons of
bombs on Cambodia until Congress imposed an end to the bombing in
August 1973. The total tonnage dropped exceeded that dropped by the
combined Allied forces during World War II, including the bombs
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. http://migs.concordia.ca/links/

The arab tribes never invades outside of arabia against others.... until
Islam. Then they invaded everywhere and on all borders. They killed or
submitted or exiled acoss all of north africa, all the middle east,
india, afganistan, indonesia, malaysia, and every state they've been in.

One of the saddest conquests was watching the lugnut taliban, blowing up
those buddha statues at bamiyan. I knew a guy who gave up a dreadful
heroin habit by declaring his intention in front of those things, and
meeting hard hard working people from that area, who were kind, and fed
and gave him teas, and hospitality who had little but hard work, faith
and charitableness to strangers in their lives. Also the  persians, who
once had a magnificent history, one that was noted in the Torah, long
ago, the leader, Cyrus, who was extolled for his qualities, and their
human rights chartering in a part of the world- being erased now,
finally, by the thugs of Islam in Iran- a name that means aryan in
farsi, I think, taken when Germany was inspiring the muslims in 39'.

Ah, people do like to ignore the horrors of the 'oppressors' of the
world. Like the 250,000 vietnamese who lost their lives after the US

I think I'll go watch 'Lawrence of Arabia' from 1962 or so. That film
does depict how ruthless the arabs are with each other and have been
forever. Even when they had a chance with old T.E. to forge a union.
They screwed the pooch.

And will continue to do so.  When I read of the life of Mo' I see an
abused child, possibly sexually so later on when he was 10, abandoned
about six times, and when he finlly took control of the Kabaa family
business, that he'd been shut out of, his ruthlessness to his own Meccan
tribe, and subsequently to all others, is easy to see driving the
violent hatreds all the muslim sects have for each other, and then all
of everyone else.

Actually, back to Cyrus the Great, and including Saladin, the
Persians/Ottoman muslims have been far less rabid about Israel/Jews than the
Arabs. Saladin himself, a Kurd, hated Arabs; didn't trust them, despised
them for their martial practices/rules of engagement; despised their
treachery and cowardice-
Kurds would be far better 'neighbors' than anyone giving any allegiance to
Arabic Islam.

Besides being correct, this is really beside the point.

The Kurds should be encouraged to do what the JEWS DID, not to be
friends w/ Israel.  The Jews have succeeded in colonizing beyond the
Green Line largely by importing relative zealous immigrants to settle
there.  The Kurdish region does not specifically extend into Kirkuk,
although the city has a sizable Kurdish majority.  What needs to occur
is that, mixed race or not, the Kurds surround the city.  Let its
ongoing arab inhabitants live as minorities, not in a city within
larger Arabia, but within a true Kurdish zone.  The Kurds need to
migrate and establish settlements to the south of Kirkuk, encircling
it and then re-dig the trench or build a wall there.  That gives them
a financial position with the resource richness of that city that they
need.  Arab Iraq has sufficient wealth in the south to support the
warring arab factions or else the sunnis can pack up and fkin move to
the Gulf States, who gives a shit really?

Honestly, the only sane policy for Iraq is partition, as I said before
the fkin war.  Yes, Virginia, it turns out that I really AM smarter
than everyone else.  You all know damn well that if I was "Minister of
War" for this country, your SUVs would be gassed up right now w/ high-
octane Iraqi unleaded instead of this $1T of "community debt" we've
acquired instead.

O.T. but I'm still mulling over my conversation yesterday in my office
with a muslim, whom I respect as a person, very much.

They told me, as we began our usual friendly conversations...
'you know, there is a nazi movement in Islam'
Those taliban, they are nazi's who'd kill anyone who'd disagree with them.
We discuss, and I have to hold my thoughts, because they want to pour
out like a rain, but it's this one's moment, and as we discuss Iraq, and
the butchering between the 'sects' which is nonsense- it's muslims who
willingly and devotedly slaughter any others, muslims, and of course,
infidels are just all the easier to eradicate and homicide, that stand
in their way- that one also goes on about how they're nazi's and read
nazi like tracts and so on....

This one four yr's ago, asked me
'Why don't you (jews) kill Arafat, the murderer?'
And I told this one....'Why don't you muslims kill Arafat, and we'll
have another jewish holiday in your honor!

Now.... four years later, here we were.... and this one's filling me in
on the little secret in their heart- that there's a nazi moviement
within Islam, that is willing to kill anyone, everyone for themselves.

And the conversation that I could pull out...
'When are the good people going to take over and throw those butchers
and murderers out?' asked I...

But it was a rhetorical question, because as this one's eyes bespoke the
fact that they'd be killed, erased for standing up and stating such
things.

I can't tell you if it's a man, or a women because I'd be guilty of
putting their lives at risk.

Yeah.... I had a cigar, and thought about the conversation ....

By definition Muslims do not fight each other, that would
not be halal. Before killing another muslims he has to be
declared a heretic and an apostate. IIRC  death is
the only possible punishment for apostasy. And that is
exactly the way the islamists deal with the moderates or
modernists. Judging by the letter of their book, their
(fundmentalist) judgement might be accurate.

There really are some interesting parallels between
islamic fundatmentalism and NS ideology:

Both resent modernisation, industrialisation and
a culture which they see as based on materialism
and unethic utilitarianism. They are romantic in a political
sense, they favour emotion and belief over ratio and common
sense. They also strongly believe in sacrificing yourself
and others for the 'cause' and the neccesity of eradicating
the enemy through force.

Most nazi executioners claimed that they were under orders
and would face severe punishment if they would not commit the
crimes they took part in. But that was not true. Most of the
time refusing to commit a crime was simply ignored.
Even speaking out against the crimes commited during the NS
rule would not necessarily bring you into trouble. But most
people believed it would or used this as an excuse after the
war. Another parallel?

the killing of each other muslim- that they may call the other apostate

It is much more than 'sacrificing oneself for the cause. It is the

Actually, you are incorrect. The arabs occupied the entirety of north
africa, conquered the entire world around their arabia, and moves into
Europe, last being defeated on a day- 9/11 in vienna. Kind of rings
familiar doesn't it? Oh, and when Thomas Jefferson asked ambassador in
1786, why the few frigates from the US were attacked, people murdered,
enslaved, and the merchadize and ships looted, he was told, by the Arab
ambassador representing the muslim states...."&gt;  During their
discussions, they questioned Ambassador Adja
as to the source of the unprovoked animus directed at the nascent
United States republic.
Jefferson and Adams, in their subsequent report to the Continental
Congress,
recorded the Tripolitan Ambassador’s justification:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; … that it was founded on the Laws of their Prophet, that it was written in their Koran,
">

that all nations who should not have acknowledged their authority were
sinners,
that it was their right and duty to make war upon them wherever they
could be found,
and to make slaves of all they could take as Prisoners,
and that every Musselman who should be slain in Battle was sure to go
to Paradise..."

so you see, it had nothing to do with being 'occupied' but rather
admiring the nazi ethnic cleaning and world domination theology that
they found so lucious. The persians even named their nation....  Iran,
which is farsi for 'aryan'
So.... DUH, mouseboy, you idiots glossover, about being 'exploited by
the English' is an idiots retort- nonsensical denial. Kind of like the
guy who murders his parents and then asks for mercy from the court
because he's an orphan.

No, dufus- being stupid as you are, being a man who tries to peddle
sophomoric inaccuracies to cover for the actual history won't fly.
Except for the flies, and mice, like yourself.

Most of the death and suffering of the world, since you like to engage
logical tautologies- has been caused by marxist false messianism,
killing over 120 million during it's century of madness and tyranny.

Oh and the muslims don't worship the same thing that Jews and Christians
worship, nor any of the other 'faiths'.

And so, the marxists who worship the collective of man, and no god,
butchered more than all the others in a shorter time, so dodging the
issues to present your mouse like fallacies about 'three religions'
caused most of the death and suffering is beyond stupid.

Jews didn't kill in the name of their religion. Christianity turned
itself into something that created the federal republic, the democracy
that is the US. A magnificent ( not holy ) and worthy testament to it's
source and sight. The homicidism, that is worldwide, against all others,
includind muslims slaughtering muslims, is it's own- there is nothing of
Christianity nor Judaism in any of that.

Although, marx was extremely close in his view of what 'peace' meant in
'socialism'

he said, that peace was the absence of competing ideologies or economic
systems.... get it?  That's why they killed and slaughtered so so so many.

Oh, and sparky- Mein Kampf- my cause, is the same as 'My Jihad'
So stick your bullshit rationalizations up your mouse orifice..... DUH

Hey Duh-llard, just as an aside to the point- any day, almost, any week
almost, we can read such as this:

PATTANI, Thailand: Some are already calling it war, a brutal Muslim
separatist insurgency in southern Thailand that has taken as many as
2,000 lives in three years, with almost daily bombings, drive-by
shootings, arson and beheadings.

It is a conflict the government admits it is losing. A harsh crackdown
and martial law in recent years seem only to have fueled the insurgency,
generating fear and anger and undermining moderate Muslim voices.

A new policy of conciliation pursued by Thailand's junta since it took
power in a coup five months ago has been met by increased violence,
including a barrage of 28 coordinated bombings in the south that killed
or injured about 60 people a week ago.

"The momentum of violence is now beyond the control of government
policy," said Srisompob Jitpiromsri, a political scientist at Prince of
Songkhla University here.

[...]

"Buddhist monks have been hacked to death, clubbed to death, bombed and
burned to death," said Sunai Phasuk, a political analyst with the Human
Rights Watch monitoring group. "This has never happened before. This is
a new aspect of violence in the south."

Some remote areas in the south have become, in effect, no-go zones for
the police or military, according to Francesca Lawe-Davies, an analyst
with the International Crisis Group.

Get it? This is how they do things, that no one else does, no one else
would do, and they invented it... pursue it, revel in it. It is their

I'm barely literate in English, so forgive my assuming much here.
I 'think' the word 'God' in arabic is   'ilah', and The God is 'Al-ilah'

It was ascribed to all pre-Islamic Gods.  The muslim sources mostly call
Allah, the 'lord of the gods'

I think 'hubul' ( not the astronomer) was the main Kabaa god. There were
something like 360 or more of these guys at the kabaa.
The koran tells muslims to worship al-lat, al-uzza, al-manat, 'the
daughters of al-llah.  Those were in those
'Satanic Verses' that were later abrogated. And to paraphrase a reviewer
of Islam:
...In Hebrew, “el,” was the word for god—lower case “g”—as in idols.
Elohiym was used with the article to convey “God” with a capital “G.” In
Arabic, “el” became “il.” Then, over time, Arabs derived a secondary
word for god, “ilah.” With “al” being the Arabic word for “the,” Muslims
would have us believe that “Allah” is a contraction of “al” and “ilah.”
But the first pillar of Islam contradicts this claim when it says:
“There is no ilah but Allah.” If “Allah” were the Arabic word for god it
would have been written: “There is no allah but Allah. Moreover, the
Qur’an itself uses “Ilah” when Allah claims to be “the God of Abraham”
(Qur’an 2:132). And that ends the debate because the only way Muslims
can claim Allah, not Ilah, is the Arabic word for “God” is for the
Qur’an to be errant or for its author to be either ignorant or
deceitful. Further, there are hundreds, if not thousands, of Islamic
traditions that confirm that Allah was the name of a well-known pagan
deity (at least in Mecca). Their own scriptures profess that Allah had
an ignominious rule as a Meccan rock idol centuries before he was
transformed from god to God, from an ilah to Allah. All of which serves
to destroy the most essential Islamic myth: “We all worship the same God.”

There's nothing to see here; Allah and YH-WH are exactly parallels here.

&gt;  &gt; It was ascribed to all pre-Islamic Gods.  The muslim sources mostly call

&gt; Yes just as Yahweh is the top dog of all the gods in your Torah. Everyone is

Indeed, everyone is entitled to their own opinions... but NOT their own
facts. And since the entire theology is at odds with the Torah, and the
Christian God, to 'submit' and or kill them, one might tend to look at
he facts. Especially the killing of one's own- as Mo' did to the
Meccan's, and as sunni and do to shia and vice versa today.

Facts and history do in fact define and defy the reality far better than
mere semantics.

Did you ever read the Torah? The 12 Tribes were not all hugs and kisses were
they. For most of their existence there was not one kingdom but two. The
Torah is full of violence very much like the Koran. Where did the Arabs
learn about stoning?

You dumbass clown.
The killing was against certain people, at a few certain times, in
certain places. And the religion and culture developed a vast legal
system, based upon the ethics and morality that bespeak not a killing
zone, but mercy, and compassion. And it was in Israel- not to be applied
to others. No compulsion there.

Now.... compare that, to the homicidism of Islam, against all infidels,
all time, everywhere.  The command to conquer, to destroy, and the
entire history of just that, and now, at our very day.

The arabs never invaded outside of arabia, until Islam, that's the
murderous rage that Mo' brought to them.

No you dumbass clown... those are the facts, that is the history and
tying to be a twerp with an 8th graders sense of the stupid, and going

You are a lying coward- period.

You? Talking about normal, pffft, what a joke.
Unless you happen to be a Hittite, girgashite, amorite, canaanite,
perizzite, hivite, or jebusite, those killing passages don't apply to
you. The koran exhorts believers to fight unbelievers without
specifiying anywhere in the text that only certain unbelievers are to be
fought, or only for a certain period of time, or some other distinction.
The command to make war against unbelievers is open-ended and universal.
The Torah in contrast, records G-d's commands to the Israelites to make
war against a particular people only.

That's why Jews ( and Christians ) haven't formed terror groups around
the world who quote scriptures to justify killing civilian non-combatants.

You stupid troll- you pretentious clown.
Now go back to peddling the falsity about the three religions, and try
to duck out with what's left of your whiskers. Oh, but do bring up some
marxist revisionism from somewhere.

Hey dumbass... almost any day of every week, in the world, muslims are
killing non-muslims. Like everyday this month- and today-

Indian train blast: Jihad groups suspected (*** maybe it was the
mennonite's, or mossad, or the hopi's, or the amish, or the methodists-
nope, guess who it was??)

However, no group has claimed responsibility. "Indo-Pak peace train hit
by terror; 67 dead," from NewsLocale:

Terror struck the Samjhauta Express early Monday morning when a
bomb blast ripped apart the peace train causing the death of at least 67
people and injuring many others. The attack involved two crude bombs and
occurred near the Indian city of Panipat.

The train links New Delhi with Lahore and was restarted in 2004 as
a mark of peace between the two warring neighbors. It is not clear how
this will affect the peace process, but one fact was significant. This
is the first terror attack to target innocent citizens of both countries.

Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf called the attack wanton and
vowed that it would only strengthen the peace process rather than derail
it. "Such wanton acts of terrorism will only serve to further strengthen
our resolve to attain the mutually desire objective of sustainable
peace," he said.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the culprits would
be brought to book. The finger of suspicion is being pointed at Islamic
terrorist groups Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, although no group
has claimed responsibility.

Uhh; that would be Arab, Iraqi/Iranian, the Syrians and an odd Lebanese or
two, wouldn't it?

The old Roman Empire style xtianity was doing it for a bit there- but they
had a history long before they met Jews, much less Christians.
It's funny, the more extreme Christians are, the less warlike.
