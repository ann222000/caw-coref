Hi,
Please could someone tell me if there is a gizmo to connect an internal hard
drive (in good working order), taken out from an otherwise defunct machine -
to a different computer just to transfer some of the files?
TIA
Steve.

Yep - search ebay for &quot;usb ide&quot;. They come as either cables with usb one
end and a drive connector the other (plus a power supply brick) - which
is ideal for &quot;one off use&quot;. Or come as external boxes (again with a
power supply brick) - which is ideal if you want to use the drive time
and time again..

If you go for the external box, go for one with a fan. The ones without
tend to overheat the drive..

Jst unplug the CD type drive of the new PC and plug the hard drive in
instead of it.

I think Niel was thinking of the CD being on the secondary IDE channel thus the
master setting would be OK?

Oh, I think that checking and setting jumpers is so second nature to
Niel that he didn't think to mention it.

A bit like not thinking to ask a user that is reporting his computer
doesn't work if he actually has power in the house at the
time...BTDTGTTS... :(

Thank you all for your helpful advice. I think I'll plump for the first
suggestion, as I've just finished upgrading the 'new' machine and I can't be
bothered to get inside it again. Especially considering that the Hdd is my
daughter's which her boyfriend was responsible for backing up...but never
got round to it!
Niel, nice to hear from you again, the T22 I bought from you is still going
strong!

Regards,
Steve.

Nah Niel just wasn't thinking. Just after I posted that I had an image of
someone trying to cram an IDE ribbon into a SATA connection. lol

Why can you not simply connect it to a spare internal cable? all pc's
have several.

The Dell I worked on yesterday only had one IDE connection, and on
that was one hard drive and a CD drive.  When I tried to put another
hard drive on where the cd was, the whole system stopped booting.

Nice of Dell to force people to upgrade in that way!

Dell may have been using cables supporting 'cable select'

As a little experiment once, I took an IDE cable that was working fine
on other machines, and tried getting it to work on a Dell. Which
involved moving the connector down the cable, 1cm at a time (and cutting
off the tail) until the drive was recognised.

I *like* Dells and think that they are often excellent value for money..
But have always allowed twice the time to fit additional drives in their
small format models as with any other machines..

Thinks may change with SATA - But none of the machines I look after are
that modern as to have SATA, yet..

SATA started with the GX280 series as far as Optiplexes go.... :)

Nope, didnt make any difference.  It would boot without the cd drive
there, but if anything other came in contact (I tried another cd
drive), it refused to boot!
