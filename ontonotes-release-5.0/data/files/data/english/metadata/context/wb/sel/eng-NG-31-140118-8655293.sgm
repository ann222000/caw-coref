Boy that Abreu really looks washed up, huh? And that Chamberlain kid still
has so much to prove. And Cabrera and Cano - send 'em back to Trenton!

Swept the RedSox three best pitchers, lead the WC and are only 5 back in
the division after being in last place, 14.5 games out, in April.

Yeah, the Yankees sure do suck.

LOL. You know you have the Angels to thank for putting Seattle away 3
straight?

Bring it on. I would love to see Angels v Yanks in the playoffs again.
Just paid for my playoff tix. I could probably sell one game for 6
times face.

Every little bit helps. I'm sure the Yankees will try to return that
favor next week.

That's all? Redsox fans can resell mid-season games against Tampa Bay
for more than 6-times face. Shit, they go on eBay for 10 times face or
more.

I got 7x face for two regular season games versus the Yanks, but with
commissions it comes to 6x. I asked 6x for the Red Sox and didn't get a
nibble. Red Sox fans in SoCal are cheap. So I went to all 3 Red Sox games.
No way I'm cutting bargains for fans of either team.

At Fenway, day of game SRO tix face for $25. People hawk them on Yawkee
way for a minimum of $150.
