Keep the focus on Vietraq

By Dennis Rahkonen
Created Oct 12 2006 - 8:48am

Election day will be here in less than a month, and things are looking up
for Democrats.

Their chances of capturing the House (maybe even the Senate) have been
bolstered by a series of very damaging revelations, with creepy Congressman
Mark Foley's sexual behavior, and the ensuing cover-up, really taking a bite
out of public faith in the GOP.

And, as anyone who's sat down recently to shoot the bull at barber shops or
corner cafes can readily affirm, there's a floodtide of disgust with the
Republicans' ever more outrageous, profits-before-people obsession. Not many
regular working stiffs, who thankfully comprise our voting majority, take
kindly to a pro-plutocracy agenda that wants to abolish Paris Hilton's
inheritance taxes while keeping the federal minimum wage frozen below the
official poverty level.

Just as an informative aside, did you know that maids and other service
employees at the Hilton hotel nearest to Los Angeles' airport are so poorly
paid that some can't even afford housing? Having to clean rooms for others
while being personally homeless is the ultimate indictment of Bush-era
economic injustice.

Meanwhile, Paris parties late into the night.

But all this doesn't guarantee that onrushing waves will obliterate the
Republican sandcastle on November 7.

The news cycle shifts like a belly dancer's hips, and what's wonderfully
encouraging for liberals and progressives one instant can be supplanted by
sudden cause for deep despair the next.

Anything can still happen, including a second 9/11-scale terrorist attack,
or maybe Karl Rove rolling the long-preserved body of Osama bin Laden out of
cold storage, just in convenient time for Dubya to go before the nation and
smirkingly proclaim, "We got him!"

That's why we should insulate ourselves against possible fortune reversal by
concentrating on the single issue that's the sharpest arrow in our quiver.

Vietraq.

It owes its bloody existence to mammoth lies, while costing $2 billion
dollars a week, and stuffing Mr. and Mrs. Average Citizen's precious sons
and daughters into a perpetually churning meat grinder.

There's a wall in Washington with 58,000 names -- lives wasted in another
rich man's dirty war that shouldn't have ever been started.

No matter what the Greedy Old Party does in the next few weeks to
manipulatively try to save its skin, the American people simply aren't
willing to start quarrying granite and sharpening chisels in preparation for
an eventual, second wall with ultimately perhaps even more names, years or
possibly decades down the line.

How many more "hometown heroes"' will we lay beneath cemetery sod, to the
mournful strains of Taps, as an endless succession of family survivors
endure the soul-devouring ravages of constant grief? For what? For George
Bush, his wife, and their dog to be the last three living things on the
whole planet to go on believing that it's all "good"?

Simply put, staying means more slaying; leaving means less grieving. And
please don't forget the Iraqi people being mass-murdered because of our
"liberating" presence.

Brothers and sisters, get out Bob Woodward's book. Preach it on soapboxes.
Use the consensus findings of the National Intelligence Estimate to tip over
fence sitters. Hold high every new disclosure that exposes past mendacity.
Fight like hell for peace!

Then go to the polls in droves.

If we do it right -- and do it strong -- we'll wake up on the morning of
November 8 with joyous confidence that sweet kids still sleeping down the
hall won't have to one day kill and die in Donald Rumsfeld's sinister "gift"
to future generations.

Keep the focus squarely on Vietraq, and we'll win.
