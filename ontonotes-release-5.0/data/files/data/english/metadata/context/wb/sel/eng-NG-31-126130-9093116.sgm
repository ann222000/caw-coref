I was checking Mark Knopfler's website to see if he had announced any
North American shows to promote his latest album (none yet) and was
amazed at his schedule of dates for his European tour beginning in
late March. He's performing 22 out of 30 possible days in April, 25
out of 31 days in May and 11 times in the first 15 days of June. All
together that's 60 concerts in 78 days (I won't bother to list them
all here, but you can check it out at markknopfler.com/tour).

Although much of his music isn't quite as high energy as Mr.
Springsteen's, that's a pretty impressive schedule for a man who is
slightly older than Bruce (Aug. 12, 1949). I hope he survives to play
in the States.

No, he's not as high energy...but I find his stuff to be every bit as
interesting.
Actually, at this point...having been there/done that enough times with the
&quot;high energy&quot; thing (to the point
where it sometimes feels as though it's one long plodding song), I'd warmly
welcome someone who plays the
guitar with such finesse, has a wide range of material and has some dynamics
to his/her show.

I dunno....I think it's a bit hard to be objective (or maybe it's easier?)
after having seen Arcade Fire
twice within a half year...where one got it all: dynamics, energy, grace,
power, passion...and all the good stuff
that I remember loving about concerts twenty-some years ago).

Eh. I love Knopfler. He's may favorite guitarist by far. I like his
songwriting. I want him to produce a Bruce album.

The energy exerted by Mark is not even close to the energy Bruce puts
out at his shows.

I don't know if it'd be that good a match.
The results could be interesting...it'd be a matter of how much control
Springsteen
is willing to relinquish.
Just as it was interesting to hear Knopler's voice intertwined with miss
Emmylou's,
I think it'd be interesting to hear Springsteen's and Knopfler's very unique
styles of
lead-guitar on the same song...it'd be something of a tug-of-war.

In all honesty, my first choice would be to have Lanois produce a non-ESB
album with
Springsteen. Â Lanois tends to push the performers he produces...and doesn't
let
them slide to quickly when it comes to the quality of the songs they want to
lay down
for posterity.

S.R Vaughn and so on),
I'd put Knopfler at the top of the list...if only because his guitar playing
is not only sublime, but he never
ever seems to lose sight of the value that the song comes first and
foremost.
This can't be said of a good many of the axe-slingers who usually make the
top of the lists...
If I were making an album, I'd want Jerry Garcia (no longer an option, of
course) or Mark Knopfler doing
the lead-guitar work...

I'll repeat myself here, but the one thing I like about Knopfler's
production is the space he gives it. You can hear individual instruments
and everything! I think he builds an ambience pretty well (certainly not
as atmospheric as Lanois' production). I suspect that the concern where
Lanois is concerned is that, as you know, his production sometimes is
criticized for being...distracting? That it itself is the art and thus
overshadows the performer with whom he's working. I don't necessarily
agree with that, but Wrecking Ball, Oh Mercy and Time Out of Mind
certainly sound very much like Lanois had a big hand in them. I suspect
Knopfler's production would be a bit more subtle.

I think both Knopfler (in the producer role) and Lanois would have a
certain prominence in Bruce's eyes and he may be more apt to take their
suggestions...*if* he ever decided to place himself in that situation.

I'd welcome either...or eventually both!

T-Bone Burnett (probably too on the nose), Rick Rubin, Tony Brown...mix it
up.

I did not like the Dead at all. Just not my cuppa joe. However, I really
did like the guitar work Jerry did with Bruce Hornsby.

What you describe about Knopfler's playing is exactly my feeling and why
he's my favorite.

Mat Rollings is that way on piano (and is my favorite pianist). It was a
real treat that he was in the band when I saw Mark and Emmylou is '06. I
just wish he'd been more prominently displayed...but his playing on &quot;Romeo
and Juliet&quot; was worth the price of admission all by itself.

FYI-- there's a complete soundboard of their Verona show up Dime right
now. And it's a very well balanced and dynamic soundboard at that.
Their live document from All The Roadrunning is out there for purchase
of course, but it's nice to have another show, and this one even
sports a nice version of Â &quot;Michaelangelo,&quot; which is not on the legit
