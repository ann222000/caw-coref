(not up and running currently)

To switch the transmitter on, you need to send a CTCSS tone of 74.4 Hz.
The order of operation is thus: (allow for Doppler as necessary):
1) Transmit on 145.850 MHz with a tone of 74.4 Hz to arm the 10 minute
timer
on board the spacecraft.
2) Now transmit on 145.850 MHz (FM Voice) using 67.0 Hz to PT the
repeater on
and off within the 10 Minute window.
3) Sending the 74.4 tone again within the 10 minute window will reset
the 10
minute timer.
