Not just any kitty - I'm talking about a particular cat who has never
allowed me to get near him before. His name is Graham, and he's the
terror of the neighborhood, from a cat's point of view. He likes to
pick fights, and I've seen him and Smudge get into staring and/or
growling contests while I'm around. So who knows what goes on when
I'm not there?

But, like all bullies, he's a total wuss around people bigger than he
is - in this case, human people. He has always run away from me whenever
I've tried to go up to him. But lately, he's seemed to mellow a bit,
and the other day, I actually got to approach him, although he didn't
actually let me touch him.

Today, Smudge and I were walking by his house, and he came out to see
Smudge (and have a growl-off with her, no doubt). He stopped when he
saw me, and I bent down toward him, cooing at him gently. And he let
touch the top of his head! He even let out a little meep, like maybe
he was anticipating being petted. So I gave him a couple of scritches,
and then he walked away. But a few minutes later, I went over to him
again, reached down and touched his head - he meeped again - and I
petted him.

It was history in the making! I've lived in this neighborhood for 8
years, and I've never seen that cat let a human get near him (except
his humans, I suppose). Maybe he's finally starting to chill in his
old age.

It's really nice that you get to meet cats in your neighbourhood. Around
here, no one lets their cats outside. I guess that's why some people
seem to like my enclosure so much. I give them the chance to meet other
cats than their own. ;)

Then you're not just doing it for your cats - it's a public service, too. :)

I love meeting neighborhood cats. Quite a few people around here let their
cats go outside. It's a residential neighborhood, and also pretty quiet -
not a lot of teenagers or heavy traffic. Most people around here seem to
have pets - lots of people walk their dogs, and I see plenty of cats in
various windows. So in general, I think people around here like animals
and treat them well. I hear from various people that Smudge is fairly
popular among the humans, if not among the cats. :)

Where I used to live there was a nice calico girl that I used to meet nearly
every day, I got to know he favourate spots for snoozing outside.
Fortunately it was a quiet road, a couple of times when she decided to lie
down in the road I had to stop the car, pick her up and move her. Â I don't
know how old she was but she was full grown when I first saw her and I knew
her for just over 17 years.
