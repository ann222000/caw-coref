| US accused of killing women and children in Baghdad raid
|
| 1 hour ago
|
| BAGHDAD (AFP) -- American forces were accused of killing 10 people,
| including women and children, in a Baghdad raid on Friday as the
| US military announced a senior Al-Qaeda leader was killed in an air
| strike.
| ...
| Iraqi officials said the early-morning US air raid targeted a
| building in the majority Sunni Al-Saha neighbourhood in southwestern
| Baghdad where families were sleeping.
|
| Bodies were pulled out of the rubble of the building, which was
| destroyed.
|
| &quot;Ten people were killed and seven wounded when American helicopters
| attacked Building No 139 at 2.00 am. We have no idea of the reason
| for the attack,&quot; said an interior ministry official.
|
| There was no immediate comment from the US military.
|
| An official at Baghdad's Al-Yarmuk hospital said 13 people -- seven
| men, two women and four children -- were killed and 10 men and a
| woman were wounded. He said all the casualties were civilians.

This is why during a war the soldiers don't take their kids and wives
onto a battle field.

If our soldiers took their kids with them to Iraq and out on
missions...right there in their humvvees, and the kids ended up
getting blown up with an IED...
Most people would say &quot;DUH !...what did they think was going to
happen ? DUH !!&quot;

Any terrorist that really gave a damn about their family wouldn't be
around them.
Fact is the terrorists DON'T give a damn about their families.

Do they really expect to play &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; even
while organizing a terrorist campaign against our army and the Iraq
country ??
Do they expect to go around cutting the faces off family members with
piano wire or gang rape daughters in front of their families and the
go home with a free pass ?

What a load of crap. You actually believe that the people we're blowing up
over there are &quot;terrorists&quot;

Another Kool Aid drinker who believes everything he hears from the Bush

That event is referred  to as  A &quot;REGRETTABLE NECESSITY, n. An
avoidable atrocity. The term is often employed by presidents and prime
ministers when announcing bombings of civilian targets and invasions
of small countries.&quot;
-Chaz Bufe, The Devil's Dictionaries (&quot;American Heretic's Dictionary&quot;
section)

It has become a common practice in war. And done very effectively by
the United States.since the beginning of World War II.

Criticism began within days of the obliteration of the two Japanese
cities. On August 8, 1945, two days after the destruction of
Hiroshima, former President Herbert Hoover wrote,

&quot;The use of the atomic bomb, with its indiscriminate killing of women
and children, revolts my soul.&quot;

Two days later, John Foster Dulles and Methodist Bishop G. Bromley
Oxnam together urged President Truman to forgo additional use of the
new weapon, saying they opposed the bomb's indiscriminate obliteration
of human beings.

Within days of the Hiroshima bombing, David Lawrence, the editor of
what is now &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report,&quot; wrote that Japanese surrender
had appeared inevitable weeks before the bomb's use.

The claim of &quot;military necessity,&quot; he argued, rang hollow. Official
justifications would &quot;never erase from our minds the simple truth that
we, of all civilized nations ... did not hesitate to employ the most
destructive weapon of all times indiscriminately against men, women
and children.&quot;

Such criticisms were not limited to civilians. The very day after the
atomic bomb hit Hiroshima, the personal pilot of General Douglas
MacArthur, commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, recorded in his
diary that MacArthur was &quot;appalled and depressed by this Frankenstein
monster.&quot;

http://www.intellnet.org/resources/american_terrorism/Atomicvictims.html

The Fire-bombing of Dresden
&quot; It was our duty to carry out the bombing and we hoped it would help
to bring an early finish to the war.&quot;

Peter Twinn
Peter Twinn, 83, from Theydon Bois, Essex, was a Flight Lieutenant in
the 149 Squadron who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

An eye-witness account

We saw terrible things: cremated adults shrunk to the size of small
children, pieces of arms and legs, dead people, whole families burnt
to death, burning people ran to and fro, burnt coaches filled with
civilian refugees, dead rescuers and soldiers, many were calling and
looking for their children and families, and fire everywhere,
everywhere fire, and all the time the hot wind of the firestorm threw
people back into the burning houses they were trying to escape from. I
cannot forget these terrible details. I can never forget them

Since the facts of the combined USAF and RAF raids on Dresden became
known, mostly through the novel 'Slaughterhouse Five' by Kurt
Vonnegut, there has been great controversy as to why this appalling
raid was considered necessary.

The city had no military targets to speak of, and it was known that it
was packed with civilian refugees from the east. Here is an eye-
witness account by Lothar (shown here with his sister), just nine
years old, who survived.

http://timewitnesses.org/english/~lothar.html

It was February. 13th, 1945. I lived with my mother and sisters (13, 5
and 5 months old twins) in Dresden and was looking forward to
celebrating my 10th birthday February l6th. My father, a carpenter,
had been a soldier since 1939 and we got his last letter in August
1944. My mother was very sad to receive her letters back with the
note: &quot;Not to be found.&quot; We lived in a 3 room flat on the 4th floor in
a working class region of our town. I remember celebrating Shrove
Tuesday (February 13th) together with other children, The activities
of the war in the east came nearer and nearer. Lots of soldiers went
east and lots of refugees went west through our town or stayed there,
also in the air raid night February13th/14th.

About 9:30 PM the alarm was given. We children knew that sound and got
up and dressed quickly, to hurry downstairs into our cellar which we
used as an air raid shelter. My older sister and I carried my baby
twin sisters, my mother carried a little suitcase and the bottles with
milk for our babies. On the radio we heard with great horror the news:
&quot;Attention, a great air raid will corne over our town!&quot; This news I
will never forget.

Some minutes later we heard a horrible noise - the bombers. There were
nonstop explosions. Our cellar was filled with fire and smoke and was
damaged, the lights went out and wounded people shouted dreadfully. In
great fear we struggled to leave this cellar. My mother and my older
sister carried the big basket in which the twins were lain. With one
hand I grasped my younger sister and with the other I grasped the coat
of my mother.

We did not recognize our street any more. Fire, only fire wherever we
looked. Our 4th floor did not exist anymore. The broken remains of our
house were burning. On the streets there were burning vehicles and
carts with refugees, people, horses, all of them screaming and
shouting in fear of death. I saw hurt women, children, old people
searching a way through ruins and flames.

We fled into another cellar overcrowded with injured and distraught
men women and children shouting, crying and praying. No light except
some electric torches. And then suddenly the second raid began. This
shelter was hit too, and so we fled through cellar after cellar. Many,
so many, desperate people came in from the streets. lt is not possible
to describe! Explosion after explosion. It was beyond belief, worse
than the blackest nightmare. So many people were horribly burnt and
injured. lt became more and more difficult to breathe. lt was dark and
all of us tried to leave this cellar with inconceivable panic. Dead
and dying people were trampled upon, luggage was left or snatched up
out of our hands by rescuers. The basket with our twins covered with
wet cloths was snatched up out of my mothers hands and we were pushed
upstairs by the people behind us. We saw the burning street, the
falling ruins and the terrible firestorm. My mother covered us with
wet blankets and coats she found in a water tub.

We saw terrible things: cremated adults shrunk to the size of small
children, pieces of arms and legs, dead people, whole families burnt
to death, burning people ran to and fro, burnt coaches filled with
civilian refugees, dead rescuers and soldiers, many were calling and
looking for their children and families, and fire everywhere,
everywhere fire, and all the time the hot wind of the firestorm threw
people back into the burning houses they were trying to escape from.

I cannot forget these terrible details. I can never forget them.

Now rny rnother possessed only a little bag with our identitiy papers.
The basket with the twins had disappeared and then suddenly my older
sister vanished too . Although my rnother looked for her immediately
it was in vain. The last hours af this night we found shelter in the
cellar of a hospital nearby surrounded by crying and dying people. In
the next morning we looked for our sister and the twins but without
success. The house where we lived was only a burning ruin. The house
where our twins were left we could not go in. Soldiers said everyone
was burnt to death and we never saw my two baby sisters again.

Totally exhausted, with burnt hair and badly burnt and wounded by the
fire we walked to the Loschwitz bridge where we found good people who
allowed us to wash, to eat and to sleep. But only a short time because
suddenly the second air raid began (February14th) and this house too
was bombed and my mothers last identity papers burnt. Completely
exhausted we hurried over the bridge (river Elbe) with many other
homeless survivors and found another family ready to help us, because
somehow their home survived this horror.

In all this tragedy I had completely forgotten my l0th birthday. But
the next day rny mother surprised rne with a piece af sausage she
begged from the &quot;Red Cross&quot;. This was my birthday present.

In the next days and weeks we looked for my older Sister but in vain.
We wrote our present address an the last walls of our damaged house.
In the middle of March we were evacuated to a little village near
Oschatz and on March 3lst, we got a letter from my sister. She was
alive! In that disastrous night she lost us and with other lost
children she was taken to a nearby village. Later she found our
address on the wall of our house and at the beginning of April my
rnother brought her to our new home.

You can be sure that the horrible experiences of this night in Dresden
led to confused dreams, sleepless nights and disturbed our souls, me
and the rest of my farnily. Years later I intensively
