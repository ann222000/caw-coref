XE-1541 Cable Question..?? hummmm

I was wondering if I could plug the XE-1541 Cable into the back of my
Iomega SCSI 100 MB Zip Drive on the printer port and still get it to
work with the 1541 on the other side of the cable. After all, they ARE
BOTH SCSI!

Is this at all possible, or is this a &quot;new concept&quot; that no ones
thought about yet?

Please let me know whatever input you might have on the matter.

Thanks,

Charles

I doubt it.  Those ZIP parallel drivers take over the parallel port in
order to simulate SCSI.  I don't think any other software will work
&quot;over&quot; it.

I used for awhile an A/B bi-directional parallel switch.  You could
only use one device at a time, but you did not have to disconnect all
the time.

I don't think so, there're enough possibilities of
interference between both devices regarding the
control lines of the IEEE1284 interface.

&quot;They&quot; are not, this is complete bullshit, sorry.

As always, to tweak those components together,
get a microcontroller and implement a protocol
translation machine to let them talk to each
other in general. Then the question arises,
which of the both device would be the master,
sending commands to the other device ???

Oh boy, this is too weird, better invest your
time into something else, maybe an extended
C64 that would be able to emulate a today's
3500 MHz PC?

Well that didn't work either! :(:(:(:( I had to unplug the splitter
and plug the DB25 cable end DIRECTLY INTO THE PORT on the back of the
computer for it to acknowledge that there was a drive present. I guess
that the splitter deviates the signal or something causing the
software to NOT SEE the device! :(:(:(:(

Oh well, nice try...... Lolololol

you maybe shouldn't use some sort of _electronic_ switch.

Over here I'm using a true mechanical full-25-contacts
DB25 switch for my personal X-cables testing Lab.

_______
|       |        _____
|      A|=XAP1541=====1541-II
|  ___  |        _____
| /  /\B|=XAP1541=====1571
Computer-LPT ===| | / | |                ______
| \___/C|=XAP/XMP1541diag======Lab place
|       |
|      D|=free
|_______|

And that one works wonderful, if it comes to decoupling
all the different setups.
