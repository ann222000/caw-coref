Just picked up a Defender in almost working condition- When I power up
the game, it makes a noise, and then I just get vertical lines on the
screen that change color, but the game never actually starts.  I
pulled the rom board and reseated all the roms, but that did no good.
Could it be the power supply, or another board?  Thanks!

The sound board makes a sound on reset regardless of whether or not
anything else in the cabinet is working.

If your PS voltages are good then it's probably either the CPU or ROM board.

There are a LOT of things that could cause that.  I would start with
checking the voltages at the power supply and make sure they're good.
Just having the +12/+5 etc. lights on doesn't count.  Voltages should
be checked on the CPU board itself.
