The day was coming.

One of the minor companies has been all but folded or absorbed into
ADV.

Geneon, from October 1, will have it's entire catalog sold, marketed,
and distributed through ADV.

They _claim_ they'll be able to continue to license and produce anime,
but I can't see it.  This is all but a merger or an absorption or a
folding.

There's another way to look at this - maybe ADV is becoming a
distribution company instead of an anime translation company.  (What big
shows have ADV picked up lately, anyway?)

Either way, I suppose that's the end of the &quot;25 Geneon DVDs for $100&quot;
sales that Right Stuf has been running occasionally...

So, ADV is replacing Right Stuf as Geneon's customer service
division? I can't see why that should affect anything much,
except for Geneon titles appearing on ADVs VOD channel.

It's hard to think of Geneon as a minor company - since their shows are all
over the cable channels I get.  From the now defunct Anime Unleashed on Tech
TV, to Fuse (Ergo Proxy), AZN (running Last Exile at the moment), Adult Swim
on CN, Encore Action's AniMidnight, etc.  They've probably put more product
in front of the US viewer than any other company.

So, does this mean they'll actually start running Geneon series on Anime
Network? That'd be nice for us viewers, I must say.........

Seems weird, though.........when I first got into the whole vhs scene
way back when, Pioneer seemed ( to me, at least ) like the upper crust
of anime, the quality product........Tenchi Muyo, El Hazard, etc. Up
there with Animiego...........ADV, OTOH, seemed like the scrambling
hustler willing to release ANYthing if it might sell.......

I guess that strategy paid off in the long run, but I still have
occasional Pink Pineapple flashbacks that can be quite disconcerting!

Maybe not.  TRSI just does customer service for Geneon, don't they?  And
there's nothing in the press release about ADV handling that.

You mean, the same way that Bandai Entertainment and Viz was
absorbed into Pioneer/Geneon when Pioneer/Geneon handled the
distribution of *their* titles?

This seems to be a distribution deal, nothing more.  It has
happened many times before, with varying players.  Pioneer
handled distribution for others, earlier.  ADV did and does for
some others.  I believe CPM handled distribution for some other
companies for a while too.

Buena Vista/Disney handles distribution for Studio Ghibli in
Japan.  Ghibli hasn't merged into Disney yet...

Outsorcing distribution is *very* common, in all types of
business, not just video.

If you want to convince us that Geneon USA will fold or be bought
out, you need to show some better evidence than a distribution
deal.

Actually, in this case, it seems David Ricardo is alive and well.  ADV is
shifting to what they do best, and Genon is sticking with what they do best.
Both companies (and, arguably, the consumer) benefit.  Competetive advantage
for the win.

I'm not seeing a lot of Bandai on my shelves.
Quite a lot of Pioneer, much less of Geneon.

Which one?

(There are two Bandais in North America now - Bandai Visual, that
releases and prices anime the way it's released and priced in Japan, and
Bandai Entertainment, that learned the hard way what the local market
will put up with...)

Geneon's larger than Funimation in range and depth of titles.  Moreover,
Geneon Entertainment's sister company in Japan is a developer of anime
whereas Funimation is just a North American distributor.  Funimation is a
great company - starting off with DBZ their quality titles include FMA.
I'm not saying that they are not a major company - I believe they are.
However, if Funimation is a major company, so is Geneon.

Dentsu is an advertising and entertainment giant.  They are not only the
largest ad agency in Japan but are one of the largest in the world with the
same stature as Madison advertising giants.  Geneon is a subsidiary.  The
parent company does not handle Geneon North American advertising.  Whether
or not it was the best decision, Geneon Entertainment USA determined their
core competency was production of anime localized for the North American
English speaking market.  They decided to outsource the logistics of the
marketing and distribution to ADV.

Both ADV and Geneon declined comment for the Anime News Network article.
They might have declined for several reasons - one logical one being that
they are still working out the details.  The notice did state that ADV
would be handling marketing and sales in addition to distribution.
However, that does not mean that Geneon will not provide promotional
materials to assist ADV in that endeavor.

This is a very opinionated and speculative interpretation of a very general
statement:

&quot;ICV2 is reporting that according to a notice sent to retailers, ADV Films
will be handling the marketing, sales, and distribution for Geneon's entire
catalog beginning October 1. The notice mentioned that Geneon will still be
licensing and producing anime for North America, but the way those titles
reach the market will now be handled by ADV Films. ADV Films declined to
comment for this article; Geneon could not be reached for comment.&quot;

These are the inaccuracies in the conclusions you drew from this general
statement:

- Geneon is not a minor company - they are right behind ADV and Viz in
number of titles.  Since you use Anime News Network as a source, you might
want to check their Geneon listings:
http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/company.php?id=1782

- Geneon is neither folding or being absorbed.  They are outsourcing
certain activities.

-  You may not be able to see how Geneon will be able to &quot;continue to
license and produce anime.&quot;  Nevetheless, the notice that went out to
retailers specifically said, &quot;This change will in no way impact the
availability of current or future Geneon titles 'in the pipeline.'&quot;

The last quote came from the source article that you should have referred
to before you started reading in between the lines.  It's available at:

http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/11182.html

These are the concluding two paragraphs that were not included in the Anime
News Network blurb:

&quot;The extensive Geneon catalogue will continue to be available through ADV,
making a formidable combined title roster from the two companies.

&quot;The business impacts at both companies seem positive (although there are
displaced Geneon employees who do not share in the benefits).  Geneon rids
itself of a sales, marketing, and distribution function that is servicing
much lower volume than it did in the days when Geneon was distributing Viz
(Pokemon) and Bandai titles.  ADV gains the economies of scale of servicing
larger volume on a similar expense base.&quot;

Bottom Line:  It sounds like a good business arrangement by two major North
American anime companies.  It looks like the consumer will benefit.  The
only downside would be if you are a Geneon employee of one of the areas
that is to be outsourced.

There are different kinds of advertising and different markets.
(And advertising is different from marketing.)
Just because Dentsu is big in Japan doesn't mean
somebody is not ahead of them in N. America.

ADV already knows how to do things in N. America,
so why not partner with them instead of re-inventing the wheel?
Besides, it'll save them money by ridding a much less-used department.

That's not consistent with what Ledford said in his recent interview.  ADV
has partnered with Sojitsu that will assist in the acquisition and
financing of additional titles.  ADV is very much in the production of
anime localized for the North American market and in the licensing of new
titles:

http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2007-05-30/john-ledford

Moreover, from what I've seen, ADV is currently the most aggressive North
American anime company in terms of how rapidly they are releasing recent
anime productions in North America.

Advertising by catelog may not be in Dentsu's core competencies.  So it may

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The last quote came from the source article that you should have referred
&gt; to before you started reading in between the lines.  It's available at:

&gt; http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/11182.html

&gt; These are the concluding two paragraphs that were not included in the Anime
&gt; News Network blurb:

&gt; &quot;The extensive Geneon catalogue will continue to be available through ADV,
&gt; making a formidable combined title roster from the two companies.

&gt; &quot;The business impacts at both companies seem positive (although there are
&gt; displaced Geneon employees who do not share in the benefits).  Geneon rids
&gt; itself of a sales, marketing, and distribution function that is servicing
&gt; much lower volume than it did in the days when Geneon was distributing Viz
&gt; (Pokemon) and Bandai titles.  ADV gains the economies of scale of servicing
&gt; larger volume on a similar expense base.&quot;
">

Turning things around, Geneon certainly did not &quot;absorb&quot;
Viz nor Bandai when Geneon was distributing their titles.
No difference with ADV.

&gt; &gt; ADV already knows how to do things in N. America,
&gt; &gt; so why not partner with them instead of re-inventing the wheel?

Could you BE any more of an insensitive prick?

Any respect I had left for you--and believe you me, it was VERY little
indeed--just went down the drain.

Thank you.  I was waiting for the official press release.  It certainly
sheds more light on that issue than the excerpt from one paragraph of
speculative report that started this thread.  Geneon and ADV detractors
should take not of comments like:

&quot;ADV Films AND GENEON ANNOUNCE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE - Partnership Yields
Strongest Catalog in Anime Category&quot;

and

&quot;For consumers and retailers, this transition should be seamless. Geneon's
publishing plans will continue unabated, as ADV Films works with
distribution partners to make the transition a smooth one.&quot;

Mata ato de,

I was being serious.  &quot;When a door closes, another window opens.&quot;
With the added business, there's an opportunity for new openings.
He shouldn't wallow too long and ask the company taking over.
He obviously has the experience, in an industry where few have,
and Geneon would surely vouch for him.
In labor, there's no such thing as working for the competitor.
(Actually, in this case, it's a partnership.)

Laters. =)
