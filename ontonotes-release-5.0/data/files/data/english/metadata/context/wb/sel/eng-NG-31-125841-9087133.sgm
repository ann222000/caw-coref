OK, OK, I know, this isn't the right group - but I know there are people
here who know what they are on about - and I'm sure one of them will be
able to diagnose this in about half a second, or at the very least tell
me somewhere I can ask.

I got home late from work (as usual) SWMBO had been watching something
on the tape.

Ate my tea, then went up to make sure Son didn't fry anything while
plugging new hard drives into his computer (what - the cables have to go
the right way round?)

Squeak from downstairs.  She's gone back to the VCR, and it's died.
Mostly.  In the hour since she last used it.

I assumed it was just crud in the heads, so I've given it a wipe over
but to no effect.  The picture looks pretty much like this:

What went wrong, is there any chance of fixing it, and please don't
suggest a PVR!

Thx

is this on all tapes or have you checked the tape in question? Little
catch to right of the flap on the cassette, hold it in and lift the
flap, being careful not to touch the tape, and see if it's been messed
up.

There are still some VHS around anyway, some combi machines and what
not, so it's not the end if your machine is dead.

More than one tape.

I'd go out and buy a PVR/VHS combo with dual freeview decoders, but she
won't hear of it...  Can't honestly say we're that fond of the machine,
it was bought in a hurry when the old one died the day we had a new
lounge carpet fitted, we didn't realise that you have to turn the TV on
to program (1) it.

yeah, it seems so many machines have 'automatic' stuff which they tell
you is an advantage but which you might prefer to do yourself. Out of
curiosity what brand was it? Also out of curiosity did you try using a
fluid of some sort on the heads? ... not water obviously :O) any white

Lots of head switching going on there so I guess that the tape
is running at the wrong speed.  Is the tape being damaged? Is
there any sound?  Is the tape counter counting seconds at the
correct rate?

A good suspect would be failure of the &quot;mode switch&quot;.  Good news
is that a new one is only a couple of quid.  Bad news is that
the switch is probablly sandwiched between the mechanism and
the electronics so it's a complete strip down to replace it.
Uneconomical to repair unless you can DIY.

The cheapest option would be to buy a new one on eBay.

I would say that it looks like one of the loading arms isn't fully engaged,
you didn't say what make and model of VCR it was which would be a help, this
is a common fault on later Panasonic Machines when the teeth strips on
loading arm U.

Panasonic.  As is the TV, and bits of our stereo - including the amp
which is still working fine at more than 25 years old.  In fact, the
only bit of that rack system that has died was the cassette deck.  Old
VCR was also Panasonic, but the PSU went in that years ago.

Last time it went funny I cleaned the heads and it worked fine for...

We're in a 2012 switchover area so not that bothered about the digital
tuner. IAC our signal is too (deleted) to get anything on my son's
freeview thumb stick which works fine elsewhere, so it probably wouldn't
work anyway.  (thinks... must buy that aerial...)

Tape counter running OK, the movement on the picture looks about the
right speed.  I can't honestly tell if the audio is running on the hi-fi
or the edge track.

Would I be right in thinking that it uses 2 heads on the drum in normal
play?  In that case I'd guess one is working and one isn't.

I'm up for a bit of fiddling - what's to lose? but I'll admit to being
more SW that HW, although I can read a logic diagram.  If I had one.

Ah, doubt you'll see a panny vcr again, and the dvd-r/vhs we tried
from them was awful, they seem to have not cared what the vcr bit
sounded like and the picture wasn't much better. The people
complaining of sky+ etc fan noise have it easy when placed beside that
machine, it was awful.

As long as you feel reasonably confident then it shouldn't pose too much
difficulty.
Make sure the VCR is totally isolated from the mains, remove the lead plugs
and sockets and the screws securing the deck (one hidden under the cassette
housing) turn deck upside down and with the arms fully retracted carefully
'unclip' and remove the damaged arm, clip in the new arm and make sure that
all of the alignment marks (holes in the plastic) are correctly aligned
(under a bit of spring pressure) and Bob's your uncle, try and get it right
first time though if you can, otherwise at best you'll have tracking
problems and at worst the possibility of more stripped teeth.

Good luck

Thanks for that.  I couldn't find a service manual anywhere!

I've bought another and I'll try to fix this one in slow time.  The part

which is always on at silly times when she can't possibly watch it.

They're getting hard to get, so having a spare seems a good idea.

Although I've moved on to PVRs I still have a couple of Panasonic triple
speed VCRs which I intend to hang on to.
However having said that (without wishing to bore people to death because I
have already mentioned it in another thread) I've recently purchased a
couple of very cheap £45.00 PVRs from one of the TV shopping channels, and
with Asda wanting £39.00 for a VCR I figured there was no contest (apart
from not being able to transfer programs between machines) with advantages
such as one touch record, 40 hours recording time, picture quality and the
ability to be able to pause and rewind in the middle of a programme.

The problem is usually one of f acceptance and reluctance to get rid
of a library of tapes, I would say.

I also liked, and still like, the idea of being able to record to a
removable media, handy when I want to record something which the
grandkids can watch while they're in bed etc etc, so a dvd recorder
with hard drive is cool.

I'm sure I saw somewhere that the latest panasonic will only record to
the hard disc then will transfer to a dvd if required.... yeah, here
it is. Note it will also rip CDs.

Yes I think we've discussed this in some detail on another thread, where a
I posed the question 'Is there any technical reason why with SD cards
continuity dropping in price and increasing in capacity they can't be
incorporated (using MPEG 4) as a standard De Facto item in PVRs?
Apparently it's quite feasible, but no doubt manufacturers will only be
interested when the market is totally saturated with existing PVR's and then
they'll launch new models with the ability to interchange media cards.

I recently saw (in a Dixons, or whatever they're called now, or a very
similar shop) a little thing with a card round it (I mean a cardboard
display card) saying it could be used like a VCR: it looked very like one of
those multi-card readers you can buy as a PC peripheral, and IIRR was made
by one of the well-known computer peripheral makers (Belkin or one of that
crowd). The display card was pushing it for use to record signals (it didn't
have a tuner) onto memory cards for later playback on these portable
solid-state players; it gave the encoding used, which was either (I think it
had a choice) some variant of MP4, and something else. I _think_ it said
between one and seven hours per gigabyte, but I may not be right on that -
there was definitely the option to trade quality for duration, I don't know
in how may steps.

I was somewhat surprised, having seen absolutely no publicity for it - as
Ivan says, it seems the way things will go before too long; I was also
surprised at the price: the shop droid had to go away and look it up,
suggesting he wasn't selling many of them, but it was only £30 (well, the
usual £29.95 or similar), IIRR; I was quite tempted, though didn't buy it in
the end. Oh, and it had USB connectivity, though I'm not sure what for - I'm
pretty certain it said explicitly it didn't need a PC to work, so maybe that
was just that it could be used _as_ a card reader/writer.

[Please don't ask me anything about it - above is all I can remember.]

Memory cards seems definitely the way to go for camcorders - the tape (or
disc - optical or &quot;hard&quot;) drives being a big factor in battery life, not to
mention complex mechanics, at least for tape; however, the only card-based
ones I've seen so far - and there are quite a few about - only have digital
zoom, and thus aren't IMO &quot;real&quot; camcorders. (I have one; since it has a 3
megapixel or whatever sensor, certainly well above what is necessary for
standard video, I thought digital zoom might actually be a valid thing;
however, there's no way to set the &quot;zoom&quot; to stop at the point at which the
over-pixel gain stops, and since you can't detect this has happened on the
provided viewscreen, it's not much more than a toy, sadly.)

A friend of mine recently purchased a 19 inch? LCD TV from a supermarket and
was surprised to find that although it wasn't mentioned in the specification
it incorporated an SD card slot, which apparently will play MP4 and DIVX
programs that he's recorded on to an SD card.

I've got a small Toshiba 7 inch LCD DVD player with a card slot which also
accepts MP4 and  DIVX and produces quite good quality images from a 2 GB SD
card ..  Like you I just can't understand why it's a feature which appears
to be so played down, almost like a dirty little secret,  instead of being
pushed for all it's worth, as I agree with you 'it seems definitely the way
to go' as more acceptance can only drive card prices down and capacity up.

My Panny dvd has an SD slot but they seem limited in what you can do,
at least til this big machine comes out. I'll be interested to see
what you can do with with input/output format, though I doubt it will

Interesting question - but compare volume: 200G on SD cards (I think SD is
probably the best compromise between compactness and ruggedness; YMMV,
especially if you've bought a camera that takes something else!), versus
200G on a HDD. Similar volume taken, I suspect. (Of course, HDs will get
bigger [in capacity], but so will memory cards.) The cards are also much
more &quot;lendable&quot;, of course - the modern equivalent of lending a mate a tape
of something.

I was going to say more reliable, too, since they don't have any moving
parts to wear (or seize from lack of use if unused for a while). But, I'm
not sure what the technology _is_ for &quot;flash&quot; cards - I know it was
basically stored charge for the old EPROMs and EEPROMs, but since flash
memory is fundamentally different in some way, is it more or less reliable?
(ISTR seeing about 5 or 10 years being quoted as the maximum you _should_
rely on an EPROM lasting, though I'm sure that was somewhat finger in the
air based on accelerated tests [which is all they _could_ do]; I'm aware of
quite a few EPROM-based things that are still working.)

So interesting question, which is more likely not to work after some time,
an HDD or a flash card (of some sort)?

I still think the splittability of the cards makes them preferable for
day-to-day use (not to mention the lower power consumption), as well as just
the &quot;fun&quot; of having a usable amount of video stored in something the size of
a postage stamp.

Oh yes, there are some great advantages with the cards. how open to
heat/magnetic damage etc are they though? Most of my cards stay in a
drawer or in camera so they don't really come into contact with
anything which I assume could cause damage.

Kingston reckon that Flash is good for 10,000 write cycles, which they
point out is once per day for 27 years.  As it's stored charge based, it
will have a limited storage life though, so I wouldn't use it for
archive.  Fine for a VCR though.

Hard discs?  I was running an ST506 last weekend which I think dates
back to 1984 and is running fine.  Though I admit it hasn't *run* for
the whole 23 years, and it has been completely re-written.  Certainly
server discs wear out in just a few years.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure what the technology _is_ for &quot;flash&quot; cards - I know it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; basically stored charge for the old EPROMs and EEPROMs, but since flash
&gt;&gt;&gt; memory is fundamentally different in some way, is it more or less
&gt;&gt;&gt; reliable? (ISTR seeing about 5 or 10 years being quoted as the maximum
&gt;&gt;&gt; you _should_ rely on an EPROM lasting, though I'm sure that was somewhat
&gt;&gt;&gt; finger in the air based on accelerated tests [which is all they _could_
&gt;&gt;&gt; do]; I'm aware of quite a few EPROM-based things that are still
&gt;&gt;&gt; working.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; So interesting question, which is more likely not to work after some
&gt;&gt;&gt; time, an HDD or a flash card (of some sort)?

&gt;&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;

&gt;&gt; Kingston reckon that Flash is good for 10,000 write cycles, which they

I'm not going to dispute that.  Magnetic media is pretty stable,
although print-through can be a problem.  We in the digital world like
to re-record things every so often - often to a new media type, because
the old one is obsolete - and this gets around the problem of gradual
decay of the data.  This isn't an option with Analogue.

Flash OTOH is a charge storage based medium and must have a finite
storage life.

I think in 100 years time pre-stamped DVDs would be readable - if you
could find a drive to do it, and I don't think you will.

You might remember the problems over the &quot;new Domesday project&quot; back in
the '80s.  We damn near lost the lot because it was done on video disc
and BBC Master 8-bit computers.

http://www.si.umich.edu/CAMILEON/domesday/domesday.html

We can read the original Domesday book, because it's on paper - no
special tools required.  I don't know about US Civil War - I thought
that was in the 1860s, and the Lumières didn't show movies until 1895 -
but I've seen WW1 films.  The equipment to read these is pretty simple,
it's a sequence of stills each of which can be &quot;read&quot; by a human eye.

78 RPM records are a bit hard - when all you need is a pin and a
diaphragm.  8-track cassettes?  When did *you* last see one?  What are
the chances that you'll be able to read VHS in 10 years?

DVD is going to die with Hi Def TV, whether its HD-DVD or Blu-Ray that
takes over I can't say.  The next gen players after that probably won't
read DVDs.  In fact, they may not use exchangeable media at all.

I don't think a drive will be necessary. All that is needed is a device
that scans the disc - think of a suitable generic scientific
scanning/imaging device: a tunneling electron microscope, perhaps, or a
specialised laser-based high-resolution flatbed scanner, or something
similar - and software that reads the bits off the resulting image,
emulating the spiral tracking / decoding / error correction of a real
CD/DVD/BluRay drive. Such data recovery is certainly doable even long
after all original drives have ceased working.

I have my doubts.  I'm really not up on the blue laser formats (HD-DVD
and Blu-Ray), though I imagine the same problems appear as on the red
ones, and that's why the colour (or more importantly, wavelength) of the
laser appears.

The &quot;spot&quot; from the laser on the red laser discs, owing to diffraction
isn't a spot.  It's a spot with a series of circles around it of
progressively less brightness.  The disc is carefully designed so that
there's a dark ring lined up with the next track over.  This means the
reader isn't confused by cross-talk from the next track.  Blue laser
discs have smaller pits and finer track pitch to get the data density
up.  You physically *cannot* read them with a red laser.

The player keeps its laser along the track as it is read, and it must
follow pretty exactly to get the data off.

You'd have to switch to some really short wavelength to be able to
ignore diffraction, and use a flatbed.  Fancy an X-Ray laser to read
your disc?  And IAC, would it go through the polycarbonate layers?  Then
you need to be able to focus on both layers of the disc.

Then lets ignore that, and assume you can scan the disc in.  You now
have an image of the disc.   The spec. which describes the innards of a
DVD is several inches thick.  You'll have to follow that spec. to be
able to translate the data.

This is orders of magnitude harder than reading a WW1 newsreel.

To put together an analogy:

There are replica Fokker Triplanes flying.  They are simple enough that
a good engineer can build one, but they were too fragile to really survive.

There are a couple of real Lancasters, and any number of Spits, Hurris,
Mustangs, 109s etc. flying around.  Not repros, but real ones.  They are
at that happy stage that any good engineer can understand and fix them,
yet strong enough to survive.

There's one (ONE!) Vulcan Bomber being brought back into the air.  It's
a bit harder, because the technology is more complicated.

There is no real prospect of Concorde ever flying again.  Its
computerised control systems rely on technology that is hard to
replicate, but still obsolete and out of production.

It's all based on standard MPEG-2 program streams, with some extra bits
thrown in (menu/navigation logic, subtitles.) Even if all copies of the
official DVD specifications (and all software-based DVD player
implementations and authoring programs) would suddenly vanish - which is
an unlikely event - basic MPEG-2 knowledge would be enough for
recovering and viewing the actual video and audio streams.

With MPEG-2 being an ISO standard (there are countless copies of the
standard itself circulating all over the world as well as open-sourced
software encoders and decoders) I think if _that_ knowledge is, at some
point, lost, the humankind is likely to be either extinct or in a deep
enough trouble that being able to recover some video clips from the past
doesn't really matter any longer...

Of course you would need to use a wavelength that's suitable for reading
the data in the first place - that goes without saying.

I'm not saying it's a walk in a park, I'm just saying that if needed,
imaging the old discs is likely to be doable with some sort of
(generic-purpose, scientific, expensive) scanning/imaging device,
without actually needing to reconstruct the original drive mechanics.

It might be a problem for some random guy, but probably wouldn't be much
of a problem for these guys...

&lt; http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6991893.stm &gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If that's what is needed for getting at the data-to-be-recovered, and
there's already a suitable device for doing such scans, why not?
High-precision scientific imaging and software-based decoding is
probably easier and cheaper way than recreating an actual CD/DVD/Bluray
drive from scratch.

Perhaps you'd need to peel/sand the unnecessary layers off. (But I think

Of course, but researchers are now pulling off technical stunts that
would have been deemed unimaginable 10 years ago (just see the article
linked to the above), and I can't imagine that getting to scan a
high-resolution image of the pit/land structure of a DVD would even be a
particularly hard problem.

They say &quot;The LT cannot differentiate between an audio signal or dirt on the
record. So your records must be really, really clean.&quot; Same applies to a
record played with a needle, doesn't it - that's why records suffer terribly
from clicks and pops.

I remember seeing - maybe on Tomorrow's World - that a similar system had
been used to play Baird's early video recordings (on 78 rpm records, IIRC)
because they were in a much too delicate state to be played with a needle as
Baird had originally intended.
