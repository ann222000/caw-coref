&gt;&gt; Isee you live at 30 Montgomery Place, apt#3 Brooklyn, NY 11215. That's

&gt;&gt; I can make that drug bust back in San Francisco seem

&gt;&gt; you. ;)

&gt;&gt; Are your knees acting up again, perhaps because of the
&gt;&gt; fear I induced in you? Maybe it's time to go back on the

&gt;&gt; You fuck with the bull, you get the horns, Dougie.
&gt;&gt; Remember that.

&gt;&gt; Now submit and be assimilated by the Collective.

&gt;Rob, It is not a good idea to post personal information about people.
&gt;I know you were provoked and certain people are jealous of your
&gt;talents. I never have been jealous of people's success. I always try
&gt;to enjoy it when friends are successful. For example I know a couple
&gt;with some very expensive paintings, some of them are probably
&gt;priceless. I will never forget the night they invited just my wife and
&gt;I over and we spent a great evening talking about each painting.
&gt;Mainly I listened because I don't own any priceless artwork and my
&gt;knowledge of fine art is limited. I honestly feel that in a way I own
&gt;those paintings because the &quot;owners&quot; of the paintings took the time to
&gt;share their experience and history of each painting with my wife and
&gt;I. If someone were to steal those paintings they would be stealing
&gt;from me. When I visit them I always make it a point to look at the
&gt;paintings they have displayed on the wall and I remember how wonderful
&gt;it was when they &quot;made me an owner&quot; of those fine works. It is the
&gt;same way with your success. I feel that in a way I own part of your
&gt;success because you said I encouraged you. Therefore, I am part owner
&gt;of your success. In a way I helped you achieve your success. I admit
&gt;that I only offered you an encouraging word but, I contributed and
&gt;that makes me proud. I always make it a point to examine how I can
&gt;lend a hand to help somebody down the road. Frankly, I knew
&gt;Neurodancers home address for some time. I just never made it a point
&gt;to post it because if something bad were to happen to him you could
&gt;get blamed. You don't want that hassle. Besides, Neurodance is pushing
&gt;50 and he is a hopeless junky. I guess I should feel sad for him. How
&gt;can we encourage Neurodancer to get help? Just a thought.
">

Eddy, I have thought about your words. As you know, I feel that you
are a valuble contributor to this War On Alt.Drugs.Hard and the sick
mindset that permeates the atmosphere here.

I will give Neurodancer a chance to redeem himself to me. I'm still
very upset that he would try to get me in potential trouble with
A&amp;E and the general media with HATE-FILLED LIES.

However, I will call off the dogs of war if he admits his mistake
and apologizes to *me* personally. This apology must be posted
in rec.sport.pro-wrestling, alt.drugs.hard, rec.sport.disc, and
rec.music.gdead. Once this has occured I can make this trouble
around him all go away. That's all he has to do, admit his wrongs
and repent.

You know, if he does do that he will become one step closer to
being a whole human being, and subsequently just might stop
using drugs forever.

Eddy, Neurodancer and alt.drugs.hard should thank you. You
may have just saved somebody's life tonight. You are truly a good
fellow!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have to contact my sources in New York to find out more
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; about you, I really don't. Are you working in Astoria or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the Flatlands area?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Isee you live at 30 Montgomery Place, apt#3 Brooklyn, NY 11215. That's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a nice apartment you got there. You live off 8th Ave? I know where
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that is. That's Park Slope terrority. $2000 a month for rent? Whew.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hey, do you suppose that your landlord Mr. Beyger would like to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; know one of his tenants is a heavy drug user who gives out
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; unsolicited advice on how to get high to various youths
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in a newsgroup?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I can make that drug bust back in San Francisco seem
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like child's play if you continue on your attempts to libel
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and slander my good name, Dougie. I think I'll be paying
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more attention to rec.sport.disc too, Dougie. Just for
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you. ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Are your knees acting up again, perhaps because of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; fear I induced in you? Maybe it's time to go back on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; opiates.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You fuck with the bull, you get the horns, Dougie.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Remember that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Now submit and be assimilated by the Collective.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Rob, It is not a good idea to post personal information about people.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I know you were provoked and certain people are jealous of your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;talents. I never have been jealous of people's success. I always try
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to enjoy it when friends are successful. For example I know a couple
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with some very expensive paintings, some of them are probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;priceless. I will never forget the night they invited just my wife and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I over and we spent a great evening talking about each painting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Mainly I listened because I don't own any priceless artwork and my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;knowledge of fine art is limited. I honestly feel that in a way I own
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;those paintings because the &quot;owners&quot; of the paintings took the time to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;share their experience and history of each painting with my wife and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I. If someone were to steal those paintings they would be stealing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from me. When I visit them I always make it a point to look at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;paintings they have displayed on the wall and I remember how wonderful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it was when they &quot;made me an owner&quot; of those fine works. It is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;same way with your success. I feel that in a way I own part of your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;success because you said I encouraged you. Therefore, I am part owner
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of your success. In a way I helped you achieve your success. I admit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that I only offered you an encouraging word but, I contributed and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that makes me proud. I always make it a point to examine how I can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lend a hand to help somebody down the road. Frankly, I knew
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Neurodancers home address for some time. I just never made it a point
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to post it because if something bad were to happen to him you could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;get blamed. You don't want that hassle. Besides, Neurodance is pushing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;50 and he is a hopeless junky. I guess I should feel sad for him. How
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;can we encourage Neurodancer to get help? Just a thought.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Eddy, I have thought about your words. As you know, I feel that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; are a valuble contributor to this War On Alt.Drugs.Hard and the sick
&gt; &gt; &gt; mindset that permeates the atmosphere here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I will give Neurodancer a chance to redeem himself to me. I'm still
&gt; &gt; &gt; very upset that he would try to get me in potential trouble with
&gt; &gt; &gt; A&amp;E and the general media with HATE-FILLED LIES.

&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I will call off the dogs of war if he admits his mistake
&gt; &gt; &gt; and apologizes to *me* personally. This apology must be posted
&gt; &gt; &gt; in rec.sport.pro-wrestling, alt.drugs.hard, rec.sport.disc, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; rec.music.gdead. Once this has occured I can make this trouble
&gt; &gt; &gt; around him all go away. That's all he has to do, admit his wrongs
&gt; &gt; &gt; and repent.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You know, if he does do that he will become one step closer to
&gt; &gt; &gt; being a whole human being, and subsequently just might stop
&gt; &gt; &gt; using drugs forever.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Eddy, Neurodancer and alt.drugs.hard should thank you. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; may have just saved somebody's life tonight. You are truly a good
&gt; &gt; &gt; fellow!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Rob, It is not a good idea to post personal information about people.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I know you were provoked and certain people are jealous of your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;talents. I never have been jealous of people's success. I always try
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to enjoy it when friends are successful. For example I know a couple
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with some very expensive paintings, some of them are probably
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;priceless. I will never forget the night they invited just my wife and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I over and we spent a great evening talking about each painting.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Mainly I listened because I don't own any priceless artwork and my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;knowledge of fine art is limited. I honestly feel that in a way I own
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;those paintings because the &quot;owners&quot; of the paintings took the time to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;share their experience and history of each painting with my wife and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I. If someone were to steal those paintings they would be stealing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from me. When I visit them I always make it a point to look at the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;paintings they have displayed on the wall and I remember how wonderful
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it was when they &quot;made me an owner&quot; of those fine works. It is the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;same way with your success. I feel that in a way I own part of your
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;success because you said I encouraged you. Therefore, I am part owner
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of your success. In a way I helped you achieve your success. I admit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that I only offered you an encouraging word but, I contributed and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that makes me proud. I always make it a point to examine how I can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lend a hand to help somebody down the road. Frankly, I knew
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Neurodancers home address for some time. I just never made it a point
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to post it because if something bad were to happen to him you could
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;get blamed. You don't want that hassle. Besides, Neurodance is pushing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;50 and he is a hopeless junky. I guess I should feel sad for him. How
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;can we encourage Neurodancer to get help? Just a thought.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Eddy, I have thought about your words. As you know, I feel that you
&gt; &gt; &gt; are a valuble contributor to this War On Alt.Drugs.Hard and the sick
&gt; &gt; &gt; mindset that permeates the atmosphere here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I will give Neurodancer a chance to redeem himself to me. I'm still
&gt; &gt; &gt; very upset that he would try to get me in potential trouble with
&gt; &gt; &gt; A&amp;E and the general media with HATE-FILLED LIES.

&gt; &gt; &gt; However, I will call off the dogs of war if he admits his mistake
&gt; &gt; &gt; and apologizes to *me* personally. This apology must be posted
&gt; &gt; &gt; in rec.sport.pro-wrestling, alt.drugs.hard, rec.sport.disc, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; rec.music.gdead. Once this has occured I can make this trouble
&gt; &gt; &gt; around him all go away. That's all he has to do, admit his wrongs
&gt; &gt; &gt; and repent.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You know, if he does do that he will become one step closer to
&gt; &gt; &gt; being a whole human being, and subsequently just might stop
&gt; &gt; &gt; using drugs forever.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Eddy, Neurodancer and alt.drugs.hard should thank you. You
&gt; &gt; &gt; may have just saved somebody's life tonight. You are truly a good
&gt; &gt; &gt; fellow!

&gt; &gt; people. I wish Neurodance would get off of the dope. When you hit your

&gt; &gt; gets sober.

I don't like posting anybody's personal information. I knew who/where
ND lives (actually I threw it away). So what, I would never post about
it. People send me emails all of the time. Most of the time I have
them automatically deleted. In fact I have a recieved lots of
information about people through email. I always throw the email away.
I don't want to know anyone's personal information. It serves me no
purpose. I am not interested in personal information. That is why I
asked Rob to re-consider going after ND. Frankly, ND posted a lot of
trashy things about Rob and I guess he got angry. I am glad that ND re-
canted and things can get back to normal.

&gt;&gt;of your success. In a way I helped you achieve your success. I admit
&gt;&gt;that I only offered you an encouraging word but, I contributed and
&gt;&gt;that makes me proud. I always make it a point to examine how I can
&gt;&gt;lend a hand to help somebody down the road. Frankly, I knew
&gt;&gt;Neurodancers home address for some time. I just never made it a point
&gt;&gt;to post it because if something bad were to happen to him you could
&gt;&gt;get blamed. You don't want that hassle. Besides, Neurodance is pushing
&gt;&gt;50 and he is a hopeless junky. I guess I should feel sad for him. How
&gt;&gt;can we encourage Neurodancer to get help? Just a thought.

&gt; Eddy, I have thought about your words. As you know, I feel that you
&gt; are a valuble contributor to this War On Alt.Drugs.Hard and the sick
&gt; mindset that permeates the atmosphere here.

&gt; I will give Neurodancer a chance to redeem himself to me. I'm still
&gt; very upset that he would try to get me in potential trouble with
&gt; A&amp;E and the general media with HATE-FILLED LIES.

&gt; However, I will call off the dogs of war if he admits his mistake
&gt; and apologizes to *me* personally. This apology must be posted
&gt; in rec.sport.pro-wrestling, alt.drugs.hard, rec.sport.disc, and
&gt; rec.music.gdead. Once this has occured I can make this trouble
&gt; around him all go away. That's all he has to do, admit his wrongs
&gt; and repent.

&gt; You know, if he does do that he will become one step closer to
&gt; being a whole human being, and subsequently just might stop
&gt; using drugs forever.

&gt; Eddy, Neurodancer and alt.drugs.hard should thank you. You
&gt; may have just saved somebody's life tonight. You are truly a good
&gt; fellow!

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Rob, It is not a good idea to post personal information about people.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I know you were provoked and certain people are jealous of your
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;talents. I never have been jealous of people's success. I always try
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to enjoy it when friends are successful. For example I know a couple
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with some very expensive paintings, some of them are probably
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;priceless. I will never forget the night they invited just my wife and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I over and we spent a great evening talking about each painting.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Mainly I listened because I don't own any priceless artwork and my
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;knowledge of fine art is limited. I honestly feel that in a way I own
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;those paintings because the &quot;owners&quot; of the paintings took the time to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;share their experience and history of each painting with my wife and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I. If someone were to steal those paintings they would be stealing
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from me. When I visit them I always make it a point to look at the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;paintings they have displayed on the wall and I remember how wonderful
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it was when they &quot;made me an owner&quot; of those fine works. It is the

&gt;&gt; &gt;     ND does do that much dope at all You don't know this a lot of us
&gt;&gt; &gt; on ADH know each other in real life I have knoed some posters on adh

&gt;&gt; I don't like posting anybody's personal information. I knew who/where
&gt;&gt; ND lives (actually I threw it away). So what, I would never post about
&gt;&gt; it. People send me emails all of the time. Most of the time I have
&gt;&gt; them automatically deleted. In fact I have a recieved lots of
&gt;&gt; information about people through email. I always throw the email away.
&gt;&gt; I don't want to know anyone's personal information. It serves me no
&gt;&gt; purpose. I am not interested in personal information. That is why I
&gt;&gt; asked Rob to re-consider going after ND. Frankly, ND posted a lot of
&gt;&gt; trashy things about Rob and I guess he got angry. I am glad that ND re-
&gt;&gt; canted and things can get back to normal.- Hide quoted text -

&gt;&gt; - Show quoted text -

&gt;I'll try getting through to you on this issue one time:  It doesn't
&gt;matter if ND recanted (he was under duress), and things can NEVER &quot;get
&gt;back to normal&quot; for him.  You can't put the toothpaste back in the
&gt;tube!  RC cannot &quot;undo&quot; the posting of ND's personal information.
&gt;It's out there.  Forever.  Do you understand that?

&gt;Outing is serious business.  RC did it most frivilously.  For that
&gt;reason alone, RC will never be a human being, in my book -- he's a
&gt;rabid dog, a danger to himself and others.
">

Let me try to get through to you on THIS issue one time:

Neurodancer threatened *me* by claiming to mail A&amp;E and
its parent company supposed racist and homophobic posts
by me (which were edited rather sloppily to frame me). If
anyone read the original posts that would see that I *OPPOSE*
such stances. This man could've gotten me SUED by these
companies if they thought for a second that I was guilty of
these offenses and therefore too risky to air my episode on
general airwaves. They would've sued me to recoup the
costs of production, and I don't have that kinda money
laying around. Plus I would've been branded some kind of
white supremacist for life in the media, which would've been
slightly odd because I'm mixed but whatever. I had NO
choice but to do what I did. And what I did didn't require
more than half a brain and a couple years experience with
dealing with the Internet. All that info I got was from his
OWN FUCKING WORDS. IT'S GOOGLE, BITCH!!!

And not only that, but this guy &quot;outed&quot; someone in this
group last year, who stopped posting after that and
in fact DIED the following year. Yet none of you morons
shed a tear or expressed any outrage over that issue,
and many of you WERE THERE when it happened.

INCLUDING YOU, BEN CULTURE. You just sat there and smiled
as he ruined that man's life and probably was partially responsible
for his subsequent death.

I guess it's cool if it's someone who you don't agree with.

Rob Cypher didn't screw Neurodancer. Neurodancer
screwed Neurodancer.

Now shut the fuck up and recognize, you drama queen.

&gt; &gt;I'll try getting through to you on this issue one time:  It doesn't
&gt; &gt;matter if ND recanted (he was under duress), and things can NEVER &quot;get
&gt; &gt;back to normal&quot; for him.  You can't put the toothpaste back in the
&gt; &gt;tube!  RC cannot &quot;undo&quot; the posting of ND's personal information.
&gt; &gt;It's out there.  Forever.  Do you understand that?

&gt; &gt;Outing is serious business.  RC did it most frivilously.  For that
&gt; &gt;reason alone, RC will never be a human being, in my book -- he's a
&gt; &gt;rabid dog, a danger to himself and others.

&gt; Let me try to get through to you on THIS issue one time:

&gt; Neurodancer threatened *me* by claiming to mail A&amp;E and
&gt; its parent company supposed racist and homophobic posts
&gt; by me (which were edited rather sloppily to frame me). If
&gt; anyone read the original posts that would see that I *OPPOSE*
&gt; such stances. This man could've gotten me SUED by these
&gt; companies if they thought for a second that I was guilty of
&gt; these offenses and therefore too risky to air my episode on
&gt; general airwaves. They would've sued me to recoup the
&gt; costs of production, and I don't have that kinda money
&gt; laying around. Plus I would've been branded some kind of
&gt; white supremacist for life in the media, which would've been
&gt; slightly odd because I'm mixed but whatever. I had NO
&gt; choice but to do what I did. And what I did didn't require
&gt; more than half a brain and a couple years experience with
&gt; dealing with the Internet. All that info I got was from his
&gt; OWN FUCKING WORDS. IT'S GOOGLE, BITCH!!!

&gt; And not only that, but this guy &quot;outed&quot; someone in this
&gt; group last year, who stopped posting after that and
&gt; in fact DIED the following year. Yet none of you morons
&gt; shed a tear or expressed any outrage over that issue,
&gt; and many of you WERE THERE when it happened.

&gt; INCLUDING YOU, BEN CULTURE. You just sat there and smiled
&gt; as he ruined that man's life and probably was partially responsible
&gt; for his subsequent death.

&gt; I guess it's cool if it's someone who you don't agree with.

&gt; Rob Cypher didn't screw Neurodancer. Neurodancer
&gt; screwed Neurodancer.

&gt; Now shut the fuck up and recognize, you drama queen.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Isee you live at 30 Montgomery Place, apt#3 Brooklyn, NY 11215. That's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a nice apartment you got there. You live off 8th Ave? I know where
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that is. That's Park Slope terrority. $2000 a month for rent? Whew.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Hey, do you suppose that your landlord Mr. Beyger would like to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; know one of his tenants is a heavy drug user who gives out
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; unsolicited advice on how to get high to various youths
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in a newsgroup?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I can make that drug bust back in San Francisco seem
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like child's play if you continue on your attempts to libel
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and slander my good name, Dougie. I think I'll be paying
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more attention to rec.sport.disc too, Dougie. Just for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you. ;)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Are your knees acting up again, perhaps because of the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; fear I induced in you? Maybe it's time to go back on the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; opiates.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You fuck with the bull, you get the horns, Dougie.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; robcypher.livejournal.com

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Rob, It is not a good idea to post personal information about people.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I know you were provoked and certain people are jealous of your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;talents. I never have been jealous of people's success. I always try
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to enjoy it when friends are successful. For example I know a couple
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with some very expensive paintings, some of them are probably
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;priceless. I will never forget the night they invited just my wife and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I over and we spent a great evening talking about each painting.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Mainly I listened because I don't own any priceless artwork and my
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;knowledge of fine art is limited. I honestly feel that in a way I own
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;those paintings because the &quot;owners&quot; of the paintings took the time to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;share their experience and history of each painting with my wife and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I. If someone were to steal those paintings they would be stealing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;from me. When I visit them I always make it a point to look at the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;paintings they have displayed on the wall and I remember how wonderful
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it was when they &quot;made me an owner&quot; of those fine works. It is the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;same way with your success. I feel that in a way I own part of your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;success because you said I encouraged you. Therefore, I am part owner
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of your success. In a way I helped you achieve your success. I admit
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that I only offered you an encouraging word but, I contributed and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that makes me proud. I always make it a point to examine how I can
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;lend a hand to help somebody down the road. Frankly, I knew
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Neurodancers home address for some time. I just never made it a point
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to post it because if something bad were to happen to him you could
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;get blamed. You don't want that hassle. Besides, Neurodance is pushing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;50 and he is a hopeless junky. I guess I should feel sad for him. How
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;can we encourage Neurodancer to get help? Just a thought.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eddy, I have thought about your words. As you know, I feel that you
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are a valuble contributor to this War On Alt.Drugs.Hard and the sick
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mindset that permeates the atmosphere here.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will give Neurodancer a chance to redeem himself to me. I'm still
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very upset that he would try to get me in potential trouble with
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A&amp;E and the general media with HATE-FILLED LIES.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, I will call off the dogs of war if he admits his mistake
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and apologizes to *me* personally. This apology must be posted
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in rec.sport.pro-wrestling, alt.drugs.hard, rec.sport.disc, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rec.music.gdead. Once this has occured I can make this trouble
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around him all go away. That's all he has to do, admit his wrongs
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and repent.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You know, if he does do that he will become one step closer to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being a whole human being, and subsequently just might stop
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using drugs forever.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eddy, Neurodancer and alt.drugs.hard should thank you. You
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may have just saved somebody's life tonight. You are truly a good
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fellow!

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't like posting anybody's personal information. I knew who/where

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; them automatically deleted. In fact I have a recieved lots of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; information about people through email. I always throw the email away.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't want to know anyone's personal information. It serves me no

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; asked Rob to re-consider going after ND. Frankly, ND posted a lot of

&gt;&gt; &gt;fantasy?  Do you think they're interested in your petty Usenet wars?
&gt;&gt; &gt;Like FUCK they are, my friend!  Your &quot;Rob Cypher&quot; persona is nothing
&gt;&gt; &gt;but a liability, an embarassment.  A media corporation would rather
&gt;&gt; &gt;lose *millions* than risk embarassment.

&gt;&gt; &gt;How do you know people aren't *already* e-mailing your posts to A&amp;E
&gt;&gt; &gt;producers?  Like you said, it's Google, bitch.  Very, very easy to
&gt;&gt; &gt;identify and contact the relevant producers.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Don't you think it might already be too late -- and all your OWN
&gt;&gt; &gt;fault?

&gt;&gt; Here's the ironic part...are you ready for this, Benji?

&gt;&gt; MY POSTS AND HOMEPAGE WERE THE REASON THEY WERE
&gt;&gt; ATTRACTED TO ME IN THE FIRST PLACE.

&gt;&gt; When my mom submitted me for the program, she included a link
&gt;&gt; to my webpage AND mentioned my Usenet activities. They were
&gt;&gt; so fascinated by what they saw...THAT WAS WHY THEY PICKED
&gt;&gt; ME TO BE FILMED FOR THE SHOW. THAT WAS THE ICING ON THEIR
&gt;&gt; CAKE. They couldn't believe that someone who was heavily addicted
&gt;&gt; to DXM and a former coke/heroin junkie had such...I'm not sure what
&gt;&gt; they thought on that point, actually; I guess they were impressed by
&gt;&gt; my penetrating insight into the mind of man. They *filmed* me making
&gt;&gt; posts to Usenet via a public cafe and the library AND asked me
&gt;&gt; questions about various aspects of what I did online, although I'm
&gt;&gt; not sure how much of that will actually get on the program,
&gt;&gt; considering they have to condense five days of filming into an
&gt;&gt; hour-long program.

&gt;&gt; That racism bullshit that ND tried to pull would've fucked that all
&gt;&gt; up, Ben. Consider the case of Dog. They didn't make a peep when
&gt;&gt; all those rumors of current crack use and supposed affairs with
&gt;&gt; one stepdaughter and the incident where a drug dealer fucked
&gt;&gt; his other stepdaughter in lieu of what he owed...but as soon as
&gt;&gt; he was outed as a racist his whole media career went down the
&gt;&gt; drain. There's nothing more the mainstream media despises than
&gt;&gt; a racist.

&gt;&gt; Although I have doubts what ND would've tried would have worked,
&gt;&gt; considering that he tried to get me pegged for calling people
&gt;&gt; &quot;nigger&quot; (a lie) even though I'm black and some other things that
&gt;&gt; will obviously contradict the picture he tried to paint when my
&gt;&gt; show airs (no spoilers!) the mere fact he thought he COULD try
&gt;&gt; to destroy my life (probably because he already did it to another
&gt;&gt; innocent man last year) was what turned this situation nuclear,
&gt;&gt; at least from your perspective.

&gt;&gt; When you pull a gun on a man, don't be surprised when you
&gt;&gt; end up getting shot.

&gt;&gt; So keep thinking A&amp;E isn't aware of my Usenet posts. And I'm
&gt;&gt; surprised you could be so naive about how the media works;
&gt;&gt; don't you know this is the same channel that airs a (popular)
&gt;&gt; reality show about a gangster's moll and her ne'er-do-well kids?

&gt;&gt; Stop shooting that shit, Ben. It's clouding your eyes.
&gt;&gt; --
&gt;&gt; robcypher.livejournal.com

&gt;Ah, but Rob -- You're sober now.  Now they want you to STOP acting
&gt;crazy.
">

I'm not crazy. How could a crazy man do what I did? There's nothing
crazy about me at all.

You guys are the crazy ones, doing hard drugs and bragging about it.
A&amp;E will think I did society a favor by shutting down this forum and
forcing everyone here into sobriety. To them, it's almost no different
from shutting down a nest of pedophiles; for, to them, I am stopping
a spread of pure, concentrated evil.

Think of it from that perspective. You know, the average, non
hard drug using one. The one that votes and is scared of your
average junkie.

And then you will see I am not insane at all. Not one bit.

&gt;&gt;&gt;MY POSTS AND HOMEPAGE WERE THE REASON THEY WERE
&gt;&gt;&gt;ATTRACTED TO ME IN THE FIRST PLACE.

&gt;&gt;&gt;When my mom submitted me for the program, she included a link
&gt;&gt;&gt;to my webpage AND mentioned my Usenet activities. They were
&gt;&gt;&gt;so fascinated by what they saw...THAT WAS WHY THEY PICKED
&gt;&gt;&gt;ME TO BE FILMED FOR THE SHOW. THAT WAS THE ICING ON THEIR
&gt;&gt;&gt;CAKE. They couldn't believe that someone who was heavily addicted
&gt;&gt;&gt;to DXM and a former coke/heroin junkie had such...I'm not sure what
&gt;&gt;&gt;they thought on that point, actually; I guess they were impressed by
&gt;&gt;&gt;my penetrating insight into the mind of man. They *filmed* me making
&gt;&gt;&gt;posts to Usenet via a public cafe and the library AND asked me
&gt;&gt;&gt;questions about various aspects of what I did online, although I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;not sure how much of that will actually get on the program,
&gt;&gt;&gt;considering they have to condense five days of filming into an
&gt;&gt;&gt;hour-long program.

&gt;&gt;&gt;That racism bullshit that ND tried to pull would've fucked that all
&gt;&gt;&gt;up, Ben. Consider the case of Dog. They didn't make a peep when
&gt;&gt;&gt;all those rumors of current crack use and supposed affairs with
&gt;&gt;&gt;one stepdaughter and the incident where a drug dealer fucked
&gt;&gt;&gt;his other stepdaughter in lieu of what he owed...but as soon as
&gt;&gt;&gt;he was outed as a racist his whole media career went down the
&gt;&gt;&gt;drain. There's nothing more the mainstream media despises than
&gt;&gt;&gt;a racist.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Although I have doubts what ND would've tried would have worked,
&gt;&gt;&gt;considering that he tried to get me pegged for calling people
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;nigger&quot; (a lie) even though I'm black and some other things that
&gt;&gt;&gt;will obviously contradict the picture he tried to paint when my
&gt;&gt;&gt;show airs (no spoilers!) the mere fact he thought he COULD try
&gt;&gt;&gt;to destroy my life (probably because he already did it to another
&gt;&gt;&gt;innocent man last year) was what turned this situation nuclear,
&gt;&gt;&gt;at least from your perspective.

&gt;&gt;&gt;When you pull a gun on a man, don't be surprised when you
&gt;&gt;&gt;end up getting shot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So keep thinking A&amp;E isn't aware of my Usenet posts. And I'm
&gt;&gt;&gt;surprised you could be so naive about how the media works;
&gt;&gt;&gt;don't you know this is the same channel that airs a (popular)
&gt;&gt;&gt;reality show about a gangster's moll and her ne'er-do-well kids?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Stop shooting that shit, Ben. It's clouding your eyes.

&gt;&gt;Ah, but Rob -- You're sober now.  Now they want you to STOP acting
&gt;&gt;crazy.

&gt; I'm not crazy. How could a crazy man do what I did? There's nothing
&gt; crazy about me at all.

&gt; You guys are the crazy ones, doing hard drugs and bragging about it.
&gt; A&amp;E will think I did society a favor by shutting down this forum and
&gt; forcing everyone here into sobriety. To them, it's almost no different
&gt; from shutting down a nest of pedophiles; for, to them, I am stopping
&gt; a spread of pure, concentrated evil.

&gt; Think of it from that perspective. You know, the average, non
&gt; hard drug using one. The one that votes and is scared of your
&gt; average junkie.

&gt; And then you will see I am not insane at all. Not one bit.

So you claim to be black and
you don't say &quot;nigger&quot;. You're
obviously the liar if there is
some sort of contest.
