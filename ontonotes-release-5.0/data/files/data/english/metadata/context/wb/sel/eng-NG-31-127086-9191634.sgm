Hi folks, I've stopped in for 2 things. One is nice, the other is not
nice in the least. Nice first. After yet again providing a mountain of
evidence and documents supporting my lack of ability to earn income,
the district court is backing off, and hasnt even said for how long
this time. My docotr told them that I had an inoperable situation,
plus seizures that prevent me from working anytime soon (which is also
aa document I forwarded to SSDI) SSDI gave me a document saying it
will likely be early 2009 before I have my administrative hearing, and
for good measure, I also had a letter from SRS that said we would get
a 10 dollar a month raise in foodstamps, due to cost of living.
woohoo. All of those items get the 1800 dollar seeking chilld support
lady to quit sending me court summons every 3 months it seems....but
Im not going to dance about it until I get a document saying so.
Anyone from here that knows me also knows this arrearage for my 21 yr
old son is money I want him, not his mother to have....and Im sure
since he knows of it, he will get it from her, once i have any income
to pay towards it. Getting the court off me is nice, but...i want to
pay the 1800 just to get all connections to the witch (forgive me,
&quot;person&quot;) over with and for my boy to have 1800 bucks to keep his life
moving forward :)

Now the not nice stuff....Last Friday I had the 3rd of 4 planned
epidural cortisone injections, at L2. The previous injections were
smooth...the lidocaine shot stung like hell, but I could live with
it... then I never felt the epidural puncture...the doc had a deft
touch. On this 3rd time however I had not slept more than an hour the
night before due to a night of pain....so we began...me on my left
side, I couldnt pull my knees as far up as normal was the first clue,
then when we stuck me with the lidocaine, i had strong spasms...and he
asked me if i was ok...i told him, it hurt much more, but i would make
it. he waited for the lidocaine to set in, then told me he would begin
the epidural, and holy cats i felt it all the way in, even the last
little poke thru resistance they use to know they are in the
spot....and i felt the medicine flowing in as well...it was the worst
ever, almost as bad as the needle biopsy of my tumor.

Since Friday....I had a headache all day Saturday, which I had been
told could happen. then I statred having nightsweats, and also
sweating in air conditioning....stronger pain in the tumor area, and
the shooting nerve pain has been worse......but here is the
kicker....an embarrassing kicker, but here it is. Sunday night I wet
the bed like a reservoir. I never wet the bed as a child...as a matter
of fact usually Im up 4 times a night to pee, and even then it takes
me awhile to relax enough to go....so enough explanation. Has anyone
had any bad epidurals?
could it be that he may have bruised or nicked a nerve? I know the
nerves in that area can govern continence....and I have had much more
shooting nerve pain activity. I plan on calling the doc in the morning
to ask all this, but i was hoping to get some input prior.....not that
im hoping any of you all peed the bed....just any oddities with
epidurals....I also may call my ask a nurse line to see what they may
suggest....anyway, hi again everyone......hope everyone is well as I
write this note.

Good to hear from you, Dave...

first,congrats on the 'good' stuff-and, I certainly hope that they'll
allow you to give the $1800 to your son, directly, when you get it.
But, the fact that you're officially disabled, and considered so by
the people that were thinking of putting you in jail, must be a load
off my mind.

As to 'bad' epidurals-yes, I had one, and I don't know what I'll do if
my doctor suggests another one.  I was spiking fevers (as high as 107-
I kid you not), sweating, having my blood sugars go out of control...I
was pretty scared!  And, I learned from the doc and the ER staff, they
do make arrangements for diabetics-sugar levels usually go up, mot
down, though!  They had me eating about five packages of graham
crackers, and drinking over-sweetened juice, for about an hour-before
they let me go home.  So, it wasn't exactly the same but pretty
close!  I even had a urinary infection-it was diagnosed by my PC, when
I saw him later.

But the fevers never lasted more than a couple of minutes at a time-at
least not the spikes-or, I probably wouldn't be here now!  So, I got
through it all right-it was like having the flu, for about a month.

so, I hope things have been OK, in fganeral, and you're soon
completely freed of the specter od the possibility of going to jail!
It's not fun...and, even if they found you culpable, what would
keeping you in jail do-for anyone?  You can't collect SSI there, so,
your son(who's on your side) would have to wait ll the linger to be
paid.

Oh-when I sign my posts now, I add a link to my blog.  I've ad seveal
blogs and sites-most have been at least partially abandoned, but I;m
trying to keep this one up.  the plan is, to tell my story of chronic
Pain, adding in other's stories and political and medical
developments, when appropriate. so far, just four posts-but then, I've
been busy with family matters.  Before my last two posts, I'd been
working on a story depicting online CP groups' attitudes towards those
who have been to jail...but, I just can't get it properly balanced.
My idea was to portray the attitude,that overwhelms the majority of
moderated groups....anything to keep them separate from the taint, the
very idea, of addiction.  but, when I write from my point of view, I
come off as sorry for myself-and, when I generalize, I sound like a
'know-it-all', having no facts with which to back myself up.  so, I
won't abandon it-but there may be a few others, in-between.  Oh,
well...I'm just glad that things seem to be working out for you.  Dp
ypu see your PC soon?  It's a good idea to get yourself checked
out!

take care!

Legend-

Thanks for the kind words. It is a load off my shoulders to get the
child support mess settled for now. Yes of course I cant wait for the
day I can hand Wes that check, but yeah, it made no sense for them to
ask for a bench warrant at first to put a bed ridden person in jail
for the last 1800 dollars of 18 yrs of on-time payment. I think Ive
finally provided enough proof to them that I cannot work, if I could,
Id pay, If I had any income, we wouldnt be without milk and bread
until thursday right now, and hoping Susie will have just enough gas
plus fumes to get there until Thursday morning. Thats enough whining
about my finances...I hate when I dwell on that....but yes its a load
off the shoulders, for now.

Today, as soon as the pain clinic is open I will call them to let them
know about this bladder and other problems. I talked to our Helpline
last night....and the ironic thing for people who have followed my
story is that now walmart uses mayo clinic for their 24 hr
nurseline...so here I am tied to the clinic again, like it or not.
Actually....for a nurseline, they are exceptional because they will
get a pharmacist, M.D. and in some cases a specialist on the
line....so they dont just say....call your doctor tomorrow, or go to
the ER tonight, they actually will try to get an answer that has some
insight in it, so for that I can give credit where its due. I still
wouldnt go there unless I needed a major transplant or something. The
nurse on the line last night pulled up the records they have of me up
there, got updates on meds and current treatments, and said they did
likely eitther bruise or nick a nerve, and she also told me more
warning signs to look for, and which ones should get me to the
hospital in an ambulance if necessary. Between that, and your
experiencess with epidurals, Legend lets me know there is sure a wide
spectrum of things that can go awry with this procedure. The
anesthesiologist that does this, I do have to say, has an incredible
touch when it comes to the needle...however, with the spasms I was
having that day, maybe should have prompted him to either stop....or
maybe further sedate me or numb the area more or something. I can see
where a spasm could cause a needle, even in the right place to jiter
and bounce of one or several nerves and play a bit of havoc, but thats
just my lay-conjecture....at 830 AM...still an hour away, I will see
what they have to say. The I will tell them I will either have to wait
until at least 4pm today....or Friday to some to the office...or I
will have to go via ambulance if they view it serious enough for
that....I kinda doubt that part, but who knows, it sucks not being
able to drive, and we cant afford Susie to lose the hours to leave
early to come take me in. which brings us back to money, which means I
should stop for now.....I will update as soon as I talk to the Pain
Clinic.

Dear Dave,

Welcome back, man. You ever think leaving's the reason your doc screwed up
the last shot? We weren't watching. Ok, maybe it was something else. But the
Wicked Witch of the West getting her broomstick stuck where the sun don't
shine is pure justice.
If you think it qualifies as &quot;loss of bladder and/or bowel control, hit your
ER. According to what I've heard spine surgeons say, that can be an
emergency. But if you think it could have been from being beat and not
sleeping (well) for a few days and you just slept solid through it, I
wouldn't sweat it too bad, but definitely call your doc.
Usually when they f**k up in epidural spaces, you get one hell of a bell
ringer of a headache. Never had one, but from all accounts, it would be your
main concern if something was really screwed, but yea, there are good block
and bad blocks and the thing that throws a lot of people is that it gets
worse a few days after the actual injection and not immediately bad. So it's
kind of got a couple day fuse on it before it blows.
Being tense is not a good thing for a block. Your muscle contracts and makes
it hard to get through, usually leaving a hell of a bruise and extra pain.
But get hold of the doc. I don't know if one of those lidocaine patches
would help, but it couldn't hurt.

Drop me a line if you feel up to it--og

&gt; it hard to get through, usually leaving a hell of a bruise and extra pain.
&gt; But get hold of the doc. I don't know if one of those lidocaine patches
&gt; would help, but it couldn't hurt.

&gt; &gt; Hi folks, I've stopped in for 2 things. One is nice, the other is not
&gt; &gt; nice in the least. Nice first. After yet again providing a mountain of
&gt; &gt; evidence and documents supporting my lack of ability to earn income,
&gt; &gt; the district court is backing off, and hasnt even said for how long
&gt; &gt; this time. My docotr told them that I had an inoperable situation,
&gt; &gt; plus seizures that prevent me from working anytime soon (which is also
&gt; &gt; aa document I forwarded to SSDI) SSDI gave me a document saying it
&gt; &gt; will likely be early 2009 before I have my administrative hearing, and
&gt; &gt; for good measure, I also had a letter from SRS that said we would get
&gt; &gt; a 10 dollar a month raise in foodstamps, due to cost of living.
&gt; &gt; woohoo. All of those items get the 1800 dollar seeking chilld support
&gt; &gt; lady to quit sending me court summons every 3 months it seems....but
&gt; &gt; Im not going to dance about it until I get a document saying so.
&gt; &gt; Anyone from here that knows me also knows this arrearage for my 21 yr
&gt; &gt; old son is money I want him, not his mother to have....and Im sure
&gt; &gt; since he knows of it, he will get it from her, once i have any income
&gt; &gt; to pay towards it. Getting the court off me is nice, but...i want to
&gt; &gt; pay the 1800 just to get all connections to the witch (forgive me,
&gt; &gt; &quot;person&quot;) over with and for my boy to have 1800 bucks to keep his life
&gt; &gt; moving forward :)

&gt; &gt; Now the not nice stuff....Last Friday I had the 3rd of 4 planned
&gt; &gt; epidural cortisone injections, at L2. The previous injections were
&gt; &gt; smooth...the lidocaine shot stung like hell, but I could live with
&gt; &gt; it... then I never felt the epidural puncture...the doc had a deft
&gt; &gt; touch. On this 3rd time however I had not slept more than an hour the
&gt; &gt; night before due to a night of pain....so we began...me on my left
&gt; &gt; side, I couldnt pull my knees as far up as normal was the first clue,
&gt; &gt; then when we stuck me with the lidocaine, i had strong spasms...and he
&gt; &gt; asked me if i was ok...i told him, it hurt much more, but i would make
&gt; &gt; it. he waited for the lidocaine to set in, then told me he would begin
&gt; &gt; the epidural, and holy cats i felt it all the way in, even the last
&gt; &gt; little poke thru resistance they use to know they are in the
&gt; &gt; spot....and i felt the medicine flowing in as well...it was the worst
&gt; &gt; ever, almost as bad as the needle biopsy of my tumor.

&gt; &gt; Since Friday....I had a headache all day Saturday, which I had been
&gt; &gt; told could happen. then I statred having nightsweats, and also
&gt; &gt; sweating in air conditioning....stronger pain in the tumor area, and
&gt; &gt; the shooting nerve pain has been worse......but here is the
&gt; &gt; kicker....an embarrassing kicker, but here it is. Sunday night I wet
&gt; &gt; the bed like a reservoir. I never wet the bed as a child...as a matter
&gt; &gt; of fact usually Im up 4 times a night to pee, and even then it takes
&gt; &gt; me awhile to relax enough to go....so enough explanation. Has anyone
&gt; &gt; had any bad epidurals?
&gt; &gt; could it be that he may have bruised or nicked a nerve? I know the
&gt; &gt; nerves in that area can govern continence....and I have had much more
&gt; &gt; shooting nerve pain activity. I plan on calling the doc in the morning
&gt; &gt; to ask all this, but i was hoping to get some input prior.....not that
&gt; &gt; im hoping any of you all peed the bed....just any oddities with
&gt; &gt; epidurals....I also may call my ask a nurse line to see what they may
&gt; &gt; suggest....anyway, hi again everyone......hope everyone is well as I
&gt; &gt; write this note.

Aloha Dave and All!

Dave, Dave, Dave...PLEASE, don't ever make me think you &quot;left the
family&quot; ever again! Honestly. I was on the verge of seeing if I could
get your email addy from OG so I could &quot;pester&quot; you! LOL! It's sure
good to 'see' you back here.  Oh, and you DON'T need such extreme
&quot;good/bad&quot; reasons to come and post, you know. Just giving us a heads-
up on your health once a week (at the very LEAST) is reason enough and
I wish EVERYONE would at least do that.

You, my friend, and so many others here don't realize just how much I
sincerely care about you. Heck, I've never told you so how were you to
know? (Yes Ronnie, I DO. Even if I am a slacker on returning emails.
Sorry) But I DO and I've begun to realize just how much everyone
that's ever responded to a post of mine or commented about something I
said really means to me. Maybe it's because my one year anniversary is
this month and everyone's been so nice to me that whole time (OK, I
know I've been given some constructive criticism and that's fine. I
need that too.)

I don't want to scare you and don't let me because I haven't got any
training in the medical profession other than what I've had to endure
by letting doctors and surgeons examine and cut me up. OK?

Yes. I've had 2 epidurals for back pain and didn't get the luxury of
any kind of sedation or numbing agent. It was never mentioned at the
time and I didn't know a THING about them either. I just thought that
they were &quot;hell to endure&quot; and called it quits after TWO of what could
have been a series of FIVE or SIX!  I totally agree with your
description of the experience, however, if I'd written it, I'd have
put a few more adjectives and expletives! LOL!  I can barely remember
the 'sessions' now because these were done during the first few years
of my CP life (when I was so damn naive).

That said, the thing that comes to mind is that you may be leaking
spinal fluid somewhere causing your headache (OG? He DID have a
whopper headache last Saturday!) and before I had each one of my three
surgeries, the surgeons drilled it in to me that the odds of them
hitting a nerve that could affect my bladder/bowel control and sexual
ability (erection only, thank goodness! They can't take away my
SKILLS!-HA-ha!).  Have you noticed anything missing during the night
or upon waking? Or any time you think you are getting sexually
aroused? If THAT is missing also, I'd RUN or dive as fast as I could,
not walk, to the ER to tell them about this and what probably is
causing it. If you wait too long, the doctors may not be able to do
anything to help you as the &quot;window&quot; of opportunity starts out very
small and doesn't last very long at all in order to &quot;fix&quot; something
like this. That is, IF it CAN be fixed at all! The thought of needing
an adult diaper at night would not be a step in the right direction
for me...I don't think it would be for you either. YIKES!

I may be completely wrong and I probably am. I want to be wrong on
this one. PLEASE let us know as soon as you know what the doctor says
about this, OK?

About the $1800...I always could feel that you really never did
anything that wrong to anyone to deserve such treatment as to be
thrown in jail for so little money and under those circumstances. I
know it's easy for me to say because it isn't my butt on the line.
However, bad things (and I mean REALLY BAD) usually don't happen to
most good people, of which you are one in MY book.

Welcome back again. I'm sure I'm NOT the only one eagerly awaiting
your post about what your doc has to say about what you've been
through since this epidural. I'll be watching!

Aloha Just For Now,
Hawaiian Wayne

I wet through the epidural shots. I had had them before and was anxious
about it this time. The first one I slept through because they gave me too
much valium. The second time the doc hit bone at least twice. None of the
local had any effect and I told them that. I should have stopped then.
Long story short. I'm sure it helps and does wonders for people but not
for me.

(((((((((((((((( dave ))))))))))))))))))

Such relief over the court retreat!!!!  I've come to look at the courts very
much like the troll in the first Harry Potter movie....lumbering, too big to
do itself any good, big ol' hairy booger hanging it of its nose....only able
to mumble &quot;Huh?&quot;...about the extent of its vocabulary.

I'm sorry over the embarrassment.  There are some things that just stomp our
self-esteem, even though we'd tell the next fella not to worry about it.  I
CAN tell ya that i have had two folks with back problems have the exact same
thing happen....only one of them had it happen a couple of times a week.
His ended up being his medications...couldn't wake up enough to get up to
hit the john.

Sweetheart, i know it's a monumental dent in your confidence, but truly,
chalk it up to the cruelty of the pain.  You are no less the man that went
to bed the night before.  Plus, now you can comfort the next person who
experiences the same thing.  Also, more important....is this something that
will matter when you stand before God?  No.  Not in the least.

Wash the sheets and quit the whiskey  8^D

deep peace,
Lavon
