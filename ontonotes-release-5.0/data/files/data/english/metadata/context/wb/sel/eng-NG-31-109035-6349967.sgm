This weekend He came home after being away for a week. The first day
was nice, and we played a little. Afterwards I told him that I felt he
didn't push hard enough, (though it was awesome) that I was really in
the mood to be hurt.

The next day went badly for both of us; me having been called in to
work; Him trying to get caught up with other tasks. We didn't spend
much of that day together, and I was sad that we didn't. He was busy
fixing his truck and other nessesary tasks, so, not his fault.

The next day was my brother's B-day; He passed away in January; I
tried not to let it distract me too much from our last day together.
His group were all meeting up to play hockey for the last time this
season, so I put on my happy face and went to the game.

They all played well and went to the locker room to party after, like
always. I was fine for most of it, though I wasn't drinking and they
all were. I did let him know that it was my brothers birthday and I
was feeling a bit sad. He said we could go home after a few
more.....and yes he was drunk.

We sat in the hot tub for awhile and He was in an odd mood; an odd
drunk mood; kept discussing things I'd rather not. (his ex gf, her
dog, my mood, etc.) All very mood shattering since he was drunk and I
was not in a good mood to start off with.

Afterward He decided we were going to play; out of nowhere; he started
in with the tawse. I let him know that I was not really in the mood
for games. He was too drunk to notice I was not wanting heavy play
*now*. The other day? Yes, but not now. He bit my throat all over
until I was screaming...

He chained me to the wall, put a new gag in my mouth and grabbed the
zapper. He went straight for my nipples, no warm up whatsoever. He
continued with the tawse and also had the large wooden paddle. I put
up with these okay, but I was squirming too much. He put the gag in my
mouth (has a leather 'phallic' type thing rather than a ball) and tied
my ankles with rope. He reminded me far too many times about my
complaint the other day about not being 'hurt' enough. He used the
zapper on my nipples, the tawse and paddle on my ass - he counted off
twenty and then really started getting very rough...well, he was rough
the whole way through -

I was in enough pain that I could not stop to catch my breath and I
kept thrashing about - with PAIN being my only thought. No happy
place, no lust, no joy. It was at this point that I pulled the chains
out of the wall on one side. Apparently my adrenaline was going full
force, as this very long eye bolt came right out of the wooden stud.
It came out with enough force that when it hit his leg it caused him a
largish gash on his leg.
I kept asking him to stop, I removed the gag (the one he figured i
could not remove) and he was very upset.

He removed the remnants of the chain from my right wrist and secured
me to the chain on my left. He let me know how very unhappy he was and
zapped my nipples until i was certain they were ruined. He then took
out the candles and poured hot wax on them, only holding the candle
about three inches above my breasts. It burned and I could smell my
flesh - I began crying, with no other possible outlet. He didn't
notice at first, spun me around and poured more hot wax over my welted
ass - the whole time telling me how unhappy he was with me, how his
leg hurt and he didn't know how it was possible for me to pull that
chain/eye bolt out of the stud. He listed all my mistakes through the
night and mocked me saying how he hadn't 'hurt' me enough the other
night, so he was really going to hurt me now.

Upon discovering my tears, he unchained me, and we had sex.

He's gone again for another week. I'm not sure I'll be here when He
comes home.

Wanting heavy play when one is worked up to it is very nice. Heavy
play for the sole purpose of hurting me and humiliating me in
drunkeness is wholly unappealing and upsetting. Maybe I've
overreacted, maybe underreacted - but one thing is certain, I've lost
something huge this last week.

Sounds to me like he has a drink problem. People can act completely out of
context and character when drunk, and it seems he needs to realise and
apologise or if I were you, I'd walk.

Sounds awful. I'm sure you will feel the nice thoughts coming from people
here, toward you.

I do trust no permanent damage  in the physical sense was done. What a
complete prat, to  get so drunk. All the reading I've done warns against
playing when drunk, its ridiculous.

My breasts and bottom are burned this morning, I've been putting aloe
on for the pain. I don't know if there will be scarring, as they are
probably minor burns, but hard to say. Although this wax is made to
cool fast, it could not cool fast enough to prevent the burns (because
of the height of the drop).

This is our second very bad scene and yes I do think alcohol has
something to do with it, but the man has more to do with it. I know
He's a sadist, I've always known, but usually it isn't so "about him"
as it was last night. I feel it's clear now that He loves to torture
me, even when I'm not in the mood to participate.

Something I forgot to mention: He threatened my face with the zapper
and the wax. This really put me over the top. I was once in a
relationship where the man beat my face over and over saying that no
one would ever think me beautiful again. I always felt that it was the
most horrific thing a person could do, and demonstrated his lack of
empathy or love for me. Maybe this is different, but to me it struck a
chord.

&gt;&gt;&gt; This weekend He came home after being away for a week. The first day
&gt;&gt;&gt; was nice, and we played a little. Afterwards I told him that I felt he
&gt;&gt;&gt; didn't push hard enough, (though it was awesome) that I was really in
&gt;&gt;&gt; the mood to be hurt.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The next day went badly for both of us; me having been called in to
&gt;&gt;&gt; work; Him trying to get caught up with other tasks. We didn't spend
&gt;&gt;&gt; much of that day together, and I was sad that we didn't. He was busy
&gt;&gt;&gt; fixing his truck and other nessesary tasks, so, not his fault.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The next day was my brother's B-day; He passed away in January; I
&gt;&gt;&gt; tried not to let it distract me too much from our last day together.
&gt;&gt;&gt; His group were all meeting up to play hockey for the last time this
&gt;&gt;&gt; season, so I put on my happy face and went to the game.
&gt;&gt;&gt; They all played well and went to the locker room to party after, like
&gt;&gt;&gt; always. I was fine for most of it, though I wasn't drinking and they
&gt;&gt;&gt; all were. I did let him know that it was my brothers birthday and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; was feeling a bit sad. He said we could go home after a few
&gt;&gt;&gt; more.....and yes he was drunk.
&gt;&gt;&gt; We sat in the hot tub for awhile and He was in an odd mood; an odd
&gt;&gt;&gt; drunk mood; kept discussing things I'd rather not. (his ex gf, her
&gt;&gt;&gt; dog, my mood, etc.) All very mood shattering since he was drunk and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; was not in a good mood to start off with.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Afterward He decided we were going to play; out of nowhere; he started
&gt;&gt;&gt; in with the tawse. I let him know that I was not really in the mood
&gt;&gt;&gt; for games. He was too drunk to notice I was not wanting heavy play
&gt;&gt;&gt; *now*. The other day? Yes, but not now. He bit my throat all over
&gt;&gt;&gt; until I was screaming...
&gt;&gt;&gt; He chained me to the wall, put a new gag in my mouth and grabbed the
&gt;&gt;&gt; zapper. He went straight for my nipples, no warm up whatsoever. He
&gt;&gt;&gt; continued with the tawse and also had the large wooden paddle. I put
&gt;&gt;&gt; up with these okay, but I was squirming too much. He put the gag in my
&gt;&gt;&gt; mouth (has a leather 'phallic' type thing rather than a ball) and tied
&gt;&gt;&gt; my ankles with rope. He reminded me far too many times about my
&gt;&gt;&gt; complaint the other day about not being 'hurt' enough. He used the
&gt;&gt;&gt; zapper on my nipples, the tawse and paddle on my ass - he counted off
&gt;&gt;&gt; twenty and then really started getting very rough...well, he was rough
&gt;&gt;&gt; the whole way through -
&gt;&gt;&gt; I was in enough pain that I could not stop to catch my breath and I
&gt;&gt;&gt; kept thrashing about - with PAIN being my only thought. No happy
&gt;&gt;&gt; place, no lust, no joy. It was at this point that I pulled the chains
&gt;&gt;&gt; out of the wall on one side. Apparently my adrenaline was going full
&gt;&gt;&gt; force, as this very long eye bolt came right out of the wooden stud.
&gt;&gt;&gt; It came out with enough force that when it hit his leg it caused him a
&gt;&gt;&gt; largish gash on his leg.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I kept asking him to stop, I removed the gag (the one he figured i
&gt;&gt;&gt; could not remove) and he was very upset.
&gt;&gt;&gt; He removed the remnants of the chain from my right wrist and secured
&gt;&gt;&gt; me to the chain on my left. He let me know how very unhappy he was and
&gt;&gt;&gt; zapped my nipples until i was certain they were ruined. He then took
&gt;&gt;&gt; out the candles and poured hot wax on them, only holding the candle
&gt;&gt;&gt; about three inches above my breasts. It burned and I could smell my
&gt;&gt;&gt; flesh - I began crying, with no other possible outlet. He didn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; notice at first, spun me around and poured more hot wax over my welted
&gt;&gt;&gt; ass - the whole time telling me how unhappy he was with me, how his
&gt;&gt;&gt; leg hurt and he didn't know how it was possible for me to pull that
&gt;&gt;&gt; chain/eye bolt out of the stud. He listed all my mistakes through the
&gt;&gt;&gt; night and mocked me saying how he hadn't 'hurt' me enough the other
&gt;&gt;&gt; night, so he was really going to hurt me now.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Upon discovering my tears, he unchained me, and we had sex.
&gt;&gt;&gt; He's gone again for another week. I'm not sure I'll be here when He
&gt;&gt;&gt; comes home.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Wanting heavy play when one is worked up to it is very nice. Heavy
&gt;&gt;&gt; play for the sole purpose of hurting me and humiliating me in
&gt;&gt;&gt; drunkeness is wholly unappealing and upsetting. Maybe I've
&gt;&gt;&gt; overreacted, maybe underreacted - but one thing is certain, I've lost
&gt;&gt;&gt; something huge this last week.- Hide quoted text -

Hon, I'm so sorry to hear all this.  It all sounds really awful.
Particularly the part about threatening your face when it was a hot
button for you--that's a bad betrayal of trust.  And it doesn't sound
like he has a lot of respect for you--did he know that it was your
dead brother's birthday?  I guess I'm wondering whether he's
inconsiderate normally, or whether getting drunk caused him to kind of
forget that you're a real human person.

I'm using Lynn's comments as a starting point, but it's not Lynn to whom I'm
speaking.

Please forgive my bluntness; I'm having trouble finding any tactfulness within
me after reading all this.

I don't really care whether he's "inconsiderate" or [just] a really nasty drunk.
It doesn't matter.  The end result was an abusive beating by someone too
impaired to be near you safely.

I apologize for not knowing/remembering your history with this person and for
not knowing the details of any commitment you have to each other.  Whatever it
is or was, I sincerely hope you'll do some very serious reevaluation of your
relationship before you allow yourself to be alone with him again.

I'm not a big believer in the often-bandied-about idea that people do weird,
outlandish things when they're drunk; I'm more inclined to think that the
alcohol-induced lessening of inhibitions simply allows their repressed inner
selves to emerge, often to the astonishment and dismay of observers.  I don't
think this was simply a lapse of judgment; I think it uncovered some really
virulent, violent feelings that could well be unleashed against you again in the
future.

I don't think you are safe -- physically or emotionally -- with this man unless
and until you find a way to renegotiate your boundaries.  That said, I *really*
don't think that's possible.  There's a major trust issue here, which was
violated.  There's a major *human* issue, which was violated.  There may even be
a major "sane person" issue which was violated.

The verbal abuse he dumped on you was pretty horrendous, but I'm inclined to
think it could be healed with sufficient work, honesty, and commitment from each
of you.  (I don't know that I would personally be willing to give it a shot, but
that's not the issue here.)

The physical abuse is what frightens me. It wasn't play.  It wasn't a scene.  It
was a physical beating perpetrated on you because he was in a weird, bad mood
and took it out on you.  You could have been much more seriously injured. It
sounds as if he raped you after beating you.  (Or were you actually in a mood to
"have sex" at that point?)  One of you could have ended up dead.  You were
restrained, and he was too drunk to figure things out.

You said:
|||  Heavy play for the sole purpose of hurting me and humiliating
|||  me in drunkeness is wholly unappealing and upsetting.

Can you hear today how *odd* that sounds?  You were seriously, intentionally
beaten, apparently far beyond what you seem to consider your own boundaries, but
you refer to it only as "unappealing."  Would you choose that word again today?
I hope not. I hope you'd describe it as "totally and completely
unacceptable."[1]

It's up to you to protect yourself in the future.  If it means renegotiating
your relationship so that alcohol is completely off limits, do it.  If it means
locking the door between you and swallowing the key, do it.  If that means
calling the police if he comes back, do it.  Whatever you need to do to keep
from repeating this episode, please do it.

I think you're not seeing the situation as being as truly dangerous as it
sounds.  I hope the next few days will give you time to think very carefully
what you want from this relationship, what he's likely to be able to give you,
and whether what you may be able to get is *really* what you want.

Again, I'm sorry if this is blunt or totally off target, but I'm really very
worried for your safety.

[1] Another way to word it would be, "do it again and I'll fucking kill you."

Dear psyquestor, I was very troubled to read about your experience. I
think you've often posted about doing stuff that pushes your
boundaries quite far, but never have I detected this emotional tone in
your scene reports. It sounds like he went way, way too far, and like
alcohol maybe served as a catalyst and an amplifier, but what was
being amplified is something that's just there in the man, and not
maybe something you want to entrust yourself to.

Of course getting pushed beyond what you thought you were capable of
standing, and finding the strength to manage it, is the greatest thing
in the world, but at least in my own experience it takes two mutually
conscious people to get to that point. It really sounds like he was in
a place where he wasn't seeing you anymore, he was just working from
his own internal state in a way that had nothing to do with you, or
you as partners in a relationship - and that might well not be
something you want to put yourself in the way of. You are absolutely
right that there is a world of difference between wanting heavy play
when it's the right thing for your head (and obviously your partner's
as well), and just having it inflicted on you inappropriately -
drunkenness or no.

It's so hard to know how to draw that line, and of course an outsider
can't say much at all objective, just that I felt very strongly from
your account that there was something really bad going on there; you
sound, for lack of any better way to say it, sickened and exhausted. I
wish you all the strength to figure out how you're feeling and what
you want to do now, and most importantly to get yourself back after
this terrible ordeal.

I wondered about this as well. though from the description of his state, I
doubt it would have made any difference. If some sort of anger is involved,
then she is best out the door.  He was apparently not so drunk that he could
not remember her saying  she wanted to be hurt more though, which is
worrying.

Irt all boils down to the fact thatt it seems he cannot control his sadism,
and has been said, that is a bad accident waiting to happen.

Yes, and I think one way to see it is that she has not lost anything other
than a lucky escape, but he has lost her. I hope that makes him proud of
himself, but I somehow doubt it. I agree with most of the rest of you here
after the second post. The burns are unacceptable, and it did sound like
rape then, to me.

I'm sensitized because I spent three months on a burn unit in 2005.

PLEASE take care of your burns carefully! PLEASE consider seeing a doctor!

You might want to ask about using an antibiotic ointment to prevent

Somewhat funny tangential memory: they use so much antibiotic ointment on
the burn unit to cover so much area that the nurses don't bother with the

Im not snipping this because I agree entirely with what alci said. And
Ty. This sounds to an outsider like a complete violation of trust and
boundaries, not to mention outright dangerous behavior in a man that
clearly is more physically powerful than you.

Jerking the chain out of the wall as a reaction to what was happening
should have given him ample clue as to your distress, and, well...he
kept going.

This is Not OK, from my point of view. I hope youre feeling a little
better, and that you're healing up ok. I also hope you never, ever let
that man touch you again.

Again, an outsiders point of view, but ...a very distressed outsider
that is seriously concerned about you.

Your dilemma may be an outgrowth of being submissive, if that's how
you identify.  For many submissives, it's *all* about the dominant.
Being used for another's pleasure, especially if that means some
fairly extreme usage--sometimes that's even a measure of one's
committment to being submissive.  "Hey, this is what you wanted!" is a
great defense for a dominant in that situation.  And I've known people
for whom the sort of treatment you got would have been pretty hot
stuff and they'd be fine with it.  Remember the old "love v.
dominance" arguments, where people claim that if you love or care
about someone too much, you can't be "truly" dominant, because you
experience the conflict between your own needs/desires and your desire
to be nice to them.  Hey, their kink is ok, but I'm going to make damn
sure that my dominant can please him/herself and still keep my overall
well-being in mind.

Remember the days when it was considered legally impossible for a
husband to rape his wife?  Same thing here.  The "hey, this is what
you agreed to!" defense  worked then, and it's working now, and it's
fucking up your mind in a bad way.

&gt; I don't think you are safe -- physically or emotionally -- with this man unless

&gt; violated.  There's a major *human* issue, which was violated.  There may even be

I'm a big fan of negotiation.  Really.  But there are some things that
oughtn't need be negotiated.  On the day my mother dies, please don't
expect me to be interested in a fancy dinner out and a movie.  When I
return from the vet with a body rather than a pet, ditto.  Sure,
negotiate whether you like clamps more than paddles and whether it's
ok to use paddles anyway, but if I'm expected at my in-laws for
Christmas dinner, I get to go to my in-laws for Christmas dinner!  A
basic understanding of these things is a prerequisite for anyone
wishing to have a relationship with me.  He didn't seem to clue in to
any of that, or if he did, he didn't care.  The first is a
relationship no-no, the second is, well, a relationship no-no.

Other issues along these lines (and I know that JJ would disagree with
me) include knowing that a gag is intended to prevent verbal
communication, and that I need to be double-plus aware of other forms
of communication if I use one.  Zzzzzt!  Missed that one.  They'd need
to know that the ability to rip chains out of the wall indicates real
issues.  Zzzzt!  Blew that one, too!

I'm surprised he could get it up, if he was drunk enough to commit
rape.  I wonder if, when he sobers up, he'll think back and realize

&gt; I hope not. I hope you'd describe it as &quot;totally and completely

A visit from the locksmith, at the very least, comes to mind.  The
best way to prevent another alcoholic beating and rape is to become
able to enforce the limits you choose.  That may--sad thought, I
know&lt;g&gt;--mean never being restrained in his presence again--should you
even choose to be in his presence again!  It might mean only playing
with him in public--should you even choose to play with him again.
Put 911 on speed-dial.  Only speak to him in public--and don't let
public charmingness lull you into thinking he's over it--if you
confront him about his behavior, he may decide to *really* teach you a
lesson, and he may be willing to wait for his chance.

But I think that if I had to take these steps, I'd probably decide to
go a step further and not see him, ever again.  Being constantly in
self-defense mode isn't fun, and it certainly isn't the sort of fun
we're looking to have in the BDSM world.

Hang in there, and do let us know how you're doing.  If you need a

Respectfully and with compassion, you have not overreacted.  By my
reading this man has committed a crime against you.  He got drunk, beat
and raped you.  If you don't want to report it, at least consider
getting some counseling or talking to a rape crisis center.  And please,
please, if this is your home, I would urge you to change the locks and
don't be there when he comes back.  If this is his home, pack your
things and leave.  He has proven that you are not safe in his presence.
Above all else a top/dominant must be trustworthy.  He is not.

&gt; This weekend He came home after being away for a week. The first day
&gt; was nice, and we played a little. Afterwards I told him that I felt he
&gt; didn't push hard enough, (though it was awesome) that I was really in
&gt; the mood to be hurt.

&gt; The next day went badly for both of us; me having been called in to
&gt; work; Him trying to get caught up with other tasks. We didn't spend
&gt; much of that day together, and I was sad that we didn't. He was busy
&gt; fixing his truck and other nessesary tasks, so, not his fault.

&gt; The next day was my brother's B-day; He passed away in January; I
&gt; tried not to let it distract me too much from our last day together.
&gt; His group were all meeting up to play hockey for the last time this
&gt; season, so I put on my happy face and went to the game.

&gt; They all played well and went to the locker room to party after, like
&gt; always. I was fine for most of it, though I wasn't drinking and they
&gt; all were. I did let him know that it was my brothers birthday and I
&gt; was feeling a bit sad. He said we could go home after a few
&gt; more.....and yes he was drunk.

&gt; We sat in the hot tub for awhile and He was in an odd mood; an odd
&gt; drunk mood; kept discussing things I'd rather not. (his ex gf, her
&gt; dog, my mood, etc.) All very mood shattering since he was drunk and I
&gt; was not in a good mood to start off with.

&gt; Afterward He decided we were going to play; out of nowhere; he started
&gt; in with the tawse. I let him know that I was not really in the mood
&gt; for games. He was too drunk to notice I was not wanting heavy play
&gt; *now*. The other day? Yes, but not now. He bit my throat all over
&gt; until I was screaming...

&gt; He chained me to the wall, put a new gag in my mouth and grabbed the
&gt; zapper. He went straight for my nipples, no warm up whatsoever. He
&gt; continued with the tawse and also had the large wooden paddle. I put
&gt; up with these okay, but I was squirming too much. He put the gag in my
&gt; mouth (has a leather 'phallic' type thing rather than a ball) and tied
&gt; my ankles with rope. He reminded me far too many times about my
&gt; complaint the other day about not being 'hurt' enough. He used the
&gt; zapper on my nipples, the tawse and paddle on my ass - he counted off
&gt; twenty and then really started getting very rough...well, he was rough
&gt; the whole way through -

&gt; I was in enough pain that I could not stop to catch my breath and I
&gt; kept thrashing about - with PAIN being my only thought. No happy
&gt; place, no lust, no joy. It was at this point that I pulled the chains
&gt; out of the wall on one side. Apparently my adrenaline was going full
&gt; force, as this very long eye bolt came right out of the wooden stud.
&gt; It came out with enough force that when it hit his leg it caused him a
&gt; largish gash on his leg.
&gt; I kept asking him to stop, I removed the gag (the one he figured i
&gt; could not remove) and he was very upset.

&gt; He removed the remnants of the chain from my right wrist and secured
&gt; me to the chain on my left. He let me know how very unhappy he was and
&gt; zapped my nipples until i was certain they were ruined. He then took
&gt; out the candles and poured hot wax on them, only holding the candle
&gt; about three inches above my breasts. It burned and I could smell my
&gt; flesh - I began crying, with no other possible outlet. He didn't
&gt; notice at first, spun me around and poured more hot wax over my welted
&gt; ass - the whole time telling me how unhappy he was with me, how his
&gt; leg hurt and he didn't know how it was possible for me to pull that
&gt; chain/eye bolt out of the stud. He listed all my mistakes through the
&gt; night and mocked me saying how he hadn't 'hurt' me enough the other
&gt; night, so he was really going to hurt me now.

&gt; Upon discovering my tears, he unchained me, and we had sex.

&gt; He's gone again for another week. I'm not sure I'll be here when He
&gt; comes home.

&gt; Wanting heavy play when one is worked up to it is very nice. Heavy
&gt; play for the sole purpose of hurting me and humiliating me in
&gt; drunkeness is wholly unappealing and upsetting. Maybe I've
&gt; overreacted, maybe underreacted - but one thing is certain, I've lost
&gt; something huge this last week.

Hello, Psyquestor...

I work with offenders...sex offenders.  Given those things I choose to
do with my free time, my career path may seem a bit odd, but I seem to
land in those places where I can accomplish a little good.
Hopefully, I can manage just a bit of that tonight.

There is such an enormous difference between the power exchange that
occurs in a D/s relationship and the assault you lived through.
Alcibiades and Ty have it right.  Drugs and alcohol are used by sex
offenders to accomplish their crimes.  If you let him in the door,
this will happen again.  You did not exist as a person in his mind.  I
could go on and on about where his head was, but it is wrong to take
someone down that path unless the guide is physically present to
assure that person's physical and mental safety.   YWCA's, county
mental health systems and women's shelters all have contact numbers
for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault.  Please contact
someone.

I have been the victim of a violent sex crime and have spent years
trying to figure the twisted shit out.  One thing I absolutely do
know...the crime wasn't about me.  It had nothing to do with me other
than the fact that I was physically present and terrified.  This crime
was not about you, no matter how many times you were told that it
was.  Once again, you need someone who is licensed and safe to walk
you through this, just know that it wasn't about you.

This isn't as eloquent as other posts.  I cannot spin words when it
comes to violence.  Please safeguard your home and work...and seek out
support.  Sexual assault is far too devastating to deal with alone.

Bella

I'm profoundly sorry that you had to live through this.

This is going to be painfully blunt.  What you described
is not BDSM-- it is abuse at the very least, and almost
certainly crosses the line into assault.

The answer that you don't want to hear is "leave".  That
may or may not be the ultimate answer for you, but at the
very least I'd encourage you to stay the fuck away from
this man when he's been drinking.

&gt;&gt; Ditto, Psy--I'm learning that I pay much less attention to the people
&gt;&gt; around me than I ought.

&gt;&gt; Your dilemma may be an outgrowth of being submissive, if that's how
&gt;&gt; you identify.  For many submissives, it's *all* about the dominant.
&gt;&gt; Being used for another's pleasure, especially if that means some
&gt;&gt; fairly extreme usage--sometimes that's even a measure of one's
&gt;&gt; committment to being submissive.  &quot;Hey, this is what you wanted!&quot; is a
&gt;&gt; great defense for a dominant in that situation.  And I've known people
&gt;&gt; for whom the sort of treatment you got would have been pretty hot
&gt;&gt; stuff and they'd be fine with it.  Remember the old &quot;love v.
&gt;&gt; dominance&quot; arguments, where people claim that if you love or care
&gt;&gt; about someone too much, you can't be &quot;truly&quot; dominant, because you
&gt;&gt; experience the conflict between your own needs/desires and your desire
&gt;&gt; to be nice to them.  Hey, their kink is ok, but I'm going to make damn
&gt;&gt; sure that my dominant can please him/herself and still keep my overall
&gt;&gt; well-being in mind.

&gt;&gt; Remember the days when it was considered legally impossible for a
&gt;&gt; husband to rape his wife?  Same thing here.  The &quot;hey, this is what
&gt;&gt; you agreed to!&quot; defense  worked then, and it's working now, and it's
&gt;&gt; fucking up your mind in a bad way.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think you are safe -- physically or emotionally -- with this man unless
&gt;&gt;&gt; and until you find a way to renegotiate your boundaries.  hat said, I *really*
&gt;&gt;&gt; don't think that's possible.  here's a major trust issue here, which was
&gt;&gt;&gt; violated.  here's a major *human* issue, which was violated.  here may even be
&gt;&gt;&gt; a major &quot;sane person&quot; issue which was violated.
&gt;&gt; I'm a big fan of negotiation.  Really.  But there are some things that
&gt;&gt; oughtn't need be negotiated.  On the day my mother dies, please don't
&gt;&gt; expect me to be interested in a fancy dinner out and a movie.  When I
&gt;&gt; return from the vet with a body rather than a pet, ditto.  Sure,
&gt;&gt; negotiate whether you like clamps more than paddles and whether it's
&gt;&gt; ok to use paddles anyway, but if I'm expected at my in-laws for
&gt;&gt; Christmas dinner, I get to go to my in-laws for Christmas dinner!  A
&gt;&gt; basic understanding of these things is a prerequisite for anyone
&gt;&gt; wishing to have a relationship with me.  He didn't seem to clue in to
&gt;&gt; any of that, or if he did, he didn't care.  The first is a
&gt;&gt; relationship no-no, the second is, well, a relationship no-no.

&gt;&gt; Other issues along these lines (and I know that JJ would disagree with
&gt;&gt; me) include knowing that a gag is intended to prevent verbal
&gt;&gt; communication, and that I need to be double-plus aware of other forms
&gt;&gt; of communication if I use one.  Zzzzzt!  Missed that one.  They'd need
&gt;&gt; to know that the ability to rip chains out of the wall indicates real
&gt;&gt; issues.  Zzzzt!  Blew that one, too!

&gt;&gt;&gt; You could have been much more seriously injured.
&gt;&gt; Actually, it sounds as if you were.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It
&gt;&gt;&gt; sounds as if he raped you after beating you. (Or were you actually in a mood to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;have sex&quot; at that point?)  ne of you could have ended up dead.  ou were
&gt;&gt;&gt; restrained, and he was too drunk to figure things out.
&gt;&gt; I'm surprised he could get it up, if he was drunk enough to commit
&gt;&gt; rape.  I wonder if, when he sobers up, he'll think back and realize
&gt;&gt; that he probably shouldn't come back, just in case the cops are
&gt;&gt; waiting for him.

&gt;&gt;&gt; You said:
&gt;&gt;&gt; |||  eavy play for the sole purpose of hurting me and humiliating
&gt;&gt;&gt; ||| -e in drunkeness is wholly unappealing and upsetting.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Can you hear today how *odd* that sounds?  ou were seriously, intentionally
&gt;&gt;&gt; beaten, apparently far beyond what you seem to consider your own boundaries, but
&gt;&gt;&gt; you refer to it only as &quot;unappealing.&quot;  ould you choose that word again today?
&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope not. I hope you'd describe it as &quot;totally and completely
&gt;&gt;&gt; unacceptable.&quot;[1]

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's up to you to protect yourself in the future.  f it means renegotiating
&gt;&gt;&gt; your relationship so that alcohol is completely off limits, do it.         f it means
&gt;&gt;&gt; locking the door between you and swallowing the key, do it.        f that means
&gt;&gt;&gt; calling the police if he comes back, do it.  hatever you need to do to keep
&gt;&gt;&gt; from repeating this episode, please do it.
&gt;&gt; A visit from the locksmith, at the very least, comes to mind.  The
&gt;&gt; best way to prevent another alcoholic beating and rape is to become
&gt;&gt; able to enforce the limits you choose.  That may--sad thought, I
&gt;&gt; know&lt;g&gt;--mean never being restrained in his presence again--should you
&gt;&gt; even choose to be in his presence again!  It might mean only playing
&gt;&gt; with him in public--should you even choose to play with him again.
&gt;&gt; Put 911 on speed-dial.  Only speak to him in public--and don't let
&gt;&gt; public charmingness lull you into thinking he's over it--if you
&gt;&gt; confront him about his behavior, he may decide to *really* teach you a
&gt;&gt; lesson, and he may be willing to wait for his chance.

&gt;&gt; But I think that if I had to take these steps, I'd probably decide to
&gt;&gt; go a step further and not see him, ever again.  Being constantly in
&gt;&gt; self-defense mode isn't fun, and it certainly isn't the sort of fun
&gt;&gt; we're looking to have in the BDSM world.

&gt;&gt; Hang in there, and do let us know how you're doing.  If you need a
&gt;&gt; phone number, just ask.  I'm guessing that you could get one from
&gt;&gt; every time zone in the world.

Everyone else has said things so much better than I could, but I'm just
weighing in to let you know that many of us share the same opinion.  Please,
at the very least don't let yourself be alone with him drunk, and
preferably don't be alone with him at all.

Psyquestor, what he did was not a scene, and he did not have sex with you.
He commited assault, battery, and then raped you. He needs to be arrested;
period, full stop.

I would also let your local kinky community, if any, know that he is not
a safe, sane person to play with. He could have killed or maimed you,
and potentialy anyone else he plays with.

As to the "he was drunk", the Romans and Greeks had a saying "In wine,
truth." In otherwords how a person acts when drunk may very well be how
that person really is on the inside...

I will remember you in my prayers, and only pray that that male (not
worthy of being called a man) gets his full and complete dose of karma,
and that right soon.

&gt;This weekend He came home after being away for a week. The first day
&gt;was nice, and we played a little. Afterwards I told him that I felt he
&gt;didn't push hard enough, (though it was awesome) that I was really in
&gt;the mood to be hurt.

&gt;The next day went badly for both of us; me having been called in to
&gt;work; Him trying to get caught up with other tasks. We didn't spend
&gt;much of that day together, and I was sad that we didn't. He was busy
&gt;fixing his truck and other nessesary tasks, so, not his fault.

&gt;The next day was my brother's B-day; He passed away in January; I
&gt;tried not to let it distract me too much from our last day together.
&gt;His group were all meeting up to play hockey for the last time this
&gt;season, so I put on my happy face and went to the game.

&gt;They all played well and went to the locker room to party after, like
&gt;always. I was fine for most of it, though I wasn't drinking and they
&gt;all were. I did let him know that it was my brothers birthday and I
&gt;was feeling a bit sad. He said we could go home after a few
&gt;more.....and yes he was drunk.

&gt;We sat in the hot tub for awhile and He was in an odd mood; an odd
&gt;drunk mood; kept discussing things I'd rather not. (his ex gf, her
&gt;dog, my mood, etc.) All very mood shattering since he was drunk and I
&gt;was not in a good mood to start off with.

&gt;Afterward He decided we were going to play; out of nowhere; he started
&gt;in with the tawse. I let him know that I was not really in the mood
&gt;for games. He was too drunk to notice I was not wanting heavy play
&gt;*now*. The other day? Yes, but not now. He bit my throat all over
&gt;until I was screaming...

&gt;He chained me to the wall, put a new gag in my mouth and grabbed the
&gt;zapper. He went straight for my nipples, no warm up whatsoever. He
&gt;continued with the tawse and also had the large wooden paddle. I put
&gt;up with these okay, but I was squirming too much. He put the gag in my
&gt;mouth (has a leather 'phallic' type thing rather than a ball) and tied
&gt;my ankles with rope. He reminded me far too many times about my
&gt;complaint the other day about not being 'hurt' enough. He used the
&gt;zapper on my nipples, the tawse and paddle on my ass - he counted off
&gt;twenty and then really started getting very rough...well, he was rough
&gt;the whole way through -

&gt;I was in enough pain that I could not stop to catch my breath and I
&gt;kept thrashing about - with PAIN being my only thought. No happy
&gt;place, no lust, no joy. It was at this point that I pulled the chains
&gt;out of the wall on one side. Apparently my adrenaline was going full
&gt;force, as this very long eye bolt came right out of the wooden stud.
&gt;It came out with enough force that when it hit his leg it caused him a
&gt;largish gash on his leg.
&gt;I kept asking him to stop, I removed the gag (the one he figured i
&gt;could not remove) and he was very upset.

&gt;He removed the remnants of the chain from my right wrist and secured
&gt;me to the chain on my left. He let me know how very unhappy he was and
&gt;zapped my nipples until i was certain they were ruined. He then took
&gt;out the candles and poured hot wax on them, only holding the candle
&gt;about three inches above my breasts. It burned and I could smell my
&gt;flesh - I began crying, with no other possible outlet. He didn't
&gt;notice at first, spun me around and poured more hot wax over my welted
&gt;ass - the whole time telling me how unhappy he was with me, how his
&gt;leg hurt and he didn't know how it was possible for me to pull that
&gt;chain/eye bolt out of the stud. He listed all my mistakes through the
&gt;night and mocked me saying how he hadn't 'hurt' me enough the other
&gt;night, so he was really going to hurt me now.

&gt;Upon discovering my tears, he unchained me, and we had sex.

&gt;He's gone again for another week. I'm not sure I'll be here when He
&gt;comes home.

&gt;Wanting heavy play when one is worked up to it is very nice. Heavy
&gt;play for the sole purpose of hurting me and humiliating me in
&gt;drunkeness is wholly unappealing and upsetting. Maybe I've
&gt;overreacted, maybe underreacted - but one thing is certain, I've lost
&gt;something huge this last week.

Time to beat feet darlin'.

This is such a huge violation of trust that at the very least you need
time and space.  More than one week to be sure.

There are rules that I feel to be nigh unto divine law, and he broke a
whole lot of them.

Lots of others have said similar things which I agree with: this is a
fuckup and a pointer to a person who will fuck up again.

But I wonder how easy it will be for you to forget the good times?
To meet up with him and to have him say he won't do it again, and to
push all the buttons that felt so good before all this happened?

I have no idea what he is thinking, how he'll react.  Whether he'll
conform to the "make up" pattern or to the "I'm the dom" pattern or some
other reaction entirely.

But you need to concentrate on what you want to do, because his hurt
and future are his - you can't take them on you.

If he does come back, your job isn't to make his life easier, to feel
his pain, and definitely not to take any responsibility for his actions,
not even if he says "you should have stopped me" and you find yourself
thinking about the times you should have said something.

If he does come back, then I suggest you meet him in a public place like
a cafe rather than a private place like your home or his.  That means
you both have to act like adults and talk quietly and not let the desire
for touch and emotion mean your higher faculties go out for a smoke.
(Note - I found that bloody awful when it was done to me, I wanted to
have a rant and get all emotional and upset and I couldn't.  Which was
probably a good thing.  Made me think instead of react.)

If he does want to keep the relationship up, then he has to convince
you that he knows exactly what went wrong.  Why he drank, why he drank
enough to overcome his knowledge of right and wrong, why he did things
he'd not have done sober.  Which are all the same question really: why
did he put himself in a situation where he hurt someone he was honour
bound to never harm?  Why did he put himself in a situation where he
could do jail time?  What was he thinking when he started drinking, what
was he thinking when he went home, why didn't he stop when he could have?

Why did he *choose* to do those things?  Every single step was a
deliberate choice he made.  Nothing and no-one made him do them, it was
all his own work.  The minute he says something different is the minute
you tell him to shape up or ship out.  Until he admits it was all his
chosen path, nothing will change.

And what is he going to do about it?  What steps will he take to make
sure it won't happen again?  Just saying "it won't" isn't good enough.
"When I have more than 2 beers, I won't go home with you, and if I want
to, then you must tell me no.  If I have not had any for 4 hours then
it is OK though." is the kind of thing you want if you ever want to do
BDSM with him again.  Or even be alone with him again.

Which you get to decide for yourself.  It's not his call.  He has
forfeited any rights, any consideration when he *chose* to do what he did.
You owe him nothing. Which might be really hard to remember when you
meet him again.

It isn't your job to psychoanalyse him either.  If he starts telling you
how he was carried away and he doesn't know why and so on, it is probably
all quite true to him but nothing to do with you.... because you can't
cure him and you can't change him.  Only he can.  And you have to be
sure he has a handle on why he did what he did, and a very good handle
on how he will prevent himself from ever doing anything like that again
before you allow him to have the chance to do it again.

He put himself in the situation of being an abuser who had a very good
chance of hurting someone, and of doing time for it.  Which would ruin his
life, cost him his job and a deal of money.  He *chose* to do horrific
things to a friend, he *chose* to hurt someone for his own pleasure.
He *decided* to do those things.  He did that all on his lonesome,
until he works out why, and how he can make sure he doesn't do it again,
then he's an accident waiting to happen.

An accident that's not your reponsibility, not your problem.  You aren't
required to fix him, you aren't required to even listen to him or
see him.  If you do, it is on your own terms and he has to understand
that straight up.  Please be solid about that - if he tries to do it
any other way, run a mile.

Because there were good times before, and I don't think you'd be human
if you didn't want them back.  It will be hard to not want them back
if they are offered.

I spoke with him for a short while yesterday before going off to work.
I asked him if he was drunk (this night) and he replied that he wasn't
'very' drunk. I really wasn't feeling very talkative and didnt' bring
up the 'scene' but he felt I was unhappy about him talking about his
ex in the hot tub. This upset me more and I hung up.

I text messaged him a short while later saying that I was leaving and
would be gone by the time he arrived home. I spoke again with him
later and he brought up our 'play' and I told him that no I didn't
enjoy it and I was still quite upset that we could talk in the
morning.

I spoke with him briefly before going to work this morning. I stated
again that I had been very unhappy and that I am leaving. I told him
that he hurt me and that I didn't know that this kind of hurt was
something I would ever (ever) get over. He doesn't remember
threatening my face except with the zapper once and he said "i was
kidding" "i would never hurt your face." This does not reassure me and
I can't understand him saying "kidding" in reference to that. He has
promised never to go that far again, claims to be an ass and says he
doesn't blame me for wanting to leave.

That's good because I don't see how I could possibly stay.

To answer everyone, no there isn't any support or kink aware places
anywhere near here. I have no one to discuss this with (except him)
and the group. I'm still very 'numb' from this whole thing and I'll
probably take a few days and get away. My brother has a place in the
sunny climes, I'll most likely go there. It will also help to be away
when He comes back.

Thank you for your support and understanding; I really nevr thought
that this relationship could ever turn this way...even knowing all the
things I know. It was a huge thing for me to give up my 'control' in
the first place, only to have it turned on me like a weapon.

*sigh*

&gt; I have no idea what he is thinking, how he'll react.  Whether he'll
&gt; conform to the &quot;make up&quot; pattern or to the &quot;I'm the dom&quot; pattern or some
&gt; other reaction entirely.

&gt; But you need to concentrate on what you want to do, because his hurt
&gt; and future are his - you can't take them on you.

&gt; If he does come back, your job isn't to make his life easier, to feel
&gt; his pain, and definitely not to take any responsibility for his actions,
&gt; not even if he says &quot;you should have stopped me&quot; and you find yourself
&gt; thinking about the times you should have said something.

&gt; If he does come back, then I suggest you meet him in a public place like
&gt; a cafe rather than a private place like your home or his.  That means
&gt; you both have to act like adults and talk quietly and not let the desire
&gt; for touch and emotion mean your higher faculties go out for a smoke.
&gt; (Note - I found that bloody awful when it was done to me, I wanted to
&gt; have a rant and get all emotional and upset and I couldn't.  Which was
&gt; probably a good thing.  Made me think instead of react.)

&gt; If he does want to keep the relationship up, then he has to convince
&gt; you that he knows exactly what went wrong.  Why he drank, why he drank
&gt; enough to overcome his knowledge of right and wrong, why he did things
&gt; he'd not have done sober.  Which are all the same question really: why
&gt; did he put himself in a situation where he hurt someone he was honour
&gt; bound to never harm?  Why did he put himself in a situation where he
&gt; could do jail time?  What was he thinking when he started drinking, what
&gt; was he thinking when he went home, why didn't he stop when he could have?

&gt; Why did he *choose* to do those things?  Every single step was a
&gt; deliberate choice he made.  Nothing and no-one made him do them, it was
&gt; all his own work.  The minute he says something different is the minute
&gt; you tell him to shape up or ship out.  Until he admits it was all his
&gt; chosen path, nothing will change.

&gt; And what is he going to do about it?  What steps will he take to make
&gt; sure it won't happen again?  Just saying &quot;it won't&quot; isn't good enough.
&gt; &quot;When I have more than 2 beers, I won't go home with you, and if I want
&gt; to, then you must tell me no.  If I have not had any for 4 hours then
&gt; it is OK though.&quot; is the kind of thing you want if you ever want to do
&gt; BDSM with him again.  Or even be alone with him again.

&gt; Which you get to decide for yourself.  It's not his call.  He has
&gt; forfeited any rights, any consideration when he *chose* to do what he did.
&gt; You owe him nothing. Which might be really hard to remember when you
&gt; meet him again.

&gt; It isn't your job to psychoanalyse him either.  If he starts telling you
&gt; how he was carried away and he doesn't know why and so on, it is probably
&gt; all quite true to him but nothing to do with you.... because you can't
&gt; cure him and you can't change him.  Only he can.  And you have to be
&gt; sure he has a handle on why he did what he did, and a very good handle
&gt; on how he will prevent himself from ever doing anything like that again
&gt; before you allow him to have the chance to do it again.

&gt; He put himself in the situation of being an abuser who had a very good
&gt; chance of hurting someone, and of doing time for it.  Which would ruin his
&gt; life, cost him his job and a deal of money.  He *chose* to do horrific
&gt; things to a friend, he *chose* to hurt someone for his own pleasure.
&gt; He *decided* to do those things.  He did that all on his lonesome,
&gt; until he works out why, and how he can make sure he doesn't do it again,
&gt; then he's an accident waiting to happen.

&gt; An accident that's not your reponsibility, not your problem.  You aren't
&gt; required to fix him, you aren't required to even listen to him or
&gt; see him.  If you do, it is on your own terms and he has to understand
&gt; that straight up.  Please be solid about that - if he tries to do it
&gt; any other way, run a mile.

&gt; Because there were good times before, and I don't think you'd be human
&gt; if you didn't want them back.  It will be hard to not want them back
&gt; if they are offered.

psyquestor, I am so sorry. *offers hugs* I wish there was something more
I could do to help other than be supportive words on the screen. Does it
help to hear that you're doing the right thing? In my opinion, you are.
And I think you're doing the right thing to go away for a while -- it
might be wise also, at some point, to consider (if possible, not knowing
your circumstances) returning to somewhere where he won't be. Perhaps
sell/lease your current place and find another one? Or, if that's not
possible, I agree with whoever suggested that you change the locks. Have
a policeman come over while he gets his stuff, and have the locksmith
there immediately afterwards. The police are used to such requests.

It sucks that this happened to you -- I don't know what else to say. I
know what it's like to feel safe and then suddenly, not be safe, and
yeah, it does take a while to process all of that. I do think that
you're making all the right decisions now, but I know that it probably
feels sudden. It is sudden. But that's ok too. It sounds like you're
considering permanently ending the relationship. That's probably a good
call.

If you'd like to talk to me in real time I have Yahoo chat, otherwise my
email always gets to me.

Remember to breathe, remember to eat, remember to sleep, and remember
that you're doing the right thing by taking care of yourself.

I don't have a safe word, He has never given me one. He decides when
we've pushed me too far. I had a gag in place so a safe word would not
have worked anyway.

When I took out the gag I asked him to stop and had asked several
times. This was met with him reminding me that I wanted to be hurt.
After I started crying he released me he asked if this was not what I
wanted and I replied no, it wasn't. He asked me what I wanted and I
just shook my head, there was nothing I could say.

It's just good to hear from you.

To repeat myself:  please make sure you get medical attention
immediately if you need it at all, and that you pay careful attention to
the burns;  the ONLY consideration in the decision to seek care should
be your health and comfort.  (If money is short, you should rightfully
send the bills to him.)

The decision to leave can be such a hard one to carry through, but you
show great strength and sense in making the choice to care properly for
yourself rather than to let yourself stay in a situation that seems both
unhealthy and seriously dangerous for you (mentally and phyically).

Your trust and submission are precious things;  I am glad you value
yourself enough to not see them trashed.

Take care, and keep in touch (either on-group or in email or phone) as
you can, please.

-- Troia

That does rather show a complete misunderstanding of what you get out
of it on his part.

I hope there are proto-doms reading this...  so they realise that if
they don't understand what their partner wants and why, and when...
then they need to.  BEcause otherwise it could be them harming someone
they care about and no idea why it all went wrong.

Alcohol doesn't have to be involved.

It is likely to be a hard time dealing psyquestor, breakups and loss
of trust are never easy.  Even if they aren't as traumatic as yours.

You might find emailing stream-of-consciousness or other rants to
people theraputic and less longlived than posting them here.  Feel
free to email to me if you think it would help.

I'm thinking you were a little shocky at that point, psy, and not able to think
coherently at all.

I've lived with a real sadist in a 24/7 Master/slave relationship where I had no
safeword, but before I committed to it we discussed in *great* depth what our
respective limits were.  Part of his promise to me was that no matter what else
was going on, if I ever felt *genuinely* afraid for my life or my long-term
safely I was to do whatever was necessary to get away from him, since it would
be obvious at that point that he had lost his mind and was no longer sane.

Your guy doesn't sound real "sane" in the  "normal [kinky] human responses"
sense of the word.

Um, how often does this guy drink?  And how much does he drink?  Perhaps I'm

I originally apologized for not knowing your personal history with this man, so
I did a little research.  I read your January 26 post titled "When I knew"
(Message-ID: &lt;1169821969.951572.241 ... @q2g2000cwa.googlegroups.com&gt;), and I
absolutely shivered with the same excitement you conveyed.  It was *precisely*
the same response I had when I was courting and being courted by the 24/7 guy I
mentioned a moment ago:  "ohmigod, I may have finally met the exact man of my
dreams and needs!"  Wet-making from the first tentative reaching out.  I grok it
completely.

Then I researched a little further, and I found this from you just four days
later (February 1):

|||    OMG freaky coincidence. . . we were playing the other night
|||    and I explained to him I was too cold to play. I wont get
|||    turned on or in the mind set I need to be in if I'm cold. He
|||    on the other hand was raring to go. So he did, and I didn't.
|||    I was wholly unhappy with the whole thing as He was finally
|||    trying heavier play (as requested) at a very bad time.
|||
|||    So now I'm back at ground zero. He'll back off again and I'll
|||    get frustrated again.

Hindsight is really terrific; I don't think any of us gave this post the weight
it deserved, mostly because most of us have had mistimed events over the years.
The part that concerns me in retrospect, though, is the wistfulness of the last
sentence.

I'm now looking at all of this as involving someone who had done some amount of
mildly kinky play, who may have an abusive history of his own, who clearly
doesn't understand the difference between play and abuse, who may use alcohol as
an excuse to indulge in violence. and who is quite unwilling to take
responsibility for his actions.  I don't think this is fixable, alas.

It's especially hard to let go of a relationship that seemed so perfect,
especially in terms of getting one's kinky needs met.  Without going into
details (they're available if anyone wants them, but this post isn't about me),
I'll just say that I know from gut-wrenching experience how hard it is to have
to give up on a relationship because the person isn't who you thought he is.

Please be strong.  Protect yourself physically at all costs.  Let us know if any
of us can help; most of us are reachable by email and will happily share a phone
number with you.  And keep us aware of how you're doing, please.

How about the safeword glare that says "if you don't stop that shit RIGHT
FUCKING NOW you'd better never set me loose because I will kill you. And
enjoy doing it."

psyquestor, everyone has a safeword. Sometimes it's not formalized as such
but it's there. If the relationship doesn't include a formal safeword,
there's a line that the top had better not cross. To my mind, he crossed
that line at the hockey game where he got drunk and didn't respond
appropriately to your distress over your brother's birthday. That
transgression alone would have called for major amounts of heart examination
and grovelling.

Everything after that point moved into the "unforgivable" category for me.
Maybe not for you, which I hope will give you pause for thought. I've been
told by more than one of my long term partners that I'm easy going, not
fussy and not picky about ordinary stuff like anniversaries, birthdays, etc.
But what he did crossed a line that would have had me homicidal. If it
doesn't set off big alarms in your head, maybe it's time to examine what is
happening in your head.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When I took out the gag I asked him to stop and had asked several

He didn't just remind you you'd said you wanted to be hurt the day before.
He mocked you for being honest with him. That alone was a huge transgression
of boundaries. How can you be honest with him if part of you is wondering
whether he will turn it against you at some future point?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; After I started crying he released me he asked if this was not what I
&gt; wanted and I replied no, it wasn't. He asked me what I wanted and I

And then he had sex with you???!!

Please step back and seriously re-consider whether you ever want to see him
again. What would you say if it were your sister telling you this stuff?

It sounds to me like he's been through this before... with another partner.
What he's doing is setting things up so that he can spin them as "we had a
misunderstanding."

I used to work with victims of domestic violence (a paid job, not
volunteer). I heard many, many variations of the above. I didn't believe it
then and I don't believe it now. "We had a misunderstanding" is what fits
his forgetting that you were going out somewhere fancy for dinner Saturday
night when he shows up sweaty and filthy from deciding to clean out the
garage. Not something like this.

You know, it wasn't until Shirley said this that a light bulb went on. I
think you're right, Shirley. My ex used to manipulate and abuse me into
agreeing that screaming at me, throwing things at me, locking me out of
the house was 'a misunderstanding'. I *knew* something about what he
said to psyquestor didn't ring true to me.

It wasn't until I got out of there that I could see it clearly, though.

I agree with you also that as reported by psyquestor, I didn't 'hear'
one single word of apology, real or fake. His reaction seems to think
that *he* thinks it's no big deal, which makes me want to puke, and then
go after him with some of my weapons and a few of my marine buddies.

Ugh.

That's stock in trade for anyone who wants to unethically manipulate someone
else--convince that person to agree (or even better, to argue for) the
interpretation that favours the manipulator.

He majorly fucked up when he was drunk, then he was "not very drunk"
when he went to talk about having majorly fucked up.
This does not bode well.
Drinking to screw up the courage to talk about having messed up big
time when he was drinking is a thing I have seen before.  It is like
the person doing it believes that the nonsense they will spout will be
more believable through an alcoholic haze, and it is, but only to
them.  Unfortunately it usually leads tomore drinking because "nobody
understands me" and etc.

You cannot stay.
He violated your trust in a huge way and not only is he refusing to
acknowledge that, he is trying to shift the focus to details.  Do not
let yourself be drawn into a conversation wherby he gets to go over
every tiny detail while taking it out of context of the larger
picture.  That way lies madness.
It's not him saying he was kidding about doing your face that gives me
the heebies, it is his saying he is an ass and doesn't blame you for
wanting to leave.  That is such a classic abuser statment, at least in
the first half of an abusive relationship.  Next comes "you never
really loved me", " you were just using me", "you lied to me".
Do not be a sucker for emotional blackmail, I would bet good money it
is coming.

Also do inform the cops that there is a domestic situation and you are
going away for a while.  That way you are covered if you need to

It seems to me that the "something huge" you've lost is not
the man or the relationship - he sounds like someone who
has issues with alcohol abuse and a lack of responsibility
that make him less than a prize to agonize over "losing" -
but the illusion of "slavery" as part of your scening.  It
