learning sign language one PM at a time

Posted: 26 Sep 2007 04:15 AM CDT

Who knew learning sign language could be this easy or hilarious? Here's a look
at how to say 'Olmert' in Hebrew sign language:

True story, blogger
&lt; http://www.frgdr.com/blog/2007/09/24/learn-olmert-sign-language/ &gt; frgdr noticed
this oh-so-appropriate sign language on the bottom-right corner of his TV
screen.

Shake it  &lt; http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Israelplug/~3/161147098/ &gt; up for
Sukkot

Posted: 25 Sep 2007 11:55 AM CDT

Sukkot lulav
&lt; http://israelplug.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/lulav.jpg &gt; Yet
another Jewish holiday is upon us, and this time it's Sukkot. The practices
related to this week of celebration are probably among the strangest offered by
Judaism: we build wobbly huts that have leaves or twigs as roofs, and eat and
sleep in them for seven days. We also make sure to shake a combination of palm
fronds (whatever they are), myrtle (whatever that is), hyssop (ditto), and etrog
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etrog &gt;  (obviously).

Yes, we shake it, ok? I mean, what else would you do if you were holding a
hyssop and palm frond?

Anyways, of course there is deep meaning behind all of this, which you can find
out about on Wikipedia &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot &gt; 's Sukkot entry, or
in other
&lt; http://www.google.co.il/search?q=sukkot&amp;ie;=utf-8&amp;oe;=utf-8&amp;aq;=t&amp;rls;=or...
en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&gt; places. Or, it really comes down to the usual
reason we Jews hold any celebration:

&quot;They oppressed us, we survived. Let's eat.&quot;

True. I gotta start cooking.

Check out this video on the shaking that goes on during this holy holiday. Chag
sameach!

Lets eat. At least your celebrations have an interesting twist to them. ;-)

Dancing  &lt; http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Israelplug/~3/163207652/ &gt; to the Stars

Posted: 30 Sep 2007 04:05 AM CDT

Sally Anne Friedland
&lt; http://israelplug.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/sally-anne... &gt; When
Sally Anne Friedland got THE phone call in the summer of 2005, she hit payola.
Artistic director and choreographer of Israel's Dance Drama Company (DDC),
Friedland was being invited to present her troupe at a prestigious Manhattan
dance event - an invite she says resulted from a chance, New York layover the
year before.

&quot;I stopped into the 92nd Street Y dance offices and dropped off a tape of my
dance troupe performing,&quot; Friedland recalls. &quot;I hoped someone would view the
material and be impressed enough to invite us to the annual showcase.&quot;

Months later the telephone rang and months after that, her company was off to
the 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Festival - an annual event featuring top tier,
expressionist, dance-multimedia, modern and dance drama companies hailing from
the U.S. and now Israel. Funded by heavy hitters like Capezio, The Village Voice
and The Harkness Foundation, the festival relocated in recent years to
Manhattan's prestigious Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theater.

&quot;It was unbelievable,&quot; claims Sally-Anne of the experience.

South African-born Friedland grew up in a liberal household during the apartheid
era and began studying dance at age three. She danced with Capetown's ballet
company and at twenty-two traveled to Europe where she caught the &quot;modern dance
bug&quot; via exposure to performances and classes. But her background remained at
the fore.

&quot;Here was this well known, Martha Graham teacher in Germany teaching class and
she was a black woman! I'd never seen anything like it before. The blacks in
South Africa were servants. Here, we danced with them and ate with them,&quot;
Friedland recounts. &quot;It was amazing.&quot;

She returned to Capetown for a brief stint and then made her way to Israel and
settled in Tel Aviv. She started a family, carved a name for herself as a dancer
and in 2001 seamlessly transitioned to the role of dance architect.

&quot;When I started creating, I was starting from zero,&quot; Friedland relays. &quot;I had to
go inside, dig deep and find out what my dance is. This is my thing and these
are my ideas. I take the layers from the library in my mind and when I start to
work physically, they come out in stories. I'm communicating through dance.&quot;

In August she celebrated five years of choreographic creation with a gala event
at Tel Aviv's Suzanne Delal Center. Celebrities and friends turned up to view
her company's hallmark Red and her most recent Concerto for 4 Dancers and
Orchestra incorporating dancers and Raanana Symphony Orchestra members on the
same stage.

At that gala, Eli Mizrachi - a fellow judge alongside Friedland on Israel's
popular &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; television series - sent her a congratulatory
SMS message; She was sitting on the backstage steps maintaining a low profile.
&quot;I didn't really mingle with the audience so I'm not sure who was out there,&quot;
she confides.

What does the future hold? Friedland recently completed work on Bereysheet
Children's show - a traveling event for 5-8-year-olds showing throughout Israel
during the September holidays. In 2008 she'll debut new works.

Until then, mum's the word.

AT &lt; http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Israelplug/~3/164139293/ &gt; &amp;T buys its first
Israeli company

Posted: 02 Oct 2007 05:58 AM CDT

&lt; http://www.att.com &gt; AT&amp;TAT&amp;T is buying its first Israeli company: Interwise
&lt; http://www.interwise.com/ &gt; , a web conferencing solutions company. The price:
$121m. While this may seem like a windfall for Interwise, it's not really a
great deal for the company's investors, who've poured nearly $100m into the
company in 5 financing rounds over 13 years. According to Haaretz.com
&lt; http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/908888.html &gt; , some shareholders won't even
cover their original investment. You win some, you lose some.

Once the deal is completed, Interwise will operate as a business unit within
AT&amp;T Global Business Services, and the R&amp;D center will continue to operate here
in Israel at Airport City.

Interwise started out as a supplier of software services, later specializing in
e-learning. They almost folded in 2003 after the dot-com bubble, but managed to
come out of the crisis with a new business model, leading to increased revenues
and eventually breaking even in 2005. Interwise provides a single platform for
virtual web meetings, long-distance learning, seminars and broadcasting over the
web.

According to Red Herring &lt; http://www.redherring.com/Home/22899 &gt; , this purchase
by AT&amp;T is the latest of three such purchases by large firms, demonstrating the
growing interest in IP-based conferencing:

Not long ago voice, video, and web conferencing were distinctly separate
technologies that required fairly extensive user expertise to operate.

But firms such as WebEx and Interwise have managed to simplify, stabilize, and
integrate multimedia conferencing on IP networks to the point where the market
has grown considerably over the last few years.

&quot;Conferencing is no longer something just for executives,&quot; said Frank Zvi, CEO
of Interwise. &quot;Voice, video, and web conferencing is now given to everybody
within the company just like email.&quot;

Research firm Frost &amp; Sullivan estimates that the overall multimedia IP
conferencing market in 2007 will generate $5.9 billion worldwide.

Interwise investors include: Lazard Technology Partners, GE Capital, UBS
Capital, NTT, Accenture Technology Ventures, GIMV, Leeds Equity Partners, STI
Ventures, Challenge-Etgar Fund, J.P. Morgan, SAP, Texas Pacific Group,
Shrem-Fudim-Kelner, Link Technologies Venture Capital, and Jim Manzi, former
president of Lotus (from Haaretz.com
&lt; http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/908888.html &gt; ).

the holidays. Projects would be delayed, ulpans would be cancelled, and work
would be optional. But things have changed, and thanks to Facebook and new
networking websites, there is more going on this month than fingers to count on,

Multinational  &lt; http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Israelplug/~3/164633947/ &gt;
conglomerate 3M to expand activities in Israel

Posted: 03 Oct 2007 05:19 AM CDT

3M
&lt; http://israelplug.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/3m_worldwi... &gt;
Apparently, 3M &lt; http://www.3m.com/ &gt;  is about more than just Post-it
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_note &gt;  notes and Scotch Tape
&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_Tape &gt;  (there ain't nothing that can't be
fixed with a little Scotch Tape!), and its Israeli office is experiencing
significant growth.

In 2006, the Israeli branch of 3M grew by 35%, and as a result 3M announced that
it would be expanding its business here.

The
&lt; http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1191257217142&amp;pagename;=JPo...
icle%2FShowFull&gt; Jerusalem Post quoted 3M's Director of Europe Industrial
Business, Robin Torgerson, as saying the following about Israel:

&quot;The business professionals in 3M Israel have an excellent understanding of
which market segments it can best serve with unique 3M solutions - ones that
help the Israeli customer be more successful.&quot;

3M established its Israel subsidiary, 3M
&lt; http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_WW/Profile/About/IL/Israel-EN/ &gt;
Israel, in 1996, although the company has been selling products in Israel for
over 20 years. 3M Israel serves customers in a diverse range of markets
including:

*       Industrial and Manufacturing - providing abrasives, adhesives and tapes

*       Transportation, Graphics and Safety - reflective materials, brightness
enhancement films for computers, ScotchprintR Graphics, ThinsulateT Thermal
Insulation, and products that enhance worker and public safety

*       Health Care - works with doctors, nurses and other health care
professionals to supply products for infection prevention, dental and skin
health.

*       Office and Consumer - Post-itR Notes, ScotchR Tapes, ScotchbriteT and O
Cel OT Sponges

*       Automotive, Marine and Aerospace

*       Electro &amp; Communications - helping customers in electrical, electronics
and telecommunication businesses.

*       Specialty Materials - including ScotchgardT Fabric Protector, and a wide
range of fluorochemicals including alternatives to ozone-depleting substances
such as CFCs.

Aerospace, shmaerospace. These guys invented the Post-it Note!

3M Israel employs 40 people, and its offices are located in Herzeliya.
