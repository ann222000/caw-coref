A report in the &quot;Harvard Men's Health Watch&quot; speaks of the problems
that men have in deciding how to take their doctor's advice. It's
frustrating . . . Your doctor tells you to take one Advil or an Aleve
daily to help stave off the seemingly inevitable enlarged prostate,
and then you find that the frequent urination you are experiencing
comes because you took your doctor's advice.

Well, as it turns out, these common anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID's)
may indeed lower the risk of developing an enlarged prostate, just as
the doctor said. The problem is that researchers are discovering there
are some effects of this treatment that are unintended, and annoying.
Men who already have the urinary symptoms can be adversely affected by
NSAID's.

Prostate enlargement, known as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), is
common among older men. The condition is unrelated to prostate cancer,
but it does cause troubling symptoms such as difficulty with emptying
the bladder completely and the frequent need to use the toilet.

According to the Harvard publication, it's known that certain
medications, most commonly cold and allergy remedies, can make BPH
symptoms worse. Now, a large study in the Netherlands recently
implicated NSAIDs as another cause of worsening BPH.

Using data from 5,900 men age 45 and older, researchers found that men
using NSAIDs were twice as likely as non-users to develop acute
urinary retention (a sudden inability to empty the bladder). And yet,
at the same time, the findings from a recent U.S. study of more than
2,400 men with no history of urological problems show that those who
regularly used NSAIDs were less likely to develop BPH.

In men who already have BPH, the painkillers may worsen urinary
symptoms because they block production of chemicals called
prostaglandins; the bladder produces prostaglandins to enhance
contractions of surrounding muscles, and blocking this process may
make it even harder for men with BPH to empty their bladders.

On the other hand, there's evidence that inflammation contributes to
the development of BPH, so NSAIDs may help prevent the condition.

The Harvard publication recommends that men who already have BPH
should pay attention to whether their symptoms increase when taking an
NSAID. If this does happen, they should tell their doctor, and
possibly switch to acetaminophen (Tylenol) for pain relief.

I disagreee with a point or two  and have a suggestion of two.
First, consider what meds you are taking. The PPI meds
can raise estrogen levels and cause or worsen BPH.
Other meds can raise E or suppress T.

Those who focus on the suppression of DHT miss
the point it is the hormone needed to maintain
the prostate and suppressing it can and often
does result in sexual problems. Some drugs
may help keep a full head of hair by DHT suppression
but they can also shut off your sexual abilities and
quitting the med won't result in their return at least
for sure.

There is some merit to the alternative remedies the improve
the excretion and of metabolization of estradiol which
is hard on the prostate.
Pumpkins seeds are mildly helpful. And there
is a list of herbs that should help. Some aren't used
much i.e. chrysin and some are i.e. saw palmetto.
A truly generous dose of vitamin D is something you
should consider if you are a man a prostate cancer
preventative.

Too much DHEA will be made into estrogens and
inflame the prostate. I would supplement with
more than 25 milligrams and even then
have some doubts.

NSAIDs can raise blood pressure.

If Tylenol is taken too regularly it can be damaging
to the kidneys. If you drink don't take Tylenol
or it generic competitors.

Drink what?  within any specific period of taking Tylenol?
Why?  Because excess drinking can also cause kidney problems?

Some have proposed that about 6-8 Oz of red wine can be helpful to kidneys
and or Prostate problems.   Have you heard of that?  Other than increasing
urinary flow, (usually a good thing) I can't guess why.
