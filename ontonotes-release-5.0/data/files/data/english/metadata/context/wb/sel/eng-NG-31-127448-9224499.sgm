These are not intended to be provocative questions, they are intended to
help me understand the thinking behind Fundamentalism.

1) Where in the Bible does it actually say that the Bible has to be taken
literally?

2) Literal interpretation of the Bible was never part of mainstream
Christianity - at least as far back as Augustine - until the formation of
the Fundamentalist movement in the early 20th century. Was the mainstream
Church therefore in error for at least 1500 years?

3) Jesus used parables a lot. Why can we accept His words as allegorical but
not the words of Genesis?

They assume so.
If you read a biology or physics or history textbook, where does it
actually say that it has to be taken literally?

Maybe the &quot;Fundamentalist movement&quot;, whatever it is, was formed in the
early 20th century, but fundamentalism was very much older. In fact, I
think it is as old as religion is.

If you ask a Jehovah's Witnesses he or she will say yes, and many
other Christian denominations (including the RCC) also mantain that
they are the only surviving form of true Christianity and all the
others are perversions.

The parables are quite clearly reported as allegorical stories, while
this doesn't seem to be the case for the myths in the Old Testament.
Anyway, what do you think the six-day creation, the flood and the
exodus could be allegories for?

And I reccomend this book, which gives a selection of how the Bible
was interpreted, in the couple of centuries late BCE to early CE:

James L. Kugel
The Bible As It Was
Cambridge, Mass: Belknap Press of Harvard U. Press, 1997

Literalism is conspicuously absent.

The usual response is that it is obvious when parables are being
used.

I think that the six-day creation could be argued as allegorical for the
fact that the world neither existed for ever nor came into being instantly,
that it went through a series of phases. To that extent, it is broadly
compatible with both the Big Bang and Evolution; I accept that the detail is
way off but that is not surprising in an oral tradition handed down through
generations.

I think that the Flood could be regarded as allegorical for the rapid
expansion of life forms in the Cambrain period.

I have no particular thoughts on the Exodus.

Literal interpretation got a big boost from the Reformation. The
Catholic church always maintained that the church was the final
authority on religious questions - giving absolute authority to the
Bible would dilute church power. A major feature of the Reformation
was the rejection of church authority, and the infallible authority
(which is a common feature of religions) was shifted to the Bible.

A move back to the authority of the Bible was a central point of the
Reformation but I'm not sure that literal interpretation was so important.

When Luther translated the Bible into German he said &quot; &quot;It is not possible
to reproduce a foreign idiom in one's native tongue. The proper method of
translation is to select the most fitting terms according to the usage of
the language adopted. To translate properly is to render the spirit of a
foreign language into our own idiom. I try to speak as men do in the market
place. In rendering Moses, I make him so German that no one would suspect he
was a Jew.&quot;

Here's a passage if you believe Jesus:

John 8 (New International Version)
New International Version (NIV)
Copyright © 1973, 1978, 1984 by International Bible Society

John 8
1But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2At dawn he appeared again in
the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he
sat down to teach them. 3The teachers of the law and the Pharisees
brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the
group 4and said to Jesus, &quot;Teacher, this woman was caught in the act
of adultery. 5In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now
what do you say?&quot; 6They were using this question as a trap, in order
to have a basis for accusing him.

But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his
finger. 7When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and
said to them, &quot;If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first
to throw a stone at her.&quot; 8Again he stooped down and wrote on the
ground.

9At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older
ones first, until only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing
there. 10Jesus straightened up and asked her, &quot;Woman, where are they?
Has no one condemned you?&quot;

11&quot;No one, sir,&quot; she said.
&quot;Then neither do I condemn you,&quot; Jesus declared. &quot;Go now and
leave your life of sin.&quot;

I read a theologian who said that the six days represent a sixfold
reiteration of the 'fact of God's creation.'

He is a theistic evolutionist, citing the fact that God commanded the
earth to bring forth life.

16All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
correcting and training in righteousness, 17so that the man of God may
be thoroughly equipped for every good work.

How do you decide which version of a story is to take literally? How
did Judas die? Why is the field where he died called &quot;the field of
blood&quot;?

If the different passages on this subject are &quot;God-breathed&quot; and both
versions cannot be taken literally simultaneously, then &quot;God-breathed&quot;
cannot mean &quot;take it literally&quot;.

Making the Bible the central authority does not require literalism,
but I think it tends to promote it. If the Bible is central it is
important to know what it means. If there is no accepted authority to
say what that meaning is you have conflict. One way to resolve that is
to say (as many people do) &quot;it means just what it says&quot;

I have heard the idea that the basic point of the Gen. 1 creation
story is to emphasize the absolute, limitless power of God. Other
creation stories from the same area/time frequently have a god/gods
creating the world by taming and ordering an existing chaos, not by
creation from nothing, which gives him/her/them a more limited place
in the cosmos. (Milton also refers to creation from chaos in Paradise
Lost, although this was generally regarded as heresy at the time).

They may also have started as stories of real events, which grew
larger over time (pretty standard for oral tradition). Somebody in
Mesopotamia builds a big raft and rides out a flood with his family
and livestock. A group of slaves run off and the troops sent after
them get caught in a flash flood in a narrow canyon just after the
slaves get through. Enough retelling over the years and you have the
Flood and the Exodus.

Actually this passage is not in early manuscripts of John.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericope_Adulter%C3%A6

The bible is similar to the United States Constitution in the way it
is intended to be read.  Sometimes a literal interpretation is
implied.
Such as:  Exodus 20:13  Thou shalt not kill
Article II &quot;...neither shall any person be eligible to
that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five
years...&quot;

Sometimes the interpretation is implied
Such As:  Luke 22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it,
and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for
you:                  this do in remembrance of me.
Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 The Congress shall have
power . . . To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the
several states, and with the Indian tribes;

The trick is in figuring out what the passage is requiring of you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Actually this passage is not in early manuscripts of John. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericope_Adulter%C3%A6

&gt; The bible is similar to the United States Constitution in the way it
&gt; is intended to be read.  Sometimes a literal interpretation is
&gt; implied.
&gt; Such as:  Exodus 20:13  Thou shalt not kill
&gt;                Article II &quot;...neither shall any person be eligible to
&gt; that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five
&gt; years...&quot;

&gt; Sometimes the interpretation is implied
&gt; Such As:  Luke 22:19 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it,
&gt; and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for
&gt; you:                  this do in remembrance of me.
&gt;                 Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 The Congress shall have
&gt; power . . . To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the
&gt; several states, and with the Indian tribes;

&gt; The trick is in figuring out what the passage is requiring of you.

The real trick, then, is finding out if a passage has always been a
part of the Bible. How can the first few chapters of Genesis be taken
literally if you don't know that it was supposed to be there when they
started writing down tales?

&gt; &gt; Here's a passage if you believe Jesus:

&gt; &gt; John 8 (New International Version)
&gt; &gt; New International Version (NIV)
&gt; &gt; Copyright © 1973, 1978, 1984 by International Bible Society

&gt; &gt; John 8
&gt; &gt;  1But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2At dawn he appeared again in
&gt; &gt; the temple courts, where all the people gathered around him, and he
&gt; &gt; sat down to teach them. 3The teachers of the law and the Pharisees
&gt; &gt; brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the
&gt; &gt; group 4and said to Jesus, &quot;Teacher, this woman was caught in the act
&gt; &gt; of adultery. 5In the Law Moses commanded us to stone such women. Now
&gt; &gt; what do you say?&quot; 6They were using this question as a trap, in order
&gt; &gt; to have a basis for accusing him.

&gt; &gt;    But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his
&gt; &gt; finger. 7When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and
&gt; &gt; said to them, &quot;If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first

&gt; &gt; [...]

&gt; &gt; &gt; The parables are quite clearly reported as allegorical stories, while
&gt; &gt; &gt; this doesn't seem to be the case for the myths in the Old Testament.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, what do you think the six-day creation, the flood and the
&gt; &gt; &gt; exodus could be allegories for?

&gt; &gt; I think that the six-day creation could be argued as allegorical for the
&gt; &gt; fact that the world neither existed for ever nor came into being instantly,
&gt; &gt; that it went through a series of phases. To that extent, it is broadly
&gt; &gt; compatible with both the Big Bang and Evolution; I accept that the detail is
&gt; &gt; way off but that is not surprising in an oral tradition handed down through
&gt; &gt; generations.

&gt; I have heard the idea that the basic point of the Gen. 1 creation
&gt; story is to emphasize the absolute, limitless power of God. Other
&gt; creation stories from the same area/time frequently have a god/gods
&gt; creating the world by taming and ordering an existing chaos, not by
&gt; creation from nothing, which gives him/her/them a more limited place
&gt; in the cosmos. (Milton also refers to creation from chaos in Paradise
&gt; Lost, although this was generally regarded as heresy at the time).
">

In the Genesis account, God creates Adam form clay, Eve from Adam's
rib and has to rest afterwards.
He also appears not to know where Adam and Eve are after they ate the
fruit of knowledge, and discusses with himself (actually with the
other gods of the Elohim, in the original interpetation) about banning
Adam and Eve from the Eden to prevent them from eating the fruit of
life because if they ate both fruits they would had become gods.

It really doesn't seem a story about the omnipotence of God.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I think that the Flood could be regarded as allegorical for the rapid
&gt; &gt; expansion of life forms in the Cambrain period.

&gt; &gt; I have no particular thoughts on the Exodus.

&gt; They may also have started as stories of real events, which grew
&gt; larger over time (pretty standard for oral tradition). Somebody in
&gt; Mesopotamia builds a big raft and rides out a flood with his family
&gt; and livestock. A group of slaves run off and the troops sent after
&gt; them get caught in a flash flood in a narrow canyon just after the
&gt; slaves get through. Enough retelling over the years and you have the
&gt; Flood and the Exodus.
">

That would mean that those stories are human-made exagerated and
corrupted accounts of natural events, not allegories of divine
concepts.

....for Paul's argument up to that point, which was attempting to tell
the Galatians that you remain a Christian and continue to be a
Christain the same way you began (by faith); contrary to the message
of James which said that you remain a Christian by keeping Mosaic law.

In this precise context Paul says the historical events of Isaac and
Ishmael and their Mother's are an allegory for what happens when the
converts of Paul and James (the Pastor of the Jerusalem Church and
epistle writer) mingle: Ishmael is designated to represent James and
his works based message and Isaac is designated to represent Paul and
his gospel based message. Isaac was a miracle son of Abraham in his
old age. Paul says that this aspect corresponds to persons who walk by
faith and obtain God's miracle deliverances from their old nature.
Ishmael corresponds to James who was a product of Abraham fornicating
in a tent with his young handmaiden, Hagar. Or the message of James is
compared to an illicit relationship producing a bastard son. The O.T.
says that Ishmael bullied and made fun of Isaac, which made Abraham
literally kick Hagar and Ishmael out of his household. Paul says that
these events are an allegory for his battle against James: he
concludes that the Galatians should do to James as Abraham did to
Ishmael: kick him out of the Church and his message of gospel voiding
heresy.

In Acts chapter 9, Jesus chose Paul to speak for Him and he wrote two-
thirds of the N.T.

Where does your comment state that your question is a literal
question? How do you know the OP was asking questions since it did not
specifically say that it was asking questions? Why are you
interpreting the OP to be asking a question? How do you know that the
OP is not a rhetorical question? Or an allegory or a parable or text

My main source is &quot;Fundamentalism and the Word of God&quot;

http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentalism-Word-God-J-Packer/dp/0802811477

which is as close as I have ever come to a rational argument about
this sort of thing, even if it is from a totally Christian perspective. (The
book concedes the Bible is not even supposed to make sense to any
external perspective because it's a closed system.)

The Bible is held to be the Divinely inspired Word of God, and as
such, it should be totally free from error. The precise mechanism
for this inerrancy -- The Holy Ghost acting as quality control -- isn't
important because this is supposed to be a logical argument. (There
is an interesting twist in that THC is also necessary when *reading*
the Bible to insure correct interpretation.)

So what is stressed is freedom from error, not literal interpretation,
which is considered impossible due to the nature of the text and
style of writing.

This is considered fundamental in that a willingness to accept false
statements or radical reinterpretation to save face undermines the
entire project: it cannot be the Word of God, and an interpretation
that Moses and the Disciples are con men or Yahweh is the Retarded
Little Brother of Zeus are of equal merit to any claim that what is left
over is a statement God's message to man.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 2) Literal interpretation of the Bible was never part of mainstream
&gt; Christianity - at least as far back as Augustine - until the formation of
&gt; the Fundamentalist movement in the early 20th century. Was the mainstream
&gt; Church therefore in error for at least 1500 years?

Many of these folks have no problem with a few only a zip codes

Where in your comment does it actually say that the question has to be
taken literally as a question since that is the same standard you are
applying to the Bible?

Whatever your answer, why is the Bible any different?

Of course we know your &quot;question&quot; was a rhetorical point that silently
presupposes its answer and the same is explained by your Darwinism.

How did Richard Dawkins know that the &quot;increase in information in the
genome&quot; question was a &quot;creationist question&quot;?

However he knew is the same way I know that the OP question was
written by a Darwinist.

Your OP question was begging the question, the answer is predetermined
by your evolutionism and its desire to say the Bible does not mean
what it says, which also &quot;begs&quot; another question: then why does it say
what it says, and why can't we say that what it says is either wrong
or right?

Answer: because you are a Darwinist and you want to corrupt the source
of your enemies theory (Creationism) = the purpose of the OP question.

How do you get from what the Bible says to &quot;not literal&quot; which means
that it does not mean what it says? All you are saying is that the
Bible is wrong by even asking the OP question. Since you are a
Darwinist we already know that you believe that the Bible is wrong
about the origin of living things; therefore what is the point?

How would any person 2000 years from now know if Darwin meant for the
&quot;Origin&quot; to be taken literally since he did not state this
specifically?

How do we know today that he meant it to be taken literally since he
did not state this specifically?

How do we know that the OP is not really a joke since you did not
state that it was not?

How do you like a taste of your own subjective and corruption
medicine?

The fact that a question mark appears at the end of the sentence
indicates that the sentence is a question.  The fact that the OP
states he doesn't intend the questions to be provocative, but to help
him understand the fundamentalist mindset indicates he wants answers
to these questions.  The fact that you're being argumentative purely
for the sake of being argumentative suggests that you've incapable of
answering the questions or otherwise unwilling.  So, I'll repeat the
original question to address your ridiculous linguistic sophistry:
This is a question which I want read literally and to which I would
like an answer:  Where in the Bible does it actually say that the
Bible has to be taken literally?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Whatever your answer, why is the Bible any different?
">

Because the Bible, if read literally, contains falsehoods.  There are
contradictions in the lineage of Jesus, the fate of Judas, and
outright incorrect statements with regards to the digestive habits of
rabbits, and the taxonomy of bats.  If these are read as metaphor,
then the &quot;falseness&quot; of these statements isn't an issue.

Regardless of whether or not the OP is a Darwinist, the questions are

Well, kudos on using the term &quot;Begging the Question&quot; in the right
context, but I don't see how the OP begs the question.  He is stating
that he doesn't know why fundamentalists insist on a literal reading
of the Bible, and how they view older church doctrines which are based
on non-literalist readings.  Now, the answers to these questions may
be used to score rhetorical points later, but the questions themselves
are not rhetoric.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

If Creationism is true, then it is true regardless of whether the
Bible exists or not.  The Bible could be false, and creationism could
still be true (Vedic Creationism, or Aboriginal Dreamtime, perhaps).
And why is it that you utilize the same practice by claiming that
Darwinism is invalid because of Racism or Eugenics?

Actually, you've called me a Darwinist many times, yet I believe God
created Heaven and Earth and everything therein.  We happen to
disagree about the means by which He accomplished these feats.  Again,
read metaphorically, the Bible is not wrong about the origin of living
things.  Literal and correct are not synonyms.

He writes a scientific text not written in metaphorical language which
describes first hand observations and makes supported arguments

no single man could have observed directly.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We can play too:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Where does this sentence ask a question since it did not say that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Can I take that reply as a &quot;Don't Know&quot; ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How do I know that you are asking a literal question since you did not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; say that you were in the OP, nor  since the OP have you stated that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you are asking a literal question?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ray

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; [PS: I have destroyed your argument and refuted the OP.]

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The OP was asking questions;  how do you refute questions?  IOW, if I
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ask &quot;which species of duck has the most feathers?&quot; is it possible to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; say I am right or wrong?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [In the context of the OP]

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Where does your comment state that your question is a literal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question? How do you know the OP was asking questions since it did not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specifically say that it was asking questions?

&gt; &gt; &gt; The fact that the post was titled &quot;Questions for Fundamentalists (depite
&gt; &gt; &gt; your pathetic attempt at diversion by changing the title) and the question
&gt; &gt; &gt; mark at the end of each question kind of gives it away; of course, we have
&gt; &gt; &gt; to allow for the fact that you are incapable of following normal logic.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Your silly play on words just demonstrates that you cannot answer the
&gt; &gt; &gt; questions.

&gt; &gt; &gt;From the OP:
&gt; &gt; alwaysaskingquestions writes:

&gt; &gt; &quot;1) Where in the Bible does it actually say that the Bible has to be
&gt; &gt; taken
&gt; &gt; literally?&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; The fact that the post was titled &quot;Questions for Fundamentalists (depite
&gt; &gt; &gt; your pathetic attempt at diversion by changing the title) and the question
&gt; &gt; &gt; mark at the end of each question kind of gives it away; of course....

&gt; &gt; Where in your comment does it actually say that the question has to be
&gt; &gt; taken literally as a question since that is the same standard you are
&gt; &gt; applying to the Bible?

&gt; The fact that a question mark appears at the end of the sentence
&gt; indicates that the sentence is a question.
">

Since the OP said how do we know that the Bible is to be taken
literally since it does not say so:

How do we know that what you say above is to be taken literally?

How do you know that my question above is to be taken literally since
I did not say that it is to be taken literally?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The fact that the OP
&gt; states he doesn't intend the questions to be provocative, but to help
&gt; him understand the fundamentalist mindset indicates he wants answers
&gt; to these questions.

How do we know that you write is to be taken literally since you did
not state that it is to be taken literally?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The fact that you're being argumentative purely
&gt; for the sake of being argumentative suggests that you've incapable of

How do we know, like the Bible, that you literally mean what you wrote
since you did not actually state that what you wrote is to be taken
literally?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So, I'll repeat the
&gt; original question to address your ridiculous linguistic sophistry:

How do we know that you are repeating something since you did not
state that you write is to be taken literally?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; This is a question which I want read literally and to which I would
&gt; like an answer:  Where in the Bible does it actually say that the
&gt; Bible has to be taken literally?
">

Why would anyone say that they want a question to be read literally?
Does not the question mark signify this desire? Why is the Bible being
singled out while the arguments being used to single it out are
exempting them self from the same standard?

If you answer the questions above please tell me why since I did not
specifically state that they are literal questions seeking answers.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Whatever your answer, why is the Bible any different?

&gt; Because the Bible, if read literally, contains falsehoods.
">

[How do we know that you meant that the Bible contains falsehoods if
you did not state specifically that you meant it literally?]

Then why would you want to cover this alleged fact by reading it
differently? Are you saying that any literary source perceived to
contain falsehoods should be understood in a manner to cover the
alleged falsehoods?

Why not say that it is false (like you said)?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There are
&gt; contradictions in the lineage of Jesus, the fate of Judas, and
&gt; outright incorrect statements with regards to the digestive habits of
&gt; rabbits, and the taxonomy of bats.  If these are read as metaphor,
&gt; then the &quot;falseness&quot; of these statements isn't an issue.
">

Since when do alleged falsehoods indicate metaphor? What is the source
for this belief to cover alleged falsehoods with metaphor? Do not
falsehoods indicate falsehoods? How do you know that a falsehood
indicates metaphor and what does that mean? What is the metaphor of
the lineage of Jesus?

What does the Piltdown man falsehood indicate metaphorically? What do
the falsehoods in the &quot;Origin of Species&quot; indicate metaphorically?

I have never seen any scholar say that falsehood indicates metaphor,
could you show me one?

&gt; &gt; Of course we know your &quot;question&quot; was a rhetorical point that silently
&gt; &gt; presupposes its answer and the same is explained by your Darwinism.

&gt; &gt; How did Richard Dawkins know that the &quot;increase in information in the
&gt; &gt; genome&quot; question was a &quot;creationist question&quot;?

&gt; &gt; However he knew is the same way I know that the OP question was
&gt; &gt; written by a Darwinist.

&gt; Regardless of whether or not the OP is a Darwinist, the questions are
&gt; still valid.  If a Darwinist asks you whether you what you think of
&gt; the Dodgers collapse at the end of the season, do you accuse him of
&gt; attempting to deny Don Sutton's win/loss record?
">

Is this a literal question? You need to say so because the standard
that you are advocating says that unless it is stated that you are
intending to be taken literally it is not meant to be taken as a
literal question, unless, of course, you are exempting yourself, but
since you did not say that you are exempting yourself I assume that
you are not speaking literally.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Your OP question was begging the question, the answer is predetermined
&gt; &gt; by your evolutionism and its desire to say the Bible does not mean
&gt; &gt; what it says, which also &quot;begs&quot; another question: then why does it say
&gt; &gt; what it says, and why can't we say that what it says is either wrong
&gt; &gt; or right?

&gt; Well, kudos on using the term &quot;Begging the Question&quot; in the right
&gt; context, but I don't see how the OP begs the question.  He is stating
&gt; that he doesn't know why fundamentalists insist on a literal reading
&gt; of the Bible, and how they view older church doctrines which are based
&gt; on non-literalist readings.  Now, the answers to these questions may
&gt; be used to score rhetorical points later, but the questions themselves
&gt; are not rhetoric.
">

How do you know this since he did not state that his comments were to
be taken literally? After all, his comments and questions were written
in the context that something written is not to be taken literally
unless stated that it is to be taken literally.

&gt; &gt; Answer: because you are a Darwinist and you want to corrupt the source
&gt; &gt; of your enemies theory (Creationism) = the purpose of the OP question.

&gt; If Creationism is true, then it is true regardless of whether the
&gt; Bible exists or not.  The Bible could be false, and creationism could
&gt; still be true (Vedic Creationism, or Aboriginal Dreamtime, perhaps).
&gt; And why is it that you utilize the same practice by claiming that
&gt; Darwinism is invalid because of Racism or Eugenics?

&gt; &gt; How do you get from what the Bible says to &quot;not literal&quot; which means
&gt; &gt; that it does not mean what it says? All you are saying is that the
&gt; &gt; Bible is wrong by even asking the OP question. Since you are a
&gt; &gt; Darwinist we already know that you believe that the Bible is wrong
&gt; &gt; about the origin of living things; therefore what is the point?

&gt; Actually, you've called me a Darwinist many times, yet I believe God
&gt; created Heaven and Earth and everything therein.  We happen to
&gt; disagree about the means by which He accomplished these feats.  Again,
&gt; read metaphorically, the Bible is not wrong about the origin of living
&gt; things.  Literal and correct are not synonyms.

&gt; &gt; How would any person 2000 years from now know if Darwin meant for the
&gt; &gt; &quot;Origin&quot; to be taken literally since he did not state this
&gt; &gt; specifically?

&gt; He writes a scientific text not written in metaphorical language which
&gt; describes first hand observations and makes supported arguments
&gt; towards a conclusion.  The Bible gives genaologies and histories that
&gt; no single man could have observed directly.

But no genealogy could be observed directly, that is why they are
written down so persons afterwards will know who their ancestors

&gt;[...]

&gt;&gt; The parables are quite clearly reported as allegorical stories, while
&gt;&gt; this doesn't seem to be the case for the myths in the Old Testament.
&gt;&gt; Anyway, what do you think the six-day creation, the flood and the
&gt;&gt; exodus could be allegories for?

&gt;I think that the six-day creation could be argued as allegorical for the
&gt;fact that the world neither existed for ever nor came into being instantly,
&gt;that it went through a series of phases. To that extent, it is broadly
&gt;compatible with both the Big Bang and Evolution; I accept that the detail is
&gt;way off but that is not surprising in an oral tradition handed down through
&gt;generations.
">

I think that you're trying too hard to reconcile Genesis and science
-the Bible is a religious book, not a science textbook, and we have no
good reason to expect it to represent the scientific knowledge of later
millenia.

An interpretation that I find plausible is that the authors of Genesis 1
were taking the creation myths of the region and retelling them in
monotheist form - with the allegorical meaning that the world was the
work of their God, and not of the pantheons of their neighbours.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I think that the Flood could be regarded as allegorical for the rapid
&gt;expansion of life forms in the Cambrain period.

&gt;I have no particular thoughts on the Exodus.
">

I'm am of the opinion that you should be looking for religious, moral
and political allegories in the Bible, not allegories of science.
