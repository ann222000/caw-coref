Excerpt:

Secretary Henry Paulson, two top officials in charge of US monetary policy,
continue to provide obligatory assurance to the nervous public that the
United States' economic fundamentals are sound in the face of a jittery
market. Days before being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, shares
of the collapsed New Century, a distressed subprime mortgage lender, were
recommended by a major Wall Street brokerage firm as a "buy". That firm is
now under criminal and regulatory investigation

Comment:  Wanna bet that the Wall Street brokerage firm is also a CIA front
operation?

Brings news meaning the term 'funny money'.

&gt;Sheesh.

Rothschild &amp; the PNAC won't go out easily, they will still insist on
antagonizing the bears.  They have no idea want-so-ever that planting trees
doesn't keep the bears out of the woods. ;)

Brace yourself, I find it highly unlikely that the USA will come out
unscathed.  Bush et al are really, really stupid.

The moral of the story is -- you can't negotiate with human beings who are
dumber than a box of rocks.  The rock-brained humans just sit there, in the
way, hoping someone won't see them and trip over them and break a leg.
The only way out is to pulverize them and get them out of the way, so
intelligent people won't hurt themselves.
