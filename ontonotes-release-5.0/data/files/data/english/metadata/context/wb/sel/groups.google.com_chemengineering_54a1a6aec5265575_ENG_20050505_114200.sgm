Raipur 492010). Discharge of some high acidity effluents: damage
assessment in paddy soils. Indian J Environ Prot, 16(2) (1996), 102-105
[12 Ref].

The samples of effluents from sulphuric acid plant, galvanizing plant
and copper - wire plants which are located in the paddy crop area of
Chhattisgarh region (India) were collected and characterised. The
samples of the normal paddy soils and those polluted with the effluents
were also collected and their physico - chemical characteristics and
bacterial counts were determined. On comparison it was found that the
bacterial presence in the polluted soils was completely lost. The
damage of paddy soils by discharge of such effluents was found to be
very high.

9703-213. Ali Wazid, Deepak Desh (Dept Cheml Engng, Univ Roorkee,
Roorkee 247667). The effect of mercury on aerobic biological treatment
process. J Indl Polln Contl, 12(1) (1996), 65-72 [8 Ref].

Batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of slug
doses of mercury as HgCl2 on aerobic biological treatment of synthetic
waste prepared by 51 dissolving the known amount of gur (dried cane
sugar juice) in tap water. Results indicate that there is a temporary
inhibition in the substrate (COD) reduction with increase in mercury
doses. The time required for acclimatization increases with increase in
the dosage of mercury applied to the system.

9703-214. Arabindoo Banumathi, Elangovan R, Murugesan V (Anna Univ,
Dept Chem, Madras 600025). Rational design and cost analysis for
conventional and extended aeration activated sludge process for tannery
waste. Indian J Environ Prot, 16(10) (1996), 761 -767 [8 Ref].

Study evaluates the cost of biokinetic parameters based design for both
conventional and extended aeration activated sludge systems. The
efficiency of the treatment based on rational design using the
evaluated biokinetic parameters is higher than the one based on thumb

Tirupati 517502). Spectrophotometric determination of copper in waste
water and food samples. Polln Res, 15(3) (1996), 311-313 [8 Ref].

A simple, rapid and sensitive procedure is described for the
determination of copper in waste water and food samples. Copper forms a
bright yellow coloured complex with potassium propyla xanthate (KPX) at
pH 6.0. The complex is extracted into methyl isobutyl ketone and
measured at 400 nm spectrophotometrically. The interference of various
ions and the applicability of the present method for the determination
of copper in waste water and food samples are described.

9703-216. Balasubramanian N, Lalitha K, Jafar Ahamed A (Bishop Heber

adsorption dynamics for the removal of hexavalent chromium. Indian J
Environ Prot, 16(4) (1996), 262-268 [10 Ref] .

Tannery is one of the major consumers of water, and the effluent
discharged from it, contains hexavalent chromium. It is a heavy metal
and when concentration exceeds a particular limit, it becomes
mutagenic, carcinogenic and teratogenic. A low - cost adsorbent, namely
goat hair, a waste material in the tanneries, was selected as the
adsorbant and experiments were designed with a view to establishing the
condition to get maximum adsorption.

complexes to remove toxicant ethylenediamine. Indian J Environ Prot,
16(4) (1996), 249-251 [6 Ref].

The ethylenediamine (EDA) molecules are highly toxicant and cannot be
separated from contaminated aqueous environment by any conventional
adsorbent including activated carbon. In an attempt to meet this
requirement, organo-clay complexes were prepared by interaction of
quaternary ammonium compounds and bentonite clay. The clay complexes
were studied as adsorbents to find their applicability and suitability
to remove EDA from synthetic aqueous solutions. Results of the
experiments are presented as adsorption isotherms to explain adsorption
mechanism.

Ref]
The most accurate model of pollutant dispersion in the atmosphere can
be derived from an exact solution of the primitive differential
balances, and the application of dispersion theory in modelling
significantly reduces the complexity of the problem and still it
provides sufficient information in terms of predicting pollutant
concentrations. The specific features of three models have been
discussed explaining the dispersion of effluents from thermal power
plants in the atmosphere.

9703-225. Ghosal TK, Kaviraj A (Dept Zoo, Univ Kalyani, Kalyani
741235). Influence of poultry litter on the toxicity of cadmium to
aquatic organisms. Bull Environ Contam Toxico, 57(5) (1996), 1009-1015
[17 Ref].
Increased deposition of cadmium in impounded waters through atmospheric
fallout and runoff water is a growing concern for aquaculture. In
India, pisciculture practices are threatened by frequent low to
moderate deposition of Cd in ponds. Cadmium in the presence of other
chemicals, may produce synergistic, additive or antagonistic effects on
aquatic organisms. Aquatic ecosystems, heavily enriched by nitrogen and
phosphorus, have reduced the stress imposed by Cd. In contrast,
chemicals such as KMnO4 and CoCl2 used in aquaculture increase Cd
toxicity to fish and plankton.

The approach of industries, towards pollution control, thus far, has
been restricted to the end-of-pipe treatment to meet stipulated
effluent standards. A shift in approach to water quality management is
desirable in view of options of modifications in inputs, use of low and
non-waste technologies (LNWT) of production and modification in product
in keeping with an integrated approach to water pollution. A case is
made for adopting pollution prevention measures by furnishing relevant
data for a number of industries.

Paper deals with the process developed for the treatment of hydrogen
cyanide (HCN) bearing carbon slurry. Removal of cyanide upto 98% was
achieved by air oxidation and residual cyanide in the slurry can be
removed by any chemical oxidation method. In the present study alkaline
chlorine oxidation was attempted and removal upto 0.2 ppm was achieved
to meet the MINAS standards.

of electroplating effluents. Polln Res, 12(1) (1996), 15-19 [14 Ref].
The electroplating process results in the waste water generation
containing Ni and Cr (both hexa and trivalent) ions, which are
discharged into the sewers, drains etc. Of these two metals, hexavalent
form of chromium is known to be more toxic. The toxicity of such
effluents was investigated using 'Zebra Fish' (Brachyd aniorerio) and
it was found that it was unable to surview in 10% concentration of the
effluents. The discharge of such highly toxic effluents directly or
indirectly into sewers, natural drains or rivers is expected to disturb
the aquatic life and create an ecological imbalance. Moreover, the
existence of useful microbes is endangered.

The possibility of utilising usar soil as a precipitants, cation
exchanger and adsorbent for removal of heavy metals in the aqueous
solution have been investigated in the batch experiments when metals
are present together are reported. The effect of usar soil dosage,
equilibrium time and pH has been ascertained. The results indicate that
user precipitation technique is effective in the simultaneous removal
of heavy metals.

sulphonate from the effluent stream of surfactant-based
industrial-process : Laboratory studies . Indian J Environ Prot, 16(1)
(1996), 54-58 [9 Ref].
The removal surfactants from the effluent stream of 'surfactant -based
-industrial -process' lead to a significant decrease in chemical oxygen
demand (COD) and biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the effluent and
hence make such industrial processes environmentally favourable. By an
appropriate process design, it is possible to recover the precipitated
surfactant and recycle the same in the process, and make the process
economically more attractive.

effluents using electrodialysis -a case study. Indian J Environ Prot,
16(4) (1996), 282-285 [4 Ref].
Desalination studies on treated refinery effluents were done using
electrodialysis technique. Results showed that salt rejection of 85-90%
and product recovery of 75-80% can be achieved by adopting reject
recycle in electrodialysis. The pretreatment requirements for
electrodialysis are less stringent than for reverse osmosis.
Non-availability of plants bigger than 10 m3/hr and high cost of
electricity are limitations for use of electrodialysis in India on a
large scale.

The sensitive and responsive organisms towards pollution can be
selected as indicator organisms. The tolerant species can be selected
for biomonitoring and may help in removal of certain polluting agents
to some extent. Cyanobacteria Anabaena torulosa and Anabaena cylindrica
have been employed to assess the functional and structural changes in
these micro-organisms-due to pollution stress of Ni(II) ions from
industrial waste water.

AlbizEa lebbeck pods were used for the treatment of chromium from
industrial waste waters in laboratory. The optimum pH for adsorption
was found to be 2.0. The metal removal efficiency was 94-99 % . The
phenomenon of adsorption by biosorbant can be attributed to various
mechanisms such as electrostatic attraction and repulsion, chemical
interaction and ion exchange.
