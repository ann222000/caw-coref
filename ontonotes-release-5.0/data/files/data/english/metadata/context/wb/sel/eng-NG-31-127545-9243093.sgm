Why I WILL WALK This
Sunday&lt; http://jelas.info/2007/11/24/why-i-will-walk-this-sunday/ &gt; -
Posted by nat It's not because I really like rallies.

I find them too hot or too wet, hell to get to, and liable to get me
arrested.

Been there, done that, wasn't fun at all.

I've been reading a lot about the spectrum of responses towards Hindraf, and
it's been really engaging.

I've searched my soul, and I now know what I must do.

I now know that if I don't stand with my brothers and sisters on
Sunday&lt; http://www.bangkit.net/2007/11/24/hindraf-assembly-will-go-on-%e2%80%... &gt;,
I will never stand with them.

*
Why are they marching?*

Let's start by examining Bersih.

How many actually came because they felt strongly about ink and postal
votes?

How many came because they're pissed off as all hell about our country going
to shit?

Now let's look at Hindraf.

How many of us have any idea what it's like to be a poor Indian in Malaysia?

I remember the Ijok campaign, and our walkabouts in the Indian tapper
villagers.

&lt; http://jelas.info/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/0704-ijok-campaign-034.jpg &gt;

[image: 0704-ijok-campaign-034.jpg]&lt; http://jelas.info/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/0704-ijok-campaign-034.jpg &gt;

I've been to Sierra Leone, and what I saw in Ijok wasn't much better.

When you're small, you become a punching bag. It's just about as simple as
that.

Are the Indians all a bunch of victimised saints? Not any more than the
Chinese, Malays or any other group are.

But they have it worst around here. There's little doubt in my mind around
that.

They've been pushed around, kicked, insulted, made fun of and neglected.

Remember Khairy's
remark&lt; http://jelas.info/2007/11/09/khairy-noraini-the-only-way-up-is-throug... &gt;about
newspaper vendors and the PM's speech?

What that really symbolises is that in Malaysia, you can kick an Indian and
get away with it.

And now they have said &quot;Ya basta &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya_Basta &gt;!&quot; –
Enough!

The community will no longer take this abuse lying down.

*Why Hindraf?*

Many have expressed their ill ease with a Hindu-centric movement whose
approach borders on racism.

I am sympathetic to this objection. I rather doubt that all the sentiments
expressed throughout shockingly well attended Hindraf rallies throughout the
country espoused the ultra-sensitive and nuanced views that would appease
those like me.

No, it probably went more something like: &quot;They (by which I basically mean
the Malays) are bitchslapping us, and it's time we fought back!&quot;

I agree, that's really not the best way to move forward.

Still, it seems to be the only way things are moving at all.

The popularity of Hindraf clearly points to one thing: a lack of credible
Indian leadership that is truly voicing the feelings of the community.

If you have doubts about this, check out any of their rallies.

That MIC has failed and betrayed the Indians hardly bothers exposition.

I will be perfectly honest. Hindraf shows that the opposition has probably
failed the Indians as well.

DAP has made some inroads, but they know which side their bread is buttered.
KeADILan and Pas seem to have their hands full in their efforts to swing the
decisive Malay middle ground – without which quite honestly, all other
efforts are futile.

I'm not making excuses. We should be doing more, and we aren't. Electoral
reality has simply put Indians off the map of most.

So, when a group of people wearing a civil society hat step up and really
articulate a community's plight just by speaking from their hearts, that
community responds in astounding strength.

Unlike the Chinese, the Indians have so much less to lose.

Something I read and saw the truth of when I attended the solidarity
gathering for arrested Hindraf rulers: &quot;The Indians are losing their fear.&quot;
(See Malaysiakini &lt; http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/75179 &gt;)

All they needed was for someone to lead them where they've long wanted to
go. Since no one else dared or bothered, Hindraf filled the vacuum.

*Race: Politics and Principles*

Haris Ibrahim's intelligence is outweighed only by his warmth, which is
eminently more important.

He is not attending on Sunday for moral reasons, objecting to the racialist
approach&lt; http://harismibrahim.wordpress.com/2007/11/24/why-i-will-not-walk-thi... &gt;taken
by Hindraf.

Anwar Ibrahim as well has given qualified
support&lt; http://anwaribrahimblog.com/2007/11/22/himpunan-hindraf/ &gt;to
the rally, feeling that some of the demands and articulations
expressed
by the group are too extreme, albeit well founded in terms of being based on
real exploitation and marginalisation of the community.

Again, I can also agree that yes some temples are built illegally, and yes,
like any other community, racism rears its ugly head among the Indians often
enough.

Are these reasons for us not to go?

I thought a fair bit about this (while turning over in my head the threat of
seeing the inside of the lockup again).

My conclusion is this: If we were to wait for another mass rally that will
take a more mature, universalistic approach to race relations while actually
having an impact in calling attention to the horrific living conditions
facing Indian Malaysians today, *we will wait forever.*

I expect attendance well in the five figures.

Let's be honest, no other group is going to pull those numbers in defence of
minority rights in Malaysia.

If we don't stand with them now, we will never stand with them.

We may not agree now, but if we don't come out when it matters the most, we
will never get a chance to dialogue.

We will never get a chance to speak from a position of credibility about the
need to unite, and to look beyond parochial interests.

It has been said that the Hindraf approach opens the door for BN to
introduce their hoodlums and engineer violence on the scale of May 13, thus
plunging the opposition and civil society back some twenty years.

Well, that will certainly be easier to do if there are no Chinese or
(especially) Malays standing with the Indians that day.

And the march is not going to be called off; it would be idiotic to suppose
so.

So, are we going to walk the talk about multiracialism?

Are we who like to quote Voltaire's &quot;I may disagree with what you say, but
will defend to the death your right to say it&quot; actually going to do anything
to defend the right to assemble?

Or are we going to criticise the cops from the comforts of our homes and
leave our Indian brothers and sisters to feel just how hard a baton or pipe
feels when it comes crashing down on your skull?

When the newspapers print stories of massive racial violence, will the
people say &quot;Bullshit – Malays and Chinese stood with the Indians that day.&quot;
Or will they say &quot;Shit, BN was right all along: without them, racial
violence will run rampant&quot;?

*A Petition to the Queen of England?*

Might make you feel a bit stupid, yes. Some felt stupid enough presenting a
memorandum to the DYMM SPB Agong, much less some foreign liege who
incidentally used to 'rule' over us.

The strategy and approach has been lampooned, and probably rightfully so.

Do we expect the Queen to say jolly good, and the suit to actually win
trillions of ringgit? Don't make me laugh.

But again, is this really why the Indians are taking to the British High
Commission? Because they believe it will win them British citizenship? To
think that would be equally laughable.

(Well perhaps not entirely. Once in a blue moon, I think I would take to the
streets for British citizenship, haha :)

It would be just as silly to assume that everyone who attended Bersih truly
understood the pressing need for electoral reforms, or the complicated
process in which BN blatantly cheats its way to victory in the polls.

Quite frankly, to me and to thousands of Indians on the march, that's not
what it's about.

It's about greater equality among the races, and about making every
Malaysian feel at home in Malaysia.

It's also about refusing to be raped any more.

*The Walk: Ends and Means*

I have never believed that one justifies the other. There are lines that
just cannot be crossed.

Nonetheless, if there is anything I've learnt in my line of work, it's just
how hard it is to dislodge BN.

I object to their every fibre of their being with every fibre of mine, but
I'm no fool who underestimates their strength, nor the magnitude of our task
ahead.

In my line of work as well, I have witnessed petty squabbles of every
imaginable sort.

Needless to say, these are not unique to my field, but exist instead in
every human endeavour. This fact does not make them any less unbearable
however.

We have seen many who refuse to subscribe to a greater centrist unity due to
unflinching belief in certain principles, or in worse cases, an inability to
get along on a personal level.

Examples include Ezam &amp; Gerak, Nallakarupan &amp; MIUP, Wee Choo Keong &amp; the
MDP, PSM and so on.

I honestly bear none of these people ill will; they certainly have not
directed any to me.

I have seen though, division upon division. I'm sympathetic to some reasons
for those divisions, as I feel many of the same frustrations those
dissenters have felt.

But people are nitpicking over politics, over principles, over pride and
over personalities. To me, the only thing that dominates the big picture is
disunity.

The question remains: how much do we really want what we want?

If, like me, you truly believe that BN is the root of all rot, how much are
you willing to sacrifice to see that their injustices are forever stopped?

Myself, I'm at least willing to go as far as walking on Sunday.

I don't believe that an Indian-centric approach alone will solve the
problems of the Indians, but I do believe that they have been screwed over
like few others have ever been screwed over.

I don't believe in sacrificing a more embracing conceptualisation
(&quot;Malaysian rights&quot;) for an increasingly narrow one (&quot;Hindu Rights&quot;), but I
do believe that some – if not all – of the grouses are perfectly well
founded.

I don't know exactly what levels of violence if any will be perpetrated on
Sunday and by whom, but I do know that if there is any attempt to paint any
violence as racial, that at least one Malaysian will be there to do his best
to confound the unholy efforts of the spin doctors and bear witness to the
truth.

I don't know whether my walk on Sunday will end at the British High
Commission, blocked at some LRT station, or back at the Dang Wangi lockup,
but I do know it will begin in the spirit of unity and solidarity.

See you there, I hope.

See u there :)

Thank you, Sir. Actually, I was hoping for a group of 50% or more non
Indians, especially Malays to support the handing our the memo. That would
make the government take notice of Indian sentiment and also Malysian
sentiments.

Let's see how many Malaysian actually feel that Indian been
marginalised. Once, I remember how little one DPM valued the contribution of
Indian in the railway system.( when some asked the top post be given to an
Indian.) Though, I don't agree the post being given to an Indian for sake of
being an Indian which I think was wrong too but the manner the words were
used. That's was long time ago. Wonder the man regret for saying so, now.

Well said Nat, I felt too that if I don't go, I might as well ABANDON
my Indian brothers and sisters, more than anything else. I had been swinging
from left to right, to go or not to go. After reading your entry, I
confirmed my conscience. I'm going.

Despite the fact that the rally was TECHNICALLY to appeal for British
citizenship and trillions of ringgit, I would think that the appeal would
merely be symbolic, as I cannot make myself to believe that these
well-educated lawyers would even place their hope in such a stupid appeal,
like She cares.

I compared yours with Haris' and I agree with your reasoning. So I'm
going to follow my conscience, I'm going to lend my MALAYSIAN support to my
fellow Indian citizens.

It's rare that I admit this, but I agree with you Nat.

See you there.

And please read Nat's piece on Hindraf - I know it made me want to walk on
Sunday, and hopefully it'll do the same for […]

Hi nat,you were right. We are not going to march for i million
dollars. Money doesnt matters. It's about the fight. We are at the edge of
patience. So we will take the streets to show our 50 years-dissappointment
and frustrations.

See you there..

As much as I think the cause is worthwhile, the racialism is a
substantial turn-off - and that nonsensical petition/lawsuit seals the deal
for me - I'm not going. Not that it matters, since I'm halfway around the
world and can't go for anything Malaysian. :(

I don't expect perfect congruence between my views and the views of
those organising the rally (there sure as hell wasn't when it came to the
BERSIH do). But when the rally is basically signifying support for a suit
alleging colonialist Britain should have upended the democratically-elected
government of Malaya…I'll pass. (I know reasonable folks have other views,
but personally, this is just going a wee bit too far.)

To make up for this bit of a downer, here's a joke you've probably
heard from me before: In Malaysia, a Malay problem is a national problem. A
Chinese problem is a racial problem. An Indian problem, however, is no
problem.

this is not just an indian/hindu problem but involve all malaysian.
malaysian are getting a raw deal since the Malaysia gain her independence.
Now Malaysian are being treated even worst in the sense that we could not
get a job in our own country as all the job are going to foreign worker who
willing to accept a lower wage. who is going to protect our right as a to
make a decent income and live a decent life in the country where we are born
in?
9. *charles chia* // Nov 24, 2007 at 3:33 pm

Well Nat, you are not alone of the view that BN is the root of all the
rot. And that the Indians brethren are at the worst end of this abuses. Samy
Vellu and his people totally failed the Indian community. Of course, the
other races are certainly being marginalised. It goes without saying that
only one race is favoured. I for one being a little self but ready to offer
my little support to slay the Goliath of a BN. If every concerned Malaysians
stand up and be counted we can surely defeat this BN Goliath who has caused
too much damages to our beloved nation. I will walk with my Indians brethren
come this sunday.

I still remember when i was young when i saw a mic leader for some
financial asistence as my family was poor he told me he too was to poor to
deliver any help although he was driving a merchedze benz.Today i
might be comfortable but not rich.I believe many indians are trying
hard to break from the cycle of poverty.It is worse when there is no
affirmative action on the part of umno controlled goverment.MIC is
used by UMNO to show the world that indians are will taken of.
This is the best oportunity for the indian masses to support the
petition by attending the peaceful gathering as
malaysians.Thisindians who are attending as nothing to lose as the
majority are very
poor.In case this indians are detain they will get some free
meals.the25 ngo who opposed the rally are wealthy and scared of UMNO
11. *charles chia* // Nov 24, 2007 at 3:46 pm

50 long long years of cheating, corruptions, marginalisation,
legalised racial discrimination is enough. The country is highly polarised
racially and there is no racial unity, crimes is on the rise and a general
breakdown of rules and order. The entire system of govt. is breaking down
and we are certainly heading towards a Failed State. The call to every
citizen of this nation regardless of races to stop the rot is very strong.
So, get up everyone, make our vote counts at least for the sake of our
children ok. Help make BN a dirty and vulgar word to use.
