Group,

I'm setting up a sump tank for the first time. I have a CPR Overflow
box, which works well. Right now I'm using my canister filter to pump
water back up to the main tank. This setup works well, and does not
overflow when the power is turned off and restarts by itself when power
is restored. However, I'm worried that my filter is not working as well
as it should since the flow rate is reduced by the head pressure and
because only surface water which is skimmed into the overflow box and
sent to the sump is actually being filtered. Is this a problem?

So I'll probably get an additional pump to move water from the sump up
to the tank. Do water pumps have a problem with back siphoning and
require a check valve? Or do they only allow flow in 1 direction and I
don't need to worry about a check valve and back siphoning? I don't see
this mentioned when looking at some pumps listed at marinedepot.com.

Regards,
Kevin

Pumps can back siphon and will. An easy way around this is to drill a little hole in the return just under the water line. When power stops the back siphon will start, but stop once air is being sucked into the hole.
