Hi,

I am a student of ME. I am doing my final year project on
piezoelectric in shoes. Piezoelectric is located in shoes, while
walking, piezoelectric compressed and it generates an electric signal.
this electric signal is stored in capacitor in other words, this
electric signal charges a capacitor.

I need a piezoelectri for this application. which type of electric
suits? which specifications i need to buy it? do you have any idea ,
from where i can buy it online?

Thanks.

Regards,
Arjav Bavarva.

Have thought abput your assignment. Very tricky aspects.  The most
prolific and pobust piezo-electric devcie would be the push to start
ignitos on a barbeque. you can buy spare parts of just the ignitor at
Home depot.  this way you walk and compres a spring and this raps the
piezo and genrates several thousand volts. you recify thiswith  TV andoe
didoe.

good luck
