Will EULAs Follow UCITA into Oblivion?

Thursday, January 18, 2007
By Ed Foster

Is it time to put an end to End User License Agreements? While many of
us have long felt that EULAs were unnecessary, I wonder if their
champions in the software industry might not be ready to agree that the
whole concept is obsolete.

As we saw in Monday's story, there's a growing sense of frustration with
the ridiculously one-sided terms the lawyers for software publishers
throw into their license agreements. More and more experts are
questioning the practice, such as Jennifer Granick's recent prediction
( http://www.wired.com/news/columns/0,72394-0.html ) that contract law
will the hot cyberlaw topic of 2007.  Another must-read piece for anyone
interested in the topic is Mark Rasch's thorough analysis
( http://www.securityfocus.com/columnists/423/1 ) of the Windows Vista
EULA and Microsoft's product activation.

Rasch covers a lot of ground, including a great discussion on the legal
history of electronic self help, but the point that was particularly
fascinating for me was one he made about UCITA. (The Uniform Computer
Information Transaction Act was a model state law making EULAs strictly
enforceable that was pushed by the Business Software Alliance and
opposed by a broad coalition of consumer groups, civil rights advocates,
IT professionals, library associations, and me -- learn more about it at
http://www.ucita.com .) In theory at least, Microsoft's use of DRM could
be viewed as a wrongful exercise of electronic self help under UCITA as
implemented in Maryland, and possibly Virginia as well.

Talk about being hoisted on your own petard, it would certainly be
poetic justice for Microsoft -- which led the BSA's enormous lobbying
effort for UCITA -- to be the first true victim of the electronic self
help. Now, as Rasch acknowledges, it's pretty unlikely that could
actually happen. For one thing, Microsoft would surely argue that its
various copy protection schemes are what in UCITA language are called
&quot;automatic restraints&quot; rather than electronic self help. There are some
conceivable scenarios where that argument might not hold, but we'll
leave that for another day.

The real lesson here is what those of us who opposed UCITA always said:
treating one-sided EULAs the same way as negotiated contracts in the end
only raises more problems than it solves.  UCITA has been a dead letter
almost from the moment it was enacted in Virginia and Maryland, partly
because it was rejected so completely by other states and by the
American Bar Association, but also because it simply hasn't been needed.

EULAs serve two different purposes. One is to disclaim warranties and
liability, and by now we all already understand that software comes with
virtually no warranty and no responsibility for bugs. And since it's
clear that in the future increasingly software is going to be free,
that's fine. And you don't need EULAs for that -- a &quot;Sold As Is&quot; sticker
will do the same thing as those infinitely long disclaimers.

But the other purpose EULAs serve is to take away rights that customers
would otherwise have under the law. Restrictions on the right to
transfer or resell a product, prohibitions on publishing benchmarks
without permission of the vendor, limitations on how you can use or
modify or compete with a product, etc., are just of the things that
legitimate software vendors try to keep us from doing through the terms
of their license agreement. And then there are the not-so-legitimate
vendors for whom EULAs have been a marvelous boon - spyware purveyors,
&quot;free&quot; stuff scam artists, spammers and other shady dealers.  Really
about the only real benefit EULAs have provided the software industry or
the Internet has been the business opportunity for anti-malware products.

Just how enforceable a lot of these rights-depriving terms are have
generally not been well tested in court, because vendors will often
settle if the EULA is all they've got going for them. The epitome of
this of course was the Sony rootkit CDs and the ridiculous EULA that
came with it. It would have been interesting if Sony had attempted to
defend itself from the lawsuits on the basis of that EULA, but the
company settled quickly instead.

The one area where courts have upheld EULA terms that take away rights
we would appear to have otherwise has been the bans on reverse
engineering. Sooner or later, though, Congress or the courts or both
will have to overturn decisions like the Blizzard vs. BnetD case,
because having undefined &quot;reverse engineering&quot; banned for every product
is simply a prohibition against competition. I think most people in the
software industry recognize that the reverse engineering clauses are
untenable, but you can't blame any of them for putting such provisions
in their EULAs as long as our courts are stupid enough to uphold them.

Remember, as we've discussed many times, EULAs have nothing to do with
copyright law and are not required to prevent distribution of illegal
copies of software. So what benefit are software companies actually
gaining from all the billable hours their lawyers rack up writing these
things? If enough software executives ask themselves that question,
maybe 2007 really will be the year we see the end of End User License
Agreements.

Recently in my weblog:

Reader Voices: Invalid Terms
At what point is it clear that a nasty license provision goes so far
across the line that it must be deemed invalid? That seems to be an
increasingly hot topic, due in large part to recent discussions here and
elsewhere about various terms in Microsoft's Windows Vista EULA.

Comcast Has Its Limits
Cable modem providers have always been a bit sensitive about how much
their users upload, usually setting a rate cap to keep individuals from
hogging all the bandwidth. One reader though recently discovered that
Comcast also has its download limits, although no one at the company
will tell him what it is.

Accounting Vendors Block Linux Server Use
We all know Microsoft views Linux as a serious threat and will do just
about anything to discourage its use. But why would application vendors
who actually face competition from Microsoft help it out in this regard?
That's what one reader was wondering after discovering that his
customers could no longer use a Linux server with either QuickBooks or
Peachtree accounting packages.

Arrested Customer Comunications
It's getting harder and harder for businesses to communicate with their
customers via e-mail. If the spammers themselves don't stop them, the
measures users take to keep the spam under control very likely will.
And, as one reader recently opined, when those measures include
white-list vendor Spam Arrest, businesses also have to worry about their
legal liability for contacting their own customers.
