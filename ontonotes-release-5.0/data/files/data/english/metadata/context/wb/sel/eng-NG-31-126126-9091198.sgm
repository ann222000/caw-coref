Only Bendis, I think.  If you mean readers of Marvel Comics, I have not
found a person who has any great feeling for that character one way or
another. Perhaps that is why Bendis chose him because he is rather a
blank slate for Bendis to graffiti upon. I don't think anyone else
remembers The Hood anymore than they remember The Ringer.

aahh, The Ringer...

He was in the Beyond mini, though I don't recall the writer.  But then
so was a Hank Pym/Firebird relationship, which seems to have been
ignored outside of that mini.

Of course the Initiative should be used.  It is after all a law
enforcement agency. But Bendis writes them like they are retards which
devalues the foundation of why they were necessary. Which devalues the
actually reason why he wrote this crap.

The more I think about the Hood and Bendis I get sick.

SICK!!!!!

SICK!!!!

SICK!!!@!!!!!

The whole problem with the Hood is that he requires a specific
suspension of belief which contradicts the setup created by the selfsame
writer.

In my opinion there is the chain of belief you have to follow in order
to truly appreciate the tiny box of fun that is The Hood.

1) You have to believe that Reed Richards, Tony Stark, etc. think that
US federalization of superheroes is a good idea. Not only a good idea
but SO good an idea that cloning friends, hiring supervillains to attack
innocents separating mothers from their children and KILLING(!!!!) in
order to accomplish this goal is not only a good idea but NECESSARY.

OK Check.

2) You have to believe that a technologically supreme character like
Tony Stark would not believe data on heroes families would get out.
Contrary to all of Stark's history where he's spent years unsuccessfully
preventing his Iron Man tech from getting out into the open.  Yeah

OK disbelief suspended.  Check.

3) You have to believe that US Superheroes must be forced/conscripted to
actually act as agents of the Federal Government.  WTF!!!!!!!

OK.  Go on.

4)  You have to believe that Superheroes must act as law enforcement
agents but somehow also act alone.  By alone meaning somehow magically
without the benefit/restrictions of being a cop.

Cops do paperwork.
Cops don't go into a building without backup.
Cops call relevant police authorities when they enter private property.
Cops are restricted in the use of force.
Cops go into buildings with partners.
Cops announce that they are &quot;cops&quot; and arrest people.

Going after Jigsaw without identifying herself as a &quot;cop&quot; is
contradictory to being a REGISTERED AGENT of the SHRA and the
Initiative. As a member of The Initiative standard operating procedure
would apply just like any other representative of law enforcement.
Jigsay could NEVER, EVER go to jail because of Tigra's actions.  You
have to believe that Tigra is &quot;allowed&quot; to do this.

OK.......

5) You have to believe that Tony Stark and Reed Richards understand and
accept this concept. The concept where US superheroes are registered and
as members of the Initiative are part of the US Goverment with all the
responsibilities of being a representative/employee of the US Government.

OK

6)  You have to believe that The Hood intimidation concept will actually
intimidate a superhero.  Now in just a cops and robbers universe police
_could_ be intimidated although that is not a given.  In real life,
could a street thug intimidate a FBI agent with this kind of technique?
Possible, but more likely not since the FBI agent has access to more
resources like say, THE FBI. The street thug would be at a disadvantage.
Okay now transfer this idea to a comic book.  You are a SHIELD agent.
An independant operator beats you up and threatens your
kids/mother/wife/dog.  He is gathering a gang of independant crooks and
using you as an example.  Well you have something called SHIELD to help
you here.

Take the example of NA #35.  You are Tigra. You found a courage within
yourself to stand up to the Molecule Man, the guy who just disintegrated
Thor's Hammer, Silver Surfer's surfboard and Captain America's shield
and was going to remake the Earth as he saw fit.  Somehow he got the
drop on you, kneecapped you and pistol-whipped you.  He threatened your
mother.  You are an agent of the Federal Government - part of the law
enforcement arm of the Initiative.  In the non-magical part of the MU
you have cops who can go around an give you mom 24hr protection. You can
put your mom in witness protection.  You can move your mom and not tell
anyone where you moved her to so the Initiative has no record of it.

In the powered part of the MU you can call Shield PSI agents to read the
mind one of the Hood's associates to track down the Hood. Tigra
doesn't even have to be there because Initiative cape-killers can do
their work.  Tigra can appeal to a magical hero like Brother Voodoo or
Dr. Strange to track him down. Tigra can ask Xavier or Emma Frost to
find him.

You the reader actually have to believe The Hood can intimidate Tigra.

OK.  Now I need drugs.

7) Go back to #1 and you have to still ask how Stark thinks was a good
idea?????

8)  You the reader actually have to accept this

WTF!@!!!!!!!  I am going to have to read Top Cow or something now.

Well, yes, he should. However, with the editorial control Bendis has over
all things Avengerish and his acknowledged hatred of Pym, chances are
we'll see either a) Hank completely blow off whatever relationship he had
with her or b) Hank enter a guilt-induced near-catatonia.

Either that, or he'll express regret he didn't get to beat the crap out
of her himself.

That's our Bendis. Pffft.

Indeed. Disgusting. This really doesn't have much to do with the Hood
though. I really think the Hood would be doing this same thing, even
if there was no SHRA/Initiative. It just makes for a good excuse.

Yeah, well, where have those SHIELD Psi agents been all of these years
when they could have really been useful? Heck, they aren't even useful
now. The most effective they've been recently was in MS. MARVEL, and
after doing one big thing, the Psi agent had an aneurysm.

We really don't know enough about the Hood's abilities to say if he
could be tracked or mind-controlled. I am, though, expecting one of
his recruited villains to betray him, and he will promptly make an
example of them by killing them like he did the Owl.

And you can scratch Brother Voodoo, Strange, Xavier, and Emma off that
list. They'd all likely tell her to get bent. Brother Voodoo has
already shown that he's not committed to Stark's cause. Strange is
openly resisting. Xavier may or may not. Emma would tell Tigra that if
she comes back around, she'll make her wish her mother was dead.

Both sides of the Avengers are supposed to be losing at least one
person to the opposite side in upcoming issues, and I wouldn't be
surprised if Tigra joined the rebel New Avengers. She was clearly not
happy with the Initiative before the assault.

IMO, its not about how incompetently a story is written; you just need a
bad writer for that. The crux for me is the basis for how the story is
conceived.  If the original conception does not pass then it is a shaky
foundation on which to build stories. This, I believe is the fundament
of my problems this Civil War and the SHRA concept.

Smart heroes are selectively dumb to bring a endgame the the writer
conceives.

This is the crux of the problem.  I don't subscribe to this notion but I
will follow with your idea that the US Govt wants every superhero
working for the US. That _still_ doesn't explain _why_ the superheroes
think it is a good idea.  This is the break in character, the break in
conception which is at odds with the Civil War/SHRA concept.  Bendis and
company basically gloss over it because there would be _no_ SHRA if
superheroes acted like their prior established characters.

&gt;&gt; You have to believe that Tigra is &quot;allowed&quot; to do this.

&gt;&gt; OK.......

&gt; You're assuming that Initiative Agents are and/or act as law
&gt; enforcement and not military.
">

Relatively speaking it is the same thing.  Whether you are military or
civilian police you are still beholden by the government rules (such as
they are) even in the Marvel Universe.  You are still acting under a
chain of command.  You are expressly _not_ a vigilante anymore. That was
the whole point of the SHRA Act in the first place!!!!!  When you are in
the Initiative you are paid by the government and supposedly managed and
trained to best use your powers.  (to paraphrase Tony Stark's
condescending statements)

In this brave new post SHRA world is it wrong to assume that heroes in
the Initiative, paid by the government have to be given assignments and
report to regular &quot;duties?.&quot;  Again this seems a logical consequence of
Bendis' concepts.

&gt;&gt; 6)  You have to believe that The Hood intimidation concept will
&gt;&gt; actually intimidate a superhero.  Now in just a cops and robbers
&gt;&gt; universe police _could_ be intimidated although that is not a
&gt;&gt; given.  In real life, could a street thug intimidate a FBI agent
&gt;&gt; with this kind of technique?

&gt; Yes.
">

I beg to differ only because it doesn't seem to work that way in
reality.  Corruption of federal officials and law enforcement does not
seem to happen thru thuggish intimidation.  Greed is a larger influence.

I believe that when a person has no recourse could this type of thuggish
behaviour actually work.  In Tigra's case it would require her to
believe that she has no friends and society is actually against her. Her
situation is not anywhere near anarchic; Tigra surely could feel that
she has recourse in this situation.

In comics terms, Tigra has superheroes who will watch her back. She is
not a low hanging fruit.

I could accept this as a dramatic concept but not with Tigra who has
some level of super-friendships and is actually part of a Federal
division. I would feel that someone like Arana would be more susceptible
to this type of problem because she was new at the hero game. She also
has only one super-friend.  She is younger and more naive.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Possible, but more likely not since the FBI agent has access to
&gt;&gt; more resources like say, THE FBI. The street thug would be at a
&gt;&gt; disadvantage.
&gt;&gt; Okay now transfer this idea to a comic book.  You are a SHIELD
&gt;&gt; agent.
&gt;&gt; An independant operator beats you up and threatens your
&gt;&gt; kids/mother/wife/dog.  He is gathering a gang of independant
&gt;&gt; crooks and using you as an example.  Well you have something
&gt;&gt; called SHIELD to help you here.

&gt; Considering SHIELD's past track record, they're not much of a
&gt; deterent.
">

Bendis/Marvel writes SHIELD like they have exactly the amount of brains
it requires to shoe-horn into his story.  During the Collective series,
Maria Hill can have PSI agents actually read Peter Parkers mind _and_
disable the Vision and copy the robots memory.  In Ms. Marvel her PSI
team can track Arachne across the midwest. Awesomely competent don't you
think?.

SHIELD is so competent that it takes Wolverine and Daredevil the power
of Dr. Strange to get on board.

Then Taskmaster can waltz into the SHIELD helicarrier to prove he can
assassinate Maria Hill.  They are a literary convention.  But they
should have a SOP which the reader can follow.

&gt;&gt; Take the example of NA #35.  You are Tigra. You found a courage
&gt;&gt; within yourself to stand up to the Molecule Man, the guy who just
&gt;&gt; disintegrated Thor's Hammer, Silver Surfer's surfboard and Captain
&gt;&gt; America's shield and was going to remake the Earth as he saw fit.
&gt;&gt; Somehow he got the drop on you, kneecapped you and pistol-whipped
&gt;&gt; you.  He threatened your mother.  You are an agent of the Federal
&gt;&gt; Government - part of the law enforcement arm of the Initiative.
&gt;&gt; In the non-magical part of the MU you have cops who can go around
&gt;&gt; an give you mom 24hr protection. You can put your mom in witness
&gt;&gt; protection.  You can move your mom and not tell anyone where you
&gt;&gt; moved her to so the Initiative has no record of it.

&gt; Tigra has, at times, expressed a great fear of death. It's why she's
&gt; quit more than once.
">

Tigra HAS been afraid.  I'm just saying I don't think she should be
afraid of this.  This, I admit is my personal view but I base it on what
she has been afraid of before.  I will reiterate, an inexperienced
heroine like Arana is more susceptible to this kind of problem than
Tigra.  Even a long term hero could be susceptible provided that he/she
was one who traditionally didn't have any associations with other heroes.

&gt; Yeah, well, where have those SHIELD Psi agents been all of these years
&gt; when they could have really been useful? Heck, they aren't even useful
&gt; now. The most effective they've been recently was in MS. MARVEL, and
&gt; after doing one big thing, the Psi agent had an aneurysm.
">

I might have granted you this except the current editorial staff has
made a case for it _twice_ in their very recent tenure.  They have
written about the abilities of the PSI Agents to read minds and find
people as actual story points.  Their PSI Agents have teeth, as written
during this Civil War period.

&gt; We really don't know enough about the Hood's abilities to say if he

&gt; And you can scratch Brother Voodoo, Strange, Xavier, and Emma off that
&gt; list. They'd all likely tell her to get bent. Brother Voodoo has
&gt; already shown that he's not committed to Stark's cause. Strange is
&gt; openly resisting. Xavier may or may not. Emma would tell Tigra that if
&gt; she comes back around, she'll make her wish her mother was dead.

I do not think that any of the above would turn down a heartfelt plea.
They are heroes, after all.

&gt; Both sides of the Avengers are supposed to be losing at least one

I do not know any information about this so I cannot comment.

Barring Brother Voodoo, of whom I have no clue how he has been
written in the last five years, the one most suspect would probably
be Emma.

Dr. Strange once teamed up with Dr. Doom to rescue the soul of
Doom's mother, so he'd probably even help Tony Stark if Stark came
with a request to protect a relative.  Doc Strange certainly has
little reason to reject Tigra, though he also should likely be
protective against the chance of it being a pro-reg ploy.

As a means of stopping Vulcan from destroying the Shi'ar Empire,
Xavier formed a whole team out of people who he felt would need some
form of redemption, including himself.  That Xavier would have little
reason to not offer at least some aid to someone like Tigra.

Emma is the one that ran Ms. Marvel out of the mansion with a
barrage of images of dead mutants, but it wasn't like Ms. Marvel
was even asking for help.  Ms. Marvel used a mutant-related death
investigation, at a time when Emma's students were being killed,
as a chance to try again to recruit the X-Men to the pro-reg side.
Emma, already on edge, was fairly rightly enraged and responded
both loudly and with graphic imagery and warning.  And out of
sight of Ms. Marvel, immediately broke down afterwards.

That is much different from Tigra coming to ask for aid.  Yes,
Emma might be one to turn her down.  But threatening Tigra for
even asking is far from likely.
