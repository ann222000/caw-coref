The Other Rudy Hillary Race

You may remember it as the one that almost happened. The year was
2000, the place New York State, the campaign, one for the seat in
the US Senate from New York that was up that year.

Everyone believed that New York City Mayor Rudy Guiliani would face
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the campaign for that seat in the US
Senate from New York.

But things changed. A bout with prostate cancer forced "pro-choice"
Rudy to bow out of the US Senate race. Rudy was replaced  with
a "pro-life" Republican named Lazio who lost to Hillary in the
general election. Many believe Lazio's poor debate performance cost
him the race and that Rudy would have prevailed over Hillary in the
debates and gone on to win the election if he could have gotten the
Conservative Party nomination.

In New York State votes from third parties may be combined with
votes from major parties to determine who the winner is. Thus a
Republican Party nominee who is also the nominee of the Conservative
Party would have the votes combined to deterimine if that nominee is
the winner of the general election.

Many questions from the 2000 campaign linger on to this day. Was the
1999 Kosovo War, which saw Kosovo stolen from Eastern Orthodox
Christian Serbia, and handed over to Albanian Moslems, a payment in
advance for the would be third party candidacy of  "pro-life"
Albanian American Joe DioGuardi, who would have run on the
Conservative Party line in New York State, splitting the votes that
would otherwise have gone to the Republican nominee for US Senate
had the Conservative Party nominated the Republican nominee?

Who will be the first to break this story to the major media? Will
it be Barak Hussein Obama? Obama is said to be furious that Hillary
Rodham Clinton is out polling him among African-American voters.
When Jesse Jackson ran for President he won some 78% of African-
American voters in the Democratic primaries.

Clearly this story would cost Hillary Rodham Clinton  the support of
African-American voters. The idea that a young "white" radical  New
Haven Connecticut Yale Law student named Hillary Rodham might have
been involved in the torture and murder of a young African-American
man, who is believed to have been tortured and murdered in Maryland,
and, or in the disposal of that young African-American man's body
some 40 miles north of Yale in Connecticut, and or in the defense of
that young African-American man's accused torturer and murderer
would clearly produce a highly negative reaction among African-
American voters towards Hillary Rodham Clinton.

With Barak Hussein Obama in the race many of those voters might
switch to Obama from Hillary.

If Obama is determined to be the leaker of this story to the major
media he might also suffer a backlash from so-called "Yellow Dog
Democrats", who call themselves that because they proudly say they
would vote for a yellow dog if it ran for office as a Democrat.

Knowing that Obama might well be afraid to leak the story because
although it would clearly force Hillary from the race the backlash
might mean that Obama would have to leave the race too.

On the other hand Edwards could leak the story to the major media,
leaving a false trail that would lead people to believe that Obama
had leaked the story. If he could get away with it Edwards would
clearly benefit from the departure of Hillary and Obama from the
race.

What should Republicans do about all of this?  One idea might be to
wait until Hillary is nominated and then leak the story to the major
media. Such an "October Surprise" might or might not work. It would
be a big gamble for Republicans to wait until 08 to leak this story.

By then Hillary might have so much momentum that she would be
unstoppable.

As the man who made the phrase "two Americas" popular Edwards would
clearly pick up the support of African-Americans, and others, and
emerge as the most likely nominee for the Democrats in 2008.
A "white" Southern male, he would be following in the footsteps of
other successful Democrats: Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and Lyndon
Baines Johnson, all of whom won at least one term as President of
the United States in a general election.

Edwards in fact may be the most "electable" candidate the Democrats
have among those Democrats who have so far entered the race.

While Edwards is very much a child of the "Old South", he has
clearly undergone a dramatic makeover from the timid boy he was when
he looked like he was about to dive under the desk if his opponent
in the 2004 Vice Presidential Debate, Vice President Dick Cheney had
cast even the slightest angry look in Edwards direction. Edwards now
speaks with much more confidence, he has parted with his Bobby
Kennedy lookalike haircut, though he has yet to shave his head ala
Ms. Spears, or grow a beard ala Al Gore or the fictional President
Logan of Fox TV's hit series "24". Whether Edwards has merely had
the benefit of some terrific speech coach, or coaches, or gone onto
some medications more beneficial than the
Botox treatments allegedly  applied directly to the forehead of John
Failed The American Test Kerry, Edwards is clearly doing something
right.

What Edwards is doing wrong, and left, at the same time, is
following his wife's anti-Israel pro-appeasement script, which sees
Edwards calling for a US pullout from Iraq and caving in to the
Syrian-Iranian alliance which would takeover in Iraq once that
pullout took place.

This is a far cry from the Edwards who voted to authorize the use of
force against Saddam Hussein. Yet he may get away with all of it. He
could leak the dramatic allegations against Hillary, leaving a false
trail to Barak Hussein Obama, thus forcing his two greatest rivals
out of the race for the nomination, and might end up as the nominee
of the Democrats himself with ease.  .

And Edwards could go on to con the American people and walk away
with the Presidency won in a walk in 2008. Will there be a "Stop
Edwards" campaign among Democrats anytime soon enough to stop
Edwards from being nominated?
Will Edwards be the nominee if the scenario above works out for him?
If so, will Republicans be able to come up with any "opposition
research" on Edwards that is convincing enough to cause Edwards to
lose to his Republican opponent in 2008?

Nor do we know what sort of "opposition research" Democrats have
been doing on potential Republican nominees.

We can recall the 2006 race in which Hillary poured big bucks into
the Webb campaign for US Senate in Virginia to sink her likely 2008
rival Republican Senator George Allen.

The news that Allen's mother was Jewish, even though Allen was
raised as a Christian may well have cost Allen his seat in the
Senate in that tight US Senate race in Virginia in 2006.

Moreover Webb had run what some may have seen as a test campaign of
anti-Semitism against Harris Miller, his opponent in the primary for
the nomination for US Senate.
Let Us Punish Anti Semitism Not Reward It
Enter your vote today! A new poll has been created for the

Former Reagan Navy Secretary and now Democratic Senate hopeful from
Virginia James Webb is being accused of anti-Semitism for a flier
produced against his opponent Harris Miller.
By James Joyner
Senate candidate James H. Webb, President Reagan's former Navy
secretary, was criticized by his Jewish opponent Friday over a
campaign flier that depicted the opponent with a hooked nose and
cash spilling from his pockets. The flier was intended for
distribution among labor groups. It was titled "Miller the Job
Killer," referring to Webb's opponent for the Democratic nomination
in Tuesday's primary, businessman Harris Miller.
The flier, drawn in comic-book cartoon style, depicts Miller with a
grotesquely hooked nose and cash overflowing from his suit pockets
as he orders an underling to find ways to export U.S. jobs overseas.
The flier refers to Miller as the "anti-Christ of outsourcing."
Miller called it "despicable." "One of the things I hoped we would
keep out of this campaign, because it has nothing to do with the
campaign, is my religion and my background," Miller said."

of_anti-semitism_in_democratic_primary/

Here are some excerpts from that anti-Miller flyer
click on the url immediately below to see it:
http://notlarrysabato.typepad.com/doh/files/miller_flyer_color.pdf
which was "paid for and authorized by webb for senate.
www.webbforsenate.com " whose caricature drawings of Democrat Harris
Miller, who happens to be Jewish, look like they came straight out
of some nazi Germany era anti-Semitic propaganda piece, have him
saying: "Let them eat cake.", which of course he never said, and
which has a footnote stating "1. Attributed to Marie Antoinette
shortly before she was beheaded in 1793." as if Miller had actually
said it.
"Harris Miller, a corporate lobbyist, made his fortune by advocating
the outsourcing of American jobs. Called the "anti-Christ of
outsourcing," 1. Attributed to Marie Antoinette shortly before she
was beheaded in 1793. As Virginia's Senator, Jim Webb will be a
voice for working Virginians and will fight for what is really
important....
Root out corporate corruption and end the lobbyist stranglehold on
Congress, restoring confidence in our government. paid for and
authorized by webb for senate. www.webbforsenate.com "

The anti-Semitic campaign waged against Democrat Harris Miller,
Webb's Jewish opponent in the Virginia Senatorial Primary, was only
a warm up for the anti-Semitic campaign waged against Webb's
opponent in the general election, Republican Senator George Allen,
whose mother is Jewish. Chances are good that the anti-Semitic flyer
against Harris Miller described above would have landed Webb in jail
in Europe, where there are laws against such things. Europe, after
all, knows that hate speech leads to action. Hitler's Mein Kampf led
to The Holocaust. In America it got Webb the nomination of his party
for the US Senate. Don't let Webb benefit from the anti-Semitic
attacks launched against Senator Allen. Please help to expose those
who waged those deceitful hate filled anti-Semitic campaigns
against Democrat Harris Miller and Republican George Allen.

Politics and Bedfellows An Age Old Story Told Once Again

We do not know what to make of the gossip being circulated about
likely 2008 Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
these days.
It seems strange that material which appears to be damaging about
her would
surface over two years before the 2008 Presidential Election. Yet
such material
is surfacing all over the place these days.

Though the name Arthur Turco is known to few Americans today, if the
allegations
about his romantic and political relationship with Hillary Rodham
Clinton in
1969 when Hillary was at Yale turn out to be true Arthur Turco's
name might
become as much a household word as Monica Lewinsky's name was in the
late 1990s.

Unlike Monica Lewinsky however, Arthur Turco in 1969 was no starry
eyed 20
something intern being sexually used and abused by the most charming
President
of the United States ever to hold that office.

Gerald Lefcourt, David Brothers, Abbie Hofmann, Dave Dellinger,
William
Kunstler, Jerry Rubin, and Arthur Turco can be seen at a Black
Panther Rally at
Federal Court, in a photo taken on March 22nd, 1969. Arthur Turco is
the clean
shaven white man in the dark glasses,wearing a tie with his hand in
the pocket
of his rain coat, standing behind bearded Jerry Rubin.

You can see the photo in which Turco appears at
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/KnowTheEnemy/
in the Birds of A Feather photo album at
http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/KnowTheEnemy/photos

Arthur Turco was the New York City based leader of a weird white
group called
THE PATRIOTS in 1969. THE PATRIOTS were allied with THE BLACK
PANTHERS and a
Puerto Rican group called THE YOUNG LORDS in something called THE
RAINBOW
COALITION. This was a different group from the Jesse Jackson related
Rainbow
Coalition group.

THE PATRIOTS operated relatively openly from an office in far uptown
Manhattan
but reputedly also used one or more covert "Safe House" style
apartments in the
CHELSEA section of Manhattan. Some of those "Safe House" style
apartments were
allegedly fortress like places,allegedly filled with heavy weapons
including
explosives, as well as handguns, and automatic weapons.

Some alleged background on Black Panther Party attorney and ally,
Arthur Turco
may be found at

http://www.citypaper.com/news/story.asp?id=11450

which describes Arthur Turco as the "Panthers' New York
lawyer,Arthur Turco."
The article states that : "Caplan says he believes that the
Panthers' New York
lawyer, Arthur Turco, was the ringleader in the commission of this
crime. "He
was apparently in the house when the torture and the murder took
place and was
part of the conspiracy to kill and remove the body,"

Below is an example of a post which dates back to the Bill Clinton
era we found
describing some of the story.

"Back in 1969 a group of Black Panthers decided that a fellow black
named Alex Rackley needed to die. Rackley was a fellow Panther
suspected of
disloyalty. Rackley was first tied to a chair. Once safely
immobilized
his'friends'tortured him for hours by, among other things, pouring
boiling water
on him. When they
got tired of torturing Rackley, Black Panther member Warren Kimbo
took Mr.Rackley outside and put a bullet in his head. Rackley's body
was later
found floating in a river about 25 miles north of New Haven, Conn.

Perhaps at this point you're curious as to what happened to these
Black Panthers. In 1977, that's only eight years later, only one of
the killers
was still in jail. The shooter, Warren Kimbro, managed to get a
scholarship to
Harvard. He later became an assistant dean at Eastern Connecticut
State College.
Isn't that something? As a `60s radical you can pump a bullet into
someone's
head,and a few years later, in the same state, you can become an
assistant college dean! Only in America! Erica Huggins was the lady
who served
the Panthers by boiling the water for Mr.
Rackley's torture. Some years later Ms. Huggins was elected to a
California School Board.

How in the world do you think these killers got off so
easy? Maybe it was in some part due to the efforts of two people who
came to the
defense of the Panthers. These two people actually went so far as to
shut down
Yale University with demonstrations in defense of the accused Black
Panthers
during their trial. One of these people was none other than Bill Lan
Lee. Mr.
Lee, or
Mr. Lan Lee, as the case may be, isn't a college dean. He isn't a
member of a California School Board. He is now head of the U.S.
Justice
Department's Civil Rights Division.

O.K., so who was the other Panther defender?

Is this other notable Panther defender now a school board member? Is
this other Panther apologist now an assistant college dean? No,
Neither! The
other Panther defender was, like Lee, a radical law student at Yale
University
at the time. She is now known as The "smartest woman in the world."
She is none
other
than...Hillary Rodham Clinton."

We checked Hillary's official White House bio and found that:

"In 1969, Hillary entered Yale Law School, where she served on the
Board of Editors of Yale Law Review and Social Action..."
source:
http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/firstladies/hc42.html
We also dug up the 1997 piece below on Bill Lan Lee

"G.O.P Leader Says Nominee Will Be Halted November 10, 1997, Monday
By STEVEN A. HOLMES (New York Times) National Desk
Late Edition - Final, Section A, Page 22, Column 1,
Senator Orrin G Hatch, chairman of Senate Judiciary Committee, says
nomination
of Bill Lan Lee, President Clinton's choice for Assistant Attorney
General for
Civil Rights, is dead; nomination has run into opposition among
Republicans, who
accuse him of supporting racial quotas and affirmative action..."

Want to know something really scary? We do not know if there is any
truth to them at all, but allegations are beginning to resurface
concerning the
alleged connections, which may have begun in 1969, between Hillary
Rodham,while
she and her husband to be Bill Clinton were Yale students, and
something callled
THE RAINBOW COALITION, not the one associated with Jesse Jackson,
but another
one, which was composed of 3 allied groups: THE BLACK PANTHERS, a
Puerto Rican
group called THE YOUNG LORDS, and a bizarre Maoist "white" group
called THE
PATRIOTS.

The so-called RAINBOW COALITION was an alliance between ARTHUR
TURCO'S white
terrorist group THE PATRIOTS, and the original BLACK PANTHERS,(not
to be
confused with a group using that name today), and a Puerto Rican
group called
THE YOUNG LORDS in 1969 when Hillary and Bill Clinton were Yale
students.

A relatively covert alliance also existed between THE PATRIOTS and
heavily armed
international arab terrorists,including those controlled by
arafat,operating
even then in the United States,and elsewhere. In particular the
allegations
center around the alleged connections between Hillary Rodham and
Arthur Turco,
and others. Turco was the leader of THE PATRIOTS. THE PATRIOTS
members wore
dungaree "uniforms" including dungaree pants and dungaree jackets
and held
Maoist style "self-criticism sessions".

THE PATRIOTS were allegedly heavily involved in drug use, which
included
"snorting" horse tranquilizer drugs, among other things, and
allegedly were
regular visitors to YALE.

They also allegedly regularly read responsively from Lin Piao's
radical book.
("Encyclopedia of World Biography on Lin Piao
(1907-1971) was a Chinese Communist military commander and political
leader. His distinguished military career and loyalty to the
principles of Mao
Tse-tung were the basis for his rise to second position in the
Chinese Communist
leadership. He was involved in an unsuccessful coup d'etat in 1971.")

We would like to know what, if anything, you have found about this
story? Is there any truth to it at all? We do not know.

Then there is the matter of the Balkan Wars of the 1990s. Famed
Jewish columnist
A.M.Rosenthal of THE NEW YORK TIMES called Bill Clinton, who he had
backed in
the 1992 Presidential race against then President George Herbert
Walker Bush,
BOMBER BILL because of Clinton's prosecution of the Balkan Wars of
the 1990s.
In those wars some 5,000 Serbian civilians were slaughtered in
Guernica like air
raids. Many of the same targets in Serbia that were bombed by the
Luftwaffe in
World War Two were bombed by the Luftwaffe in 1999.

Bill Clinton turned the US Airforce into AIR BIN LADEN, flying
missions against
Serbians who were fighting against Osama bin Laden's forces in the
Balkans.

Why would Bill Clinton, the former anti-war activist of the
1960s,who had
demonstrated against the Vietnam War,wage war against Serbia as
President of the
United States in the 1990s?

The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution limits Presidential terms
of office to
2 terms. Bill Clinton was elected to those 2 terms and served them.
His last
full year in office was 2000, the year his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton was
elected to the US Senate from New York State. He left office on
January 20th,
2001.

Many observers viewed the 2000 US Senate race in which she was
elected from New
York State as a stepping stone to the White House for Hillary Rodham
Clinton.

In New York State winning state wide Republican candidates need the
nomination
of the New York State Republican Party to be augmented by the
nominaton of the
New York State Conservative Party.

Winning statewide without BOTH nominations is not an easy thing for
any
Republican candidate in New York State.

The website of the New York State Conservative Party proudly
proclaims : "The
1994 elections were a breakthrough for the Conservative Party as we
provided the
margin of victory for Governor George E. Pataki with the 326,605
votes cast on
our line."
source:
http://www.cpnys.org/history/history.html

In New York State the votes of candidates on for example the
Republican Party
line may be combined with votes for the same candidates received on
for example
the New York State Conservative Party line.

Thus winning the nomination of the New York State Conservative Party
is vital to
making a successful statewide run for office in New York State.

Things were not shaping up at all well for Rudy Guiliani, who was
the odds on
favorite for the Republican nomination for the US Senate race in
2000 against
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

To his credit then Governor George W. Bush did what he could to
pitch in to help
Rudy Guiliani.

abortions..."

The alleged Clinton master plan to win Hillary Rodham Clinton a seat
in the US
Senate from New York State as a vital stepping stone to the White
House was
built on a very simple proposition:
DIVIDE AND CONQUER.

Winning that seat in the Senate for Hillary in 2000 could
theoretically be
accomplished by assuring that the 2000 US Senate nominaton of the
New York
State Conservative Party did not go to the 2000 US Senate nominee of
the New
York State Republican Party.

But how could such a thing be accomplished? Who could be persuaded
to split the
right so that Hillary Rodham Clinton could be elected to the US
Senate from New
York State in 2000?

Ominously it was on May Day of 2000 that the following happened:

Who was Former United States Congressman from Westchester County
Joseph J
DioGuardi, and how did he fit in to the alleged Clinton master plan
to win
Hillary Rodham Clinton a seat in the US Senate from New York State
as vital
stepping stone to the White House?

DioGuardi has been described by New York City's Village Voice
newspaper as :
"NEW YORK'S KOSOVO KINGPIN"
http://www.villagevoice.com/features/9915/vest.shtml

In 2000 DioGuardi was poised to give not-so-hilarious Hillary Rodham
Clinton a seat in the US Senate from New York by virtue of his own
campaign for that seat that would have split right-wing opposition to
Hillary, thus ensuring her election.

We opposed Ms.Clinton then,and we oppose her now.
Unlike Ms.Clinton who favors a so-called
"palestinian" state we are opposed to such an entity coming into
existence. We were also opposed to Clinton's anti-Serbian policy in
the Balkans.
There is more data
available on the so-called "palestinian" state issue:

appeared likely to have Patrick J. Buchanan as its Presidential
standard bearer in the fall 2000 elections.

"Buchanan has consistently portrayed war criminals as
patriotic Americans, innocent victims of "revenge-obsessed Nazi
hunters" in Washington. Virtually everything the accused and their
defenders have said he accepts as truth, and, in the words of one
critic, he wages "journalistic guerilla warfare" on their behalf.
Says
Neal Sher, former director of the U.S. Justice Department's Office of
Special Investigations: "Buchanan went to bat for every Nazi war
criminal in America." Liberty Lobby, the leading anti-Semitic and
racist organization in America, overwhelmingly endorsed Pat Buchanan
during the 1996 presidential primaries. An editorial in its
publication, The Spotlight, pointed out that "the 112 issues or
legislative positions that Liberty Lobby has taken over the past 40
years...shows that Pat Buchanan stands with us." The predominant
issue
they share is Holocaust revisionism, the spearhead of the
international anti-Semitic movement. Buchanan used his syndicated
column and his office as communications director in the Reagan White
House from 1981-1987 to assist pro-Nazi Eastern European
organizations
in trying to block the denaturalization and deportation of Karl
Linnas, John Demjanjuk, and at least seventeen others who had been
charged by the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Special
Investigations or had been convicted in federal courts of concealing
war crimes in order to gain illegal entry into the U.S. The Karl
Linnas Case In 1981 the Federal District Court in Westbury, NY
stripped 67-year-old Karl Linnas of his citizenship for having lied
to
immigration officials thirty years earlier about his Nazi past.
Linnas's crimes, the judge said, "were such as to offend the decency
of any civilized society." From 1941-43 Linnas had commanded a Nazi
concentration camp at Tartu, Estonia, where he directed and
personally
took part in the murder of thousands of men, women, and children who
were shot into anti-tank ditches. A 1986 federal appeals court upheld
his deportation order, ruling that the evidence against the defendant
was "overwhelming and largely uncontroverted." Summarily rejecting
the
court's findings because evidence had been obtained from the Soviet
Union, Buchanan orchestrated a national media effort to exonerate
Linnas, demanding that his citizenship be reinstated. He championed
the Linnas cause in his syndicated newspaper column and TV program
"Crossfire," and arranged for then U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese
III to meet with him and members of Eastern European organizations
who
hailed Linnas as a hero. On March 31, l987, Menachem Rosensaft,
founder of the International Network of Children of Holocaust
Survivors, wrote a New York Times Op-Ed piece calling for a
congressional investigation to determine whether any American
official
or functionary had intervened on Mr. Linnas's behalf. Buchanan
responded by saying it was the Office of Special Investigations that
needed to be investigated. "Let us get it all out in the open," he
wrote, "nothing un-American can live in the sunlight." Attorney
General Meese delayed the deportation of Linnas as long as possible,
all the while searching for a haven. After sixteen countries had
refused, Panama agreed to accept Linnas "on humanitarian grounds."
News of the decision prompted Rosensaft and others to intercede with
Panamanian officials in Washington, who told them that their
government had not been informed of Linnas's wartime atrocities.
Panama withdrew its offer and issued a statement saying that "our
country and our Government reject and condemn the crimes committed by
fascists." On April 20, 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear
a final appeal. At that point Meese was legally bound to comply with
the deportation order. Linnas was flown to the Soviet Union and three
months later died in a prison hospital while awaiting trial."

The obvious question came to mind. Was the potential third party
DioGuardi 2000 Senate candidacy, which could have guaranteed Hillary
the US Senate seat from New York a "big payoff" for the Clintons for
the 1999 pro-Albanian Balkan war against Serbia which saw Kosovo
stolen from Serbia?

http://aacl.com/indexmain.html
is the url of a group which describes itself at that website as
"the Albanian American Civic League. The Civic League was founded
by former Congressman Joseph DioGuardi and a
board of Albanian Americans in 1989 as the only registered
lobby in Washington, DC, representing the concerns and
interests of the Albanian people.

Pay close attention to the phrase "living side by side in" found in
the quote below, and note how it has since been used by advocates of
a so-called Two State Solution, which envisages a so-
called "palestinian" state "living side by side in" so-
called "peace" with Israel.

In reality the so-called Two State
Solution is more like Hitler's infamous FINAL SOLUTION, as it is
really a Two Step or Two Stage plan, with the first step being get
Israel to hand over everything it will without total war, and then
wage total war against Israel from the land Israel hands over to
destroy the rest of Israel.

The self-described

"purpose of the Civic League is to further the human rights and the
national cause of the divided nation of more than seven million
Albanians living side by side in the Balkans in Albania, Kosova,
western Macedonia, southeastern Montenegro, Presheve, Medvegje,
Bujanovc (southern Serbia), and Chameria (northern Greece). By
bringing the political perspectives of 400,000 Albanian Americans to
the US Government, the civic League works to end the repression
and oppression of Albanians living under hostile Slavic Communist
regimes in the Balkans and to preserve the culture, identity and
human rights of Albanians throughout the world."

While you are digesting that quote, which sounds to me to be more
than a bit like the propaganda sprouted by the nazis about the
so-called "Sudetenland"

and other places inhabited by Germans and others which used the
German population as a pretext for annexation and in some cases war
by Germany.

Saddam did the same thing when he move arabs into Kurdish sections
of so-called Iraq.

Syria has moved a million so-called "civilian" FIFTH COLUMNISTS into
Lebanon, a nation which numbers under four million people, not
counting those million Syrian FIFTH COLUMNISTS.

NATO bombed Belgrade TV repeatedly, after Belgrade TV
started to show the comedic film "Wag the Dog" which is about a US
President who starts an Albanian War while he is in the midst of a

oust Bill Clinton from the Presidency.)

VOICE OF THE GRUNT
SPECIAL REPORT
FROM BEN WORKS BUYING AN INTERVENTION:
KOSOVO AND ALBANIAN PAC MONEY IN CONGRESS By Benjamin Works,
Director,
The Strategic Issues Research Institute Hack and I, along with a
select group of others, have been at war with the KLA over its heroin
and terrorist connections. We also knew something about how political
money bought this war policy. Here's the story. Back in 1995, late in
the Bosnian war, I got a reference to a 1986 Senate Resolution
proposed by Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, decrying Yugoslavian official
oppression of the Albanian population of Kosovo-that's 1986, when the
Albanian Autonomous government was still fully operational. Joseph
DioGuardi, a New York Republican, sponsored the companion House
Resolution, both of which never emerged from committee. I got a copy
of that Senate Resolution Nr. 150 from the Congressional Register of
June 19, 1986 and then let it sit in my file for a long time, while
the NATO occupation of Bosnia appeared to keep things calm.
Meanwhile, Bob Dole managed to lose the 1996 Presidential Election,
then vigorously supported Mr. Clinton's year-by-year extensions for
keeping some 6900 US soldiers in Bosnia.

As the KLA insurrection in
Kosovo reached civil war levels, I began to think about that
resolution and how it misrepresented history. I had done considerable
reading on the origins of the Yugoslav conflicts, pulling Washington
Post, New York Times and other reports from the 1980s, bearing on
Kosovo and the collapse of the Federative Republic's communist
government under the pressure of ethnic-nationalism.

Well, pieces fit together showing that all along it has been the
ethnic
nationalist fascist losers of World War II in Croatia, Bosnia and
Kosovo who
have been exploiting the political process in Germany and the United
States.
Their goal has been to effect the division of Yugoslavia and the
cleansing of
Serbian populations from their territories, while purporting
that "Greater
Serbia" was the menace to European security and not the post-
fascist "Greater
Croatia" and "Greater Albania."

Survivors of the Croat Ustashe movement in southern Germany began
their work in the 1960s, but Joseph DioGuardi must be given credit
for a sustained campaign to influence Congress beginning in the
mid-1970s. DioGuardi, an Albanian American whose ancestors came from
an Albanian transplant community in the heel of Italy, sat in
Congress for several years in the mid-1980s as a Conservative
Republican from New York's Westchester County, but creating a
Greater Albania was his agenda as a map on his website shows
( www.aapac.com ).

"His Political Action
Committee (PAC) activities are easy to follow from 1988 on. What
makes the PAC and individual contributions to campaigns more
interesting is the demonstrated connection between the Kosovo Heroin
Mafia, its "pizza connection" distribution ("inherited" from the
Gambino crime family) and money-laundering networks, and the number
of pizzaria owner-contributors listed in DioGuardi's filings. The
Croats and Albanians came up with big pots of laundered money, then
spread it around selectively, with American politicians helping to
persuade other members in Congress.

I have indications of a political alliance between DioGuardi and Bob
Dole going as far back as the early 1970s, but have not yet got all
the evidence in hand. What I do have is sufficient to reach
tentative conclusions about how foreign policy, in a democracy, can
be "bought"-that is precisely what happened in the case of the
Kosovo Air War. In early 1987, kicking off his 1988 bid to wrest the
GOP nomination from then-vice president George Bush, Dole received
$1.2 million from Albanian American supporters in New York City,
while DioGuardi received $50,000 at the same dinner.

I expect the funding trail goes back further, at least to Dole's 1976
campaign.It certainly continued from 1987 through to the present.

As the collapse of Yugoslavia loomed, the Croatian and Albanian
lobbies continued their campaign:

Defense &amp; Foreign Affairs Strategic Policy, Mar 31, 1993 issue,
reported as much as $50 million was larded around Capitol Hill in a
two-year period which saw the defeat of George Bush and led to Bob
Dole's control of the Republican party: The United States Congress,
still reeling from a series of financial scandals involving
representatives and senators, is now bracing for a new problem: the
massive financial "contributions" which have been made to election
funds of politicians by Croatian sources over the past two to three
years.

One Congressional investigator told Defense &amp; Foreign Affairs
Strategic Policy that the donations and expenditures on Washington
lobbying by the Croatians over the past two years "could well exceed
$50-million."

"Much of this came directly from Croatian lobbyists,
and some from Croatian American businessmen "Many of the campaign
contributions have been recorded legally," the investigator said,
"but many are questionable. But what is more important is that there
has been a pervasive attempt to push the United States along a line
defined by foreign powers-Croatia and Germany-and it has not been
subtle. Elected officials are being told to either support the
Croatian line or face either a removal of funding or are told that
funding will be given to their opponents. Or they are literally
bribed into supporting the Croatian line.

This was going on long before Croatia even made its open bid for
recognition as an independent state." Now, as to individual
contributions, there are campaign contribution limits on
individuals, then there are Political Action Committees
(PACs), "Soft Money" contributed to the parties and fed back to
candidates, and there is the time-honored
custom of passing bundles of hundred dollar bills in brown paper
bags to favored candidates. Federal Election Commission (FEC)
records are on-line ( http://www.tray.com/fecinfo/ )
and I have been able retrieve records for Joseph DioGuardi's PACs
going back to the 1988 election cycle, and have also tested Bob
Dole's 1996 Campaign and Liddy Dole's Campaign-2000.

It is all there in the lists of candidates and contributors. In
particular, most of the Congressmen speaking loudest against Serbia
and Serbs are those receiving money from DioGuardi's PAC. Some have
simply been beguiled,others may be more disingenuous.

Recipients come from both sides of the aisle but are mostly members
of the House or Senate foreign relations
committees...These records do not reveal monster sums of money, but
demonstrate the tip of the iceberg, where "soft money," individual
declared contributions and bags full of $100 bills also find their
way to select candidates.

It is clear that Bob Dole and Joe DioGuardi, in league with Croat
and Bosnian fascist emigrees, worked very effectively to set up US
foreign policy to dismantle Yugoslavia and ruin the Serb people.
They have succeeded admirably because they were organized and
persistent, while their opponents were disorganized and, ultimately,
outnumbered by the overwhelming flood of media propaganda.

Now, the US taxpayer is on the hook for Billions of Dollars, while
our service
personnel will be tied down for years in Bosnia and Kosovo,again
attempting the
kind of nation building that failed so
spectacularly in Somalia and Haiti. For those wishing to inspect the
details of these fundraising, I have loaded the summary lists
compiled thus far at my website along with a companion reading file
on the KLA and Heroin:"

"Congressman's Corruption Trial Opens with Bickering
Tuesday February 5th, 2002 By Jay Miller
CLEVELAND (Reuters) - The bribery and corruption trial of Ohio Rep.
James Traficant opened on Tuesday amid bickering and a warning from
the judge to the nine-term congressman to behave himself."

"Ohio Congressman James Trafficant has been a vigorous Demjanjuk
supporter since the start of the trial in Israel. After Demjanjuk was
convicted of crimes against humanity."

"July 17th, 2000 Jim Traficant is perhaps the most colorful Member
of Congress
of our time. He dresses in outrageous outfits and jokes that he is
the "fashion
leader of the House." His hair always looks as if he just got out of
bed. During
his eight terms in Congress he has become famous for his one-minute
speeches on
the House floor, where he questions the wisdom and honesty of
government
policies. He nearly always ends up saying "beam me up," a reference
to the old
Star Trek television series."

"Traficant guilty of bribery, racketeering
April 12, 2002 Traficant spoke to reporters outside the courthouse.
CLEVELAND, Ohio (CNN) -- A jury found flamboyant U.S. Rep. James
Traficant
guilty of bribery and all other charges against him Thursday after a
two-month
federal racketeering and corruption trial.
The jury of 10 women and two men convicted the congressman on all
counts against
him, covering charges of taking bribes, filing false tax returns,
racketeering,
and forcing his aides to perform chores at his farm in Ohio and on
his houseboat
in Washington.
The verdict followed four days of deliberations. The nine-term
maverick Democrat
represented himself in court throughout the trial, even though he is
not an
attorney....
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Missouri, issued a statement
saying a
member of Congress who breaks the law and commits bribery "strikes
at the heart
of representative government." He advised Traficant to step down
from office.
"In light of the gravity of the charges outlined in the guilty
verdict against
Mr. Traficant, I think the prudent course of action would be an
immediate
resignation," Gephardt said. ...
In 1983, while a county sheriff, Traficant was brought up on federal
bribery
charges. During that trial, he also represented himself. That time,
however, he
was acquitted.
The trial was marked by periodic outbursts by Traficant, who railed
against
prosecutors and Wells.
Prosecutors accused him of accepting gifts and favors from several
businessmen
in his district, including a convicted felon, in return for
interceding on their
behalf with federal and state agencies.
He also was accused of using employees from his office to perform
work on his
farm and boat and requiring them to return a portion of their
salaries to him
each month. The government alleged that staffers baled hay,
maintained horse
stalls and performed other chores at Traficant's farm.
Other charges accused him of underreporting income on his tax
returns and asking
employees to destroy evidence and provide false testimony after he
became aware
he was being investigated."

"Traficant Expelled - Sentenced
Rep. Traficant of Ohio expelled from House for ethics violations
Update:
07/30/02
Traficant Sentenced to 8 Years
Less than week after being expelled from the U.S. House of
Representatives,
former Congressman James Traficant of Ohio was sentenced today to
eight years in
federal prison for his April 11 conviction on charges of bribery,
corruption and
tax evasion.
At his sentencing hearing, Traficant argued that his expulsion from
Congress had
been punishment enough. Judge Lesley Wells of the U.S. District
Court in
Cleveland, disagreed, calling Traficant's expulsion a separate
political matter.
Judge Wells refused to set bail for Traficant, ordering that service
of his term
should begin immediately. Denial of bail also sets aside all pending
appeals to
Traficant's conviction."

Bill Clinton turned the U.S. Air Force into
Air bin Laden, to support Osama bin Laden's terrorists on the
ground, who were allied with Al Queda type multinational terrorists
linked
historically to Iraq in the Balkan War of the 1990s.
Clinton waged against Serbian Christians, Jews.
Like the Mafia boss of all bosses he fancied himself to
be, as he watched videos of his favorite movie, "The Godfather", and
its
sequels, Saddam used "cut-outs" to separate himself from his
international terrorism, so that he could maintain "plausible
deniability". During the evil war against Serbia of the 1990s the
back-stabbing Saddam pretended to embrace the Serbian
cause, but secretly engaged in anti-Serbian terrorism in the Balkans.
"during the night of July 18th -19th ,1998 a group of several hundred
heavily armed foreign mercenaries
(mostly "mujahideens, "Islamic "holy
warriors") frontally attacked from Albania the Yugoslav Army border
guards near the Djeravici mountain. The attack was repulsed by the
Serbian troops, and the foreign assailants suffered heavy casualties.
Among the dead were six mercenaries from Yemen, five from Saudi
Arabia, four from Macedonia. A short while later, Yugoslav
authorities
arrested Nuri Salip Muhamed, a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iraqi Army
as
he was trying to enter Yugoslavia illegally from Bulgaria. This Iraqi
officer, who reportedly spoke perfect Serbian, was supposed to have
commanded the July 18th-19th, 1998 terrorist attack from Albania. But
lucky for him, he had not arrived there in time."

"September 21st, 2001 U.S. Pro-Israel Stance Blamed
The National Jewish Democratic Council (NJDC) condemned the recent
comments of
U.S. Rep. James Traficant (D-Ohio), who on Sept. 12 blamed the
deadly terrorist
assault on America's support for Israel.
Traficant, long suspected of mob ties in his hometown of Youngstown,
reportedly
has accepted since 1996 more than $20,000 in campaign donations from
the
People's Mujahedin Organization of Iran, a group the State
Department describes
as a front for terrorists.
Traficant "is an embarrassment to the Congress, and his
congressional colleagues
should marginalize him as much as possible and say publicly that his
words are
beyond the pale," NJDC Executive Director Ira Forman said."

"There were groups that were pretty scary, but if someone had
the money, he'd find a way to help them," a former aide says. As both
congressman and senator, Torricelli has championed the cause of a
revolutionary Iranian group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), identified
by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist organization. Many
Iranian-born MEK sympathizers have given Torricelli money ($136,000,
according to one estimate), including $1,000 from Canada's chief MEK
organizer, who wrote her check to Torricelli from her new home in
Washington a week after an Ottawa court upheld her deportation,
according to The American Spectator. Torricelli, in turn, sponsored
several resolutions and letters supporting the group as a "democratic
alternative" to the Muslim fundamentalist regime and protesting U.S.
sanctions against it-the Mujahedin advocacy group in America, the
National Council of Resistance, was labeled an "alias for the MEK" by
the State Department and barred from receiving any funds to operate
on
U.S. soil. The State Department is on solid ground. Although it
portrays itself as a democratic grass-roots opposition, the MEK
killed
U.S. military attachés in the 1970s and called for restrictions on
Jewish businesses; its military wing is based in armed camps in Iraq,
backed by Saddam Hussein. In the past two years, it has openly
claimed
credit for the killing of three high-ranking members of the Iranian
government, according to congressional testimony by then-Assistant
Secretary of State Martin Indyk. Fears about Iranian terrorist-linked
donors even led Torricelli's staff to joke among themselves about who
would go outside to "start the car to see if it blows up," a source
recalls.- Torricelli has also managed to appeal to organizations with
virulent anti-Semitic positions. In 1993, for instance, he was the
keynote speaker at a banquet co-sponsored by the United Association
for Studies and Research (UASR), an organization identified by
anti-terrorism experts and Israeli intelligence officials as the
political front for the Hamas terrorist group. Torricelli sat on the
dais next to Ahmed Bin Yousef, the head of UASR, who champions the
Hamas cause. When attacked for his appearance at the banquet during
his Senate campaign, Torricelli claimed in a news conference that he
didn't know that the UASR was a sponsor or that it was tied to Hamas.
Apparently he missed the front-page story in The New York Times
several months earlier that exposed its alleged terrorist
connections.
Torricelli is endlessly creative in trolling for support from ethnic
communities. He founded a congressional Pakistani caucus and told a
dinner hosted by a Pakistani-American PAC in 1996 exactly what they
wanted to hear: "Pakistan cannot be intimidated into accepting
nuclear
nonproliferation as was attempted by the U.S. Congress."

Clinton raises money for Sen. Torricelli, ignores Lewinsky interview
March 4, 1999
Web posted at: 12:20 p.m. EST (1720 GMT)
NEWARK, New Jersey (AllPolitics, March 4) -- President Bill Clinton
attended a
fund-raiser Wednesday night for Sen. Robert Torricelli that raised
$2.15 million
for the New Jersey Democrat, officials said.
A spokesman said the $2.15 million that the $1,000-a-plate dinner
brought in was
the most ever raised in a single night for a member of Congress. The
fund-raiser
far exceeded earlier expectations of $1.2 million.
Torricelli proved to be a staunch supporter of the president
throughout his
Senate impeachment trial. In his speech, Clinton praised the
senator: "He has
been my friend in good times and bad and I will never forget it."
The fund-raiser took place just before Monica Lewinsky's two-hour
interview on
ABC with Barbara Walters aired nationally.

Shirley A. Cloyes married Joseph DioGuardi in June 1998 according to
the
material about her excerpted from below in which she is described
as "Balkan
Affairs Adviser" to the Albanian American Civic League,whose
President is Joseph
DioGuardi, which states that :"In 1983, she coauthored a book
entitled To Work
and To Love with German political theologian Dorothee Soelle and
joined the
staff of The Seabury Press as an editor. Following the closure of
the house in
1984, she became marketing director and editorial consultant in
Black and
women's studies at Orbis Books.

In 1986, she joined the staff of Lawrence Hill &amp; Company, an
offshoot of the
breakup of Hill &amp; Wang, as associate publisher. The press
specialized in African
American and African studies, the Middle East, women's studies, and
controversial domestic and international political issues. When
Larry Hill died
in 1988, she took over the house and was its publisher until the end
of 1995.
Some of the noteworthy titles that she published are The Politics of
Heroin: CIA
Complicity in the Global Drug Trade by Alfred W. McCoy, Assata: An
Autobiography
by Assata Shakur, Ghosts in Our Blood: With Malcolm X in Africa,
England, and
the Caribbean by Jan Carew, My Friend, the Enemy by Uri Avnery, and
M.I.A. or
Mythmaking in America by H. Bruce Franklin.

In 1995, she published Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare, the first book
on the
causes and far-reaching consequences of the Balkan conflict written
from the
perspective of Bosnian Muslim, Croatian, Serbian, and Macedonian
journalists who
opposed the war inside the former Yugoslavia. That year she became
the Balkan
Affairs Adviser to the Albanian American Civic League. She has since
written and
lectured widely about the Albanian dimension of the Balkan conflict
and made
eight trips to the region.

Cloyes proposed the first Congressional hearing on the Albanian
dimension of the
Balkan conflict. Following the hearing in February 1995, which
included
representatives from
all the Albanian lands in the former Yugoslavia, she and Civic
League President
Joseph DioGuardi traveled with Yugoslav dissident Mihaljo Mihaljov
to Macedonia
at the invitation of Albanian leaders there to monitor the reopening
of the
Albanian-language University of Tetova. The Macedonian government
attacked the
university on the morning of their departure, killing a student,
wounding
hundreds, and jailing the professors. In September of that year, she
traveled to
Tirana with DioGuardi and Congressman Benjamin Gilman, chair of the
House
Committee on International
Relations, to meet with then President Sali Berisha and to Istanbul
to make the
case for the
the independence of Kosova at the National Press center and at the
University of
Marmara.

Cloyes has testified before Congress at two historic turning points
in the life
of the Albanian nation. In July 1996, she testified on behalf of the
State of
Albania before the House Committee on International Relations and
exposed the
role of Nicholas Gage of the Panepirotic Federation and the Albanian
Communists
in attempting to overthrow the democratically elected government of
Sali
Berisha. In 1998, she testified in support of U.S. troop deployment
in Kosova,
following Bob Dole, Jean Kirkpatrick, and Henry Kissinger.

In February 1998, after the Serbian army attacked Drenice, Cloyes
worked with
CNN to gain more complete coverage of the crisis in Kosova. In
March, she and
DioGuardi shifted the focus of a Congressional hearing with U.S.
Balkan envoy
Robert Gelbard from Bosnia to Kosova, and positioned the questions
that forced
Gelbard to retract his earlier depiction of the KLA as a "terrorist"
organization. In August of that year, she published two major
articles on U.S.
foreign policy in the Balkans: "The Agony of Kosova" and "Presiding
over
Genocide: The Shame of the West." Cloyes is the author of the Civic
League's
October 1999 public declaration, entitled "Resolving the Albanian
National
Question," which examines the internal and external factors that
stand in the
way of creating a free and independent Kosova and bringing a just
and lasting
peace to the Balkans.

With the start of the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia in March
1999, Cloyes
and DioGuardi appeared separately and together on more than 50 radio
and TV
broadcasts. Since the war ended in June 1999, they have made three

"Trooper Executed By Female Militant

New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster was murdered by JoAnne
Chesimard. On
May 2, 1973, New Jersey State Police Troopers James Harper and
Werner Foerster
were patrolling the New Jersey Turnpike in the East Brunswick area.
They stopped
a car with three occupants and began to question them. The female
passenger,
JoAnne Chesimard, was a member of the Black Liberation Army. She
suddenly pulled
out a semi-automatic pistol and opened fire. Trooper Foerster was
struck twice
in the chest and Trooper Harper was hit in the shoulder. Chesimard
then picked
up Trooper Foerster's service weapon and shot him twice in the head,
execution
style, while he lay in the road.

Killer Escapes

JoAnne Chesimard, a member of the Black Liberation Army and
convicted murderer
Chesimard was quickly captured, convicted and sentenced to life plus
26 to 33
years in prison-authorities wanted to make sure this dangerous woman
would never
roam the streets again. But despite their best efforts, Chesimard
wasn't going
to let the law stop her. On November 2, 1979, Chesimard escaped from
prison with
the help of a domestic terrorist group. In the early 1980's, she
resurfaced in
Cuba under the protection of Cuban Premier Fidel Castro.

The Fight For Justice Continues

$1 million reward poster for Chesimard
Two generations of New Jersey State Police detectives have been
assigned to the
fugitive investigation since Chesimard's escape. Authorities refuse
to let
Chesimard go without a fight-Chesimard has now been placed on all of
the
terrorist watch lists and there is a $1 million reward for
information leading
to her arrest. Authorities hope the reward will destabilize
Chesimard's sense of
security inside Cuba and lead to her capture, and subsequently, her
return to
New Jersey."

The terrorist group mentioned above: "the Black Liberation Army"
was an offshoot of the original BLACK PANTHER PARTY.

"30 Years in the Making-Justice at Last for Slain Officer

In the early hours of 3 November 1971, a young Atlanta police
officer by the
name of Jimmy Greene was ambushed and killed as he sat in his patrol
wagon
eating his late-night supper. On 13 October 2003-some 32 years later-
the man
responsible was found guilty of his murder in Fulton County Superior
Court.

Freddie Hilton (51) was convicted of murder in the long-ago death of
Jimmy
Greene in a case prosecuted by Deputy District Attorney Al Dixon,
Senior
Assistant District Attorney Michele McCutcheon, and Senior Assistant
District
Attorney Peggy Katz. Atlanta Police Detective Jimmy Rose and Senior
Investigator
M.C. Cox of the District Attorney's Office investigated the case.
Judge
Stephanie Manis will sentence Hilton on 10 November, and he faces a
possible
double life sentence in prison.

At the time of the murder, Hilton was a member of an organization
known as the
"Black Liberation Army," a militant group infamous for attacks on law
enforcement officers in New York City and across the country. A
handful of the
group's members had come to Atlanta after breaking away from the
Black Panther
Party in the early 1970s. Hilton was among these.

Officer Greene, engaged to be married and the father of one infant
daughter, was
sitting in his vehicle at a gas station at the intersection of
Memorial Drive
and Boulevard when he was approached by Hilton and his now-dead co-
conspirator
Twyman Meyers. Hilton shot Officer Greene three times at close
range, stole his
revolver and badge, and fled the scene. A witness saw Greene slumped
over in the
front seat and soon realized he had been shot. Greene died two hours
later.

Several other former BLA members testified at the trial that Hilton
and Meyers
returned to the group's residence where the pair bragged of the
killing.

Shortly after the incident, Atlanta police found a witness who said
he heard
Hilton confess to the killing, but then-District Attorney Lewis
Slaton felt
there was not enough evidence to bring formal charges. So the story
ended
there...or so it seemed.

In early 2001, Detective Rose received a call from New York City
Police
Detective Chris Karolkowski who had come across Hilton as a suspect
in a child
molestation case and soon discovered that he had been the prime
suspect in
Greene's murder. Rose soon re-opened the case, and, with the help of
Investigator Cox, a Grand Jury indicted Hilton for the murder in
July of last
year. (Incidentally, Rose and Cox received the National Association
of Police
Organizations' highest honor last year for their work on the case.)
Hilton, who
had changed his name to Kamau Sadiki and was now working in
telecommunications
in New York, was brought back to Atlanta to face trial.

Aside from justice for Officer Greene, perhaps the most positive
aspect of this
painful incident was the re-uniting of Greene's long-estranged
daughter Melody
Adams (now 34) of North Carolina with aunts and uncles she had never
known.
Hearing about the trial in the news, Adams traveled to Atlanta to
sit in on the
trial and soon revealed her identity to other family members in
attendance. A
family long-separated by a brutal crime was now re-united."

The Albanian Connection; As Italians Move Up, a New Group Does the
Pizza and Pasta source: THE NEW YORK TIMES
More information. April 3, 2001, Tuesday
By DEXTER FILKINS (NYT); Metropolitan Desk
Late Edition - Final, Section B, Page 1, Column 2,
DISPLAYING ABSTRACT - Americans becoming owners of Italian-American
restaurants and pizza parlors in New York City and surrounding area;
various reasons cited"

Hillary Clinton has long masqueraded as a champion of women's
rights, yet the
Balkan Wars perpetrated by her husband Bill Clinton , far from
helping the
rights of women, actually harmed women.
"Sex Slaves: Trafficking in human beings from Moldova to Italy
...the West has helped to create the demand, by stationing tens of
thousands of
troops in the Balkans. Not all of these sex slaves' clients are
soldiers and
international workers, but their presence has greatly fuelled the
demand for
brothels in the Balkans. Certainly, the volume of trafficking,
which picked up
in the spring of 1999 as soon as Nato troops arrived in Macedonia in
anticipation of military strikes against Yugoslavia [1], has greatly
increased
since the Kosovo war. Finally, the West has helped to create the
link between
the supply and the demand by supporting, in the Kosovo war, the very
Albanian
Mafia which now controls this market. The fact that there is so
much reporting
now on the matter of sex slaves may be an indication that the powers
that be in
the West are beginning to ditch those whom they portrayed during the
spring of
1999 as passive and innocent victims....

It is clear that the Albanian Mafia controls prostitution in Italy,
and that a
very large number of prostitutes there are effectively slaves.
Although not all
the girls in Italy are from Moldova - many come from Nigeria and
Albania - it
has been affirmed by one of the leading authorities on prostitution
that they
are kept in captivity. "All the women currently on the streets (of
Italy) are
slaves. The proof is that the Nigerians, the Albanians, the
Romanians and the
women from Eastern European countries all have their passports taken
away by
their pimps. There is not one metre of street in which prostitution
is not
controlled by criminals," according to Don Oreste Benzi, a priest in
Verona who
has founded a charity which works with prostitutes. Benzi goes
on, "The
Albanians operate in family clans, in `joint ventures' with the
Mafia in Eastern
Europe and Italy. No new pimp can start operating in Italy without
paying a
percentage to the person who already controls the territory. Any
mistakes are
punished by death. For the Albanians, vendetta is second nature:
the concept
of forgiveness does not exist."[7] According to Benzi's charity, the
Association of the Community of Pope John XXIII, 48% of the
prostitutes in Italy
are from Eastern Europe; 35%-40% are minors (from 12 to 18 years
old); and 26%
have been kidnapped and taken from their countries of origin by
force.[8]

Hillary Clinton has also masqueraded as someone concerned about
Children's
Rights. Once again, the Balkan Wars perpetrated by her husband Bill
Clinton
actually harmed children too.
"Sexual exploitation of children
An especially appalling aspect of the trade in human beings is the
sexual
exploitation of children. BHHRG representatives interviewed Mariana
Petersel,
the Director of Save the Children in Moldova, whose organisation has
started to
house and rehabilitate young women and girls who have been forced
into sex
slavery. The youngest victim with which they have dealt was nine
years old.
260 victims of sex slavery have been housed and helped by Save the
Children
during 2000. They had been in various Balkans countries: Kosovo,
Albania,
Macedonia, Italy, and Greece.

Italy's sexual slave trade

Many prostitutes in Italy come from Albania
In the first of two special reports, the BBC's Brian Barron
investigates Italy's
clandestine trade in sexual slaves and the Albanian criminals behind
the
business.
It is estimated that there could be more than 40,000 foreign
prostitutes on the
streets of Italy - and the numbers are increasing.
The streetwalkers venture out every night after 10, on the edge of
big cities
like Rome.
Each trip was awful but that was my choice. If I returned to
Albania I was
dead.
Prostitute
In the Eor district, they are Albanian or from other former
communist countries.
Most are controlled by Albanian mafia gangsters. A handful have
travelled to
Italy through their own efforts.
One streetwalker whose identity must be kept secret recalls her
particular
journey.
"I came by boat," she says.
"I was smuggled in. I had tried four times. It was a horrible trip."
"It was winter, cold and raining. It was a terrible risk. I saw dead
people with
my own eyes."
"Each trip was awful but that was my choice. If I returned to
Albania I was
dead."
"Dead or alive - this was my only choice."
Tarantelli: Women are held in slavery
The former Italian MP, Carol Bebbe Tarantelli, says that the women
are slaves.
"They are brought here," she says.
"Their passports are destroyed often, usually as a matter of fact
they are
tortured to break their wills."
"They're moved around from place to place so they don't know where
they are.
They don't speak the language."
"They're terrified and they can't escape. They're held in slavery."
Poverty

For many of the girls, the journey began in their Albanian homeland.
In Durres, most people are out of work, surviving on remittances
from relatives
abroad, like the girls on the streets of Italy.
In its poverty and human desperation it is typical of countless
Albanian
communities.
Once Albania was an all-powerful communist police state. It is now a
country
beyond the rule of law.
The police chief of Durres, Colonel Albert Pilo, is having a
difficult time
stamping out the smuggling of young girls.
Durres: Lawlessness and poverty prevail
"We have had some success against traffickers in prostitutes," he
says.
"We've arrested at least three. But a big problem is what to do with
the girls
caught up in the system, especially if they come from outside
Albania."
"The fact is we do not have any organisation for helping them."
"At times we've had to keep the girls in prison because there's
nowhere for them
to go."
Dramatic pictures, taken two years ago, show one of the speedboats
of the
Albanian mafia being intercepted by Italian security forces.
An Albanian mafia speedboat with its human cargo heads for Italy
It was trying to land a batch of illegal immigrants on Italy's
Adriatic coast.
Boxes of drugs were thrown overboard as the gangsters, travelling at
60 miles an
hour, evaded the helicopters and ships trying to encircle them.
On the coast at Lecce, the Italian Justice Ministry, working with a
Catholic
charity, has launched another kind of assault on the Albanian mafia.
In one camp for illegal immigrants, Father Cesari helps run a
witness protection
programme for former prostitutes from Albania and Eastern Europe.
Hope for some of the women in the witness protection programme
"The choice of denouncing their pimps is an act of responsibility,"
he says.
"It's not an easy decision to make. So these girls must have the
courage to do
it.
"To cut all ties with the past. By pointing the finger at those who
abuse them
there is the chance that some of the guilty will be brought to
justice."
Eighty girls have collaborated. They have been rewarded with the
right to remain
in Italy and, when necessary, new identities.
However, 500 declined because they were afraid of the godfathers.

The notorious Mafioso Johnny Dio is described here. Actor Frank
Pellegrino
played Johnny DioGuardi in Martin Scorcese's 1990 film GOODFELLAS.
Was Johnny
DioGuardi a relative of Joe DioGuardi? We would like to know. If you
know please
post your materials and sources for them.

Joseph J. DioGuardi was born in the Bronx, New York, on September
20th, 1940.

Johnny DioGuardi was born in East Harlem on April 28th, 1914.

Johnny Dio, a.k.a. Johnny DioGuardi was not Jewish by any stretch of
the
imagination. DioGuardi specialized, among other things, in
victimizing Jews.
DioGuardi victimized some Jews directly and victimized other Jews
less
directly, as they became unwitting customers. The article below
notes that "A
salesman for the company testified in 1969 that often the meat they
delivered to
retailers was "sometimes light green and sweaty and often was an
atrocity to
perpetrate on our customers."

"On November 14th, 1964, two NYPD detectives sat in a basement in
Queens, New
York, listening to a tape recording of the conversations coming out
of a bug-a
tiny wireless microphone and radio transmitter hidden in the office
of Norman
LoKietz, president of the Merkel Meat Company. They were listening
to evidence
that illustrated with chilling clarity that the Mafia controlled an
industry
that robbed the public of more than just its money. It was also
stealing its
health and safety. In the taped conversations, the name "Johnny Dio"
kept
cropping up. The cops knew who he was.

Dio's photograph, with a cigarette dangling from one corner of a
viscous snarl
as he slugged a United Press photographer outside a Senate committee
hearing
room, appeared on front pages of newspapers all over the country,
because it so
perfectly matched the average person's preconception of what a Mafia
thug should
look like.

As the police developed their investigation into the Merkel Meat
Company and the
links with Dio, aka Johnny Dioguardi, it became increasingly obvious
that the
Lucchese crime family was earning big money from its involvement in
the movement
of substandard and, at times actually rotten meat, that was being
sold into the
retail marketplace.

Dioguardi was a master fixer and controller of locals and unions
and, through
this influence, was able to manipulate opportunities for himself and
the
Lucchese family in a wide range of areas.

The Nassau DA William Cahn illustrated Dioguardi's association with
one
particular company that showed his ability to corrupt and control.

In 1963, he joined Consumer Kosher Productions as a salesman on a
salary of $250
a week. By 1966, he was earning $5000 per week, and in addition had
taken over
control of the business. He used this company as a vehicle to gain
control of
the low price kosher meat business. Essentially his method was to
take over an
organization, buy in supplies and create an extended line of credit,
never pay
his debtors, and when the business went bust, move on to the next
one.A salesman
for the company testified in 1969 that often the meat they delivered
to
retailers was "sometimes light green and sweaty and often was an
atrocity to
perpetrate on our customers." Consumer Kosher Productions eventually
went
bankrupt, and Dioguardi shifted what remaining assets there were to
another
company called Tel Aviv. That company also went belly-up in due
course and he
then set up a firm called First National Kosher Provisions. And so
it went on.
Eventually the law caught up with him and he was indicted, and in
1967 was
sentenced to five years in prison and fined $10,000. By this time,
Dioguardi had
been connected to the Lucchese family for over thirty years.
Johnny Dio under arrest(AP)

Johnny Dio was born in East Harlem on April 28th, 1914. He grew up
on Forsythe
Street in Little Italy where his father Dominick owned a bicycle
shop there. By
1930, he was already at age fifteen an apprentice young hood. After
a year and a
half at Stuyvesant High School, he left to begin work. Through the
influence of
his uncle, James "Jimmy Doyle" Plumeri, a prize fighter, racketeer
and upcoming
soldier in the Gagliano family, he became a leg-breaker and budding
extortionist
working the Garment Center. He was also, as legend has it, one of
the gangsters involved in the so called "Murder Inc." group
that worked
out of Brownsville, East New York, in the 1930's carrying out
murders....Darkly handsome-so dark that he
was called
"Blackie" as a young street punk-wearing $250 silk suits and a
pleasant smile,
well dressed, well barbered and well manicured, he was always
careful to give
the appearance of an urbane and successful businessman.In 1935,
Thomas Dewey,
the crusading New York DA, listed Dioguardi as among the most
dangerous hoods in
the city. And all this before he was twenty-one years old! In 1937
he got a
three-to-five year sentence at Sing-Sing after being convicted with
his uncle
and several other mobsters for extortion and assault. They had been
extracting
$5000 from every trucker in the garment district, plus demanding a
premium on
every suit and coat made in the area.In 1944, he was indicted for
operating an
illegal still, but the charge was dismissed.In 1954, he was tried
and convicted
for failure to pay state income tax in connection with his continued
shakedown
of operators in the garment district. For that, he got sixty days.In
November
1957, he went on trial with some Teamster officials for shaking down
owners of
stationery stores. After a four week trial, he was convicted and
sentenced to
two years in jail.By the time he was forty, he was a "made man" in
the Gagliano
family which was now referred to as the Lucchese family, operating
as a capo, or
crew chief, and he was a multi-millionaire. He was highly regarded
in the family
as a "ferocious earner" the highest accolade that can be bestowed on
a member of
organized crime, generating in excess of $100,000 each week. He was
so rich, his
standard Christmas present to his wife was a shoe box stuffed with
$50,000 and a
sweet little note such as " buy yourself some nice clothes,
honey."He lived in
great style, wining and dining at the best hotels and restaurants in
town, but
always reserved Sundays to meet with family and friends, and prepare
lunch or
dinner. Like so many mobsters of Italian-American extraction, he was
an
excellent cook, and loved to entertain at his beautiful and lavish
home in
Freeport Avenue, Point Lookout, Long Island, which he had purchased
for $75,000
in the early 1960's. His legitimate business fronts which
contributed to his
significant tax returns each year, included many highly profitable
clothing
factories, and also Jard Products at 260 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan,
which sold
promotional items to commercial establishments. One of their major
customers was
the retail chain Waldbaums.His skill as a union manipulator was
legendary in the
Mob, and on one occasion, Thomas Lucchese arranged for him to travel
to Los
Angeles to help out an old friend, Jack Dragna, the boss of the L.A.
Mafia
family. The ILGWU was trying to drive out non-union, cheap Mexican
labour from
Dragna's factories, but Dioguardi's expertise secured waivers on
every important
stipulation set up and foiled the union's attempt.In the 1950's,
Senate
investigations named Dioguardi as one of the masterminds that
manipulated the
unions operating out of Idlewild, the vast 5,000 acre international
airport that
would one day be called Kennedy.When Jimmy Hoffa was making his play
to become
president of the giant Teamsters Union in 1957, he turned to an old
friend,
Johnny Dio for help. It wasn't clear whether or not the majority of
the New York
area locals supported Hoffa, and this was necessary to swing enough
voters to
support his control of the mid western region, secured through the
Chicago Mob's
help. The solution was to create more locals: enough to establish a
majority.
This was done by setting up "paper" locals-locals with few if any
members-that
could swing the balance in the New York voting.Dioguardi engineered
the creation
of seven new Teamster unions. The extra supply of delegates from
these
guaranteed Hoffa control of the New York delegation of the Teamsters
convention.
These seven locals were basically sham fronts, composed not of
working people,
but friends and relatives of Johnny Dio. Hoffa won the
nomination.With hindsight
it was probably the start of Hoffa's imbroglio with the Justice
Department,
resulting in his war with Robert Kennedy, his indictment, trial and
imprisonment
in 1967, release in 1971 and the events that led up to the fateful
rendezvous on
July 30th, 1975, at the Manchus Red Fox Restaurant in Detroit. He
went there to
meet up with three men. It was a rendezvous from which he never
returned,
vanishing off the face of the earth; murdered probably by Salvatore
Briguglio, a
man connected to the Genovese crime family. Hoffa became a ghostly
testator who
haunts the Teamsters trust to this day.John Dioguardi was
undoubtedly one of the
most powerful members of the Lucchese crime family. His influence
was felt in
many areas, particularly those relating to labor. He is remembered
however, more
than anything, for one especially terrible act.In the early hours of
Thursday
April 5th, 1956, a nationally known newspaper columnist and
commentator on labor
affairs called Victor Riesel made a radio broadcast in New York. The
41-year-old
Riesel was a crusading journalist, specializing in investigating
union
corruption and Mob-influenced officials. Writing for the Daily
Mirror, his
column was syndicated in 193 newspapers. This night, he interviewed
two workers
from Local 138 of the International Operating Engineers Union out of
Long
Island. Run by father and son both called William DeKoning, they and
their local
were involved in shaking down contractors and were under
investigation by
Manhattan US attorneys.After the broadcast, Reisel and his
secretary, Betty
Nevins, went to Lindy's restaurant at Broadway and 51st Street for a
late
supper. At 3 a.m. as they were walking to Nevins' car, a man
approached them and
threw sulphuric acid into Riesel's face. Rushed to St. Clare's
Hospital,
surgeons were unable to save his eyesight.
Victor Reisel
A federal investigation established the attacker was a twenty-two-
year-old hood
and longshoreman called Abraham Tevi. He had been hired by one Joe
Carlino and
paid $1,175 to do the job. The money had apparently been put up by
Dioguardi. As
publicity mounted, Tevi became convinced that he had been grossly
underpaid to
carry out a piece of work on such an important person and demanded
$50,000. What
he got instead was two bullets in the head, and his body was found
on July 28th,
lying on Mulberry Street, in Manhattan's Little Italy district.
Although some
people were tried and convicted of the attack on Reisel, the two
prime witnesses
against Dioguardi, Gondolfo Miranti and Domenico Bondo, backed off,
and all
charges against Johnny Dio were dropped in May, 1957.
The assault on Victor Reisel brought a lot of pressure down on
Johnny Dio. The
very action that was aimed at removing a source of irritation,
resulted in far
more damage to his activities that could possibly have occurred had
the assault
not taken place.Despite all the other criminal acts that he was
involved in or
convicted of, Dioguardi is still best known as "the man who blinded
Victor
Reisel." That reputation more than anything else guaranteed that the
police, FBI
and the media would never stop hounding him, and as a result, he
would
eventually spend the rest of his prime years in prison for other
crimes he
committed.Dioguardi always on the lookout for new rackets,
discovered the boom
in fly-by-night stock promotions in the late 1960's. Stock would be
acquired
from a failing company for little or no money; the market would be
rigged in the
stock through a brokerage firm he operated called J.M. Kelsey &amp; Co.
then the
shares would be sold at vastly inflated prices-leaving the investors
to hold the
bag when the fraud was eventually exposed. However fate and the law
finally
caught up with Johnny Dio and, in 1970, he, along with his immediate
boss in the
Lucchese crime family Carmine Tramunti, were indicted on fraud
charges
concerning stocks in two firms, Belmont Franchising Corp. and
At-Your-Service-Leasing Co.He was tried and convicted in December
1973, and
sentenced to a further prison sentence, concurrent to the one he was
already
serving at Danbury Prison in connection with one of his kosher meat
company
scams. Due for parole in August 1979, he died in a prison hospital
the same
year.
Johnny Dio going to prison one last time
Johnny Dioguardi was a good example of the consummate mafioso. He
started young
at fifteen and had a perfect introduction into the world of crime
through the
guidance and help of his uncle. He combined thuggery, cunning, guile
and polish
in an enviable mixture. He made the right kind of connections from
an early age.
Jimmy Hoffa for instance, was a boyhood friend, and Dioguardi used
these
contacts throughout his career as a means of levering his scams and
extortion's
into huge, money-spinning ventures for himself and his crime family.
Like many
criminals, he obviously had the brains and ability to have succeeded
in
legitimate business, had he been that way inclined. The highest
earners in the
Mob work longer hours than any Fortune Top 50 C.E.O.s. Even the
lowest soldiers
will routinely put in eighty hour weeks, seven days to keep on top
of their
scheming and scamming.
When he died in a Pennsylvania prison hospital, his passing
attracted no
newspaper attention. All his wealth and power and almost fifty years
of criminal
depravity seemed to count for nothing at all. It was as though he
had never
existed."

ContributorsBy James Ridgway de Szigethy
Convicted associates of the Pittsburgh Mafia Family, Mafia-
corrupted labor
Unions and Middle Eastern political operatives are among those who
have
contributed to the past two re-election campaigns of Congressman
James
Traficant, an analysis of Federal Election Commission records
reveals. These
records, which are required filings under Federal Election law,
reveal 219
donations by individuals and 212 donations by Unions and Political
Action
Committees. 47 of the personal contributions came from outside the
State of
Ohio, with 35 of those from the State of Virginia. 38 are from
individuals that
indicate a Middle Eastern background of the contributor. Among
the
contributors whose names would probably be recognized by most
Youngstown
residents are Ed Flask, Mark Colucci, David Sugar, Anthony Saadey,
Russell
Saadey, Jr., Sam Traficanti, and fireworks businessmen Bruce Zoldan
and Gerald
Bostocky. Among the contributors whose names would probably NOT
be
recognized by most Youngstown residents are Virginia residents Ali
Asghar
Abbaszadeh, Reza Bulochi, Massud Mirmohammaoi, Ramesh Sepehrrad, and
Javad
Vaziri, Samir Mohammad, Ammar Shafai, and Homayoun Nasser Sharif,
Georgia
resident Hossein Shamsai, Massachusetts residents Mahaz Nasseri and
Hessein
Sadeghpour, Kansas City's Sajadi Sacid, Maryland's Cyrus Samet and
Mahmoud
Tabassi, and San Diego's Mohammad Bigdeli. Russell Saadey Jr.,
a former
investigator for the District Attorney's office in Youngstown, was
indicted last
December on charges he bribed Judges to fix Court cases. Ed
Flask accepted
a plea bargain last year in which he pleaded guilty to felony
charges in regards
to his rip-off of nearly $2 million while running the public water
utility in
Youngstown. Flask first received notoriety during the 1983 Federal
bribery trial
of then-Sheriff James Traficant, when it was revealed that Cleveland
Mafia
associate Charlie "The Crab" Carabbia had secretly tape recorded
Traficant
bragging about how he laundered through Flask's law office part of
the $163,000
in bribe money he accepted from the Mafia. Those same tapes revealed
that
Carabbia was blackmailing Flask with "compromising photographs of
Flask which
would ensure his silence!" Just days later, Carabbia was abducted
and murdered.
B &amp; T Express employee Sam Traficanti was present during some of the
secret tape
-recorded meetings between the Carabbia brothers and Sheriff-elect
Traficant,
but was not charged. Two of Traficanti's fellow employees at B &amp; T
Express also
donated to Traficant's campaign records show. Traficanti is not
related to
Congressman Traficant. Last September, the Congressman's employee
Anthony
Traficanti was subpoenaed by the Federal Grand Jury in
Cleveland.
Congressman Traficant has also received campaign contributions from
Youngstown
resident Walter Terlecki. In recent months, Congressman Traficant
has entered
into the Congressional Record sworn affidavits by Michael "Beef"
Terlecky, a
former Mahoning County Deputy Sheriff who was convicted of taking
bribes from
the Mafia. Terlecky now claims that he was set up by some of the same
authorities that are now involved in the investigation of
Congressman Traficant,
including two public figures who attended an anti-Mafia summit
meeting recently
in Palermo, Sicily. The Congressman has denied a request by the
chairman of the
Mahoning County Board of Elections who is seeking information the
Congressman
claims to have regarding Mafia bribes to the campaigns of elected
officials in
Youngstown. Terlecky also claims that it was he who found the
infamous
Carabbia tapes months before the FBI during an illegal search and
seizure
regarding an investigation into the murder of yet another Youngstown
Mafia
figure, Joe DeRose. However, conversations on the Carabbia tapes
that include
remarks made by Sam Traficanti clearly indicate that the tapes were
recorded
months later than Terlecky's claims, when Traficant had just been
elected
Sheriff. Congressman Traficant is also now claiming that an FBI
agent in
Youngstown was taking bribes from the Mafia 38 years ago in
1962. During
the 1999 Federal bribery trial of Youngstown Sheriff Philip Chance
fireworks
distributor Bruce Zoldan testified that Chance shook him down
for `tribute
money' to Pittsburgh Mafia figure Lenny Strollo. Zoldan's first run-
in with
Chance was in 1983, when Sheriff Traficant and his Deputy Chance
raided Zoldan's
fireworks business two days before their busiest moneymaking period,
the Fourth
of July. Zoldan would also testify that the Gambino Family led by
John Gotti
extorted a huge sum of money from him in order to do business in New
York. The
murder of Mafia figure Joey Naples, who was among those who
contributed to the
$163,000 bribe to Traficant, is believed to be a result of the fight
for control
of the fireworks business. David Sugar pleaded guilty last year
to
Obstruction of Justice charges in regards to his attempts to conceal
evidence
from the Grand Jury in Cleveland investigating financial dealings
between Sugar,
his construction company, and Congressman Traficant. Sugar is
expected to
testify against Traficant at any future criminal proceedings, as is
Traficant's
former employee on his horse farm, Clarence Broad. In November of
last year,
Broad pleaded guilty to charges he tried to hire a hitman to murder
a woman who
was expected to give damaging testimony against Traficant before the
Grand Jury
in Cleveland. Criminal attorney Mark Colucci, who also is among
those who have
given money to Traficant's campaign, responded by alleging in
Federal Court that
Prosecutor Craig Morford had used coercion to force Broad to plead
guilty. Judge
Donald Nugent was not impressed with Colucci's unsubstantiated
claims and
threatened to cite Colucci for Contempt of Court. In 1998 and
2000
Traficant accepted donations from controversial activist James
Zogby, President
of the Arab American Institute. Zogby was recently in the news last
October,
when his appointment as an Advisor to the Al Gore campaign sparked
outrage
worldwide among supporters of Israel. The Jerusalem Post quoted
terrorism expert
Steven Emerson: "Zogby has not only made comments that are
incendiary but he has
also made comments that are anti-Semitic!" "(Zogby has) openly
supported the
Hizbullah!" Emerson is renown for his investigation of the terrorist
bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland in
December, 1988,
killing 270 people, including 35 Syracuse University students.
On June 29,
1993, Senator John McCain entered into the Congressional Record a
public
challenge to the FBI and the Justice Department to share information
on the
People's Mujahidin Organization of Iran, a suspected terrorist
organization that
was involved in a clandestine effort to influence public policy
through an
organized campaign of directing contributions to the campaigns of
selected
members of Congress. Said the Senator: "Given the charges made in a
previous FBI
report that the PMOI has a history of terrorism, an anti-Western
ideology, and
ties to the regime of Saddam Hussein, this should be a matter of
concern to all
Members." In 1997 The Iran Report, a publication of the Middle
East Data
Project, identified four members of Congress as recipients of
campaign donations
from alleged associates of the PMOI. Those four were Robert
Torricelli of New
Jersey, Gary Ackerman of New York, Dan Burton of Indiana and James
Traficant of
Ohio. To date, none of these individuals have been charged with
making illegal
campaign contributions. However, Senator Torricelli is currently in
the news
defending himself against a Chinese fundraiser named David Chang,
who has
pleaded guilty to illegally contributing $53,000 to Torricelli's
1996 campaign.
Numerous recent Media reports show that the Feds are now nearing the
conclusion
of an investigation that began with reports of impropriety regarding
contributions to Torricelli's 1996 campaign. Congressman
Traficant has
developed a huge following in the Arab and Muslim countries in the
Middle East
because of his passionate public support for accused terrorists
Abdel Basset Ali
Mohmed Al-Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, indicted for the
bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103, and former auto worker John Demjanjuk, who was placed on
trial in
Israel on charges he was "Ivan the Terrible," a Nazi concentration
camp guard
responsible for the murders of thousands of Jews during World War
II. Demjanjuk
was convicted and sentenced to death, although the Israeli Supreme
Court later
reversed his conviction. Congressman Traficant then flew to Israel
to personally
escort the accused murderer back to the United States. In the
case of the
terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, Traficant first went public
in this
matter at a press conference in 1989, at which he claimed that the
bombing was
the result of a joint Syrian/CIA operation. ABC News London
correspondent Pierre
Salinger then picked up the story, utilizing Traficant, government
informant
Lester Coleman, and private investigator Juval Aviv as his sources.
Coleman
later pleaded guilty to Perjury charges and admitted his Pan Am/CIA
story was a
hoax. Juval Aviv was placed on trial in 1996 in Manhattan on Federal
fraud
charges unrelated to the
