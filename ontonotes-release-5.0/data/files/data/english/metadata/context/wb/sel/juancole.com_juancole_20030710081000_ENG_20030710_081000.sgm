*The US mounted an unprecedented house to house search in Azamiya and
Karada, quarters of West Baghdad, on Wednesday, closing off streets and
sealing the region, according to az-Zaman. Iraqi police helping in the
operation engaged in a running battle with an armed force, which some
reports described as looters. The police were supported by US soldiers.
In another report, az-Zaman says that US troops used heavy weaponry at
Amiriya, another Baghdad suburb, though no details were given. Then
there was the incident at the building owned by the Iraqi Manufacturers'
association. The association has elected a new governing council, and it
was meeting with the old (Baath-dominated) one to transfer power. A
guard for the old council, who also had served as a secret police spy
for Saddam, opened fire at the new members. Two were wounded, but US
soldiers and the new Iraqi police flooded into the building and arrested
three men. Hadi Hasan, 52, owner of a furniture making factory, said
that the Coalition had presided over elections for the new council on
June 19, but that the Baathists dominating the old one had dragged their
feet in turning over power. Nothing in the Western press about any of
these incidents, as far as I can see. (On Tuesday, Daoud Salman, the
governor of Iraq's central bank, was the victim of an assassination
attempt--gunmen drove by and riddled his car with bullets, wounding two
aides. UPI says he himself took a bullet in the leg, but az-Zaman denies
that he was hurt). Nope, no sign of security yet.

And, there more attacks on US troops in Fallujah on Wednesday. One
rocket-propelled grenade fired toward the US military exploded mid-air,
and the other landed outside a US barracks or office building

(-Paul Haven, AP) . The assailants got away. Thank God, none of our
boys was hurt by either. But that this sort of thing is still going on
daily is a bad sign indeed--especially since Fallujah has been a trouble
spot and presumably the US has tried extra hard to get security there.
The scale of the problem is indicated by the weapons caches seized by
the US on Wednesday. Nearly 500 rocket propelled grenades were found in
a truck near Ramadi west of Baghdad (four men in the truck were
arrested). When you've got trucks alongside the road with that kind of
munitions in them, you've got trouble in River City. The report that a
US soldier may have taken his own life at Balad on Monday may be an
indication of the kind of pressure our troops are under.

Haven adds: "Meanwhile, the U.S.-led occupation government announced
it would begin recruiting members of a new Iraqi army on July 19. Maj.
Gen. Paul Eaton, in charge of training the new army, said the coalition
hoped to have 1,000 soldiers training by August, and 12,000 by year's
end. They hope to train 40,000 by an unspecified date in 2004."

*A national conference of about 90 notable Iraqi women, the first of
its kind in post-Baathist Iraq, is being held in Baghdad . The women
seek to project a "collective voice" representing half the Iraqi
population. They want to find ways to have a role in the new Iraqi
government. Narmin Othman, in charge of higher education in Kurdistan,
said in her opening remarks, "Logic dictates that half of society should
not be kept away from areas they should be a part of." US undersecretary
of state for world affairs, Paula Dobriansky attended and spoke at a
closed session, as did Britain's secretary of state for trade and
industry, Patricia Hewitt. Dobriansky, to her credit, has taken a
special interest in the situation of Iraqi women, though some of her
rhetoric about the situation under Saddam Hussein is a bit
propagandistic. Baathists have been better on women's issues than most
other Arab governments, and if Muqtada al-Sadr, the Shiite leader, ever
gets a real say, 1970s Iraq will look like a golden age for Iraqi women.
US civil administrator Paul Bremer has pledged that women will be
appointed to the governmental council he is forming, but it remains to
see if they can win elections when Iraqis finally go to the polls (they
don't do that well in parliamentary regimes in the West, and certainly
not in the US). Pakistan and some other countries have tried to solve
this problem by having allotted seats for women, often filled on a
proportional basis by party. It isn't something that would appeal to
Americans, who generally focus on fair process rather than on fair
outcome, but Bremer should think about it for Iraq. Iraqi women could be
bulwarks against al-Qaeda- or Khomeini-style fundamentalism if they were
guaranteed a third of the seats in the legislature.

*Bremer announced in a visit to Najaf province that he had allocated
$7.15 million to improving water purification and other services in the
holy city of Najaf (az-Zaman). This is always a winning strategy, and is
a very old one. The Nawabs of Awadh and Sindh in 19th century India
spent millions of rupees on canal digging and providing water to the
holy cities for the pilgrims and seminary students there. Iranian shahs
and Ottoman sultans attempted to curry favor with the local population
by spending money on Najaf. Bremer as Protector of the City of Ali; it
would make for a great painting in the 19th century Orientalist style.
Only, the money pledged seems a little chintzy, given the needs, and the
precedents.

*Veteran journalist Helena Cobban argues that the US should turn
nation-building in Iraq over to the United Nations, which would have
more legitimacy . The UN has a mixed record with nation-building, but
then so does the US. Certainly, it is the perception of my contacts who
have been to Iraq recently that there is less and less respect for the
US there. The Bremer administration seems to think it can get an elected
Iraqi government in place within 15 months. If it cannot, then the US
lacks an exit strategy, and may have to turn to the UN anyway.

*Sheer repression appears to have put an end to the student
demonstrations in Iran, which were expected to crest on Weds., July 9,
but which subsided in the face of massive arrests and threats of
execution by the hardliners. As I said in The Nation, the students were
relatively isolated in their protests, with some support from middle
class families from north Tehran who came down in their cars and honked
their horns in solidarity. The movement won't amount to anything unless
the workers and small businesspeople and a significant number of
reformist clergy join in. But the students' often radical rhetoric
alienated a lot of those groups.
