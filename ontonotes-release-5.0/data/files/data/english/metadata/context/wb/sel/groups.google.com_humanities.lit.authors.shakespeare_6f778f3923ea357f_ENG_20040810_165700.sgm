&lt;&lt;Puttenham seems completely unaware of
the existence of public theaters, but is only concerned
with performances before the monarch:

That for Tragedy, the Lord of Buckhurst, and Master Edward Ferrys
for such doings as I have seen of theirs do deserve the highest price:
Th'Earl of Oxford and Master Edwardes
of her Majesty's Chapel for Comedy and Interlude.

The oddity on the list is the name &quot;Edward Ferrys.&quot; No gentleman of that
name is known to have written plays or even poetry in 16th-Century
England, but an earlier reference in Puttenham sheds some light:

In king Edward the sixths time ... Edward Ferrys ... wrate for the
most part to the stage, in Tragedy and sometime in Comedy or Interlude,
wherein he gave the king so much good recreation,
as he had thereby many good rewards.

It seems likely that Puttenham is referring to George Ferrers, a lawyer,
courtier, and poet of the mid-16th Century, who was the Lord of Misrule
(the supervisor of court entertainments) under Edward VI, and who
contributed to court entertainments in Elizabeth's time. Unfortunately,
not one tragedy or other play by George Ferrers is known to us even by
name; however, if we can judge by the extra attention Puttenham devotes
to him, the lost dramatic output of Ferrers was more impressive to
Puttenham than the lost output of Oxford.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;George Washington Gale Ferris was the creator of the Ferris Wheel
that towered over Chicago at the World's Columbian Exposition. It was
America's answer to the Eiffel Tower and it challenged the engineering
and construction capabilities of the early 1890s. In 1893, thousands of
people waited in line to ride into history. The giant wheel could carry
2,160 people at a time, raising them to the equivalent height of a 26
story building. It was considered an engineering wonder: two 140-foot
steel towers supported the wheel; they were connected by a 45-foot axle,
the largest single piece of forged steel ever made up until that time.
The wheel section had a diameter of 250 feet and
a circumference of ( 3300 / 4 ) feet.

George Ferris was born in Galesburg on February 14, 1859. He came from
an old and historically well-known Galesburg family. An uncle, Nathan
Ferris, developed a market for popcorn in England by popping it up for
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1846. It was a royal marketing ploy.
George and his family moved to Nevada when he was five years old. He
received his engineering degree at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He
opened an engineering firm in Pittsburgh that inspected bridges.

Finding a suitable design proved difficult: Architect Daniel H. Burnham,
who was in charge of selecting the project for the Chicago World's Fair,
complained at an engineer's banquet in 1891 about having found nothing
that &quot;met the expectations of the people&quot;. Among the audience was
George Washington Gale Ferris Jr., owner of a firm that tested iron
and steel. He had an inspiration and scribbled the design for
the Ferris Wheel on a napkin during the dinner.

Nine Detroit steel mills were used to produce the components of the
wheel. The steel was shipped on 150 rail cars. Because of time
constraints, Ferris had to construct the concrete foundations in
January, 1893, when temperatures dropped to ten degrees below zero.
To add to the difficulties, quicksand was encountered while digging the
foundation to bedrock. The wheel was driven by a thousand horsepower
coal-fired steam engine. Sprocket wheels and a driving chain was used to
turn the massive wheel. A spare steam engine was on site as emergency
backup. Upon completion of construction, the wheel held 36 gondolas.
Each gondola had 40 stools plus standing room for 20 additional paying
customers. The fare was a very steep 50 cents, representing a
significant portion of an average man's daily wage. Reportedly it took
about 20 minutes to completely load the wheel. Once fully loaded, it
gave a ten-minute non-stop ride. Its debut at the Exposition was on June
21, 1893, missing the fair's opening day on May 1. Each gondola had a
uniformed conductor to operate the doors and to reassure fearful riders.
The enclosed gondolas had windows that opened for ventilation, but were
designed to prevent passengers from jumping out. The wheel performed
flawlessly in Chicago. It served 38,000 riders on its peak day.

During July high winds struck Chicago, challenging Ferris' design.
Ferris took the opportunity to load himself, his wife, and a reporter
onto the wheel and endured 110 mile per hour winds at the top of the
wheel. The reporter later wrote of the event: &quot;As the mad storm swept
round the cars the blast was deafening. It screamed through the thin
spider-like girders, and shook the windows with savage fury. It was a
place to try better men's nerves. The inventor had faith in his wheel;
Mrs. Ferris in her husband. But the reporter at that moment believed
neither in God nor man.&quot;

By the end of the exposition on October 30th, the Ferris wheel had taken
in nearly three quarters of a million dollars. But costs had been high
and much of the money was due to the fair board. Profits had been small.
The seven week delay in opening the Ferris wheel for business cost the
inventor dearly. The wheel was disassembled, stored, and later
reassembled near Lincoln Park in Chicago. However it failed to generate
large crowds and the revenue was inadequate. An imitation of Ferris'
wheel was constructed at Coney Island in New York. It was advertised
to be the largest Ferris wheel in the world, but in reality it was half the
size of the original. The smaller wheel at Coney Island drew 10,000
people a day in 1896 but over time it became less of a novelty.

George Ferris died November 21, 1896, bankrupt, living alone in a
Pittsburgh hotel. His obituaries reported a variety of causes for death
ranging from typhoid to tuberculosis. There were even unsubstantiated
rumors of suicide. Shortly after his death, a civil lawsuit judgment
went against his company for $84,000.

Ferris' remains were unclaimed 15 months after his death.

Ultimately the original Ferris wheel was sold at a bankruptcy auction
in Chicago. A salvage firm bought it for $8,150. Rather that being
scrapped, the Ferris wheel was shipped to St. Louis and reassembled for
one more try. This time its host was the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.
The Ferris wheel took in over $250,000 again thrilling its riders. But
this failed to even cover the cost of shipment and assembly in St.
Louis. St. Louis proved to be the original Ferris wheel's last whirl. On
May 11, 1906, a dynamite blast announced the end of the original Ferris
wheel. It had survived its creator by a decade.

But as we know, both the name and the ride live on in smaller versions.
Both London and Vienna had Ferris wheels prior to 1900. The Vienna
Ferris wheel was featured in the dramatic conclusion of the old film
classic, The Third Man. Smaller, more mobile versions began to be
constructed. In 1900, at nearby Jacksonville, Ill., a prototype was
constructed and tested in Central Park. It proved successful and by
1906, it gave rise to the Eli Bridge Company that manufactures small
Ferris wheels. The smaller Ferris wheels can be seen and experienced
at county and state fairs, where they cater to those of us
who prefer to be thrilled but not scared to death.&gt;&gt;

Ferris Bueller

What is the name of the painting Cameron stares at at the Art Institute?
It is &quot;Sunday Afternoon on La Grande Jatte&quot; and was by Georges SEURAT
-------------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;&lt;Don Carlos Buell, named for an uncle, was born on 23 March 1818 near
Marietta, Ohio. His father was a prosperous farmer and a Catholic, and
he died in 1823 in a cholera epidemis. In 1826 Don Carlos was sent to
live with an uncle, a prominent farmer and merchant, in Lawrenceburg,
Indiana. Buell worked on the farm, but was also given a solid education
in a local private school where he excelled in mathematics and
horsemanship. His prosperous uncle procured for him admission to West
Point where he spent 4 difficult years, coming very close several times
to being expelled for excessive demerits, although his academic work was
generally at a high level. Buell graduated from West Point in 1841 and
was a company officer of infantry in the Seminole War of 1841-42 during
which he demonstrated his remarkable administrative abilities and a
marked proclivity for enforcing discipline. During the Mexican War he
fought under Taylor and Scott, and was brevetted for bravery 3 times. He
was described as being stern in expression, formal in manner, and stocky
in physique. Sometimes he displayed his arm and upper-body strength by
clasping his wife about the waist, holding her off the floor straight
out before him, and then lifting her to sit on a mantle. After the
Mexican War Buell spent the next thirteen years in the adjutant
general's office and was a lieutenant colonel working as an adjutant of
the Department of the Pacific when the Civil War broke out. Buell was
appointed lieutenant colonel, then brigadier general of volunteers on 17
May 1861, and major general of volunteers on 22 March 1862.

Buell aided McClellan in organizing the Army of the Potomac and was
sent, in November 1861, to Kentucky to succeed Sherman in command after
the latter had buckled under the responsitility and requested of
McClellan that he be relieved. There Buell organized the Army of the ...

On July 23rd, high winds struck Luzern Switzerland, causing the
Hiflyer, carrying 23 Indian tourists from a group of 44, to tilt and
smash against a tree and the walls of nearby buildings of the
Transport
Museum. A section of the floor panel fell out, and although she tried
to grab hold, a 49 year-old tourist fell 30 feet to the roof of the
train hall of the museum. The other passengers suffered injuries, and
her husband is still in intensive care with broken hips and pelvis.
Their son was in the States at the time.

Likewise in July, in Baltimore a similar incident happened with the
Hiflyer, this time fortunately not resulting in any deaths or serious
injuries:

HERE'S AN acrophobic's worst nightmare -- a giant helium balloon and
16 stranded passengers bobbing around like a child's toy for nearly
two
hours. But it happened Saturday at Baltimore's Inner Harbor to the
110-foot-tall Lindstrand HiFlyer balloon at Port Discovery.
Fortunately, no one was seriously hurt, but the event drew
national attention, and no doubt the images broadcast on
television spurred millions to gratefully conclude... &quot;

Pretty awful. I saw the Hiflyer from my apartment across the lake,
but I was always too scared to go up in it. I suffer from vertigo, and
I just didn't trust myself not to freak out when once up there...
I was on holiday in France when it happened here in Luzern, though...

King Henry VI, Part ii
Act 2, Scene 1

KING HENRY VI
The WINDS grow HIGH, so do your stomachs, lords.
How irksome is this music to my heart!
When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.

Titus Andronicus
Act 5, Scene 3

MARCUS ANDRONICUS
You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl
Scatter'd by WINDS and HIGH tempestuous gusts,
O, let me teach you how to knit again
This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,
These broken limbs again into one body;
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
Do shameful execution on herself.
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
Grave witnesses of true experience,
Cannot induce you to attend my words,

Othello, The Moor of Venice
Act 2, Scene 1

CASSIO Has had most favourable and happy speed:
Tempests themselves, HIGH seas, and howling WINDS,
The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--
Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
As having sense of beauty, do omit
Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
The divine Desdemona.

The Rape of Lucrece
Stanza 48

'So, so,' quoth he, 'these lets attend the time,
Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
To add a more rejoicing to the prime,
And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing.
Pain pays the income of each precious thing;
Huge rocks, HIGH WINDS, strong pirates, shelves and sands,
The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.'
