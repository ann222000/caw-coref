I can't get the ignition key out of the ignition cylinder.
The car is in park.
The brake is held down with pressure.
I have tried wiggling, twisting, shaking just about everything.
Eventually, it will slide out as normal.
For the next few insert, start, and remove key - it works fine.
Then for some unknown reason, it hangs again.
It seems to fail at the last notch, when key is turned counter-clockwise
for normal extraction.

I will go try &amp; locate the cable linkage from the automatic shifter
and see if there is an adjustment.

Are there any other things that I can check?

I'm pretty sure the key is good, as we just paid Chrysler $30 to
cut a new one from the VIN.

What is the procedure for removing the key cylinder from the steering
column?  Does it pop out, or do you need to remove the steering wheel
plastic, etc?

Possible recall for this problem on a 2003 Sebring LX ?

Thanks,
Gene

There is an adjustment procedure for the interlock cable at the shifter.
On the LH car, there is a cable adjustment locking latch at the
shifter (at the shiofter end of the interlock cable sheath) that you
release with the key in trhe ignition and the ignition switch in the
fully OFF (steering wheel lock) position and the shifter in Park
position.  This allows the cable to adjust itself to the correct
position.  Then you re-engage the cable aduster latch.  I can only
assume the Sebring is designed the same way (but I can't be 100% sure of
that - someone would have to check the Sebring FSM).

I would try to lubricate by shooting light oil from a spray can inside the
ignition key hole.  Good luck.

go to locksmith, have them code you a new ing. key cylinder to your key. take it
home remove column covers then turn key to run position find small tab on bottom
side of column  (directly under  keyclinder but on outside housing) push in the
button and remove the cylinder  with key  at the same time.   the rest is easy
dealer cost of said repair 200 or more yours 50 bucs

How do you tell if it's a cylinder problem and not a shifter interlock
cable adjustment issue?

THANKS, all.

It turned out to be a really simple fix.
The little plastic part in the shifter mechanism was damaged
on the top. I simply took an Exacto-knife &amp; trimmed off
a tiny bit of plastic that was interfering with the said part
popping up and into the park position. Once the plastic
part could pop up, the cable was pulled and the park
switch was tripped - this sending a signal to let ne have my key.

Seeing that it was a crummy design, I popped of the lid on my
2003 Sebring also - and it was starting to fail as well. All you need to
do is gently trim off a little of the damaged (worn) plastic &amp;
spray on a little white grease - then all is like new.

THANKS again,
Gene

So it wasn't the cylinder itself - I wondered.  Based on this one
incident and a recent discussion on the 300M Club forums, I have to
wonder how many of these &quot;stuck key&quot; scenarios are related to the
shifter interlock and not the cylinder itself.  Seems the knee jerk
reaction by dealers and locksmiths, as well as people on various forums
is that it's always the cylinder needing replacing.

When the ignition cyl goes bad the key will not turn to the start or the off
position or it just wont come out !! If the Shifter Interlock is the problem
the key will go to start and back but will not go to the off position.

chrysler ingition cylinders have a real high failure rate and since the car is not in
front of me, i can only guess but i do more ingition cylinders than shift interlocks
on d.c cars
