I've been told that liberty pewter, when sold was shining like silver.
of course after 90 odd years these items are a bit dull and grey.
My question is should these items be polished and how do I do that,
or should they be left as they are.
Your comments are highly appreciated

Hello Henk,

Hereby what i could find about cleaning pewter:

&quot;pewter obtains a beautiful patina when cared for. You can make it shine
like silver or leave it dark, just as you wish. An old method for cleaning
pewter is pumestone (= puimsteen) mixed with vegtable oil or animal fat,
but such a method is too harsh for the older pieces - no matter how long
they have been neglected. The usual (good) &quot;home&quot; liquids for cleaning
metals are suitable to make it shine and don't corrode the patina. Very
dirty pieces one should put it a bath with parafine-oil (and not white
spirit/terpentine). Depending on how dirty it is you should leave it there
for either a few hours or a few days. Afterwards dry it with old
newspapers and wash it with warm water &amp; dishwashliquid. If you want it to
shine, again, use metalpolish.

Don't ever use metal-sponges: they scratch the surface.

You can keep it 'goodlooking' by protecting the piece with beeswax: it
will protect it against coloring, and keep it shiny for a littlebit more
time.&quot;

My feeling is that cleaning or not depends on:
a) on the state the piece is in (too dirty = not nice, soft shiny patina =
nice)
b) on how the piece was intended to look (you can find that out by looking
up the piece -or a simularone- on internet or a library near you.

Good luck,

Patricia

To polish or not to polish any metalware is a subject of discord
in this group. Most say that you ruin the patina beauty &amp; value
by polishing. No matter how mild the polish is, it can scratch
the surface &amp; flake off miniscule bits of the metal.

I've seen collectors and/or dealers who would not purchase
something unless it is in original bright &amp; shiny condition.
I've also seen others that would not buy something in that
condition, because they don't believe it is old if you can see
your relection in it.

BTW, what exactly is &quot;liberty&quot; pewter?

I think it depends on the type of piece.

Ive seen many pieces of rare and unusual silver at shows which are
polished to
the point one might be affraid that they would get a sunburn from the
glare off of
them.

However, completely on the flip-side, most collectors of hammered copper
would
begin to jitter and froth at the mouth if they ever saw you try to
polish a piece of
Roycroft (etc).

2ndly, although I dont think the &quot;Antique Roadshow&quot; is terribly
representative
of the actual values of some antiques --- Ive seen several pieces of
Tiffany metalware and other metals which had their value cut in 1/2 or
1/3
because at some point in time someone polished off the patina.

My opinion --- never polish a piece of metal of any type.... the patina
gives
it a nice antique feel (afterall it is an antique.)

Can't claim to know anything about Liberty Pewter, but I did a quick
search on eBay, and came up with the following examples. (Please note,
these are not my auctions, nor do I know the persons who are auctioning
them, I'm just pointing to the for discussion purposes.)

http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=176342844
http://cgi.ebay.com/aw-cgi/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=175413802

I thought it was interesting that one of the pieces had been polished to
a brilliant shine, and one had not. The polished piece had the higher
bid when I looked, but the unpolished piece seemed to have a lot more
character, at least it fit my tastes more.

Henk, how about showing us the piece you have? (Of course, don't post a
photo to the newsgroup directly, post it to a web page and then post a
link to the newsgroup.) I'd like to see it.

I did see the sideboard pic, but somewhere along the line of that
tremendously long thread that changed subjects several times, I
opted out &amp; so missed the part on Liberty. Have now corrected
that.

Thanks for pointing out the thread. It doesn't pay to be in a

importance.

"/> Liberty &amp; Co was founded in 1875 by Arthur Lasenby Liberty
(1843-1917). &quot;In the late 1890's silverware and pewterware ventures
were added to Liberty's already multifarious activities under the
trade-names of 'Cymric' and 'Tudric' respectively.&quot;* If I'm not
mistaken, there was discussion not too long ago about Liberty, and
Ronnie (I believe) posted some pics.

mcat
*quoted from _Arts &amp; Crafts in Brittain and America_ by Anscombe &amp;
Gere, because I couldn't paraphrase it any better. This book has a
picture of a lovely two-branched pewter candlestick with enamel
insets, designed by Archibald Know for Liberty &amp; Co., circa 1905, and
it looks like it gleams.

you lurking still?] I can't get fussed about the Liberty stuff..this
has no place in a metalware collector's repetoire...and is for the
'arty farty' brigade.

We've been here many times before, but cleaning early pewter is like
sand-blasting a Georgian side-table...it is **NOT** a personal choice,
to do so is just sheer ignorance and vandalism.

BTW and OT did you know that polish/Polish is the only word in the
English language that changes its pronounciation when capitalized?

Have to disagree with you on this one, polish and Polish are homonyms,
they are not the same word, despite the identical spelling.

&gt;&gt; Going by my &quot;some things are wonderful and some aren't&quot; method,
&gt; the
&gt;&gt; unpolished one is wonderful. I have never been taken by silver, but
&gt; this
&gt;&gt; makes me want to collect. Very cool.
&gt;&gt; The other one is O.K., but I'd never buy it to keep.
&gt;&gt; So we agree. But that's what I think.
