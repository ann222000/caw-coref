There is still one slot available for a Huntsville team. At this time there
are 3 HSV teams registered for the Turkey tournament and 4 slot s are being
reserved for HSV based teams, leaving 1 slot open..

If you would liketo enter a 4th HSV team but haven't for some reason, let me
know. All you need to enter a team is: 5 Men and 3 women who can play on
Nov 19/20.

From the rosters of the 3 HSV team that are registered for Turkey
tournament, I can see that there are a lot of HSVillians out there that whpo are not on
a Turkey Tournament team. SO my estimate is that there is someone could put
together a pretty good team. Someone just needs to make the effort.

As a second alternateive to someone putting a team together is:

If you want to play on a Turkey Tournament team but don't want to be the
team captain, and don't mind who else is on your team, then send me an e-mail
saying that you want to play in the Turkey Tournament and that you don't care
who else plays on your team. I'll see how many positive responses I get and
see if there is enough to make a team.

The Turkey Tournament website has been updated and has the current list of
teams (paid and promised, HSV and out of towners).

So, let me know if you want to play in the Turkey but haven't got a team
yet.\\

IF you send me a response that you want to ply, I'll have to asssume that
you don't mind who else you play with and that I can count on you to play.

I'll notify you when /if enough people sign up to play on this Ultra HSV
pick up team.
