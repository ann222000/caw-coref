Sampolit Film - The Latvian Legion

http://youtube.com/watch?v=1H8TEVO1dxQ

Two divisions were to be formed on the Latvian soil during the Second
World War. They were to form the core of the Latvian Legion which was
created in order to prevent a new Soviet occupation. The 15th --
Latvian 1st Division and 19th -- Latvian 2nd Division along with the
other Latvian military units it had a combat strength up to 165,000
men at its peak.

The Latvian Legion was an unique battlegroup what was built on what
stood on patriotism and high fighting moral. The legionaries continued
the fight till the bitter end -- some dedicated their entire life
fighting against the Soviet occupation.
The Western countries yielded to the pressure of the Soviet Union and
did not object to Latvia and other Baltic States remaining part of the
Soviet Union. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia found themselves the only
occupied states, whose independence was not restored after the Second
World War. Only in 1991 it became possible to eliminate this
historical injustice and the Baltic States regained their national
independence.

In the end, the Latvians were vindicated - they were cleared of any
war crimes in 1950 by the US Congress statement which recognized the
difference of the Baltic SS Legions from the German SS. Not many
surviving members of the Latvian Legion are left today in Latvia. But
each year the veterans, meet to remember their suffering and
sacrifices. They see themselves as Latvian patriots who believed that
they were fighting for the restoration of a free Latvia. For this
reason, March 16th, the anniversary of a major Latvian Legion battle
in Russia, was chosen as a day of solemn remembrance.

This video is about the soldiers and legionaries who gave everything
to save their own country. It also describes a nation whose
independence and youth was violently taken away. It is about a country
who suffered after the war 50 more years. A country to whom the Second
World War did not end on the 8th of May 1945.

The matter of the Latvian SS is still hotly debated. In Latvia and
Estonia they are officially recognized as freedom fighters

Waffen SS was a criminal organization responsible for horrendous
crimes against humanity.

US Congress had no jurisdiction on the matter, therefore its
statements don't change judgments against Waffen SS.

After WWII, at the Nuremberg Trials the Waffen-SS was condemned as a
criminal organisation due to their political connections to the
National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), except conscripts
sworn in after 1943, who were exempted from the judgment on the basis
of involuntary servitude. Therefore, those who voluntarily and proudly
served in that organization remain war criminals.

Countries celebrating war criminals as national heroes show that they
don't stand for any moral values but rather pursue questionable
political agenda.

So have the Parliaments of Tonga and Zaire. Too bad parliaments of
remote foreign countries like Zaire, USA and Tonga have no legal power
to vindicate SS troops.

In fact, as we have just witnessed, US Congress' foreign affairs
statements serve little useful purposes, except for giving Turks new
excuses for invading Iraq and exterminating more Kurds, and for Bush
to say that he prefers oil over honoring the Armenian victims of the
Holocaust in Turkey.

The only judgement that counts and is still in full force is that of
the International Military Tribunal aka the Nuremberg Trials:

The entire Waffen-SS was declared a criminal organisation by the

No matter how much neo-Nazis and revisionists in Latvia, Estonia, USA

Msris,

You will greatly enjoy another other film by Sampolit:

http://www.videodisease.com/viewvideo.php?id=MOX3oQkZLqQ

It may be a dream but if you suspend reality for a few minutes, you
will be able to feel that your white is white and that Nazi Germany
won over the Allies. If you watch it often enough, you will be able to
forget the pain of the Nuremberg trials that &quot;blackened&quot; the memory of
the Nazis that you and Sampolit love so dearly.

Hardly you find here someone thinking that SS or Waffen-SS were
freedom fighting organizations - they were created to enslave and kill
other nations. Other thing is people who want to fight those who wants
to enslave and kill others - and only possibility to do this was
joining german side.

It is exactly this point that the modern Holocaust deniers –
revisionists, neo-Nazis, Iranian, Saudi, Syrian and other Arab
authorities – are harping on: the numbers on the Holocaust victims
come from the Soviets and thus they exaggerate them by a factor of 10
or so. So, instead of 5 million, there were only 500,000 Jewish
victims of the Holocaust. In other words, fewer than 6%  of all
European Jews. And, since the percentage of Slavic victims – Poles,
Ukrainians, Belorusans, Russians – may have also  been around 5%-10%,
there was no Holocaust at all. Just regular sufferings of war.

&gt; period, until the closing of the camp). They do not describe a &quot;death
&gt; camp.&quot;

&gt; Marìers Vestermanis, for example, cites Wolfgang Scheffler's estimate
&gt; that ca. 28 000 foreign Jews were deported to Latvia. Of these, only 11
&gt; 000 ended up in the ghetto. 1000 died in transit and were buried at
&gt; their point of arrival -- Ðíirotava, 2000 at Jumpravmuiþa, &quot;a few
&gt; thousand&quot; men died atSalaspils, and 11 000 - 12 000 were killed at
&gt; Biíernieki (the total dead at Biíernieki might be 35 000, primarily
&gt; Jews but also ca. 10 000 prisoners of war, some political prisoners,
&gt; etc.).

&gt; The fact is that Soviet sources _must_ be questioned, and if you don't
&gt; realize that you must know zilch about the Soviets. Any Soviet
&gt; reference work tends to be completely unreliable. Even testimony is
&gt; unreliable -- please remember all of those damning &quot;confessions&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; Two divisions were to be formed on the Latvian soil during the Second
&gt; &gt;&gt; World War. They were to form the core of the Latvian Legion which was
&gt; &gt;&gt; created in order to prevent a new Soviet occupation. The 15th --
&gt; &gt;&gt; Latvian 1st Division and 19th -- Latvian 2nd Division along with the
&gt; &gt;&gt; other Latvian military units it had a combat strength up to 165,000
&gt; &gt;&gt; men at its peak.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Latvian Legion was an unique battlegroup what was built on what
&gt; &gt;&gt; stood on patriotism and high fighting moral. The legionaries continued
&gt; &gt;&gt; the fight till the bitter end -- some dedicated their entire life
&gt; &gt;&gt; fighting against the Soviet occupation.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The Western countries yielded to the pressure of the Soviet Union and
&gt; &gt;&gt; did not object to Latvia and other Baltic States remaining part of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; Soviet Union. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia found themselves the only
&gt; &gt;&gt; occupied states, whose independence was not restored after the Second
&gt; &gt;&gt; World War. Only in 1991 it became possible to eliminate this
&gt; &gt;&gt; historical injustice and the Baltic States regained their national
&gt; &gt;&gt; independence.

&gt; &gt;&gt; In the end, the Latvians were vindicated - they were cleared of any
&gt; &gt;&gt; war crimes in 1950 by the US Congress statement which recognized the
&gt; &gt;&gt; difference of the Baltic SS Legions from the German SS.

&gt; &gt;So have the Parliaments of Tonga and Zaire. Too bad parliaments of
&gt; &gt;remote foreign countries like Zaire, USA and Tonga have no legal power
&gt; &gt;to vindicate SS troops.

&gt; &gt;In fact, as we have just witnessed, US Congress' foreign affairs
&gt; &gt;statements serve little useful purposes, except for giving Turks new
&gt; &gt;excuses for invading Iraq and exterminating more Kurds, and for Bush
&gt; &gt;to say that he prefers oil over honoring the Armenian victims of the
&gt; &gt;Holocaust in Turkey.

&gt; &gt;The only judgement that counts and is still in full force is that of
&gt; &gt;the International Military Tribunal aka the Nuremberg Trials:

&gt; &gt;////////////////////////////////////////////
&gt; &gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffen-SS

&gt; &gt;The entire Waffen-SS was declared a criminal organisation by the
&gt; &gt;International Military Tribunal during the Nuremberg Trials, except
&gt; &gt;conscripts, who were exempted from that judgment as they were forced
&gt; &gt;to join.
&gt; &gt;///////////////////////////////////

&gt; &gt;No matter how much neo-Nazis and revisionists in Latvia, Estonia, USA
&gt; &gt;or Iran try, they cannot &quot;vindicate&quot; the Nazi criminals found guilty
&gt; &gt;by the Nuremberg Trials.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Not many
&gt; &gt;&gt; surviving members of the Latvian Legion are left today in Latvia. But
&gt; &gt;&gt; each year the veterans, meet to remember their suffering and
&gt; &gt;&gt; sacrifices. They see themselves as Latvian patriots who believed that
&gt; &gt;&gt; they were fighting for the restoration of a free Latvia. For this
&gt; &gt;&gt; reason, March 16th, the anniversary of a major Latvian Legion battle
&gt; &gt;&gt; in Russia, was chosen as a day of solemn remembrance.

&gt; &gt;In Russia? What were they doing in Russia? If they were fighting for
&gt; &gt;the &quot;restoration of Latvia&quot;, how come they were fighting in Russia
&gt; &gt;along with all the other fellow Nazis? Weren't they helping Hitler to
&gt; &gt;conquer Russia? Are you saying that Hitler's purpose in invading
&gt; &gt;Russia was to liberate Latvia?

&gt; &gt;&gt; This video is about the soldiers and legionaries who gave everything
&gt; &gt;&gt; to save their own country. It also describes a nation whose
&gt; &gt;&gt; independence and youth was violently taken away. It is about a country
&gt; &gt;&gt; who suffered after the war 50 more years. A country to whom the Second
&gt; &gt;&gt; World War did not end on the 8th of May 1945.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The matter of the Latvian SS is still hotly debated. In Latvia and
&gt; &gt;&gt; Estonia they are officially recognized as freedom fighters

&gt; &gt;And not only Latvia and Estonia. I hear Iran also recognizes SS as a
&gt; &gt;freedom fighting organization  against Jews and Gypsies. So do neo-
&gt; &gt;Nazis and KKK.  You should contact various revisionist Holiocaust
&gt; &gt;denial organizations on the network resources available for
&gt; &gt;glorification of SS, Himmler, Hitler and Nazis in general.

15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to: navigation, search

15th SS ShieldThe 15th Waffen-Grenadierdivision der SS (lett. Nr. 1)
was formed in the SS's drive for manpower in the wake of Operation
Barbarossa, Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941.
After a successful recruitment drive in the Reichskommissariat Ostland
(Baltic states) for the Nazi anti-partisan brigades, Heinrich Himmler
formed Baltic legions by late August 1942, including the Lettische SS-
Freiwilligen-Legion, the nucleus of the later the 15thWaffen-
Grenadierdivision der SS.

However the small scale of these Legions were inadequate for wide-
spread Russia and soon merged into divisions with the Lettische SS-
Freiwilligen-Legion renamed as the SS-Freiwilligen-Division, with the
numerical designation of 15 soon added...  The 15th SS was swept up in
the chaos of the collapse of the Eastern Front and lost much of its
spirit after the Soviet re-occupation of their homelands. It was soon
trapped and decimated in their hopeless defence of Pomerania. Dyvision
fought on the Wal Pomorski, i.a.with 1AWP .

There, in city Podgaje, 2 February 1945, SS-men of that division
performed a war crime on Polish prisoners, burning 32 soldiers of
Polish Army from 4th company 3rd regiment infantry 1st Dyvision 1AWP
in a barn tied up with a barbed wire.[1][2][3] However out of fear of
Russian revenge it fought well in the last months of the war, with a
surviving battalion in the last defence of Berlin in mid-1945. Other
remnants under Waffen-Standartenführer Vilis Janums surrendered to the
advancing Americans at Güterglück near the Elbe River. Despite its
short history the 15th SS was the most decorated foreign SS division
with 13 Knight Crosses.

I'll take this opportunity to sincerely apologize to Lorad/Jingojonny/
Hui et al. -- he's quite right, and I was very wrong, and I am sorry.
Members of the Legion did indeed serve as guards at the Nuremberg
trials.

As to what Karlamov writes -- not worth arguing, really; what is it
you get from your highlighted quote, Karlamov? Did you notice the
_except conscripts, who were exempted from that judgment as they were
forced to join_? That happens to be about 85% of the Legion, therefore
exempted.

&gt; &gt; historians who claim gas was used at Salaspils. Most don't -- and when
&gt; &gt; Auschwitz was functioning efficiently, people slated to die died, no?
&gt; &gt; That's just not the case withSalaspils--my_neighbor_ was at Salaspils.
&gt; &gt; I can assure you that he's no fan of the Nazis or Salaspils.
&gt; &gt; But what about Vyatlag, Anzaurres? Sorry, but Vyatlag according to the
&gt; &gt; terminology the Soviets used was not a &quot;death camp&quot; -- do you realize
&gt; &gt; that the survival rate at Vyatlag was lower than that at Buchenwald?
&gt; &gt; Why argue numbers if you can't get the concepts straight?

&gt; &gt; http://youtube.com/watch?v=1H8TEVO1dxQ

&gt; &gt; Two divisions were to be formed on the Latvian soil during the Second
&gt; &gt; World War. They were to form the core of the Latvian Legion which was
&gt; &gt; created in order to prevent a new Soviet occupation. The 15th --
&gt; &gt; Latvian 1st Division and 19th -- Latvian 2nd Division along with the
&gt; &gt; other Latvian military units it had a combat strength up to 165,000
&gt; &gt; men at its peak.

&gt; &gt; The Latvian Legion was an unique battlegroup what was built on what
&gt; &gt; stood on patriotism and high fighting moral. The legionaries continued
&gt; &gt; the fight till the bitter end -- some dedicated their entire life
&gt; &gt; fighting against the Soviet occupation.
&gt; &gt; The Western countries yielded to the pressure of the Soviet Union and
&gt; &gt; did not object to Latvia and other Baltic States remaining part of the
&gt; &gt; Soviet Union. Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia found themselves the only
&gt; &gt; occupied states, whose independence was not restored after the Second
&gt; &gt; World War. Only in 1991 it became possible to eliminate this
&gt; &gt; historical injustice and the Baltic States regained their national
&gt; &gt; independence.

&gt; &gt; In the end, the Latvians were vindicated - they were cleared of any
&gt; &gt; war crimes in 1950 by the US Congress statement which recognized the
&gt; &gt; difference of the Baltic SS Legions from the German SS. Not many
&gt; &gt; surviving members of the Latvian Legion are left today in Latvia. But
&gt; &gt; each year the veterans, meet to remember their suffering and
&gt; &gt; sacrifices. They see themselves as Latvian patriots who believed that
&gt; &gt; they were fighting for the restoration of a free Latvia. For this
&gt; &gt; reason, March 16th, the anniversary of a major Latvian Legion battle
&gt; &gt; in Russia, was chosen as a day of solemn remembrance.

&gt; &gt; This video is about the soldiers and legionaries who gave everything
&gt; &gt; to save their own country. It also describes a nation whose
&gt; &gt; independence and youth was violently taken away. It is about a country
&gt; &gt; who suffered after the war 50 more years. A country to whom the Second
&gt; &gt; World War did not end on the 8th of May 1945.

&gt; &gt; The matter of the Latvian SS is still hotly debated. In Latvia and
&gt; &gt; Estonia they are officially recognized as freedom fighters

&gt; Waffen SS was a criminal organization responsible for horrendous
&gt; crimes against humanity.

&gt; US Congress had no jurisdiction on the matter, therefore its
&gt; statements don't change judgments against Waffen SS.

&gt; After WWII, at the Nuremberg Trials the Waffen-SS was condemned as a
&gt; criminal organisation due to their political connections to the
&gt; National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), except conscripts
&gt; sworn in after 1943, who were exempted from the judgment on the basis
&gt; of involuntary servitude. Therefore, those who voluntarily and proudly
&gt; served in that organization remain war criminals.

Indeed, the 15th and 19th Latvian Divisions were formed in 1944 from
concripts, hence are exempted from the Nuremburg judgements.

Well, being exempt from noose prepared for military criminals is not
the same as being qualified for hero's status. No-one wants to exert
vengeance on those guys - as long as they know their place.
