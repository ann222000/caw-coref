&gt; Got back in town Wednesday night, so purrs to all who need them... no
&gt; way can I read all these posts.  I needed a day to decompress so I
&gt; didn't even look at my computer yesterday.

&gt; I picked up Persia (and Peaches the lovebird, of course!) from being
&gt; boarded yesterday.  Persia was quite miffed at me.  She stomped
&gt; around the apartment for over an hour, yowling as if someone had set
&gt; her tail on fire.  She finally settled down and spent the rest of the
&gt; day glued to me.

&gt; The trip was a good one.  The show was pretty good, although not what
&gt; it was (in terms of sales) 3 and 4 years ago.  But it was better than
&gt; last year's show so we really couldn't complain.

&gt; Again, purrs for all who need them.  I didn't get a chance to check
&gt; the ng via Google (hate that interface anyway!) while I was gone.
