Hi y'all...

My 92's brakes did something very odd and scary a few days ago.

And this is not Vette-related, strictly speaking.

It was HOT out, about 102ºF and I drove around doing basic errands. Engine
running around 223 or so, stop and go traffic.

Parked at the post office went inside, dropped off a package, came back out,
started car, into reverse, backing out of space, and I HAD NO BRAKES! Drove
SLOWLY to the other side of teh lot, and stopped the car. Got out, popped
hood, looked at brake fluid resevoir, which was fine. Got back in, started
car stepped on brakes...they were back just fine.

Could the brake fluid been too hot? And would it do something like this?

Thanks for all info!

My 93 did that some and I found out it was the beginning of the end of my
master cylinder and booster.  Check for vaccum leaks around the booster and
flush the system and replace the fluid.

sounds like it may be your booster acting up..

What did the brake pedal feel like?

The first time I used the brakes in my C4 this morning, the ABS pump
kicked in, the pedal pulsed, and there was no braking power at all.  I
backed off and tried again and it worked normally.  This was in a sharp
corner while slowing down for a red light, but not even close to the
G's necessary for tire slippage.

Weird.

I have had a similiar problem with my 91.  A couple of times when I've been
parking the vette in front of the house, live on a small hill, and i'm
creeping up to the neighbors car with my foot lightly on the brake,
something triggers the ABS, it pulsates and pedel goes to the floor, along
with car rolling forward.  its happened a couple of times and so far i've
been lucky in that I don't hit anything. now i slide the trans into neutral
(automatic) and coast.  I was figuring it was the ABS thinking I was
skidding and trying to "pump" the brakes for me.

Now, do I have a problem in my ABS system?

Rev's problem might be a screwed up or intermittent lateral 'g' sensor.
(Control unit doesn't know that the car is being cornered and thinks
it's a straight line skid.)  Might be worthwhile to see if this happens
in both left and right cornering.  Great Saturday morning workout on a
big empty parking lot.

Not enough clues on Mike's issue:  Could be a test sequence if the
engine had just been started--a pedal pressure change is normal during
test but the pedal going to the floor is wrong.  Can't tell whether the
problem is happening after the car had been driven above 8 mph (once
it's gone through self-test and arming) or if this happens right after
the car is started and first moved (ABS unarmed).  Maybe too, this is a
brake booster problem that's firming up the pedal making it feel like
it's against the bottom stop.  The human critter isn't much good at
sensing control positions but is damn good at sensing force.

First off, make sure all three warning lights are working. Bleed the
brakes. Check the wiring to each wheel sensor.  Remove, inspect and
re-connect the cable connectors to the control unit--mine are typical
old-style Bosch connectors with unplated copper contacts--over the
years, oxidation builds up on the contacts.

There are resistance checks for the lateral 'g' sensor and wheel sensors
but each must be disconnected otherwise the juice from the ohmmeter will
destroy the old-fashioned solid state stuff in the control unit.  Better
to find a good brake shop that has a Bosch ABS diagnostic unit.  This
ABS control was used on several makes of cars including Chryslers of
late '80s vintage.  You can find good service at other than the dealer.

Understand the test sequence and don't believe its that.  I see the ABS
light come on and feel a short pulsing in the pedel (a second or two).  No
this is more of i'm creeping slowly forward in a downhill direction.
haven't noticed it on level ground but suspect some gravity is working in
there.

Not sure what you mean by all three warning lights.  Can you point me to
where the control unit might be?  Have the manual but am at work so just
curious.

tks mike

The control unit is about 8 inches behind the driver's fanny.  On the
convertible, remove the left loudspeaker for access.  For a coupe, open
the left storage compartment and lift out the plastic tray.  Once you
get access, check to see if it's a Bosch ABS.

My '89 has three lights.  "BRAKE" (indicates that the basic dual circuit
brake system is unbalanced).  "ANTILOCK" (On momentarily following
ignition on.  If steady on indicates ABS failure).  "ABS ACTIVE" (it's
doing it's job.)
