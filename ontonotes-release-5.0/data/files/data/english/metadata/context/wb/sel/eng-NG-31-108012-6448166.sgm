Does he have a blender?  If not, you can purchase one for him for a
third or less than what the Bullet costs, even if you purchase it at
Bed, Bath, and Beyond, or Linens N things with their 20% off coupon.
But wait, there's more!

If he likes the small containers, get him a Proctor Silex or similar
brand.  The base of that fits on quart, pint and cup sized canning
jars so he can make smaller quantities without having to wash the big
container and then store extra stuff in yet another container.  But
wait, there's more!

Regardless of what the ads say, it's a glorified blender.

Well, I paid $50 for mine and all the accoutrements.  A bit pricey for a
blender, BUT I really love it.  As far as doing all the things on the
infomercial with food I haven't had much luck.  It tends to puree
everything.  If you try and pulse it as it says you'll end up with something
half pureed and half unchopped.

For what my kids and I use it for we LOVE it.  We like fruit smoothies and
milkshakes.  I have kids in sports and me watching what a eat.  Could I do
it in a regular blender... not as well.  We love the separate cups that one
can mix up whatever each individual wants.  I screw on the blade... puree...
rinse blade and move on to next cup.  I have 3 healthy smoothies with
handles ready to drink in a few minutes.  Other than that application I'd
say go with a regular blender.

Favorite recipe:  One serving of frozen fruit, one serving of sherbet, 1 cup
of V8 Fusion (a fruit and veggie juice).  Whirl and drink.

PS.
I hate washing things by hand and the cups all fit nicely in the dishwasher
whereas my blender was always too big.

What you say is true, but if he wants the Magic Bullet, you just know that a
blender isn't going to be the same.  I say, if you can afford it and want to
please him, get him the bullet.

Having never seen a Magic Bullet, I can only say that what's important here
is what your father would like, not whether he might get enough benefit from
it! If it will make him happy, go for it!
