_Poetaster_, Jonson

P R O L O G U E.

Stay Monster, ere thou sink, thus on thy Head ( note - Envy)
Set we our bolder Foot; with which we tread
Thy Malice into Earth: So spight should dye,
Despis'd and scorn'd by noble Industry.
If any muse why I salute the Stage,
An armed Prologue; know, 'tis a DANGEROUS AGE:
Wherein, who writes, had need present his Scenes
Forty-fold proof against the conjuring means
Of base Detractors, and illiterate Apes,
That fill up Rooms in fair and formal shapes.
'Gainst these, have we put on this forc't defence:
Whereof the Allegory and hid sense
Is, that a well erected Confidence
Can fright their Pride, and laugh their Folly hence.
Here now, put case our Author should, once more,
Swear that his Play were good; he doth implore,
You would not argue him of Arrogance:
How e're that common Spawn of Ignorance,
Our fry of Writers may beslime his Fame,
And give his Action that adulterate Name.
Such full-blown vanity he more doth loath,
Than base dejection: There's a mean 'twixt both.
Which with a constant firmness he pursues,
As one that knows the strength of his own Muse.
And this he hopes all free Souls will allow;
Others, that take it with a rugged brow,
Their Moods he rather pitties than envies:
His Mind it is above their Iujuries.

Horatian satire in Jonson's &quot;On the Famous Voyage&quot; - English poet Ben
Johnson - Critical Essay
Criticism,  Wntr, 2002  by Bruce Boehrer

(T)he external similarities between Horace 1.5 and &quot;On the Famous
Voyage&quot; deserve some review. To begin with general subject-matter: not
only through the narrative specifics of &quot;A Journey to Brundisium&quot; but
also through its self-conscious relation to Lucilius, Horace's poem
positions itself as a travelogue. As the poet/protagonist makes his
way down the Italian peninsula, he offers a not-so-loving documentary
of the various discomforts (e.g. indigestion and sore eyes,
inconveniences (sour wine, unreliable boats, and bad roads), and
follies (pretentious provincial officials and oafish locals) that
intersperse the journey. For its part, &quot;On the Famous Voyage&quot; might
seem relatively unconcerned with the subject of travel, its title
notwithstanding: the poem's heroes, &quot;SHELTON, and ... HEYDEN&quot; ,  never
go beyond the confines of London, and to characterize their expedition
as a &quot;famous voyage&quot; is clearly to indulge in mock-heroic hyperbole.
Yet Jonson's poem, like Horace's, takes pains to invoke models of
travel drawn from the contemporary social context.

In the case of Jonson's poem, indeed, these models are of more than
passing interest; the fame of the &quot;famous Voyage,&quot; as it happens, is
gauged against travel practices that attract the poet's attention
throughout his career. Thus Shelton and Heyden embark upon their
expedition from Bridewell dock

in worthy scorne
Of those, that put out moneys, on returne
From Venice, Paris, or some in-land passage
Of six times to and fro, without embassage,
Or him that backward went to Berwicke, or which
Did dance the famous Morrisse, vnto Norwich.

(31-36)

The performer of the famous morris in question, of course, was Will
Kemp, who undertook the dance as a public-relations stunt in the
spring of 1600, after stepping down from his position as principal
clown for the Lord Chamberlain's Men. The precise identity of &quot;him
that backward went to Berwicke&quot; is no longer clear, although
references to the exploit survive, as testimony to the public notice
it elicited, not only in Jonson's poem but also in Rowley's A Search
for Money. As to the practice of laying out money &quot;on returne&quot; from
foreign excursions, it was widespread in Jonson's England, apparently
combining an increased cultural interest in travel with the endemic
Elizabethan fondness for gambling and monetary speculation. In the
typical such arrangement, a prospective traveler would place money
with friends or associates who pledged to return it at a predetermined
rate of interest, provided that the traveller in question complete his
projected journey within specific time constraints and in accordance
with other possible conditions.

By 1612, this last practice had left a significant mark upon Jonson's
work, for in Every Man Out of His Humour (1599; printed 1600) the poet
had already produced a dramatic character to satirize the very same
activity. Puntarvolo, in Every Man Out, embodies a variety of foibles
that include a credulous fondness for the themes and commonplaces of
chivalric romance and courtly love; an unreasonable emotional
attachment to his dog and cat; and a penchant for &quot;deal[ing] upon
returnes, and strange performances&quot; (&quot;Character of the Persons&quot; 21).
In pursuit of this last humor, Puntarvolo spends the better part of
the play drumming up support for an elaborate excursion to &quot;the Turkes
court in Constantinople&quot; --a trip on which he is to be accompanied by
his dog and his wife (when the wife eventually drops out, he proposes
to replace her with his cat). Ironically enough, given his incessant
talk about this fabulous journey, *Puntarvolo undertakes only one
actual trip in Every Man Out: from Bankside to Whitehall, in the same
general northerly direction and within the same general urban enclave
that delimit Shelton and Heyden's exploits in &quot;On the Famous Voyage.&quot;*

VOLPONE, intro.

Never (most Equal Sisters) had any Man a Wit so presently Excellent,
as that it could raise it self; but there must come both Matter,
Occasion, Commenders, and Favourers to it. If this be true, and that
the Fortune of all Writers doth daily prove it, it behoves the Careful
to provide well toward these Accidents; and, having acquir'd them, to
preserve that part of Reputation most tenderly, wherein the Benefit of
a Friend is also defended. Hence is it, that I now render my self
grateful, and am studious to justifie the Bounty of your Act; to
which, though your meer Authority were satisfying, yet it being an Age
wherein Poetry and the Professors of it hear so ill on all Sides,
there will a Reason be look't for in the Subject. It is certain, nor
can it with any Forehead be oppos'd, that the too much Licence of
Poetasters in this Time, hath much deform'd their Mistris; that, every
day, their manifold and manifest Ignorance doth stick unnatural
Reproaches upon her: But for their Petulancy, it were an Act of the
greatest Injustice, either to let the Learned suffer, or so Divine a
Skill (which indeed should not be attempted with unclean Hands) to
fall under the least Contempt. For, if Men will impartially, and not
asquint, look toward the Offices and Function of a Poet, they will
easily conclude to themselves the Impossibility of any Man's being the
good Poet, without first being a good Man. He that is said to be able
to inform young Men to all good Disciplines, inflame grown Men to all
great Vertues, keep old Men in their best and supream State, or as
they decline to Childhood, recover them to their first Strength; that
comes forth the Interpreter and Arbiter of Nature, a Teacher of Things
Divine no less than Humane, a Master in Manners; and can alone (or
with a few) effect the Business of Mankind: This, I take him, is no
Subject for Pride and Ignorance to exercise their failing Rhetorick
upon. But it will here be hastily answer'd, That the Writers of these
Days are other Things; that NOT ONLY THEIR MANNERS, BUT THEIR NATURES
ARE INVERTED, and nothing remaining with them of the Dignity of Poet,
but the abused Name, which every Scribe usurps; that now, especially
in Drammatick, or (as they term it) Stage-Poetry, nothing but
Ribaldry, Prophanation, Blasphemy, all Licence of Offence to God and
Man is practis'd. I dare not deny a great part of this, (and I am
sorry I dare not) because in some Mens abortive Features (and would
they had never boasted the Light) it is over-true: But that all are
imbark'd in this bold Adventure for Hell, is a most uncharitable
Thought, and, utter'd, a more malicious Slander. For my particular, I
can (and from a most clear Conscience) affirm, That I have ever
trembled to think toward the least Profaneness; have loathed the use
of such foul and unwash'd Bawd'ry, as is now made the Food of the
Scene: And, howsoever I cannot escape from some the Imputation of
Sharpness, but that they will say, I have taken a pride, or lust, to
be bitter, and not my youngest Instant but hath come into the World
with all his Teeth; I would ask of these supercilious Politicks, What
Nation, Society, or general Order or State I have provoked? What
Publick Person? Whether I have not (in all these) preserv'd their
Dignity, as mine own Person, safe? My Works are read, allow'd, (I
speak of those are intirely mine) look into them: What broad Repoofs
have I us'd? Where have I been particular? Where Personal? Except to a
Mimick, Cheater, Bawd, or Buffon, Creatures (for their Insolencies)
worthy to be tax'd? Yet to which of these so pointingly, as he might
not either ingenuously have confest, or wisely dissembled his Disease?
But it is not Rumour can make Men guilty, much less entitle me to
other Mens Crimes. I know, that nothing can be so innocently writ or
carried, but may be made obnoxious to Construction; marry, whilst I
bear mine Innocence about me, I fear it not. Application is now grown
a Trade with many; and there are that profess to have a Key for the
decyphering of every thing: But let Wise and Noble Persons take heed
how they be too credulous, or give leave to these invading
Interpreters to be over-familiar with their Fames, who cunningly, and
often, utter their own virulent Malice, under other Mens simplest
Meanings. As for those that will (by Faults which Charity hath rak'd
up, or common Honesty conceal'd) make themselves a Name with the
Multitude, or (to draw their rude and beastly Claps) care not whose
living Faces they intrench with their petulant Styles, may they do it
without a Rival, for me: I chuse rather to live grav'd in Obscurity,
than share with them in so PREPOSTEROUS a FAME.

&quot;On the Famous Voyage&quot;: Ben Jonson and Civic Space
Andrew McRae

# Readers of Ben Jonson have long appreciated the significance of his
representations of social space. &quot;To Penshurst&quot; is commonly placed at
the forefront of the Jonson canon, seen to typify his preoccupation
with the &quot;centred self&quot; of the pre-modern subject, and the location of
that subject within a physical and psychological &quot;home.&quot; His satiric
verse and city comedies have likewise attracted attention, for their
disturbing appreciation of the ways in which social and spatial
structures in London corrode human values. Jonson's most sustained non-
dramatic engagement with his city, however, has received relatively
little notice. &quot;On the Famous Voyage,&quot; which narrates a journey up the
polluted Fleet Ditch from Bridewell to Holborn, is by far the longest
poem in Jonson's Epigrammes, and almost twice the length of the famous
country-house poem, yet only one critic has considered it worthy of a
research article. Recent studies of literary constructions of the city
have also dodged the text: Lawrence Manley's Literature and Culture in
Early Modern London accords it only passing references; Steven
Mullaney, whose exploration of marginal spaces parallels in important
ways Jonson's poetic navigation, does not mention the piece.

#   This history of neglect can largely be attributed to queasiness in
the face of the poem's subject matter. Swinburne famously dismissed
the &quot;Famous Voyage&quot; as out of tune with English sensibilities.
&quot;Coprology,&quot; he suggested, &quot;should be left to the Frenchmen . . . It
is nothing less than lamentable that so great an English writer as Ben
Jonson should ever have taken the plunge of a Parisian diver into the
cesspool.&quot; More recently, Richard Helgerson has placed the text &quot;among
the filthiest, the most deliberately and insistently disgusting poems
in the language.&quot; Beyond this prevalent discomfort, however, critical
opinion has diverged, and the disagreements raise important questions
about the significance of the poem. Most notably, &quot;On the Famous
Voyage&quot; has been interpreted as &quot;a typical Renaissance parody,&quot; a
studied &quot;SATIRE ON THE AGE,&quot; and as burlesque underpinned by
Rabelaisian humour.[8] J. G. Nichols' assessment accommodates several
of the predominant strategies in the multivalent poem, but in the
process underscores the problems of categorisation; he adopts a
&quot;distinction between &quot;mock-heroic, where the treatment is grandiose;
and burlesque, where the treatment is low&quot;, and describes the &quot;Famous
Voyage&quot; as &quot;a mixture of mock-heroic and burlesque with incidental
contemporary satire.

(SNIP)

# &quot;On the Famous Voyage&quot; similarly claims a community of readers,
which Jonson binds together with a mesh of puns and topical allusions.
There is no reason to believe that the voyagers were not themselves
members of this community. Peter Medine identifies &quot;Shelton&quot; not as
the Sir Ralph Shelton lauded in Epigrammes 119, but rather Thomas
Shelton, translator of Don Quixote; and &quot;Heyden,&quot; he determines, is
Sir Christopher Heydon, a prominent defender of astrology. These two
men, Medine argues, Jonson would have despised for their respective
literary and intellectual endeavours. But while this argument is
attractive, he can find no evidence for the identifications, beyond
the suitability of the pair for his reading of the poem as &quot;a serious
indictment of the times.&quot; He appears to assume that the incident has
no basis in fact, and that Jonson rather &quot;selected&quot; figures &quot;who would
have served a particular satiric purpose.&quot; Without further evidence
this is a dangerous assumption, which may distort a reading of the
poem. Instead, given the number of other topical referents in the
poem, it seems reasonable to suggest that the voyagers were personally
known to the poet (and Sir Ralph Shelton might well have been one of
them), although their exact identification is not essential to an
understanding of the poem. The narrative might be based on a failed
search for prostitutes, which might also have been linked to a tavern
wager. Consequently, the poem might be approached similarly to
Jonson's representation of Coryate: as an act of refashioning and
comic embellishment. Hercules is a suitable tutelary deity, as he was
associated not only with physical heroism but also with gargantuan
sexual labours. Like Aeneas, Hercules also travelled to &quot;hell&quot;: a word
which affords Jonson a pun, suggesting both a brothel-district and the
vagina.

#   The route of the journey, whether concocted or merely retold by
Jonson, is exploited for its conjunction of institutions of civic
discipline with emanations of disorder. The men begin their trip along
the outside of the city wall at Bridewell, a former royal palace which
was handed to the City of London by Edward VI and used thereafter,
according to Stow's early eighteenth-century successor, as &quot;a Place
where all Strumpets, Night-walkers, Pick-pockets, vagrant and idle
Persons, that are taken up for their ill Lives . . . are forced to
beat Hemp in publick View, with due Correction of whipping.&quot; The Fleet
prison, from which &quot;out-cryes of the damned&quot; subsequently assail the
voyagers (l. 172), housed debtors as well as prisoners convicted by
the Star Chamber. Holborn, the men's destination, was associated with
both punishment and transgression. The journeys of the condemned to
Tyburn executions passed through Holborn, and its thoroughfare was
often used for the public carting and flogging of criminals. Its
concurrent reputation for crime and prostitution, upon which Jonson
draws more explicitly, is illustrated by contemporary literary
references; for instance, in A Fair Quarrel, by Middleton and Rowley,
those seeking instruction in the art of roaring are advised to &quot;repair
into Holborn at the sign of the Cheat-Loaf.&quot;

#   The journey is also a &quot;liquid deed&quot; (l. 193), by water rather than
by land. The poem's emphasis on the groggy flow of fluids through the
body of the city explores the significance of the liquid in London.
For Stow, the waters of the city were a source of civic pride, and
claimed a place at the front of his Survey. He celebrates particularly
the controlled flow of water, issuing from conduits which themselves
stand as civic monuments. In West Cheap the monument was gendered and
classicized; there, Stow records, &quot;was set up a curious wrought
tabernacle of gray Marble, and in the same an Alabaster Image of
Diana, and water convayed from the Thames, prilling from her naked
breast.&quot; Nature, figured in the flowing water and nurturing female
form, is thereby fused with the culture of a city capable of
engineering and classical appropriation. The conduits, the principal
sources of water for Londoners, were also important stations in the
lord mayors' processions. &quot;At these stations,&quot; Lawrence Manley
comments, &quot;where normally the city's life welled up to be gathered by
apprentices of a morning, and where water turned to wine during
entries -- nature, culture, and grace converged in pageant form.&quot;

(SNIP)

# For all the civic pride attached to the supply of water, then, the
cultural status of London's liquid remained problematic. Channels of
water tend to collapse troublingly into flows of filth; the careful
civic control over nature is undermined by the unsteady passage of
matter through body and city alike. This ambivalence towards the fluid
was evident in the lord mayors' processions, which moved to the
celebratory pageants at central conduits only after more unruly scenes
by the Thames. Manley notes that the water pageant which marked the
lord mayor's landing by barge was typically &quot;the roughest and most
boisterous&quot; of the day, adorned with &quot;amphibian mascots, pagan gods,
giants, and heroes,&quot; and exposing the porous boundaries between nature
and culture. While the procession on land was carefully linked to
civic monuments and tradition, the flow of water threatened to
dissolve such aggrandizing strategies. Jonson accordingly plays on the
attempts to manipulate images of order in the lord mayor's arrival
when he suggests of the putrid barge which passes the famous voyagers,
that &quot;one day in the yeere, for sweet 'tis voyc't, / And that is when
it is the Lord Maiors foist&quot; (ll. 119-20). The word &quot;foist&quot; admits
useful puns, meaning a barge, but also a fart or a cheating rogue.

#   The image of civic ceremony which collapses in a scatological pun
is paradigmatic of the poem's strategy of setting bodily ferment
against discourses of spatial and social stability. Crucially, the
sewer which should be a river, encumbered with the stench of excrement
and disorder when civic pride requires purity and consistency, is
mapped as a path through a seething body. As the heroes move upstream
through the &quot;dire passage&quot; (l. 59), the poem moves haltingly through
images of excretion to images of the preparation and consumption of
food. The &quot;passage&quot; thus crudely mirrors the function of the
alimentary canal, understood in Renaissance medical theory to be a
single channel winding through the body, which received and digested
food, and subsequently ejected excrement. Theorists exercised their
minds, as Gail Kern Paster notes, to separate the processes of the
canal, but failed to dispel completely the &quot;specter of monstrous
appetite, of ingestion and excretion in endless, horrible
simultaneity.&quot; As I will consider further in section two, Jonson's
wilful confusion of these processes exploits the attendant anxieties,
suggesting at once a social and spatial corruption in the body of the
city.

CASTIGATORE:

Jonson's Stoic Politics:
Lipsius, the Greeks, and the &quot;Speach According to Horace&quot;
Robert C. Evans

·  To combat the kinds of excesses he attacks, Lipsius commends the
role of censor -- a role quite similar to that of the Jonsonian
satirist. The censor ideally functions by attempting to shame
transgressors, much as Jonson does in the &quot;Speach.&quot; If shame
should fail, then corporal punishment may be necessary, but in
any case the prince must be vigilant to &quot;Cause Faith to return backe,
correct voluptuousnesse, and bind together, by seuere lawes, those
things which are decaied&quot; . The ruler should &quot;rather . . .
labour for the safetie of all men, then for their pleasure&quot;.
When supervising his people, he should not &quot;winke at that which is
euill, dissemble their faults, and with their present pleasure, giue
consent to their future mischiefe&quot;. Instead, he must live an
exemplary life and thus shame others into doing the same. &quot;Shame
will worke the best alteration in some, in others necessitie, and euen
a loathing of it in others&quot; . Iamblichus is quoted as extolling
the effectiveness of princely reward and punishment: &quot;What so is in
honour is augmented and increaseth, &amp; that which is in contempt,
declineth, and diminisheth: and that is a most manifest sign of a
kingdome well established&quot;. One could hardly ask for a better
explanation of the rationale and objectives of Jonson's &quot;Speach,&quot; a
poem in which Jonson adopts the role of censor, becoming a kind of
unofficial magistrate of *manners*.
·  Whether Jonson read Lipsius' discussion of the censor before,
during, or after writing his poem, it is easy to see why that reading
caught his interest and how it is relevant both to this specific poem
and to his Caroline politics in general. Fundamentally, both the
theorist and the poet share an essentially moralistic approach to
political problems: most political and social ills can be traced to
the kind of &quot;private&quot; immorality the &quot;Speach&quot; attacks. In fact, of
course, for both Jonson and Lipsius no immorality is ever truly
private; all selfish or unethical conduct inevitably has harmful
social consequences. If Jonson seems obsessed by such apparently
trivial matters as aristocratic addictions to &quot;gate, / Carriage, and
dressing&quot; (ll. 87-88) and if he fulminates against those whose chief
desire is to &quot;make legs&quot; and &quot;smell most sweet&quot; (l. 90), it is not
because he is a busybody who cannot leave other people alone. It is
because he, like Lipsius, cannot finally separate &quot;private&quot; behavior
from its social and political ramifications. No wonder he read Lipsius
with such eagerness; no wonder he marked him with such zest.
