According to the TLAPD website, a commonly used pickup line in &quot;pirate
bars&quot; is &quot;prepare to be boarded!&quot; It's been a long, long time since I
was single, but it's hard to imagine such an approach resulting in a

Chuck,
When I was in college, I found if you prefixed any attempt to board with
booze and/or drugs, &quot;prepare to be boarded&quot; worked as well as any
line.  Since this was the wild and wooly 70's, I had to be careful that
the hussies didn't ply me with booze and/or drugs before attempting to
board me.

you are a really serious guy and disdainful of anyone whose idea of fun

I think this went over my head.  When I was in the market for some

I have to be honest, I never used the line &quot;prepare to be boarded&quot;.

*All* pirates didn't speak in any particular manner, Harry.

Most of the cartoon &quot;pirate speak&quot; emulates somebody giving orders,
(&quot;Swab the deck, ye bloody bastards!&quot;) and usually in a derogatory or
threatening tone. It's probable that a lot of people have little or no
appreciation for the overall lack of formal command aboard most
traditional pirate ships. The pirates of the 17th and 18th centuries
were organized very democratically. (Some rec.boaters will hurry to
agree that there are a lot of Democratic pirates still afoot, but
that's a different issue.....).

Aboard most pirate vessels, the Captain had little or no authority
except when planning strategy and conducting boardings. The primary
authority for most issues was the Quartermaster. Both Captain and
Quartermaster were elected positions, and if either officer got too
high-hatted or abusive the crew could easily unelect (or otherwise
dispose of) them and frequently did. Nearly everybody aboard got an
equal share.

Among English speakers, the practice of piracy was exacerbated by
certain policies of the British Navy. As most people know, &quot;landsmen&quot;
were pressed into involuntary service aboard British warships, with an
indiscriminate dragnet sweeping through most coastal towns and
villages whenever a ship needed to replace crew. When the current bout
of perpetual war with France concluded and less manpower was needed,
the draftees would be mustered out wherever in the world their warship
happened to be......there was no effort made to return the poor sods
back to their place of origin where families could be reunited, trades
or farming could be resumed, etc. With the pittance paid to many of
these pressed men, they had no means to book an expensive passage back
home- and in fact had no real reason to anticpate that they would
still have a home, a family, a farm, a shop, or whatever. Piracy
seemed like a decent alternative- a chance to put the newly acquired
skills of seizing ships on the high seas to good use.

Discipline on the British warships was often indeed as harsh as still
portrayed. The British were very class conscious, and the officers
were from privilieged backgrounds while the common seamen were not.
Nobody gave much though to administering severe punishment for minor
offenses. When mustered out British tars took to piracy, they were
generally unwilling to endure the same sort of treatment from officers
that they experienced in the Navy. Discipline was very lax aboard most
pirate vessels, so the barking of orders coupled with insults would be
an uncommon event.

How did 17th and 18th century pirates talk? Pretty much like common
folks in any coastal town or village of the era would talk. The
nautical terms in their vocabulary would be little or no different
than the nautical terms in the vocabulary of any seaman- merchant,
Navy, pirate, or &quot;privateer&quot;.

&gt; *All* pirates didn't speak in any particular manner, Harry.

&gt; Most of the cartoon &quot;pirate speak&quot; emulates somebody giving orders,
&gt; (&quot;Swab the deck, ye bloody bastards!&quot;) and usually in a derogatory or
&gt; threatening tone. It's probable that a lot of people have little or no
&gt; appreciation for the overall lack of formal command aboard most
&gt; traditional pirate ships. The pirates of the 17th and 18th centuries
&gt; were organized very democratically. (Some rec.boaters will hurry to
&gt; agree that there are a lot of Democratic pirates still afoot, but
&gt; that's a different issue.....).

&gt; Aboard most pirate vessels, the Captain had little or no authority
&gt; except when planning strategy and conducting boardings. The primary
&gt; authority for most issues was the Quartermaster. Both Captain and
&gt; Quartermaster were elected positions, and if either officer got too
&gt; high-hatted or abusive the crew could easily unelect (or otherwise
&gt; dispose of) them and frequently did. Nearly everybody aboard got an
&gt; equal share.

&gt; Among English speakers, the practice of piracy was exacerbated by
&gt; certain policies of the British Navy. As most people know, &quot;landsmen&quot;
&gt; were pressed into involuntary service aboard British warships, with an
&gt; indiscriminate dragnet sweeping through most coastal towns and
&gt; villages whenever a ship needed to replace crew. When the current bout
&gt; of perpetual war with France concluded and less manpower was needed,
&gt; the draftees would be mustered out wherever in the world their warship
&gt; happened to be......there was no effort made to return the poor sods
&gt; back to their place of origin where families could be reunited, trades
&gt; or farming could be resumed, etc. With the pittance paid to many of
&gt; these pressed men, they had no means to book an expensive passage back
&gt; home- and in fact had no real reason to anticpate that they would
&gt; still have a home, a family, a farm, a shop, or whatever. Piracy
&gt; seemed like a decent alternative- a chance to put the newly acquired
&gt; skills of seizing ships on the high seas to good use.

&gt; Discipline on the British warships was often indeed as harsh as still
&gt; portrayed. The British were very class conscious, and the officers
&gt; were from privilieged backgrounds while the common seamen were not.
&gt; Nobody gave much though to administering severe punishment for minor
&gt; offenses. When mustered out British tars took to piracy, they were
&gt; generally unwilling to endure the same sort of treatment from officers
&gt; that they experienced in the Navy. Discipline was very lax aboard most
&gt; pirate vessels, so the barking of orders coupled with insults would be

Naw. But your constant barrage of personal remarks is pretty tedious.

You're the one who brought up &quot;talk like a pirate&quot; and took exception
to
my observation that cartoon piratespeak has nothing to do with how
pirates would have actually talked. You asked why I would disagree
with the cartoon version of piracy, and I shared a brief insight.

Will you next declare that all or most pirates had missing eyes,
wooden legs, and kept parrots as pets?  :-)

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; were organized very democratically. (Some rec.boaters will hurry to

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Among English speakers, the practice of piracy was exacerbated by
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; certain policies of the British Navy. As most people know, &quot;landsmen&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; were pressed into involuntary service aboard British warships, with an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; indiscriminate dragnet sweeping through most coastal towns and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; villages whenever a ship needed to replace crew. When the current bout
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of perpetual war with France concluded and less manpower was needed,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the draftees would be mustered out wherever in the world their warship
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; happened to be......there was no effort made to return the poor sods
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; back to their place of origin where families could be reunited, trades
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; or farming could be resumed, etc. With the pittance paid to many of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; these pressed men, they had no means to book an expensive passage back
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; home- and in fact had no real reason to anticpate that they would
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; still have a home, a family, a farm, a shop, or whatever. Piracy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; seemed like a decent alternative- a chance to put the newly acquired
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; skills of seizing ships on the high seas to good use.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Discipline on the British warships was often indeed as harsh as still
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; portrayed. The British were very class conscious, and the officers
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; were from privilieged backgrounds while the common seamen were not.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Nobody gave much though to administering severe punishment for minor
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; offenses. When mustered out British tars took to piracy, they were
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; generally unwilling to endure the same sort of treatment from officers
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that they experienced in the Navy. Discipline was very lax aboard most

Why does it matter so much to you, Chuck? Lots of people have fun with
pirates and pirate lore, whether it be real...or not.

You need a larger shirt...the one you are wearing now is just too stuffed.

Sorry, Chuck, I don't take &quot;boating&quot; as seriously as you do. Boating is
a fun thing for me...I don't make my living at it.

And yes, most pirates had missing eyes, wooden legs and parrots.

Not at all. What part of my original comment, wishing people who think
this sort of thing is fun a &quot;happy day&quot;, is grinch-like?

TLAPD as harmless as the common celebration of Halloween, that one day
each year when people describe witches as ugly old women riding
broomsticks and ghosts as floating bedsheets. Nothing to do with
reality, but a fun diversion for some folks anyway. Grade school kids,
especially- but kids of all ages can join in an enjoy if so inclined.

The commonly accepted &quot;model&quot; for pirates is the character created by
Robert Louis Stevenson in his novel Treasure Island. The pirate, of
course, was Long John Silver, who has lost one of his legs, and who has
a parrot, named Captain Flint, on his shoulder. And Stevenson, of
course, was a fine writer, something Chuck will never be.

A number of really good actors have played Silver in film, including
Orson Welles, Charlton Heston, Jack Palance, and, of course, the
incomparable Wallace Beery.

No one really gives a shit what Chuck thinks about pirates or pirate lore.

There's no shortage of well-written, interesting information available
on pirates of today and yesterday.

My favorite &quot;Silver&quot; was Beery in the 1934 version directed by the great
Victor Fleming. The cast also included Jackie Cooper, Lionel Barrymore,
Nigel Bruce, and Paul Kruger. Kruger was the grandnephew of the guy for
whom the Krugerrand was named. Really.

Fleming &quot;also&quot; directed Gone with the Wind, the Good Earth, Captains
Courageous, Tortilla Flat and about a zillion others.

Harry,
Actually there are lots of people who give a shit what Chuck thinks
about this and other topics related to boating.  He is actually paid to
give his opinion on boating topics.

I would guess there are some who care what you think about certain
topics.  I do know there are lots of people who don't.  That is the
wonder of Usenet, you get to post your ideas wither someone gives a shot
or not.

You do seem to think that rec.boats is your group, and the only ideas
that are worthy of a post are those that you are agree with.  You are
incorrect.

&gt; threatening tone. It's probable that a lot of people have little or no
&gt; appreciation for the overall lack of formal command aboard most
&gt; traditional pirate ships. The pirates of the 17th and 18th centuries
&gt; were organized very democratically. (Some rec.boaters will hurry to
&gt; agree that there are a lot of Democratic pirates still afoot, but
&gt; that's a different issue.....).

&gt; Aboard most pirate vessels, the Captain had little or no authority
&gt; except when planning strategy and conducting boardings. The primary
&gt; authority for most issues was the Quartermaster. Both Captain and
&gt; Quartermaster were elected positions, and if either officer got too
&gt; high-hatted or abusive the crew could easily unelect (or otherwise
&gt; dispose of) them and frequently did. Nearly everybody aboard got an
&gt; equal share.

&gt; Among English speakers, the practice of piracy was exacerbated by
&gt; certain policies of the British Navy. As most people know, &quot;landsmen&quot;
&gt; were pressed into involuntary service aboard British warships, with an
&gt; indiscriminate dragnet sweeping through most coastal towns and
&gt; villages whenever a ship needed to replace crew. When the current bout
&gt; of perpetual war with France concluded and less manpower was needed,
&gt; the draftees would be mustered out wherever in the world their warship
&gt; happened to be......there was no effort made to return the poor sods
&gt; back to their place of origin where families could be reunited, trades
&gt; or farming could be resumed, etc. With the pittance paid to many of
&gt; these pressed men, they had no means to book an expensive passage back
&gt; home- and in fact had no real reason to anticpate that they would
&gt; still have a home, a family, a farm, a shop, or whatever. Piracy
&gt; seemed like a decent alternative- a chance to put the newly acquired
&gt; skills of seizing ships on the high seas to good use.

&gt; Discipline on the British warships was often indeed as harsh as still
&gt; portrayed. The British were very class conscious, and the officers
&gt; were from privilieged backgrounds while the common seamen were not.
&gt; Nobody gave much though to administering severe punishment for minor
&gt; offenses. When mustered out British tars took to piracy, they were
&gt; generally unwilling to endure the same sort of treatment from officers
&gt; that they experienced in the Navy. Discipline was very lax aboard most
&gt; pirate vessels, so the barking of orders coupled with insults would be
&gt; an uncommon event.

&gt; How did 17th and 18th century pirates talk? Pretty much like common
&gt; folks in any coastal town or village of the era would talk. The
&gt; nautical terms in their vocabulary would be little or no different
&gt; than the nautical terms in the vocabulary of any seaman- merchant,
&gt; Navy, pirate, or &quot;privateer&quot;.

They would of talked loudly.  Most of the reason for the impressments of
seaman was that after a cruise and a battle or two most were to deaf to hear
orders.  So replacements were needed.

&gt; Will you next declare that all or most pirates had missing eyes,
&gt; wooden legs, and kept parrots as pets?  :-)

Hey Chuck I'll put in my two cents here.  many pirates did have
missing limbs because battle was a way of life along with poor medical
facilities.  Navy personnel had much of the same problem but not as
bad as the pirates.  Pirate articles or contracts would often include
a bonus for anyone that lost a limb in service to the ship and/or
crew.  This would not have been there had it rarely happened.  This,
coincidentally was not commonly given to regular navy sailors. Not all
of them of course.

As for parrots, from what I've read exotic pets were not uncommon for
any sailing vessel but apparently it was more commonly monkeys and
cats.

You are right also that pirates would talk in whatever manner most
sailors would have but with less refinement due to lack of education
and formality.

But this is supposed to be fun.  So HAPPY TALK LIKE A PIRATE DAY.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Arrrrgh!

&gt;&gt; According to the TLAPD website, a commonly used pickup line in &quot;pirate
&gt;&gt; bars&quot; is &quot;prepare to be boarded!&quot; It's been a long, long time since I
&gt;&gt; was single, but it's hard to imagine such an approach resulting in a
&gt;&gt; lot of &quot;booty&quot;.

&gt;&gt; The whole concept is silly as heck, and historically inaccurate to
&gt;&gt; boot.
&gt;&gt; Oh well, some folks will have a lot of fun with it so......happy &quot;Talk
&gt;&gt; like Hollywood script writers think pirates talked day&quot;  :-)

&gt;Find that bottle of &quot;Mellow Yellow,&quot; Chuck, and take all of them. I know
&gt;you are a really serious guy and disdainful of anyone whose idea of fun
&gt;is different from yours. You're probably the only guy in the world
&gt;trying to analyze TLAPD for hidden meaning and accuracy.

Harry, you are such a sweet guy! I'm sure many of your followers will
compliment you on such a fine post.

In a couple of days I'll be heading south again, burning all of &quot;your&quot;

Is that anti-social enough?

Of course if all of our fine upstanding politicians of both stripes
had taken their collective heads out of the sand (and their butts),
we'd be on alternative fuels by now.
