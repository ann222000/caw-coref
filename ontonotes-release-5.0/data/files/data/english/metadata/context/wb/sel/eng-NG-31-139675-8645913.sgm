A little while ago, I got my monk in some trouble where she was a
little more surrounded than she ought to have been down in the Gnomish
Mines. I had a couple scrolls of teleport so I thought I'd try
teleporting away. I read one and it merely said, &quot;You shudder a
moment.&quot;

I'd never seen that before except standing upon teleportation (or
other kinds of magical) *traps*. I wondered if it was maybe some sort
of quasi-magic resistance the monk had, though that usually doesn't
stop magic you activate on your own. AFAIK, the scrolls were NOT
cursed (uncursed, IIRC; I had altar ID'd them).

My stupidity (beyond the initial stupidity of letting myself get
surrounded in the first place) was deciding to try it again  --
thinking maybe it was a random event, perhaps a function of luck. But
the same thing happened and.... the monsters killed me.

What causes that? Is it a monk thing, a luck thing, or what? Just need
to know what to keep track of in case I need a tele scroll in a jam
again sometime. Of course, working on not getting surrounded is my
own, separate issue. :)

Thanks,

Death Quaker

My guess, although I couldn't find sufficient information in the
spoilers, is that you were still a 'beginner', that is you had less
than 2000 points (or 1000 for a wizard).

Nitpick: &quot;for a moment&quot;.

[then the same thing happened with the other scroll]

You were just plain unlucky. Both scrolls were cursed, so they level
teleported you (to a random level instead of within the level you were
on) and in both cases you happened to end up on the level you were
already on. If you get teleported to a different level the scroll has to
find a place for you to land, but you already had a place on your
destination level (the place where you were standing), so...

Given that I am pretty sure that there is no no-teleport level
in the mines (although I might be wrong), another (now: random)
reason to fail to (now: level-) teleport may be to be confused
when reading the scroll.
