This is a very tasty recipe - it always turns out well for me, and freezes
pretty decently, too!

James Beard's Cuban Bread

Makes 2 loaves

1 1/2 packages active dry yeast
1 Tbsp Granulated sugar
2 cup Warm water (100-115 deg.)
1 Tbsp Salt
5 cup All-purpose or hard wheat-flour plus 1 cup if necessary
3 Tbsp Yellow cornmeal
1 Tbsp Egg white, mixed with 1 Tbsp cold water

Combine the yeast with sugar and warm water in a large bowl and allow to
proof. Mix the salt with the flour and add to the yeast mixture, a cup at
a time, until you have a stiff dough. Remove to a lightly floured board
and knead until no longer sticky, about 10 minutes, adding flour as
necessary. Place in a buttered bowl and turn to coat the surface with
butter.

Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk..1 1/2-2 hrs.

Punch down the dough. Turn out on a floured board and shape into two long,
French bread-style loaves. Place on a baking sheet that has been sprinkled
with the cornmeal, but NOT buttered. Slash the tops of the loaves
diagonally in two or three places with a single edge razor blade or sharp
knife, brush the loaves with the egg white wash. Place in a COLD oven, set
the temperature at 400 degrees, and bake 35 minutes, or until well browned
and hollow sounding when the tops are tapped.
