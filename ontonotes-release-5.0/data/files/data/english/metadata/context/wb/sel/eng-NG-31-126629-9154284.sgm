&quot;I'm now working on getting the water suitable for discus&quot;

I understand that Discus are hard to keep. Is that true? I would love to get some but I don't wnt to kill them all off.

Must have been a stunning tank but will resist your inspiration this
time - still got almost all 50 of my cardinals/neons - all growing out
nicely....I'm now working on getting the water suitable for discus
(and also wondering how I can afford them with all the money I'm
chucking at the reef tank not to mention the new kitchen tank which
will be going in next spring, and the pond that will need stocking and
more plants in the spring too)....the tank looks nice enough with the
tetras so I guess I'm not in any great hurry.....

A (non-fishkeeping) friend dropped in this morning - normally it is
straight to the reef tank with the wows but today she was just as
enthusiastic over the 6 footer - the only change is the
Platys.......might have to fight the urge to get a few more at the
weekend - he, he....

&gt; On a sadder note, my Red Platys (home fish) have completely changed to
&gt; a new generation.  Without predators and in old age, they slowly
&gt; succumbed to fungal diseases of the skin.  I treated the tank once,
&gt; but fungus naturally returns and is nature's way of getting rid of the
&gt; weak and old.  These were very large old fish.  I thought all their
&gt; young would be completely unaffected, but with a relatively large host
&gt; area and a smallish tank (70g), the first generation was also
&gt; affected.  Some extra water changes, and no other younger fish were
&gt; affected.  They are now the tank's healthy inhabitants and already
&gt; dropping fry.  This is what I wanted, perpetual restocking ;~)
&gt; ~~

It's always sad to lose old fishy friends. My most prolific platy (aka
The Mother Ship) died of old age this year......sadly when I redid the
tank only two of her offspring remained - one didn't make the move to
my Son's tank very well and only lasted a shortwhile - the remaining
one is crying out for a few companions but I don't think my son still
has the interest in the tank that he once had.....

Perpetual restocking is good :-) I've not bought any Mbunas for coming
on for 4 years now and the tank is still overstocked - not many of the
originals remain :-( - they either got picked off in turf wars or
battered in matings that went wrong - very few females left either so
not much restocking going on at the mo....

All fish are easy to keep if you can replicate their food and
environmental conditions closely enough, however the size of the
acceptable window of pH, water hardness, diet, space etc in which they
will thrive varies by species.

When it comes to food, true omnivores are the easiest to keep, while
specialized eaters are more of a challenge.  Discus can be picky
eaters.  Once you find something they eat well (ie: frozen bloodworms,
beefheart etc), you realize that it's not very economical or a diverse
enough diet.  Their appetitie does improve if their conditions are
stable and to their liking.

When it comes to environment, there is stability (rate of change) and
the absolute levels (pH / gH average).  Generally poor stability and/
or non-ideal conditions are better tolerated by larger and more active
fish.  Size gives them stamina and time, and their higher activity
level gives them a higher metabolism to adjust to their environment.

Discus are not very active and don't have a high metabolism.  Once
stabilized in a tank, they become quite robust, as their size would
suggest, but until then, they tend to be as fragile as a smaller
fish.  Their environmental requirements are warm soft water (warmer
than many plants and fish would like).  They prefer lower pH (7.2 or
less) and are generally less tolerant of high pH than most cichlids.
Maintaining a tank of low pH soft water is generally more trouble as
the pH stability is less forgiving when the kH is low.

Being cichlids, they need their territorial space (large tanks), but
they are not predators to most other fish so you need to keep them
away from more aggressive fish.  They do best with small shoaling fish
which don't swim too fast, won't bother them, and won't be too
aggressive eating all the food.

Their breeding requirements are also a little unique, which drives
their cost up significantly.

Discus are more expensive and have a narrower range of acceptable
water conditions, tankmates and food, in an environement which is a
little harder to maintain, so armed with the right setup and
knowledge, they can be as easy to keep as any other fish ;~)

Hope that helps :o)

I can't really answer as to how hard to keep Discus are as I've not
kept them before - there are some Discus keepers that check in on this
group who can better answer......but they are a bit expensive if you
do kill them off so it is best to do lots of research first and I'm
currently at this stage.....The kH and GH of your water are important
- the pH is also (needs to be lowish) but from what I understand it is
the softness of the water which is most important......the water out
of my tap is liquid rock and then some so totally unsuited to keep
Discus however.....never being one not to rise to the challenge, I'm
working on getting my water softer and pH down by using RO water
instead of tap. Clean water and freqent water changes also seem to be
a must from my research so far......this adds to the expense if you
have to buy the water in from your LFS and also the incovenience. I'm
getting my own RO/DI unit for my reef tank(s) as I am finding the
aquisition of sufficient RO water to be getting a pain - because I'm
hankering after Discus (and upgrading my Nano to a full sized reef) I
am over specifying the capacity of the unit....still &quot;discussing&quot; the
plumbing and implementation with hubby before ordering it....

Never being one to do things the easy way I am converting an existing
tank to have water parameters that are suitable for Discus.....with
hindsight I should have just chucked the water and started from
scratch (the tank has been running 4.5 years) but I wanted to keep
some of my existing fish in there and did not want to shock them by
changing the chemistry of the water in one go......the tank currently
has a school of neon/cardinal tetras (between 40-50), a YoYo loach, a
Flying Fox, two Burmese Squirrel Loaches, an Arabesque Plec (not sure
if it is a King or a Queen), amano shrimps and IIRC some otos but
haven't seen them recently (they tend to pop up when I least expect to
see them). Ideally before introducing the discus I will need to find a
way of removing the YoYo and the Flying Fox both of whom evaded
capture when I first started working on the tank - neither are really
suitable tank mates for discus. There is a pic of it on the files
section on TFA - the only change being that the YoYo dug up the
smaller plants that are at the front....(tetra tank full 2-10, tetra
tank - middle 2-10 and tetra tank red plant 2-10) - the crypts are
starting to fill in the spaces left but I suspect I will be out buying
more plants for it when I see something that takes my fancy (knowing
me it will be more crypts).

I am gradually adding the RO water at water changes (usually 1/2 RO
and 1/2 tap at the moment) and will probably up this just before I get
the Discus.....I do need to run some tests on the KH/GH as it has been
sometime since I last did them (ran some this morning and then
realised I was using my marine kit which does KH/Alk and wouldn't give
me a good comparison with last time - doh).....For information the KH
came out at 12.2dKH and the ALK at 4.34 meg/L.....It was a KH of 13dKH
back in September - (different test kit) the pH remains unchanged at
7.5 - I might rerun the test using my original kit......

I'm not in a great hurry to add any Discus yet as the reef stuff seems
to be eating a massive hole in my bank account at the moment and is
taking up a massive chunk of my time as well......

Generally the best advice, especially when starting off, is to keep
fish that match your water unless you are prepared (and are nuts
enough) to go the route of providing water that matches the
fish.......IIRC your pH is pretty neutral but I don't recall your KH/
GH

Are they cichlids!!?? Then they would need a fishless cycled tank. Would they handle ghost knives, angels, and blood parrots?

Discus  have always been a fish  I like looking  at , but  know full well my
water  does not suit them, and changing the  water  here to suit their
needs would be a nightmare,  low pH  i could possibly do  with enough
bogwood,  but the GH/ KH  would be the problem,  temp  wise  not a  problem
most of my tanks run  around 26C,
I remeber  a few years ago  when  I first saw a tank  of Discus in a LFS
they did look awesome , and the tank was  tall  and long  but  quite
narrow,  I always  wondered how the tank worked  without bowing,
Angels are  another fish  I like  to look  at  but  I dont think they would
like  my water  either,

Yes they are Cichlids,  dont think  mixing them  with any of the others
would be a good idea,

&gt; water conditions, tankmates and food, in an environement which is a
&gt; little harder to maintain, so armed with the right setup and
&gt; knowledge, they can be as easy to keep as any other fish ;~)

&gt; Hope that helps :o)

&gt; &gt; Must have been a stunning tank but will resist your inspiration this
&gt; &gt; time - still got almost all 50 of my cardinals/neons - all growing out
&gt; &gt; nicely....I'm now working on getting the water suitable for discus
&gt; &gt; (and also wondering how I can afford them with all the money I'm
&gt; &gt; chucking at the reef tank not to mention the new kitchen tank which
&gt; &gt; will be going in next spring, and the pond that will need stocking and
&gt; &gt; more plants in the spring too)....the tank looks nice enough with the
&gt; &gt; tetras so I guess I'm not in any great hurry.....

&gt; &gt; A (non-fishkeeping) friend dropped in this morning - normally it is
&gt; &gt; straight to the reef tank with the wows but today she was just as
&gt; &gt; enthusiastic over the 6 footer - the only change is the
&gt; &gt; Platys.......might have to fight the urge to get a few more at the
&gt; &gt; weekend - he, he....

&gt; &gt; &gt; On a sadder note, my Red Platys (home fish) have completely changed to
&gt; &gt; &gt; a new generation.  Without predators and in old age, they slowly
&gt; &gt; &gt; succumbed to fungal diseases of the skin.  I treated the tank once,
&gt; &gt; &gt; but fungus naturally returns and is nature's way of getting rid of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; weak and old.  These were very large old fish.  I thought all their
&gt; &gt; &gt; young would be completely unaffected, but with a relatively large host
&gt; &gt; &gt; area and a smallish tank (70g), the first generation was also
&gt; &gt; &gt; affected.  Some extra water changes, and no other younger fish were
&gt; &gt; &gt; affected.  They are now the tank's healthy inhabitants and already
&gt; &gt; &gt; dropping fry.  This is what I wanted, perpetual restocking ;~)
&gt; &gt; &gt; ~~

&gt; &gt; It's always sad to lose old fishy friends. My most prolific platy (aka
&gt; &gt; The Mother Ship) died of old age this year......sadly when I redid the
&gt; &gt; tank only two of her offspring remained - one didn't make the move to
&gt; &gt; my Son's tank very well and only lasted a shortwhile - the remaining
&gt; &gt; one is crying out for a few companions but I don't think my son still
&gt; &gt; has the interest in the tank that he once had.....

&gt; &gt; Perpetual restocking is good :-) I've not bought any Mbunas for coming
&gt; &gt; on for 4 years now and the tank is still overstocked - not many of the
&gt; &gt; originals remain :-( - they either got picked off in turf wars or
&gt; &gt; battered in matings that went wrong - very few females left either so
&gt; &gt; not much restocking going on at the mo....

Local MA  is on the same water  as me  but I dont know if they use different
parameters as they have about 3 seperate filtration  units , I know  last
time  I asked  they said the pH out of the tap  was 8.0,  mine in all my
tanks  is usually around  7.6 , Some of the Angels they have had for sale
have looked  nice   and others looked  decidedly  unwell , most I think  are
tank  bred , occasionally  they  do get some  Altums, which  is when  I
get   the  Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh they would look nice in my  tank  syndrome but
then common sense  kicks  back  in ,

&gt; Allen

I can't really answer as to how hard to keep Discus are as I've not
kept them before - there are some Discus keepers that check in on this
group who can better answer......but they are a bit expensive if you
do kill them off so it is best to do lots of research first and I'm
currently at this stage.....The kH and GH of your water are important
- the pH is also (needs to be lowish) but from what I understand it is
the softness of the water which is most important......the water out
of my tap is liquid rock and then some so totally unsuited to keep
Discus however.....never being one not to rise to the challenge, I'm
working on getting my water softer and pH down by using RO water
instead of tap. Clean water and freqent water changes also seem to be
a must from my research so far......this adds to the expense if you
have to buy the water in from your LFS and also the incovenience. I'm
getting my own RO/DI unit for my reef tank(s) as I am finding the
aquisition of sufficient RO water to be getting a pain - because I'm
hankering after Discus (and upgrading my Nano to a full sized reef) I
am over specifying the capacity of the unit....still &quot;discussing&quot; the
plumbing and implementation with hubby before ordering it....

Never being one to do things the easy way I am converting an existing
tank to have water parameters that are suitable for Discus.....with
hindsight I should have just chucked the water and started from
scratch (the tank has been running 4.5 years) but I wanted to keep
some of my existing fish in there and did not want to shock them by
changing the chemistry of the water in one go......the tank currently
has a school of neon/cardinal tetras (between 40-50), a YoYo loach, a
Flying Fox, two Burmese Squirrel Loaches, an Arabesque Plec (not sure
if it is a King or a Queen), amano shrimps and IIRC some otos but
haven't seen them recently (they tend to pop up when I least expect to
see them). Ideally before introducing the discus I will need to find a
way of removing the YoYo and the Flying Fox both of whom evaded
capture when I first started working on the tank - neither are really
suitable tank mates for discus. There is a pic of it on the files
section on TFA - the only change being that the YoYo dug up the
smaller plants that are at the front....(tetra tank full 2-10, tetra
tank - middle 2-10 and tetra tank red plant 2-10) - the crypts are
starting to fill in the spaces left but I suspect I will be out buying
more plants for it when I see something that takes my fancy (knowing
me it will be more crypts).

I am gradually adding the RO water at water changes (usually 1/2 RO
and 1/2 tap at the moment) and will probably up this just before I get
the Discus.....I do need to run some tests on the KH/GH as it has been
sometime since I last did them (ran some this morning and then
realised I was using my marine kit which does KH/Alk and wouldn't give
me a good comparison with last time - doh).....For information the KH
came out at 12.2dKH and the ALK at 4.34 meg/L.....It was a KH of 13dKH
back in September - (different test kit) the pH remains unchanged at
7.5 - I might rerun the test using my original kit......

I'm not in a great hurry to add any Discus yet as the reef stuff seems
to be eating a massive hole in my bank account at the moment and is
taking up a massive chunk of my time as well......

Generally the best advice, especially when starting off, is to keep
fish that match your water unless you are prepared (and are nuts
enough) to go the route of providing water that matches the
fish.......IIRC your pH is pretty neutral but I don't recall your KH/
GH

KH is carbonate hardness of water. Another measurement that comes
under the label &quot;hardness&quot; is GH, and GH means general hardness. You
can increase KH by adding baking soda to the water (but remember that
baking soda contains SOME sodium) or by adding crushed coral (or
aragonite), and there are other ways I believe. To increase GH you can
add Epsom salts, which I think, isn't really a salt and except for
sudden changes or ridiculously high GH you can't (experts?) over dose
Epsom salts. Decreasing GH or KH sounds like a nightmare as compared
to increasing it. Good luck all and later!

&gt;Frank - have you done much discus breeding?

A couple of pair, 1969 and 1970. First pair was Turquoise, the other Browns. Gave them up just before the first gold angelfish were intorduced to the public.  I bought 2 dozen from Carl Naja, Jan.of 1970, thinking I was going to make a killing on them. They were called Naja Golds back then - didn't start to turn gold till they were 8 or 9 mos. old. Marbles were intorduced in late &quot;69&quot; and I had bought 2 dozen of them also. It was late &quot;70&quot; when everything started pairing off. Discus took to much of my time and I could make more money on the angels. I gave them to a friend, show quality guppy and betta breeder, Elvis Bryant, who then became a discus breeder. Well, didn't really &quot;give&quot; both pairs to him - I got 10% of the fry from each batch...
I bought a dozen Red Leopard Snake Discus from Sunrise Tropicals and a dozen Pigeon Blood Snake Discus from Great Lakes Discus a little over a mo. ago. Thinking about keeping them togeather and see what pairs off in a few mos................... Frank

Take your time and do lots of homework. Buy some books about the
specific species and crawl the web for articles and information. Find
the gurus, their names will appear over and over. Read the columnists in
the monthly aquarium magazines. As you get deeper into it, you'll begin
to recognize the names of highly regarded breeders. Anyone can call
themselves a breeder - but especially at auction sites, dig into those
user reviews and do a search on the breeder's name - that might lead to
discussion groups that can give you more insight into the particular
breeder as well as other breeders. Carefully weigh all the information
you pick up - bad reviews and good reviews can all be skewed a bit or
they might be right on. I've seen sellers get ripped to shreds by a
small group of people with a personal grudge, and I've seen good reviews
just because the person is popular at one forum or another.

And keep sharing what you find with the people here at TFA. There are
gurus lurking amongst our membership, but none will raise their hand in
class and say &quot;hey, I'm a guru!&quot;

You can say that again. I did my homework - didn't want to spend a lot of time raising something without it comming from a fish that that took first place in some of the larger shows. Wanted a breeding stock from two different blood lines. A cross between the two so I wouldn't be breeding brother to sister. The offspring would be a new blood line of &quot;show quality&quot; fish. That's why they cost a little more, you pay for what you get! That's why I went to Great Lakes Discus and Sunrise Tropicals - so my breeding stock would come from different blood lines, and from the best breeders (for the color line I'm looking for) out there...............

Another thought to keep in mind when perusing auctions is to exercise
caution when you see &quot;proven breeders&quot; for sale. Most of these are
probably good, young healthy fish, but . . . advertising fish as &quot;proven
breeders&quot; is a good way to get some final bucks out of a pair whose
spawning days are nearly over. I've seen a pet store owner get scammed
like this, he paid a lot of money to a breeder he barely knew for two
very large, I mean saucer sized bodies, gorgeous koi angels. They turned
out to be used up breeders and worth no more than the usual $6.99, and
with a shorter life expectancy.

I purchased my initial six pack of juveniles from an established breeder

Today was a no-water change day for me, which means I was busier doing
other stuff - mostly draining and moving tanks, moving fish to other
tanks, and the dreaded culling. As I was scooping out the doomed
juveniles, 50 or 60, I didn't count, the thought flashed through my head
that &quot;hey, I'll bet I could find someone at Aquabid who would pay good
money for these.&quot; I banished that thought and saw the procedure through

Another topic that you will find a great deal has been written when you
do a search here on TFA as well as Google. You will find plenty of
differing opinions on which is the &quot;right&quot; or &quot;humane&quot; way to kill an
animal. You've undoubtedly already read about some common methods. The
concepts of &quot;humane&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; don't fit comfortably in the same
sentence for me; that said I prefer a sharp and solid blow to the head
if I'm certain I won't miss on the first try. If euthanizing, (an easier
word to say than killing), a group of fish, as I did this morning, I put
them in a container of their tank water to which I've added a handful of
Bag Buddies which contains enough clove oil to mildly sedate them, I
work in a dimly lit room, and I pour the mess of intoxicated fish into a
zip lock freezer bag and stick them in the freezer. Right next to the
frozen vegetables. After learning that the vet who did my dog's surgery
last week has a special interest in fish, she agreed to provide me with
some MS222, a fish anesthetic that is supposedly easily overdosed, to
experiment with one of these days. Some of our members might have first
hand experience with this agent.

I think culling wandered into the thread about buying groups of fish at
auctions from some unscrupulous sellers who see the auction sites as a
way to get rid of their culls and make some money. And yes, culling is a
standalone subject for which I suggested further readings through
searches on TFA and Google for those who would like to learn more about
it. I thought the redirection was a more  constructive response than
simply saying, &quot;that's off topic.&quot;

Hi all,
For my ten cents worth, to keep discus happy it is pretty
straightforward, soft water is not the most paramount condition to be
met.  Rather keep everything stable.  If you do have exceptionally
hard water cut it with RO water or rain water.  I always use geoliquid
for discus to supply required minerals etc and have no significant
troubles.  Water temp at 28C and not too hard a flow through the tank
and a Ph of 7.0.  When it comes to spawning and raising the fry, then
there is a totally different challenge. :-)
Cheers
Greg

The old girl has done very well. She gets her staples removed tomorrow,
10 days, and her incisions look clean and dry. As they should. She's
gotten into a couple of hard rough and tumble play sessions with Rufus
and is pretty much back to her old self. It's been  frosty with on and
off snow flurries this week, and that is the kind of weather that
totally rejuvenates her.

Thanks for checking on her. Regarding holidays and topics: many of us
are surrounded with family and friends today, many of us are not. I'm
glad that the TFA family is here to provide that extra bit of
companionship and camaraderie for those who might need it. And
considering that Thanksgiving is not a world-wide holiday, thanks to our
international members for putting up with us.

Had to grin - - - two or three times after reading that. Bet you well over half the fish one sees for sale on-line are runts, culls, or &quot;over the hill&quot;. There are a half dozen or so, people on-line selling good sized discus and angels, &quot;because they like to raise them&quot;... Hmmm, right - lets see, they raise them to breeding size, or even breeding pairs, for someone else?  I know a couple of guys that has bought them to let them grow to breeding size for their breeders. Even seen them buy the breeding pairs on-line, just to find out what they had bought were the runts, culled fish. Sure they look good - still &quot;somewhat&quot; young, but will stay half sized. I've seen a dozen 2' to 2.5&quot; great looking on-line discus sold to a guy that put them into a 100gal. tank to grow-out. Instead, they paired off and spawned - what a joke - 3 or 4 pair within the same amount of weeks. Each spawn was 20 to 25 eggs, and were small for discus eggs. These were full grown runts, which were given away

But of course I let the initial 6 select their own mates. That's how the
&quot;Your First Angelfish&quot; book said to do it. I've come a long way since
then. My initial goal wasn't internet selling, it was simply to fill a
bunch of tanks with angels and trade some to the local pet stores.

Re: internet &quot;breeders&quot; selling their culls as something more than they
really are - reminds me of puppy mills. Someone's making a lot of money
and doing nothing to improve the strain. Degrading the strain, in fact.

The dozen potentials I mentioned a little while ago were selected when
they were 5 or 6 months old from a group of at least a hundred
candidates in several different tanks, all with the same parents, the
parents who are/were about as close to meeting all of the important
standards as I've ever seen. So when and if any of this dozen pair up,
I'm pretty confident that they're going to produce good fry. But I won't
really know until I've seen a couple of broods from these pairings.

The previously mentioned black pair that produces terrible blacks but
gorgeous golds are being used simply for their plain golds. The black
babies are being culled as soon as I can identify their color. And a pet
shop just asked me a few days ago if I have any young plain golds for
him. So that inferior black pair is earning their keep. Or at least half
their keep. Their black/gold ratio is 50/50. As opposed to my favorite
black pair whose line I am trying to keep going, they produce an average
of 300 eggs with no golds, and fewer than 10 white/unfertilized eggs.
They're earning their keep and everyone else's.

OK - that's the 'other way' of doing it. I thought you bought a half dozen - dozen from the LPS, grew them out and let them pair off. I didn't know you bought hand picked stock from a breeder. Well, you started off a lot smarter than I did! Yep, I bought my first breeding stock from a pet store - spent the best part of a year getting them to size, let the bunch pick their own mates, and yes, had breeders that produced mostly culls - - - and didn't know it untill I joined a fish club.

You still haven't got my sequence perzactly right, but close enough. If
we sat down by the fireplace and discussed our experiences until the sun
comes up, we would probably come out in a pretty close tie regarding
stupid mistakes we've made. My very first pair that spawned was like
&quot;Hey! What the heck are those two fish doing in there?&quot;

I have an unusually experienced and clear headed lfs, he's also a
personal friend. Before he built his store, he had an angel breeding
operation in his basement, next to the wood stove. Free heat. And he
also confessed to me that the 600 degree coals and flames provided an
excellent cull - a - torium. So he knows where I've been and where I am
going with my angels and can recognize a good fish when he sees it. And
he doesn't hesitate to tell me when he says a bad fish as well. He's
been a great support for my occasional off-the-wall questions that don't
seem to be in the books, or on the internet, for that matter. And thanks
to his support of Angelfish Gardens, it is now possible to buy good
angelfish in Eastern Maine.

The topic is Discus, a fish that I refuse to add to my hobby, knowing
full well that I will jump in all the way; the angels are keeping me
busy enough for now.

I live a long way from anywhere; the internet has opened a whole new
world of information for me. And yes, some of that information probably
improved the learning curve for me, but it's also to blame for my
occasionally walking smack into a major blunder. The Krib, FINS, and
alt/rec aquaria were all good resources, not only in the information
they provided, but in directing me to other places for more information.
I think I still have a hard copy of the complete aquaria FAQS from those
days. A little dated in places, but still a treasure trove of information.

Marco's English is a lot better than my German, but that's not saying
much ;~)  Marco can be frank, (and sometimes a little unclear) but
I've never found him to be offensive to anyone.

Like Andy, I think Marco is reminding us that we don't all have the
same experience levels.  Some of the information discussed here, is at
intermediate and expert levels, so if anyone was really serious about
keeping a certain fish, they should still research the basics.
Snippits of 'expert' tricks cannot replace basic knowledge of
particular species.

You are right. English not being someone's native language things can be misunderstood. Can Marco rephrase or restate it so that I can understand better. If it's important to be posted then it's important enough for me to understand. Let's try again please.

not at all  allen  what you have to consider is some of the members  use  english  as a 2nd language  so what they  mean to say could be structured differently ,  JMO  but  it could be that it was a polite comment  about recapping on  the basics  before considering  more adventurous projects  or tank mates , Everyone  has their own opinion and  express it as best they  can  without meaning /trying  to cause  offence,
We are all here to help  each other when we can  with  advice or suggestions, many of the group have lots of  experience of not only  keeping fish  as a hobby  but have also  done so on a commercial basis,  so we all learn  a lot  from what  they  have experienced, that being said  we are all  still learning  as new  species  and ideas appear .

Do I need to be offended here since I'm the one that started this thread?!

Having known Marco for many years, and not wishing to make assumptions as to
his exact meaning (I’ve known him long enough not to try - ;-) )….my best
guess is that he is telling you the same as I did when you started talking
about the SW Nano…..learn to walk before you run…..no offence meant….and
yes, English is my first language
