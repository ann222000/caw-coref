V-22 Osprey: A Flying Shame
By Mark Thompson

It's hard to imagine an American weapons program so fraught with
problems that Dick Cheney would try repeatedly to cancel it - hard,
that is, until you get to know the Osprey. As Defense Secretary under
George H.W. Bush, Cheney tried four times to kill the Marine Corps's
ungainly tilt-rotor aircraft. Four times he failed. Cheney found the
arguments for the combat troop carrier unpersuasive and its problems
irredeemable. &quot;Given the risk we face from a military standpoint,
given the areas where we think the priorities ought to be, the V-22 is
not at the top of the list,&quot; he told a Senate committee in 1989. &quot;It
came out at the bottom of the list, and for that reason, I decided to
terminate it.&quot; But the Osprey proved impossible to kill, thanks to
lawmakers who rescued it from Cheney's ax time and again because of
the home-district money that came with it - and to the irresistible
notion that American engineers had found a way to improve on another
great aviation breakthrough, the helicopter.

Now the aircraft that flies like an airplane but takes off and lands
like a chopper is about to make its combat debut in Iraq. It has been
a long, strange trip: the V-22 has been 25 years in development, more
than twice as long as the Apollo program that put men on the moon.
V-22 crashes have claimed the lives of 30 men - 10 times the lunar
program's toll - all before the plane has seen combat. The Pentagon
has put $20 billion into the Osprey and expects to spend an additional
$35 billion before the program is finished. In exchange, the Marines,
Navy and Air Force will get 458 aircraft, averaging $119 million per
copy.

The saga of the V-22 - the battles over its future on Capitol Hill, a
performance record that is spotty at best, a long, determined quest by
the Marines to get what they wanted - demonstrates how Washington
works (or, rather, doesn't). It exposes the compromises that are made
when narrow interests collide with common sense. It is a tale that
shows how the system fails at its most significant task, by placing in
jeopardy those we count on to protect us. For even at a stratospheric
price, the V-22 is going into combat shorthanded. As a result of
decisions the Marine Corps made over the past decade, the aircraft
lacks a heavy-duty, forward-mounted machine gun to lay down
suppressing fire against forces that will surely try to shoot it down.
And if the plane's two engines are disabled by enemy fire or
mechanical trouble while it's hovering, the V-22 lacks a helicopter's
ability to coast roughly to the ground - something that often saved
lives in Vietnam. In 2002 the Marines abandoned the requirement that
the planes be capable of autorotating (as the maneuver is called),
with unpowered but spinning helicopter blades slowly letting the
aircraft land safely. That decision, a top Pentagon aviation
consultant wrote in a confidential 2003 report obtained by TIME, is
&quot;unconscionable&quot; for a wartime aircraft. &quot;When everything goes wrong,
as it often does in a combat environment,&quot; he said, &quot;autorotation is
all a helicopter pilot has to save his and his passengers' lives.&quot;

The Plane That Wouldn't Die

In many ways, the V-22 is a classic example of how large weapons
systems have been built in the U.S. since Dwight Eisenhower warned in
1961 of the &quot;unwarranted influence&quot; of &quot;the military-industrial
complex.&quot; The Osprey has taken years to design, build, test and bring
to the field. All that time meant plenty of money for its prime
contractors, Bell Helicopter and the Boeing Co. As the plane took
shape and costs increased, some of its missions were shelved or
sidelined. And yet, with the U.S. spending almost $500 billion a year
on defense - not counting the nearly $200 billion annually for
operations in Iraq and Afghanistan - there's plenty of money for
marginal or unnecessary programs. Pentagon reform and efficiency are
far less of a cause among lawmakers today than during the years of
Ronald Reagan's comparatively modest defense-spending boom. &quot;Almost
every program the U.S. military is now buying takes longer to develop,
costs more than predicted and usually doesn't meet the original
specifications and requirements,&quot; says Gordon Adams, who oversaw
military spending for the Office of Management and Budget during Bill
Clinton's Administration.

The Marine Corps likes to boast that it spends only a nickel out of
every Pentagon dollar and makes do with cheaper weapons than the other
services. The story of the V-22 belies that image: It's a tale of how
a military service with little experience overseeing aircraft programs
has wound up with a plane that may be as notable for its shortcomings
as for its technological advances.

First, some history. Because Marines deploy aboard ships, the
service's chiefs have always hungered for vertical lift - aircraft
that could take off and land from small decks and fly far inland to
drop off combat-ready troops. As the Marines' Vietnam-era CH-46
choppers became obsolete, commanders started to dream of an aircraft
that would give them more options when considering an amphibious
assault. The dreams intensified following the failed Desert One
mission in 1980 to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran. In the course of the
operation, three helicopters broke down, leading to an order to abort
the entire endeavor, and a fourth chopper collided with a C-130
aircraft at a desert base, killing eight U.S. troops. That sent
Pentagon bureaucrats hunting for a transport that could be used by all
four military services and prevent another fiasco. Reagan, who took
office the year after Desert One, began to pour money into the
Pentagon, particularly for research and design into new weapons and
combat systems. The Osprey was born.

Originally, the program was designed to churn out the first of more
than 1,000 tilt-rotors in less than 10 years for $40 million each. But
this was no conventional plane. The Osprey may cruise like an
airplane, but it takes off and lands vertically like a helicopter. The
technical challenge of rotating an airplane's wings and engines in
midair led to delays, which in turn led to an ever higher price tag.
As expenses rose, the Pentagon cut the number of planes it wanted to
buy, which in turn increased the unit price. Citing rising costs, the
Army abandoned the project in 1983.

That left the relatively tiny Marine Corps footing most of the bill
for the project - the V-22 accounts for nearly 70% of its procurement
budget - and overseeing a program larger and more technically
challenging than any the service was accustomed to managing. Sensing
weakness at the Pentagon, congressional supporters, largely from the
V-22's key manufacturing states of Texas (Bell Helicopter) and
Pennsylvania (Boeing), created the Tilt-Rotor Technology Coalition to
keep the craft alive, despite Cheney's opposition. They were aided by
nearly 2,000 V-22 suppliers, in more than 40 states, who pressured
their lawmakers to stick with the program. And so, despite Cheney's
doubts, the Osprey survived.

By 1993, as the Osprey program approached its 12th birthday and Bill
Clinton became President, the Marines had spent $13 billion on the
planes. None were ready for war. In 1991 one of the first V-22s
crashed when taking off for its maiden flight - because of improper
wiring. A second crash killed seven in 1992. The Clinton Pentagon
stuck with the program through the 1990s, but in 2000 two more V-22s
crashed, killing 23 Marines. With that, the Marines grounded the
Osprey for 18 months.

Probes into the deadly 2000 crashes revealed that in a rush to deploy
the aircraft, the Marines had dangerously cut corners in their testing
program. The number of different flight configurations - varying
speed, weight and other factors - flown by test pilots to ensure safe
landings was reduced by half to meet deadlines. Then only two-thirds
of those curtailed flight tests were conducted. That trend continues:
while a 2004 plan called for 131 hours of nighttime flight tests, the
Marines managed to run only 33 on the Osprey. Why the shortcuts?
Problems with a gearbox kept many V-22s and pilots grounded. That
meant many pilots lacked the hours required to qualify for night
flying. Similarly, sea trials were curtailed because the ship
designated to assist with Osprey tests could spare only 10 of the 21
days needed.

There's also been controversy over a sandstorm test for the craft. The
V-22's tendency to generate a dust storm when it lands in desert-like
terrain wasn't examined because &quot;an unusually wet spring resulted in a
large amount of vegetation that prevented severe brownouts during
landing attempts,&quot; the Pentagon's top tester noted. But the program
continued, albeit with a caution about the aircraft's ability to fly
in dusty conditions.

The Engine-Failure Problem

After the 2000 grounding, Osprey pilots were told to fly less
aggressively, which critics say is the only reason no V-22 has crashed
since. &quot;They keep talking about all the things it can do, but little
by little its operations are being more and more restricted,&quot; says
Philip Coyle, who monitored the V-22's development as the Pentagon's
top weapons tester from 1994 to 2001. The V-22 can fly safely &quot;if used
like a truck, carrying people from one safe area to another safe
area,&quot; he says. &quot;But I don't see them using it in combat situations
where they will have to do a lot of maneuvering.&quot;

The Marines contend that the V-22 is an assault aircraft and that no
pilot who finds himself dodging bullets is going to fly it gently.
&quot;The airplane is incredibly maneuverable,&quot; says Lieut. Colonel Anthony
(Buddy) Bianca, a veteran V-22 pilot. But the dirty little secret
about an aircraft that combines the best features of an airplane and a
helicopter is that it combines their worst features too. The V-22
can't glide as well as an airplane, and it can't hover as well as a
helicopter. If a

I was involved (as R&amp;D manager for a major components supplier) in this
program about 20 years ago. I thought then, and still do now, that it is an
overcomplicated system, and that it broke so much new ground that the USMC
would not be competent to manage its development. Both opinions were
sustained by events. The program should have been killed.

Nevertheless let's not prejudge the V-22 now that it has finally reached
deployment. The capabilities it provides are significant, and I do agree
that they are needed and will be valuable. The limitations that remain are
distressing but not necessarily crippling. Other aircraft have operated with
similar constraints before. A lot of people were killed during development
of the helicopter, and several other groundbreaking technologies.

Although I don't think the program was worth the time and money spent or
losing the two or three types of advanced helicopters that could have been
developed instead, the V-22 is not necessarily going to turn out to be a
failure in service. It can fly much faster and farther than a helicopter,
and I don't see why it can't receive the armament that is now lacking as a
future upgrade.

Perhaps the greatest benefit from this effort is that it will someday be
possible to develop a successor to the V-22 that will really demonstrate the
full potential of tilt-rotor technology.

Remember the F-111? Another developmental boondoggle that after a great deal
of cost escalation and mismanagement, turned out to be a very fine aircraft
in service.

Excellent idea. No air forces, no aerial war, no civil transport and
mankind will always remember Wright Fliers as the epitome of man's folly
in the air. Now, if the Montgolfiers hadn't invented lighter than air
flight, think of all the lives that could have been saved there also.

Even more lives would have been saved if railroads hadn't been
invented. Man was never intended to fly nor travel faster than a horse.

The fact is that over long distances, 100 mi, say, a man can outrun a
horse. You can catch them, eventually just by chasing them until they
are too tired to go on. This applies to open country, without fences,
of course.

&gt; &gt; V-22 Osprey: A Flying Shame
&gt; &gt; By Mark Thompson

&gt; &gt; It's hard to imagine an American weapons program so fraught with
&gt; &gt; problems that Dick Cheney would try repeatedly to cancel it - hard,
&gt; &gt; that is, until you get to know the Osprey. As Defense Secretary under
&gt; &gt; George H.W. Bush, Cheney tried four times to kill the Marine Corps's
&gt; &gt; ungainly tilt-rotor aircraft. Four times he failed. Cheney found the
&gt; &gt; arguments for the combat troop carrier unpersuasive and its problems
&gt; &gt; irredeemable. &quot;Given the risk we face from a military standpoint,
&gt; &gt; given the areas where we think the priorities ought to be, the V-22 is
&gt; &gt; not at the top of the list,&quot; he told a Senate committee in 1989. &quot;It
&gt; &gt; came out at the bottom of the list, and for that reason, I decided to
&gt; &gt; terminate it.&quot; But the Osprey proved impossible to kill, thanks to
&gt; &gt; lawmakers who rescued it from Cheney's ax time and again because of
&gt; &gt; the home-district money that came with it - and to the irresistible
&gt; &gt; notion that American engineers had found a way to improve on another
&gt; &gt; great aviation breakthrough, the helicopter.

&gt; &gt; Now the aircraft that flies like an airplane but takes off and lands
&gt; &gt; like a chopper is about to make its combat debut in Iraq. It has been
&gt; &gt; a long, strange trip: the V-22 has been 25 years in development, more
&gt; &gt; than twice as long as the Apollo program that put men on the moon.
&gt; &gt; V-22 crashes have claimed the lives of 30 men - 10 times the lunar
&gt; &gt; program's toll - all before the plane has seen combat. The Pentagon
&gt; &gt; has put $20 billion into the Osprey and expects to spend an additional
&gt; &gt; $35 billion before the program is finished. In exchange, the Marines,
&gt; &gt; Navy and Air Force will get 458 aircraft, averaging $119 million per
&gt; &gt; copy.

&gt; I was involved (as R&amp;D manager for a major components supplier) in this
&gt; program about 20 years ago. I thought then, and still do now, that it is an
&gt; overcomplicated system, and that it broke so much new ground that the USMC
&gt; would not be competent to manage its development. Both opinions were
&gt; sustained by events. The program should have been killed.

&gt; Nevertheless let's not prejudge the V-22 now that it has finally reached
&gt; deployment. The capabilities it provides are significant, and I do agree
&gt; that they are needed and will be valuable. The limitations that remain are
&gt; distressing but not necessarily crippling. Other aircraft have operated with
&gt; similar constraints before. A lot of people were killed during development
&gt; of the helicopter, and several other groundbreaking technologies.

&gt; Although I don't think the program was worth the time and money spent or
&gt; losing the two or three types of advanced helicopters that could have been
&gt; developed instead, the V-22 is not necessarily going to turn out to be a
&gt; failure in service. It can fly much faster and farther than a helicopter,
&gt; and I don't see why it can't receive the armament that is now lacking as a
&gt; future upgrade.

&gt; Perhaps the greatest benefit from this effort is that it will someday be
&gt; possible to develop a successor to the V-22 that will really demonstrate the
&gt; full potential of tilt-rotor technology.

&gt; Remember the F-111? Another developmental boondoggle that after a great deal
&gt; of cost escalation and mismanagement, turned out to be a very fine aircraft
&gt; in service.
">

A lifetime ago, when the ability of propeller aircraft to fly out of
danger zones began to come to an end, the top brass got it into their
heads that faster aircraft could be used in their stead. And so it was
that the jet fighter bomber became the military's best weapon.

But in the first Iraq war it was realised that speed alone was not
enough, fast jets need altitude and speed and also they need
sacrificial decoys. The whole shebang is a real expense.

And the Marines thought they could do front line work with a
slowplane? How?

What sort of thinking allows war planners to imagine they can get slow
and ungainly aircraft with speeds and abilities akin to WW 2 aircraft
into airspace that rice farmers and camel mongers control?

Even if the MV-22 worked -perfectly- it is still a grotesque
boondoggle because it is dependent on Cobra gunships for escort.  It's
speed and range in that sense is exactly the same as the Cobra's.

&gt;   Excellent idea. No air forces, no aerial war, no civil transport and

In Wales they have a competition between runners and horse riders over

Yeah the CL-84 was the 1st operational though
embryotic aircraft of it's kind. Given that the major
physics, engineering and flying issues were 90%
resolved it should have been adopted to provide
experience and more testing and improvement.
It could have been handy for Pres. Carter.

FWIW, I would have put a single engine in the
fuselage and transmitted power to props, man
that would give a fast safe responsive YAW,

">

Mark Thompson's Time article shows how little he understands of
aircraft.  Mark gives us no numbers, just a series of anecdotes.  The
quality of an aircraft is a matter of performance; speed, payload,
range, and cost.  A competant reporter would have given us those numbers
for the V22 and for competing aircraft.  Thompson, like most American
newsies, isn't really competant.

The V22 Osprey is a VTOL aircraft for aerial assault, battlefield
resupply, search/rescue and medevac.  Helicopters currently perform all
these missions.  The Marine Corps thinks the V22 will do them better
than the current helicopters can.  Maybe they have that right, maybe
they don't.
Here is a list of the important numbers Thompson fails to give us.

1. Payload.  How much cargo/how many troops can the machine get off the
ground with?  More is better.

2. Speed.  Better speed shortens the trip, meaning the aircraft can make
more trips in a day.  No VTOL aircraft is going to have enough speed to
outrun fighters or ground fire. but getting three round trips from ship
to shore in a day instead of two increases your airlift by 50%.  The
longer the trip, the more speed helps.  On real short trips, the turn
around time, time to refuel and reload, may exceed the flight time.  We
used to be able to turn a jet fighter around in 15 minutes (refuel,
service LOX and LN2, and load 5 missiles).  Never done a chopper, but
let us assume it isn't gonna turn any faster than a fighter.

3.  Range.  How far can the maximum payload be flown before we are out
of fuel? Long range and high speed allow aerial assault launched from
ships far out to sea, beyond Silkworm missile range, which is obviously
desirable.  We want to know the range when loaded, any aircraft will fly
much farther empty, or with the cargo bay filled with auxilary fuel tanks.

4. Cost.  If the aircraft is cheaper, we can afford more of them. Combat
aircraft are gonna take losses.  We don't want to run out of aircraft
halfway thru the war.

With all due respect.
I'm not sure which group this thread originated in but if it was
ours (sci.mil.nav) accuracy in ones statements is appreciated
(although unfortunately, absent too often) to avoid the hyperbole that
has no place in a scientific debate.
Six test pilots have died in V-22 testing.  Twenty Marines, composed
of aircrew and infantry, and 4 civilian tech-reps combine to acount
for the 30 deaths.  It took two minutes to find the information
(including names and rank/title.)
Thirty test pilots could imply a larger number of fatal crashes than
the actual three that occured.  Since the standard crew comprises one
pilot and one co-pilot a person could easily be fooled into believing
there have been fifteen fatal crashes.
If 3 747's crashed and I said Boeing crashes had killed 700 pilots
in the last couple years, wouldn't that seem a bit misleading to you?

Not even close, Ken.
The CL-84 first flew in May of 1965, with the first aircraft lost in
Sept.'67
The second CL-84 first flew in Feb. 1970, and was lost August of '73.
The third was flown in '73 or '73, and was retired in '74, IIRC.
Both losses were structural failures of propeller/gearbox systems, luckily
high enough and fast enough for the crews to punch out.

Compare and contrast to the Hiller X-18 First flight Nov 1959, retired July
1961
and the Hiller/LTV XC-142A
5 built- first flight Sept '64, 1st complete VTo/Transition/Transition/VL
Jan '65
1 lost on 5/67, (3 fatalities), rest retired in 1970.
The XC-142 was, in fact, a functional transport aircraft, capable of hauling
payloads of more than 10,000#, and qualified aboard Aircraft Carrier, LPH's
and LSD's.

I don't know what the CL.84 would have done for Pres. Carter - there were
plenty of other ways for him to run for the border, if so desired.  (Many,
in fact, would have offered to give him a lift.)  If you're talking about
the Iranian Rescue Mission, you're passing balloon gas, unless you can
establish that the CL-84 would have been impervious to sandstorms, and
capable of bouncing off of a C-130 without damaging either aircraft.

And with a single engine failure you plummet like a badly thrown boulder,
without losing the complexity and unreliability that cross-shafting multipel
engines together gives you.
(And what practical use would such a high yaw rate get you?
It's already too easy to make your copilot barf. :))

&gt;&gt; The fact is that over long distances, 100 mi, say, a man can outrun a

&gt; In Wales they have a competition between runners and horse riders over

&gt; (can't think of the name of it right now). Those guys have beaten cars

There was also the Fairy Rotadyne for a different approach to the same
