Okay, I'm getting rather annoyed with my Wallstreet... (233MHz, 13.3&quot;)
It sat unused for months, and then my Toshiba Tecra died (worthless
piece of junk), so I decided to resurrect it. I stuck my 20GB IBM
Travelstar in, and a 128MB SODIMM, in addition to the 64MB already in
it. The 128MB SODIMM in the upper memory slot, the 64MB SODIMM in the
lower memory slot.
I put Jaguar on one partition, and OS 9.1 on another.
After about a day, I noticed it was incredibly slow.. I.E. paging
constantly, etc. Then, I noticed Mac OS was only seeing 64MB RAM. So I
reseated the 128MB SODIMM, and lo and behold, I was up to 192MB again,
and it was running normally. No more than a day later, I started it up
only to discover that Mac OS was once again only reporting 64MB. So I
reseated the 128MB SODIMM again. Success. But less than 30 minutes
after that, the extra 128MB disappeared again. So I moved the 128MB
SODIMM to the bottom slot and the 64MB SODIMM to the top slot. Now
it's reporting +/- 64MB randomly. Right now it's reporting the full
192MB. What could possibly be wrong with the slot. I know it has to be
something physical, since reseating the SODIMM seems to temporarily
alleviate it. Thanks ahead of time!
Another (completely unrelated) issue is the fact that my PRAM battery
is dead, so everytime I unplug the computer the PRAM resets. This
wouldn't be a problem, but the computer insists on booting into OS 9,
and often when I go into the startup disk control panel to change
that, the computer will freeze completely (the cursor freezes and
everything).

Since moving from the top slot to the bottom slot didn't really fix
the problem, I'd assume that it's an issue with the chip. But I agree
with with you that it's something physical.

I'm not sure why Startup Disk would freeze. A solution to that would
be to buy a new PRAM battery. You can probably get one for cheap on
the Swap List. Here's a guide from iFixIt about how to install it:

I hope that helped.

You could try holding X on boot.  I know that works on New World ROM... aka
my Pismo and all other macs I have had.  But if it is supported, that will
tell the booter to go to the default OSX installation.

It's either the stick of memory, or it's the slot the memory goes in.  Check with a
magnifying glass to see if one of the contacts on the slot has pulled loose. I
have seen that before and had to use a needle to push it back in place.  Also,
check the compatibility of the memory.  Wallstreets are very picky. My memory in my Pismo would not work at all in my Wallstreet. Go figure.

I have seen this many times before.  If it hangs in OS 9 while selecting start-up disk, do a power manager reset (ctrl-fn-shift-power button), and then try selecting again.  Every time it did that to me, I did that exact thing, and it would always allow me to select the start-up disk the second time around.  Don't know why it does that, but it does.

My Wallstreet also (probably) has a dead PRAM. I keep a Norton repair
disk in the CD, and the computer boots from that when it resets. It
also will tend to freeze if I go straight to startup disk.

What I have to do is: run Norton (it always finds something corrupted
in the directory), THEN go to startup disk. Then all is usually well.
Sometimes I have to restart (again to the Norton disk) after running
Norton, before I can reset the startup disk.

It's a pain, but I'm still too lazy to reset the PRAM battery. So
it's all my fault. ;-)

Damaged retainer(s).

These are plastic on some processors, metal on others.

Oh, and the metal retailers can short out some SODIMMS, and to avoid that
you have to put insulators on the SODIMMs before installing them.

Well, I know it's not compatibility, because the problem affects any
SODIMM in the top slot. When I get home later this week (I'm not at
home right now), I'll check the slot with a magnifying glass.

As for holding down X, i'll try that next time I restart. But, being
that this is an old world mac, I dunno if that'll work. It's worth a
shot though.

Thanks for all the suggestions!

*This is going OFF TOPIC. And it also is a subject about which I
consider myself both objective AND ticked off. You have been warned:

Norton Disk Doctor proved to be DANGEROUS to Mac OS X, so bad that
Symantec themselves pulled it from the market, a stunning event.

AND I strongly urge anyone using Symantec's Norton Anti-Virus to toss
it in the trash as well. It has had a consistent history of bugs on
Mac OS X and continues to today. I have an excellent friend who tried
to use the latest version on his Mac server and found it did nothing
but wreak havoc. He returned it to the vendor for a refund. You will
find lots of stories of its problems at MacFixIt.

Just to be an outright justified bigot:
I can't see any reason to use anything by Symantec on the Macintosh.
Why:

1) They have been one of the prime FUD mongers about Mac OS X
security, apparently to try to sell their lousy and completely
unnecessary anti-virus. (FUD = Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. It is a
marketing strategy used by the truly diabolical and desperate). Go
grab ClamXav or its implementation in Tiger Cache Cleaner (which I
prefer) if you need a basic anti-virus program to clean up the mess
of Windows malware you may collect.

2) Symantec have been one of the prime critics of Macintosh for well
over a decade and a half. Their attitude has been entirely out of hand.

3) They have bought up brilliant Macintosh software products that
were their competition, then completely squashed them. They have
never integrated any of the technology they purchased into their own
products. This is pure predatory behavior with Macintosh users the
losers.

4) They are famous for putting out experimental products then
abandoning them. Example: Their Java programming suite for Mac. It
had two generations then plain old disappeared.

And if anyone from Symantec is reading this: Bite me.

Back to my nice normal self...

Share and Enjoy,

My Wallsteet has 10.4.8 and 9.2.2 on different partitions. From
reading the previous two posts, I'm assuming it's still safe to use
Norton's with OS9, or would it be better to banish it totally. (Sorry
it's O/T, but it's relevant to fixing any similar Wallstreet problems
that may occur to me).

Banish Norton's -- do not use ANY OS 9 utility programs on a HD which has
OS X on it, because you'll lose the OS X &quot;metadata&quot; which also ends up on
the OS 9 partition because OS X is working with it. Get Onyx and iDefrag
for your maintenance needs. Even if you had two HDs (one for OS 9, the
other for X), you shouldn't use the 9 utilities anymore, not even on the
9 drive. This was my situation when I got my Quicksilver and added my old
Beige's OS 9 HD to it.

This is still OFF TOPIC except I do mention RAM in the last sentence:

The only safe application that runs in Mac OS 9 that you can apply to
a Mac OS X volume is DiskWarrior v2.1.1. I believe Alsoft still
include it on all their current disk images and disks of DiskWarrior.
I still use it on occasion when I have to. When I can I use version 3
on my 10.3.x volumes and version 4 on my 10.4.x volumes. The new
version 4 is excellent with the added ability to do file repair, but
it only runs on 10.4.x +.

Don't use any version of TechTool Pro from MOS 9 on MOSX. (Actually,
there are a couple things you can do safely with it, but the thing
will destroy your files if you let it, so unless you know what you
are doing, just skip it).

The very last version of Disk First Aid on MOS9 is safe to use with
Mac OS X. But you might as well use FSCK in Single User Mode or add
even more functionality by using AppleJack, which also runs in Single
User Mode. Highly recommended. It now includes the ability to test
your RAM via Memtest and is still totally FREE.

A technique pioneered by IBM.

IBM, so give them a break ... they're only copying the very best.

Sorry for my late reply -- I was out of state all weekend.

I use my Norton disk in this one circumstance, and that is about all.
I will probably continue to do so whenever this specific circumstance
arises, because it works.

OTOH, I have in the past also successfully used Norton on my
Wallstreet (10.2.8) when it had problems that DiskWarrior could not
fix. So, I may use it on other problems in the future -- but most
likely only on my Wallstreet, not on any newer machines!
