OK, this is going to separate the men from the boys....

Stupid question.... how would you explain the difference between eastern NC and western NC BBQ?

And which one is better?

Now let the BBQ sauce fly.

This may not be completely accurate.
ENC= whole hog cooked over hardwood coals, vinegar sauce.
WNC=shoulders cooked over hardwood coals, red sauce.

Big Jim, the way it was explained to me (and I'm from NC, a long time ago)
was that in W NC, they add ketchup to the vinegar sauce.  Makes it red.  ;-)

No flying sauce- it's just a matter of opinion, where you grew up and
acquired taste.  If one type was so bad, nobody'd eat it. &lt;grin&gt;:

Both Carolina varieties are slow cooked and smoked.  The difference is
in the sauce.  Our ENC sauce is typically apple cider vinegar with Texas
Pete or other pepper sauce mixed in.
Different variations can include more salt, garlic and cayenne peppers.
My own table has a bottle of 75% vinegar, 25% Texas Pete poured over
cayenne peppers, and I just refresh it when it gets a bit low.  My son
is an ECU graduate and they had pig pits on campus for feasts.  Trust
me, the ECU crowd knows good food.

The western NC, or Lexington version is a thin tomato-type sauce.  It's
OK, but is about the last on my list.  I had a neighbor from Blowing
Rock who claimed that he was producing barbecue when he put about 1-1/2
dozen baby back racks in a big pot, poured in the Lexington-type tomato
sauce and cooked them until the bones almost fell out on their own.  I
was as polite as could be, but when I got home I got out some pulled
pork and had a little snack.  There's no good or bad; it's all a matter
of what you grew up with and now prefer.

Don't overlook the KC style, with the sweeter, spicier
tomato/honey-molasses/garlic/mustard/worcestershire/etc. style sauce.  I
personally consider KC Masterpiece, Hunts and Bullseye to represent
reasonable variations of that.  My guess is that more KC style is served
nationwide than the others, but who knows.

Somewhere between Kansas and NV, there's a group that likes a mustard
&quot;barbecue&quot; sauce.  I've tried it many times and can only say that it's
an acquired taste.  I had it at Danny Gaulden's in Carlsbad and that was
the best version of it I've had.

Texas in particular includes brisket in the category of barbecue.  IMHO,
barbecue needs pork, but when I'm in Austin I have to admit that I've
had some pretty good brisket.  Sausages or hot links are also popular
there as well.  If you ever eat at County Line, I suggest just getting a
hot link appetizer and sauce, then using the loaf of bread to make
sandwiches.  Yum.  My son and his family live in Austin and I believe he
has a permanent bench at Rudy's and a Mexican place called Chuey's.

I also have developed a real taste for the dry Memphis rub on ribs.
Personally, I do my ribs low and slow with a dry rub on them, and serve
them with a few different sauces on the side.  My tastes might again
change, bur right now, I don't sauce my ribs at all.  I just do them in
the smoker and chow down.

Well, it's time to go.  Happy Hour approaches PLUS I have a big
Tupperware of pulled pork ready to warm up.  The hot dog buns are fresh
and I even have a jar of sweet slaw to put on the sandwiches.

BTW, a true East Carolina barbecue fanatic would cuss me for using hot
dog buns, but IMHO the hold up better to the vinegar sauce and juicy
slaw than do the round Wonder buns that are so traditional.

My sincerest apologies to all yew BBQers.

Don't mistake Guv BoB as the black sheep of the BoB fambly, that's my

though he is a politician.  Now you know what kind of scoundrels reside over
