I am inagreement with one writer on this group. Seeing all these posts
to Earnest is boring and time consuming. The man is consistently
telling all of us that we are off topic and shouldn't be on this
group, that he alone sees angels, he alone has a pure heart, pure
enough it would seem to have sexual realtions with angels, and pure
enough to see angels on every street corner. Now usually this is
called schizophrenia. But because none of us is a doctor we aren't
allowed to use that word. I am going to lay off of Mark for awhile
because he just keeps telling the same, sad, stupid story over and
over again. Angels with swords, angels in his truck, Poseidon in the
men's shelter, right. yeah. Whatever. It's BORING because in the end
it leads the reader nowhere. It can't heal you, can't make you morally
more virtuous or a better lover to read Mark's words. He brings no new
information about the state of our Spirits. It's all just gobbledy
gook. the rest of you can prance around his maypole for awhile. But
Jeez! Rrock's constant long tirades about how Mark is wrong and Mark
is a liar and Mark is this and that are only echoes of what's been
said a million times here. He isn't making a dent in Mark's armor. I
really wish someone would be on topic here for a change. Even me!
Sheesh, crazy people always take center stage around this joint. Mark
Earnest is a dead issue. To me he is a crazyman who got that way from
doing bad things to kids. He deserves to live out his life in his own
immoral and unjust fantasies. I only hope no children become involved
with his hype.

I pledge:

No more static over Mark.
No more abuse towards any other writer here.
No more answering any other writer's abusive missives.
Only On Topic writing from here on out.

just more bait. It remains to be seen. And your preamble makes it sound
like you are jealous of Mark and would like to be the crazy person that
takes center stage. The group is not a stage, there isn't any center,
you still aren't using a spell checker, and you didn't even bother
or have the common decency to state the name of the person to whom you
are in agreement.

sorry, i don't buy it. Your definition of &quot;awhile&quot; changes too often
from half a second to a full minute for anyone to take it seriously.
And what's the point of making such a post anyhow? If you are going to
do something, just do it. Is there some sort of compensation you expect
in advance?

Just letting folks know I am tired of the game you and the rest of
this group plays. It's not a fun game. And it's not a very
intellectual game. &quot;Tease the Madman&quot; is, as Art said, not something
most of us would do in real life, in our garages for instance. But
oddly he goes ahead and does it himself two minutes after he said we
were all creeps for doing it ourselves. I think he mentioned 158 posts
about or to Mark. I wonder if he would be so kind as to count his
posts to me over the years...I think I have been center stage in this
group for a longer period of time than Mark Earnest ever was. And if I
am also crazy, then you are all just being abusive to a crazy man. And
so it goes. On and on and on...Even when I post I am going to quit,
you can't quit. You can't quit riding Mark or me. And I wasn't even
addressing my missive to you! Whatever, dude. Take good care.

Jealous? Moi? LOL! I would have to be crazy to be jealous of a poor,
addled mad man.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;enough it would seem to have sexual realtions with angels, and pure
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;enough to see angels on every street corner. Now usually this is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;called schizophrenia. But because none of us is a doctor we aren't
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;allowed to use that word. I am going to lay off of Mark for awhile

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;it leads the reader nowhere. It can't heal you, can't make you morally
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;more virtuous or a better lover to read Mark's words. He brings no new

&gt; &gt; &gt; I am just telling you how to get to the ones that know all of this about the

&gt; &gt; Fuck you, Mark. You don't own me, i'm not your nigger, and you're

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Sheesh, crazy people always take center stage around this joint. Mark

&gt;&gt;And your preamble makes it sound
&gt;&gt;like you are jealous of Mark and would like to be the crazy person that
&gt;&gt;takes center stage.

&gt; That's what it sounds like to you.

&gt;&gt;The group is not a stage, there isn't any center,
&gt;&gt;you still aren't using a spell checker, and you didn't even bother
&gt;&gt;or have the common decency to state the name of the person to whom you
&gt;&gt;are in agreement.

&gt; Is this some sort of court of law where I have to name names? Am I
&gt; outside the laws of decency? Am I also offending you by not using a
&gt; spell chacker? Sorry. But it's too much of a hassle. If you can read
&gt; Art or Mark or Allan without editing them then you can read me.

&gt; The group is a stage. In fact all the world's a stage and all the
&gt; people merely players. A famous person who shall go unnamed, said
&gt; that.

&gt;&gt;sorry, i don't buy it. Your definition of &quot;awhile&quot; changes too often
&gt;&gt;from half a second to a full minute for anyone to take it seriously.
&gt;&gt;And what's the point of making such a post anyhow?

&gt; Because I wanted to make such a post. That's my perogative. Are you
&gt; against Freedom of Speech?

&gt;&gt;If you are going to
&gt;&gt;do something, just do it. Is there some sort of compensation you expect
&gt;&gt;in advance?

&gt; Just letting folks know I am tired of the game you and the rest of
&gt; this group plays. It's not a fun game. And it's not a very
&gt; intellectual game. &quot;Tease the Madman&quot; is, as Art said, not something
&gt; most of us would do in real life, in our garages for instance. But
&gt; oddly he goes ahead and does it himself two minutes after he said we
&gt; were all creeps for doing it ourselves. I think he mentioned 158 posts
&gt; about or to Mark. I wonder if he would be so kind as to count his
&gt; posts to me over the years...I think I have been center stage in this
&gt; group for a longer period of time than Mark Earnest ever was. And if I
&gt; am also crazy, then you are all just being abusive to a crazy man. And
&gt; so it goes. On and on and on...Even when I post I am going to quit,
&gt; you can't quit. You can't quit riding Mark or me. And I wasn't even
&gt; addressing my missive to you! Whatever, dude. Take good care.

&gt; Jealous? Moi? LOL! I would have to be crazy to be jealous of a poor,

Seeing as you responded to the name albanS your first statement is a lie.
Since you haven't the controlling shares of stock in all of the Internet

St. Albans was dead before you were ever born, albanS, so your
first statement is true, and you haven't enough information to truthfully
claim your second statement, so it's a lie. St. Albans was dead
long before i was ever born as well, so i couldn't have forced him,
or even tried to force him to give me anything. So, your third
statement is, (*yawn*) again, a lie. Your fourth statement is
quite absurd and either self-contradictory since your reply indicates
that i am &quot;talking&quot; to you, and therefore you exist, or demonstrates
that you are insane and actually believe that you do not exist. The
former is more probable, and statistically speaking since you lie
so often, it is much easier to believe you are a liar than insane.
However, as Art has pointed out on occasion, you might just be insane
and not a liar.

About your question:

My current problem has to do with the following, even though i haven't
the slightest clue why you are interested and am positively certain
you cannot work it through yourself or be helpful in any manner:

movdqu xmm0,q
movq xmm1,p
psubd xmm1,xmm0
movsd xmm0,xmm1
pslldq xmm1,8
pcmpgtd xmm0,xmm1
pshufd xmm1,xmm0,0x0E
pand xmm0,xmm1
movss xmm1,xmm0
psrldq xmm0,4
pand xmm0,xmm1
psrld xmm0,31
movd eax,xmm0

Although you can't be helpful in any way, shape or form, i believe
that my honest answer to your question might help you in some way
since you asked. Even though you haven't ever been grateful for my
giving you honest answers to any of your trivial questions in the
past, the karmic reaction is still quite positive for my effort.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

St. Albans is dead, albanS, but i must agree it would be exceedingly
difficult for even one person *in* this *newsgroup* to ever produce
&quot;on&quot; piece of logic. The statement makes it much easier to believe
Art about your insanity since only someone insane would consider
a piece of logic as something they could produce on.

Regarding your attempt at logic in the second statement, though, since
St. Albans is dead, he cannot ever be in this group, nor can he act
in any way whatsoever. Again, i'll overlook the fact that this again
gives quite a bit of credence to Art's hypothesis that you are insane
rather than a liar, but you must admit that you do make it quite difficult
to treat as a sane person rather than the simple common liar that you are.

Your obsession with people lying to you is amusing. I wonder why it

we lie to you to protect you from information that would otherwise
disabuse your preconceived notions that the universe revolves around

So your problem is that I am named after a dead saint and you keep

exist. There was a man named Rock once twho thosand years ago. He was

My name is David T. St. Albans.  But you are right, I am not going to
be forced by you or anyone else to do anything. So you might as well
kepp your hands off the keyboard when you see MY name. Go ahead, just
try...I didn't think so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So, your third
&gt; statement is, (*yawn*) again, a lie.

You continually yawn in your discourses. You must be bored with your
own continuous and useless repetitions of contrived and nonsensical
words, which you repeat over and over again to yourself for your own
amusment. The word lie, invoked so many times in a statement becomes
almost meaningless under your twisted obsessive abuse of American
English. What you think is a lie is often parallel to what Mark thinks
is an angel. Each one does not exist, except in your heads.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your fourth statement is
&gt; quite absurd and either self-contradictory since your reply indicates
&gt; that i am &quot;talking&quot; to you,

Please. I really don't need a editor or critic from some internet
peanut gallery telling me what I did or did not say. According to you
I don't exist. There is no albanS and there is no St. Albans. So you
are talking to a ghost. In Mark's world that is a no-no. Why don't you
go fuck yourself with a snow shovel or other tool, as you ask so many
others to do these days? There's a good fellow.

At this juncture you simply ceased to make any sense. I am guessing
you think you are being clever asking coded questions, which you think
your &quot;adversary&quot; cannot possibly answer. So then you say he will not
answer it or will not answer it truthfully and prejudicially close
your case with your usual self satisfied smugness. For a person who is
not a member of any group of Literati, or even a published author of
any note, neither a doctor of letters or medicine or philosophy, you
seem to have a high opinion of yourself. Well good for you. I call
that hubris. And karma, if it exists, falls heavily on the shoulders
of those who bloat themselves up into something they are not. Show me
some indcation that you've had a book or paper published somewhere
that would indicate to me or this group that you are an &quot;expert&quot; in
anything... It could be cheese production, for all that matters, and
I'll take what you say into consideration. otherwise, be at peace in
the firm knowledge you have that your hand reaches with good
flexibility around your fat head to pat yourself on the back time and
time again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;There is no one named albanS on this group. Please cease posting to me
&gt;&gt;&gt;as you and I have nothing to speak about.

&gt;&gt;Seeing as you responded to the name albanS

&gt; I did not respond to the name 'albanS&quot; I simply informed you that no
&gt; such person on this group exists.

Starting out a post with a blatant lie is certainly no way to
capture the reader's attention.

Fact: The post was written to albanS.
Fact: You replied to it as the recipient.
Fact: Your statement is a lie.

I'm sure you had something else to say, but frankly, it is the
author of a post's responsibility to capture the interest of the
reader, and the reader hasn't any obligation to endure material
that begins by an inept demonstration of logic, reason, or is
simply lies and bullshit.

Try again sometime when you have the ability to distinguish
between fact and fallacy. Thanks, oh and by the way, thanks.

&gt; Secondarily you keep posting to my
&gt; original posts, which means you are posting to me, David St. Albans.
&gt; Not someone named albanS. Therefore no one has &quot;lied&quot; here except you,
&gt; you fabricated someone named albanS and keep trying to post to him.
&gt; And you keep trying to post to me. So please cease posting to either
&gt; one. One does not exist and you and I have little or nothing to
&gt; discuss with me.

&gt;&gt;your first statement is a lie.

&gt; Your obsession with people lying to you is amusing. I wonder why it
&gt; matters to you so much? You are not a person of any prestige or
&gt; authority that should be demanding the whole truth from people. Maybe
&gt; we lie to you to protect you from information that would otherwise
&gt; disabuse your preconceived notions that the universe revolves around
&gt; you. That is what we adults do FOR children. Little white lies, so we
&gt; don't discomfit you.But since you keep insisting there is an albanS on
&gt; this group who keeps lying to you, I insist you are mentally ill.

&gt;&gt;Since you haven't the controlling shares of stock in all of the Internet
&gt;&gt;Service Providers, you haven't the authority to tell me whom to post to,
&gt;&gt;when to do so, how, why, in what group, or what i can or cannot say. Your
&gt;&gt;request is denied.

&gt; I asked you politely to stop posting to me. If you cannot be polite,
&gt; so be it. I will simply ignore your further flames.

&gt;&gt;What exactly is your problem?

&gt;&gt;St. Albans was dead before you were ever born, albanS,

&gt; So your problem is that I am named after a dead saint and you keep
&gt; wanting to have this verbal conversation with a person who does not
&gt; exist. There was a man named Rock once twho thosand years ago. He was
&gt; called Peter in Greek. He died before you were born, therefore your
&gt; name cannot be Rock. That is the strange logic you use on others.
&gt; Apparently names cannot be passed down on your planet. So instead of
&gt; being Rock, you must be a liar.

&gt;&gt;so your
&gt;&gt;first statement is true, and you haven't enough information to truthfully
&gt;&gt;claim your second statement, so it's a lie.

&gt; Your capacity of performing ill-conceived pseudo-logical functions and
&gt; turning them into irrelevant dross has preceeded you. Whomever you
&gt; are. Believe me, your logical fallacies are a form of trash talking on
&gt; this NG which was not started by you, nor will it end with you. You
&gt; are just another sojourner in the world of the illogical extremist.
&gt; Keep yakking away and you will wind up sounding very much like Mr.
&gt; Earnest.

&gt;&gt;St. Albans was dead
&gt;&gt;long before i was ever born as well, so i couldn't have forced him,
&gt;&gt;or even tried to force him to give me anything.

&gt; My name is David T. St. Albans.  But you are right, I am not going to
&gt; be forced by you or anyone else to do anything. So you might as well
