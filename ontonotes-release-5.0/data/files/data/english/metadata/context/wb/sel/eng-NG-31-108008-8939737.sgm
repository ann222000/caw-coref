&quot;like wine&quot; to top up a WinExpert Corvina Classico

Hi, all.

I am making a WinExpert Corvina Classico di Veneto kit. This is a new
grape and taste to me, but found the marketing hype too good to pass up.
smile.

I normally &quot;top up&quot; with like wine on kits rather than water and have
never had a problem. So I normally buy 1-5 bottles of the same type wine
when I need to top up after stabilizing.

My question is: does anyone know what a like wine is for Corvina? Or is
this also commercially available? My googling didn't find a simple
answer. Maybe I'll hit my wine store next - but don't want to buy $30
bottles of wine to &quot;top up&quot;.

thanks for any thoughts. DAve

DAve,

Corvina is the main grape in Amarone (it may also be used a bit in
Valpolicella, I think).  With prices at about $40 and up for Amarone,
I agree that using it to top up a kit wine would be silly.  I know of
one wine, Corte Gardoni Becco Rosso, that is 100% Corvina, not an
Amarone.  It is about $15 - $20 but, in my opinion, also way too good
for using as top up wine.  You might consider using a Valpolicella,
also from the Veneto, but I think you're still in the $15 - $30 price
range.  This probably isn't the answer you wanted.

I was thinking the exact same thing; using bottles in general for
topping is just not going to be cost effective unless it's 2 buck
Chuck (which is no longer 2 bucks).  I would ether rack this into
smaller carboys if I wanted to keep it the same or I would get a nice
box of Australian box wine.  That way you can top without any issues.
If you start with at least 5.5 to 6 gallons and use a 5 gallon carboy
you should have enough left to never need the other topping wine.

After I rack I always settle the lees in a fridge overnight and rack
that to another container.  As long as it's over 750 ml it will last
at least 6 months to a year.

Basic Valpolicella should be cheaper than $15-30 I'd think, no? I'd go
with that.

RD, I think it's the same grapes for both Amarone and Valpolicella
(Corvina, Rondinella and Molinara), only the winemaking process is
different.

I think you're right, Pp.  I could not remember if all three grapes
went into both wines at the time of my reply.  I guess I've come to
like some of the ripasso Valpolicellas that seem to be $15 or more.

Dave, my corvino chrushendo kit is six months in the bottle, and
doesnt taste like anything I would buy, my price range is around ten
bucks.

I can only say much the same...I wouldnt personally top up with wine
that cost more than that, even for the corvino, which is my most
expensive kit by an astronomically long measure. At six months I took
a bottle down....very VERY fruity, great complex taste and long lush
finish

Good luck

Sorry Sean, just to clarify, are you saying the kit tastes much
*better* than $10 commercial wine?

sorry....clarity is not my strong suit......if you topped this wine
up, and wanted to use something that tasted similar, you would have to
use a wine from at least the $ 10 and up price range. A range I cant
afford to drink, let alone use for top-up.

none of the wines in my price range, $10 and below, taste anything
like as good as the corvino kit does at 6 months.

Wow, what great response. thanks! This all is great input. This really
helps. After more googling, it appears this is close to a Merlot?
Well, I will take your advice, this is good.. thanks.

p.s. it's time to rack and stablize and top up. thanks for all the input.

You could consider another option.  I saw one &quot;topping off&quot; solution; adding
sterile glass marbles to the carboy.  You maintain the integrity of your
wine and the marbles are reusable.  Just another thought.
