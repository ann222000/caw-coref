10 new uses for olive oil!

1. Shine stainless steel. Many cleaning standbys, such as ammonia, can dull
and even corrode chrome or stainless steel. Olive oil, however, is a safe
and effective shining agent.

2. Dust wooden furniture. Apply a bit of oil to a cloth, and wipe.

3. Prevent wax from sticking to a candle holder. Rub a thin coat on the base
of the holder before inserting the candle. Dripped wax should peel away
easily.

4. Silence squeaky doors. Lubricate hinges by applying a small amount to a
cloth, then wiping the top of the hinges so that the oil runs down the sides

5. Moisturize cuticles. Apply a small amount of olive oil to your nail beds.

6. Remove eye makeup. Dab a little under the eyes, and rinse off with a
washcloth.

7. Condition your hair. Warm 1/2 cup olive oil, and liberally apply it to
your hair. Cover your hair with a plastic grocery bag, then wrap it in a
towel. Let it set for 45 minutes, then shampoo and thoroughly rinse.

8. Shave. Olive oil not only makes it easier for the blade to glide over
your face or legs, but it moisturizes your skin as well.

9. Unstick a zipper. Using a cotton swab, apply a drop to lubricate the
teeth. (Avoid touching the fabric.) The zipper should move up and down
freely.

10. Recondition an old baseball glove. Just work the oil into the dry areas
of your mitt with a soft cloth, let it set for 30 minutes, then wipe off any
excess.
