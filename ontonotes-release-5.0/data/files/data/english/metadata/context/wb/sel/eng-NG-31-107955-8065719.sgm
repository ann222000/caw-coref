Lady, I don't know what's knotting your knickers, but if it's something
I did (or didn't) let me know and I'll try to smooth it over.

hey Angie,

I did a little birding yesterday afternoon at my local airport.  I had
seen several pairs of Painted Buntings there earlier in the season and
was very pleased to find females with quite a few young.  The &quot;birding
world&quot; seems to think that the number of PBs has declined greatly in
SC so it was good to see evidence of the next generation doing well.

While I was there I heard a Yellow-breasted Chat singing (scolding)
from some thick bushes.  I did everything I knew to get it to pop out
for a look but no luck.  To get closer to the bushes I would of had to
wade through some tall grass and I have had enough run-ins with
chiggers and fire ants this year to keep me out of the grass!
Maybe, if the sun comes out this afternoon, I will spray really good
with deed and try again.

Oh Mary Ann, you lucky ducky! I want to see a Painted Bunting soooo
badly! I just KNOW someday one is gonna make its way to my feeders and
pose for a picture for me:)

I haven't had too many run ins with fireants yet, but then again, I've
been laid up with a bad knee so I haven't been out nearly as much as
usual. We've had tons of rain and the Texas sized skeeter are out in
full force though..I think they are becoming immune to Deet, because
even when I spray every inch of my body, I STILL manage to get eat up!

Angie, when I was a kid and trooped around in the woods with other kids
and campers, I used a folk remedy that worked for me and doesn't seem to
have done me any harm. My secret was a Domino Dot with two drops of
turpentine (from an eye dropper) soaked into it. I took one before
setting out and brought another with me in case one wasn't enough. It
flavors the sweat in a way that mosquitoes and black flies don't like
(at least as long as there's a substitute meal available nearby). Check
with your doctor before trying it.

Back a long time ago in the last century, when I developed a really
bad cough, my Grandmother would give me a teaspoon of sugar with coal
oil on it.  It didn't kill me and believe me it cured that cough!  In
fact, I would hold it back until my ear drums burst rather than have
to take another dose of that!  ;-)

Hi all back from the road trip, tired, lots of photos, LOTS of miles.

Tammie did you have a heat wave in Ontario JUST for ME? Sheesh
To my fellow road warriors if you ever get the chance to travel US-64
from Cleveland, TN to Henderson, NC do it. It is an absolutely
gorgeous drive. There is one spot on the road where you can drive
UNDER a Waterfall. (Bridal Veil Falls) just a terrific route.

And Don Leons Deli in Highlands, NC has the BEST Reuben Sandwiches on

on a wood stove all her life and one of the things coal oil was used
for was to soak a corn cob in it and use that to start the fire in the

Coal oil is very similar to kerosene. Rather than being distilled from
crude oil, it is obtained from cannel coal, a kind of oil shale, by
destructive distillation.

In New York City, the milkman, the junk man, and the ice man used
horse-drawn wagons. The whole first floor of Schaeffer brewery was
stable and wagon garage. Trucks replaced those horses in the late 40s.

I spent a few early summers at a boarding farm. It was a working farm --
I learned to milk a cow at age 5 -- and took in guests for the summer.
There was no electricity (common in rural areas before WW II) and
running water was carried by wagon from the spring and pumped to the
cistern in the attic using the tractor's power take off*. Cooking, of
course, was on a big wood stove, for guests and hands alike. The
cook-wife-lady-of-the-house kept a supply of dried corn in a box in the
kitchen. She would add one or two to the fire when heat was needed in a
hurry to save a sagging cake. There's a lot of calories in those kernels!

most of the hauling. I thought I was driving the team when I rode the
hay wagon through the fields, but I'm sure now that the horses knew the
way on their own. The tractor operated the capstan to hoist the hay from
the wagon into the barn loft.

Good on ya Jerry, I am a long way from geezer hood but have had my
share of childhood memories. Step Dad was Native American from Canada,
I lived for a few years on a Reservation near Montreal, PQ. Water was
from a pitcher pump two houses down for the first year of house
building my Step dad and his father were doing. Ice Man came by every
few days in summer for the Ice Box, as did the Milk Man and Bread Man
daily. And Rest Room Facilities were a Two Holer out back of the
lot.....fun in mid winter since my Step Grandmother would NOT permit a
chamber Pot in the house! I went to First Grade at the Catholic
Mission School on the reservation, the only non First Nations student
there. Took my fair share of lumps but managed to make a place for
myself. Washing Machine was in an indoor porch, wringer washer if
anyone remembers them, clothes lines were on a pulley to the top of a
30' pole at the back of the yard with the end INSIDE the washer room.
You could hang and pick the laundry from inside the house even in
winter. Heat for the house was a wood burning Kitchen Stove and a Pot
Belly Stove in the hall way. LOTS of Blankets let me tell ya because
the heat did NOT travel down the hallway to the bedrooms very
efficiently.

Always Tea Water ready and a pot of soup on the stove. Would I want to
live like that now, not hardly, but it sure makes for some neat
memories.

&quot;Washing Machine was in an indoor porch, wringer washer if

I remember my family having one of those when I was about 5....I also
remember the day I got my hand stuck in the wringer. Ouch!
And right along side the washer was the old ceramic crock filled with brine
and cucumbers.

I was sitting on my deck listening to the bugs (?) that make all that noise
that tells us what a hot day it is going to be and thinking of waking up to
that noise when a kid and how safe I felt. (no AC then and the windows were
open) .

After reading Jerry's memories I was trying to remember if our iceman had a
horse? I do not believe he did. The junkman with his cow bells and the milk
man also had trucks. This was early 1940's in Teaneck, NJ.

There was no iceman in The Bronx where I lived. but in Manhattan,
serving the tenements between Columbus and Amsterdam, the ice wagon was
horse drawn. The milkman in my neighborhood used a horse and wagon, and
the horse knew the route. Once, a kid tried to climb onto the wagon
while the milkman was making deliveries, so the horse just kept walking.
He went around the (very looong) block and came back to the perplexed

Do you mean under the ice box? We had a fridge in the city, but used ice
in the country during the summer. We had no drip pan, rather a hose that
went through a hole in the floor.

&gt;&gt; After reading Jerry's memories I was trying to remember if our iceman had a
&gt;&gt; horse? I do not believe he did. The junkman with his cow bells and the milk
&gt;&gt; man also had trucks. This was early 1940's in Teaneck, NJ.

&gt; There was no iceman in The Bronx where I lived. but in Manhattan,
&gt; serving the tenements between Columbus and Amsterdam, the ice wagon was
&gt; horse drawn. The milkman in my neighborhood used a horse and wagon, and
&gt; the horse knew the route. Once, a kid tried to climb onto the wagon
&gt; while the milkman was making deliveries, so the horse just kept walking.
&gt; He went around the (very looong) block and came back to the perplexed
&gt; milkman who had by then begun to search frantically.

LOL! a prelude to car jacking, no doubt. What a laugh if we could program our
cars to come home.

I think the area covered by our iceman, milkman, garbage man, coal man,
junkman who was also the knife sharpener, etc. was too large for horse drawn
vehicles.  Teaneck was 7 square miles in size and pretty much all built up
with one family houses on 50-100  x 100 lots.

How about that radio ad for I. J. Fox?

Maybe someone should start a memory lane NG.

What about radio's first singing commercial:

Pepsi Cola hits the spot,
Twelve full ounces*, that's a lot.
Twice as much for a nickel, too.
Pepsi Cola is the drink for you!

Tune picked out and transcribed on urgent request. It's a chore for me.

I actually still have one of those!  Well, it's not a working one these
days...the pots are all gone, and it's been converted into a plant stand,
but it's still recognizable as an old cream separator.  I get lots of people
asking what it is, and even after I tell them, they still don't have a clue!

Was That really the first?  But you left off the end -- nickel nickel
nickel nickel nickel ... (don't remember how many).

And I was going to say &quot;Well, it's to the tune of ... Pepsi Cola hits

No, but many of my friends did. I went to Walden, a small private school
in Manhattan (on scholarship). We've had annual reunions since 1990 (the
40th), but the ranks are thinning out. We started with 30 in the class.
Now about half or so attend.

&gt;&gt; One of my early memories is waking up in the night to my Father
&gt;&gt; shouting &quot;Oh God, the drip pan!!&quot;  ;-)

&gt;Do you mean under the ice box? We had a fridge in the city, but used ice
&gt;in the country during the summer. We had no drip pan, rather a hose that
&gt;went through a hole in the floor.

Yes, under the ice box!

You're thinking of Apollo. Before that was Gemini, and before that,

Sadly I was far too young to hear Shepard (a local boy and hero), but I
remember listening to the first lunar orbit and vowing to be the first &quot;lady
astronaut&quot; by the time of Apollo.
