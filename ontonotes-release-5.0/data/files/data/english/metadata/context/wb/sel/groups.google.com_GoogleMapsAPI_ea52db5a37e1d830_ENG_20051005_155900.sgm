Bad addresses

Why do some addresses when submitted to Google Maps such as - 57567
trtgf st, Washington, DC - return &quot;nothing found&quot; while others such as
- 205 MCLEAN PL, SEVERNA PARK, MD 21146 - return nothing at all?

The returning nothing is screwing up a project I am working on. To see
what is happening go to
and click on number
AA5276094. You get the error message.

When addresses cannot be found the normal way as seen here -
, I
can work with it and the properly display a &quot;sorry, can't find this&quot;
type message on the map tab of my project.

If this makes sense to anyway, bless you. Otherwise any help at all
would be appreciated. I can post some code up later if needed. Thanks.

Mike,

The big question I have off the bat is how you are interfacing with
Google to get the coordinates for your map. I suspect that if you are
using some sort of automated means, you are getting bad results because
their system has detected your robot.

The bottom line here is that you can't use Google's geocoder to do your
maps. You have to get that information somewhere else. There's a free,
fairly useful site named geocoder.us that does this. There are others
available too.

Ah ok. I was using a VBscript that someone posted on this group that
uses Google to do the geocoding. I will attempt to switch it over to
another method and see how that goes.

Mike,

I should have mentioned that using Google for geocoding is specifically
against their TOS. I'm glad you're seeking alternatives.

Before the API was released, I attempted to use their service to
geocode a number of addresses. What happened to me is after I did about
15 or 20, their program started to return bogus points or the same
point over and over (I think it was Palo Alto). They may have altered
the behavior to do something like what you experienced.

&gt;From your first response I gathered that it must be against their TOS.

But the one good thing about using the Google hack method was that it
was fast.

Using geocoder.us seems to have added a couple seconds to my page load
time when I try to geocode multiple address within a few seconds of
each other. I will have to do some rearranging of code. Blah.
Although error handling within my page is now much easier.

Thanks for the help.

Mike,

You can always build your own geocoder. It's quite easy and doesn't
take a brain surgeon to figure it out. There are a bunch of people on
this board (me included) that have constructed the db file from scratch
and some even offer it for download via bit torrent. If you have access
to the backend of your server and can install modules, then you have
everything you need to do it yourself.

Check out geocoder.us's site for the specifics on how to do this.

geocoder.us has a time delay on requests. If you go to mapki.com and
look up Geocoding in the FAQ ro the Knowledgebase (I cant remember)
there is a service out there now with free geocoding up to 200 addresses
at a time, and its looking like they are using the more accurate data
now, so it gives good results. You'll know what I am talking about when
you read it.

Building my own geocoder sounds exciting, but that will have to wait
for now. I switched over to Ontok's geocoding service (that I think
you are talking about Will) for now and it does well.

Hello John,
Hope you are keeping well. I am looking into building my own GIS db
for geocoding and reverse geocoding (inverse geocoding).
I have a few questions for you (time permitting, I know you are
busy):

1) &quot; There are a bunch of people on

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; this board (me included) that have constructed the db file from scratch
&gt; and some even offer it for download via bit torrent.&quot;

"/>

Can you send me the torrent file?

2) I am most probably going to be using POSTGIS (Postgres) for building
things. Have you ever heard of anyone succesfully build a geocoder +
inverse geocoder succesfully?
3)do you recommend a specific db (besides postgres)?

Much thanks in advance.

Assad,

I haven't finished the reverse geocoder using postgreSQL yet, as I have
too much paying work to be doing &quot;fun&quot; stuff, but I don't see any
reason it can't be done technically. The Tiger/Line database has
polygons for every &quot;block&quot; in the country, so if a database was built
of those polygons, indexed and then queried via the internal spatial
functions, it should return a block the point is located. Figuring out
exactly where inside that block the point is would be trivial at that
point. Using a non-spatially enabled database would make it a lot
trickier.

I don't have a bit torrent for geocoder.db but there are those who do.
I suggest you start a topic on this board asking for it and see who
pipes up.

As far as a specific db, I would always recommend postgreSQL or postGIS
as they seem to me to work the best, have excellent command line tools,
are rock solid and are easy to install and maintain.

-John
