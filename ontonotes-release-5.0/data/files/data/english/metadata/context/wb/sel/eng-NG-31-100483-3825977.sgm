97 deville - engines dies at low RPMs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<POST>
<POSTER> Hello </POSTER>
<POSTDATE> 2005-01-19T23:14:00 </POSTDATE>
The problem is that the engine dies while idling at low RPMs like 600-650. Engine just cuts off on stop lights or whatever when I the car is standing still. It doesn't do it all the time or right a way, still very frequently. I am able to restart right away. If I let it idle for some time, it dies like in 10 mins or at times even much sooner after engine heats up and lowers its RPMs to 600+ range.

I am not sure if it is an electrical problem since radio continues to play and dash lights are on and everything but I guess I can't know exactly. On the other hand, I don't think it is the fuel delivery problem because I am able to restart the engine with no problems at the first turn of the key when it dies. If there was some fuel "gap" then I think it would take me longer to start the car again. Similarly, I don't think it is air flow problem since I took off the air tube housing off and it died while it was getting air directly to the air nozzle in the engine block, I had my hood up while it was idling. Battery is 1 year old and it reads 12.2V when engine off, should it read higher?

Could it be that bad fuel can't give enough power to propel engine at low RPMs?

Any comments, please, I will take anything.  :)

Sounds like maybe a low fuel pressure problem. Could be a clogged fuel
filter, easy and cheap to replace. $30 Or it could be a fuel pump that is
getting tired and needs replacing. Not easy and not cheap. Several hundred
$'s

Anybody agree?

Sorry, hit wrong key.

Your car has an Onboard Diagnostic program that you can learn to access
and then find any trouble codes.

You might go to Google, type in 97 DeVille OBD.  The access process
should be displayed in one of the returns, and also the trouble code
explanations.

It would probably be much faster to have a mechanic read the trouble
codes for you and proceed from there.

Our fuel pump is like a year old. We replaced it last summer when we had to
tow the car since it wouldn't start. I spent like $900 at the dealer that
time.

Any info how I can change the fuel pump myself? Where would it be? Under the
hood or near tank? Any pics?
I would want to try the fuel filter first before handing over more cash.

First thing I would do is clean the throttle body. Take off the air
horn and wedge the linkage open with something. Spray both sides of
the throttle plates and the bores with carb cleaner. Brush with an old
toothbrush, NO metal brushes. Spray to rinse. Repeat if needed.
Doesn't have to be immaculate just reasonably clean. If your TB is
like my '93 4.9 you will see two tubes when you look down the throttle
body. They should be open and clear. If not, rod them out with a piece
of coat hanger wire or the like. Again, not immaculate just mostly
open.
See if that helps. It can't hurt.

Most Cadillac fuel filters are under the car, on the drivers side, mounted
in/on the frame rail.
Since it's a messy job unless you have ramps and safety stands, why not take
it to one
of the 10 minute oil change type places? They will replace it for about $30.

The fuel pump is inside the gas tank. I would change the fuel filter and see
if that solves the
problem. If it doesn't then you may have to take it in to the dealer and
have them check fuel
line pressure and if it is the pump, and you had it done a year ago AND HAVE
YOUR RECEIPT,
it should be under warranty.

If I am all wet, and it's something else, at least they will check it out,
could just be an adjustment.
Having a ride that you can't depend on and have to hold your breath at each
stoplight is not worth it.

Anybody else have more ideas?

Speaking very generally, not particularly of Devilles -- spark plugs might
be the root of a problem.

Checking the onboard diagnostic(OBD) system for any failure codes is the
first thing to do. OBD systems installed since 1996 are pretty thorough.
Unfortunately they are not capable of detecting 100% of the all electrical
failures (particularily intermittent ones) but this is the first place to
check.

I had a problem with a 2000 Pontiac (different car and different engine) but
it was very similiar to that you described.  The engine would shut down
without warning at low rpms but could always be restarted immediately.
Sometimes it would shut down several times in one day and at other times it
would go a week or more without occurring.  OBD never set a code for this
problem so isolating the culprit was very difficult.  The problem turned out
to be an intermittent failure in the crankshaft position sensor.  Even
though OBD continuously checks the performance of the crankshaft position
sensor, it never detected this failure.  The car has performed perfectly
since replacing the sensor about 8 months ago.  This may not be your problem
but it's something to keep in mind if you are unable to localize the problem
using techniques suggested by others.

Good luck with the resolution of your problem.

I've experienced the same phenomenon with my 90 DeVille.  Cleaning the
throttle body fixed the problem.
