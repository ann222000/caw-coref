Aeons ago, 93,000,000 miles from the Sun, two forming nuclei of
gas
and dust began to differentiate into distinct spheres. As these two
planetary bodies solidified and separated, the body with the greater
mass and gravity (Earth), stripped and therefore deprived the smaller
body of its atmosphere and ability to nurture and sustain life (Moon).
As the Moon moved further from its counterpart Earth in their shared
and dual orbit, its chances to ever recoup this life giving nurturance
disappeared.

Like the child's unconscious, the Moon retains the trauma and
impact
of this deprivation in the form of unconscious overcompensation. Its
dispersonalized potential for development remains in the limbo state.
It reflects the reigning psychological need to nurture as the effect of

deprived participation in nurturing (Please see Needs Volume 5,
Principles and Practice of Astrology, Noel Tyl, and his more than 20
texts on astrology/psychology).

In life on Earth this nurturance and deprivation is provided by
the
parental structure. Physically and therefore most notably, the mother.
The sign and house placement of the Moon in the horoscope is where we
will find this sense of nurturance deprivation belief as the effect of
maternal interaction.  This archetype (sign and house placement of the
Moon) then establishes for the astrologer the reigning psychological
need of the personality. The aspects tie in and bring other planets as
parameters of fulfillment of this reigning need. All factors within the

horoscope, including the Sun, work to fill this deprivation void. The
identity then finds emotional security through the fulfillment of these

needs, which continues with the parameters rising to higher and higher
levels. Where Saturn is we are satur-ated with the archetype involved.
Where the Moon is we need to absorb and nurture the archetype. Deprive
means to "remove or withhold something from the enjoyment or possession

of". Where the moon is we feel deprived, the archetype which we believe

our mother failed to nurture us with. This corresponds to The response
deprivation theory of reinforcement proposed by William Timberlake and
James Allison (1974: Timberlake 1980) in psychology. That behavior
becomes reinforcing when the organism is prevented from engaging in it.

The more empowered an individual believes themselves to be, the
less
negative will be the expression of the reigning need. Self-empowerment
being defined as the ability to create whatever is desired by the
identity without having to act out of integrity. It is the fulfillment
of the reigning needs that allows the nurturing of the perceived
Archetype deprivation. The Moon serves the Sun and acts as a filter
through which the Sun sign is distributed. This distribution finds
fulfillment and support through sextiles and trines, because they
reflect the positive aspects of belief maintained by the identity. The
need to resolve aspects of other archetypes (other planets and signs)
is brought into developmental need fulfillment and resolution through
the squares and oppositions because these are the areas of negative or
dis-empowering beliefs maintained by the identity. Tension as well as
resolution are required for growth. This is why we teach best what we
are learning.

The following definitions indicate an individuals overcompensatory
reigning need in response to perceived maternal deprivation.

Fire Moon signs (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius) reflect the need for
energetic ego recognition and a fear of being ignored; Earth:
functional and practical efficiency and adequacy, with a fear of losing

control; Air: social acceptance and a fear of being unappreciated; and
Water emotion (energy- motion) and a fear of being taken advantage of.
There is no such thing as "just feeling" a certain way, a feeling is a
reaction to a belief. We must believe a certain way before we have a
feeling about it. A fear therefore is a belief. We create our reality
by what we believe. Fearing something will happen, heightens the
probability that it will, until trust replaces the fear. Understanding
the self leads us to this trust.
Cardinal sign moons (Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn) believe
action
and assertion has been deprived. Fixed (Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius)

believe structure and accumulation (some form of power) has. And
Mutable (Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, Pisces) believe that they have
been deprived of change and learning.

With the moon in Aries the reigning need is to be ego important
and
first. To nurture the pioneering sense. To trust natural aggression.
Bette Davis, Marlon Brando, Jaqueline Onassis.

The moon in Taurus' reigning need is to build and maintain a structure.

To nurture stability and accumulate security.
Bill Clinton, Shakespeare, Mick Jagger.

In Gemini to be thought of as diverse, knowledgeable and intelligent,
as an effect of diversity deprivation.
Farrah Fawcette, Sigmund Freud, Fred Astair.

In Cancer the reigning need is for emotional security itself. This may
be the sign of adoption or the loss of the mother at an early age, or
in some other way she was exceedingly important in the identity's
development.
Dr. Benjamin Spock, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ross Perot.

The Leo moon has a reigning need to be dramatically ego important. The
performance of the identity is believed to have been ignored.
Peter Ustinov, Barbara Streisand, Mahatma Gandhi.

Virgo-To be correct and proper on a less aware level, or to be
analytically correct through discernment on a more expanded level, is
the reigning need of this moon. Or correct in practical terms.
John F. Kennedy, Joseph Stalin, Oprah Winfrey.

Libra-Social acceptance is the reigning need of the moon in Libra.
Appreciation through popularity. There can be a superficial focus on
the acceptability of behavior.
Sylvester Stallone, Billy Joel, Katherine Hepburn.

Scorpio-A strong need for emotional significance can lead to obsessive
behavior or strong devotion. The fear of being taken advantage of is
strong in this sign.
Harry Truman, Elizabeth Taylor, Julie Andrews.

Sagittarius-To have the beliefs, opinions, intellect and ideas accepted

by others is the way this moon seeks ego importance. The identity's
fears of being ignored may be too close to the opinions it holds.
Pablo Picasso, Albert Einstein, Johannes Brahms.

Capricorn-Strategic effectiveness, and an impact on the world and
physical reality, is believed to have been denied. Overcompensation
ensues in this direction as the reigning need. This position is usually

associated with some early environmental limitation that deprived the
identity from full expression.
Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Adolf Hitler.

Aquarius-Needs are fulfilled through being recognized for ones unique
attributes and contribution to society. Needs appreciation for helping
humanity or being a good friend.
Richard Wagner, Richard Nixon, Marilyn Monroe.

Picses-The reigning need of this moon is to be recognized as
compassionate, sensitive, and self-sacrificing. The concept that was
believed taken advantage of was the sensitivity to self.
Martin Luther King, O.J. Simpson, Benjamin Franklin.

The following examples definitely reveal the individual's reigning
needs. The first is a male born June 18, 1942, 2:38 am 002w55, 53n25.
The element count shows relative balance except for a low count in
water (2 points for Sun/Moon 1 point for all other planets). There may
be an inclination to take things too personally, and with the Aries
ascendent and Mars/Pluto/Moon conjunction, a bit pushy. However, Venus
in Taurus is in its natural house and sign. This would tend to social
grace and passivity (as well as material prosperity). All the planets
are below the horizon and there are no oppositions. There would be a
push to externalize the self , first to empathize with others (water
reference), and second because there is great self worth and social
insecurity reflected by the Moon in five (love given) square Venus in
two (self worth, and Venus rules the seventh, social acceptance).
Saturn conjunct Uranus in two also reflects upon the worth profile (the

fear that uniqueness in diversity will not be recognized).
The reigning need Moon in Leo is to be dramatically ego important.
Performance is part of that need. The Moon is in five (the natural Leo
house) conjunct Pluto (personal perspective) and Mars (the need to
prove the identity's validity, rules the first) and is the ruler of the

fourth and fifth houses (the early environment, the mother, and the
fifth is creative extension just like Leo!). The Sun (life energy and
dispositor of the Leo planets), Mercury (the way he needs to think),
Saturn (fears to overcome), and Uranus (individuality recognition) are
all in Gemini. The Sun is square Neptune, developmental tension with
the life energy to communicate (Gemini and third house) and the
artistic or musical (Neptune) is brought into the stellium in Leo and
five back to the reigning need through the Sun's dispositorship of the
Leo planets. The way this is resolved is through the two twelfth house
rulers (Uranus and Neptune) trine from two (worth) to six (work). This
person must create, express and perform. Saturn rules ten and is in
two.  The greatest fear is not being appreciated for the intelligence.
Writing could be the career. Self worth is fulfilled through giving
love and creations, a romantic. The mother had a powerful effect on
this life direction and is the primary emotional link (Jupiter in
Cancer exalted on the fourth house cusp). Creating fulfills an
emotional void. This is the horoscope of one of the most prolific and
consistently popular singer/songwriters in history, Paul McCartney.
Pluto is associated with generational consciousness, its conjunction
with this reigning need allowed him to fulfill it while connecting with

a generational perspective to
