The main protagonists are all 17 years and younger if I understand
correctly.
Yet, they all sloshed back a fair amount of wine and firewhiskey (which I
always imagine as being stronger than regular whiskey).
I know she lives in Scotland now, but are we absolutely certain JKR isn't
part Irish?

Remember
In the Wizarding world you come of age at 17..

Just because the western world uses 21 as the drinking age now
does NOT mean that is proper for everyone.

OPINION:
I grew-up when the &quot;drinking&quot; age was 18, only the US feds forced
the 21 age on the state did it change..
At that time, there was a draft, and it was opinion, that if you
could be called up to fight for your country at 18, you should be able
to lift a beer.

In this book they are in HBP drinking Butterbeer as well.  At 15/16.
come on, just talking about teens including those YOUNGER than them in
OOTP sitting around and ordering 25 Butterbeers.  At that time they
are 16 max (I really think Harry wasn't quite 16 as it wasn't summer
yet and he was still in school).  Worse yet is younger students like
Creevy there drinking it too.... and they are probably 14-15.  when is
it too young?  Sorry, that's too young.  What was Jo thinking!

That's only in America. There's more to the western world than just the US
;-)
In the UK, the age is 18.
I would imagine it's maybe lower in places like France, Spain and Italy
where they have a very strong wine culture.

I might be mistaken, but I have always thought &quot;butterbeer&quot; was a
non-alcholic drink.  It just has the word &quot;beer&quot; in it like Root Beer, which

have to go back and get the passage, but as someone put it, it has an

She makes it clear in Wizard Culture that the age of majority is 17.
That isn't necessarily the same as the drinking age, but it is the
only age she dwells on for adult &quot;priviliges&quot;.  But, yeah, she
certainly isn't discouraging underage drinking.  She's made butterbeer
sufficintly ambiguous, and she conveniently made Harry's 17th birthday

By my memory, butterbeer is intoxicating to elves, not to humans.

That said, I took note when I read HBP, In each of the first three
chapters, and more, one wizard or another was conjuring up some
alcoholic beverage. (from memory, alcohol appears in Prime Minister's
office, Snape's apartment, and the Dursley's living room.)

The way you speak, in the USA then it is completely illegal to drink
when &quot;underage&quot;?

In the UK you can drink in a pub at 18 (at 16 if you are having food)
but at home there is no age limit. Therefore, as HP is set in the UK,
drinking alcohol at the wedding or at the school or where ever, is
perfectly legal and may I add, acceptable. We just don't have the same
hang ups about booze in Europe that you find in the USA and you have to
read HP in that context.

Speaking about ONLY the US,  the drinking age is 21. the only exceptions
that I can think of, are the  use of wine in religious services.
and this is normaly no more than a thimble full.

Even alcohol use in the home is illegal for under 21. with or without
parential approval
anyone giving alcohol to a minor is subject to the law if found out.

But isn't there an age limit for *buying* alcohol in the UK?  Harry and Co.
bought butterbeers in the Three Broomsticks as early as PoA or GoF, IIRC.

On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be a notably large amount of
alcohol in it, either; Winky is small, and the &quot;warmth&quot; the humans feel when
drinking it could be attributed to a magical ingredient.  After all, if
butterbeer contained no magical ingredients, wouldn't some wizard have made
a fortune selling the recipe to Muggles by now?  (I know, it's a fictional
universe...)

Can any of our European readers attest to the frequency of alcohol-related
crimes and injuries as compared to the U.S.?  It seems that a lot of U.S.
high school and college students find such an appeal in drinking mostly
because it's illegal; it would then follow that Europeans in the same age
group would see it as no big deal, and that there would be less driving
under the influence, incidences of alcohol poisonings, etc.

In any *civilized* part of the world, you can drink a toast to a fallen

&gt;&gt; it too young?  Sorry, that's too young.  What was Jo thinking!

&gt;I might be mistaken, but I have always thought &quot;butterbeer&quot; was a
&gt;non-alcholic drink.  It just has the word &quot;beer&quot; in it like Root Beer, which
&gt;is non-alcoholic.
">

Root beer in its original form was very weakly alcoholic; I believe that
the same is true of butterbeer.  I think house-elves can get drunk on it,
but for all we know, butter may be a mood-altering substance for their
metabolism.  (The little folk could be bribed with milk, as I recall.)

More importantly, Europe has public transportation, and European people

Ireland out of college, and described how everyone in a small town would

the USA, the zoning and liquor laws have been set up to deliberately
prevent bars (we don't have pubs) from being within walking distance of
homes.

&gt; Yep, it's illegal to purchase or consume alcohol until you're 21.

&gt; &gt; In the UK you can drink in a pub at 18 (at 16 if you are having food) but
&gt; &gt; at home there is no age limit. Therefore, as HP is set in the UK, drinking
&gt; &gt; alcohol at the wedding or at the school or where ever, is perfectly legal
&gt; &gt; and may I add, acceptable.

&gt; But isn't there an age limit for *buying* alcohol in the UK?

Yes, 18.

Which, I assume, confirms that it is non-alcoholic, or very very very

In the UK we have a major &quot;binge drinking&quot; problem with the young ones
who go out and get totally rat-arsed and then misbehave but I think that
this has more to do with them just having too much money than anything
else. Because houses are so expensive now, children are not leaving home
and instead of buying or renting that house, they spend it &quot;enjoying
themselves&quot; and this includes expensive cars and too much booze.

Drink-driving is extremely socially unacceptable here and traditionally
it is an older person's crime. Personally I am not aware of it being a
particular issue with youngsters.

Jury finds parents guilty for allowing drinking party
( http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/478484,party072207.article )

July 21, 2007

BY DAN ROZEK Staff Reporter/dro ... @suntimes.com

WAUKEGAN--A jury has just found Jeffrey and Sara Hutsell, guilty of three of
the four charges they faced for allowing their teenage son to host an
underage drinking party in the basement of their Deerfield home that led to
two fatalities.

The Hutsells were found guilty of using the residence to serve minors,
endangering the life of a minor and attempting to obstruct justice by
misleading investigators.

Two 18-year old boys who were at the party died October 13, 2006 when their
car crashed into a tree at the end of the Hutsell driveway.

The jury of seven women and five men deliberated for seven hours before
coming back with the verdict.

The jury, at Lake County Circuit Court began deliberations shortly after 1
p.m. Saturday, after more than three hours of closing arguments.

Prosecutor Ari Fisz told them that the Hutsells had created an environment
in their home that condoned underage drinking. &quot;This is a case about the
disturbing lack of parental responsibility,&quot; said Fisz.

&quot;These defendants want you to believe they had no idea what was going on in
the basement, despite the fact that they were one staircase away the entire
night.&quot;

The Hutsell's defense attorney countered these claims by telling the jury
that their clients didn't know the teens were drinking.

Before deliberations, the jury was told that prior to the October 2006
incident, Jonathan Tyler Hutsell, the Hutsell's son, had been arrested twice
for underage drinking.

The Hutsell parents told jurors Friday that they had no reason to suspect
that approximately 20 teens would be drinking alcoholic beverages in their
basement recreation room last Oct. 13 when Tyler, 19, hosted a reunion party
after a Deerfield High School homecoming football game.

Two 18-year-olds were killed returning to the party -- Danny Bell, 18, of
Bannockburn and Ross Trace, 18, of Riverwoods -- when Bell's Volkswagen
Jetta crashed into a tree at the end of the Hutsells' driveway. Bell's blood
alcohol level was .08, and several teens testified that he was sober when he
arrived at the party.

The Hutsell parents said they were watching a baseball game on a TV in the
main-floor family room, by an open stairwell that led to the basement.

&quot;The kids seemed like they were behaving,&quot; Jeffrey Hutsell said, adding that
he did not notice any odor of alcohol until walking downstairs with
Deerfield police three hours after the party. &quot;I smelled stale beer.&quot;

Asked if he gave his son consent to have an underage drinking party, Hutsell
said, &quot;I would never do that.&quot;

Prosecutor Ari Fisz pushed a rattling evidence cart full of empty beer cans
and bottles and two large rum and whiskey bottles across the courtroom in
front of the witness stand, and asked, &quot;Were the kids drinking in your home
that night?&quot;

Jeffrey Hutsell responded, &quot;It appears they were.&quot;

Sara Hutsell said, &quot;We discovered, after the fact, there apparently was
(drinking).&quot;

Jeffrey said they did not monitor the teens entering and leaving through the
garage via a side stairwell.

The Hutsells were praised by David Heil, senior pastor of First Presbyterian
Church of Deerfield, and Thomas Cunningham, the church's director of
Christian education, for their leadership and participation in church
activities. Both said the Hutsells have reputations in the church community
as &quot;very peaceful and law-abiding.&quot;

Prosecutor Christen Bishop asked Heil if he had been at the Oct. 13 party,
and he replied &quot;no.&quot;

Despite the court charges, Cunningham said the Hutsells' reputation &quot;hasn't
changed&quot; and parents approved Sara Hutsell being a chaperone for a youth
mission trip.

Defense attorneys Robert Gevirtz and Elliot Pinsel have chipped away at the
charges. There has been no testimony as to who is responsible for bringing
the beer and booze to the basement. Several teens testified that they
removed empty beer cans and liquor bottles from the basement.

Testimony has indicated that Tyler Hutsell was at the home and generally
available to police for interviews throughout the late-night hours.

Michael Youngman, 19, of Deerfield told jurors that about half of the teens
were drinking, beer or hard liquor; he was not.

Timothy Welch, 19, of Deerfield, said he saw beer cans in the basement, but
didn't see either Hutsell parent come downstairs during the hour he was at
the party, and not drinking.

The Deerfield couple failed as parents and broke the law by turning a &quot;blind
eye&quot; to teens drinking at their home in the hours before a drunk-driving
crash killed two young partygoers, Lake County prosecutors said.

The Hutsells should have more closely supervised the gathering, especially
since their son, Tyler, had been ticketed twice by Deerfield police in the
preceding nine months for underage drinking, prosecutors said during their
closing arguments in the case.

&quot;Parents have a duty not to enable teenagers to break the law,&quot; Lake County
Assistant State's Attorney Christen Bishop said. &quot;There's a duty to be
vigilant, not to turn a blind eye.&quot;

Bishop and co-counsel Fisz contend the Hutsells never took action to stop
teenagers from drinking in their home, even though the couple sat upstairs
watching TV and reading during the party. Later, the couple allegedly tried
to hide beer cans, plastic cups and other evidence of drinking - and told
police their son hadn't been present during the last hour or so of the
party.

&quot;They made a series of horrible decisions,&quot; Fisz said of the Hutsells, who
sat stone-faced in the Waukegan courtroom as prosecutors ripped the actions
they took last October. &quot;Two boys lost their lives. This case clearly is
about a disturbing lack of parental responsibility.&quot;

Defense attorneys contended the Hutsells didn't know the teens were drinking
at their home, though they acknowledged that 53-year-old Jeffrey Hutsell
visited the basement - or at least walked partway down the stairs to that
level - three times during the course of the evening.

Hutsell and his wife, also 53, both testified they didn't see any signs of
alcohol use before the deadly, 11:30 p.m. car crash.

Several teens, however, testified Jeffrey Hutsell came downstairs at least
once when they were openly drinking from beer cans. Some young people also
testified there was a strong smell of alcohol present when Hutsell was in
the basement.

Defense attorney Robert Gevirtz ripped prosecutors for granting immunity to
three teens who testified that the drinking was widespread in the basement,
noting all three young people admitted they had been drinking that day.

He insisted there was no evidence the Hutsells tried to hide evidence from
police, nor did they intend to minimize Tyler's role presence at the
gathering.

Calling the Hutsells &quot;decent, innocent people,&quot; Gevirtz argued they
shouldn't be held responsible for the teens downing alcohol in their home.

&quot;The kids made their own decisions. Those kids made the decision to drink,&quot;
he said.

In this state, if a parent buys the drink, (s)he can then pass it to a
minor child (of which they have custody), legally, regardless of the
child's age.  Darn bad law, given that I have seen people give beer to 3
or 4 year olds, just to see them stagger around.

&gt;&gt; It may be you are correct; my only problem is the mind's of teens.
&gt;&gt; They LOOK for excuses to do what they want to do. I feel it's our duty
&gt;&gt; as adults not to give them reasons to go out and do it.

&gt; The way you speak, in the USA then it is completely illegal to drink
&gt; when &quot;underage&quot;?

&gt; In the UK you can drink in a pub at 18 (at 16 if you are having food)
&gt; but at home there is no age limit. Therefore, as HP is set in the UK,
&gt; drinking alcohol at the wedding or at the school or where ever, is
&gt; perfectly legal and may I add, acceptable. We just don't have the same

Not everywhere.  And, while it might be construed as 'contributing to

I would like to see a formal statistical correlation between &quot;wine cultures&quot;

Interesting; when my father gave beer to (I think) 5 year olds, it was so

The moral of the story is, don't let your kids taste *good* beer until

&gt; &gt; In the UK you can drink in a pub at 18 (at 16 if you are having food)

&gt; &gt; drinking alcohol at the wedding or at the school or where ever, is
&gt; &gt; perfectly legal and may I add, acceptable. We just don't have the same

I'd be interested to know what your point is in publishing this?

For example, do you think this occurred because of, or inspite of, the
ban of alcohol for the under 21s?

Would it have happened in the UK? No, I don't think it would because
drink would have been freely available, and no one would have been too
concerned at this, but everyone would have left their cars (if they had
one at the young age - we can not drive until 17 and do not learn at
school so most that young don't) at home.

As others have pointed out 21 is the US age.  Western Europe tends to
be lower (and places like Iran and Saudi Arabia ban it completely).

I took a look at the WHO 2004 report
http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_status_report_...

per capita
USA - 8.51 litres
UK - 10.39 litres

However the UK has a 12% abstainer rate and the USA has 33.9%
abstainer rate (among adults) which means the per capita per drinker
will be different from the above.  Unfortunately the heavy drinker
stats use different definitions of heavy drinking for the UK and the
US (the UK comes out worst if you ignore the definitional difference).
Alcohol dependence is 4.7% in the UK and 7.7% in the USA but the
definitions are again different.

Plenty of more grist at the report.

Emma

&gt;&gt; yet and he was still in school).  Worse yet is younger students like
&gt;&gt; Creevy there drinking it too.... and they are probably 14-15.  when is
&gt;&gt; it too young?  Sorry, that's too young.  What was Jo thinking!

&gt; I might be mistaken, but I have always thought &quot;butterbeer&quot; was a
&gt; non-alcholic drink.  It just has the word &quot;beer&quot; in it like Root Beer, which
&gt; is non-alcoholic.

It's alcoholic, but only likely to get house elves
drunk.

&gt;&gt; &gt;That isn't necessarily the same as the drinking age, but it is the

&gt;&gt; &gt;certainly isn't discouraging underage drinking.  She's made butterbeer

&gt;&gt; It may be you are correct; my only problem is the mind's of teens.
&gt;&gt; They LOOK for excuses to do what they want to do. I feel it's our duty
&gt;&gt; as adults not to give them reasons to go out and do it.

&gt; The way you speak, in the USA then it is completely illegal to drink
&gt; when &quot;underage&quot;?

&gt; In the UK you can drink in a pub at 18 (at 16 if you are having food)

There does appear to be some concerted effort to impose
US attitues (and even laws) towards alcohol. (e.g. the

Actually there is an age limit, it's 5. With an exemption

The other piece of context is that age restrictions on

&gt; Jury finds parents guilty for allowing drinking party

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt; Two 18-year-olds were killed returning to the party -- Danny Bell, 18, of
&gt; Bannockburn and Ross Trace, 18, of Riverwoods -- when Bell's Volkswagen
&gt; Jetta crashed into a tree at the end of the Hutsells' driveway. Bell's blood
&gt; alcohol level was .08, and several teens testified that he was sober when he

The way this would be looked at in the UK would be that an (adult)
drunk driver killed himself and a passenger. IMHO rather than
wasting public money prosecuting third parties it would make
more sense to nominate both dead men for a Darwin Award. (Though
they might fail on lack of creativity).
If you drive when you are drunk you are a fool, if you get into
a car where the driver is drunk you are also a fool. If you crash
a car into a tree it will probably do more damage to the car than
the tree, even if it's not a womping willow!

&gt;&gt; Can any of our European readers attest to the frequency of alcohol-related

&gt; More importantly, Europe has public transportation, and European people

Yes, I always wondered why, if drinking and driving was illegal, bars
all have parking lots....  Then there are the liquor stores with
drive-thrus....  Makes little sense.
Noted in Austria that while people enjoyed their drinks, public
intoxication was NOT well tolerated.
