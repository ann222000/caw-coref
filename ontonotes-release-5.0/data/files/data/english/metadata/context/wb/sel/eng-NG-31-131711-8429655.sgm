Today I heard on the radio a Helb Alpert recording for the first time in
many years.  Playing along with the vinyl in 6-8 grade helped my playing
develop greatly.  Sure glad I expanded my tastes shortly after to Kenton,
Rich etc.

Anyway, I was wondering, how does one describe Alpert's sound?  Compact?  It
seems there are no overtones -also the sound just stops--no echo, resonance.
Still, the notes were solid and in tune.  Most of his stuff was short
staccato notes.  Nothing with a line over it.  What terms are used to
describe a sound like his?  (and for all you wise guys out there-remember
the post a week back from someone for now swearing ;).

Try listening to &quot;The Lonely Bull&quot; and see if your opinion changes.

I consider Alpert's sound to be very controlled--commercial, if you
will.  The older recording methods probably did not allow his tone to
be fully realized,  I do recall he played on a toilet bowl of a
mouthpiece, though.

I suppose some might describe it as unsupported.  Supposedly he played
in marching bands in his early days - both in the Army and in college.
Hard to imagine him mustering enough gusto.

It's definitely unique if not pyrotechnic. The wimpiness essentially
gives his sound its particular flavor. Though he's not my favorite to
listen to - and that odd extreme downstream embouchure is hard to
watch -  I guess his sound fits the material he plays. I liked the
sound of the TJB though their sound was mostly dependent on the very
strong players he hired.  My sense is he's a stronger musician overall
than he is a trumpet player.  Obviously a brilliant businessman.

I would agree with much, if not all, of this assesment of Alpert the
trumpet player. I'm old enough to
remember hearing his stuff over the radio when he was enjoying great
popularity. Nothing he did really
lit my fire, though. Never bought a single recording of his music. To
my, then, 15 year old ears it just
sounded like so much fluff without the beef. Alpert's music had much
the same effect on me then as smoothy
&quot;jazz&quot; has for me today. Simply put, it borted me.

If anything, maybe to fully appreciate Herb Alpert, one had to live
during the sixties. To many, Alpert and the TJB's music represented
something nice during a very angry and hostile era because of the Viet
Nam War. Even now when I hear Alpert, he brings back memories of
groups and people like Brazil '66 (Alpert's wife Lani Hall was one of
the vocalists), Dusty Springfield, as well as all the James Bond and
Pink Panther movies. These made life a lot more hopeful and sane
during a time when the United States was on the ropes. I wonder who
and what will represent sanity during our current era of being on the
ropes big time. It's so difficult to describe what life was like in
the sixties. One would have to live during that time to experience any
impact.

While Alpert's playing style might be lackluster in comparison to
today's trumpet players, he surely was a decent player and played
trumpet 'being himself' where he made his mark. Not familiar with the
mouthpiece he plays on (Does that really make any difference?), but he
tooted on a Benge.

I was never a TJB fan; although they were quite hot on the pop charts in
their day. Part of it was slick marketing; not the least of it were his
looks. He was being groomed for Hollywood- amazingly it never happened.
I started appreciating him more in the 80's. I enjoyed, &quot;Fandango.&quot; Still,
not my favorite cup of tea; however his musicianship had improved. Don't
forget- not every one who buys trumpet albums are trumpet players.

I dunno about &quot;groomed for Hollywood,&quot; but Albert is an incredible
musician, composer, producer, and businessman. Don't forget, he wrote
all his hits; in '66, his albums held the number 1 and 2 slots (over
the Beatles at 3 and 4) for a month, and Albert, in '66, had four
albums in the top ten (which no one has matched), and five in the top
20 (which put him in the Guinness Book o' Records). He even had major
hits as a vocalist; &quot;This Guy's In Love With You&quot; was a number 1
single &amp; album in '68. It even has a very pretty, dark trumpet solo.
Listen to the glissandos and quarter-tones... listen how much is
packed into about eight bars.

The guy has sold something like 72 million records; that's gotta be
more than even Mickey.

As a composer and producer, Albert had hits with Jan &amp; Dean and others
dating back to '58, long before the Tijuana Brass formed. A&amp;M was
among the most innovative of the major labels, and Albert started it
all in a garage. The guy is so much bigger than &quot;just&quot; his trumpet
playing that he deserves fair consideration.

I like his playing. And I admit, early stuff like &quot;Lonely Bull&quot; and
&quot;Mexican Shuffle,&quot; that I heard as a little kid, turned me on to the
trumpet. Even though I can name a dozen players I like a little better
as players, there's hardly a dozen people in the music industry who've
done what Albert has.

I'm not too keen on his paintings, though.  ;-)

When I was in junior high and first satrting to play, my band teacher was
*very* into the TJB (and this about 35 miles from TJ).  Being out in the
sticks (which is now wall-to-wall walls), the little musical influence we
had was primarily from music teachers, and from the (almost entirely C&amp;W)
bands that played at the local bar.

So Alpert was a major influence.  But when Chicago hit the scene it made a
*big* splash, and was the major horn influence in town for a few years.
Being friends with the guys from Tower of Power only gained me strange
looks, as that was *way* too hip for the people in a town that considered
&quot;Colour my world&quot; daring.  :)

I think it may have been something he had aspirations toward. Before
he was famous, he made an appearance in the movie &quot;Mr Hobbs Takes A
Vacation&quot; as the trumpet-playing bandleader, though any playing - all
in the background as I recall - was obviously overdubbed, he never
played horn like that in his life. He was primarily there to be
pretty. I think there's even a line that someone says about &quot;what a
handsome young man&quot; or something to that effect.

If anything held him back from an acting career, I'm sure it was his
voice. Like his horn playing, his voice is somewhat timid.  &quot;This
Guy's In Love With You&quot; is a nice song, but Alpert's vocal on it
doesn't do a thing for me. The guy is no singer.

Then again, I can't stand listening to Burt Bacharach sing his own
songs either. Amazing how someone so gifted in one area musically can
be so ungifted in another.

Btw, so besides Chet Baker and Herb Alpert,  who else is in the
&quot;people known as professional trumpet players whose playing was
overdubbed in a movie&quot; club?

Perhaps Ray Anthony, I'm not sure, but he was a famous trumpet player whose
celebrity may have eclipsed his playing. In some photos he really did look a
lot like Cary Grant, and of course, was married to Mamie Van Doren. I can't
find enough material of his to really hang my hat on. What i've heard has
been less than inspirational.

I did hear Alpert live back in the mid 60s as a young kid.  The TJB came to
the civic center in Birmingham.  Live concerts were just becoming active
there and many folks did not understand the concert venue.  Anyway, Brazil
66 opened for Alpert.  After 3 or so charts the crowd started getting
ancy -we had never heard of an opener or warm up band. People began thinking
he had cancelled and sent someone else to fill in.  Alpert finally started
and it was a good show.

He had a nice brassy sound though I've never heard him do anything on
the horn that really made me think of him as any kind of heavyweight
technically. I don't think he had anything like Harry James'
facility.  His band was pretty popular at one time, I think he had a
few hits back when, such as the Peter Gunn theme.

I seem to recall he was also well-known for slapping around a wife or
two.

&gt;I did hear Alpert live back in the mid 60s as a young kid.  The TJB came to
&gt;the civic center in Birmingham.  Live concerts were just becoming active
&gt;there and many folks did not understand the concert venue.  Anyway, Brazil
&gt;66 opened for Alpert.  After 3 or so charts the crowd started getting
&gt;ancy -we had never heard of an opener or warm up band. People began
&gt;thinking he had cancelled and sent someone else to fill in.  Alpert finally
&gt;started and it was a good show.

I'll bet the Brazil '66 portion of the show was better than the TJB portion.
I never saw a live performance by TJB but I did see one by Brazil '66 in
1968 and they were phenomenal.

Your story reminds me of a time when I saw a live performance by Blood,
Sweat &amp; Tears in 1970. They were playing some of their &quot;hits&quot;, but were also
playing a lot of jazz. Most of the audience was made up of teenagers who
only knew of the rock and roll side of BS&amp;T. During one song which was a
jazz tune one of the BS&amp;T members was playing an improvised solo. The
teenagers were apparently bored with it and were walking around and talking
all over the auditorium. The band stopped and one of the members got on the
microphone and told the audience that if they didn't shut up and sit down,
the band was leaving. Everybody sat down and shut up and the concert went
on. Lew Soloff even played a solo on his mouthpiece without benefit of his
trumpet attached!

In case you were being anything but descriptive,  thought I'd point
out that this would be an impossibility physics-wise. If there were no
overtones, it wouldn't sound like a trumpet. Even a wimpy trumpet.

Let's not forget that it was Herb Alpert that patronized Carmen Caruso.
