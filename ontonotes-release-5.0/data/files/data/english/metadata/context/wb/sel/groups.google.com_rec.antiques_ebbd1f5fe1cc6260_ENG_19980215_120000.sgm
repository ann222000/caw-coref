We have a beautiful Roseville Lamp in the jonquil pattern, that no matter
what the outcome we will continue to enjoy but would like to know
something. I was once told that the only true lamps which were made by
Roseville had a molded drill hole and ours is just cut....so therefore is
ours not an original? If you saw the mounting and the light fixture and
shade it would be hard to imagine that this is a made up piece. I was also
told that sometimes they did make the lamps by just cutting a hole into the
bottom. Any one know anything about them?
Thanks for any info!!
