I apologize for posting this one, but the topic has arisen, and recently I
had some experience in the matter so I thought that I would add my two cents
worth.  This past week, my old 98 Blazer had to spend a few days in the
shop.  As a rental, Enterprise put me into one of the new 2007 Nissan Titan
5.6 Litre V-8 club cab truck.  I have to say that my previous experience
with Nissan ergonomics is still accurate, since there was no direct way to
turn up the radio volume with the truck in gear and a bottle of water in the
console.  I had to weave my arm around all the obstacles.  One thing that I
thought to be really odd was the way the automatic transmission "manual
shift" was arranged.  The gear shift was on the column, and to activate the
manual mode, there was a push button on the end of the stalk.  To up or down
shift, there was a sliding switch on the face of the end of the stalk.  I
didn't even try this option, since it seemed very awkward.  What did bother
me about it, though, was that it gave the gear lever a very cheap, plastic
type feel, much the same as a turn signal stalk (or the wiper stalk, also in
an odd place on the column, forward of the gear lever).

The one thing I did like about the truck, though, was the power from the V8.
Geez O' Pete.  Man, I have driven the Chevy equivalent of this truck (which
does has some very good acceleration) but found the power AND responsiveness
to be leaps and bounds above the Chevrolet.  It ALMOST makes up for the
other issues I had with the vehicle.  I was just happy to get it back to
Enterprise without getting any tickets (well, I will get one for using the
EZ tag lane, since I forgot that I wasn't in the Blazer when I was on a toll
road).  Would I buy one?  Probably not.  I am not a truck person, and I
couldn't tell you what kind of performance the truck would have in a towing
situation.  That, and the front end just had a light feel to it, probably a
characteristic of the power steering.  Was it fun to drive?  Oh, yeah.

I have to wonder what kind of power the truck has though.  Gearing for
acceleration is one thing, gearing for pulling/pushing power is something
totally different.  But then, many of these trucks - especially the imports
it seems, are targeted towards the buyer who is not really interested in a
truck in the first place.

I gotta tell ya Carey, I still love my Tundra (yes, I know you
addressed the Nissan). As you have likely determined, I am a
died-in-the-wool GM guy, and recently added a 2006 crew cab 4x4
Colorado to my fleet for commuting (the smallish Atlas-class I5 gets
better MPG than the Tundra, even as a heavy crew cab), but I kept my
Tundra. It is the best tow vehicle - for my light-to-medium duty
towing needs - that I've ever owned so far as fuel mileage, comfort,
and dependability.

The only downside to the Tundra that I've found since buying it in the
fall of 1999 as a 2000 model is the 02 sensors. For whatever reason, I
have to replace at least 1 of the 2 on there at about 18 month
intervals. Could be they're too sensitive or something as IIRC, the
2000 Tundra was the first "full size" P/U sold in the US that met the
LEV (but not ULEV) standard. Could be that I put a cat-back dual
Flowmaster setup on it...Who knows? This last time, I pulled the code
off the ECU, saw it was "left bank 02", removed said sensor, blew it
out with air, reinstalled, cleared the code, and have had no more
issues with it in the couple of months it's been since that time.
Beats the heck out of a $200+ trip to Hendrick Toyota...I'll prolly do
the same this year when the right bank sensor pops a CEL-causing code
on me.

I can say that I will own this truck until 1) It up and dies, or 2) It
begins to cost me more money than I want to spend on it for upkeep. At
135k miles, neither has happened and I still love the truck. Pulls
like a decent 1500 series domestic, drives and rides like a car
(granted, it is a 2WD) and is just generally a fun truck to drive. Has
*great* acceleration to be such a small (4.7L) V8, and has yet to
complain at the tow loads I ask it to pull - of course it is equipped
with both engine oil and transmission coolers.

Like you and your Titan experience, I find the throttle response to be
superior to that of even the brand new 2007 6.0L Vortec Max variants
of the Silverado. My neighbor just took delivery of one of those, an
extended cab like my Tundra, and the Tundra "gets up and goes" much
quicker than does his new Chevy. He can tow a lot more, sure, and he
has the supposedly mileage saving DoD (displacement on demand), but it
has that typical TBI "lag" when you stomp it. The Tundra doesn't. In
fairness tho, his is also a 4x4 Z71 and also has traction control -
which he is still using. Nice features, but surely those attributes
will affect the performance. His does have tons of TQ tho, and it
feels nice once it does get wound up and going. The kicker to this is,
he just traded a 1998 Z71 in on it that had 140k miles on it that was
beginning to fall apart. My Tundra, OTOH, just now feels like it is
getting broken in good...That's just my opinion, YMMV.

The absolute *ONLY* thing that has ever made me say "Hmmm" about this
truck is the "drive by wire" system it employs. The "gas pedal" is not
physically connected to a throttle cable/linkage, it's all servo
driven. I gotta say, that's almost "too high tech" for me to trust,
but I've never had a day's problem with it. I figure if it is good
enough for F-16s, it's good enough for me. ;-) I just couldn't get rid
of the Toyota when I wanted to downsize for fuel economy, and the
argument was easy to make with the wife that the Colorado's midget bed
(61") and non-existent tow rating (4400#) were valid reasons to keep
the old workhorse in the stable for a while longer yet.

I don't really buy that argument (targeted to non-truck people) since
the ads that came out for the Tundra when it was new (2000) and the
newer Titan include the trucks towing large boats up boat ramps, and
passing domestic makes on the road towing large boats as well (and
campers, and 4 wheelers, etc). I think they are squarely targeting
"truck buyers" in this country.

The imports have also made the 4-door access/extended cabs and crew
cabs more popular than the ever were here in the US IMO. At least in
demographics beyond contractors. And certainly in the midsize-compact
sized trucks. I mean, did you ever see a crew cab 4 door S10 until the
4 door Tacoma came out? I didn't. And did we see 4 door
access/extended cabs in this country until the Tundra was introduced?
No. At best, some C/K1500 Chevys and Dodge Rams were "3 door" extended
cabs. So by that, we can legitimately deduce that not only are they
targeting truck buyers, they're setting trends in trucks that domestic
models are just now catching up with fully.

And as for power, it's all in the TQ. Unless you tow a lot daily, like
a landscaper or builder/contractor, you'll never need more than 300+/-
ft lbs to get most anything done. If you get more and don't genuinely
need it, you're spending more on gas than you should for no real
reason other than dusting off smaller trucks at stop lights and
on-ramps.

BTW:

Nissan Titan 2007: 317HP (5200rpm)/385 ft lbs TQ (3400rpm) (5.6L
"Endurance" V8) *up to 9400lb towing - Typical gear: 3.72 (certain
conditions/options will yield a 4.10 according to Nissan USA. 4x4
maybe?)

Toyota Tundra 2007: 271 HP (5400rpm)/313 ft lbs TQ (3400rpm) (4.7L
"iForce" V8) 7100lb tow rating - Typical Gear: 3.92

(the above were for 2007 crew cab 4x2 V8 models as best as could be
deciphered from their respective web sites)

/aside
The only problem with the imports, Toyota in particular, is their
pricing. When I started looking for a crew cab mid-size, I *really*
wanted to look at and get a Tacoma. But WOW, are they proud of them
basters. I got a "new" 2006 Colorado back in November that is maxxed
out (every single option available on CC 4x4 Z71 Colorados) and it was
much less than less nicely equipped "new" 2006 Tacomas still out on
the lots. To the tune of about $4k less. Ok, less HP and TQ, a
perceived step down in dependability, but still...I also just for
kicks maxed out a 2007 crew cab Tundra online to see if I just wanted
to trade up to a new Tundra, and WOW again!!! Those are on the order
of $6k more than comparably equipped 1500 Silverados, that have larger
and more powerful engines...So I got the Colorado, have a 4x4 again,
and laugh all the way to the gas station at 22+ MPG. LOL! Screw them
thirsty V8s as commuters in a day of $2.25+ for "regular" gas.
Certainly when one's commute includes no "highway" driving.

It's in the torque and in the gearing.  I don't remember what's in my 1500
but if my memory serves me at all, the 1500's come in a number of rear ends
from the low threes to the high threes (3.08 to 3.75?), and a 4.10.  Now who
in the hell would want that?

Yeah, I haven't had to worry about that.  I only put one tank of gas in the

They're definately targetted to non-truck people.  Big huge 4-door
cabs and little tiny 5-foot beds - they're aimed at people who want
an SUV, but want to look "different" and "tough".  The truck people
are all getting F150s with 8-foot beds, so they can actually haul
stuff around with the tailgate closed.

That said, I beleive I read that Toyota's planning to introduce a
long bed model, so I guess they're heading toward making a real
truck.

The 4.10 is standard with the V6.  I don't think you can get it with
the various V8 models (altho what combinations are allowed changes
from year to year).

Now, asking who in hell would want a V6 1500 is a worthy question
(my buddy has one - dealer sold it dirt cheap just to get it off
the lot, and he needed a cheap truck - but it gets the same mileage
as my V8 F150, and can't haul near as much, so it's no bargain).

I got your Lightning covered with several vehicles...LOL!

All almost kidding aside, those are nice pieces to be F-O-R-Ds, but
what kind of mileage do you get with that? I wouldn't want it for any
kind of daily commute over a few miles. That's why I went
small/mid-size for my latest commuter, and kept my Tundra for towing
and when I need a larger bed (as John alluded to, there isn't much you
can fit in a 61" bed...I am putting a roll top cover on it to use as a
trunk) The Tundra is long since paid off, and I just couldn't part
with it. They're actually pretty nice trucks over the long haul IMO.

But I do have a couple of Corvettes that have that Lightning covered.
A plain jane C6 convertible, and a blown '03 Z06 that is supposedly
putting out 525HP at the flywheel according to LPE, who installed the
supercharger for me. Of course, the Z06 has been "for sale" since I
got the new one....lol

Just out of curiosity, what is the tow rating on your Ford? I know
most of these tuner/specialty trucks usually don't have much of a tow

&gt;&gt; I don't really buy that argument (targeted to non-truck people)

&gt;They're definately targetted to non-truck people.  Big huge 4-door
&gt;cabs and little tiny 5-foot beds - they're aimed at people who want
&gt;an SUV, but want to look &quot;different&quot; and &quot;tough&quot;.  The truck people
&gt;are all getting F150s with 8-foot beds, so they can actually haul
&gt;stuff around with the tailgate closed.

I see your argument John, but you have to consider at least one thing:
We're all "rich Americans" now, and if we need to haul enough around
that a short bed can't get done, we have trailers to do the job. That
said, I've hardly ever had any issues with my Tundra's bed size. It
certainly gets everything done that I ask of it. If it can haul a 4x8
sheet of plywood in any way, it's "enough", even if you need a bungee
strap or 2 to get it done.

&gt;That said, I beleive I read that Toyota's planning to introduce a

That's bordering on offensive to me. I'd stack my Tundra up against
any domestic truck in all but power with some of the diesels and big
V8s out there in trucks intended for farming and as genuine work
trucks. As I said, even with an access (extended) cab, and the
resulting "short box", I've never had an occasion to need more bed
than I have. So I think your classification of "real truck" needs a
little modern, real-world tweaking.

Take my latest toy, a little crew cab Colorado. It's 4x4 and can go
off road, been there done that already. Is it any less "real" even
though it can go through the mud when a long box V8 full sized can't
if it's only 2WD - actually a 1WD when absent a rear locker?

I just say that I *am* a truck guy, and I like my 2 trucks with a
short bed, and a short short bed. Having an 8' bed doesn't do anything
but make it harder to park at the mall IMO, because I am NOT going
back to a standard cab truck again. Interior room is every bit as
important as bed space is today. If I need 1000 cubic feet of payload
space, I'll hitch up my Featherlight.

It's tongue in cheek.  I looked at the Tundra when I was truck
shopping, and rejected it because it only came with a short bed.
But I spend a fair bit of time haulling 8 &amp; 12 foot lumber, and
the 12's stick out too far in a short bed with the gate down(*).
So my needs are kinda special :-)

Got that right :-(  With a 53' turning circle, I need a 5-lane road
to make a U-turn (so I don't make too many U-turns).

John

(* saw two dudes once trying to take a bunch of 16' 2 x 4's in a
short bed truck.  Of course, they kept tipping off the tailgate
since half the length was sticking out behind, so one of these
geniuses climbs in the bed and sits down on lumber at the cab
end, to counterweight it.  That worked well until his buddy got
on the gas pulling out of the parking lot, and pretty much
reinvented the catapult).

&gt; I got your Lightning covered with several vehicles...LOL!

&gt; All almost kidding aside, those are nice pieces to be F-O-R-Ds, but
&gt; what kind of mileage do you get with that? I wouldn't want it for any
&gt; kind of daily commute over a few miles. That's why I went
&gt; small/mid-size for my latest commuter, and kept my Tundra for towing
&gt; and when I need a larger bed (as John alluded to, there isn't much you
&gt; can fit in a 61&quot; bed...I am putting a roll top cover on it to use as a
&gt; trunk) The Tundra is long since paid off, and I just couldn't part
&gt; with it. They're actually pretty nice trucks over the long haul IMO.

&gt; But I do have a couple of Corvettes that have that Lightning covered.
&gt; A plain jane C6 convertible, and a blown '03 Z06 that is supposedly
&gt; putting out 525HP at the flywheel according to LPE, who installed the
&gt; supercharger for me. Of course, the Z06 has been &quot;for sale&quot; since I
&gt; got the new one....lol

&gt; Just out of curiosity, what is the tow rating on your Ford? I know
&gt; most of these tuner/specialty trucks usually don't have much of a tow
&gt; or payload rating on them. I had a GMC Syclone for a while back in the
&gt; day, and IIRC, it wasn't recommended as a tow vehicle at all and the
&gt; payload rating was less than some passenger cars of the time. There
&gt; are times, when watching Barrett-Jackson especially, that I wish I
&gt; still had that old Syclone. They only made about 3000 of the '91s like
&gt; I had and that baster could haul some kind of ass.

In a straight line, stock Vettes, even Z06's can't touch a Lightning in the
1/4 mile.
But in distances farther than that, the Z06 easily outclasses it.
As far as Chevy SSR trucks are concerned, don't even try it.
With about $3000 in mods, a lightning can easily turn 11 second quarter mile
times yet still be a well mannered street vehicle.
My truck isn't my daily driver. It stays in the garage most of the time.
Gas mileage isn't much worse than a standard F150 (13-16 mpg).
Tow rating is only 5000 lbs. , but how much can you tow with a Vette?
It's also one of a very rare breed just like the Syclone (about 3700 total
made in 04')
Mine is white in color. (one of only 429).
SVT is now defunct. Mustang GT500's are the latest vehicles out of those
assembly lines but they don't carry the "SVT" moniker.
These trucks could easily be Barrett Jackson gold in the future.
