Okay, here goes...

Many years ago I adopted a dog from the pound, she was the most
incredibly good dog and has been with me for over ten years.  She is now
in her teens.  Maybe 12-13?  A large breed dog, part Keeshund and
possibly part Shepherd.  She is very well trained and knows over 60
different commands/phrases.  Her name is Gypsy Rose.

We knew we'd get another dog when her time came, and debated on whether
to get one now, or after.  The logic was that now, she could help us
train a new dog by example, and supposedly younger dogs breathe life
into older ones.  But we didn't make the decision, we looked around but
never really decided.  Until one day we encountered a dog unexpectedly
and adopted her, another dog pound special.

The logic was flawed, and when Dakota's time comes waay down the road,
we'll wait until the after.  But that doesn't help us now.  We're in it
for the long haul.

Dakota was 8 months when we adopted her, and was a yo-yo dog.  She'd
been at the pound twice.  It was obvious nobody had taken the time to
train her, and she's come a long way in our care.  We've had her for
about 9 weeks.

We've taught her sit, lay down, stay, up (the stairs), go away, come,
and a couple others, including some hand signals.  We've taught her to
eat from her own bowls, though she still tries to snatch a bite of Gypsy
Rose's when her own bowl is empty.  We've taught her to wait at the
kitchen doorway while her food is being readied and not to go to her
food bowls until given permission.  She's done incredibly well with
that, too.

The problem we're having is that she just harasses Gypsy Rose
constantly, mostly wanting to play but her play is a bit rough and Gypsy
Rose is older.  And two big dogs hurtling thru the house isn't a good
thing (both are house dogs, we don't do yard dogs).

I know in part it's Dakota's fear of not getting enough, whether it be
food, attention, whatever, due to her history.  She's happy with us but
I don't think she likes sharing us.  So she harasses Gypsy Rose, just
bugs her nonstop like a bratty little sister.  She doesn't try to hurt
her, she just pesters.

She knows it's not acceptable to us but on this issue, we haven't found
the trick in getting her to obey us for any length of time.  We might
get her to back off and go do something else but 10 minutes later, she's
back at it.

She's now about 10 months old, full of energy, hormonal (but fixed), and
prior to us, I don't think she'd ever been in a house.  So it's all new
for her.  We do not have a fenced yard so she's limited to walks for
exercise.

Gypsy Rose doesn't help... she figured out that if she instigates Dakota
to bother her, Dakota gets in trouble.  So we believe Gypsy Rose is
egging it on.

Can anyone offer any suggestions on how to get the two dogs to stay calm
around each other?  Not go into high gear?

Shari

I have had the same sort of thing with my male dog Muttley, who is about 3,
and female Lucky, who is about 2. At first it seemed like Lucky wanted to
play, while Muttley wanted to chill out, but then it seemed more like
Muttley was resource guarding me from her attentions.

Same here. I could get them to &quot;knock it off&quot; for a little while, but then
they'd stare at each other and it would start again. It was worst when they
both got on the bed (especially when I was also there).

I found that they seemed to play/fight until I asked them if they wanted to
go out, and then they both stopped and waited for me to put on their
leashes and go for a while. I think they had me trained.

I would usually tell Muttley to stop it, but sometimes Lucky would give him
a little nip and start it up again. I think they mostly enjoyed it,
although it looked and sounded pretty rough (two 75 lb dogs).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yesterday and last night I let them continue their interactions with only a
few timeouts when it seemed to be getting out of control. Finally they both
seemed exhausted and plopped on the floor. They've been much better behaved
today.

They seemed to get along well during the first 2-3 weeks, which is
supposedly the &quot;honeymoon&quot; period. Then for about the next 6-8 weeks until
now, it seemed to be getting worse, with occasional bright spots when I
thought all was OK. Of course, they are both adult dogs, while yours is
still an adolescent, and all dogs are different. But mine were both street
dogs rescued from the pound, so they might share similarities in their
early history.

I make sure both dogs get a lot of attention and affection. I think they
both want to please me, most of the time. I've been fairly lax with
training, and I've done some things that others say were wrong, such as
letting them both eat from one plate, or sharing a bone. But maybe that
also helped them work out their issues with each other?

I'm not an experienced dog owner, particularly with multiple dogs, but for
now, at least, there is peace in the den.

Paul, Muttley and Lucky

I've heard a lot of advice from various sources:

1.  Let them fight it out to establish the pecking order.  Haven't tried
this one, don't know the wisdom of it and the age difference is so vast.
Size wise they are similar.  While part of their issue is that the
younger dog wants the Alpha spot, part of the issue is that they do want
to play, too much.

2.  Teaching them the Back Off command.  I've been working on this one,
walking into the dog while saying Back Off.  The older dog already knows
it, the younger one is learning it, but understanding and obeying are
two different things.  Their desire to have at it is so strong, neither
wants to obey this.

3.  Equal time, equal attention, equal petting.  Guilty.  The younger
one requires so much extra attention for her training, the older one
doesn't get equal time.  Equal treats and food, yes.  Note that in all
we've had to teach her, housebreaking was another hurdle.  She hadn't
been housebroken.  She is now.  Or about 95%.  She still occasionally
let's a few drops out if she gets overexcited.

4.  Give them treats when they are in close proximity and behaving well.

5.  Putting the instigator into &quot;doggie jail&quot;, separating the instigator
from the rest of us for awhile immediately after they instigate.

Has anyone succeeded using any of these methods?

Not so handsome, not so happy jackass, not even
morrison the anonymHOWES PROFESSIONAL

miller aka dogman aka tommy sorenson sez:

&quot;I don't know how big you are, kiddo, so this may
not be as easy for you as it is for me, but use
a little &quot;knee action,&quot; that is, as the dog goes
charging by you, just give the dog a little bop
with your knee and shin.  Yep, really lean into it.

Even knock her over, if you can, but make sure to
make her think twice about rushing past you again -
- which is exactly what you want her to do.

Don't bother with scolding her, she'll get the message.

If it happens again, just REPEAT the knee action.

When she steps on your toes, just pick up your foot
abruptly and nudge her with your knee.  Again, no
scolding is necessary here, so you don't have to
worry about her &quot;over-reacting.&quot;

I don't think this is necessarily a lack of respect
for you, just a lack of training.  That is, she just
needs *more* of it.&quot;

&quot;My objective is always to find a way that WORKS.
And if it is DANGEROUS behavior that I'm trying
to modify, behavior than can get the dog KILLED,
I will resort to ANYTHING to save him.

A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G.

Okay.  Call me a cruel, inhumane, abusive bastard
if you want to, but it doesn't affect me at all.
When you've saved the lives of as many dogs as I
have, you'll learn that that's the only thing that
really matters.  Saving lives and making dogs become
good citizens

At no time do the Monks *ever* advocate beating a

When he was a puppy we were very lucky -
they went through or came up. We've done
&quot;sock work&quot; with him leaving them alone,
but mostly are pretty conscientious about
not making them available.

The risk is obviously too high.  One of his
littermates beat him to the punch with the
same surgery, and his great grandfather had
this habit until he died at age 12.

My MIL was visiting (sockless!) and since he
wasn't with me every waking moment as usual
as a result, I can only imagine that the sock
presented itself somehow while she was with him.

He was a very, very sick dog.  He had emergency
surgery on Monday, but was home by Tuesday - we
lucked out that the sock had advanced enough that
they didn't need to cut the bowel.

Once he was opened, they were able to manipulate
the sock out his rectum.  He thinks he's fine, so
the leash is very necessary! He's got about a foot
of staples on his tummy, and this was a very
expensive sock!

I've been in that situation, although with my dogs it was
just that the younger dog wanted to play and had a
ridiculous amount of energy.  I do think you're probably
reading too much intentionality into Gypsy Rose's behavior.

The first thing is that you really need to define some safe
space for the older dog, whether it's a room, a crate, or
whatever.  She needs a place where she can go to get away
from the puppy (at 10 months Dakota is still a puppy).

Second, you need better play outlets for Dakota.  Is there
an off-leash dog park in your area?  What about strenuous
hikes?  She's at an age where her energy is peaking but
where she's not yet mature enough to have much self-
control, so in addition to teaching her self-control it's
good to find outlets for the energy.

Another thing is to take Dakota to obedience class.  It
already sounds like you're doing really, really well with
training, but an obedience class would give her a weekly
outing that's all her own and also provides a structured
environment in which she'd learn to concentrate amid
distractions and around a lot of other dogs.

But the main thing is vigilance.  Dakota is doing what young
dogs do.  She can learn not to and it sounds like you're
doing really well by your dogs, but she has to learn
self-control and until she does it's up to you to protect
the older dog, who really deserves and needs her own safe
space.

Any chance you can fence your yard?  Not to move your dogs
out there, but to give them an outside off-leash play space
where Dakota can run her brains out, and Gypsy Rose can go
to get away from the puppy?

I'm no expert on 2 dog households so take this for what it's worth, but
I do see some things you can do to make things easier on your older dog.

Separate feeding.  At meal time, the dogs go into separate rooms.  Each
is given her bowl of food and 10 minutes alone with it.  Then the bowls
are picked up until the next meal.

I wouldn't worry so much about giving equal treatment.  Since Dakota is
a younger dog with greater exercise needs, give Dakota extra outside
time with you for longer walk/runs.  If you can swing it, take Dakota
swimming.  When she comes home, she'll be healthily exhausted.  Is there
a dog park near?  Let the dogs there engage her in a good game of tag.
Even if Gypsy weren't in the picture, a tired dog is a good dog, and it
sounds like Dakota, at 10 months, needs an outlet for energy.

Stop thinking of crate time as doggie jail, and stop anthropomorphizing
to the point of considering who instigates.  When dogs start
roughhousing inside, they go to their crates for a chance to cool off
and relax.  Gypsy should be glad for her safe place to snooze without
being bothered by the young upstart, and Dakota should be getting used
to her own safe den.

Do NOT let them establish their own hierarchy.  You're the one in
charge.  That's all they need to know.

What?  No!  Same room, separate bowls and separate spaces.
Here's hoping the dogs are going to be together a long, long
time and if they are it's never too soon to start training.
If you're not up to training you can manage it by crate
feeding.

What?  No!  The dogs are going to establish their own
hierarchy regardless of what you have to say about it.  What
you can control is how they express their relationship -
what's appropriate behavior, what's inappropriate behavior,
and what's flat-out intolerable behavior.

I really think you need to live in a multi-dog situation
before you can really hope to understand dogs' social lives.
What happens between a human and a dog is not much like what
happens between dogs, and extrapolating from one to the
other isn't likely to produce great results.  You said
&quot;Don't anthropomorphize,&quot; which I agree with 100%.  So,
don't anthropomorphize interactions, either.

We're actually looking into fencing our yard.  We have a HUGE yard so
obviously cost is a factor.  I wanted a fence long before Dakota.  It
would give her a play area that she simply cannot have in the house.
I've tried to tie her out when I work in the yard but within two minutes
she chewed thru the 50 rope and was off and running.  Funny thing is,
she didn't run far.  Right up the stairs onto the deck waiting to go
back in the house.  That's her happy place, indoors.

Chains she gets tangled in such a way I'm afraid she'll hurt herself.  I
don't trust dog fences.  Someone was actually going to give us one but
I'm just not trusting of them.  I've seen dogs plow right thru when they
are highly motivated.

Gypsy Rose is trained enough to stay in the yard, so she has lots of
freedom outdoors when we're doing yard things.  And she obeys even from
a distance, so she is incredibly wonderful.  Looking forward to Dakota
achieving that place.

They eat well together.  Dakota initially bullied Gypsy Rose away from
her food bowls and attempted to guard all the food, even though their
bowls are several feet apart.  But we've gotten her doing wonderfully,
now she eats from her bowls and Gypsy Rose eats from her own.

Very little troubles there except that Gypsy Rose is accustomed to
picking at her food all day so she doesn't eat all at once.  This
presents a problem with food just sitting all day so we end up
separating her for part of the day until she finishes eating or putting
her food up for awhile.  That temptation is just beyond Dakota at the
moment.  (She was starved when we adopted her, bones all showing thru so
she has issues about food, the fear of not getting enough.)

We're working on breaking her of a chewing problem as well, in addition
to having to potty train an 8 month old wild child.  The potty training
is almost perfect now, very rare accidents if she gets overexcited so
we're on our way on this issue.

Dakota has a crate for when we have to leave for work or somewhere.  If
we're home, she's out 95% of the time but when we go, she has to be
crated.  She's a long way from being trusted alone anywhere.  We
couldn't even give her a blanket to lay on in the crate because she
chewed it to pieces while we were gone.

When we are home she is with someone at all times and doesn't try to
chew anything.  No big chewing problems.  It's when nobody's around that
the Devil Dog erupts.  We've given her a lot of outlets for chewing, the
house is littered with various chew toys.

She is full of energy far beyond the rest of us right now.  So yes, she
needs more outlets for it.  On that note, off we go for a walk....

It depends!  I'm on 13 acres, but I fenced off a manageable

good fencing can be pricey, and good fencing that's not ugly

Right - I don't have a lot of use for those things, either.
Have you looked into a trolley tie-out?  They run above the
dog's head and there's less opportunity to become tangled.
They do require two things to anchor the trolley to.  See,

One advantage of a trolly tie-out is that after  you no longer
need to use it as a tie out, you can turn it into a dog toy.

We hooked a leash onto the slider, and a &quot;fuzzy ball&quot; toy onto
the end of the leash (any toy you can hook to the leash should
do).  Dylan and Oppie spent many a fun hour tugging on the fuzzy
ball, running back and forth with it, trying to dislodge it.  And
we'd stand at one end of the line and hurl the erratically moving
ball down to the other end, for the dogs to chase and retrieve.

Never had a chance to try them on her... I was still
using the e-fence and chains to keep her in the yard.

The suggestions I received here to keep Peach home
were: build a fence... wasn't going to happen.. we
plan on putting a modular home here within the next
few years... put more fence at the top of the pen I
used so both dogs could play bitey face w/o tangling,
and similar suggestions.

Jerry was the only one to mention border training...
but he was kook supreme ;-P  So I ignored him... no
killfiles with webtv..  at that time Jerry had his own
troll, somewhat like Candace, so the group was not
very conducive to learning anything.

At one point I even b*tched about Jerry.

By the time I tried out Jerry's manual Peach had
already ran away.

Not very good at the google groups search but you'll
find my first post at &quot;runaway dog message 30&quot; within
that thread is mention of the dogs taking off and being
gone for 2 days.

I stopped posting for a bit... my middle boy was
devastated that his dog was gone... Zelda came
home but not her mom.

The next few posts from me were ones about/to Jerry.

Then Jerry made the WETM accessible for webbes, I put
it in my e-mail (no storage otherwise on webby unless
you put stuff on a webpage) and read it, read it and
read it.

Once I understood what the concept was, I implemented
it on Zelda.  It worked and I now have a great housedog!

I only regret that my own distrust of Jerry caused me to
lose another wonderful dog. Peach was an absolute gem with
little kids.  I and my boys still miss her.  Sometimes I
still look to see if she came home when we get back from
trips.

Maybe Peach would still have ran away...

I don't now whether Peach is dead or alive. I do
know she's not here with us. I really can't blame
anyone here for her loss.

I'm the one who ignored your advice. I did it because
of how you write/wrote. I was unwilling to accept the
idea that my using a shock collar could have any bearing
on Peach not wanting to stay home.

Up until I started using it my main concern
had been keeping my dogs in their own yard.

Once I started using the e-fence... well, then my
concern became how to keep them from running
off for days on end.

I lost valuable training time becoming embroiled
in the anti-shock debate and the &quot;Jerry sux&quot; tirades.

I lost one dog but I have the bestest dog in the world
now &lt;g&gt; A Wits End Trained dog, one who is completely
housetrained, doesn't chew up stuff, stays in the yard,
and doesn't bark all the time.

IOW a great companion and friend.

We just installed a PetSafe brand fence this Spring.
Two dogs, two collars We now have one dog and
no collars.

Peach and Zelda would run thru the fence, not want
to come back in the yard and would run for days.

The last time, Peach didn't come back home.

I used the Wit's End Training Manual to learn how
to train my dog. She is now border trained.  A few
minutes each day reinforces her desire to stay in
the yard.

She no longer runs out into the road, I can stop her
from chasing cats and she no longer cringes when
we walk around the yard.

I can not say loud or long enough how much I hate
the e-fence and its collars.  If you can't get a
regular fence then you need to train your dog.

I will never rely on an electronic collar to
keep my dog in our yard again.

Hi Cathy!

Yes I used The Wits End Method to train my girl, Zelda.
You can check the archives and see I'm a real person..

I post in misc.kids.breastfeeding, alt.cats
rec.pets.cats.annecdotes (not lately, my kitty
died) rec.pets.dogs.behavior rec.pets.birds
and a ton of webtv firewalled ngs.

Zelda and her mom, Peach (RB) both loved to
run the neighborhood with my neighbors 2 male
dogs.  An e-fence couldn't keep them home,
chains pulled up and Peach could jump/climb
a 5 ft. fence.

I wrote in here for advice and felt like Jerry had
jumped down my throat.  Upon re-reading his post
to me..well..it hit home hard that I was being
abusive to my dog.

The thought of shocking my dog ever again
makes me want to puke.

Like I've said before... I might not like the way Jerry
treats some of the other posters but he gave me ( for _
free_) a way to teach myself and my dog.

I can let Zelda outside and not worry that a potty

break will mean she'll be gone for 2 days or, worse
yet, not ever come home...like her mom.

Zelda stopped chewing everything in sight once
I started applying Jerry's methods.  One time of
&quot;bad slipper!&quot; and she never chewed another one
up :-D

I don't post here a lot because I don't ave any

Hi folks,

In my opinion the use of a radioshock fence is a
waste  of time, effort or money. I can understand
it if you a rich snob who cares nothing about their
dogs safey or behaviours.

At work I boundary train all the dogs to the bricked
area (Four kennels with 26 cages with 1 dog in each,
1 services building and 2 catterys which is surrounded
by scrubland to the east and woodlands to the north
and a lake to the west).

This works well, because then when people buy

them the dogs are easier to boundary train to a
door or fence or yard.

However on a personal note, my two shelter mutts,
who I trained using the WITS END DOG MANUAL available
at www.doggydoright.com will not go past  the back
door, or the back gate or the front gate without
permission.

And it is nice, for when you are having a party, you
can leave your gates open for people, and your dogs
won't be the least concerned.

I find this better then spending your well earned money
on a piece of junk Why not use it to invest in a horse?
Or a new house? Make a nice aquarium? Build a nursery
for a child?

Save your money. Train your dog. Please. -- Thankyou,

They collected her and brought her to me.  I gave

You mean I'm keeping bad company for reading Wits End?  I'm not quite
halfway thru the first reading.  If your bedside manner were anything
like your actual eBook, you'd help a lot more folks out there.  If your
website weren't so difficult to deal with, you'd help a LOT more folks
out there.  I had to Google for a PDF copy of your eBook.  I couldn't do
your website.  It was awful.  It needs a serious makeover.  It probably
chases 99% of all visitors away, which is sad, because your eBook does
have merit.  A lot of what you say makes good sense.  But you need a
better image, PW.  Folks think you are loony, not in a good way.

In the meantime, I take all advice offered to me, and use what makes the
most sense.  This is a tough group, because there is a lot of good
advice, and a lot of caring folks, but the fact that everybody doesn't
play nice in the sandbox together makes it hard for folks who genuinely
want to help their dogs become their best friends for life.

Dakota makes progress every day.  She is in training to be the Perfect
Dog and I know that she will achieve this.  She genuinely wants to
learn.

Thanks to everybody who offers advice here.  Dakota and I appreciate all
of you.

I've not seen one of these.  Is it similar to a clotheline type run
where your dog can run back and forth along a clothesline?  (We tried
that on Dakota.  She didn't do well.  I thought she was going to hurt
herself.  She'd run top speed til she hit the end and then just about
snap her neck.  So we had to abort.)

We did make some progress that we can play ball with her now.  We
couldn't initially because she'd get excited and pee in the house.
She's holding well enough now that we can play fetch in the house with
her, and she gets exercise and enjoyment.  No way to do it outside yet.

Oddly enough, it was a project day that she had this breakthrough.
Normally we only crate her if we both have to be away.  If at least one
of us is home, she runs free at least in the rooms we're in.

But one day I needed a day out and my husband had a project he was
working on, and she can be such an interference that he wouldn't be able
to get anything done, so he crated her in the same room he was working
in.

This had the effect that now when we come home from work, she doesn't
pee as we're letting her out of the crate.  She used to hold it til we
let her out, but just as we were opening the door she'd pee.  Now she
holds it til she's outside in her potty spot.

Now if only she'd let us give her something soft to lay on in there
without chewing it to smithereens....

Google on &quot;trolley tie out&quot; and you'll find a lot of commercially
manufactured ones.  You can also find the parts at most hardware
stores -  airline cable, clamps, turnbuckles, springs, hooks,
washers.

First, never put a dog wearing a collar on a tie-out,
trolley-style or otherwise; only use a harness.  With a collar,
it's too easy for the dog to get strangled.

Second, a properly constructed trolley line has springs around
the cable on each end, so that when the pulley/wheel slams into
the end of the line, it hits a spring and not a rigid surface.
This absorbs some of the force so that the dog who is running
full-tilt isn't injured.  For some reason, a lot of the
commercially available trolley tie-outs only come with one
spring; you need to buy another one for the other end of the cable.

for the entire kit with a 40 ft aerial line and about a six foot cable from
the runner to the dog's harness. It was stretched between two trees with
screw eyes, and tightened with a turnbuckle. If she ran parallel to the
aerial line, she would encounter the trees before coming to the end of the
run. If she ran at an angle, even if only to avoid the trees, the line had
enough give that it did not suddenly yank on the harness. But when I
visited her one evening after she'd been there for several days, she ran
perpendicular to the line, and I heard something snap, and she was loose.
She had pulled hard enough to completely bend the screw eye so that the
aerial line came loose, and the turnbuckle flew almost all the way to the
opposite tree. There is a lot of mechanical advantage when force is applied
at right angles to the aerial run, and also she was/is a strong and heavy
dog, and she really wanted to go with us as we were leaving.

I think these runs are best used in conjunction with a fenced area that
restricts lateral motion. There were rubber bumpers on each end of the
trolley line, but you can also get spring-loaded in line shock absorbers
for the tie cable to the harness.

&gt;&gt; Seems you got a bad habit of keepin the wrong company:

&gt;&gt; lie with PIGS you'll awaken STINKIN like 'm,&quot; The Puppy
&gt;&gt; Wizard's DADDY &lt;{}: ~ ( &gt;

&gt; You mean I'm keeping bad company for reading Wits End?  I'm not quite
&gt; halfway thru the first reading.  If your bedside manner were anything
&gt; like your actual eBook, you'd help a lot more folks out there.  If your
&gt; website weren't so difficult to deal with, you'd help a LOT more folks
&gt; out there.  I had to Google for a PDF copy of your eBook.  I couldn't do
&gt; your website.  It was awful.  It needs a serious makeover.  It probably
&gt; chases 99% of all visitors away, which is sad, because your eBook does
&gt; have merit.  A lot of what you say makes good sense.  But you need a
&gt; better image, PW.  Folks think you are loony, not in a good way.

&gt; In the meantime, I take all advice offered to me, and use what makes the
&gt; most sense.  This is a tough group, because there is a lot of good
&gt; advice, and a lot of caring folks, but the fact that everybody doesn't
&gt; play nice in the sandbox together makes it hard for folks who genuinely
&gt; want to help their dogs become their best friends for life.

&gt; Dakota makes progress every day.  She is in training to be the Perfect
&gt; Dog and I know that she will achieve this.  She genuinely wants to
&gt; learn.

&gt; Thanks to everybody who offers advice here.  Dakota and I appreciate all
&gt; of you.
">

I tried Jerry's method, and I could not get past the first lesson with
Muttley. But I still think there is some merit in the method, and I believe
it is important to establish a good relationship with your dog, and avoid
physical corrections such as yanks on a choker chain as much as possible.
But Muttley has been a very stubborn and aloof dog, and he avoided eye
contact with me during the hot/cold exercises that were supposed to get him
to pay attention.

There was a post 8/25/07 titled &quot;Gig's up&quot;, that had a link to a similar
method proposed many years ago by Dr. Dare Miller:
http://www.dogmastersystem.com/steps.htm . It is being sold as kits or as
individual items, and the web site is professionally done. The Master kit
is over $200. I noticed that he is selling a &quot;Pat Miller&quot; kit, but it
probably has no connection to the Pat Miller who is a famous dog trainer in
Hagerstown, MD.

Good luck. I'm glad you are willing to try alternate methods.

I have taken Lucky to the Defenders of Animal Rights, where hopefully she
will be able to find a good home. With her and Muttley, it was a daily
struggle of management, and it was probably because Muttley was jealous of
having the new dog get attention. So, now I miss her a lot, but I want her
to have a chance at a better life.

I wish him luck.  Dakota came from a No Kill shelter.  Apparently she'd
been there once as a youngster.  I think she was 3 months when her
previous owners adopted her from there.  They kept her for 5 months and
sent her back to the shelter.  We adopted her 3 days after they left her
there.  They made us promise that if we didn't keep her, we'd bring her
back to them.  Troublesome as she is, we're committed to her.  That we
see progress every week means that she will get there.

Good luck to you, Paul.

People aren't going to learn any faster than dogs how to do things in a

the wrong way, then steer them gently in the right direction.  You will
retrain a lot more people if you attempt to train them the same way you
train dogs, PW.  Your success rate would be stunning if you approached
people the same way you approach dogs.

You are beating on people the same way you say we shouldn't beat on

UofOH Oxford, That Rehabilitation Of Hyperactive
Dogs Can Easily And Readily Be Done Using TLC.
Tender Loving Care Is At The Root Of The Scientific
Management Of Doggys.  &lt;{) ; ~ ) &gt;

&quot;Despite Skinner's clear denunciation of &quot;negative
reinforcement&quot; (1958) NEARLY EVERY LEARNING
THEORY model involves the USE OF PUNISHMENT.

Of curse, Skinner has never to my knowledge,
demonstrated HOWE we escape the phenomenon
that an expected reward not received is experienced
as a punishment and can produce extensive and
persistent aggression (Azrin et al, 1966).&quot;

&quot;The IMBECILITY of some of the claims for
operant technique simply take the breath
away. Lovas et al (1966) report a standard
contingent reward/punishment procedure
developing imitative speech in two severly
disturbed non verbal schizophrenic boys.
After twenty-six days the boys are reported
to have been learning new words with alacrity.
HOWEver, when REWARDS were moved to
a delayed contingency the behavior and learning
immediately deteriorated.&quot;

&quot;...all the highest nervous activity, as it
manifests itself in the conditional reflex,
consists of a continual change of these three
fundamental processes -- excitation, inhibition
and disinhibition,&quot;  Ivan P. Pavlov

&quot;Postitive emotions arising in connection
with the perfection of a skill, irrespective
of its pragmatic significance at a given
moment, serve as the reinforcement. IOW,
emotions, not outside rewards, are what
reinforces any behavior,&quot; Ivan Pavlov.

&quot;All animals learn best through play.&quot; -- Konrad Lorenz

&quot;It is NO WONDER that the marked changes in
deviant behavior of children can be achieved
through brief, simple educative routines with
their mothers which modify the mother's social
behaviors shaping the child (Whaler, 1966).

Some clinics have reported ELIMINATION of the
need for child THERAPY through changing the
clinical emphasis from clinical to parental
HANDLING of the child (Szrynski 1965).

A large number of cases improved sufficiently
after preliminary contact with parents that NO
treatment of children was required, and almost
ALL cases SHOWE a remarkably shortened period
for therapy.

Quite severe cases of anorexia nervosa have been
treated in one to five months by simply REPLACING
the parents temporarily with EFFUSIVELY LOVING
SUBSTITUTES (Groen, 1966).&quot;

Shari, you said it perfectly. I made a similar comment long ago, with just
about the same predictable response from JH. He continued to blast me and
everyone else who did not immediately become his adoring disciple. Then,
last May, he actually called me, and he was very nice, so I decided to try
his methods. We talked again, and I tried several more times, with no
success. Then he started his abusive ways again, and there was no more
dialog. He thinks in absolute terms of black or white, hot or cold,
mentally sound or incurably insane, with no shades of gray. He lumps all
non-believers into the incurable category, while he believes all dogs (and
other creatures in his list) are exactly the same and will respond equally
well to his methods. Yet he will alternate his opinion of people depending
on their acceptance of his teaching. But he does not follow his own
teaching in his attempts to &quot;train&quot; people, so he is saying, &quot;do as I say,
not as I do&quot;. I cannot respect, or have meaningful dialog with, someone who
does that.

&gt;&gt; Now that my evaluation of Jerry's methods are complete

&gt; You NEVER COMPLETED the first EXXXORCISE

It was unsuccessful when Muttley simply ignored
the constant praise and became confused. Maybe
that method works on high strung, needy dogs
that need to be calmed down.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yeah. HOWE COME you won't TRY using the NON
&gt; VIOLENT methods I teach FOR FREE, paulie?
">

Your non-violent methods for dogs ring hollow
when you use verbal violence against other dog
owners, thus triggering their own opposition
reflexes. I will try other non-violent methods
that communicate what is expected of the dog.

And I don't believe that proper use of a prong
collar or choker chain are evil and physically
hurtful.

[snip verbal abuse]

So you think it is effective to withold praise,
but offer it as a bribe to get people to follow
your methods? Or promise you will stop beating
them if they obey your commands? Yet never do
it for a dog?

Subject: Muttley: Now a question of Life or Death

&quot;Paul E. Schoen&quot; &lt;pst ... @smart.net&gt; wrote

Hello everyone:

If you have followed some of my posts, you know
something about the ongoing story of Muttley, the
large GSD/Chow dog I have been trying to adopt
or place in a better home.

I will add a bit more history later in this post.

Last Tuesday, toward the end of Janet's obedience
class, Muttley and I had just finished fairly successfully
performing a sit/stay/come routine, and then he was
sitting by my side.

The final routine was to be a &quot;down&quot;, which Muttley
has had some difficulty with, and frankly I have not
had the time to work with him much on that.

I was kneeling at his side, trying to hold his collar
while pushing his front legs down to the position,
while he resisted. Suddenly he lunged, knocking
me over onto the parking lot, and I lost grip of the
leash as I reflexively broke my fall.

Muttley took the opportunity to attack a young black
male Lab to my left, and it was a very brutal attack.
Janet and the instructors tried to gain control, and as
soon as I could get to my feet I grabbed the leash and
pulled him off.

That was  the end of the class, and the other dog,
Bernie, was taken to an animal hospital for treatment.

When everyone had left, Janet counseled me about
what should be done about Muttley.

She said this was more than ordinary aggression,
and only intensive (and expensive) one on one
training would have any chance at working, and
in any case, he was not suited to group training.

She advised me that Muttley could be dangerous,
and she recommended that he be euthanized.

&quot;They can't all be saved&quot;.

&lt;snip&gt;

If I did not have to worry about my cat, I would
probably keep him, and I am certain I could avoid
any more dangerous episodes. I probably would
not have taken him to obedience classes at this time
if that was not such a difficult issue, and if people
here had not essentially shamed me into doing so.

Then he would only be a bratty dog with a mind of
his own, but he would not have been identified as
dangerous.
