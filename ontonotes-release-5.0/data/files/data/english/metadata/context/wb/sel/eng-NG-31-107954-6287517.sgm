In my hand I have a SAPIM brochure - Trust in SAPIM Spokes.

On the second-last page of the brochure, SAPIM has a graph showing the
estimated spoke life in wheel revolutions. The company's standard
double-butted spoke, the Race, has an estimated life of just under 1
million revolutions.

Let's say 1 million for argument sake, and that a wheel revolution
translates into two meters on the road. Therefore, the spoke life is
only 2 million meters or, 2000 kms. Not exactly something to brag
about.

Interestingly, but as an aside to this inaccurate estimate by SAPIM,
the company's CD-Ray product, a 2,3mm wide bladed spoke, has an
estimated life of 3,5 million "Wheel Revolutions (in cycles), as SAPIM
puts it.

Why would the company think that it's bladed spoke will last longer
than the round one? Since diameter is a difficult comparison in this
case, perhaps weight is. The bladed spoke has a weight index of 278,
whereas the round one 360. The index btw, is my invention, they weigh
278g per sample length per X number of spokes.

that is machine testing, not wheel testing.  the machine loads from

Because the two spokes have different metallurgy. The production
process for the CX-Ray is much more involved than the basic "take a
bit of wire and bang one end into a mushroom" of a cheap straight
guage spoke.

Disregarding the Sapim "hype", the sheer number of boutique wheels
(HED, Corima, Xtreme) which are built with CX-Rays confirms its
position as the uber-spoke

Dear Johan,

Your question has come up before--it would be nice if Sapim would
include a description of its testing.

The Sapim spoke fatigue tests must use exaggerated stress cycles
because it takes literally years to break spokes in continuous testing
under ordinary low stress cycles--no spoke manufacturer sells spokes
that are expected to fail in only 2,000 km of normal riding.

In the study below, measured road-test spoke-stress ranged from only
20 to 150 MPa. It took months to break 76 test spokes with continuous
10-cycle-per-second testing at 174 to 501 MPa:

"In 1984 and 1985, fatigue tests on stainless steel bicycle spokes
were carried out for Wheelsmith, Inc. at Stanford University. Constant
cycle tests were conducted with pre-tensioning stresses of 174 MPa,
250 MPa, 343 MPa, 347 MPa, 424 MPa, and 501 MPa. . . . In 68 spokes
the failure occurred at the cold-worked elbow; in the remaining 8
spokes the failure occurred at the threads."

"The smallest stress cycle in the fatigue tests was 174 MPa, whereas
the stress range from the road test data was 20 MPa to 150 MPa. Hence,
the fatigue data was extrapolated to the low stress range. (To have
tested a single sample at 40 MPa would have required over a year of
continuous testing at 10 cycles per second, and an unwarranted use of
facilities.)"

http://www.duke.edu/~hpgavin/papers/HPGavin-Wheel-Paper.pdf

Ten stress cycles per second for a spoke on a 700c wheel is roughly 45
mph. It's also 315,360,000 cycles per year, roughly 630,000 km or
380,000 miles.

It's likely that those 1984 spokes were significantly less durable
than modern spokes.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

I have no doubt that it is an exaggerated test cycle. But don't they

Johan now says: OK, let me explain why I brought weight into it in the
first place.

1) Sapim Race spokes have a "Wheel Revolutions" limit of 1 000 000
revolutions.
2) Sapim CX-Ray Spokes have a "Wheel Revolutions" limit of 3 500 000
revolutions.
3) They're both made of 18/8 stainless steel.
4) The CX-Ray spoke differs from the Race spoke in that it is a)
flattened and b) has less material for a given length (deducted from
the fact that they WEIGH less than an equivalent length Race spoke).

Thus, all things being equal, a thinner, flattened spoke has a longer
fatigue life than a thicker, round spoke.

We now have two factors that could contribute to the greater fatigue
life - the flattening process or the fact that the shaft is more
flexible (deduced from its relative weight).

There, does that make sense?

The ends of the spoke have the same shape and size so it isn't
surprising that spoke with the thinner center section (cross sectional
area) outlasts the thicker one. In practice the thinner spoke will see
a lower stress cycle on the ends, because the center will stretch more
easily.

FWIW, Jobst is often quoted disparaging the durability
of older spokes, I think he meant spokes a lot older than
1984.  Like 1960s or 1970s spokes.  Once upon a time
stainless spokes were pretty rare (and I don't know if they
were all good either).  By the mid 80s people might likely
have been building with DT (or Wheelsmith?) stainless
spokes fairly similar to today's.  I would guess that a couple
of the grotty old Mavic wheels in the picture I posted to
the Finite Element thread are from the 80s, (red/gold Mavic
sticker era) and they have nice DT stainless spokes.
Time has not been as kind to the spoke eyelets.

Maybe.
Or were those numbers pulled out of the air?  "2000k lifetime" is
nonsensical to anyone with familiarity. But any ad writer would eagerly
write "one million cycles" for any product - especially if he weren't
burdened by knowledge of bikes or spokes.

If they meant 1MM cycles at an extreme load, why no mention of that? If
that was intended, it's simple in English:
"Our product will bear up to 1MM cycles of extreme load"
"Our product sustained 1MM cycles of industry standard fatigue testing"
"Our competitor's product failed at merely 985,00 cycles"

I was also curious about the smaller-section aero spoke showing 2.3x
longevity. That does not make any sense at all as _less_ material just
couldn't bear _2.3x_ the load cycles. And the values are nice and round,
too, 1,000,000 and 2,300,000. Convenient numbers, those, as they just

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no doubt that it is an exaggerated test cycle. But don't they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know in marketing hype one doesn't cite exaggerated examples, but best

&gt;&gt; In my hand I have a SAPIM brochure - Trust in SAPIM Spokes.

&gt;&gt; On the second-last page of the brochure, SAPIM has a graph showing the
&gt;&gt; estimated spoke life in wheel revolutions. The company's standard
&gt;&gt; double-butted spoke, the Race, has an estimated life of just under 1
&gt;&gt; million revolutions.

&gt;&gt; Let's say 1 million for argument sake, and that a wheel revolution
&gt;&gt; translates into two meters on the road. Therefore, the spoke life is
&gt;&gt; only 2 million meters or, 2000 kms. Not exactly something to brag
&gt;&gt; about.

&gt; that is machine testing, not wheel testing.  the machine loads from
&gt; 0-80kg each cycle.  what does a wheel load on each cycle?

&gt;&gt; Interestingly, but as an aside to this inaccurate estimate by SAPIM,
&gt;&gt; the company's CD-Ray product, a 2,3mm wide bladed spoke, has an
&gt;&gt; estimated life of 3,5 million &quot;Wheel Revolutions (in cycles), as SAPIM
&gt;&gt; puts it.

&gt; how much bending moment can a skinny bladed spoke exert compared to a
&gt; fat straight gauge spoke?
">

Except that the spoke that does second best on the test, while not
straight gauge, is a very fat spoke. The "Strong" is 2.3/2.0 and is said
to have a middle-section strength of 1400 N/mm2 and a fatigue life of
1,600,000 revolutions.

Furthermore, bending moment doesn't seem to explain why the Laser
(1.5mm center &amp; 1,250,000 revolutions) does better than the CX (1.3mm
center along one dimension &amp; 1,250,000 revolutions) -- unless the
bending moment is exerted by the 2.8mm dimension of the CX.

&gt;&gt; Since diameter is a difficult comparison in this case, perhaps weight
&gt;&gt; is. The bladed spoke has a weight index of 278, whereas the round one
&gt;&gt; 360. The index btw, is my invention, they weigh 278g per sample length

&gt; what does weight have to do with it other than being a side-effect of

Also, the Strong spoke -- a 2.3/2.0mm -- does better than all of the
thin-section spokes except the CX-Ray.

I noticed that Sapim has a new technical document on its website:

www.sapim.be/index.php?st=checklist&amp;taal=uk

This repeats some of the oddities of the old FAQ -- e.g., throw out the
hub if a few spokes break -- and adds some new ones (CX-Ray and Race are
"more resistant to vibrations" than their other spokes?). The old FAQ is
at www.sapim.be/index.php?st=faq .

What I find interesting is that they seem to acknowledge that spoke
alignment is a problem -- see the references to a gap between spoke and
flange and between spoke and nipple (yes, they refer to a "gap" between
spoke and nipple). But instead of recommending that one correct the spoke
line, they suggest getting a new hub or using a different crossing
pattern. Since I've encountered these "gaps" even when using fairly
high-end Shimano hubs (XT and Ultegra), I'd like to know what they suggest
instead (maybe they hope that I'll buy from their marketing partner edco).

Dear Andrew,

Here's the data, culled from the Sapim site's individual pages,
ordered by cycles to failure:

per                            n/mm^2
64 x                            middle  test cycles
model 260mm  hub x    middle   x rim  strength  to failure
-----  ----  ---    ---------    ---  -------- ---------
cxray  278g  2.0 x (0.9 x 2.3) x 2.0   1600    3,500,000
strong 430g  2.3 x    2.0      x 2.0   1400    1,600,000
laser  279g  2.0 x    1.5      x 2.0   1500    1,250,000
cx     423g  2.0 x (1.3 x 2.8) x 2.0   1200    1,220,000
race   360g  2.0 x    1.8      x 2.0   1350      980,000
leader 424g  2.0 x    2.0      x 2.0   1080      870,000

Note that the cycles to failure aren't all that rounded.

Judging by weight, the cxray aero spokes (278 grams) are probably
flattened laser butted spokes (279 grams).

The cx aero spokes (423 grams) are probably flattened straight leader
spokes (424 grams).

Since the round spokes are drawn to thin their midsections, their
midsections work harden and strengthen, with the n/mm^2 strength
rising (1080, 1350, 1500) as they grow thinner (2.0, 1.8, 1.5).

The exception is the "strong," which has a 2 mm middle and rim end
(single-butted like a motorcycle spoke). The "strong" probably lasts
about twice as long as the straight 2 mm "leader" because it's got a
much thicker 2.3 mm elbow, which accounts for the extra 6 grams of
weight over the straight 2 mm spoke. It's probably a thinned 2.3 spoke
blank, which accounts for its higher 1400 n/mm^2 midsection strength

The aero spokes also show greater midsection strength than the round
spokes from which they were probably stamped, again due to work
hardening, but this doesn't affect the unworked elbows where they
probably fail.

Jim Beam's explanation for why the flattened aero spokes last longer
makes sense--their angle to the elbow lets them put less bending
strain on the elbow. That is, when an aero spoke bends at the elbow,
it probably does less bending at the elbow and more bending at the
thin section than a straight-section spoke, spreading the stress out.

The round spokes (leader 2.0, race 1.8, laser 1.5) probably last
longer in testing as their midsections grow thinner for the same
reason--as the thinner midsection bends a little more, it puts a
little less bending strain on the elbow, spreading the bending stress
over more spoke.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

&gt; The cx aero spokes (423 grams) are probably flattened straight leader

&gt; Since the round spokes are drawn to thin their midsections, their

What does the strength of the middle section have to do with fatigue?

&gt; The exception is the &quot;strong,&quot; which has a 2 mm middle and rim end

&gt; about twice as long as the straight 2 mm &quot;leader&quot; because it's got a
&gt; much thicker 2.3 mm elbow, which accounts for the extra 6 grams of

&gt; blank, which accounts for its higher 1400 n/mm^2 midsection strength
">

Maybe so, but to my mind that calls into question the bending moment
explanation put forth by "jim beam." The Strong should have a greater
bending moment than the Leader, right? The two factors are working
against each other.

I'm also curious how cold working the center section of the Strong from 2.3 to 2.0 gives it a middle section with a strength
about 60% greater than that of the Race, which is cold worked from 2.0 to
1.8mm. It seems like you'd have to do an awful lot of cold working to
overcome the Strong's thickness disadvantage. But again, it's not clear to
me what the strength of the middle section has to do with fatigue of the
elbows.

I find it interesting that "jim beam" is advancing his bending moment
thesis, since it seems to show the importance of correcting the spoke
line, something he's dismissed in the past. He's suggesting that the spoke
that bends most to have the right spoke line is the one that's going to
last the longest. I suppose one could say that the difference is that "jim
beam" thinks elastic bending improves fatigue life, whereas Jobst
recommends plastic bending, but I don't really see how that works. If the
spoke is bent elastically, won't it tend to flex more when the wheel goes
through cycles of loading and unloading?

According to this pdf brochure --

www.codagex.com/hardware/brochures/SAPIM.pdf

-- Sapim claim that the Strong is less likely to fatigue because the extra
material gives it a snugger fit with the spoke hole in the flange. If
true, that suggests that other double-butted spokes (and maybe
straight-gauge?) would have similarly higher fatigue
resistance if paired with hubs with smaller spoke holes.

That raises another question -- were their tests of the Race done on
2.0/1.8mm spokes or 1.8/1.6mm? Similarly, were the Leaders 2.0 or 1.8mm?

I think the distinction is between bending in the midsection and bending

As for the "spoke line", it's better if the spoke leaves the flange at

spokes which DT made for a while.

I think we all want the spoke (close to) flush, the question about spoke
line correction is one of how you get it there: correct it manually, or
let it find its way there under normal tensioning.

I don't see how that goes against my point. The mere fact that it's a good
thing that there's some bending going on means that the natural spoke line
inherent in the materials (elbow bend, etc.) is not optimized. We're
talking about flexing that occurs after the spokes have been tensioned and
bedding in has occured. I don't recall that figuring in "jim beam's"
spoke-line theories.

I'm not sure I understand it now.

The way I see it bending at the elbow is bad. Good spoke line at the
elbow (and correct shank length) reduces elbow bending. Flexible
midsection also reduces elbow bending.

Now I thought your point was: correcting the spoke line will reduce
elbow flex in use, so why does jim beam tell us not to correct the spoke
line?

I don't think jim beam has ever denied that poor spoke line
(specifically spoke not flush) contributes to fatigue. It was from him
that I first heard about the long-shank problems with DT spokes. The
point is not that a good spoke line is not desirable, just how should it
be achieved: manually (thumb, crankarm, etc.), or just tension the
spokes and let them do their thing.

One thing though is that jim beam has said IIRC that premature spoke
line correction may actually promote fatigue. I'm less clear on the
reasons for that.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why would the company think that it's bladed spoke will last longer

&gt;&gt; Because the two spokes have different metallurgy. The production

&gt;&gt; bit of wire and bang one end into a mushroom&quot; of a cheap straight
&gt;&gt; guage spoke.

&gt;The Sapim website says that all of their butted spokes are made out of
&gt;Inox 18/8 and are cold forged. Yet the CX-Ray supposedly has double the
&gt;fatigue life of a 2.0/1.5 double butted spoke. What sort of magic are they
&gt;using?
">

AFAIK, the CX-Rays get a different post forming heat treatment
compared with the other spokes. Whatever magic they're using, they
quote a higher UTS for the CX-Rays than their other spokes, so they
must be doing something different to the metal to make that so. They
also quote a longer fatigue life; assuming their test protocol
compares like with like, it doesn't really matter what they've done to
achieve this. The answer to the OP's question is actually "because
they've tested them, and found it to be so"

They can sprinkle fairy dust on the drawing dies for all I care, as
long as they consistently and repeatably make spokes which last longer
than the competition.

Of course, they might have fooled all the people who have spent 4
times as much on a CX-ray compared with a good round double butted
spoke. That would seem to include all the pro team mechanics who
meticulously replace the original spokes in their sponsor-supplied
wheels with CX-Rays.

I don't think fatigue life is a major consideration for most CX-Ray
users (maybe the DH MTB world champions who have won on CX-Rays give
their spokes a beating, but most CX-Rays are on time trial wheels)
Customers who bought CX-Ray equipped wheels from Hed, Zipp, Corima,
American Classic, Velocity, Planet-X, X-treme, Speedcomposites, Tune,
Rolf, Cane Creek, Roland-Werk, Reynolds (who seem to have downgraded
to DT for 2007) or one of the many shop wheelbuilders who use and
recommend CX-rays were probably more impressed by the low weight and
excellent aerodynamic performance of the spokes.

Dear Gary,

Interspersed comments not only make further replies difficult, but
often reveal a reluctance to read the whole post:

"The aero spokes also show greater midsection strength than the round
spokes from which they were probably stamped, again due to work
hardening, but this doesn't affect the unworked elbows where they
probably fail."

I was pointing out the consistency of the Sapim data. The more the
spokes are flattened or drawn, the greater the strength of their
mid-sections.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Johan,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your question has come up before--it would be nice if Sapim would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; include a description of its testing.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Sapim spoke fatigue tests must use exaggerated stress cycles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; because it takes literally years to break spokes in continuous testing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; under ordinary low stress cycles--no spoke manufacturer sells spokes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that are expected to fail in only 2,000 km of normal riding.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have no doubt that it is an exaggerated test cycle. But don't they
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; know in marketing hype one doesn't cite exaggerated examples, but best
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; case scenarios. I have SAPIM-built wheels which have done closer to 40
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 000 kms. Why would a company misrepresent itself so much? I don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; understand and I don't suppose there is a rational answer for this.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or were those numbers pulled out of the air?  &quot;2000k lifetime&quot; is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nonsensical to anyone with familiarity. But any ad writer would eagerly
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;write &quot;one million cycles&quot; for any product - especially if he weren't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;burdened by knowledge of bikes or spokes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If they meant 1MM cycles at an extreme load, why no mention of that? If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that was intended, it's simple in English:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Our product will bear up to 1MM cycles of extreme load&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Our product sustained 1MM cycles of industry standard fatigue testing&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  &quot;Our competitor's product failed at merely 985,00 cycles&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;That is not what they wrote.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I was also curious about the smaller-section aero spoke showing 2.3x
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;longevity. That does not make any sense at all as _less_ material just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;couldn't bear _2.3x_ the load cycles. And the values are nice and round,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;too, 1,000,000 and 2,300,000. Convenient numbers, those, as they just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;happen to fit the price curve but do they relate to the actual product?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is not at all clear to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Andrew,

Actually, I did read the whole post, but I may have been misreading that

are not work hardened in that area (which is different from saying
that midsection strength has nothing to do with failure of elbows).

As I mentioned, I'd like to see an explanation of the strength results for
the Strong spokes, which appear inconsistent on the face of things. I
guess I'm hoping an expert can explain if the fact that the Strong is
drawn down slightly more than the Race (0.3 versus 0.2 mm) can compensate
for the advantage the Race has in being 0.2 mm thinner in its midsection.

Thanks for the info Carl, but my conclusion from this is that the test
is not a good representation of a wheel. In a well built wheel the
spoke elbow is not going to be moving around (changing angle)... and
if the spoke elbow isn't moving, then the bending moment of the middle
of the spoke is irrelevant. Didn't jim say the load cycle was 0-80kg?
Going to zero will surely amplify the elbow effect if it is not
completely in line with the load path. If it had been 50-150kg I'd be
more convinced. Under normal loads that a wheel sees, the spoke will
always be in tension and the elbow will be "stuck" in place. Sapim got
a results that favor low bending moments in the center of the spoke,
but I don't believe that has anything to do with reality. Unless Sapim
did something "magical" with the CX-Ray, it's real performance in a
wheel should be the same as the Laser. Reducing the cross section in
the middle of the spoke *does* help... but the bending moment is

that's not true.  it may not be obvious, but by definition, any loading
causes distortion, and any loading that is offset from the spokes main
axis is going to cause bending distortion.  the "support" offered the
hub flange depends on how close the contact of the spoke is, if at all,

what's "belief" got to do with it?  it's analysis of known facts that

&gt;&gt; The mere fact that it's a good thing that there's some bending going on
&gt;&gt; means that the natural spoke line inherent in the materials (elbow

&gt; The way I see it bending at the elbow is bad. Good spoke line at the

">

Because bending the spoke to yield introduces stresses (whether he would
call them residual or not I don't know) that he doesn't think stress
relieving removes.

Maybe this will make my main point more clear:

Imagine you have spokes with a perfect line -- they sit snugly in the
holes, hug closely to the flange as they exit the hub, and enter the
nipples at the same angle at which the nipples are seated in the rim. In
that case, where would the bending stress come from? In what way would it
matter if the spoke is straight gauge or butted? The spoke would change in
length as it is loaded and unloaded, but would it bend? (I confess that my
theory is all wet if such axial changes are considered bending.) Do
straight-pull, elbow-less spokes experience bending stress?

Both Jobst and "jim beam" agree that butted spokes have better fatigue
life, but Jobst ascribes it to something I don't think involves bending.
On page 47 of the Bicycle Wheel, he says:

"[T]he most valuable contribution of swaging is that peak stresses are
absorbed in the straight midsection rather than concentrated in the
threads and elbow, thereby substantially reducing fatigue failures. Swaged
spokes act like strain screws commonly used in high-performance machinery."

If I understand Jobst correctly, butted spokes give that benefit
whether they have elbows or are straight-pull, because both types of spoke
are subject to peak stresses as the wheel makes its revolutions.

I believe "jim beam" has agreed that butted spokes do absorb peak
stresses, but has said that the more important benefit of butted
spokes is that they reduce bending stresses. Where do those stresses come
from unless there is a problem with the spoke line?

He has repeatedly argued that if one builds wheels according to
manufacturer spec, the spoke line will be optimized. That can't be
completely true, or there would be no bending stresses that would
give butted spokes an advantage over straight-gauge spokes.

Now I suppose he can argue back that a slight misalignment is bad, but a
minor problem. That doesn't seem to be supported by the Sapim data, which
show a threefold increase in fatigue life in some cases, allegedly
because butted spokes reduce bending stresses.

Either Sapim's data is bad and/or jim beam's theory is bad (if you ask
me it's probably both).

gary, you need to understand a fundamental principle of mechanics: the
shortest distance between two points is a straight line.  with a spoke,
one end is /not/ anchored axial to the spoke, the straight line, it's
anchored about 3mm outboard.  no straight line means there fundamentally
/must/ be bending at the transition point, the spoke elbow.

now, if you understand that principle, think next on how to address the
/degree/ of bending.  one component of this, in addition to offset,
spoke diameter, material, etc., is the stiffness of the long part of the
spoke, because that's the bit against which the bending moment is
exerted.  if that too is stiff, the stress at the elbow can rise.  if
it's not, it can't.  obviously, skinny spokes offer much less resistance
to the bending moment, so stress doesn't rise as much, hence less fatigue.

That's not the way I see it. At the elbow and 30mm onwards, these

as much bending at the elbow, for a given tension, as a straight-gauge

The CX-Ray has a lesser cross-sectional area in the middle of the spoke then
the Race spoke, so for a given stress used in testing the elongation will be
greater there for the CX-Ray, and there will be less strain (in the
engineering sense) at the head of the spoke, which is where most spoke
breakages occur. Hence the greater expected life of the ligher spoke.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It is not at all clear to me.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Andrew,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's the data, culled from the Sapim site's individual pages,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ordered by cycles to failure:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;        64 x                            middle  test cycles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; model 260mm  hub x    middle   x rim  strength  to failure

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; strong 430g  2.3 x    2.0      x 2.0   1400    1,600,000
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; laser  279g  2.0 x    1.5      x 2.0   1500    1,250,000
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cx     423g  2.0 x (1.3 x 2.8) x 2.0   1200    1,220,000

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Note that the cycles to failure aren't all that rounded.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Judging by weight, the cxray aero spokes (278 grams) are probably
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flattened laser butted spokes (279 grams).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The cx aero spokes (423 grams) are probably flattened straight leader
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spokes (424 grams).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Since the round spokes are drawn to thin their midsections, their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; midsections work harden and strengthen, with the n/mm^2 strength
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rising (1080, 1350, 1500) as they grow thinner (2.0, 1.8, 1.5).

&gt;&gt;&gt;What does the strength of the middle section have to do with fatigue?

&gt;&gt; [snip]

&gt;&gt; Dear Gary,

&gt;&gt; Interspersed comments not only make further replies difficult, but
&gt;&gt; often reveal a reluctance to read the whole post:

&gt;&gt; &quot;The aero spokes also show greater midsection strength than the round
&gt;&gt; spokes from which they were probably stamped, again due to work
&gt;&gt; hardening, but this doesn't affect the unworked elbows where they
&gt;&gt; probably fail.&quot;

&gt;Actually, I did read the whole post, but I may have been misreading that
&gt;sentence as saying that spokes are vulnerable at the elbows because they
&gt;are not work hardened in that area (which is different from saying
&gt;that midsection strength has nothing to do with failure of elbows).

&gt;&gt; I was pointing out the consistency of the Sapim data. The more the
&gt;&gt; spokes are flattened or drawn, the greater the strength of their
&gt;&gt; mid-sections.

&gt;As I mentioned, I'd like to see an explanation of the strength results for
&gt;the Strong spokes, which appear inconsistent on the face of things. I
&gt;guess I'm hoping an expert can explain if the fact that the Strong is
&gt;drawn down slightly more than the Race (0.3 versus 0.2 mm) can compensate
&gt;for the advantage the Race has in being 0.2 mm thinner in its midsection.

&gt;&gt; Cheers,

Dear Gary,

The midsection strength and the fatigue resistance are probably
separate matters.

The Strong probably resists fatigue better because its elbow is 2.3 mm
thick, while the other spokes use 2.0 mm elbows.

As for midsection work-hardening strength increases, I suspect that
calculating the work-hardening effect of drawing different initial
spoke thicknesses down different amounts is trickier than a simple
comparison of raw mm reduction, or even of cross section.

For one thing, the different-thickness straight spoke blanks probably
start out with different initial strengths due to the work hardening
effect that got them to their initial size. That is, a 2.3 mm straight
spoke probably starts out with a different strength than a 2.0 mm
straight spoke.

Carl Fogel

Dear Johan,

The thick, identical 2.0 mm elbows must bend against some resistance.

If the resistance to bending in that plane is a straight spoke
section, then the resistance must be greater than if it is provided by
a blade angled for easy bending. This spreads the total stress out
over more material.

To exaggerate the effect, think of a spoke with a zig-zag elbow:

A                      A______________
/\_________  versus   /
/  B                  /

Elbows A &amp; B should last longer because the stress is spread out over
two bends, but the sharp angles would probably ruin things.

When the angles are scaled down to the almost imperceptible flexing of
a normal elbow and the round/blade junction, there seems to be a large
and measurable improvement in fatigue resistance over a round/round
junction.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

Perhaps, but the brochure I linked to in another reply says that the
Strong derives its advantage from fitting in the spoke holes more
snugly than spokes with thinner elbows. That suggests to me that the
fatigue profile of other Sapim spokes could be improved by using hubs
with smaller spoke holes.

Are you suggesting that the Strong spokes are work-hardened up from a

with a 2.3 mm wire and then draw down the thin section?

if you apply a 100lb load, you apply a 100lb load, regardless of how
much elasticity there is further up the line.  the difference in fatigue
lives /could/ come from greater elasticity in that it would affect how
the rim distorts and thus how much stress cycles for any individual
spoke, but that wouldn't affect fatigue life for a spoke in a testing
machine.  otoh, elbow bending is proven by the fact that spokes fatigue
there, so what can affect the reaction to bending moment and thus
fatigue life?  spoke bending stiffness.  that's why many pre-built [i.e.
researched and redesigned] wheels use straight pull spokes - eliminates
the bend.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think the distinction is between bending in the midsection and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bending at the elbow. If the spoke flexes a bit more at the midsection
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it can flex a bit less at the elbow. It's unlikely to fail at the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; midsection, and if it is able to flex there, is less likely to fail at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the elbow.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't see how that goes against my point.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I probably didn't understand your point.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The mere fact that it's a good thing that there's some bending going on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; means that the natural spoke line inherent in the materials (elbow
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bend, etc.) is not optimized.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure I understand it now.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The way I see it bending at the elbow is bad. Good spoke line at the
&gt;&gt;&gt; elbow (and correct shank length) reduces elbow bending. Flexible
&gt;&gt;&gt; midsection also reduces elbow bending.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now I thought your point was: correcting the spoke line will reduce
&gt;&gt;&gt; elbow flex in use, so why does jim beam tell us not to correct the spoke
&gt;&gt;&gt; line?

&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't think jim beam has ever denied that poor spoke line
&gt;&gt;&gt; (specifically spoke not flush) contributes to fatigue. It was from him
&gt;&gt;&gt; that I first heard about the long-shank problems with DT spokes. The
&gt;&gt;&gt; point is not that a good spoke line is not desirable, just how should it
&gt;&gt;&gt; be achieved: manually (thumb, crankarm, etc.), or just tension the
&gt;&gt;&gt; spokes and let them do their thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt; One thing though is that jim beam has said IIRC that premature spoke
&gt;&gt;&gt; line correction may actually promote fatigue. I'm less clear on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons for that.

&gt;&gt; Because bending the spoke to yield introduces stresses (whether he would
&gt;&gt; call them residual or not I don't know) that he doesn't think stress
&gt;&gt; relieving removes.

&gt;&gt; Maybe this will make my main point more clear:

&gt;&gt; Imagine you have spokes with a perfect line -- they sit snugly in the
&gt;&gt; holes, hug closely to the flange as they exit the hub, and enter the
&gt;&gt; nipples at the same angle at which the nipples are seated in the rim. In
&gt;&gt; that case, where would the bending stress come from? In what way would it
&gt;&gt; matter if the spoke is straight gauge or butted? The spoke would change in
&gt;&gt; length as it is loaded and unloaded, but would it bend? (I confess that my
&gt;&gt; theory is all wet if such axial changes are considered bending.) Do
&gt;&gt; straight-pull, elbow-less spokes experience bending stress?

&gt;&gt; Both Jobst and &quot;jim beam&quot; agree that butted spokes have better fatigue
&gt;&gt; life, but Jobst ascribes it to something I don't think involves bending.
&gt;&gt; On page 47 of the Bicycle Wheel, he says:

&gt;&gt; &quot;[T]he most valuable contribution of swaging is that peak stresses are
&gt;&gt; absorbed in the straight midsection rather than concentrated in the
&gt;&gt; threads and elbow, thereby substantially reducing fatigue failures. Swaged
&gt;&gt; spokes act like strain screws commonly used in high-performance machinery.&quot;

&gt;&gt; If I understand Jobst correctly, butted spokes give that benefit
&gt;&gt; whether they have elbows or are straight-pull, because both types of spoke
&gt;&gt; are subject to peak stresses as the wheel makes its revolutions.

&gt;&gt; I believe &quot;jim beam&quot; has agreed that butted spokes do absorb peak
&gt;&gt; stresses, but has said that the more important benefit of butted
&gt;&gt; spokes is that they reduce bending stresses. Where do those stresses come
&gt;&gt; from unless there is a problem with the spoke line?

&gt;&gt; He has repeatedly argued that if one builds wheels according to
&gt;&gt; manufacturer spec, the spoke line will be optimized. That can't be
&gt;&gt; completely true, or there would be no bending stresses that would
&gt;&gt; give butted spokes an advantage over straight-gauge spokes.

&gt;&gt; Now I suppose he can argue back that a slight misalignment is bad, but a
&gt;&gt; minor problem. That doesn't seem to be supported by the Sapim data, which
&gt;&gt; show a threefold increase in fatigue life in some cases, allegedly
&gt;&gt; because butted spokes reduce bending stresses.

&gt;&gt; Either Sapim's data is bad and/or jim beam's theory is bad (if you ask
&gt;&gt; me it's probably both).

&gt; gary, you need to understand a fundamental principle of mechanics: the

Is it not odd that people don't record the "actual" fatique test
results of these Sapim and other spokes. I find it strange that bike
enthusiasts don't club round and make a site that displays actual real
life tests on various spoke/build/rim combinations. You could have a
simple data base of rim, spoke and hand/machine build information
which has come from individual riders having actually riden these
combos.
I have just had a Sapim "Strong" 13 single butted spokes
and washered wheel, using a stainless steel double box section
westrick and Sturmey AW hub built up by Fairlight cycles. I'm going to
keep a log and see for definite how many miles i actually get. I have
just got 800 miles from a 13g terrible handbuild before spoke
breakage(with extremely light road riding), so that's my bench mark.
Wheel two is on 300 miles using a better builder and 14 DT straights.
Hopefully we'll see 1k this time round.

If someone wanted to end this apparently perpetual discussion over
spoke life, it would be great if a novice could go to a dedicated
website and look-up a section that tells him that if he uses x rim and
y spokes in conjuction with handbuild/machine build and a normal load,
then he should, on average expect z miles before spoke breakage.  I
realise there are numerous extraneous variables, but a rough average
would be possible for each combination. Maybe if that happened, some
of the spoke manufacturers would get miffed because real life would
show conclusively that their spokes are inferior.
I reckon it would save a lot of time for people so that they could
avoid making the same mistakes every time, though the bike industry
would probably suffer financially.
Has anyone actually tried this before and found a repeatable average
for any one particular spoke/rim combo?

In this configuration, assuming everything's perfect, I think you still
have bending, but the perpendicular distance from the force direction to
the fulcrum is half the diameter of the spoke, at the centre of the
spoke. Pulling on the spoke will result in compression on the inside of
the elbow and tension on the outside-- it is bending.

In reality though the moment is likely to be somewhat greater than this,
either due to less than perfect flushness, or due to a more complicated
shape (like a question-mark hook) near where the spoke exits the flange.

In the perfect or near-perfect situation, I would have thought no
bending at the midsection during loading and unloading provided the
spoke doesn't go slack. But you still have bending stresses at the
elbow.

If the spoke is unloaded so far that it goes slack, then it will bend--
pushing two ends of an unsupported wire together is "unstable" in the
sense that it will bend one way or another, not compress perfectly along
its length.

In that situation, being butted rather than PG might reduce elbow flex.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; him that I first heard about the long-shank problems with DT spokes.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The point is not that a good spoke line is not desirable, just how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; should it be achieved: manually (thumb, crankarm, etc.), or just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; tension the spokes and let them do their thing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One thing though is that jim beam has said IIRC that premature spoke
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; line correction may actually promote fatigue. I'm less clear on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons for that.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because bending the spoke to yield introduces stresses (whether he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would call them residual or not I don't know) that he doesn't think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stress relieving removes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe this will make my main point more clear:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Imagine you have spokes with a perfect line -- they sit snugly in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; holes, hug closely to the flange as they exit the hub, and enter the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nipples at the same angle at which the nipples are seated in the rim.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In that case, where would the bending stress come from? In what way
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would it matter if the spoke is straight gauge or butted? The spoke
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would change in length as it is loaded and unloaded, but would it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bend? (I confess that my theory is all wet if such axial changes are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; considered bending.) Do straight-pull, elbow-less spokes experience
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; bending stress?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Both Jobst and &quot;jim beam&quot; agree that butted spokes have better
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fatigue life, but Jobst ascribes it to something I don't think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; involves bending. On page 47 of the Bicycle Wheel, he says:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;[T]he most valuable contribution of swaging is that peak stresses
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are absorbed in the straight midsection rather than concentrated in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the threads and elbow, thereby substantially reducing fatigue
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; failures. Swaged spokes act like strain screws commonly used in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; high-performance machinery.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If I understand Jobst correctly, butted spokes give that benefit
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whether they have elbows or are straight-pull, because both types of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spoke are subject to peak stresses as the wheel makes its
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; revolutions.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I believe &quot;jim beam&quot; has agreed that butted spokes do absorb peak
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stresses, but has said that the more important benefit of butted
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spokes is that they reduce bending stresses. Where do those stresses
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; come from unless there is a problem with the spoke line?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; He has repeatedly argued that if one builds wheels according to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manufacturer spec, the spoke line will be optimized. That can't be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; completely true, or there would be no bending stresses that would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; give butted spokes an advantage over straight-gauge spokes.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Now I suppose he can argue back that a slight misalignment is bad,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; but a minor problem. That doesn't seem to be supported by the Sapim
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; data, which show a threefold increase in fatigue life in some cases,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; allegedly because butted spokes reduce bending stresses.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Either Sapim's data is bad and/or jim beam's theory is bad (if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ask me it's probably both).
&gt;&gt;&gt; gary, you need to understand a fundamental principle of mechanics: the
&gt;&gt;&gt; shortest distance between two points is a straight line.

&gt;&gt; Condescending lesson -- on geometry really, not mechanics -- duly noted
&gt;&gt; and then ignored as being an issue never in dispute.

&gt; no condescension.  if this concept is not understood, there can be no
&gt; analysis.  it cannot be ignored.

&gt;&gt; with a spoke,
&gt;&gt;&gt; one end is /not/ anchored axial to the spoke, the straight line, it's
&gt;&gt;&gt; anchored about 3mm outboard.

&gt;&gt; Yes, of course. That's why Jobst recommends correcting the spoke line.

&gt; no it's not - there's absolutely /nothing/ &quot;correcting the spoke line&quot;
&gt; does to address this fundamental concept.
">

Correcting the spoke line makes the spoke straighter along its unsupported
length. It brings the elbow-end of the spoke into closer conformity with
the hub flange, thus reducing the range of bending that's possible. It
seems to me that it has everything to do with the question at hand. If it
weren't important, why in the past have you emphasized so much the pains
that spoke makers take to ensure that spoke line is optimized?

I think you've unwittingly committed yourself to a position in which you
essentially agree with Jobst that misaligned spoke lines are a problem
even after tensioning and bedding-in. The difference is that Jobst thinks
that the line should be corrected by plastic deformation of the spoke,
whereas you think the elasticity of the middle section cushions the spokes
from the effects of misalignment. It seems to me that that puts you at
odds with -- or at least in tension with -- your earlier suggestions that
misalignment is not a problem if manufacturer specs are followed.

Furthermore, if you take the Sapim results at face value -- as you seem to
do -- then that calls into question your usual ranking of the magnitudes
of spoke problems. You've often suggested that spoke material dwarfs all
other considerations. Yet here is a case where some spokes last as much as
three times longer than other spokes made of the same material. If you're
right that bending stress is the real issue, then implicitly spoke
misalignment is the real issue and Jobst is right to be concerned with
that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;   no straight line means there fundamentally
&gt;&gt;&gt; /must/ be bending at the transition point, the spoke elbow.

&gt;&gt; There must be bending even if the elbow is supported by the flange all
&gt;&gt; along its length?
&gt; if it's loaded, yes.  that's why it fatigues there.  if it didn't bend
&gt; there, it wouldn't fatigue there.
">

This doesn't advance your case. No one disputes that many spokes fail
because of bending. The question is why some spoke don't fail. (And even
if all spokes eventually fail, the question is why some do so sooner than
others.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Please don't respond that the elbow is never perfectly supported by the
&gt;&gt; flange. I'm aware of that. What I want to know is if you really think
&gt;&gt; that there &quot;fundamentally /must/ be bending at the transition point.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &quot;Fundamentally must&quot; suggests that there will be bending even in ideal
&gt;&gt; conditions. Is that what you mean to say?

&gt; there's nothing &quot;ideal&quot; about it - the configuration of the piece means
&gt; it will bend at that point when any load is applied.  the only way to
&gt; eliminate bending is to have a spoke with no offset - a straight pull
&gt; spoke.
">

The only way I can make sense of what you're saying is if spokes bend even
when they can't move. Is that what you're saying?

Let me approach the ideal case in a different manner. Suppose I order some
custom spokes from Sapim. I tell them the hub and rim I'm going to use and
the crossing pattern.

They produce spokes that fit as snugly as possible in the spoke holes and
that curve in a way that precisely conforms to the shape of the flange (in
other words, no bedding-in or correction of the spoke line is needed). If
tension increases, bending that would make the elbow angle more acute is
going to be stopped by the presence of the flange material directly
adjacent to the spoke elbow. If tension decreases, the spoke will be
restrained from bending to a more obtuse angle by the tight fit at the
spoke hole that effectively clamps the spoke in place. Are you saying that
a decrease in tension will cause the spoke to bend even if the spoke hole
has no tolerance for movement? Will a relaxation of tension cause the
spoke to bend to a more obtuse angle than what it started with when it
left the Sapim factory? What bends and what causes the bending?

&gt;&gt;&gt; now, if you understand that principle, think next on how to address
&gt;&gt;&gt; the /degree/ of bending.  one component of this, in addition to
&gt;&gt;&gt; offset, spoke diameter, material, etc., is the stiffness of the long
&gt;&gt;&gt; part of the spoke, because that's the bit against which the bending
&gt;&gt;&gt; moment is exerted.  if that too is stiff, the stress at the elbow can
&gt;&gt;&gt; rise.  if it's not, it can't.  obviously, skinny spokes offer much
&gt;&gt;&gt; less resistance to the bending moment, so stress doesn't rise as much,
&gt;&gt;&gt; hence less fatigue.

A wheel can be made well or poorly. Well enough to

The one deficiency that a thoughtful and well executed

no gary - it's got nothing to do with "correcting the spoke line" so
don't put those words in my mouth.  you have to understand the
principles.  a straight line is the shortest distance between two
points.  a j-bend spoke does not take the straight line path between the
two loading points, it's offset.  not my much, only about 3mm, but
that's enough to create a bending moment.

i'm snipping the rest because it's pointless if the above is not understood.

hold on a second.  if you go to buy a spoke from your lbs, what do you
receive?  chances are, it's a spoke made by d.t., wheelsmith or sapim.
all are well made, utilize very high quality materials, and their use
has a significant impact on fatigue results.

now, compare that to r.b.t reports of spoke failures.  almost all are
from "pre-built" wheels with no-name spokes.  rebuilding with branded
spokes seems always followed by deafening silence, i.e. no further
breakages.

coincidence?

also bear in mind that these quality branded spokes have been ubiquitous
for about 30 years and have pretty much a lock on the domestic market -
there's not much data on rebuilds with off-brand spokes.

Dear Gary,

I'm baffled by your question.

Where do you see any suggestion that Strong spokes are work-hardened
"up from a smaller diameter"?

As I said, a 2.3 mm straight spoke blank probably starts out with a
different strength than a 2.0 mm straight spoke blank.

Both spokes have been drawn down from thicker original stock. The 2.0
mm spoke section must obviously be drawn down thinner than the 2.3 mm
spoke section.

In wire-drawing operations, the wire stock is repeatedly drawn down.
Since it work-hardens in the process, it eventually has to be annealed
before further drawing.

We don't know the initial state of the 2.3 mm straight spoke blank
before it was drawn down to a 2.0 midsection and rim end.

We do know what Sapim's strength tests measured.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel
