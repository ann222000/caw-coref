I am trying to UPGRADE BY BBS from COLOR 64 V8.0 to CENTIPEDE (seeing
how I have all the necessary CMD Hardware to run it with), but I have
NO IDEA of what a .lbr file is, much less of how to unconvert it to a
runnable 41/71/ or 81 disk drive!

So what I am looking for is someone that I can send the BLANK DISKS
to in the mail along with a few dollars for the &quot;trouble&quot; and have
them copy them for me and mail them back to me.

Whoever can help me out with this matter can contact me and we can
arrange it.

Thanks a lot!

Shoot, my formats docs are all over the place, all broken up with old
versions and no proper attributes. I really wish people knew where the
up-to-date source of these formats docs are stored:

Back in &quot;the day&quot; .LBR was a common format used to send multiple files via
modem as a single file.  I am sending you an email with a program attached
that will allow you to use your C128 to extract the files from an .LBR file.

Change is inevitable,
