A while back I posted an inquiry on this newsgroup about the Sanctuary
Classics takeover by Universal Music Group. I found out about this
when I went to their website and they said their mail-order service
was being discontinued. In addition, they haven't updated their
website since September. Does anyone have any information regarding
this takeover and if so, what the fate of the catalog might be? (I'm
mainly interested in the ASV Living Era series, incidentally.)

I would like to know this also. Living Era is the best label for
1900-1955 popular music. I own over 500 authentic CDs from this
series. If its curtains for this label, many unfinished projects like
Hits of 29-29 and 57-59 will not be published. Does anyone know the
title to AJA5051? I have made a list of titles in the Living Era
Series (it took years) and aja5051 is the only one I can't account for.

Living Era is, to all intents and purposes, dead.  Hardly surprising -
Universal, having bought Sanctuary Group and discovered that part of
their purchase was the largest re-issuer of out of copyright material
in the world, could scarcely continue with it after being one of the
major record companies which spent years unsuccessfully lobbying the
British government to press for an extension of the European copyright
laws to the ludicrous lengths extant in the USA.

There were a number of projects already completed (including several
for which I did the restoration and re-mastering)which will not now be
issued and, unless there is an unexpected change of plan, there will
be no re-pressing of back catalogue. The present distributors contract
expires in December so it is likely that at that time all remaining
stocks will be scrapped and the label gone forever.

So, the message is, if there are any Living Era CDs on your wants
list, you should try to get them right now.

Regarding AJA 5051, to the best of my knowledge, this was one of
several unissued numbers.

Dear Alan, You bear sad news indeed. British people are not used to
the predatory capitalism practiced by American companies. If a large
American company wants to take out a competitor , the first tack is to
use all its influence with courts, legislators, and regulators to
hobble the smaller company. If that doesn't work, they buy out the
competitor and close it down. Los Angeles once had a fine public
transportation system, the red car, which covered the territory. After
the war, Chevron and General Motors bought the system in order to shut
it down, and force people to ride GM busses burning Chevron gas.
That's still the case today. The same thing has apparently happended
to Living Era. However, Universal will have a hard time cramming
gangsta rap poison down the throats of of melodic music listeners.

The score is now final with Living Era. According to my research,
Living Era pressed 658 CDs in th AJA series, 1 in the AJD series (Ella
and Her Fellas), and 51 in the AJS series. The most difficult to find
are AJA5003 (George Formby - A Chip Off the Old Block),,  AJA5006 (Ted
Lewis - A Jazz Holiday), AJA5010 (Cliff Edwards - The Hottest Man in
Town), AJA 5018 (Jack Hylton - Jack's Back), AJA5019 (Elsie Carlyle -
That's Love), AJA5022 (Nick Lucas - The Singing Troubador), AJA5034
(Maurice Chavalier - Bravo Maurice), AJA5035 (Harry Roy - Hot Cha Ma
Cha Cha), AJA 5037 (Billy Cotton - Wakey, Wakey), AJA 5051 (I can't
account for this number), and AJA 5222 (Henry Hall- This is Henry
Hall).

One difficulty in finding these titles is that many were reissued with
variations as different products, and different product numbers,
sometimes with similar names.. Most sellers of Living Era CDs are
unknowledgable, and don't know the difference between the new and
former issues. For example, if you are looking for AJA 5022 (Nick
Lucas - The Singing Troubador) you will probably be offered AJA5329
(Nick Lucas - Tip Toe Through the Tulips) .

Ray Crick, Vic Bellerby, Peter Dempsey, and you performed an extremely
valuable artistic service by rounding up a lot of great music and
presenting it to latter day listeners. If I meet any of you,on the
street, lunch is on me.

With respect to Living Era,
