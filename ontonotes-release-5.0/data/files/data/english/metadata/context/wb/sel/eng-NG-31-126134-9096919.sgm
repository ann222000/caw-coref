Dreaming Big About Acting Big
By MELENA RYZIK
They came from Massachusetts, Florida, and Canada, and from Flatbush,
Crown Heights and Bed-Stuy. There were fur coats and fedoras, shades
and patterned Coogi sweaters, and enough extra poundage to tip a Mack
truck. On Saturday, nearly 100 people turned up on a quiet street in
Chelsea to audition for their chance to be B.I.G.

Arriving on foot, by Escalade or late-model sedan, men of all ages and
backgrounds - but mostly one body type - came for the open casting
call for &quot;Notorious,&quot; a biopic of the rapper Christopher G. Wallace,
better known as Biggie Smalls or Notorious B.I.G. The hunt for the
unknown star began online in August, when the Fox Searchlight studio
invited would-be Biggies to send audition tapes. &quot;Finding Biggie is
going to be a task in itself,&quot; Voletta Wallace, the rapper's mother
and a producer of the film, said in a video on Biggiecasting.com. Her
son, who died a decade ago, at 24, in a drive-by shooting in Los
Angeles, stood about 6 foot 3, weighed nearly 300 pounds, and had a
cocksure, easy-flowing but hard-to-imitate style.

&quot;Anyone who felt that they can fill that shoe, can do that swagger,
can try the lyrical tone, I'm welcoming them,&quot; Ms. Wallace said. And
on Saturday swagger, at least, was in great supply.

&quot;What I offer is the charm and charisma and comedic timing that Biggie
had,&quot; said Shawn Banks, 31, a 6-foot-3, 370-pound corporate compliance
officer and stand-up comedian from Titusville, Fla. &quot;In my mind - and
to my mother - I'm already famous.&quot;

For locals who grew up with the Biggie legacy - he was born and raised
in Brooklyn - the auditions were a chance to connect with an idol of
streets-to-riches opportunity. &quot;Right now I just rap, and I'm into the
block,&quot; said Terrance Burton, 27, of Brownsville, who filmed his
audition tape in front of Biggie's Brooklyn home. &quot;This might be the
way out.&quot;

Kenny Williams, 41, of Boston was the first to arrive, just after 8
a.m. By the time City Stages, a rehearsal space on West 19th Street,
opened around 10, there was a line of a few dozen people. But it
quickly dissipated as the hopefuls were patted down and brought in
small groups before casting agents, Ms. Wallace and Mark Pitts,
Biggie's manager and another producer of the film.

Each candidate was asked to do a few lines from &quot;Warning,&quot; a song
about the perils of fame from Biggie's 1994 debut album, &quot;Ready to
Die.&quot; But not everyone knew the words or could keep up, said Mr.
Burton, who did and could. Afterward he and others hung around, sizing
up the competition, talking to reporters and posing for photos in
multi-Biggie combinations of tough-guy stances.

Also, Tupac was there.

&quot;When you think about Biggie, you gotta say Tupac,&quot; said Josh Du Love,
27, a Bed-Stuy resident who came in the guise of Biggie's foe, Tupac
Shakur, complete with shaved head and bandanna. &quot;I said I'd come here,
try to start up some beef.&quot;

Instead Du Love, as he is known, a promoter and comedian, exchanged
numbers with some of the Biggies. Maybe they would shoot a video.

The look-alikes were pumped. Ray Louisma, 23, a native of Flatbush who
now lives in Irvington, N.J., and works in banking, listened to
Biggie's music and watched his videos closely for a week and a half to
prepare. &quot;I was looking at every aspect,&quot; he said. &quot;The way he talked,
the way he moved, the way he blinked his eyes. I spent like three
hours in the mirror trying to make my eyes look cross-eyed, because
sometimes Biggie looked like he was cross-eyed and sometimes he
didn't.&quot;

He added: &quot;I actually have a more of high-pitched voice than Biggie
does, because I sing. So I gave myself a cold: cold showers, slept
with the fan on so my voice would be a little deeper.&quot;

To standout from the gangsta crowd, Mr. Louisma wore a shiny black
suit, a black-on-black shirt and tie, a tilted Fedora and a silver
chain.

&quot;Biggie wasn't all street,&quot; he explained. &quot;Biggie was about his paper,
about making his money.&quot;

Mr. Louisma's thoughtful dedication earned him a callback, though at 6
foot 2, and with a recent weight loss taking him from 402 to 280
pounds he would be a bit on the scrawny side.

Other potential Biggies preferred a looser approach. &quot;I didn't have to
study him that much,&quot; said Kenneth Washington, 21, a look-alike who
came in a black Coogi sweater, sunglasses and black vest. &quot;He laid
back, I laid back. He dropped out of high school, I dropped out of
high school. But I went back.&quot;

Could he throw some rhymes? &quot;That's the only problem,&quot; Mr. Washington,
a club bouncer from Bed-Stuy, said. &quot;If I don't get it, I hope
somebody gets it from Brooklyn.&quot;

But perhaps geographic or stylistic verisimilitude isn't that
important. One of the last would-be Biggies was Jeffrey Kyei, 20, a
musician and producer who had driven all night from Toronto,
accompanied by his manager, to audition.

&quot;I wasn't really trying to come on the Biggie look,&quot; said Mr. Kyei,
whose white T-shirt was stained with Red Bull and who had a distinctly
Canadian accent. &quot;I wanted to come with who I am. Plus, I came from a
club last night - just getting into my swagger.&quot;

He got a callback.

Why don't they just hire the kid who played him in the &quot;Sky's the
Limit&quot; video? Â He was brilliant, and probably old enough by now (old
as that makes me feel...)
