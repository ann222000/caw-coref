In a Shift, Bush Moves to Block Medical Suits
By ROBERT PEAR

WASHINGTON, July 24 â€” The Bush administration has been going to court
to block lawsuits by consumers who say they have been injured by
prescription drugs and medical devices.

The administration contends that consumers cannot recover damages for
such injuries if the products have been approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. In court papers, the Justice Department acknowledges
that this position reflects a &quot;change in governmental policy,&quot; and it
has persuaded some judges to accept its arguments, most recently
scoring a victory in the federal appeals court in Philadelphia.

Allowing consumers to sue manufacturers would &quot;undermine public
health&quot; and interfere with federal regulation of drugs and devices, by
encouraging &quot;lay judges and juries to second-guess&quot; experts at the
F.D.A., the government said in siding with the maker of a heart pump
sued by the widow of a Pennsylvania man. Moreover, it said, if such
lawsuits succeed, some good products may be removed from the market,
depriving patients of beneficial treatments.

In 2002, at a legal symposium, the Bush administration outlined plans
for &quot;F.D.A. involvement in product liability lawsuits,&quot; and it has
been methodically pursuing that strategy.

The administration's participation in the cases is consistent with
President Bush's position on &quot;tort reform.&quot;

Mr. Bush often attacks trial lawyers, saying their lawsuits impose a
huge burden on the economy and drive up health costs. The Democrats'
vice-presidential candidate, Senator John Edwards, a longtime
plaintiffs' lawyer, says his proudest accomplishment in Washington was
to help win Senate passage of a bill defining patients' rights,
including the right to sue. (The bill never became law.)

Jay P. Lefkowitz, former director of Mr. Bush's Domestic Policy
Council, said the F.D.A.'s litigation strategy embodied &quot;good health
policy and good tort reform.&quot;

But Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, Democrat of New York, said the
administration had &quot;taken the F.D.A. in a radical new direction,
seeking to protect drug companies instead of the public.&quot; Mr. Hinchey
recently persuaded the House to cut $500,000 from the budget of the
agency's chief counsel as a penalty for its aggressive opposition to
consumer lawsuits.

In the Pennsylvania ruling, issued Tuesday, the appeals court threw
out a lawsuit filed by Barbara E. Horn, who said her husband had died
because of defects in the design and manufacture of his heart pump.
The Bush administration argued that federal law barred such claims
because the device had been produced according to federal
specifications. In its briefs, the administration conceded that &quot;the
views stated here differ from the views that the government advanced
in 1997,&quot; in the United States Supreme Court.

At that time, the government said that F.D.A. approval of a medical
device set the minimum standard, and that states could provide
&quot;additional protection to consumers.&quot; Now the Bush administration
argues that the agency's approval of a device &quot;sets a ceiling as well
as a floor.&quot;

The administration said its position, holding that individual
consumers have no right to sue, actually benefited consumers.

The threat of lawsuits, it said, &quot;can harm the public health&quot; by
encouraging manufacturers to withdraw products from the market or to
issue new warnings that overemphasize the risks and lead to
&quot;underutilization of beneficial treatments.&quot;

Allison M. Zieve, a lawyer at the Public Citizen Litigation Group who
represented the plaintiff in the Pennsylvania case, said, &quot;The
government has done an about-face on this issue.&quot; If courts accept the
administration's position, Ms. Zieve said, it would amount to a
backdoor type of &quot;tort reform&quot; that would shield manufacturers from
damage suits.

In the Pennsylvania case, the federal appeals court quoted extensively
from the administration's brief and said the views of the F.D.A. were
entitled to great deference because the agency was &quot;uniquely
qualified&quot; to determine when federal law should take precedence over
state law.

Bush administration officials said their goal was not to shield drug
companies, but to vindicate the federal government's authority to
regulate drug products.

Patients and their families said they felt betrayed.

Kimberley K. Witczakof Minneapolis said her husband, Timothy, 37,
committed suicide last year after taking the antidepressant drug
Zoloft for five weeks. &quot;I do not believe in frivolous lawsuits,&quot; Ms.
Witczak said, &quot;but it's ridiculous that the government is filing legal
briefs on the side of drug companies when it's supposed to be
protecting the public. My husband would be alive today if he had
received adequate warnings about the risk of self-harm.&quot; Ms. Witczak
sued Pfizer, the maker of Zoloft, in May. The government has not
intervened in her case.

Thomas W. Woodward of North Wales, Pa., whose 17-year-old daughter
committed suicide last year after taking Zoloft for a week, said,
&quot;I've been sickened to see the government taking the side of
pharmaceutical companies in court.&quot; Mr. Woodward has not filed a suit.

Mr. Hinchey said that F.D.A. lawyers, led by the agency's chief
counsel, Daniel E. Troy, had &quot;repeatedly interceded in civil suits on
behalf of drug and medical device manufacturers.&quot;

Ms. Witczak, Mr. Woodward and Mr. Hinchey said Mr. Troy had a
potential conflict of interest because Pfizer was one of his clients
when he was a lawyer in private practice.

Mr. Troy refused to discuss the agency's legal arguments or the
criticism of his role. Dr. Lester M. Crawford, the acting commissioner
of food and drugs, said Mr. Troy had &quot;complied with the ethical
requirement to recuse himself from any matter involving a past client
for a year&quot; after he joined the government in August 2001.

In its court filings, the Bush administration argues that private
lawsuits threaten to disrupt a comprehensive nationwide system of drug
regulation, and that federal standards pre-empt requirements
established by state judges and legislators. In effect, the
administration says, if a local judge or jury finds that a drug or
device is unsafe, it is in direct conflict with the conclusion reached
by the F.D.A. after years of rigorous testing and evaluation.

Five of Mr. Troy's predecessors sent a letter to Congress dated July
15 endorsing his position. The government occasionally filed such
briefs in the last 25 years, they said, but &quot;there is a greater need
for F.D.A. intervention today because plaintiffs are intruding more
heavily on F.D.A.'s primary jurisdiction than ever before.&quot;

Some judges and legal experts disagree. Erwin Chemerinsky,a
constitutional scholar at the University of Southern California Law
School, said, &quot;The Supreme Court has expressly ruled that F.D.A.
regulation does not pre-empt state law and local regulation&quot; in all
cases.

In a Tennessee case involving a cardiac pacemaker, the Bush
administration told a state trial court, &quot;It is inappropriate for a
jury to second-guess F.D.A.'s scientific judgment on a matter that is
within F.D.A.'s particular expertise.&quot;

If juries in different states reach different conclusions about the
risks and benefits of a medical device, they will cause &quot;chaos for the
regulated industry and F.D.A.,&quot; the administration said.

The administration has also joined Pfizer in opposing a lawsuit filed
by Flora Motus, a California woman who said her husband had committed
suicide after taking Zoloft. Mrs. Motus argued that Pfizer had not
adequately warned doctors and patients that the drug could increase
the risk of suicide.

But the Bush administration said that when federal officials approved
Zoloft, they saw no need for such a warning, and that a false or
unnecessary warning could &quot;deprive patients of beneficial, possibly
life-saving treatment.&quot; Susan B. Bro, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said
this week, &quot;There is no scientific evidence of a causal relationship
between Zoloft and suicide.&quot;

Likewise, the administration intervened in a California case to help
GlaxoSmithKline fend off consumer demands for restrictions on the
advertising of Paxil. The government said the restrictions &quot;would
overly deter use of a life-improving medication.&quot;

Patients had persuaded a federal district judge to order a halt to
television advertisements that declared, &quot;Paxil is non-habit forming.&quot;
The administration joined the manufacturer in challenging that order.
The judge, Mariana R. Pfaelzer, lifted the injunction in 2002 for
other reasons, but said the administration's arguments were
unpersuasive and contrary to the public interest.

It is about time something is done about the rape of us consumers by lawyers
like Edwards. I doubt that President Bush will be able to get this passed.
The lawyers have the Dems in their pockets.

"/> Yes, well, of course those insurance companies would never lie to us
about the impact of malpractice awards on their pricing decisions.

And of course you've thoroughly evaluated the other factors affecting
insurers' costs, including advances in equipment, cost of prescription
drugs, consolidation of hospitals resulting in greater leverage to
negotiate higher insurance payments, inflation, increased government
regulation and mandated coverages, increased consumer demand, reduced
investment income, etc.

"/>  Not that I disagree with Rick much,

but I see medical malpractice lawsuits as a major problem and one of the
significant USA-specific factors as to why the USA spends so much more on
healthcare than do the countries with nationalized healthcare.

In my USA &quot;state&quot; (province) of Pennsylvania, there is major debate on
this issue. Nobody is proposing any limits or new constraints against
suing and collecting for actual damages. The debate has been confined to
&quot;non-economic damages&quot; such as pain-and-suffering.

In Pennsylvania, the sides have been polarized between &quot;all&quot; vs.
&quot;nothing&quot;. As in a $250,000 cap on non-economic damages or no cap at all.
The Philadelphia Daily News appararently did not go far by proposing a
&quot;middle ground&quot;, namely $250,000 adjusted for inflation from the time when
California got their $250,000 cap on non-economic damages - approx.
$900,000 to maybe closer to $1 million now.

------------------------------------------------------------------

In all fairness, I must mention some other facts:

1. Careful doctors in Pennsylvania pay as much for malpractice
insurance as bad lousy careless doctors do.

2. I saw some statistics on malpractice suits in Pennsylvania,
specifically as in terms of percentages of doctors losing a malpractice
claim never, once and more-than-once.
From this, it appears to me that about half of all malpractice claims in
Pennsylvania occurred because they were in counties that have a
disproportionate share of malpractice claims, were against doctors in
professions that suffer a disproportionate share of malpractice claims, or
were expected and predictable from knowing how random probabilities work.

This means that as much as half of PA's malpractice claims exist
legitimately and these could be reduced if bad doctors have to clean up
their act or else pay more for malpractice insurance or find a different
line of work.
This also means that maybe half of Pennsylvania's med-mal lawsuits are
not a result of bad doctors - some are random while many are examples of
need for &quot;tort reform&quot;.

3. Pennsylvania's counties vary wildly in jury generosity. Philadelphia
is famously hard on doctors and physicians that are defendants, while only
a couple counties to the west a doctor that fails to order an MRI or a CT
scan and scan analysis by a neurologist on a pea-size &quot;white spot&quot; in the
brain of a car crash victim successfully defends against a lawsuit after
the next day the &quot;pea-size spot&quot; is bigger than a golf ball and causes
brain damage that disables a phi-beta-kappa! (If I remember this
correctly).

Pennsylvania did implement a reform that reduces jury-shopping by county
by plaintiffs, although this was recent enough that pretty soon (not yet)
this will have whatever effect this will have.

----------------------------------------------------------

Keep in mind that taxes on businesses are taxes on the individuals that
own them, the individuals that work for them, their customers and their
suppliers.

The owners/shareholders are all too often your and my IRA and your/my
401K plan.

If you want a heavy tax on &quot;corporate fat cats&quot;, then tax them through
targeted individual taxes rather than through corporate/business taxes.

"/>  You may &quot;see&quot; that but it is untrue. When TPM started, there were
insurance experts here who debunked that far right-wing view. Overall, the
medical-industrial complex spends no more on insurance than a private person
does, in percentage terms. A few fields have high rates. That is a market
problem, because physicians are using a business model of 1900 whereby each
physicians purchases insurance as a private individual. It is like having
factory workers each buying product liabilty insurance as an individual.

Let me ask you this: How are you going to do away with the jury when our
Constitution guarantees a jury trial, at least in federal courts, in all
suits at common law, pursuant to the 7th Amendment? Here's what the 7th
says:

AMENDMENT VII.
Right of trial by jury.
In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty
dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by
a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States,
than according to the rules of the common law.

This amendment has not yet been applied to the states by incorporation, but
I don't know of any state which does not guarantee its citizens due process
of law by jury trial in negligence suits. Do you?

&gt;&gt; Glad you asked. Juries are not competent to judge complex medical
&gt;&gt; malpractice cases.

&gt; Oh, but YES they are. All the parties in a medical malpractice case are
&gt; entitled to bring in expert medical testimony. Hypothetical questions
may
&gt; be asked and the experts can give their opinions. Who are you trying to
&gt; kid? Do you think American juries are stupid? They are not, and often
&gt; they return verdicts for the defense.

&gt; Let me ask you this: How are you going to do away with the jury when our
&gt; Constitution guarantees a jury trial, at least in federal courts, in all
&gt; suits at common law, pursuant to the 7th Amendment? Here's what the 7th
&gt; says:

&gt; AMENDMENT VII.
&gt; Right of trial by jury.
&gt; In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty
&gt; dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried
by
&gt; a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States,
&gt; than according to the rules of the common law.

&gt; This amendment has not yet been applied to the states by incorporation,
but
&gt; I don't know of any state which does not guarantee its citizens due
process
&gt; of law by jury trial in negligence suits. Do you?

"/>  Many hospitals today make a patient sign a waiver form that they will
take everything to arbitration. Duke University uses this form. That gets
rid of judges, juries and patient rights all at the same time.

&gt; That's what medical experts are for.

&gt;&gt; Instead of using juries, we should use a 3-judge panel
&gt;&gt; that receives *objective* input from unbiased, blinded medical experts
&gt;&gt; hired by the courts (not lawyers) and actuaries who provide data on the
&gt;&gt; cost of providing care for an injured person over the course of their
&gt;&gt; expected life. Make payments for as long as the person lives, but not
&gt;&gt; longer, and deny lump-sum payments. Make patients (or caregivers) who
&gt;&gt; have won cases prove that they are spending their award on appropriate
&gt;&gt; care.

&gt; Should we make insurance companies &quot;prove&quot;
&gt; that they aren't raising premiums just to cover
&gt; their investment losses?

&gt;&gt; Remove the contingency fees and let lawyers work for an hourly
&gt;&gt; wage like everyone else.

&gt; Does mean all doctors should work for hourly
&gt; rates and not get kickbacks from HMO's and drug
&gt; companies they invest in?

"/> This is almost too fun. Doctors do not receive kickbacks from HMOs and drug
companies. If so, it's illegal. I know over 400 physicians and not one has
ever received a &quot;kickback&quot; from a pharmaceutical company or HMO or pharmacy
or hospital. (Don't tell me a turkey sandwich at lunch is a kickback).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Cap punitive awards at a reasonable amount.

&gt; How about capping doctors fees at a reasonable amount?

"/> I'm surprised you do not know that doctor's fees ARE capped. HMOs and
government insurers (Medicaid and Medicare) cap fees. It doesn't matter if
I charge a million dollars to deliver a baby, Medicaid is only going to pay
a fixed fee, that doesn't change regardless of the time it takes and the
complexity of the situation. Do lawyers charge a one-shot, flat fee for
services? Physician's fees for many procedures are at 1970's levels. The
amount we receive for a hysterectomy is one-fourth what we received in 1982.
The reimbursement problems facing physicians has led to many physicians
bailing out for other careers. Note the recent article regarding the
reduction of fees for office-based chemotherapy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; Allow the judges to distribute appropriate punishment to those

&gt; So you want judges to punish doctors but not
&gt; juries? So much for the rant against &quot;judicial
&gt; activism&quot;...........

"/> Yes. I want unbiased judges who are not moved by theatrics to punish
doctors. Who says their punishment would not be harsher than a jury? You
realize that lawyers hire jury experts to help pick jurors. How can a
system that utilizes experts to handpick jury members be fair?!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt;&gt; This would be a fair system. It provides justice to
&gt;&gt; patients who have been harmed, protection for physicians from frivolous
&gt;&gt; or without-merit claims, and allows lawers to make a good living without
&gt;&gt; raping the system. Why would anyone disagree?

&gt; Funny you accuse lawyers of &quot;raping the system&quot;
&gt; but have no complaints against doctors who make
&gt; careers out of testifying for insurance companies.

"/> I didn't mention it because it was irrelevant to my discussion. But since
you mention it, I do disagree with &quot;hired gun&quot; physicians who testify to
anything but the truth. I have been deposed a few times regarding alleged
negligence both on behalf of patients and against physicians. Regardless of
who asked me to review the case, I always testified to the facts. If more
experts behaved this way, then you are correct, we would not have such a big
problem. Note that I believe the patient and defendent physician suffer the
most harm from our system. Doctors and their defense teams jump through
hoops to persuade juries that harm did not occur, when sometimes it
certainly has, and malpractice lawyers will leave no stone unturned to prove
negligence even when negligence clearly did not occur. The system is
extraordinarily dysfunctional. It takes years to get a case to trial,
thousands of dollars are spent on &quot;experts,&quot; who may be biased towards one
side, and lawyers try to pick and choose jurors who will rule their way.
Why not work to improve it so that it is more fair to those who have been
injured and those who have been unfairly accused?

But was this due to an error, a slip, or even a misjudgment
by the doctor?

Here is one which I consider improper awards. There is a
hormone which is known to reduce miscarriages in cows. Many
years ago, it was used to treat women prone to miscarriages.
It produced major effects in their daughters, including
cancer and infertility. In the lawsuits, it was claimed
that the tendency to miscarry was also not reduced, and
substantial judgments were made against the company.

Now, who is at fault? The drug was already on the market
for cows, and the company certainly was not making a mint
from the few women who used it. Is there any way they
could have known how well it would work on people, or that
bad effects would result decades later?

BTW, it has been found in criminal trials that &quot;beyond a

&gt;Oh, but YES they are. All the parties in a medical malpractice case are

reasoning is not involved.

Yes. Neither they nor most of the experts understand
probabilistic problems, and these are often the ones
involved in medical cases. They can understand that
a tree falling on a car is an &quot;act of God&quot;, but not
that a child whose delivery is overseen by an expert
obstetrician who has cerebral palsy is likewise.

They are not, and often

"/> That is true. But even those cost the defendants
thousands of dollars. An insurance company may agree
to settle a case out of court, paying off big, because
it might cost it even more to successfully defend that
case in a court.

"/> Clearly, that was a big mistake. Or maybe the defense didn't
understand the statistical errors in the prosecution's case,
particularly Dershowitz's argument that there's no evidence that
domestic violence leads to murder.

Here's his argument, let's see how many of you can poke holes in it:

According to FBI reports, there were 2.5-4 million incidents of
domestic abuse in 1992. During that period, 913 women were killed by
their husbands and 519 were killed by their boyfriends, for a total of
1,432 killed. Therefore, according to Dershowitz, &quot;an infinitesimal
percentage - certainly fewer than one in 2,500 - of men who beat their
domestic partners go on to murder them.&quot;

"/> Thanks for the comments. Over the years I have read your posts and quite
often have agreed with your statements that, for example, &quot;educated laymen
could evaluate the evidence&quot; and that educated patients can make informed
decisions if informed consent is presented appropriately. I think that you
overestimate the ability of the &quot;average&quot; person to evaluate the
complexities of a medical malpractice case. Most people don't have your
analytical thought process and desire for factual evidence and statistical
probabilities. You have said here many times that our educational system is
inadequate. I agree: most average citizens do not have much scientific
education. Many people cannot answer simple science questions. Why would
we assume they will be able to assess DNA evidence in a murder trial, or
determine whether a patient in septic shock and renal failure should have
had a full dose of gentamycin due to a raging infection, or a partial dose
due to kidney failure?

I could cite dozens of cases where juries were presented with unopposed
expert opinion that a physician did nothing wrong. But, the jurors decided
that the patient &quot;deserved something&quot; because they have to live with a
deficit, therefore they awarded the patient millions of dollars. One that
comes to mind is a case where a child developed laryngeal condlyoma (warts)
after a vaginal delivery. There is absolutely no evidence that c/section
will prevent this, and the major ob/gyn organizations have stated repeatedly
that c/sections are not indicated for patients with genital warts. In
addition, there are a number of babies with laryngeal papillomatosis who
were born to women by cesearean, and the virus causing this has been
isolated in amniotic fluid, showing that it can be infectious well before
delivery. Despite this, juries have awarded verdicts against doctors for
not performing c/sections. You would have to perform millions of c/sections
to prevent a case of laryngeal papillomatosis. Still, juries ignore this
and proceed bases on emotion. THIS is why I believe the current system is
so dysfunctional. Take the emotions out of law and put decisions in the
hands of people trained to be objective. Thanks,

&gt;&gt; dropped.

&gt; On the other hand, corporate/government projects have destroyed large areas
&gt; when they were unopposed; polluted areas that will affect us for years- and
&gt; done so for completely commercial purposes, without cleaning up after
&gt; themselves, leaving it for us to do.

&gt;&gt; Contrast this to the situation in Canada where a group
&gt;&gt; of farmers tried to block a dam. There was a big
&gt;&gt; judgment against them when they lost.

&gt; So you would close access to the courthouse to the poor, and allow SLAPP
&gt; suits to cover the ass of anyone who has enough money to fund retaliatory
&gt; actions?

"/> The ecofreaks mentioned above should be sanctioned under SLAPP.
If the farmers had a legitimate complaint, I don't feel they
should be required to pay legal fees, even if they lost.

There are problems with both systems.

trial judge at the end of the evidence NOT to assume anything, to put
together what they have learned from hearing the evidence (and the law
arising on the evidence) and decide whether the plaintiff has tipped the
scales.

By the way, I remember the controversy over this drug when it was being
given to women before all the damage began to show up. It was condemned in
knowledgeable quarters long before the children of women who took it found
out they had been maimed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insurance rates have dropped in the slightest?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not a chance..........
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course not, since the &quot;problem&quot; of frivilous lawsuits, like other

&gt;vastly

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Plaintiffs either have sufficient evidence to prove malpractice or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they don't, and in the vast majority of cases they do.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a pretty naive view of the world. Do you really think jury
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decisions are based on evidence?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually they are. But if you don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; like the jury system, what is your alternative?

"/>&lt;&gt;&gt;Glad you asked. Juries are not competent to judge complex medical
&lt;&gt;&gt;malpractice cases. It's like you or I trying to judge whether it was an
&lt;&gt;&gt;O-ring or a booster flange or a left gangley sprocket that caused a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;shuttle

"/>&lt;&gt;&gt;crash.

&lt;&gt; I believe an educated layman could evaluate the evidence.

&lt;&gt; Instead of using juries, we should use a 3-judge panel that receives
&lt;&gt;&gt;*objective* input from unbiased, blinded medical experts hired by the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;courts

"/>&lt;&gt;&gt;(not lawyers) and actuaries who provide data on the cost of providing

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;care

"/>&lt;&gt;&gt;for an injured person over the course of their expected life.

&lt;&gt; We have more complicated considerations. Since there are
&lt;&gt; many other probabilistic considerations than expected life,
&lt;&gt; and for an injured person, an award for expected life can
&lt;&gt; be woefully inadequate, more is needed. The judges are
&lt;&gt; also not capable of understanding the probabilistic
&lt;&gt; problems involved; indeed, someone like me would have to
&lt;&gt; use computers to evaluate the various alternatives which
&lt;&gt; would be proposed.

&lt;&gt; I believe that in the Simpson case, the defense deliberately
&lt;&gt; did not use their statistics expert, because the prosecution
&lt;&gt; expert made outlandish statements. With the more reasonable
&lt;&gt; conservative explanation, it might well have carried weight.

&lt;&gt; Make payments
&lt;&gt;&gt;for as long as the person lives, but not longer, and deny lump-sum

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;payments.

"/>&lt;&gt;&gt;Make patients (or caregivers) who have won cases prove that they are

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;and

"/>&lt;&gt;&gt;let lawyers work for an hourly wage like everyone else. Cap punitive

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&lt;&gt; This is one very bad feature of the present juries. If they
&lt;&gt; decide that a manufacturing decision saved the company 6 billion
&lt;&gt; dollars, they would award anyone injured from it that full
&lt;&gt; amount, even if the decision saved 100 lives.

&lt;&gt; Allow the judges to distribute appropriate
&lt;&gt;&gt;punishment to those physicians or hospitals that make mistakes, so that
&lt;&gt;&gt;negligent physicians and hospitals do not escape if remediation or

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&lt;&gt;&gt;raping the system. Why would anyone disagree?

&lt;&gt;&gt;Ashley
&lt;&gt;&gt;D. Ashley Hill, MD

&lt;&gt; Other than the comments I have made, I agree. But the
&lt;&gt; medical profession has to cooperate here, and make it clear
&lt;&gt; that there are things not known, and that in many cases
&lt;&gt; there are a large number of random causes and effects,
&lt;&gt; mostly not controllable. We MUST think in terms of the
&lt;&gt; choices, and probabilities, and understand that there is
&lt;&gt; no one correct decision for all.

&lt;&gt; The present consent forms are atrocious, and few doctors
&lt;&gt; come close to presenting the probabilities of the quite
&lt;&gt; numerous alternatives. But without that, there is no
&lt;&gt; way the patient can make an intelligent choice.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Thanks for the comments. Over the years I have read your posts and quite
&gt;often have agreed with your statements that, for example, &quot;educated laymen
&gt;could evaluate the evidence&quot; and that educated patients can make informed
&gt;decisions if informed consent is presented appropriately. I think that you
&gt;overestimate the ability of the &quot;average&quot; person to evaluate the
&gt;complexities of a medical malpractice case. Most people don't have your
&gt;analytical thought process and desire for factual evidence and statistical
&gt;probabilities. You have said here many times that our educational system is
&gt;inadequate. I agree: most average citizens do not have much scientific
&gt;education. Many people cannot answer simple science questions. Why would
&gt;we assume they will be able to assess DNA evidence in a murder trial, or
&gt;determine whether a patient in septic shock and renal failure should have
&gt;had a full dose of gentamycin due to a raging infection, or a partial dose
&gt;due to kidney failure?
&gt;I could cite dozens of cases where juries were presented with unopposed
&gt;expert opinion that a physician did nothing wrong. But, the jurors decided
&gt;that the patient &quot;deserved something&quot; because they have to live with a
&gt;deficit, therefore they awarded the patient millions of dollars. One that
&gt;comes to mind is a case where a child developed laryngeal condlyoma (warts)
&gt;after a vaginal delivery. There is absolutely no evidence that c/section
&gt;will prevent this, and the major ob/gyn organizations have stated repeatedly
&gt;that c/sections are not indicated for patients with genital warts. In
&gt;addition, there are a number of babies with laryngeal papillomatosis who
&gt;were born to women by cesearean, and the virus causing this has been
&gt;isolated in amniotic fluid, showing that it can be infectious well before
&gt;delivery. Despite this, juries have awarded verdicts against doctors for
&gt;not performing c/sections. You would have to perform millions of c/sections
&gt;to prevent a case of laryngeal papillomatosis. Still, juries ignore this
&gt;and proceed bases on emotion. THIS is why I believe the current system is
&gt;so dysfunctional. Take the emotions out of law and put decisions in the
&gt;hands of people trained to be objective. Thanks,

"/> No, I do not overestimate the ability of the &quot;average&quot;
person; the present public schools make it difficult even
for the bright to become really educated, and the &quot;new
math&quot; debacle showed clearly the inability of the teachers
to be able to understand conceptual material.

There is another reason, and the government and also the
schools have added to this; the idea that ONLY experts
can make decisions, and that all &quot;certified&quot; experts are
qualified to do so. The medical profession has not done
anything to discourage this, and much to reinforce it.
This is one reason why juries will award such damages;
the experts are supposed to be able to prevent such cases
from occurring. The expert involved did not, and thus
must bear responsibility.

The public schools are effectively non-remediable until the
current experts are completely removed, and it is worse
than that. Furthermore, most people have become serfs,
which means they expect the government to take care of them,
and do not feel they must make decisions themselves. Also,
they expect miracles; you and I know that we cannot provide
for all the medical care which we would want for ourselves;
the resources and knowledge are not there. But we keep
seeing statements such as, &quot;If they can put a man on the
moon, why can't they cure cancer?&quot;

Should people this ignorant decide on those who will run
anything? We cannot perform miracles, but we can learn
more about how the universe operates, and use this for
our benefit.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Not that I disagree with Rick much,

&gt;&gt;&gt;significant USA-specific factors as to why the USA spends so much more on
&gt;&gt;&gt;healthcare than do the countries with nationalized healthcare.

&gt;&gt;The proximate cause isn't the ability to sue a doctor who makes a
&gt;&gt;mistake, it's the ability of doctors who are so incompetent that they
&gt;&gt;make mistakes to continue practicing.

&gt; A major problem is that of people who believe that any bad
&gt; result MUST BE due to incompetence or error.

&gt; I believe that some other countries have laws which result
&gt; in major financial consequences to the losers of lawsuits
&gt; filed because of things like this, and others such as
&gt;&quot;political&quot; considerations. Here, ecofreaks have stopped

"/> I agree that the jury system is terribly flawed. I know someone who's a
judge in Pennsylvania and I asked him about it. All I got was a shrug.
The best kind of judicial reform would be to do away with the jury
system for civil cases and instead, set up an arbitration system with
experts from a variety of fields who are paid by the state, not the
plaintiffs or defendants. Doing away with jury trials for civil cases
would go much further than restricting individuals' tort rights.

I am also not convinced that medical doctors are suffering due to
malpractice insurance. I have a friend who's a pediatrician in
Pennsylvania. He's doing extremely well. This guy is in his middle
thirties, single, lives in a huge house that he bought new about three
years ago. This fellow travels all over the states and Europe, and he
eats out many nights each month even though he has a fancy gourmet
kitchen. One of my dad's long-time clients is an ob/gyn in Pennsylvania.
This guy lives quite well too. He lives in a Philadelphia suburb in a
huge house that even has an indoor pool, huge recreation room, four huge
bedrooms, and a gourmet kitchen. Every three years, he leases a fancy
luxury car, typically a Mercedes. He's not suffering either from the
malpractice insurance situation in Pennsylvania and he's in one of those
medical fields that is viewed as high risk. I have been to both doctors'
houses several times.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here in Texas the public has passed into
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; law every &quot;tort reform&quot; law the insurance
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; industry has written. But do you think
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; insurance rates have dropped in the slightest?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Not a chance..........

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course not, since the &quot;problem&quot; of frivilous lawsuits, like other
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right-wing hot button issues such as partial birth abortions is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; vastly overblown.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Plaintiffs either have sufficient evidence to prove malpractice or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they don't, and in the vast majority of cases they do.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That's a pretty naive view of the world. Do you really think jury
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decisions are based on evidence?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actually they are. But if you don't
&gt;&gt;&gt; like the jury system, what is your alternative?

&gt;&gt; Glad you asked. Juries are not competent to judge complex medical
&gt;&gt; malpractice cases.

&gt; That's what medical experts are for.

&gt;&gt; Instead of using juries, we should use a 3-judge panel
&gt;&gt; that receives *objective* input from unbiased, blinded medical experts
&gt;&gt; hired by the courts (not lawyers) and actuaries who provide data on the
&gt;&gt; cost of providing care for an injured person over the course of their

&gt;&gt; longer, and deny lump-sum payments. Make patients (or caregivers) who
&gt;&gt; have won cases prove that they are spending their award on appropriate
&gt;&gt; care.

&gt; Should we make insurance companies &quot;prove&quot;
&gt; that they aren't raising premiums just to cover
&gt; their investment losses?

&gt;&gt; Remove the contingency fees and let lawyers work for an hourly
&gt;&gt; wage like everyone else.

&gt; Does mean all doctors should work for hourly
&gt; rates and not get kickbacks from HMO's and drug
&gt; companies they invest in?

&gt;&gt; Cap punitive awards at a reasonable amount.

&gt; How about capping doctors fees at a reasonable amount?

&gt;&gt; Allow the judges to distribute appropriate punishment to those
&gt;&gt; physicians or hospitals that make mistakes, so that negligent physicians
&gt;&gt; and hospitals do not escape if remediation or license revocation is
&gt;&gt; indicated.

&gt; So you want judges to punish doctors but not
&gt; juries? So much for the rant against &quot;judicial

"/> Here is something recently posted by Sid:

&quot;This letter requests an immediate criminal investigation of
AstraZeneca for illegally delaying the submission to the FDA of 23
reports of serious adverse reactions in the U.S. to its
cholesterol-lowering drug rosuvastatin (CRESTOR) for as long as 97
days beyond the allowable 15-day legal limit for reporting such
reactions. Included in this large number of violations were 19 U.S.
cases of the often life-threatening destruction of muscle tissue known
as rhabdomyolysis and 4 U.S. cases of primary kidney failure or
insufficiency in patients not having rhabdomyolysis. Twenty of these
23 patients had to be hospitalized. These intentional reporting delays
by AstraZeneca, while temporarily succeeding in making their drug
appear safer than it actually is, have unquestionably impaired FDA's
ability to promptly assess the safety of this uniquely dangerous
drug.&quot;

And that is outright bullshit - even the FDA says so.

&quot;FDA spokeswoman Laura Bradbard tells WebMD that the agency is
reviewing the petition, and continuously monitors adverse events
linked to the medications it approves. The drug's labeling contains
warnings about the potential for muscle and kidney problems, but in
its August approval the agency concluded that it is safe for use at
doses up to 40 milligrams.&quot;

&quot;Bradbard says no evidence has emerged since Crestor's approval to
indicate that it is less safe than previously believed. FDA approval
was delayed for about a year after the agency expressed concerns about
side effects associated with 80-milligram doses.&quot;

And een more to the point, Sidney cites the 39 yo women's death due to
Crestor as his lead example of how bad the drug is...

His petition claims that &quot;a 39- year-old woman, taking only 20
milligrams a day [of CRESTOR], died of rhabdomyolysis and renal
insufficiency.&quot;

An autopsy ultimately determined that the 39-year-old woman died from
myocardial infarction with no evidence of rhabdomyolysis and that her
death had nothing to do with CRESTOR.

She DIED of an MI that could perhaps been avoided had she taken the
drug earlier - not because of the drug.

Stupid human tricks...

Want more?

&gt;&gt; If I am not mistaken, Herman is refering to DES (diethylsstilbestrol).
&gt;&gt; This is a case from the 1950's. After the Kefauver Harris

&gt;&gt; approval was significantly changed.

&gt; Thanks for the information. It sounds like an interesting read.

&gt;&gt; The argument is that the FDA approved labeling is sufficient to
&gt;&gt; indemnify the manufacturer from liability in the event of an adverse
&gt;&gt; event. This makes sense and the underlying rationale is supported in
&gt;&gt; case law.

&gt; Personally, I would have a lot more faith in that system if the FDA
&gt; weren't so reliant on corporate data and funding, and if the industry
&gt; whistleblowers didn't ring so darned truthful.

&gt; But that's just me.

&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, it is all too often that the deep pocket is attacked.
&gt;&gt; The result is that either the deep pocket absorbs (passes through) the
&gt;&gt; cost of liability or gets out of the business entirely. Which is it
&gt;&gt; you prefer?

&gt; I prefer that the shoe that fits be worn. If corporate behavior is
&gt; damaging enough, then yes, the company should be shut down IMHO, damages
&gt; paid and its principles prosecuted if appropriate. I do not believe that
&gt; companies which act in good faith be subject to unfair burdens. I think
&gt; juries are a good--perhaps the best, the least corruptible--way of
&gt; sorting it all out.

"/>&quot;Lipitor is not among the worst.&quot;

That depends if you've had your life changed and untreatable and
incurable disability caused by it. Then it's among the worst.

&quot;The fact that it can cause harmful and even disabling results is
clearly stated in the information provided to the FDA..&quot;

Are you sure about that Dr. Rubin? It is supposed to be. Was that true
for Paxil and the SSRIs? Apparently not. Who then witheld the negative
information: pharma from FDA, or FDA from the consumer?

Public Citizen now asserts Astra Zeneca withheld very serious side
effect information about Crestor which was to have been reported
within 15 days. The information regarding rhabdomyolysis and myositis
was not reported until the quarterly report allowed less serious
problems.

&quot;Every drug has it's risks and benefits and it should be the
individual...&quot;

I believe that is called hindsight Dr. Rubin. Are you sure the patient
should be even better informed than the physicians, who were
apparently *not* properly informed, and the pharma reps who were
apparently *not* informed. Either they were not properly informed, or
they didn't properly inform the patient in their haste to meet their
sales quota and write a prescription.

&quot;...information...included in each insert.&quot;

The drug inserts have been amended several times since Lipitor went on
the market. You have after market lab rats like me to thank for the
information that is *now* in the inserts. And are you sure
*everything* about the drugs you are taking is out front, and you know
it? Is there a chance something may have been withheld from you? Some
negative information suppressed by the pharma and therefore
unavailable to you? Stay tuned.

Every drug has risks and benefits,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; and it should be the individual, using all the information

"/> That's right. All the information available. Five years ago when I and
Sharon Hope's husband began with Lipitor, all the information
available was not what it is now.

If I am to be as informed or better informed than my physician, then
what do I need him for? One learns what one can. It is normal that one
enters the phyician's office with some degree of trust (for me now
none whatsoever...).

I was virtually harrassed into taking statins. Most lately, I have
been written off by an endocrinologist in a letter clearly meant to be
legal disclaimer.

It said in essence: I have told you what you must take and do, you
have refused it, therefore when you die it is not my fault and I am
not legally liable. And furthermore, I am not treating you for your
high cholesterol, but a shill for statin pharma, because I will not
consider any other course of treatment for you but statins or a drug
so new on the market that it does not now qualify for Dr. Rubin's
exacting standard; to whit:

are supposed to be set to the FDA directly by the physician,

Rarely do physicians report problems to the pharmaceutical
manufacturers. They cannot act on what they do not know.

The SSRI problem is a very difficult problem, and we still
do not know what is happening. Problem: someone depressed
may well be thinking about suicide, but is unlikely to tell
anyone about it or do anything about it unless the depression

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the doctors do not make the patients aware of the dangers,
&gt;&gt;&gt; do not blame the companies who have stated them clearly.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Lipitor is not among the worst.&quot;

&gt;&gt;That depends if you've had your life changed and untreatable and
&gt;&gt;incurable disability caused by it. Then it's among the worst.

&gt;&gt;&quot;The fact that it can cause harmful and even disabling results is
&gt;&gt;clearly stated in the information provided to the FDA..&quot;

&gt;&gt;Are you sure about that Dr. Rubin? It is supposed to be. Was that true
&gt;&gt;for Paxil and the SSRIs? Apparently not. Who then witheld the negative
&gt;&gt;information: pharma from FDA, or FDA from the consumer?

&gt; Pharma did not withhold if from FDA; problems with drugs
&gt; are supposed to be set to the FDA directly by the physician,
&gt; or by the patient. They prefer that it be by the physician,
&gt; but it is known that physicians are slow to do this.

&gt; Rarely do physicians report problems to the pharmaceutical
&gt; manufacturers. They cannot act on what they do not know.

&gt; The SSRI problem is a very difficult problem, and we still
&gt; do not know what is happening. Problem: someone depressed
&gt; may well be thinking about suicide, but is unlikely to tell
&gt; anyone about it or do anything about it unless the depression
&gt; is reduced. This does not apply to everyone. Now what?

&gt;&gt;Public Citizen now asserts Astra Zeneca withheld very serious side
&gt;&gt;effect information about Crestor which was to have been reported
&gt;&gt;within 15 days. The information regarding rhabdomyolysis and myositis
&gt;&gt;was not reported until the quarterly report allowed less serious
&gt;&gt;problems.

&gt;&gt;&quot;Every drug has it's risks and benefits and it should be the
&gt;&gt;individual...&quot;

&gt;&gt;I believe that is called hindsight Dr. Rubin. Are you sure the patient
&gt;&gt;should be even better informed than the physicians, who were
&gt;&gt;apparently *not* properly informed, and the pharma reps who were
&gt;&gt;apparently *not* informed. Either they were not properly informed, or
&gt;&gt;they didn't properly inform the patient in their haste to meet their
&gt;&gt;sales quota and write a prescription.

&gt; Each physician a patient sees should inform the patient, who
&gt; has the ultimate responsibility to put it all together.

&gt;&gt;&quot;...information...included in each insert.&quot;

&gt;&gt;The drug inserts have been amended several times since Lipitor went on
&gt;&gt;the market. You have after market lab rats like me to thank for the
&gt;&gt;information that is *now* in the inserts. And are you sure
&gt;&gt;*everything* about the drugs you are taking is out front, and you know

"/> My doctor's letter was of course couched in more appropriate terms. I
was paraphasing with sarcastic intent. The meaning was essentially
that. Regarding whether it was pharma or FDA who withheld data: I
believe it was pharma in the SSRI case which is the only case to have
been taken to court thus far. So we know more there. As I said, Astra
Zeneca withheld data. These things do not happen in isolation.

She turns her pen on drug makers

Former New England Journal of Medicine editor Marcia Angell criticizes
costs, research and marketing.
By Peter Jaret

Special to The Times

August 9, 2004

For more than a decade, physician Marcia Angell served as executive
editor and then editor in chief of the New England Journal of
Medicine, one of the country's most prestigious medical journals.
Under her watch, the journal published hundreds of studies of new
drugs. It also published blunt editorials harshly critical of the
pharmaceutical industry and the way drugs are tested and approved in
the United States.

Angell left the journal's editorship in 2000, and is now a senior
lecturer at Harvard Medical School. She has written a scathing
critique of the pharmaceutical industry, &quot;The Truth About the Drug
Companies: How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It&quot; (Random House,
2004). In a recent conversation, she talked about why so many of the
drugs on the market are so costly, and also about her contention that
many of them are not as effective as they're promoted to be.

*

Question: We all know drugs are expensive. But doesn't that reflect
the high cost of researching and developing new drugs?

Answer: No. That's what the drug makers would like you to think. But
it's simply not true. In 2002, the biggest drug companies spent only
about 14% of sales on research and development and 31% on what most of
them call marketing and administration. They consistently make more in
profits than they spend in R&amp;D. And their profits are immense. In
2002, the combined profits of the 10 drug companies in the Fortune 500
were $35.9 billion. That's more than the profits for all the other 490
business put together, if you subtract losses from gains.

*

Q: The system may be flawed, but hasn't it generated hundreds of new
medications?

A: That's another myth the drug makers would like you to believe. In
fact, the number of truly innovative new drugs is quite small. True,
many drugs are coming to market. But most of them aren't new at all.
They are minor variations of bestselling drugs that are already on the
market.

There are dozens of examples of these &quot;me-too&quot; drugs. There are now
six different statins to lower cholesterol. The first, Mevacor, which
was approved in 1987, was indeed an innovative drug. Other companies
wanted to capitalize on this extremely lucrative market and they began
creating other statins. Lipitor is now the biggest-selling drug in the
world. But it's a me-too drug. There's ...

&gt; Q: Is there anything patients can do?

&gt; A: Ask questions. If your doctor prescribes a medication, ask about
&gt; the evidence that shows it is effective. Ask why your doctor is
&gt; prescribing this particular drug. Ask if there are older, less
&gt; expensive drugs that might work just as well. A few questions from
&gt; patients might begin to make [doctors] think about what they're doing.
&gt; Finally, ask your doctor whether you really need a drug at all. Maybe
&gt; a lifestyle change would be better, or maybe the illness is mild and
&gt; will go away on its own.
