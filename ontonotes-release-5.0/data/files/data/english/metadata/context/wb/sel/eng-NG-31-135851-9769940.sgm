OK. Let's try this another way:

Consider a user with a fresh linux install - wide eyed and full of
intent. Let's call this user &quot;Bob&quot;. Bob's system python install is
2.5.x. His old Linux used to run 2.4.4... but that was more than a year
ago and time marches on for Bob.

He downloads the Plone 3.x package and runs the unified installer.
Everything is a piece of cake. The installer is a work of art - the
instructions are clear, the system already looks great. Bob has a lovely
contained install at /opt/Plone-3.x and Bob is happy. He installs some
excellent products from plone.org, but he decides it's time to
customise. Archetypes is clearly the way to go. . . and ArchGenXML + UML
are the way to do that.

What does Bob do to get these tools working on his box? If he zaps
python 2.5.x, his boss will tie him to a pillar outside the building and
have him publicly thrashed. Bob doesn't like that idea at all. Not
publicly, anyway. Bob is shy. What is Bob to do?

If the problem is that your boss want you to use Python 2.5 for Zope, he
can sponsor the security audit needed.
For now, Zope runs on Python 2.4 and needs to be validated on Python 2.5
Just ask Guido why Zope needs such a job for every Python 2.x version,
he knowns.

Bob needs to install AGX using the Python that came with the Unified
Installer... So get into the directory where you untarred AGX and do:

/opt/plone/zeocluster/python/python setup.py install --no-compile

(I don't remember if that's the exact path to python, but you get the idea)

To use AGX you will need a script to make things easier. Put in the full
paths to the AGX command (which should end up in python/Scripts/), your
.xmi file, and the folder where you want your code to go. You can make a
script for each project you work on... Keep a link on your desktop and
you're set!

Have fun Bob,

Hmm.

No way to have python 2.5 as the system python and a 2.4.4 development
version for archgen/plone. Bummer. I shall tell Bob to brace himself for
the Friday thrashing and a weekend rebuild. Bob has no social life these
days anyway.

Thanks ever so much for your help guys, Larry and Encolpe. Rest assured
Encolpe, if my plone concept is approved at the end of December, my
employer will contribute proportionately to open-source projects that
have helped the business. . . provided Aspeli's book gets here on time
for me to finish the mockup before Christmas!

Regards,

P.
