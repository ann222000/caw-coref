26 Jul 2007,Lalit Kumar,TNN NOIDA: The moral police is on the prowl in Noida
and even a boy and girl standing together could invite their ire.
Sudhir Sharma, a Delhi University student, discovered this when he was
assaulted by three cops near Noida's Sector 55 market around 7 pm on
Wednesday.

Head constable Nahar Singh and constables Jograj and Devendra allegedly
attacked Sharma after bundling him inside their Gypsy.

Speaking to this reporter at the district hospital where he was taken for
treatment, Sharma said: &quot;I had gone out with my friend, an MBA student,
living in Sector 55. Just as I dropped her near her house, some policemen in
a Gypsy stopped me and asked why I was talking to the girl. When I replied
that speaking to a friend was not a crime, they dragged me into their Gypsy
and thrashed me. They pushed my head on to a rod used to support the
tarpaulin cover of the vehicle which almost knocked me out. Then, they drove
me to Sector 58 police station.&quot;

Station officer Devendra Kumar said the &quot;constables told me the PCR had a
complaint of a couple engaging in obscene acts in front of the complainant's
house, for over an hour.&quot; Asked who the complainant was, Kumar said the
person could not be located. In any case, it was clear that the boy was
injured. So, on the basis of his complaint, the police registered a case
against the policemen. They also informed the senior superintendent of
police, A S Ganesh, who ordered their suspension. A case of voluntarily
causing injury has been registered against the three cops.

Speaking to this reporter, Ganesh said: &quot;The policemen claimed the boy had
deliberately banged his head on the bar in the Gypsy. Sudhir denied this.
But, it seemed at first sight that the case was one of high-handedness. And,
this will not be tolerated. The law will take its course against the
policemen.&quot;
