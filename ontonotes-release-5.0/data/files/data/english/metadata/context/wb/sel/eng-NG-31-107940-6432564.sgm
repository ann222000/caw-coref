In the interest of security, our airport management wants to ban all
automobile access to our aircraft at Republic Airport (KFRG). It was the hot
topic of discussion during our last tenant meeting on 3/14--a meeting with
the largest turnout of pilots since its inception. Interestingly, other
topics on the agenda for discussion that would normally cause consternation
went unopposed (increase of tiedown fees by $35/month, photo ID badge
implementation for all pilots, and various large-aircraft centric
construction projects to name a few). I don't rule out the notion that this
issue was a strategy to get the others pushed through (if it was,
brilliant!)

This is a complicated issue with what seems to be many motives at play. The
general feeling among the small aircraft GA pilots is that management is
looking to turn the airport into a bizjet mecca like Teterboro. This hardly
surprising since they are both run by the same management company. Many of
the tenants also think that the denial of access is just another ploy to
make the airport  more attractive to bizjet operators.

AOPA is involved and has sent them a letter outlining reasons why owners
need access to their aircraft and the little (and arguably DECREASED)
security issues it poses. Lots of rational, relevant, and passionate calls
for a cooperative approach to a solution by the pilots and I was pleasantly
surprised by the lack of disrespect during the 2-hour meeting attended by
about 100 interested parties. Kind of reminded me of this newsgroup--minus
the outlying rude ones.

If anyone has experienced a similar situation at their own airport I'd love
to hear what happened. From what AOPA has told us though, this has some
unique (and arguably inevitable) security aspects that may serve as the
precedent for other airports in the US going forward.

Hanscom Field, MA (KBED) used to have fairly liberal access with
vehicles but that all changed post 9-11.  No unescorted access unless
your vehicle has a RAMP sticker and those are only available to
businesses with need of access like FBOs.  It is possible to be
allowed access through a company controlled gate provided you are
escorted and monitored while on the ramp.  In practice this means that
limos can drive up to the business jets to offload and load
passengers.  The most onerous thing is that all recip aircraft are
required to have either a propeller lock or to be chained to a tie
down while on the airport.  This includes the Twin Bonanza with half
the tail and one engine missing.  Turboprop aircraft do not need a
propeller lock.

Thanks for the info. A few questions if I may John.
1) How do the owners perform preventative maintenance on their aircraft?
Specifically, how do they get tools and supplies to the aircraft?
2) Was there an issue with handicap access?
3) Has there been any pedestrian accidents on the ramp that may have been
prevented if there was vehicular access?
4) Was there a fight before the airport took away access or was it close
enough to 9-11 that there was no pushback?
5) Does Hanscom have a photo badging system (or other security mechanisms)
for pilots/owners or is the removal of vehicular access the main security
measure?

There were other good questions that came up during the meeting but these
were the main ones. I'm curious as to if or how the airport addressed
similar issues.

I appreciate the post.

Agreed.  Best of all, common sense seems to have reared its ugly head
again, nationwide, since 9/11.

Right after the terrortist attacks on New York and Washington, nearly
everyone restricted drive-on traffic at airports.  Now, on our recent
trip across the country (WV, NC, SC, AL, TN, MS), we were once again
able to pick up our rental cars right at our airplane at every airport
we visited.

I'm sorry to see Marco's airport going the other way, against the

The timing is what makes it all suspect. There hasn't been any significant
events that would prompt such an action. It can be argued that the Cory
Lidle crash was one but that can be argued by both sides quite convincingly.

The Airport Director keeps citing the "security experts" as "they" refuse to
name them but will only divulge that they are on the "state" level. Yeah,
OK..experts.

The max payload that any plane on the ramp can easily be stuffed into a
couple of suitcases (if it's dense enough, only one) that can be rolled
across the ramp with nary a suspicious glance. That goes for bad people as
well. The thing is, I think most if not all of the tenants will be open to a
significant increase in security short of the complete denial of vehicular
access. I even think there will be little pushback if they made us foot the
bill for vehicle passes (they have a gate system already and would just need
new card readers). It seems illogical that they would cause a firestorm of
resentment and probably a host of lawsuits when they could avoid it by
coordinating a common solution that will still maintain virtually the same
target level of security.

Unless, of course, there are other factors at play here...

These things have a rhythm and cycle.. The Bush administration is now
having the courts finally move against some the the decisions they
made early on, so 6 to 8 years is aobut what it takes for these things
to wind through the judicial system...

What it will take for GA to loosen the shackles of the tyranny of the
Patriot Act is someone with the money and determination to make a
court challenge against an airport authority on either constitutional
grounds or of simply not having the authority to arbitrarily restrict
the access of legitimate users of public spaces when there has not
been a single incident of having vehicle access to the ramp having
caused a terrorist incident...
The plaintiff will lose in the lower courts (they almost always side
with government/city hall) but the superior courts tend to take a
longer view and sooner or later some federal judge will vaguely
remember that powers not specifically allocated to the government are
reserved to the people &lt;gosh, what a surprise&gt; and that discriminating
against vehicle access by pilots while allowing limo drivers, etc., is
discrimination by class of person, etc...

MHT went through this process starting about 8-9 years ago, basically
coincident with MHT becoming a viable alternative to BOS. We used to have
free access to ramps. Then access was permitted by airport-issued passcard.
Somewhat inconvenient, but given the possibility that someone COULD drive
onto the ramp and then onto an active runway, and there were big aircraft on
said runway, not a big deal. Cars had to meet certain insurance
requirements, and cars had to display airport-issued stickers.

Then 9/11 happened. Current situation is tht I can still get my vehicle on
the field (to plow, do maintenance, or carry luggage) but I must call the
communications center and the gate must be opened for me. My vehicle is
occasionally subject to inspection, and still must meet insurance,
registration, and sticker requirements.

Bottom line - not as nice as it used to be, but not too terrible. Biggest
issue is the occasional need to wait 10-15 minutes for access. Normally not
that long. Give there are probably 100-125 part 135 operations/day, keeping
a craze-o from doing something terrible needs attention.

Hmmm, how did you go from GA ramp access to Patriot Act. The ability

Your situation sounds similar to something I suggested during the meeting.
If they were worried about the people they might be "sneaking" in via the
cars, then make everyone declare their "passengers" either electronically or
verbally upon entry and execute random spot checks on their declarations.
This would also include checks on automobile storage areas. Currently, the
gates close at 7 PM and owners need to go through another camera-equipped
gate and talk to an operations person to gain access. They ask for visual
confirmation of the car pass and can see whoever you bring along. To make us
declare the number of passengers would be a simple next step and they could
have a video recording of them as well. In other words, if they can't
visually count the two guys you claim as passengers, then they don't let you
in.

There's a myriad of possibilities and I hope they cooperate before making a
decision.

FWIW, I might be experiencing something in the same direction at Jones-
Riverside (KRVS) in Tulsa.  One afternoon, I was riding my bicycle around
the vehicle roads on the airport (not on the taxiways or on the ramp)
and was stopped by a Tulsa Airport Authority security person.  He
informed me that unless I worked at the airport, I had to stay on the
perimeter road and not ride up by the FBOs, flight schools, hangars, etc.
He also said that someone in the control tower had alerted him to my
presence.  I found this odd because I'd ridden on the same roads at least
half a dozen times since summer 2006 - sometimes right past the TAA
security people - and got, at most, a friendly wave.  I have contacted
TAA about it, but have not yet gotten a response; I'll post back if I
find anything interesting.

Robert, the Patriot Act is precisely what is driving this, with
specific mandates supplemented by myriad non legislated regulations
and little people who are, for the very first time in their lives,
vested with the mantle of authority, a black belt with a radio and a
shiny pair of chromed handcuffs, prominently displayed....  Wire taps
are nothing, it is the warrantless searches, the power of non LEO's to
accost and detain for no reason other than someone doesn't like how
you look...  Is this America or Orwell's 1984?  This treacherous act
is vastly, vastly more than just listening to phone calls to Iran...
Ya gotta wake up and notice the coffee is boiling over, my friend...

A man being harassed for riding a bicycle on a public road because it
is near an airport is a lightning shot piercing the darkness of the
storm......  Did you even notice?  What gives the minimum wage
&lt;meaning minimum skills&gt;  hourly employee of an airport the legal
right to go off airport property onto a public road and harass
someone?   What makes him think he has the "authority" to accost a
citizen passing on a public road?

&gt; measure?

&gt; There were other good questions that came up during the meeting but these
&gt; were the main ones. I'm curious as to if or how the airport addressed
&gt; similar issues.

&gt; I appreciate the post.

There is a photo I.D. system (SIDA) in place and it must be worn on
the outermost garment while on the airfield.  (I got caught the first
day it was active ten feet from the hangar!)  The airfield perimeter
is completely fenced and gated.  Also you cannot drive on the airfield
itself without an endorsement through a class and test which is
reflected on your badge. The only way to get to an aircraft for
preventative maintenance is to be escorted to the aircraft by an
operator with vehicle priveleges.

Post 9-11 the airport was closed for at least a week as I remember,
while security measures were reviewed.  There wasn't much of a fight.
This is a MassPort facility so they pretty much can do whatever they
want though there is always some public input before they do. MassPort
remains pretty embarassed at the fact that the two WTC aircraft came
out of Logan (B0S).  It took a while to develop the program but it is
now in force.  Hanscom is collocated with Hanscom Air Force Base and
the Electronic Systems Command; security there is even tighter though
the guards at the gate are mostly civilian now.  I don't know of any
handicap issues per se.  I lost fully half my annual customers in 2002
as owners left for other airports with easier access.

It's happening off airport too. Large graveled areas along a popular 4-lane
highway here,  was always a popular place for people to park and watch
aircraft land. The gravel areas were initially installed for parking when
airport workers came off the airport to maintain lights for the landing
system.

Anyone parking there to watch since 9-11 has always been approached
immediatly by airport security and forced to leave under the threat of
arrest. Nonsense because the area north of the road is a very large and
heavily wooded public park for more than a mile.  Go figure.

Read the original post in a state of sleep deprivation, missed the
fact you stated  the perimeter road is on airport property... The
perimeter roads for the majority of GA airports I inhabit are public,
so my mind set was in that direction...
Sorry, but you will likely have to do it their way on airport property
for now...
The rest of my post stands as is...

I noticed a federal court just struck down internet porn filter
regulations promulgated by the Bush administration &lt;related to our
topic by being another set of federal regulations rammed down our
throats by zealots&gt;... I would not have predicted this outcome for
that suit, but it is refreshing to see the court take the stand that
it is the parents LEGAL responsibility to MONITOR and CONTROL their
children, not the school's, not the library's, etc. and that the
government does not have the constitutional power to reallocate that
responsibility to third parties......

"What, you expect me to watch my nasty little spawn of satan!  Why
should I have to do it? What do I pay taxes for?"

Absolutely priceless...

The whole point of this is that the majority of regulations strangling
GA airports cannot withstand a determined court challenge - including
being harassed for riding a bicycle...

Sorry to hear about your customers John. The thing is, if the airport
proposed these measures within a relatively short period of time after 9-11,
there would be minimal opposition. Now that it's six years later, the
motives behind these meaures are now suspect.

We had the entire airport re-fenced as well and cables/locks were installed
for each aircraft all at the airport's expense. Virtually all of us
appreciated that and that's why I think there will be little opposition if
they make us foot the bill for an access control system for vehicles.

We also don't have any active military installations on the field so they
can't point to that as a reason. Bush flew into the airport a couple of
years ago (that event actually prompted the cable locks) but that's not
anticipated to be a regular occurrence.

We'll see what happens.

I don't know either, but suspect that "Security" is just the standard answer
for the present decade.

Two much more likely reasons are:
1)    Runway or taxiway incursion by a service or security vehicle--which
will remain unaffected by the rule.
2)    One of the parked aircraft jumped out in front of an airport tug,
either locally or at a nearby airport--which got them to thinking that it
could easily have happened to an automobile, or even one of those little
luggage hand trucks...

Agreed. But in our case we have minimum wage security personnel coming
=outside= airport security fences and harassing people parking on the
easement of a 4 lane highway, just because they want to safely park and
watch the jets land. It was a well used area pre 911, and you could often
see entire families there, admiring the big aircraft as they landed.

The only rational given to me by security personnel was that it would be a
good place for someone to park and shoot at an approaching aircraft. But
just 300 feet north is the border for a huge, heavily wooded, public park
with no security at all. I myself, have been harassed one evening when I
stopped to watch a few aircraft with a girlfriend.

My point is simply to support Denny's message. Whether it be the Patriot Act
or just post 911 nonsense, we are paying some very unreasonable prices for
our countries inability to effectively deal with the real situation.

A new wrinkle just this month at KBED is that TSA is now mandating
that there must be two forms of ID on file for every badge holder and
one has to state nationality.  MassPort was apparently a little late
in getting the word out and now people are scrambling to get caught
up.  We just had a young mech's badge pulled.   I was asked to produce
mine in the hangar but my name is not on a list of people with only
one ID so I am o.k.

Apparently MassPort is under threat of having thier entire badge
system decertified if they can't resolve discrepancies.
