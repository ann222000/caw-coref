What I see in the literature seems to vary between warnings against
spending too much trim or flying with trim tabs, and not ever trimming
the aircraft at all.  So how much and when should I trim?

I understand trim to be a convenience, so that a pilot doesn't have to
constantly maintain force against the controls for long periods.  Thus
it should never be dangerous not to trim, except insofar as it can be
tiring to hold an untrimmed aircraft in a given attitude for long
periods.

The thing I wonder about is the possible distraction of trimming the
aircraft.  It looks like trim controls are often in spots like the
pedestal or throttle quadrant, where presumably one must direct one's
attention in order to adjust trim.  It's hard to imagine doing this
during critical phases of flight such as take-off or landing, and yet
I read recommendations for trim in both cases.  Where do you draw the
line between trimming unnecessarily and not trimming enough?  How
often do you actually reach for the trim controls?

Also, it seems that most trim is pitch trim.  I don't see much mention
of aileron or rudder trim.  Do you use it?  Do you ever trim out
P-factor or torque effects?  I turned both back on in my sim and
adjusted them to where the vendor says they should be to match the
real aircraft, and I find them irritating, but not overwhelming (the
vendor has apparently set the most realistic factors at 50% instead of
100%, so that masochists can increase their effects beyond real life
if desired).

Another problem I have:  How do you remember where you set the trim?
I know you can look, and I know that you can guess if the aircraft is
behaving strangely, but how do you keep track of where you last set
the trim?  Each time I set it I tend to forget about it until some
important moment when I'm already busy with other things.

Also, I presume that most autopilots use trim for pitch control.  If
you shut off the autopilot, does the trim remain whereever the A/P set
it?  If so, do you change it?  Is it hard to remember that the A/P has
probably changed it?

I haven't trimmed in about two years.  Plane doesn't have cockpit-adjustable
trim.  I just bend the metal tabs on occasion.

Trim every time you change pitch. Trim when needed even in level
flight. Basically, you trim whenever you need it, and that is fairly
often. IDEAL airplane would have trim in all three axis, but most small
GA don't.

I consider trim to be the most important control on the plane. I learned to
fly in a $250 used hang glider-the original Rogallo "you-stall-you-die"
design. I didn't realize how out of balance it was until I took it on the
first soaring flight. After a half hour my arms were cramped and it was
really difficult to control. My second hang glider flew hands off and the
entire flying experience in it just didn't compare to that first glider. I
spent 5 1/2 hours over Mt. Greylock one time.

I got into an ultralight next, and that was also out of trim with no means
to adjust it in flight. If I let go of the stick, it would start going down
and to the right. Again, my arm would cramp after about 45 minutes and I
always felt I was balanced on the point of a pin and one moments inattention
would have me falling off.

My Tripaver has the trim handle overhead. It is a crank style rather than a
wheel, but at this point I don't even have to look for it. My hand goes
right to it and the inputs are automatic. Trim wheels are the same. Just
trim out the control pressure and you're along for the ride. I once flew
from Block Island to Barnes in Westfield-about 85 miles-without ever
touching the yoke (after takeoff) until I flared for landing. At one point I
noticed I had lost 100'. My front seat passenger was leaning forward looking
out the window. I had him sit back and we came right back to altitude, where
I kept the altimeter pinned on my desired altitude for the entire flight.

Trimming is much less distracting and effortless that constantly monitoring
and correcting your airspeed and altitude. One of the biggest problems
people have when landing is not trimming the plane for approach speed and
attitude. When you have to grip the yoke and maintain pressure on it all the
way in, it makes it harder to use the fine touch it takes to make a nice,
gentle touchdown.

The only time you need to visually check the trim setting is for takeoff.
While flying, it is set by feel. One thing that might make this more
apparent to you is a feedback controller. I used to use the Force Feedback
controller and it made simming  a lot more realistic.

Trim to releave control pressure for any given attitude that you plan
to maintain for more than a few seconds.

Elevator trim: You don't have to keep track of it. You should just feel
when it's needed. Set it to neutral when procedures call for it -
before takeoff, that's about the only time you need to worry about its
exact position, except for big airliners, which I believe have to have
trim reset to 0 before landing as well. If you can't relax your hand on
the yoke because your input is needed to correct pitch at any given
time -- time to trim. Ailerons and rudder trims are a bit different.
Those are mostly used to keep coordinated flight once straight and
level.

The discussion of trim in a flight sim on a PC is academic.  In an
aircraft, trim is not so much a "convenience" as you seem to think.
Flying a plane out of trip is a big distraction.

Most planes have elevator trim, some planes have aileron trim and some
have rudder trim.  Having all 3 means you can trim the plane to fly
pretty much wherever you want it to.

You ought to save up your pocket money and take a discovery flight then
you can see and feel the things you're asking about.

But if you set by feel, how do you keep track of how much control

I've heard opinions for and against.  Some say it improves the feel,
others say the feel is there but very different from the real thing,
so much so that it's better to do without.  Personally, on the one
hand feedback is hard to find and expensive, and on the other the
feedback would vary by aircraft, anyway, so there'd be no one ideal
feedback setting (and I fly with a joystick, while most aircraft are
using a yoke).

If you can't let go of the stick without starting to climb or descend, you
need it. This is the thing I always had trouble with in sims, especially
with a cheap stick that didn't have trim on it.

You don't need to keep track of anything. The only way you'll ever run out
of trim or control movement range is if you've loaded the plane grossly
outside the weight and balance envelope. Generally, the trim setting has
nothing to do with the range of control movement. It can be a small
adjustable tab on the elevator trailing edge or it can be the entire
horizontal stabilizer.

It totally depends on the plane. I used to fly a Globe Swift and I
never found any reason to need to touch the trim. The plane flew hands
off at whatever you pointed it to. I currently own a Mooney and I spend
more time in the pattern moving the trim than holding the throttle. The
entire downwind of a Mooney is rolling the trim back, slowing the plane
down.

Bottom line is that it depends on the design of the plane how sensitive
it is to trim and how much trim change it requires for any
displacement.

The springs don't really serve the "same" purpose. The springs just return
the stick to the center position. When trimming a real plane, you hold yoke
pressure until your speed and altitude stabilize, then trim out that
pressure until you can let go of the yoke and the plane remains stable.

Not really. In a real aircraft, you trim out the forces you're feeling
without actually moving the control itself.

However, controls for a PC don't work like this - so you have to feed in
trim to the simulator, while gradually moving the joystick to the centre
position - because all that's providing resistance is a set of static
springs.

It would be possible to design flight controls for a PC simulator (which
are inadequate on so many levels - even the expensive ones) which work
just like trim works on a real aircraft, but it would be extremely
expensive. The other problem with PC controls is that they don't move
nearly far enough. The CH yoke for example, goes in and out (for pitch)
about 3 or 4 inches, and turns about 45 degrees in each diretion. The
yoke on a Cessna 172 has probably 18 inches of fore/aft travel and turns
through about 120 degrees in each direction. CH rudder pedals maybe
displace an inch or so, but the rudder pedals on a C172 probably
displace a good 5 or 6 inches. This means that the controls on a
simulator are _insanely_ sensitive if you want them to be able to make
full control deflections.

Name ten!

If you're doing without trim in a real aircraft, you _are_ doing it
wrong, at least for any conventional light plane right up to airliners.
Trim is absolutely essential in pitch.

It seems that nobody has responded to this yet ...

The autopilot controls pitch with the elevator servo,
much in the same way the roll is controlled with the
aileron servo. The elevator servo can measure the force
needed to keep the proper attitude, and after a small
delay, it trims the force off with the trim servo.

When the autopilot is released, it leaves the airplane
in trim to the pilot - there's no need to remember the
trim position.

Because no matter who responds, you're getting the answer filtered through their
senses and experience.  It's like asking someone what an apple tastes like,
rather than biting into one yourself.  Everyone's experience differs; you will
not gain a consensus on which to base an opinion.  Five minutes in an aircraft
would allow you to understand the issues of trim, from both a conscious and
muscle-memory perspective.

I don't think its a waste of time. Most FBOs offer a $49 intro ride.
Its usually around 20 minutes and if you get a 1/2 way good instructor
you will be on the controls most of the time. I think most of the
questions you have will be very obvious when you get in the plane.
Imagine learning to run a lawn mower via a simulator. You'd have a lot
of questions that would just seem obvious when you get the real thing.
If you're in Sacramento, I can take you up on a 20 minute intro ride
for the $49 intro price. We'd fly out over the "naked place" (nudist
place) and do some basic turning and climbing to get a feel for the
plane. $49 is probably about what you paid for the software.

He lives in France......  Needless to say, even if he lived at the approach
end of your local airport runway, he will make every excuse in the world to
get off his beloved simulater and get in a real plane.

I'd bet if he would get out of his lazy boy chair, off his simulator and

Dangerous advice. For an introductory price you get addicted and find
yourself with an aviation habit and can't stop. That's what happened
to me, though it was quite a bit cheaper than $49 at the time.

It looks like Be-A-Pilot is a bit higher...

The closest I can come in a sim is to keep the plane trimmed so I
don't have to move the joystick, but I guess that's a useful
approximation.  In real life, from what I understand, the controls
would actually be in a different position, assuming that they are
mechanically linked to the control surfaces.

About 3 months after I got my private certificate, I decided to go back for
a little XC with the CFI who had actually been my CFI at the time of my
checkride in order to just make sure I hadn't started to develop any early
bad habits.

As we were headed southeast from Phoenix, ATC called traffic overtaking us
from our six o'clock and co-alt (ATC was not talking to that traffic...)
Try as we might, we couldn't pick him up and eventually ATC suggests we
descend.  Right before I reach to retard the throttle and before I can push
the nose down, my good old CFI racks the passenger seat back to the rear
stop and just flops the seat flat trying to look up through the rear
windows.  We immediately gain about 150 feet which probably was not a good
thing since we were pretty sure the conflicting traffic was above and behind
us.

Scared the hell out of me and I didn't let him hear the end of it all the
way to our destination (and part of the way back, too...)

I flew a J-3 Piper Cub, which has a crank handle (actually the window
handle from a Model A Ford, I believe) lower left where it can be
reached from front or rear seat. While it's possible to fly without
trimming, it's annoying to continually hold stick pressure, and I
think it's a bit dangerous on landing and even on takeoff. At those
times you want a 'nice' feel for the stick, which is spoiled if you
are holding it fore or aft in order to get neutral (if you follow!).

Basically, I check the position of the stabiliator (pitch trim on the
Cub is done by moving the front of the horizontal stabilizer up and
down--with an automobile jack worm!) while doing my preflight
walkaround. My pre-takeoff checklist is CIGARS, with the A standing
for Attitude, and at that letter I eyeball the trim indicator. I have
on rare occasions adjusted the trim in the course of taking off, if I
find myself holding forward stick in order to stay about say 50 mph on
the airspeed indicator.

I trim for level flight after I've finished the climb. Most of the
time that's full forward, and sometimes full forward isn't enough and
I hold a bit of forward stick.

And I trim for glide when I cut my power on the downleg opposite the
numbers. The object is to glide at 60 mph on the airspeed indicator;
that's neutral trim with the power off.

I did some training at Chandler AZ in a Super Cub, and the instructor
insisted that I stop trimming on landing. I didn't like it much, and
as soon as I was alone  I reverted to going to neutral trim on every
downwind. (I suppose he was having me adjust the power on each leg of
the pattern, so I was adjusting trim on downwind, base, and final.)

No rudder or aileron trim on the Cub.

Plane doesn't fly straight &amp; level. Wants to lose altitude, less often

The great thing is to be able to hold the stick so lightly that your
fingers aren't really touching it; the plane flies itself.

That's what 'weight &amp; balance' calculations are all about!

And that's why you don't fly a J-3 Cub solo from the front seat. It's

running out of control with the stick.

In the Cub, I always run out of TRIM control in level flight. It's

You can compare the trim thing a bit like changing gears in a car.
One knows where the gear lever is without looking and you know what to

Trimming a plane is about the same when it comes to distraction and
