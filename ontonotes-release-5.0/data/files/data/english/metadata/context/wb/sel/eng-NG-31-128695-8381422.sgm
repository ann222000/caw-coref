day 148

today i closed the store and spent the day in the bottleshop next
door.
carl, the manager, looked at me oddly.
&quot;hey, aren't you supposed to be working?&quot;
i returned his odd look and raised it by an eyebrow. &quot;huh? working?
what's that and is it a weekly yet?&quot;

day 149

mike made a triumphant return today.
spat himself into the store, looked around with a scowl.
&quot;i hate that fucking poster you got out there. get a new one.&quot;
and zoomed back out.
asshole.

day 150

i haven't put lisa on any more shifts at work.
it's my subtle firing policy.
she left a few messages on my machine.
i figure she'll get the message in a few weeks.
pseudo boyfriend, indeed.
i delete her number from my mobile.

day 151

&quot;i want to swap this movie for another. it was crap.&quot;
&quot;no.&quot;
&quot;look, it was crap, okay? i want to swap it!&quot;
&quot;so? you got it out. you chose it. it was your choice. it's not my
fault your taste is stuck halfway up your ass.&quot;
&quot;how dare you! i want to speak to your manager! now!&quot;
&quot;mate, i am my own manager.&quot;
customers.
man, they suck.

day 152

manga dropped in.
he said i looked a bit down.
&quot;maybe you should get back with squirt. you were happier, then.&quot;
&quot;i don't know,&quot; i said. &quot;now i've gotten rid of the horror section,
there'd be nowhere for her to blow me except behind the counter, and
that's so mainstream, y'know?&quot;
&quot;what kind of stuff did she like, anyway? you two didn't have much in
common.&quot;

day 153

moved into a new townhouse.
decided it looked a bit empty, so brought home the sci-fi section from
work and filled one of the bedrooms with it.
i feel so nerdy.

day 154

closed the shop early today so i could show manga my new house.
he nosed through the rooms, slowly.
paused at the empty third bedroom.
&quot;we could build a cool jamming room here. get the band back together.
blues brothers style.&quot;
&quot;we had a band?&quot;
&quot;it was a lot of years ago. i don't expect you to remember.&quot;
&quot;oh. did i play an instrument?&quot;
&quot;dead cat vocals.&quot;
&quot;cool.&quot;
