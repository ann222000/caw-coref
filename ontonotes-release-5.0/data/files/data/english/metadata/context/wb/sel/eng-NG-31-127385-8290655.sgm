Falsification Of Atmospheric CO2 Greenhouse Effects

Version 1.0 (July 7, 2007)

Gerhard Gerlich

http://icecap.us/images/uploads/Falsification_of_CO2.pdf

Abstract

The atmospheric greenhouse effect, an idea that authors trace back to the
traditional works of Fourier 1824, Tyndall 1861 and Arrhenius 1896 and is still
supported in global climatology essentially describes a fictitious mechanism in
which a planetary atmosphere acts as a heat pump driven by an environment that
is radiatively interacting with but radiatively equilibrated to the atmospheric
system. According to the second law of thermodynamics such a planetary machine
can never exist. Nevertheless, in almost all texts of global climatology and in
a widespread secondary literature it is taken for granted that such a mechanism
is real and stands on a firm scientific foundation. In this paper the popular
conjecture is analysed and the underlying physical principles are clarifed. By
showing that

(a) there are no common physical laws between the warming phenomenon in glass
houses and the fictitious atmospheric greenhouse effects,

(b) there are no calculations to determine an average surface temperature of a
planet,

(c) the frequently mentioned difference of 33  degrees C is a meaningless number
calculated wrongly,

(d) the formulas of cavity radiation are used inappropriately,

(e) the assumption of a radiative balance is unphysical,

(f) thermal conductivity and friction must not be set to zero, the atmospheric
greenhouse conjecture is falsified.

Bonzo

&quot;Christians look to the Second Coming, Marxists look to the collapse of
capitalism, with the same mixture of fear and longing ... The discovery of
global warming filled a gap in the canon ... [and] provides justification for
the link between the sins of our past and the catastrophe of our future.&quot; John
Kay, The Financial Times

I highly recommend reading this.  It's technical, but accessible - they
explain their work as they go in an easy-to follow manner.  The
differences between this paper, meant to teach, and others, meant to sell,
are quite obvious.  You can skip through the math if need be, because
they also develop their points in plain English.  It's devastating.

Which respected, peer-reviewed, scientific has assessed this paper for
publication?

I ask this because at first glance,

1/ The authors appear unqualified

2/ The authors appear to not understand the greenhouse properties of
CO2

3/ The authors' list of references includes gems such as:
&quot;[180] Anonymous, &quot;The Greenhouse E?ect&quot; (In German, 23.03.2007), http://de .
wikipedia.org/wiki/Treibhauseffekt&quot;

4/ The authors make use of that criticism so favoured by
creationidiots and other cranks, that &quot;the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics&quot;
proves them right.

My reaction, were I in a position where I was required to sift through
many scientific papers to find those of sufficient quality to be
published would be to throw this particular one straight on the fire
with no more than the 30-second glance it appears to deserve.

Maybe you can convince us why we should take this paper seriously
despite the above deficiencies.

I did criticise the work itself:

- its authors are unqualified

- they demonstrate ignorance as to the greenhouse properties of CO2
(and recycle the same crappy old crap I've read elsewhere about it
being a rare gas etc...)

- they quote anonymous Wikipaedia articles (pffft!)

- they resort to the cranky old &quot;2nd Law of Thermodynamics&quot; line...

.....and I didn't need to read any more than that to realise it is
garbage.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; because they also develop their points in plain English.  It's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; devastating.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Which respected, peer-reviewed, scientific has assessed this paper for
&gt;&gt; &gt; publication?

&gt;&gt; &gt; I ask this because at first glance,

&gt;&gt; &gt; 1/ The authors appear unqualified

&gt;&gt; &gt; 2/ The authors appear to not understand the greenhouse properties of
&gt;&gt; &gt; CO2

&gt;&gt; &gt; 3/ The authors' list of references includes gems such as: &quot;[180]
&gt;&gt; &gt; Anonymous, &quot;The Greenhouse E?ect&quot; (In German, 23.03.2007), http://de .
&gt;&gt; &gt; wikipedia.org/wiki/Treibhauseffekt&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; 4/ The authors make use of that criticism so favoured by
&gt;&gt; &gt; creationidiots and other cranks, that &quot;the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; proves them right.

&gt;&gt; &gt; My reaction, were I in a position where I was required to sift through
&gt;&gt; &gt; many scientific papers to find those of sufficient quality to be
&gt;&gt; &gt; published would be to throw this particular one straight on the fire
&gt;&gt; &gt; with no more than the 30-second glance it appears to deserve.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Maybe you can convince us why we should take this paper seriously
&gt;&gt; &gt; despite the above deficiencies.

&gt;&gt; Try reading it and criticizing the work itself, not the authors and text
&gt;&gt; formatting.

&gt; I did criticise the work itself:

&gt;  - its authors are unqualified

&gt;  - they demonstrate ignorance as to the greenhouse properties of CO2
&gt; (and recycle the same crappy old crap I've read elsewhere about it being a
&gt; rare gas etc...)

&gt;  - they quote anonymous Wikipaedia articles (pffft!)

&gt;  - they resort to the cranky old &quot;2nd Law of Thermodynamics&quot; line...

&gt; .....and I didn't need to read any more than that to realise it is

Can you show any comment of yours here that would prove you're capable of
judging his response?  So far, you fall for every meaningless hoax out
there, from pretending you can't take an average global temperature because
the thermometers are embedded in different substances, to aspersions cast on
data based on a 4% sampling without verification of any errors.

Given this record, it's a mystery to me why you receive anything here
besides ridicule.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gerhard Gerlich

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://icecap.us/images/uploads/Falsification_of_CO2.pdf

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Abstract

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The atmospheric greenhouse effect, an idea that authors trace back to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the traditional works of Fourier 1824, Tyndall 1861 and Arrhenius 1896
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and is still supported in global climatology essentially describes a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fictitious mechanism in which a planetary atmosphere acts as a heat
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pump driven by an environment that is radiatively interacting with but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; radiatively equilibrated to the atmospheric system. According to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; second law of thermodynamics such a planetary machine can never exist.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, in almost all texts of global climatology and in a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; widespread secondary literature it is taken for granted that such a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mechanism is real and stands on a firm scientific foundation. In this
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; paper the popular conjecture is analysed and the underlying physical
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; principles are clarifed. By showing that

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (a) there are no common physical laws between the warming phenomenon
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in glass houses and the fictitious atmospheric greenhouse effects,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (b) there are no calculations to determine an average surface
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; temperature of a planet,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (c) the frequently mentioned difference of 33  degrees C is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meaningless number calculated wrongly,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (d) the formulas of cavity radiation are used inappropriately,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (e) the assumption of a radiative balance is unphysical,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (f) thermal conductivity and friction must not be set to zero, the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; atmospheric greenhouse conjecture is falsified.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I highly recommend reading this.  It's technical, but accessible - they
&gt; &gt;&gt; explain their work as they go in an easy-to follow manner.  The
&gt; &gt;&gt; differences between this paper, meant to teach, and others, meant to
&gt; &gt;&gt; sell, are quite obvious.  You can skip through the math if need be,
&gt; &gt;&gt; because they also develop their points in plain English.  It's
&gt; &gt;&gt; devastating.

&gt; &gt; Devastatingly bad and full of errors as I illustrate in the 'hoax' thread.

&gt; Can you show specifically how any of the above six claims are incorrect?

And like a coutnry bumpkin, you don't even notice that  you have slidden

The article basically states that since there are so many complex factors
that influence a person's height, and they are all interacting and since
ther are racial and regional differences in height,  that there is no such

Yet, by definition there is.

The projections are based on results from computer models that involve

simplifications of real physical processes that are not fully understood.

Accordingly, no responsibility will be accepted by CSIRO for the accuracy of

the projections inferred from this brochure or for any person's

interpretations, deductions, conclusions or actions in reliance on this

information.

And further:

Climate model responses are most uncertain in how they represent feedback

effects, particularly those dealing with changes to cloud regimes,

biological effects and ocean-atmosphere interactions. The coarse spatial

resolution of climate models also remains a limitation on their ability to

simulate the details of regional climate change. Future climate change will

also be influenced by other, largely unpredictable, factors such as changes

in solar radiation, volcanic eruptions and chaotic variations within the

climate system itself. Rapid climate change, or a step-like climate response

to the enhanced greenhouse effect, is possible but its likelihood cannot be

defined. Because changes outside the ranges given here cannot be ruled out,

these projections should be considered with caution.

So the CSIRO's understanding of our future climate is based on a computer

models that are simplified, uncertain and limited, drawing on climate

processes that are not fully understood and unpredictable, to warn of risks

that are undefinable and cannot be relied upon.
