Those pushy Muslims never let up trying to change the way we have done
things in this country for centuries. Most normal householders would
never let a guest start rearranging the furniture and changing the
curtains, let alone ripping up the very foundations, but that is what
is clearly happening in our national home with Islamic guests on a
mission to change our society to suit them.

The issue of purdah and the veil brought to the fore last autumn by
former Labour Minister Jack Straw returns yet again; this time causing
problems amongst those implementing British law.

A long serving Manchester magistrate who refused to deal with a
defendant because she was wearing a full Muslim face veil could face
disciplinary action, even suspension from his duties.

Ian Murray, a Cheadle Hulme taxi driver who has served on the bench
for 12 years, walked out of Manchester Magistrates' Court on Thursday
(28th). Zoobia Hussain, 32, of Crumpsall, who is charged with criminal
damage, plans to write and complain, her lawyer said.

Mr. Murray said he had been concerned about the defendant's identity.
If a complaint is received, Mr. Murray will automatically face an
internal investigation, a spokesman for the Judiciary of England and
Wales said.

“Distressed”

As always the Muslim assumes the role of persecuted victim and
Hussain's lawyer, Judith Hawkins, said: &quot;She [Mrs Hussain] remains
shocked and distressed.

&quot;She suffered hurt feelings and felt intimidated and deeply
embarrassed by the treatment she received at court.

Mrs Hussain covered her entire face apart from her eyes when she faced
the three magistrates.

A statement from the Judiciary of England and Wales said: &quot;Mr Murray
is concerned about questions of identity when the full veil is worn in
court.

&quot;However, he agrees that he acted unwisely in disqualifying himself
without giving reasons, and acknowledges that he should have sought
the advice of his legal advisor in court, and discussed the provisions
of the national guidelines with his colleagues on the bench, before
taking action.

Mr. Murray is &quot;continuing to work as normal&quot; while no complaint
exists, a judiciary spokesman said.

Is is fatal to any court decision to mis-identify any of the parties in
any case decided on.  Anyway, if a judge tells her to reveal her face,
she should obey and complain later.  There is such a thing as contempt
of court.  The UK is not mooseleemland, as you yourself noted.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Society's rights prevail over individual rights.  If people want to join
a society, such as mooseleems wanting to join UK society, then they
should ALSO give up some inconveniences like all others members do.  But
mooseleems and bleeders like you don't recognize this concept.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

True.  But there is now a total imbalance in favor of mooseleems, thanks
to bleeding hearts like you.

And when a conflict exists between individual rights and the common
good, sane societies veer towards the common good.  Only sheeple pumped
with Kool Aid and Koo-ranic Verses go the opposite way.

I know you still won't get this.  The only way to make you understand is
to put your family next to a downtrodden mooseleem wearing a bulky vest
and overcoat in the heat of summer.  DO IT!

Perhaps the best reply I can give you is to say that the UK government
willingly admitted and welcomed these muslims to live in UK.  And none
of these muslims was required to promise or swear that they will adopt
the English culture and try to assimilate.  These people are free to
be who they are.  And their rights are protected by law.  And this law
now may be used against that judge who walked out.

It's not the muslim who created these rights and laws in UK.  The
people of UK created the present legal conditions there.  And they are
the ones who are ultimately responsible for the rules.

Yes, I as a private citizen, same as the judge, in my own country have
the right to know whom I am dealing with. And that means you have to
be able to see the persons face for identification. The veiling of
women to the extent that you do not know whom you are dealing with has
nothing to do with the Muslim religion. I do not see women in almost
all Muslim countries, Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, even Iran, having
their face covered. This is just a custom to appease the jealousy of
their husbands, brothers fathers.

I do not know about the UK, but I know about Canada, which by the way
is also your country. When you become a citizen you swear allegiance
to the Crown and to obey the laws of Canada, so you must identify
yourself when required, to a judge, to the police even to another
citizen, say in a traffic accident, and the law says nothing that it
must only be to another female. The laws of Canada also guarantee
equal rights to male and females. So as a man I have the right to know

If your argument about muslim dress is true.  Then you can also say
that the way Canadian Menonite women dress has nothing to do with
Christian religion.  The way Canadian Hutterite women dress has
nothing to do with Christian religion.  And the way Catholic nuns
dress has nothing to do with Christian religion either.   Because vast
majority of Christians in Canada and in other places don't dress that
way.

Obviously this argument is false.  Their dress has everything to do
with their religion.  The women who are more devoted to their religion
usually dress more conservatively.  And this is true for both
Christian women and Muslim women.  And if you are familiar with
Buddhist monasteries in Thailand.  Then you will know that even
Buddhist nuns dress more conservatively than vast majority of other
Buddhists do.

Muslims don't have anything that resemble monasteries or monks and
nuns.  But many of them are devoted to their religion notheless.  And
one of the ways they show it is with their extremely conservative
dress.

Since when did it become an offence to be devoted to one's religion?

The Canadian Constitution and the laws of all western countries
(including UK) guarantee the freedom of religion for all of their
citizens.  And this means that government officials must try to
accomodate people's right to live according to their religious beliefs
as much as they can.

It's not that difficult for a judge to ask a female officer of the
court to identify for him a muslim woman who wants to behave according
to her beliefs.  The veiled muslim woman has no problem with lifting
her veil for a female officer of the court in a private room.  And
that would've been the most reasonable thing to do.

It's true that government law enforcement officials have the right to
enforce the rules and the laws of the land regardless of people's
religious beliefs.

But people in Canada would be outraged if a male police officer stip-
searches a Catholic nun who may have broken some law.  Obviously this
kind of stip-search would be extremely inappropriate, even if the nun
had broken some law and the strip-search had to be done.  Everyone
would naturally expect a female police officer to search the nun in a
private room.

Well, for a devoted muslim woman lifting her veil in public in front
of many men is a violation of her personal modesty and of her devotion
to her religion.  Just like it would be a violation for a christian
nun to be searched by a male police officer.

If the government has no problem with finding a female police officer
to strip-search a Christian nun.  Then I see no reason why it would be
too much trouble for the government to find a female officer of the
court to identify a muslim woman.

This seems like common sense to me.

Which part of the body is decent or indecent to bare depends on
people's culture.

In some African cultures women routinely go around with bare breasts.
But in Canada, a woman would be arrested if she does the same.

The reason why Canadians don't allow women to go around with naked
breasts is because they believe that naked breasts will arouse undue
sexual passions in men and perhaps make them less respectful and less
responsible in their behavior with women.

Well, many muslims believe the same about baring the woman's face.
And many of them are just as strict about covering it up in front of
the men.

Just because their culture is different from ours doesn't mean that
they are wrong.  And we should have no respect for their sense of
modesty.

And if covering up one's body makes people unsuitable for residence
and citizenship in Canada.  Then perhaps all the Menonites, the
Hutterites, and the Catholic nuns should be expelled from Canada too.
Because their women refuse to dress in short-skirts and tight-fitting
pants the way most women in Canada normally dress.

Just because people are a minority and they are different from
everybody else doesn't mean that they have no place in society.  And
I'm sure you can relate to this kind of idea.  You are a foreigner in
Thailand.  And you are very different from the local people there in
many ways.  And I'm sure you wouldn't like to be excluded and expelled
from there just because you are different from the majority of Thais.

Whatever the Canadian motive for covering breasts is only tangentially
material; fact is that Canadian SOCIETY at large no more demands shrouding
of women than does Arabia countenance women going uncovered.
If a Canadian's or any other woman's religion demands that they go
uncovered, NO WAY is a country like Arabia going to 'respect their religious
beliefs,' yet you demand that Canadians kowtow to an Islamist dogma in CIVIL
venues?

Ummm, as the issue of identification is one that extends to ALL individuals

Huh?
If they 'have no place in society' (and talk about hyperbolic silliness,

When any of us are in Thailand (or Indonesia, or a great many other nations)
we see Muslim women going about with hair covered, and faces uncovered.
Their national identification cards have a picture with face covered?
You should know the answer !!

Your argument reduces simply to one of special treatment for a minority on
the 'strength' of their religious dogma, and as there are LARGER issues of
concern to the entire society, i.e., of the relaible and unobstructed
identification of individuals, that go not only to legal issues, but to
issues of public safety, the notion that Canadians or any other Western or
other society should hew to Arabian (e.g.) practices is no more than
wishfulness on your part--at best.

Yes, indeed I know the answer about the picture in the identification
card.  Normally that picture is covered up with papered-over flap that
can be lifted and the picture  looked at by a female person of
authority.

As for the fact that most muslim women don't cover their faces.  Who
says that all muslims must be alike?

There is plenty of diversity among Christians.  Some Christians go
around in mini-skirts.  And some dress like nuns covering up
everything except the face.  It's like that among muslims too.  It
would be wrong to force the nuns to go around in mini-skirts.  And it
would also be wrong to force devout muslim women to undress and reveal
parts of their bodies that they want to hide.

Just because the majority behaves in a certain way doesn't mean that
the minority among them must be forced to behave like that too.  That
kind of thing would be a violation of human rights.

But as far as security of society goes.  Are you suggesting that
female officers of the law cannot be trusted to check the identity of
devout muslim women?  Because if they can be trusted, then I don't see
why there is any problem at all here.  There are plenty of female
employees in the government in every department.  And having them do
their work with devout muslim women doesn't present any great expense,
hardship, or burden for the government.

Your own mention of covering breasts in Canada contradicts your contention.
By your sort of caprice, a bare breast sect --or one of outright 'holy
nudism' is having their rights oppressed by the social norm of covering
breasts.
Apparently, only a goodly number of EU beach resorts and certain isolated
pockets in the US 'respect the immodesty' of nudism/naturism?
Methinks not.
Again, you've not a ghost of a chance of getting Saudis to countenance

upon Western societies for the sake of a certain minority.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But as far as security of society goes.  Are you suggesting that female

I'm not suggesting ANY such thing.
I'm maintaining that as long as *anyone,* male or female, can hide behind a
veil, then as long as video match observations and other facial ID methods
are extant, then it is not only special treatment for a self-chosen
minority, but can easily be a risk to public safety, when known or suspected
criminals or other agents hide behind veils.

It's long been the case in a number of Mid-East nations (and others), that
women *and* men have hidden behind veils or other facial masks while making
escapes, when on missions of larceny or mayhem, or in other sorts of
subterfuge--that's just a fact.
The notion that an entire CIVIL society should make special accommodations
for a certain minority of Muslims, and put selves at greater risk of anyone
dangerous who choses to emulate the shrouded woman, is what you hold as some
sort of right of the minority.
Call it 'respect,' or call opposition 'tyranny of the majority,' but as ALL
have an interest in being secure, ALL are compromised by exempting from ease
of facial identification anyone who chooses to don the veil.

Hiding one's body doesn't arouse any human passions.  Whereas
revealing female body does arouse such passions.

That`s why societies all over the world have a right to tell people to
cover up according to local customs.   But no democratic society in
the world has ever forced people to bare their bodies in public in a
way that they personally didn't feel comfortable with.

People have a right not to be looked and treated as sex objects.  And
just because western standards of modesty are different from those of
other cultures doesn't mean that everybody has to copy westerners and
imitate them.

It's true that clothing can be used to disguise criminal activities
such as carrying narcotic drugs, guns, knives, and suicide bomb
vests.  And wearing dark glasses can often effectively disguise one's
face too.

When the UK government forces all of it's citizens to walk around half-
naked in order to make sure that they aren't up to some nefarious
activities.  Then perhaps they could also tell muslim women not to
wear the veil.

But as it stands now, people are free to conceal their faces with dark
glasses.  And that's not much different from muslim women veiling
their faces.

The only difference and the problem that we are talking about here is
whether the goverment should accomodate religious beliefs of devout
muslim women and allow them to reveal their identity only to female
officers of the government.  And I see no good reason why the male
government officers have to see the muslim woman's face too.  This
demand is capricious and totally unnecessary.

So, you snip away all rest of my text (obviously not in agreement, but
oh-so-easier to ignore counter-arguements en route to the soap box ;~)
. .. in order to first state a rationale for shrouding women (that directly
implies that men 'just can't help themselves but be aroused') and then go on
with various 'politically correct rights' that presume an ideologically
'enlghtened' populace.
This is simply a demand that Western society yield to Islamists what
Islamist society will never yield to the West.

That Islamists and you (or are you one?) put up women as temptresses akin to
Eve, in 'need' of protection from male eyes, even unto their faces, and also
in need of an oppression via 'male protectiveness' may be very well and fine
in a male-dominated (of course) Islamist theocracy, but 'tis not Canada's
nor other Western societies' ways.
This insistence by fiat of 'religious respect' trumping civil society's need
to know who stands in open court or before other official eyes is something
you think is buttressed by rationale for various degrees of purdah !

That's simply presumptive--and false, especially when considering that
checkpoints and civil courts are NOT private venues.

So if I don't feel comfortable revealing my fingertips, the irises of my
eyes, or even the unique shape of my ears to the immigration officers or
before a court of law, I should be granted this 'right'?

Funny, but not a one of the many many *obviously* Muslim women I have seen

women in their manner of dressing, nor have all but a tiny minority 'needed'
to cover all but their eyes--or beyond.

LOL !
The issue I presented is of IDENTIFICATION, and FACES are the *ne plus

This silliness about going half-naked is merely a bit of argumentative
diversion, that treats not with IDENTIFICATION, but possibly with the
concealment of materials, especially of contraband or weapons.
I realize it may be asking much for you to answer to my ACTUAL contentions,

Perhaps authorities in western countries often don't go out of their
way to accomodate religious beliefs and practices of their citizens,
especially if they happen to be muslims.  And that's too bad.  Because
they like to preach to other countries about human rights and respect
for people's religions.  Perhaps their preaching is nothing but
cultural imperialism.   They often don't practice what they preach.

But that paper flap over the picture is something I've seen myself.
And it didn't need to be issued by the government either.  The lady
was smart enough to make it herself.   She cut out a small piece of
