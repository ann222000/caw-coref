FACT VS. FICTION
Baby's gender cannot be established with timing
By Anahad O'Connor
April 24, 2007

THE CLAIM: For couples who know they want a girl or a boy, there is always
the fertility clinic. But is there a lower-tech method?

A technique called the Shettles method, popularized in the 1960s, holds that
couples can increase their odds of having a boy by, among other things,
having intercourse as close to ovulation as possible. Intercourse 2 or 3
days before ovulation,
preferably in the missionary position, supposedly heightens the odds of
having a girl.

The premise is that sperm carrying the X and Y chromosomes have different
characteristics, and that each is more likely to fertilize the egg - which
is always X - in different circumstances.

(NB:  1 chromosome travels faster but has a short life.  The 2nd is slower,
but has a longer-life.  Thus, if the ovum had just been dropped by the ovary
and was high in one of the tubes, the faster, (but short-life chromosome)
would die before reaching it - and the slower, long-living chromosome would
reach the egg.  Conversely, if the ovum is lower, the faster chromosome will
reach the ovum before the slower one and it will have a chance to fertilize
the egg.   JoeN.)

THE FACTS: But don't count on it. Several studies have tried to confirm the
claim but found no effect. In 1991, researchers at Johns Hopkins analyzed
the findings of six previous studies on the subject. They found that relying
on timing and position for "natural family planning" did not work.

A later study, in The New England Journal of Medicine, followed 221 healthy
women who were planning a pregnancy. Of those, 192 became pregnant during
the study period. Again, the researchers found no timing effect.

THE BOTTOM LINE: According to studies, timing and sexual position do not
influence the sex of the baby.
