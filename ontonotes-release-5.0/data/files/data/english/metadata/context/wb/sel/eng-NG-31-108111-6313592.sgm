I have a 9 month old boxer who we got late last fall so we never had a
chance to socialize him in the local dogparks.  He has met several
other dogs on a one-to-one basis and seems shy at first, but will
instantly begin to fight if provoked.  Up until 2 weeks ago we had
another dog and they got along marvelously from the very start.

Basically, I want him to be comfortable around other dogs and people
since we do a lot of outdoor activities.  Is it too late to introduce
him to a dogpark atmosphere? If not, are there steps that I can take
to ensure a safe venture?  Is taking him to the dogpark really the
right step at this moment?

Sorry, lots of questions... I appreciate any advice.

What provokes him?  Does the other dog growl first?  Is he fighting with the
other dog, or is he keeping the other dog away from you?  I grew up with
Boxers, and they have a definite tendency to be protective and not real
friendly with strange dogs.  One of ours DID NOT get along with other dogs,
and most didn't get along with EVERY other dog but would tolerate some.

I don't generally agree with dog parks.  It ain't like taking your toddler
to the playground for a play date.  IMO it is not possible for every dog to
socialize with other dogs to the extent that they're safe at a dog park.
Unfortunately, these days, "vicious dog" laws are sometimes applied to dogs
that fight with dogs, not merely dogs that bite people.  When you add in a
dog like  a Boxer - large and "bull-y" looking - you can be playing with
fire wrt legal consequences.  Plenty of people are bitten breaking up dog
fights.

There are things that can up the odds in favor of your dog.  For instance,
is he neutered?  Neutering may mellow him out some in this regard, although
there are no guarantees.  Good obedience training may help, also.  I'd
highly recommend both those for their own sake, because they'll make him a
better pet.

If this advice and that offered by others doesn't work, realize that your
dog doesn't have to play well with others to have a happy, fulfilled life
with you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Have you taken him to any obedience training classes?
">

No, we cannot afford obedience training.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What provokes him?
">

He is usually just curious around the other dogs until one of them
feels threatened and bears his teeth or begins growling, that is when
our Boxer steps up.  The first time it happened it was with my parents
old labrador who, I think, was just feeling overwhelmed with the
active young puppy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is he neutered?
">

Yes, but almost all of the incidences happened prior to that.  Also,
he was the alpha-male of the litter and was completely spoiled before
we took him.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Is his recall solid?
">

Yes, he seems to have a great memory.  He knows what is expected of
him, what is okay and what is not, etc.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Does he pay close attention to you?
">

Yes, he is always at my side and seems to pay quite close attention to
me when I speak or do almost anything.  He understands "No", "Off",
"Stop", "Sit", "Lay", etc...  Many times I don't even have to raise my
voice or be stern when commanding him to do something and he'll do it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Do you know how to recognize his behavior and correct it before he gets provoked?
">

Well, it has happened only a few times and it has been a while.  Even
with our other dog, our boxer would play until the other one would get
upset and bear his teeth or growl, then it escalated quickly.  When we
had both dogs they were easy enough to break up, but I would be
nervous around dogs I didn't know.

Also, when new people come to our house he is very protective yet shy
at first, but after a while seems to warm up to them and approaches
them with caution.  He did fine during our Thanksgiving get-together
after he came out of hiding, and he even played with the younger
children.  So I don't really see him as a "viscious" dog, but he
definately isn't one to back down from a fight.

I hope this helps to give a better understanding.  I really don't
think obedience training is in the future for us financially, but
maybe there are steps that I can take to help adjust him socially.

Thank you both.

His level of aggression with humans has little or no relation to his level
of aggression with other dogs. A dog can be completely "vicious" in regards
to other dogs - deadly, even - and be perfectly safe with humans.

With this specific breed, many Boxers are great with humans, but not really
to be trusted with other dogs they don't know well once they mature..and at
nine months, your dog is hitting adolescence, and is right at the age where
dog aggression usually begins to surface.

My observation of Boxers at our local park (I've been going there for
about 18 years, and have seen quite a few over that time period) years) is
that the majority of them do well playing as puppies - although they tend to
play too rough for some - but once they hit adolescense and maturity have to
be watched very carefully with other dogs.
Quite a few of them mature to be dog-aggressive to the point that if not
well trained (e.g. responsive to being called away from other dogs, staying
at heel, etc.) AND closely supervised, they have to be kept on leash or not
brought to the park. Again, dog-dog agression is not the same thing as
dog-human aggression; many of these same dogs are great with people.

It's not too late for your dog to be socialized, but "socialization" in this
case doesn't mean turning him loose off leash with other dogs and letting
him do as he pleases; it means TRAINING him to behave himself in the
presence of other dogs.
At nine months, he is at exactly the age where dog-dog agression usually
begins to surface if it's going to be there; odds are good that he's going
to not only continue with aggressive behaviour, but escalate.
Unless you are willing to TRAIN your dog, and to educate yourself to the
warning signs of impending aggression so that you can CALL HIM AWAY from
other dogs BEFORE the aggressive behaviour starts, IMO you need to stop
letting him off leash around other dogs.
It's not fair to the other dogs for you to be putting them at risk, and
it's not fair to *your* dog to allow him to continue with and be reinforced
in aggressive actions.

One of my pet peeves is people who can't get it through their heads that the
fact that their dog is good with people, safe around kids, etc., does NOT
mean that it's OK for the dog to repeatedly demonstrate obnoxious and
dangerous aggresssive behaviour towards other dogs.

">

So, I wanted to make clear that he is not the one who begins with
aggression, is just that he doesn't back down.  He is very playful
around them until they snip or become aggressive towards him.

As you say, maybe I will work on leash training and not worry so much
about the dog parks.  I would like to get to the point of being able
to take him on walks around other people and animals without having to
worry.  In those situations he wouldn't be running free anyway.

Sigh.  Obedience training fees are such a teeny portion of the financial

That's really not an acceptable response.  Dogs growl at each other for all
sorts of reasons, including a simple 'Get out of my face', and a dog that
goes on the offensive at something quite that simple, especially at such a
young age, is not a dog park candidate.

All the more reason why this dog needs work on how to behave around other
dogs, but does not belong in the dog park.

You don't have to go to a class to train your dog, although it certainly
helps to use a competent trainer.  What you need to work on is getting your
dog to focus on you, so you can walk past another dog without incident.

Given the breed and age of this dog, I would agree completely with Sarah.
In my experience (6 years of dog park time), the number of Boxers that can
come to the dog park without incident past their adolescence is miniscule.
They remain on the top of the list of dogs I am hypervigilant about when I
am at the dog park, even higher than AmStaffs and Pits.  Mostly because the
'dumbass owner' quotient is higher than the norm.

Subject: Aggressive Dal from shelter

I recently adopted a female, spayed 3 1/2 yr old
dalmatian from a no-kill shelter.  She spent 2
years in the shelter and naturally she has some
socialization issues to overcome.

My problem is I am not quite sure HOW to tackle these issues. . .

1.  She is aggresive toward **ALL** other dogs, even
dogs that have shown that they are willing to be submissive.
Upon sight of a dog, she lunges and snarls.

2.  She is usually kind and affectionate toward her owner
(me), but recently began turning sour and for no apparent
reason snarls toward me!  This has completely destroyed
the trust we were building over the past month.

3.  She deals with visitors, but is very anxious around
people she doesn't know.  At first she would scream if
a stranger petted her with 2 hands.  I just don't trust
her around anyone yet.

4.  She lunged at my sisters 2 year old the same way she
lunged toward other dogs, aggressively.

I really really like this dog, when she is calm and able
to relax.  I want to keep her, but I don't really know
what the best way to establish the necessary trust.

Any ideas out there?

Here some SUCCESS STORIES ive had using JERRY'S MANUAL

1) My dogz, two bitches - Vicious, barking, aggressive, pulled
on leash, wanted to kill any dogs they saw, fought between
each other. TWO WEEKS using Jerry's manual, they were calm,
friends, my companions.

2) ADDED A BEAGLE PUPPY (male) to my "PACK", the
girls had -NO PROBLEMS- with him from the moment
I dropped him by their noses.

3) My FRIENDS dogs  2 MALES barking and jumping
at the fence all night 3 DAYS TRAINING WITH JERRY'S
MANUAL they were CALMED AND HAVEN'T BARKED ONCE!

Added a NEW MALE DOG (2 yrs old) AND
WELCOMED HIM WITH NO WUCKAS !

4) POODLE that ATE food from the KITCHEN BENCH -
lock him in a box? NO! USE JERRYS MANUAL! 4 DAYS
AND HES NEVER DONE IT SINCE!

5) ABUSED DOGS AT THE SHELTER I WORK AT -
HAD TO BE FED WITH A BUCKET ON A STICK -
ONE WEEK ON JERRYS MANUAL, THE SUPERVISOR
TOLD ME TO PUT THEM IN THE PUBLIC KENNELS
FOR SALE !

Quite amazing to - I thought they were just dull
coloured dogs, but after I had removed the fear
and anxiety their hairs coloured up amazingly.

6) STAFFY FEMALE who would NOT DROP HER
BALL! She carried it around all day and night - 3
DAYS on jerrys MANUAL and she now DROPS
it when u ASK her to!

BWHWHAHAHAHAAHA !!!!

I'm not a trainer and my experience is limited to my
two dogs, so take it for what it's worth. As someone
who had to deal with a puppy who had his own ideas
about what was and what wasn't "proper behavior", I
was very happy to find The Amazing Puppy Wizard's
dog training method.

It is a method that is gentle to the dog, very easy
to apply and it has been working wonderfully with
both my dogs, giving practically instant results.

It was as if I had been given the "key" to understanding
and controlling my puppy's behavior: suddenly, he was
istening to me, doing what I was asking him to do, instead
of constantly opposing me.

It also worked with some issues my older dog had, too -
her fear of thunder, her barking and her aggression
towards another female dog.

Don't let either the first impression about the "weirdness"
of The Amazing Puppy Wizard, or the regulars' negative opinion
of him (there's a long history behind it) deter you from at
least reading the manual and deciding for yourself if you
want to try it or not.

I wish all the best to you and your dog.

this claim is justified (except the part about "sitting

away from him - MY two dogs.

For instance, he told me exactly what to do when Bonnie was

Also, his advice about how to deal with her fear of thunder

"Paul E. Schoen" &lt;pst ... @smart.net&gt; wrote

Hello everyone:

If you have followed some of my posts, you know something
about the ongoing story of Muttley, the large GSD/Chow dog
I have been trying to adopt or place in a better home.

I will add a bit more history later in this post.

Last Tuesday, toward the end of Janet's obedience class,
Muttley and I had just finished fairly successfully performing
a sit/stay/come routine, and then he was sitting by my side.

The final routine was to be a "down", which Muttley has had
some difficulty with, and frankly I have not had the time to
work with him much on that.

I was kneeling at his side, trying to hold his collar while
pushing his front legs down to the position, while he resisted.
Suddenly he lunged, knocking me over onto the parking lot, and
I lost grip of the leash as I reflexively broke my fall.

Muttley took the opportunity to attack a young black male
Lab to my left, and it was a very brutal attack. Janet and
the instructors tried to gain control, and as soon as I
could get to my feet I grabbed the leash and pulled him off.

That was  the end of the class, and the other dog, Bernie,
was taken to an animal hospital for treatment. When everyone
had left, Janet counseled me about what should be done about
Muttley.

She said this was more than ordinary aggression, and only
intensive (and expensive) one on one training would have
any chance at working, and in any case, he was not suited
to group training.

She advised me that Muttley could be dangerous, and she
recommended that he be euthanized. "They can't all be saved".

&lt;snip&gt;

If I did not have to worry about my cat, I would probably
keep him, and I am certain I could avoid any more dangerous
episodes. I probably would not have taken him to obedience
classes at this time if that was not such a difficult issue,
and if people here had not essentially shamed me into doing so.

Then he would only be a bratty dog with a mind of his own,
but he would not have been identified as dangerous.

PUPPY MILL and SHOCK COLLAR trainin SALES, aka DOGMAN.

Here's your miserable stinkin lyin punk thug coward
animal murderin active acute chronic life long incurable
mental case pal tommy soronson:

tommy sez:

At no time do the Monks *ever* advocate beating a
dog. A swat on the rump or a check to the chin does
*not* constitute a "beating."

And then he sez:

"I don't know how big you are, kiddo, so this may
not be as easy for you as it is for me, but use
a little "knee action," that is, as the dog goes
charging by you, just give the dog a little bop
with your knee and shin.  Yep, really lean into it.

Even knock her over, if you can, but make sure to
make her think twice about rushing past you again -
- which is exactly what you want her to do.

Don't bother with scolding her, she'll get the message.

If it happens again, just REPEAT the knee action.

When she steps on your toes, just pick up your foot
abruptly and nudge her with your knee.  Again, no
scolding is necessary here, so you don't have to
worry about her "over-reacting."

I don't think this is necessarily a lack of respect
for you, just a lack of training.  That is, she just
needs *more* of it."

You mean like HOWE when you HOWEsbreak a dog an
you beat IT with a switch or heavy man's leather belt and
tie him next to his evil deed and return to BEAT HIM every
twenty minutes, tommy?

tommy SEZ:

"My objective is always to find a way that WORKS.
And if it is DANGEROUS behavior that I'm trying
to modify, behavior than can get the dog KILLED,
I will resort to ANYTHING to save him.

A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G.

Okay.  Call me a cruel, inhumane, abusive bastard
if you want to, but it doesn't affect me at all.
When you've saved the lives of as many dogs as I
have, you'll learn that that's the only thing that
really matters.  Saving lives and making dogs become
good citizens"

Subject: My GSD bit me.
The question:

I have a four year old male GSD.  He growls at me sometimes.
When he growls at me he stares me in the face and lays his
ears back.

The New Skete books say that the dog should not be allowed
to do that.  They suggest shaking down the dog by grabing
the dog on the sides of his neck and picking him off his
front feet, then giving the dog the same sort of treatment
the dog would give another if it were challenging him.

Namely getting in the dogs face and letting
the dog know you are the alpha dog.

Well, my dog bit me clearly he felt that I was not
convincing enough or he bit me out of fear.

Anyone got ideas on what to do with this dog that might
help him to decide that he wants to follow and that he
has nothing to fear from me?

You need to improve your acting skills.  Get a werewolf
suit with blood-drenched fangs and claw gloves and THEN
go after your dog.

Knock the shit out of him and don't be afraid to crack
some ribs. Then yank the mask off and shout "SURPRISE!
IT'S ME!"  I guarantee you and your dog will have a new
relationship based on mutual respect.

Keep in mind that the monks of New Skete were pre-Lon-Chaney.

A scat mat directly in front of the door, can be stepped

I think it's a great solution.

BTW they can run on a 9V battery, so no wires are needed.

They are fixtures on my leather furniture to stop kitties

Just another opinion that Scat Mats are pretty useful tools.

Rather than have my youngest cat continue to ruin my
leather furniture, we have Scat Mats on the sofa and
chair.

When they are off, and we're sitting on that furniture,
Skip is allowed on and in our laps, etc.  When the mats
are on, I can be happy with the fact that he's not
urinating on the leather!

The static charge isn't much at all - it's a deterrent,
and a good one.
