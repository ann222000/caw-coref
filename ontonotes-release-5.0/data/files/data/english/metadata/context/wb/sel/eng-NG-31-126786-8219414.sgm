Disputes and actions

1.1 NUM calls strike as workers reject 8% raise offered by De Beers

Amy Musgrave, Political Correspondent, Business Day, 27 July 2007

MEMBERS of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) are to down tools at diamond miner De Beers from Tuesday over wages.

The union's members yesterday voted overwhelmingly for the strike in protest at the 8% pay rise being offered by the company. The NUM wants 11%.

Although the company has put in place contingency plans in the event of a strike, it is expected to have a negative effect on its South African operations as the NUM represents 3350 of the 6000 employees in the country. De Beers has six mines in SA as well as the Diamond Trading Company.

Peter Bailey, an NUM negotiator at De Beers, said yesterday the union's members also opposed a two-year agreement being offered by the company.

&quot;Workers have told us in no uncertain terms that double- digits is the route. They reiterated this by calling for strike action to force De Beers to accede to their demands,&quot; Bailey said.

&quot;De Beers continues to preach 8% and a two-year agreement and we have said no.&quot;

De Beers spokesman Tom Tweedy confirmed that, following a shop steward's meeting, the union had notified the company of its intention to strike.

He said although De Beers remained committed to reaching an amicable settlement, it believed its offer on the table was &quot;fair and attractive&quot;. The company had increased it wage offer from 7% to 8%.

The De Beers offer includes an 8% increase of basic wages for this year, with the lowest-paid employee receiving a new minimum wage of R3910, and an 8% increase of basic wages for next year, with a new minimum wage of R4223. The wage increases are on condition of the conclusion of a two-year agreement. De Beers has also offered to increase family responsibility leave from four to five days.

The offer was rejected at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) last week and the CCMA issued the NUM with a certificate indicating that the matter remains unresolved.

Tweedy said a disruption to De Beers' operations would have a negative effect on the company and its employees.

&quot;It is not possible to estimate the impact a strike may have on the mines. Too many variables exist.

&quot;However, in the longer term a strike can have an impact on production and on the welfare of employees who do not receive pay while on strike. A stayaway will affect the employees' gain scheme incentive programme operating on each mine,&quot; he said.

Bailey said no meeting was in the pipeline to resolve the impasse.

1.2 SA miners 'demand their slice of the pie' as strikes threaten
Natale Labia, The Indepenent (UK), 26 July 2007

The South African National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) announced yesterday that it had voted in favour of strikes beginning next Tuesday at the world's largest diamond producer, De Beers, over a wage dispute.

Eleven thousand miners are preparing to lay down their tools after rejecting De Beers' latest offer of an 8 per cent increase. The NUM, the country's largest mining union, is demanding 11 per cent. &quot;Workers have told us ... that double digits is the route. They've reiterated that this afternoon by calling for strike action to force De Beers to accede to the demands,&quot; said Peter Bailey, the NUM's negotiator at De Beers.

De Beers said yesterday in an emailed statement that it is determined to continue operating its mines through a contingency plan. &quot;We are committed to reaching an amicable settlement and are confident that our final offer is fair and attractive,&quot; it said.

Anglo American, 45 per cent owner of De Beers, &quot;will be strongly affected&quot; by strike action said a Numis analyst. Shares in Anglo American fell 187p to 2,853p yesterday.

Analysts also warned that increasing pressure from South African trade unions could affect the stock value of London-listed gold and platinum mining houses. &quot;Strikes are becoming an increasingly political issue in South Africa. Workers are being hit by rising inflation and want to capitalise on surging metals prices. They're starting to demand their slice of the pie,&quot; says Numis's analyst Mark Elliott.

Anglo American, AngloGold Ashanti, Lonmin and Aquarius stock &quot;could be badly affected. Prospects for South African mining in general are dire&quot;, says Seymour Pierce's Charles Kernot. As the strikes continue, forcing some firms to cut production, the price of gold and platinum will increase.

This will benefit &quot;those companies that have more mechanised production techniques and contract-based labour. These firms will capitalise on higher commodity values, which will be reflected in their share price. Those that cannot will suffer.&quot;

Aquarius Platinum has lost 58p since Monday to close yesterday at 1,481p after cuts in production due to last week's strike, with Seymour Pierce downgrading it to sell status. The mass-action at the Kroondal mines ended on Monday, but led to a drop of 4,700 ounces of platinum production. Despite a switch to more capital-intensive production techniques, an analyst described the trading update on Wednesday as &quot;not good news at all&quot;.

Similarly, AngloGold Ashanti, one of South Africa's biggest gold miners, raised its previous 7 per cent wage increase on Monday, but unions continued to demand a 15 per centrise. &quot;We reject the 7.25 per cent. They utter complete bile at us,&quot; said Deon Boqwana, one of the NUM negotiators.

The union has also voiced concern at the rising number of mining casualties. The bodies of two miners recovered on the weekend at the AngloGold's Moab Khatsong mine has taken the number of deaths this year in South African mines to 110, showing no improvement on last year's statistics.

1.3 Ceppwawu: deadlock in wage negotiations

IOL, 26 July 2007

Ceppwawu, which represents employees in the chemical and paper industries, will embark on a strike following a deadlock in wage negotiations with their employers.

Ceppwawu (Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood, and Allied Workers' Union) was demanding a 10 percent increase across the board, 20 percent allowance for all shifts, and that temporary employees who performed permanent work be made permanent, spokesperson Keith Jacobs said on Thursday.

The union started negotiations in May along with the Chemical Bargaining Council and the Wood and Paper Bargaining Council, but the negotiations entered into deadlock on June 26 in all the chambers.

&quot;Both the bilateral processes and the conciliation processes failed to resolve the dispute and Ceppwawu has now issued 48 hour notices to all the employer associations,&quot; he said. The strike will take place on July 30 in most industrial areas across the country.

Ceppwawu's membership is drawn from sectors such as petroleum, pharmaceuticals, pulp and paper and saw-milling.

The various employers are offering between six and eight percent increment. - Sapa

1.4 No date set for talks to end tyre sector strike - union

Nelendhre Moodley, Engineering News, 26 July 2007

A date for the next meeting in the wage dispute between tyre industry employers and workers has not been scheduled, after wage negotiations deadlocked this week.

The strike has continued on its fifth day with almost 4 000 of the 6 000 workers having downed tools last week.

&quot;Since the talks collapsed on Tuesday, there has been no agreement or consultation. The strike is still continuing,&quot; National Union of Metalworkers South Africa (Numsa) spokesperson Mziwakhe Hlangani said on Thursday.

Industry spokesperson Attie Higgs said that he was hopeful that a meeting between employers and trade unions would take place sometime next week.

Tyre manufacturers Dunlop, Continental and Goodyear had made a 7,5% wage offer, with Bridgestone having offered a 7% wage increase.

Unions are demanding 10%.

Higgs reiterated his earlier sentiments saying that in the short term the strike impact was limited, but that should the strike extend over a longer period, the impact would be severe.

Tyre manufacturer Continental Tyres on Tuesday reported limited production of some 30%.

Goodyear too was currently sustaining limited production, however, there was no production at Bridgestone as the company had issued a lock out notice to all employees on Friday.

Bridgestone group communications GM Romano Daniels had said on Tuesday that the company could not afford an extended strike.

1.5 Health workers victimised after strike: union

SABC, 26 July 2007

The Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in the Western Cape says health workers are being victimised after the recent public sector strike. Cosatu plans to go on strike next Thursday, in an attempt to force the provincial government to find a solution to their demands.

Tony Ehrenreich, the Cosatu secretary in the province, says dismissed health workers must be reinstated. He says they also want the needs of learners to be addressed.

Ehrenreich says: &quot;Cosatu met with government today, to try and advance a solution to the potential strike. because of government's refusal to put in place a recovery plan for education and to deal with the victimisation of workers who were on strike. The government unfortunately sent beaurocrats to the meeting, who could not reach an agreement with us.&quot;

Ehrenreich says if government persists with this attitude, the strike will be inevitable. The provincial government could not be reached for comment.

1.6 Samwu protests outside Rand Water

IOL, 26 July 2007

Stopstewards of the SA Municipal Worker's Union (Samwu) protested on Thursday over a pay dispute with Rand Water outside the company headquarters in Johannesburg.

Samwu Greater Vaal branch chairperson Cornelius Tsepetsi said nearly 80 shopstewards had participated and that a memorandum was given to management.

A dispute resolution meeting will be held on Friday at 9am.

A shopstewards area council meeting on Tuesday rejected a wage agreement introduced by Rand Water management last Friday. - Sapa

1.7 SAMWU march court case postponed

IOL, 26 July 2007

The matter of two municipal employees arrested during an illegal march was postponed in the Germiston magistrate's court on Thursday.

It was put off until August 22 for further evidence to be heard.

The pair, both members of the SA Municipal Workers' Union, are charged with contravening the Gatherings Act. They were arrested on November 20 last year after a march over racism and salary issues.

Ekurhuleni metro police chief Robert McBride testified on Thursday that he had declared the march illegal. &quot;Authority for the march was not granted,&quot; he said.

He added that during a meeting with the union last year, union leader Sam Malope refused to have the meeting videotaped.

&quot;Samwu objected to the recording of the meeting... Malope walked out threatening to march by force,&quot; said McBride.

McBride added that he had personally given a letter to branch secretary Koena Ramotlou stating that the march was illegal.

&quot;I handed a letter to Ramotlou saying that the march was prohibited&quot;.

He said he did not grant the union permission to march because of events during previous marches.

&quot;In the past union members destroyed council property while demonstrating.&quot;

The union did embark on a march during which metro police fired rubber bullets at workers, and shop steward Attie Kous and union member Paulos Zulu were arrested.

The union's advocate Gys Rautenbach said McBride fired shots at the workers.

&quot;I fired a single shot that hit Zulu in his hand,&quot; said McBride.

Kous was arrested after he led about 30 union members out of one of two buses and started stoning police. McBride said the workers were protesting near the Kraft road offramp after he turned them away at the municipal offices' parking lot.

&quot;They were chanting and obstructing traffic.&quot;

According to McBride, Zulu showed his fists and pulled a finger against his throat.

Zulu ignored officers instructing him to stop. &quot;He resisted arrest,&quot; said McBride.

The magistrate postponed the matter, adding that McBride was still under oath and would face further cross-examination when the matter resumes.

A warrant of arrest was issued after a second witness who was supposed to appear in court did not arrive.

Earlier, court proceedings were disrupted when Kous' car was towed away from the court parking. Union members outside alleged that McBride had ordered the car be removed.

While outside the courtroom McBride said: &quot;I am on leave, this a total lie.&quot;

Several union members had gathered at the court building calling for the dismissal of McBride as metro police chief.

Speaking outside the courtroom, Ramotlou said: &quot;The protest near the court went well... there were 108 shopstewards who attended.&quot; - Sapa

1.8 'Maid agencies' need to clean up their act, says domestic worker union

Terry Bell, Business Report, 27 July 2007

Most weekday mornings at railway, taxi and bus stations in urban centres around the country, groups of workers wait to be picked up by minibuses. These take them to suburban homes and city apartments for a day of house, child care or garden work.

They are supposedly contract cleaners, nannies and gardeners who work usually on a daily basis and sometimes receive as little as R20, depending on the hours worked.

According to the SA Domestic Service and Allied Workers' Union (Sadsawu), the average daily hours worked are five and the pay for this is R35. However, many workers have to pay R15 a day in transport costs to and from the pick-up point.

Yet they are among the more fortunate of this veritable army of workers. Others are women bussed in from the rural areas and housed in often appalling conditions by labour brokers. They are ferried to work each day from the backyard sheds and garages where they are housed.

&quot;These agencies are often just a desk, a chair, a telephone and a book,&quot; said Myrtle Witbooi, Sadsawu general secretary. &quot;And as long as the book is in order, showing that workers are paid R6 an hour for the time worked, the labour department does nothing.&quot;

She pointed out that one such establishment, where more than 20 women were housed in a garage with one toilet, was closed down only for health reasons.

&quot;Their books were in order, so they were fine as far as the labour department was concerned,&quot; she said.

Sadsawu is also critical of many of the agencies using resident urban workers.

&quot;For them, the labour laws are just bits of paper and they make big money by getting around the laws,&quot; Witbooi said.

These agencies charge R160 a day or more for casual domestic help, while paying workers perhaps R40, less the claimed cost of transport.

One agency operating in Cape Town's southern suburbs charges R180 a day for a &quot;maid service&quot;.

For the servant-employing classes fearful of the consequences of the labour laws, it offers a &quot;flexible, easy-to-hire, easy-to-fire service&quot;. This, it claims, is for a &quot;full-time, part-time, ad hoc&quot; maid service &quot;from emergency relief to full-time outsourcing&quot;.

It is the &quot;easy-to-fire&quot; claim that has union hackles rising.

The agencies are able to make this claim by maintaining that they merely provide a service for self-employed workers. This is a fiction the labour movement wants exposed and dealt with.

But with a vast number of poor and often desperate unemployed women and men available, agency operators are in a strong position.

Workers, especially those placed in a fairly regular series of jobs, however poorly paid, are reluctant to complain openly.

As far as the unions are concerned, the minimum hourly rate should be raised to R10 and agencies should be closely monitored and made to provide full employee status for the pool of labour they hire out.

This they are already supposed to do, and there are registered agencies that operate in accordance with the labour laws. But many do not.

These are issues Sadsawu intends to raise when the Presidential Women's Group meets with President Thabo Mbeki in Pretoria. The meeting was initially scheduled for next Tuesday, but has been delayed.

Also on the agenda for this meeting is a new scheme to make pension provision available to the most vulnerable - and mainly female - workers. Insurance giant Old Mutual is heavily involved.

By August 9, plans should be well under way for the launch of a pension fund for domestic workers.

The new scheme has been tailored to cater for workers who labour for two, three or five days a week. It will apparently be administered in the initial period by Old Mutual. The more than 500 domestic workers employed by Old Mutual staff are likely to be the first members enrolled.

However, it seems the scheme will be voluntary. Employers may incorporate it into the pay packets of their workers or leave it to the workers to sign up on their own.

2.1 SA Communist Party seeks stronger ties with ANC

SABC, 26 July 2007

Gwede Mantashe, the newly elected SA Communist Party (SACP) chairperson, says he will endeavour to strengthen relations between the party and the ANC.

At the heart of the conflict are the differences around ideology and economic policy. Blade Nzimande, the general secretary of the SACP, and President Thabo Mbeki have had several public spats. However, Mantashe seems to have a more conciliatory approach. Mantashe also warned his party to get its house in order.

The former National Union of Mineworkers leader took over the reigns from Charles Nqakula during the party's national conference in Cape Town.

2.2 ANC clears decks ahead of succession standoff

Karima Brown, Political Editor, Business Day, 27 July 2007

THE African National Congress (ANC) has warned of extraordinary steps to prevent manipulation and fraud in the make-up of party membership lists that will be crucial to the outcome of the succession race at its conference later this year.

The warning on membership lists comes as the party's top brass gather this weekend in a watershed meeting that could have a major bearing on the succession struggle.

On the agenda of the national executive committee (NEC) meeting will be the vexed question of party membership, and how local and provincial delegations will be made up for the ANC's elective conference in December.

The weekend meeting takes place amid tension over accusations of inflated branch memberships.

The gathering will also discuss whether to shift the conference venue from Polokwane in Limpopo to Gauteng.

ANC secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe said yesterday the party would conduct &quot;random spot checks&quot; on branches as well as scrutinise attendance records of members at branch meetings.

&quot;In some cases we're going to physically check addresses on application forms because we are trying to prevent a situation where an individual can just sign up people, pay their membership and corrupt the process,&quot; he told Business Day.

Motlanthe said the party wanted to be sure that the selection of conference delegates was &quot;an expression of the majority&quot;.

Branches, including some in Free State, have already resorted to court action in an attempt to determine their membership. And in 2002 the ANC leadership nullified its Eastern Cape party election result due to allegations of fraud.

ANC insiders have said that in some provinces, including Eastern Cape, party membership was up for sale.

&quot;We call this the FNB (First National Bank) phenomenon ,&quot; an insider said.

He was referring to instances in which wealthy ANC patrons &quot;bought&quot; members for the organisation by paying their fees and securing their allegiance.

Aubrey Matshiqi, political analyst at the Centre for Policy Studies, said yesterday the reason the party wanted its audit process to be beyond approach was because it was aware that perceptions of fraud and manipulation could destabilise the conference. &quot;There is an obvious linkage between the auditing process and the leadership race simply because people are going to look at whether the process was managed in a way either to promote or undermine particular factional interests with the aim of predetermining the outcome of the presidential race,&quot; he said.

Conference preparations, including the auditing of branches, which constitute 90% of the voting delegates, will dominate discussions at the NEC meeting.

The ANC has been plagued by unverified complaints in the Nelson Mandela metro over the status of branches. Its Eastern Cape congress last year was rocked by similar allegations by at least three regions, which lodged complaints at Luthuli House over the status of branches and delegates.

The process for nominations commences in October. It is also expected that the NEC will finalise a cut-off date for conference delegates to be signed up, as well as draw up draft guidelines.

&quot;If the NEC says the cut-off date is at the end of August, what this means is that anybody who joins the ANC after that date will not be considered ANC members for purposes of the conference,&quot; Motlanthe said.

There is widespread speculation that the ANC conference will no longer be held in Limpopo. Gauteng is being punted as an alternative as Limpopo is said to lack the necessary infrastructure.

Motlanthe would not confirm whether the conference would be shifted, but he said the party's NEC meeting would discuss a progress report on conference preparations. &quot;At the last NEC we were still decided on Limpopo, but the committee was asked to look at alternative venues because we do not want to be caught with our pants down.&quot;

The ANC's presidential succession race is seen primarily as a contest between President Thabo Mbeki and his rival, ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma. It has rent the organisation down the middle as factions slug it out for control of the party. Given this dogfight, even the venue of this gathering assumes significance as provinces vie for influence .

While Eastern Cape is seen as largely pro-Mbeki, KwaZulu-Natal is regarded as Zuma's stronghold. The other provinces are more nuanced in where they stand on the leadership question, with some split on the issue. Gauteng has been flagging businessman Tokyo Sexwale as a way out of the Mbeki-Zuma cul-de-sac. Limpopo premier Sello Moloto is regarded as a close Mbeki ally.

2.3 Witch-hunt at SABC

Lloyd Gedye and Adriaan Basson, Mail &amp; Guardian, 27 July 2007

South African Broadcasting Corporation CEO Dali Mpofu this week asked his top 20 managers to sign letters consenting to undergo polygraph tests in an effort to determine the source of the leaked internal audit report the Mail &amp; Guardian was interdicted from publishing last week.

On Thursday, SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago confirmed that Mpofu was investigating the leak, adding that he could provide no further details until the investigation was completed.

However, the M&amp;G has learnt that Mpofu called a group executive meeting on Monday at which he expressed his disappointment at the fact that the report, which centres on the activities of [SUBJECT TO INTERDICT], was leaked to the M&amp;G.

It is understood that only four of the 20-odd managers present at the meeting had had access to the report, which was completed on July 3.

Two independent sources inside the corporation told the M&amp;G that the managers were asked to sign letters of consent agreeing to participate in lie detector tests. Everyone was said to have signed.

The sources said that it was unclear whether the polygraph test threat was a tactic to flush out the culprit, or if the tests were still to be conducted.

One of the sources also alleged that SABC CCTV material has been scrutinised to smoke out the M&amp;G's source.

The hunt for the source of the leak comes against the background of Kganyago's assertion this week that the report had been stolen.

&quot;The report on which these stories are based is a proceed of theft against the SABC and no person or newspaper should use it for commercial gain. Those who do so are accomplices in this theft,&quot; Kganyago said in a press statement.

Asked to explain the basis of his claim and whether a complaint of theft had been laid with the police, Kganyago said these matters formed part of Mpofu's investigation.

SABC staffers who spoke to the M&amp;G this week remarked on the contrast between top management's tardiness in acting on the report's findings and the swift and determined moves to establish the source of the leak.

The president of the Broadcasting, Electronic, Media and Allied Workers' Union (Bemawu), Hannes du Buisson, lashed out at Mpofu for not suspending [SUBJECT TO INTERDICT]. Bemawu is the biggest union in the SABC, representing about 1 000 employees.

&quot;That should have been the first thing to happen after prima facie evidence against [SUBJECT TO INTERDICT] was placed before Mpofu. He should have suspended [SUBJECT TO INTERDICT] pending the investigation,&quot; Du Buisson said. &quot;That's what happens to other employees against whom much less serious allegations are made. [SUBJECT TO INTERDICT] should have been charged by now.&quot;

He said the impression created by this absence of sanctions was that the SABC is &quot;dragging its feet&quot; and that the executive concerned was untouchable.

&quot;I'm convinced that there are people [in the SABC] who think that they are untouchable, but ultimately they are not. If the correct channels are followed, the public starts asking questions.&quot;

Added one of the M&amp;G's sources: &quot;The atmosphere at the SABC is not very conducive to dissenting voices at the moment.&quot;

2.4 SABC man accused of milking Post Office

Stefaans Brummer, Mail &amp; Guardian, 27 July 2007

South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) legal services head Mafika Sihlali stands accused of milking the South African Post Office of millions of rands in fees that were not earned.

Sihlali's former legal practice charged more than R6-million to restructure the parastatal -- an exercise that came to naught, according to a draft forensic report obtained by the Mail &amp; Guardian.

The report says the expenditure appeared &quot;fruitless and wasteful&quot;, violating the Public Finance Management Act. It states:

a.. Sihlali was paid two retainer packages a year apart for the same job, one worth R4,6-million and the other R2-million.
b.. The payment arrangement appeared &quot;highly irregular&quot;.
c.. Most invoices, requisitions and purchase orders relating to the R4,6-million package were missing.
Sihlali has been a controversial figure since his appointment last August as head of legal and business advisory services at the SABC.

Only six weeks into the job, he led an unsuccessful attempt to interdict M&amp;G Online from publishing the SABC &quot;blacklisting&quot; report. He also drove last week's abandoned attempt to stop the M&amp;G screening the documentary Unauthorised: Thabo Mbeki at its Critical Thinking Forum.

Sihlali's pre-existing business relationship with his fellow lawyer and boss, SABC CEO Dali Mpofu, has also raised eyebrows.

The draft forensic report details how Sihlali's former private practice, Sihlali Molefe Incorporated, charged the Post Office more than R12-million between 2003 and 2005 while apparently delivering little value.

Topping the list were nine &quot;retainer&quot; payments in 2003 totalling R4,6-million to assist in corporate restructuring. A year later Sihlali's firm received another six &quot;retainer&quot; payments totalling more than R2-million, again to do the same job. The Post Office was never restructured as intended.

Campaign cut short
The draft report was prepared for the Post Office last year as part of a controversial clean-up campaign under the leadership of then CEO Khutso Mampeule. It appears to have gathered dust since Mampeule was dismissed in the wake of a vehement counter-campaign by his predecessor and first target, Maanda Manyatshe.

The Post Office fired Mampeule after an investigation commissioned by Communications Minister Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri found, among other things, that he should have informed the Post Office board about a decision to lay criminal charges against Manyatshe.

Mampeule has said he will challenge his dismissal in court.

Mampeule's charges against Manyatshe related to allegations of impropriety in a R100-million contract for the revamping of Post Office branches, first revealed by the M&amp;G. Manyatshe, who was ousted as CEO of MTN South Africa in the ensuing scandal, last week filed an unprecedented R270-million damages claim against the Post Office.

The draft report in possession of the M&amp;G points a finger at Manyatshe, who approved both retainer agreements with Sihlali Molefe Incorporated. It says: &quot;While a number of additional documents are required in order to complete the picture, it would seem apparent at this stage that [Sihlali Molefe] has been paid some R6,69-million in respect of [the Post Office] restructuring process which has not yet occurred.

&quot;The amount was paid by way of a series of 15 retainer payments as provided for in two different retainer agreements, approximately one year apart, each of which appears to cover essentially the same services. This appears to have taken place with the knowledge and support of a number of senior [Post Office] executives, including the former CEO, Mr Manyatshe.&quot;

The expenditure, the report says, was &quot;on the face of it . irregular, fruitless and wasteful&quot; -- a breach of the Public Finance Management Act.

First agreement
Sihlali's formal history with the Post Office appears to have started in January 2003, when Manyatshe signed a nine-month &quot;retainer&quot; agreement with Sihlali Molefe. The agreed fee was R450 000 a month -- R4,6-million over the period, including VAT.

Under the agreement, Sihlali Molefe was to have advised on and prepared the necessary documentation to restructure the Post Office into a holding company, with operating divisions transferred to a number of subsidiary companies to be formed.

The report charges that the retainer arrangement appeared &quot;highly irregular&quot; considering the scope of the work. &quot;Normally one would have expected that for the work done ... a straight hourly rate would have been charged.&quot;

In February 2003 -- the month after the agreement was clinched -- the Post Office board approved the restructuring, resolving that it &quot;must be pursued vigorously&quot;.

While the report lists some correspondence between Post Office officials and Sihlali Molefe regarding documentation prepared towards this end, it also says: &quot;We were unable to find any evidence of any work undertaken by [Sihlali Molefe] pursuant to the first agreement.&quot;

Invoices, requisitions and purchase orders relating to the R4,6-million were also largely &quot;missing from the boxes . in which they are recorded as having been placed&quot;.

The M&amp;G has found three companies registered during July 2003 with names suggesting they were intended Post Office subsidiaries, but which appear to be dormant. The main divisions of the Post Office remain just that -- divisions.

Second agreement
In September 2004 Manyatshe and Sihlali Molefe entered a second &quot;retainer&quot; agreement, this time for a period of six months at a monthly fee of R300 000. The total for the period, VAT included, was R2,05-million.

In January 2005 Sihlali Molefe sent the Post Office a number of documents relevant to the restructuring, including draft board resolutions and a memorandum of incorporation.

These, the report notes, were &quot;standard form documents which can be obtained from a book such as Butterworths Forms and Precedents&quot;.

In March that year the Post Office instructed Sihlali Molefe to &quot;focus exclusively on the corporatisation of Postbank and discontinue work on the other parts of the original assignment.&quot;

The report alleges: &quot;The services for which [Sihlali Molefe] was engaged remained substantially outstanding.&quot;

Postbank remains a division, and not a subsidiary, of the Post Office.

The report recorded further large disbursements to Sihlali Molefe, including 10 amounts of R399 000 each for due diligence reports during the period May 2003 to January 2004 -- almost R4-million in total.

The report says a view could not be expressed on the due diligence studies in the absence of further documentation, but &quot;the fees charged seem prima facie to be exceptionally high&quot;. Again, supporting documents appeared to have &quot;gone missing&quot;.

How they responded
Lawyer Barry Aaron said on behalf of Mafika Sihlali: &quot;The allegations are sweeping and unsubstantiated. Although this particular report, which my client has not seen, is incomplete, the allegations themselves have been tested in a three-month-long disciplinary procedure conducted by the Post Office against its senior legal adviser. The arbitrator, appointed by the Post Office, found the senior legal adviser not guilty of these charges.

&quot;The allegations are denied by my client, who feels that they are part of the sustained attack against him by those [SUBJECT TO INTERDICT] opposed to what he is trying to accomplish.&quot;

Bart Henderson said on Maanda Manyatshe's behalf: &quot;As you are . aware summons was issued in the High Court of Pretoria on Friday 20 July 2007 against [the post office] for damages suffered by Maanda Manyatshe.

&quot;We can only conclude that the leaking of an incomplete, unsubstantiated report to your paper was done to subvert this process in an act of malice of forethought and intent.

&quot;Suffice it to say the matter you address was raised by Khutso Mampeule and investigated under his authority and no action was taken in this regard and no charges were successful, to our knowledge.

&quot;We can only conclude that this information has been leaked to further the agenda of the post office and Mampeule. We find it incredulous [sic] that after almost a year of heightened media attention this matter should only be raised now .

&quot;Your constant reliance on the scope and purpose of Mr Mampeule's agenda in the matter of Maanda Manyatshe is treading a fine line between journalism and persecution.&quot;

2.5 Moonlighting Mpofu

Adriaan Basson and Lloyd Gedye, Mail &amp; Guardian, 27 July 2007

Official South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) regulations prevent employees from pursuing private business interests without the prior written permission of group CEO Dali Mpofu. Yet the Mail &amp; Guardian has established that Mpofu is himself a director of no fewer than nine private companies outside the public broadcaster.

Mpofu this week admitted that his business interests are not restricted to the SABC, but told the M&amp;G he had declared this to the SABC &quot;shortly after commencing employment&quot;.

The M&amp;G sent follow-up questions to him on Wednesday, asking for more details of his declaration, but these had not been answered by Thursday afternoon. According to his personal assistant, Mpofu was in Port Elizabeth.

In addition to being on the boards of the SABC and two subsidiaries, the SABC Foundation and Air Time TV Outside Broadcasts, the records of the registrar of companies show Mpofu is a director of Deutsche Securities, Deutsche Securities (SA), Deutsche Holdings (SA), African Crest Resources, Melisitshaba Mining, Uthajiri Investments Holdings, Uthajiri Financial Services, Uthajiri ICT Investments and Uthajiri Advisory Services. He is also the chairperson of Boxing South Africa.

Mpofu told the M&amp;G that African Crest Resources was owned by &quot;other persons ... with no shareholding, and in which I am no longer a director, having resigned some time ago&quot;.

The registrar's records, updated on July 15 this year, however, still reflect his status as &quot;active&quot;. His co-directors in African Crest Resources are Zolile Magugu, Lancelord Luthuli and Pumla Luhabe-Magugu.

In a prospectus of mining company Eland Platinum, Mpofu is listed as a director of African Crest Resources, which indirectly holds shares in Eland Platinum. African Crest Resources holds its shares through Crest Platinum Mining, which owns 12,37% of Cream Magenta, a shareholder in Eland.

The other eight companies, Mpofu said, &quot;are legal entities in one single complex structure which makes up the widely publicised BEE transaction with Deutsche Bank in which I led the BEE consortium called Uthajiri&quot;.

Melisitshaba Mining, of which Mpofu and SABC legal head Mafika Sihlali are the only two active directors, owns 25,5% of Uthajiri Investments Holdings, the holding company of the Uthajiri group.

Utajiri means &quot;wealth&quot; in Swahili and was established in 2004 by Mpofu, Modise Motloba, Ajay Lulu, Xoliswa Kakana and Sihlali.

In its prospectus it lists four areas of investment it plans to penetrate: strategic investments (investment banking, asset management and insurance), advisory services (BEE advisory), procurement investments (travel, security, cleaning and administration) and strategic investments (ICT, telecommunications, niche mobile telecoms and financial sector IT solutions).

Its only major deal thus far has been the Deutsche Bank BEE transaction of early 2005 that saw it acquire a 15% stake in Deutsche Bank's South African ­operations.

At the time Mpofu, was still employed as executive director of technologies company Altron and was also chairing the Information, Communication and Technology Charter working group. He started at the SABC on August 1 2005.
Through the deal, which was labelled &quot;groundbreaking&quot;, Utajiri would have gained access to Deutsche Bank's global network and benefited from &quot;bringing new business to the bank, deploying top managers and working on joint ventures&quot;.

At the time, the ANC praised the transaction as a &quot;decision [that] shows appreciation of the need for transformation in the financial sector and confidence that local players can add value to the business&quot;.

Former chief country officer of Deutsche Bank SA, Martin Kingston, put the deal together. Kingston is well known for his role in assembling empowerment deals and is himself politically well connected.

He is married to Pulane Kingston, the daughter of Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and ANC treasurer general Mendi Msimang. His first wife was Tembi Tambo, daughter of Oliver and Adelaide Tambo.

At one time Mpofu was also a director of the now defunct Onetel, along with SABC board chairperson Eddie Funde and SABC3 head Pearl Mashabela.

However, their involvement with Onetel predated their association with the SABC as individuals.

Onetel was one of the applicants bidding for the second network operator's 19% black economic empowerment stake, which was ultimately awarded to Nexus Connexion.

Mpofu is also involved in the Elephant Consortium, which secured a 6,7% stake of Telkom. He was a shareholder in the Buffalo grouping, which merged with the Lion camp to form Elephant.

Elephant also includes Sihlali, who formed part of the Lion camp and at the time of the BEE deal was a director of legal firm Sihlali Molefe ­Incorporated.

Sihlali, with Dimension Data chairperson Andile Ngcaba, Lester Peteni, Bongani Caga and television presenter Dali Tambo, held a 70% shareholding in the Lion consortium.

When the deal was first mooted in late 2004 it was pointed out that Mpofu was the chairperson of Aberdare Fibre Optic Cables, a major supplier to the second national operator. He resigned from this position at the end of 2005.

After being appointed the SABC's CEO Mpofu told the Weekend Post that he was balancing his responsibilities at Altron and Utajiri &quot;with difficulty&quot;.

This week, he did not respond to an M&amp;G question about how much time he currently spends on outside work.

2.6 SABC pays R120m to show PSL soccer

Jonty Mark, The Star, 27 July 2007

The SABC has finally acquired the rights to televise 143 live Premier Soccer League matches next season.

A deal between the SABC, SuperSport and the PSL was reached yesterday, and negotiations over the radio rights have also begun.

&quot;I am very pleased that the matter surrounding the broadcasting rights of the PSL matches has been resolved,&quot; said PSL chairperson Irvin Khoza.

&quot;It has always been the contention of the PSL that the public should not be deprived of watching their favourite teams on television,&quot; he said.

Added SuperSport CEO Imtiaz Patel: &quot;SuperSport has now ensured that the public has even greater access to top-class broadcasting of soccer matches.&quot;

The new television deal is believed to be costing the SABC around R120-million a year over five years.

The SABC has exclusive rights to 110 games, with 33 games to be shown concurrently with SuperSport.

&quot;These 33 games include some of the knockout competition finals and/or semifinals,&quot; it said.

The games are believed to include the Soweto derbies between Kaizer Chiefs and Orlando Pirates and other high-profile games. SuperSport has exclusive rights to all remaining PSL games.

The SABC's commitment to showing 143 games represents a marked increase from the amount of games it televised last season.

Just how it will fit all these games into its packed programming schedule remains to be seen. It is believed the SABC plans to show three games a weekend - two on a Saturday and one on a Sunday.

&quot;We would not have taken the deal if we were not going to show all the games.

&quot;You will just have to wait for the schedule to come out,&quot; SABC spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago said.

However, sources close to the SABC suggest that it would be close to impossible for it to fulfil such a fixture schedule.

SABC1 did show three games per weekend at times last season, using a Saturday night slot to add to the regular slots on Saturday and Sunday afternoons.

However, Saturday night is usually SABC1's revenue-pulling movie night.

It is unlikely that SABC1 is going to pull its movie slot every weekend for the next eight months just to accommodate SABC Sport.

The loser in all the wheeling and dealing is e.tv. All it has been left with is the Telkom Charity Cup.

3.1 Swaziland strikes bite hard on final day

Sowetan, 27 July 2007

Skeleton staff operated banks and the important sugar refining industry all but ground to a halt yesterday as Swazi workers stepped up action on the second and final day of a general strike to press for multiparty elections.

The Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions organised the stoppages to pressure Africa's last absolute monarch, King Mswati III, to allow multiparty national elections in October 2008.

Swaziland has been ruled by royal decree since the declaration of a state of emergency in 1973. Mswati has faced criticism for his lavish spending and love of luxury cars in the impoverished country, which is ravaged by one of the world's highest HIV-Aids rates.

Security was tight in the main towns yesterday, with the government trying to prevent teachers from taking industrial action. Authorities said civil servants who went on strike would forfeit their pay. - Sapa-AP

3.2 Protest brings Swaziland to a standstill

Lunga Masuku, Sowetan, 26 July 2007

Swaziland ground to a halt today as thousands of workers staged the country's biggest demonstration for over a decade in a push for multi-party democracy in Africa's last absolute monarchy.

As riot police and plain-clothed officers kept a close eye on a mass march in the capital Mbabane, union leaders warned such shows of strength would be repeated if King Mswati III and his government did not meet their demands.

&quot;It is about time that the people of Swaziland realise that they made a big mistake by making the king an absolute monarch,&quot; Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions secretary-general Jan Sithole told the marchers in downtown Mbabane.

&quot;If the situation does not change such protests will become the order of the day,&quot; he added as traffic was brought to standstill.

Sithole said the traditional tinkhundla system of government - under which the king retains full executive, legislative and judicial powers - was dragging the country into poverty.

&quot;Seventy percent of the people of the country live below poverty line, while only 10 percent of the ruling elite enjoy the wealth,&quot; he added to a roar of approval from striking workers.

Unionists want a ban on political parties contesting next year's general election to be overturned, saying that only a multi-party system will bring genuine democracy to the former British colony.

&quot;It was political parties that brought independence to Swaziland and it will be political parties that will liberate the country from the system that now exists,&quot; said Sithole.

He said the protesters did not seek the overthrow of the king, who is husband to 13 wives, but merely to trim his powers.

&quot;Even now political parties and unions want a king that will reign, not rule.&quot;

The protest in Mbabane comes a day after a similar demonstration in the centre of the second city of Manzini.

Schools and government factories were once again closed while while hospitals and banks were operating skeleton services.

Yesterday's march in Manzini was marred by reports of looting and many shops had closed their shutters in Mbabane in anticipation of fresh violence.

The marchers stoned a furniture shop but there were no other reports of violence.

Government spokesman Percy Simelane insisted the protests had had little impact and said they were &quot;nothing&quot; compared to the last major protests by democracy activists in 1996.

&quot;Our offices and shops are operating normally. However the industrial sector has been slightly affected but this does not scare the government at all,&quot; said Simelane, who had earlier urged unions &quot;to put the economic needs of the country at heart&quot; before striking.

Landlocked Swaziland is one of the poorest countries in Africa, a situation compounded by the Aids pandemic.

It has the highest rate of HIV in the world - with more than 40 percent of adults infected, and 70 percent of the 1.1 million citizens live on less than one dollar a day.

It is also currently facing a major drought, with the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warning earlier this week that more than 400,000 people face starvation as a result of poor maize harvests.

3.3 Violence mars Swaziland strike

Mail &amp; Guardian, 27 July 2007

A strike of thousands of public sector workers that brought Swaziland's second city to a standstill was marred by violence on Wednesday.

Police spokesperson Vusi Masuku said protests degenerated late on Wednesday when at least two shops were looted and one person was detained for violent acts.

Many stores shut down as demonstrators marched through the city.

Schools and government factories were also closed, while hospitals and banks were forced to run skeleton services during the strike, called by the country's main trade union body to denounce the current system of government which ensures that absolute power resides in the hands of King Mswati III.

Civil servants demand the introduction of multi-party democracy.

The protestors carried banners and chanted songs that warned: &quot;We are tired of being oppressed, we want better living.&quot;

Gugu Malindzis, deputy head of the Swaziland Federation of Labour, said that the government had to listen to the concerns of the population.

Accurate picture
&quot;We want to force the government to pay attention to our demands,&quot; he said. &quot;People are not getting an accurate picture, about the situation of the workers and how we are being governed.&quot;

&quot;There are no lessons in school anywhere today as most teachers are here,&quot; said Stones Ginindza, general secretary of the Swaziland National Association of Teachers.

&quot;Even though we have got exams [due to be held in early August], we are facing a time of crisis and so no teacher is going to sit down and think about preparing the students unless the government honours our demands.

&quot;If they do not respond to our call, I'm afraid this is going to continue.&quot;

A two-day stoppage by public sector workers was to have begun in the capital Mbabane but organisers were forced to have a last-minute rethink after failing to get authorisation from the security services.

Instead they made Manzini, where they had planned to strike on Thursday, the centre of their protests and hundreds of unionists made the 30-minute journey by bus from the capital in a show of solidarity.

Unions and rights groups are hoping that their show of strength will lead to a dismantling of the traditional tinkhundla system of government under which King Mswati III retains full executive, legislative and judicial powers.

Despite the introduction of a new constitution in February 2006, political parties are still not allowed to contest general elections scheduled for next year and are demanding a genuine system of democracy.

Landlocked Swaziland is one of the poorest countries in Africa and has the highest rate of HIV/Aids in the world -- with more than 40% of adults infected.

Seventy percent of the 1,1-million citizens live on less than one United States dollar a day. - Sapa-AFP

3.4 Zimbabwean editor shot in Jo'burg

The Times, 26 July 2007

ZimOnline editor Abel Mutsakani is fighting for his life in a Johannesburg hospital after he was shot outside his home, the news agency reports.

Mutsakani's wife Bianca said three assailants pounced at around 9pm as he was parking his car at their house west of Johannesburg on Monday night.

Without saying a word, one of them pulled a gun and fired a shot at Mutsakani.

The bullet went through his raised elbow and ricocheted into his chest. It ruptured his lung and remains lodged near his heart.

The attackers fled without stealing anything.

Mutsakani's deputy Abel Chapatarongo said: &quot;He is in a serious but stable condition. Doctors are still assessing whether they could perform surgery to remove the bullet.&quot;

Mutsakani was the managing editor of The Daily News in Zimbabwe at the time of its banning in September 2003.

He moved to Johannesburg in 2004 where he and other Zimbabwean journalists established ZimOnline, an independent news service on Zimbabwe.

3.5 WTO promotes EPZs, ignores workers' rights

ITUC, 27 July 2007

EPZs further promoted by the WTO: Violations of workers' rights ignored

This week a WTO General Council meeting is set to endorse a draft decision by the WTO Committee on Subsidies to extend the transition period for the phasing out of export subsidies in a number of developing countries. The decision will make it easier for a range of governments to maintain virtually free licence to exploit their workers and repress trade union rights in Export Processing Zones (EPZs).

Under WTO rules, these subsidies were supposed to be phased out by the end of this year, but a group of developing countries asked for a waiver to extend the transition and phase out period till the end of 2015. One of the main uses of such export subsidies is to attract foreign investors to set up production in EPZs, where many of the workers are subjected to harsh conditions with little respect for health and safety requirements, long working hours including forced overtime and an extremely high pace of production. EPZs are notorious for the suppression of trade union rights and forced overtime work.

Typically, governments either exempt such zones from labour legislation or do not take action against the breaches in labour law, especially when it comes to working hours and trade union rights.

Among the countries that would benefit from the WTO decision are Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador and Guatemala - all well known for allowing violations of trade union rights in EPZs and for their governments' weak response to such violations.

The decision in the WTO's Committee on Subsidies was based on the argument that these developing countries need the policy space to maintain these programmes as they are alleged to be important components of their development strategies. However, if attraction of investment is based on subsidising export production by multinational companies, forgoing tax receipts and the repression of human rights it is hard to see what advantages it brings for development in the countries concerned.

&quot;The EPZs and other special export zones in the countries that would benefit from an extension represent over one million EPZ workers and over US$50 billion of exports annually&quot;, said ITUC General Secretary Guy Ryder. &quot;It is time to get serious about respect for trade union rights in EPZs. Besides the fact that these are fundamental human rights of workers, in reality they do not undermine the competitiveness of companies, as was shown in the joint ILO-WTO report on trade and employment. Governments must take their responsibilities and promote and protect trade union rights in EPZs, just as they must everywhere in their territory.&quot;

Comment

4.1 Dazzled by the dialectics of history

Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, Business Day, 27 July 2007

THE amazing thing about the meetings of the African National Congress (ANC) and South African Communist Party (SACP) that took place in the past month is the persistence of a political rhetoric that flourished during the reign of Lenin, Stalin and the early years of Soviet rule. It is a history that is totally inaccessible to the vast majority of South Africans, who only wish to hear in simple and clear terms how delivery of jobs, houses, education, health and security is going to be provided.

Let me illustrate, with tongue in cheek, what a good old-fashioned Bolshevik analysis of our predicament is, according to the SACP and President Thabo Mbeki. We are told we are waiting for a revolution. How is it going to come about?

Judging from the tensions that simmered under the surface at the ANC and SACP conferences, it appears as if the members of the trinity that is entrusted by history to deliver SA from the evils of capitalism and imperialism are becoming increasingly confused and perplexed about how to go about their respective missions.

Mbeki had the tedious task of reminding the ANC gathering how the &quot;laws of history&quot; had given special responsibilities to the different agencies that made up &quot;the liberation trinity&quot; - the ANC, SACP, and Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu ).

The task of conducting the &quot;national democratic revolution&quot; (so far never clearly articulated) was the province of the ANC. The &quot;socialist revolution&quot; (also so far not clearly articulated), to inaugurate the workers' paradise, was the province of the SACP.

The task of fighting (how?) for workers' rights and benefits was that of Cosatu. This, as Mbeki said, was the &quot;ABC of our movement&quot;.

To old-style Bolsheviks and the &quot;vanguard of the proletariat&quot;, this was old hat. (I am sure every voter in Khutsong knows exactly what I am talking about).

The &quot;two-stage revolution&quot; the trinity had imbibed with their mother's milk, and they know that in the fullness of time it will inevitably all come about.

What worries two of the partners of the trinity - the SACP and Cosatu - is whether Mbeki is still equally aware of it. Is he still sticking to the plot of history as revealed in Bolshevik scripture and conducting the national democratic revolution as the holy writ of revolution commands?

After all, the two-stage theory of revolution requires that the national democratic revolution &quot;consolidates the gains of the revolution&quot; in such a manner that the way is prepared for the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; to usher in the workers' paradise. Who are the victims of &quot;false consciousness&quot; here? The &quot;ultraleftists and adventurers&quot; (&quot;infantile leftist fanatics&quot; - Lenin), or Mbeki himself and the retinue of empowered black plutocrats sprouting about him?

Once upon a time these disputes could easily be settled. When the &quot;benign leadership&quot; of the Soviet Union was still intact, liberationists could confidentially rely on the vision, contained in Marxist/Leninism, to clear the air.

Bolshevism preached that in a world in which capitalism had entered the imperialistic phase of its development, the capitalist system became international.

Thus exploitation became international. Internal class war took a back seat to interstate war. The decisive battles, important as they are, were not the ones between classes, but between the exploited and exploiting nations on the planet, between the &quot;socialist states&quot; under Soviet leadership and the imperialist states in &quot;the west&quot;.

In such a world there was a clearly designated place for the agency of the ANC in conducting a national democratic revolution.

In countries such as SA, where the proletariat is still rather &quot;lumpen&quot; and much of the peasantry languishing in the &quot;idiocy of rural life&quot; (Marx), the proletarian agencies of revolution are ill equipped for the historical task of emancipating the &quot;wretched of the earth&quot; (Fanon) from the strictures of imperialism.

Under such conditions a revolutionary agency could appropriate far and wide and could be entrusted to any &quot;progressive political entrepreneur&quot; that could be drawn from the ranks of the downtrodden - peasants, traditional chieftains, workers with or without &quot;class consciousness&quot;, gangs, &quot;bergies&quot;, Dakar Afrikaner liberals, progressive Afrikaner poets, etc.

This is all very well when the world socialist system is intact, and can assume the functions of the international proletarian vanguard to prevent the liberation movement from lapsing into wicked ways.

But, the keeper of the keys to the earthly paradise is no more! The Soviet host to the catechism of revolution is no more! The &quot;Comintern&quot;, that could comfort and assist its faltering brothers in the developing world, is no more! Pope Putin has deconsecrated the Kremlin and all the other holy shrines of the proletariat, and is presiding over an emerging thug-tocracy that harbours urgent and enthusiastic players in the global theatres of casino capitalism. What is to be done?

What is to be done, indeed! As far as the economy goes, probably most of what the Mbeki administration is doing - running it with a fair mix of social equity and market principles.

Mbeki rightly thinks he is doing a good job with the economy. So do the captains of industry in SA; also the international banking fraternity, the multinational companies, the World Bank and other lending institutions such as the IMF, and certainly the black plutocrats emerging under the benign terms of BBBEE.

But this is precisely where the SACP feels that Mbeki is betraying the national democratic revolution.

Any &quot;revolutionary&quot; worth his salt in Latin America - Fidel Castro or Hugo Chavez, for example - will tell Mbeki that deploying these policies will lay the groundwork for a deep and lasting restoration of the forces of international capitalism to the very heart of the South African economy.

So why does Mbeki tease the SACP? &quot;Go ahead with your socialist revolution inside, or outside, the ANC! We in the ANC are responsible for a national democratic revolution: we can achieve it with or without the SACP,&quot; he told the communists.

For conventional Marxist-Leninists, conducting a national democratic revolution while at the same time increasing one's technology dependency, capital dependency, and market dependency on the suppliers from the largest capitalist economies of the world is a bit like mixing cow dung with ice cream: it does not do much for the cow dung, but it definitely spoils the ice cream.

But does our president know something that the SACP and Cosatu overlook?

Is Mbeki perhaps a Menshevik? The Mensheviks claimed to have a better grasp of the dialectics of history than Lenin and the Bolsheviks. They claimed that before a &quot;backward country&quot; could proceed towards the stage where &quot;real&quot; socialism became feasible, the groundwork for this great leap had first to be laid by a phase of capitalist development; by precisely the class enemies of the proletariat, the bourgeoisie.

The SACP is immature and impatient. Wait for capitalism to mature and a national democratic revolution to take place before the &quot;real socialist revolution&quot; can happen.

That is why, even unbeknown to themselves, the likes of Tokyo Sexwale, Mzi Khumalo and Patrice Motsepe are commandeered by history to become rich and bourgeois , to become the organisers and reproducers of capitalist relations of production, so that the conditions that provoke a &quot;real socialist revolution&quot; can be advanced. (Imagine, under conditions mature enough for a &quot;real socialist revolution&quot;, capitalists such as Sexwale, Khumalo, Motsepe, et al being led to the scaffold by Jeremy Cronin and Blade Nzimande singing the Internationale.)

If Mbeki is not a Menshevik and not an old-fashioned Marxist-Leninist, then what do he and the ANC high command mean by the words &quot;national democratic revolution&quot;? Why do they dismiss the SACP for persisting with its idea of a socialist revolution? Do they dismiss the possibility of such a revolution in any case, or have they a special meaning for it? If so, what is it?

But, finally, who understands what they are talking about? The homeless, unemployed, unskilled, the destitute? Is it not possible, 17 years after the collapse of organised communism, to dispense with this tired old rhetoric and formulate practical policies that ordinary folk can understand and be mobilised to make real in their daily lives?

Is this not more exciting and challenging than trying to revive a corpse that died almost two decades ago?

Dr Van Zyl Slabbert is a political consultant and businessman. This article is the result of a vigorous discussion between its author and an old friend and colleague from Stellenbosch, J I K Gagiano.
