The use of ISS is also for cancer-, AIDS-, astronomy research (to name
a few things). Also the ISS can be a starting point for future lunar-
and Mars missions (a manned mission to Mars wil take at least a year,
now the researchers can find out if a human can survive that long
without gravity)
On orbit the researchers can do a lot of other things they can not do
here on earth, because of the gravity. In microgravity the fluids and
other materials behave differently than here on the ground (with
approx. 1G of gravity), for example: water and oil don't mix here on
earth, because oil is heavier than water, on orbit they can mix.

As others have pointed out, it all really depends on how you calculate the
costs.

If you count just incidental costs, one can argue between about $150-200
million.  That's the cost of add/removing a single flight in a year
approximately.

If you include total costs allocated to the program for a year, it's between
$500-1,000 million.  With fewer flights right now, we're looking at the
upper end of that.

If you allocate all costs since the start of the program, it's even higher.

As for 'is it worth it?'

Really depends on how you define "worth it".

It's silly to argue that money cut from NASA's manned spaceflight budget
ought to go to someone else's pet government program.  Government programs
have to justify themselves on their own merits, and, under the current
system, their spending in key Congressional districts.

NASA's new lunar program, including Ares I and Orion, preserve key shuttle
spending in key Congressional districts and with key government contractors.
If you think the shuttle program was a waste, wait till you look at the
details behind Ares/Orion.

While what you say is partially true, all of these things could be better

Note that most of them are nominally contractor employees, not

Yes, eventually much useful work will be done in space.  Most of it will

order to provide a working and livable long term scientific platform
for humans in space, and now in 2007 with the planned missions for the
node 2, Columbus and Kibo modules the amount of science produced from
the iss will drastically increase, but please see the link below for a

Shuttle, yes, it was doomed by high operating costs. ISS, however, is
another story. It was vastly overbudget due to launch delays and
repeated redesigns, most of which are now in the past. There is
nothing fundamental about ISS which makes it useless for future space
activities, at least not in the same way that Shuttle's high costs

Wow, just because the first winged reusable space craft has not lived
up to your expectations for low cost access to space, does not mean the
program was "doomed" as you put it.  But then on another thread you
post how the shuttle could complete station construction by 2010 (good
job by the way), which if your correct the shuttle program would be
providing a pretty good yield of productivity in the systems latter
years, in spite of the faults you have pointed out.  Now, it seems you
want to subjectively complain about the shuttle costs but then you
gladly take for granted the work the shuttle program has done in space
station construction, scientific research, and technological
developments that the private sector has or will benefit from.   In
other words your above post disregards the merits of the shuttle
program, and I don't think that all governmental programs should be
judged on costs alone without understanding the programs benefits, as
listing the accomplishments demonstrates the productivity of the U.S.
tax payer dollars invested in any one program.

It seems to me the best use of ISS is to use it for what it was designed to
be, which is a space laboratory in LEO.  Unfortunately, the CAM module isn't
likely to be launched, so there goes the best way to do research on various
"gravity" fields on living organisms.  You could have used it to simulate
lunar gravity, Mars gravity, and etc.

ISS's exceedingly high costs are in large part due to its dependence

Shuttle.

Because the Western side of the ISS was designed to be launched on
Shuttle and there is not really any good way around it. Get rid of
Shuttle as soon as that job is done, if you ask me (no one did.)

No, it doesn't. Shuttle is an excellent work platform in space, but
was the experience worth the hundreds of billions of dollars we've
invested in it all these years? Probably not. Shuttle ended up being
about the worst way to build a Space Station that we could have come
up with. That's not to say that ISS is a lost cause, it actually is a
world-class facility, but we sure did just about everything the wrong
way to get here (or within spitting distance, anyway).

Hundreds of people got to New York and went on to live normal and
productive lives after the Titanic sank under them. That doesn't mean
the Titanic was a successful transport system.

Well, none of that involves manned spaceflight, now does it?  So it

&gt;&gt;&gt; for each shuttle mission?

&gt;&gt; As others have pointed out, it all really depends on how you calculate
&gt;&gt; the costs.

&gt;&gt; If you count just incidental costs, one can argue between about $150-200
&gt;&gt; million.  That's the cost of add/removing a single flight in a year
&gt;&gt; approximately.

&gt;&gt; If you include total costs allocated to the program for a year, it's
&gt;&gt; between $500-1,000 million.  With fewer flights right now, we're looking
&gt;&gt; at the upper end of that.

&gt;&gt; If you allocate all costs since the start of the program, it's even
&gt;&gt; higher.

&gt;&gt; As for 'is it worth it?'

&gt;&gt; Really depends on how you define &quot;worth it&quot;.

&gt; So, the total cost over the last 40 years must be 10's of billions and
&gt; what have we got for that.  A flying semi built tin can and a flag on the
&gt; moon! Well worth the expense.

While I tend to agree with the above statement, most of the "benefit" to

that benefits humankind is largely out of NASA's control.  Examples include

Prepared Comments by Michael Griffin before the Space Transportation
Association
NASA and Commercial Space: Public Trust and Private Interest
11 January 2007
Good morning. I'll bet you all are just chomping at the bit, waiting to
hear the details about how we at NASA are going to cope with a
full-year continuing resolution for FY07, and how that will relate to
the formulation of the President's Budget for FY08.
Well, me too.
We must first be clear on what we mean by "efficiency". Government
agencies do not generate profits, and should not, since we should never
compete with private industry. When technology reaches a point that an
activity can become profitable, as communication satellites did or as
many functions once performed exclusively by the U.S. Postal Service
have, the activity should be performed by private industry. The
government should develop and provide services and capabilities for the
common good, where the market cannot. For NASA this means that we
explore space, conduct scientific research, and develop technologies
that improve our ability to utilize air and space. Our measure of
efficiency is to accomplish a given technological objective within
given cost or schedule constraints. In the 1960's we were asked to send
humans to the moon and return them safely to Earth within that decade.
The NASA of that era accomplished that goal in a manner that I believe
was very efficient. Today we are asked to complete the very complex
assembly of the space station by 2010, return humans to the Moon not
later than 2020, and then to send humans to Mars and beyond. We are
asked to conduct scientific investigations and to meet engineering
goals that will improve our understanding of the Earth and space and
enhance our national competitiveness. We are asked to do all of this on
a go-as-you-pay budget. So efficiency in today's NASA lies in what we
can accomplish within the budgets we are provided. To do this, we must
understand our mission priorities, focus on life cycle costs, sponsor
partnerships with the commercial sector, and pursue partnerships with
the international community. In this way we will maximize the value of
every dollar spent to meet our objectives. ...
So, while efficiency is an important metric for success, it is not the
only measure that is applied to government programs. Of course, NASA
can be more businesslike in its operations. However, I firmly believe
that space exploration, scientific discovery, and aeronautics research
requires a multi-generational approach to sustain it. NASA was founded
as a public institution, must carry out its programs while operating
under the oversight of our stakeholders in the White House and
Congress, and must assure the long term success of its mission. In
contrast, contractors and businesses come and go; they succeed or fail
depending on how well they react to their markets. Hence, the need for
government ownership of the intellectual property that sustains our
missions will be with us as long as there is a government....
Yes, surely we can do better, and we are trying. Help us with that, by
bringing us your ideas. But remember also that the frustrating
constraints on government development programs are the result of
conflicting public policy considerations that, quite deliberately,
yield emphasis on numerous societal values to which we are more
strongly attached than we are to that of pure market efficiency."

A few hundred years ago, scientists were messing around with electricity
and light.  Today we use this stuff every day.  Some of today's research
will yield stuff we can use in the future.

No, it's a platitudinous, pseudo-religious screed that would do Captain
Kirk proud, but it doesn't answer the pragmatic question. Also, it's a
morally and ethically void attitude. The Tuskegee Experiment 'increased
knowledge', but few would argue today that the knowledge gained
justified the means or was worth the price paid.

Well then answer my question.  Are you curious about how the universe
works?  How does it appear to you?

How much does it cost?   About 1% of the Federal Budget on a yearly
basis.  I would agree that the pursuit of knowledge in itself would not
be enough to get Congress to appropriate the money.  Other motives
include a work program for PhD slide rule jockeys, and also the Defense
Dept takes an interest, as they can use the technology to blow up things
that at a great distance, so that is as pragmatic as it gets.

No, it is a statement of fact. Go to the NASA web site and review the
science done on the ISS on a daily basis. Do some research on some
independent sites too. You will find a plethora of scientific data
coming every day.
Motion sickness, which plagues millions of people, is now well
understood and treated thanks to science gleaned from many shuttle
flights and ISS experiments. This is just one of many examples.
Concerning the Universe, the HST has been used for data on the origin
of the Universe, origin of the Earth, many other discoveries.
I don't need to do the research for you. You will gain much more
insight doing the research yourself.

Thank you for a concrete example.

Although if this is the first thing that comes to mind, I'm not
impressed. I am curious, however, to hear exactly what insights on this
particular issue were possible in LEO that could not have been arrived
at down here.

&gt; Concerning the Universe, the HST has been used for data on the origin
&gt; of the Universe, origin of the Earth, many other discoveries.

HST has been cool beyond words. Can't argue that, although ground-based
capabilities in some areas are now equal to HST, for a lot less $$$.
I've been searching for the citation that adaptive optics are a direct
result of NASA and/or the space program, but so far it eludes me.

&gt; I don't need to do the research for you.

Nope. And I don't need to give any credence to unsupported assertions.

Absolutely. How it appears to me is that there are myriad ways and means
of learning about the universe, all of which incur some cost, but some
of which cost a great deal more than others. The question is whether
what is learned TODAY is worth the cost TODAY.

Speaking of unsupported assertions, which ground based telescopes
match the HST. The fact that the citations elude you should give you a
hint.
Concerning the motion sickness part. It is virtually impossible to
rotate a person through multiple planes of 360 degrees in one G here
on the surface, and the zero G trainer (vomit comet) doesn't provide
enough time to get sufficient data. Thus the ISS and STS platforms
provide an excellent testing platform.
Other science: crystal growth experiments in micro gravity made
possible the advancement of computer circuitry which continues to pave
the way to faster, more efficient data handling.
The list goes on. Please understand, I don't have the data at my
fingertips. I continue to urge you to visit the JPL and other sites
and investigate the science experiments going on the ISS on a daily
basis. I'm sure you will be impressed. Have a great day!!

It tells me that NASA hasn't played any significant part in the
development of adaptive optics.
