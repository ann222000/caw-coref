&quot;Last month contractors, immune from the rule of law, butchered 17 Iraqi
civilians in cold blood. Congress mildly objected — and contractors
butchered two more innocent civilian Iraqi ladies on
Tuesday&lt; http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL0913139920071009 &gt;—
in cold blood. Today the New York Times reports that the State
Department
is not cooperating with Iraqi or FBI investigators into the matter of the
Blackwater massacre of seventeen Iraqi civilians. Pay attention to this.
Readers who know `the blueprint' will be horrified but not surprised. `Step
Two' in the closing down of an open society is for the State to showcase to
civilians the fact that a paramilitary force is outside the rule of law.
When SA began — still illegally — beating citizens in Germany, National
Socialist strategists made sure that photographers and reporters were
present. We must consider: if the State showcases to Americans the fact that
it is protecting its own cadre of violent criminals in Iraq — will Congress
be courageous in confronting Blackwater violence when Blackwater manifests
its well-documented plans to deploy more aggressively here at home? Or will
this penumbra of unaccountable, State-defended violence be enough to
intimidate lawmakers — and the rest of us? Remember that Mussolini directed
Blackshirts to intimidate Parlimentarians even before Italy was a
dictatorship and Hitler used the same tactic in lining the halls of the
still-functioning German Parliament with Brownshirts — paramilitary forces
that had established a reputation for brutality against civilians. And that
was enough to cow lawmakers even as the trappings of democracy were still
intact. Remember that under current arrangements, the Department of Homeland
Security can deploy Blackwater in your town tomorrow.&quot;
COMMENT: That last about Blackwater is all too true.  The last revision of
the Patriot Act provides that Bush43 can react to any emergency anywhere by
declaring a national security emergency in the U.S. and override local
authorities by taking direct control of local jurisdictions.  Since
Blackwater is not military per se, it is not restricted, as the U.S.
military is, by Federal Posse Comitatus law and can be deployed anywhere in
the U.S. by DHS.

Sieg Heil, Mein Fuerher Bush43!

I wish people would stop breaking into tears when they talk to me these
days.

I am traveling across the country at the moment — Colorado to California —
speaking to groups of Americans from all walks of life about the assault on
liberty and the ten steps now underway in America to a violently closed
society.

The good news is that Americans are already awake: I thought there would be
resistance to or disbelief at this message of gathering darkness — but I am
finding crowds of people who don't need me to tell them to worry; they are
already scared, already alert to the danger and entirely prepared to hear
what the big picture might look like. To my great relief, Americans are
smart and brave and they are unflinching in their readiness to hear the
worst and take action. And they love their country.

But I can't stand the stories I am hearing. I can't stand to open my email
these days. And wherever I go, it seems, at least once a day, someone very
strong starts to cry while they are speaking.

In Boulder, two days ago, a rosy-cheeked thirtysomething mother of two small
children, in soft yoga velours, started to tear up when she said to me: `I
want to take action but I am so scared. I look at my kids and I am scared.
How do you deal with fear? Is it safer for them if I act or stay quiet? I
don't want to get on a list.' In DC, before that, a beefy, handsome civil
servant, a government department head — probably a Republican — confides in
a lowered voice that he is scared to sign the new ID requirement for all
government employees, that exposes all his most personal information to the
State — but he is scared not to sign it: `If I don't, I lose my job, my
house. It's like the German National ID card,' he said quietly. This morning
in Denver I talked for almost an hour to a brave, much-decorated high-level
military leader who is not only on the watch list for his criticism of the
administration — his family is now on the list. He has undertaken many
dangerous combat missions in his service to his country over the course of
his career, but his voice cracks when he talks about the possibility that he
is exposing his children to harassment.

Jim Spencer, a former columnist for the Denver Post who has been critical of
the Bush administration, told me today that I could use his name: he is on
the watch list. An attorney contacts me to say that she told her colleagues
at the Justice Department not to torture a detainee; she says she then faced
a criminal investigation, a professional referral, saw her emails deleted —
and now she is on the watch list. I was told last night that a leader of
Code Pink, the anti-war women's action group, was refused entry to
Canada&lt; http://politicsnpoetry.wordpress.com/2007/10/04/code-pink-cofounder-r... &gt;.
I hear from a tech guy who works for the airlines — again, probably a
Republican — that once you are on the list you never get off. Someone else
says that his friend opened his luggage to find a letter from the TSA saying
that they did not appreciate his reading material. Before I go into the
security lines, I find myself editing my possessions. In New York's
LaGuardia, I reluctantly found myself putting a hardcover copy of Tara
McKelvey's excellent Monstering, an expose of CIA interrogation practices,
in a garbage can before I get in the security line; it is based on
classified information. This morning at my hotel, before going to the
airport, I threw away a very nice black T-shirt that said `We Will Not be
Silenced' — with an Arabic translation — that someone had given me, along
with a copy of poems written by detainees at Guantanamo.

In my America we are not scared to get in line at the airport. In my
America, we will not be silenced.

More times than I can count, courageous and confident men and women who are
telling me about speaking up, but who are risking what they see as the
possible loss of job, home or the ability to pay for grown kids' schooling,
start to choke up. Yesterday a woman in one gathering started to cry simply
while talking about the degradation of her beloved country.

And always the questions: what do we do?

It is clear from this inundation of personal stories of abuse and
retribution against ordinary Americans that a network of criminal behavior
and intention is catching up more and more mainstream citizens in its grasp.
It is clear that this is not democracy as usual — or even the corruption of
democracy as usual. It is clear that we will need more drastic action than
emails to Congress.

The people I am hearing from are conservatives and independents as well as
progressives. The cardinal rule of a closing or closed society is that your
alignment with the regime offers no protection; in a true police state no
one is safe.

I read the news in a state of something like walking shock: seven
soldiers wrote
an op-ed &lt; http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/opinion/19jayamaha.html &gt;critical
of the war — in the New York Times; two
are dead&lt; http://cujo359.blogspot.com/2007/09/two-war-as-we-saw-it-authors-kill... &gt;,
one shot in the head. A female soldier who was about to become a
whistleblower, possibly about abuses involving taxpayers' money; shot in the
head. Pat Tillman, who was contemplating coming forward in a critique of the
war; shot in the
head&lt; http://www.liberalavenger.com/2007/07/27/new-documents-reveal-pat-til... &gt;.
Donald Vance, a contractor himself, who blew the whistle on irregularities
involving arms sales in Iraq — taken
hostage&lt; http://echidneofthesnakes.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_archive.html#116641... &gt;FROM
the US Embassy BY US soldiers and kept without recourse to a lawyer in
a US held-prison, abused and terrified for weeks — and scared to talk once
he got home. Another whistleblower in Iraq, as reported in Vanity Fair: held
in a trailer all night by armed contractors before being ejected from the
country.

Last month contractors, immune from the rule of law, butchered 17 Iraqi
civilians in cold blood. Congress mildly objected — and contractors
butchered two more innocent civilian Iraqi ladies on
Tuesday&lt; http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL0913139920071009 &gt;—
in cold blood.

Today the New York Times reports that the State Department is not
cooperating with Iraqi or FBI investigators into the matter of the
Blackwater massacre of seventeen Iraqi civilians.

Pay attention to this. Readers who know `the blueprint' will be horrified
but not surprised. `Step Two' in the closing down of an open society is for
the State to showcase to civilians the fact that a paramilitary force is
outside the rule of law. When SA began — still illegally — beating citizens
in Germany, National Socialist strategists made sure that photographers and
reporters were present. We must consider: if the State showcases to
Americans the fact that it is protecting its own cadre of violent criminals
in Iraq — will Congress be courageous in confronting Blackwater violence
when Blackwater manifests its well-documented plans to deploy more
aggressively here at home? Or will this penumbra of unaccountable,
State-defended violence be enough to intimidate lawmakers — and the rest of
us? Remember that Mussolini directed Blackshirts to intimidate
Parlimentarians even before Italy was a dictatorship and Hitler used the
same tactic in lining the halls of the still-functioning German Parliament
with Brownshirts — paramilitary forces that had established a reputation for
brutality against civilians. And that was enough to cow lawmakers even as
the trappings of democracy were still intact.

Remember that under current arrangements, the Department of Homeland
Security can deploy Blackwater in your town tomorrow.

With this kind of messaging about the State's protection for what is its own
paramility force of torturers and murderers, if Blackwater massacres
seventeen civilians in Times Square — or turns their guns on protesters at
an antiwar rally — in spite of the trappings of democracy, will anyone be
brave enough to hold them accountable?'

It is clear yet that violent retribution, torture or maybe worse, seems to
go right up this chain of command? Is it clear yet that these people are
capable of anything? Is it obvious yet that criminals are at the helm of the
nation and need to be not only ousted but held accountable for their crimes?

Is it treason yet?

This is an open invitation to honorable patriots on the Right and in the
center to join this movement to restore the rule of law and confront this
horror: this is not conservatism, it is a series of crimes against the
nation and against the very essence of America. Join us, we need you. This
movement must transcend partisan lines. The power of individual conscience
is profound when people start to wake up. TK Comey said No; history will
look at this torture and disgrace the torturers. A judge today ruled that
the US can't just ship prisoners out of Guantanamo to be tortured at will —
she said No. The Center for Constitutional Rights is about to file a civil
lawsuit — against Blackwater: they are saying No.

In Germany, according to historian Richard Evans, in
1931-1932&lt;javascript:void(0)&gt;,
if enough Germans of conscience had begun to say No — history would have had
an entirely different outcome. If we go any further down this road the tears
will be those of conservatives as well as progressives. They will be
American tears.

The time for weeping has to stop; the time for confronting must begin.
