Hello again RA members,
First of all we’d like to thank everyone for all the helpful comments we’ve
received on previous posts. This time we’re looking for butter churn
experts. This one was purchased at an auction here in western Washington.
The nine inch high rectangular, clear glass jar is embossed with the
following marks: a circular logo saying “Dazey Churn &amp; Mfg. Co. St. Louis,
USA” in block letters. Above that are the numbers 40. The glass looks
rather old having numerous air bubbles. Unlike the Dazey churns I’ve seen
lately , the lid and wood handled churn mechanism are not marked except for
a “40” molded into the frame, a corresponding “40G” on the large gear and a
“40H” on the handle casting. Another curious detail is that someone at one
time punched an irregular hole into the lid. There is no other vent as
found on other churns and the frame work is shaped differently than other
Dazy churns I’ve seen. Also there are 4 paddles rather than the 3 usually
seen and - this makes me wonder if it might be a “marriage”- the lid does
not screw down onto the jar quite right. The threads line up OK, but if one
attempts to screw it down tight, the handle lines up with a corner on the
jar. Could that be because it was designed to have room for a gasket? This
is our first Dazey and we don’t know much more about them than what we could
learn from eBay listings. Obviously that was just enough to raise all these
questions. Could it be that this is a rare early prototype or model made
before they realized it needed a vent? Most listings that are for the
models with the circular logo claim they are older. Is that true? Perhaps
one of you would know of a helpful website or reference. Here are the links
to the images at our ISP. Thanks in advance for any assistance and Happy
Holidays.

Schroeder's lists the Daisy 40 at $140USD.
We had the same one last year in an estate sale and I put $68.00 on it
and all the dealers passed it by. It finally sold for $48.00 later in
the afternoon.
The lid had a rubber ring in it but I don't know if this was what it had
originally. I would suggest trying one and see if the handle lines up
properly.

&gt;While certainly not an expert, I think your guess is correct. It most likely is a marriage.

"/> As far as I know Dazey marked all of their tops.
I don't have a clue about the hole punched in the top, but people will rig
anything to suit their need at the time.
Most have a pat. date or pat. applied for and were made in the 20's thru the
40's. I think there are some repro's out there, but yours look old. I just
have not seen the ones with the side embossed lettering. All the ones I have
seen are marked on the bottom.
Best of luck.
