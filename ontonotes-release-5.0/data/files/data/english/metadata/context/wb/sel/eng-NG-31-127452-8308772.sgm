G'day,

I'm interested in what people think about the risks of travelling to the
southern province of Songkhla later this year.
I would like to visit Hat Yai and cross the border to Sungai Patani in
Malaysia where I worked around ten years ago.
At this stage I'm probably looking at spending around a week in the Songkhla
area and also maybe a few of the islands on the west coast.

Australian government warning &quot;strongly advises not to travel to this area
at this time&quot;.  I realise there is probably some risk of harm from terriost
activity but is it really any greater risk than for instance road accidents.
How many western tourists have actually been killed or injured in Songkhla?
I'm not talking about going to Pattani, Yala or Narathiwat.

Interested to know what you guys think.

Thanks and Regards,
Herbie.

Herbie,

I am living there since 17 years have wife and kids and do know plenty
of other foreigners that live here happily! Even some other people of
this list have traveled in the past months to Songkhla. What is your
problem?

Send me a private mail and I'll contact you by phone/mail or whatever
as long as it helps!

Cheers
Chabby

I would have no problem either to go to the &quot;restive south&quot;.
But I think the fact is that there occured some bombings in recent years
and that travelling down south is still a bit risky. Sungai never was a
friedly place, so maybe crossing the border into Malaysia this way is
not first class.
Isn't it?

Khun Saparot:
Sungai Petani is a short distance off Penang (60 km perhaps) - no
problem there as it is Malaysia! You probably did mean the other one:
Pattani, where the travel is not advised - anyway if you are brave
enough, Wat Changhai is calling and still worth a visit.

Problem is Australian government warning that I should not travel there.  I
also hear a lot of media reports that it is very dangerous there.
This is why I ask on this forum as to  risks I may face if I decide to
travel there.  That is why I asked &quot;How many western tourists have actually
been killed or injured in Songkhla?

Herbie, the warning is there, that if something should happen - they
(the Government) has warned you. Please note there is still a sizable
Farang community in Songkhla - most in the Oil and Gas business and
the providers to them.
Biggest problem is if you love Songkhla, and it is very very charming,
you will not leave, even when there were some bombings in Hatyai (last
September) and 3 locals and 1 Canadian (Teacher in a Hatyai School)
got killed.

Now if you calculate that there are about 250,000 people living
Hatyai, crossing a road is still more dangerous, unless you are of
course one of the victims. Anyway I still believe that if you take a
cautious approach, one still can even travel to Pattani and Yala.
I was a couple of weeks ago at Hat Narathat (Narathiwat Beach), the
beach is still one of the best in the South, but unfortunately
absolutely deserted. Same in Wat Changhai, 10 years ago during
weekends thousands of visitors - todays, 2-3 buses daily and army
protection, that sometimes outnumber the visitors. A real pity but we
hope that the Government rather sooner then later get them radicals,
they are a bloody minority and slowly the rest of the Thai-Malay
population is helping the Government. Now if we perhaps give the
normal majority a bit more acceptance - the radicals could completely
lose out, our live in the South could then go on to normal again.

I think the Aust Govt travel warnings tend to be overly cautious.  Just
before we travelled to Europe a few weeks ago, we checked the DFAT site and
were amazed to find a warning for travel to France because of the elections.
I know the French are a volatile lot (I have French blood so can get away
with that!) but this asked us to exercise more caution than in England and
just after we got to London there were the attempted car bombs!

It sounds like you know the area but use your judgement and common sense
when there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Herbie,
&gt;&gt;&gt; I am living there since 17 years have wife and kids and do know plenty
&gt;&gt;&gt; of other foreigners that live here happily! Even some other people of
&gt;&gt;&gt; this list have traveled in the past months to Songkhla. What is your
&gt;&gt;&gt; problem?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Send me a private mail and I'll contact you by phone/mail or whatever
&gt;&gt;&gt; as long as it helps!
&gt;&gt; I would have no problem either to go to the &quot;restive south&quot;.
&gt;&gt; But I think the fact is that there occured some bombings in recent years
&gt;&gt; and that travelling down south is still a bit risky. Sungai never was a
&gt;&gt; friedly place, so maybe crossing the border into Malaysia this way is
&gt;&gt; not first class.
&gt;&gt; Isn't it?

&gt;&gt; peace

&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers
&gt;&gt;&gt; Chabby

&gt; Khun Saparot:
&gt; Sungai Petani is a short distance off Penang (60 km perhaps) - no
&gt; problem there as it is Malaysia! You probably did mean the other one:
&gt; Pattani, where the travel is not advised - anyway if you are brave
&gt; enough, Wat Changhai is calling and still worth a visit.

No Western tourists killed there. However Hat Yai has had a large
number of bomb attacks recently. And it's increasing. Most countries
have warnings about travel there. We have a significant operation
there and I travel from time to time. Never had a problem. But it
isn't someplace you'd want to go just for fun. Risk is too high right
now.

According to Thai Law he had no permanent residence in Thailand -

And may I add, that whatever he was, or your &quot;very literate article&quot;

193 Persons killed and 1,056 wounded in five months.

Not quite a place to recommend as &quot;touristic&quot;, he Chabby

***************************************

193 killed in five months in Thailand's restive south
07:19, August 06, 2007

A total of 193 persons were killed and 1,056 wounded by militants in
Thailand's five southern provinces between January and May this year, Public
Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla said Sunday.

Mongkol was quoted by Thai News Agency as saying that the number of
casualties was obtained from 47 hospitals under the supervision of the
ministry in the five provinces of Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat, Songkhla and
Satun.

Narathiwat recorded the most causalities, with 76 people killed and 393
wounded, followed by Yala with 46 deaths and 330 injuries.

The Minister said the Ministry had spent more than 3.7 million baht (112,121
U.S dollars) in treating the wounded and boosting the morale of families who
had lost their loved ones during the period.

The ongoing violence in Thailand's deep south resurfaced in January 2004
when militants raided an army camp and emptied its arsenal. The situation
has worsened in recent months, with killings occurring on an almost daily
basis.

Sandy is living in Thailand just like you, masters Thai and maybe other Thai
languages just as you (AFAIK you speak also Isaan, Malay and other languages
fluently) and knows how to behave with the local people. The later is
something that is hardly found under Western tourists.

Compare it with an American going on holiday to Iraq ...

I have many Islam friends. most of them from the rime I used to live in my
homeland, and none of them would ever think of killing or hurting me or my
family. On the other hand, people like Deckard or Takin Gthepiss are more
terrorists as their Islamic counterparts. Go figure.

That's the same beleive as many people in Spain had about the ETA and thanks
to their conviction have keot Spain to be one of the post popular touristic

I had a great  time in the South Chabby, several visits now, and I
wouldn't hesitate to do it again, I didn't go as far as Narathiwaat,
but I did stay in Haad Yai and visited Sadao and Satuun.  I can

True Khun Pluto, and Australia's control over it's citizens in
Melbourne was increased this week by new and stiff penalties for
jaywalking, possibly because sites to install revenue raising traffic
cameras are now saturated. Meanwhile this sort of thing is a common
occurrence in rich but unhappy Oz.

&gt; A total of 193 persons were killed and 1,056 wounded by militants in

A quote from http://www.grsproadsafety.org/?pageid=28 says;
&quot;According to official statistics (police), 12,858 people were killed in
road crashes in 2005. However the real number might even be higher.
According to documentation from the health sector, the real death toll could
be 20,000 or more if victims who die after being removed from the crash
scene are included.&quot;

From those figures it looks like it could be 50 times as dangerous to get in
a car in Thailand than to visit the south, and I've travelled by road from
Bkk to Nong Khai and Bkk to Chiang Mai many times (scary).

Around ten years ago I used to work in northern Malaysia and would travel
across the border to Southern Thailand which is when I fell in love with the
place.  Since then I have travelled all over Thailand, learnt to speak a
fair bit of Thai and can now, after a lot of perseverance (and with the help
of the Thai school here in Sydney), even read and write some Thai.

I really want to retrace my footsteps through the area. I'm not thinking
about going to Yala or Patani.  Maybe fly to Hat Yai stay a night, get a cab
down to Malaysia and catch up with some old friends.  Then on the way back
check out a few coastal places like Satun or Songkhla, just for a day or two
(any suggestions Sandy, Chabby).  Then make my way back up through Trang,
Krabi, Phang Na, Ranong and Bangkok.

I feel the threat of terrorism world wide has made a lot of us be afraid of
things that statistically we probably shouldn't be (I think our governments
play on these fears too).  Doesn't that help the terrorists win, and maybe I
get the advantage of lower prices and &quot;the place to myself&quot; while all the
other tourists are too scared to go.

Interested to hear your comments,

Herbie.

Tchiowa, are you grown up enough to see what an idiotic thing you try

Sidestepping the question: is a dead &quot;temporary Western resident less
dead then a Western Tourist and if, what is the difference in their
death?
Why you cannot admot for once that it did elude you, that a Canadian
was killed in Hatyai?
It is you that always tries to bring those half trues and half lies in
this NG, and once caught, you change the tune and ask something
completely else?
Is that mature what you do old bean, when you refer to &quot;green apples&quot;?

You have again demonstrated, what it is to do THE &quot;TCHIOWA thing&quot;,

Herbie, your idea to take the flight down to Hatyai (or the train) is
a sound one, from Hatyai to Dan Nok border there are no &quot;pockets of
terrorists&quot;, and then, all the way down to Sungai Petani, off to meet
your friends!
Depends what you feel for Penang, stay a day or two in Penang, then up
to the North again, crossing and then going to Trang. From there of
course the route Krabi, Phang Nga, Ranong, and finally Chumphon is
very very beautiful, IMO, one of the most scenic in the South.
Being able to communicate does help enormously, and I am sure that you
will have for sure a great time.
If you are in for a beer or two, give me a tinkle and I'll meet you in
Hatyai!

Cheers

I agree.  It's one of those heads I win, tails you lose situations for the
govt.  However some of the warnings sometimes seem a little over the top and
renewing them regularly would be a good idea!

&gt;&gt; It sounds like you know the area but use your judgement and common sense

&gt; IMO Governments have to be overly cautious Viviane, if they didn't

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last September - there was a Canadian teacher killed in the Hatyai
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bombings that did cost 5 lives.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just for the records.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just for the record: canada &quot;belongs&quot; to whoever wants it and can afford

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the teacher killed in hat yai was not, however, a tourist... so no
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; western tourists were killed in that bombing... just for the record of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the literate few...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; michael

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to Thai Law he had no permanent residence in Thailand -
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; besides he WAS a Westerner.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And may I add, that whatever he was, or your &quot;very literate article&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to imply - he was killed for no reason.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His family or his colleagues in Hatyai probably aren't very much
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in your thesis of the &quot;literate few&quot;...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe you can explain us the difference of a dead Western Tourist and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a Western teacher? Is a dead teacher less then a Western Tourist?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I specifically said &quot;Tourist&quot;. I'm a Westerner and I have temporary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; residency, not permanent. But I'm not a Tourist. Do you really not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand the difference?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe the OP was planning on coming as a tourist so I addressed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question to that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You're making again a bloody arsehole out of yerself Tchiowa - a dead
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Westerner is a dead Westerner - whether working as teacher with or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without Permit and with or without temporary residence! Dead is dead,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isn't it you idiot?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And a green apple is a green apple. But that had nothing to do with my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; post, did it?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you insist on trying to pick a fight when there is no need?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Tchiowa, I think a dead Westerner is a dead Westerner - whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; resident or tourist or whatever, you bloody idiot.
&gt; &gt; &gt; What has that to do with &quot;green apples&quot;?
&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what you do best - trying to right your wrongs eh? Mind you
&gt; &gt; &gt; Titchy: two wrongs don't make a right....

&gt; &gt; Again, picking a fight when there is no need. I see the whole maturity
&gt; &gt; thing still escapes you.

&gt; Tchiowa, are you grown up enough to see what an idiotic thing you try
&gt; again to do?
&gt; Sidestepping the question: is a dead &quot;temporary Western resident less
&gt; dead then a Western Tourist and if, what is the difference in their
&gt; death?
">

I didn't sidestep it. I told you flat out it was irrelevant. A
potential tourist asked a question about safety and I told him that no
Western tourists have killed. That's a 100% true statement and applied
directly to his question.

You read half the statement and reacted. You were 100% wrong. And now
you get juvenile and insulting to try to cover it.

It didn't elude me. The teacher was not a tourist. I quite

Half truths??? Like you trying to claim the teach was a tourist? You
tried to do that. You said that because he didn't have *permanent*
residency that means he was a tourist. That, of course, is silly
nonsense.

Yes. Tell the truth. Something that also seems to evade you.

I'd like to thank you for this post. You proved everything I have
pointed out about your lack of maturity in a manner far, far better

I think you are the one who is wrong Chabon. You see, the Canadian who
was killed was working in the area of education, an area which is
being targeted by Muslim extremists. It is no small wonder that the
westerner was killed since he put himself in harms way. Government
workers such as administrators and educators are consistently being
targeted. Thus far tourists are not. That may change in the futre but
for the moment it is the case. Since the person killed was &quot;working&quot;
in Thailand, he was not a tourist. Maybe he had a tourist visa and was
working illegally? Do you know if this was the case? I suspect you do
not. If he was working illegally on a tourist visa, you might have a
point. Still, he was working and, for that matter, working in an area
that is being targeted. By any definition he ceased to be a tourist
when he commenced working. Instead, he became a temporary resident.
Tourists are not allowed to work. You are clutching at straws Chabon
and everyone reading your posts can see that. All you seek to do is
score points over Tchiowa. Most of the time you do not and by losing
your cool, hereby do prove exactly that!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; besides he WAS a Westerner.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And may I add, that whatever he was, or your &quot;very literate article&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to imply - he was killed for no reason.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; His family or his colleagues in Hatyai probably aren't very much

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a Western teacher? Is a dead teacher less then a Western Tourist?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I specifically said &quot;Tourist&quot;. I'm a Westerner and I have temporary
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; residency, not permanent. But I'm not a Tourist. Do you really not
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand the difference?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I believe the OP was planning on coming as a tourist so I addressed
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question to that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You're making again a bloody arsehole out of yerself Tchiowa - a dead
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Westerner is a dead Westerner - whether working as teacher with or
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without Permit and with or without temporary residence! Dead is dead,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; isn't it you idiot?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And a green apple is a green apple. But that had nothing to do with my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; post, did it?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why do you insist on trying to pick a fight when there is no need?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Tchiowa, I think a dead Westerner is a dead Westerner - whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resident or tourist or whatever, you bloody idiot.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What has that to do with &quot;green apples&quot;?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what you do best - trying to right your wrongs eh? Mind you
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Titchy: two wrongs don't make a right....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Again, picking a fight when there is no need. I see the whole maturity
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing still escapes you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tchiowa, are you grown up enough to see what an idiotic thing you try
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again to do?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sidestepping the question: is a dead &quot;temporary Western resident less
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dead then a Western Tourist and if, what is the difference in their
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; death?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn't sidestep it. I told you flat out it was irrelevant. A
&gt; &gt; &gt; potential tourist asked a question about safety and I told him that no
&gt; &gt; &gt; Western tourists have killed. That's a 100% true statement and applied
&gt; &gt; &gt; directly to his question.

&gt; &gt; &gt; You read half the statement and reacted. You were 100% wrong. And now
&gt; &gt; &gt; you get juvenile and insulting to try to cover it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why you cannot admot for once that it did elude you, that a Canadian
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was killed in Hatyai?

&gt; &gt; &gt; It didn't elude me. The teacher was not a tourist. I quite
&gt; &gt; &gt; *specifically* said &quot;tourist&quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is you that always tries to bring those half trues and half lies in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this NG, and once caught, you change the tune and ask something
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; completely else?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Half truths??? Like you trying to claim the teach was a tourist? You
&gt; &gt; &gt; tried to do that. You said that because he didn't have *permanent*
&gt; &gt; &gt; residency that means he was a tourist. That, of course, is silly
&gt; &gt; &gt; nonsense.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is that mature what you do old bean, when you refer to &quot;green apples&quot;?

&gt; &gt; &gt; One more piece of English you just don't understand.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have again demonstrated, what it is to do THE &quot;TCHIOWA thing&quot;,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Tell the truth. Something that also seems to evade you.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to thank you for this post. You proved everything I have
&gt; &gt; &gt; pointed out about your lack of maturity in a manner far, far better
&gt; &gt; &gt; than I ever could have.

&gt; &gt; Err - are you sure? You just showed to everybody what a sneaky little
&gt; &gt; coward you are - no need to try to make it unhappen!
&gt; &gt; You and truth? That's the biggest BS I ever did hear in my life, old
&gt; &gt; chap - you're the biggest &quot;half true&quot; and &quot;half lie&quot; story teller in
&gt; &gt; this NG!

&gt; I think you are the one who is wrong Chabon. You see, the Canadian who
&gt; was killed was working in the area of education, an area which is
&gt; being targeted by Muslim extremists. It is no small wonder that the
&gt; westerner was killed since he put himself in harms way. Government
&gt; workers such as administrators and educators are consistently being
&gt; targeted. Thus far tourists are not. That may change in the futre but
&gt; for the moment it is the case. Since the person killed was &quot;working&quot;
&gt; in Thailand, he was not a tourist. Maybe he had a tourist visa and was
&gt; working illegally? Do you know if this was the case? I suspect you do
&gt; not. If he was working illegally on a tourist visa, you might have a
&gt; point. Still, he was working and, for that matter, working in an area
&gt; that is being targeted. By any definition he ceased to be a tourist
&gt; when he commenced working. Instead, he became a temporary resident.
&gt; Tourists are not allowed to work. You are clutching at straws Chabon
&gt; and everyone reading your posts can see that. All you seek to do is
&gt; score points over Tchiowa. Most of the time you do not and by losing
&gt; your cool, hereby do prove exactly that!

&gt; Changyai

Dear Large Elephant,
The point was: western dead - wasn't it? Maybe you recall, a Westerner
asked that question. Do you think the killed Canadians family gives a
flying fart whether he was working with - without - or with a Tourist
Visa? He is dead for all it counts.

Anyway - your claim that they are bombing Government workers is
unfortunately a very valid one.

However if you place two motorcycles with explosives in front of some
entertainment places (as happened in this mentioned case) that would
not indicate that they were deliberately targeting Government Workers,
much more that they went after Tourists (Foreign or Malaysian),
especially in places that are doing promotions such as in backpacker
books and also hotels, that do generally more cater to Foreign
Tourists.
The September bombing was thus a deliberate act against TOURISTS in
Hatyai and nothing else (please consult the various articles in BKK
Post and the Nation that are still around).
Now of course, you can tell (like Tchiowa) that a dead Westerner is
less dead when he had a working permit!
Asking myself now, who is clutching straws, large elephant...

Tchiowa weaseled with: there was (until now) no Western Tourist
fatality in Hatyai - Songkhla. However a Western Teacher was killed -
now what is the difference if it just happens that the teacher was
there were tourists usually meet?
By the way, he was asked by a Westerner and offered a half truth or a
half lie - I rest my case here!

Anyway thanks for your comments, that in many points are a sadly truth
here in the South.

No, it is you who have it so wrong.
The Hat Yai bombings in which the Canadian died were targeted NOT toward
educators, but to ANYONE.
Two bombs exploded in front of a pub and parking lot at a shopping mall,
another went off at a nearby massage parlour and the fourth and fifth
exploded in separate department stores..
http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2807/797/1600/180906_new13.gif
I suppose you'd like to tell us that schools are in department stores or
that tourists are not typical visitors to shopping areas, pubs, or massage
parlors?
LOL !!
ANYONE who happened to be near the bombs was the target.
While it's true that many teachers have been targeted, the Canadian's demise
was due to simply being in the wrong place when the bomb went off.

You and Chabby then proceed to throw some kind of school yard tantrum

You remind me of an e-mail joke I got the other day. Clearly you're a
Liberal:

*********************

A woman in a hot air balloon realized she was lost. She lowered her
altitude
and spotted a man in a boat below. She shouted to him, &quot;Excuse me, can
you
help me? I promised a friend I would meet him an hour ago, but I don't
know
where I am.&quot;

The man consulted his portable GPS and replied, &quot;You're in a hot air
balloon,approximately 30 feet above a ground elevation 2346 feet above
sea
level. You are at 31 degrees, 14.97 minutes north latitude and 100
degrees,49.09 minutes west longitude.

She rolled her eyes and said, &quot;You must be a Conservative.&quot;

&quot;I am,&quot; replied the man. &quot;How did you know?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; answered the balloonist, &quot;everything you told me is
technically
correct, but I have no idea what to do with your information, and I'm
still
lost. Frankly, you've not been much help to me.&quot;

The man smiled and responded, &quot;You must be a Liberal.&quot;

&quot;I am,&quot; replied the balloonist. &quot;How did you know?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said the man, &quot;you don't know where you are or where you're
going.
You've risen to where you are, due to a large quantity of hot air. You
made
a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to
solve your
problem. You're in exactly the same position you were in before we
met, but,
somehow, now it's my fault.&quot;

No, he is just as dead. However, by working in the region, he has
increased enormously his level of risk. In recent times we have
cautioned our overseas workers to maintain a very low profile. That
includes avoidance of shopping areas and nightspots, variance in their
work patterns where possible, and other similar tactics. All this to
minimise the possibility of being in the wrong place at the wrong
time. I have often had to conduct pre-departure briefing sessions for
my subordinates and one point I always stressed was the importance of
maintaining a low profile.
Anyway, given that only one westerner was killed, it seems that they
might not have been targeting westerners, at least in this case.
Shopping areas are typically places where locals frequent. Terrorists
are more likely to kill locals in shopping centres. As has been
pointed out, the Canadian happened to be in the wrong place at the
wrong time.

Conversely, what would happen if the westerner was in a place where
locals meet? Don't answer that, we know already. They get caught up in
blasts intended for locals. Most expatriate workers I know tend to
have &quot;meeting places&quot; that aren't in the hubs of tourist activity.
Quite often they are ordinary places, cafes and the like, in shopping
centres and along main streets. The places my subordinates take me
when I am visiting overseas posts in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and
Malaysia are almost always frequented by locals. More often than not,
the only non locals are the group I am with.

Have you also been in the South? It was really a beautiful region with

I was interested in Chabon's posts long time ago because he's living

France had some riots not so long ago.  And during the election
campaign there, socialists were warning people not to vote for the
conservatives, because voting for conservatives may provoke new
riots.  Conservatives were ahead in the polls there.  And they did get
elected.  Although there were no riots.

It doesn't make sense for the Australian government to wait until many
of its citizens are killed, before warning people.  They've waited
like this before the bombing in Bali, Indonesia.  And they've learned
their lesson.

The tourist industry in Thailand benefits Thai economy a lot.  And
perhaps it's only a matter of time before some of the muslim rebels in
the south will take a few western hostages and threaten to behead
them, unless their demands are met.  Taking hostages is a favorite
tactic among many muslim rebel groups.  And they do learn from each
other.

As we (my wife and I) were in Hat Yai for several days in January, with a
brief visit to Songkla town, and to Chalatat beach, and unfortunately had to
spend a few days abed with a flu that came on us not long after arrival, I
can *only* report that along the beach in Songkla, and in town, in the
streets of Hat Yai's center city, on the campus of the university where my
brother-in-law professor and his wife are employed, and in the suburb where
they've lived in a lovely home for many years, the people are indeed
welcoming, and the region is quite beautiful.

I can also confidently report that the many Muslims on campus and on the
streets of Hat Yai, both those we passed and also had some small commerce
with in Hat Yai and Songkla, were no less friendly than other Thai--really.

As for the mentally decrepit French sponsor of 'night life,' perhaps the
vile fool should hazard a visit to Hat Yai before dumping more merde on the
page here?

Thought not.

You sure wrote a hilarious story about your travel experiences in the
North-West of Thailand.

I have read that the Thais are protecting now their territory for pedo's
from Paris like you after having found some traces of your past experiences
with the ladies of the night.

Ca you shed a light on that?

Subject: RE: A tourist at Khorat

No superstitous people in Europe? not a one?
Quite a few, I would say.
Does everyone in Europe hang around in a food court where the cooking
equipment is burning? What a dork!
It is quite obvious that you stayed simply to try and show your &quot;european
superiority&quot; in the face of what a normal person would consider to be an
undesireable situation. Maybe there were a couple of drunk, fat stupid
farang baba booboo still eating lethargically in a buring food court, but I,
for one, would have been a farang eating and drinking elsewhere.
What would be the point of staying? To try to make up for your inferiority
complex visavis the rest of the non-european world by trying desperately to
give the appearance of superiority in a little burning food court?
That's pretty sad, my european friend. farang baba booboo????
you really ARE a dork!
I think the Thais were simply laughing AT you and your slow-witted inaction.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Comparing it to the Roman walls in Europe, I turned round to make a comment
&gt;to my guide but she was gone. Very surprised, I looked around for her in
&gt;the twilight.
&gt;After several minutes, I saw her coming hastily from the end of the wall.
&gt;To my enquiring eyes, she replied:
&gt;&quot; I don't want to stay all my life at Nakhon Rachasima&quot;
&gt;&quot;Uh?&quot;
&gt;&quot;A legend says that everybody who goes through this gate will stay forever
&gt;at Khorat&quot;
&gt;&quot;But you're a student from the university!&quot;
&gt;&quot;Yes but the university of Khon Kaen not Khorat&quot;
&gt;&quot;I have gone through the gate but I doubt I'll stay more than 3 days here&quot;
&gt;&quot;Of course, you are a Farang so you cannot believe this&quot;
&gt;She gave up trying to convince me.
&gt;Two hours of visit later, we decided to go to a big shopping mall
&gt;called...The Mall.
&gt;In the basement, there is a Japanese restaurant where you can eat sukiyaki.
&gt;This sort of restaurant chain is common in Bangkok with a different brand
&gt;name.
&gt;Despite their taste for spicy food, most of the Thai people that I know
&gt;like Japanese
&gt;food; so do I. The restaurant was almost full and we sat down at a table
&gt;near the windows.
&gt;Then the young waiter switched on the electric hotplate under the water
&gt;pot.
&gt;Five minutes later, a waitress brought us the different ingredients that we
&gt;had chosen on
&gt;the menu. The Thai student put them in the boiling water while she
&gt;translated their names
&gt;into English and French for me.
&gt;My mouth watering in anticipation, I was about to take a piece of Japanese
&gt;food when a
&gt;dull noise came from the end of the room. I would not have payed attention
&gt;to it but half
&gt;of the customers stood up with a big smile on their face. The sort of Thai
&gt;smile that
&gt;means: &quot;fright&quot;. A second noise and everybody stood up, so did I.
&gt;Then I could see the cause of the noise: a hotplate was burning. When a
&gt;flame came from
&gt;the machine, all the staff and several customers went away from the
&gt;restaurant.
&gt;I was waiting for the course of events. It was a fire with electricity and
&gt;water: so the
&gt;safety fuse blew out and the water boiled over the pot, extinguishing the
&gt;fire.
&gt;I sat down to continue my meal but the hiss of the steam had an opposite
&gt;effect on the
&gt;Thai customers. Everybody ran away from the room.
&gt;Sipping my beer, I was waiting for the air conditioner to clean the air.
&gt;The manager came
&gt;to remove the hotplate and the pot. Despite being Thai, he was not smiling.
&gt;I looked
&gt;around me: on my left, there was only one client, a Farang man with white
&gt;hair, eating
&gt;heartily his sukiyaki; on my right outside the restaurant, a dozen of Thai
&gt;people -
&gt;including my student - were peering at us through the windows with a big
&gt;smile on their
&gt;face. The sort of inimitable Thai smile that means: &quot;Farang ba ba booboo&quot;.
&gt;All the light came back quickly and most of the customers decided to finish
&gt;their meal.
&gt;Wisely, I avoided discussing the subject with my guide for the rest of the
&gt;night.
