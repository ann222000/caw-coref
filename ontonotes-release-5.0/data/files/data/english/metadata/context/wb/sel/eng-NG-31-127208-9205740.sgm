Before the season, everyone said that the Eagles would lose a couple games
due to special teams.  This could be the 2nd game they lose due to special
teams.

Bears    13
Eagles    12

Ugly game.  Lots of penalties, missed tackles, collapsed/chaotic pockets and
turnovers for both teams.  I further expect Reid to abandon the running game
as soon as it starts working, and Reid will accept responsibility for the
loss.

I hope I am wrong.

According to Armand, looks like a home game, which should bear well. Pun,
perhaps intended.

Hmm odds?

Cut and pasted from USAToday, prolly can't read it. Eagles win by 5.

Eagles 19 - Bears 17

And I've stopped counting if I am right or wrong. But, in the long run, I
bet it's around 50/50.

You are.  The Bears suck.  They may not score 4 points on the Eagles, let
alone 24.  The crappy Eagles offense should score enough to win this unless
Devin Hester goes nuts on us with special teams.

Eagles 13

The Bears O is just OK at best, so figure them for 10 points baseline
vs. the Iggs' D.

The big question is Hester vs. the Iggs' crappy ST - how many runbacks
before Andy figures out that we should be punting OOB, and kicking off
to a sideline or even OOB if necessary?  My guess is one TD, and
another near-TD, for Hester on runbacks before Andy goes passes &quot;duh&quot;
and makes the obvious adjustments.

A second question is, does Andy run the ball enough to sustain drives
and success or go needlessly pass-wacky again?  (Oh, yeah -
nevermind.)

So depending on how Andy does on his football pop quiz (elementary
shool level), the predicted result varies:

2 of 2 right:
Iggs 24
Bears  10

1 of 2 right/half-right:
Iggs 20
Bears 17

0 of 2 right:
Iggs 13
Bears 20

If I had to pick one, I'd guess the middle scenario, but that may just
be the homer in me bleeding through....

I agree, but Rocca can't punt directionally; touchbacks will suffice.
Here's a novel idea.  How about converting some third downs so they don't
have to punt to Hester.

What's wrong is anybody allowing Brian Griese to throw for 300 yards
and 3 touchdowns.

Better late than never-

Andy Reid is clueless, McNabb is SHOT, Westbrook
is too SMALL to hold up a full season, Reggie Brown
had bad hands, and the Bears are going to TRAMPLE
their swiss cheese defense.

Bears 122
Eagles 7

(7-0 and counting)

Reid isn't that smart.

Isn't this the same coach who drafted Kolb, and gave Anthony Spencer to
the Dallas Cowboys?

Kolb, could have been gotten in the second or third round(s),
especially, the way Quarterbacks were falling in last years' draft.

I think trading away a first round pick is bad unless you get a future first
round pick plus extra picks.  First round picks start on most teams.
