Does anyone know much about lyrica? From what I've been told it was
developed to treat pain associated with diabetics. It treats the same pain
receptors that cause lower back that some of us have or so I've led to
believe. OG do you know anything on this? It's kinda new on the market.

It was just approved for the tx of fibro on June 26 and I started
taking it a few days after that.  I was prescribed Lyrica for my fibro
and also for the compression fracture in my back, as well as the
separation of ligaments and or tendons in my knee.  She started me on
75 mg and I was to add one pill a day until I reached the max of 4 per
day but I was never able to endure the side affects/effects and
stopped at two pills.  The first week, which I took only one, was
horrible, although it certainly minimized my fibro pain, it did not
help my back and knee.  I couldn't drive for about 10 days...that's
how out of it I felt.

The most important thing about it is IMO, the side effects, which are
dizziness, feeling of being stoned (not the good feeling, either),
nervousness and insomnia.  There are a lot more but these are the most
important, for me.  I read lots of blogs and msg. boards about other
peoples experiences, which kept me from stopping after one day.  They
said, stay with it.

I have lots more info but don' t have the time right now, so I will
write more later.  I will also give you some links to good msg. board
sites.

Top, i normally don't tolerate anti-seizure meds well at all.  Tegratol was
my worst nightmare.  Paul asked me to try Lyrica.  He doesn't ask much of
me, and i did so.

I only got to week two when my fentanyl suckers fight began.  I had to drop
the Lyrica while trying to swim thru my fight...however, i was not having
much difficulty with it.  It actually felt like it was trying to address my
pain, too.  And the side effects, especially the IQ depression, wasn't
nearly as bad as Topomax and the others.  I was a little sleepy the first
few days of taking it, then upping it, but that subsided as well.

Due to my sucker fight lasting so long, i've decided to start the Lyrica up
again.  (thought the fight was gonna be short-term....ain't the case) and
will be starting it again sometime next week.

I'm giving it a try again...hopefully i'll get past week 2 this time!  No
more insurance surprises, i hope.

deep peace,
Lavon

I tried it but had problems. It's basically just a little change from
neurontin. Neurontin had lost its patent so they changed it just a
little and now have a new drug and new patent. I have heard that it's
'cleaner' and causes less side effects. NOT the case with me though.

Just to let you know... I was told to wait 5-7 days before increasing my
dose. Sometimes going upwards slower lessens the side effects.

I don't know how reliable this information is, but I tried Lyrica for only
one or two days. After that I developed the worst kind of crippling
arthritis in my hips. I've never experienced this kind of pain before. I
could barely walk to the bathroom and back. It lasted for months. I never
took another Lyrica and I've never had the symptoms recur.
Was it caused by the new medication? We'll never know because I will NEVER
take another of those GD pills.

I'm thinking about trying it. It was offered about the time I started
topomax which I take for tremors. I will have to see my neurologist about
the tremors, my speech is getting bad again (stutering sometimes just
can't speak) and bad muscle twitches. I'm thinking he will take me off the
topomax and if he does I may explore lyrica. It was approved last year for
diabetic related pain. I'm not sure of the termonoly of their pain.

Lots of good info from you guys, I really appreciate all of you.

Dear Lavon,

Hopefully Im not too nosey, but may I ask what you meant by fenatnyl
sucker fights? Im currently using the patch, and was just curious. I

Dear Top,

It's supposed to be the bomb for lots of neuroropathic pain. I didn't have
too much luck with it for the lower back and accompanying sciatica, but it
has worked for a lot of people on a lot of pain that they thought they would
never be rid of. It does help with sleep, way more than the big lie,
neurontin. And without mentioning any names, a little bird told me it can
have a phenomenal effect when people find themselves in &quot;short&quot; medication
situations. So the addition of the drug can only help, I would think, and
the FDA's blessing makes a definite drug to at least try. If you can get
some samples, great, since they're protected for some time to come by the
patent laws, so you won't be seeing a generic anytime soon, but even if you
have to reach in to your wallet, it's got more potential than most of the
garbage they push on you, even more so, possibly than narcotics, which have
only a &quot;so-so&quot; track record with many kinds of neuropathy.
It did not seem to be one of those drugs where you have to wait a month or
two to see if it's going to be effective, you should know in the first
couple mornings if you have a noticeable improvement or not.

Definitely worth the try--og

Dear Dave,

I don't know exactly Lavons situation, but they make a fentanyl lollipop
(same drug as the patch) for BT pain. Docs are brainwashed that only
terminal cancer patients experience the type of pain warranting such relief.
Never tried it but it sounds like its both effective and a little dangerous
as they're flavored like any other lollipop, so extra care is needed with
kids in the house or pets.
They make a new version of the same stuff basically without the stick called
Fentora. Pop it like a piece of hard candy and the medication is delivered
transmucosally through the tissues in your mouth. Real new drug so no
generic for a while. Haven't tried that yet either probably due to the same
cancer pain prejudice.

I hope the doc gives it back, but you fight the insurance after the
doctor--og

I have been taking Lyrica for diabetic neuropathy since shortly after the
FDA approved its use.  It has certainly worked much better than the
Neurontin I was on previously.  I am now taking 225 mg twice daily and the
burning and tingling in my feet, lower legs, and hands is well under
control.  There were some side effects when I first started taking it,
mainly being extremely tired.  This has subsided with time and I have no
side effects now.  Some people find the side effects too hard to handle and
stop taking it.  My experience has been that they subside within 1-2 weeks.
Overall I would say Lyrica has worked great for my condition, I can't speak
for other disorders.

Good luck with whatever choice you make and may your pain be diminished.

Thanks Rick, OG and all of you. If you haven't noticed I'm very happy to

Howdy, dave!!

No problem...nose away!  In Nov of '84, i woke up with double vision.  Long
story later, in April of '85 a big ole hairy brain tumor got popped out at
Stanford.  I was supposed to be dead, and best case, i was to be paralyzed
and mentally diminished.  The only main problem i've had since is head pain.
In '87 i started trying preventatives.  I actively tried different ones,
changing about every three months when they didn't work.  Saw a zillion
different doctors, like everyone here.  Went thru college, got married,
worked and worked, played music at church and directed the choir...stage
managed musicals at the local community theatres when i could.

In April of '95, the pain turned non-stop.  up until that point, it had
increased in frequency, but i had time in-between the pain.  That was the
beginning of the major decline.  In late '97, i had to quit my job...and i
loved my job. i had scaled down everything else first, of course.

Somewhere along the line, after late '97, the head neuro at UCSF started me
on ms contin, which is basically &quot;we've run out of preventatives.&quot;   That
was for baseline.  Later i went exclusively to my primary care doc, who let
chris and i do research to try different meds and therapies.  In late '99,
after emailing with someone for whom it had done wonders, we tried Actiq,
oral fentanyl transmucosal lozenges on a stick.

It transformed my life.

It did take some balancing and working with other meds, but by 2003, i was
doing a lot.  I had been home bound by '97...got disability in 2000.  In
between then i'd lived like a spider.  Actiq got me showering almost daily,
able to go on occasional vacations with my husband, being able to
participate in life, to a qualified degree.  I'd lost 30 pounds and was
exercising for 20 minutes a day.

chris' school district changes insurances frequently.  The suckers are
expensive...the generic (which recently came out) is $1400 for a box of 30.
I use four boxes a month.  Each insurance initially balked, but caved after
some faxing by my doctor's nurse.

In January of '07, the district started with United Healthdoesntcare.  I
came due for a refill on the 17th.  I knew it would be initially declined,
so i had my doctor's nurse start the faxing early.  But that did nothing.
Appeal after appeal has been made, but they will not allow the suckers.

The reason for their denial is that i've been using the suckers off-label.
Cephlon only got Actiq approved for CANCER pain.  They've done so because
they can charge more for it, if it is strictly considered a cancer med.
That one word adds about a thousand bucks to each box of 30. In the
meantime, they've had their reps pushing it to doctors for chronic pain
patients as well, but will not get it labeled for chronic pain....they can't
charge as much if they do.  So, until now, a single appeal has been enough
to get past the off-label thing for insurances.  Not this time.  And i'm not
alone.

We have been fighting, at different levels, since then.  While i am
currently doing much better, i was completely suicidal for a couple of
months.  The spider returned...so did my weight.  It has been very
difficult. My husband had to fly to Florida and take care of his dad for a
minimum of 3 wks starting in late June, so we decided, for the safety of
everyone, that we would buy a box of suckers on our own for while he was
gone.  It proved its worth, especially one night when i could not bounce a
severe bout of pain.  I have about 6 left.

My head pain is 24/7, with different zaps of extra pain whenever it
jolly-well feels like it....usually a couple of times a week.  I get what i
call a full blown case of pain with upchucking at about a level of 9.....i
call those &quot;pukers&quot; and get them about every 3 months.

Paul, my doctor, has been extremely kind and helpful while we continue to
fight the insurance.  He's given me a buffet of replacement meds in the
meantime.  They keep me from jumping off of a cliff, but come extremely
short of the Actiq, which i now refer to as fentanyl suckers.

We did the lawyer thing.  We've done the state insurance commissioner, and
have had to reopen that as the insurance company lied to them.  We are
fighting and will continue to fight.  I'd finally gotten the balance of meds
that gave me a decent level of life back.  And the insurance, a company
whose level of incompetence i've never encountered before, decides my life
is not worth the premiums we pay.  They really are amazing.  chris' union
has stepped up to bat for us.  They called the insurance, and U H told them
we hadn't appealed.  WTF?!?!?!?!  That has been the norm with them....and we
can't tell if it is inefficiency or just plain deceit.

I miss my life.  I miss going to worship on occasion.  I miss being able to
have physical intimacy with my husband. I'm missing the time i was having
with my mother, as she is ill.  That cannot be replaced.

More than ya wanted to know, right dave?  hehe  Like everyone else, there is
much more to this story, but i hope this has answered your question.

deep peace to you, dear one,
Lavon

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Does anyone know much about lyrica? From what I've been told it was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; developed to treat pain associated with diabetics. It treats the same

Dear Lavon,

That was no more or less info than i wanted...it was just fine. Im so
sorry they are making you jump thru hoops when youre least able to.
That is a mighty steeply priced candy for sure. I wonder if you could
get your hands on any documentation the company sends to docs about
using it for chronic pain. It would seem that there would be an agency
interested in their wanting it both ways practice of saying cancer
only out of one side of their mouth and suggest this for chronic pain
out the other. That is a disgusting abuse of their power, and Id love
to see them called on it for your benefit especially. Insurance,
pharmaceutical companies and some doctors do not allow proper
treatment levels. It sounds like you have a very compassionate
professional doc that does his job the way its supposed to be done,
but then you get pinched by the other 2  entites. Its a shame, and I
hope you and your doc can get this taken care of. I guess im just not
surprised by anything anymore. those suckers do sound like the only
kind of bt med that would work for me...like i told my doc, when i
have a pain spike, 40-50 minutes waiting for a pill to work is just
about worthless to me, so the combo of fentanyl patches and methadone
have given me the best coverage ive had, but still i cant get enough
activity going to lose weight, or to just enjoy myself...if i walk
thru walmart instead of taking the cart, i spend 2 days in bed paying
for it. i highly doubt ill get the suckers from my pcp or pain doc,
and im sure id run into the same insurance crap you do...mine will pay
for name brands, but the copay is very high....oxycontin 80s cost me
87.00 in copay per month, so i am sure the copay for those would be
astronomical...anyway i ahve the strongest hopes that you can get this
straightened out and get back to your life....as ive learned this
week, if you dont give up the fight, good things CAN happen.

deep peace to you, and god bless you,
-dave

Lyrica is supposed to interrupt nerve impulses and stop the pain that
is carried along those pathways.

If it works for you, it's a good deal, though it certainly isn't
cheap.

I had some nasty mean side effects from it.  Even for me, the side
effect queen, they were intolerable.

I hope if you try them that they work for you.

&gt; pharmaceutical companies and some doctors do not allow proper
&gt; treatment levels. It sounds like you have a very compassionate
&gt; professional doc that does his job the way its supposed to be done,
&gt; but then you get pinched by the other 2  entites. Its a shame, and I
&gt; hope you and your doc can get this taken care of. I guess im just not
&gt; surprised by anything anymore. those suckers do sound like the only
&gt; kind of bt med that would work for me...like i told my doc, when i
&gt; have a pain spike, 40-50 minutes waiting for a pill to work is just
&gt; about worthless to me, so the combo of fentanyl patches and methadone
&gt; have given me the best coverage ive had, but still i cant get enough
&gt; activity going to lose weight, or to just enjoy myself...if i walk
&gt; thru walmart instead of taking the cart, i spend 2 days in bed paying
&gt; for it. i highly doubt ill get the suckers from my pcp or pain doc,
&gt; and im sure id run into the same insurance crap you do...mine will pay
&gt; for name brands, but the copay is very high....oxycontin 80s cost me
&gt; 87.00 in copay per month, so i am sure the copay for those would be
&gt; astronomical...anyway i ahve the strongest hopes that you can get this
&gt; straightened out and get back to your life....as ive learned this
&gt; week, if you dont give up the fight, good things CAN happen.

&gt; deep peace to you, and god bless you,

Thank you, Dave!  And given your recent fight, i take your &quot;keep at it&quot; with
a renewed waft of purpose.

God

I know what you mean. I have a history of nasty and strange side effects
from many drugs I have tried for several diseases. Lyrica made me
stutter so badly I could barely talk. It started when I took neurontin
and it worsened slowly over time. Then with the Lyrica it was horrible
after only THREE pills!! I told them what would happen but they didn't
believe me and wouldn't implant my stimultor unless I tried the Lyrica
first. IDIOTS!! Anyway, I had other nasty side effects as well. When I
first developed the severe stuttering with the neurontin (I actually
took the generic gabapentin) my friends and co-workers were VERY
concerned thinking I had had a stroke or something. I could really
barely talk. It was HORRIBLE!!!

&gt; If it works for you, it's a good deal, though it certainly isn't
&gt; cheap.

&gt; I had some nasty mean side effects from it.  Even for me, the side
&gt; effect queen, they were intolerable.

&gt; I hope if you try them that they work for you.

I took my first dose of Lyrica at bedtime.  The next morning I got up
and had this sensation of free-falling.  I struggled to the bathroom
and managed to find the toilet and use it.  When I went back to bed
and tried to lie down I felt as if I was falling into a big black deep
bottomless hole.  Hubby had to physically help me back into bed.  The
sensation lasted until the med wore off.  I cut the dose in half and
then I could notice the stupid factor because the dizziness was
somewhat diminished.  I took it for a total of 4 days.  No more.

At first Lyrica was a Godsend, my Fibro pain got less and less. Then I
told my husband I started to feel funny - like I had white noise
invaiding my brain. That lasted a few days. Yesterday I began to
become dangerous to myself. I kept trying to call for help with my TV
remote.  I tried to change the TV with my cell phone. At 12 N I
started to lay out my meds and stopped cold. I found that I started to
do this task 3 times! I had no idea if I actually took any. I secured
my pets and locked myself in my bedroom since I couldn't figure out
how to call for help. As my mind cleared I swore Lyrica would never be
apart of my future. The pain is back and I don't remember it hurting
this bad. But never - NEVER again will I take Lycria

Wow!!!

I had the same sort of thing happen with Neurontin...it was given to
me for headaches.  I lost control of my power of speech-just kind of
garbled-only, I wasn't aware of it, until  had tried talking several
times-and no one understood me.  But, I guess it wasn't as bad for me-
as soon as I realized something was happening, i stopped the drug.

Would you believe-several doctors have suggested that I try again-
starting at 'a lower dose'?  I had only taken one 300mg capsule-and
supposedly, it doesn't really start to help until you're taking at
least 3 times as much-a day.

Lyrica was starting to show some promise-and no side effects-when I
had to stop, because my insurance refused it.  It really is strange-a
drug can work wonders on one person, while with someone else, it can
cause some awful side effects.

I really hope that your doctor gives you something that helps-and
soon!  If it were me, I wouldn't chance Lyrica again.  Like I won't
use Neurontin.

WOW Angel,
My side effects were minimal compared to yours!!  Maybe I should try
it again, as it sounds like you really took a &quot;trip&quot;.lol

Seriously, that is horrible.  Fortunately, you are of sound mind and
realized that you were not thinking properly.  Have you found anything
that works well for your fibro?  After I stopped taking the Lyrica and
toward the end of my third week, I had muscle pains in places that I
had never hurt before.  It was totally weird.  I had what I thought
was a pulled muscle and by the end of week three, it had not gotten
ANY better, so I went to the Dr. and they took some xrays and found a
L1 compression fracture.  I had helped my parents with some moving of
small furniture like chairs and that is all I can figure out that may
have cause it.  It hurts SO,SO bad and have had a lumbar fracture
before so they want to compare xray films.  I don't know if you can re-
fracture, or not.  Anyone?

Thanks for sharing your experience
Susan
