Hello!

I am currently building - since about a year actually as I am low on time -
a 1:200 scale model of the Tirpitz. As the Bismarck has exactly the same
hull, I wanted to make a copy of the hull that I am currently building -
and, as the wooden framework inside the ship eats a lot of space, I was
actually considering making 2 copies of the hull consisting only out of
fiberglass and with no internal wooden skeleton.
But how to I take a copy of a 1.26m glassfiber hull?
Any experiences, suggestions, ideas?
I was currently thinking about taking liquid latex, like sold in sex-shops,
acover the hull with that and then place it inside a papermache-bath. And
when that would have hardened, pull off the latex cover, place it in the
papermache and then put the glassfiber-mats in there, eventually affixing
them with thumbtacks which could later on be grinded away from the hull.

That sounds reasonable?

although im no expert i believe that you should make a mould using
fiberglass so that it does not flex to much. then it will last a long
time and you could make many hull's from it.

you need to seal the origonall hull with paint then several coats of
wax,also make sure there are no overhangs or negative angles which
would prevent the mould coming off. then apply about 2-3 layers of
fiberglass and once set hopefully the mould will come away fairly
easily.

i might have a "how to" on my computer somewhere if you want i will
look for it.

My thread on making a mold from a home made hull form will be on within
the week and the completed mold done within two weeks.

If you value the wooden one you made it might not be a good idea to use
as a plug. All of my plugs suffer some damage, some are total losses but
that is OK because the first thing I do with a new mold is lay up a new
plug in it that can be used to make bunches of additional molds if
needed. Since the new plug is made of gelcoat over fiberglass a new
mold can be made from it with no damage.
