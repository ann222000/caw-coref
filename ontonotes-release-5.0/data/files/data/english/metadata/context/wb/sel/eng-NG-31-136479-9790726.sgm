Good morning!
I don't suppose you want to know it's 19* here, huh? Ok, I won't
mention it. Once it gets below freezing, it's just numbers anyway,
right? ;0)

Poor Poo-kitty. I do hope she/he (Short memory!) turns out to be a fab
lap-cat! Our devil-cat can be such a love at times.

Not much going on here of interest to most, so I won't drone on and
on. I am going to post a picture though, because it's phenomenal (at
least to me, and I'm not a farm-girl!)

I hope you have a super fantastic day... it's no longer Moan-day, so
it has to be good, right?

Blessings to all... Onward and Upward...

After a high of 86 yesterday (sorry, ME), we will be in the low 60's
today but back in the 80's by the weekend.  It will make for a warm
football game.

We also have elections though for most of us in Texas it is Constitutional Amendments only. The amendment gathering the most ink locally is an amendment that would provide for increased funding regarding cancer research. Opposition groups have formed so its more controversial than originally thought.

I had to go to my non-jazzercise workout this morning. About half way through class I realized that I have really been spoiled by the constantly changing music and choreography from Jazzercise.  This instructor rotates the same tapes - it's a good workout but I get so tired of listening to the same music over and over again.

One of the many skeletons in my closet is that I used to do Jackie Sorenson Aerobic Dance in the early 1980's at the same time I started Jazzercise. The programs had comparable choreography but we had six week sessions in Jackie Sorenson. By the end of the session I would always be ready to move on.

I think that management problems contributed to the demise of Jackie's program but I do think that her program suffered by the limited selection of routines.  (It was almost as if we were rehearsing for a show that we never gave)

That's the way G*ld's Gym runs its classes.  I get SO BORED when
someone keeps songs in for multiple weeks.

On another note for the Jazzy Twins, their good friend Gaida
deLaurentis is expecting a baby girl in April.  April is a good month
for baby girls!

JAS-it's possible there are bonus points to help you achieve that.
Every class owner will run it differently, though.

Have you seen the actual shirt? We ordered weeks ago and are still
waiting to get them here.

It's my first born son's birthday today. I can't believe he is 32
years old. I must be older than 42 by now. I had no idea. Sometimes,
it's better not to remember your age.

I never took Jackie's classes. Wasn't popular here in the early 80's
or ever for that matter.

I have a kick butt PT class this morning. I hope their butts
appreciate what they are about to experience. tee hee hee

I've got my shirts and really like them.  I'm even keeping one for
myself (which I never do).  They're soft and the neckline fits easily
over the head so you won't mess your hair (if your hair is messable).

It's been frosty here, but nothing like ME.  That's just way too
cold.  No excitement here either.  Just have to order a load of dirt
today...ho-hum and run errands.

Thanks for the info on Giada, Joan.  I hadn't even heard about it.
Seeester and I have been pretty occupied.  Our 1997 Malibu had to go
to the repair shop again, and they wanted waaaaaay too much to repair
it.  So, we took the plunge and have bought a new car.  We ended up
with a 2008 Honda Civic.  They call the color Galaxy Grey.  The past
couple of cars we have had were white, so we really wanted something
different.  So far, the car has been just great.  The Malibu was
getting pretty bad, so we're glad to have something more reliable.

Now each morning we get up, we have to decide whose turn is it to
drive the new car to work.  LOL!!  If we get a chance, we plan on
taking a couple of pictures, so we will post whenEVER we get them
developed.  Some day.... we WILL get a digital camera.  ;-D

Brrr!  19* is VERY cold ME.  We're in the 40s today, but we're
supposed to get a hard freeze tonight.  Temps in the 20s.  I have a
bad habit of not wearing a coat.  We have a late meeting tonight, so I
am GLAD that we both brought coats.  :D

Sending get well vibes to all who need them.  Have a great day!!

xoxoxo

packing.  So much to do.  I just put my washer and dryer on craig's
list.  Such a shame; haven't even used it 50 times....but I don't need
to take it with me.  Lisa P in MD and our gf, Denna, are both flying
in on Friday the 16 and taking off in the truck on the 17!
Need to get a dentist appt. for my cleaning (whilst I know the
dentist) and still need to get my car in for maintenance and oil
change.....hell, if they give me a good deal, I'll trade it in too:-)

Pray the washer and dryer sell!!!

Off to make appts, get lunch and do more packing!!!  The boxes,

working abs &amp; glutes this week w/ the ball and I am thorougly enjoying
it.

Ash, don't you have a college near you? I bet the housing office can
list your washer and dryer for sale.

I am really loving having another adult in the house to deal with the
kids. It has been fantastic.  My associate is teaching lots of classes
and I get to take naps and make dinner.  DH took the kids to school
and picked them up today.

My customers are getting anxious about the winter promo. So many
questions. Seems everyone wants to work the system. Yesterday a gal
asked for a list of phone numbers of people she could call to see if
they want to partner up with her. The list included the names of
people who attend class most frequently.  I didn't give any phone
numbers away, but I thought it was pretty funny. I have been wearing
my t-shirt because it's one of the few Jazzercise shirts that covers
my entire belly at this point.  Sadly, pretty soon it won't!

RE: the promo... FZ said 38 was the goal, last time we checked. But it
was printed elsewhere (can't remember) as 36. We're using the tracking
sheets available online, so 38 will be our goal. I wrapped a box in
gold paper and pretty burgundy &amp; gold ribbons and flowers tied on...
black question marks all over the box... it's been sitting out on the
registration table to build excitement about the game. (Usually we
just put the game cards out and go on the 1st day of the promo.) I
know they're eager to see what the prize will be. Game cards will go
up this week so they can start buddying up and picking team names! I'm
doing a modified game for my Lite class, too. Can't tell whether
they're excited about it or not... they're always more on the quiet
side. Hoping to get 1 more student in the bunch so we don't have an
odd number, either...

I have tomorrow OFF. Can I get a wooohoooo?? Not off from school,
unfortunately, but for the first time in maybe 2 months I will spend
one entire day/evening without teaching/doing any form of Jazzercise.
I think I might even get to take a bubble bath or something! As much
as I love my customers, I'm looking forward to the mini-break. :-)

They're calling for a high of 58 tomorrow and we're f-f-f-freezin down
here! I can't believe how wimpy I've become since moving south. No
rain in the forecast, which is unfortunate... because we're getting
into real trouble. I heard we've got about 60 days of water left and
then we're out. Not good!! And with things so dry, I don't even want
to think what would happen if *we* had fires. We're under a &quot;fire
weather advisory&quot;... had never heard of that till now.

Not to be argumentative here, but the FZ has been corrected to have 36
on all the flyers and trackers. You can, of course, run the promo any
way you wish!  When I talked to Holly at corp, she said to pass the
word that the trackers on line all have 36, and that's the way they
intended it. With that info, do as you please!

Thanks for the clarification, ME... I didn't know it had been changed,
but it makes more sense to me. I'll make sure our &quot;stuff&quot; is fixed
before I display it and pass the word along!

Washer and dryer are sold.  Cute guy is coming to pick them up this
weekend.  LOL, did I say he was cute???  Isn't that the way, you meet
someone when you move.  We sat and chatted for about an hour!  lol

One gal lost 4.5 % body fat tonight. She was our biggest loser. I
think everyone lost except for one lady that is teeny tiny anyways.
Probably 17% body fat at the most. Can't remember for sure. I told her
to work on her calf raises to build up her calves and then the body
fat would come down. She laughed. She is older and could really care
less, but I measured her for the fun of it.

Ash, it's not uncommon to meet someone just before you move. And if he
buys your washer and dryer, you can come and visit and it will just be
like home with your old appliances. ;-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know they're eager to see what the prize will be. Game cards will go
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up this week so they can start buddying up and picking team names! I'm
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing a modified game for my Lite class, too. Can't tell whether
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they're excited about it or not... they're always more on the quiet
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; side. Hoping to get 1 more student in the bunch so we don't have an
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; odd number, either...

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have tomorrow OFF. Can I get a wooohoooo?? Not off from school,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unfortunately, but for the first time in maybe 2 months I will spend
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one entire day/evening without teaching/doing any form of Jazzercise.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think I might even get to take a bubble bath or something! As much
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as I love my customers, I'm looking forward to the mini-break. :-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They're calling for a high of 58 tomorrow and we're f-f-f-freezin down
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here! I can't believe how wimpy I've become since moving south. No
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rain in the forecast, which is unfortunate... because we're getting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into real trouble. I heard we've got about 60 days of water left and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we're out. Not good!! And with things so dry, I don't even want
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to think what would happen if *we* had fires. We're under a &quot;fire
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weather advisory&quot;... had never heard of that till now.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ash, don't you have a college near you? I bet the housing office can
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; list your washer and dryer for sale.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am really loving having another adult in the house to deal with the

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My customers are getting anxious about the winter promo. So many
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions. Seems everyone wants to work the system. Yesterday a gal
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked for a list of phone numbers of people she could call to see if
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they want to partner up with her. The list included the names of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people who attend class most frequently. ?I didn't give any phone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; numbers away, but I thought it was pretty funny. I have been wearing
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my t-shirt because it's one of the few Jazzercise shirts that covers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my entire belly at this point. ?Sadly, pretty soon it won't!- Hide quoted text -

Late end to a long day, and another in store for tomorrow.  Am taking
some time in the early morning for a ride, then the rest of the day
will fall into place.  Debating taking my iPod; usually I prefer to
keep my ears open to the sounds of nature and cars, but I have a new
playlist that I really like.  Hmmm, safety vs. music...we'll see...

Now that I've told the dog-falling-out-the-car-window story I'm
starting to wonder if Beau pushed him out on purpose.  We're actually
laughing about it, since humor helps to diffuse the intensity of the
situation.  Gallows humor to the rescue!

&gt; One gal lost 4.5 % body fat tonight. She was our biggest loser. I
&gt; think everyone lost except for one lady that is teeny tiny anyways.
&gt; Probably 17% body fat at the most. Can't remember for sure. I told her
&gt; to work on her calf raises to build up her calves and then the body
&gt; fat would come down. She laughed. She is older and could really care
&gt; less, but I measured her for the fun of it.

&gt; Ash, it's not uncommon to meet someone just before you move. And if he
&gt; buys your washer and dryer, you can come and visit and it will just be
&gt; like home with your old appliances. ;-)

&gt; &gt; Washer and dryer are sold.  Cute guy is coming to pick them up this

&gt; &gt; someone when you move.  We sat and chatted for about an hour!  lol

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the clarification, ME... I didn't know it had been changed,

&gt; &gt; &gt; before I display it and pass the word along!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not to be argumentative here, but the FZ has been corrected to have 36

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way you wish! ?When I talked to Holly at corp, she said to pass the
