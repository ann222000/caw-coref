Barry, you need to deep-six those glasses - you look freaky in this
photo ...

p.s.  I can't believe he didn't do one 70s song in the show last
night, and that the show was only an hour and 30 minutes.  I hope
nothing went wrong!

(someone posted on Manimail that she was really disappointed that it
was the exact same show he's been doing in Vegas)

I like the shades but agree, those would look better on someone with a
wider face / wider set eyes.

My reply:

Didn't he say in the Philly interview, that the show would be two hours
long.  Was there an intermission half way through or was it one long 90
minute set?  He might have cut it short to gain some pack-up time, since
they have to move everything up to Boston and get set up for tonight.  I'm
really surprised he didn't do any 70's songs.  It doesn't make any sense,
that he wouldn't promote the new album.  I didn't mind the glasses.
Atleast, you can see his eyes.  It seems he is wearing glasses more often
these days, no doubt to draw attention away from his surgerized face.

I generally like Barry in glasses, so was surprised that this new pair
didn't do a thing for me.

I remember looking at the photo and immediately thinking he looked alien.

Not my fav pair but he doesn't look freaky.  Glad to see him relax and not
hide out in the hotel. I thought he had Lasix done but maybe the glasses
are those transition ones that change with the amout of light encountered?
