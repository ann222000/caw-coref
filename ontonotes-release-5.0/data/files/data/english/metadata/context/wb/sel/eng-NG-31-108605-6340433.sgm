It concerns the USS RALEIGH LPD-1. First ever Wikipedia edit I ever made.

The subject material starts after "Need information from 1970 to 1991", and
stops just before the sentence describing the USS RALEIGH's decommissioning.
The material I added would be mine. Please let me know if I should edit it,
and how.

Maybe nobody has noticed it yet, but that ship was my favourite. :-)

It looks fine, Dcest62. You should check out "Naval gunfire support"
and add to the Gulf War I section.

I went on a Wikipedia binge once and edited the history sections of
"Royal Marines", "Netherlands Marines",  "Air Assault", "Small Wars
Manual", "John Colomb", ""Rangers" and "US Marine Corps" until about
1900. Someone else edited out all I wrote in "Rangers", but the rest
is still there. I guess the Rangers don't believe that they started as
a copy of the French Couriers du Bois.

Thanks, Joe. It needs some finetuning, and as a baby Wiki project I will
nurture it like a small plant. :-)

I need to throw in some links, or I could. I believe it's Wiki style not to
have inline links that deliver you to an external website (in fact, I know
it's not). So I don't know how to point at websites on Marine units that are
mentioned, within the body of the text.

I also can pin down some dates better. And provide some context. One reason
USS RALEIGH was so ready, and the Marines were so ready, is that we were all
slated for a northern Europe exercise - 4th MEB at the time was the Marine
contribution to NATO, after all. When Saddam invaded Kuwait, we were pretty
much packing our bags already, so to speak. The powers that be just said,
boys, dress for warmer climes.

The cruise book specifically says:

"15 days after Iraq invaded Kuwait, the USS Raleigh embarked units of 3rd Bn
2nd Marines and 1st Bn 10th Marines. Ready on short notice, they were among
the first amphibious units to deploy for DESERT SHIELD".

The Suez canal transit was September 8th, according to the book.

I am considering whether or not to include a small photo. For copyright
reasons I can't currently include one from the cruise book, which has some
great pics. But I do have quite a few of my own that showcase the old girl.

I'll have to check out the Wiki entry for Rangers. So far, it seems to me,
that most everything you write is well-researched, and it's not like I
haven't also investigated the history of amphibious warfare. :-) I'd be
curious as to what in that entry the other aspiring author did not like. Or
more to the point, what he did not like about what you wrote. Even on the US
Army Ranger Association website ( http://www.ranger.org/history.html ) it's
acknowledged that the Ranger concept does not originate with Roger's
Rangers - they ascribe the US Ranger tradition back to the mid or late
1600's. Considering that, and their function at the time, it's impossible
that they would not have copied what the French were doing.

I have looked at the naval gunfire support page on Wiki. It's not
particularly good - you will probably agree. For starters, there is no
"Modern" era - that would be best broken down a bit. Additionally, if a NGLO
is going to be mentioned, it wouldn't hurt to say that the Marine artillery
battalion supplies virtually all of the SFCP and liaison team, with Marine
people. In real world cases nobody on the green side may be USN at all.

I'd also seriously rework the paragraph that is much more opinion than
fact - namely, the editorial about battleships. I myself might even agree
with the tone of that, but I'd have to recognize that I am biased, and it is
not fact - it's opinion.

As to the continued NGFS training section of the Wiki, I propose calling
that just NGFS training, as a top level heading, and then having eras and/or
countries under that. What's in there right now I could totally demolish,
honestly - it's none of it that well-written, and some of it is biased. Hope
you didn't write some of that. :-) Because I am going to rework it.

I've never written anything in the NGFS entry. I would recomend
reading "Naval Gunfire Support of Amphibious Operations: Past, Present
and Future" a 1977 study with concentration on Normandy, Iwo Jima and
Korea. It's a 54 MB download from the archives at the Marine Corps
University.
They also have downloadable copies of all the old NGFS FMs as well as
results of all the Gunnery Exercises of the 1920s and 1930s.
Another good source would be the relevant "Operations Research Group
Sudies" from WWII (16,17,29,30,47,48,251,252). These are either joint
US or combined US/British studies.
Some questions/musings I've had on NGFS in history:
I read an account of two attempts by the Portuguese to take a Moorish
fort, one unsuccessfully without NGFS and one successfully with. I
wonder if the timing of the first use of NGFS from ships in general
corresponds with the beginnings of the Portuguese empire and if NGFS
was a critical part of their success.
The Russian General Yudenich made good use of NGFS in a non-amphibious
landing context in 1916 against the Turks. He withdrew most of his
troops from contact in the area of his main effort but left his
artillery while he took his troops along the Black Sea coast covered
by NGFS to attack the Turks and open up shorter supply lines to his
main effort.
Naval gunfire raids against enemy positions were used in the Pacific,
but never in the ETO. Why didn't the navies in the ETO perform a
coastal gunfire campaign to attrit the German coastal defenses at the
same time as the aerial campaign that was used to block German
reinforcement?
