Made in heaven and the registrar's office

In February 2006, the Supreme Court had directed the Centre and the States to introduce a provision that would make the registration of marriages compulsory
irrespective of religion. Yet, registration has been made compulsory only in five States; most States have not still complied with the orders and were
censured by the court recently for not framing and notifying the rules for registration. Now a Parliamentary panel has called for compulsory registration
in the light of a report tabled in the Lok Sabha about the increasing number of women deserted by Non-Resident Indian (NRI) husbands. The report suggests
that this would provide potent legal protection for women who are victims of fraudulent NRI marriages, for divorced women, and for those whose husbands
have abandoned them in India or abroad. A marriage entails far-reaching legal and practical consequences, and registration and the creation of a public
record of all marriages are considered automatic in any modern society. Because of unequal gender relations, women are often denied the rights that flow
from marriage and registration is particularly important for their protection. Compulsory registration would provide all women a safeguard against desertion,
aid their empowerment, and work to prevent child marriage and bigamy.

While registration in itself will not be the panacea for all the ills befalling women in unhappy marital situations, it will certainly serve as a strong
legal deterrent. It will also offer the much-needed proof in situations where the legitimate claims of women to maintenance in case of divorce, custody
rights of children, and the rights of children themselves are disputed. At the same time, compulsory registration should not become problematic for women,
which it may if unregistered marriages are deemed invalid. A woman's rights cannot be curtailed by the lack of a certificate and neither should she be
subject to difficulties and penalties because of non-registration. This could especially affect poor women in rural areas who may be victims of harassment
or bigamy or abuse. Currently, Christian and Muslim marriages provide for registration within the context of their personal laws and religious institutions,
but there is no such provision in Hindu law; registration is compulsory for civil marriages under the Special Marriage Act. It should be emphasised that
compulsory registration under the aegis of the state will not in any way impinge on personal laws but will instead enhance gender equality within all communities.
The process of registration should also be made simple and inexpensive so that the law works effectively to protect the rights of all women.

Departure of Bush's brain

Karl Rove went to Washington with the aim of ensuring that the Republicans would be in power for a long time to come. That dream lies shattered in the wake
of the many disastrous blunders committed during the six-and-a-half-year term of United States President George W. Bush. Recognition of this reality has
come in the form of Mr. Rove's resignation from the post of Deputy Chief of Staff in the White House. As Mr. Rove got ready to head home to Texas, he announced
hi s willingness to advise any or all of the candidates vying for the Republican Party's nomination for the 2008 presidential election. Not one of the
more than half a dozen in the field was prepared to accept this offer openly. Such a response indicates what the Republicans think of the Bush presidency's
impact on their electoral prospects. On the campaign trail, hardly any of them dare criticise the incumbent President for fear of alienating his diehard
conservative supporters. But if none of the GOP candidates wants to hire so formidable a political adviser and campaign organiser as Mr. Rove, it only
shows that they want to keep their distance from Mr. Bush. At a deeper level, the current administration's persistence with a hard right agenda appears
to run counter to the American people's policy preferences. A majority of them are apparently showing a greater interest in issues generally associated
with the liberal Democratic stream, and divisive social issues may no longer be the pre-occupation.

Commentators are of the view that the skill in the art of politics displayed by the man who was called &quot;Bush's brain&quot; ultimately proved his undoing when
he tried his hand at policy implementation as well. Mr. Rove had after all so skilfully coached Mr. Bush - one who had never succeeded at anything until
they teamed up - that he went on to win two terms as Governor of Texas and two presidential elections. Mr. Rove achieved his success through a mastery
of micro-targeting by which blocks of potential supporters were carefully identified and assiduously wooed. On the negative side, he displayed a penchant
for wedge politics by getting GOP supporters to cultivate an &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality. The same method was followed in the course of policy implementation.
It worked to the extent that it scared the Democrats away from opposing the invasion of Iraq. But after the occupation of the West Asian country turned
into such a monumental disaster that the Republicans lost control of Congress in the 2006 election, the Bush-Rove combine was forced to live with the consequences
of divisive politics. With the Democratic Congress unwilling to give an inch, Mr. Bush has little leeway to push his agenda.

Lessons from the Haneef episode

Vidya Subrahmaniam

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The Australian press fought valiantly for Dr. Haneef, and for once the Indian Government and the press supported a terror accused - who, in fact, turned
out to be wrongly accused

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Mohammad Haneef, yanked off a July 2 flight to India and charged by the Australian police with abetting the Glasgow terror attack, has returned home to
Bangalore - nearly vindicated and to a glorious welcome. I use the word &quot;nearly&quot; advisedly because the Australian counter-terrorism machinery is not done
with him yet. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner, Mick Keelty, has vowed to track down &quot;every lead and every piece of evidence&quot; against the
Indian doctor, who was released on July 27 after the case against him collapsed in a Brisbane court. Mr. Keelty, who was shown up during the investigation
as at once staggeringly inept and deeply prejudiced, has added a chilling post-script to the warning: &quot;the investigation has just started.&quot;

Mr. Keelty's is not an empty boast. The Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Immigration Minister, Kevin Andrews, stand rock-like behind the
rampaging police chief. Mr. Andrews has refused to reconsider the cancellation of Dr. Haneef's visa, threatening instead to get to the &quot;bottom of this
[case against the doctor].&quot; Since Dr. Haneef's release there has hardly been a day when the Minister did not seek to bring new charges against the Indian
doctor. Among other things, he has cited a non-existent Indian dossier to prove Dr. Haneef's Al-Qaeda connection and released records of an allegedly incriminating
chat room conversation between the doctor and his brother.

The Haneef case holds huge lessons for us in India. In many ways it is a typical Indian story. A terror suspect held interminably in prison, a police-prosecution
combine, armed with an extraordinary anti-terrorism law, concocting an entirely false story, and the establishment making the all-too familiar charge that
critics of the Government's handling of terrorism are necessarily &quot;supporters of terrorism.&quot; But the similarities end here.

Indeed, Dr. Haneef, who got a taste of the Keelty-Andrews power while in custody - anytime he looked like getting a legal reprieve, the duo pushed him back
into the nightmare of questioning and charges - ought not to worry unduly. For Australian civil society has a demonstrated a commitment to Dr. Haneef's
rights, well-being, and safety that stands in sharp contrast to the establishment's monomaniacal drive to bring fresh charges against him. If today the
Indian doctor has reunited with his family, it is thanks to two things - both largely outside the experience of this country. First, the support extended
to him in Australia - by the legal fraternity, the judiciary, the ordinary people, and most importantly, a vibrant press that put the police and the prosecution
under the scanner, questioning and exposing their every move. Two, the efforts made on Dr. Haneef's behalf by the Indian government. The Australian press
showed its counterpart in India the true meaning of courage and independence. And in a departure from the past, official India spoke up for Dr. Haneef
- disregarding stinging domestic criticism against defending a terror accused.

The Glasgow suicide attack happened on June 30. By July 4, the Indian press had already named the guilty, Dr. Haneef prominently among them, based on information
sourced from the police and the intelligence. Subsequent events threw up alternative explanations for everything the Indian doctor did - why he seemed
in a hurry to board the flight to India, why he had a one-way ticket and so forth. But back then, Dr. Haneef was a &quot;terror suspect&quot; who had been caught
trying to &quot;flee Australia with a tell-tale one-way ticket.&quot; The circumstantial evidence seemed strong, and provided fodder to journalists here: He was
a cousin of the Ahmad brothers, Kaleel the Glasgow suicide bomber and Sabeel, charged with knowing about the plot. From this to the Al-Qaeda connection
was but a small step: there was a rush of analyses and speculation on how the troika of the Ahmad brothers and Dr. Haneef might have ended up in the embrace
of the dreaded terror outfit. Sections of the press also felt vindicated for being able to prove that Indian terrorism was not immune to global influence.
Of course,

The crisis of indebtedness

An expert group headed by R. Radhakrishna has analysed the rising agricultural indebtedness in the country in its two dimensions: an agricultural crisis
because of low growth and declining productivity and an agrarian crisis characterised by the rural population's high dependence on farm income. The crises
are deep-rooted and have been in the making for at least two decades. The group has concluded that rural indebtedness - commonly cited as the proximate
cause for the disturbing phenomenon of farmer suicides, the most visible and tragic manifestation of the crisis - is more a symptom. The root causes included
stagnation, increasing risks in production and marketing, collapse of the extension system, growing institutional vacuum, and lack of alternative livelihood
opportunities. While the average household borrowing in rural India has not been excessive, the credit needs of agriculture have grown considerably following
its commercialisation and modernisation. The institutional credit delivery network has not been able to meet them adequately. The poor performance of credit
cooperatives and regional rural banks, the failure of commercial banks to meet their farm lending targets, and the high cost of rural banking have all
been well documented by the group. While focussing on institutions and instruments that would strengthen the rural credit delivery system, it has made
the point that a positive repayment culture should be actively promoted in the long-term interests of the financial system, with a rational scheme of incentives
in place for prompt repayment.

For revamping the rural financial architecture, the group has recommended an expansion of the rural banking network (manned by qualified personnel), credit
counselling, mobile banking, integrating microfinance with banking, and reforming the lead bank scheme. Many of these suggestions are by no means new.
While some have been engaging the attention of policy-makers for decades, harnessing technology to overcome the problems in rural credit delivery is already
being tried out in many areas. Since most banks have not met their targets for agricultural lending, the group has proposed that the unutilised portion
be transferred to NABARD or the Central government by issuing non-transferable bonds for financing agricultural development programmes. One hundred districts
identified as agriculturally backward should be taken up for development on a priority basis, it has said. The expert group has done a signal service by
coming up with a comprehensive report on India's agrarian crisis, both in its diagnostic and curative aspects.

The looming dementia threat

The first skin patch delivering a drug to treat dementia has just got U.S. Government approval. This, and recent signs of a potential breakthrough in diagnosing
Alzheimer's disease - the most common form of dementia among older people - by means of a blood test even before its symptoms become discernible, mark
significant steps in the quest for managing better the cruel, brain-destroying disorder causing progressive deterioration in memory and in thinking and
everyday abilities. It is indeed a development that governments and health policy planners need to take note of. Dementia is a general term for more than
70 conditions. Worldwide, 24 million people have dementia. The figure could rise to 42 million by 2020 and 81 million by 2040, with China and South Asian
countries witnessing a tripling of cases by 2040. A report commissioned by Alzheimer's Disease International says the Asia-Pacific region is facing an
epidemic, with the number expected to reach 65 million in 50 years, marking a five-fold increase. It seems plausible that the most striking increases may
occur in China and India. In India, the numbers are projected to grow from 3.2 million to 16 million. Given the pattern of demographic transition, the
proportion of people in the 60-plus age group will rise from under 10 per cent of the regional population today to 25 per cent by 2050.

Since the disease primarily shows up in the 60s, as more people live longer the absolute numbers affected by it will increase. Governments should make dementia
and the development of care facilities a policy priority. They need to create a widespread awareness about it and develop care services that are equipped
to be responsive. Compared with some of the killer diseases, Alzheimer's is far behind in terms of numbers and receives relatively little research funding.
But the current economic costs of the disease in the 15 Asia-Pacific countries are an estimated $60 billion. The costs will rise both in terms of the financial
burden to health systems and the toll on families. It has been estimated that if the onset of dementia could be delayed by five years through preventive
measures and pharmacological interventions, the number of sufferers would fall by half. Lifestyle changes may be important: smoking, obesity, diabetes,
and high blood pressure could be pre-disposing factors. Mental activity and a diet rich in fruit and vegetables appear to have a protective effect. Some
people appear to be genetically more susceptible than others. Detailed plans need to be drawn up to tackle the crisis and the health-care systems geared
to face up to the challenges.

The caste system - India's apartheid?

Balakrishnan Rajagopal

Having taken a principled stand in foreign policy against racial discrimination and apartheid, India should not hide behind a false sense of Third World
sovereignty in discussing the real problems of how to effectively end caste discrimination in a complex society.

In what was perhaps a controversial but telling comparison, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, on December 27, 2006, likened discrimination against Dalits in
India to the apartheid system in South Africa. A couple of months later, in February, Indian officials were busily denying the existence of caste discrimination
and untouchability, in February 2007 in New York, before a leading U.N. human rights body - the committee in charge of monitoring the implementation of
the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The Indian Solicitor General flatly denied that caste discrimination was something the outside
world should care about. This attitude of the Indian bureaucracy flatly flies in the face of not only the Prime Minister's own statement, it does not fit
in with India's own track record in dealing with caste discrimination against Dalits, which should not make it act defensively but should make it more
determined to wipe out such practices. This attitude also reveals a knee-jerk negativist mindset that the Indian foreign policy establishment has developed
over the years towards international human rights, which needs to change.

It is well known that caste discrimination against Dalits is rampant in India. In an overt form, it is both a political reality and social fact. Dalits
are subjected to violence, especially in rural areas, their women raped, and their land stolen. Dalits perform the most dangerous and odious forms of labour
in Indian society including that of manual scavenging (removing human or animal waste) or performing low-end 'dirty' wage labour in tanneries. For the
past two years, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) team has been working with Navsarjan, a leading Dalit rights NGO (non-governmental organisation)
in Gujarat, documenting the socio-economic and health consequences of manual scavenging in Gujarat, and has designed new technological and planning solutions
to the problem that go beyond the simple adoption of more anti-discrimination or sector-specific laws and policies. In Gujarat, the legal route has been
pursued as much as possible, through public interest litigation and government orders. Nevertheless, the data reveal that the number of manual scavengers
has kept increasing and is likely to be between 50,000 and 60,000 in Gujarat alone. Research indicates that social and economic discrimination against
Dalits persists to an alarming degree despite all the laws in the books. For example, in the village of Paliyad in Gujarat, where the MIT-Navsarjan team
has been working, data indicate that more than 40 per cent of manual scavengers are frequently or always denied access to the marketplace, thus preventing
normal economic activity or labour mobility.

Dalits are poorly represented in the professions, business, media, and the higher levels of the government including the police, the army, and the judiciary.
Recent studies based on available data indicate, for example, that 47 per cent of the Chief Justices of India have been Brahmins (who constitute 6.4 per
cent of the population) as have been 40 per cent of all the other judges. There is also rampant social discrimination against Dalits, including through
the caste-ridden system of 'arranged' marriages. There is little social mixing of forward castes with the Dalits through shared festivals or even routine
social interaction. Residential areas tend to be segregated along caste lines, especially in rural areas where most people still live. Caste discrimination
against Dalits is deep-rooted in society and the economy and quick-fix solutions through the law alone will not help. Measures against discrimination are
complicated by the fact that there is increasing evidence of intra-caste differentiation among Dalits, with some sub-castes like manual scavengers suffering
significantly more discrimination. For example, in the village of Paliyad, the water source for 47 per cent of manual scavengers is a 30-minute or longer
walk from their homes, while for a majority of non-scavenger Dalits that time is only five minutes or less of travel. Distance to water collection affects
health, economic productivity, and gender equality.

The Indian government delegation that appeared before the U.N. human rights body cited a litany of laws that have been passed to end

Put the nuclear deal on hold

For a mild-mannered Prime Minister who leads a government dependent on external support for survival, Manmohan Singh is demonstrating obduracy of a strange
and unreasonable kind. His current posture of 'I-must-have-the-nuclear-deal-or-I-go' suggests that the political objective of completing the elected term
of the United Progressive Alliance regime has been subordinated to the greater goal of seeing the deal through. And herein lies a fatal contradiction.
The guaranteed way of sinking the civilian nuclear deal, which this newspaper has editorially endorsed with some caveats, is for the government to go down,
taking the 123 with it. What should be clear to anyone who is not on a high horse, with blinkers, is that given the deep political polarisation there is
little chance of any other Prime Minister or government making a go of this deal in the conceivable future.

For at least two years now, Dr. Singh has been passionate in his conviction that the civilian nuclear deal he initiated with President George Bush in July
2005 was not just in the interest of India's nuclear programme, which had suffered from a harsh international regime of sanctions and technology denial;
it was a supreme national necessity because &quot;nuclear power is critical to our energy security if we want to be a world power&quot; (as he put it in a recent
interview). This conviction has been, by the Prime Minister's own admission, linked to the ideological belief that the United States wanted to help India
become a great power; that &quot;of all the U.S. Presidents,&quot; George Bush was &quot;the friendliest towards India&quot;; and that &quot;in a globalised world, Indo-U.S. relations
were the key and we needed to give them the highest importance.&quot; But the UPA government finds itself in a hopeless minority in Parliament on this critical
issue. There is also considerable opposition outside Parliament, with the community of scientists and the intelligentsia divided down the middle and the
public mood uncertain.

&quot;A Country is Not a Company,&quot; argued Paul Krugman in a celebrated 1996 paper published in the Harvard Business Review. He made the point that &quot;the style
of thinking necessary for economic analysis is very different from that which leads to success in business&quot; and further that a failure to understand this
can lead to disastrous mistakes. The economist in Dr. Singh needs to realise that arguments drawing from 'decarbonising the economy' exercises done in
the Planning Commission combining with ill-founded ambitions of becoming a great power by becoming the sole superpower's camp follower are likely to flop
in the democratic political arena. It may be perfectly true that the Bharatiya Janata Party is the co-progenitor of this nuclear deal. But the reality
is that the principal opposition party has aggressively attacked the deal as a sell-out of national interests, and specifically of the country's ambition
of developing &quot;a minimum credible nuclear deterrent.&quot; Its leaders are salivating at the thought of this Congress-led regime falling on so sensitive an
issue. As important politically is the nature of opposition from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its left partners whose bloc of 61 MPs provide
life support for the UPA government. The CPI(M) has made it clear that it has serious problems with some of the specifics of the 123 read along with the
Hyde Act and has asked the government not to go ahead even with the next step towards operationalisation. But its larger political objection is that the
nuclear deal is part of a strategic alliance with the U.S. encompassing political, economic, and military aspects; and therefore has &quot;adverse consequences
for an independent foreign policy, sovereignty, and the economic interests of the people.&quot; And the Manmohan Singh regime knows it will get no quarter from
the recently formed 'third force' bloc, the UNPA.

So for reasons analogous to why a country is not a company, this minority government must understand the difference between economic and technical analysis
- which, in the eyes of critics, basically relies on showing how nuclear power's 3 per cent contribution to India's overall energy production can be raised
to 7 per cent by 2020 - and what makes for sustainable political success. Non-transparency, which has been in evidence for much of the time this nuclear
deal has been in process, has taken its toll of political and public support; and unprincipled compromises such as the U.S.-coerced ganging up against
Iran in the governing board of the International Atomic Energy Agency and deepening military relations with the U.S. have had their influence on political
perceptions of the 123 agreement.

The way to resolve the present political crisis is for the UPA government to put the 123 on hold, and for the Congress party and its allies to persuade
Prime Minister Singh, who continues to command wide respect in India and abroad, not to be inflexible. The government can pursue the deal by scheduling
an earnest round of all-party discussions, which must take in objections, apprehensions, reservations, and questions relating to the nuclear deal that
have come from all serious quarters. False notions of prestige and credibility, within India and internationally, must not be allowed to come in the way
of this larger political necessity. There is nothing sacrosanct about the timeline indicated for the final three steps in the nuclear deal. President Bill
Clinton did not resign or even go into a deep sulk when one of his key projects, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, was rejected 51-48 by the U.S. Senate
in October 1999. The CTBT - which opened for signature more than a decade ago and has been signed by 177 countries and ratified by 139 of them - has not
yet been enabled to enter into force but there are hopes of reviving it. Heavens will not fall if the 123 agreement is put on hold and all the issues opened
up for discussion. There is a risk that it may fall by the wayside but that is clearly worth taking, especially if the risk is measured against the virtual
certainty of the nuclear deal being buried if the UPA government falls.

Why the CPI(M) and the Left oppose the nuclear deal

Prakash Karat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The Left parties continue to accord priority to having a secular government and keeping the communal forces at bay. But this cannot be taken by the UPA
government as licence to go ahead with a long-term agreement that has such serious implications for India's independent foreign policy and sovereignty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The Left parties have called upon the United Progressive Alliance government not to proceed further with the civilian nuclear cooperation agreement with
the United States. The bilateral agreement arrived at between the two governments in the end of July 2007 has resulted in a political crisis. At no time
has an external agreement negotiated by the Indian government raised such a political storm as the nuclear cooperation deal with the United States. The
last time there was strong opposition was during the negotiations for the Marrakesh treaty, which led to the setting up of the World Trade Organisation.

Without going into the complex and technical issues concerning civilian nuclear cooperation, it is necessary to take a wider look at the implications of
the agreement. Is this only a nuclear cooperation deal or is it part of a wider agreement? If so, does it protect our capacity for an independent foreign
policy and how will it affect our sovereignty? One can legitimately question whether India should partner the United States in the global democracy enterprise.
&quot;Regime change&quot; and the implanting of democracy have yielded horrific results in Iraq.

The nuclear cooperation deal is only one part of the wide-ranging alliance that the UPA government has forged with the United States. This was spelt out
by the Indian Prime Minister and the American President in the joint statement in July 2005 in Washington. This agreement covers political, economic, military,
and nuclear cooperation. This alliance entails not just nuclear cooperation but talks of the two countries promoting global democracy, revamping the Indian
economy to facilitate large scale investment by the United States, and a strategic military collaboration.

Prior to the joint statement of July 2005, the UPA government signed a ten-year Defence Framework Agreement with the Untied States. It is evident that without
the defence agreement, the Americans would not have agreed to civilian nuclear cooperation. This seems part of a quid pro quo.

Repeated assertions that India's foreign policy will not be subject to external pressures have not evoked confidence after the Iran episode. Spokesmen for
the Bush administration have often cited India's attitude on Iran to be a test. Even before the nuclear cooperation agreement was finalised, the government
responded by voting against Iran not once but twice in the International Atomic Energy Agency.

The first serious conflict with the Left arose when the UPA government did a volte-face on the Iran nuclear issue. The government voted along with the U.S.
and other Western countries in September 2005 and was not even prepared to go along with the position adopted by the bloc of Non-Aligned Movement countries.

The Left parties have been watching with disquiet the way the UPA government has gone about forging close strategic and military ties with the United States.
The Left came out in strong opposition to the Defence Framework Agreement. According to this agreement, India is taking steps to interlock our armed forces
with that of the United States in the name of &quot;inter-operability.&quot; The framework agreement is leading to various steps like the Logistics Support Agreement
and the Maritime Cooperation Pact. The Left has been

Controlling hypertension

Hypertension is a chronic and serious condition that is treatable. Because it attacks the body's organs silently, it must be detected early and controlled
with effective drugs. According to a global estimate made in 2000, there were about 118 million Indians, half of them women, with hypertension. The Lancet,
which published the data two years ago, recently argued that aggressive control strategies are necessary because the number of hypertensive p eople is
increasing sharply in developing countries, including rising nations like India and China. There are more hypertensive people in urban areas than in the
countryside. City dwellers consume more fat and salt today, particularly through processed foods, and often have a sedentary lifestyle. The long-term outcome
of untreated hypertension (and diabetes) will be a staggering caseload of people suffering from complications - cardiovascular disease, stroke, renal failure,
and dementia. India's response to this situation needs to match the problem in scale. What is needed is a major national thrust on chronic diseases that
is, at the least, comparable to the initiatives on infectious diseases. Such a mission must reach out to the remotest parts of the country and to urban
residents providing routine screening, early treatment, and uninterrupted access to drugs.

Outstanding results are possible in the control of chronic diseases if there is a systematic and sincere effort to prevent, identify, and treat diabetes
and hypertension. A voluntary body, the Kidney Help Trust, produced remarkable results in Sriperumbudur taluk of Tamil Nadu, where nephrologist M. K. Mani
and his team prevented renal failure using low-cost methods. After a decade of dedicated work based on screening and early treatment, they found that 10.79
per 1,000 had renal impairment in the area they served compared with 27.51 persons per 1,000 in the general population; most hearteningly, renal impairment
was prevented or delayed in 17 persons per 1,000. Such initiatives can be successfully scaled up if the strategy outlined by the National Commission on
Macroeconomics and Health (2005) is implemented in all States. The key is to use the public health network to provide health education, routine screening
in primary health centres, and early treatment in community, sub-district, and district-level facilities and also in tertiary hospitals. Providing universal
access to effective drugs against hypertension and diabetes may involve allocation of additional resources. But there is no real constraint on spending
today. Government revenues are rising handsomely thanks to robust economic growth and any increase in expenditure to lower morbidity and mortality is money
well spent.

Southern synergies

At a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) initiative last week, the Tourism Secretaries of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry inked an
agreement to forge a southern regional tourism grid. Karnataka, which was not represented at the meeting, may be expected to fall in line before long.
It is time the southern States realised that while healthy competition among themselves was good, much more could be achieved if they worked together on
a common agenda. Thi s should include areas such as power, river waters, education, health, and tourism. A certain amount of coordination has been established
in the energy sector and a mechanism, in the form of a well-knit grid, is in place to ensure equitable distribution and sharing of power. Except in rare
instances when power is overdrawn causing a trip in supply to a neighbouring State, this seems to be working well. Tourism offers significant potential
for cooperation, both in marketing the destinations and in putting together convenient and attractive packages covering important centres across the region.
At the Puducherry meeting, the focus was basically on heritage and pilgrim centres of the south.

As of now, most of the coordinated tourism packages emerge from the private trade. The government-owned tourism development corporations in these States
need to come up with imaginative tour plans to suit different budgets and time frames. The region is replete with fascinating beach resorts, hill stations,
pilgrim centres, and heritage and historic sites. What the governments and their tourism boards are required to do is to work out packages leveraging the
best of the region. The logistics of the programmes have to be tied up firmly so that the tourists are not left in the lurch anywhere. In respect of transportation
as well as accommodation, the preferences and budgets of the tourists must be kept in mind. First of all, the States must sort out the problems in road
transport services. Talks have begun in Karnataka, for instance, to work out new agreements for inter-State permits. It is essential to facilitate free
inter-State movement of people and goods, and to make travel easy and cheap for domestic tourists. At a time when air travel has become affordable to many,
and the number of trains is increasing every year, road transport cannot afford to lag behind. The tourism departments and corporations should lose no
time in formulating, and implementing, concrete plans for boosting regional tourist traffic. In this, the CII can possibly be roped in to play a catalytic
role.

Setting up SCO as a counter to NATO

Vladimir Radyuhin

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

By timing war games to coincide with its summit, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation has sought to demonstrate its growing regional clout and focus on
security and counterterrorism.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is flexing its military muscles like never before. On August 17 the leaders of the SCO watched in Siberia the final
stage of the largest yet war games of the grouping. About 6,000 soldiers, more than 1,000 combat vehicles, and scores of aircraft practised combat skills
in 'Peace Mission-2007,' a week-long anti-terror drill staged in the Chelyabinsk region of Russia.

The Siberian military manoeuvres were significant in several ways. It was for the first time that the SCO leaders attended the war games. It was also for
the first time that the militaries of all the SCO members took part in the drill. Finally, it was for the first time that China dispatched its troops to
train abroad.

The Presidents of Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan travelled to the West Siberian town of Chebarkul after meeting for an
annual summit in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, on Thursday (August 16). By timing the war games to coincide with the summit, the SCO sought to demonstrate its growing
regional clout and focus on security and counterterrorism.

The SCO leaders have repeatedly denied any plans to transform their group into a defence alliance, but the security component of the organisation has been
expanding at breathtaking pace. Three years ago the SCO set up a modest Regional Anti-Terror Structure (RATS) for information exchange and joint training
of national security services. Two years later cooperation between the Defence Ministries was institutionalised through the establishment of a Defence
Ministers Council, and earlier this year Russia circulated a draft agreement to formalise closer military ties among the SCO states.

Beijing has now backed Moscow's proposal to establish a partnership between the SCO and the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, a defence pact of former
Soviet states, even though earlier it was reluctant to have ties with a strictly military alliance and rejected Moscow's initiative to make 'Peace Mission-2007'
a joint exercise of the SCO and CSTO. &quot;I think the SCO and the CSTO can and must cooperate,&quot; Chinese Ambassador to Russia Liu Guchang said in the run-up
to the Bishkek summit. CSTO Secretary-General Nikolai Bordyuzha had earlier announced that the two organisations would shortly sign a protocol on cooperation
and might hold joint military training in future.

China is the only member of the SCO that does not participate in the CSTO, described as Warsaw Pact-2, and a formalised partnership between the two organisations
would lay the basis for a defence alliance between Russia and China in Central Asia and turn the SCO into an effective counterweight to the U.S. and NATO
in the region.

In Bishkek, the SCO leaders signed a treaty of &quot;long-term good neighbourliness, friendship and cooperation.&quot; The pact will serve to further thwart the U.S.
plan to create a &quot;Greater Central Asia&quot; that would be off bounds to Russia and China.

A political declaration adopted in Bishkek bluntly stated that regional security was the responsibility of the SCO and no one else. &quot;The heads of state
think that stability and security in Central Asia can be ensured primarily through the efforts taken by the nations of the region on the basis of existing
regional organisations,&quot; the declaration said.

The declaration was a reminder to the U.S. that the SCO's two-year-old demand to Washington to set a deadline for the withdrawal of its military forces
from Central Asia was still on the table. The reminder sounded particularly loud as the SCO leaders met in Bishkek several kilometres away from a U.S.
airbase at the Kyrgyz main airport Manas. It is the only remaining U.S. base in Central Asia after Uzbekistan closed down another airbase the Pentagon
had set up to support its anti-Taliban operation in Afghanistan.

The Russian and Chinese leaders both called in Bishkek for closer security cooperation within the SCO. President Vladimir Putin said the 'Peace Mission-2007'
war games were part of &quot;a joint system of rapid reaction to regional threats&quot; that is being set up &quot;to enhance the SCO potential in the sphere of security.&quot;
Intriguingly, the scenario for 'Peace Mission-2007' - freeing a town

Restoration of justice

No political system is free from the colourable exercise of power or the commission of honest mistakes, as India knows very well. The cornerstone of a robust
democracy lies in its ability to correct itself - and quickly. The saga of Mohammed Haneef has had its share of twists and turns, but the ordeal of the
Indian doctor, whose Australian work visa was revoked after he was falsely charged with supporting a terrorist organisation, would have been much worse
in the ab sence of a swift and impartial justice delivery system. The Brisbane Federal Court's decision to quash the Australian government's revocation
of his visa on &quot;character&quot; grounds is the latest victory for Dr. Haneef - against whom all charges in connection with the failed terrorist attacks in London
and Glasgow were dropped after the prosecution admitted serious mistakes were made in rushing the case to court. In a ruling that is a blow to the Liberal
government in Canberra, the court held that Australian Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews had applied the &quot;wrong test&quot; and fell into &quot;jurisdictional error&quot;
while cancelling Dr. Haneef's visa. It also ordered the Australian government to pay the Indian doctor's legal expenses.

The circumstances under which the work visa was revoked were extraordinary. The decision was taken soon after a magistrate had granted Dr. Haneef bail and
it was followed up by an order that he should stay in detention until the trial began in the 'terrorism' case. Mr. Andrews compounded his egregious conduct
by refusing to restore Dr. Haneef's visa even after the charges were dropped. Not surprisingly, there was widespread suspicion that, with a general election
round the corner, John Howard's Liberal government was cynically using the Haneef issue as a security scare to shore up its flagging political fortunes.
Even if the Brisbane court's ruling was made essentially on a finding of jurisdictional error, it does seem like the final exoneration of a man who suffered
under Australia's draconian anti-terrorism laws; was victimised by a shoddy police investigation; and suffered harassment by a government acting in high-handed
and insensitive manner. Mr. Andrews's assertion that he cancelled the visa &quot;in the national interest and I stand by that decision&quot; and the decision to
appeal against the Brisbane court's verdict suggest that the John Howard government is unrepentant and defiant in this matter, evidently for political
ends. The silver lining is the self-corrective nature of the justice system. The prosecuting authorities owned up once they discovered they had made a
grave error of judgment and now the court has rendered justice by restoring Dr. Haneef's work visa.

Producing a synthetic bacterium

It is debatable whether the claim the famous and controversial scientist, Craig Venter, and his team working at the Maryland-based J. Craig Venter Institute
made last year - in a patent filed to produce a truly 'synthetic' bacterium with minimal genomes - is significant. While the genome of the bacterium was
produced synthetically in the laboratory, a 'synthetic' bacterium, which has been named Mycoplasma laboratorium in the patent and will eventually be created
using the minimal genome, cannot in the strict sense be called man-made. To be called synthetic, no naturally available component should be used. In that
sense, the scientists from the reputed institute, the first to publish the sequence of the human genome, will at best be able to produce a semi-synthetic

M. genitalium bacterium. The synthetic genome produced by them will be put into a naturally occurring cell that will have only its nucle us removed. While
this will ensure the removal of the genetic material, the cell will still contain many other materials without which the M. genitalium genome introduced
cannot survive and reproduce. The procedure described by them is, in many ways, similar to that followed for producing embryonic stem cells. Many scientists
are working to produce a truly synthetic organism that has no trace of natural components. Synthetic flu virus and polio virus were built from scratch
using the genome sequence a few years ago. Yet they were not considered synthetic as viruses need a host to replicate.

Apart from producing the synthetic genome, their achievement has been to arrive at the minimum number of essential genes needed for sustaining life. The
wall-less M. genitalium bacterium with just 482 genes, the smallest number to b e seen in any naturally occurring organism, is the best experimental platform
and hence the natural choice for scientists to produce a bacterium with 'minimal genome.' The patent filed by them cites 381 as the minimal genome for
the M. laboratorium that would allow the bacterium to replicate in a controlled environment. This is one less than the number they had stated in a paper
published in a journal last year. While their work on the minimal genome and synthetic genome is indeed remarkable - as it lends itself to a variety of
applications - filing the patent application has irked many. While patents have been granted to individual genes, this is the first time a patent has been
filed for an entire genome sequence. If granted, it will handicap researchers in the area and may not augur well for the advancement of science.

Looking beyond ballot-box democracy

Hasan Suroor

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The question whether it makes sense to insist on a one-size-fits-all model has become one of the most hotly debated issues in the wake of attempts to impose
the Westminster model on other countries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

The debate on the west-inspired push for democracy, especially in the Muslim world, has tended, so far, to focus broadly on two issues: the moral and legal
legitimacy of regime change in pursuit of democracy; and western double standards in dealing with governments it doesn't like, as reflected in its cynical
refusal to recognise the democratically elected Hamas administration in Palestine while propping up a friendly dictator in Pakistan.

What this debate has overlooked is the rapidly changing nature of democracy as it spreads to regions that have no previous experience of western-style democracy
and is embraced by groups who see it, essentially, as a ballot-box exercise - a means to acquire democratic legitimacy. Increasingly, the western notion
of liberal democracy as the embodiment of the values of Enlightenment - equality, justice, rule of law, free speech, and individual freedoms - is being
supplanted by newer forms. And it can no longer be assumed that a democratically elected government is ipso facto enlightened as well. The good news is
that democracy is spreading but mostly as an instrument of political power sans liberalism.

Commentators are warning of a creeping &quot;democratic trap&quot; whereby mass-based, and often sectarian, parties are using elections to gain political respectability.
Take Northern Ireland where the governing coalition is made up of two extremist parties, Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party. Yet they fancy themselves,
and are seen, as democratic parties because they have electoral sanction. Then there is Hamas, a political force with huge popular support as shown by
its impressive triumph in last year's polls. But progressive? Notwithstanding the west's rank hypocrisy in not recognising its democratic mandate, Hamas'
brand of politics is closer to revolutionary militancy than liberal democracy. Similarly, the reformist mood in Turkey's governing AKP (Justice and Development
Party), which just pulled off a massive election victory, is inspired less by a conversion to a secular and liberal ethos and owes more to political compulsions
arising out of its ambition to join the European Union. Iran has a version of democracy but it remains a theocratic state with severe restrictions on individual
freedoms, especially for non-Muslims. Even in India where democracy is alive and well, the ballot box has been used by thinly disguised reactionary groups
to claim a democratic mandate for their policies.

At the non-democratic end of the spectrum, on the other hand, there is someone like Pervez Musharraf, a military dictator, in love with his uniform and
shy of direct elections. But his social instincts are liberal. He is also secular and has gone some way to open up Pakistani society. The Pakistani media
have enjoyed unprecedented freedom under his government and women are breathing more easily than they did even under the democratically elected and supposedly
liberal Benazir Bhutto.

It is far from my intention to bat for a military dictatorship, however benign. For all its imperfections, democracy remains the best option but there are
good democracies grounded in democratic principles and there are dodgy power-grabs dressed up as democracies. It is important to recognise this distinction
and consider whether progressive politics can sometimes also be found outside the ballot-box framework.

Under many democratic governments today people, effectively, have as little say in what is done in their name, once they have voted a party to power, as
a Christmas turkey. They bear no resemblance to Lincoln's idea of a &quot;government of the people, by the people, for the people.&quot; Over time, democracy has
become essentially an instrument of winning power and there is a danger of falling deeper into a &quot;democratic trap&quot; if we continue to confuse a democratic
mandate with democratic values. The latter require a democratic worldview and, more importantly, the political will to put it into practice. The assumption
that democracy in any form, even if it fails to uphold democratic principles, is preferable to all other systems of governance is slightly flawed. The
ultimate test of a system is whether people, especially the more vulnerable, feel

Recall Ronen Sen

'Misfortunes never come singly.' Caught in a time of troubles, the United Progressive Alliance government is being ambushed from all sides. India's Ambassador
to the United States, Ronen Sen, had a sudden attack of foot in mouth disease. What precisely did he say in Washington to cause such strife in India's
Parliament? The report of his interview (&quot;Ambassador Sen: 'We will have zero credibility'&quot;) to rediff.com reveals, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that he
took potshots at the political parties and leaders who oppose the nuclear deal. Aziz Haniffa, an experienced journalist who has stood by his report, quotes
the Ambassador as commenting: &quot;It has been approved here (in Washington, DC) by the President and there (in New Delhi) it's been approved by the Indian
Cabinet. So why do you have all this running around like headless chicken[s], looking for a comment here or comment there, and these little storms in a
teacup?&quot; Also: &quot;I am really bothered that 60 years after independence, they are so insecure - that we have not grown up, this lack of confidence and lack
of self-respect.&quot; The report on the interview helpfully, if somewhat breathlessly, places the remarks in context by revealing in the lead that Mr. Sen,
&quot;a key protagonist of the U.S.-India civilian nuclear agreement, and the architect behind scripting the resurrection of the 123 Agreement as it lay virtually
dormant.is quite aghast at the opposition to the deal from the Left parties, not to mention the Bharatiya Janata Party's attempts to torpedo it.&quot;

But is foot in mouth disease the only problem with this diplomat? A plain reading of Mr. Sen's remarks as reported by Mr. Haniffa reveals a state of mind
that has crossed all limits of sobriety in relation to the nuclear deal; that is soaked in foreign policy dependence; that is intolerant, and arrogantly
so, of any opposition to the deal; that is completely sold on President George Bush as India's once-in-a-millennium benefactor and saviour. How else to
explain the comment that if &quot;the clock runs out in the wake of all the opposition in India and calls for special committees to review it and everything
else.it would be a pity because what the Prime Minister said is very true - that we will not, and there has not been and I don't think in the near future
we will see such a friend and supporter as this President. Absolutely. There is none.&quot; Or does this sound like a sober assessment of a deal not yet completed:
&quot;There has been no parallel of a single country exemption to any of the international regimes.not in the 21st century, the 20th, 19th, 18th, 17th, 16th,
in any century.&quot; Mr. Sen's clarification - which is one-third denial, one-third rationalisation, one third admission and apology - just won't wash. He
is not fit to be India's Ambassador anywhere. The UPA government will be wasting its, and Parliament's, time if it expects to get away with anything short
of Mr. Sen's recall - and will indeed find itself in a deeper political mess should it attempt to defend the indefensible and the disgraceful.

Quirkish adventure?

While the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) understandably views the formation of the Indian Cricket League (ICL) as a disruptive development,
its tough official stand is entirely in keeping with its reputation for thinking conventionally. The Board can ill afford an exodus at the domestic level
where standards have suffered from ODI fixation and long-term neglect. Severely depleted State sides - Hyderabad and Bengal, for instance, have lost more
than half a dozen cricketers - will compromise domestic cricket's credibility further. Consequently, the Sharad Pawar administration felt the need for
both prohibition and reward: hence the decisions to prevent those aligning with the ICL from &quot;being part of BCCI activities or deriving any benefits from
the BCCI,&quot; and to increase the lucre of the domestic game. The sacking of Kapil Dev as chairman of the National Cricket Academy, although not unexpected,
is unfortunate. Instead of venting its spleen on the rebels, the Board would do well to address the cause of the ICL's success in weaning away close to
50 of its cricketers. More than one cricketer has spoken of being disillusioned with the system. Perceived shabby treatment precipitated the Packer divide
in the late 1970s and, unsurprisingly, Kapil Dev is positioning the ICL as being run by cricketers for cricketers.

Another parallel with the Packer series is the genesis of the conflict. The Australian media mogul felt spurned by the Australian cricket administrators
when he bid for international broadcast rights. The current Indian cricket administration has inherited the problem from its predecessor, which refused
Zee's offer, sowing the seeds of the ICL. Just how entertaining a spectacle a hodgepodge of honest practitioners and the odd international marquee name,
playing for neither national pride nor historical legitimacy, can put on is open to question. Advertisers have expressed interest, noting that the ICL
offers a less expensive option than international cricket, but ultimately, the quality of the product will dictate its revenue. Cricket is supposed to
be an abiding passion in India but recent events have confirmed that only ODI cricket featuring Indian stars sells out stadiums. Will the ICL turn out
to be more than a quirkish and short-lived adventure?

The Middle East: the way forward

Mohamed Higazy

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Israel should be persuaded to respond positively to the opportunity created by the Arab League peace initiative and work with the Palestinian Authority
and the regional and international partners to start a peace process that will lead to the creation of a viable Palestinian State.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Upon an invitation of the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA), a conference was convened on June 22, 2007 to commemorate 40 years of the Israeli occupation
of the Arab territories. The conference reflected in its debates and discussions the commitment of all spectrum of the Indian society to support the just
cause of the Palestinian people and their plight under Israeli occupation. Therefore, I feel obliged at the outset to express a word of recognition and
gratitude to the Indian Government and the people of India who have stood, over the years, firm and committed to the side of justice and in supporting
the independence of Palestine and the end of the Israeli occupation.

We have all been following the tragic events taking place in the Gaza Strip recently. It is certainly very sad to see brothers turning against each other
after decades of heroic resistance. Palestinians should remain united and should not crack under the heavy-handed policy of the occupation. Like so much
that has been going wrong in the Occupied Territories, these regrettable events are merely a symptom of the root cause of the problem affecting the Middle
East as a whole, which is the continuation of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories. We all hope that the Palestinian National Authority
with the help of the Arab and international partners will bring peace and reconciliation between the different Palestinian factions.

The latest developments in Gaza should not at any moment draw our attention away from the fundamental reality of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories
as well as the Syrian Golan Heights and what is left in Lebanese Occupied Territories, as being the core issue of the conflict in the Middle East. The
Israeli occupation should be looked at as the illness and any other development as merely a symptom. Therefore, ending the occupation is like curing the
disease that has exhausted the body of Palestine and anguished the heart of the Middle East, and preoccupied for decades the mind of the whole world.

The Arab-Israeli conflict has squandered the resources and disrupted the lives of the people of the Middle East for many years. With its political, historical
and religious dimensions this is a clear and continued threat to world peace and stability and, most importantly, to the relations between various cultures
and faiths in the world. Hence, the importance for all of us, people living in this region and members of the international community alike, to act in
concert to reach an immediate, just and comprehensive solution to this conflict.

The ugly practices of the Israeli occupation in the Palestinian territories provide further evidence of the lack of international commitment in dealing
with the rights and future of the Palestinian people. Daily incursions, target killings, road blocks and the segregation wall among many other lawless
practices have left little hope, if any, in future peace plans. Today, more than ever, the international community and its institutions should act immediately
to end the Palestinian suffering under occupation and to allow moderation and the voice of peace to prevail. Otherwise, only radicalism and fundamentalism
will further dominate the scene to the loss of all among them or, on top of them, both the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.

As we all know, the International Quartet has drawn up a road map for peace. It was accepted by the parties and the states of the region. It was also endorsed
by the United Nations Security Council in its resolution 1515. It was hopeful that it would constitute the political framework for negotiation and the
end of the conflict. However, this did not happen for many reasons; among them was the lack of international political will and clarity about the endgame,
and the failure to curb Israel's continuous breach of Palestinian rights. The international community should renew its adherence to principles of peaceful
co-existence between Israel and Palestine and determine the general parameters of the final settlement among

The acquittal and after

When Shibu Soren was convicted by a trial court in November 2006 for conspiring to murder his private secretary, the Central Bureau of Investigation prided
itself on having marshalled a wealth of 'scientific evidence' to nail him. But the Delhi High Court has now tossed that aside, chiding the prosecution
for having &quot;miserably failed in bringing home the charges against the accused persons.&quot; The court has clearly adjudged that the forensic evidence - comprising
DNA fingerprinting, advanced skull superimposition tests, and a post-mortem report - was either inconclusive or not properly considered. The High Court's
conclusion that the CBI failed to prove its case against the former Union Minister and President of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha was based on two main grounds.
First, the CBI failed to prove that the body it had recovered from a farmhouse near Ranchi, the key piece of evidence in the case, was that of Shashinath
Jha, Mr. Soren's secretary. (Mr. Jha, who allegedly knew about money received by JMM MPs from the Congress party, went missing in 1994; a skeleton said
to be his was exhumed by the CBI in 1998.) The High Court also ruled that the trial court relied much too heavily on the skull superimposition tests, a
procedure that maps skulls with faces with the help of photographs, producing results that were at best inconclusive. The trial court was also faulted
for ignoring the decisive DNA tests conducted on the skeletal remains.

Secondly, the High Court held that the CBI had failed to establish the existence of a conspiracy to abduct and murder Mr. Jha. Observing there was nothing
on record to show &quot;when and where the conspiracy was hatched,&quot; it said the trial court's conclusion that the conspiracy was proved was &quot;fanciful and based
on conjectures.&quot; The Delhi High Court ruling clears the path for Mr. Soren to return to ministerial office either at the Centre or at the State level.
But Mr. Soren is an accused in another case, relating to the killing of 10 villagers during the campaign for a Jharkhand State in 1975. Almost half the
accused in the three-decade-old case are dead. In 2004, an arrest warrant in this case forced Mr. Soren's resignation as Coal Minister. He was reinstated
in the Union Cabinet in early 2006, but resigned once more following his conviction in the Jha murder case. In the wake of Mr. Soren's exoneration, Chief
Minister Madhu Koda of Jharkhand has announced his willingness to vacate the chair in favour of &quot;Guruji.&quot; The CBI has declared it will appeal against the
acquittal but it is extremely unlikely that the outcome will be any different. It is best that the country's premier investigation agency heeds the import
of the High Court's emphatic judgment that the prosecution failed &quot;miserably&quot; to bring home the charges.

Rising income inequality in Asia

The key findings of a recent study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) relating to income inequalities across Asia ought to find a ready resonance in India
where the economic and political discourses of the day are focussed on themes such as inclusive growth and growth with equity. In saying that in Asia the
rich are growing richer faster than the poor, the ADB has reinforced the widely held view that in India the fruits of rapid economic growth are not reaching
the poor i n a substantial measure is true of the rest of the continent as well. Relative inequality deals with proportionate differences in incomes and,
as measured by the Gini coefficient, it has been rising in most of the 22 Asian countries covered by the study but significantly in China, Bangladesh,
Nepal, and Sri Lanka between mid-1990s and 2005. A higher Gini coefficient indicates higher inequality. The ADB has found that absolute inequality - the
actual difference in incomes reckoned in dollars - has also been increasing everywhere. That, in the context of the rapid economic growth these countries
have been witnessing, has had one major consequence. The better-off sections have experienced considerably large increases in their standards of living
than the least well-off. The expenditures of the rich forming part of the top quintile have increased much more than those at the bottom quintile. That
the poor are not getting poorer is some consolation, though. However, the inference is obvious that there is a fundamental flaw in the patterns of economic
growth in most of these countries and it needs to be addressed .

The widening rich-poor divide suggests that the emerging economies like India - unlike Japan, South Korea and a few other countries that managed to achieve
growth with equity early on - will have to refashion their strategies to make inclusive growth a reality. The consequences of rising inequalities can be
dire. The ADB report, citing Nepal which has one of the highest levels of income disparity, says that it can lead to political unrest. India's Gini coefficient
rose from 32.9 in 1993 to 36.2 in 2004. Although India does not figure at the top of the countries with high income inequalities, it ranks poorly on the
basis of benchmarks in other areas such as land and health. The ADB report's value is enhanced because of its inter-country comparisons. In particular,
it makes out a strong case for increased public investment in the social sector and in infrastructure-supporting economic activities that benefit the poor.

Between progress and reluctance

Krishna Kumar

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Any agenda for educational reform must start by recognising that children belong to a special category of citizens because they cannot protect their own
rights. There is no alternative to evolving a child-centred system of governance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Kusum Nair's classic, Blossoms in the Dust, which was first published in 1961, provides a benchmark for judging India's progress. The book describes her
travels and conversations with villagers across many regions of India. Her conclusion about the prospects of development in rural India was that modern
means of production alone will not succeed unless there is a change in values and attitudes. Her major advice to planners was that they must recognise
the sharp diversity of values and perceptions that prevails between and within different regions. Apparently, she hoped that education would play a big
role in bringing about social change. This expectation was shared by several social scientists and commentators of the 1960s.

Perceived as a panacea for many familiar ills, education was itself in dire need of reform. Its colonial character had exacerbated the very malaise that
it was supposed to cure. For instance, the stigma attached to manual work was at the heart of caste and gender-based hierarchies. The spread of education
has undoubtedly helped to develop fissures in these hierarchies, but the outcomes of this significant change are unevenly distributed. Between caste and
gender, the latter provides far more visible and pervasive evidence of change than does the former. Educational and employment opportunities have changed
the lives of millions of women along lines that had already surfaced in the late colonial period. Women's autonomy and lack of fear have become increasingly
more manifest in our public life, but there is an irony in this. From the early decades of the 20th century onwards, educated women started to face a rough
time in seeking social acceptance. Their personal and emotional experiences got tougher as their levels of educational attainment increased. The reason
was that while education opened up a new world to women, it failed to socialise men into a new, corresponding mould. Men's expectations from women remained
unchanged, and hence women's emancipation evoked conflict, aggression, even violence. Looking around, we can witness this state of affairs daily. Searching
for the causes responsible for this lopsided impact of education, we would soon realise that what education teaches, its curriculum, has failed to keep
pace with the requirements of sensitising society to new realities. On the front of caste, education didn't even try to change the values reinforcing the
caste system. An assumption prevailed that the bonds of caste would on their own, somewhat magically, loosen up as a result of literacy and success in
examination.

Neglecting teacher training has further compounded the losses incurred on account of indifferently induced, or entirely absent, curricular changes. Teachers
constitute the most important factor in determining the quality of children's experience at school. Today, millions of children born to illiterate parents
are expected to attend school, yielding the exciting potential to nurture a thoughtful and tolerant society of the kind the Constitution envisions. Yet
hardly any State is in a position to realise this potential because the welfare and training of teachers have been ignored everywhere. Instead of moving
forward, in this sector we have actually regressed. School teachers had played an important role in the national movement, both as individuals and as a
professional group. Far from treating them as a national resource for deeper social churning, independent India treated them as a faceless mass of literate
workers. The Chattopadhyaya Commission appointed by Indira Gandhi in 1983 noted that &quot;today the average teacher's perception of his role and responsibility
is far too limited and is concerned with his own immediate tasks.&quot; The Commission felt that the teacher must &quot;actively and feelingly associate himself,
as an essential and responsible partner, in the great tasks which face the nation.&quot; This recommendation failed to save the school teacher's status as it
declined rapidly over the decade of the 1990s, and continues to do so today. The profession has lost all attraction for the young, due to which only those

Who's afraid of NREGA?

As the United Progressive Alliance government battles for survival, it may be worth pondering over one of its most impressive achievements, the National
Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) of 2005. This far-sighted legislation guarantees rural households one hundred days of work every year. The Act,
which came into force in 2006, is operational in 330 districts across the country. In pioneer districts such as Dungarpur in Rajasthan and Villupuram in
Tamil Nadu, social m onitoring has demonstrated quite dramatically how the lives of the rural poor have been changed by this progressive measure, whose
benefits include the economic emancipation of women, wage security for impoverished families, and the creation of public assets. Despite occasional reports
of embezzlement, the experience on the ground has shown that a culture of accountability and public vigilance is gaining strength, along with better enforcement
of the transparency safeguards. This in turn facilitates the success of some of the fundamental principles of NREGA - a rights-based approach to work,
the payment of minimum wages, and equal entitlements for women.

Currently there is a lot of unevenness in implementation across States. While failures and disasters tend to hog media attention, there are several success
stories. Tamil Nadu shows the largest participation of women at 81 per cent. In Rajasthan, where public awareness of NREGA is quite high, the programme
generated as many as 77 days of employment per rural household in 2006-07. A recent field survey in Chhattisgarh (Surguja and Koriya Districts) found that
most families have 'job cards;' contractors have disappeared; minimum wages are being paid; corruption levels have gone down; and employment is being generated
on a massive scale. Even in the leading districts there are concerns such as a shortage of staff, poor worksite facilities, notably the lack of water and
the absence of crèches for the children of working women. There are problems also with the measurement of work. A fair and reasonable revision of the schedule
of rates is needed, based on the nature of work, the type of soil, and other factors. There is an urgent need for stricter implementation of the transparency
safeguards, such as the proper maintenance of 'job cards.' However, for all the problems, as the social audits of the programme have shown, NREGA is an
invaluable initiative that needs to be stabilised, strengthened, and taken forward. Indeed, in consonance with the Right to Information Act, this has the
potential to make a real difference to the lives of the rural poor.

Gamble does not pay off

It has been evident for a long time now that the Iraq policy of the United States has been a calamitous failure. President George Bush's attempt to reverse
the trend by despatching 30,000 troops to augment the occupation force was a desperate throw of the dice. This gamble has not paid off even though the

U.S. and its fast-dwindling cohort of allies have been able to put some sort of lid on the insurgency over the past month or so. While attacks on the foreign
troops and Iraqi civilians have not stopped, the impression gathered from media reports is that the levels of violence over the last few weeks have been
low compared with the earlier part of the year. However, there was never any doubt that success in military terms would be meaningless unless followed
up with political action, specifically an attempt by the Shia-dominated government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to reconcile with the disgruntled
Sunnis. The Maliki regime, which has made no serious effort to do this, is unlikely to do anything different in future. The Shia take on the situation
was lucidly brought out in a recent New York Times article by a group of Non-Commissioned Officers of the U.S. army. In their analysis, Iraq  217;s majority
community regarded the invasion as a process that would enable it to attain ascendancy; goal accomplished, it now wants to consolidate. In such a context,
the sergeants write, the Shias are not going to come to an accommodation with the Sunnis because &quot;reconciliation without consolidation risks losing it
all.&quot;

With Mr. Maliki not sticking to the occupation political script, several American politicians have pressed the Bush administration to work for his replacement.
It is conceivable that the civilian component of the occupation machinery can achieve the purpose by engineering defections from the ruling coalition but
such an intervention will derail the 'democratisation project' Mr. Bush is supposed to be promoting. Worse, it will almost certainly provoke a Shia backlash.
As it is, the political factions closely aligned with Mr. Maliki are agitated over the U.S. decision to provide arms to Sunni groups in Anbar province.
These newly minted militias have been quite active in the operations against the non-Iraqi jihadists who claim to be part of the insurgency. However, these
Sunni groups have fought in their own interest and not on behalf of the government. In short, the occupation forces appear to be barely holding back two
antagonistic, heavily armed communities who will go for each other's throats once the restraints are removed.

The miracle of faith

Navin Chawla

&quot;The work goes on,&quot; Mother Teresa answered when asked what would happen to the Missionaries of Charity after her death. &quot;As long as we remain committed
to the poorest of the poor and do not end up serving the rich, the work will prosper.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----

Once described as a 'religious imperialist' and more commonly regarded as a saint, Mother Teresa was at many levels a very ordinary woman, yet someone who
led one of the most extraordinary lives of her century. Armed only with an abundance of faith, she proceeded one small step at a time. By the time she
passed away 10 years ago, she had established a multinational organisation in over 123 countries that served her special constituency of destitution: the
aband oned, homeless, hungry, and dying. In the process, she became one of the world's principal conscience keepers.

Although she herself remained staunchly Catholic, her brand of religion was not exclusive. Convinced that each person she ministered to was Christ in suffering,
she reached out to people of all faiths. The very faith that sustained her infuriated her detractors, who saw her as a symbol of a right-wing conspiracy
and, worse, the principal mouthpiece of the Vatican's well-known views against abortion. Interestingly, such criticism was largely unnoticed in India,
where there has always been great reverence for holiness, and where people admired and respected her irrespective of her faith or their own.

My first meeting with Mother Teresa, in 1975, left the experience indelibly printed on my mind. That morning I had accompanied Delhi's Lieutenant Governor,
with whom I was then attached, to her home for the destitute. I was taken aback when I came face to face with her. She was smaller than I had imagined,
dressed in a spotless, hand-woven sari that was neatly darned in several places. Her back even then was bent. I noticed that her feet were twisted and
her hands were gnarled, testimony to her arduous life in the streets and slums.

Her words moved me profoundly. She spoke of simple things, of loving, caring and sharing. She seemed at many levels a very ordinary woman. Yet she was a
powerful communicator and reached straight into the heart of those who were listening to her. Within a short while I realised that she was no different
from those she served, for she and her Sisters seemed to be as poor as those surrounding us.

About two weeks later there was a knock on my door. It was Mother Teresa. She was there to petition the Lieutenant Governor. She spoke to him about the
stigma that the leprosy affected faced. If she could be given a little land, she could build a centre to house, treat, and rehabilitate them. Before she
left that morning she had secured his approval for ten acres of land!

She was an excellent administrator. She had the unerring instinct of realising who could help her in her task in the shortest possible time. For she had
little time to waste. She was always well organised. When she started her first little school in 1948, she had no help, no companion, no money. But that
didn't deter her from going to the slum adjoining the Loreto Convent, where she had taught for 17 years as a teacher, then the Principal, now to teach
the children there who had no access to a school. She simply picked up a stick and wrote out the letters of the Bengali alphabet on the ground. Gradually
more children gathered around her, followed by their parents. People recognised goodness where they saw it; someone contributed a chair, another a blackboard.
The Loreto teachers volunteered to teach. Soon her little school became a reality.

Many years later but in much the same spirit, she wanted to start a soup kitchen in North London. The bishop offered her a derelict church. The Sisters
went from shop to shop in the neighbourhood to beg for vegetables and food. Within a week shopkeepers themselves came forward to offer their surplus. On
an average day the Sisters fed 500 of London's poorest their only hot meal of the day.

The biography I wrote on Mother was a complete accident. I had known her for a number of years and helped her with her concerns in Delhi. In all that time
it never struck me to write a book. One day when we were in conversation she said something enormously funny and we both laughed. It was then that I remarked
that none of the books that I had read about her had brought out that side of her personality. Perhaps I should write a book, I said. She was not inclined
to agree: &quot;So many books have already been written.&quot; I blurted out: &quot;Why,
