Well, that was about it.
I took the Buell to the HOG chapter meeting and wound up taking it home
after, to get my Harley. I was afraid that I would also fuck up the brake in
as I seriously wanted to keep up with the group but the Uly's manual
suggests 2500 RPM for the first 100 miles, that = 50 MPH in 5th gear. Then
way up to 3500 RPM for the rest of the first 500 miles. The bike had 38
miles on it when we began. So, I left Cat a message on her phone and fetched
another bike. In the meantime, I don't know if I've ever mentioned this here
but, Cat really can't ride. She never rides nor listens to anyone or pays
any attention to any of the instructional videos I've brought home. So, I
wasn't there when she careened out of control and almost ran into the rear
of the group. She said she jumped off the bike instead of trying to control
her motorcycle in a sudden stop. You see, Cat has a BAD habit of putting
both her feet down when she's stopping, taking her foot of her rear brake
and then sort of accelerating while she grabs the front brake.
So, of course, the bike went down. Luckily, it didn't hit anyone and cat was
okay. I showed up at the restaurant just about 15 minutes or so late. She
was livid. It was the "groups fault" and then it was "my fault", because I
wasn't there. I was very concerned about her physical condition, but that
didn't matter. She was pissed that she dropped her bike in public.  The
group, in general, was very demeaning to Cat and then to myself. This
started to upset me.
When I arrived at the destination, the so called the so called "Safety
Officer" suggested I take a beginning rider's chapter ride.

It seems, because I was braking in the new Buell at 55mph, keeping it under
2500 RPM, on the Golden State Freeway, one of their veteran Neanderthals,
who blew past me, with his buddy, at about 90MPH, told Cat and the "Safety
Officer" that I didn't know how to ride and insinuated that I must have
crashed before the first stop. This was before Cat got the phone message
that I was taking the Buell home. Nice touch.
After 31 years and probably a half a million or so miles in a saddle, that
ignorant suggestion really set me off.
Then the so called "Safety Officer" invited me to sit with him and his
Neanderthal buddies to chat about the proper way to ride in a group, during
lunch. I declined saying that I didn't want to get into any fights, on a
lovely day like this.

Cat and I went on without the group. The "official" Glendale HOG Chapter
ride stops at whatever restaurant their destination is. This being that the
chapter doesn't want to be responsible for the riding after the heavy
drinking that goes on at the luncheon.
That doesn't mean that they don't ride home together after the drinking. So,
we went on alone. I watched Cat for awhile and then pointed out that she
wasn't braking right, because of the feet thing. She started screaming at me
saying that she rides the freeway okay and I don't know what I'm talking
about. The crash wasn't her fault it was the groups. So, my reaction was to
tell her that, "You don't know how to ride and that I'm afraid for your
safety". I then told her that she should sell her Sportster before she gets
seriously hurt or killed (I'm deadly serious about my last statement. She
really scares me and I don't know what I would say to her family when she
gets into a serious accident).

Then, as she paddled her Sportster into a 3 point U-Turn, I did several
small donuts, about half the size of her paddling U-turn, on my Deuce. Yet
another smart move on my part.

Anyway, she say's she'll never ride with another group or with me. That
she's a good rider, if she's by herself. My brilliant reply was "Boy it's
strange how someone could think their such a great rider and yet never
ride". I was really on it today. I rode home alone and now I'm heading for
the couch.

By the way, when she arrived home I was in the garage. She almost crashed
into my bikes saying "see it happened again!". I said, so it's the bikes
fault now? She said "Yes! I just can't seen to stop the Sportster, I was
fine with my Shadow".  The Sportster has a big disc in the front and a small
disc in the back. Good brakes. The Shadow had a tiny disc on the front and
an unbelievably tiny drum on the back. Dangerous brakes, for sure.

So It's off to the couch now. Thanks for listening.

Remind us what the reason for selling the Shadow was.  Was it your
idea or hers to get the Sportster?

Women have some strange ideas about bikes... and it's not good to try
to reason with them.

No kidding.  Mine actually really like that Honda Ruckas thing for some
reason.  Looks like a Tote-Goat to me.

Then I read of the woman at BMW, Dorit Rupe, who was behind that ugly G 650
X thing of theirs in this month's "Friction Zone."

Yep.  Don't try to reason with them.  Doesn't work and you won't win.  You
just need to learn to speak whatever language it is they speak.  I still
haven't learned what it is.

....and it is always "Your fault."

hmmm...?

Wonder if there is a market for a device where we could just press a button
and it would respond for us?

Needs to be light enough or have a soft cushion to prevent injury.

Maybe some sort of safety device to prevent female intervention - like
hammer blows?

opps...  "I'm coming dear!"

Oh, how come they can say "I told you so," but we can't?

I liked the one time where I told her "You might want to put your jacket on
"because it's gonna get real cold."  In her stubborn mode she snipped, "No.
I'm not cold.  I want to get a bit of a tan on my arms."   Once we got off
the bike around Lodgepole, coming from Wisonia in Sequoia National Park, her
snot was dripping and frozen.  Still refused to admit she was cold - and
maybe even wrong - but remained pissed the rest of the evening about it.  I
wanted to say "I told you so" but kept my mouth shut.

Still, that too was "My fault."  Go figger.

What Cat will do is refuse to wear a jacket and then start whining about how
cold it is. Or insist on wearing Winter gear and then complain about how hot
it was.

The funniest story about obstinate women I can recall happened several years
ago. I had a "visitor" whom I had met in New York. We were driving to Avila
Beach. I had already discovered that she was an impossible person. So, I
kept asking her if she needed to go to the bathroom, before we left Ventura.
No sooner did we leave the city limits that she started complaining that she
needed to go to the bathroom. The only facilities close by was at Emma Wood
State Beach. I KNEW that the port o' potties were disgustingly vile there
( which is why I kept asking her if she needed to go earlier).

I told her we would have to wait until we hit Seacliff or Carpenteria and
she started whining and complaining at fever pitch. Oooooookay, said I, and
I pulled off at Emma Wood. Man, you should have heard her shreaking at the
conditions of the bathrooms. I just told her "take it or leave it, it's your
choice". She took it and complained about it for the rest of the trip.

Man I couldn't WAIT to get that bitch back on the airplane for New York. And
yet, when I met her, I thought I was in love.

Note - when they do ( or imagine they do ), it will often be
followed by, as you say, the basic 'smack in the head', and often the
dreaded long silent pout followed by 'You don't love me anymore !'.

At this point, your only alternative is to organize an
emergency poker &amp; beer night.  At a friend's house.

This will spare you having to listen to the anguished screams

Altogether, not an encouraging day.

It's probably not too much consolation, but I've frequently seen
people -including several who were close to me-  display similar
responsibility-ducking behavior. The classic was my then-girlfriend who
crashed my van to the tune of $1,700 the first time I let her borrow it, and
then informed me that it was my fault, saying,  "Well, you never let me use
it before, so you should have known that I didn't know how to drive it". She
refused to help with the cost of the repairs on the same grounds.

We no longer see each other.

?? Are you to blame for everything!? have you told her family she can't
ride for shit and your'e worried? I imagine that would go down like a
lead balloon with Cat. maybe that will solve the 'while we are still
together' part as well.  :)

Is she too proud to admit she's having trouble or is she just so
stubborn she won't accept help. I think it's time she grew up and
realised there is a difference between being 'picked on' and
constructive criticism, especially when it comes to life and death
situations on a bike!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Well, that was about it.
&gt; I took the Buell to the HOG chapter meeting and wound up taking it home
&gt; after, to get my Harley. I was afraid that I would also fuck up the brake
&gt; in as I seriously wanted to keep up with the group but the Uly's manual
&gt; suggests 2500 RPM for the first 100 miles, that = 50 MPH in 5th gear. Then
&gt; way up to 3500 RPM for the rest of the first 500 miles. The bike had 38
&gt; miles on it when we began. So, I left Cat a message on her phone and
&gt; fetched another bike. In the meantime, I don't know if I've ever mentioned
&gt; this here but, Cat really can't ride. She never rides nor listens to
&gt; anyone or pays any attention to any of the instructional videos I've
&gt; brought home. So, I wasn't there when she careened out of control and
&gt; almost ran into the rear of the group. She said she jumped off the bike
&gt; instead of trying to control her motorcycle in a sudden stop. You see, Cat
&gt; has a BAD habit of putting both her feet down when she's stopping, taking
&gt; her foot of her rear brake and then sort of accelerating while she grabs
&gt; the front brake.
&gt; So, of course, the bike went down. Luckily, it didn't hit anyone and cat
&gt; was okay. I showed up at the restaurant just about 15 minutes or so late.
&gt; She was livid. It was the &quot;groups fault&quot; and then it was &quot;my fault&quot;,
&gt; because I wasn't there. I was very concerned about her physical condition,
&gt; but that didn't matter. She was pissed that she dropped her bike in
&gt; public.  The group, in general, was very demeaning to Cat and then to
&gt; myself. This started to upset me.
&gt; When I arrived at the destination, the so called the so called &quot;Safety
&gt; Officer&quot; suggested I take a beginning rider's chapter ride.

&gt; It seems, because I was braking in the new Buell at 55mph, keeping it
&gt; under 2500 RPM, on the Golden State Freeway, one of their veteran
&gt; Neanderthals, who blew past me, with his buddy, at about 90MPH, told Cat
&gt; and the &quot;Safety Officer&quot; that I didn't know how to ride and insinuated
&gt; that I must have crashed before the first stop. This was before Cat got
&gt; the phone message that I was taking the Buell home. Nice touch.
&gt; After 31 years and probably a half a million or so miles in a saddle, that
&gt; ignorant suggestion really set me off.
">

Isn't this the problem with ALL clubs Thumper? Personally, I fucking HATE
clubs more than  I hate Plod, coz at least Plod is doing something useful.

Clubs always generate "experts" and as we all know what an expert is. "Ex"
as in "has-been" and "spurt" as in "drip under pressure" so they're no more
use to you than a chocolate fireguard is to safety. And if the club doesn't
have its expert, it'll have its wannabee expert and hes even worse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then the so called &quot;Safety Officer&quot; invited me to sit with him and his
&gt; Neanderthal buddies to chat about the proper way to ride in a group,
&gt; during lunch. I declined saying that I didn't want to get into any fights,
&gt; on a lovely day like this.
">

Group therapy? What the fuck next, are they going to suggest they TEST your
riding ability by following you and commentng on your riding by fucking
radio? Sound like a REAL bunch of cunts to me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Cat and I went on without the group. The &quot;official&quot; Glendale HOG Chapter
&gt; ride stops at whatever restaurant their destination is. This being that
&gt; the chapter doesn't want to be responsible for the riding after the heavy
&gt; drinking that goes on at the luncheon.
&gt; That doesn't mean that they don't ride home together after the drinking.
&gt; So, we went on alone. I watched Cat for awhile and then pointed out that
&gt; she wasn't braking right, because of the feet thing. She started screaming
&gt; at me saying that she rides the freeway okay and I don't know what I'm
&gt; talking about.
">

Well if you're going to take on a woman and dare to critisise, you're
digging your own grave and providing the shovel to do it with :-)

The crash wasn't her fault it was the groups. So, my reaction was to

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; tell her that, &quot;You don't know how to ride and that I'm afraid for your
&gt; safety&quot;. I then told her that she should sell her Sportster before she
&gt; gets seriously hurt or killed (I'm deadly serious about my last statement.
&gt; She really scares me and I don't know what I would say to her family when
&gt; she gets into a serious accident).
">

You'd be to blame and you know it. I haven't got a CLUE how to address this
problem though. My missus doesn't want to ride, saying she's more than happy
to ride pillion.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Then, as she paddled her Sportster into a 3 point U-Turn, I did several
&gt; small donuts, about half the size of her paddling U-turn, on my Deuce. Yet
&gt; another smart move on my part.
">

You really want a smack from her, don't you? :-)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyway, she say's she'll never ride with another group or with me. That
&gt; she's a good rider, if she's by herself. My brilliant reply was &quot;Boy it's
&gt; strange how someone could think their such a great rider and yet never
&gt; ride&quot;. I was really on it today. I rode home alone and now I'm heading for
&gt; the couch.
">

Better that than the morgue, which is DEFINITELY where you'd have been
heading if you hadn't gotten outta Dodge.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; By the way, when she arrived home I was in the garage. She almost crashed
&gt; into my bikes saying &quot;see it happened again!&quot;. I said, so it's the bikes
&gt; fault now? She said &quot;Yes! I just can't seen to stop the Sportster, I was
&gt; fine with my Shadow&quot;.  The Sportster has a big disc in the front and a
&gt; small disc in the back. Good brakes. The Shadow had a tiny disc on the
&gt; front and an unbelievably tiny drum on the back. Dangerous brakes, for
&gt; sure.

But you're making another mistake here, you're using LOGIC.

She is unskilled at decoupling the front brake and throttle input.  It

Some riders will forcefully roll their right thumb up under the throttle
grip as their fingers make a stab for the brake lever. As you would expect,
this causes the bike to suddenly lunge forwards just when you want it to be
decelerating.

On that note, buy lots of insurance.

Tell her (in a non motorcycling environment) how stubborn she is, how

I tried to get her to ride a scooter but she says she would be

thought about getting a Honda Ruckus for fun)

My wife rides the EX250 and she wants a scooter, too.  I'm keeping a
non-running Vespa Ciao moped in the garage as a buffer device to
prevent the purchase of an actual scooter.
