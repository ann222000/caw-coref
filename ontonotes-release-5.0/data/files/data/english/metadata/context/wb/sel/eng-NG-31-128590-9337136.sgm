MINING THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO. -- NICANDER NUCIUS, about the middle of the sixteenth century, made the tour of Europe; and his travels, written in Greek, may be read in manuscript in the Bodleian Library.  He tells us that he visited the coal mines near Liege: -- &quot;In this city (says he) and all the neighbouring country, they are accustomed to burn a certain black substance, stony and shining, and producing hot embers without smoke.  But when the coal has been consumed, it yields no cinders, but a very fine dust is scattered through the air.  These stones they dig out of the deepest recesses of the earth, finding certain veins from which they extract them; but a peculiar prodigy takes place when they are being dug out.  For the miners are accustomed to excavate, a distance of eight or more stadia from the city, below the river, about thirty cubits of more.  When they meet with this mineral, they form a spacious cavern; But they are not able to throw out the stones immediately, for a fire all of a sudden bursts forth, and encompasses the whole cavern.  When the miners are desirous of extracting the coal, they put on a linen garment, which has neither been bleached nor dipped in water.  This covers them from head to foot, leaving only certain apertures for the eyes, that they may be able to see through them; they also take a staff in their hands, which serves to guide and direct their steps in the passage leading to the cave.  The miner then draws near to the fire, and frightens it with his staff.  The fire then flies away, and contracts itself by little and little.  Having then expended itself, it collects itself together in a surprising manner, and becoming very small remains quite still in a corner.  But it behoves the man who wears the linen garment to stand over the flame when at rest, always terrifying it with his staff.  Whilst he performs this service, the miner extracts the stones; but as soon as they have left the cave, the dormant fire all of a sudden bursts forth, and environs the whole cave.  No one then ventures to enter without the above mentioned garment and staff, for he would inevitably be consumed.  And this we ourselves have beheld; for we were desirous to ascertain the fact by actual experience, being admirers of the operations of Nature.&quot;
