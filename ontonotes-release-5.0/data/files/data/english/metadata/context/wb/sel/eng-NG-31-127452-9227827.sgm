THAILAND: TITV shift to cost B4bn in lost revenues
With only four commercial television stations left, advertisers will also be
affected by rising airtime rates

TITV and its producers may lose up to four billion baht in annual revenues once
the station changes to a public broadcaster, said Tripop Limpapath, a prominent
television host.
Khunying Dhipavadee Meksawan, the PM's Office minister, said this week that
TITV, formerly known as iTV, would likely be made ad-free from early next year
and eventually be transformed into a fully public TV station.
On Wednesday, the National Legislative Assembly (NLA) passed the Public
Television Bill, transforming TITV into an ad-free public broadcaster. The bill
may take effect after being published in the Royal Gazette in the next couple of
months. Operating costs would be subsidised from alcohol and cigarette taxes.
But Mr Tripop, a TV producer for TITV, said existing programme producers would
have difficulty transitioning to other stations by the deadline. Some producers
may be able to produce programmes for public TV.
&quot;Starting in January is too soon, I think. I'm wondering whether the office and
the staff are ready for that. If not, the programmes might disappear from the
screen,&quot; said Mr Tripop.
Meanwhile, advertising experts have predicted that the loss of TITV as a
commercial TV station would change the ad industry's competitive landscape next
year. The change would result in only four commercial stations remaining in
operation -- Channels 3, 5, 7 and 9.
Wannee Ruttanapaphon, the chairman of Initiative, a media buyer, said her
company was informed that Channel 3, operated by BEC World Plc, planned to
increase airtime fees by 7% in January.
Mrs Wannee said that other TV channels might follow Channel 3. Meanwhile, TV
operators might increase air-time fees for TV producers. These costs would be
passed on to sponsors.
&quot;You will see big media inflation next year,&quot; she predicted.
To cope with the rising cost of media spending, she said agencies would move to
integrated marketing communication. Meanwhile, other media outlets might receive
windfalls too.
&quot;Basically, if supply falls, demand should increase,&quot; said Surin
Krittayaphongphun, vice-president for marketing and sales, BEC World Plc.

THAILAND: Turmoil at TITV
Employees worry about the future of their jobs and the station's programming
under constrained budget

Staff are in shock after the NLA passed a bill which forces the station to
become a public broadcaster -- but provides no budget to produce programmes or
to pay a probably reduced number of employees.
The passage of the bill to transform TITV into a public television broadcaster
was another bombshell for the embattled TV station's staff, who said they were
now &quot;very confused and insecure&quot;. &quot;The National Legislative Assembly made the
decision [to pass the bill] without concern about the plight of staff,&quot; said a
member of the TITV news staff, who has been working with the station for 10
years.
Although the move did not affect staff as much as when the Office of the Prime
Minister seized the broadcasting concession of its predecessor iTV earlier this
year, the passage of the bill had badly demoralised the employees, she said.
In March the PM's Office seized iTV's broadcasting concession after the station
failed to pay fees and fines amounting to 103 billion baht for violating its
contract on programme content.
&quot;We have been kept in the dark. We don't know anything about the future of the
TV station. We don't even know who our boss is now,&quot; said the senior reporter.
Staff members also doubt that running a public television broadcaster is
practical as producing and broadcasting quality programmes and news coverage
costs a lot of money.
&quot;We are not sure if the government could shoulder the cost. I'm afraid that the
new Thai Public Broadcasting Service (TPBS) won't work as the pro-public
television group has imagined because of budget constraints,&quot; she said.
Jom Phetpradap, a moderator on TITV's Tua Jing Chad Jen news talk programme,
said he agreed with the establishment of public television; however, the scheme
must take into account the adverse impact on staff members. &quot;How can we protect
the public interest when we can't even protect ourselves?&quot; he said.
&quot;In the next two months, the broadcaster will no longer have income from
commercials and no one knows where the station will get money [to run the
station and pay salaries] because the allocation of state budgets to run this
new public television is a lengthy procedure.&quot;
Mr Jom said all staff had to sign resignation letters in order to re-apply for
positions with a five-member committee to be set up by the cabinet to oversee
the television station during the six-month transition period.
He also questioned the transparency of the committee, saying they could
intervene in the management of TITV in the transition period.
A massive change to TITV's content was expected during the next six months due
to a lack of management and programming policy, sources of budget and equipment.
&quot;In the worst case scenario, the government will have to borrow some programmes
from Channel 11 to run on TITV, but I doubt if those programmes are of good
quality,&quot; he said.
TITV staff said they will wait for clarification from the government over the
future of the organisation before making any moves.
Prime Minister's Office Minister Dhipavadee Meksawan yesterday urged TITV staff
who faced losing their jobs after the conversion period to consider it a process
of life.
&quot;Of course the staff are worried, but I'd like to advise that they take this as
a process of life,&quot; she said.
Khunying Dhipavadee said the TPBS station will recruit staff and it is
impossible to say if all TITV staff would be recruited to work for the new
station.
According to Khunying Dhipavadee, a policy board will be set up to oversee the
station's operations, including its programming.
