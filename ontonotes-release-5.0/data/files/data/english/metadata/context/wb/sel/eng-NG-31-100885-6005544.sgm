Sorry if this is the wrong group to post this in, but our pet rabbit R.D.
(short for Roger Dodger) hasn't pooped in two days and I have some
questions about getting him "going" again.  First, how long should we wait
before taking action?  We gave him some Ex-Lax, but he still doesn't seem
to be responding.  So next we jury-rigged an enema out of an old water can
and some thin flexible tubing, but we were wondering what's w good amount
to give him.  Also, should we warm the water first?  And should we add
anything to it first (like, I don't know, salt)?  Finally, how long should
we wait between enemas if the first one doesn't take?

Thanks to anyone who can help.

If you are real, please call a rabbit-savvy vet immediately.

Human treatments are highly inappropriate for a bunny.

Can you recommend any in the Taylor, Nebraska, area?  R.D. seems to be
losing his appetite now.

Question
hi, i know this is an issue that needs to be addressed by a vet and i
am working with an exotics vet, but i thought that i might look for
another opinion as well...my 3 year old Dutch rabbit, Harley,
appeared
to be sick on friday, he wasnt really moving [he is usually quite
active], just kind of 'huddling'...i noticed that he hadnt used the
litterbox since i had changed it the day before...i couldnt get him
to
eat, i did get him to drink a little bit, but then he quit that,
too...the next day there was no change so i brought him to the vet
that
i mentioned earlier...his temp, weight, etc. were all normal...the
vet
gave me an antibiotic (bactrim?), some banamine, and some reglan, as
well as some syringe-feeding mix...that afternoon he passed a very
small amt. of "beans", but that was the only time and it has been
almost 4 days now...we syringe fed him some mix, but he wouldnt take
much...last night i finally got him to eat some 'leafy greens' and he
has been eating those since last night, and i got some pedialyte into
him as per the vet's suggestion, but he won't eat anything other than
his piles of lettuce and he still isnt really drinking much...he has
much more energy, though, so he must be getting some nutrition in...i
am taking him back to the vet this afternoon for further assistance,
but i thought i might ask if you had any ideas/suggestions to
contribute...

i almost forgot, monday night i think it was, Harley was cleaning his
under areas a lot, and this little chunk [sorry, thats the only way i
can describe it] fell onto the floor of the cage...turns out it was 1
little 'bean' in a little pile of sticky, gummy white stuff with some
pine shavings [his litter box has pine shavings, he has always been
on
it since he was a baby] stuck to it, i guess it came out of his
butt...

im sorry for this bizarre question, im at my wit's end here!! i just
want my healthy little bunny back...=(

p.s. he is a house rabbit, he lives in my bedroom in a dog kennel
cage
about 3 feet long...has a litter box with pine shavings in it, eats
timothy hay and Small World rabbit pellets, and runs around in a
little
pen in the middle of my floor for exercise...

Answer
Dear Jen,

Your question is not bizarre, and your bunny's condition
is--unfortunately--not all that uncommon.  It is technically known as
ileus, and you can read more about it and how to treat it here:

www.bio.miami.edu/hare/ileus.html

If you think your vet might be interested in an article on this
condition that appeared in Exotic DVM Magazine, please print the
following for him:

www.bio.miami.edu/hare/ileus.pdf

The white "gunk" you saw might have been mucus, and the fact that it
was white indicates that he is still not eating enough to pass normal
feces.  The article above gives further procedures you can use to get
his intestines moving normally again.  Of primary importance are:

1.  Banamine for pain
2.  Reglan and/or cisapride for intestinal motility
3.  Pediatric simethicone for gas pain
4.  Gentle abdominal massage (this is perhaps the *most* important
thing, and the article explains the right way to do this, so please
be
*sure* to read the article completely!)
5.  Force feeding (Critical Care from Oxbow Hay Company is best:
www.oxbowhay.com )

The problem here is that ileus is not in itself a primary disease
condition.  It is a reaction to pain/stress/illness.  It could be
that
a simple bout of gas caused this, but if it becomes chronic, you need
to check his diet:

www.bio.miami.edu/hare/feeding.html

and also make sure his molars are not causing painful problems:

www.bio.miami.edu/hare/dental.html

Diet too low in crude fiber and dental problems are probably the two
most common causes if ileus in rabbits.

I hope this helps get you started.  Please write back if you have any
other questions.  Hope your boy starts to feel better soon!

Another case on poop

http://en.allexperts.com/q/Rabbits-703/GI-Stasis-French-Lop.htm

Expert: Dana Krempels, Ph.D.
Date: 2/19/2007
Subject: GI Stasis in French Lop

Question
Hi Dana,
First of all I want to thank you for writing the article
"Gastrointestinal Stasis, the Silent Killer". It has given us
direction and much needed hope this weekend!!

We have a 4 year old, 14lb French Lop named Chester. He is a house
rabbit and very important family member. Chester has progressively
been getting sicker (lots of little pellets mixed in with big ones)
since about September and has had repeated trips to the vet with no
permanent solution. Our vet has experience with smaller rabbits but
Chester is the biggest bunny that they see and they have said that he
is testing their knowledge in this area.

In January Chester was x-rayed and a large, dried mass of pellets was
found in his cecum. He was given fluids and enemas by the vet for the
first week. We took him to the vet in the morning and brought him home
at night. He seemed to get better and returned to eating and helping
me get his veggies out of the fridge. However, the problem kept
returning and he would start straining again to poop and dribbling
pee. He would end up back to the vet for help.

About 1 month ago his vet thought that the reason he was having
trouble pooping was because he had lost motility and that the
intestine was stretched due to the large mass that had been there. She
taught us how to give him an enema and suggested we give him 50cc's of
water, in an enema, once a day to see if we could keep things moving
and reduce the size of the intestine.

Chester developed urine burn because he was dribbling pee when he
strained. Two weeks ago I asked them to shave his bum because it was
always wet and hard to keep clean. They thought he would take care of
this himself as the situation improved. However this did not happen.
His weight has gone from 14lbs to 10.5lbs.

On Friday, I took him back to the vet and insisted that they shave his
bum and check for a mass because he was still straining to poop and
dribbling pee. They shaved him and we were able to treat the urine
scald with ointment. However, subsequent to that he completely stopped
pooping, eating, drinking and urine was only sporadic. They advised us
that there was no permanent solution because he could not seem to
regain motility himself and that it was time to make a decision
regarding euthanasia.

At this point we decided to do more research and to bring him home as
we felt the vet had exhausted their knowledge regarding his case.
That's when I discovered your article.

Through Saturday and Sunday (February 18 &amp; 19, 2007) we have attempted
the following after showing your article to the vet and advising they
that we would like to try this before making any decision:

- Simethicone for gas: Pediatric Ovol drops .75 ml, 4 times a day;
- Metacam 1.5 mg: 1 ml, twice a day;
- Cisapride 5 mg: 1.2 mls twice a day;
- Enema: 50 cc's twice a day;
- Critical Care formula

He has steadily improved over the past 2-days, becoming more alert and
interested in food. Actually, he is starving and eating loads of
veggies (organic herb mixture) and the critical care. His is drinking
water like crazy and even came to the fridge this afternoon for more
veggies. He won't touch hay yet so we made our own 'critical care
formula' (hay, parsley, water and critical care formula liquefied in a
blender). He loves this!! We added 1" of banana to one of the feedings
and he was in heaven.

So, things seem to be moving in the right direction and late today he
spent about 10 minutes eating his cecotrophs (up to now they have not
been very edible; very, very bad smelling; and he has not bothered).
He is peeing but still not really pooping. He has 1 or 2 pellets but
nothing to equal the food he has eaten.

We gave him another enema tonight but now I'm wondering if we are
giving too much water in the enema, are we giving too many enemas and
how will we know when to stop? Is this the normal course of GI Stasis
or is the vet right that he may never be able to fully poop by
himself? Where do we go from here?

I'm sorry this is so long, thanks for reading. Any advise that you
could provide would be very appreciated. I don't think any of us could
bear to lose him. When things are good for him he is a real character
and very loving.

Thanks,
Julia

Answer
Dear Julia,

I'm glad my article was some help, but Chester isn't out of the woods
until the *reason* for his chronic ileus is discovered.  In addition
to the treatments you're giving, please ask the vet about adding
lactulose, an indigestible sugar that acts as an osmotic laxative.
This will help hydrate the intestinal contents and get them moving
through the intestines.

It's not unusual to not see poops immediately once the gut starts
moving again, and the first ones you see might be goopy and even with
a bit of mucus.  But as the intestinal contents hydrate and move,
things should normalize.

It concerns me that he was straining to urinate.  Recall from the
article that ileus is a *symptom* of a health problem--not the cause.
If these vets are familiar with rabbit medicine, they would know that
you need to seek the source of pain/stress that's eliciting ileus.
And in light of the urinary episodes, I would certainly ask about
checking his urinary tract for problems, which you can read about
here:

www.bio.miami.edu/hare/urinary.html

Also, if he's being a picky eater, one of the most common of all
reasons for chronic ileus is untreated dental problems, particularly
molar spurs:

www.bio.miami.edu/hare/dental.html

Incorrect diet is another common reason, though it sounds as if this
isn't Chester's problem:

www.bio.miami.edu/hare/diet.html

I would recommend going here:

www.rabbit.org/vets

to find a good rabbit vet in your area for a second opinion.  Chester
needs a good "once over" to see *why* he's constantly suffering from
GI tract slowdown.

I don't think I'd continue this level of enema much longer, as you
*can* overhydrate that way.  The colon absorbs water, and since daily
normal intake of water for a mammal is about 90-100mg/kg per day, you
don't want to overdo (though it is helping, for the moment).

Ask about the lactulose, and about lessons on how to give him subQ
fluids at home to keep his electrolytes in balance while you rehydrate
him and get things back in order.

I hope this helps get you started.
