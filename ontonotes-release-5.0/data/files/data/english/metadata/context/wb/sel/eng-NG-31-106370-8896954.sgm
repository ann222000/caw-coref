I am creating artificial life, declares US gene pioneer
· Scientist has made synthetic chromosome
· Breakthrough could combat global warming

a.. Ed Pilkington in New York
b.. The Guardian
c.. Saturday October 6 2007
Craig Venter, the controversial DNA researcher involved in the race to decipher
the human genetic code, has built a synthetic chromosome out of laboratory
chemicals and is poised to announce the creation of the first new artificial
life form on Earth.

The announcement, which is expected within weeks and could come as early as
Monday at the annual meeting of his scientific institute in San Diego,
California, will herald a giant leap forward in the development of designer
genomes. It is certain to provoke heated debate about the ethics of creating new
species and could unlock the door to new energy sources and techniques to combat
global warming.

Mr Venter told the Guardian he thought this landmark would be &quot;a very important
philosophical step in the history of our species. We are going from reading our
genetic code to the ability to write it. That gives us the hypothetical ability
to do things never contemplated before&quot;.

The Guardian can reveal that a team of 20 top scientists assembled by Mr Venter,
led by the Nobel laureate Hamilton Smith, has already constructed a synthetic
chromosome, a feat of virtuoso bio-engineering never previously achieved. Using
lab-made chemicals, they have painstakingly stitched together a chromosome that
is 381 genes long and contains 580,000 base pairs of genetic code.

The DNA sequence is based on the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium which the team
pared down to the bare essentials needed to support life, removing a fifth of
its genetic make-up. The wholly synthetically reconstructed chromosome, which
the team have christened Mycoplasma laboratorium, has been watermarked with inks
for easy recognition.

It is then transplanted into a living bacterial cell and in the final stage of
the process it is expected to take control of the cell and in effect become a
new life form. The team of scientists has already successfully transplanted the
genome of one type of bacterium into the cell of another, effectively changing
the cell's species. Mr Venter said he was &quot;100% confident&quot; the same technique
would work for the artificially created chromosome.

The new life form will depend for its ability to replicate itself and metabolise
on the molecular machinery of the cell into which it has been injected, and in
that sense it will not be a wholly synthetic life form. However, its DNA will be
artificial, and it is the DNA that controls the cell and is credited with being
the building block of life.

Mr Venter said he had carried out an ethical review before completing the
experiment. &quot;We feel that this is good science,&quot; he said. He has further
heightened the controversy surrounding his potential breakthrough by applying
for a patent for the synthetic bacterium.

Pat Mooney, director of a Canadian bioethics organisation, ETC group, said the
move was an enormous challenge to society to debate the risks involved.
&quot;Governments, and society in general, is way behind the ball. This is a wake-up
call - what does it mean to create new life forms in a test-tube?&quot;

He said Mr Venter was creating a &quot;chassis on which you could build almost
anything. It could be a contribution to humanity such as new drugs or a huge
threat to humanity such as bio-weapons&quot;.

Mr Venter believes designer genomes have enormous positive potential if properly
regulated. In the long-term, he hopes they could lead to alternative energy
sources previously unthinkable. Bacteria could be created, he speculates, that
could help mop up excessive carbon dioxide, thus contributing to the solution to
global warming, or produce fuels such as butane or propane made entirely from
sugar.

&quot;We are not afraid to take on things that are important just because they
stimulate thinking,&quot; he said. &quot;We are dealing in big ideas. We are trying to
create a new value system for life. When dealing at this scale, you can't expect
everybody to be happy.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll be the first to say it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Creating a chromosome from DNA is not &quot;creating life&quot; as DNA is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; already alive.  The real trick would be to synthesize DNA.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Only God can create life.

&gt;&gt; And only an Übergott can create God.

&gt; God always existed.

Where?

So &quot;first cause&quot; isn't necessary to explain existence then.

So life can be created by other than your god.

Thanks for playing, better luck next time.

It looks like a reinvention of a nice quip by Terrence McKenna:

&quot;The sober men of science are saying the universe sprang from nothing for no
reason. This is the limit test for credulity! Science is saying give us one
free miracle and we'll explain the rest.&quot;

Do you understand the difference between something we don't know (how the
universe &quot;started&quot;) and something unknowable (a miracle)?

Scientists work on the former; you're satisfied with the latter.

&quot;There are known knowns. These are things we know that we know.
There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we know
we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns. There are things
we don't know we don't know. &quot;

Nice find! I knew Ventner was working on it, but I didn't know he was so
close. I can't wait for the paper to come out. Thanks for posting this.

When I went to read about this, the first source I tried claimed

Craig Venter has replicated a chromosome, a synthetic form of

his chromosome that contains more than 350 genes,

new life form.

Is Venter, like, really really REALLY short?  I suppose that could
explain his extereme over-achieving?
