No, I'm not talking about drug enforcement . . .

Has anyone else noticed, it seems a lot of pots are way out of tolerance?
Of course I don't know what the acceptable tolerance is, but I've
removed/tested several pots from car radios and found them to be 40%, 50%,
or even double what the schematics say they should be.

Now, the reason I test them in the first place is to determine if the pot is
getting badly worn.  If the carbon pad begins to wear through, the total
resistance will go up.  To test a pot, I measure the total resistance, then
I connect one end and a wiper to a VTVM and run it back and forth.  The
needle should move smoothly.  However even if the needle is smooth, and the
total resistance measures high, I open it up to take a good look.  In many
cases the carbon is indeed on its way out, but in many other cases the pad
looks like new.

Has anyone else noticed this?

I've seen a few out of spec pots but mostly bad wear spots. I've had a
few that couldn't be cleaned enough to make them work/sound right..

Yes, I've encountered this problem, too.

The most notable case was a volume pot that was about 650K Ohms, but
was shown to be 1Meg Ohms on the schematic. Mechanically, the pot was
in good shape and would have been inconvenient to replace (order a new
one and then do "surgery" to install it), so I just put a 330K Ohm
resistor in series with it to bring the volume circuit up to spec. The
loss of volume was not noticeable. In fact, the final audio amp tended
to overdrive the speaker before I implemented this repair.

Now that I think about it, this wasn't a repair. It was an
"accommodation."

A friend of mine mentioned that he had repaired scratchy pots by bending
the wiper contacts a little to the side so it would now wipe on virgin

Had to chime in on this....
yes, I see a lot of way "off spec" pots, and a lot of very worn out pots.
Tolerance seems to be ok in most cases with 50% either way.  For volume
controls in antique radios 1935+ ,  usually if too low, you load the
detector circuit down , too high and you dont get proper AVC action.

Now, on sets before 1935 where the control is in the "front end" the wrong
value can kill all volume up until the very last little bit of rotation.
This is usually caused by novices using AUDIO taper pots in this application
where linear or even reverse taper is called for.   I have these, BTW.

One of the most common ailments of carbon controls seems to be broken
elements.  Not sure why this happens.  In auto radios its surely due to the
control shaft being banged,  often in shipment.  I imagine it happened in
cars too due to something flying out of the rear seat on a fast stop or
during an accident!    Wirewound controls,  corrosion is the common cause.

I have never heard of a control being damaged from flying objects in a car.
If an object indeed hits the radio, the knob itself will prevent the shaft
from being pushed in.

However shipment is another matter.  I constantly receive radios in the mail
that are damaged, with either shafts bent over, broken, or pushed in.  As
for how they get damaged, one can blame UPS -- but I've received them from
every carrier.  The radio is simply poorly packed.  I received another one
today -- a 1960 Corvette.  Someone really spent time packing it -- wrapped
it with brown paper, had two sheets inside with information, but when I
picked up the box I felt the radio bouncing around inside.  I opened the box
to find the tuning shaft sheared off.  It is a special shaft, designed for
the wonderbar, and I doubt if the same shaft was used for anything other
than the 59-60 Corvette.  It's also the type of shaft that may be tough for
a machinist to reproduce.  This radio might not be repairable thanks to the
shaft.

In any case. with volume controls that are pushed in, I'm amazed at how many
are still repairable.  Often the fiber wafer is broken in six places, but
the carbon pad is still intact.  Many times I've carefully super-glued it
together, pieced the control back together, and fixed it.  As for broken
shafts, the brass ones can be spliced together.  I find a shaft from another
pot, cut it at a convenient place, and cut a slot in the end about 1/16"
deep.  I then cut the original shaft, measuring to ensure that the "graft"
will be the right length, and cut a similar slot in that one.  I then put
one shaft in a vise and apply heat from a torch.  When solder melts/flows, I
take a small piece of metal and push it into the slot.  Using a V-block, I
set both shafts together and apply heat.  I add solder, and press the shafts
together with a screwdriver.  With practice it gets easy.  File of the
excess and put the pot together; nobody can tell.

With fixes like this, I don't have to buy them from Mark.

Gary,
before they send any radios to you,  do you tell them to wrap it in 4 layers
of large bubble wrap?    Maybe one extra layer folded over the dial area,
too.  Not even UPS can wreck a radio wrapped in that.   Paper, peanuts and
styrofoam sheets are useless except to take up extra space.

I was repairing a Philips that had an intermittent volume control.
Opening the pot up revealed the carbon track looked just fine.

Runningan ohm meter through it, I noticed the needle jump in a couple

I had a similar pot from a scrap radio, except the shaft wasn't long
enough.  Luckily, these pots that Philips used could be dissasembeled
to individual components if your fingers are nimble enough.

I swapped the carbon track "disks" and re-assembled the pot.  It now

Stephanie,

This is something I do just about every day.  The vast majority of pots used
in car radios are made by CTS, and can be narrowed down to three or four
basic designs.  The good news for me is that most radios are here for
conversion, and thus the value of the pot is not critical -- a 10k will work
as well as a 5 meg, and even audio/linear taper can be compensated for.

It's one thing to replace a carbon wafer with another of the same size and
shape, it's even more fun to change the tone pad.  These are often attached
to a shaft housing.  I actually cut the wafer out of the housing with a
Dremel tool, do the same with the replacement, and fasten the original
housing to the new wafer using super glue.

I've also gotten good at grafting shafts together.  If a volume shaft is
broken, I can make cuts to the original and a new one, solder them together,
and once the control is back together you can't tell the difference.

It's amazing what you can do out of necessity.
