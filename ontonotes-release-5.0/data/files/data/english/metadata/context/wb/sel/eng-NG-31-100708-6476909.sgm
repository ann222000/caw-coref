Tomgram: Mike Davis on The Missing WMD - in Trucks in Iraq

By Tom Engelhardt
Created Mar 28 2007 - 9:40am

The carnage in Iraq continues, but what did anyone expect? Roadside bombs
(IEDs) take their deadly almost daily toll [1] on U.S. troops in and around
Baghdad (and adjoining provinces). Seventy-five Americans have already died
[2] in March, at least 50 of them from roadside bombs. Of course, that's a
drop in the bucket, when it comes to Iraqi casualties. The now widely
discussed Lancet study of Iraqi "excess deaths" between the invasion of
March 2003 and June 2006 offered an estimated figure of 655,000. Its
careful, door-to-door methodology was vehemently rejected by both George
Bush (not "a credible report") and Tony Blair. According to the British
Broadcasting Corporation, however, recently obtained [3] British government
documents indicate that the study's methodology was indeed sound. ("[T]he
chief scientific adviser to the Defense Ministry, Roy Anderson, described
the methods used in the study as 'robust' and 'close to best practice'. In
another document, a government official -- whose name has been blanked
out -- said 'the survey methodology used here cannot be rubbished, it is a
tried and tested way of measuring mortality in conflict zones.'")

None of this is likely to fully penetrate the mainstream in the U.S. During
the week of the fourth anniversary of the invasion of Iraq, both NBC and ABC
in their prime-time news shows typically continued to cite the figure of
60,000 for Iraqi deaths -- despite the fact that the U.N. Assistance Mission
for Iraq calculated 34,452 Iraqi deaths for 2006 alone and this is known to
be an honest undercount [4], because some bodies never make it to morgues or
hospitals and, in the embattled no-go zones of the Sunni insurgency,
official reporting of deaths is weak at best.

With the President's surge plan well underway and "encouraging signs" [5] of
progress in Baghdad already being hailed -- how long can we be encouraged on
the road to hell? -- Iraq is ever more a charnel house, a killing ground.
The latest real surge, as Mike Davis tells us below, is in car and truck
bombs [6] driven by Sunni jihadis. Last April, Davis did a unique two-part
series for this site, "The Poor Man's Air Force" [7] and "Car Bombs with
Wings," [8] which surely represented the first history of the car bomb ever
attempted. The remarkable author of Planet of Slums has now turned those two
pieces into a full-scale, history of this devastating weapon of our time in
a new book, Buda's Wagon: A Brief History of the Car Bomb [9]. Since, on
this roiling planet, the car bomb may lie in all our futures, this is simply
a book not to miss. I recommend it most highly. -- Tom

Have the Car-bombers Already Defeated the Surge? The Weapon No One Can Stop

Mike Davis

Despite heroic reassurances from both the White House and the Pentagon that
the six-week-old U.S. escalation in Baghdad and al-Anbar Province is
proceeding on course, suicide car-bombers continue to devastate Shiite and
Sunni neighborhoods, often under the noses of reinforced American patrols
and checkpoints. Indeed, February was a record month [10] for car bombings,
with at least 44 deadly explosions in Baghdad alone, and March promises to
duplicate the carnage.

Car bombs, moreover, continue to evolve in horror and lethality. In January
and March, the first chemical "dirty bomb" explosions took place using
chlorine gas, giving potential new meaning to the President's missing
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The sectarian guerrillas who claim
affiliation with "al-Qaeda in Mesopotamia" are now striking savagely, and
seemingly at will, against dissident Sunni tribes in al-Anbar province as
well as Shiite areas of Baghdad and Shiite pilgrims on the highways to the
south of the capital. With each massacre, the bombers refute Bush
administration claims that the U.S. military can "take back and secure"
Baghdad block-by-block or establish its own patrols and new, fortified
mini-bases as a realistic substitute for local self-defense militias.

On February 23rd, for instance, shortly after the beginning of the "Surge,"
a suicide truck-bomber killed 36 Sunnis in Habbaniya, west of Baghdad, after
an imam at a local mosque had denounced al-Qaeda. Ten days later, a kamikaze
driver ploughed his truck bomb into Baghdad's famed literary bazaar, the
crowded corridor of bookstores and coffee houses along Mutanabi Street [11],
incinerating at least 30 people and, perhaps, the last hopes of an Iraqi
intellectual renaissance.

On March 10th, another suicide bomber massacred 20 people in Sadr City, just
a few hundred yards away from one of the new U.S. bases. The next day, a
bomber rammed his car into flatbed truck full of Shiite pilgrims, killing
more than 30. A week later, horror exceeded itself when a car bomber
evidently used two little children as a decoy to get through a military
checkpoint, then exploded the car with the kids still in the back seat.

In a demonstration of a tactic that has proven especially deadly over the
past year, a car-bomb attack on March 23rd was coordinated with an assailant
in a suicide vest and almost killed [12] Deputy Prime Minister Salam
al-Zubaie, whose tribal alliance, the Anbar Salvation Council, has accepted
funding from the Americans and been denounced by the jihadis.

When it comes to the development of suicide vehicles, however, the most
alarming innovation has, without doubt, been the debut in January of truck
bombs carrying chlorine gas tanks rigged with explosives. Of course, "dirty
bombs," usually of the nuclear variety, have been a longtime obsession of
anti-terrorism experts (as well as the producers of TV potboilers), but the
sinister glamour of radioactive devices -- scattering deadly radiological
waste in the City of London or across midtown Manhattan -- has tended to
overshadow the far greater likelihood that bomb-makers would initially be
attracted to the cheapness and ease of combining explosives with any number
of ordinary industrial caustics and toxins.

As if to emphasize that poison-gas explosions were now part of their
standard arsenal, sectarian bombers -- identified, as usual, by the American
military as members of "al-Qaeda in Mespotamia" -- unleashed three
successive chlorine suicide-bomb attacks on March 16th against Sunni towns
outside of Falluja. The two largest attacks involved dump trucks loaded with
200-gallon chlorine tanks. Aside from the dozens wounded or killed by the
direct explosions, at least another 350 people [13] were stricken by the
yellow-green clouds of chlorine.

As in April 1915, with the first uses of chlorine gas on the Western Front
in World War I, these explosions sowed widespread panic, underlining -- as
the bombers no doubt intended -- the inability of the Americans to protect
potential allies in al-Anbar Province, the heartland of the Sunni
insurgency. (The recent discovery of stocks [14] of chlorine and nitric acid
in a Sunni neighborhood of west Baghdad will hardly assuage those fears.)

The shock waves from the March dirty bombs also rattled windows on the
Hudson River, where New York Police Department (NYPD) experts warned the
media that poor security at local chemical plants raised the danger of
copy-cat attacks using stolen ingredients. An anonymous senior official in
the department's Counter-Terrorism Bureau told Reuters [15] that "the NYPD
expected would-be attackers targeting New York to try to import the tactic."
At the same time, New Jersey's two Democratic Senators -- Robert Menendez
and Frank Lautenberg -- complained [16] that the Bush administration was
coddling the chemical industry by blocking New Jersey and other states from
implementing tougher safety regulations.

Meanwhile, back in Iraq, the chlorine clouds and the truck bombs have
deflected U.S. troops into a massive, desperate hunt for the "makeshift
car-bomb factories" that Major General William Caldwell, chief spokesman for
the Surge, claims [17] proliferate in the gritty suburbs and industrial
estates that ring Baghdad.

The image of a clandestine car-bomb industry, by the way, is rich with
irony. Baghdad's factory belt contains hundreds of state-owned and private
factories that once manufactured canned food, tiles, baby clothes, transit
buses, fertilizers, commercial glass, and the like. Since the American
invasion, however, the plants are idle, if not derelict, and their once
integrated Sunni-Shiite workforces are bunkered down, jobless, in
increasingly sectarian neighborhoods. Unemployment in greater Baghdad is
variously estimated in the 40-60% range.

It is unlikely that the current raids -- using troops who would otherwise be
securing streets and "winning hearts and minds" -- will uncover more than a
tiny fraction of the city's bomb "factories." Indeed, the car bomb -- even
more than the roadside bombs (IEDs) that are filling the Humvee junkyards --
has proven globally to be an almost invincible weapon of the ill-armed and
underfunded, as well as the one weapon of mass destruction that the Bush
administration has totally ignored. None of the American commanders in the
field in 2003-2004, much less the imperial daydreamers in neoconservative
think-tanks back in Washington, seem to have foreseen the ubiquity of its
use.

According to a national cross-sectional cluster sample survey of mortality
in Iraq since the U.S. invasion, carried out by epidemiologists at Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Iraqi physicians (organized
through Mustansiriya University in Baghdad), an estimated 78,000 Iraqis were
killed by several thousand vehicle bombings between March 2003 to June 2006.
Moreover, as I explain in my newly-published history of the car bomb, Buda's
Wagon [18], there is little hope for any technological fix or scientific
miracle that will allow reliable detection of a stolen Mercedes with 500
pounds of C-4 in the trunk or a dump truck laden with chlorine tanks and
high explosives idling in one of Baghdad's colossal traffic jams.
(Checkpoints? Just a synonym for target of opportunity.)

In the meantime, the bombers are obviously wagering that if they can sustain
current levels of carnage, the Shiite militias will be forced back onto the
streets to protect their neighborhoods (as the American troops can't [19]),
risking a bloody, all-out confrontation with U.S. forces for the ownership
of the vast Shiite slum of Sadr City and other Shiite areas in eastern
Baghdad. On the other side, Lieutenant General David Petraeus,
counterinsurgency expert and mastermind of the Surge, must shut down the
car-bombers by the beginning of the summer or face a likely popular revolt
in Sadr City. With each explosion, his chances of success diminish.
