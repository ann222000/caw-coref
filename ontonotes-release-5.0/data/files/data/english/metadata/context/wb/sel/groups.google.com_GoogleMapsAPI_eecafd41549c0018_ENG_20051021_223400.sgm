We have almost 500 members mapped and I am afraid they are lost. Here
is where this map is located.

Would appreciate any help Thanks Brian

It appears that the issue is with your XMLDoc code, specifically the
DocumentElement statement. Did you change this recently? I don't know
the XMLDoc class to help a lot, but I do know that is works perfectly
in Firefox and probably in Mozilla.

In IE I get a Error: 'documentElement' is null or not an object. I
suspect that IE doesn't like your xml document for some reason. When I
capture a copy of your xml and add a debug statement to output
xmlDoc.parseError I get the following:
XML parse error: error code -1072896760
filepos: undefined
line: 1026
linepos: 142
reason: An invalid character was found in text content.
srcText: &lt;frapper lat=&quot;44.499981&quot; long=&quot;-75.3047005&quot; loc=&quot;De Kalb
Junction (NY)&quot; name=&quot;le Glode&quot; shoutout=&quot;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Eyragues 13 sud
Avignon nord st RÃ©my...France&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&quot; mug=&quot;&amp;lt;img
src=
border=1&amp;gt;&quot; tiny=&quot;&amp;lt;img
src=
border=1 width='20'&amp;gt;&quot; /&gt;

When I remove that entry from the xml file it works in IE. I'm not
sure what the invalid character is. I leave that as an exercise for
you. It seems as if somehow that &quot;frapper&quot; (le Glode) has included a
character that IE's xml parser doesn't like.

You can also see the error (at least I can) when you load your xml file
into IE 6.0:
