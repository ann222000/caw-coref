Questions:
1. (v1-12) The account of Paul's voyage to Rome is vivid with
details.  Why does Luke know so much about the voyage?  Make a list of
the statements in these early verses that indicate first hand
experience.

2. (v1-26) how does God give Paul encouragement durig the voyage?  How
has God sustained you during tough &quot;voyages?&quot;

3.  Compare Paul's predictions in v.10 and v.21-25.  Does he
contradict himself here?  Have you ever experienced a disaster, a)
which was due to your refusal to take advice, yet b) was graciously
eased and lightened by God?

4.  Compare the response to Paul's advice in v.10 and v.30-32.  Why do
they follow his leadership at the end but not the beginning?  What
does this tell us about leadership in general?  How does Paul's
leadership save everyone's life twice (v.31-32, 42-44)?

5.  What tension is there between Paul's prediction of v.22 and his
command in v.31?  How do these two statements show the unique view of
Christianity with regards to the old &quot;fate vs. free will&quot; debate?  Why
is this view so intensely practical for our daily living?

Acts 27
Paul Sails for Rome
1When it was decided that we would sail for Italy, Paul and some
other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named Julius, who
belonged to the Imperial Regiment. 2We boarded a ship from Adramyttium
about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of Asia, and
we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was
with us.
3The next day we landed at Sidon; and Julius, in kindness to Paul,
allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs.
4From there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of Cyprus
because the winds were against us. 5When we had sailed across the open
sea off the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in
Lycia. 6There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for
Italy and put us on board. 7We made slow headway for many days and had
difficulty arriving off Cnidus. When the wind did not allow us to hold
our course, we sailed to the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone. 8We moved
along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called Fair
Havens, near the town of Lasea.

9Much time had been lost, and sailing had already become dangerous
because by now it was after the Fast.[a] So Paul warned them, 10&quot;Men,
I can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great
loss to ship and cargo, and to our own lives also.&quot; 11But the
centurion, instead of listening to what Paul said, followed the advice
of the pilot and of the owner of the ship. 12Since the harbor was
unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided that we should sail on,
hoping to reach Phoenix and winter there. This was a harbor in Crete,
facing both southwest and northwest.

The Storm
13When a gentle south wind began to blow, they thought they had
obtained what they wanted; so they weighed anchor and sailed along the
shore of Crete. 14Before very long, a wind of hurricane force, called
the &quot;northeaster,&quot; swept down from the island. 15The ship was caught
by the storm and could not head into the wind; so we gave way to it
and were driven along. 16As we passed to the lee of a small island
called Cauda, we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure. 17When
the men had hoisted it aboard, they passed ropes under the ship itself
to hold it together. Fearing that they would run aground on the
sandbars of Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be
driven along. 18We took such a violent battering from the storm that
the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard. 19On the third
day, they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.
20When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm
continued raging, we finally gave up all hope of being saved.
21After the men had gone a long time without food, Paul stood up
before them and said: &quot;Men, you should have taken my advice not to
sail from Crete; then you would have spared yourselves this damage and
loss. 22But now I urge you to keep up your courage, because not one of
you will be lost; only the ship will be destroyed. 23Last night an
angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood beside me 24and
said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand trial before Caesar; and
God has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you.' 25So
keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will happen
just as he told me. 26Nevertheless, we must run aground on some
island.&quot;

The Shipwreck
27On the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the
Adriatic[b] Sea, when about midnight the sailors sensed they were
approaching land. 28They took soundings and found that the water was a
hundred and twenty feet[c] deep. A short time later they took
soundings again and found it was ninety feet[d] deep. 29Fearing that
we would be dashed against the rocks, they dropped four anchors from
the stern and prayed for daylight. 30In an attempt to escape from the
ship, the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea, pretending they
were going to lower some anchors from the bow. 31Then Paul said to the
centurion and the soldiers, &quot;Unless these men stay with the ship, you
cannot be saved.&quot; 32So the soldiers cut the ropes that held the
lifeboat and let it fall away.
33Just before dawn Paul urged them all to eat. &quot;For the last fourteen
days,&quot; he said, &quot;you have been in constant suspense and have gone
without food-you haven't eaten anything. 34Now I urge you to take some
food. You need it to survive. Not one of you will lose a single hair
from his head.&quot; 35After he said this, he took some bread and gave
thanks to God in front of them all. Then he broke it and began to eat.
36They were all encouraged and ate some food themselves. 37Altogether
there were 276 of us on board. 38When they had eaten as much as they
wanted, they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea.

39When daylight came, they did not recognize the land, but they saw a
bay with a sandy beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if
they could. 40Cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea and
at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders. Then they
hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach. 41But the
ship struck a sandbar and ran aground. The bow stuck fast and would
not move, and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the
surf.

42The soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them
from swimming away and escaping. 43But the centurion wanted to spare
Paul's life and kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered
those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. 44The
rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship. In this way
everyone reached land in safety.
