I know a lot of people in this newsgroup are animal lovers, and some
work with the Humane Society, care for foster animals, etc. Many of you
own cats, dogs and are also several  that own horses, so tell us about
your pets..what their names are, and what they look like, and share any
interesting stories with the rest of us about your favorite pet, or
pets. Would be GREAT, if you were able to share some pictures with the
group too...we can have a photo pet parade!  :o)

Also...have you ever owned a unusual &quot;pet&quot;, like back when you were a
kid growing  up...anything different from the ordinary  kitty, puppy,
bunny, gerbil, even exotic fish, etc.. Let's hear about them, as well.

I grew up with dogs and cats, and have never been without either in my
entire life, and really can't imagine life without them. At the present
time, we have a Golden Retriever, named Nugget, who will be  5  years
old in November. He is our 4th Golden in a row, as they are such
magnificent dogs. Now that hubby and I are older and less active, we'd
like to have a small breed dog, which we have never had....any
suggestions, as to what might be a good choice?  We also have 5  very
spoiled, lovable house cats..all males. We have a black/white Tuxedo
kitty, named Torbie and two tabby brothers, named Stars &amp; Stripes..we
adopted these three as kittens from the pound 5 years ago. We also have
our big, beautiful Seal Point traditional &quot;apple-face&quot; Siamese, Shang,
who came from a breeder in Oregon, and he is 7 years old, and our 2nd
Siamese. Last, but not least is our youngest puss..a black/white
shorthair, named Oreo, who is 3 years old.  Torbie and Stars do NOT get
along at all, so that makes life chaotic at times!  :-(

I've always been horse crazy, and was given a colt when I was 15 years
old, that I named Candy, but she had been born in the woods, and was in
terrible health when I got her, and only lived a short time, despite the
many vet calls,  which broke my heart!

My parents bought a black/white Shetland pony for our kids when they
were quite young,  and  eventually Sugar died..probably of old age, but
she was a sweetheart. Our kids had a multitude of pets, including a fish
tank, ant farm, snakes (eek!) lizards, Parakeets, rabbits, and turtles,
besides the dogs and cats we had while they were growing up, and..the
pony.

I would love to hear about your pets...the ones you have now, and any
from the past, that stand out in your memory.

Right now we only have four cats:
Bear, DSH, black
Ozzy, DSH, mostly white w/random black markings
Mia, our female Torbie
Nik, our female Tabby

I grew up with animals as well - dogs, cats, birds and rabbits. My
family instilled a deep love of animals in me and I regard all animals
highly. While we had no unusual pets there are two that stand out for
me growing up. We had one rabbit, Bozo, who lived in our house. She
had been sick as a youngster and so my mother took her inside to nurse
her to health and fell in love with her so decided to keep her in as a
housepet. There was something very special about that rabbit - she was
incredibly smart and sweet - would sleep with my mother, ate pumpkin
pie and Twinkie fillings (not exclusively, but still....) and we
enjoyed her for many years.
We also had a Collie named &quot;Shadow&quot;. My mother &quot;trained&quot; him to
protect my sister and I (hence his name) and he was a wonderful friend
to us. One time he disappeared and we were all distraught. We searched
everywhere for him with no luck. So my mother got another Collie,
&quot;Albie&quot; and no sooner did we get him then who shows up, thin and
weary? Yep, &quot;Shadow&quot;. It was a miracle. He just sauntered back home
and again, my mother had to nurse him to health. So now we had two
collies who were very loved.

Holy bejeesus...

When I was a kid, I had two hamsters (freaked me out when it became 6
hamsters - one gave birth) and a parakeet named &quot;Sam&quot; (which is funny,
because that's my kid's name) that learned a few words before he died.
We also had a dog, a Boxer named Chancellor (&quot;Chance&quot;) that I spent the
first 14 years of my life with. He was a great dog. Loved chasing cop
cars. No other cars, just cop cars. He'd run right up to them and start
biting the tires. Like I said, he was a great dog. :)

In my twenties, my gf at the time and I had a scorpion we kept in a
little cage on the nightstand. We'd let him out every once in a while,
but not much. A friend who I lived with around that time had a 13'
reticulated python and two tarantulas. The snake was well-mannered,
unless you were walking by it with white socks on, which it always
thought was a mouse. We used to let thing have free roam of the house.
Spiders and scorpions are boring.

Nowadays, I just have my 5 year old dog Maiden. Had a cat for 15 years,
but she died this past April.

Um, you're less active, so you think a smaller dog will be a better
fit? Oh, the stories I could tell where that misconception has
backfired! ;-)

We have Longcoated German Shepherds, so we are big dog people, but
I've had and known various small breeds over the years and most of
them are higher energy dogs than people expect. Please don't get a
Jack Russell/Parson Russell Terrier, no matter how cute they are. They
need a strong hand and tons of exercise to even begin to burn off
their energy.

I have friends who have had many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and
they were developed to be lap dogs, so they may be perfect for you.
They seem a little vacant in the eyes for my taste, but one of my dogs
is half Shepherd, half Border Collie, so I'm comparing them to the
freakishly intense stare of the psycho that lives in my house.

The Cavies I know go boating and walking and are sweet tempered little
dears who love nothing more than sitting next to you with a head in
your lap.  Check them out.

Do a ton of research and make your decision based on the nature of the
breed, what job they were developed for. Many small breeds are
terriers, who were bred to hunt vermin, go down the hole and drag
badgers and such out. People are then shocked when these breeds keep
digging out under the fence and chasing their kid's hamsters.

Excellent advice.  Too many people do ZERO research and get dogs based
on looks alone and are surprised when they actually exhibit the
characteristics they were bred for!

I've had many dogs, large and small, over the years.  Rotts, Sheps,
Airedales, Schnauzers, Maltese, Daschunds, Pugs, and most recently my
dear departed Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Fred.

Being from the Border Collie/Australian Shepherd sheep herding family,
Fred was, by far, the most intelligent/observant dog I've ever known.
He studied my every move - 24/7 and always knew what I was going to do
next, even before I did. After having a smart dog, most others pale in
comparison, unfortunately.

But...for the pure joy of couch companionship, along with portability,
nothing beats the love of a Pug. I adored both my Harriet and Olive.

Well, everybody here knows about my cat Yoda.

But the most unusual pet?  When I was a kid out in the country in New
England, I had two pet rabbits -- one jet black and the other all
white, and their names were Benedict and Arnold.  They were kept in an
outdoor pen.  But they weren't the unusual pets.  Mandy was.

One day the family went to visit relatives in a hill town 25 miles
away, an all-day trip back in the 60's.  When we got back home late in
the evening our black lab Mandy was running back and forth along the
edge of the woods that surrounded the house on 3 sides.  My father
actually acted panicked; he said later that the dog was acting so
&quot;queer&quot; that his first thought was that she had contracted rabies. But
the truth was even stranger.

Somehow Benedict and Arnold had escaped from their pen.  The way that
Mandy always sat outside the pen staring and drooling, we had always
assumed that if the bunnies ever escaped that they were just one hop
away from being a hot lunch.  But what we saw was absolutely amazing.
When we got out of the car and got closer to the edge of the yard, we
realized that both rabbits were sitting on the grass panting, 3/4 of
the way between their pen and the woods.  A moment later one of them
made a beeline hippity-hopping towards the woods.  Incredibly, Mandy
placed herself between Benedict and the woods, barking like crazy, and
drove the rabbit back into the yard.  Then she sat and waited.  As we
watched incredulously, Arnold took off hippity-hopping towards he tree
line in a different spot.  Mandy raced ahead of him, cutting him off
and barking furiously as she had done to Benedict.  Arnold hopped back
to the center of the yard waiting for another chance.

We got the rabbits back in the pen and Mandy got a nice fat bone that
evening and a whole lot of praise.  To this day my family will doesn't
understand why our Lab not only didn't eat the rabbits but actually
protected them and kept them from going into the woods.  Judging by
how exhausted and sweaty she was, she must have been &quot;herding&quot; them
for hours.  What a special, good dog!  So yes, Mandy the black lab is
the most unusual pet I ever owned.

Writing this made me long for the good old days, living in the country
where life was simple.  Didn't have to worry about keeping dogs locked
up or tied up out there, no leash laws out in the boondocks.  And they
could chase the door to door salesmen better when they were loose!

Shelters are full of dogs that weren't what owners expected and dogs
that weren't trained properly as puppies and are now large, rowdy dogs
that knock the children down.

My Shepherd, August, stares into my eyes and listens for words that he
knows, which are many. My Border Collie was a street urchin rescue who
can't seem to learn many words (I believe it has to do with early
exposure to words), but she knows that August knows words. When I talk
to him, she doesn't look at me (she doesn't know what I saying
anyway), she looks at him and when he reacts, she springs into action.
Once you've lived with the clicking wheels of that kind of brain in a
dog, it's hard to choose anything else, no matter how cute they are.

Pugs are another good choice, with more personality than a Cavalier,
IMO, but still managable for older people.

Judy, you could check out the AKC website and look at the descriptions
of some of the dogs you think you'd like to see if they might be good
possibilities.

Then talk to reputable breeders for a couple of your &quot;finalists&quot;, who
will tell you the unvarnished truth about the breed; the last thing
they want is more of their breed stuck in a shelter. A good,
responsible breeder often has a waiting list of people waiting for
their puppies, so they will not be trying to sell you anything. They
are a great resource because of that. The breeder I bought August from
directed me to the rescue that had my Shepherd/Border mix.

Once you decide on a breed or two, contact the local rescue group for
that breed and see what dogs they have. Now, a minor word of caution
here, the rescue groups are strapped for money, so obviously they want
to place dogs, so don't just rely on their description of the dog's
personality. Make sure you can take Nugget and meet the new dog and
see what happens. A good rescue shouldn't have a problem with that.

Good luck!

Great idea.
I've never had a really unusual pet: always dogs, cats and the
occasional fish.  I always seem to have &quot;memorable&quot; animals,
however.

Rotten Ralph was the world's biggest wimp of a purebred German
Shepherd.  I used to say that Ralph barked with a stutter.   He came
from a line of dogs who were bred very large, but he had no idea.
When he was a puppy, he would climb under the couch when we had a
storm.  As a grown dog, he didn't realize that his little special
place would be inaccessible, due to his size.  Didn't stop this guy.
I was sitting on the couch at the time, and he ran to hide, lifting
the couch and me up in the air.

My ex was a police officer at the time and Ralph thought all black and
white cars must be &quot;Daddy's&quot; car.  My ex and I had Ralph at the beach
one day and there was a black and white, but not from my ex's
department, just sitting there along the side of the beach.  Ralph, in
full &quot;oh boy!&quot; attitude, ran to the cop's door, jumped up on the
window and barked.  I swear that cop had a new sunroof installed that
morning.  Ex and I just wandered away, whistling and pretending we
didn't know the dog. :)

I have stories about all my animals, but Ralph's tend to be the
funniest.

I really enjoyed hearing about your 4 cats, and they obviously are loved
very much, and they sound beautiful!  You were like me and grew up
loving animals..what a neat story about Bozo the bunny and Shadow, the
Collie. I am sure GLAD to hear he did wander home again. Was his nose
out of joint, when he saw Albie there, and did they become buddies? I
really think Collie's are such gorgeous dogs! Your mom sounded like a
great lady  too, and a lot like mine, with a heart as big as all of the
outdoors!  I do think you and I were blessed growing up in that type of
environment!

I never had any &quot;fuzzy creatures&quot; while growing up, such as hamsters,

My teenage granddaughters do though.

Our first little yellow parakeet was named &quot;Tina&quot;, and  later got a blue
one, we named &quot;David&quot;. They never learned to talk, but my aunt's bird
did, and was great!  I wouldn't care to ever have a Scorpion, snake, or
Tarantula (eek!) I can't even look at those  ugly spiders at a pet
store!  :-(

What kind of dog is Maiden? Sorry you lost your kitty, after 15
years...do you plan to get another sometime? They are such GREAT pets!

How many long haired German Shepherds do you have? It sounds like you
have several dogs?  I love German Shepherds, and we did have one that
the mother was a purebred, but the father was part Shepherd and &quot;Rex&quot;
was too protective with our family, so after he bit four people, and
killed a Beagle, we had him put to sleep. A Border Collie is extremely
smart, but needs LOTS of exercise. I know small dogs are active, but
they are content to run around the house, chasing a ball, and don't have
to take them out and go on runs with them, etc. like the bigger, more
energetic breeds. My folks had Yorkies and Toy Poodles, and they were
busy, but could lay for hours in their laps. I would NEVER get a Jack
Russell, or probably any small terrier breed, as most don't care for
cats, so that wouldn't work!

We've always had big dogs....mostly hunting type dogs, which are
wonderful! Our groomer told me to look into the Cavalier King Charles
Spaniels also, but can't find any breeders near us. I'm not in any hurry

handful, but love him dearly!

I really enjoyed hearing all about your two pet rabbits, named
&quot;Benedict&quot; and &quot;Arnold&quot; and how &quot;Mandy&quot; the black Lab herded them back
from going into the woods!  Our kids had several pet rabbits, and our
dogs liked them, and was quite gentle with them.  A Lab is a GREAT dog,
but wow! those tails are a weapon! :-D They are always going 100 MPH and
they can really hurt if  you're in the way!

We have always lived in the country, and never have had to tie up a dog,
but we've used an electric fence system for our last two Goldens, and
they are super to have!

named &quot;Topsy&quot;, and later on we had another female Lab, named
&quot;Tana&quot;..both were fantastic dogs. We have also owned several purebred
Beagles, which are a great kid's dog, and fun-lovin' dogs, but they are
tramps! As I said in my original post, &quot;Nugget&quot; is our 4th Golden
Retriever and a real love. My parents raised Cockapoo's, Toy Poodles and
Yorkies, but I've never  been that crazy about the smaller breeds, but
have changed my tune. I WOULD like a Pug, but the vet told me they have
sinus problems living here in Alaska, and also problems with their eyes
popping out.

Do you feel you will eventually get another dog, to fill  your heart

&gt;Judy, you could check out the AKC
&gt; website and look at the descriptions of
&gt; some of the dogs you think you'd like to
&gt; see if they might be good possibilities.
&gt;Then talk to reputable breeders for a
&gt; couple of your &quot;finalists&quot;, who will tell
&gt; you the unvarnished truth about the
&gt; breed; the last thing they want is more
&gt; of their breed stuck in a shelter. A good,&gt; responsible breeder often
has a
&gt; waiting list of people waiting for their
&gt; puppies, so they will not be trying to sell
&gt; you anything. They are a great resource
&gt; because of that. The breeder I bought
&gt; August from directed me to the rescue
&gt; that had my Shepherd/Border mix.
&gt;Once you decide on a breed or two,
&gt; contact the local rescue group for that
&gt; breed and see what dogs they have.
&gt; Now, a minor word of caution here, the
&gt; rescue groups are strapped for money,
&gt; so obviously they want to place dogs, so
&gt; don't just rely on their description of the
&gt; dog's personality. Make sure you can
&gt; take Nugget and meet the new dog and
&gt; see what happens. A good rescue
&gt; shouldn't have a problem with that.
">

I would LOVE to have a Pug, as have researched them and know they are
&quot;people dogs&quot; and are very smart, and just a great pooch, but my hubby
thinks they are SO ugly! &lt;G&gt;

We live in a small town, and I don't think there are rescue groups here,
but they do have a no-kill shelter, and have adopted a Beagle from them,
and several cats over the years. I think Nugget would love any dog, as
he really likes  to play and is such a  big ol' clown, but the poor
thing has been raised with cats, and never had another dog for a play
buddy.

I have researched breeds of dogs online also, and in dog
magazines..won't make any snap decisions immediately, but I so thank you
for your advice, and also from the others posting in this thread...it's
been most helpful.

&gt;&gt;Um, you're less active, so you think a

&gt;&gt; stories I could tell where that
&gt;&gt; misconception has backfired! ;-)

&gt;&gt;We have Longcoated German
&gt;&gt; Shepherds, so we are big dog people,
&gt;&gt; but I've had and known various small
&gt;&gt; breeds over the years and most of them
&gt;&gt; are higher energy dogs than people
&gt;&gt; expect. Please don't get a Jack
&gt;&gt; Russell/Parson Russell Terrier, no
&gt;&gt; matter how cute they are. They need a
&gt;&gt; strong hand and tons of exercise to
&gt;&gt; even begin to burn off their energy.

&gt;&gt;I have friends who have had many
&gt;&gt; Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and they
&gt;&gt; were developed to be lap dogs, so they
&gt;&gt; may be perfect for you. They seem a
&gt;&gt; little vacant in the eyes for my taste, but
&gt;&gt; one of my dogs is half Shepherd, half
&gt;&gt; Border Collie, so I'm comparing them to
&gt;&gt; the freakishly intense stare of the
&gt;&gt; psycho that lives in my house.

&gt;How many long haired German Shepherds do you have? It sounds like you
&gt;have several dogs?  I love German Shepherds, and we did have one that
&gt;the mother was a purebred, but the father was part Shepherd and &quot;Rex&quot;
&gt;was too protective with our family, so after he bit four people, and
&gt;killed a Beagle, we had him put to sleep. A Border Collie is extremely
&gt;smart, but needs LOTS of exercise. I know small dogs are active, but
&gt;they are content to run around the house, chasing a ball, and don't have
&gt;to take them out and go on runs with them, etc. like the bigger, more
&gt;energetic breeds. My folks had Yorkies and Toy Poodles, and they were
&gt;busy, but could lay for hours in their laps. I would NEVER get a Jack
&gt;Russell, or probably any small terrier breed, as most don't care for
&gt;cats, so that wouldn't work!

&gt;We've always had big dogs....mostly hunting type dogs, which are
&gt;wonderful! Our groomer told me to look into the Cavalier King Charles
&gt;Spaniels also, but can't find any breeders near us. I'm not in any hurry

I've always loved Shepherds, but never had any growing up. We had a
pointer, a Pekapoo, and a dog that looked like a large Benji-type. I
married a man had a Longhaired Shepherd as a child that, from the way
they describe it, sounds like she spent so much time isolated with
them that she became a super-protective biter, as well.

After we got married, we went to the shelter and found a LH Shepherd
named Zeus. The light of my life. When he passed, we got a LH puppy
from a breeder and a couple of years later, we got what we were told
by the rescue was a LH Shepherd, but is really a LH Shepherd/Border
Collie mix.  Just two dogs currently.

Longhairs are quite the &quot;conversation pieces,&quot; though, because many
people have never seen them and wonder what they are. My male is very
light, mostly golden and people think he's part Collie. The hair,
though, oh, the hair.

One of my neighbors just got a Golden (I only know some of these
people through their dogs and refer to them and their houses by their
dog's name, &quot;That's where Bogart lives,&quot; &quot;Those are Ruby's people.&quot; )
and I am reminded of how much I've always adored Goldens.  I have to
agree with your husband about the pugs, though, they just aren't a
look I can go for, either.

We've had dogs - many, many, many dogs - over the years, except for a
brief period when we lived in an apartment building in Scarsdale, NY.
Once we moved to Virginia, we've had lots of horses.

My mother *hated* cats so never had a cat until I was married with a
child of my own.  Now we have 5.  Go figure.

All of our animals (except some of the horses) have been SPCA dogs and/

owners who could &quot;no longer&quot; care for them.

We kept snakes for years.  My father brought home on the train from
NYC to Chappaqua a small corn snake in a paper bag for my birthday.
Imagine if that had gotten loose?  One of the snakes was a large (6')
black snake which had been injured in a brush fire.  I can remember my
mother rubbing Noxema on his wounds every night (I'm not sure how she
came up with that treatment but it worked great).   The other was an
even larger yellow rat snake which was unable to coil properly and
more or less &quot;sat&quot; on its prey to smother it.  Ah, good times, good
times.

When we moved to Virginia in the early '70s the pet shops would not
sell us mice to feed to the snakes, so we had to give them away.

My husband recently gave me two goats with the goal of having them
clear out the brush on our property, but which I somehow suspect will
become pets, if their total cuteness is any indicator.

&gt;&gt;it always thought was a mouse. We
&gt;&gt;used to let thing have free roam of the
&gt;&gt;house. Spiders and scorpions are
&gt;&gt;boring.

&gt;&gt;Nowadays, I just have my 5 year old dog
&gt;&gt;Maiden. Had a cat for 15 years, but she

&gt; I never had any &quot;fuzzy creatures&quot; while growing up, such as hamsters,

&gt; My teenage granddaughters do though.

&gt; Our first little yellow parakeet was named &quot;Tina&quot;, and  later got a blue

&gt; did, and was great!  I wouldn't care to ever have a Scorpion, snake, or
&gt; Tarantula (eek!) I can't even look at those  ugly spiders at a pet
&gt; store!  :-(

&gt; What kind of dog is Maiden? Sorry you lost your kitty, after 15
&gt; years...do you plan to get another sometime? They are such GREAT pets!

No hurry for another cat. Cleo (the cat) was owned by a family friend
who died in 1993, right after she got Cleo. We raised her from there.

Maiden is a Rottweiler/Lab mix. Barks at everything, but smart as hell
and cute as a button. She was a Christmas gift from a friend. When I
brought her home, only her head was sticking out of may jacket's inside
pocket.

That's a really neat story, zob. It reminded me of something that
happened to us years ago but sadly the outcome was different. We had
our collie, Shadow, and used to keep many bunnies in diff cages
outside. One night I heard some real scuffling going on outside and
tried to look out the window but couldn't see anything (we lived on a
kind of isolated property that was very dark at night). The next day
we went outside to look around and found out that something had gotten
in to one of the rabbits and killed her but you could see the ground
all dug up around the house where I'd heard that noise. We figured out
that it had been our dog Shadow trying to save the bunny from whatever
was attacking her - you could tell he was really upset because he was
depressed and wouldn't eat for days. He was always so gentle with the
bunnies and I know that it wasn't him that hurt her - he was trying to
help her. So sad.

Hi Judy - yes, Shadow's noise was a bit out of joint when he saw we
had gotten another dog. One day my mother set their food dishes out
and shortly after we heard a scuffle. We ran outside only to find
Albie upside down on the ground and Shadow standing defiantly over
him. Shadow was obviously letting Albie know that HE was the king of
the roost and Albie would always be second!! He never hurt him and
they grew to like/tolerate each other.
Yes, I have always said about my mother that probably her greatest
strength is her love and care of animals. They have always meant the
world to her and she's one that always tried to help the unfortunate
or abused creatures. That's probably the best thing instilled in me
from growing up in that household. I have a great respect for animals
and do what I can to give the ones that cross my path the happiest
existence possible. They have given us so much in return that it's an
honor to love and care for them.
You sound the same way with all the pets you've given love to over the

That's so predators will think her eyes are open when she's sleeping.

Great question, Judy!  I must say, you have come up with some good
topics during this off season.

Ah, pets.  Where do I begin?  As a child, I had several cats and dogs,
plus a white bunny named Snowball and ducklings named Donald and Daisy.
who ended up in a city park, Snowball in a petting zoo, and Donald
and Daisy in a lovely pond.  My fondest memory of the ducklings was
watching them play in a pan of water on our kitchen table.  They were so
adorable.  We also had chickens (yes, in the middle of Detroit) behind
our garage.  My dad built a ladder for them to go up into the loft of
the garage to nest.  He was an organic farmer who loved his natural eggs.

Our greatest number of animals lived on our farm in Oregon.  We had a
Guernsey/Jersey mix cow named Cindy, who gave birth to her calf Easter
on...you guessed it, Easter morning!  She had full range of our 10 acres
and chose to go up into the woods that fronted our property to calve.
DH, myself, and all our kids were witnesses to that birth.  What an
amazing experience.  We also had a pig named Polly who gave birth to
eight piglets.  We managed to see almost all of them being born after
Suzanne came running from the pigpen to the house yelling, &quot;There's a
new pig in the pen and it's very little!!&quot;  Another exciting adventure
for our family.  Piglets are so cute.  One of the things they did that
had us laughing uproariously every time was, after running around and
playing with each other, they'd just flop over on their sides and fall
asleep, in an instant.  It was so comical.  We also had two adorable
kids, Cupcake and Sparky, born to our female goat Janelle, which was
given to us by a friend who couldn't care for her any longer.  Another
pet was a 23-year-old white Arab, who was no doubt a magnificent horse
in her youth but was pretty broken down by the time she was given to us.
In fact, she was so sway-backed that the kids could ride her without a
saddle!  She was very gentle and great for the kids.  We also had about
20 barn cats, fabulous mousers (well, the females, at least) who very
neatly disposed of the moles and ground squirrels on the property.  Oh,
and I can't forget the geese and the chickens, of which we had many.
And we had a sweet, little black mongrel dog named Princess and a black
and white cat named Scrapper who moved with us from Los Angeles to
Oregon.  Scrapper had the biggest ears I've ever seen on a cat and was
the best mouser I've ever known.  She would sit for an hour or more,
still as a statue, in front of a cabinet where she knew a mouse was
lurking, and as soon as the mouse ventured out, Scrapper's paw was upon
it in a nano-second!  She was truly phenomenal.  Another story about
Scrapper:  When we first moved to our farm, she ran up a very tall pine
tree.  We tried for hours to lure her back down, to no avail.  The next
morning, after a torrential rainstorm, there she was, sitting on the
ground by the tree, washing herself as if nothing had happened.
Unfortunately, both Princess and Scrapper were killed by logging trucks.
After Princess died we got a purebred German Shepherd named Autumn who
was probably the smartest dog I've ever known.  The first time I took
her walking down our road (we lived way out in the country), she started
barking and chasing a car, and I told her sternly to get in the ditch,
which she did, and ever after that, every time she heard a vehicle
coming, she automatically ran into the ditch.  She also had the most
beautiful puppies imaginable, including a pure white one.  We gave them
all away to neighbors and friends, so we knew they had good homes.

Wow, this is way too long, sorry!  Just to conclude, we now have a black
cocker/dachshund mix, Cookie.  She just turned 15 and is still (almost)
as active as a puppy.  She went from being pure black with a white chin,
paws, and belly, to having a white mask on her face (like a reverse
raccoon) and much more white and gray fur all over.  She's really gorgeous.

Sorry this was so long, but ya got me goin'!

She's very protective of those she knows when she's at the house. If I
have her running loose outside and someone is walking down the sidewalk,
her hair will stand up and she'll run directly at them while growling -
what appears to be full attack mode - she stops cold at the property
line every time though. If I see it and holler at her, she stops
wherever she is, but she never goes ON the sidewalk, only to the edge of
the yard.
My house sits up on a little hill slightly back from the road, and
before I got her kids used to like using the edge of my yard as a ramp
while riding their bikes. Maiden put a stop to that real quick. The edge
of the yard is HER territory. We don't get as many trick or treaters as
we used to. :)
When she's in unfamiliar territory, she's shy but friendly. No growling
or hair standing up, but she won't be too social unless you have
something tasty in your hand.
Her best performance was she met my kid (same day I met my kid). Maiden
was in another room behind a child gate (she's afraid of gates, chairs,
and the &quot;F&quot; word), and Sam was at the kitchen table. When I let Maiden
into the kitchen to say hello, she very reluctantly approached Sam with
her ears back and tail tucked, gave her a few sniffs and then licked her
hand. I couldn't believe it. It was like she knew Sam is family. I
could've saved a lot of money on a DNA test. :)

I don't like tying them up either. I had mine on a run when she was a

&gt; horses.
&gt;My mother *hated* cats so never had a

&gt; own. Now we have 5. Go figure.
&gt;All of our animals (except some of the

&gt; cats, or animals that were dumped at

&gt; could &quot;no longer&quot; care for them.
&gt;We kept snakes for years. My father
&gt; brought home on the train from NYC to
&gt; Chappaqua a small corn snake in a
&gt; paper bag for my birthday. Imagine if
&gt; that had gotten loose? One of the
&gt; snakes was a large (6') black snake
&gt; which had been injured in a brush fire. I
&gt; can remember my mother rubbing

&gt;When we moved to Virginia in the early

Do you still have dogs and horses, Callen? My mom use to always have
these big, fluffy white tom cats when I was growing up, and they weren't
friendly, so I never thought I cared much for cats, like my grandma gave
me a black female kitten for Christmas one year, that I named &quot;Punkin&quot;,
and from them on, I was enamored with cats, and can't imagine life
without them....or dogs!

I think it's wonderful to adopt orphaned animals. We have gotten some of
our best cats that way. When I was a kid, there was no pound here, so
people would just drop off unwanted animals, and I was always dragging
a cat, or dog home that I found somewhere. One time I rescued a litter
of kittens dropped off at the local dump and brought them home, gave
them baths and food, and found homes for all but one, that I kept, and
named &quot;Scoots&quot;..what a sweetheart he was.

Snakes...I don't care for (not so much!) but our one daughter had
several ribbon snakes when she lived at home, and bought &quot;feeder&quot; fish
to give them...like a tiny Goldfish.

Did you get the goats as babies? My husband's family use to raise
them...neat animals!

&gt; pets. Would be GREAT, if you were able to share some pictures with the
&gt; group too...we can have a photo pet parade!  :o)
">

Neat topic.....

I've never had furry pets until just last year when we got a Shar Pei.
She's a purebred blue bearcoat and her name is Azura.  She's great with the
kids and a complete nut so she fits right in!  We also have some freshwater
tropical fish (nothng fancy just some neon tetras).   We did have a
terrarium/ aquarium with various frogs, toads, salamaders, lizards, fish
etc.  We also had a ringneck snake and a box turtle.

When I was little I had a pet barn owl which we incubated and hatched from
an egg.  I named it Mookie because I thought his face looked like a monkey
and I was only about two so that's how I pronounced monkey.  Anyway, we had
Mookie for a while and would feed him mice and little peeps.  He used to
roost in a nice wooden box my dad built up on the roof but when he was
hungry, he would wait til we opened the door and fly right in the house and
sit on top of the refrigerator (where we kept the frozen mice etc.)

Well, one day he didn't come in we thought perhaps he's feeding on his own
but several weeks went by without a sign of him.  We later received a letter
in the mail with the leg band we had put on him and a brief note saying that
he had flown over some military base (several states away from where we
lived) and had been shot.

After that, we didn't really have another &quot;pet&quot;.  We did take rehabilitated
wild animals to be released since we had over 90 acres of woodland.  My dad
was a very avid birder so he was well-known by a lot of naturalists and
often had people give him animals and birds that had been nursed back to
health.

He had one lady who lived in Philly who took it upon herself to rehab
injured or abandoned squirrels of all things.  Gosh, they were annoying!
They became tame after living with her and having free reign of her house
(she actually put her house plants in cages and let the squirrels run
around!).  When it came time to release them, we were given strict
instructions as to how many peanuts each one should get and how often (they
all had names of course).  We would get them home, take them outside, open
the cage, and they were on their own from there.  They would hang around the
house though.  One of them jumped on my mom's back and scared the crap out
of her.  Another one ran up my dad's leg and dug his nails into him all the
way up.

Another time she gave us a crow named Merlin and the same deal, detailed
instructions about what to do and again, my dad said, &quot;Yeah, OK.&quot;  and as
soon as we got home, the crow was on his own.  And again, the thing was half
tame from her spending so much time with it that it got mad if we didn't pay
attention to it.  It used to appear out of nowhere and swoop down and peck
me in the head and pull my hair out if we didn't give it peanuts!  I hated
that thing.  Eventually he got used to being in the wild again and he didn't
attack us anymore.

My mom had a pet raccoon when she was a teenager along with cats and mixed
breed dogs and a toy Chihauhau named Ollie.  I don't think my dad ever had
any pets.  He preferred enjoying the animals in the wild.  He spent a lot of
time putting up bird houses for Eastern Bluebirds and recording their
numbers.  He also put up some nesting platforms for ospreys.

My brother is a top birder as well and has travelled across the country
extensively.  We both learned a great appreciation for wildlife from our
dad.  We miss him a lot.

I can't wait to hear some more unusual pet stories!

I'll put in a plug for my dog, an Italian Spinone. They are wonderful
good natured hunters (ask Moni, who has met mine), with all the
affectionate nature typical of hunters, but without the racy, wound up
quality that can make hunting dogs difficult to live with. The link
below provides a description of the breed, many links, and a couple of

and he loves going there.

The longest I've been without a dog is for 9 months, after our Golden
Retriever, Shiloh died at my feet from a heart attack, at only 8 years
of age, until I heard about a litter of puppies here in town...also G.
Retrievers, and we drove through a snow storm to go look at 10 gorgeous
puppies on New Years Eve, and picked Nugget out. He was too young to
leave his mother, so I put a deposit on him, and went back 2 weeks later
to get him. That was nearly 5  wonderful years ago.

What color are your Parakeets? Were they real young when you got them?
They are such fun birds, and if we didn't have 5 house cats, I'd sure be

We just got them a couple of weeks ago.  Our new farm is completely

of it, until you realize that they will take over everything.   Joe

black, devil-looking things.  I have never liked goats but find myself

Both basic blue; two males, got the both very young from the same
brood.  Real characters with each other. With two, it's near
impossible to tame them, but I could have Cloud on my finger in no

trained many a 'keet in a single day.

I also had a Yellow Naped Amazon Parrot for 20 yrs - Dennis.
Incredible talker and singer with a killer vibrato (he loved Brenda
Lee and Patsy Cline). He was a handful though; like having a
screaming, demanding 3 year old child - but for 20 years. He was a
real love, but turned fairly viscious on me after puberty (which can
be common w/them, at about 7-8 yrs old) He hated all men with a
passion then, so I ended up adopting him out to a woman he adored

We have two neighbors with iguanas and one day we had company and we

&gt;&gt; even begin to burn off their energy.

&gt;&gt;I have friends who have had many
&gt;&gt; Cavalier King Charles Spaniels and they
&gt;&gt; were developed to be lap dogs, so they
&gt;&gt; may be perfect for you. They seem a
&gt;&gt; little vacant in the eyes for my taste, but
&gt;&gt; one of my dogs is half Shepherd, half
&gt;&gt; Border Collie, so I'm comparing them to
&gt;&gt; the freakishly intense stare of the
&gt;&gt; psycho that lives in my house.

&gt;How many long haired German Shepherds do you have? It sounds like you
&gt;have several dogs?  I love German Shepherds, and we did have one that
&gt;the mother was a purebred, but the father was part Shepherd and &quot;Rex&quot;
&gt;was too protective with our family, so after he bit four people, and
&gt;killed a Beagle, we had him put to sleep. A Border Collie is extremely
&gt;smart, but needs LOTS of exercise. I know small dogs are active, but
&gt;they are content to run around the house, chasing a ball, and don't have
&gt;to take them out and go on runs with them, etc. like the bigger, more
&gt;energetic breeds. My folks had Yorkies and Toy Poodles, and they were
&gt;busy, but could lay for hours in their laps. I would NEVER get a Jack
&gt;Russell, or probably any small terrier breed, as most don't care for
&gt;cats, so that wouldn't work!

&gt;We've always had big dogs....mostly hunting type dogs, which are
&gt;wonderful! Our groomer told me to look into the Cavalier King Charles
&gt;Spaniels also, but can't find any breeders near us. I'm not in any hurry
&gt;to get a 2nd dog, as have our 4 year old Golden Retriever, and he's a
&gt;handful, but love him dearly!

The cats are very well-trained.   One cat is actually afraid of rats.   The
other cats don't pay much attention to them.   If the rats are making a lot of
noise, they might give them a passing 1 second glance, then go back to ignoring
them.   You'd be surprised.   I think the cage tips them off that they're not
the same as wild rodents - that they're different.   I definitely don't let rats
walk around loose in front of cats.   The three cats will often be sleeping on
the bed and the rats can be on a dresser in their cage in the same room, though,
with no problems.   With each of the cats, there were rats already here, which
might be a factor.

Very nice looking dog, Mickey...what is your dog's name? I have seen
this breed in dog shows, and seems to be they are very tall, when see
them on the TV? How did you happen to choose this particular breed? Do
you use your dog for hunting? G. Retrievers are excellent hunters too,
and several in our dog's  family are top rated hunting dogs, including
his grandfather who is a grand champion, not only in the U.S., but in
Canada, as well, but our dog is only a pet, which he doesn't seem to
mind in the least! :o)

&gt;When I was little I had a pet barn owl

&gt; thought his face looked like a monkey
&gt; and I was only about two so that's how I
&gt; pronounced monkey.

&lt;snipped for length&gt;

You have some interesting pets! I was wondering if there was any
particular reason you chose a Shar Pei last year, since it was your
first dog? Ironically enough, I just came from visiting my sis in law,
and I had to stop my car, cause of her neighbor's Shar Pei laying out in
the middle of the highway! Betsy said the dog does it all the time, and
I'm surprised someone hasn't hit it! They really are an unusual looking
dog, with all that wrinkly skin. I've never had any tropical fish..just
Guppies and Gold fish mainly, but fish are fascinating.

I enjoyed hearing about Mookie, but how SAD, that he was shot, flying
over a military base....WHY on earth would they shoot him for that
reason? Your address must have been on the  leg band, so they knew where
to return it from another state? I'll bet you were devastated when you
received that?!

Pets of all kinds, are such a joy, and bring so much happiness to a
person's life, but is too bad they don't live longer, as they are only
ours to &quot;borrow&quot; here on earth for a much too short period of time, and
we've had many come n' go in the 49 years we've been married, but some
stand out more in my memory than others, and some I will never forget.

|&gt;
|&gt; I grew up with dogs and cats, and have never been without either in my
|&gt; entire life, and really can't imagine life without them. At the present
|&gt; time, we have a Golden Retriever, named Nugget, who will be  5  years
|&gt; old in November. He is our 4th Golden in a row, as they are such
|&gt; magnificent dogs. Now that hubby and I are older and less active, we'd
|&gt; like to have a small breed dog, which we have never had....any
|&gt; suggestions, as to what might be a good choice?  We also have 5  very
|&gt; spoiled, lovable house cats..all males. We have a black/white Tuxedo
|&gt; kitty, named Torbie and two tabby brothers, named Stars &amp; Stripes..we
|&gt; adopted these three as kittens from the pound 5 years ago. We also have
|&gt; our big, beautiful Seal Point traditional &quot;apple-face&quot; Siamese, Shang,
|&gt; who came from a breeder in Oregon, and he is 7 years old, and our 2nd
|&gt; Siamese. Last, but not least is our youngest puss..a black/white
|&gt; shorthair, named Oreo, who is 3 years old.  Torbie and Stars do NOT get
|&gt; along at all, so that makes life chaotic at times!  :-(
|&gt;
|&gt; I've always been horse crazy, and was given a colt when I was 15 years
|&gt; old, that I named Candy, but she had been born in the woods, and was in
|&gt; terrible health when I got her, and only lived a short time, despite the
|&gt; many vet calls,  which broke my heart!
|&gt;
|&gt; My parents bought a black/white Shetland pony for our kids when they
|&gt; were quite young,  and  eventually Sugar died..probably of old age, but
|&gt; she was a sweetheart. Our kids had a multitude of pets, including a fish
|&gt; tank, ant farm, snakes (eek!) lizards, Parakeets, rabbits, and turtles,
|&gt; besides the dogs and cats we had while they were growing up, and..the
|&gt; pony.
|&gt;
|&gt; I would love to hear about your pets...the ones you have now, and any
|&gt; from the past, that stand out in your memory.

|Great idea.

|however.
|
|Rotten Ralph was the world's biggest wimp of a purebred German

|When he was a puppy, he would climb under the couch when we had a

|I was sitting on the couch at the time, and he ran to hide, lifting
|the couch and me up in the air.
|
|My ex was a police officer at the time and Ralph thought all black and
|white cars must be &quot;Daddy's&quot; car.  My ex and I had Ralph at the beach
|one day and there was a black and white, but not from my ex's

|full &quot;oh boy!&quot; attitude, ran to the cop's door, jumped up on the
|window and barked.  I swear that cop had a new sunroof installed that

We chose the breed because of their gentle, easy going personality. They
are very intelligent, somewhat clownish, and unaggressive. They have no
undercoat and don't shed much. (You do need to pluck out the dead hair,
which is typical of wire-haired breeds.) We don't hunt, but the breed is
considered one of the best all around hunters, particularly over rough,
uneven terrain; they are natural pointers and strong swimmers. They do
seem tall, until you see them around Great Danes and Irish Wolfhounds.
They are about the same height as a Pointer (2-3 inches taller than your
Goldens), but being a bit more muscular and heavier boned, they weigh
about 10-15% more.

Just pulling yer leg, Judy.  ;-D

&quot;Real&quot; animals we had were basically farm dogs and kitties which we
loved and cared for, but just never really got attached to all that
much, mostly we all played with each other.  Notable were 'Snooper',
the nicest little black/white cocker you'd ever come across. Snooper
met an unfortunate end when she somehow fell into a large drinking
trough for cows/horses and drowned.
The raccoons were 'Charles' and 'Josephine', named by our wierd Mom.
Found as pups in the wild and raised before being released.  Awesome
little animals I wouldn't mind re-owning.
The hawk, we found hurt, was shot in a wing - threw a hunting jacket
over him to catch, took him to a vet for dressing, and nursed him for
a couple of months before release.
The bobcat, was found as a &quot;kitten&quot; by a truck-driving Uncle who
dropped it off with us to care for until he found a home for it -
beautiful &quot;kitty&quot; that to this day wish we could've kept.
The monkey I think I've mentioned before, 'Bongo'.  A cool little
squirrel-monkey, almost lime green in color with a cute dark
expressive little face.  We had Bongo for a year or so until one day
while we were at school, Bongo somehow got out and onto a swing set  -
his collar got caught on the set somehow and the poor thing choked.
When we found hmi he was barely breathing; off to the vet and back
with meds and treatment, but the poor little guy didn't make it
through the night.
We also went through hamsters like M&amp;M's, the things would get lost,
maybe eaten, run away, whatever.
Also had the occasional field rabbit that we'd catch and hang onto for
a while before releasing them.

&quot;Grown up', I had to to kitties I adopted, 'Axel', a black/grey
shorthaird tabby 'picked' me not too long after he was born, and
'Nemo' was a beautiful little light-blond longhaired wild kitten
rescued after a big warehouse fire where I worked.  A few months after
their long little kitty lives (18yo/12yo) were over, we picked up a
little Beagle puppy, 'Bruno', now about 2yo - an absolutely great
little dog who Mastered &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; with our son, inside and
outdoors, all on his own.

That's about it for pets now, the Beagle; plus whatever wild birds and
squirrels show up when I put out some seed, dried fruit, and peanuts
for.

&gt; &gt;&gt;In my twenties, my gf at the time and I

&gt; &gt;&gt;friend who I lived with around that time
&gt; &gt;&gt;had a 13' reticulated python and two
&gt; &gt;&gt;tarantulas. The snake was
&gt; &gt;&gt;well-mannered, unless you were
&gt; &gt;&gt;walking by it with white socks on, which
&gt; &gt;&gt;it always thought was a mouse. We
&gt; &gt;&gt;used to let thing have free roam of the
&gt; &gt;&gt;house. Spiders and scorpions are
&gt; &gt;&gt;boring.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Nowadays, I just have my 5 year old dog
&gt; &gt;&gt;Maiden. Had a cat for 15 years, but she
&gt; &gt;&gt;died this past April.

&gt; &gt; I never had any &quot;fuzzy creatures&quot; while growing up, such as hamsters,
&gt; &gt; gerbils, guinea pigs, etc., and neither did our kids..thank goodness!
&gt; &gt; My teenage granddaughters do though.

&gt; &gt; Our first little yellow parakeet was named &quot;Tina&quot;, and  later got a blue
&gt; &gt; one, we named &quot;David&quot;. They never learned to talk, but my aunt's bird
&gt; &gt; did, and was great!  I wouldn't care to ever have a Scorpion, snake, or
&gt; &gt; Tarantula (eek!) I can't even look at those  ugly spiders at a pet
&gt; &gt; store!  :-(

&gt; &gt; What kind of dog is Maiden? Sorry you lost your kitty, after 15
&gt; &gt; years...do you plan to get another sometime? They are such GREAT pets!

&gt; No hurry for another cat. Cleo (the cat) was owned by a family friend
&gt; who died in 1993, right after she got Cleo. We raised her from there.

&gt; Maiden is a Rottweiler/Lab mix. Barks at everything, but smart as hell
&gt; and cute as a button. She was a Christmas gift from a friend. When I
&gt; brought her home, only her head was sticking out of may jacket's inside
&gt; pocket. http://img85.imageshack.us/my.php?image=maiden2tu4.jpghttp://img224.i...
