I just heard this and was thinking maybe it inspired Dylan to
write his atom bomb songs.

Thirteen Women (And Only One Man In Town):
Bill Haley and His Comets [1954]

Last night I was dreamin'
Dreamed about the H-Bomb
Well the bomb-a went off and I was caught
I was the only man on the ground

There was-a 13 women and only one man in town
Thirteen women and only one man in town
And as funny as it may be
The one and only man in town was me
With 13 women and me the only man around

I had 2 gals every morning
Seein' that I was well fed
And believ-a you me, one sweetened my tea
While another one buttered my bread

Two gals gave me my money
Two gals made me my clothes
And another sweet thing bought me a diamond ring
About forty carats I suppose

Well, 13 women and only one man in town
There was-a 13 women and only one man in town
It was something I can't forget
Because I think of those 13 women yet
Well-a 13 women and only one man around

I had 3 gals dancin' the Mambo
Three gals ballin' the jack
And-a all-a the rest really did their best
Boy they sure were a lively pack

I thought I was in Heaven
And all of these angels were mine
But I woke up and I ended the dream
'Cause I had to get to work on time

Well-a 13 women and only one man in town
There was-a 13 women and only one man in town
No I can't tell where I've been
'Cause I kinda think that someday I'll go back again
To those 13 women and me the only man around

Well-a 13 women and me the only man around
Well-a 13 women and me the only man around
