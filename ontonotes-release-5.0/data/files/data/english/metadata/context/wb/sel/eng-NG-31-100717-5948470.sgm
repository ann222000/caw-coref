The Nuts and Dolts of America's Downfall
By Mark Drolette
Created Oct 2 2006 - 11:32pm

"Hey, Mark: I got a question for ya!" my brother-in-law, a rabid
right-winger, said as he approached me from across the yard at a recent
family gathering.

That's when I committed an error in judgment almost as severe as the one my
sister made the moment she accepted his proposal: I responded.

"What is it?" I said before I could catch myself. Damn! All those years of
therapy and, still, this.

"I guess Slick Willie got caught with his pants down again, huh?" Dolton
sniggered as he slithered up beside me.

"What are you talking about?" I asked needlessly.

"You know: your hero, Bill Clinton. Didja catch his meltdown with Chris
Wallace on Fox News the other day?"

Good old Dolt and his Bush-supporting, Limbaugh-parroting, ovine brethren:
they're so pathetically predictable. Too late now, though: the battle was
on.

"First," I said, "Bill Clinton is not my hero. I've long felt ambivalent
about the man."

"Like a frog?"

"What?"

"You know, amviba--, I mean, amphiba--, well, however that word is said, you
know what I mean: like a frog."

"Well, frankly, no," I said, "I've really never quite known what you've
meant although, in this case, I think you're referring to 'amphibious.'"

"Yeah, that's it!"

"No, that's not how he makes me feel."

"Oh."

"But, since we're on the subject," I continued, "it certainly would be hard
to be more toadie-like than was Mr. Wallace during the Clinton ambush."

"What ambush?" Dolt said indignantly. "He was only asking what people wanted
to know: why didn't Clinton go after Osama bin Laden when he had the chance?
Wallace even said he'd gotten a lot of e-mails asking the very same thing!"

"Oh, it must be true, then, if he said it."

"I'm glad you see my point," Dolt said, beaming.

How could I miss it, sitting atop his head like that?

"Look, Dolt," I replied, wondering how painful it was, really, to slit one's
wrists, "the only e-mails a soulless worm like Wallace or any of the neocon
whoreporate media lackeys over at Pravda West pay attention to are the ones
they get from the White House telling them exactly what the latest lie or
straw man du jour is. Except this time, their characteristically ham-fisted
attempt to rewrite history failed when Clinton called them on it."

Dolt shook his head. "Yeah? Well, what about that recent documentary on ABC
proving Clinton was more interested in getting his knob polished than
protecting the country?"

"'Proving?' Do you even know what a documentary is? As opposed to, oh, let's
just pick a wild example, a right-wing-produced piece of propaganda piped
directly into your home via what used to be the public's airwaves that's
fully intended to shoo facts down the memory hole?"

He snorted. "Huh! You liberals: always so concerned about your precious
'facts.'"

"Uh, yeah," I said while making a mental note to check on the legal
definition of justifiable homicide, "we're funny like that. But, for a
little while now, since like when time began, facts have had an odd way of
rebutting lies, and the record is clear: the Clinton administration
aggressively went after bin Laden while George Bush, Dick Cheney and the
rest of that rotten lot, all too strangely and conveniently, did nothing
before 9/11. Other than plot it, I mean."

"Please!" Dolton scoffed. "You and your loony tunes conspiracy theories.
Besides, Condi Rice recently said the 9/11 commission 'turned over every
rock' during its investigation."

"Well, she could only have been describing how the commission finally
located Cheney and Bush so their non-testimony could be non-gathered."

This, my brother-in-law ignored. He'd already returned to a basic, base
right-wing obsession: sex.

As in: other people's.

"What am I supposed to tell little Dolt about the sanctity of the Oval
Office?" my brother-in-law went on, referring to my unfortunate nephew,
nine-year-old Dolton, Jr. "That the big Dolt thinks it's just fine and dandy
for the president to order some defenseless young thing to blow him in the
White House?"

"Yeah, I guess it's far better instead to tell him the president orders
defenseless young things to be blown up from the White House."

His eyes narrowed. "You know, Mark, when you're the only country in the
world with guts enough to go to war to spread peace, sometimes innocent
people die. Besides, we need to get the terrorists before they get us."

"Not so fast there, Dolt, with that false dichotomy of 'it's either them or
us,'" I countered. "That bit sounds suspiciously close to another country's
policy to which our country's policy is suspiciously close."

Dolt's face flushed crimson. "Surely not you, my sickeningly tolerant
brother-in-law, are talking about -- ," he looked around furtively and then
said, in a hushed and angry voice, "the I-word?"

"You bet I'm talkin' about Israel," I said.

He gasped. "Why, that's.you're.anti-semantic!" he cried.

"No," I responded, "your beloved Dubya is anti-semantic. Speaking of the
devil, though, and considering how I view Bush's hellish actions and creepy,
evil lineage, I could safely be called anti-satanic."

"I've come to expect that sort of crap from you about our brave president,"
Dolt hissed as his neck veins bulged, "but you've really crossed the line
with your Jew-hating garbage. Why don't you just go ahead and join the
terrorists?"

"And who, exactly, would these 'terrorists' be?"

"Muslims, you idiot. Palestinians. Arabs."

"I see. And so, in your book, which would obviously have lots of
monosyllabic words and pictures in it, all Palestinians and Arabs and
Muslims are terrorists?"

Even Dolt could see the ever-smaller corner looming beyond his broad paint
brush.

"Well, uh.no, I, uh.didn't mean that."

"You didn't mean it even though you said it? What is that, then: your best
Bush administration impersonation?"

"What I mean is.uh.," Dolt sputtered, "is.right.that your little bleeding
heart apparently doesn't care that the Palestinians have vowed to push
Israel into the sea. Ha!"

"Yeah, we've heard that one for years now. Yet I've always wondered just how
the power-mad Palestinians would do that: brandish their rocks and
slingshots while chasing a terrified Israel, with its two to three hundred
nuclear warheads and immense military, into the water?"

"Very funny. But even if you don't care about Israel, you'll be singing a
different tune, and in Muslim, too, when you and your terrorist-loving pals
have all helped al-Qaeda win the war on terror and the caliphate comes to
town."

"Uh, there is no Muslim language. A Muslim is a person, one who adheres to
the Islamic faith," I explained.

"See what I mean? Stickin' up for 'em every chance you get. Case closed."

"What's closed is your mind," I said. "Anyone who believes Bush's recent
insane assertion that the bogeymen of al-Qaeda could somehow 'advance their
vision of a unified, totalitarian Islamic state that can confront and
eventually destroy the free world' is just as nuts as he and his Project for
the New American Century collaborators are. Of course, I can see why Bush
and his crooked corporate cronies would be frightened by the prospect of
this conspicuously undefined 'Islamofascism' he keeps harping about."

Dolt's eyes widened. "You can?"

"Sure!" I said. "It would interfere mightily with the good, old American
fascism we have now."

"You're hopeless, Mark. You're no better than the terrorists, who hate
Israel because it's Jewish and hate us because of our freedoms."

I was impressed: Dolt was on pace for a personal best in CPM (cliché's per
minute).

"Then they should quit hating us any moment now," I said, "since the
Bushies, abetted by a criminal Congress, have done a fine job of eliminating
those freedoms, especially with the recent passage of the breathtakingly
hideous 'Detainee Bill' that jettisons habeas corpus, precludes judicial
review, 'legalizes' torture and allows Bush to imprison people forever."

"I know where he could start with that last one," Dolt sneered.

"Which is something I'll sure you'll dutifully follow up on once your
shoo-in application for Neighborhood Snitch Leader is approved," I replied.

He didn't like that so much but I didn't care; I was steaming now:

"As for the taboo of criticism of Israeli government policies equating to
anti-Semitism you've trotted out a couple times," I continued, "it's the Big
Lie that stifles all debate -- that is, if debate still existed in this
cursed land -- about the decades-long conflating of American and Israeli
policy that has proved disastrous for Palestinians, Israelis and Americans
alike, an ugly whopper dealt to you daily by the complicit media you've
swallowed whole."

"You mean the liberal media? Hardly!"

"If you mean the media are hardly liberal, I'd actually find myself agreeing
with you for once which would mean I'd then have to go out and shoot
myself," I replied.

"You know that's not what I meant," he sniffed.

"But that's how it is," I said. "This 'liberal media' canard you and your
fellow Dittoheads constantly spout: the truth is, the majority of American
media are controlled by five mega-conglomerates whose owners are almost
exclusively right-wingers and solely interested in acquiring and
consolidating even more outlets so they can, what else?, make more money.
There's great advantage to them simply regurgitating what they're fed by the
ruling fascists instead of doing what the late, great First Amendment
intended as their real function: keeping an objective eye on government and
openly reporting the details."

"Who cares about 'details' when our American way of life is threatened??"
Dolt exclaimed, once again proving he never found an unrelated tangent he
didn't like.

"I don't know, Dolt, maybe it should be threatened."

"Huh?"

"Well, with our long record of bombing whomever we feel obstructs our
'right'
to consume as much of the planet's resources we desire; eviscerated civil
liberties; fixed elections; super-galactic consumer and national debt; a
record trade imbalance; an endemic, distracting addiction to shopping; a
poisoned environment; bursting prisons; a racist drug war; wacko religious
fundamentalism; a dismal educational system; enflamed xenophobia; rampant
sexism; forty-five million Americans without health care; oppression of
labor; and a government of the corporations, by the corporations and for the
corporations, maybe our cherished way of life could use a little upsetting."

"Where do you get all this stuff?" Dolt demanded. "It's like we're living on
different planets."

What a delightful I image, I thought.

"Besides," he said snarkily, "it's pretty funny how I never hear any of this
on TV."

"Hel-lo! Have you not heard a word I've said?" I asked.

"I only listen if it's important," Dolt spat.

"Then listen to this: you and your fellow good Germans continuously and
willingly expose yourselves to, essentially, state-run media that spew
ridiculous, non-stop lies like: Clinton did nothing while Bush has done
everything to protect America; all Muslims are jihadists whose sole aim is
to squelch your right to watch American Idol while you gorge yourself on
toxic food and charge more useless crap from QVC; the gutting of the
Constitution is actually a good thing designed to, Orwellian-like, protect
your liberties while simultaneously sending them down the crapper; Lebanon
and Gaza had it coming while tiny, oppressed Israel, the recipient of three
billion U.S. dollars annually that help fund the world's fourth-largest
military, is a democratic oasis simply defending itself against swarthy bad
people rather than a terrorist apartheid state whose main lobby AIPAC has
both a stranglehold on American foreign policy and ensured anyone daring to
criticize the Israeli government's inhumanity is automatically slandered as
a Jew hater; and on and on and on."

"Now, wait a -- ," Dolt began.

"No, you wait," I said. "I'm not done."

For once, he was silent.

"And so all of this," I said, "all of it, is spun and sanitized and sexed-up
and spoon-fed in sensationalistic and sugarcoated sound bites to you and
your fellow phony patriots, assuring you it's all part of a grand scheme to
keep you safe from some scary plan of world domination by 'Islamofascists'
that exists only in your masters' heads.

"You buy the lies and then, worse, spread them, repeating them until they've
become gospel, thereby making possible both the transformation of a land
that once held forth truly lofty ideals into a neo-feudalistic, murderous
rogue nation, and the perpetuation of catastrophic atrocities like Gaza, the
West Bank, Lebanon, Afghanistan, Iraq, and next, Iran, where your heroes
fully intend, soon, to use nuclear weapons."

Dolt had remained silent and either had suffered a stroke or was still
searching for his next Bushism. At last, he spoke:

"Whatever. You believe what you want to believe, Mark. The fact is, there
really are people in the world who seek to obliterate America, and it's just
like the president says: we fight them there, or fight them over here."

"Well, Dolt," I answered, "I'll concede one point: America does have mortal
enemies. But you're a little late. Had you taken but a moment to pry
yourself away from the electronic doping tube to look around, maybe you'd
have noticed millions of them have already been spread throughout this
country for quite some time."

Panic creased his face.

"Really?? No! Where are they?"

"I'm looking at one."
