No they don't. As you can see from your own post some don't even ever
learn about punctuation.

For about 10 minutes, then they become teenagers.

Mary responds: Think of it in terms of the biblical phrase &quot;and it
came to pass&quot;. Engrave this on your forehead. It comes to pass, it
doesn't come to stay. So whatever it is that is driving you nuts at
the moment, it will be cured by tincture of time, and the kid will be
off to some new phase, with its own challenges.

My kids are now 16, 13 and 9. I'm glad they can all dress themselves,
get a bowl of cereal and brush their teeth on their own, but what they
no longer need from me in terms of time and energy for hands on
physical type care, they make up for in emotional and psychological
demands. Now we're having homework wars, arguments about how late
someone can stay out, why they can't wear certain things, why a half
truth meant to deceive is the same as a lie (and sins of omission are
in the same category), and why its inappropriate to make crank phone
calls to someone's cell phone.

Aieeeee!!!
