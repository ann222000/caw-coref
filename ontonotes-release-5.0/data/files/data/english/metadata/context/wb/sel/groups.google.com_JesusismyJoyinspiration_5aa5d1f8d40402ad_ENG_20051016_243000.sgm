Jesus said: &quot;You are the light of the world-like a city on a mountain, glowing in the night for all to see. Don't hide your light(Son-shine) under a basket! Instead, put it on a stand and let it shine for all.&quot; (Matthew 5:14-15)
My love and prayers to all!! Your Sister in Christ, Cindy

Scroll down and turn your volume up!

GOOD MORNING

While you have your first cup of coffee, set back and listen to some music and read about HELLO.

Have you ever thought what this word stands for? Read on....

Do you know that a simple &quot;hello&quot; can be a sweet one?

The word H E L L O means:

H=How are you?

E= Everything all right?

L= Like to hear from you .

L= Love to see you soon!

O=Obviously, You are my friend..so, HELLO!

It has made me smile every time I say hello since then so send this message to the people you care about.

Just thinking of you!

I only sent this to people that I knew would NOT break the chain or that believe in the power of prayer.

May today there be peace within you. May you trust your God that you are exactly where you are meant to be.

&quot;I believe that friends are quiet angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to fly.&quot;

hope you are drinking from your saucer too.....

I've never made a fortune, and it's probably too late now.
But I don't worry about that much, I'm happy anyhow
And as I go along life's way,
I'm reaping better than I sowed.
I'm drinking from my saucer,
'Cause my cup has overflowed.

Haven't got a lot of riches,
and sometimes the going's tough
But I've got loving ones all around me,
and that makes me rich enough.
I thank God for his blessings,
and the mercies He's bestowed.
I'm drinking from my saucer,
'Cause my cup has overflowed.

I remember times when things went wrong,
My faith wore somewhat thin.
But all at once the dark clouds broke,
and the sun peeped through again.

So Lord, help me not to gripe,
about the tough rows I have hoed.
I'm drinking from my saucer,
'Cause my cup has overflowed.

If God gives me strength and courage,
When the way grows steep and rough.
I'll not ask for other blessings,
I'm already blessed enough.

And may I never be too busy,
to help others bear their loads.
Then I'll keep drinking from my saucer,
'Cause my cup has overflowed.

When I think of how many people in this world have it worse

than I do, I realize just how blessed we really are.

Don't be too busy today...Share this inspiring message with friends and family.

Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures.
