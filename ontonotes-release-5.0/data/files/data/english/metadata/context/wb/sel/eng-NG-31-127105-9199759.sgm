Sorry to be absolutely clueless here, but can someone tell me what an
NTI is?

Thanks

It's a dental appliance that fits over the front teeth and keeps the
back teeth from touching. If you do a google search for it within this
group you'll find links to more information. Some people get excellent
relief from their headaches using it. It works best for those who wake
up with a headache in the morning from clenching their teeth all night
long.

Now here's something I know juuuuuuuust a little bit about.  ;-)

The goal in Migraine Prevention is to *minimize* the noxious (that
means &quot;bad&quot;) input into the trigeminal sensory system. Most of us are
familiar with the practitioner encouraging the migraineur from
avoiding their &quot;triggers&quot;.  The trigger is what sets off the pre-
sensitized trigeminal nerve system to initiate a migraine event.

Sometimes the trigger both sensitizes the trigeminal nerve and sets
off the migraine event.

One of the most influential (no, THE most influential) noxious inputs
into the trigeminal sensory system is nociception (the receipt of bad
news) from the 3rd division of the TRI-geminal nerve (TRI-geminal:
Three divisions, get it?).  The 3rd division is a two-way highway of
information:  Sensory information coming from all structures below the
cheekbone, and &quot;motor&quot; information going out to the muscles of
mastication.

Here comes the Big Light Bulb part...

Migraine is known as a disorder of the trigeminal nerve.  Not just a
part of it, but ALL of it.  Neurology has been focusing on the
chemical reactions that occur to initiate and propagate a migraine
event.  They accept that the trigeminal is pre-sensitized.  But how
did it get that way?  How does it stay that way?  That's not their
immediate concern.  They are looking to abort the acute attack, or to
temper the frequency and intensity of attacks.

During sleep, the majority of migraineurs have hyperactive trigeminal
*motor* activity...that is, their jaws are clenched together during
certain phases of their sleep cycles.   Sometimes, the clenching
occurs with their lower jaw set off-center to a degree.  The degree of
&quot;excursion&quot; and intensity of the clench is how someone's jaw joint can
become highly symptomatic and dysfunctional (a &quot;TMJ&quot; patient).   If
the clenching occurs dead-center, the jaw-joints are fine.

Monsterous nocturnal clenching intensity elicits considerable
trigeminal sensory nociception.  So much so that a sufferer may wake
up with a degree of headache.  Or, their trigeminal sensory system has
at least been subject to abundant noxious input, thereby sensitizing
it.  They now have the &quot;eggshell&quot; syndrome.  They seem to be OK, but
all it takes is the slightest irritant (even later that day) to set
off a migraine event.

An NTI device is specifically intended to inhibit the nociceptive
input to the trigeminal nerve (NTI = Nociceptive Trigeminal
Inhibition) by preventing the contacting of the canine and posterior
(molar) teeth during sleep.  The trigeminal motor nerve *cannot*
generate intense activity *unless* the molars or canine teeth are in
contact.

Does minimizing nociception to the trigeminal nerve &quot;cure&quot; migraine?
Nope.   If I don't wear mine for 4 or 5 nights in a row, I'm right
back to being the miserable suffering human being that I was years
ago.   But a *properly* provided NTI device can reduce the frequency
of migraine attacks (and tension-type headaches) to nearly zero.

I have one, but have a hard time wearing it because it tastes so bad. It's
like I can taste the plastic or acrylic or whatever it is made of. And the
taste stays in my mouth a long time.

Yikes!
Put a tablespoon of bleach in a glass of water and soak your NTI in
it.
(it'll smell like strong pool water).
If it was made using cold-cure acrylic, the monomer fumes should be
gone within
a day.

I noticed that too, Trixie, but then my mouth usually tastes like the
bottom of a shoe when I wake up anyway, so at least the acrylic is a
change of pace!

I brush mine with my toothpaste just before I put it in at night (and
again when I brush my teeth in the morning). The minty taste of the
toothpaste doesn't really stay on the device, but at least it makes
the acrylic more tolerable.  I did find out yesterday that when I
soaked it in the cute little box with the lid open (I forgot to close
it), it wasn't so bad last night. Hey, at least I remembered to put
the water in it!

&gt;&gt; &gt; immediate concern.  They are looking to abort the acute attack, or to
&gt;&gt; &gt; temper the frequency and intensity of attacks.

&gt;&gt; &gt; During sleep, the majority of migraineurs have hyperactive trigeminal
&gt;&gt; &gt; *motor* activity...that is, their jaws are clenched together during
&gt;&gt; &gt; certain phases of their sleep cycles.   Sometimes, the clenching
&gt;&gt; &gt; occurs with their lower jaw set off-center to a degree.  The degree of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;excursion&quot; and intensity of the clench is how someone's jaw joint can

&gt;&gt; &gt; the clenching occurs dead-center, the jaw-joints are fine.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Monsterous nocturnal clenching intensity elicits considerable

&gt;&gt; &gt; at least been subject to abundant noxious input, thereby sensitizing

&gt;&gt; &gt; all it takes is the slightest irritant (even later that day) to set
&gt;&gt; &gt; off a migraine event.

&gt;&gt; &gt; An NTI device is specifically intended to inhibit the nociceptive
&gt;&gt; &gt; input to the trigeminal nerve (NTI = Nociceptive Trigeminal
&gt;&gt; &gt; Inhibition) by preventing the contacting of the canine and posterior
&gt;&gt; &gt; (molar) teeth during sleep.  The trigeminal motor nerve *cannot*
&gt;&gt; &gt; generate intense activity *unless* the molars or canine teeth are in
&gt;&gt; &gt; contact.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Does minimizing nociception to the trigeminal nerve &quot;cure&quot; migraine?
&gt;&gt; &gt; Nope.   If I don't wear mine for 4 or 5 nights in a row, I'm right
&gt;&gt; &gt; back to being the miserable suffering human being that I was years
&gt;&gt; &gt; ago.   But a *properly* provided NTI device can reduce the frequency
&gt;&gt; &gt; of migraine attacks (and tension-type headaches) to nearly zero.

Ah, I'/d wondered about that.  Mine is just stained, but I wasn'//t sure if
hypochlorite would damage it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry to be absolutely clueless here, but can someone tell me what an
&gt;&gt;&gt; NTI is?
&gt;&gt; It's a dental appliance that fits over the front teeth and keeps the
&gt;&gt; back teeth from touching. If you do a google search for it within this
&gt;&gt; group you'll find links to more information. Some people get excellent
&gt;&gt; relief from their headaches using it. It works best for those who wake
&gt;&gt; up with a headache in the morning from clenching their teeth all night
&gt;&gt; long.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks

&gt; Now here's something I know juuuuuuuust a little bit about.  ;-)

&gt; The goal in Migraine Prevention is to *minimize* the noxious (that
&gt; means &quot;bad&quot;) input into the trigeminal sensory system. Most of us are
&gt; familiar with the practitioner encouraging the migraineur from
&gt; avoiding their &quot;triggers&quot;.  The trigger is what sets off the pre-
&gt; sensitized trigeminal nerve system to initiate a migraine event.

&gt; Sometimes the trigger both sensitizes the trigeminal nerve and sets
&gt; off the migraine event.

&gt; One of the most influential (no, THE most influential) noxious inputs
&gt; into the trigeminal sensory system is nociception (the receipt of bad
&gt; news) from the 3rd division of the TRI-geminal nerve (TRI-geminal:
&gt; Three divisions, get it?).  The 3rd division is a two-way highway of
&gt; information:  Sensory information coming from all structures below the
&gt; cheekbone, and &quot;motor&quot; information going out to the muscles of
&gt; mastication.

&gt; Here comes the Big Light Bulb part...

&gt; Migraine is known as a disorder of the trigeminal nerve.  Not just a
&gt; part of it, but ALL of it.  Neurology has been focusing on the
&gt; chemical reactions that occur to initiate and propagate a migraine
&gt; event.  They accept that the trigeminal is pre-sensitized.  But how
&gt; did it get that way?  How does it stay that way?  That's not their
&gt; immediate concern.  They are looking to abort the acute attack, or to

So the appliance is for nighttime use only?  I ask because I'm a bad
clencher anytime I have a migraine coming on, it's one of my warning
signs, along with aura.

The nighttime one is more common. However Dr. Jim does have a day time
version. The day time one (IIRC) is smaller and doesn't interfere with
speech for most people. The reports I've seen indicate you have to take
out the nighttime one if the phone rings in the middle of the night.

It never fails...my mother will come ask me a question seconds after I
put mine on at bedtime! She is hard of hearing anyway, so I don't dare
talk to her with the NTI on! She said when I giggle with it on, I look
like a demented chipmunk!

Where is Dr. Boyd's site? I looked within the group and found one that
I don't think is Dr. Boyd's. Could someone do me a favor and post it?
I apologize, profusely, in advance if I am just not finding it
elsewhere, nearby, in this string of copy, etc.

Googling the older messages in this group I get the following URLs:
http://www.nti-tss.com/ and www.drjimboyd.com (the second URL includes
a link to the first one I listed).

Hope this helps.
