Talk about furniture abuse! The following is an excerpt from a
1954 Mechanics Illustrated &quot;How to Refinish Furniture&quot; Fawcett bk.

&quot;For something really different in the way of unusual finishes,
try putting your finish on with a blowtorch. This process, which
is best suited to woods having dramatic grain patterns such as fir,
oak, black walnut, etc., is produced by scorching the wood with
the flame of the blowtorch to blacken and harden the grain
pattern and leave it raised in relief similar to a sand-blased
effect.&quot;

&quot;To scorch a panel of wood, it is not necessary to remove the old
finish with chemical removers, since the blowtorch will burn the
finish loose and it can be scraped off with a putty knife. Play
the flame of the torch on the wood, being careful not to let it
start burning with a flame. Just hold it long enough to char and
blacken evenly. A yellow flame rising from the wood is the signal
you're burning it instead of just charring it....&quot;

Makes you wonder how many good old pieces went up in flames in
the workshop...
