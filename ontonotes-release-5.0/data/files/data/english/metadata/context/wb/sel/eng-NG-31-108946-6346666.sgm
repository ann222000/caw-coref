You will get great answers from the peo on this board! Many have a LOT of experience, unlike so many of the other boards that are mostly new persons - NOT that I am pointing the finger and new professionals! I am just saying, there is a lot of experience on this one.

First, what kind of line do you want? Relaxation? Results oriented? In my view NO line exists that does both well. Let us know, and we can give you our opinions!

Thank you Janet,  I'm a new aesthetician and being that I haven't worked with too many product lines, it is a bit overwhelming to me on finding the right fit.  I do know that we haven't had great sales support with our current product line and we're not seeing results. I've been challanged to do some homework and help in assisting with bringing in a new line. I knew I could count on this board of highly trained professionals to put me in the right direction. Any information you can provide about a results oriented line would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you so much!

One of my fav lines, Cosmedix, I have heard has sold to Aloette. Is that true? I can't seem to find the owner to ask her, she is out of the country, I hear, so wonder if any of you know?

Another of my fav lines is IMAGE Skin Care. Any comments from anyone? And I hear that Laura Root, the guru, is formulating an entirely new line for results. Any comments, Laura? The base concept?

As for relaxation, I like Pevonia or Dermalogica but find when it comes to results for your clients seeking change they fall FLAT! I am a strictly results oriented esty - do relaxation techniques in my results oriented facials but have no strictly relaxation services  - no wraps, etc., but of course my services are now restricted to friends and family - of whom I have many, since there are NO estys in my area and I live among a subdiv of 80 homes. Lots of people to keep my skills up! Heck, I have more 'clients' than many who have a room and pay rent! Wearies me sometimes....
They pay for product, according to the service. Right now I am near the finish of practicing several series of alternatives to acids, for research. Fun subject!

As for performing results oriented services, I find specializing in this requires a company that focuses on education, and that is one of the things I like about IMAGE. They have regional education all over the US, and teach you what you need to know to do these services safely. Do all of you find this?

Cosmedix has also been doing their education well, but I will want to know where they are on the sold or not sold thing before recommending them - sometimes that interferes a lot in the education thing, (I have not heard that Aloette is into that.... if they are buyers of Cos, I would be hesitant on going in that direction until they prove
themselves...)

Any one heard anything about Agera lately?

Just my thoughts. How about others jumping in for this new esty? She needs you!

Hi Janet,

I understand that Cosmedix has changed hands, but I am not aware that it was
“sold” to anyone outside of the original company; beyond that, I cannot
comment.

Yes, it is true, Janet ;)  My partners and I will be launching a new line
within 6-8 weeks, Antiqua Prima.  (HYPERLINK
" http://www.antiquaprima.com/ " www.antiquaprima.com )  Ancient botanicals
formulated with biotechnology – “Stepping Forward without Forgetting the
Past” is our main theme.  The use of ancient botanicals and natural MMPIs to
help heal, protect, reduce inflammation, and combat acne with the inclusion
of peptides and other new technology assists the professional in  their
treatment room and home care regimens to help reduce the appearance of
aging.  Enlightenment Skincare’s Salicylic popular treatment products have
been improved and reformulated and will be incorporated into Antiqua Prima’s
arsenal.  We will also have on-line training videos, as well as webinars in
the months to come.

Thank you so much, this is of great help! I went to Image Skincare's website and was impressed with their product line. I will be sure to check out Antiqua Prima as well!

I would also recommend the Image products. Excellent results and  retails
well. Their customer service and reps are great.  I use some  products to fill in
the line (toners, less active masks, moisturizers) from a  few companies;
Gunilla of Sweden, Aesthetics Unique (Reviva Labs) and  Halina Andre. All have no
or low minimums. Not much on sales support, but always  available to answer
product questions.

Have you ever sampled products from Arbonne International?  Their anti aging line is phenominal, and there is no need for inventory, and you can make 35-80% profit!

Their customer service and reps are great.  I use some products to fill in the line (toners, less active masks, moisturizers) from a few companies; Gunilla of Sweden, Aesthetics Unique (Reviva Labs) and Halina Andre. All have no or low minimums. Not much on sales support, but always available to answer product questions.

Nicole,
It is my policy to not ever sell anything in my salon that anyone can get at home parties.
We just had this discussion on the Nailtech List.
Most of the Arbonee reps are NOT educated in skin care. They cannot give a skin analysis with no knowledge.
If my clients can get it at a home party, it will not be sold in my salon.
Here is what I wrote to the Nailtech List:
***********
I am not sure how much all of you know about skin care. I do not claim to be the walking book of knowledge on it, but please let me tell you a few things.
* MANY women think that when they use a new product that they are "allergic" to it. I used to think that and my skin would react to ANY new product I used. Allergic? NO! You skin is sensitized to the product or products you have been using.
The very first time I used Mary Kay, my skin got so red it scared the you-know-what out of the woman holding the party. She panicked and told me to only do one side of my face. Yes, over time, it subsided, but it took about a week of using the product for my face to get used to Mary Kay products. It was NOT an allergic reaction. It just meant that I have sensitized skin. Do you? Most likely. An allergic reaction will be MUCH different.
* I also have sensitive skin. I DO have allergic reactions to products. So my skin is sensitive AND sensitized.
Does this make sense to all of you?
Your skin will need to "get used" to products. Many clients will say that they will not get facials because they "break out." This also could mean that the skin is purging. (bringing out or exacerbating an issue that is already there) Bringing out more pimples, for example.
If you get a rash with hives and wheals, this is sensitive skin. (just one example) There could be an ingredient that is causing you an allergic reaction.
Next-- and I am not going to want to cause a war here, but why would anyone want to buy products from a home party where the person selling the product knows NOTHING about skin care? I guarantee you if you tell any home party demonstrator that you have sensitive skin, she will believe you. BUT, in reality, you have sensitized skin. Does she know if you are oily/dry or just oily? Most people think that if someone has acne that they have oily skin. Right? Well, more times than not, their skin is so dry, but yet they have acne. The person selling the product needs to know the DIFFERENCE. And there IS a difference. Anyone selling skin care should be educated in skin care. Remember, if they are not licensed for skin care, most likely they cannot touch your skin.
Products need to be RESULTS ORIENTED. Are your home parties results oriented?
**Example: one of my clients had used Arbonne. She came here and RAVED how much this "all natural" product made her skin feel so clean. So, I asked her--- what was it that made her skin "feel so clean?" She said-- the smell! OMG... Smells do not make the skin clean. It is a good part of the sensory issue that makes us WANT to use the product, but do good smelling things make the skin clean? They could, but the smells are the selling points. BTW--- Arbonne is NOT all natural.
You want products that are going to do things for your skin.
Will you pay more for results oriented products? Of course. If you skimp there, you are wasting money. What are you willing to do to get and keep nice skin? Do you tan? Well, get over it! No amount of skin care is going to help skin that is so ruined by the sun and tanning beds. There is plastic surgery, but that is a temporary fix. You can lessen the effects of damage with results oriented products, but if you continue to tan, well, why waste your money? What about smoking? That is another culprit for all those nasty lines by our mouth. Again, a results oriented product can help, but you need to WANT to change habits to get your skin on track.
WHEW!!!  Sorry for the length of this, but I really want all of you to see that there is more to skin care than many think.
Yesterday I got a new client for waxing. She uses Mary Kay. Her skin was awful. I am sorry to say that. Her makeup was soooo clogged in her pores. I told her that she needs to rethink her regimen. I finished her and then applied my JI mineral makeup and you could not see those pores at all. It looked like the makeup just settled in those holes on her face and not around it. What can her MK seller tell her? Use more makeup? She would look awful. I want my clients to look good. And, I have the education to show them how.
Why are we all on here, this list? To get better educated and learn more about our craft. Right? Well, why would you not take the time to get knowledgeable about your skin? You skin is very important. I know I care about mine. Let me help you care about yours.
(in the past week, I have gotten many compliments on my skin as well as people thinking I am younger than my real age. Not bragging here--not my style--but I swear, I swear--- it is my skin care and makeup that does it for me. Find what is going to give you--- I said it over and over--RESULTS ORIENTED PRODUCTS!!!)
Here's to healthy and beautiful skin,
tu amiga,
Lynnette

Arbonne is not considered a professional line. It is
an MLM.  I think most licensed estheticians would
agree that is not the direction to take if you want to
have a successful skin care program in a spa or a
salon.  There are many great lines and several trade
magazines that you can look through to review product
lines.  Such as:

www.lneonline.com
www.dermascope.com
www.dayspamagzine.com

Having trade magazines are also a tax write off so a
win win situation for any therapist.

Also, attending trade shows are an excellent
opportunity to meet with companies and receive
samples.

Good luck!

Bad laptop, sorry

Therefore, they cannot afford to put SKIN CHANGING ingredients in their products to sufficient degree in order to avoid lawsuits.
They CAN put barrier hydration in their products, as can Este Lauder and others, which makes a great deal of difference if that is what you need.
They also cannot AFFORD to put enough of the good technology in their products as they are set up MLM - multi-level lines must pay too many people to do this. Their price points do not support enough good technology and ingredients if they have to pay all these people AND the company!
BTW, 35%-80% of some products is low dollars - if the cost is low, how can it be a decent percentage?

There is more, but oh well. This will not be the last time I have to say this = if you are a professional, get a professional line. You will get the training and good products that you need to change the skin - legitimately.

Professional lines and Arbonne no comparison.   If you are a doctor or esthetician and work at a medical spa or high end spa, you should not be using a line that anyone can buy from anyone anywhere.

Lynette, I totally disagree with you. I think you should take a STRONG look
at your attitude as well as your knowledge before voicing your opinion on
something you obviously have no knowledge of. I will be glad to educate you
anytime on skin care as well as how Arbonne does and will continue to back
up their products. And you obviously don't know anything about MLM. I will
be glad to supply you also with a list of VERY reputable Dermatologists and
Doctors, not skin care specialist that highly recommend ARBONNE!!!!!

Dear Kelly,

This list has an excellent reputation for those professionals in the skin
care industry who truly appreciate and respect other people’s opinions.  I
believe that your post is totally without regard for the standards that we
here at the SkinTech list abide by.  We do not denigrate others intelligence
or educational background here, but gently inform, while maintaining our own
opinions without flaming posters.

As professionals, we also maintain a high degree of skepticism relating to
people pushing product lines that do not maintain a degree of
professionalism themselves.  You will see us voice our strong opinions of
those product lines that may be purchased at Sephora, Nordstrom or Neiman
Marcus, while they still maintain that they are “professional” products,
just as we may all have opinions one way or another about whether MLMs may
be professional simply because a doctor recommends them.  We all have
opinions – they are like noses…everybody has one; but we will not abide by
disrespect of our fellow professionals.

Sincerely,

Laura Root, CST, CIDESCO Diplomate

Lynette, I totally disagree with you. I think you should take a STRONG look
at your attitude as well as your knowledge before voicing your opinion on
something you obviously have no knowledge of. I will be glad to educate you
anytime on skin care as well as how Arbonne does and will continue to back
up their products. And you obviously don’t know anything about MLM. I will
be glad to supply you also with a list of VERY reputable Dermatologists and
Doctors, not skin care specialist that highly recommend ARBONNE!!!!!

Subject: SkinTech:: Re: Product Lines

Nicole,

It is my policy to not ever sell anything in my salon that anyone can get at
home parties.

We just had this discussion on the Nailtech List.

Most of the Arbonee reps are NOT educated in skin care. They cannot give a
skin analysis with no knowledge.

If my clients can get it at a home party, it will not be sold in my salon.

Here is what I wrote to the Nailtech List:

***********

I am not sure how much all of you know about skin care. I do not claim to be
the walking book of knowledge on it, but please let me tell you a few
things.

* MANY women think that when they use a new product that they are
&quot;allergic&quot; to it. I used to think that and my skin would react to ANY new
product I used. Allergic? NO! You skin is sensitized to the product or
products you have been using.

The very first time I used Mary Kay, my skin got so red it scared the
you-know-what out of the woman holding the party. She panicked and told me
to only do one side of my face. Yes, over time, it subsided, but it took
about a week of using the product for my face to get used to Mary Kay
products. It was NOT an allergic reaction. It just meant that I have
sensitized skin. Do you? Most likely. An allergic reaction will be MUCH
different.

* I also have sensitive skin. I DO have allergic reactions to products.
So my skin is sensitive AND sensitized.

Does this make sense to all of you?

Your skin will need to &quot;get used&quot; to products. Many clients will say
that they will not get facials because they &quot;break out.&quot; This also could
mean that the skin is purging. (bringing out or exacerbating an issue that
is already there) Bringing out more pimples, for example.

If you get a rash with hives and wheals, this is sensitive skin. (just
one example) There could be an ingredient that is causing you an allergic
reaction.

Next-- and I am not going to want to cause a war here, but why would
anyone want to buy products from a home party where the person selling the
product knows NOTHING about skin care? I guarantee you if you tell any home
party demonstrator that you have sensitive skin, she will believe you. BUT,
in reality, you have sensitized skin. Does she know if you are oily/dry or
just oily? Most people think that if someone has acne that they have oily
skin. Right? Well, more times than not, their skin is so dry, but yet they
have acne. The person selling the product needs to know the DIFFERENCE. And
there IS a difference. Anyone selling skin care should be educated in skin
care. Remember, if they are not licensed for skin care, most likely they
cannot touch your skin.

Products need to be RESULTS ORIENTED. Are your home parties results
oriented?

**Example: one of my clients had used Arbonne. She came here and RAVED how
much this &quot;all natural&quot; product made her skin feel so clean. So, I asked
her--- what was it that made her skin &quot;feel so clean?&quot; She said-- the smell!
OMG... Smells do not make the skin clean. It is a good part of the sensory
issue that makes us WANT to use the product, but do good smelling things
make the skin clean? They could, but the smells are the selling points.
BTW--- Arbonne is NOT all natural.

You want products that are going to do things for your skin.

Will you pay more for results oriented products? Of course. If you skimp
there, you are wasting money. What are you willing to do to get and keep
nice skin? Do you tan? Well, get over it! No amount of skin care is going to
help skin that is so ruined by the sun and tanning beds. There is plastic
surgery, but that is a temporary fix. You can lessen the effects of damage
with results oriented products, but if you continue to tan, well, why waste
your money? What about smoking? That is another culprit for all those nasty
lines by our mouth. Again, a results oriented product can help, but you need
to WANT to change habits to get your skin on track.

WHEW!!!  Sorry for the length of this, but I really want all of you to
see that there is more to skin care than many think.

Yesterday I got a new client for waxing. She uses Mary Kay. Her skin was
awful. I am sorry to say that. Her makeup was soooo clogged in her pores. I
told her that she needs to rethink her regimen. I finished her and then
applied my JI mineral makeup and you could not see those pores at all. It
looked like the makeup just settled in those holes on her face and not
around it. What can her MK seller tell her? Use more makeup? She would look
awful. I want my clients to look good. And, I have the education to show
them how.

Why are we all on here, this list? To get better educated and learn more
about our craft. Right? Well, why would you not take the time to get
knowledgeable about your skin? You skin is very important. I know I care
about mine. Let me help you care about yours.

(in the past week, I have gotten many compliments on my skin as well as
people thinking I am younger than my real age. Not bragging here--not my
style--but I swear, I swear--- it is my skin care and makeup that does it
for me. Find what is going to give you--- I said it over and over--RESULTS
ORIENTED PRODUCTS!!!)

Here's to healthy and beautiful skin,

tu amiga,

Lynnette

I would also recommend the Image products. Excellent results and retails
well. Their customer service and reps are great.  I use some products to
fill in the line (toners, less active masks, moisturizers) from a few
companies; Gunilla of Sweden, Aesthetics Unique (Reviva Labs) and Halina
Andre. All have no or low minimums. Not much on sales support, but always
available to answer product questions.

My favorite is DermaQuest Skin Therapy. It is a result oriented  product.
They have a product manual and an ingredient CD. There is usually  some one in
the office to answer your questions.

Things have really improved this year for this company before there was no
manual and product sheets was placed in your order according to what you
ordered. I love the manual all products are listed with protocol.

Samples were very seldom given..... Now samples are given with each retail
item.

Samples were very very expensive....Now very very reasonable.
I have only attended one of there classes. They were only in Florida once
that I know of.

There is no minimum order with Skin Therapy.

_ www.skintherapydq.com_ ( http://www.skintherapydq.com )

I like Agera's masks. My favorite is the Hydrating Mask.

I order from a distributor who emailed me the manual.
I don't have the email address to the distributor.  It's on my  computer at
the spa. I'm home today.

If you are just getting back into the business I would suggest  you:
Subscribe to Los Nouvelle's, Skin inc, and Dermascope.
Read the calendars in the Skin Care magazines and plan to attend  classes and
shows close to you..
Network on sites such as this one.
Get an Cosmetic Ingredient Book
Decide what would you like your client to say about your services to  someone
else.
Study and Study.
Hands on 'Hands on.......

I was very fortunate to attend Janet's Survival Class... Twice...   Life
changing......

&lt;How about others jumping in for this new esty?&gt;

Ill jump in here   :)
I use (and really like) DeCleor.  I find wonderful  results.  pros~extensive
offerings for cleansers, treatment oils, masks and  moisturizers
cons~they really need a new retail  exfoliant!  While their professional exfoliant is
really nice and  effective, their retail one needs some 'upping' (in my
opinion)  This is  our flagship line we use and I REALLY like it.

Now for some input on other lines I have  used~
Eminence~nice line, very 'catchy' for those into the  organic way of
life...dont see huge results when clients are treating a conditon  but a lovely line
for a good cleansing and maintenance treatment....love their  cleansers, their
hydrosols, their treatment masks but hate their  moisturizers!  Except the
stonecrop gel!  Absolutely adore their  SunDefense powders.  Body product line is
nice too.  Who doesnt like  to get carrots, parsley, cucumbers, roses,
apples, pears and peaches slathered  on their skin, to pique their senses?     :)

Jurlique~another 'natural, organic' line but very  limited for any type of
results oriented treatments.  Very basic line~nice  products for relaxation
treatments.

dr Hauschka~another 'natural' line (and this one can be  bought over the
counter but has a big 'cult following')  Nice products but  again, if your looking
for results~look elsewhere.  Good for relaxation  treatments and for clients
looking for 'natural' treatments.  Extensive  line of bodycare, shampoos,
conditoners, body/massage oils etc.  Love their  powders and aromatics.  A nice
line of organic makeup too  (lipsticks,  foundations etc)

MD Skincare~we use this as our 'acid' treatment.   Lovely results in the
professional peel. Nice results with the  at-home peel products.  Love their
tinted moisturizers (with  SPF)  Not a big fan of their eye creams.

Somme~another acid based line we use~might see better  results than the MD
Skincare line but for some reason we do more of the MD  treatments than the
Somme!  Products can be a bit tacky and heavy feeling  but their serum/moiturizer
contain a vitamin infusion which give better  long-term results.  The MD acid
treatment gives a quicker 'feel good  result' but Somme gives better longterm
benefits.  Could it be that the MD  line has a more 'appealing' packaging
look?  Somme comes in plain, white,  no frills packaging.  Gotta love the basic
appeal but wonder if people  gravitate towards the more 'professional packaging
look' of the MD line?   Somme has done extensive research on the reduction in
sundamage/hyperpigmentation with their product use---impressive results!
Ive had my UV picture taken by them (scary and frightening)--and now that Im
talking about it, I think Id better get back to using my  Somme!

Naturopathica~nice line--love their pumpkin peel!   Havent used them
extensively but have liked what I used.  Great  body/massage oils.  Love their
exfoliant.  My SIL uses their line in  her spa and has nothing to say but good stuff
about them.

Looks like their is no ONE line that fits the needs of  everyone!

I love DermaQuest also - POSSIBLY their problems from the past are being resolved? It would take a lot.

Thank you for your endorsment of the Survival Skills class, DeBorah. BTW, the classes may be 'alive' again - a large school system in Florida may be doing the three day one once or twice yearly. We shall see. If any of you wish to know about them if they do them, let me know. It may influence their decision! Email me privately?

I wonder how the Arbonne person would feel about Arbonne after attending that class??? LOL.....

HI All,

I will weigh in with this.  Since I have moved to Florida from New  England,
I have found that one line I see a lot here is Intaglio.  I am  using it in
the two jobs that I have right now, I love it.  I see results,  reduction in
apperance of lines and wrinkles, great for acne, education is good,  going to a 2
day class in Orlando this weekend.  They have a nice vitamin C  serum and
Vitamin A emollient that are both awesome in my opinion.  The  only thing I don't
like are the masks.  You only have two to work with and  they are both clay
based, so don't have much leeway there, but am investigating  other lines with
better masks.
I have also used GM Collin, I liked it when I used it, but its been years
and its changed a lot from what I understand.

Hi Janet,

Regarding Agera, I usually use the distributor in Texas and speak with
Kristina.  James M referred me a few years ago.  Unfortunately I've stopped
purchasing that much from them in the last year.  They were aquired by
another owner and I wasn't that happy with the changes.  If I can find one
of my old invoices in my tax papers, I'll post the address &amp; phone number.

You will get great answers from the peo on this board! Many have a LOT of
experience, unlike so many of the other boards that are mostly new persons -
NOT that I am pointing the finger and new professionals! I am just saying,
there is a lot of experience on this one.

First, what kind of line do you want? Relaxation? Results oriented? In my
view NO line exists that does both well. Let us know, and we can give you
our opinions!

I am fine with not being in CA, and my knee - the reason for not going, is finally over the replacement and I am whining less. Will be ready to do more than sit (train) in short order.
I will post on the board if the negs finish for the class. The problem is the length - three days is longer than most schools will do. We shall see.

Thanks for your interest. It is a non-product related class, even more so than before as I am finding more products are coming available for use ingredient-wise.

HI All,

I will weigh in with this.  Since I have moved to Florida from New England, I have found that one line I see a lot here is Intaglio.  I am using it in the two jobs that I have right now, I love it.  I see results, reduction in apperance of lines and wrinkles, great for acne, education is good, going to a 2 day class in Orlando this weekend.  They have a nice vitamin C serum and Vitamin A emollient that are both awesome in my opinion.  The only thing I don't like are the masks.  You only have two to work with and they are both clay based, so don't have much leeway there, but am investigating other lines with better masks.
I have also used GM Collin, I liked it when I used it, but its been years and its changed a lot from what I understand.

Don't know if this helps or not, just my 2 cents.

where did you get the eminence. I used it and I got
really good results, but I ordered it from the Canada
office.

--- Aura0 ... @aol.com wrote:

&gt; &lt;How about others jumping in for this new esty?&gt;

&gt; Ill jump in here   :)
&gt; I use (and really like) DeCleor.  I find wonderful
&gt; results.  pros~extensive
&gt; offerings for cleansers, treatment oils, masks and
&gt; moisturizers
&gt; cons~they really need a new retail  exfoliant!
&gt; While their professional exfoliant is
&gt; really nice and  effective, their retail one needs
&gt; some 'upping' (in my
&gt; opinion)  This is  our flagship line we use and I
&gt; REALLY like it.

&gt; Now for some input on other lines I have  used~
&gt; Eminence~nice line, very 'catchy' for those into the
&gt;  organic way of
&gt; life...dont see huge results when clients are
&gt; treating a conditon  but a lovely line
&gt; for a good cleansing and maintenance
&gt; treatment....love their  cleansers, their
&gt; hydrosols, their treatment masks but hate their
&gt; moisturizers!  Except the
&gt; stonecrop gel!  Absolutely adore their  SunDefense
&gt; powders.  Body product line is
&gt; nice too.  Who doesnt like  to get carrots, parsley,
&gt; cucumbers, roses,
&gt; apples, pears and peaches slathered  on their skin,
&gt; to pique their senses?     :)

&gt; Jurlique~another 'natural, organic' line but very
&gt; limited for any type of
&gt; results oriented treatments.  Very basic line~nice
&gt; products for relaxation
&gt; treatments.

&gt; dr Hauschka~another 'natural' line (and this one can
&gt; be  bought over the
&gt; counter but has a big 'cult following')  Nice
&gt; products but  again, if your looking
&gt; for results~look elsewhere.  Good for relaxation
&gt; treatments and for clients
&gt; looking for 'natural' treatments.  Extensive  line
&gt; of bodycare, shampoos,
&gt; conditoners, body/massage oils etc.  Love their
&gt; powders and aromatics.  A nice
&gt; line of organic makeup too  (lipsticks,  foundations
&gt; etc)

&gt; MD Skincare~we use this as our 'acid' treatment.
&gt; Lovely results in the
&gt; professional peel. Nice results with the  at-home
&gt; peel products.  Love their
&gt; tinted moisturizers (with  SPF)  Not a big fan of
&gt; their eye creams.

&gt; Somme~another acid based line we use~might see
&gt; better  results than the MD
&gt; Skincare line but for some reason we do more of the
&gt; MD  treatments than the
&gt; Somme!  Products can be a bit tacky and heavy
&gt; feeling  but their serum/moiturizer
&gt; contain a vitamin infusion which give better
&gt; long-term results.  The MD acid
&gt; treatment gives a quicker 'feel good  result' but
&gt; Somme gives better longterm
&gt; benefits.  Could it be that the MD  line has a more
&gt; 'appealing' packaging
&gt; look?  Somme comes in plain, white,  no frills
&gt; packaging.  Gotta love the basic
&gt; appeal but wonder if people  gravitate towards the
&gt; more 'professional packaging
&gt; look' of the MD line?   Somme has done extensive
&gt; research on the reduction in
&gt; sundamage/hyperpigmentation with their product
&gt; use---impressive results!
&gt; Ive had my UV picture taken by them (scary and
&gt; frightening)--and now that Im
&gt; talking about it, I think Id better get back to
&gt; using my  Somme!

&gt; Naturopathica~nice line--love their pumpkin peel!
&gt; Havent used them
&gt; extensively but have liked what I used.  Great
&gt; body/massage oils.  Love their
&gt; exfoliant.  My SIL uses their line in  her spa and
&gt; has nothing to say but good stuff
&gt; about them.

&gt; Looks like their is no ONE line that fits the needs
&gt; of  everyone!

I do not use the lasers, the doctor does. I can use microdermabrasion cyrstals trained by the doctor first, I can use AWT cellulite buster. And of course I do peels and facials.  The doctor just opened this practice, she was in family medicine for 13 years.
Talk to you later!
Always wanted to get my CEDESCO, but had 5 kids to raised, I was divorced.
Worked daytime as a Admin, nights and weekends as makeup artist.

Peace

I received my esthetics license in 1994.  I was selling Aloette at nights and weekends.  I was in the corporate world as an Admin Asst. for over 10 years. Raised 5 children, divorced.  That is why I did not get my CIDESCO, had too much responsibility and no money to go back to school.  I manage the medical spa, do microderm, facials, AWT cellulite buster.  The doctor does all our laser services and injections.

12 years-great! A guru! How did you get into med esthetics? How were you trained, or did you go to a course? We are always wanting the scoop on that on this board!

Subject: SkinTech:: Re: Product Lines

HI All,

I will weigh in with this.  Since I have moved to Florida from New England, I have found that one line I see a lot here is Intaglio.  I am using it in the two jobs that I have right now, I love it.  I see results, reduction in apperance of lines and wrinkles, great for acne, education is good, going to a 2 day class in Orlando this weekend.  They have a nice vitamin C serum and Vitamin A emollient that are both awesome in my opinion.  The only thing I don't like are the masks.  You only have two to work with and they are both clay based, so don't have much leeway there, but am investigating other lines with better masks.
I have also used GM Collin, I liked it when I used it, but its been years and its changed a lot from what I understand.

Don't know if this helps or not, just my 2 cents.

I am grateful for having my CIDESCO, Diane - it was quite an experience and
I learned a lot. However, do you really need it where you are? Does your MD
even  know what it is?

I did not want a CIDESCO because I needed it, just wanted it because I wanted to know more personally.
No, my Doctor did not know what it was, I told her it is like having your masters in skin.
Doctor's do not need to know what it is, not their expertise.
My boss is not a dermatologist, she is a D.O., been in family practice for 13 years, has worked at major hospitals in the area as an emergency room head.  When they go into this business, they go to school for lasers, skin care, anatomy of skin etc. and train especially in medical spa services.
Some doctors have added a medical spa to their practices, some eye doctors, some plastic surgeons, family practice, etc.

Gotcha about the CIDESCO - it was very eye opening!
Are you pleased with what you are doing at the docs? How busy are you,  since
is just opened? Did she do much marketing?

I have done most of the marketing. We cannot afford a  full-time marketing
person at this time. (the doctor, myself, and a part-time  marketing/reception
ist person)

I have gotten 8 "Curves" on board, we go and give a slide show  presentation
of our services, before and after photos. And after session is over  a
question and answer session. The doctor and I go to the "Curves" together. I  bring
all members a little gift to take home and info.  We also give a gift
certificate for a free microdermabrasion a $110.00 value in a drawing the night  of
the event and every month I send a "Curves" another certificate for them to
give away as they please. The "Curves" have a sign up sheet for people who want
to attend, we do the sessions when they are closed midday. The doctor and I
and our receptionist have walked the neighborhood introducing ourselves to all
the businesses and offer the managers a free microdermabrasion.  We run
specials on botox, offer refreshments at our location if someone brings 4 people
they get their botox at half price.
We have done mailings thorough a service that identifies age  group in area
and income. Only a 2% return on 3 mailings.  Post cards were  very beautifully
designed by professionals.
We have left flyers and a little treat on hundreds of cars at  nearby nice
restaurants, we advertise in different newspapers, have a web site.  Hit the
bridal salons, boutique's, gyms, schools, etc. Give donations to all  surrounding
schools and events. We are working on doing a TV promo soon. Check  out our
web site:
_ www.dermaviveonline.com_ ( http://www.dermaviveonline.com )  Thanks for your
interest.  Oh, by the way, yes I enjoy what I do, manage, marketing,
receptionist, cleaning  lady, admin duties, hostess, etc. It is a challenge since the
last spa I managed  was a high end spa in Maryland, I managed 25 employees, but
they were the only  game in town and had a great reputation and everyone had a
full book. I managed  there, wedding planner, esthetics when the other
estheticians were busy, did  events, etc. This business is start up and not the only
game in  town.

Your marketing ideas are great! And I like the website, also. I'd have  never
thought of Curves, but it sounds like a really good idea!
When you say you only had 2% return on your direct mail, what are the
numbers on that? I mean 2% of 100 is 2, but 2% on 5000 is 100 - which would  build a
great clientele with their referrals, over time. (2% is pretty normal,
actually, for direct mail....)
Your bkgrnd is very interesting!

The spa I worked at in FL had a good relationship with Curves... we  actually did free skin care analysis at special pre-arranged sessions  which was a great hit.

2% return on a postcard mailing specifying age and income demographic  only is an average return.  Not bad... and usually this type of  mailing is relatively inexpensive.

Stay creative, and you will stay ahead of the game!

Janet,
I have done things with my local Curves. Brought NOTHING. The clientele at this one is not the type to come and get their nails done or facials either.
I would head for the more upscale gyms to get those type of women. Curves just does not cut it.
buenos noches,
Lynnette

It worked for me, I think it depends on the clientele of the  local Curves.

Everyone I have spoken too in small business told me 2%  meaning feedback. We
never got a booked client with the mailings, only ads, ads,  ads, and my
doctor is very good at what we say in our ad to bring on who we want  like: Hot
lips and then the ad (promoting permanent makeup at that time) with  hair
removal (Smoothie) and the photo of a girl on the beach for legs. Not  waxing hair
reduction. And then for botox, Get Carded and then verbiage and  photo. We pick
out photos of a person about late 30's early 40's models. Real  world people.
We are good at brainstorming the doctor and I.
Am I giving away our secrets? ha, ha  I think we are all  here to help one
another.
Thanks for the compliments.

The "Curves" thing is not something we are only doing, from  our experience,
it depends on each Curves clientele and owner who will promote  you. And for
us the sign up was good, they feel it is important and need an  appointment and
we do not waste our evenings or days going to a Curves who does  not get a
positive feedback from their clients. As far as the high end work out
businesses,  they are hard to promote, corporate will not let them keep  your flyers or
brochures in the place or promote you. Some Curves have motivate  clientele
and owners and events going on all the time others have a clientele  that are
just not interested. The age range is perfect for botox,  microdermabrasion,
facials, peels, laser anti-aging, hair removal, cellulite AWT  buster. Not
everyone has the money and not covered by insurance  either.

Diane,
Yes, in my original post I said *this one*--meaning the one near me. If you are not going to a chain gym, then I think it would be a good thing. My Curves is not a good place for me to get business. This particular Curves has tanning beds!!! Sorry, I do not promote tanning!! She also sells Avon. That is the type of clientele she has at this one. I am sure in your area, which is close to the Main Line, would attract people to your office. That is wonderful!! I am about an hour from you and this is not the area that would bring me that business. &lt;SIGH&gt; Wish I was in an area that had a large income base.
Oh, Jan--- did you catch the link I had the other day? It is a link to a page that has MLM information. It was quite interesting to read and I had to get off it or I would have spent HOURS on that website just reading all about MLM's!!!
buenos dias,
Lynnette

Diane,
Just curious as to why you would not use your clients as the models. The real thing. Show the before and after results.
When I research, this is what I want to see.
You could offer a free service if they would be your testimonial.
