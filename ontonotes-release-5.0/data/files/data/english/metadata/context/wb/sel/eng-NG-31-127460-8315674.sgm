Vietnamese, Lao forces searching rice paddies and mountains and
shooting on sight.
LOS ANGELES, August 7 (Compass Direct News) -- Soldiers, police and
others have killed at least 13 Christians in Laos in the past month in
a swarming crackdown on Hmong villagers falsely accused of stirring
rebel dissent, sources told Compass.
In the sweep, encouraged by communist village leaders and others who
have falsely accused the Christians of being separatist rebels,
authorities have arrested and imprisoned about 200 members of a 1,900-
strong Laos Evangelical Church in Ban Sai Jarern village, Bokeo
province in northwestern Laos.
The hunted Christians are largely Hmong refugees who had fled
persecution in Vietnam. Those killed include Hmong who went into
hiding when joint forces of Vietnamese and Lao police began rounding
up Christians falsely accused of supporting Gen. Vang Pao in August
2006.
Among those killed last month was Neng Mua, a Christian who slipped
back to his native Fay village after hiding in the mountains from the
police round-up. On July 7 he went to a local villager's house to beg
for food, but his one-time friend instead shot him dead as a suspected
member of the &quot;liberation army,&quot; a Christian source said.
Police have searched intensively for Christians in rice fields and
mountains and are shooting them on sight, said the source, who
requested anonymity.
&quot;Many Christians were killed and badly injured,&quot; he said. &quot;Women and
children were arrested and sent to prison.&quot;
On July 8, police shot Seng Wue to death by a roadside after he and
other Christians suffering fatigue and hunger had come out of hiding
and surrendered, according to Christian sources. The sources heard
report of soldiers shooting two other Christians dead at a checkpoint
on the road to Don Sawan village, but their names were still
unconfirmed.
On July 13, soldiers reportedly shot to death a person resembling Jong
Wue Lao, a committee member of the Ban Sai Jarern church. He had
escaped authorities on July 3, though his whereabouts were unknown.
Soldiers reportedly killed eight to 10 Christians in the incident, but
sources said it was unclear whether those deaths included Lao and his
companions.
On July 12, police arrested Jue Por Wang, head of the Ban Fay church,
and Wang Lee Wang, head of the Ban Sawan church. A Christian source
said police forced members of their churches to declare that the
leaders and others on police target lists were funded by Vang Pao to
train Christians to fight the government.
In May and June, about 100 soldiers from Vietnam, along with
authorities from Laos and Vietnam, arrived in Ban Sai Jarern to look
for Hmong Vietnamese. There were 600 to 800 Lao soldiers and 200
Vietnam soldiers deployed in Bokeo province as of July, Christian
sources said.
Soldiers have secured Ban Sai Jarern and nearby communities and
prohibit people from entering or leaving, sources said. As a result of
the restrictions, they said, the Ban Sai Jarern church has not been
able to meet for worship.
With the area swarming with soldiers and police, many area men fled on
July 4 out of fear of further reprisals or imprisonment, sources said.
Those who escaped to the mountains have sent word that there is no
food; they have resorted to eating banana leaves to survive.
Lao and Vietnamese officials have imprisoned an estimated 52 families
from five villages: Ban Sai Jarern, Huay Klay, Fay, Numsamork and Chai
Pathana. That is nearly all of the known Hmong families from Vietnam
in the greater area, including 30 Hmong families in Ban Sai Jarern.
Hostile to Christians
Members of the Ban Sai Jarern church, which also serves worshippers
from Fay and five other villages, said the congregation has never in
anyway cooperated with Vang Pao or anyone seeking a separate state.
&quot;We are law-abiding citizens,&quot; one church member said, &quot;and we want to
present our case through legal means, not through armed struggle.&quot;
Vietnamese and Lao communist authorities have long been hostile to the
Hmong since previous generations aided U.S. forces during the Vietnam
War. Associating Christianity with the United States, authorities
assume all Hmong Christians support Vang Pao, who fought alongside
U.S. soldiers.
&quot;Christianity is not an American religion, it is a universal
religion,&quot; said one source. &quot;We are not a political group seeking
independence from the present Lao government -- on the contrary, we
are actively engaged in building a better nation by faithfully
adhering to the teachings of the Bible.&quot;
In June, U.S. authorities arrested Vang Pao and nine associates in
California over an alleged plot to topple the communist regime in
Laos.
Fast-growing churches in Bokeo province, Christian sources said, have
drawn the ire of both Lao and Vietnamese governments for providing aid
to Christian Hmong refugees from Vietnam and others fleeing
persecution in other parts of Laos. Until this past year, they said,
the 4,000 Hmong Christians in Bokeo had not faced persecution.
The crackdown in Ban Sai Jarern stems from an August 2006 capture in
Vietnam of two Hmong women who had returned from the village to visit
parents-in-law and other relatives, sources said. Vietnamese officials
sent them to prison but were unable to force them to divulge the
locations of other Vietnamese who had fled to Ban Sai Jarern and other
villages in Laos.
On October 5, Lao and Vietnamese officers went into Sai Jarern
village, seized five leaders of churches in Vietnam who had fled to
Laos and sent them back to Vietnam. One of the church leaders, Saoma
Lao, is reportedly dead, but area Christians have not confirmed that
information. He was chairman of the Christian Church in Geahkoh
village in Vietnam before fleeing to Laos.
Christians sources have confirmed that another one of the five Hmong
Christian leaders, Jongneng Yang, is alive. But his condition and
whereabouts, like that of the other leaders, are unknown. The others
missing are Jue Lao, Thayeng Lei and Lei Yang, a church youth leader.
Chaicheng Lee, a teacher and treasurer of the Ban Sai Jarern church,
is also missing. Christian sources said police arrested the 38-year-
old church leader on July 4 after raiding his home and taking
documents containing names of church leaders, members and activities.
Area Christians said police were forcing detained believers to declare
that Pastor Lee was training Christians funded by Vang Pao to
overthrow the government.
Police took Pastor Lee out of prison on July 16, Christian sources
said, adding that no one knows where they took him.
Enemies of the Faith
Accusing the Christians of armed rebellion and disclosing their
whereabouts are local village heads, communist committee members and
others hostile to Christians. Sources said these local opponents urged
police to send the Christians to prison.
For every 10 to 15 Christian families in a given village, they said, a
local leader monitors their whereabouts and activities, especially
when they leave the area. Besides accusing the Christians of joining
forces with Vang Pao and being part of an &quot;American religion,&quot; local
villagers have charged them with dealing drugs and breaking religion
laws.
&quot;We were never engaged in the use or selling of illegal drugs,&quot; said
one area Christian. &quot;And even people who want to become Christian
after receiving healing, we advise them to first inform the government
about their intention to become Christians, and after they receive
their permit that's the only time we accept them.&quot;
Furthermore, he added, the churches secure permits for all large
gatherings, and they even invite officials to join their
celebrations.
&quot;We appeal to the Lao government to release our imprisoned brothers
and sisters, for they are innocent of the charges against them,&quot; he
said. &quot;We appeal to the Lao government to grant Christians the freedom
to worship God and give them the rights due to them.&quot;
Local Christians, closely monitored by the government, are not allowed
to use mobile phones, obtain food or leave the village without
permission, a Christian source said.
&quot;All these restrictions are imposed for suspicion that they will
contact Gen. Vang Pao and the other Christian escapees,&quot; he said.
Christians are prohibited from worshipping together and fear that
police will besiege the church. Area villages are under tight police
control. Authorities are still pursuing Christian leaders who escaped
and are following closely Christians who go to other villages, sources
said.
The Christians said there are about 50 refugees living near the border
with Thailand who need food and water; they are &quot;broken because their
wives and children are in prison.&quot;

Dear Friends,

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From what I am aware of is that there were incidents including armed
">

clashes which occured on 5 - 10 July 2007 in Ban Saychaleun and Fai in
Houaysai district, Bokeo province following a raid conducted by Anti-
Narcotic Police to dismantle a gang of over thirty illicit drug
traffickers when the traffickers opened fire on Police Force. The
small group of anti-narcotic police had to call for back-up which help
to encircle the houses used by the gang and there were shooting
occured which caused four deads and several injured among the
traffickers and also several injured among the police forces. The Lao
Norcotic Police also arrested most of the traffickers for
interrogation.

If it is this incident which had been used by some ill-intended Hmong
group (FFC) which try to make up thing, I think that the story we can
read here is the most fantaisist story I ever come accross.

&gt; Vietnamese, Lao forces searching rice paddies and mountains and
&gt; shooting on sight.
&gt; LOS ANGELES, August 7 (Compass Direct News) -- Soldiers, police and
&gt; others have killed at least 13 Christians in Laos in the past month in
&gt; a swarming crackdown on Hmong villagers falsely accused of stirring
&gt; rebel dissent, sources told Compass.
&gt; In the sweep, encouraged by communist village leaders and others who
&gt; have falsely accused the Christians of being separatist rebels,
&gt; authorities have arrested and imprisoned about 200 members of a 1,900-
&gt; strong Laos Evangelical Church in Ban Sai Jarern village, Bokeo
&gt; province in northwestern Laos.
&gt; The hunted Christians are largely Hmong refugees who had fled
&gt; persecution in Vietnam. Those killed include Hmong who went into
&gt; hiding when joint forces of Vietnamese and Lao police began rounding
&gt; up Christians falsely accused of supporting Gen. Vang Pao in August
&gt; 2006.
&gt; Among those killed last month was Neng Mua, a Christian who slipped
&gt; back to his native Fay village after hiding in the mountains from the
&gt; police round-up. On July 7 he went to a local villager's house to beg
&gt; for food, but his one-time friend instead shot him dead as a suspected
&gt; member of the &quot;liberation army,&quot; a Christian source said.
&gt; Police have searched intensively for Christians in rice fields and
&gt; mountains and are shooting them on sight, said the source, who
&gt; requested anonymity.
&gt; &quot;Many Christians were killed and badly injured,&quot; he said. &quot;Women and
&gt; children were arrested and sent to prison.&quot;
&gt; On July 8, police shot Seng Wue to death by a roadside after he and
&gt; other Christians suffering fatigue and hunger had come out of hiding
&gt; and surrendered, according to Christian sources. The sources heard
&gt; report of soldiers shooting two other Christians dead at a checkpoint
&gt; on the road to Don Sawan village, but their names were still
&gt; unconfirmed.
&gt; On July 13, soldiers reportedly shot to death a person resembling Jong
&gt; Wue Lao, a committee member of the Ban Sai Jarern church. He had
&gt; escaped authorities on July 3, though his whereabouts were unknown.
&gt; Soldiers reportedly killed eight to 10 Christians in the incident, but
&gt; sources said it was unclear whether those deaths included Lao and his
&gt; companions.
&gt; On July 12, police arrested Jue Por Wang, head of the Ban Fay church,
&gt; and Wang Lee Wang, head of the Ban Sawan church. A Christian source
&gt; said police forced members of their churches to declare that the
&gt; leaders and others on police target lists were funded by Vang Pao to
&gt; train Christians to fight the government.
&gt; In May and June, about 100 soldiers from Vietnam, along with
&gt; authorities from Laos and Vietnam, arrived in Ban Sai Jarern to look
&gt; for Hmong Vietnamese. There were 600 to 800 Lao soldiers and 200
&gt; Vietnam soldiers deployed in Bokeo province as of July, Christian
&gt; sources said.
&gt; Soldiers have secured Ban Sai Jarern and nearby communities and
&gt; prohibit people from entering or leaving, sources said. As a result of
&gt; the restrictions, they said, the Ban Sai Jarern church has not been
&gt; able to meet for worship.
&gt; With the area swarming with soldiers and police, many area men fled on
&gt; July 4 out of fear of further reprisals or imprisonment, sources said.
&gt; Those who escaped to the mountains have sent word that there is no
&gt; food; they have resorted to eating banana leaves to survive.
&gt; Lao and Vietnamese officials have imprisoned an estimated 52 families
&gt; from five villages: Ban Sai Jarern, Huay Klay, Fay, Numsamork and Chai
&gt; Pathana. That is nearly all of the known Hmong families from Vietnam
&gt; in the greater area, including 30 Hmong families in Ban Sai Jarern.
&gt; Hostile to Christians
&gt; Members of the Ban Sai Jarern church, which also serves worshippers
&gt; from Fay and five other villages, said the congregation has never in
&gt; anyway cooperated with Vang Pao or anyone seeking a separate state.
&gt; &quot;We are law-abiding citizens,&quot; one church member said, &quot;and we want to
&gt; present our case through legal means, not through armed struggle.&quot;
&gt; Vietnamese and Lao communist authorities have long been hostile to the
&gt; Hmong since previous generations aided U.S. forces during the Vietnam
&gt; War. Associating Christianity with the United States, authorities
&gt; assume all Hmong Christians support Vang Pao, who fought alongside
&gt; U.S. soldiers.
&gt; &quot;Christianity is not an American religion, it is a universal
&gt; religion,&quot; said one source. &quot;We are not a political group seeking
&gt; independence from the present Lao government -- on the contrary, we
&gt; are actively engaged in building a better nation by faithfully
&gt; adhering to the teachings of the Bible.&quot;
&gt; In June, U.S. authorities arrested Vang Pao and nine associates in
&gt; California over an alleged plot to topple the communist regime in
&gt; Laos.
&gt; Fast-growing churches in Bokeo province, Christian sources said, have
&gt; drawn the ire of both Lao and Vietnamese governments for providing aid
&gt; to Christian Hmong refugees from Vietnam and others fleeing
&gt; persecution in other parts of Laos. Until this past year, they said,
&gt; the 4,000 Hmong Christians in Bokeo had not faced persecution.
&gt; The crackdown in Ban Sai Jarern stems from an August 2006 capture in
&gt; Vietnam of two Hmong women who had returned from the village to visit
&gt; parents-in-law and other relatives, sources said. Vietnamese officials
&gt; sent them to prison but were unable to force them to divulge the
&gt; locations of other Vietnamese who had fled to Ban Sai Jarern and other
&gt; villages in Laos.
&gt; On October 5, Lao and Vietnamese officers went into Sai Jarern
&gt; village, seized five leaders of churches in Vietnam who had fled to
&gt; Laos and sent them back to Vietnam. One of the church leaders, Saoma
&gt; Lao, is reportedly dead, but area Christians have not confirmed that
&gt; information. He was chairman of the Christian Church in Geahkoh
&gt; village in Vietnam before fleeing to Laos.
&gt; Christians sources have confirmed that another one of the five Hmong
&gt; Christian leaders, Jongneng Yang, is alive. But his condition and
&gt; whereabouts, like that of the other leaders, are unknown. The others
&gt; missing are Jue Lao, Thayeng Lei and Lei Yang, a church youth leader.
&gt; Chaicheng Lee, a teacher and treasurer of the Ban Sai Jarern church,
&gt; is also missing. Christian sources said police arrested the 38-year-
&gt; old church leader on July 4 after raiding his home and taking
&gt; documents containing names of church leaders, members and activities.
&gt; Area Christians said police were forcing detained believers to declare
&gt; that Pastor Lee was training Christians funded by Vang Pao to
&gt; overthrow the government.
&gt; Police took Pastor Lee out of prison on July 16, Christian sources
&gt; said, adding that no one knows where they took him.
&gt; Enemies of the Faith
&gt; Accusing the Christians of armed rebellion and disclosing their
&gt; whereabouts are local village heads, communist committee members and
&gt; others hostile to Christians. Sources said these local opponents urged
&gt; police to send the Christians to prison.
&gt; For every 10 to 15 Christian families in a given village, they said, a
&gt; local leader monitors their whereabouts and activities, especially
&gt; when they leave the area. Besides accusing the Christians of joining
&gt; forces with Vang Pao and being part of an &quot;American religion,&quot; local
&gt; villagers have charged them with dealing drugs and breaking religion
&gt; laws.
&gt; &quot;We were never engaged in the use or selling of illegal drugs,&quot; said
&gt; one area Christian. &quot;And even people who want to become Christian
&gt; after receiving healing, we advise them to first inform the government
&gt; about their intention to become Christians, and after they receive
&gt; their permit that's the only time we accept them.&quot;
&gt; Furthermore, he added, the churches secure permits for all large
&gt; gatherings, and they even invite officials to join their
&gt; celebrations.
&gt; &quot;We appeal to the Lao government to release our imprisoned brothers
&gt; and sisters, for they are innocent of the charges against them,&quot; he
&gt; said. &quot;We appeal to the Lao government to grant Christians the freedom
&gt; to worship God and give them the rights due to them.&quot;
&gt; Local Christians, closely monitored by the government, are not allowed

First of all, PDR gvmnt have to be aware of Hmong Christian  people.
PDR internal secret polices have  to come after and track down their
activity with high scrunity. Again, I have nothing  against  Christian
people. Don't count me wrong. But, remember PAT ROBINSON-a Christian
TV angor- called for US gvmnt to&quot;overthrow and  assasinate&quot; Venezuela
president. He has no business to say that. Behind the &quot;iron curtain&quot;,
Christian people have another political agenda.
We got to enforce law and maintian law and order. I would render my
decision that the killing is &quot;JUSTIFIABLE&quot;.
Terrorist would do every thing to &quot;DESTABLELIZE&quot; Laos even under the

What ever Carl Marx said, it is dying with him.  Only small number of

Yes, you are  right  Meng Chut Chee. Do not &quot;RUSH&quot; to the final
conclusion that this person is DKJ and that person is Thanouxay. You
can tell the way this individual talked and the way he/she employed
the element style of wrinting. Don't rush to the final conclusion like
GWB rush to go to war in Iraq.....because it will come back and hunt

Only an idiot, like you, needs to learn how to think before saying
anything. I am smart enough to understand who's who, no need IP's
check.  What I said above was a trap to lure you into it. I told you
nicely that Brushoff was not DKJ, don't rush to the conclusion. You
didn't want to listen to me, you forced your bully head to accuse all
the MEO to be bad weeds. You've tried to provoke a civil war in SCL
here. Now you recognize that a DKJ is a DKJ and so a MEO like me is
not your brain killer either.

You owe a MEO like me an apology, don't try to intimidate me with your
family this and that.

If there is an IQ test between  you and me, I would say you will
loose me. I am very confident.
Dam ass. Don't start talk trash to me again. I do not think you are
good enough
for me to spend my &quot; VALUABLE TIME&quot; to talk to you. I have an another
issue to deal with.
You and I are in the different side of the coin. What appologize? Whom
I should apologize?
You are not in my radar screen  at all. Don't you ass see that I cause
trouble in SCH? If you do, tell me
when? Your people need to respect  the right of another people. Don't
be blind dum.. Where are your ETHICS?
May be you smoked to much opium and lost them all. That is why Lao
Phouan can get along with your
people. I do understand his reasons. Just stay away from me.

&gt; Dear Friends,

&gt; &gt;From what I am aware of is that there were incidents including armed

&gt; clashes which occured on 5 - 10 July 2007 in Ban Saychaleun and Fai in
&gt; Houaysai district, Bokeo province following a raid conducted by Anti-
&gt; Narcotic Police to dismantle a gang of over thirty illicit drug
&gt; traffickers when the traffickers opened fire on Police Force. The
&gt; small group of anti-narcotic police had to call for back-up which help
&gt; to encircle the houses used by the gang and there were shooting
&gt; occured which caused four deads and several injured among the
&gt; traffickers and also several injured among the police forces. The Lao
&gt; Norcotic Police also arrested most of the traffickers for
&gt; interrogation.

&gt; If it is this incident which had been used by some ill-intended Hmong
&gt; group (FFC) which try to make up thing, I think that the story we can
&gt; read here is the most fantaisist story I ever come accross.

&gt; Sok dee

----------------------------------------------
There are more Hmong extremist network world wide,
Including Doctor, Lawyer, Professor, Supervisor and
other or-or but none of them were among those 11
caught by the ATF, something is significant missing
there. I hope LPDR lean from the past and take action
seriously or otherwise our young generation will have
handful of solving Hmong problem in the future, that
guaranteed will never end until Hmong get their ways
or Hmong get ass-kick and scattered away…
