Why are mothers absent from the families in so many of Shakespeare's

Largely, I imagine, because the company had only a few boy actors
available for the female roles. If the story only needed &quot;a parent&quot;,
then a father was easier to go with.

That helps, thanks. I wonder if the sixteenth-century mortality rate for
women in childbirth might also have somethng to do with the relative
absence of mothers in families in Shakespeare's plays. Are there perhaps
any sociological figures for the typical configuration of an Elizabethan
English family? What about the Bard's own family when he was a child?

If Kit Marlowe wrote them, there is an explanation
if he is the son of William Parr, and a girl who would have
died when Kit was about 1 year old. William Parr
himself died when Kit was about 7. (leaving no Will, *apparently*.)

Of course the Marlowes were alive when Kit reached adult life.

It could also be that Shakespeare simply found two-parent families
boring. ^_^ There are a number of plays where a character's father and
mother both appear, but the mother is usually overshadowed by another
female character (e.g., in Romeo and Juliet, where Lady Capulet is
upstaged by Juliet's Nurse, and in Merry Wives of Windsor, where Mistress
Page is upstaged by Mistress Quickly and Mistress Ford). Even The
Winter's Tale, a play in which the mother is an important character in
her own right, she is offstage for much of the play, while Paulina
becomes the predominant female character.

It's also interesting to note that in plays where Shakespeare wrote a
particularly memorable mother, the *father* is dead (e.g., All's Well
that Ends Well, Coriolanus, Titus Andronicus, Hamlet). It does seem as
though Shakespeare preferred to write for single parents.

As for the absence of moms in Shakespeare, there are a few
plays with widows such as RIII, Coriolanus, and maybe
MWW. Lear is like the western &quot;Bonanza&quot; where Ben has three
girls instead of boys and no one wants to know what happened.
Hey, King Cymbeline gets a new wife before the play. Some of
the plays become the pursuit of a wife, such as TS, TN, and MfM.
When it is an important parent, it does seem to be a king, such
as in LLL, we don't care about the princess' mom. Here's an
absent mom who reappears: Hermione. Henry VIII lost a lot of
possible moms due to sudden queen death syndrome (sqds).

Meanwhile, there are some absent dads: Antony helps little with the
kids; his new wife Octavia cares for his previous kids as Antony
parties. So, Antony helps explain absent moms: they are partying.
Prospero is the one not home--what happened to his wife?
We wish Othello was absent.

Greg Reynolds

I just learned this distantly related (okay, not at all) fact so I
thought I better pass it on. The &quot;Caesarian Section&quot; is generally
believed to have come about because that is the method by
which Caesar was born. However, in that age, the method
of cutting into the mother was nearly always fatal, and since
it was known that Caesar's mother was alive during his life,
it is doubtful he was delivered by that method. What is more
likely is that Caesar decreed that all young were to be taken
from sick, dying, or dead women in order to constantly build
the population and the army.

It's probably much more because mothers were
usually politically unimportant in Tudor and pre-
Tudor England. They only rarely had power or
influence. Our author was passionately interested
in that area so, inevitably, he tended to ignore them.

Another factor is probably that the plays were, to
some extent, written for the monarch, and she had
no interest in motherhood. In fact, any emphasis
on the topic might well have been taken by her as
a slur or a criticism. It was a duty she rather
conspicuously avoided.

Also, of course, the author also had relatively little
contact with his mother. After his father died
(when he was 12) he went to live in the house of
Lord Burghley. His mother remarried quickly (so
we get the bitter reference to the 'hasty marriage'
following quickly on the father's funeral in Hamlet).
No doubt, his being largely ignored by his mother
hurt somewhat.

But then in Tudor aristocratic families, mothers did
not have a lot of contact with their sons.

Possibly. It is important to remember that this
high mortality rate was almost entirely among
the upper classes -- who could afford the (fatal)
attentions of the medical profession.

I agree with John W. Kennedy, partly also because I read something to that
extent in one of those Shakespeare biographies. I posted an &quot;article&quot;
on HLAS a while back called &quot;Loving Mothers&quot; or something, discussing
that.

Older women can be portrayed more easily by men, but a young mother -
in her thirties - would be harder to play by an all-male cast, if her
part were a serious one, which is why youngish mothers have so little
dialogue.

I disagree with Paul Crowley, because the mothers in Shakespeare are
seldom cold, or ignoring their offspring, on the contrary, no matter
how they are towards their spouses, they are caring and loving towards
their children.

If Shakespeare had been an Italian, perhaps his mothers would have been
more predominant figures - but even in his Italian plays they sort of
tend to melt into the woodwork.

I don't know whom you're talking about now. Mary Arden Shakespeare

In one respect, this site makes a major mistake, assuming that, because
the Montagues and Capulets are _supposed_ to be upper-class, they
accurately represent the upper class. The author is sensible enough to
see that they are more English than Italian, but has not perceived that
they are far more middle-class than noble.

That sort of goes with the trend toward motherless daughters (noticeably more
than motherless sons) if there were a limited source of actors playing females.

I also think it may have something to do with the characters of the females who
are motherless. What would Beatrice's or Katherine's mum have to say or do?
Where would Lear's queen fit in?

Having grown up motherless myself, I might be tempted to assign a certain
independent spirit to go along with that, but it certainly wouldn't be
scientific.

&quot;Furthermore, even if it turned out that the queen was capable
of conceiving, she might not survive her pregnancy, for death
in childbed was frighteningly commonplace. It has been
estimated that there was a rate of mortality of perhaps twenty-
five deaths per 1,000 births, and as an older woman the risk
to Elizabeth would have been even greater. To make matters
worse, it was frequently remarked upon that ladies in the upper
reaches of society were more likely to die in labour than their
social inferiors, for whereas &quot;poor women, hirelings, rustics
and others used to hard labours, also viragoes and whores,
who are clandestinely delivered, bring forth without great
difficulty, and in a short time after rising from their bed return to
their wonted labours ... women that are rich, tender and beautiful
and many living a sedentary life, as though they partaked of the
divine curse after a more severe manner, bring forth in pain,
and presently after their delivery lie in an uneasy and dangerous
condition&quot;. The reason for this was probably that the poor were
spared the attentions of the doctors, which meant that unlike
their grander counterparts they did not have to undergo such
treatments as having their bellies wrapped in the fleece of a
freshly skinned sheep, or the skin of a hare flayed alive. The fact
that it was standard practice for midwives to stretch and dilate
the genital parts, cutting or tearing the membranes with their
fingers if they thought it necessary, helps explain why deaths
from sepsis and puerperal fever were so appallingly frequent.
Even those women who survived the delivery were by no means
out of danger, for they were actually weakened by the
recommended methods of convalescence, which entailed lying
in bed for a long time in a dark hot room, living on liquids and
repelling the milk with poultices. The risks of childbirth are
illustrated by the fact that in the queen's immediate family
circle, her grandmother Elizabeth of York, and her stepmothers
Jane Seymour and Katherine Parr died having babies, and all
three of the Duke of Norfolk's wives had succumbed in the
same way. &quot; ('Elizabeth I&quot; by Anne Somerset pp. 311/2)

It may be mothers are absent because Shakespeare had a hierarchy and
as women, unless they were essential to the plot of the story, were
not important enough they were omitted. Fathers were used instead as
they were men and were seen as more important than women and were
