Report: Pentagon Has 3-Day Plan to Knock Out Iran's Military

THE Pentagon has drawn up plans for massive airstrikes against 1,200
targets in Iran, designed to annihilate the Iranians’ military
capability in three days, according to a national security expert.

Alexis Debat, director of terrorism and national security at the Nixon
Center, said last week that US military planners were not preparing for
“pinprick strikes” against Iran’s nuclear facilities. “They’re about
taking out the entire Iranian military,” he said.

Debat was speaking at a meeting organised by The National Interest, a
conservative foreign policy journal. He told The Sunday Times that the
US military had concluded: “Whether you go for pinprick strikes or all-
out military action, the reaction from the Iranians will be the same.”
It was, he added, a “very legitimate strategic calculus”.

President George Bush intensified the rhetoric against Iran last week,
accusing Tehran of putting the Middle East “under the shadow of a
nuclear holocaust”. He warned that the US and its allies would confront
Iran “before it is too late”.

One Washington source said the “temperature was rising” inside the
administration. Bush was “sending a message to a number of audiences”,
he said ? to the Iranians and to members of the United Nations security
council who are trying to weaken a tough third resolution on sanctions
against Iran for flouting a UN ban on uranium enrichment.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) last week reported
“significant” cooperation with Iran over its nuclear programme and said
that uranium enrichment had slowed. Tehran has promised to answer most
questions from the agency by November, but Washington fears it is
stalling to prevent further sanctions. Iran continues to maintain it is
merely developing civilian nuclear power.

Bush is committed for now to the diplomatic route but thinks Iran is
moving towards acquiring a nuclear weapon. According to one well placed
source, Washington believes it would be prudent to use rapid,
overwhelming force, should military action become necessary.

Israel, which has warned it will not allow Iran to acquire nuclear
weapons, has made its own preparations for airstrikes and is said to be
ready to attack if the Americans back down.

Alireza Jafarzadeh, a spokesman for the National Council of Resistance
of Iran, which uncovered the existence of Iran’s uranium enrichment
plant at Natanz, said the IAEA was being strung along. “A number of
nuclear sites have not even been visited by the IAEA,” he said. “They’re
giving a clean bill of health to a regime that is known to have
practised deception.”

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president, irritated the Bush
administration last week by vowing to fill a “power vacuum” in Iraq. But
Washington believes Iran is already fighting a proxy war with the
Americans in Iraq.

The Institute for the Study of War last week released a report by
Kimberly Kagan that explicitly uses the term “proxy war” and claims that
with the Sunni insurgency and Al-Qaeda in Iraq “increasingly under
control”, Iranian intervention is the “next major problem the coalition
must tackle”.

Bush noted that the number of attacks on US bases and troops by Iranian-
supplied munitions had increased in recent months ? “despite pledges by
Iran to help stabilise the security situation in Iraq”.

It explains, in part, his lack of faith in diplomacy with the Iranians.
But Debat believes the Pentagon’s plans for military action involve the
use of so much force that they are unlikely to be used and would
seriously stretch resources in Afghanistan and Iraq.

What happens after your airstrikes isn't going to be a quagmire.

It's going to be a total fucking disaster, on land and sea.

And in your neighborhood.

Make sure to invest in a manual bicycle pump -- you'll need it.
And candles.  Lots and lots of candles, and firewood.

Guns and ammo, too.

I can't help but remember that the United States launched &quot;massive
airstrikes&quot; against little Serbia, including fighter bombers, stealth
bombers, ship launched missiles, and B-52 high-altitude carpet
bombing.  For 79 consecutive days without letup, the U.S. military
forces dropped explosives, phosphorus bombs, bunker busters, fuel
bombs, cluster bombs, napalm, and everything they had short of nuclear
bombs.  The U.S. destroyed schools, hospitals, hotels, water treatment
plants, railroads, bridges, and everything else they could locate.
When it was all over, the Serb military was practically untouched
except for about a dozen damaged Serb tanks.

I suppose they think the Iranians will just keep their fighters
grounded to allow the attack, and all those Iranian anti-ship missiles
along the coast of the Persian gulf will just sit there while the U.S.
launches sorties from those aircraft carriers sitting out there well
within range like targets at an arcade.

The only chance the United States has of knocking out the entire
Iranian defense in one strike is if Bush employs nuclear weapons, and
even then it's not a sure thing.  Nuclear weapons are powerful but
only over a relatively small area.

But even if the attack is successful, the United States will have
other enemies to worry about.  An all out attack on Iran will probably
result in the overthrow of the governments of Saudia Arabia, Egypt,
and Pakistan.  Then the United States will face a few billion
insurgents and no U.S. ground forces to speak of unless the United
States reinstates the draft.

And that tells us that another major &quot;terrorist&quot; attack must occur in
the United States soon.  The U.S. citizens will only allow a draft if
the U.S. is attacked.  It will have to be a major attack--a nuclear
attack, and it should happen before the next election shapes up,
before any popular alternative leadership appears on horizon.  That
is, of course, unless one of the warmongering candidates like Clinton,
Obama, Thompson, McCain, or Giuliani show a commanding lead.  Then the
&quot;terrorist&quot; attack will probably happen right after the election like
it did with Bush.

And the new AIPAC puppet in the White House will declare a
&quot;catastrophic emergency,&quot; take control of the country with the
generous help of thousands mercenaries provided by Blackwater and
Dyncorp, draft thousands of helpless young Americans and send them
overseas to fight terrorists while Homeland Security confiscates all
civilian weapons and clamps down on ammunition to insure internal
peace, and impounds a few &quot;dissidents&quot; in the hundreds of FEMA centers
scattered over the country.  And our glorious president, with the help
of his private mercenary army, will bring peace to the United States
and protect us all from terrorist attacks while our brave soldiers go
off to die in the Middle East.

If we focused, at least initially, just on military installations, I

If there is a major terrorist attack in the US, I do not believe a draft
will be necessary. In WWII men were climbing over the top of each other

I'm saying the Albanians need to go back to Albania. Period. The Muslims
invaded Kosovo in the 15th century and subjected the Christian population
to dhimmitude and servitude. It's not Mulsim land - so yes, we should have
helped the Serb army kick out the Albanians and the terrorist group, the
KLA who were killing Christnans, burning chuches etc.

Re: Alex Cockburn in The Nation last week, Francis Boyle and this
widely disseminated piece of speculation,
http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2369001.ece
THE Pentagon has drawn up plans for massive airstrikes against 1,200
targets in Iran, designed to annihilate the Iranians' military
capability in three days, according to a national security expert.

Alexis Debat, director of terrorism and national security at the Nixon
Center, said last week that US military planners were not preparing
for &quot;pinprick strikes&quot; against Iran's nuclear facilities. &quot;They're
about taking out the entire Iranian military,&quot; he said.

Debat was speaking at a meeting organised by The National Interest, a
conservative foreign policy journal. He told The Sunday Times that the
US military had concluded: &quot;Whether you go for pinprick strikes or
all-out military action, the reaction from the Iranians will be the
same.&quot; It was, he added, a &quot;very legitimate strategic calculus&quot;.&lt;SNIP&gt;

Just like (LaRoucheite) Russian General Leonid Ivashov who a couple
of months ago predicted a US military strike on Iran down to the
precise hour it was to commence, Alexis Debat has been exposed as a
fraud, in the last 24 hrs. See the google hits below, from ABC News,
NYT, Mother Jones, Daily Kos, etc. Faked academic credentials and
faked interviews with Sen. Obama, Speaker Pelosi, Bill Gates, Alan
Greenspan, former UN Gen. Sec. Kofi Annan.

I don't think anyone would be so stupid..

The resulting reduction of oil exports from the Gulf to zero would
surely screw the world economy beyond belief.

&quot;Mich&quot; doesn't understand that Iran MUST export oil to get the money to BUY
gasoline because Iran only refines about 10% of its oil to gas....
