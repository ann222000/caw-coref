Her commercial for Revlon lipstick, where she applies the lipstick and
then makes a pseudo-sexy kissy face a la TWANS. She looks like an
idiot. Does she really need the money that bad? I guess so, since all
her movies have TANKED!

Agreed.

I just don't get her appeal. She's not all that good looking. She
comes across as not all that bright. And marriage after marriage after
marriage where she claims the man is the problem makes you wonder.
After all, when you look at the common denominator in every one of her
relationships, it's her.

Top that off with the fact that she ain't that good an actress - at
least in any of the movies I've seen her in. Her Oscar win had more to
do with shaming Hollywood into giving it to her in a year with no real
good female roles than the actual movie in which she acted.

I've always figured her career had more to do with whom she beds than
any actual talent or box office draw.

Ask an adult to 'splain it to you, child. Your misspelling is in
the subject line, for all the world to laugh at.

I don't think she's hot either, however I operate under the impression
that pretty much everything that happens in Hwd depends on whom you bed,
rather than talent.

That's why I like the MUTE button on my remote.I turn off the sound of
all tv commercials, or switch channels.I am mighty fast at turning off
radio commercials too.I HATE all commercials.I don't give a damn what
they advertize, I HATE them all.
