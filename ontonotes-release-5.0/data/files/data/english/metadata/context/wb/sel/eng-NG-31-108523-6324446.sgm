E=mc2   not quantitatively confirmed in bombs exploded on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki in 1945 ? There is no data how much mass (m) is destroyed
and how much energy is emitted (E).

(i)   Robert Serber (member of first American team entered
Hiroshima and Nagasaki in September 1945 to assess loses),     has
indicated [1]   that the efficiency of "Little Boy" weapon [U235 ,
49kg ] that was used against Hiroshima   was about 2%   only.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------
[1]   Serber , R The Los Alamos Primer (U.S. Govt. first published as
LA1, April 1946),
declassified 1965 , annotated   book , 1992. also   R
. Serber (editor) , The Los Alamos       Primer   pp. 38 (Univ. of
California Press, 1992)

(ii) It is assumed that all the atoms don't undergo fission, thus
material is wasted. But no such waste material is specifically measured
quantitatively.
Thus the waste material (nuclear reactor or weapon) must be measured
and corresponding energy is calculated. Only then efficiency will be
explained, why it is 2%
(iii) But no measurements and calculations have been done till date.
Until such calculations and measurements are done specifically, it
cannot be said that E=mc2 is quantitatively confirmed in such cases.
The more information in this regard can be found and issue can be
discussed  at

You are right. In labs E=mc2 is confirmed and regarded as standard. The
mass annihilated and energy emitted is consistent with E =mc2.

I have no doubt about it, no disbelief.  It is alright.
But the truth is an equation must be confirmed in all cases
specifically.
In nuclear explosion
See the authentic reference
[34]  Serber , R The Los Alamos Primer (U.S. Govt. first published as
LA1, April 1946),
declassified 1965 , annotated  book , 1992. also  R . Serber
(editor) , The Los Alamos    Primer  pp. 38 (Univ. of California Press,
1992)

In case of nuclear explosions, neither mass annihilated is measured nor
energy emitted.
Thus application of E=mc2 , is not  QUANTITATIVE , it is simply
qualitative.

Should scientists not try to confirm E=mc2  in such cases
quantitatively?
Let us speculate, if results are not consistent then equation E =
Ac2 M, can be used.
In science there are many equations which are obeyed in certain cases
not others. This proposal is also logical, as in heavily phenomena
energy emitted in exceptionally-2 high.
Also it is not confirmed chemical reactions, see standard literature.
This is the theme of post.

They have had many measurements of energy release.  Bolometers,
earthquake detectors, radiation detectors, spectral analysis,
even thermal decay of underground chambers.

A scary thing is to drive on a road that suddenly turns 90
degrees, sweeps a wide arc, then turns another 90 degrees.  They
tested too close to the surface, and the radiation prevented them
from repairing the road...

&gt;From my part there is no denial or misunderstanding or ignorance of the
">

existing experimental and theoretical facts about E=mc2.

(i) In nuclear explosion  various forms of energies( heat , light,
sound energy, energy in form of invisible radiations is emitted. ) are
emitted.

(ii) Realistically Einstein’s E=mc2 is only meant for
light energy- mass conversions.
Light  energy is emitted by body  , mass of body  decreases.
Then it is speculated for
heat energy
sound energy etc.

(iii) In nuclear explosions various types of energies are emitted
simultaneously. There is no harm if E=mc2 is precisely confirmed in
nuclear explosions. It is not done till.
See the authentic reference
[1]  Serber , R The Los Alamos Primer (U.S. Govt. first published as
LA1, April 1946),
declassified 1965 , annotated  book , 1992. also  R . Serber
(editor) , The Los Alamos    Primer  pp. 38 (Univ. of California Press,
1992)

(vi) Also in Chemical reactions , E=mc2 is not confirmed at all. It
must be done in scientific spirits.

(v) Also there are  3 decades old observations in nuclear fission of
certain elements
then energy emitted is not consistent with E=mc2.
[1].  Hambsch, F.J.   et al.   Nucl. Phys.A, 491,p.56 (1989)
[2].   Thiereus,  H.  et al., Phys. Rev. C, 23 P 2104 (1981)
[3]  Bakhoum, E. G.   Physics Essays, Vol.15, No 1 2002
(Preprint archive : physics/0206061)

So if E=mc2 is precisely confirmed in nuclear explosions and chemical
reactions, then it will help in better understanding of the equation.
In case of any deviation a new equation E = Ac2 m     is
speculated or suggested.
This is the theme of post.

Good. That's settled, then.

The idiot Einstein tried to make it

E = mc^2/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)

and said
"thus when v = c, E becomes infinite"

so we can ignore that ignorant lunatic, right?

Well, many things Einstein did by intuition or instinct.
Due to this reason his mathematical aspects of his work can be
re-discussed.

You have rightly quoted from his paper of STR that
"thus when v = c, E becomes infinite"
In the same
Einstein even discuss v = -c (Negative of speed of light)

This paper is available at www.AjayOnLine.us

There are some similar aspects of derivation of L=mc2
Light Energy mass equation
from which later on E=mc2 was speculated.

Such aspects can also be discussed  at above website.

Why discuss idiocy unless you are psychologist?

But ok, let's discuss his mathematics. How far is it from
A to A and how long does it take to get there?
http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/figures/img7.gif

"It follows, further, that the velocity of light c cannot be altered by composition with a velocity less than that of light. For this case we obtain

http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/figures/img76.gif "

So why does he do it?

" But the ray moves relatively to the initial point of k, when measured in the stationary system, with the velocity c-v, so that

http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/figures/img31.gif "

and

http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/www/figures/img22.gif

You can't derive Eq 76 without Eq 22, but Eq 76 says you cannot use c+v

in Eq 22. That's known as the grandfather paradox.

The idiot was clearly an idiot.

Dear Smith

Can you give references of you statement?
In my opion it is not justified.

You have written that
+"mass deficit" of a mole of electrons and protons, and the mass
of H-1 hydrogen.  All measured quite carefully.  And the
resultant is light.+

What is mole?
What is "mass deficit" of one mole of electron and proton.
Does one mole of electrons and protons for H-1 hydrogen?
Is it light?

Kindly quote the reference and share with us. Thanks

The hiroshima bomb was only half the power expected this is because the
fireball expanded in about 100 milliseconds and the effect was to slow down
the reaction and reduce the yeild.

The mass of uranium was far less than stated by the poster. Fat boy and
little boy are fiction. The bomb was tucked into the pocket of a parachute
flare and tossed out of the bomb bay of the enenor grey by hand. The bomb
was set of my an altimeter and set so the bomber had time to get clear, my
dad in a chase reconnicance aircraft wondered what hit him and was badly
tossed about as was the elenor grey.

My Japanise friends grandfather was the spotter who witnessed the parachute
flare and then went to tea just before the bomb exploded.

I personally aplologised. I then told her how my uncle was treated in
Japanise prison camp in singapore and how al his mates were bayonetted to
death with their own bayonets while they slept in the jungle stop over.

In fact the critical mass of uranium 235 is less than 5 g. You can work it
out from the yeild of hiroshima (20 KT TNT) and the mass defect. U&gt;Sr+Cs add
up the masses on each side and (stable isotopes - published in standard
tables). Take the difference and multiply by c^2 to get the yeild per mole
and work backwards.

I used to make them you know. A little cottage industry, after about a week
they said I had mad too many  we don't want too many of those things. It is
like handling lead, there is little yellow deposit caused by oxidation. We
sometmes we had accidents when they fell on the floor, if two fell on top of
each other they "fizzed".

One bloke there took five of these things to isael as samples and people
often just went missing.

It was albert einstien who invented them and then spent his life regretting
it, the same applies to my boss prof rotblat and edward teller who used fred
hoyles astrophysics to invent the h -bomb. Unfortunately it cannot be
uninvented.

The critical mass calculation is a five line affair. I hated my job and
became a washer up instead.

Then they started killing my friends - I do not know why, but it upsets you.

We have even better ones now.... smaller, cheaper, lighter for a couple of
dollars you can destroy a city.

They murdered 3 of my my wifes, and four other girls I know well and
skewered mum's brain with a knife.

That is the brits, shrinks and christians did that, you can go off people
you know.

The brits are terrible liers you know and they are very good at murder.

&gt; E=mc2   not quantitatively confirmed in bombs exploded on Hiroshima

&gt;            (i)   Robert Serber (member of first American team entered
&gt; Hiroshima and Nagasaki in September 1945 to assess loses),     has
&gt; indicated [1]   that the efficiency of &quot;Little Boy&quot; weapon [U235 ,

&gt; . Serber (editor) , The Los Alamos       Primer   pp. 38 (Univ. of

&gt; (ii) It is assumed that all the atoms don't undergo fission, thus
&gt; material is wasted. But no such waste material is specifically measured
&gt; quantitatively.
&gt; Thus the waste material (nuclear reactor or weapon) must be measured
&gt; and corresponding energy is calculated. Only then efficiency will be

&gt; (iii) But no measurements and calculations have been done till date.
&gt; Until such calculations and measurements are done specifically, it

In nuclear explosions
energy is emitted in form of heat energy, light energy, sound energy
etc.

How to confirm E=mc2 quantitatively in such cases?
We need to measure all types of energies ( heat, sound, light etc.)

We need to measure 'mass annihilated'

Only measuring these two quantities E=mc2 will be specifically
confirmed in such cases.

Other method would be to measure all types of energies (heat energy,
light energy, sound energy) produced during nuclear explosion.

Then finding out how much mass actually, annihilated.
Finally applying equation
Energy emitted = (mass annihilated) c2

This mass- energy inter conversion equation is regarded as universally
true.
Thus my simple suggestion is that it must be specifically confirmed in
all possible cases.

If some derivations are confirmed then more generalized equation
dE =Ac2dm
must be analyzed.

The blast effect of a bomb falls as the inverse cube of the distance, heat
and light as the inverse square of the distance.

I once know the value of the critical mass,  used it time I cut a critical
mass off the sheet, I do a caculation using the thickness (remember it is
thinner near the edge) of the sheet and compute the diameter to make the
value they gave us, just slightly more than the critical mass, if you made
it too small intentionally they had a firing squad ready.

They do have the joke that every nown again they drop one an it gets trod on
and the fireball makes a big hole and vapuourise the team.

Plutonium, I'm the discoverer and the namer and I worked out the critical
mass after some experiments with fast neutrons from a mini nuclear reactor
made from a couple of unused atomic bombs.

You are lying.  I have provided the direct measurements in kg and
grams where you can verify the mass deficit in a CHEMICAL
REACTION yourself.  The recombination of an electron with an H+
ion occurs in Nature.  But you will not do this.  You figure that
if you insist on more complex reactions, you can extend the life
of your "theory", and sell your "book" a little longer.

Since you are only peddling cracked pots, have no interest in
learning, and I can learn nothing from you, I am done with you.
