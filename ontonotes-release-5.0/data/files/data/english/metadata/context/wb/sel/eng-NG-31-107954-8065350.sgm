&gt; I'm sure you are right and even though I love to cycle, I'm not going to

Jeff is quite right to want to be cautious. I have been telling the members
of these freaking cycling newsgroups for year to be careful when mixing with
motor vehicles. When you are experiencing pain and misery every day of your
life as a result of an accident with a motor vehicle you will just naturally
want to avoid a repeat of that experience.

Bike paths are the way to go and surely in the future there will be
thousands and thousands of miles of such paths everywhere. The fact is that
none of us are safe on the roads and highways where we have to share the
lane with motor vehicles.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Why the hell would anyone except an idiot want to drive these very
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; small distances?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Because I will never share a road again with cars in this country. I
&gt;&gt;&gt; believe that even in Worthington, it isn't safe It may be an
&gt;&gt;&gt; exceptionally low number of people that are involved in bike/car
&gt;&gt;&gt; accidents but trust me, You don't want to be the person on the bike.

&gt;&gt; Look at the numbers of people who get totalled while driving or riding in
&gt;&gt; cars. Â That isn't safe either (especially when they get hit by
&gt;&gt; trucks...).

&gt;&gt; While your own personal misfortune will have an understandably big impact
&gt;&gt; on your risk assessments, it is the case that it's a bad way to play the
&gt;&gt; odds for any subsequent events.

&gt;&gt; I think it has to with the lions considering the frugal bikes mere
&gt;&gt; peanuts.They are still important to the monkey though...

&gt;&gt; RIDING A BIKE COSTS PEANUTS

&gt;&gt; OK, since the lion (for whom &quot;peanuts&quot; is not important) refuses to
&gt;&gt; listen to the monkey asking for bike facilities,* let's scrutinize the
&gt;&gt; secrets ($$$) of the political jungle, where &quot;democracy&quot; is the word
&gt;&gt; of choice...

&gt;&gt; &quot;The highest measure of democracy is neither the 'extent of freedom'
&gt;&gt; nor the 'extent of equality', but rather the highest measure of
&gt;&gt; participation&quot; -A. d. Benoist

&gt;&gt; Then I'd assume that 50% of the American public and 80% of the young
&gt;&gt; who don't vote do not live in democracy. Or perhaps they see it as a
&gt;&gt; waste of time --and money.

&gt;&gt; &quot;Remember the Golden Rule: Those with the Gold, Rule&quot; (saying)

&gt;&gt; &quot;The Best Democracy Money Can Buy&quot; (title of book)

&gt;&gt; And this one...

&gt;&gt; &quot;Freedom is when the people can speak, democracy is when the
&gt;&gt; government listens&quot; -Alastair Farrugia

&gt;&gt; Which explains why bike lanes won't happen in the foreseeable future.

&gt; Your idiotic platitudes aside, the reason why bike lanes won't happen is
&gt; because of democracy, the vast majority of people do not bike and therefor
&gt; do not demand bike lanes. Democracy in action.
">

There are many sidewalks in the old part of my home town, in fact along
every street, whereas there are not so many sidewalks in the newer parts of
town. It is a measure of how far civilization has descended into the abbess
to note the absences of sidewalks.

Some things are worth doing for the sake of civilization regardless of the
hoi polloi who do not know their asses from a hole in the ground. Too much
democracy in action is a recipe for disaster.

We need bike paths going every which way (just as we need sidewalks) and we
also need mass transit going every which way. The main thing we need to get
rid of is the god damn private motor vehicle.

Joe, about once a year I visit a major metro and I am appalled by the
traffic congestion that I see everywhere in those metros. It is simply
insane how we keep piling up motor vehicles on top of motor vehicles.

I believe there is a 12 lane highway going into Washington DC from Maryland
and it is still not enough. God damn it - 12 lanes! Just how fucking stupid
can we get?

I would like to see all private motor vehicles banned forever from a
civilized nation. They reek of the 20th century and we no longer need that
kind of aggravation.

Mass transit is the only solution. Europe had this figured out many years
ago and now we will have to figure it out too. Personally, I have always
liked trolley cars. I remember that the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and
St.Paul) had a fairly good system back in the 40's and 50's.

Exactly so! In fact, we would all be better off to bring back the humble
mule and get rid of our god damn cars.

The motor vehicle is a total abomination. We need to kill it even if we have
to drive a wooden stake through its heart.

The History Channel on Cable TV is showing a series of programs on The
Universe. Â I do not think it would be such a bad thing if a large asteroid

No, it's how people think they have to live because they've been on the
receiving end of massive social engineering by the automotive and oil
industries to benefit the automotive and oil industries.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy

If you ask people whether they *want* to spend the equivalent an a work
week every year sitting in traffic, they'd tell you &quot;no.&quot; Â Except for a
few weirdos. Â I calculated once that if I didn't own a car and pay the
associated costs, I could work four days a week and come out ahead. Â My
compromise is to buy a good used car for cash and replace it every 10
years if needed, and to ride my bike for practical use (going to work,
going to the store, going to visit friends, etc.) when I can.

&quot;Enjoy&quot; is perhaps not the right word, given the endless bitching I hear

congestion caused by our one-car-per-person lifestyle. Â Americans do
like the false sense of independence they get from using a car, I'll

It all has to do with population density. Hey, you want America to be like
it was when we grew up? Then you have to get rid of 150 million people. But
we are now at 300 million and we will soon be at 1 billion the way things
are going. Europe is just ahead of us, that is all. We will have to play
catch up since we cannot control our population.

&gt;&gt; Right, SPEED DIFFERENTIAL. If you ride a bike on a major road, you'll
&gt;&gt; be a sitting duck because the driver behind you --who otherwise is
&gt;&gt; engaged on the phone-- won't expect a vehicle to be travelling 10MPH.
&gt;&gt; And you only got one life, you know. Just like many that went into
&gt;&gt; that predatory war well know.

&gt; Have you been reading the data. Â Being hit from behind is a very rare
&gt; accident on the roads. Â The vast majority of accidents are conflicts at
&gt; junctions. Â In the UK riding on the road is safer than walking on the
&gt; sidewalk as far as being killed by a motor vehicle is concerned. Â In fact
&gt; it is estimated that if you cycled at 15mph for 8 hours a day 365 days a
&gt; year the mean time to a fatal accident would be 8,600 years. Â I think I
&gt; have more important threats to my life to worry about. Â The risk for
&gt; experienced cyclists is 5-8 times lower still while the health benefits
&gt; give regular cyclists a two year increased life expectancy.

&gt; But hey, don't let the facts get in the way of a good scare story.

I never let any so-called facts get in the way of my commonsense. Any idiot
knows that cycling on the highways and byways with motor vehicles can easily
get you killed, whereas walking on a sidewalk is very safe indeed.

Are all the English idiots or just those who post to cycling newsgroups?

PS. I have come to the conclusion that most of you do know what to do with a
fact. You need to treat it with the contempt that it deserves. What matters
is not the fact, but what you THINK about the fact. Please try to get up to
speed, why don't you?

&gt; &gt; It's the 21st century. The government and the economy is set up to

&gt; &gt;&gt; Mass transit is the only solution. Europe had this figured out many years

&gt; It all has to do with population density. Hey, you want America to be like

&gt; we are now at 300 million and we will soon be at 1 billion the way things

Good point but statisticians have largely corrected for that, noting a

People who cannot afford a phone are less likely to be happy with their

Who doesn't have a phone? It's the best technique we have, and errors are
accounted for in the polls. That still doesn't reflect what occured in

Well, actually, the reported margins of error routinely line up with
those for 95% confidence intervals for simple random samples of the same
size.

In non-technical language, if they /hadn't/ taken phoneless people into
account, and used the most common margin-of-error estimate of random
sampling error, in most cases they'd get the _same_ margin of error as
is reported in the press.

I check this a lot, since I routinely use survey reporting in teaching
my statistics classes.

It's not that the pollsters aren't smart, they certainly know that the
phoneless (and the land-line-less) could be a cause of systematic error
in their polls. Â Further, most(!) pollsters have strong incentives to
accuracy (it's what they sell) - they don't want another embarrassment
like calling the '48 race for Dewey over Truman.

On the other hand, with the exception of election predictions, there are
very few opportunities for phone-only polls to be proven wrong because
of missing the phoneless (they will only be compared to other phone-only
polls, seemingly), and you can even argue away weak election predictions.

It's possible that the pros (Gallup, etc) have made estimates that show
that !currently! the land-line-less aren't systematically different
enough (or numerous enough) to make a difference. Â Or it could be that
the problem is being brushed under the rug because there's little to be
done about it.

Dear Brian,

Sorry, but it's common to confuse subjective and objective case.
Whether we-employers or us-employers is correct depends on whether the
phrase is used as the subject or the object of a phrase or clause.

We, the people, are the proud subject of this sentence.

But this sentence refers to us, the people, as merely the object of a
preposition.

Thus we (not us) grammarians write that he (not him) must be goofing
on us (not on-we).

We like to sneer at whoever/whomever . . .

Sorry, not enough information yet--will whoever/whomever be the
subject or the object of the as-yet unknown subordinate clause?

. . . at whoever is dumb enough to screw up niggling little points.
(he is dumb enough, subjective)

. . . at whomever we can catch screwing up niggling little points.
(we can catch him, objective)

A dollar and such expertise (expressed with typical snottiness) is
usually enough to get a cup of hot coffee spilled on your lap by a
waiter who/whom . . .

. . . who (not whom) is annoyed by us jerks.
Subjective case--he is annoyed, not him is annoyed.

. . . who (not whom) we thought would not be annoyed by jerks like us.
Still subjective case--we thought (that) he, not him, would not be
annoyed.

. . . whom (not who) we also failed to tip.
Objective case--we failed to tip him, not he.

Another deadly trap is the linking verb, such as to be, which restates
or renames the subject and therfore uses the subjective case.

Technically, you should reply, &quot;It is I&quot; when someone shouts &quot;Who the
hell's at the door?&quot; The predicate noun takes the objective form, so
only an ill-educated policeman will yell &quot;It is me&quot; before kicking the
door in.

Language, however, is an arbitrary collection of customs, not a
logical system resembling computer programming. The proper grammatical
reply &quot;It is I&quot; is never contracted to &quot;It's I&quot;--we say &quot;It's me,
who'd ya think it was?&quot;

Or perhaps _we_ should say, &quot;It is we&quot;? Aaargh! It's us!

Time to go for my ride before it starts raining, whatever &quot;it&quot; may
refer to.

Cheers,

Carl Fogel

Yes, it is sad that it sounds right to too many of us Americans.

Your problem is that you do not realize that the usage is:

We... do ordain and establish... Â &quot;...the people of the United States of
America&quot; is modifying we, but has nothing to do with why we was chosen over
us. Â We is the subject. Â The dependent clauses in between are also not
relevant to its selection.

For purposes of deciding what pronoun to use, the OP should have truncated
the sentence like this:

&quot;Although I will relocate my business if the whackos down the street
force a mandatory confiscatory wasteful program on we.&quot;

When you do that, it becomes more clearly evident that it is incorrect and
should be:

&quot;Although I will relocate my business if the whackos down the street
force a mandatory confiscatory wasteful program on us.&quot;

Hope this clarifies;

There are some serious analysts who disagree with the presumption of

With the way that most employer provided health care plans treat

That the poll among the well-to-do (those that can afford Lexus and

And the same applies to bikes. Ask the working class if they want to

Typical polling does not correct for those without phones, it usually
just ignores them. Â They are a small sample, but a biased one in such a
pole, since they would tend to be otherwise marginalized, and might be
more disappointed than average in their nonexistent healthcare and so
much more likely to support universal health insurance.

But, they also don't tend to buy the products advertised on the programs
that discuss the poles, so no one cares. Â They probably also don't tend
to vote. Â Rich folks with a lot to lose (so they think) are the ones
pollsters and politicians care about.

Margins of error correct for random anomalies, not systematic ones.
Fundamental statistical assumptions include a random sample, and those
who do not have phones (and, more seriously, those who do not deal with
pollsters on the phone) are not random samples.

Polls are entertainment, not science.

Yes, and the US will never have a free-market health care system,
since there are members of the wealthy elite (health care providers
and insurers) who benefit from gaming the current system.

However, I stand by my statement that the free-market has failed,
since there is no real free-market health care system in the US.

Seeing as it's never really been tried, except perhaps many moons ago when
health care was nowhere near as complex and expensive as it is now, I think
it's hasty to make that conclusion.

There's nothing like a free market healthcare system, or
transportation. MONOPOLY is the law of the land. Remember, &quot;The
greatest sin is competition&quot;
-John D. Rockefeller

There's this person --wealthy person*, military leader, bureaucrat,
whatever-- that sees the need for change. He realizes that the chaos
and insecurity in society, not to mention the lies and the prevailing
injustice, can only bring an end to all... This is NOT a lion, as he
becomes one of us.

However, there's this other person WHO OPPOSES ANY CHANGE FOR THE
BETTER, and WHO WON'T ACCEPT COMPETITION. This is the MONOPOLISTIC or
HUNGRY LION, Satan himself indeed...

* There's people with money --and influence-- who use it for a good
cause. Just an example among the rich and famous: Paul Newman...

&quot;I was campaigning at the University of Cincinnati and they admitted
with a certain amount of shame that only 19% of the eligible students
had voted in the 2004 election. But they had taken polls, the polls
had looked good but the kids were on cell phones and they weren't
being polled and the figures were going to be staggering because the
kids were engaged. Figures came out, 19%. So if people who have the
privilege of voting don't vote, then you have to ask if they're really
getting what they deserve. We have less of a percentage of eligible
voters voting than voted in Iraq which I think is shameful. So if
people get engaged, they can make the changes, but if they don't, then
we just have a chauffer up there motoring us wherever he wants to go
instead of us giving the directions.&quot;

Lets's not say is bad. Actually it's real good for those who profit
from it.
