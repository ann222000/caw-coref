Is the engineering.

For a successful recording, it does take a good engineer.

I made a fun post about artists. And not all engineers are artists

artist shmartist.. everybody loves to sing and dance and have fun.
sooo don't get the wrong impression, artists subject us to.. stuff.
could be good, could be really bad.

I've had the chance to record in several top studios, even Studio B in
Nashville.
http://www.flickr.com/photos/63631612@N00/110278512/
That was a raw experience. The neat thing about that studio.... all
the vocals are piped to a small 12 x 12 room above the studio, they
are played out through an old speaker with a mic in front of it.. then
it's piped back downstairs to the mix. Allegedly, this gives vocals a
better sound. Maybe it works.. maybe it's just tradition. I recorded
demos there 4 different times.

Next, I recorded at a very nice studio, this was my view while
recording
http://www.cedarhouse.com/tour/soundroom_a.html
A group of pro singers came and did some backup...
but..

that whole session.. was not the sound I wanted or cared for... it was
very mechanical.
It lacked, live players other than some acoustic takes I did piano/
voice. I was very impressed with the effects the engineer (Mark) put
on the vocals. You couldn't quite hear any reverb, but my voice did
come off, larger than life. I have no idea how he did that. Not
loud... It sounded better than I actually did. That session, was the
first and last session... where I worked with live effects in my ear
during recording. I opted to never do this again, as.. I felt it would
weaken me. Make me lazy vocally.

The engineer at cedarhouse, was super! (and expensive)
The fellas at studio B became irritated with me because of so many
takes. Truth is... I felt rushed, it was only 65 bux an hour... that's
cheap, but I felt rushed, that's probably my own fault, maybe not.
maybe it was the idea that they would heap up.. each time a felt I
should start over. lol Maybe I was cutting into their BONG TIME. who
knows.

I believe for a real recording, it takes both.  The one you really need is
whichever one you don't have at the moment.  You had plenty of talent in

Okay, so one day a long time ago someone said Marilyn Monroe would
look good in anything, including a burlap bag. So some enterpising
publicist hired a tailor and they fashioned an outfit, more like a one
piece swimsuit, for Marilyn to wear for a photo shoot.

Do we praise the maker of the burlap bag? Heck, we don't even know who
made the bloody thing anymore, we just look at the results and say,
"Yep, she sure looks good in burlap!"

I think it is important that the product, the raw talent that played
the instruments, be good to begin with. As they say, going back to
homilies, you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. If the music
wasn't performed well to begin with, an engineer, no matter how good
he is, cannot make the performance sound better than it was. He can do
things to make the individual elements "sound" better, fuller,
whatever, but if they were played lousy, then that lousiness is going
to "shine on through" to our ears and we will turn away saying, "That
has to have been the best mixed piece of crap I've ever heard."

Great musicians can often make even an inexperienced engineer look good.
The reverse is almost never true.

Gear obsession is a similar phenomenon.  Earlier this year I tracked a
record on a killer console through great mics, ouboard pres,
compressors - Neve, vintage Neumann, Pultec, Fairchild....really nice
stuff.  But I didn't get the performances I needed because I spent
money on a studio with "the gear" and didn't have enough time to coax
the right performances out of my players.  So I retracked later on a
Pro Tools system using a Grace 201 a modern U87 and nothing else that
would even come close to turning a gear head's head.  But I had two
weeks to work.  I then took my tracks to a studio to mix on a Neve
console with all the cool toys and my mixes sounded like shit because
I tried to do it in a day.  Ultimately I remixed "in-the-box" on a
system that consisted of almost no sexy outboard gear.  But I used a
great mix engineer who took his time.  In the end, the most "uncool"
system produced the best result, and now that I've forgotten all about
whether or not I was surrounded by glowing tubes and elegant brushed
aluminum face plate, I'm damn happy with the sound of my record.  In
the end, you need talent and time for every aspect of the
production.

Uh.... Ansel Adams was a significant tweaker of images. I'd
be lying if I said I remember the figure, but over half the
actual result was done in post. Black and white makes for
significant opportunities in messing with how the negative
gets transferred to paper.

I believe I got this from an "American Experience" episode.

and he really worked them over, and often it would take him a whole day

This is true.  The famous moonrise shot has extensive retouching to remove
some graffiti on the hill, for instance.  Adams was very much into image
modification in order to make the print on the paper look like what he saw
in his head, rather than what was actually there.  Which is a talent in
itself.

A lot of the philosophy and techniques are detailed in Adam's own _Basic
Photography_ series.  It's a three volume set, one on taking pictures,
one on developing negatives and one on printing.

True, but he was also into getting the right shot to start with,
setting up in the right place, waiting for the right lighting, and
focusing on what he wanted to be in focus and what he wanted to be out
of focus. I'm sure that he understood that you couldn't take random
