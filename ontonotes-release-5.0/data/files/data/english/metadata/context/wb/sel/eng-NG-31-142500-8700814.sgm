&gt;9/16/2007: Commentary: Lying a Way Of Life:

&gt;Lying has become a way of life in America. In fact, it is so common
&gt;that we almost expect it.
&gt;I don't know if America can ever recover from our acceptance of lying.
&gt;Honesty used to be a virtue. Today it is a weakness. The truthful are
&gt;ridiculed. The dishonest are promoted.
&gt;Pretty much all the honest truth telling in the world is done by
&gt;children. --Oliver Wendell.
&gt;But yet we teach our children to lie.
&gt;Lying permeates our society.
&gt;When our education system tells us that:
&gt;*Test Scores are going up.
&gt;*No Child Left Behind has improved the quality of education.
&gt;*Education would improve if only we gave the beast more money.
&gt;*The NEA cares about children.
&gt;*A values-free education makes America better.

&gt;They are lying to us.
&gt;When our courts tells us that:
&gt;*Speaking the name of Jesus in government schools is illegal.
&gt;*Parents lose their parental rights when kids enter the school house.
&gt;*The Constitution grants a woman the right to murder her unborn baby.
&gt;*Burning the American flag is protected speech but praying in school
&gt;is not.
&gt;*There is a &quot;separation between the church and state&quot; in the US
&gt;Constitution.

&gt;They are lying to us.

&gt;When social scientists tell us that:
&gt;*There is no difference between a man and woman.
&gt;*A child doesn't need both a mom and a dad.
&gt;*Spanking a child is abusive.
&gt;*Condoms are better than abstinence.
&gt;*Our diversity is our greatest strength.

&gt;They are lying to us.

&gt;When our teachers tell our children that:
&gt;*Humans evolved from pond scum.
&gt;*All families are the same.
&gt;*Truth is relative.
&gt;*Casual sex has no consequences.
&gt;*Homosexuality is normal and inborn.

&gt;They are lying to us..

&gt;When the Republicans tell us that:
&gt;*They want to end abortion.
&gt;*They are the party of &quot;family values.&quot;
&gt;*They oppose homosexuality.
&gt;*They are against big government.
&gt;*They are the lesser of two evils.

&gt;They are lying to us.

&gt;When the Democrats tell us that:
&gt;*They want to see abortions rare, and safe.
&gt;*They are for the &quot;working man.&quot;
&gt;*They are the party of &quot;individual rights.&quot;
&gt;*They need more of our money to run the government.
&gt;*They don't hold the same view on the war as the terrorists do.

&gt;They are lying to us.

&gt;When the Clintons tell us that:
&gt;*It takes a village to raise a child.
&gt;*Everyone lies about sex.
&gt;*They haven't sold out to the Chinese.
&gt;*They aren't dyed-in-the-wool communists.
&gt;*They have made America better.

&gt;They are lying to us.

&gt;When the news media tells us that:
&gt;*They don't have personal biases.
&gt;*They are not socialistic in their leanings.
&gt;*Their reporting is &quot;fair and balanced.&quot;
&gt;*The escapades of Paris Hilton and her &quot;girls gone wild&quot; is
&gt;newsworthy.
&gt;*They report the &quot;truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.&quot;

&gt;They are lying to us.

&gt;When college presidents tell us that:
&gt;*The majority of professors are not raving communists.
&gt;*Radicals have not seized control of most of the department
&gt;chairmanships.
&gt;*The universities are not institutions of lower living rather than
&gt;higher learning.
&gt;*Diversity and tolerance are important pillars of education.
&gt;*They can't do anything about the rampant alcohol/drug/sex abuse on
&gt;campus.

&gt;They are lying to us.

&gt;When the Bush Administration tells us that:
&gt;*Border-jumping is okay if you need a job.
&gt;*A North American Union is not in the works.
&gt;*We don't need to close the borders to secure the nation.
&gt;*Islam is a religion of peace.
&gt;*Muslims and Christians serve the same God.

&gt;They are lying to us.

&gt;When the &quot;government&quot; tells us that:

&gt;*We need to allow them to control guns to keep criminals from having
&gt;weapons.
&gt;*They need more money to &quot;provide services.&quot;
&gt;*We need to exchange freedom for security.
&gt;*America is &quot;under God.&quot;

&gt;They are lying to us.

&gt;When our church-leadership tells us that:
&gt;*Romans 13 tells us we must obey ungodly authority.
&gt;*Homosexuality is consistent with Christianity.
&gt;*We must vote for Rudy to stop Hillary.
&gt;*Voting for the lesser of two evils glorifies Jesus.
&gt;*Christians are not to judge.
&gt;*Government schools are a good place for our children.
&gt;*God wants you to be rich.
&gt;*There is no consequence to sin.
&gt;*There is more than one way to heaven.
&gt;*Christians should stay out of politics.
&gt;*God winks at sin.

&gt;They are lying to us.

&gt;A liar begins with making falsehood appear like truth and ends with
&gt;making truth itself appear like falsehood. --William Shenstone.
&gt;Don't ever forget that telling white lies eventually lead to color-
&gt;blindness.

The good news is the gospel of Christ-crucified, and that the
crucifixion of Jesus in 31 AD is the primary cause of the end
of the world, which is verily imminent. Thus there is a Light
at the end of the tunnel: Tribulation &amp; Armageddon approaches...
