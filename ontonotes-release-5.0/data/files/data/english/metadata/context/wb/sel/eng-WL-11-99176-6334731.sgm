From AP , this tragic story of one more uncounted casualty of the invasion and continuing occupation of Iraq: "Only days after learning her son had died fighting in Iraq, Karen Unruh-Wahrer collapsed and died suddenly in her Tucson home.

"Although the cause of Unruh-Wahrer's Saturday death has not been released, friends say her family is blaming it on 'a broken heart' over losing her son, Army Spc. Robert Oliver Unruh, 25, to enemy fire near Baghdad Sept. 25.

"'She was very, very devastated - she just couldn't stop crying,' said Cheryl Hamilton, a friend and co-worker who had seen the distraught mother several times during the week after her son's death.

"'Her grief was so intense - it seemed it could have harmed her, could have caused a heart attack. Her husband described it as a broken heart,' said Hamilton." And from San Jose Mercury News columnist Sue Hutchison , this story of a grieving mother's treatment at the hands of George W. "Mr. Compassionate" Bush: "Dolores Kesterson sat in her Santa Clara living room last week, tuned to the presidential debate on Iraq. It was not easy for her to watch.

"She is alone, terribly alone, because of this war she never believed in.

"Her only child, Erik Kesterson, died 11 months ago when his Black Hawk helicopter crashed in Mosul. He had graduated in the top 5 percent of his flight school class and was attached to the 101st Airborne Division. He was 29.

"Dolores still cries at the memory of the day last November when an Army chaplain knocked on her door. She was thinking about it during the debate when President Bush talked about his meeting with the wife of one of the soldiers killed in Iraq.

"'I wonder why the president didn't mention his meeting with Dolores Kesterson,' she said later, with a dry chuckle. 'I wonder why he didn't mention the letter I gave him.'

"Dolores met with the president in June when he was visiting Fort Lewis in Washington state to speak to the families of fallen soldiers. She went with her ex-husband and his family. She wore a locket around her neck that had a picture of her son in uniform.

"She wanted to tell the president about Erik, the funny and brave wild-child who grew up determined to serve his country in the military. She wanted to tell the president what it felt like to lose him in a war fought for a lie.

"Where was the evidence that Iraq had anything to do with the attacks on Sept. 11? Where were the weapons of mass destruction that were supposedly hidden in the desert?

"Dolores said she was sure the president already knew her position before he walked in to meet with her that day at Fort Lewis. When he introduced himself, he stood toe-to-toe with her. 'His face was right in mine,' she said. 'It was very clear that his attitude is 'My way or the highway.''

"But she spoke her piece. Afterward, she said the president asked her, 'Dolores, do you realize we were attacked on Sept. 11?'"

I know the sons of privilege - their motto is "Who cares what you think?" Here in Connecticut, their prep schools abound. George W. is a son of Connecticut privilege, and has never had to "deal" with anything. There was always a family 'fixer', someone to get them out of trouble, or to hush up any unpleasantness.

Really, what did Americans think they were getting by hiring George W. Bush? Responsibility? Hardly.
