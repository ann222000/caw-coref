Any idea what would make blood sugar drop after eating protein meal?

It's happened twice in the last couple days. First time was 96 in the
evening about 5 hours after lunch.  Ate about 30 grams fish protein
and 1 hour later was 84.  Today was 124 about 2 1/2 hours after lunch
of just salad (dressing had some sugar and molasses in it).  I ate
approx.1/4 pound beef and grilled mushrooms/onions plus green beans. 1
hour later my bg was 109.  Went for slowish walk and checked bg again
at hour 2 and it was 110.  Then at hour 3 my bg was 114.  FBG this
morning was all the way down to 68.

How does protein in stomach cause bg to drop ??

Thanks in advance  : )

I don't think protein in the stomach does make BG drop.  BG goes up and down
in diabetics and there is more to it than just what we eat.  Activity
factors in as does stress and hormone levels.

Looking at those menus, I don't think the protein &quot;made it
drop&quot;. But there were very few carbs to make it rise, so it
gravitated towards normal. Obviously Dale still produces
some insulin.

Can't comment on the 68.

Protein tends to delay gastric emptying thereby promote more gastric
stretching.

The latter would stimulate the release of GLP-1 by the stomach.

GLP-1 can stimulate the beta islet cells of the pancreas to release
more insulin thereby causing the &quot;bg to drop.&quot;

Exercise after eating tends to prolong gastric emptying even beyond
the usual delay of a protein meal.

Your FBG this AM may have been the result of this excessive delay
because all the GLP-1 may have resulted in an exaggerated insulin
response by the beta islet cells when the stomach finally emptied of
its contents while you were sleeping. Because of your low-carbing and
exercising after supper, there may have been little to no glycogen for
your liver to use to keep you from going hypoglycemic.

Having more GLP-1 around is not a good thing.

There is reason to be concerned that having more GLP-1 around is tumor
promoting thereby possibly increasing your future risk for cancers.

Going hypoglycemic because of insufficient glycogen stores is also not
a good thing.

What you are doing is reducing your hunger.

Truly, it is only when we are hungry (stomachs singing and
laughing :-) that our bodies get rid of the VAT that is causing the
type-2 diabetes.

Protein is absorbed slowly and inefficiently by the body, at around
50% efficiency.

Bg is removed from the bloodstream in response to insulin action,
exercise, basic metabolic rate, or meds.

If you ate a protein meal then went for a walk, for instance, the
protein may not hit your bloodstream until after you've got back. You
need to test further out than an hour to capture the effect from
protein - but be aware that it may not show as a spike at all, because
it's so slow.

I doubt if the protein made your BG drop but your numbers look great.
It just looks like your body is OK with your current diet. Congrats

I'm assuming no meds.  If the person is taking any pancreas-stimulating
meds, they need a dose adjustment.

But assuming no meds, my best guess is this... eating or drinking
anything stimulates the pancreas.  I know this cause when I had
pancreasitis, I was not allowed anything by mouth, not even ice chips.
Anything in the stomach tells the pancreas to get busy.

So... I'd guess there's not enough carbs in these meals to &quot;cover&quot; the
endogenous insulin produced.

There's two possible solutions: first is to stick with it until the body
adjusts.  It's extremely unlikely that someone producing insulin is
gonna go hypo just from eating low-carb, even with exercise.  The body's
feedback loops are going to prevent hypos, but it may take some time for
the body to adjust to this diet.

The second, (and IMO better solution), is to up the carbs to the degree
that keeps bg in goal range as it appears the person has gone lower-carb
than is strictly necessary.  Add more veggies and some low-sugar fruit.
Maximizing the amount of these foods you can tolerate without elevated
bg is always a good thing.

I have never seen a more confused and muddled discussion of glp-1
before.  There are too many half truths and pure misstatements of fact
and pure flights of invention then are worth correcting.  Ignore all
above as pure fiction.

Suffice it to say this is the product of someone far out of touch with
the research on the topic.

The author does not keep up with research, distorts science in pursuit
of a non science agenda, ignores science clearly refuting the agenda.
All these andmore good reasons to ignore any opinion of the author.

If you dont eat carbs, your blood sugar goes down. You ate very few
carbs in the way of the dressing and the vegetables.  Protein doesnt
raise blood sugars so as time goes by, the bgs go down.

Dr. Chung,

Please explain:

How can that be true if satan is an unreliable source of information?
John 8:44 speaks of satan as a liar, the very father of all lies.

So how do satan's lies affirm the veracity of your writings?  Satan
knows you perceive his accusations as lies, so why wouldn't he then
speak the truth instead?

If satan truly is the father of lies, it follows logically that either
one, or both of you, are lying.

It is written that lying is satan's native language.

He is simply unable to speak the truth, because he hates the truth,
Who is LORD Jesus Christ, too much.

Incorrect.

It is written that satan is the father (source) of all lies and that
lying is his native language.

It is also written that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Truth.

It logically follows from these two facts that satan will lie about
what the Holy Spirit inspires brethren to write.  This allows those
with discerning hearts to know the truth, Who is LORD Jesus Christ.

The brethren of LORD Jesus Christ are neither perfect nor more
special...

... we are simply forgiven by GOD:
