Hello the &quot;top&quot; and their WHIPs,

Sorry about the duplicate posting of slightly different
copies of &quot;#4 of a Republic&quot; last week. I hit the
&quot;send&quot; button, the computer seemed to stall, so I
restarted the computer but did not look in the right
place to find the message. A day old draft was used
to reconstruct the message with my short memory span.
When I sent the reconstructed copy, both versions
appeared in the &quot;Sent&quot; folder. I am getting too old
for this systems analysis work, but you WHIPs are
too busy making money to bother with it.

The excerpt copied below from &quot;#3 of A
Republic...,&quot; , contains contributions to our
discussion by Dave Taylor and Peter Haines
which I should have acknowledged and
commented on in #3. In stead, I wrote:

&quot;To hell with my [WSB comments WSB]
for this post, I can't think of anything new
to say.&quot;

The purpose of this revisit is to begin with the view
points of Dave and Peter below and explore a more
complete conceptual model of our present condition
than is offered by either; our 2462 year old Judeo
Christian-Islamic-Protestant principle of
&quot;Subsidiarity,&quot; or, the 114 year old principle of a
&quot;Family Wage&quot; proposed by Popes Leo X III in 1891,
Pope Pius X I in 1931, and Pope John II in 1981.

I'll insert my [WSB comment WSB] in the text
below as I should have inserted them in the
original #3. Then to conclude this post, I'll use
the new Fig6b.gif &quot;Product Lines and Households,&quot;
to show how American Corporations have become,
since the 1890s, the dominant species of the global
economy, at the expense of households, local
communities, and our ecosystem.

Subject: #3 of A Republic, If You Can Keep it.

Good day folks,

~~~~~~~~ Big snip ~~~~~~~~~

Dave Taylor wrote: &quot;Subsidiarity goes back
long before Constantine to Jesus empowering
the oppressed, and as I have previously explained,
you have misunderstood the US bishops.

[WSB If Bible critic Julius Wellhausen was correct
in believing that the books of Moses were compiled
and edited by Ezra after the Remnant returned from
exile, then the applied practice of Subsidiarity may extended back to
B.C. 457, if not back to the &quot;Folly
of Rehoboam (I Kings 12, 1-15, B.C. 975). From
Rehoboam to Thomas Paine (2767 years), I can find
no evidence of any local government that disbursed
a full measure of the first tithe to prevent poverty
among its young parenting families. Not until 1891
did the Mother Church propose the &quot;Family Wage,&quot;
following Thomas Paine's 1792 &quot;Agrarian Justice,&quot;
as an alternative to the principle of Subsidiarity. WSB]

Howdy Wes,

~~~~~~~~~~~ Small snip ~~~~~~~~~~~~

You said Wes &quot;The principle of Subsidiarity forbids the Church and
government from supplementing the family income until the family falls
below the current poverty line.&quot;
You also said further down &quot;But in the English speaking world the Church
declines to offer a specific economic policy and instead offers a
diametrically opposed pair of policies.&quot;

[WSB By &quot;the Church,&quot; I meant the Roman
Catholic Church offers a diametrically opposed
pair of policies, Subsidiarity and RERUM
NOVARUM. The other Western religions
Judaism, Islam, and Protestantism;
incorporated the best of both policies in the
SOP of their private sectors, but offer only
twelve years of public education plus means-
tested welfare or private charity in the SOP
of their public sectors where the principle
of Subsidiarity invites every household to lift
itself by its own bootstraps. WSB]

(Peter continues...)
There is effectively no real difference between these, fundamentally
Catholic and Protestant parts of the world. They both maintain the
divide and rule dialectic more obvious in the Protestant world where
Humanism prevails in the formal churchs and society at large, thanks to
the Fabians. In the former case (Catholic) the world saw the growth of
communism as a result of that policy of Subsidiarity far greater than in
the second religious society from where capitalism ( also the
exploitation of man by man) was the most robust.

[WSB Yes. Capitalism extended &quot;the need to know&quot;
from its &quot;top&quot; to its merchants and business men so
the products of the industrial revolution could be
sold to global markets and slowly trickle down to
the working classes at home who produced the
products. WSB]

(Peter continues...)
Today the free market which transcends both these two has increased the
extremes between the rich and poor,

[WSB My macro model Fig4 shows two markets.
The world market for goods and services is free
due to the SOP of private sectors. (See Fig6b.gif.)
The US labor market, in contrast, has been corrupted
and diminished since &quot;The Great Transformation&quot; of
the 1890s by the systemic defect of only capitalizing
the $6,500/year/student cost of 1-12 public Edu.,
while the expense of subsistence and medical care
reduces the purchasing power of parenting families
compared to households of the same income, but
without children. WSB]

(Peter continues...)
where the &quot;top&quot; can continue to leave each group to fight each other
instead of uniting against them. Your fig 2-3d shows the M2, the Dow
Jones pulling away in a step climb while the average citizen is down in
the M1 where the level playing field is limited as shown by the flat line
thanks to 'flexible labour' policy.

[WSB The &quot;flat line&quot; of M1 in Fig2-3d also
suggests something about the stability and large
amount of cash reserves which back up the
flexibility of the US economy. Notice that
M1 expanded from $200 Billion in 1965 to
$1,200 Billion in 1995 and then held constant
for eight years because the &quot;top&quot; thought the
public might be paying attention. During the
three decade run up, the source of M1 changed
from 50% (Federal Debt held by banks) to 100%.
So the entire US money supply M1 is today bought
and paid for by the US taxpayers. The private
sector WHIPs retired their corporate debt held by
the banks (the other 50% of M1 in 1965), to enjoy a
tax-free/interest-free supply of working capital M0.
The &quot;top&quot; sure knows how to play this game. WSB]

(Peter continues...)
Social Credit is held out as the policy of Christian philosophy, since
there is none specific in the churches outside of the recognition of
humanitarian charity. Douglas recognised that there is a law in the
make-up of the universe which the &quot;top&quot; system violates and their policy
contradicts nature.

All the Law of the Old Testament and the Prophets are sumed up in two
supreme laws- Love God with all one's heart and thy fellow man ( that
includes team/increment) as thyself. The &quot;top&quot; are the opposite so why
should we join them at the top? They are in fact the dirty bottom.
Regards,
Peter Haines

[WSB The two &quot;Great Commandments&quot; by which
Jesus summarized the Ten Commandments
represent the 10/12ths of the Law we are taught by
the &quot;top&quot; (the 13th tribe of predators) who are the
best and brightest 0.2% of our WHIPs (our Wealthy,
Healthy, Intelligent, and Powerful folks). The ministry
of Jesus did not last long enough for him to restore the
Law, as he promised in (Matthew 5. 17-19). WSB]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~ End excerpt from #3 and comments ~~~~~~

Now folks, the simple mechanical truths that
are as &quot;self-evident&quot; to me as they were to the
athors of our Declaration Of Independence;
have become obscure, negotiable, and saleable
after a century of Democracy without the Law.
The Law becomes complete when the three tithes
of Moses are added to two great Commandments
of Jesus, as illustrated on Fig7-9i.gif.

If you look up &quot;tithes&quot; in a Bible with a subject
index, such as the Scofield Reference Edition
(my copies of the Douay version, the Torah, and
the Koran do not include a subject index), you will
find nine references to the Old Testament and two
to the New Testament (Heb. 7. 6 and Heb. 7. 5).
Thomas Paine reconstructed the whole Law, as did
Bertrand Russell and C. H. Douglas, but perhaps
they started their analysis too late in life and did
not find the authority in Scripture for the whole
Law before they were hounded out of public life.

But we can't sell that religious stuff to the Humanists
and Democrats, yet we need them on our side to sell
the WHIPs on The Optimum Policy (TOP). The other
authority for the whole Law is the SOP (standard
operating practice) of private sector corporations, as
illustrated on attached Fig6b.gif, and practiced by the
&quot;top&quot; and such WHIPs as have a need to know.

At the top of Fig6b are shown the common features
of product lines and households that are in stable
production of whatever they happen to produce. Start
up and shut down firms or families are simply noise
on the real economy. They are important for the
growth and development of the economy, but they
do not define its steady state condition and long
term trends.

We need spend little time on the top of Fig6b because
it was explained concisely in 1776 when Adam Smith
wrote in his First Maxim of Taxation:

&quot;The expense of government to the citizens of
a great nation is like the expense of management
to the joint tenants of a great estate (corporation).

The 30% general &amp; administrative (G&amp;A) rate
applied to the direct cost of product lines was
used for competitive bidding in each of the ten
corporations I worked for between 1947 and 1985.
And, I learned recently, Wal-Mart also uses a 30%
G&amp;A rate on their products made in China.

The 30% tax rate applied to household income is
common only to the most advanced nations: the
USA, Japan, and Switzerland, as shown on Fig1
by data from the 1994 World Bank ATLAS. Of
these three nations, only the USA capitalizes
just 50% of the expense of developing its human
assets. But Japan and Switzerland will not tell the
USA, just as General Electric never told Westinghouse.
The whole Law has been a proprietary secret of the
&quot;top&quot; since they built the Tower Of Babel, and when
the &quot;top&quot; is corrupted by power they cannot see their
advantage in sharing the whole Law with the common
folks as has been done in Switzerland since the 1790s
and in Japan since 1946.

A more important feature of an industrial economy
is shown by the two time scales:

The upper scale shows the time profile of M1 in the checking account of a
product line. Sales revenue is received and accumulated over the billing
period,
and disbursed to meet the payroll and other expenses
in each billing period.

The lower scale shows the time profile of M1 in the
checking account of a household. Unearned and
earned income is received on pay days and gradually
disbursed to meet consumption expenses over the
billing period. Notice that M0 is always in one
checking account or the other, and that STABLE
product lines and households will always operate
with a reserve of M1 in their checking account.
There are, of course, billing periods for different
kinds of transactions, varying from daily to annual,
so there must be a composite billing period such
that the (sum of M0) received by all households
in each billing period times the (billing periods
per year) will closely approximate the gross national income (GNI). A
similar calculation of M0
disbursed by all product lines should closely
approximate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

That composite billing period cannot be as long
as the month used for utility and social security
payments, nor as short as one week used for hourly employees. My guess
is about 26 billing periods
per year which for US 2003 data on Fig4 and Fig8
gives M0 = $962 Billion or 80.2% of the $1,200
billion M1. That leaves $238 Billion as positive
balances in the checking accounts of product lines
and households. So the real economy floats in a
$238 Billion pool of M1. More money; interest-free,
debt-free, or otherwise will not cure what ails us.

The only technically valid cure for what ails the
US economy is to restore the purchasing power
of parenting households to the level they would
enjoy if they were households of gay men, lesbian
women, of celibate priests. That means capitalizing
the whole cost of developing our work force, just
as our corporations capitalize the whole cost of
developing their capital plant.

Kind regards,

Wes Burt
