Want to try Linux--how to partition WinXP disk without losing data.

I have searched and cannot find any relevant posts that are newer
thanseven or eight years, so here goes. I want to install a version of
Linux (not sure which yet) on a single-partition disk with Windows XP
already installed on it. Is there a way to create a new partition
without losing the data?

Back in 2002 I did this on another computer using an older version of
Partition Magic and it worked like a champ, but I just tried PM8 on
this one to no avail. It acts like it's going to do it, but in the end
it doesn't and doesn't even say why. Can the software included with
any of the Linux distributions accomplish this? Is the only option to
partition and reinstall Windows?

Most Linux distributions claim they can do this.
Lacking any reason to believe that this is so (or
to trust one distro over another) it would be
prudent frst to use an XP partition manager, so
as to segregate and "unpartition" enough drive
space (say 5 to 10 Gb) to instal a full-featured
Linux distro.

Are you familiar with an XP partition manager that will do this non-
destructively? The Computer Management utility that comes with XP will
delete and format partitions and change drive letters but that's it.

Sorry, no:  I do not use XP.  When appropriately
backed up you can experiment with the software
you already have.
