For your sake, I hope so. The Interpole people have been asking for

No need. I've posted here publicly, forwarded it to Interpol with

&gt; Please kindly explain just what are you on about?

&gt; What do my posting in this newsgroup have anything at all do do with your

&gt; and just for the record I will state, I'm not Larbgai. I have no idea who he
&gt; is. I've never been to Gisborne though I heard they have nice weather.

&gt; I''ve NEVER been to Thailand or any other Asian Country

&gt; and lastly but not least I'm not AUSTRALIAN (My I.Q was to high they
&gt; wouldn't let me in)

*****Sorry Craig, but at one stage you must have criticised Kramer and
the demented old fool now thinks you are me. Don't ask me how his mind
works.
If you are not the Craig Sutton that lives in Gisbourne (and neither
am I) I will phone the guy and tell him his name is being bandied
about the internet by the silly old fool in Chiang Mai.
Should be interesting.

*****I have collected all Kramers posts including the headers also

These will be forwarded to Mr Suttons Lawyers as requested.
Seems the person that Kramer has been accusing has never travelled
overseas and is in his late sixties.
What a field day they are going to have with Kramer.

You still don't get it, dumb and coward Takin Gthepiss

The ONLY ASSHOLE in this and other Usenet groups is YOU, poor sod in a
wheelchair.

Living permanently with the fear that someone might now your real
indentity
one day and pay you a visit.

How many times do you look over your shoulder in fear when the black
guy
with his baseball bat from the wellfare pushes you and your wheelchair
on
the fresh air?

Every single poster in the Usenet is fed up with your rantings (except
your
master Deckard).

GOD created you with such tiny brains that you fail to realize that.

Your only life consist of a computer screen and wating for the guy
from the
Wellfare to push you and your wheelchair into the fresh air every week
and
pound your ass with a baseball bat.

You must have been some real bad creature in a previous life to end up
being
what you are now.

Even your mama and your dad denied your existence and declared at your
birth
that you are not a son of them.

Your next life wil be even worse ......... (if possible)

Now, start posting again 10+ posts like you did last week.
You are free to use any of your foregered ID&quot;s as you are used to
already.

Don't be such a coward and show us that you can post again 10+ posts
in one
day, wheelchairman.

Sure as hell we like to fun of you

Note: if you or others knows the coward Takin Gthepiss real identity
or his
real name, publish it here and saves us the money of a lawyer to do
that.
