Hi.

I have a question about the risk of blood clots, please. I am a 44 yr
old female w/Raynaud's and circulatory problems, and DVT's run in my
family. I also have Osteoporosis due to Early Menopause. Until
recently I had been taking 100mcgs of Vitamin K for my bones, until I
realized that this was not a good idea because of blood clots.

I am quite concerned. Does Vitamin K cause blood clots? I'm due to go
on a long-haul flight 10 hrs. soon, I've stopped the Vitamin K,
started taking a baby aspirin daily. Should I be worried?

Also, would a full strength adult non-coated be better than a baby
aspirin for clot prevention? Any advice would be most appreciated!

Best.
Valerie

Not a good Idea as it thickens your blood. Combine that with cold weather
and higher colesterol diet you'll get blood clots easily. You should take
calcium
and enzymes for osteoperosis, (enzymes provide uptake into your system.)

YES it can!

That's a good idea as long as you don't take too much as it lasts in your
system up to 10 days.

Either take it (I presume 10mg Cardiprin) per day or 300 mg asprin about
once a week unless you're a hemophilliac and bleed easily.

I'm not a Doctor and therefore give this advice from experience of having a
patent foramen ovale and thick blood and not wanting to have side effects
warfrin entails.

The osteoperosis information is what I've discovered from Dr. Joel Wallach.
If you want his web site just email me. Paul.

In a person not on blood thinners, extra vitamin K will not make
blood more prone to clotting according to one research paper I
recently read.
Having said that, that is only one paper. And it wasn't in the
context of Raynaund's disease or phenomenon. Of course there
is the issue of the underlying disease also.

A shortage of vitamin D will make one more prone to clotting according
to  paper I read today; whereas, vitamin A in too high a ratio to
vitamin D will likely make on more prone to clotting.

A 100 mcgs of phylloquinone is a tiny dose such a tiny dose it
would be fine along with the antivitamin K blood thinners.
Granted this may run counter to the content of what is said
in the nursing lecture but how often are they up to date on this
topic? Indeed, recent research indicate this is the preferred state
for vitamin K. as what a person&quot; wants&quot; on the thinners is a very
steady intake
(if limited) of vitamin K. If the vitamin K intake bounces around the
titrated dose
of meds will not always be accurate/optimal. A salad can contain
more vitamin K than 100 mcgs. Please check what I say as my
memory can be flawed.

I take 10 milligrams of the vitamin each and every day.
I'll get back with references on some of these points.

How is your bone density? The blood thinner meds (coumadin)
will weaken bones over time as vitamin K is needed for the manufacture
of bone matrix. Recall bone is made of both mineral and matrix.
When one makes beef broth the protein in the finished broth
comes not only from the marrow but also the protein matrix
of the bone.

Also fish oil maybe useful in
making you less prone to clotting.
I haven't kept up on the aspirin thing, I do recall
some authorites suggested a bit more aspirin could help.

Take an aspirin and relax. Drink plenty of fluids.

However, any adjustment of vitamin K intake is important

Even 25 mcgs of K can be important. There

If one is taking vitamin K it would be important
to do it on a continous basis and DURING the

you want your doctor to be holding hand so to speak.

But the use of a modest vitamin K supplement
in the context has benefits as the following

Vitamin K supplementation can improve
stability of anticoagulation for patients
with unexplained variability in response to warfarin.

Sconce E, Avery P, Wynne H, Kamali F.

School of Clinical and Laboratory Sciences,
Newcastle University, Newcastle upon
Tyne, United Kingdom.

Patients receiving warfarin who have unstable
control of anticoagulation have a
significantly lower intake of dietary
vitamin K compared with their stable
counterparts. We hypothesized that
supplementation with oral vitamin K would
improve stability in patients with
previously unstable control of
anticoagulation. Seventy warfarin-treated
patients with unstable anticoagulation
control were randomly assigned in a
double-blinded fashion to receive a daily
amount of 150 mug oral vitamin K or
placebo orally for 6 months. Measures of
stability of anticoagulation control
in the 6-month study period were
compared with those in the 6 months
immediately prior to it. Vitamin K supplementation
resulted in a significantly greater
decrease in standard deviation of
international normalized ratio (INR)
compared with placebo (-0.24 +/- 0.14 vs
-0.11 +/- 0.18; P &lt; .001) and a
significantly greater increase in percentage time
within target INR range (28% +/- 20% vs 15% +/- 20%; P &lt; .01).
Anticoagulation control improved in 33 of 35
patients receiving vitamin K supplementation; of
these, 19 fulfilled our criteria for having
stable control of anticoagulation.
However, only 24 of 33 patients receiving
placebo demonstrated some degree of
improvement, with only 7 patients fulfilling
the criteria for having stable
control. Concomitant supplementation of
vitamin K, perhaps through reducing the
relative day-to-day variability in
dietary vitamin K intake, can significantly
improve anticoagulation control in
patients with unexplained instability of
response to warfarin.

Vitamin K administration to elderly patients
with osteoporosis induces no
hemostatic activation, even in those
with suspected vitamin K deficiency.

The administration of menaquinone-4 (MK-4),
one of subclasses of vitamin K2,
significantly reduces bone loss in
postmenopausal osteoporotic women.
However, concerns have been raised about
whether vitamin K administration alters the
hemostatic balance by inducing a
thrombotic tendency. We investigated were
whether the administration of vitamin K
in the form of MK-4 induced a thrombotic
tendency in 29 elderly patients with
osteoporosis (5 men, 24 women; age range
78.7+/-5.1 years). Patients were
administered 45 mg/day (three times a day, 30
min after each meal) of MK-4 for 12 weeks.
Blood samples were obtained from the
patients at 0, 4 and 12 weeks after the
start of MK-4 administration. A number of
hemostatic parameters remained stable
under the markedly increased plasma levels
of MK-4. However, in patients with suspected
vitamin K deficiency, whose plasma
levels of vitamin K or factor VII were
low, vitamin-K-dependent clotting factors
such as factor VII and prothrombin were
gradually increased after administration
of MK-4. No changes in the sensitive
molecular markers such as TAT and F1+2,
which reflect the amount of thrombin
generated in the blood stream, were
observed, even in those patients with s
uspected vitamin K deficiency. These
results indicate that MK-4 can be
administered safely, with regard to
maintainingthe hemostatic balance, to
osteoporotic patients receiving no anticoagulant
therapy.

Disruption of nuclear vitamin D receptor
gene causes enhanced thrombogenicity in
mice.

Vitamin D metabolites influence the
expression of various genes involved in
calcium homeostasis, cell differentiation,
and regulation of the immune system.
Expression of these genes is mediated by
the activation of the nuclear vitamin D
receptor (VDR). Previous studies have
shown that a hormonally active form of
vitamin D, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D3, exerts anticoagulant effects in
cultured monocytic cells. To clarify
whether activation of VDR plays any
antithrombotic actions in vivo,
hemostatic/thrombogenic systems were examined in
normocalcemic VDR knock-out (KO)
mice on a high calcium diet and compared with
wild type and hypocalcemic VDRKO
mice that were fed a regular diet.
Platelet aggregation was enhanced significantly
in normocalcemic VDRKO mice compared with
wild type and hypocalcemic VDRKO mice.
Aortic endothelial nitric-oxide (NO)
synthase expression and urinary NOx
excretions were reduced in hypocalcemic VDRKO
mice, but not in normocalcemic VDRKO mice.
Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses
revealed that the gene expression of
antithrombin in the liver as well as that of
thrombomodulin in the aorta, liver and
kidney was down-regulated in hypo- and
normocalcemic VDRKO mice. Whereas tissue
factor mRNA expression in the liver and
kidney was up-regulated in VDRKO mice
regardless of plasma calcium level.
Furthermore, VDRKO mice manifested an
exacerbated multi-organ thrombus formation
after exogenous lipopolysaccharide
injection regardless of the calcemic
conditions. These results demonstrate
that activation of nuclear VDR elicits
antithrombotic effects in vivo, and
suggest that the VDR system may play a
physiological role in the maintenance
of antithrombotic homeostasis.

Hi,

Thanks for the info! I'm not taking Coumadin at present. My father was
on it, as he had DVT, (don't really like to take meds unless I
absolutely have to). I have been taking a baby aspirin for the past 3
weeks. I was concerned because I suddenly developed two purple bruises
on the back of my knee, where my leg bends. They started to hurt when
I walk just recently now that they're fading. Was concerned that they
were a blood clot (which I'm very scared of). Have to take a 10 hr.
flight in the next couple of months, so I'm extra worried.

I'm 44, but do have

&gt; I am quite concerned. Does Vitamin K cause blood clots? I'm due to go

The clotting mechanism normally occurs during some sort of trauma
(cuts), I have read that vitamin K makes it less likely for blood
cells to clump together.

Since vitamin K helps prevent atherosclerosis and osteoporosis, I take
a 100 mcg dose.

&gt; Also, would a full strength adult non-coated be better than a baby
&gt; aspirin for clot prevention? Any advice would be most appreciated!
">

A 81 mg enteric coated should be adequate, but the aspirin regimin is
usually recommended for those over 60. Your effective dose would be
higher with the non-coated.

Some theorize that the anti-inflammatory aspect of aspirin is of more
benefit that the anti-coagulation aspect.

Vitamin E and omega 3 fatty acids also have blood thinning effects.
