My mother receives Medicare benefits and has a supplemental insurance
policy also.  When she visits a doctor, hospital, etc. often later she
gets a statement showing the doctor's charge, the amount Medicare
paid, and maybe something the supplemental insurance carrier paid.
The amounts paid by Medicare and insurance almost never add up to the
doctor's charge, yet, no attempt is made to collect the balance from
my mother.  The statement does not show the balance as being "due from
patient."  Is that because the doctor (or medical group or hospital or
whatever the billing entity is) has some sort of agreement with
Medicare not to drum the patients?  Thanks in advance -- H

That is the whole premise of Medicare. Participating doctors and other
medical facilities agree to accept what Medicare decides is proper.
Medicare pays a percentage and the supplemental insurance (if any) pays
the balance. (Both after annual deductibles).

The doctor's statement will usually indicate that the difference from
the original charge has been written off, leaving a zero balance.

Yes.  That is exactly how it works.  Not only Medicare but most
insurance companies require you to go to "in-network" doctors that have
agreements with the insurance company as to how much they will pay for
every procedure.  If you go the the in-network doctor that is all you
will have to pay for no matter what the actual bill is, of you go to an
out-of-network doctor you may have to pay more out of your own pocket.
