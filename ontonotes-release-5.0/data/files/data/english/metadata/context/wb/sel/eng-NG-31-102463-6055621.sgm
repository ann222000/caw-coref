DoST develops versatile machines for coconut products

*New machines that can process coconut-husk based products, including one
which can produce geotextiles for erosion and landslide control, have been
developed by the Metals Industry Research and Development Center (MIRDC). *

The center is one of the key agencies of the Department of Science and
Technology (DoST) under Secretary Estrella Alabastro. It was established in
1966 to foster the advancement of metals engineering and allied industries
in the country.

Among the machines developed by MIRDC is the "Coco Fiber Twinning Machine,"
which makes coconut fiber twines for use in producing geotextile nets for
erosion control as well as for road and river embankment. It can process 20
kilos of coconut fiber twines per day or five kilos "more than its
conventional counterpart."

The other machines are a "Coco Husk Micro Decorticator" which can process
3,000 husks per day, a "Coco Husk Mini Decorticator" with a higher
5,000-husk daily capacity which can produce mixed fibers measuring four to
six inches in length; and a "Coco Husk Beating Machine."

These machines will be deployed in areas where coco husks are abundant,
including Naval, Biliran; Catarman, Northern Samar; Irosin, Sorsogon; Davao
City; San Isidro, Davao Oriental; San Pablo, Laguna; Catanauan, Quezon; and
Oroquieta, Lanao del Norte.

MIRDC Product and Process Research section chief Jose Ferrer said coco fiber
makes up 30 percent of the coconut husk. The remaining 70 percent is made up
of the coco peat, which is used as a medium for growing mushrooms, for
longer water retention in golf courses, and for bioengineering
difficult-tovegetate terrain.

Coco fiber is used in the production of geotextiles, car furniture and
construction materials. It is also used in forest nurseries, horticulture,
agriculture, and for the development of golf courses.

Coco fiber is also widely used as bed mattress, particularly in China, where
100 million mattresses are needed annually. One mattress needs 4.5 kilos of
coco fiber, which means that 37,500 tons of fiber per month or 450,000 tons
of fiber per year is needed to supply the China market alone.

Ferrer meanwhile said Filipino engineers have the technical capability to
design geotextile applications and install materials.

He said that among the accomplishments of Filipino engineers in geotextiles
include the desert rehabilitation in Mongolia using fiber tubes, which was
designed by Filipino engineers and installed by Japanese partners in a
project funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in
1999-2000; the use of erosion nets in a river in Hokkaido, Japan in 1996
wherein the coco fibers were supplied by Filipino exporters, as well as the
use of geotextiles as erosion control for a river in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia
installed from 1998 to 1999.

In the local setting, geotextiles have been used to stabilize the slope at
San Roque Dam in Pangasinan as well as the Tagaytay Midlands Golf Course, in
Tagaytay City.

Geotextiles take five years to decompose, according to MIRDC Executive
Director Rolando Viloria.
