Hello Fellow Networker, WAHM Members, college students....anyone who is
looking to find something real, legal, a Business Franchise type of oneline
Biz.... that is real, legal, and promissing..... It is a VERY SIMPLE system and VERY LUCRATIVE, would that be something you
are searching for online?... If this makes sense then go to: http://www.itvleaderteam.info then
call me at 800-803-6430. Before getting to here and making a decision soley based on what
you are reading thus far,  you owe this not only to yourself but to your
dreams and your families to really look at this...and then after you learned what this is...then make your decision of whether this
is a right fit for what you are searching for. You can be one of the first people in the world to know about what I want
to share with you and all you have to do to get this information is to visit the
above website
Or Go HERE and Listen Toll Free: http://www.byoaudio.com/play/WJkG6Bss . There is a better and smarter way to do business from home and at the
conclusion of this phone call you will know all about it. Chances are you expressed an interest in getting involved with a home based
business, you are serious about  finding a way to
have money and
time that you can enjoy with your loved ones. Congratulations... That's
Fantastic! There are a lot of options on the internet- different opportunities for you
to choose from, but no matter what their products or compensation plan
structure, they are all using the SAME OLD BUSINESS
MODEL.

And statistics and legal research over the years has
shown  me that 97% of the people who use that model fail.  NOT
HERE!  We have turned that around, we have a 97% success rate. THE ONLY WAY TO NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN
THIS OPPORTUNITY AND BUSINESS IS TO NOT ANSWER YOUR PHONE!  Don't talk to
customers who want to buy your product and don't take calls from other
individuals who are looking to start their own business
also! Here are some real testimonials from
members of my Team! Greetings team, I just took 3 calls for Rice 'n Shine today.
Here were my results: 1st call :  Just wanted
information.  I gave her the corporate ITV Ventures website I'm mailing
her 1 Rice 'N Shine and 1 Flex Protex brochure, and I also just sent her a
postcard.  Likelihood of a resulting sale ... I'd say a little better than
50%. 2nd call :  Bought a 3-pak of
Rice N' Shine on OAP 3rd call : Initially just wanted
info and wanted to know if we had a website.  I kept her on the phone long
enough to make a sale.  Bought a single container of Rice N' Shine on
OAP.  She is also interested in the business (I mention at the end of my
call something along the lines of &quot;you watched an infomercial from Ohio, dialed
the number on the screen, and my phone here at HOME rang, which is where I'm
talking to you from right now&quot;.  Get's a pretty good reaction. So ... 2 for 3 (a 67% conversion rate), and a
potential new IBO!  Not bad. Have got to go so I can send out another post card
and ship the brochures.  I've also got another 2.5 hours scheduled for this
Sunday. 3 Star Silver IBO
Remember, this is not about the products, it's about the business model.
Read on and you'll see what I mean: The old way: --Harass your family, friends and co-workers about your product(s) and
business opportunity and feel like a total jerk on the inside every time
you do it. --Alienate All those people mentioned above or they'll end up avoiding you,
not taking your calls or worse yet, laughing at you behind your back and
making that &quot;L&quot; sign on their forehead and snickering when you
walk by (does that sound familiar?). The Better and Smarter Way: Our Way --Capitalize on Millions upon Millions of Dollars worth of
Television Advertising promoting both your products and your
business opportunity. --Take calls from millions of people who already want to buy your products
or join your business. http://www.itvleaderteam.info This just MAKES SENSE- it's undeniable and using this business model, our
goal is to put people just like you in a system where 97% will SUCCEED! Do yourself a favor and make sure to get on the call (and bring your people
with you). The information you'll hear will blow your mind! You owe it to yourself to get this information because today, I'm letting
you in on a secret, tomorrow the word is getting out and MILLIONS will know what
I'm sharing with you now. Every second you delay someone else is getting the information and getting
started. Get on early because the calls are limited to 500 lines. Today is 9/27/2007, ITV has just aired for the first time the Business Opportunity ITV Infomercial....the growth from this is going to EXPLODE....The Time to get in is NOW....if you understand the power of television advertising, you will understand the growth that is about to happen, I hope your not the one that
looks back on this two years from now, thinking to yourself, I should of
...... With Regards,
