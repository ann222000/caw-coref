My wife and I have traveled a fair amount this summer, stopping at as
many antique shops and malls as possible. I have 2 suggestions for the
mall operators in particular:

1 - Please, oh please, lose the Beanie Babies! I am so tired of seeing
these in &quot;antique&quot; malls and shops.

2 - Consider changing your summer hours to open at 9 or even 8:30 a.m.
Last weekend we hadn't found much and had money to spare but passed by 8
or more shops/malls because it wasn't 10:00 a,m, It is hard for
travelers to dawdle at the motel much past 8 and that means that the
places reached in the first 2 hours are simply bypassed. You are bound
to lose business by opening late. Small shops may have a problem with
staff, but the malls shouldn't.

Off my high horse for now, I'll walk from here. Ed

Ed,

I think that is an excellent idea. When I've been in my mall a few months and
feel it is okay to make suggestions, that is definitely one I will bring up. I
made a special trip to a town in New Jersey known for their antique shops a few
weeks ago. I got there at 10 and was shocked to learn the stores didn't open
until 11 AM. Plus they all closed at 5. Didn't give me the opportunity to
even visit all of them.

"/> Hi Ed! When I travel I have this same problem. What I usually do is get up
early, have breakfast, hop in my honkin' big antiquer van and drive a couple of
hours and then stop. I try to stop at a motel/hotel/resort/cruise ship in
no-man's land so I don't miss anything.
I have my own shop and (hold your breath) I open at 11. I know, I
know....that is late. But you cannot imagine the stuff I get done at home
(mostly for the shop) during that extra time. When I first opened I would
race into the shop around 8 or 9 thinking to catch extra traffic and I would
sit there twiddling my thumbs. Hardly anyone came in.
Anyhow, I understand your point.
:-) Fayette
Good luck and be Merry!

Same thing happened to me recently and don't you know that I spent a lot of

Near where my son goes to school, there is a small town with loads of
antique shops. Whenever we visit him, I try to include a day of antique
hunting. In this particular town, most every story has a prominently
posted sign, (some as you are walking in the door), NO PUBLIC
RESTROOMS. Well, you know what happens when I see that sign over and
over...before I know it, I have to get in the car and drive
6 miles to find one!
A comfortable browser will spend more time in a shop and spend
more money than someone who's thinking about their next
&quot;rest stop&quot;!

Thank you, thank you for that post!
While I CAN understand the original post
about opening earlier, &quot;mall owners&quot; are
not usually the folks who OPEN the malls
&amp; work in them! Opening at 9 AM involves
quite a bit of extra expense, extra person-
nel, etc. on the HOPE that an &quot;early riser&quot;
will actually come to the mall &amp; make a
purchase large enough to cover the in-
creased overhead.

"/> Hey Fayette...I understand why most shops don't provide a public restroom,
but in a town that touts itself
as &quot;.....home of 16 antiques shops&quot;, wouldn't you think a more welcoming
approach would be to provide
facilities in at least one location, and let shoppers know where they are
located? By the time you see those signs over and over it just doesn't seem
like a very friendly town.

If it's Joe of the Street, then a couple of days, a regular customer
whatever we agree, general trade buy and pay for it there and then or
leave it. Close trade colleagues whatever we agree. If it's a matter of a
*regular* customer not having the funds until the end of the month, then
I'll take a post-dated cheque or whatever and they can take the goods,

Being in a mall, with a small, narrow, store, we have the dreaded &quot;shopping
cart&quot; dilemma. A lot of people have very angry signs ( NO CARTS!!!!!) in big
red letters.....I wanted something not quite as aggressive so this is what I
came up with,(with the help of my sister):
My tiny shop is treasure fill'd
And welcomes you with cheer
But woe to those with shopping carts
There is no room
In Here!
It makes the statement without being hostile...

fireplace dealer, is renowned amongst the trade for using this ploy. Go
into his shop any day of the week and numerous items will have his little
yellow &quot;on-hold&quot; sticker, the vast majority factitiously on-hold. He
claims, it helps the next putter through the door to come to a quicker

loved it. I wanted to sell it by the end of the weekend so I said, &quot;no, I
can only hold it through the end of the day.&quot; (that was only 2 hours away).
He was in a *big* hurry and ran off without leaving a number. I had people ask
about it after he was gone and I told them the situation. Don't ya
know....big-boy-in-a-hurry ACTUALLY called back and put it on his credit card.
Sale complete. But that happens like 1 in 10 times, I would say.
I once had a woman whose husband was in a big hurry and she tossed a 20 at
me to hold a doorstop. Didn't leave a number...same story....couldn't take
the time. Don't ya know....never came back to collect the $20 or the
doorstop. I sold it after a few months to someone who couldn't live without
it.

&gt;as &quot;.....home of 16 antiques shops&quot;, wouldn't you think a more welcoming
&gt;approach would be to provide
&gt;facilities in at least one location, and let shoppers know where they are
&gt;located? By the time you see those signs over and over it just doesn't seem
&gt;like a very friendly town.

"/> Indeed, Jan. I had the same experience in downtown Orange, California,
which is chock-a-block with antique shops. None would allow use of their
toilets. Finally, I asked what a poor shopper was to do? &quot;We tell people
to go over to the coffee house and use the restrooms there.&quot; I'm sure
the people running the coffee house really appreciated having all those
non-customers stampeding through.

It's stupid for an antiques area not to provide basic comfort facilities.
It's like spending money to advertise but posting no-parking signs
everywhere.

I don't mind &quot;sold&quot; so much as &quot;hold&quot;. If I'm too late and it's already
sold, I can't complain too much. But &quot;hold&quot; is irritating. If I want it
that bad though, I'll find out how long it's to be on hold and I will call
when the time is up. If I want a piece that's sold I give the dealer my
name &amp; number &amp; tell them that if the first person changes his mind to
give me a call.
What do you think of putting out items in a display with an NFS tag on
them? I can't tell you how many times I have seen something that I would
buy instantly and I reach for the tag but it is marked &quot;NFS&quot;. I'd be
interested to know everyone's opinion on it.

The only time I put a not for sale tag on something is when I need it for display,
and I had too pay too close to retail to make a profit selling it. At least in the
Dallas area display cases tend to go at auction fairly close to retail, because
they are bought up by dealers who need the display space. Selling a piece like
that would be pointless. I wouldn't make enough to cover the cost of the time it
would take to go out and replace it. Some dealers seem to mark their display units
at exorbitant prices for this reason, but I've always felt that if someone comes in
your booth, and the first piece they look at is wildly overpriced they may not take
the time to look at a second piece.

I also tend to mark doilies not for sale, because I put them under the glass and
pottery to make the glass, pottery, and furniture look better. I don't want to
sell a doily for a few dollars, and make the expensive stuff less likely to sell.

Just my opinion.

David,
I have a number of items in my shop marked NFS.These are personal items
that I don't want to sell,but display in order for others to see or
enjoy.
Examples;
An autographed note to my mother from Rocky Marciano when she nearly
broke both of his legs just prior to his becoming world Heavyweight
Champion.
A black &amp; white picture of Clarabelle bought and signed in 1952 at
Rockaway Park and signed again by him in 1992 (Frank Morgan Jr., the son
of the actor that played The Wizard of Oz)
Two hand puppets ( Clarabelle &amp; Howdy Doody) from 1950.
Autographed pictures of Jerry Lewis from when I wrote to him in 1956.
A beautiful emerald green glass handpainted beer stein from Berlin 1890.
The first candy container made in 1876 at the Centennial in
Philidelphia. A c.c./bank of Independance Hall (in milk glass). The
Liberty Bell c.c. was also from that event.
And,a number of other items that I can't call to mind at the moment.
Many customers have thanked me for displaying these items and some
insist on trying to buy them.One fellow has been pestering me for years
to buy the Marciano autograph and he's up to $600, but it's
NFS................

David--
I fully understand your feelings about
items with &quot;hold&quot; on them. I work in an
antique mall &amp; we will not &quot;hold&quot; an item
for longer than 24 hrs. &amp; often not even
that long! We have a generous layaway
policy &amp; we DO have a number of items
on layaway at any given moment. I HATE
having to leave them on the sales floor (for
1 thing, they are subject to damage), but
our storage space is limited. We have had
only a single item not paid for on layaway
&amp; we employees are convinced this man
died or became in a coma or something.
We refer to him as &quot;the dead man&quot;&amp; after
3 months &amp; trying to trace him in any way
possible, we put the item back for sale.
I find the whole concept of &quot;holding&quot; an
antique offensive--if a person goes into a
store, they usually have to BUY what they
want &amp; there is not much opportunity to
&quot;think it over.&quot;

"/> Carolyn, IMO if something is &quot;not for sale&quot; then it shouldn't be in a
dealers shop in the first place, the only personal exception I have to
that, would be with books used for the purpose of dressing a bookcase,
for example. I am not a book dealer but would use books as decorators,
everything else is for sale, not &quot;everything&quot; would always be priced but
that a different story, more to do with trade only items.

If you read my previous post to Fayette, reference the ploy used
sometimes with the &quot;on-hold&quot; sticker, NFS is sometimes (in my area) used
very much as the same type of sales ploy, or even, sometimes to test the
market for a price, all in the hope of catching a live one on the hook.
Very much IMO the old, old story ... if you think you can't have! then
you'll want it even more.

Sometimes I will bring a customer into my house (all stuff in my home is
NFS) to show them an object, many times I hear the old cry &quot;ah I would
buy that one&quot; - &quot; will you sell me this one instead of the one in the
shop&quot; - &quot;I'll give you top money for it&quot; - &quot;why can't I have this one&quot;
etc, etc., even although before bringing them in to my house I explain
nothing is for sale. Now and again, I'll call their bluff just for a
laugh, and watch them squirm out of it. :&gt;)

I think we the dealers should run shops, not a museum, keep your museum
at home, and keep your saleables in a shop, is what I usually say to
these type of folks. :)

"/> I absolutely agree with Ronnie. NFS is unacceptable to me. Sometimes
people ask &quot;is this for sale?&quot; And I always say *everything* is for sale.
And yes, some things don't have a price tag. My cash register (which I
adore) does not have a tag. But for the right price I will sell it. And
I'll find another one, trust me.
Display pieces and doilies are a dime a dozen. (I do not mean
traditional display pieces, of course....but creative solutions to display are
everywhere). If you shop *all the time* like I do you will not worry about
replacing them. Same with books. 9 times out of 10 when I am forced to
find a new display piece I find something more interesting and it always gives
the shop a new look.

Another game played over here with the &quot;sold&quot; sticker. Most times when a
piece has been sold the original price ticket is removed and replaced
with a red sold sticker. To wind-up the tyre (tire) kickers and the dumbo
dealers that never buy but go around religiously looking and using other
dealer's prices like it's a walking price guide. So, the price tag on the
sold piece would **sometimes** be replaced with a new (phoney) price tag.

... say a piece that is £300 all day long and everyday will get a £50
price tag put on it, along with a RED sold sticker. Sit back and watch
the expressions as the dumbo come in. That one we used to play when I was
in the antiques centre (center) many moons ago.

... ah the good old days. :))

(*&lt;~ LOL Well,my degenerate gambling father had just purchased a
new Buick and wanted my mother to learn how to drive ( I suspect that he
didn't want to have to drive me and my little brother around).
My mother got a driving 'teacher' to show her how to operate
gas,brake,clutch and how to shift. After learning the basics and
practicing a little bit,mom piled brother &amp; I into the back seat and she
and the driving instructor in the front and we headed for the Brockton
park. Rocky was a hometown Brockton boy and that's where we lived. I was
born there in 1945.
The instructor was teaching my mother how to park between two cars AND
on a hill. Also teaching her to turn the wheels a certain direction to
prevent the car from rolling into traffic and how to use the clutch as a
breaking mechanism. He was teaching her to use the toe of her right foot
on the brake and the heel of the same foot on the gas.She was
overwhelmed....
After parking,the instructor was teaching her how to restart on this
steep hill and pull back out into traffic. She pushed in the clutch and
this big heavy Buick began to roll backwards. There were TWO loud noises
and our car crashed into the car parked behind us.When we all turned
around to look out the back window there was a person up 'on' our car
trunk. It seems that Rocky was out running in the park and getting in
shape for his upcoming fight and had decided to run between the two
parked cars just as dear old mom pushed in the clutch. He jumped up on
our trunk just as the two knee high chrome bumpers crashed together. He
was quite shaken at first,but very friendy after a few minutes.He calmed
my hysterical mother down and wrote her a little note and signed it.
Shortly after that he won the Heavyweight Championship.........
THE END !

My mother has also had the problem of people trying to buy things in our
family home. I remember one particular incident while having a yard sale.
Our yard sales are usually a big hit with area dealers, as we usually have
quite a few interesting (and reasonably) priced antiques and collectibles.
One dealer had come quite some distance. My mother and the dealer began
talking about the town where the dealer had her shop and soon discovered
that dealer's neighbor was my mother's old college roommate. Our toilet
is typically off limits to strangers, but after discovering that the
dealer and my mother had a mutual friend, we felt okay to oblige this
woman's request when she asked to use our bathroom. My mother collects
a particular art print from the Thirties called &quot;Old Grinny,&quot; and she has
quite a number of these, all displayed in on our bathroom walls.
Apparently this woman was taking note of her surroundings as she was using
the toilet--upon exiting the facilities, she offered to buy several of
them from my mother. My mother explained that they were not for sale at
any price, to which the woman replied, &quot;But you've got so many of them!&quot;
(One wonders if this individual was not aware of the concept of a
collection.) On the way out the door, the woman made offers on several
other items in our house. We really felt that she had taken advantage of
our kindness and had used the toilet only as a means to gain entree into
our house for the purpose of buying. In short, it seemed like she was
&quot;casing the joint,&quot; although purchase, not theft, was her intent.
Needless to say, our house is now strictly off limits during yard sales,
mutual friend or no. Once bitten, twice shy.

For what it's worth,

Graham

Her right foot on the brake and the gas pedal at the same time? Argh...
OTOH, I never could get the hang of a stick shift and trying to juggle
two feet at the same time. &lt;g&gt;

Great story!

&gt; A couple of days? See, here's why I ask. I figure that holding merchandise
&gt; at the request of an unknown Jill of the street is really just a courtesy and
&gt; if I do not have some indication that they are truly serious it really only
&gt; takes my merchandise off the sales floor and that just seems sort of
&gt; counter-productive, yes?

&gt;&gt;a regular customer
&gt;&gt;whatever we agree, general trade buy and pay for it there and then or
&gt;&gt;leave it. Close trade colleagues whatever we agree. If it's a matter of a
&gt;&gt;*regular* customer not having the funds until the end of the month, then
&gt;&gt;I'll take a post-dated cheque or whatever and they can take the goods,
&gt;&gt;same applies to *close* trade colleagues.

&gt; Yes, I agree that regular customers and colleagues are an entirely different
&gt; matter. I have regular &quot;joes&quot; (hey, this time they just *happen* to be male)
&gt; who regularly ask me to set things aside and come in days later and I know they
&gt; will always be good for their word.

&gt;&gt;Is this what you mean by &quot;hold&quot; policy? ... suppose I should really read
&gt;&gt;the thread. :)

&gt; No, no, no.....it was a question totally from left field. The rest of the
&gt; thread will give you no lead in whatsoever. Woman's perogative and all that.

&gt; See ya!

Now, wouldn't you know that there was one time I was drooling over a
fantastic Irish Crochet doily done in really fine thread and it wasn't for
sale. It's not nice to taunt us lacemakers with stuff that's NFS!! Most of
my friends who are lacemakers also collect lace. And wouldn't you know
too, that even though I saw it a few times he took it away before I could
memorize it (it was pretty complicated) so I'm left with just a
(hazy) memory.....

The problem is that at least down here, most of the doilies go retail for just a few
dollars. If I had a store where I could pull out another one when one sold and stick
it under the piece of glass, I'd have no problem, but with a booth in an antique mall,
I only get down there about twice a week, and I don't want my nice glass looking shabby
when a prospective customer spots it. I only use the doilies to try to make the
furniture and the glass look better. I tried for a while to avoid the problem by using
cheap factory made doilies that no one would want, but they don't look right, and they
cost as much for me to buy as the moderately nice old hand-made ones.

I never ask for an item to be held-I either buy it or I don't knowing
it might be gone the next time I go there. I usually go to see something a
few times before I buy it. The result is that there have been several
times when I'm glad I didn't buy something but I am NEVER sorry when I do.

That's so cruel (but I'm smiling). I can see it now-they look down and
look away-then their head jerks back-they look again-they look up to see
if anyone is looking at them-they look at the piece again-they begin to
look like they are going to cry....

&gt; Another game played over here with the &quot;sold&quot; sticker. Most times when a
&gt; piece has been sold the original price ticket is removed and replaced
&gt; with a red sold sticker. To wind-up the tyre (tire) kickers and the dumbo
&gt; dealers that never buy but go around religiously looking and using other
&gt; dealer's prices like it's a walking price guide. So, the price tag on the
&gt; sold piece would **sometimes** be replaced with a new (phoney) price tag.

&gt; ... say a piece that is £300 all day long and everyday will get a £50
&gt; price tag put on it, along with a RED sold sticker. Sit back and watch
&gt; the expressions as the dumbo come in. That one we used to play when I was
&gt; in the antiques centre (center) many moons ago.

That is a ***GREAT*** story!! But how awful if his legs had really been
broken. Your mother might have changed the course of boxing history!
Thanks for writing that up, I got a big kick out of it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Okay, now you have our attention! Do you mind telling us how your mother
&gt; almost broke Marciano's legs???? &lt;grin&gt;
&gt; Have fun, Michele

&gt; (*&lt;~ LOL Well,my degenerate gambling father had just purchased a
&gt; new Buick and wanted my mother to learn how to drive ( I suspect that he
&gt; didn't want to have to drive me and my little brother around).
&gt; My mother got a driving 'teacher' to show her how to operate
&gt; gas,brake,clutch and how to shift. After learning the basics and
&gt; practicing a little bit,mom piled brother &amp; I into the back seat and she
&gt; and the driving instructor in the front and we headed for the Brockton
&gt; park. Rocky was a hometown Brockton boy and that's where we lived. I was
&gt; born there in 1945.
&gt; The instructor was teaching my mother how to park between two cars AND
&gt; on a hill. Also teaching her to turn the wheels a certain direction to
&gt; prevent the car from rolling into traffic and how to use the clutch as a
&gt; breaking mechanism. He was teaching her to use the toe of her right foot
&gt; on the brake and the heel of the same foot on the gas.She was
&gt; overwhelmed....
&gt; After parking,the instructor was teaching her how to restart on this
&gt; steep hill and pull back out into traffic. She pushed in the clutch and
&gt; this big heavy Buick began to roll backwards. There were TWO loud noises
&gt; and our car crashed into the car parked behind us.When we all turned
&gt; around to look out the back window there was a person up 'on' our car
&gt; trunk. It seems that Rocky was out running in the park and getting in
&gt; shape for his upcoming fight and had decided to run between the two
&gt; parked cars just as dear old mom pushed in the clutch. He jumped up on
&gt; our trunk just as the two knee high chrome bumpers crashed together. He
&gt; was quite shaken at first,but very friendy after a few minutes.He calmed
&gt; my hysterical mother down and wrote her a little note and signed it.
&gt; Shortly after that he won the Heavyweight Championship.........
&gt; THE END !
