Subject: Urgent Update!

Dear Friends in Christ, The last few days here have been a real challenge. Steve went back to his doctor late last week and was put on a drug called Altase. He had a severe reaction to it and nearly died. He ended up spending a couple of days in the hospital. He is fighting a valiant fight, but so far he is losing that battle as his heart continues to weaken. Add this to the incredible financial crisis we are in and it truly feels like the world is falling on top of us and that all we see is more and more darkness. Please continue to keep Steve in your prayers. We truly need a few Christmas miracles. I still firmly believe that if enough of God's people lift us up to the Lord that Steve WILL BE HEALED and we will somehow survive the financial crisis we are in. We are expecting 2008 to be a great year when we will be able to give God all the glory for seeing us through these very dark days. Thank you again, for your prayers. Right now I don't think I (we) could survive without them. They have given both Steve and I the strength to keep fighting what right now seems like an impossible situation. God bless you and may you have a Very Merry Christmas and a Safe and Happy New Year!

Your Friend in Christ, Debbie Sirback

This is my friend, Reverend Jackass. For the most part he's a victim of a Bible college or a denominational group; but he won't allow God to take those blinders off of him. Someday soon he will have to give an account of all the things he believes &amp; teaches &amp; really needs our prayers that God will begin to draw him all the way into the kingdom before it's too late for the high calling. If you know a Reverend Jackass, please begin to pray for him today. And please pray for those like him before it's too late for the high calling.
LORD God, there are a lot of Reverend Jackasses out there who are genuine victims of theology. I ask You to please remove their blinders like you removed mine. I ask You to reveal all of the errors in their beliefs to them &amp; give them the courage to change. I ask You to give them wisdom &amp; reveal the truth to them today &amp; get them on the straight &amp; narrow way before it's too late. I receive a miracle in their lives today through the merit of the blood of Jesus &amp; I thank You for it.

And she said the lady is scared to death so please pray she will be ok and it is nothing to worry about.

And the child with Wagener’s she laid around at school yesterday and today she went up to the nurse she has her joints her ankles and wrist and now its going into her fingers she cant move several of them she couldn’t hardly walk when I was there and the mother said she cried all night long so she sat up all night rubbing her daughters feet and ankles all night then put the kids on bus and took that lady to the hospital. they all upset so I do not no how they will sleep tonight they got news from the Dr at UVA that her blood work was horrible he said it is all messed up its worse now than it was when she was first diagnosed with the disease. if things do not change I think they gonna end up in the hospital for Christmas again this year.
I just do not understand how some people have to suffer so much and it sad. I think the Drs are gonna end up getting together now and see what is gonna happen now before things get worse I do not no what they gonna do or how the mother is gonna hold up if things get any worse she is still bleeding I told her go make sure things are ok with her. Any prayers or donations would be very good.

I put them on another prayer thing too and here is what one of the responses was from someone here is what they said: “Lord, let everyone search their hearts tonight and reach out and touch this family. A lot of you are leery to send money thinking scam etc, Well people, if we do that we are letting the devil take full control of our lives as Christians. Lord, help me help this family any amount at all will help, and Lord, open up church families in the area in VA and let them all reach out and help this family, if everyone on this prayer site could send $20 dollars, you go to Wal-Mart and spend that in a split second, I am sending this family money and I pledge you too do the same, We will be so blessed in our hearts.

PRAYER REQUEST!

My brother-in-law Bill L. has had hip surgery on both hips a few months ago and one of them didn't take and he had to have it done over.

They need a miracle from God.

Friends please join me in prayer for all the family members of the man who lost his life today in an accident in Dallas County. The man who was killed is an uncle of my husband's, and father-in-law to one of my very best friends. He was John Parker and was married to Aunt Alice (Kennedy). He was a very kind man, and will be greatly missed by many----especially by his wife Alice. He was in his truck driving down the road, when 3 hunters saw a hog. One of them raised his gun and shot at the hog. Then he heard a motor rev up, then wreck. When they went to check on him he had been shot----the back of his head blown off, His friends and family really need your prayers.
Thank you so much,
Fran

Friends,
Also please help me pray for my son-in-law, Danny Conklin----and all of his family members. He was in the hospital for 2 months. Got out for 2 days, then had to return to the hospital. I think they have decided to put him in hospice care, when he goes he will have a private room at St. Joe's in Hot Springs----but can never go to a hospital again, have CPR, etc. or the IV antibiotics he takes so much of . He can only say a few words at a time, then has to rest. Once he goes to hospice I don't think he will be there long. Please pray for him as he is preparing to soon leave this world----and for all who he will be leaving behind. Thank you again. I don't know how anyone could survive without praying friends. Love you all, Fran

Friday's update on Bobby Trice

GOD IS WORKING...REMEMBER AS YOU READ THIS THAT JUST ONE WEEK AGO THIS MAN WAS FLOWN TO A LARGER HOSPITAL BECAUSE HE WAS NEAR DEATH.

I called Marcia today and she told me that they had put the catheter in Bobby's head to direct the antibiotics directly to the infected area.

A specialist in these kinds of disorders was called in and she said this is quicker and more direct than antibiotics by IV.

The specialist also questioned Bobby about whether or not he had recently had a sinus infection or an infected tooth. She said most often this type of thing is caused from a sinus abscess rupturing into the brain.

Since we have been praying for him, he and Marcia feel more peaceful and she told me it increased her faith tremendously each time I prayed with her on the phone.

She said if things go as planned that Bobby will most likely be moved from critical care into a regular hospital room. What a marvelous improvement.

Marcia was still marveling that Bobby's hiccups stopped just long enough for him to have the MRI after I prayed with her about it. GOD IS AWESOME.

I always say that our prayers are like the small smooth stones that David chose from the brook to use as ammunition against Goliath the giant. We pray and the power of God moves against the giant.

Please keep praying for Bobby's full and speedy recovery.

Marcia wants me to THANK ALL OF YOU for praying for Bobby. I have been telling her what a wonderful group of prayer warriors I am aquatinted with and how you unselfishly pray for people you have never met. God's children are the best.

Have a blessed weekend.

Hugs,

prayer request

I sent this name out earlier today on a request. Here are more details on Karen.

The Webb family from Saltillo. 2 yr old Jack Webb died today when the car his mother was driving was struck by another car at hwy 45 and Euclatubba Rd. He wasn't restrained and was ejected.

As is typical...I went to this call not knowing the age of the victim. It was horrific....and I-along with the medics and volunteers were crying while attempting to do our jobs. It makes me so so thankful for my healthy girls....and thankful that I know that death doesn't have to be an eternal seperation....but, I just cannot fathom losing my baby!

Please pray for the mother's healing as she received a head injury. Her name is Karen Webb. As I was told, Jack was a miracle baby anyway. She was told she couldn't have a baby due to a previous cancer.
Now, he's Heaven's miracle baby!

Sincerely,
Carolyn Gillentine

Prayer Requests today

Lennie called to let us know that doctors have given Roger, her
brother-in-law, one week to live. Katie, his wife needs all of our
prayers now more than ever. Lennie is praying that the Lord will wait
till after Christmas to call Roger home with Him. Lennie knew Chirstmas
would be especially hard on Katie and the rest of the family if they had
to face the loss of Roger at this particular time. Please pray this
prayer with Lennie.

I talked with Karen Salters. Ross is down to one kind of antibiotic now.
The doctors are considering removing the tube from his lung once again.
Karen said they are hopeful the infeciton is under control and subsiding.
We were asked to pray that when Ross is released he will be healed, free
of dependence of the antibiotics which cost 3500 per IV bag that the
family will be required to pay for when he goes home if he should still
need them.

of his entire family...

Please pray for my son, Allan
going through a difficult time
financially. He's been hard at
work, but satan has blocked
his being paid for work done
the last 2 weeks from several
projects. Pray that he will be
paid in FULL and quickly.
Also,
I have a rec that is payable
monthly, and now
circumstances seem to have
changed so I am not recieving
payment or not on time. This is
my main source of income.

The two combined has created
a financial crisis for our family.
We need your prayer for wisdom
and protection against the
onslaught of the enemy of
our souls! We know that these
kinds of things do not happen
unless instigated by ole slewfoot.
BUT:
God IS on our side, and He will
prevail! He is my defender, my
Father, my Brother and He also
promises to be a Husband for
the widow. He has never failed
me, He has always provided for
me and for my family, and He
will see to it that His children
are not reduced to begging
for bread. ~ Psalm 37:23-25

PRAYER: Johnny Lopez / Doctors say terminal cancer

Prayers needed for Johnny Lopez
His Dr. says he has Terminal cancer, without long to live, his brother David is asking for prayers for
God to preform a miracle on Johnny, Johnny was with the Houma Police for quiet a few years. As
Jesus cursed the barren fig tree so we ask Him to curse this useless cancer. I'm believing Matthew 15:13
But He answered and said, “Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.
Our knowledge tells us that cancer is rooted so agree with me in asking God in Jesus Christ's powerful
name to curse these roots in Johnny Lopez's body. By faith in Him I see it done, amen

By: Dr Charles Stanley

From what we've examined in this chapter. I hope you clearly
understand this; A person who harbors unforgiveness always loses. Regardless
of how wrong the other person may have been, refusing to forgive means
reaping corruption in life. And that corruption begins in one relationship
including the relationship with God, and works its way into all the rest.
Holding on to hurt is like grabbing a rattlesnake by the tail; you are going to get bitten. As the poison of bitterness works its way through the many facets of your personality, death will occur - that is more far-reaching than your physical death, for it has the potential to destroy those around you as well.

Eternal Life, Health, and Prosperity
by Dr. Larry Ollison

Many scriptures refer to Jesus as being our substitute. He carried the curse on the cross so we wouldn't have to.

The curse of the law had three basic divisions.

The complete curse:
1) Spiritual death
2) Sickness and disease
3) Poverty

The redemption:
1) Eternal life (Hebrews 9:12)
2) Health and healing (1 Peter 2:24)
3) Prosperity (2 Corinthians 8:9)

Unfortunately, many people stop after one third of the curse has been broken in their life. Jesus paid the price to break the entire curse of the law, which included poverty, sickness, and spiritual death. We are good at telling people they need to become spiritually alive. We even tell them that when Jesus died on the cross, He became a curse (Galatians 3:13) and because He was cursed, we’re not cursed anymore.

Why stop there? What about the curse of sickness and disease? What about the curse of poverty? He became our substitute in those things, too. The scripture clearly tells us so. He paid the price you couldn’t pay so that you can be rich.

He took the curse of poverty for you and He paid the price. 2 Corinthians 8:9 says, “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.”

This scripture can only mean that Jesus was the substitute for your poverty. He was the propitiation for that part of the curse of the law for you.

One time I heard a preacher say, “I don’t want to use the word ‘rich.’ I’m just going to say ‘doing well.’” Is it wrong to quote the Bible? Some denominations don’t want to use the word “blood” because they’re afraid it’s offensive. Other denominations don’t want to use the word “rich” because it’s offensive. Who decides which words we take out of the Bible and which ones we don’t?

I believe if you are healthy, spiritually alive and you’ve got some money in the bank, you can do more for the Gospel than if you’re lying on your back in a hospital with a dead spirit and you’re dead broke.

The devil does not want you living the Gospel. The scripture says, “For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil” (1 John 3:8). What are the works of the devil? In John 10:10, Jesus tells us, “The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy…” Sounds like the curse of the law to me. The devil wants to kill you. He wants you spiritually dead. He wants to steal from you. He wants to destroy your body.

The devil wants you to live under the curse. Jesus shed His blood so you wouldn’t have to live under the curse. Jesus wants you blessed.

Mountaintop Experiences
I will not... speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me.
For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which Christ worked through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, &amp;#13;&amp;#10;' style=&quot;MARGIN-TOP: 4px; FONT-SIZE: 14px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.2em; FONT-FAMILY: Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,Sans-serif; TEXT-DECORATION: none&quot; href=&quot; http://www.thevine.co.nz/bible/book/romans/15/18 &quot;&gt;Romans 15:18 NIV
One day Jesus took His disciples to the top of a mountain where He was transfigured before them: &quot;His face shone like the sun, and His clothes became as white as the light. Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus&quot; (He was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his garments became as white as the light. &amp;#13;&amp;#10;Behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them talking with him. &amp;#13;&amp;#10;' style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13px; MARGIN: 4px 0px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.2em; FONT-FAMILY: Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,Sans-serif; TEXT-DECORATION: none&quot; href=&quot; http://www.thevine.co.nz/bible/book/matthew/17/2/-/3 &quot;&gt;Matthew 17:2-3 NIV). Peter was so caught up in the experience that he wanted to stay there. &quot;Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters - one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah&quot; (Peter answered, and said to Jesus, &quot;Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you want, let's make three tents here: one for you, one
for Moses, and one for Elijah.&quot; &amp;#13;&amp;#10;&quot; style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13px; MARGIN: 4px 0px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.2em; FONT-FAMILY: Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,Sans-serif; TEXT-DECORATION: none&quot; href=&quot; http://www.thevine.co.nz/bible/book/matthew/17/4 &quot;&gt;Matthew 17:4 NIV). But Jesus said &quot;No,&quot; and led them down the mountain to minister to a demon-possessed boy. It's good to have mountaintop experiences with God; but you can't stay there. There's work to be done and you have been called to do it!
In the Old Testament tabernacle the High Priest went into the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; once a year where he had the privilege of seeing the glory of the Lord. But the work of the Lord was done outside amongst the people! Imagine being in God's presence to such an extent that the building shakes around you. It happened to Isaiah (Click on the link to read this Bible passage' style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13px; MARGIN: 4px 0px; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.2em; FONT-FAMILY: Arial,Verdana,Tahoma,Sans-serif; TEXT-DECORATION: none&quot; href=&quot; http://www.thevine.co.nz/bible/book/isaiah/6/1/-/4 &quot;&gt;Isaiah 6:1-4). But afterwards he had to go out and perform the purposes of God. There's a balance. We must spend quality time with God, then carry away from His presence the answers needed by those around us.
Paul said, &quot;I will not… speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me.&quot; Paul didn't glory in what Christ had done for him, but in what Christ was doing through him. Getting the idea? It's time to come down from the mountain and go to work!

Messages in this topic (1) 8. ~Daily InspirationaL~   PEACE IN THE EYE OF THE STORM         DECEMB Posted by: &quot;GraceNTheTruth2@Aol.Com&quot; GraceNTheTruth2@Aol.Com gracenthetruth Sat Dec 8, 2007 9:02 pm (PST)

PEACE IN THE EYE OF THE STORM
by Dale E. Price

The storm is terrible. We have been struggling against the winds and the sea
for hours in our small boat. There is no sign of it letting up, and the waves
are beginning to crash over our bow. We're losing the battle. I am truly
frightened.

How can He sleep through all this? Can't He feel the water sloshing in the
bottom of the boat? Doesn't He know how perilous our situation is? Doesn't He
care? Finally, I can't stand it, so I tell John to wake Him up. John shakes Him
awake and tells Him we're about to die. But the Master is not afraid. Instead,
He rebukes us for our lack of faith. He turns His face into the wind and
rebukes the wind and the sea. At His command, the storm ceases, and the sea is
calm.

We're amazed! Who is this man that can calm the storm?

On September 11, violent aggression crashed against our homeland. Waves of
darkness, anger, sorrow, and fear assaulted our sense of safety and security.
The winds of hate and violence tear at us, trying to rob us of our peace and
joy. As believers in Christ Jesus, what can we learn from the disciples'
experience described in Matthew 8:23-27? Three questions come to mind.

* How could Jesus sleep in the midst of the storm?

Throughout Jesus' life we find Him at peace when circumstances cast others
into a sea of doubt and fear. What did He know that they didn't? He knew and
believed what He had taught in the Sermon on the Mount, that we are more precious
to God than all of the rest of creation. He also knew that His life on earth
was truly in the Father's hands. He knew God's prophetic Word that &quot;He will
command His angels concerning You to guard You in all Your ways. They will bear
You up in their hands, so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone&quot;
(Psalm 21:11-12). Jesus could rest peacefully because He was resting in the
hands of His loving Father, the hands of the God of all creation.

* Didn't He care about their fears?

I John 4:18 tells us that &quot;There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts
out fear ... &quot; He cared about their fears, but He cared more about their faith.
In this world, we will have trouble. Do we believe that God is in control of
every breath, every heartbeat, and every day of our life on earth? Romans
8:37-39 tells us that in the midst of famine, persecution, or the sword, we are
more than conquerors. There is nothing in the vast universe that can separate us
from the love of God in Christ Jesus!

* Why did Jesus rebuke them for their lack of faith?

It was evening when they set out in that boat. The disciples had witnessed
Jesus' miraculous healing throughout the day. Who did they think was in the boat
with them? He rebuked them because their faith in Him did not extend to their
immediate perilous circumstance. When we believe in Jesus Christ as God's
only begotten Son, the image (exact representation) of the Father, full of grace
and truth, we believe that our eternity is in His hands. Is it too much to ask
that we trust Him with the troubles of this life? The reason we can walk
through this life without fear is that we know the one that is in our boat, and we
know the one whose boat it is.

Each of us must face our own doubts, fears, and insecurities in the midst of
this storm tearing at our homeland. When we find His peace in the eye of the
storm, we must lift our eyes to see those still struggling against the tempest.
We must seek the ministry God has for us in our hour of national and
international distress. I believe that there are three critical roles for believers
and for Christian ministries as we confront this present darkness.

1. We must shine in the midst of the darkness. The greater the darkness, the
more brilliant we must shine. If we only shine within the walls of our local
assemblies or in our Christian camp facilities nestled in beautiful canyons or
perched on lofty mountaintops, who will see? The pain and the loss of
September 11 are still rippling through the lives of our friends and neighbors. We
must actively demonstrate compassion, gentleness, peace, and love within our
communities. Doors of opportunity for hospitality and gracious giv-ing are open to
us now. We must actively seek for those doors and then walk through them
boldly.

2. We must be places of safety and security. The families of America need to
know that there are still places of beauty where they and their children can
be out of harm's way. Local assemblies must reach out to individuals and
families in their communities to provide the Word of Truth, spoken in love, from
hearts filled with God's compassion. In Christian camps, our selection and
preparation of staff, our health and safety programs, the security of our grounds
and facilities, and our emergency response procedure are all criti-cal to
creating and maintaining a safe camp environment for all our guests. We must
remember that camp, in order to be camp, will never be totally risk-free. But we must
be both diligent and prudent in our efforts to ensure that every child or
family who attends our fellowship, every camper, or guest at our camps will be
safe while in our care.

3. We must be places with an answer. Peter tells us in his first epistle that
we are always to be ready&quot; ... to make a defense to everyone who asks you to
give an account for the hope that is in you, yet with gentleness and
reverence.&quot; When we can rest like Jesus in the midst of the storm people will ask why.
Doors of ministry opportunity will open for us in the midst of the despair and
devastation caused by sinful men. Children and families will come to us whose
world has been turned upside down. Lives built on the shifting sands of
wealth and false expectations of peace have been shaken. We need to bring them to
the Rock, the Chief Cornerstone. They need to find in Him an anchor for the
soul, sure and steadfast. They need to know that this anchor holds through every
storm this life can throw at us. The spontaneous singing of &quot;God Bless
America&quot; across our nation has moved many of us with hope for a true revival. I pray
that they will all come to know, through Jesus Christ, the God to whom they
are appealing.

* Does the Lord still have power over the storm?

When Jesus calmed the wind and the sea, He demonstrated His authority and
power over the storm. Does He have power over the winds of violence and waves of
hatred assaulting us now? I believe that this storm, like the storm that
terrified the disciples two thousand years ago, will test our faith. We must never
forget that as believers in the Lord Jesus we are in His boat. We must rest in
His peace. In the end, this storm will prove anew the demonstra-tion of the
power and love of God and an opportunity for believers to be God's loving
ambassadors sharing the truth of the Gospel of God's Grace.

Messages in this topic (1) 9. PASTORAL MESSAGE Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Sat Dec 8, 2007 9:09 pm (PST) Pastoral Message
1997 - 2007: Its Ten Year Anniversary!
Sunday, 9 December 2007

Pastor T. J. de Ruiter, The Netherlands

Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.

Proverbs 25:25 (RSV)

Here is good news, it is very encouraging: Jesus Christ, who was born in Bethlehem, more than two thousand years ago, is still alive. He overcame death and ascended to heaven. From His throne in heaven He is in control of everything and still pours out his Spirit in thirsty hearts that believe in and want to receive from Him.

The wise writer of Proverbs knew the refreshing power of good news for those who are far from home, missing its love, warmth and safety. This reminds us of the Gospel as the message coming from the heart of our Father in heaven, communicating life and love, with peace, mercy and protection.

It is possible that you are under pressure because of unrighteousness and corruption. You may even be intimidated and manipulated. In such a situation and you feel yourself as in a 'far country.' Do not get fearful and withstand intimidation.

Here is an encouraging word of the apostle Paul that can be meaningfully included in this message today. It is 2 Corinthians 5:6,7, &quot;So we are always of good courage; we know that while we are at home in the body we are far away from the Lord, for we walk by faith, not by sight. We are of good courage....&quot;

You are in a far country in this season of Advent? Fix your eye on the Lord, walk by faith, be refreshed, keep good courage and be strong!

1997 - 2007: een Tien Jarig Jubileum!
Zondag, 9 december 2007
Pastor T. J. de Ruiter
Een goed bericht uit een ver land is als koel water voor een dorstige keel.

Spreuken 25:25 (NBV)

Hier is goed nieuws - het is zeer bemoedigend: Jezus Christus die meer dan tweeduizend jaar geleden in Betlehem werd geboren, leeft nog steeds. Hij heeft de dood overwonnen en voer op naar de hemel. Hij regeert vanaf zijn troon in de hemel, heeft alles onder controle en stort zijn Geest uit in dorstige harten die in Hem geloven en van Hem willen ontvangen.

De wijze spreukenschrijver wist dat een goede boodschap uit het thuisland een verkwikkende werking heeft voor hen die de liefde, warmte en geborgenheid van het eigen huis moeten missen. Dit herinnert ons aan het evangelie, want dat is de boodschap die uit het hart van onze hemelse Vader komt. De boodschap communiceert Gods leven en liefde, met genade en bescherming.

Het kan zijn dat jij nu onder druk staat omdat er ongerechtigheid en corruptie in je nabijheid werkzaam zijn. Misschien word je door anderen geïntimideerd en gemanipuleerd. In een dergelijke situatie kunt u zich geestelijk als in een 'ver land' weten. Laat je geen angst aanjagen en weersta intimidatie in de naam van Jezus.

Hier is een bemoedigend woord van Paulus dat we ook zinvol bij deze boodschap kunnen betrekken, 2 Korintiërs 5:6,7: &quot;Dus blijven wij altijd vol goede moed, ook al weten we dat zolang dit lichaam onze woning is, we ver van de Her wonen. We leven in vertrouwen op God.&quot;

Je bent in een ver land in deze Adventstijd? Zie op de Heer, wandel in geloof, word verfrist, houd goede moed en blijf sterk!

Second Sunday of Advent

Now there were in the same country shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Luke 2:8

One shepherd and one tiny lamb. I add them to the creche, thinking of the Bethlehem shepherds....I remember how surprised I was recently when I discovered in a New Testament graduate course that in Jesus' day sheepherding was considered a dishonorable profession, and shepherds were shunned because they didn't keep the myriad of religious rituals and observances demanded in that day. In fact, according to the renowned Bible scholar, Joachim Jeremias, they were stigmatized men, disdained by society! A prohibition existed against buying a lamb or even goat's milk from a shepherd. How curious that God would give the first news of Christ's birth to such a group. Why not the pious ones of Jerusalem?

The shepherd and lamb stir to life in my imagination as I travel back to Bethlehem...I stand on a chilly hillside beneath a sky of crystal stars. &quot;Did you find him?&quot; I hear someone shout from the distance.

Not yet Father,&quot; calls a young man nearby.

Have you lost someone?&quot; I ask.

&quot;One of the lambs,&quot; he says, motioning me to follow. I wander after him on and on, climbing the rock studded hills into the darkness. Finally we come upon the lamb, caught in the coils of a strange plant that grows long sharp thorns. The young shepherd pulls him free and binds his wounds with tenderness.

Just then a heavenly light breaks into the night. Then singing. &quot;I bring you good tidings of great joy,&quot; says an angel.

As I watch the shepherd hurry away, the lamb cradled in his arms, my journey fades. I gaze at the wooden figure of the shepherd. Maybe he had failed to meet all the religious standards of the day. But perhaps God picked him because he represented something far more important: caring.

The caring that took him into dark places to bind the wounds of one small lamb. And suddenly I remember...Jesus would one day refer to Himself as a shepherd. For Him love would always take precedence over everthing.

Do you hear the shepherd in the nativity? He calls us to pause in our holiday traditions, even in our religious rituals, to care. He asks us to follow him into dark places, to touch the world's wounds....to love.

This Chistmas, Lord, give me a shepherd's heart. Sue Monk Kidd

Messages in this topic (1) 12. TIME IS YOURS Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Sat Dec 8, 2007 9:27 pm (PST)

Where has the time gone? It has not gone but has been going, and continues to go into making you who you are. The moments and hours, months and years seem to pass by at an ever-quickening pace. But they are filling you up, not passing you by.
For you are busy becoming who you will become, and expressing who you are. As time moves past it is never lost, but woven forever into the fabric of your life.

It is never too early and it is never too late to fully live the moment that is here right now. And the more you make of it, the more valuable it will always be to you.

The clock just keeps on ticking, and what it measures is not what you are losing but what you are continuing to gain. You always have the opportunity to make this moment, this day, this year even better than the last, better in fact than ever before.

Time is yours in which to live, to grow, to love and to experience. The more of it you've known, the richer you become.

Messages in this topic (1) 13. HOW TO HAVE A BLESSED CHRISTMAS Posted by: &quot;Mary Ann&quot; HeartforGod7@shaw.ca serenity72000 Sat Dec 8, 2007 9:50 pm (PST) How to Have a Blessed Christmas

by Jewel Diamond Taylor

The holidays can trigger feelings of melancholy, stress and depression. Try not to get caught up in the hype, materialism, commercialism or illusions that holidays bring. Keep it simple and remember the reason for the season.

Watch out for the battle of the bulge (eating too much), the battle of the budget (spending too much), the battle of the booze (drinking), and the battle of the blues (depression)!

Holiday Tips

Make creative gifts like: candles, baked goods, greeting cards, record a loved one's favorite musical selections on an audio tape or CD, create a collage of photographs, a poem on fancy paper, a special greeting or memory recorded on a video tape, give gift certificates for a massage, pedicure, pampering services or books.

Don't allow excuses (i.e., family grudges, my house needs painting, I need new furniture, I don't have enough chairs) to keep you from enjoying family and friends. Don't procrastinate. Enjoy family and friends now. Being around laughter and good food is healing. If your money is a low, don't be embarrassed to ask everyone to bring a dish (sweet potato pie, peach cobbler, greens, macaroni and cheese or the beverages). Even if everyone has to bring a chair because you have only one couch, so what! Ask them to bring a chair and a card table.

Parents, don't allow your children to make you feel guilty and pressure you into spending and shopping until you drop. Stay within your budget and don't allow your children's begging, harassment or tantrums stress you out. You may feel inadequate because you're unemployed, single, going through a divorce or because you see everyone around you buying the latest and greatest gifts. You'll find yourself in financial bondage if you allow your child to buy you a first class ticket for a guilt trip.

Take some time with your family and friends and share your blessings, achievements and testimonies from this past year. Share your goals and plans for the new year. Each one write down at least three goals you have for the new year. Place them in separate sealed envelopes and pray together over them asking for God's guidance, grace and blessings. Next year all of you plan to meet again at the end of the year to review and celebrate your achievements.

The holidays have become less consecrated and more commercial. Let us put the words &quot;holy&quot; back into &quot;holidays&quot; and &quot;Christ&quot; back into &quot;Christmas.&quot; As we heal on a national and personal level from the sorrow and changes in our lives, I know you join me in strengthening your faith, courage and relationships with the Lord, family, friends and community. Let us give the best gifts all year like acts of kindness, service, compassion, charity and encouragement.
