Over at the University of Virginia , Professor Al Groh has agreed to
a deal that runs through Dec. 31, 2010, and includes a rollover
provision that could extend his tenure well past that date. The
contract, which was signed this month, boosts his annual compensation to
$1.7 million for the coming year -- $240,000 in base salary and $1.46
million for services that include fundraising work, radio and TV
appearances and product endorsements.

By 2010, Groh may be making significantly more than $1.7 million.
Athletic Director Craig Littlepage said Groh is eligible for a 5 percent
cost-of-living increase that would be applied to his total compensation
package annually. By the 2010 season, then, Groh's annual package may be
worth around $2.17 million. At Virginia Tech , Professor Frank Beamer is
renegotiating his paltry $1.3 million annual salary and is also fighting
to increase the salaries of the adjunct professors who teach sections of
his class. Nine of them are forced to subsist on $1.1 million.

Look, I love a good college football game as much as the next guy.
But when I see these salary wars while university presidents bemoan
their appropriations and raise tuition (which includes a fee that goes
to athletics), I want to tell the hat-in-hand higher education lobby to
"shut up."

Voters, citizens, taxpayers, whatever you want to call them, are
voting on their priorities with their dollars. The higher education
lobby ought to be going to the football programs for more money, not the
legislature.

One problem, Virginia law prohibits public colleges and universities
from using tuition dollars or state funds to support intercollegiate
athletics. All money for these programs must be raised from student
fees, ticket sales, media revenues, product sales, licensing agreements,
user fees and private donations.

UVA is actually below the state average in student fees (the highest?
VMI) Tech is as well. Hmmm what's going on here? Looks like the
exorbitant salaries aren't actually spilling over onto the students!

Yea I thought those salaries are paid by the atheletic departments,
which are seperate budgets from the general fund of the university.

Oh, I know the explanation that intercollegiate athletics is
"separate." Who does the athletic director work for?

Some years ago I was the RT-D "Correspondent of the Day" for a letter
in which I proposed that big-time football and basketball programs be
de-coupled from universities. The "Virginia Tech Athletic Club" would be
formed. They would pay the university to use their name and would
buy/pay rent on any and all university assets they used. Players need
not be university students--they could be paid in salary and/or tuition
reimbursement. Student activity fees would not go to them unless it was
a voluntary ticket purchase deal.

When Marcus Vick got arrested, it would be the athletic club
answering critics, not Charles Steger.

I stand by my idea and wish the NCAA would acknowledge reality and
endorse for it for Division I schools.

Will,

I agree that the university is obviously tied to the athletic
program. I'm just saying no taxpayer dollars are going to pay Beamer or
Groh, except for the people getting financial aid to pay their athletic
fees.

As to the athletic director, I imagine that is the university's
employee but I don't know for sure.

I wish I could remember exactly what President Steger said last year,
but he said something about the athletic program becoming an even more
seperate entity from the university than it currently is. Whenever I get
more info, ill let ya know.

One other thing Will, you have a good idea, but someone already bet
you to it. Its called the NBA and NFL.

If you made these sports programs seperate totally from the
universities, they would be just like NBA and NFL teams, free to do
whatever they want, as long as its allowed by the rules of the
sanctioning body.

Will, my heart agrees with you. The resources lavished upon college
athletics apalls me -- even more so if some of those resources come
(whether directly or indirectly) from taxpayer dollars. The public
interest in supporting higher education is educating the citizenry and
providing people with the skills they need to prosper in a globally
competitive, knowledge-based economy -- not to perpetuate tribal
loyalties around athletic totems.

But I have to say this: Like it or not, there's nothing like a strong
athletic program to generate positive publicity and increase the number
of student applications. Athletics, it seems, has quite a halo effect.

Jim, I agree totally with your second paragraph. That's why my
proposal maintains a link between the university and the "club." It
would still be the Hokies and Cavaliers kicking ACC ass.

Players would have a choice of being student-athletes, just athletes,
or athletes deferring their education.

Players would be compensated for their hard work. Professor Groh and
Professor Beamer shouldn't be the only ones making a buck.

With the two major sports removed from university authority, Title IX
could be more rationally administered. One possible drawback of my plan
would be that to the extent some football and basketball revenues go to
support "minor" sports, these minor sports might not be funded as well.

Of course, the clubs could donate to the university to help support
minor sports ....

Will, your idea is a worthy one. Keep on flogging it -- maybe someone
will pay attention!

Will, the NCAA is getting closer to endorsing your idea. In their
last meeting, they voted to include "Students selected as professional
draft picks" as valid exclusions from the graduaton rate cohort (the
denominator in the formula).

What this means is that the NCAA is implicitly admitting the
collegiate athletics are apprenticeship programs for professional
sports.

And that the completing the degree that the student ostensibly signed
up for doesn't really matter.

And let's be clear about state law and funding athletic programs -
state funding does indeed support athletic programs in the form of the
student subsidy and financial aid at public institutions and TAG at
private institutions. < $BlogBacklinkSnippet$>
