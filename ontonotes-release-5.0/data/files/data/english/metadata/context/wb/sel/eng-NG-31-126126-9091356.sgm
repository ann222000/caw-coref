Virtually every Wednesday (though not today as I'm pressed for time
before work), I make the trek that many others do:  to the comic book
store (which these days, seems less like a comic store than a place
for gamers, but that's another story).  When I get my pulled comics, I
always peruse the shelves, just in case there's a book I forgot to
pick up, or there's a hidden title that I'd been meaning to get.  Once
I've made my purchases (I know my comic shop loves me, as I spend more
than $100 on new comics a month), I go sit in my car and read.  I turn
the car on to get a little AC, then crank the music down very low and
get lost in the weeks' stash.  Last week, while reading the latest
issue of Countdown, I started wondering where everyone else on here
reads their comics?
In the car?
In the study?
In the living room?
On the toilet?
At the office?
In the bed?

I usually flip through one or two in the car and then read them at
home.  I've been known to drive back from the store and then read one
in my car in the office parking lot, but not often.

In college, I used to pick up my comics and then go to Godfather's Pizza
(yeah, that dates me).  They had a cheap lunch buffet and zero business
at 11 am.  I'd read my comics and scarf down pizza.

Nowadays, its lunchtime reading in my cubicle only after the kids are
finished with them.

My comic shop is lterally two minutes from where I work, so I pop round
there in my lunch time, peruse the shelves etc before getting my 'stash'
handed to me. I'll probably have a chat for a few minutes with the shop crew
and a few regulars I know who may be in there at the same time, then I'll
pop back to work. I then read the comics in the remainder of my lunch break,
usually with a cup of tea. :O)

The ones I don't get to I read at home later.

I usually pick up my stash during lunch, so I read three or four in
the car, weather permitting.  Maybe get a page or two in on the way
home.   From that point on it's usually either on the toilet or in
bed.  On occasion I take one out to the den and read while reclining
on the sofa.

It depends - I often start in the queue for the till, if it's long enough
(Forbidden Planet in London can get very busy). Then, if I'm going for food,
I'll often read another one or two there or, if I'm being dragged around the
shops with my significant other, I'll read them standing/sitting out of the
way while she's in the changing room. Otherwise, it's usually on the bus
home or back to work if I go Thursday lunchtime and any leftovers at home on
the sofa/at my desk in work.

My FLCS is a short ways from my workplace. Every Wednesday, I walk down,
pick up my books, and catch the bus from there. I scan all my comics
casually on the way home, absorbing the basics. Then I read them more
carefully throughout the week, one or two a day, flopped on the couch after
work.  And every other week I take a few comics, new and old, down to the
laundromat with me to kill time.

On my way home from work, I stop at the LCS, which is only about 3/4
of a mile from my house. Usually, I get to the LCS before they've
finished pulling books for folders, so they just hand me mine instead
of putting it in my folder. Before I check out, I peruse the wall for
anything else new that piques my interest (or that I haven't put on my
pull list).

My LCS looks more like a headshop than a gaming store. The guy who
runs it is in a local band, so he has lots of music memorabilia, indy
CDs, DVDs, etc., but still mostly comics... and actions figures.

Before going home, I stop at the *other* LCS (local coffee shop and
*not* a Starbucks :P), which is right around the corner from my house.
I sit in my usual corner of the patio and read while drinking my iced
coffee and listening to the Michael Baisden talk radio show.

Here's why 21 days doesn't bother me:

1) It is a pretty short amount of time to wait, compared with waiting for it
to come out as a graphic novel, like many people do these days. (What's
that - like a 6 month wait before you get to read them?)

2) I still get the issues once a month, roughly 4 weeks apart.  That is the
important thing to me.  Frankly, I wouldn't care if they came 3 MONTHS late,
as long as they came regularly, one month apart.

3) As I said earlier, I find the thought of someone driving just to pick up
comics, and ESPECIALLY sitting in their car with the engine running to read
them, abhorrent.  Maybe selfish is a better word.  Think about this for a
second - you are hurtling several tons of metal (your car) miles, adding
smog to the air, increasing demand for oil, (thus the price goes up).  Hmm,
what else?  Oh, probably contributing to global warming.  And all so that
you don't have to wait up to 21 days.

4) They don't always come 3 weeks later.  I recently got the latest issue of
Incredible Hulk a day BEFORE it was supposed to go on sale in the comic
shops.  Haven't figured that one out yet, but it happens.  Sometimes the
delay is only a week, and usually it isn't more than 2.

5) Finally, I get my comics new for 95c each.  Why would I want to go out of
my way to drive somewhere and pay 3 times that?  Or, I guess you could look
at it the other way around - I have a certain amount of $ to spend each
month on subscriptions.  Currently, I subscribe to about 3 dozen titles.  If
I drove to the comic shop, I would only be able to afford 12 comics monthly,
instead of 36.  Why would I want to give up 24 titles just so I could get 12
on the days they come out?  It seems like a lot to give up, just to hurt the
environment.

In the pre-mail-order days, I used to begin flipping through whichever
TwoMorrows magazine or book I'd bought (and there was almost always at
least one of their titles in my purchase each week) on the bus on my way
home. (On the rare occasions I -didn't- get anything from TM, you'd catch
me glancing at the USA TODAY SPORTS WEEKLY, a tabloid that also breaks on
Wednesdays which I'd purchase while waiting for the bus, on the way home.)

Otherwise, I haven't changed anything about my reading habits since going
to DCBS: actual comics are read at my desk, while books and magazines about
comics and the industry are read either in bed or on the john.

I don't get why you would want to lock yourself into preordering a full
year's worth of a title. What happens if it starts to blow after a few
issues?

I've found that mail-order (I suppose &quot;internet-order&quot; is far more
accurate a term, but it just sounds wrong) combined the best of both home
delivery and wide selection. Whether it's with DCBS or Westfield or MOC,
you get to choose literally from =anything= in the PREVIEWS catalog while
getting a substantial discount (DCBS gives me anywhere from 40-75% off
new comics, 40-50% off new trades, 35% off backlist trades, and anywhere
from 10-50% off all other merchandise; other outfits have different rates
but all offer huge breaks) while getting books at your door on either the
Friday after release or the following Monday. (Occasionally Tuesday, if
shipped during a holiday weekend.)

Delays of only a few days, deep discounts, ordering depth =and= ordering
flexibility... what's not to like?

Well, now I understand why you'd be willing to lock yourself into titles
for a year at a time. Still, where are you subscribing at that rate?
Marvel's official rate is $2/issue for the first sub and $1.83/issue for
each additional book, while DC's runs from $1.67 (Johnny DC books) to
$2.25 (COUNTDOWN).

I'd love to tell you guys where I get them, but if I did, my source would
disappear.  So, as much as I want to share my good fortune, I want to be
able to keep getting cheap comics even more. :-)   I'll give you a hint,
though: there are more middlemen involved with comics than just comic book
store owners.  Nuff said.

I've actually gotten several of my subscriptions for even less than the
95c an issue.  You mentioned Johnny DC titles - I can get subs to them for
58c an issue.  I once built up a 5 year subscription to one of those, then
transferred it over to Batman.

It depends if you can ignore spoilers like the ones coming in this NG.
Both tagged and untagged.

I'm also behind the rest of the NG, but that's due to geography and not
slower delivery.

However, I see your point.  Originally, subscribers got their issues at

It wasn't &quot;some sort of incentive to pay full retail price&quot; but, rather,
an incentive for people to head for the (non-returnable) direct-market
stores in the early 1980s that led to the industry providing books to
that nascent direct market three full weeks earlier than they released
them to other channels (newsstands, bookstores).

Remember the old MARVEL AGE and DIRECT CURRENTS new-release lists that
had two dates for each book? One that was a &quot;Shipping Date&quot; that
correlated within a couple of days to when you could go to a specialty
shop for your books, followed by an &quot;Available Date&quot; about three weeks
later that correlated to when you could go into 7-11 or WaldenBooks and
get the version with the UPC on the cover?

Presumably, sub copies were mailed at bulk library rate (aka &quot;bound
printed matter&quot;) around the shipping date, but given their low-priority
status with the USPS, it might take three weeks for sub copies to
actually reach subscribers.

(And they =looked= like they'd been in the hands of the Postal Service
that long when they finally did show up. I remember copies of Simonson's
THOR arriving looking as if they'd been used to line the cages of Michael
Vick's kennels...)

I get mine a week after most people here (from a comic shop) and the
lag makes this group problematic to read for reasons of spoilers
sometimes, and even when you can avoid those, a week can be long
enough sometimes (especially with Countdown) for people here to have
&quot;talked out&quot; a topic just when I want to start discussing it.

So, I care.
