MM:
Mercury is six degrees from Uranus.  That is causing communications to
be volatile, IMO.  This volatility figures to increase until April 1,
2007, when the conjunction becomes exact.  After that, the volatility
should decrease in an attempt to come back to normal levels.

Saturn has been in opposition to Neptune for months and it will make a
third opposition in June.  This has caused some "limitation,", which
might be why some posters have dropped out of the group.  They have
withdrawn into their respective shells, I suppose.

Mars recently made a conjunction with Neptune.  I think it is still
only three degrees from Neptune.  This tends to increase anxiety, I
think, as we might be inclined to have more ambition, but confused
regarding how to exactly achieve our goals.

Neptune represent mystic teachings, but Saturn and Mars have been
aspected to Neptune.  They are considered to be the two "malefic,"
planets.  This aspect might have contributed to some frustrations for
some members.

MM:
I don't claim to be a professional astrologer, but I checked the
ephemeris for the rest of the month.  Most of the aspects are
negative, or stressful, for the entire month of April.  The Neptune/
Saturn opposition remains in effect the entire month.  On April 30, in
the evening hours in America, but in the early morning hours for
England (May 1), Venus will trine Neptune.  So, hopefully May will be
a better month, astrologically speaking.  Venus would help to mitigate
the effects of Saturn.  Venus would probably be in a sextile to
Saturn.

If the birthdate of Shakespeare is correct, that he had a Venus/
Neptune conjunction, then the Venus/Neptune trine at the beginning of
May, should help HLAS to harmonize with the Stratford Sat Guru.  I
hope so.

Have you communicated with the Hexagon on Saturn yet?
It has killed the infatuation for wealth and women, it is independent
of all times and places, it possess an unshakable mind and is always
blissful, it will help you experience the homogenous essence of the
Self. It's sword of mercy will bestow absolute bliss upon you.

Sure it was. Surely you remember the thread "this group"?

David Kathman pointed out in that thread that Marty Hyatt wanted a
civil place to discuss the authorship question. Unfortunately, there
was a fundamental flaw in that plan. That was kinda like wanting a
civil place where folks could reach the consensus that black is white.

HLAS is *designed* as a gigantic flame war. Pretty stupid really.

&gt; &gt; MM:
&gt; &gt; I don't claim to be a professional astrologer, but I checked the
&gt; &gt; ephemeris for the rest of the month.  Most of the aspects are
&gt; &gt; negative, or stressful, for the entire month of April.

&gt; Have you communicated with the Hexagon on Saturn yet?
&gt; It has killed the infatuation for wealth and women, it is independent
&gt; of all times and places, it possess an unshakable mind and is always
&gt; blissful, it will help you experience the homogenous essence of the
&gt; Self. It's sword of mercy will bestow absolute bliss upon you.

&gt; &gt;The Neptune/
&gt; &gt; Saturn opposition remains in effect the entire month.  On April 30, in
&gt; &gt; the evening hours in America, but in the early morning hours for
&gt; &gt; England (May 1), Venus will trine Neptune.  So, hopefully May will be
&gt; &gt; a better month, astrologically speaking.  Venus would help to mitigate
&gt; &gt; the effects of Saturn.  Venus would probably be in a sextile to
&gt; &gt; Saturn.

&gt; Evidence?

&gt; &gt; If the birthdate of Shakespeare is correct, that he had a Venus/
&gt; &gt; Neptune conjunction, then the Venus/Neptune trine at the beginning of
&gt; &gt; May, should help HLAS to harmonize with the Stratford Sat Guru.  I
&gt; &gt; hope so.

&gt; Sap Guru, SAP GURU, I've told you a million times, meathead!

There's no apostrophe in the possessive "its". That aside, good work.

&gt; YES!!!

&gt; Six years as a Marlovian and you hardly ever say anything about

No, no, no, Art! The question was concerned not so much with Marlowe's
*being* Shakespeare as his--supposedly--having written the canon.

Do keep up!

Note that Vickers posted the above from SHAKSPER, a forum
that doesn't permit discussion of the Shakespeare authorship
question.

Vicker's post, plus the fact that other name academics formerly
participated in HLAS, shows that even scholars at the top of their
specialities want to debate the question of Shakespeare authorship.
They have no place other than HLAS to discuss it,

The only solution for saving this, the only Shakespeare authorship
forum
(the misnamed Shakespeare Fellowship is really a single issue forum)
is
to recruit a moderator or install a bot that would cull out abusive
spamming,
that would cache posts that contain off-topic headers and would limit
the
number of initial headers per poster to maybe five a day.  Header
abuse
is keeping potential posters from joining HLAS.

No individual poster would be banned, it would just put limits on the
damage
that certain posters would otherwise do to HLAS.

It's not just header abuse. It's the starting of troll threads (as you
have done) and, above all, the fact that HLAS is *designed* as a
gigantic flame war. Trolling is *positively encouraged* by a
significant number of prominent (and allegedly intelligent, although
to *this* reader they seem pretty fucking dumb) posters.

That's the problem. All you're doing by posting like this, Lizzie
dear, is making the problem WORSE. One suspects that perhaps you'd
prefer not to do that.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Why not? Some posters (Nilges, Carroll, Martin, Crowley, Innes et al)
are just unmitigated shit. Why should they *not* be banned?

You mean, like you're doing by posting the message to which this is a
reply?

Are you a fan of the short stories of Thomas Pynchon, by any chance?

Lizzie, Please list name academics who wish to disucss the so-called
authorship question?
What about Stephen Greenblatt, James Shaprio, Marjorie Garber, Frank
Kermode, David Scott Kastan, Jean Howard, Gail Kern Paster, David
Bevington, Harold Bloom, Stanley Wells, Jonathan Bate?

As for Brian Vickers, he'd wipe the floor with you over your wacko
claims about Bacon.

Between Carroll's idiotic reply to my post (a post for which he
changed the subject heading) and Robert's post to which this is a
reply, do you begin to see my point, Lizzie dear?

You brought this upon yourself... You'd better reply to Robert, and
it'd better be a doozy, or you'll look like a dumb floozy...yet
again...

Set to it...
