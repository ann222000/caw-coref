I have 4 Brooks Pro saddles, the best one being over 35 years old with
25k to 35k miles on it. It's still the most comfortable saddle I've ever
ridden.

A while back I looked for a replacement for an 15 year old Avocet Gel
saddle for an old mountain bike. After doing some web searching I bought
a WTB Pure V Race saddle.

It's kind of gaudy with the silver metallic trim and all but the wide
"whale tail" back portion gives the same support as a Brooks Pro or
probably a B17. It has a "love channel" groove molded down the middle
and the nose is softly padded and dropped down to avoid pressure in
personal areas.

Since then I bought 2 more WTBs, one for another MTB and one for my
newest retro road bike which I put to the test yesterday on a 47 mile
ride. It was very comfortable but not quite as good as a Brooks.

It's almost too wide in the rear because when I'm "up on the rivets" my
inner thighs contact the sides of the saddle. Aside from that, I'd
recommend it to Brooks riders as a wet weather alternative.

Saddles are VERY personal things, YMMV.

If you'd switch to recumbent bikes, you'd find that "most seats are more
than comfortable enough", even without padded shorts. Also the
crank-forward bikes (the "sport series") from RANS are nice too. I've
got a Fusion, it's quite lovely.

Just like with cars, motorcycles, boats, airplanes.... why is it that
upright bicycles are the only vehicles that have this "ass pain
problem"? ...It's because upright bicycle ergonomics are simply poor,
and no saddle can fix that.

The safety bicycle is no more the zenith of bicycle design than the Ford
Model-T is the zenith of car design. The upright bicycle frame is simply
the cheapest solution come up with, requiring the least amount of
materials to usefully connect two wheels.

Here is a fun question--it seems that so many people have problems with
saddle pain on uprights. But many of these people will not ride a
recumbent because "it is heavier, it doesn't climb as well".... So
then,,,, why not just get rid of the saddle and seat post on upright
bikes? You'd eliminate a major source of pain, and have a
lighter/better-climbing bike overall.

More of an idiot's question, I'd say.  Why make such a divisive issue
out of it?  I've tried recumbents, didn't like 'em.  I have no pain
issues with my bikes, so why switch?  For me, recumbents are not
inherently superior.  They create more problems that they solve IMHO-
for one thing, I couldn't get one down the stairs into my basement
storage area.  And there's the freakishly long chain with all the
various kludges to try to deal with that.

If recumbents work better for you, then ride 'em!  I have no trouble
with that.  I know a number of enthusiastic recumbent riders and
builders, who love riding their bikes.  I think that's great, and if a
recumbent gets someone out riding a bike who wouldn't ride otherwise, I
think that's even better.  But I don't understand this militant attitude
from recumbentists who seem miffed that the whole world has not adopted
their fancy.  Fortunately folks like you are in the minority of
recumbent riders.

How about a "date with the Turk" seat? It's a seat post with only a
fully rounded top..... A leftover from Vlad the Impaler.

It's good that you are happy with your recumbent bike. Once I get a seat
properly adjusted I have very few seat comfort issues.

Cars on the other hand give me seating problems. I have a Volvo noted
for their much touted anatomically designed seating and a Ford Taurus. I
have seating problems with both of them and most other modern cars that
I've driven or ridden in. I've spent over a thousand dollars during the
20 years on orthopedic car seat devices.

This has nothing to do with seat comfort per say, but is related to
overuse of poorly trained muscles.

It is possible to do very occasional long distance rides on properly
designed recumbents in comfort, while the same does not appear to be
true of uprights (based on the complaint of upright club riders on the
first rides of spring while the re-acclimate to upright saddles).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, I noticed that recumbent riders generally finished behind the standard bike riders

Which proves nothing, since the relative fitness of the riders is
unknown. Put a bunch of fat old geezers (FOGs) on state of the art
performance recumbents and a group of UCI professionals on English
3-speed roadsters, and see which group is faster.

Ever consider that the population of regular upright riders may well
consist of persons who have a greater than normal tolerance for sitting
on an upright saddle? If there are people who find uprights
uncomfortable despite "proper fit", would you rather they not take up
cycling? Then there are the "newbie's" who may well give up on
cycling when they try it and find it initially uncomfortable - is that
a good thing?

I find that when i'm at the gym, i ride two types of bicycles : an
upright training bicycle, and the same bicycle (same maker) in
recumbant position.

For me, maximum watts are generated when leaning over the bars of a
standard upright bicycle.  If I sit more upright, my heart rate
immediately races and i end up having to bend over forward again to
achieve maximum watts.

So is the advantage of a recumbant 100% in wind resistance?  According
to my experiments, I am a weaker cyclist when riding in the recumbant
position, at least from my perspective.

Is this sustainable power output or anaerobic power output?

What little evidence that exists indicates that maximum anaerobic power
is significantly greater in the upright position than the recumbent
position, while the picture for sustainable power is less clear.

At this point, I believe there still needs to be more research done to
answer these questions.

One point that needs to be made is that recumbent performance should
NOT be generalized, since the variations in recumbent performance
between different designs are greater than those for upright bicycles.
The differences are not only in weight, rolling resistance and
aerodynamic drag, but the effect of riding position on performance.

Thoughts on recumbent bikes:

Of the 10 or so recumbent riders I've talked to about their bikes over
the years, most of them rode these because of some physical problem, the
others were interestingly eccentric. Both reasons are valid
justifications.

I rode a recumbent bike for a few minutes about 30+ years ago. I found
it difficult to balance.

My personal concerns are about being able to easily balance the bike and
getting my feet down quickly in an emergency situation. I had a hip
replacement and I was told to avoid impact to my new joint which meant
giving up running, skiing or anything else that could overload the hip.

I work out several morning a week on a tread climber, elliptical and a
recumbent stationary bike. I use the recumbent during my cool down phase
where I work on increasing my cadence because it has foot straps and the
uprights don't. I've experienced some low back discomfort on the
recumbent stationary.

I think that many people who have comfort problems with the seats on
upright bikes are not familiar with the different adjustments that they
can make to their saddles. Also everyone's anatomy is different and no
one saddle will be comfortable for everyone. It's difficult to find the
most comfortable saddle.

I tried more than a dozen different seats before I rode a Brooks Pro and
decided that it was the seat for me. That was over 30 years ago. The
light padding on the early Avocet gel seats was great for off road but
not for long distance riding.

I use an angle gage and a meter stick to adjust my saddles so that they
start off at the same position on all 5 of my road bikes. Over a period
of weeks I may need to make a minor adjustment of 1/2° in the nose angle
or 1/8" in the height, more for pressure on my hands than my butt.

If you enjoy riding a recumbent that's great. It's all about riding.

This would have made the recumbent bicycle a pre-WW2 antique or a
homebuilt - not exactly relevant to the better designs currently
available.

Recumbent balance at lower speeds is different from an upright, since
the steering forces are lighter and less upper body moment is used, but
it is no more difficult with sufficient practice.

I find starting out on a recumbent easier than an upright, since the
recumbent starts out much nearer to vertical and there is no need to
shift one's body backward, reducing the main actions required from 4 to
2. (The other 2 are steering for balance and bringing the down foot to
the pedal).

I meet plenty of upright riders that show unsolicited hostility simply
because I am riding a recumbent bicycle. (And no, I have not tried to

You don't seem to recognize the extreme minority of recumbent two

minuscule.  It's not like you can't buy a recumbent in this are, it's

This is kind of true for me.

I have physical limitations that prevent me from riding in a max. aero
position (for me) on my DF bike for extended periods.  On my recumbent,
I'm in a max. aero position (for me) constantly, so I end up riding
faster with less effort over the same routes than I can on my DF bike.
If I did nothing but ride up steep hills, this wouldn't matter, but then
I don't just ride up steep hills.

At the power output end of things, I can sprint faster and reach a
higher maximum speed on my DF, but with the lower power requirement of
the constant aero position, I can sustain higher speeds over longer
distances/times on the recumbent.

ob.on-topic:  I haven't tried a Brooks Pro but would probably get it or
a B17 Narrow if I hadn't found a nice fit on a San Marco Rolls, as well
as the Vetta Race Lite (about as wide as the Rolls in back, narrower up
front, more rounded and firmer at the back than the flatter Rolls).

No.  As I and others have said already, we do not experience pain from
riding our bikes.  Thus we have no need to resort to the kludges that
are recumbents, most of which look like they were designed by Rube
Goldberg.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Third, almost every rider finds a saddle that suits them very well.

&gt; -Yes--it is true that &quot;all the people who ride a lot, are tolerant of
&gt; saddle pain&quot;. They would need to be. What about all the bicycles that
&gt; sit in people's garages unused, their tires going flat from dry-rot?
&gt; Do you think people aren't riding those bicycles because they're &quot;too
&gt; comfortable&quot;?
">

In most cases, the bikes are going unused because they were bought with
good intentions but other life commitments and- in many cases- laziness
keep them off their bikes.  I know of a number of recumbents also
sitting in garages being unused for those same reasons.

Your claim that "all the people who ride a lot are tolerant of saddle
pain" is just bullshit.  I ride a lot (6,000 to 7,000 miles most years)
and have no issues with saddle pain (with one exception noted below).  I
use either Brooks Team Pros or Lepper Voyageur saddles and find them
very comfortable.

The exception is on long brevets (400, 600, 1000 and 1200 km).  I get
some saddle soreness then.  However, listening to the gripes of
recumbent riders during those events, I know that I am not alone.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; You see many questions about saddles, and hear many reports of
&gt; &gt; people uncomfortable on their bicycle in this technical newsgroup.
&gt; &gt; Seriously, is this a good premise for inferring universal pain on
&gt; &gt; upright bicycles?

&gt; Yes it is.
">

No, it's not.  Perhaps you can't figure out why on your own and that's
why you've come to the erroneous conclusion that all standard bicycles
are painful to ride.  If you need an explanation of why you're wrong,
let us know.  But you ought to be able to figure it out for yourself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; People new to the sport typically associate with people who have
&gt; &gt; adapted, learn their methods, get stronger, get comfortable.

&gt; Yes but what you dscripe as &quot;partly standing&quot; is not &quot;getting
&gt; comfortable&quot;,,,, it is only becoming tolerant of a poor design.

&gt; The mainstream &quot;sport&quot; of bicycle racing decided to ignore alternate
&gt; possibilities a very-long time ago, and continues to ignore them to
&gt; this day. [end]
">

What does bicycle racing have to do with it?  Bicycle racing is about
0.0002% of the cycling population.  Recumbent zealots love to play the
bike racing card, even though it has basically nothing to do with
anything.

It's more telling that recumbents have not taken over in the general
public.  The main reason is simple- recumbents are a necessary solution
for only a small fraction of people who can't tolerate a normal bike.
The other reason is also simple- you can't buy a $300 recumbent.

One thing I notice about recumbent riders locally is that they are
overwhelmingly obese middle aged males.  I see very few women on
recumbents and virtually no young, fit people.  Locally we have some
very strong recumbent evangelists such as Calhoun Cycles (a shop of
almost all recumbents) and Terry Osell who has built custom recumbents
for decades.  Recumbents are pretty visible here- I see someone riding
one most days in the summer.  I see none in the winter on the ice and
snow, whereas I see hundreds of cyclists all winter long.

Oh and BTW- recumbents per se are not illegal in races sanctioned by the
U.S. cycling body, USA Cycling.  Check the rule book.  They are illegal
in races sanctioned by the international cycling body, the UCI, and in
races that conform to UCI rules.  I've never seen a recumbent in a race
locally, mainly because the disadvantage when climbing would render them
noncompetitive.

The other interesting thing here is your divisive attitude.  I wonder
what end that serves?  Are you making yourself feel superior and
justified in your fringe element lifestyle choice to ride a recumbent?
You are certainly not approaching the matter in a way that is going to
produce converts.

I think it's great that people ride recumbents.  If it gets them out on
their bikes and they wouldn't ride otherwise, more power to them.  I
know two dedicated cyclists that have switched to recumbents due to
cervical arthritis, it's kept them on the road.  I think that's great
too.  It's good to have options.  If a recumbent is a superior choice
for you, then ride and and tailwinds to ya.

Well put.

The bottom line is: for those folks who like or need the support of the
wide flat rear of Brooks Pros and B17s, WTB has a number of models with
their "whale tail" design.

Are they ever going to break in or last as long as a good leather
saddle? No, but they are about 1/2 the price of a Brooks Pro and some
folk's budgets are hard pressed to chunk out $100+ USD for a bike seat.

As I said above, I have 4 Brooks Pros and I'll keep riding them.

It's about time, but then that might be called un-American.  There is
good reason to specify the type of two wheeled vehicle used in
competition, no different than defining the size of golf, tennis and
baseball balls as well as many other dimensions of a sport.  You can
ride anything you want elsewhere as many people do, although enough
folks want to ride what the "racers" use.

What would be gained in leaving the choice of two wheeled vehicle up
to competitors?  Maybe in a multi-stage event, equipping oneself cold
be made more expensive, leaving the less affluent at a disadvantage.
Do you have any preference for whether streamlines recumbents should
be allowed in time trials?

In the Chicagoland area (population ca. 10 million), this is certainly

There is no right or wrong answer to whether the race should be a
competition of cyclists, or a competition of cyclists AND cycles.
However, the UCI rules stifle technical innovation. In my opinion, it
is unfortunate that there is not a high level cycle racing series where
freedom of design is allowed, as long as all power is supplied by the
rider.

At a professional level, I imagine the cost of the bicycles is only a
tiny fraction compared to what is spent on salaries, air travel, meals,
hotels, support automobiles, etc. At the amateur level, it would be an
impediment to many of the riders in their late teens to mid 20's, who
are often earning little more than minimum wage in a LBS, if different
bicycles were needed for different stages.

I think there is no doubt that faired recumbents are faster in flat

maximum speeds as well as duration.  That mountain climbing and
twisting descents are better done on conventional road racing bicycle
and that rough trail descents are best done with fat tired suspension
bicycles.  I think the regulations are tuned to that.

That would be fine, but the team would ride them in all events (road
for instance) in TT's, hill climbs, criteriums, and road stages.  I
don't think you will find a team that would put their riders on small
wheels, especially on rough roads and mountain stages.

I believe we could arrive on a "standard" bicycle design much faster
than to try to outguess designers of marginally useful designs that
give benefit in certain races.

The performance recumbents that are available from the major
(relatively speaking [1]) manufactures are significantly lighter,
stiffer [2] and more aerodynamic that those of 10 or even 5 years ago.
There is still significant room for improvement, unlike DF uprights
where the only real changes over the last half-century are due to
improvements in material technology. High level racing would bring the
budget for things like proper FEA and comparative testing of rider
positioning, which would further optimize the designs. Is this a bad
thing?

What is wrong for having a design that is optimized for pavement? If
one lives in a "developed" nation, almost every destination can be
reached with most of the journey on paved roads. (Not that the bikes
upright racers ride work well off pavement - I have observed a lot of
punctures simply from riding on crushed limestone surfaces).

Hmmm... I guess we know different sets of riders. I know of several
that did fully-loaded tours across the U.S., then were competitive in
local time trials on the same bikes in the same configuration (sans
panniers and sleeping bags, though).

Interestingly, there's been a similar discussion on the HPV maillist. I
thought John Tetz's comments were interesting:
http://www.ihpva.org/pipermail/hpv/Week-of-Mon-20061023/038596.html
He talks about having to wait for riders *one-third* his age, and
riding all winter when the racers have put away their bikes. *That's*
"versatile".

It would bring designes optimized for highly trained athlets
competing in racing events.  Not much gain for every day usage as
it's popular here (Europe), where recumbent design seems to be
advancing driven mostly by targeting every day riders (at least the
competing community is largely ignored outside of its followers).

For racing the crows seems to prefer seeing the rider's efforts, the
competition, the physical aspects...not to be hidden or limited.
