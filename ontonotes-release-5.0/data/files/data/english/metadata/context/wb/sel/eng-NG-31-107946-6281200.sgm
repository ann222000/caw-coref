No one places the loads to exactly so as to balance the airplane. The
elevator  downward force is increased or decreased during flight to
balance the airplane for varying load conditions. For example, when a
passenger walks forward, the elevator downward force must be increased
to counteract that. The CG is calculated using the moments and arms to
make sure that it falls within the approved limits. If the CG falls too
far forward or too far backward, the elevator may not be able to
provide the force necessary to balance the airplane.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Ah, time to take a clue, isn't it?

Why would "neutral trim" be important? For that matter, what would it
be?

What you get is a range of allowable CGs, which often depends on total
weight. This all has to do mostly with elevator authority. Trim (as in
the trim wheel) is not really important, trim is just a tool to relieve
the pilot. Trim as in weight distribution, well, see above.

Once you've figured this out, ponder why an aircraft will be faster or
consume less fuel if the CG is as aft as possible.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Maximum relative to what? What do you think the CG limits set forth by the
manufacturer are made for? Why would they matter in certification? Why would
a manufacturer and a certification authority consider them sufficient? How
much control movement do you "lose" when fully trimming to one side?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I know. You're playing MSFS, a game.

But if you where truly interested in these questions, then you'd find the
answer very educational. But again you show that you're not. You're an
imposter, bending the limits of your interest to maximize insult to the
pilots here. That's how you derive an "ego increase" from your visits to
this group. Pathetic! But interesting.

Maybe.  The Baron and the 737 aren't suitable for aerobatics, though,
and I'm not a great fan of aerobatics myself (except perhaps to watch

In MSFS, if the gamer does not enter inputs for trim and/or W&amp;B the
aircraft data revert to defaults. No such thing exists for our real
aircraft. Likewise, DA defaults to runway altitude regardless of local
meteorology. These are some of the errors in the game.

MSFS was originally developed by a company called subLOGIC and is
supported today by Microsoft Game Studios which develops and publishes video
games for Windows-based PCs and the Xbox and Xbox 360 video game consoles.
To some naive people the word simulator elevates the game's status far
beyond its reality -- it is a game, nothing more.
In the US, the FAA does not recognize any time spent on the game as
valid time for anything.
I loaded MSFS onto my computer and spent several hours with it using
yoke, rudder pedals, and throttle controls. I did a serious comparison of it
to the Cessna 172SP that I was flying at the time and as a legitimate
simulation I rated it poorly.
On the other hand, as a game for which it was intended, it was mildly
enjoyable. I still have it on my computer although the only use it gets is
when my grandson comes for a visit. Since he has many hours in the right
seat of 172s with both his dad and me, including lots of stick time, I once
asked him what he thought about flying the 172 in MSFS. Using the cliche --
out of the mouth of babes -- came the quote: "It's bogus."

So, don't look for any defaults in your airplane's POH it is a term used
in games, not real life.

But it does control how far you are from each stop.

If you trim to pitch the aircraft upwards, for example, in order to
eliminate the pesky need to hold the yoke way back, you may only be a
short distance from the limit of your elevator travel.  If you then
become complacent and forget how much you've trimmed, and you suddenly
need more elevator travel, you're out of luck.  With a more neutral
trim, you have plenty of travel in both directions if you need it.

You can adjust your throttle so that you can remain level with zero
trim.  Or you can adjust your trim so that you remain level, pitching
upwards as necessary.  In the first case, you have plenty of safety
margin on both sides; in the second case, you have very little margin
to pitch up further, and if you suddenly need to climb and cannot, bad
things can happen.

This is why I prefer to stay near neutral trim.  If I'm not in a rush,
for example, I'll maintain altitude by adjusting the throttle until I
can trim to zero.  That way I have full elevator travel in both
directions if I need it.  And since this usually results in a lower
throttle setting and slower speed as long as I'm not close to my
ceiling, I have a good margin for thrust and speed as well.

I will make an exception sometimes and trim down for high speeds,
since that isn't as risky as the inverse.

Okay, now that I've made the mistake of reading this discussion, you've got
me curious: How does your plane's trim work? It's obviously not a trim tab.
And how can there be no neutral/default position of the elevator or the
trim device?

Ok, make up your mind. DId you ask the question about W&amp;B to learn or
to be obnoxious again? If the former, accept the fact that your idea of
"neutral trim" is bogus and stupid, STFU and take notes from the people
here that know. If the latter, well, take a hike.

No, there are simply some aircraft designs to which it does not apply.
There are a lot of ways to design control surfaces.

Trim tabs deflect control surfaces towards one of the limits of their
travel.  The greater the trim applied, the greater the deviation, and
the less the amount of travel remaining.

Please define "servo tab" and "anti-servo tab" and how they relate to

Heh  Heh good one.. I refuse to even respond to MXidiot but I am sure
that he prefers neutral trim for two reasons:

1. Because his game has no way of imposing or relieving control wheel
pressures...
2. Because he has already shown that he really doesn't know WTF the trim
does in real airplanes...

Y'All,
Not exactly on topic but something to try in a simulator and again  in an
air.  Trim for level at cruise,
Put your hands and arms a far forward as you can and hold them there.  The
nose of the aircraft will drop and the speed increase slightly in the
airplane but not in the simulator.  Then put your hands up and back as far
as you can reach.  The plane's nose will rise and airspeed will drop as you
lelnter a climb.  You can actually fly the aircraft just be moving your arms
and using the rudder.  This is NOT possible on the simulator.

During WWII (See my web site at www.whittsflying.com ) I was the mechanic
operator of a radar bombing
simulator on Tinian Island that provided simulated flights over Japan and
specifically Fukuoka.  We worked on the attack only to find on the Sept 9,
1945 mission day that the target was obscured by smoke.

Nagasaki.was a secondary target requiring an attack from a direction
opposite to the one practiced.  Thus this very first electronic simulator
paved the way for the failures of future electronic simulators to really
provide a true sense of what is supposed to happen.

Another Comparison:
I had a Designated Examiner that I had tutored through his CFI come to me in
need of a Flight Review.
I told him as, we got into the airplane, that we were going to make an IFR
flight from Concord to shoot the ILS  in Oakland.  We discussed the flight
and requirements except for one minor aspect which began on takeoff.

As he lined up on the runway, I informed him that I had electrified the
yoke.  Were he to touch the yoke he would go up in smoke.  Under the hood he
flew a perfect flight without touching the yoke including making
the Oakland published missed at which point I asked his permission to have a
go at it.  It can be done in an airplane.  Can anyone do it in a simulator?
Has it even been tried?

It's possible in most simulators, just as it is possible in real life.
It's even possible in MSFS.  However, success would depend on the
pilot.

I don't know. I'll have to try it sometime, when I'm looking for a

So in the same post you say something can be done in most simulator,
including MSFS, AND that you have never done it and don't know if anyone has
ever done it in a simulator.

Add to that I doubt you have any experience with MOST simulators.
