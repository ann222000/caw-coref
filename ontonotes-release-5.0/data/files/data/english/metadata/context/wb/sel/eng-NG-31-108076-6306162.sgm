I did it at the pub on Friday night.  My mate was talking to a girl and her
boyfriends friend decided to take offense at it.  He started hassling my 5 foot
5 130 pound friend and was starting to get a bit agro.  As soon as I stood up
and told him to fuck off he took a 180 turn and started apologizing.  I hate
people like that.

Damn....if I'd been the arresting officer, I would've just taken out
one of the dude's knees. No matter what the guy was hyped up on, he at
least would've been grounded. Very risky to cut off the perp's air.
What if he ended up dying? Bad press for the cop (even tho' he was
only doing his job), possibly legality issues and ramifications from
the guy's family.
And I find it truly disgusting that no one came to the officer's aid
until the very end.
Even more disgusting that the perp only got 2 yrs.    RTW

I would have without hesitation. If not, what am I training for?

My first intructor was a cop and taught the unarmed self-defense units
in the Cleveland police academy. He always said the first thing to do
with altered (mentally or chemically) people to have any chance at all
of subdueing them was to get them off their feet.

It looked like the cop was significantly smaller than the subject. He
fought hard and didn't go to the stick. I think the cop deserves props
for forebearance. It's almost impossible to hold a guy down *and* cuff
him without assistance without knocking his brains out when pain
compliance doesn't work. It could have easily turned into another
Rodney King.

No, this was back before &lt;g&gt;
He's got a little sumpin'sumpin' for them now.
In all humility, a sap would have solved the cop's problem instantly. A
soft-sap like I make wouldn't break bones, but the impact is significant. It
doesn't matter how crazy they are if they don't work right a little bit.
You don't even have to hit them in the head; hands, elbows, clavicle, feet,
knees, hipsocket- it is such a force multiplier, that you can hit 'hard'
targets with confidence.

There are a lot of social mechanisms at work which explain why people

people aren't sure which move is the correct move.  That's why, when
he was able to *tell* people to come and help him, they did - he

Mace for the eyes and stick for the knees.  The cop needed better training.
Apparently no-one told him that close-up, mace gets into everyone's eyes.

I think the main problem is liability and/or people just do not want to get

to beat a cop to death, went through three investigations, including federal
one; and is now being sued bythe miscreants live in girl friend. The cop had
already shot this guy once and was screaming for help. Fourteen  people were
standing around watching. Turns out the scumbag was a real "choir boy;" and
the chief of police even went over to console the family without visiting
his officer, who was now in the hospital. Months later the chief made a half
hearted public thank you to the gentlemen for intervening. Turns out some
people in the community knew the miscreant as a real hot headed scum bag.

Or the cop could've been killed. Or the guy have a seizure and the cop
made the scapegoat.  You never know about these things.  The cop really
was trying to use minimal force to overcome the guy, who's going for the
gun, which was incredible.

And if that happened, goodbye. Poor good natured cop.

Of course then what to do with a dying policeman. It's like the story of
one cop who was dying on the street, after being thrown into a passing
bus by the assailant.

He is lying near death on the sidewalk as a crowd gathers.  "A
priest. Somebody get me a priest!" the man gasps. Minutes drag on and no
one steps out of the crowd. Another policeman comes by and checks the
crowd and finally yells, "A PRIEST, PLEASE! Isn't there a priest in this
crowd to give this officer his last rites?"

Finally, out of the crowd steps a little old Jewish man of at least
80 years of age. "Mr. Policeman," says the man, "I'm not a priest. I'm
not even a Christian. But for 50 years now I'm living behind the
Catholic Church on First Avenue , and every night I'm overhearing their
services. I can recall a lot of it, and maybe I can be of some comfort
to this poor man."

The policeman agrees, and clears the crowd so the man can get
through to where the injured man lay. The old Jewish man kneels down,
leans over the
prostrate man and says in a solemn voice:

"B-4. I-19. N-38. G-54. O-72"

True.

That's the biggest problem.

No I still say the biggest problem is the liability issue. Even if you are
right the bastard sues you; and you have to spend a lot of money to defend
yourself. Then, if he is black, he screams and the Feds feel compelled to
investigate you to see if you violated the his civil rights. You need an
attorney for that too. By that time you are so pissed you do not want to
help anyone.

Honestly, while I agree with you that these are problems after the
fact, and big unnecessary ones too, I don't know how much of that
would be in your mind at the moment.  Still, that can't help but add
to the ambiguity so greatly decrease the odds of someone stepping in.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I would; I try to step in whenever I see someone being hassled,
&gt;&gt;&gt; bullied, harrassed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; It's too easy to argue yourself out of it, and yet I'd want someone to
&gt;&gt;&gt; do the same for me. Preferably someone my size with a bit of MA
&gt;&gt;&gt; training, too.

&gt;&gt; I did it at the pub on Friday night.  My mate was talking to a girl and her
&gt;&gt; boyfriends friend decided to take offense at it.  He started hassling my 5
&gt;&gt; foot 5 130 pound friend and was starting to get a bit agro.  As soon as I
&gt;&gt; stood up and told him to fuck off he took a 180 turn and started
&gt;&gt; apologizing.  I hate people like that.

&gt;&gt; Fraser

&gt; Well done, mate! This is your mate with the big bike? He'd be lucky to be
&gt; 130.

&gt; Asshole bullies....deserve everything they get.

No.  That's the law's view of community spirit.  You should know

Yeah, it's like the ubiquitous "man beating the shit out of a woman"
scenario. I've never met *anyone* who interceded on behalf of the
woman who didn't live to regret it and strongly urge anyone who would
listen to NOT get involved in a situation like that.

It is my view that this is how communities break down, when everyone only
looks out for themselves and immediate family.  In the end, everyone ends up
unsafe.  Would you go to the aid of a friend?  Would you go to the aid of a
neighbour?  Would you go to the aid of a child?
