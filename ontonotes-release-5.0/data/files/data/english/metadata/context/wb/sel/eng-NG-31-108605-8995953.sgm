Black The Red CAN be entertaining when he writes about the Lefties.

But he's lazy today and has no intent of telling folks here all about the
LEVELLERS and why they are relevant today.

So be it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Tony Benn's book on the Levellers is worth a read as it relates their

I would hate to deny Mr Benn his well deserved royalty payment from you.  It
is unlikely that the book is available from your local library.

Also they're his views rather than mine,  and I disagree with some aspects
of his analysis.

On the other hand he gets to speak at Burford Church every year,  I just get
to go and listen now and again...

Benn only then inherited because his older brother was killed in WWII.
He was already an MP but then had to stand down because he had become a

And it was Benn who largely led the change in the law that then allowed

Not quite,  he was ennobled in 1942 rather than 1945.

He was a slight embarrassment in that he was a Ramsey Mac cabinet minister
who hadn't died ...

On the other hand on the outbreak of war he returned to active service as a
pilot (at something over 60 years of age) and was eventually promoted to the
rank of Air Commodore and was head of public relations for the RAF later in
the war...

First it wasn't a _Baronetcy_ - the rank of Baronet, entitleing the holder
to the honorific 'Sir', did _not_ entitle the holder to sit in the House of
Lords  A Baronetcy may be entailed.

Anthony Wedgewood Benn was a genuine pukkah _Viscount_; quite a numbe of
rungs above a mere Baronet.

However 'Tony Benn' - his name gets shorter with every leftward lurch -did
renounce his Visocuntcy twenty two minutes after the Queen's Assent to the
Peerage Act 1963 was given in the Commons at 18:00 (approx) 31 July 1963.
Although he'd 'won' a majority of votes standing as a candidate in Bristol
South East in May 1961 he had been disqualified as a candidate and the seat
awarded to the runner-up. Conservative. Once Tone has renounced his peerage
the Conservative member resigned his seat immediately (took the Manorship of
Northstead).

I was working at  Weston Super mare during this period and needed to travel
through Bristol (South East) every wekend - ths was long before the M5
reached those parts- so it was a 'local event' to me.

I though he also held the baronetcy of Old Knoll,  but it seems he doesn't,
although he may inherit it at some point...

Utter rubbish! Go Google Willie Gallacher MP, just for starters.
Willie was a Red Clydesider in round 1919 and a Communist MP for Dunfermline
West right up into the 1950s.
A fine man a and still well thought of around Fife.
By the way a far more honest man than anyone who has held that seat ever
since and there have been a couple of rather well known ones.
The seat was renamed a couple of times and the Present PM held it for a time
under its guise as Dunfermline and West Fife.
He followed Willie Hamilton who took over from Willie Gallacher.

Are we talking about Evan Frederic Morgan, 2nd Viscount Tredegar
(1893-1949). Friend of Aleister Crowley, descendant of Captain Morgan,
the famous pirate?

I have been unable to find any hint indicating that he had the
slightest interest in Communism. He was regarded as an adept mystic
who took a great interst in black magic, which is why he and Crowley
were close friends. As he died childless, the title died with him.

Got another name?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Would you be kind enough to name names?

&gt;&gt; Lord Tredegar was one before he gave up his home and the family left this
&gt;&gt; country for ever.  His ancestors included Captain Henry Morgan and his
&gt;&gt; grandfather who had fought in Balaclava and took place at The Charge Of
&gt;&gt; The Light Brigade.

&gt;Captain Morgan is a very good rum!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Tell us the deep, dark secrets of British Politics on the left, dear.

&gt;&gt; Well, for a start, the only Communists ever in Parliament have been in the
&gt;&gt; House of Lords :-)

&gt;Well,  except for Phil Piratin,  Willie Gallacher,  Walton Newbald and the
&gt;immortal Shapurji Saklatvala who was also an Indian nationalist,  an ore
&gt;prospector,  a barrister, a business executive and in whose honour the
&gt;British fighting the Fascists in Spain sometimes referred to themselves as
&gt;'The Saklatvala Battalion'.

My grandmother knew Saklatvala well before the war as she, a committed
suffragette, had turned her attention to the problems of working women
living in the poorest areas of London, in particular the problem of
back-alley abortions and he contributed some cash to help her set up
an illegal surgery to give poor women safe abortions. (He died a year
or so before the war started). As his name suggests, he was a Parsi
(from Bombay) and it was because of that connection that I met and
almost married one of the Tata family's daughters; a match her family
and mine opposed.  I imagine you are well aware of the problems.

However, Saklatvala was an MP, but never a member of the Lords, so
have you another name, Mr. Baldoni? By the way, I'm not harrassing
you; I'm simply interested because my grandmother was extremely
political and often spoke of those times between the wars.

I suppose Tony Wedgewood Benn came close after giving up his title to
join the Labour party!
