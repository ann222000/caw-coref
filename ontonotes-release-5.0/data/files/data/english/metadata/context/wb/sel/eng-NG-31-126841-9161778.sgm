As Bush Prepares for 'Surge' Address Tonight: Here Is What He Promised in January Speech

By E&amp;P Staff

Published: September 13, 2007 11:20 AM ET

NEW YORK With President Bush reportedly ready to endorse a full continuation of the &quot;surge&quot; in Iraq through next summer in a speech to the nation tonight, a look back at what he promised in his address last January might prove illuminating, especially concerning &quot;benchmarks.&quot;

The president said then, &quot;I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people -- and it will lose the support of the Iraqi people. Now is the time to act. The Prime Minister understands this....

&quot;To establish its authority, the Iraqi government plans to take responsibility for security in all of Iraq's provinces by November. To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy, Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis. To show that it is committed to delivering a better life, the Iraqi government will spend $10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and infrastructure projects that will create new jobs. To empower local leaders, Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections later this year. And to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's political life, the government will reform de-Baathification laws, and establish a fair process for considering amendments to Iraq's constitution.&quot;

None of this happened.

A fact sheet released by the White House at the same time stated:

&quot;The Government of Iraq commits to:

--Reform its cabinet to provide even-handed service delivery.
--Act on promised reconciliation initiatives (oil law, de-Baathification law, Provincial elections).
--Give Coalition and ISF authority to pursue ALL extremists.
--All Iraqi leaders support reconciliation.
--Moderate coalition emerges as strong base of support for unity government.&quot;

Excerpts from the Bush speech on Jan. 10, 2007, follow.
*

It is clear that we need to change our strategy in Iraq. So my national security team, military commanders, and diplomats conducted a comprehensive review. We consulted members of Congress from both parties, our allies abroad, and distinguished outside experts. We benefitted from the thoughtful recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel led by former Secretary of State James Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton. In our discussions, we all agreed that there is no magic formula for success in Iraq. And one message came through loud and clear: Failure in Iraq would be a disaster for the United States….

The most urgent priority for success in Iraq is security, especially in Baghdad. Eighty percent of Iraq's sectarian violence occurs within 30 miles of the capital. This violence is splitting Baghdad into sectarian enclaves, and shaking the confidence of all Iraqis. Only Iraqis can end the sectarian violence and secure their people. And their government has put forward an aggressive plan to do it….

Now let me explain the main elements of this effort: The Iraqi government will appoint a military commander and two deputy commanders for their capital. The Iraqi government will deploy Iraqi Army and National Police brigades across Baghdad's nine districts. When these forces are fully deployed, there will be 18 Iraqi Army and National Police brigades committed to this effort, along with local police. These Iraqi forces will operate from local police stations -- conducting patrols and setting up checkpoints, and going door-to-door to gain the trust of Baghdad residents.

This is a strong commitment. But for it to succeed, our commanders say the Iraqis will need our help. So America will change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of Baghdad. This will require increasing American force levels. So I've committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq. The vast majority of them -- five brigades -- will be deployed to Baghdad. These troops will work alongside Iraqi units and be embedded in their formations. Our troops will have a well-defined mission: to help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods, to help them protect the local population, and to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the security that Baghdad needs.

Many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operations to secure Baghdad did not. Well, here are the differences: In earlier operations, Iraqi and American forces cleared many neighborhoods of terrorists and insurgents, but when our forces moved on to other targets, the killers returned. This time, we'll have the force levels we need to hold the areas that have been cleared. In earlier operations, political and sectarian interference prevented Iraqi and American forces from going into neighborhoods that are home to those fueling the sectarian violence. This time, Iraqi and American forces will have a green light to enter those neighborhoods -- and Prime Minister Maliki has pledged that political or sectarian interference will not be tolerated.

I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people -- and it will lose the support of the Iraqi people. Now is the time to act. The Prime Minister understands this. Here is what he told his people just last week: &quot;The Baghdad security plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaws, regardless of [their] sectarian or political affiliation.&quot;

A successful strategy for Iraq goes beyond military operations. Ordinary Iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible improvements in their neighborhoods and communities.
So America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.

To establish its authority, the Iraqi government plans to take responsibility for security in all of Iraq's provinces by November. To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy, Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis. To show that it is committed to delivering a better life, the Iraqi government will spend $10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and infrastructure projects that will create new jobs. To empower local leaders, Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections later this year. And to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's political life, the government will reform de-Baathification laws, and establish a fair process for considering amendments to Iraq's constitution.

America will change our approach to help the Iraqi government as it works to meet these benchmarks. In keeping with the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, we will increase the embedding of American advisers in Iraqi Army units, and partner a coalition brigade with every Iraqi Army division. We will help the Iraqis build a larger and better-equipped army, and we will accelerate the training of Iraqi forces, which remains the essential U.S. security mission in Iraq. We will give our commanders and civilians greater flexibility to spend funds for economic assistance. We will double the number of provincial reconstruction teams. These teams bring together military and civilian experts to help local Iraqi communities pursue reconciliation, strengthen the moderates, and speed the transition to Iraqi self-reliance. And Secretary Rice will soon appoint a reconstruction coordinator in Baghdad to ensure better results for economic assistance being spent in Iraq….

Our military forces in Anbar are killing and capturing al Qaeda leaders, and they are protecting the local population. Recently, local tribal leaders have begun to show their willingness to take on al Qaeda. And as a result, our commanders believe we have an opportunity to deal a serious blow to the terrorists. So I have given orders to increase American forces in Anbar Province by 4,000 troops. These troops will work with Iraqi and tribal forces to keep up the pressure on the terrorists. America's men and women in uniform took away al Qaeda's safe haven in Afghanistan -- and we will not allow them to re-establish it in Iraq….

We will use America's full diplomatic resources to rally support for Iraq from nations throughout the Middle East. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, and the Gulf States need to understand that an American defeat in Iraq would create a new sanctuary for extremists and a strategic threat to their survival….

This new approach comes after consultations with Congress about the different courses we could take in Iraq. Many are concerned that the Iraqis are becoming too dependent on the United States, and therefore, our policy should focus on protecting Iraq's borders and hunting down al Qaeda. Their solution is to scale back America's efforts in Baghdad -- or announce the phased withdrawal of our combat forces. We carefully considered these proposals. And we concluded that to step back now would force a collapse of the Iraqi government, tear the country apart, and result in mass killings on an unimaginable scale. Such a scenario would result in our troops being forced to stay in Iraq even longer, and confront an enemy that is even more lethal. If we increase our support at this crucial moment, and help the Iraqis break the current cycle of violence, we can hasten the day our troops begin coming home.

In the days ahead, my national security team will fully brief Congress on our new strategy. If members have improvements that can be made, we will make them. If circumstances change, we will adjust. Honorable people have different views, and they will voice their criticisms. It is fair to hold our views up to scrutiny. And all involved have a responsibility to explain

AND THE RESULTS ARE???

WE ARE WINNING !!!!!

WHAT COULD/SHOULD HAVE BEEN OSAMA BIN LADEN'S CHANCE FOR A SHINING
MOMENT OF GLORY DID NOT OCCUR THIS WEEK.

1.  Osama could have created a huge Terrorist attack(s) in Iraq,
killing hundreds/thousands of people prior to General Petraeus's visit
to Congress to show the world the fallacy of the United States being
in Iraq and the failure of the Iraq War.

Such an event could have marked &quot;the end of the Bush presidency in
total failure.&quot;

2.  Osama could have, on 9/11,  created a huge Terrorist attack(s) in
the United States, killing hundreds/thousands, as we remembered
9/11/2001, showing the world that being in Iraq does not make the
United States safer and that we are incapable of defending our country
against Terrorism.

Such an event could have marked &quot;the end of the Bush presidency in
total failure.&quot;

NEITHER EVENT OCCURRED.

WHY?

Is Osama bin Laden just a guy with a black beard, sitting in a cave,
reduced to emitting sound bites as he tries to defeat Bush as are
Democrats and the Liberal Press?

Could the United States be winning the War on Terror and  against Al
Qaeda, the group that sponsored 9/11?

I think both are real possibilities.

60 years from now historians will wonder what made people slam George
W. Bush so unmercifully for his successful tactics in protecting
them.

Why???

&gt; &gt; &gt; NEW YORK With President Bush reportedly ready to endorse a full continuation of the &quot;surge&quot; in Iraq through next summer in a speech to the nation tonight, a look back at what he promised in his address last January might prove illuminating, especially concerning &quot;benchmarks.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; The president said then, &quot;I've made it clear to the Prime Minister and Iraq's other leaders that America's commitment is not open-ended. If the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people -- and it will lose the support of the Iraqi people. Now is the time to act. The Prime Minister understands this....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;To establish its authority, the Iraqi government plans to take responsibility for security in all of Iraq's provinces by November. To give every Iraqi citizen a stake in the country's economy, Iraq will pass legislation to share oil revenues among all Iraqis. To show that it is committed to delivering a better life, the Iraqi government will spend $10 billion of its own money on reconstruction and infrastructure projects that will create new jobs. To empower local leaders, Iraqis plan to hold provincial elections later this year. And to allow more Iraqis to re-enter their nation's political life, the government will reform de-Baathification laws, and establish a fair process for considering amendments to Iraq's constitution.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; None of this happened.

&gt; &gt; &gt; A fact sheet released by the White House at the same time stated:

&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;The Government of Iraq commits to:

&gt; &gt; &gt; --Reform its cabinet to provide even-handed service delivery.
&gt; &gt; &gt; --Act on promised reconciliation initiatives (oil law, de-Baathification law, Provincial elections).
&gt; &gt; &gt; --Give Coalition and ISF authority to pursue ALL extremists.
&gt; &gt; &gt; --All Iraqi leaders support reconciliation.
&gt; &gt; &gt; --Moderate coalition emerges as strong base of support for unity government.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; Excerpts from the Bush speech on Jan. 10, 2007, follow.

&gt; &gt; &gt; It is clear that we need to change our strategy in Iraq. So my national security team, military commanders, and diplomats conducted a comprehensive review. We consulted members of Congress from both parties, our allies abroad, and distinguished outside experts. We benefitted from the thoughtful recommendations of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan panel led by former Secretary of State James Baker and former Congressman Lee Hamilton. In our discussions, we all agreed that there is no magic formula for success in Iraq. And one message came through loud and clear: Failure in Iraq would be a disaster for the United States....

This violence is splitting Baghdad into sectarian enclaves, and shaking the confidence of all Iraqis. Only Iraqis can end the sectarian violence and secure their people. And their government has put forward an aggressive plan to do it....

&gt; &gt; &gt; Now let me explain the main elements of this effort: The Iraqi government will appoint a military commander and two deputy commanders for their capital. The Iraqi government will deploy Iraqi Army and National Police brigades across Baghdad's nine districts. When these forces are fully deployed, there will be 18 Iraqi Army and National Police brigades committed to this effort, along with local police. These Iraqi forces will operate from local police stations -- conducting patrols and setting up checkpoints, and going door-to-door to gain the trust of Baghdad residents.

&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a strong commitment. But for it to succeed, our commanders say the Iraqis will need our help. So America will change our strategy to help the Iraqis carry out their campaign to put down sectarian violence and bring security to the people of Baghdad. This will require increasing American force levels. So I've committed more than 20,000 additional American troops to Iraq. The vast majority of them -- five brigades -- will be deployed to Baghdad. These troops will work alongside Iraqi units and be embedded in their formations. Our troops will have a well-defined mission: to help Iraqis clear and secure neighborhoods, to help them protect the local population, and to help ensure that the Iraqi forces left behind are capable of providing the security that Baghdad needs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Many listening tonight will ask why this effort will succeed when previous operations to secure Baghdad did not. Well, here are the differences: In earlier operations, Iraqi and American forces cleared many neighborhoods of terrorists and insurgents, but when our forces moved on to other targets, the killers returned. This time, we'll have the force levels we need to hold the areas that have been cleared. In earlier operations, political and sectarian interference prevented Iraqi and American forces from going into neighborhoods that are home to those fueling the sectarian violence. This time, Iraqi and American forces will have a green light to enter those neighborhoods -- and Prime Minister Maliki has pledged that political or sectarian interference will not be tolerated.

The Prime Minister understands this. Here is what he told his people just last week: &quot;The Baghdad security plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaws, regardless of [their] sectarian or political affiliation.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; A successful strategy for Iraq goes beyond military operations. Ordinary Iraqi citizens must see that military operations are accompanied by visible improvements in their neighborhoods and communities.
&gt; &gt; &gt; So America will hold the Iraqi government to the benchmarks it has announced.

&gt; &gt; &gt; To establish its authority, the Iraqi government plans to take responsibility for security in all of Iraq's provinces by November.

We will help the Iraqis build a larger and better-equipped army, and we will accelerate the training of Iraqi forces, which remains the essential U.S. security mission in Iraq. We will give our commanders and civilians greater flexibility to spend funds for economic assistance. We will double the number of provincial reconstruction teams. These teams bring together military and civilian experts to help local Iraqi communities pursue reconciliation, strengthen the moderates, and speed the transition to Iraqi self-reliance. And Secretary Rice will soon appoint a reconstruction coordinator in Baghdad to ensure better results for economic assistance being spent in Iraq....

&gt; &gt; &gt; WHAT COULD/SHOULD HAVE BEEN OSAMA BIN LADEN'S CHANCE FOR A SHINING
&gt; &gt; &gt; MOMENT OF GLORY DID NOT OCCUR THIS WEEK.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. ?Osama could have created a huge Terrorist attack(s) in Iraq,
&gt; &gt; &gt; killing hundreds/thousands of people prior to General Petraeus's visit
&gt; &gt; &gt; to Congress to show the world the fallacy of the United States being
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Iraq and the failure of the Iraq War.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Such an event could have marked &quot;the end of the Bush presidency in
&gt; &gt; &gt; total failure.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. ?Osama could have, on 9/11, ?created a huge Terrorist attack(s) in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the United States, killing hundreds/thousands, as we remembered
&gt; &gt; &gt; 9/11/2001, showing the world that being in Iraq does not make the
&gt; &gt; &gt; United States safer and that we are incapable of defending our country
&gt; &gt; &gt; against Terrorism.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Such an event could have marked &quot;the end of the Bush presidency in
&gt; &gt; &gt; total failure.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; NEITHER EVENT OCCURRED.

&gt; &gt; &gt; WHY?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Is Osama bin Laden just a guy with a black beard, sitting in a cave,
&gt; &gt; &gt; reduced to emitting sound bites as he tries to defeat Bush as are
&gt; &gt; &gt; Democrats and the Liberal Press?

&gt; &gt; &gt; Could the United States be winning the War on Terror and ?against Al
&gt; &gt; &gt; Qaeda, the group that sponsored 9/11?

&gt; &gt; &gt; I think both are real possibilities.

&gt; &gt; &gt; 60 years from now historians will wonder what made people slam George
