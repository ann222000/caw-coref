first
"12 ounces;" meaning "16 ounces" was established before 1377.

Have you heard Monteverdi's motet, Salve Regina? It's out of this world! His
Duo Seraphim is brilliant as well!

In the back of the libretto booklet to my CDs of his 1620 Vespers, I've
written, "And now they sing 'All Thing Bright and Beautiful', and nobody
comes."

Mentre Vaggia Agnioletta is a brilliant secular madrigal as well, extolling
the virtues and technique of an excellent singer of the day.

If you want really inspiring, soul-grabbing ancient liturgical music,
Monteverdi is the composer to go for.

The church is now bell-free. It's WW2 and they've taken them for salvage!

In Dad's Army, when the salvage men came, the vicar decided to give the
bells one last ring before they took them away and the people in the
village, including the Home Guard, thought he was signalling the invasion!!

Salvage: Ointment that makes you look older.

His
