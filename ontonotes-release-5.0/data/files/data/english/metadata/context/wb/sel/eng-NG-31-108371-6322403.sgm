2. SAI IN DREAMS:
http://www.ettitudemedia.com

These are the dream sequences and messages as received by SaiBaNiSaji
From our beloved GURU LORD SAINATH OF SHIRIDI. In Anticipation that
this feature will help in one's spiritual growth are hereby compiled
from his personal Diary and presented to SAIBANDHUS.

Translated and presented by RAGHU RAMAN SATULURY.

07-11-1994

I asked Sai to tell me whether it is required to know about Philosophy
before aiming for salvation. Sai appeared in the form of an unknown
person and said-

There is no need to know about Philosophy when a person is engrossed
in doing the right things at all times and is constantly engaged in
chanting the Lord's name.

Refuge in God is the only way for salvation.

09-11-1994

My mind was full of thoughts about spiritualism. The question in my
mind was whether it is required to know about Shastras and engage in
performing daily rituals for appeasement of the Lord. Oh Sai! Please
advise me. The visual runs like this-

I was happily watching my three-year-old son on a swing in a park,
located in front of my house. His playmates were pushing the swing. He
lost the grip and was almost falling down when I shrieked Sai's name
in a state of utter helplessness. Later to my astonishment, I found my
son flying in air and landing in front of my house. I firmly believed
this as Sai's miracle. At the same time my wife was serving food. I
rushed inside and performed abhishek to Sai's statue with morsels of
cooked rice. A friend of mine came to my house and observed my doings.
He advised me that it was not proper to do that way. I replied that I
am not aware of what Shastras say, but I did so with a sense of
gratitude to Sai who saved my son from a certain fall.

What ever is done or offered with devotion is acceptable.

10-11-1994

Today, my mind was pre-occupied with thoughts centered between the
state of happiness and unhappiness. I prayed Sai to show me with
examples the demarcation between the two. Sai said-

-It is equivalent to the feeling one gets after removing the obstacles
on a road and continuing the journey

-The feeling one gets in reuniting with his family members after a
long gap due to forced circumstances.
-The satisfaction derived in transporting a disabled person to his
destination without anticipating any return.
-Recollecting the happy days sitting in the childhood school after
having grown up.
-Successfully plucking a fruit from a thorny tree, bending due to the
wind.
-After having a sumptuous meal satiating the much felt hunger.
-Cycling with your son seated in front and imagining a bright future
for Him.

State of happiness and sorrow are relative to one another originating
from within.

Happiness comes from within.

3. QUINTESSENCE OF SRI SAIBABA'S PHILOSOPHY:
(By Late Sri Bharam UmamaheswaraRao)
"Shashi": shashi ... @yahoo.com

26. Mind Alone Is Held Responsible For the Bondage &amp; Emancipation

Swamiji further said: "That the physical body is composed of five
forms. It is only by profound Philosophical enquiry that we can
understand the nature of these five forms. It is `Tatwa Vichara'
(spiritual enquiry) which enables us to plumb the depths of the mind.
Tatwa Vichara is nothing but spiritual enquiry about God. The human
body is composed of twenty five principles which consist of five
organs of actions (Karmendriyas), five organs of perception
(Jnanendriyas), five vital airs (Pancha Pranas), five sensations
(Pancha Tanmatras), four internal instruments (Anthakarnas i.e. manas,
buddi, chitta, anhakara) and the life source. Since the physical body
consists of the 25 principles which originate from Viswa (Universe),
the physical body is known as Visvudu. So man is not mere individual
but the embodiment of the Universe itself. While the physical body is
knows as Visvudu, the Subtle body contains in it 17 principles of
sensations, five organs of perception, five vital airs, mind and
intellect. Since the subtle body consists of the 17 principles of
suffused with Tejas (effulgence), the subtle body is called Taijusudu
(the effulgence one).

It is the subtle body which experiences the trails and tribulations,
joys and sorrows of the world. Hence, the subtle body is also known as
Yathana Deha (the suffering body). The casual body (Karana Deha) is
made of the two principles of Chitta (reflective mind) and Pragna
(constant integrated awareness). As this body is suffused with Pragna
it is called Pragnudu. The super casual body (Mahakarana Sareera)
which is also known as the overt mind is self resplendent, self
luminous and self-radiant. The super casual body is also knows as
Uniki (existence). Uniki is nothing but the knowledge of oneself.
Since Uniki is synonymous with awareness this is known as Eruka. The
non-awareness of this known is known as Marupu (forgetfulness). The
gross, the subtle and the casual body are stamped by purifying your
minds – impurity. The three states of waking, dreaming and sleeping
are enveloped by the forgetfulness by mind".

To be continued…..

4.  SANATANA DHARMA &amp;SHRI SHIRDI SAIBABA
Hinduism is the most ancient religion known to the world as Sanatana
Dharma. This is the only religion in the world which is also a way of
life for all to follow, specially Indian's. It is a religion that gets
its guidance from the Vedas Upanishads Sutras Epics Granthas and
Prabhandhams. Aa-gama Shastra is one of them.

The Bhagavat Gita preached by Lord Krishna to Arjuna, on the
battlefield of Kurukshetra, sug-gests various parts to reach the
ultimate aim that God is one. Sanathana Dharma based on the eternal
Vedas, faced many upheavals for several centuries, and could withstand
the onslaught only because of its innate strength. The Vedas proclaim
that God is one. The Bhakthi cult preached by various Saints "Nam
Smaran" (chanting God's name) is the easiest way of reaching Him. The
Hindu sees God in the form the devotee likes most.

The temples were and are places where man learnt about himself, learnt
various arts like music, dance, religion, etc. The temples reveal the
various manifestations of the Supreme Being installed therein.

An important factor almost universally accepted is that faith in a
divine power shapes the destiny of mankind. Sanathana Dharma had
famous Saints who had expounded their own specific phi-loopy.
.
Though God is the ultimate authority to grant salvation to a devotee
the method of approach to attain Moksha (salvation) can be obtained by
an Acharya or Guru, the intermediary, who represents Almighty, a
learned intellectual, dispels the disciples spiritual ignorance. The
Acharya who initiates the disciple into spiritual bliss is the link
between the individual and the Cosmic Soul. Acharyas are chosen
representatives of God.

It is amazing to find a majority of spiritual Saints in Hinduism had
composed valuable literature- Kavyas, Prabandhas, Songs, Poems, and
Shlokas.

Hinduism is rich in such scriptures written by the great Saints, which
again shows the God's blessing on them.

5. DEVOTEES EXPERIENCES:
yogeshv.gu ... @gmail.com
Date: Dec 21, 2006 4:08 PM

Shree Sainathaya namah

I still remember the night very vividly in my memories. That was a
clear night and we were to embark on a journey of lifetime to United
States. It was the month of January and the days were very chilly. I
was all decked up and ready to leave. My father had hired a sumo to
see us off. The flight being around 7:00 AM the next day I personally
thought leaving at 1:00 AM would be a good idea as it would give me
enough time to handle all the formalities after reaching the airport.
Also the other reason of this rather crunched up schedule was my child
who may get restless at the airport .So I chose not to leave early but
dot on schedule without any room for any delays.

We all got down from our flat on 7th floor and loaded the six bags of
stuff into the Sumo that was to drive us to THE journey. The driver
was getting restless as he wanted to drop us and probably catch some
winks back after coming home. So we finally bid goodbye to our home
and started our journey. Started the journey?

The driver put his keys and started the ignition .The sumo engine
roared and stopped. This happened two times .We thought this was due
to the chilly weather .So I never thought even once that something was
wrong when the driver asked us to get down and push the car for some
feet. I, my brother and my friend Sanjay did as was told and the jeep
finally started. Good for us ….

It had only gone around 1 km before it again stopped. The engine again
stopped roaring. Now I looked at my watch .the time had started
ticking. I asked the driver as to what was wrong. He looked pale but
he shrugged off giving the season excuse.

He said just a few more pushes to the jeep and everything would be
fine .So we mindlessly started pushing. It went on for 15 ft, 30 60
100 200 ft.Still we could not hear the engine roaring again. Now I
started sensing trouble. The driver started to go very pale .He asked
us to stop and looked at the dash board indicators.  The fuel tank
empty light was glowing in its full glory. It was 1:30 in the morning
and Kalyan is a small town. So you don't have anyone on road except
for a few stray dogs. What were our options?

6. SPIRITUAL GEMS FROM SAI SATCHARITRA

"Swamy" swamym ... @yahoo.com
Sat, 16 Dec 2006 20:01:34 -0800 (PST)

Shri Sai Satcharitra
Chapter XXII
Rescues from Serpent-bites

SSS: Balasaheb Mirikar

Balasaheb Mirikar, son of Sirdar Kakasaheb Mirikar was Mamlatdar of
Kopergaon. He was going on tour to Chitali. On the way he came to
Shirdi to see Sai Baba. When he went to the Masjid and prostrated
himself before Baba, usual conversation regarding health and other
matters commenced, when Baba sounded a note of warning as follows:-"Do
you know our Dwarakamayi?" As Balasaheb did not understand he kept
quiet, Baba continued - "This is our Dwarakamayi, where you are
sitting. She wards off all dangers and anxieties of the children, who
sit on her lap. This Masjidmayi (its presiding Deity) is very
merciful; she is the mother of the simple devotees, whom she will save
in calamities. Once a person sits on her lap, all his troubles are
over. He, who rests in her shade, gets Bliss". Then Baba gave him Udi,
and placed His protecting hand on his head. When Balasaheb was about
to depart, He again said- "Do you know the "Lamba Baba" (long
gentleman), Viz. serpent?" And then closing the left arm like fist He
brought it near the right elbow, and moving His left arm like the hood
of a serpent, He said- "He is so terrible, but what can he do to the
children of Dwarakamayi: When the Dwarakamayi (its presiding deity)
protects, what can the serpent do?"

All who were present there, were curious to know the meaning of all
this and its reference to Mirikar, but none had the courage to ask
Baba about this. Then Balasaheb saluted Baba and left the Masjid with
Shama. Baba called Shama back and asked him to accompany Balasaheb,
and enjoy the Chitali trip. Shama came to Balasaheb, and told him that
he would go with him according to Baba's wish. Balasaheb replied that
he need not come as it would be inconvenient. Sharma returned to Baba
and told Him what Balasaheb said to him. Baba said, "Alright, do not
go. We should mean well and do well. Whatever is destined to happen,
will happen".

SSG: Sai Ram. The question of Destiny vs. Free Will is too deep for
our intellect to fathom. At the individual level, we have been given
some capability and with capability comes responsibility. So, if we
accept Free Will, we must accept responsibility for the actions too.
On the other hand, if we accept that everything is governed by
destiny, we are neither responsible for the actions or the results and
are simply instruments or puppets. True egoless ness results in
accepting destiny. Sai Baba is talking as a normal person here so that
we can relate better to Him. He is the controller of destiny but is
talking as if He too is a bit player! Sai Ram.

SSS: In the meanwhile Balasaheb thought over again, and calling Shama
asked him to accompany him. Then Shama going again to Baba and taking
His leave started with Balasaheb in the tanga.

SSG: Sai Ram. Pl. read this above few lines carefully. Shama did not
go away with Balasaheb taking the earlier command of Baba as valid!
When Sai asked Shama to accompany Balasaheb and the later declined the
offer, he went back to Sai and reported the same. So that offer was
over at that time. So, when Balasaheb changed his mind and asked Shama
to accompany him, Shama went again to Sai and took His express
permission. This is how a great Bhakta should behave, a true servant
should behave. Shama was considered to be the closest devotee of Baba
for these reasons. Sai Ram.

SSS: They reached Chitali at 9 P.M. and encamped in the Maruti temple.
The office-people had not come; so they sat quiet in the temple,
talking and chitchatting. Balasaheb was sitting on a mat reading a
newspaper. His Uparani (upper dhotar) was spread across his waist and
on a part of it a snake was sitting unobserved. It began to move with
a rustling sound which was heard by the peon. He brought a lantern,
saw the snake and raised an alarm - 'serpent, serpent'. Balasaheb was
frightened and began to quiver. Shama was also amazed. Then he and
others moved noiselessly and took sticks and clubs in their hands. The
snake got down slowly from the waist and it moved away from Balasaheb;
it was immediately done to death. Thus this calamity, which was
prophesied by Baba, was averted and Balasaheb's love for Baba was
deeply confirmed.

SSG: Sai Ram. Elsewhere, Baba answers the question of whether one
should kill snakes and scorpions etc, or not. As mentioned above,
whatever is destined to happen, will happen. The serpent was destined
to die and Balasaheb was destined to live. Sai went as Shama and
protected Sri Balasaheb and gave a Sadgati to the snake! Sai Ram.

We will take up the remaining stories of this chapter in the weeks to
come. Sai Ram.

7. SAI WITH CHILDREN:
http://www.saidarbar.org/HTML/portraits/7.jpg
Smt. Madhu Gopal Ravada, Saidarbar, Hyderabad.

Hello Children! I am Madhu aunty. Do you know Baba use to play with
children and used to tell stories to them? I felt children visiting
Saidarbar should be entertained with good stories. For the last two
years I have told you about Lord Krishna's Leelas and Lord Rama Story.
Now I want to tell the stories what heard in my child hood.

The story of the crows and the serpent

Once upon a time there lived a crow couple, who had built a nest on
the top of a tree. But unfortunately the tree was inhabited by a
serpent at its bottom. So the serpent used to crawl up the tree and
eat all the eggs that the lady crow used to lay. The crow couple were
deeply grieved and when this happened time after time, then they
decided that the serpent was to be get rid of by a plan.
.
So the crow then approached his friend the jackal and asked for a
plan. The jackal then told him to go and fetch a costly thing from the
palace of the king and throw the thing in the burrow of the snake. The
crow went to palace, and stole a necklace of the queen while she was
bathing. The guards of the palace ran after it. The crow then dropped
the necklace in the burrow of the snake beneath the tree.
.
The guards on reaching the bottom of the tree, found the necklace
guarded by the serpent. Then they lynched the serpent and recovered
the necklace. So the crow family was now happy that their eggs were
safe now.

MORAL: Wit can achieve anything

A Chapter A Day Brings Us Closer To Sri Sai
Aum Sai Sri Sai Jaya Jaya Sai

We are all united under the roof of Sri Sai's love. This bond is
purely due to his divine grace. I am sure all are doing Sri Sai
parayana of two chapters a day. Reading of Shri Sai Satcharitra is
very significant. The benefits of reading Shri Sai Satcharitra are
many folds. While reading we are constantly thinking of Him, it draws
us closer to Him. While reading we visualize the events during the
time of Sri Sai, this increases our love towards Him. And another
amazing factor which I have experienced while reading Shri Sai
Satcharitra regularly is that my intuition has increased many folds. I
am sure there are many out there who have had the same euphoric
experience as I have had. This is just the beginning of our love
towards Sri Sai. Can you imagine what it would be when we go closer to
him not just in mind but, mind, body and soul? Let us call out to Sri
Sai. Let us harmoniously share our experiences and our love towards
Sri Sai and learn from each others experiences.

He alone is our protector and takes us through the ocean of existence
holding us closer to his bosom. Sri Sai we, your children seek your
constant companionship and guidance in our life. Let us not be tempted
with evil but let us always remain truthful to you and to ourselves.
Make us respond to everybody with love, compassion and empathy. Oh Sai
bless us and guide us always. May Sai always steer us towards Him and
His Shri Satcharitra.

Bow To Sri Sai - Peace Be To All
May Baba Be Always With You

12. EDITORIAL.

Things impressed me from this magazine:

Though God is the ultimate authority to grant salvation to a devotee
the method of approach to attain Moksha (salvation) can be obtained by
an Acharya or Guru, the intermediary, who represents Almighty, a
learned intellectual, dispels the disciples spiritual ignorance. The
Acharya who initiates the disciple into spiritual bliss is the link
between the individual and the Cosmic Soul. Acharyas are chosen
representatives of God.

The Hindu sees God in the form the devotee likes most.
