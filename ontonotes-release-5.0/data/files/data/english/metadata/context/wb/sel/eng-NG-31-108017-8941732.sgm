i need some help regarding kyusu. i was checking out some kyusu online
from vendor like maikotea, o-cha and etc...anyone had experiences with
buying japanese wares. i want to get some better quality ones but not
too sure which vendor to go to. most of the kyusu are made by japanese
clay. What about yixing one? i have seen some chinese kyusu but not
too sure if the effect would be the same by brewing japanese green tea
in it. chinese kyusus are made from yixing clay. i dont brew my
chinese green tea in yixing teapots.

Right now I am using gaiwan for my chinese green tea and japanese
green tea. But been reading about kuysu lately, and found out that it
does improve the flavor of green tea by using it. can i used the same
kuysu to brew gyokuro, sencha, mecha, kukicha and all the different
japanese tea?

Also if anyone know where I could find an battery operated matcha
whisk? I think it was from bodum. I can't seem to find the store that
sells it anymore. It can be tiring to whisk matcha sometimes :(

I tend to buy Kyusu in the $40-60 range myself, and the quality is
always decent. I'm not a fanatic for top-end wares since I am more old-
school in my tea drinking and stick to the more &quot;commoner&quot; gear. No
one outside of royalty was using any super high-end gear back in the
day and I'm sure their enjoyment of the tea was ten fold that of the
nobility. I stay away from very cheesy junk, but just about anything
beyond that will serve the purpose and last a long time if cared for.
The Dragonfly one from O-cha seems nice, good size, nice design, and
seems middle of the road.

I will say that I rarely use my kyusu so you may want to re-evaluate
the need for one. I'd be wary of those telling you that it is going to
change the flavor. I tend to use either gaiwan, my three piece mug, or
a glass tea pot for my greens. I also have one Yixing I use for
jasmine green even though it is not &quot;correct.&quot; I like the glass teapot
since it allows you and your guests to see the color, and watch the
leaves. Kyusu tend to be more decorative for me now.

If you go with a glazed one (interior) then you can use it for
multiple teas with no problem.

You could use one of those little battery operated cappuchino/frother
things, they sell them at a dollar store by my house even. Although, I
have to say I've never gotten a workout making matcha. The thought is
similar to nails on a chalkboard to me to use one with matcha... but
don't let that stop you.

good luck!

It depends upon where you are - there is Takashimaya in New York City.
Yaohan's in California. Morukai and Mitsuwa are also in California.
The battery operated whisks are very reasonable in Ikea ($2.99). They
work for matcha.
Compai!

Dominic,

Maybe I should reconsider, i just got so into it when i read about how
the japanese clay from the perfecture could enhance your tea taste,
like making the smoother, less bitter and sweeter..

Yeah, it is easy to get caught up into hype online... but I assure you
it is just that, hype. Just the same with Yixing, after maybe 10-20
years of perfect care and feeding it may make a very very slight
difference, but to claim any more than that is a bit silly. I have a
Yixing that has been used for jasmine green tea for over 15 years or
so now and yes, by itself with hot water poured in you can smell the
jasmine... will it magically pour brewed tea with just water? Nope.
Jasmine is highly fragrant too, so the subtle nature of most teas are
going to be far less pronounced. I'd never steer someone away from
trying something new and adding to their collection, just steer you
away from dropping a life savings in hopes of some profound effect.

I find it is mostly a mental thing, if you think your teapot adds
something then in your mind it will. It helps create the full illusion
and sometimes that is a nice change from hustle and bustle. I have had
the chance to drink tea from a Yixing that had been passed down
through countless generations, and besides the high skill and
familiarity with the tea, the pot, and the brewing of the tea I'd say
it added nothing more than a beautiful centerpiece and some great
stories... and that adds all the flavor to the tea in the world.

If you are planning to brew japanese green tea every day then I
recommend a kyusu--it's what I use for my japanese greens.  They allow
tea to be brewed in larger quantities, so it's good when you want a
nice mug.  They also pour quickly.  It's definitely a different way of
enjoying tea than a gaiwan (I never use infuser mugs).  My favorite is
a hagiware kyusu because it seems to improve the flavor of the tea,
but for more refined sencha I use a tokoname shudei kyusu that I
special ordered from maikotea.  It has a clay filter, which I like
(you can get one on ebay).

Hibiki-an has really nice kyusu as well, that have gotten rave
reviews.  I got their iced-tea pot which I thought was excellent; in
general they've got good taste so although I can't speak for their
kyusu I do think their tea and other tea ware is good.  I'd get a real
clay kyusu because I bought a cheap one once and didn't love it
(although it did the job of brewing the tea, its aesthetics didn't
please me).

You may also want to check out the stuff on www.zencha.net which is
super craftsy, and sometimes the japanstore part of e-yakimono.net has
reasonably priced kyusu.

Good luck!

I have a Chinese version of the kyusu.  They come in various clay
sizes glazed on the inside for brewing herbs over a fire.  I have a 2L
size which takes one hand to hold and the other hand on that wrist to
pour.  It's rough clay not smooth like Yixing.  I expect mine to
crumble anytime. That one not that many years ago cost $5.  They're in
Chinese supermarkets.
