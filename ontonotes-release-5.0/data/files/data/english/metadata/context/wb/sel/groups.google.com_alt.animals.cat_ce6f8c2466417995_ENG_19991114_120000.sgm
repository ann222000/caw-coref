Hi there

My cat must have urinated while on top of the VCR, because it smells awful.
I think the heat generated while plugged in makes it engluf the whole room.
I wiped the unit down well, be it must have gotten gone down through the
vent on top.

BTW, this is not a continuing problem, just a &quot;one-shot&quot; deal. We are
selling our house and one of our 3 cats gets really scared and jumps on top
of the TV upstairs, and thinks no one can see her :) You can't imagine what
we did to the room looking for the source of the odor until we found it!

Anyone have any suggestions? Are there any products that would be safe to
spray inside electronic equipment (assuming it was unplugged and allowed to
fully dry?

Thanks in advance.

Hi Ellen,

Wow, that's a stinker of a problem all right :)

OK, bad jokes aside, spraying anything into the VCR through the door will
probably not help much and will almost certainly make the VCR damage tapes.
Any kind of residue will make the load/eject mechanism sticky and the VCR
will start &quot;eating&quot; tapes. Also, the video and audio heads are directly
exposed, and spraying any harsh cleaning or deodorizing solution on them
will interfere with operation at best and could cause the tape to adhere to
the heads and destroy the tape, and possibly even the heads (and therefore
the VCR itself). In fact, the urine itself may cause tapes to stick to the
inner mechanisms if it got to the wrong places inside.

However, there is some good news. VCR's are relatively easy to clean. You
can have it done professionally at many video rental stores or at many
stores that sell VCRs, but it will cost you $50 or more -- which is
ridiculous. I clean my VCRs about once every six months and have never had
any problems doing it. Here's how to do it, but (disclaimer warning! &lt;g&gt;)
I'm not any kind of technician so if something should happen you can't blame
me, OK? :)

Also, I'm going to try to make this explanation as simple as possible and
assume you have no idea what I'm talking about. I don't think you're stupid,
I'm just trying to make this as easy as possible :)

First, remove any tape from the machine, unplug the VCR, and let it sit
unplugged for at least half an hour. This will allow the charge in any
capacitors to dissipate at least somewhat, reducing or eliminating the
chance for electric shock.

The top is held on with screws, near the edges of the case. The screws may
be on the back, the bottom, or both, but they will be near the edges of the
case. Any screws in the middle of the case, especially on the bottom, hold
the electronics in the case and should not be removed. On many models, once
the screws are removed you have to slide the top of the case either forward
or backward and it will then disengage and come completely off. You may have
to wiggle it back and forth to get it loose, but don't force anything. If
the case seems loose but just won't come off, look to see if you've missed a
screw somewhere.

Once the top of the case is off, look at the area where the electric cord
enters the case. Near that point on the inside will be a large block-like
object. There may also be one or more largish canister-like objects near
that. This is the power transformer and capacitors. Don't touch them or
anywhere around them. They are probably completely safe, but keep safety
first in mind. You should not encounter any high voltage anywhere else in
the unit; the VCR operates on lower voltage and the rest of the unit should
all be on the low-voltage side of the circuit.

You will also see one or more bright silver disk-like objects. These are
the rotating video heads. If you look at the area right behind the door
where you insert tapes, you will see several silver spindles, some at
strange-looking angles. Further back from the tape door, you will also see
at least two and possibly more black plastic blocks with wires coming out of
them. These are the erase head and audio head(s). The entire area from the
door back to behind the rotating video heads is the area where the tape
runs. When you push a tape into the machine, the mechanism grabs the tape,
pulls it inside while opening the little door on the tape, seats it into a
cubbyhole designed for a tape to rest in, and then pulls a fairly long
stretch of tape out of the cassette and back into the mechanism so that it
moves over the erase head, the front side of the rotating video heads(s),
back toward the front and over the audio heads(s), and into the cassette
again. This serpentine area is called the tape path.

Under the tape path, you may see what looks like a fine black paste or it
may look more like a layer of blackish dirt. This is graphite lubricant, and
is absolutely required for the operation of the VCR. Its frequently best to
just leave the existing graphite alone, but in your case you may not be able
to. If so, get a small tube of electronics-grade graphite lubricant to
re-lubricate the tape path. You can get it at any good hardware or
department store, and it isn't expensive.

OK, now to the nitty gritty. Take several soft cloths, not paper towels
(which tear too easily and leaves paper dust), and some plain old rubbing
alcohol. Moisten the cloths well, but not dripping, with the alcohol and
gently clean anywhere that looks dusty, dirty, or like it may have been peed
on &lt;g&gt;. Change the place you use on the cloth frequently. Again, avoid the
transformer area. You may see many small circles of metal with tiny spikes
in the middle on yellow-brown flat pieces. This is what the back side of
electronic circuit boards look like. Just wipe gently in between them if you
can. If they catch on the cloth too much, you may have to use cotton swabs
dipped in alcohol and shaken so they aren't dripping to clean these areas.
Its tedious, but it works.

Use cotton swabs dipped in alcohol and shaken to clean all of the various
heads and, if necessary, the tape path. When you're done, look closely to
see if there are any fibers from the cotton swabs left on the heads. Gently
pick these off, or you can blow them off easily. If you have a can of
compressed air for you computer, you can use that too.

If Kitty managed to hit the transformer area, use extra-long cotton swabs
dipped in alcohol to clean there, and try not to touch any part of them with
your hands.

If you had to clean the graphite off the tape path, gently squeeze a very,
very small amount of graphite from the tube all along the tape path. Be VERY
CAREFUL to not get any graphite on ANY of the heads because it will
eventually damage the heads and also could damage tapes. With graphite, a
little dab will definitely do you -- be careful not to use too much. Just a
very, very thin bead along the tape path is all you need.

Allow any alcohol to dry thoroughly, which should take under a minute. Then
reverse the process to replace the top cover and you're done! The whole
process took me about an hour and a half the first time, now it takes maybe
30 - 45 minutes tops.

Whew! Hope this helps! Good luck!

Ron Allen

Hiya Chizotz!

I was just about to give a 10 page explanation too, but hey, well done!! :-)
