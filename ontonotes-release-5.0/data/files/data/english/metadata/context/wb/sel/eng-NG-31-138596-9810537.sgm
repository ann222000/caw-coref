9b3e03d05ffe356d9d03-3&gt; Editor's note: In a time when the United States is
launching its newly restructured military command regime for Africa --
pointedly directed at providing Western access to oil and mineral resources
-- friends of that continent fear the disparity cited by the author will
only increase, not diminish.

Oil has made us billions and fueled our economic stability, but oil has also
become the bane of our existence.

For some, it is a curse that has caused poverty and corruption, but for
others it is an essential source of untold wealth and power. But as the gap
between rich and poor countries continues to expand, it is clear that
intellectual capital and technology rule the! world, and that natural
resources such as oil, gold, and diamonds are no longer the primary
determinants of wealth.

Surprisingly, nations with few natural resources demonstrate greater
economic growth rates than OPEC countries. Japan’s economic growth, driven
by technological superiority, outpaces that of Saudi Arabia; South Korea is
growing faster than oil-rich Nigeria; and Taiwan’s economy has moved well
beyond that of oil-rich Venezuela.

The United States and Norway are also rich in oil, yet their staggering
economic growth comes from intellectual capital.

In reality, it is not money but intellectual capital that drives prosperity.
More important, perhaps, is the reality that poverty is driven and sustained
by a lack of intellectual capital. The intimate relationship between
intellectual capital and economic growth is as old as humanity itself, and
is well illustrated by this parable from ancient Babylon—modern-day Iraq. A
man asked his children:

“! If you had a choice between the clay of wisdom or a bag of gold, which
would you choose?”

“The bag of gold, the bag of gold” the naïve children cried, not realizing
that wisdom had the potential to earn them many more bags of gold in the
future.

Seven thousand years later, Iraq —- the cradle of civilization —- has its
own private bag of gold as it sits perched atop the world’s third largest
oil reserves. Meanwhile, Israel, tucked away in the hostile terrain of a
barren desert, has the clay of wisdom — the weightless wealth of
intellectual capital embodied in the collective mind of its people.

The striking economic gap that persists between rich and poor nations has
increased sevenfold over the past century to what is now an all-time high.
The accumulation of intellectual capital by rich nations has helped broaden
this gap because it has enabled them to control technology and collect
hidden taxes from less affluent nations. For instance, Nigeria pays a
40-percent “royalty” tax on its petroleum revenues to foreign oil companies
that are ripping out its family jewels —- the huge store of wealth in its
oilfields. These oilfields started forming when prehistoric, dog-sized
humans —- our common ancestor with the apes —- walked African grasslands on
four legs.

It’s a shocking reality, but the deep oil reserves laid down by Mother
Nature millions of years ago and nurtured through the millennia in Africa
have been whittled away within decades. And, for the dubious privilege of
surrendering its natural resources forever, Nigeria is required to pay half
its petroleum revenue in the form of “royalties” to the rich kids on the
global block, the United States and the Netherlands. That oilfield has been
exchanged for a bowl of porridge, and the black gold that should serve the
underserved in Nigeria is helping wealthy Westerners get wealthier.

Today, half the world’s population —- three billion people —- live on an
average of $500 a year. In contrast, Bill Gates earns $500 every second. By
controlling technology and taxing computer users, Gates has become wealthier
than each of the 70 poorest nations on earth and using his financial might
has conquered more territory than Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar and Alexander
the Great combined.

While Bill Gates is the new millennium’s Prince of Technology, he is by no
means the first to have taken on the huge potential offered by the realm of
technology. The Romans used roads and military technology to expand their
empire. And, for centuries, Britain ruled a quarter of the earth due to its
unparalleled ability to command maritime technology and conquer the Seven
Seas.

Britain undoubtedly established itself as the world’s first superpower
through its rapid and ruthless colonial expansion program. The British
raised the Union Jack over Canada and Australia, India and Hong Kong, Egypt
and Kenya, and countless other countries -— even the United States. The
Union Jack cast its shadow in every global time zone, giving rise to the
saying, “The sun never sets on the British Empire,” a fact that was cold
comfort to the colonized nations.

In the same way, the United States has embraced its technological supremacy,
both offensively and defensively, to build its own global empire without a
physical presence in any of its “colonies.” The sole remaining superpower is
at the forefront of every major technological advancement, which it has used
to become deeply embedded in three-quarters of the globe.

The US has accomplished a virtual economic colonization manifesting its
presence throughout the globe by harnessing the power of technology and
capitalizing on its clay of wisdom.

Africa’s inability to realize its potential and embrace technology has left
it at the mercy of the West. The time has come for Africa to seize the day
and resist the efforts of America and others to leave their imprint and
plunder its natural resources.

Numerous examples throughout history support the idea that technology can be
used as a tool of oppression. And there’s little doubt that America’s
technological advancement has allowed it to exploit natural resources around
the world. This is particularly evident in Africa, where the US is
exploiting oilfields beneath the pristine rainforest -— and being rewarded
with a 40-percent tax at the expense of the African people. This lends
credence to history’s assertion that those who control technology oppress
those who do not, eventually enslaving them and, finally, wielding power
around the globe.

Excerpted from a keynote speech delivered by Philip Emeagwali at the African
Diaspora Conference in Tucson, Arizona on September 29, 2007. The entire
transcript is posted at emeagwali.com.

Nigerian-born Philip Emeagwali won the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize, the Nobel
Prize of supercomputing. He has been called “a father of the Internet” by
CNN and TIME; praised as an “unorthodox innovator [who] has pushed back the
boundaries of oilfield science” by UPSTREAM, a leading European oil and gas
industry journal; extolled as “one of the great minds of the Information
Age” by former U.S. president Bill Clinton, and voted history’s 35th
greatest African by New African.

Forum,
Citizen Philip Emeagwali’s thesis in this commentary is one that I used
to think I, alone, held.
Given the amount of energy that we expend on mundane matters and the way
the leaderships in Africa and their policies seem to hail
from Mars, I sometimes think no one else, but me, recognizes the unique
role that home-grown modern technology desperately stands to
play on our continent, aspirations and in our lives.

The lack of respect for Africans by most every non-African is all too
pervasive. The injustice of slavery is as evil as the orchestrated
gloomy news on Africa is palpably irritating. The ideals of African
Union (AU) or single regional currency (e.g. West Africa - ECOWAS) are
all lofty and dandy. However, we Africans need to appreciate the
futility of shouting alone at racial indignity or wishing continental
singularity on inadequate intellectual power or incapable political
system of governance.

The three main industries that currently prop up Nigeria, the weak giant
of ECOWAS, are Oil, Banking and Government. These three industries are
those that account for the most employment in the country. Of these,
only one, Oil, is the one that generates the most income. Government
simply spends or embezzles and Banking just paper-trades whatever
remains in circulation yielding phantom revenue that is hardly felt by
the lame economy. Even in this single commodity economy, Africa cannot
extract its own natural resources by herself because she does not
possess the required technology to do so. The snooty West who own such
intellectual property charge Africa (as they should) for their
exploration know-how, the equipment and the labor, making her pay more
than 50 cents on goods and services per dollar of revenue. It is
doubtful whether all of the intimidating oil platform structures
illuminating the dark coastal oil fields in Africa are not on leasehold
to Africa. This is hardly a commodity to which anyone could fasten a
national economy, much less a regional one. Many a pan-Africanist might
think that all the wishful sentimental single yearnings – single AU,
single AU military, single AU currency – would take Africa to modernity
faster than the military coup took Rawlings to power in Ghana. But there
is no short-cut to the top of the palm tree. Industrial revolution into
modern technology is the tool that Africa needs for a plural development
that endures.

Whatever glamorous civilization Africa might have had, had long weakened
and faded into the labyrinth of history. Its relevance to today sorry
state of affairs in Africa is at best equivocal. Invoking it in protests
against racism is desperate, useless and empty. Availability of
home-grown modern technology in Africa would significantly diminish the
severity of our present state of dependency within only a decade or two.
New-age technology would secure a pride of place for Africa in future
among the comity of races.

Technological awareness (let alone advancement) in Africa is not by
paying Russia or China to lease a satellite and help her drive it into
and back from space. That is meaningful only to the kind of dimwit
leaderships in charge of Africa today. Real grasp of technology is for
Africa to possess the know-how to make her own car, computer, flyover,
pharmaceuticals, guns or cooling fans. All of the 54 or so countries in
Africa don’t have to initiate industrial revolution at the same time,
nor does any one country need undertake the journey into technology in
all fields all at once. Technology is inherently infectious. The science
of technology provides the kind of autocatalysis for a chain reaction
that could take a society from one civilized state to another. Attaining
proficiency in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals in one African nation
could easily open the door to improved standard of living of her
citizenry due to easier access to cures. Mastery of automobile
manufacturing by one African country could lead to an industrial
revolution in the wide universe of transportation technology in multiple
countries of Africa, in tandem or parallel.

One immediate economic gain of a modern technology culture in Africa is
that Africa is primarily her own market for whatever she makes. At more
than 50 countries comprising of more than a billion consumers, the
markets of Africa are inherently insatiable. The revenue base for any
African nation that gets itself into a technology race is huge, the
impact on its economy enormous. Creating a modern technology culture in
Africa is easier than voting at elections in most African countries
because there are hundreds of thousands of trained Africa scientists
scattered all over the globe. From aeronautics to nuclear sciences
(medicine and physics), agriculture to biotechnology, solid African
professionals are ubiquitous and competitive in proficiency and
efficiency. Ironically, it is much easier to copy a technology today
than it was 200 years ago. Africa doesn’t have to rediscover Dalton’s
atom, Faraday’s electricity or Pasteur’s microbiology any longer. Africa
only needs to have leadership quality materials in charge of her
affairs. Quality Africans, who possess adequate understanding of the
imperativeness of modern technology in Africa and the zeal to implement
progressive policies that will move the continent forward to modernity.

Reminds me of a project that I worked on back in 1986 as a typical naïve
egg-head in the Nigerian academia. A policy announcement came by in the
papers that government would begin its Phase II Petrochemical program in
which petroleum by-product raw materials such as benzene, phenol,
polymers (polypropylene, polyethylene…), etc would be produced for sale
in the local market. It was the half-literate Babangida who was in power
then and I chose to take the announcement seriously. Go figure.
Meanwhile, Paracetamol (Panadol, Tylenol or Acetaminophen), an analgesic
(reduce pain) and antipyretic (reduce fever) drug, is among the most
heavily dispensed medications in Nigeria due to weather, malaria, manual
labor, general stressful living, etc. I don’t know about your neck of
the wood in Africa. The chemistry of the acetaminophen molecule is both
old and simple, in part, due to its very simple molecular structure. I
wanted to pre-empt the petrochemical program, so I decided to synthesize
paracetamol from simple bench solvents and reagents to prove that the
manufacture of this drug could be sourced locally, from raw materials to
the finished product. Who knows, any of the major hospitals in the
country might even be able to manufacture batches of paracetamol that
they need, routinely. Talking about synergy between government programs
and research in the universities. The chemical reactions were so simple
I gave the research out as a B.S. Pharmacy dissertation project. So my
student nitrated the common benzene solvent using laboratory acids, then
reduced the resultant nitrophenol to aniline which in turn was
acetylated with acetic acid to produce the acetaminophenol drug. The
ridiculous saga of my efforts to get the needed N1000 or so for local
travel to read the paper on the project at a pharmaceutical conference
in Abuja is beyond the scope of this commentary. Of course, the
government Phase II Petrochemicals project never took off, it wasn’t
meant to; it was merely one of those stillbirth evil-genus ideas of the
Babangida’s maximum regime.

The present crop of leaderships in Africa continues to demonstrate that
it is not fully engaged in the reality that is Africa today. They are
ill-equipped intellectually and by character to really grasp what Africa
needs either at the national and global arenas or at the individual and
race levels. First, we need to put a kibosh on the endemic corruption
that currently pins down Africa in a stranglehold. People in the
corridors of our power anywhere in Africa need to know that government
in Africa is a not-for-profit private enterprise. Government should not
be viewed and sought as a get-rich-quick vocation. What government means
right now in Africa is “Service.” If you have no clues on how you can
better the condition of the people or what the black race needs, stay
away from governance. Every prospective leadership aspirant in any
African country needs to know the far reaching implications of his
aspiration. They should know that their actions and performance in
office are used to judge the entire black race. The cream of political
class currently lording it over disease-laden, poverty stricken Africans
should just go, for they have misrepresented us poorly indeed to other
onlooking races. Regardless of the insincerity or hidden agenda of the
West in their “people support” for Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe should just
go and leave Zimbabwe to run its true destiny. He’s not relevant to the
progress march of Zimbabwe any longer. His time is long past, his era
gone.

We need a gale of fresh air, fresh minds, fresh ideas in the policy
making corridors of Africa.
We need modern technology, NOW!
