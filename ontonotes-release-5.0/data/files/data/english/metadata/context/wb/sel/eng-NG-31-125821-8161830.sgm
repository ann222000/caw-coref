&quot;Seven people have died after a freeway bridge over the Mississippi
river collapsed in the evening rush hour.
At least 60 were injured when part of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis
fell down at 1805 (2305 GMT) on Wednesday.

Fire Chief Jim Clack told reporters seven died as the structure
buckled, hurling up to 50 vehicles in the water.

The US Department of Homeland Security said there was no reason to
suspect the fall of the bridge, which had been undergoing repairs, was
terror-related.&quot;

I know they're only Americans, so we shouldn't feel too bad about it,
but it's certainly not something one sees everyday.  Well, unless one
works in the bridge demolition biz.

It may have been caused by the famous American obesity of the occupants
of the cars. I bet the bridge designers never factored that in.

I wonder if me stubbing my toe on the pavement as I left the house this
morning was terror-related? I must ask the Department of Homeland

Apparently, because of the size of the drop, it took a while for the cars to
fall into the river.  One driver said they counted, &quot;1 Mississippi, 2
Mississippi, 3 Mississippi&quot;, as they fell down.

Possibly because the first reaction of other ignorant cunts is that the
US is under attack again (though why the Forces of Darkness should
choose a clapped out bridge over a stinky river is neither here nor
there) and the authorities decided the first thing to do was to stop the
inbred locals torching any building owned by someone called Patel.

&quot;staring them in the face&quot;

Apparently, you know something everyone else doesn't.  Spill it.

Some very qualified civil engineers have undoubtedly been consulted
already and AFAIK none of them has yet offered the same opinion as you.

AIUI, the work that was being done was to the paving only, not to
the structure.  Still, it certainly will be investigated and could
well have contributed to the collapse, but to jump to the conclusion
that someone using a jackhammer brought the bridge down is somewhat
simplistic, to be generous.

As far as whether terrorism was the cause, I doubt it, but who knows
at this point?  Hard facts are in short supply.

All I know is my commute was slightly affected by extra traffic, but
as I don't cross the bridge I made it to work at my normal time, by
leaving a bit earlier.

It may have generated some kind of &quot;forced resonance&quot; effect (akin to a
large group of people marching in step) that weakened vital structures.
Given the regular and rapid percussive effects of a large drill this might
be a possibility. The famous Tacoma Narrows bridge fell down in a mere 40mph
wind due to resonance effects.

IanaCE but I do know how to shear a bolt or two.  Anyway, I heard an
eyewitness describe how the shoreside span fell first, the whole
structure wobbled a bit then the main span collapsed. Presumably due to
unbalanced forces in play then.

There was also a train going under at the time, which the bridge fell
on (I bet it stopped quick) but I doubt the rumbles from a train, a
drill and one or two lanes of traffic would bring a bridge down that
has been there fore four decades.  But I'm not an engineer :)

&gt;Lots of bridges undergo repair, lots of them (with large cracks in

Could it be that the span was only just resting on the support, possibly

Nope not a chance.

There is no doubt it was brought down by turncoat commie faggot ex FBI
employees trying to test the Powers That Control and Decide and that the
merkin gummint has successfully quietened public fears and any debate
about it being Ayrabs will not now happen and the real truth will never
be told except by me and who in their right mind pays any attention to
that sort of shit.

Tests will confirm that the white sticky substance found at the scene
was deposited by a crack team of masturbating secret service agents, who
used their genetically modified jizm of pH1.5, to corrode the tie bars.

Well, they had 9/11 as their &quot;new Pearl Harbor&quot;, but there's been such a
conspiracy-theory &quot;surge&quot; that they needed a &quot;new Tacoma Narrows&quot; to prove
that all sorts of weird shit could conveniently happen to structures.

Heh. Well, I doubt they can read in that neck of the woods anyway.
