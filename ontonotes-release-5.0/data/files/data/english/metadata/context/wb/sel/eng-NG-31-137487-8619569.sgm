Whole Slow Cooked Barbecue Chicken

1 chopped onion
1 whole skinned chicken
large can of sweet corn
1 can of chopped tomatoes or a can of plum tomatoes
half a bottle of BBQ sauce
potatoes
1 stock cube
cracked black pepper

Put a chopped onion into base of slow cooker. Score a whole skinned
chicken to allow flavours to permeate. Put whole chicken on the onion. Put
half a large can of sweet corn around chicken (including a bit of the
sweetened water it's in) and a can of chopped tomatoes or a can of plum
tomatoes (cheaper) cut up. Pour half a bottle of BBQ sauce onto chicken,
ensuring it gets into the scores. Put 1 cm or half inch slices of potatoes
(skin on or off) around the edges of slow cooker. Sprinkle a stock cube on
the potato slices. Put cracked black pepper on the chicken to season. Cook
on low heat for 8 hours. Serve hot with mixed vegetables. Serve cold with
salad.
