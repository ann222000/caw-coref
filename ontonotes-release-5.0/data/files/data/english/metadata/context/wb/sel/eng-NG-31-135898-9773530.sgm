OK, so has anyone run the game under the two different APIs, and been
able to see a worthwhile difference?

GIven what I have heard about Vista's footprint, it has me curious.
Also, does anyone know of a way of running DX10 under and older OS?

Thanks.

I did and didn't see a noticeable difference at first, but after some
folks here said the water effects were better I could tell that was true.
Not worth the hassle of Vista IMO though.

Yah, thats along the lines of what I was guessing...I have also read
about some sort of vertex smoothing that makes environments look more
natural/less geometric, and something about better looking volumetric
clouds...

But none of that seems like enough to justify paying for the OS,
getting extra memory, etc...

It really seems like graphics are moving in the direction of
customizable software for videocards, and writing to the video card,
rather than the OS/DX API.

That should be interesting...  Microsoft has said, in no uncertain terms,
that DX10 will not be added, supported, or allowed in XP.  After all, if we
could get all the gaming goodness that DX10 is supposed to bring in a nice
stable XP package, why would any of us gamers ever move to Vista?  The whole
Vista-only DX10 gaming thing is one of the marketing ploys to try to force
people to buy/upgrade to their new crap OS and keep the revenue rolling in.

If somebody comes up with a DX10 wrapper for XP, you'd think MS would fight
it tooth and nail.

This whole anti-vista thing is a joke. On Nov 7th, I will have been using
Vista Ultimate for a year, and it has been an absolute joy - not without any
trials and tribulations (mostly x64 issues), but I've certainly never looked
back. That said, I'd never recommend that anyone upgrade to it. But as
people buy new machines, they should get Vista included.

Back on-topic, DX10 will never be available on XP. Even if a 3rd party could
develop a wrapper (possible perhaps) and that performance was reasonable
(not sure), there is certainly no way MS are going to allow it. DX10 is one
of the carrots to encourage earlier adoption of Vista and it is the hook
that caught most gamers who have bothered to upgrade. MS are simply not
going to allow DX10 to run on XP. I doubt they have a legal case; more
likely they will change the way either XP of DX10 works, such that it will
break the 3rd-party wrapper.

By the time said 3rd parties can react, Vista adoption will be widespread
and DX10+XP will be a niche market.

That said, from what I have seen of DX10, if you have a top end gfx card, it
can make some thigs look really purdy... but the improvement is
incremental... People agree it looks better and some more complex things can
be renders more 'cheaply' but there is no 'Wow!' factor.

Bioshock looked pretty damn good on DX9 anyway. Besides, apart from the
first few stages, who stopped long enough to to even notice the scenery... I
was too busy fightly splicers.

I'm not really anti-Vista, as I've supported many friends/family/customers
who have it.  My problem with Vista is that it was released in a horridly
buggy state, with total crap driver support, and with most of the great
features I was looking forward to (that would have made it more of a
&quot;must-have&quot;) having been lost or abandoned along the way because they were
&quot;just too hard to do&quot; in the timeframe they had.  Oh and there was the whole
matter of a wide variety of programs just not working with Vista,
particularly custom applications and legacy software that might still be
widely used but no longer have any ongoing development teams to keep
adapting to the changing MS policies.  And then MS had the nerve to push
this bug-fest so hard into the market that they coerced most manufacturers
to offer ONLY Vista immediately on its release, giving the consumer
absolutely no choice in the matter.  It was only after looking at potential
losses in the billions to the corporate sectors, that many of the big names
in the computer industry backpedaled and suddenly started offering XP on
machines if it was requested - of course, that happened 2 weeks after I had
to buy a notebook to replace my dead one, and was forced into Vista.  My
company promptly bought an additional XP license and put in a dual boot on
that machine, and I have run Vista around 3 times since then.  Sorry, but
it's just so slow doing the same exact things when compared to the
performance on the XP side.

That was my point.  MS would lose too much traction if the consumer was
given a choice.  Better (for their pocketbooks) to make sure they have none
and HAVE to use Vista.

I'm sure I'll give it a chance on the next computer I build.  I just refuse
to be an early adopter and beta-tester for MS.  I learned my lesson, and
never ever move up into a new OS until at least the first service pack hits
the streets.  But once the DX10 games are hitting the shelves hard, it
should be pretty attractive, and I'm really actually looking forward to
seeing what they can do with the potential behind DX10.

Drivers were an issue, particularly until the retail version of Vista came
out in Jan, but that is the hardware manufacturers fault. Nvidia and
Creative were particularly bad in my experience.

But I can't say I've not *any* bugs in Vista at all. Some things were
missing (i.e WinFS), some things were disappointing in their implementation
(UAC), but everything worked for me. And the x64 version is a boon rather
than bind - in direct contrast to XP x64.

I know a lot of people are waiting for SP1. I dont even think that *it* will
include everything it ought to. But with time running out before XP goes
into Extended Support, we will all be on Vista before long. I remember the
exact same arguments when XP came out; but XP was following Win98/ME which
was a big step up. The appeal of Vista is weakened by the comparative
strength of XP.

I had Vista on my machine back in (I think) March. It came with the machine
so I didn't complain too much. In the end I went back to XP in a space of
around 2 months. My reasons were many and were mostly to to with many of my
apps not working properly, some of the bugs in Vista (Like the file copying
one - when I tried to copy too many files it would hang for a while, white
screen and tell me explorer was being restarted with the copy operation
having not been carried out) and the reduced functionality (Stripped down
defragger, No hotmail in the new email client).

Once I 'downgraded' after having slipstreamed my old XP disk, I was suprised
to find big performance gains in all of my games, including certain
Microsoft ones that claim they run better under Vista. A case in point being
the new 'Acceleration Pack' for MS's FSX flight sim. On their blog site they
claim a 12% increase in framerate under Direct-X10 compared to Direct-X9.
This is ok, until someone asked which Direct-X 9 were they measuring? XP or
Vista? The response was 'Vista' and they conceded that under XP the frame
rates were on par with the Vista Direct-X10 version. To me it seems what
Direct-X10 gives in one hand, Vista takes from the other.

I will not go back to Vista just yet, even though I have an nVidia GTX8800
in my system which is Direct-X10 capable. I might change eventually, but all
the current evidence and my own experiences force me away from that option.

Right now, I'm still using windows 2000 on one machine

True.  XP did turn out to be a big improvement
over 98.  It did take a lot more memory though
(and even more on top if you upgrade the MS apps
too).  And more cpu, if you wanted to new apps
to feel as responsive as the old ones.
But overall it was an improvement; getting the
NT technology into the home consumer market.
Much of the XP worry as I remember was whether
they were going to screw up NT by adding too much
GUI fluffery.

Vista on the other hand, is a very tiny improvement,
coupled with a lot of bigger annoyances.

I only use my home computer for games and Quicken
anyway.  XP is good enough for that.  And I much
prefer the older games that had good stories and
gameplay to the modern ones that seem to be all
about eye candy.  Michael Bay style games (&quot;those
aren't ideas, those are special effects!&quot;, &quot;I don't
understand the difference...&quot;)  Game developers
seem to always be given the top end machines to
develop on, and then create games that only a
few high end players can use.

They're requiring machines that take
more wattage than refrigerators!  If these guys
really need the barely discernable differences
that are in DX10 and stop making DX9 games, then
I'll start playing my older ones more often, and
maybe (gasp) consider getting a console.

This is called progress... There is little point in improving CPUs,
motherboards and gfx cards if we aren't going to use them. And new software
encourages improvements in hardware, and new hardware allows for new
improvements in software. This has always been the case, and will remain so.

Fine. So you clearly have no particular need for Vista - so don't upgrade.
But when you buy your next machine, you'll get Vista and your older, non-eye
candy games will absolutely fly

Now this is very true... For a start, too many people have PSUs that are too
big. The hardware industry populates the myth that if you have a 8-series
gfx card, you'll need dual kilowatt PSUs.... it's nonsense. The vast
majority of people can survive with much smaller PSUs. What is more, for me
noise is a big issue - as is heat dissipation. Although it is slowly
changing, too many hardware manufacturers seem to be increasing the power
draw of their components... in this age of global warming, we should be
heading in the opposite direction. Less power, less heat, less noise, less
cost.

You are correct - contemporary games run faster in general on XP than on
Vista x86. The gap for x64 is less. This is to be expected. Likewise, games
ran faster on 98 than on XP. And faster on Win3.11 than on Win95 etc...

Every new OS is more demanding and taxes our contemporary hardware. Improved
hardware will make Vista fly. Then Vista will be replaced by Windows 7 and
we will be complaining that it does offer enough benefits and that is slows
our 16GB/Quad Core/2TB PCs to an absolute crawl... and thus the cycle will
continue. Mac ownership will be little different, and Linux will more mature
but still will only appeal to enthusiasts.

Security patches for Windows XP will continue while XP is the &quot;Extended
Support&quot; stage.  The only significant difference for end users will
be that Microsoft will be longer distributing retail copies of the OS
and you won't be able to get any sort of free support from Microsoft.
Basically, Windows XP users will become Windows Vista users by attrition
as their old computers with XP die or are retired.

Oh, they'll still be able to get paid support from Microsoft, though it
might cost more.

Well, at least ATI is making some strides...  They are releasing an open
source version of their graphics drivers to the Linux community.  I guess
that's at least one good thing that came about from the AMD acquisition of
ATI - their continued support of Linux.  Guess we'll see if it goes
anywhere.
