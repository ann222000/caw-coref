Shekhinah Mountainwater 1939 - 2007

http://www.wildhunt.org/2007/08/shekhinah-mountainwater-1939-2007.html#links

Jason Pitzl-Waters

Author, musical performer, and key figure in the early Goddess spirituality movement Shekhinah Mountainwater, after a long struggle with uterine cancer, has passed away at the age of 67.

Shekhinah Mountainwater aka Ellen Adler

&quot;She was surrounded by friends and family. On Monday they recalled her impact. They said it was not only in the way she lived her life, but in the way she left it: courageous in the face of pain. Then, finally, peacefully. She was a healer, a tarot reader, a teacher, a singer, a musician, an author, a goddess, a pagan, a witch. &quot;She was dedicated to her work and changing the world,&quot; said son Frey Faust, who followed in his mother's artistic footsteps by becoming a dance teacher. &quot;She was a creative mother, and she was very disciplined as an artist herself. Nature was important to her. Values were important to her. She was never interested in monetary wealth&quot; While thousands of Santa Cruz residents could fit that very descriptibon, what made Mountainwater's life so interesting is that she dedicated her life to empowering women long before it became fashionable. And she never let up.&quot;

While well known on the West coast, the wider community most likely know her from her book &quot;Ariadne's Thread: A Workbook of Goddess Magic&quot;. A book that is considered a classic within the Goddess spirituality movement. In addition, Mountainwater was a pioneer of what we would now call &quot;Pagan music&quot;. She had started folksinging during the American folk music revival of the 1950s and 60s and would tour and do performances with her two children who would dance ecstatically to the music being played. In the mid to late 60s she was approached by a woman who advised her to read Robert Grave's &quot;The White Goddess&quot;. This lead Mountainwater to a religious awakening and a synthesis of her previous endeavors in meditation and spiritual practice.

Shekhinah Mountainwater performing with her children.

&quot;We had no idea that we were invoking the Goddess until we met a very special woman. Sara was a closet poet and a retired school teacher who had literally lost her voice. When she saw us &quot;performing&quot; at the Troubador down in Los Angeles, she said in her whispery croak, &quot;You're the hope of the world!&quot; What on earth did she mean, I wondered. &quot;Read The White Goddess by Robert Graves,&quot; she kept insisting, whenever I asked, in her unforgettable croaking scratchy voice...Graves taught me that all poetry, all theater, began as invocation of the Goddess. In our openness and innocence we had stumbled upon a spiritual practise that had once been the sacred rites of thousands.&quot;

After this awakening, Mountainwater proceeded to lead Goddess-workshops and sing songs in honor of her new-found religion. In the process she inspired several other artists, including Pagan author and performer Ruth Barret, who along with Cyntia Smith released a Goddess-influenced folk album called &quot;Aeolus&quot; in 1981, and &quot;Copperwoman&quot; (Carolyn Saso), who started out doing albums of children's music before switching to Goddess-inspired songs and chants.

According to those by her side at her death-bed, Shekhinah Mountainwater's last words were &quot;It's better now.&quot; May this pioneer find peace and solace in the arms of the Mother.

&quot;The best teachers have shown me that things have to be done bit by bit.
Nothing that means anything happens quickly - we only think it does.&quot;
--Joseph Bruchac, ABENAKI
There are no short cuts. Every tree must grow according to the growth plan
of the Creator. Every flower must grow according to the plan of God. The
moon must make its trip around the earth according to God's plan. Every
human being must grow according to the plan of the Creator. Sometimes we
look at ourselves and we think we are not growing but we are always growing.
Because we cannot see it with our mind does not mean it is not happening. We
must be patient with ourselves and let the Creator direct our growth.

My Creator, let me be patient. Let me realize that You are in charge of all things. Let me realize that I must grow my roots a little at a time to become strong. Back to top Reply to sender | Reply to group | Reply via web post

From
The Good Spell Book, Love Charms, Magickal Cures and Other Practical Sorcery
By Gillian Kemp

Pets are tuned into their owners and can respond to an invisible call.
Place some food and water in your pets bowls.
Light a blue candle next to the bowls and say:
My fair beauty gone astray
Please come back to me today.
With my yearning heart and wonder,
Please come back to me from yonder.
Leave the candle to burn down or pinch out the flame when pet returns.

Blessings!!

What you need:
1 cup of soil
1 cup of salt
1 white taper candle
1 bottle
1 stick pin
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon of dill seeds
1 tablespoon of fennel seeds
1 carnelian stone
Put half a cup of dirt into the bottom of the bottle.
Add half a cup of salt on top of that (to make layers).
Next add the bay leaf and the dill and fennel seeds.
Put half a cup of salt on top of this and half a cup of dirt on top of the salt.
Drop the carnelian stone on top of everything.
Use a stick pin to carve the word &quot;Protect __pets name here__&quot; in the taper candle stick.
Fit candle into the top of the bottle. If the taper is too big wedge it in (by circling it)
Until it stays securely by itself.
Burn the candle when convenient. You don't have to burn it all down at once,
But eventually the candle will burn itself out (you could maybe burn it once a week or so).
When the candle will not stay lit any longer, put the spell bottle near the place your
Pet spends most of his or her time.
From SPELL CRAFTS by Scott Cunningham

Blessings!!

Light Sandalwood incense, a white candle and a red candle, and greet the
Lord and Lady by saying:
&quot;I come to you now to release
This pain and all emotional beasts
That plague my heart so heavily -
Take them from me - set me free!&quot;
Take a flower and name it for your pet. Holding it in your hand, stroke the
Petals and speak to your pet with love and honesty. If euthanasia was a
Factor, explain your reasons for terminating his/her life cycle. If not,
This is a good time to talk to your pet about the loneliness you feel
Without him/her. Place the flower on the altar and lay the rose quartz on
Top of it. Tell you pet that the stone will always represent him/her to
You, and explain that she or he is free to go to the Summerland for
Re-birthing. Say:
&quot;You're free to go now, little one,
Rejoice and play - the time has come
For your spirit to be on its way.
Have fun, be happy - your love will stay!&quot;
Meditate on the spirit of your pet moving on, then place a drop of vinegar
On your tongue to represent the sourness we feel when death takes a loved
One. Take some time to grieve for what might have been. Scream, cry, yell,
Whatever you need to do, to get it out of your system. When you can cry no
More, taste some honey. Rejoice and celebrate the relationship you had
With your pet. Remember all the good times you had, the love you shared,
And the special spot the pet filled in your life. Extinguish the candles
And thanks the Lord and Lady for their comforting presence. Release the
Flower into a body of water, such as a river or stream. Wish it a fond
Farewell as it floats away. Keep the stone close to you or put it in a safe
Place.

Blessings!!

This spell is best performed on a Saturday, the day of Saturn which is associated with contraction and thus protection. Find a quiet place where you will not have any disturbances for at least 20 minutes. First, set three white candles in the center of your table or altar. If you are doing this working to protect someone other than yourself, place a picture of him/her or write their name on a piece of paper and place it with the candles. Place a protection talisman in front of the candles. Anoint the three candles from top to bottom with Protection Oil. Light the first candle while you say, &quot;Spirits of Protection, surround me and my home with light and love. Let none who wish me harm penetrate this sphere of light. Protect me and those I love from harm, so mote it be.&quot; Light the second candle and repeat your invocation. Pause for a few moments and picture yourself or your loved one surrounded by a sphere of light. Repeat both steps with the third candle. While your candles are burning, using quill, ink and parchment to write down what you need protection for (you should think about this before you begin your spell work). Next, light some charcoal and place it in an incense burner or heat safe dish, put a pinch of Protection incense on the charcoal. Take your piece of parchment and waft it through the smoke of the incense while you chant the original invocation, &quot;Spirits of Protection, surround me and my home with light and love. Let none who wish me harm penetrate this sphere of light. Protect me and those I love from harm, so mote it be.&quot; Fold you parchment up into a small square and place in along with the herbs and a stone with protection properties into a mojo bag. You can carry the mojo bag with you wherever you go, or you may simply place it under your pillow. Finally, you will let your candles burn all the way out while you meditate on the sphere of protective light surrounding you or your loved one. Once your candles are done burning, your Protection Talisman will be charged and ready for you to wear or place under your pillow with your mojo bag. You may repeat this spell whenever you want to recharge it. Sometimes you will see immediate results, sometimes it can take up to two lunar cycles before you see results. The universe works in mysterious ways and assistance will be provided to you in ways you may never have expected. Once you see results from your spell work, always thank the universe for the assistance provided.

Ritual, Life and Everything
New Worlds Isse: NW065
By: Amber K and Azrael Arynn K

Some of the best moments of our lives have been spent with unusual people, in strange places, doing odd things. The unusual people have included Witches, magick workers, Druids, sacred clowns, Fairies, Elemental Spirits, plant devas, animal allies, and ancient gods and goddesses of a dozen distant lands.

The strange places? High in the gnarled limbs of a huge old willow tree, under a full moon. Deep under the earth, crawling through dark, narrow, twisted tunnels. Dancing around a blazing 40-foot bonfire while a hundred drums thundered in unison. In a candlelit Temple of Isis, hidden underground in a modern American city.

The odd things we do? Rituals. Oh, we enjoy classes and parties and potluck dinners and other things, but it always comes back to ritual: ritual to celebrate holy days that we could scarcely pronounce; ritual to heal illnesses that confounded medical experts; ritual to break long droughts and bring life-giving torrents of rain; ritual to banish confusion, anger and fear and draw forth clarity, compassion and courage; rituals to mark the great passages of life and death, from birth celebrations to memorial rites.

We do ritual because the human heart and soul need ritual. But like many other things we need for health and wholeness, (such as occasional solitude, extended family, harmony with nature), ritual is an endangered activity in Western (un)civilization.

Our culture is ritual-poor. We have no real rituals for young people coming of age, for respected adults becoming elders, for ancestors who should be remembered and honored. Because of this, we lose clarity and respect among the generations, we sever our ties with our heritage, we let ill-prepared man-children and women-children wander uncertainly toward the future. The few rituals we do have as a society, like the sheet cakes and jello served afterwards, are pallid and unsatisfying. High school graduation ceremonies, baby showers and birthday parties cannot sustain a culture.

But ritual doesn’t have to be like that. We have known rituals that were exciting, mysterious, scary, intriguing, ethereally beautiful, boisterous, sweaty, cathartic, awe-filled, regenerating, painfully transformative, outrageous, breathtaking, ecstatic, overwhelming, hilarious, wild, deep, primal and weird. We know it can be done. We have done it. We have created a dragon elemental under mountain skies as lightning cracked overhead. We have splashed and poured water on one another and watched the skies open to release the rain. We have weighed the soul of a departed brother against a white feather, on the Scales of Ma’at, and released him to the Sun God. We have laughed and cried and shouted for joy, and been transformed, and we know what ritual can do.

So we wrote a book. It seems to be part of what the Goddess wants from us, part of a teaching-sharing-learning calling. We wrote RitualCraft to let people know that this ancient and poorly understood tool — ritual — could be exhilarating and splendid, could change lives, could even help change the world.

We had the stuff of a book. Between us, we have over 40 years of experience with ritual. We had our memories of the best (and worst) rituals we had ever been part of. We had our personal files, with outlines and notes and ideas. We had wonderful input from our students, from teaching many workshops on ritual. We had access through friends and the Internet to rituals around the world — so we could include ceremonies from Africa and the Middle East and the Far North, and much more.

Now, there are already some fine books on ritual out there. But many are very short, or focused on solitary rituals, or just sabbats, or only rites of passage, or just one tradition’s perspective.

We wanted something more comprehensive, both broader and deeper. We wanted to cover the pitfalls as well as the possibilities. And we wanted to encourage you to be creative and daring, to stretch the boundaries, to dump the cookie-cutter, read-from-the-book type rituals and spread your wings. So we did it; we shared all that we could cram into 600 pages or so. And the book has a lot — theory and sensory modes and mental states and very diverse rituals from all over to illustrate the insights. Altars and costumes and chants, oh my.

We wrote RitualCraft because our communities need great rituals for bonding, for healing, for transforming what we do and who we are as a society. Beyond that, ritual is a tremendous tool for self-transformation. Choosing to mold yourself, to create a better you, is the greatest art there is because its raw material is a living person. And beyond all the safe and common tools, the self-improvement books, adult evening classes and exercise programs, there is ritual. There is magick.

Blessings!!

Messages in this topic (1) 15. White, grey or black Posted by: &quot;Stevie Nicks Fan&quot; wayofthewitch@comcast.net wannabelikestevienicks Thu Aug 16, 2007 8:39 pm (PST) White, grey or black
In the media, on TV shows and in some other places we see talk of black witches, white witches and even on occasion sometimes grey witches.

Although this concept does not really fit within the traditions of traditional witchcraft, we felt it might be helpful to try here to explain both what people mean by these terms and how it effects there beliefs.

White witches, usually Wiccan's have similar beliefs to traditional witches, but perhaps in classifying themselves as white witches seek to correct things, charge the world, society, or do what they consider to be good. Most white witches have an external god or goddess that they serve. Similar to other religions they may get a feel good factor by being the servants of the godd(ess), and even start to feel that they speak for this power and can interpret the message to society.

To fully understand this you would also need to consider 'role sets', or how one relates to a situation wearing different hats. Perhaps one of the easiest examples is the girl with a boyfriend, and how sex is viewed by different people she is involved with, most boyfriends will consider it a part of a healthy relationship, her mother may like to think of her daughter as a virgin and not want to acknowledge she is growing up, while her father may not like the idea of any guy taking advantage of her, but at the same time may dream about a night with one of his daughters friends. So what is good and bad, and can she be good in the eyes of everyone.

Similarly the police officer who is carrying on a war on crime may hide evidence of use to the defense, overlook other clues that do not fit the target he has, and believe this is in the public interest, while the person wrongly locked up in a prison for years and his family may just see a corrupt police officer, interested in promotion, or just too lazy or stupid to see the truth. can a person therefore be trying to do good in too blinkered a way actually do a great deal of harm, in the same way that some police officers are a greater threat to society than those they try to protect people against.

In other religions the drive to convert, to make people confirm to their interpretation can result in self justification for murder, terrorism and oppressing peoples rights and freedoms.

Black witches, are individuals who believe that all magic and power comes completely from within them, they usually have no god or goddess, and where they do it is a power they can summon up and expect to perform according to their will. they believe that they have the divine right to use this power to reward or punish those they come into contact with. Some times people will have started off in a white witch area, not been impressed with the effects and then due to a problem, being harmed or threatened by someone that they should use their power to harm or bring justice. Some groups likewise can become tribal, and consider looking after its members interests involves perhaps harming others. Few if any of these people have any concept of a Christian or Jewish devil character, and as they seek to control magic from themselves would not seek to serve any god.

On occasions young people will be attracted to black magic, the need for power, to balance up injustices they are suffering, to survive bullying, to get over other problems, or just to get another handle on a world they are not enjoying being a part of.

Some people who have developed mental illness have along the way, sought comfort from black magic or black witchcraft, that is not to say that this caused them to have a mental problem but that perhaps it did not eventually offer them the solution they were looking for. Some of these people rather than getting medical help may seek out other beliefs with very fixed codes, or rituals, and may then even become anti witch, or persecutors of anyone involved in the craft.

Grey witches are rare, they tend to be white witches that have perhaps a feeling that some retribution is allowed, or that some reward is due to them for being one of the supporters.

Blessings!!

Messages in this topic (1) 16a. Dragons Posted by: &quot;Stevie Nicks Fan&quot; wayofthewitch@comcast.net wannabelikestevienicks Thu Aug 16, 2007 8:39 pm (PST) Dragons have existed in the human psyche as long as there has been such a thing as human psyche. The most ancient human cultures had stories about Dragons, all the way back to ancient India, Africa, The Far East and even the early people of the Americas. Scientists theorize that the reason that Dragons make an appearance on all the major continents is that the Dragon is a composite of predators that ancient people feared. Theory says that the Dragon is made up of components of the leopard, eagle and snake, any one of which could spell trouble for a human caught unaware. Stories were created as warning to avoid the danger of these creatures, and eventually the Dragon emerged from the stories as a single beast all its own.

Each group of ancient people described their Dragon in their own way. Chinese Dragons are often more serpent like and are rulers of weather and water. Japanese Dragons were often benevolent and might have occasionally granted wishes. Scandinavian and Germanic Dragons may or may not have had wings or even legs and often symbolized pestilence and stole cattle to eat, yet were considered good luck. Slavic and Romanian Dragons both had multiple heads, but the Slavic breathed fire and the Romanian had fins. The feathered serpent of the Americas was a symbol of death and resurrection. Both Persian and Oriental Dragons were involved in the Creation Myths of those peoples. In Sumerian myth, the body of a Dragon was used to create the very world itself. In Australian Aboriginal myths the Rainbow Serpent was both feared and respected as it was associated with the creation of water holes and river courses, very important to people living in the arid outback. In Greek Mythology, Dragons were often guardians of treasure of some kind.

Now in modern times Dragons capture the imagination, becoming part of popular games and movies and even music.

But what does the Dragon symbolize for you?

Is it good luck, as it was to some ancients? Is it creativity or wishes coming true or resurrection of dreams? Perhaps it is something you haven't even thought of yet.

Discover your Dragon with a simple meditation. Anoint a white candle with several drops of Dragon's Blood oil and light it. Sit comfortably, let yourself relax. Take a few minutes to breathe deeply, allowing all the tension of the day to ease away. Allow your thoughts to wander just a bit as you relax, letting them flow and letting go of them, concentrate on breathing, on the feeling as each part of you relaxes, as your thoughts calm and center, watching the flame of your candle. When you are feeling relaxed and ready to explore inwardly, let your eyes close and imagine yourself in a safe, peaceful place. Invite your Dragon Companion to visit with you. You might see a colour, a gemstone, feel an element like rain or wind, hear musical notes or even lyrics or poetry, perhaps you will detect a scent of some kind to give you a clue as to what your Dragon is about. You may even see in your mind the image of that inner Dragon you have invited to teach you or guide you. Now is the time to ask what wisdom they are here to share. Explore your inner landscape now, let the knowledge within you come forward, listen to what your psyche is showing you in symbols and with this Dragon.

When you have finished your visit and exploration, thank that Dragon, your inner self, for sharing this information with you. Concentrate on breathing deeply, feeling that calm fill you, know that you can take that relaxation out of the meditation with you. Open your eyes and watch your candle flame for a bit before resuming your usual day.

Don't worry if it takes some practice to connect with this guiding energy. But don't be surprised either if your inner thoughts spring at the chance to be known as well.

Don’t forget to have some paper and a pen nearby so that when you are done with your meditation you can write down the experiences you had. You might want to keep a Dragon Journal to track your progress as you explore with the Dragon.

Dragon Luck to you in your journey!

Messages in this topic (25) 17a. Lessons You May Not Find In Books Posted by: &quot;Heidi Jaye&quot; paganprincezz@gmail.com kookaburradezigns Thu Aug 16, 2007 8:39 pm (PST) Lessons You May Not Find In Books

Author Unknown

1. Within a Circle trust is an absolute necessity.
If you attend a ritual be SURE you trust those involved. Many feel
this, in todays society to be archaic. It has always proved out I
when I have tried to work with unknown people, those I was unsure of
or who were in some way unsure of me, failure, disaster or heated
debate resulting in dissent has always been the end point. Know a
person before you are willing to enter sacred space with them.

2. Never spellcast too soon.
Magick should not be a first resort. The use of non-magickal means
should be applied when possible and convient. Overuse of magick, like
anything else, becomes a crutch that can unbalance you life.

3. Prophecy is a two-edge sword.
Remember this, whether you read Tarot, I-Ching, Runes or whatever,
other means of divination or personal analysis. Be prepared to have
the reading go in directions you do not expect and be prepared for
them NOT to be in a way you will like. Remember the Lesson of
Cassandra (in Greek Mythology) that sometimes you can change the
future and sometimes you cannot, and only time will tell which is
which. If you cannot deal with the possibility of your personal wants
or expectations being wrong, then you should not be consulting a
means of divination. I have seen even long-time craft-folk who forget
this lesson in the heat of emotion.

4. There is not a magickal answer behind everything.
I have known some folks who became so obsessed in their personal
paranoia of some form of &quot;magickal attack&quot; or &quot;magickal influence&quot;
that such became their excuse for everything that occurred around
them, even when very simple non-magickal answers existed to explain
what had occurred. The number of magickal practitioners at present is
VERY small and most have a range of influence that does not extend
far or their own. The gathering of hateful or vindictive emotional
energy to achieve a magical attack on another is not done easily or
quickly, and tends to harm the attacker more often then the target.
Look with logic on a situation.

5. Diversify.
Don't depend on or look into only a single philosophy or magical
application - a specialist is usually someone who is refusing to grow
beyond boundaries they have set for themselves.

6. A single teacher is NOT enough.
You will spend a lifetime as a real student, even if others one day
declare you a teacher, leader or High Priestess. Gather from many to
find what your lifepath is. Do not let anyone tell you there is ONLY
one true belief system, one true Divinity, one way to approach a
situation or one teacher to follow.

7. In the end you ARE Solitary.
All Magickal workers are eventually forced to depend upon their own
company, separated from the many communities and groups by distance,
time or belief. You will probably spend more time solitary then in a
group. Be prepared to face this when it happens. The Pagan Community
is too small to be everywhere for everyone or to even always help its
own (though trying to do so is a goal I feel vital to expand the
community). You must become sufficiently balanced and grounded to
deal with being alone and to practice your beliefs alone, especially
in times of hardship and adversity.

8. Don't be too fast to assume the role of a teacher, or to assume
that a student cannot teach you something in return.
Can you really explain what you believe and do within your belief
coherently? Does the person to be taught really want to learn it all
and are they sincere, or are they merely curious or on a 'power
trip'? Learning to know when someone is ready to learn is one of the
hardest lessons you must learn if you purposely teach. Don't give a
hand grenade to a three year old and expect positive results.

9. Not all paths and philosophies are desirable.
There are many that are self-destructive, purely self-indulgent or a
combination of both. If a path cannot teach you some form of inner
peace with yourself and what you are doing in life, or is devoted to
manipulating others to achieve your personal benefits, then it is
a 'dead-end path', one that is a cul-de-sac on the path of growth.

10. Don't do what feels uncomfortable.
If performing a ritual, using a magic form, reciting a chant/prayer
or performing an activity feels personally painful, uncomfortable
or 'wrong' then it is not for you to be involved with it at that
time. Listen to the inner voice of your spirit and follow its lead.
Intuition is a powerful gift, don't waste it by always opposing it.

11. You will have to take chances.
Magic doesn't work on its own, and positive karma won't help you if
you fight it when it seeks to restore balance around you. It is not
enough to cast a prosperity spell and then sit home and wait for a
letter in the mail from Ed McMahon with a check in it! You must take
non-magical action to help things along. Cast a spell for a new job?
Sure, but then don't turn down a chance to read job listings, mail
resumes or attend an interview! Working to heal a sick spouse? ok,
but make sure they are getting medical advice, enough to eat,
attention, care, therapy, etc. to help the magic on its way!

Messages in this topic (2) 18. voodoo Posted by: &quot;Stevie Nicks Fan&quot; wayofthewitch@comcast.net wannabelikestevienicks Thu Aug 16, 2007 8:39 pm (PST) © Copyright 2002 Fran Carey

A dark mystery from the Dark Continent, the word “voodoo” alone evokes frissons of terror, nurtured by decades of exploitation in pulp fiction and B-movies. A mixture of tradition and forced change, the religion has remained hidden, a secrecy necessary for its survival through centuries of persecution. But the old gods sleep no longer. They have begun to reveal themselves to people outside their traditional followers. Eleggua, Damballah, Ezili, Baron Samedi, the faces of African religion in America, the gods and goddesses of Voodoo.

Most people know only one face of the religion, its spell-work, more technically called Hoodoo. Voodoo, or more correctly, Voudoun, is an earth religion, in many ways similar to such more widely known traditions as Wicca and shamanism.

Voudoun is a syncrestic religion, a blend of many African religions which came together in the New World when their practitioners were forcibly migrated here as part of the slave trade. These ancestral religions include those of the Fon, the Nago, the Ibos, Dahomeans, Congos, Senegalese, Haussars, Caplaous, Mondungues, Mandinge, Angolese, Libyans, Ethiopians, and the Malgaches. Relationships with the also-conquered Caribe Indians lead to absorption of that group’s lore and some of their beliefs.

In an effort to stop this banding together of the groups, and to weaken the strength their religion gave them, the French rulers of Haiti, the birth land of Voudoun as we know it, prohibited all African religious practices. This lead to the final syncretism of the religion, when it blended with the Catholicism of the ruling Europeans.

Voudoun is one of the most politically visible earth religions. In their fight for independence, Haitians, a blended people of Native Caribbean and African origin, appealed to their gods and actively made sacrifices to them to aid in their fight. They also turned the spell-working aspect against the French government officials, instilling fear and worse when forced to do so. In 1804, their independence was finally won.

But the use of Voudoun in the political arena didn’t end. As late as the Twentieth Century, it was used by Papa Doc Duvalier and his strong-arm security forces, the Ton-ton Macoute, to enforce obedience to his oppressive rule. This is a part of the story in the movie The Serpent and the Rainbow, a drama loosely based on the true experiences of ethno-botanist Wade Davis.

This is far from the religion’s only experience in celluloid. Hollywood’s version, based on the most shocking manifestations and a lot of creative license, has appeared in the company of James Bond (Live and Let Die), Bela Lugosi (Voodoo Man), and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

And it’s taken quite seriously, in its spell-work aspect, by the law, even in the United States. In New Orleans, it’s still illegal to kill someone by the use of magic.

But to only see this is to only see one side of the coin. The other side is a very life-affirming, positive relationship with the gods. A relationship that, by its very form, frightens our “civilized” sensibilities. Because, when the gods come, they come into the bodies of their worshippers, “riding” them, temporarily taking over the business of running the body. To the Voudoun practitioner, this is not a frightening experience, but a desirable one. It is sought by use of shamanic trance induction methods, including music and dance. The person being ridden attains an ecstatic state, in full communion with the “Loa”, the deity.

There are many Loa. New ones are born and old ones pass away as new challenges and opportunities appear to the practitioners. In this way, this is a dynamic religion with horizons not open to practitioners of many, more mainstream, faiths. As in other earth religions, the Loa are the anthropomorphic faces of natural phenomena, and the “keepers” necessary for this type of pantheon.

The celebrant must first approach Eleggua, also known as Legba, the Gatekeeper. Legba is a child-like deity, delighting in child-like offerings. Bring him candy, bright, shiny coins, and, his adult vice, good cigars. If he is pleased, he will allow your passage to the gods.

They include Damballah, the serpent god, often symbolized in the temple by a boa or python. His day is Thursday, his color white, his domain springs, lakes and ponds. He is a protector of these, and of his devotees.

Ezili or Ezuli is the best known of the goddesses. Her days are Tuesday and Thursday, and she is the goddess of love, especially sexual trysts, and feminine beauty.

Ayida-Wedo is the goddess of rain and the rainbow. Alivodu is the guardian of the house. He is invoked to heal illness. Shango is the god of war. Papa Zaka rules agriculture.

One of the most feared of the gods is Baron Samedi, the chief of the gods of the dead. He is depicted as a dignified man in an undertaker’s suit, with a white skull face, a top hat, and a cane.

The gods are divided into families. The Rada, or Sun, family represent the benign, helpful aspects of the powers beyond. The Petro are their opposites.

Each Loa has his or her symbol, or “veve”. It is a take on this device that is usually shown as the “Voodoo marking” in Hollywood, as in Steven Seagal’s Marked for Death. The Rada family has their veves, also, so one cannot assume that all such markings are evil or signs thereof.

The priests and priestesses of the religion are known as Hougans, or Root-men, and Mambos, or Mama-loas, women of the gods. They serve much as do the priests and priestesses of other, more demystified, religions, taking the prayers of the people to the gods and overseeing the organized worship opportunities, marrying and burying, and teaching and counseling.

While animal sacrifice is a part of the religion, it must be seen in the context of Old Testament Hebrew or other traditional religions, in which the animal is a gift to the gods, food for them as bread is food for us. (Compare Christian communion, in which the god is offered to the people.)

There are several other African syncretic religions in the New World. These include Santeria, Cadomble and Palo Mayombe. The latter two are seen by some as off-shoots of Voudoun, and by others as totally separate children of the same ancestors.

Voudoun is currently practiced in the Caribbean, and in major cities and small towns throughout the United States. It is most visible in areas with significant immigrant Haitian populations, but is an ancestral religion in many other areas, alive and well, if underground. Like other earth religions, it is undergoing a ...
