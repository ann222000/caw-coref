He [Norm] entered father's store with a light heart, spoke
to the clerks, and went to the private office to seek his
father.  As he entered the door, the smile faded from his
lips, and his face became ashy white.  The scene before him
froze the blood in his veins, and made him speechless with
horror.

His father and a customer were sitting together, each
drinking a glass of wine.  Standing a little aloof was Mr.
Pugh, holding in his hand a glass into which he was pouring
the crimson poison.

He was in the act of raising it to his lips, when with a
sudden movement, Norman darted forward.  Quick as a flash,
before it reached his lips, the glass was dashed to the
ground and broke to shivers.

&quot;Oh!&quot; Norman said, with quivering lips, &quot;I had heard such
good accounts of you!&quot;

&quot;And true ones, Mr. Brill.&quot;

&quot;Yet you drink this?&quot;

&quot;You came in time to keep me from it.&quot;

Mr. Brill looked up quickly, and exclaimed:

&quot;My son, I am glad to see you home again;&quot; while Mr. Pugh
turned abruptly away; not, however, until Norman had
obtained a promise that he would not leave the store
until he saw him.  As the door closed behind him, Mr.
Brill said:

&quot;You have startled us, my son.  What does this strange
conduct mean?&quot;

&quot;Oh! father, how could you?&quot;  Norman threw himself into a
chair, covered his face with his hands, and groaned aloud.

&quot;Norman, you alarm me!  Your words are a inexplicable as
your conduct.  Tell me what they mean?&quot;

&quot;You have heard me speak of Mr. Pugh, father, how he sunk
into the depths of degradation and poverty through the use
of strong drink; and of our efforts to snatch him from
evil?&quot;

&quot;I have, Norman; but what has that to do with the present
scene?&quot;

&quot;Now, after months of abstinence, when we had begun to
hope so much, you overturn all by giving him wine to
drink.  Thank God, I came before he tasted it!  I shudder
to think of what the consequences might have been, had I
come a moment later.&quot;
