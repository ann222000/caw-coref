Holi is a festival of joy and colors. However, one should always be on
alert to prevent any accident that may mar all the fun and change the scene
to a sad one. Here are some Dos and Don'ts that are necessary to really
enjoy Holi to its fullest. Remember to use these precautions to enjoy the
festival of Holi safely.

Holi is meant to be a rough festival with tradition of applying colors to
the guests and friends with or without their consent. Any kind of rudeness
is totaly forgiven on this day but these kinds of fun should also be
participated under a certain limits. Fun, food and colors is all that should
spread on this holy day of Holi. You should always remember to use these
small precautions so that no one that you know or love gets hurt
unknowingly.

- Dental caps are a good idea to protect you teeth from staining.

- Sunglasses go a long way in keeping your eyes safe from the harmful
chemicals of the colors.

- Wear old and ragged clothes that you can easily discard while
playing Holi as your clothes may never look wearable again with all those
color stains.

- Wear full-sleeved t-shirts or shirts and leggings that cover your
legs fully. Socks will be a good idea too.

- Brightly colored and dark colored clothes are preferable for the
mood of the day.

- Granted that it is almost impossible to save you face from attack of
colors, so while being attacked, keep eyes and lips tightly closed.

- If you are playing Holi, apply a thick layer of coconut or any oil
on your body and hair till they glisten and you become slippery.

- This will not only help in escaping from the frenzied mob attack but
also will help you to wash off colors easily later on.

- While washing off the color, use lukewarm water and keep your eyes
and lips tightly closed.

- If you are traveling, keep the car windows tightly shut. Better
still; avoid traveling on Dhuledi, the day of playing colors.

Have a happy &amp; safe Holi !!!!!!!!!
