In a way, it's a win win.
Either the defendant is &quot;proved&quot; to be at fault, in which case it
would tend to hurt their standing in the community and have all them
penalties etc..
Or they didn't do it, which flies in the face of standard ID doctrine.

Well, read the details about the case this lawsuit is a protest about: a
woman plaintiff was not allowed to use the words &quot;rape&quot; or &quot;victim&quot; in a
sexual assault trial. She sued the judge, and Our Hero thinks that suit
is frivolous.

Then the judge can either rule that there is no defendent, i.e. god
doesn't exist, or there *is* a defendent, and issue a default
judgement. The senator can then file a specific list of damages
and appropriate monetary value, then request an auction of all
property owned by the defendent and located within the state, to
cover those damages, which will be quite a lot of fun.

There's no need to personally serve the defendant. Serving a lawyer
or other legal representative of the defendent is sufficient. Find
any evangalist who claims to represent god, and serve him. Have
several witnesses both to claims of representation and the act of
service.

If nobody is willing to admit they represent god, then find a large
pool of evangalists who claim they talk to god, and get a court
order that each of them tell god about the court summons. Lock them
all up until one of them claims that he in fact delivered the
message.

Or rely on the well known &quot;fact&quot; that god is omniscient, knows
everything that happens, including a person standing outside the
courthouse yelling HEAR YE HEAR YE followed by the text of the
summons.

Nit: A default judgment would not require the judge to address the
reality of God. The &quot;charges&quot; would simply go unrefuted and would be
judged accordingly. It happens all the time. Of course it will never get
that far for a multitude of other (more sane) reasons.

Right! If anybody can get out of jury duty, it would be a deity.

How about swearing in a witness? &quot;Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you the Defendant?&quot;

Of course it is a proof that God exists if successful.  Doesn't even
have to get into court.  He can't be sued unless he is served with
papers.  Service complete = God exists.

What makes you think that would be a problem?
He's nothing but a myth, and there are hundreds of mythological gods around,
as well as a whole bunch of psychotic people claiming they personally are god,
and people claiming they can channel him or otherwise speak his words.

To avoid that embarrassment, I doubt anyone claiming to represent him
would make that demand. The real problem would be an impartial judge.
Maybe James Randi could be appointed as a special prosecutor for this case?
I'm sure he'd stick to the facts: Defendent has been legally served
through a representative, defendent fails to file any contest to
the charges, default judgement rendered, court is now in recess.

It's going nowhere. The senator claims that you can sue &quot;anybody.&quot;
There is no evidence that this god character is a corporate entity,
nor is it a body politic and therefor, does not qualify as &quot;anybody.&quot;
The only thing I can surmise from the article is that I don't want
this guy interpreting the Constitution where I'm concerned. His
equation of appropriateness seems to be that because a plaintiff filed
suit against a federal judge he is justified in filing a suit against
&quot;god&quot; and that his action neccessitates a remedy which is to limit
constitutional provisions for access to justice. It's entirely
illogical, ridiculous even. The only good that might come of it is a
new defintion of what it means to be nonexistent: A persistent and
enduring lack of response to a judicial notice to appear.
