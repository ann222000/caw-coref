I never got an answer to the part of my question is was really interested
in, so I'm asking again with just one question in the post.

Has anyone ever seen any stats on the probability of second shot
incapacitation with typical defense pistol calibers? All common calibers
seem to be clustered around 95% first shot. Does that second shot neutralize
100%, or 99.9% or what. I know you keep shooting until the threat goes
away-- just wondering if that usually means two shots. I know there are
recorded cases of people absorbing five or more shots, but they have mostly
been .38 Special or weaker calibers.

There is a reason that standard practice is &quot;double tap&quot; (two shots).
Unfortunately, I'm not that good at that yet. Takes me at least a full
one to two seconds to re-aquire my target and pull the trigger after
recoil and aim with any accuracy.

Many LEO's that I see doing holster practice at the range do a triple
tap. Two to center mass, one to the head.

I think it is difficult to evaluate multiple shot stops because it is
hard to tell which hit is the fight stopper and/or which was the first
or second hit.

Every competant instructor that I know of  teaches to keep shooting
until the target goes down and makes it a point to warn against firing
2 shots then stopping to asess.
To put it another way, 2 shots is the minumum that should be fired but
if the threat is still there, (still in your sights) you should be
firing until the threat goes away (drops to the ground, drops the
weapon, stops attacking, etc.). When you train, don't always train
with 2 shot strings. Spend some time with 3, 4 and 5 shot strings so
you don't create the expectation of 2 shots and then you stop.

Below is my standard sermon re. pistol stopping power.

Think of your pistol as a long distance hand drill. 9mm drill bits
will drill 9mm holes. .45 drill bits will drill .45 holes.
At pistol velocities that is about all the performance we can be
absolutely sure of getting out of our pistols.

Now, there are 3 ways to stop an attacker quickly,
1. Disrupt his Central Nervous System with hits to the brain or spine;
those are very hard targets to hit.
2. Drop his blood pressure so far and fast that he quickly loses
consciousness. Multiple hits to the heart and or the large blood
vessels around the heart.
3. The attacker makes a psychological decision to stop attacking, this
is not under our control and is the most unreliable.

So, #2 above seems to be the most reliable method given our long
distance drill tool.
Therefore, we want a long distance drill that will,
1. Work every time.
2. Drill deep enough to poke holes and let the fluid out.
3. Is something that we can control well enough to drill multiple
holes quickly in a 6&quot; diameter circle at 10 yards or so.

So our requirements for ammo in our long distance drill are,
#1 Reliability. Must function every single time.
#2 Must be able to drill holes deep enough to let out the fluids.
#3 Must be something we can control well enough to get multiple hits
on the target, a 6&quot; upper chest area.

Everything after that is gravy.

Hi Me,

Everything you ask is dependent upon shot placement.

Good shot placement = less bullets fired (theoretically).

Your rule:&quot;...keep shooting until the threat goes away&quot; takes into
account discrepancies in shot placement.
Your rule says: Measure your success by &quot;making the threat go away&quot;,
not by how many times you have to shoot.
Not a bad rule.

As a shooter, you don't know whether your going to have to shoot just
1 time or 15 times to &quot;make threat go away.&quot;
As a shooter, you choose a weapon with the capacity to &quot;make the
threat go away&quot; with the above in mind.

Any speculation regarding the number of shots it will take to &quot;make
the threat go away&quot; is just that- speculation.  There are so many
factors that need to be accounted for, the results would be about
meaningless.

Yes I have seen stats. Don't know if they are just as worthless as all
the other stats on One shot stop or even more worthless but I have seen
some. Thinking back to an article or two discussing about half a dozen
different stopping power studies and formulas.

It depends where you hit the  person.
This is why I use either a .22LR or my .32 ACP.
I can hit anywhere I point with these and get of an instant
follow up shot. The guns are a Ruger Mark II and a Walther PPK.
Because of the modest recoil, a follow up shot, even by a novice like
me, is quick and on target. I can not say that for my heavy .45 Colt loads.
The recoil of these is enough that you need a second to gain the sight
picture again and take a follow up shot. Ditto for the .44 mag. But,
unless you just graze the guy with the .45 or .44, he is going down
hard. The .45 Colt (loaded to the high pressures for a Ruger or
Thompson) and the .44 Mag seem to be good hard hitting rounds that won't
have so much recoil that you don't feel like shooting a box of 50 for
practice. And practice you must if you ever hope to be able to shoot
fast and accurate with any pistol. If you even flinch a tiny bit, the
bullet is going off into the twilight zone. So you need a gun big enough
to get the job done but not so darn big that it causes you to flinch  or
to not want  to take it to the range and fire off 50 - 100 practice
rounds. There are very few pistols in the real world, that the average
person is comfortable shooting, that will outperform the 44 mag or a
heavy .45  Colt load.
I have friends that are police officers and they tell me that
people on certain drugs are hard to stop. It is amazing how resilient
they can be. Such a person, if hit in a non vital area, may not go down
right away even with 5 or 6 rounds in him. But, if hit correctly in the
head or heart, even a .22lr will stop him in about one stride. What the
police officer told me is that most people, even cops, when confronted
with a situation, tend to shoot a little more 'wild' then they normally
would at the range. He said it is not at all uncommon for even a police
officer to miss almost every shot as he or she empties the magazine on
their sidearm. So it is all about shot placement. Just because you have
the super-duper-ultra-big-boy magnum does not insure that you will be
able to stop an attacker if you have trouble hitting the broad side of a
barn with the thing due to recoil anticipation flinching. The big
calibers have more stopping power. That's a Uh Duh!. The other variable
is can you put that stopping power on target or would you be better
served with a lighter caliber that you can handle.

Indeed.
I know a former police chief who recounted to me in great detail how a
guy took a .22lr and, in an attempt at suicide, bounced a whole magazine
of slugs off his skull, which proceeded to zip along under the skin of
his scalp.
He survived, albeit his head swelled up pretty badly the next day, but
he still healed up okay.
Also, one factor overlooked all too often is the elasticity of some
internal organs, particularly the heart.
There are multiple accounts of people struck perfectly in the boiler
room who managed to either survive long enough to do more harm (hello,
Michael Platt in the Miami FBI shootout) and die minutes later, or who
survive after a trip to the hospital.
A seriously underpowered caliber that leaves a tiny hole is by far more
likely to allow a heart shot to be less than immediately lethal, whereas
a larger and more powerful caliber tends to bring things to a halt more
rapidly.
The name of the gams is tissue disruption, NOT simply perfectly placed
shots, and a devastating strike to the heart/lung zone with one or at
most two slugs when put up against a marginal or inadequate caliber in
the same spot wins.
Oh, and the idea of taking head shots is just not the smart thing to do,
as anyone who knows anything about armed combat will explain.
The head is a smaller target and is likely darting around too quickly to
enable that wonderful target Ruger to hit it with any degree of
certainty...assuming that your .22lr will penetrate fully enough to
destroy the brain's autonomic center, as even a brain shot is no
guarantee if it strikes an area that doesn't bring about the cessation
of breathing, as striking the Medula Oblongota will.
Center of mass is far and away the superior shot to take, whatever
caliber you are carrying.

One of the biggest problems with trying to use a .22 LR (from the many
tactical books I've read) appears to be lack of penetration.

They tend to glance off the skull, or other bones in the case of center
of mass shots. The up-side is that if they DO penetrate deep, they have
a tendency to ricochet inside of the torso and rip it to shreds. If you
go that way, be sure to use the hottest rounds you can get.

I'd never carry anything less powerful than my Keltec .380.

But, that gun is no better than the larger calibers because it's so
bloody light in weight! Your hand and wrist take up the majority of the
recoil and you have to reposition your grip after every shot. It's
positive factor is that it's _very_ concealable. I carry it in a pocket.

I'll stick with my Taurus PT-92 or Smith and Wesson model 4043 for the
most part, and use a good fannypack holster since they are both full
sized.

As for .45's, the only reason I don't own one is because they are too
expensive to feed/practice with. I may change my mind when I start
reloading more. I have fired other people's .45's at the range and have
never had a problem with the recoil. They have a sharp muzzle flip but
not significantly worse than the .40.

And I'm female.

If I were to carry a .45, I'd probably get a Revolver and a few speed
loaders. They tend to be built a bit heavier and the heavier the gun,
the easier the recoil as the weight of the gun takes up a lot of it.
That's why my Ruger Redhawk .357 magnum revolver is such a joy to shoot.

I've addressed this question a number of times but to answer the
specific question, No I have not seen such stats. As others have
mentioned, it isn't always the calilber or where it hits in many
cases, but rather the mindset of the person shot.
A close friend of mine took 7 hits out of a S&amp;W39 9mm, bullets were
Speer &quot;Lawman&quot; 125gr HP. All hits were torso and one bullet went clear
thru from his outstretched left hand, thru his lungs, across the
bottom of his heart and out the right side into his right arm where
the bullet came to a rest inside above his elbow. We removed that
bullet in a backyard surgery about two years later and I still have
the bullet. Needless to say, he survived both the shooting AND the
backyard surgery at my annual BBQ.
I took 7 hits from behind at a distance of about 15-20 feet and 5 were
torso hits. The bullets were CCI &quot;Stingers&quot; At least 3 of them bounced
around inside my tender body causing a great deal of damage. 2 are
still in there. In both shootings we were not incapacitated to the
point we could not take action but in both cases we didn't have
firearms on us to shoot back.
I have personal knowledge with one shot kills that should have been
nothing but band aid fixes, and other shootings that were multiple
hits with large calibers like .44Mag and 45acp in which the person
survived.
Head shots are not always fatal, nor are lung/heart shots. As a
professional hunting guide I've seen animals take multiple well placed
hits and went for a long distance before piling up dead. The general
concensus of those who are familiar with shootings, and not just
repeating what they read in a magazine, is after the first hit there
is a surge of adreneline that either blanks out pain, or renders the
nervous system partially incapacitated. That is what allows multiple
hits to go unnoticed, even with major bones/joints broken, until
sometime after the last shot is fired.

Lots of factors to take into account, such as the following set of
questions:
Was the target in a heightened state of excitement before being struck?
Was the target under the influence of drugs, such as PCP, or meth?
Was the target struck badly such that even a hit by something that would
be unquestionably devestating would not bring about immediate autonomic
collapse?
Were the projectiles of proper construction, and did they fully
penetrate and destroy vital organs?
What was the current state of health of the target?

Okay, I hope you get the idea now.

Thank you for you injecting some evidence gained from real life experience.
You are absolutely right that the state of mind (and health) of a person
has an enormous influence on the likelihood of survival.
