Oh i dunno, but you have all the ear-marks of a sock and

1. No IP
2. Very first post to alt.test

So, sure, interesting question, &quot;Whatever happened to Raine?&quot;
Why should anyone give you an answer?

Holy shit you're paranoid, especially given that you inhabit a group with
all of 3 active members.  But okay, I'll explain away your list.

1. No IP
I use SuperNews because my ISP doesn't offer usenet servers.  SuperNews
doesn't post the NNTP-Posting-Host header.

2. Very first post to alt.test
3. Second post started this thread
Coincidentally, also my very first post using 40tude Dialog as a
newsreader, which I wanted to make sure was set up properly.  You might
notice, internet detective, that I have a very long posting history in a
variety of newsgroups including but not limited to this one and alt.geek.
I used to be HChrist13 here(and before that, Harold Christ) and &quot;Asher Lev&quot;
in alt.geek.

4. X-No-Archive
As paranoid as you are, I'm surprised you don't have X-No-Archive in your
headers.  I have it there so 10 years from now I don't have to remember
having this stupid conversation with you.

As to my history in this newsgroup, I was around in 97/98.  I remember
David St. Albans, but nobody else here looks familiar.  No Raine, no Shiva,
no David Ellison, no Rofocale, nobody.  I asked a question and you
certainly don't have to answer if you don't want to, but it's going to be
better for both of us if you take the internet tough guy and put him in the
cabinet for a while.

&quot;internet tough guy&quot;?  and you call *me* paranoid?

lololol

Take all of the below and all it says, Mr. Jones, is that
your other post, Mr. Johnson, was a sock, just like i said.
And since you know it was, you may as well put your
&quot;internet naive guy&quot; into your own cabinet.

i don't know where you got your number &quot;3&quot;, or on what
criteria you base your opinion of &quot;active&quot;, but both shiva
and ellison both post to this group on occasion, and i can
count at least six others off hand that participate in this
group regularly (not including Trudie).

Rofocale is no longer here, but the troll you mentioned
certainly is and uses so many socks that what you call
&quot;paranoid&quot; is simply standard operating procedure.

Huh RRock,

Damn, you wasted the 3-seconds on him and that's called paranoid.  I think
he missed the point also........

Ok JDJ, this is the way it goes new people are usually albanS as a sock
puppet and then you ask a question that even you should know &quot;Raine&quot;  What
about Raine???? What is it you really care to know or find out?  Paranoid,
nah, but you coming on here asking questions knowing Raine left here 8-10
years ago.  Now that's fucking strange.

Well he already proved he isn't dumshit because dumshit can't count
higher than one, as has already been proven several times. In any case,
using a sock and asking a one-liner isn't giving enough information
for anyone to make that determination. At that point, as far i was
concerned, it was more than likely dumshit using a sock. Why anyone
would use a sock to ask that question in particular though? Yeah,
i have to agree with you there, Art.... strange enough without the
sock, stranger still with one.

lol, oh my, Sam, you actually thought it was worth something, Jeff? Yeah, Jeff,
i should say that going through all the trouble of making a new sock just for
asking that particular question was definitely more trouble than it was worth,
Sam. And keep in mind, Sam, that i haven't the slightest clue why anyone would
think using a sock for an introductory post to a group would be considered to
be offensive, Jeff. So sure, Jeff, just cut and run now that you've learned

I wrote a book and they basically can't do anything with books but

I thought it was funny that you claim to be able to count but still

So... where does this question come from, then?  All of a sudden, out
of the blue, you want to know about Raine, a person whose name hasn't
appeared here in years, and who is only mentioned by Saint.

You ask as though you don't know what happened to Raine, but you offer
the suggestion that she died a few times.  I don't know how many times
she died.  I do know there was some discussion of whether someone
portrayed themselves as being her after she did die (or otherwise
disappeared), but nothing much came of that notion.  And there was
some discussion of other people being Raine's sock puppets, but there
was no convincing evidence of that.  Only one person actually thought
that Raine &quot;died&quot; more than once, and that was Saint.

Saint has in the past used sock puppets.  His M.O. is fairly
consistent.  He gets into arguments, and either leaves or falls
silent.  Suddenly a new person appears from nowhere, either claiming
to be brand new, or claiming to be &quot;returning&quot; from long ago.  In
either case, this new person mysteriously seems to know quite a bit
about ARA and its posters, past and present.  They may claim not to
know that Saint fellow, or may suggest that Saint makes sense...

So now we've got Jeffrey D. Johnson, who happens onto the scene in
circumstances similar to other magical appearances of newcomers... and
people are thinking that, once more, it's Saint with a sock puppet.

Personally, I don't know what to think, and it really doesn't matter.
What's the difference if someone calls himself saint, Jeffrey, Chiron,
or Lady Azure?  It's all just names.  Does it really matter if two or
more posters are really the same person?  I think not.  Not unless you
believe that many people making a claim somehow makes the claim &quot;more
true&quot;.  I think that's the usual purpose of sock puppetry - to suggest
that more than one person is in favor of some position, to try to win
a position through numbers.

Perhaps when I have some time, I'll spider this NG and find out what I
can about the posters here.  I wrote a cute little perl script that
does this, but I haven't had as much time to play as I'd like.  Still,
it's often very informative to see all the little details about the
posters.  And it's really interesting to find who's sock puppets;
often you'd never even think of them as having any connection (they're
apparently good puppeteers).

&gt; &gt; So, sure, interesting question, &quot;Whatever happened to Raine?&quot;
&gt; &gt; Why should anyone give you an answer?

&gt; &gt; next

&gt; Holy shit you're paranoid, especially given that you inhabit a group with
&gt; all of 3 active members.  But okay, I'll explain away your list.

&gt; 1. No IP
&gt;   I use SuperNews because my ISP doesn't offer usenet servers.  SuperNews
&gt; doesn't post the NNTP-Posting-Host header.

&gt; 2. Very first post to alt.test
&gt; 3. Second post started this thread
&gt;   Coincidentally, also my very first post using 40tude Dialog as a
&gt; newsreader, which I wanted to make sure was set up properly.  You might
&gt; notice, internet detective, that I have a very long posting history in a
&gt; variety of newsgroups including but not limited to this one and alt.geek.
&gt; I used to be HChrist13 here(and before that, Harold Christ) and &quot;Asher Lev&quot;
&gt; in alt.geek.

&gt; 4. X-No-Archive
&gt;   As paranoid as you are, I'm surprised you don't have X-No-Archive in your
&gt; headers.  I have it there so 10 years from now I don't have to remember
&gt; having this stupid conversation with you.

&gt; As to my history in this newsgroup, I was around in 97/98.  I remember
&gt; David St. Albans, but nobody else here looks familiar.  No Raine, no Shiva,
&gt; no David Ellison, no Rofocale, nobody.  I asked a question and you
&gt; certainly don't have to answer if you don't want to, but it's going to be
&gt; better for both of us if you take the internet tough guy and put him in the
&gt; cabinet for a while.

rrock has a point... you come here as Johnson, and now you're Jones?

Look, if you're going to play sock puppets, you need to be a little
tricky about it.  You can't just come here as Johnson, and then talk
to people as Jones.  You've got to pretend you're the same person...
Pick an identity, and stick with it.

Now, the *real* way to do it is to create a bunch of identities, and
post all over creation - anything and anywhere, but make sure you have
some posts on some NG's.  alt.rec.macrame, whatever.  Just get your
name out there, post every so often, ask a question, and so on... but
don't *use* the identities unless you have to.  Just post now and
then, mild, inoffensive, bland posts that won't start a flame war -
and follow up a little bit.  Make it look like a real person is
there...

When you want to use one, you've already established a trail of
comments, so you aren't suddenly appearing out of nowhere.  You might
even want to add some (fictitious) stuff to your profile, to give
yourself some credibility.  Nothing much, nothing verifiable, but just
to offer some realism.  A fake name, a fake city/state, maybe a link
to a &quot;favorite&quot; macrame Website.

So, if you're going to play this game, you need to get on the stick
and start making up identities.  You can even set up identities using
e-mail accounts from domains in other countries - China, Canada,
whatever.  If you do that (and if that country doesn't speak English
as its main language), you can even get away with making grammar and
spelling mistakes.  Anyone criticizes you, apologize that you weren't
a good student in school in Zaire (or wherever), but that you're
trying your best.  Make them feel like crap for criticizing someone
whose native language isn't English.  If you play that well, people
will jump on him for being a bigot.  Bonus points for you in any flame
wars...

But the key here is always to stay in character.  If you're Johnson,
stay as Johnson.  If you're trying to juggle several puppet games on
different NG's, then you should probably first be Johnson, and go to
those NG's where Johnson is operating.  Then shut down - close out
Johnson, log off, or do whatever you need to to get out of that
character.  Sign in as the next guy, and carry on.

All of this is helpful if you're going to play sock puppets, but I
have an even better suggestion.  Why not just be whoever you are?  It
simplifies your life by not requiring you to have all these identities
and to maintain them; it avoids confusing yourself.  Since sock
puppetry doesn't really accomplish much for you anyway, you don't lose
much.  In fact, by staying in character, you avoid all those
credibility-destroying moments when the curtain opens and people see a
man controlling the Wizard...

I would point out that a phrase like &quot;Internet tough guy&quot; sounds very
much like Saint.  Of course, no one has a monopoly on creative
language, but you don't find much of it on an NG.  Saint does use some
creative phrases, so when I see something like that, I immediately
suspect it's another Saint sock puppet.

Just some thoughts...

Your comments aren't quite accurate.  While there is a huge amount of
Saint-bashing here, it is not everyone, nor is it just a bunch of
meanies picking on you.  You have more than earned it in your past
behavior.

Unfortunately, what has now happened is that you've established an
ongoing situation in which your behavior and that of other long-term
posters is polarized and more or less solidified.  You make a
reasonable statement; it is derided by those who have known you for
years; you get angry and lash out; they hit back; and pretty soon,
it's a free-for-all, you against several other people (NOT everyone;
just several people).  Eventually you get frustrated and angry, and
want to leave the group.  You say goodbye, and you mean it, but the
other people know you'll be back.  So you return.  Maybe you play sock
puppets, maybe you don't; but you return.  It's an endless,
frustrating dance that never goes anywhere.  You suffer from this;
others are at least annoyed, if not suffering.

I don't know any way out of this.  You'd have to completely change
your behavior, and consistently maintain that change in the face of
endless abuse from people for years, before people would eventually
accept that you have, indeed, made the changes.  Most of the people
here won't let you do that; they'll goad you until you get angry
again, and repeat the cycle.  Many people like to keep things they way
they are, maintain the status quo.  If you (or anyone) tries to
change, they'll fight that, trying to force the person to revert to
the old ways.

I'm not saying it's impossible, just that it would require an
enormous, sustained commitment on your part to accomplish it, to prove
to all the naysayers and knuckleheads (and the reasonable skeptics,
too) that you really have changed.  It would require more than I could
muster; maybe more than is humanly possible.

&gt; &gt; The real Raine, Danielle, died some time ago. The fake Raine, who was

&gt; &gt; swore it was because he hated all of us and wanted to protect his
&gt; &gt; adopted mother. Could be. I don't know and I don't care. &quot;She&quot; was a
&gt; &gt; disaster area. And a paranoid. &quot;She&quot; came back briefly. But that was
&gt; &gt; Rrock pretending to be her. It is Rrock who hides behind a sock-puppet
&gt; &gt; and is not a real person. His whole story was made up and he came here
&gt; &gt; to basically (he thought) out troll all the trolls. He became a troll
&gt; &gt; because he felt it was necessary. he believes he knows all about
&gt; &gt; computers and science and math. But he is a fanatic, a literalist, one-
&gt; &gt; time f*ckbuddy with Mark Earnest, now he hates Earnest. So now he is
&gt; &gt; Art's F*ckbuddy.

&gt; &gt; Anything else you would care to know? Everyone already thinks you're
&gt; &gt; my sock puppet. What'shilarious is they say I cannot count, but seem
&gt; &gt; to have outwitted them all by making hundreds of sock-puppets they
&gt; &gt; can't seem to do anything about or even pin down with an IP address!
&gt; &gt; For all their computer saavy they are competely in the dark.

&gt; &gt; This has now become the alt.bash.st.albans NG and that is all they
&gt; &gt; care about doing. They have to bash me even to people like you, who
&gt; &gt; come out of nowhere and then leave! They are obsessed with me, because
&gt; &gt; I wrote a book and they basically can't do anything with books but
&gt; &gt; wipe their butts with the paper. Not one of them can read or spell and

&gt; So... where does this question come from, then?  All of a sudden, out

And all of the sudden here is someone calling themselves Chiron, who
says they KNOW Raine or ME...And who the fuck are YOU???

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You ask as though you don't know what happened to Raine, but you offer
&gt; the suggestion that she died a few times.  I don't know how many times
&gt; she died.  I do know there was some discussion of whether someone
&gt; portrayed themselves as being her after she did die (or otherwise
&gt; disappeared), but nothing much came of that notion.  And there was
&gt; some discussion of other people being Raine's sock puppets, but there
&gt; was no convincing evidence of that.  Only one person actually thought
&gt; that Raine &quot;died&quot; more than once, and that was Saint.
">

Now this is a straight out lie. Raine died once. That's it. That's all
I ever said. A person only dies once. Looking back at the archives it
is absolutely apparent that the real Raine was a nice, decent
intelligent person. Whomever took over her computer when she got ill
and later died, was insane. And that person finally admitted it. Just
because you or the others CHOOSE not to believe that person's story
(who by the way, disappeared along with the Raine caricature shortly
after his confession), that is your problem. I choose to believe it,
because it made SENSE. Which nothing else and no one else does on this
NG. (Except me.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Saint has in the past used sock puppets.
">

So did everyone on this group. I did it because they showed me how it
was done. And most of you couldn't tell which sock-puppet I was. But
there's a difference between usuing a sock-puppet to get a word in
edgewise and say something without being slammed, and using one that
sublimates your own personality so far that YOU FORGET WHO YOU REALLY
ARE. That is the kind Rrock is. The kind Art is.
What kind are you?

That is NOT me. Period, end of discussion. That is Boggle who plays
multiple rolls here and has NEVER gone away or died, though I wish he
had. He is a typical troll, he chimes in when things seem to get dull
to get responses. Now, suddenly there is some dude named Johnson then
Jones, now Chiron. And it has lured me back into talking to you, who
most likely are NOT Chiron. Chiron of course being an angel's name and
one that a few books have been written about in recen years. So you
are posing as someone &quot;important&quot; to angelology. But if you are hiding

comparing me to Thracian and other nutters, then by God, I KNOW you

Hmmm, like YOU do?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So now we've got Jeffrey D. Johnson, who happens onto the scene in

And once more they are insane, obsessed with me and my weird and
uncanny ability to pop sock-puppets out of my ass everytime I get
bored! LOL! Give me a fucking break. I have not used a sock-puppet
here since Rock first came on board. And I did that because the
vicious bastard was attacking my posts with some sort of filthy robot
he made.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Personally, I don't know what to think, and it really doesn't matter.
&gt; What's the difference if someone calls himself saint, Jeffrey, Chiron,

Ah yes, Lady Azure. A nutter of the first ilk!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; It's all just names.  Does it really matter if two or
&gt; more posters are really the same person?  I think not.  Not unless you

&gt; that more than one person is in favor of some position, to try to win
&gt; a position through numbers.

or sometimes it's just to pull someone's leg. Other time's it is to
make a gang-bang seem even more cruel and punishing of a single

individual thinks they ARE the Chief Thracian! LOL!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Perhaps when I have some time, I'll spider this NG and find out what I
&gt; can about the posters here.  I wrote a cute little perl script that

&gt; it's often very informative to see all the little details about the
&gt; posters.  And it's really interesting to find who's sock puppets;
&gt; often you'd never even think of them as having any connection (they're
&gt; apparently good puppeteers).

Well do so! I'd love to see it, I can tell you all about myself right
now. I don't DO sock-puppets. And any blow-hard here who says I do,

&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. No IP

&gt; &gt; &gt; So, sure, interesting question, &quot;Whatever happened to Raine?&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why should anyone give you an answer?

&gt; &gt; &gt; next

&gt; &gt; Holy shit you're paranoid, especially given that you inhabit a group with
&gt; &gt; all of 3 active members.  But okay, I'll explain away your list.

&gt; &gt; 1. No IP
&gt; &gt;   I use SuperNews because my ISP doesn't offer usenet servers.  SuperNews
&gt; &gt; doesn't post the NNTP-Posting-Host header.

&gt; &gt; 2. Very first post to alt.test
&gt; &gt; 3. Second post started this thread
&gt; &gt;   Coincidentally, also my very first post using 40tude Dialog as a
&gt; &gt; newsreader, which I wanted to make sure was set up properly.  You might
&gt; &gt; notice, internet detective, that I have a very long posting history in a
&gt; &gt; variety of newsgroups including but not limited to this one and alt.geek.
&gt; &gt; I used to be HChrist13 here(and before that, Harold Christ) and &quot;Asher Lev&quot;
&gt; &gt; in alt.geek.

&gt; &gt; 4. X-No-Archive
&gt; &gt;   As paranoid as you are, I'm surprised you don't have X-No-Archive in your
&gt; &gt; headers.  I have it there so 10 years from now I don't have to remember
&gt; &gt; having this stupid conversation with you.

&gt; &gt; As to my history in this newsgroup, I was around in 97/98.  I remember
&gt; &gt; David St. Albans, but nobody else here looks familiar.  No Raine, no Shiva,
&gt; &gt; no David Ellison, no Rofocale, nobody.  I asked a question and you
&gt; &gt; certainly don't have to answer if you don't want to, but it's going to be
&gt; &gt; better for both of us if you take the internet tough guy and put him in the
&gt; &gt; cabinet for a while.

&gt; rrock has a point... you come here as Johnson, and now you're Jones?

&gt; Look, if you're going to play sock puppets, you need to be a little
&gt; tricky about it.  You can't just come here as Johnson, and then talk
&gt; to people as Jones.  You've got to pretend you're the same person...
&gt; Pick an identity, and stick with it.

&gt; Now, the *real* way to do it is to create a bunch of identities, and
&gt; post all over creation - anything and anywhere, but make sure you have
&gt; some posts on some NG's.  alt.rec.macrame, whatever.  Just get your
&gt; name out there, post every so often, ask a question, and so on... but
&gt; don't *use* the identities unless you have to.  Just post now and
&gt; then, mild, inoffensive, bland posts that won't start a flame war -
&gt; and follow up a little bit.  Make it look like a real person is
&gt; there...

&gt; When you want to use one, you've already established a trail of
&gt; comments, so you aren't suddenly appearing out of nowhere.  You might
&gt; even want to add some (fictitious) stuff to your profile, to give
&gt; yourself some credibility.  Nothing much, nothing verifiable, but just
&gt; to offer some realism.  A fake name, a fake city/state, maybe a link
&gt; to a &quot;favorite&quot; macrame Website.

&gt; So, if you're going to play this game, you need to get on the stick
&gt; and start making up identities.  You can even set up identities using
&gt; e-mail accounts from domains in other countries - China, Canada,
&gt; whatever.  If you do that (and if that country doesn't speak English
&gt; as its main language), you can even get away with making grammar and
&gt; spelling mistakes.  Anyone criticizes you, apologize that you weren't
&gt; a good student in school in Zaire (or wherever), but that you're
&gt; trying your best.  Make them feel like crap for criticizing someone
&gt; whose native language isn't English.  If you play that well, people
&gt; will jump on him for being a bigot.  Bonus points for you in any flame
&gt; wars...

&gt; But the key here is always to stay in character.  If you're Johnson,
&gt; stay as Johnson.  If you're trying to juggle several puppet games on
&gt; different NG's, then you should probably first be Johnson, and go to
&gt; those NG's where Johnson is operating.  Then shut down - close out
&gt; Johnson, log off, or do whatever you need to to get out of that
&gt; character.  Sign in as the next guy, and carry on.

&gt; All of this is helpful if you're going to play sock puppets, but I
&gt; have an even better suggestion.  Why not just be whoever you are?  It
&gt; simplifies your life by not requiring you to have all these identities
&gt; and to maintain them; it avoids confusing yourself.  Since sock
&gt; puppetry doesn't really accomplish much for you anyway, you don't lose
&gt; much.  In fact, by staying in character, you avoid all those
&gt; credibility-destroying moments when the curtain opens and people see a
&gt; man controlling the Wizard...

&gt; I would point out that a phrase like &quot;Internet tough guy&quot; sounds very
&gt; much like Saint.  Of course, no one has a monopoly on creative
&gt; language, but you don't find much of it on an NG.  Saint does use some
&gt; creative phrases, so when I see something like that, I immediately
&gt; suspect it's another Saint sock puppet.

certainly never would make any of the mistakes yu just mentioned
Johnson/Jones made. And thanks, yes, I AM creative at writing. At
least you don;t keep harping on that aspect. But no, again, I do NOT
use sock-puppets. and &quot;Internet tough guy?&quot; Please, I made up terms

Of course. Because they are HUNGRY for violent and awful words. Like
&quot;go fuck your face with an axe!&quot; Did Mark do something to deserve such
a terribly horrid statement thrown at him? Why, because he doesn't
want to talk to Rrock? Because he won't agree with Rrock? Because he
can't get up enough mental stability to actually maintain a simple
discussion? This then makes it &quot;right&quot; for Rrock to tell him he should
have sex in his face with a razor sharp impliment of destruction???
NO! Rrock is a SOCIOPATH. He is so bent on Literalist Extremism he is
a Net-Terrorist, not a discussion group member. Anywhere else people
would descend on him like a plague. Here he just goes on and on,
because Mark and Me are the only old ones left. Rrock is obsessed to

&gt; &gt; Your comments aren't quite accurate.  While there is a huge amount of
&gt; &gt; Saint-bashing here, it is not everyone, nor is it just a bunch of
&gt; &gt; meanies picking on you.  You have more than earned it in your past
&gt; &gt; behavior.

&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, what has now happened is that you've established an
&gt; &gt; ongoing situation in which your behavior and that of other long-term
&gt; &gt; posters is polarized and more or less solidified.  You make a
&gt; &gt; reasonable statement; it is derided by those who have known you for
&gt; &gt; years; you get angry and lash out; they hit back; and pretty soon,
&gt; &gt; it's a free-for-all, you against several other people (NOT everyone;
&gt; &gt; just several people).  Eventually you get frustrated and angry, and
&gt; &gt; want to leave the group.  You say goodbye, and you mean it, but the
&gt; &gt; other people know you'll be back.  So you return.  Maybe you play sock
&gt; &gt; puppets, maybe you don't; but you return.  It's an endless,
&gt; &gt; frustrating dance that never goes anywhere.  You suffer from this;
&gt; &gt; others are at least annoyed, if not suffering.

&gt; &gt; I don't know any way out of this.  You'd have to completely change
&gt; &gt; your behavior, and consistently maintain that change in the face of
&gt; &gt; endless abuse from people for years, before people would eventually
&gt; &gt; accept that you have, indeed, made the changes.  Most of the people
&gt; &gt; here won't let you do that; they'll goad you until you get angry
&gt; &gt; again, and repeat the cycle.  Many people like to keep things they way
&gt; &gt; they are, maintain the status quo.  If you (or anyone) tries to
&gt; &gt; change, they'll fight that, trying to force the person to revert to

&quot;Apocalypse is Greek for &quot;A Secret Revealed.&quot; What does that say about

mankind.
But my mother used to think the world was going to end every time she
got a

California and Japan always get earthquakes, Kansas and Oklahoma and
other
states always get tornadoes, Florida and the Caribbean always get
hurricanes. Certain areas always get floods. Weathermen can't even
predict
the weather correctly 75% of the time! So when people &quot;predict&quot; the
end of
the world, I just have to laugh. The world will be around long after
we are
all gone. And the Secret will be revealed which will change us...but
it
won't cause the kind of wild eyed destruction that prophets see. Did
you
know there was a &quot;Revelation of St. Peter&quot; that was so horrible that
the
Catholics left it out of the Bible? Imagine if they had left it in!!!
Two
Revelations! Woah! &quot;

The context is and WAS that ANYONE can predict horrible things for the
coming millenium because they are PREDICTING THE OBVIOUS! As I said,
when people predict the End of the World I just have to laugh. The
joke was I predicted riots and wars (all of which we have had, by the
way!) in a world gone mad with fear and delusional thinking. What do
we call Iraq? What do we call riots in France or Pakistan? What do we
call 911? Or the Spanish Train terror incident? These I could say I
PROPHESIED. But I didn't. I said that of course it is EASY to prophecy
that which will happen ANYWAY. Rrock is a rotten liar and a plagiarist
and worse, he has no compunction about taking things WAY out of
context to make himself look good, to some guy named Seon who is

&gt;&gt;You ask as though you don't know what happened to Raine, but you offer
&gt;&gt;the suggestion that she died a few times.  I don't know how many times

&gt;&gt;portrayed themselves as being her after she did die (or otherwise
&gt;&gt;disappeared), but nothing much came of that notion.  And there was
&gt;&gt;some discussion of other people being Raine's sock puppets, but there
&gt;&gt;was no convincing evidence of that.  Only one person actually thought
&gt;&gt;that Raine &quot;died&quot; more than once, and that was Saint.

&gt; Now this is a straight out lie. Raine died once. That's it. That's all

&gt;&gt;Saint has in the past used sock puppets.

&gt; So did everyone on this group. I did it because they showed me how it
&gt; was done. And most of you couldn't tell which sock-puppet I was. But
&gt; there's a difference between usuing a sock-puppet to get a word in
&gt; edgewise and say something without being slammed, and using one that
&gt; sublimates your own personality so far that YOU FORGET WHO YOU REALLY
&gt; ARE. That is the kind Rrock is. The kind Art is.
&gt; What kind are you?

&gt;&gt; His M.O. is fairly
&gt;&gt;consistent.  He gets into arguments, and either leaves or falls
&gt;&gt;silent.

&gt; I leave when I get so pissed I get tired of being oissed. I fall
&gt; silent when I have nothing further to say to idiots.

&gt;&gt;Suddenly a new person appears from nowhere, either claiming
&gt;&gt;to be brand new, or claiming to be &quot;returning&quot; from long ago.

&gt; That is NOT me. Period, end of discussion. That is Boggle who plays
&gt; multiple rolls here and has NEVER gone away or died, though I wish he
&gt; had. He is a typical troll, he chimes in when things seem to get dull
&gt; to get responses. Now, suddenly there is some dude named Johnson then
&gt; Jones, now Chiron. And it has lured me back into talking to you, who
&gt; most likely are NOT Chiron. Chiron of course being an angel's name and
&gt; one that a few books have been written about in recen years. So you
&gt; are posing as someone &quot;important&quot; to angelology. But if you are hiding
&gt; behind a nick and the FIRST thing you write is an insult towards me,
&gt; comparing me to Thracian and other nutters, then by God, I KNOW you
&gt; are Boggle. So quit fucking around.

&gt;&gt;In
&gt;&gt;either case, this new person mysteriously seems to know quite a bit
&gt;&gt;about ARA and its posters, past and present.  They may claim not to
&gt;&gt;know that Saint fellow, or may suggest that Saint makes sense...

&gt; Hmmm, like YOU do?

&gt;&gt;So now we've got Jeffrey D. Johnson, who happens onto the scene in
&gt;&gt;circumstances similar to other magical appearances of newcomers... and
&gt;&gt;people are thinking that, once more, it's Saint with a sock puppet.

&gt; And once more they are insane, obsessed with me and my weird and
&gt; uncanny ability to pop sock-puppets out of my ass everytime I get
&gt; bored! LOL! Give me a fucking break. I have not used a sock-puppet
&gt; here since Rock first came on board. And I did that because the
&gt; vicious bastard was attacking my posts with some sort of filthy robot
&gt; he made.

&gt;&gt;Personally, I don't know what to think, and it really doesn't matter.
&gt;&gt;What's the difference if someone calls himself saint, Jeffrey, Chiron,
&gt;&gt;or Lady Azure?

&gt; Ah yes, Lady Azure. A nutter of the first ilk!

&gt;&gt;It's all just names.  Does it really matter if two or
&gt;&gt;more posters are really the same person?  I think not.  Not unless you
&gt;&gt;believe that many people making a claim somehow makes the claim &quot;more
&gt;&gt;true&quot;.  I think that's the usual purpose of sock puppetry - to suggest
&gt;&gt;that more than one person is in favor of some position, to try to win
&gt;&gt;a position through numbers.

&gt; or sometimes it's just to pull someone's leg. Other time's it is to
&gt; make a gang-bang seem even more cruel and punishing of a single
&gt; individual one indivitual hates. Other times it is because an
&gt; individual thinks they ARE the Chief Thracian! LOL!

&gt;&gt;Perhaps when I have some time, I'll spider this NG and find out what I
&gt;&gt;can about the posters here.  I wrote a cute little perl script that
&gt;&gt;does this, but I haven't had as much time to play as I'd like.  Still,
&gt;&gt;it's often very informative to see all the little details about the
&gt;&gt;posters.  And it's really interesting to find who's sock puppets;
&gt;&gt;often you'd never even think of them as having any connection (they're
&gt;&gt;apparently good puppeteers).

&gt; Well do so! I'd love to see it, I can tell you all about myself right
&gt; now. I don't DO sock-puppets. And any blow-hard here who says I do,
&gt; and then tells people they know computer codes, is a f*cking liar.

&gt;&gt;&gt;As to my history in this newsgroup, I was around in 97/98.  I remember
&gt;&gt;&gt;David St. Albans, but nobody else here looks familiar.  No Raine, no Shiva,
&gt;&gt;&gt;no David Ellison, no Rofocale, nobody.  I asked a question and you
&gt;&gt;&gt;certainly don't have to answer if you don't want to, but it's going to be
&gt;&gt;&gt;better for both of us if you take the internet tough guy and put him in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;cabinet for a while.

&gt;&gt;rrock has a point... you come here as Johnson, and now you're Jones?

&gt;&gt;Look, if you're going to play sock puppets, you need to be a little
&gt;&gt;tricky about it.  You can't just come here as Johnson, and then talk
&gt;&gt;to people as Jones.  You've got to pretend you're the same person...
&gt;&gt;Pick an identity, and stick with it.

&gt;&gt;Now, the *real* way to do it is to create a bunch of identities, and
&gt;&gt;post all over creation - anything and anywhere, but make sure you have
&gt;&gt;some posts on some NG's.  alt.rec.macrame, whatever.  Just get your
&gt;&gt;name out there, post every so often, ask a question, and so on... but
&gt;&gt;don't *use* the identities unless you have to.  Just post now and
&gt;&gt;then, mild, inoffensive, bland posts that won't start a flame war -
&gt;&gt;and follow up a little bit.  Make it look like a real person is
&gt;&gt;there...

&gt;&gt;When you want to use one, you've already established a trail of
&gt;&gt;comments, so you aren't suddenly appearing out of nowhere.  You might
&gt;&gt;even want to add some (fictitious) stuff to your profile, to give
&gt;&gt;yourself some credibility.  Nothing much, nothing verifiable, but just
&gt;&gt;to offer some realism.  A fake name, a fake city/state, maybe a link
&gt;&gt;to a &quot;favorite&quot; macrame Website.

&gt;&gt;So, if you're going to play this game, you need to get on the stick
&gt;&gt;and start making up identities.  You can even set up identities using
&gt;&gt;e-mail accounts from domains in other countries - China, Canada,
&gt;&gt;whatever.  If you do that (and if that country doesn't speak English
&gt;&gt;as its main language), you can even get away with making grammar and
&gt;&gt;spelling mistakes.  Anyone criticizes you, apologize that you weren't
&gt;&gt;a good student in school in Zaire (or wherever), but that you're
&gt;&gt;trying your best.  Make them feel like crap for criticizing someone
&gt;&gt;whose native language isn't English.  If you play that well, people
&gt;&gt;will jump on him for being a bigot.  Bonus points for you in any flame
&gt;&gt;wars...

&gt;&gt;But the key here is always to stay in character.  If you're Johnson,
&gt;&gt;stay as Johnson.  If you're trying to juggle several puppet games on
&gt;&gt;different NG's, then you should probably first be Johnson, and go to
&gt;&gt;those NG's where Johnson is operating.  Then shut down - close out
&gt;&gt;Johnson, log off, or do whatever you need to to get out of that
&gt;&gt;character.  Sign in as the next guy, and carry on.

&gt;&gt;All of this is helpful if you're going to play sock puppets, but I
&gt;&gt;have an even better suggestion.  Why not just be whoever you are?  It
&gt;&gt;simplifies your life by not requiring you to have all these identities
&gt;&gt;and to maintain them; it avoids confusing yourself.  Since sock
&gt;&gt;puppetry doesn't really accomplish much for you anyway, you don't lose
&gt;&gt;much.  In fact, by staying in character, you avoid all those
&gt;&gt;credibility-destroying moments when the curtain opens and people see a
&gt;&gt;man controlling the Wizard...

&gt;&gt;I would point out that a phrase like &quot;Internet tough guy&quot; sounds very
&gt;&gt;much like Saint.  Of course, no one has a monopoly on creative
&gt;&gt;language, but you don't find much of it on an NG.  Saint does use some
&gt;&gt;creative phrases, so when I see something like that, I immediately
&gt;&gt;suspect it's another Saint sock puppet.

&gt;&gt;Just some thoughts...- Hide quoted text -

&gt; Nice. #1. You know WAY too much about sock puppets. #2. You know
&gt; NOTHING about me and are lying about me in public, and so therefore as
&gt; Rrock would say, you are a liar. #3. I do NOT use sock-puppets. I
&gt; certainly never would make any of the mistakes yu just mentioned
&gt; Johnson/Jones made. And thanks, yes, I AM creative at writing. At
&gt; least you don;t keep harping on that aspect. But no, again, I do NOT
&gt; use sock-puppets. and &quot;Internet tough guy?&quot; Please, I made up terms
&gt; like &quot;intergnats&quot; and words that have creative punch! I'm way more

And #2: As i would say, bullshit. He knows far more about you than you
even know about yourself, and that is a fact. I haven't got a clue why
you insist on thinking that other people couldn't possibly be smarter
than you when simultaneously proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that
your brains are like stew, you can't read, can't count, can't remember
whom people are one from another, can't remember what was posted EVEN
BY YOURSELF even moments prior, etc., etc., ad nauseum. You really

Oh, here we go again...

When will you ever learn NOT to demonstrate the exact opposite of the
point you are trying to make within the very same sentence or paragraph
where you are making it?

Probably never, your brain is like stew from so many drugs that you
can't even remember what you are saying while you are saying it, or
simply don't have the comprehension power to understand the words you
are using (can't read).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You use a lot of words to tell
&gt; one little story. &quot;I don't like Saint&quot; so you tell it with lies. I do

&gt; perfectly fine relationship. I am a fine, upstanding hard working
&gt; American tax-payer and I am a creative person.
&gt; Whereas, sir, or
&gt; madame, you are nothing but a lying Saint basher. Your behavior is
&gt; beneath contempt.

&gt;&gt;Unfortunately, what has now happened is that you've established an
&gt;&gt;ongoing situation in which your behavior and that of other long-term
&gt;&gt;posters is polarized and more or less solidified.

&gt; What do you know about it? Or about me?

&gt;&gt;You make a
&gt;&gt;reasonable statement; it is derided by those who have known you for
&gt;&gt;years; you get angry and lash out; they hit back; and pretty soon,
&gt;&gt;it's a free-for-all, you against several other people (NOT everyone;
&gt;&gt;just several people).

&gt; I never used the term &quot;everyone.&quot; I said THREE people here were insane
&gt; and it was hard to discuss things of an angelic nature with them! I
&gt; also said others here have been on a Saint Bashing frenzy for years
&gt; and are obsessed with me. &quot;Everyone&quot; means everyone who comes here to
&gt; DISCUSS, not Trudie who comes to tell angel stories, or the several
&gt; others who never post back. But the Discussion Group including now
&gt; yourself, are nothing but liars and bashers. That is my opinion. And
&gt; if they do not have the sense to see a reasonable statement and then
&gt; DISCUSS it reasonablly without lashing out at me, then let them act
&gt; like sharks and predators. Who cares? They aren't even worth a real
&gt; flame war. Now, if you know me at all you know the REAL flame war I

&gt;&gt;Eventually you get frustrated and angry, and

&gt; NOT be driven away by people with such low IQ's who are such
&gt; unmannered louts and dunderheads that they could FILL the Special

&gt;&gt; So you return.  Maybe you play sock
&gt;&gt;puppets, maybe you don't; but you return.

&gt; I don't play socks. I return when I want to or when I feel the need to
&gt; make sure the PUBLIC who after all DOES read some of this, needs to
&gt; know just which of these psychopaths are lying and conning them.

&gt;&gt; It's an endless,
&gt;&gt;frustrating dance that never goes anywhere.  You suffer from this;
&gt;&gt;others are at least annoyed, if not suffering.

&gt; And your point is? Do you for one instant think I don't know or
&gt; haven't thought EVERY thing you just said more than once? Do you
&gt; really think I am that stupid? Do you really think that I haven't
&gt; watched you, in four seperate posts, con people into thinking that #1.
&gt; You know me. And #2. Have used each post to put a knife in me and
&gt; twist it? WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT ME and NOT ABOUT ANGELS? Because
&gt; you are NOT who you say you are, Chiron. I keep telling people like
&gt; you that this NG should NOT be about me. Now you've made at least five
&gt; posts that I know of in a very short span,mentioning me in each one as
&gt; a sock-puppet master and several other nasty things. I am just
&gt; wondering where you are headed with all this. I wonder how it will tie
&gt; into either angels or religion.

&gt;&gt;I don't know any way out of this.

&gt; Uhm start talking TO ME instead of ABOUT me.

&gt;&gt;You'd have to completely change
&gt;&gt;your behavior, and consistently maintain that change in the face of
&gt;&gt;endless abuse from people for years, before people would eventually
&gt;&gt;accept that you have, indeed, made the changes.

&gt; You mistake me for someone who gives a damn. Why would I care to
&gt; &quot;change&quot;for a bunch of uneducated cyber-bullies? Do you think anyone,
&gt; anywhere on any other planet gives one real shit about this tiny group
&gt; and the way some poor schlub named Saint acts??? Can you not see that
&gt; these people, and now YOURSELF are completely obsessed with MY
&gt; behavior while unable to check YOUR OWN in any reasonable way? You
&gt; just wrote a lengthy post about ME! Why not write about YOU? Your
&gt; beliefs? Your notions on angels? Your take on religion? Then ask me or
&gt; anyone else to discuss? These are not &quot;people.&quot; These are sublimated
&gt; souls covered in such filth and abuse they cannot STOP themselves from
&gt; harassing me or anyone else they think might be me or equate with me!
&gt; They have no excuses. My &quot;behavior&quot; is ALWAYS in REACTION to their
&gt; initial tirades and bad behavior. I never talked down to Art, for
&gt; instance until he called me a heretic for not believing in the trinity
&gt; and said he would come over to my house and  screw my wife and kill
&gt; me! That sort of BEHAVIOR, sir or madame is what caused me to get on
&gt; his case. But since he turned out to be a squirrley little coward with
&gt; an inferiority complex, there is little need to even deal with him.
&gt; You on the other hand are pretty damned cagey.

&gt;&gt;Most of the people
&gt;&gt;here won't let you do that; they'll goad you until you get angry
&gt;&gt;again, and repeat the cycle.

&gt; Let them. It helps me practice my craft.

&gt;&gt; Many people like to keep things they way
&gt;&gt;they are, maintain the status quo.

&gt; Too bad. Because the status quo is Dog Eat Dog.

&gt;&gt; If you (or anyone) tries to
&gt;&gt;change, they'll fight that, trying to force the person to revert to
&gt;&gt;the old ways.

&gt; Of course. Because they are HUNGRY for violent and awful words. Like
&gt; &quot;go fuck your face with an axe!&quot; Did Mark do something to deserve such
&gt; a terribly horrid statement thrown at him? Why, because he doesn't
&gt; want to talk to Rrock? Because he won't agree with Rrock? Because he
&gt; can't get up enough mental stability to actually maintain a simple
&gt; discussion? This then makes it &quot;right&quot; for Rrock to tell him he should
&gt; have sex in his face with a razor sharp impliment of destruction???
&gt; NO! Rrock is a SOCIOPATH. He is so bent on Literalist Extremism he is
&gt; a Net-Terrorist, not a discussion group member. Anywhere else people
&gt; would descend on him like a plague. Here he just goes on and on,
&gt; because Mark and Me are the only old ones left. Rrock is obsessed to
&gt; DESTROY things and people. That's all. And Art eggs him on. Because he
&gt; couldn't make good on his not so veiled threats.

&gt;&gt;I'm not saying it's impossible, just that it would require an
&gt;&gt;enormous, sustained commitment on your part to accomplish it, to prove
&gt;&gt;to all the naysayers and knuckleheads (and the reasonable skeptics,
&gt;&gt;too) that you really have changed.

&gt; Reasonable skeptics? You including yourself in that? Then STOP LYING
&gt; ABOUT ME. I do not have a &quot;modus operandi.&quot; I have a MISSION. You can
&gt; read about it on my web site and in my book. Period. I came here with
&gt; the INTENT to find people of like mind and if it takes cleaning out a
&gt; nest of vermin to make the place COMFORTABLE for someone with a decent
&gt; sensibility, so be it.

&gt;&gt;It would require more than I could
&gt;&gt;muster; maybe more than is humanly possible.

&gt; I am a human. I could do it EASILY. I simply choose not to. As long as
&gt; the knuckleheads and naysayers use language like Rrock and Art use,
&gt; &quot;Go fuck yourself&quot; &quot;jailhouse bitch&quot; and the like, who can be
&gt; comfortable here??? Until the vermin stop acting like vermin or are
&gt; swept away, then I will go to their levels to fight them. Call me &quot;The

&quot;Apocalypse is Greek for &quot;A Secret Revealed.&quot; What does that say about

mankind.
But my mother used to think the world was going to end every time she

divorce! Catastrophe is in the eye of the beholder. Turkey and Mexico
and
California and Japan always get earthquakes, Kansas and Oklahoma and
other
states always get tornadoes, Florida and the Caribbean always get
hurricanes. Certain areas always get floods. Weathermen can't even
predict
the weather correctly 75% of the time! So when people &quot;predict&quot; the
end of
the world, I just have to laugh. The world will be around long after
we are
all gone. And the Secret will be revealed which will change us...but
it
won't cause the kind of wild eyed destruction that prophets see. Did
you
know there was a &quot;Revelation of St. Peter&quot; that was so horrible that
the
Catholics left it out of the Bible? Imagine if they had left it in!!!
Two
Revelations! Woah! &quot;

The context is and WAS that ANYONE can predict horrible things for the
coming millenium because they are PREDICTING THE OBVIOUS! As I said,
when people predict the End of the World I just have to laugh. The
joke was I predicted riots and wars (all of which we have had, by the
way!) in a world gone mad with fear and delusional thinking. What do
we call Iraq? What do we call riots in France or Pakistan? What do we
call 911? Or the Spanish Train terror incident? These I could say I
PROPHESIED. But I didn't. I said that of course it is EASY to prophecy
that which will happen ANYWAY. Rrock is a rotten liar and a plagiarist
and worse, he has no compunction about taking things WAY out of
context to make himself look good, to some guy named Seon who is
already GONE. Rrock is a trolling liar and someone up to no good. In

You realize you just posted three or four posts here to your own

&gt; &gt; rrock has a point... you come here as Johnson, and now you're Jones?

&gt; &gt; Look, if you're going to play sock puppets, you need to be a little
&gt; &gt; tricky about it.  You can't just come here as Johnson, and then talk
&gt; &gt; to people as Jones.  You've got to pretend you're the same person...
&gt; &gt; Pick an identity, and stick with it.
">

&lt;snip.

[***NOTE THE FOLLOWING ADVICE***]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; But the key here is always to stay in character.  If you're Johnson,
&gt; &gt; stay as Johnson.  If you're trying to juggle several puppet games on
&gt; &gt; different NG's, then you should probably first be Johnson, and go to
&gt; &gt; those NG's where Johnson is operating.  Then shut down - close out
&gt; &gt; Johnson, log off, or do whatever you need to to get out of that
&gt; &gt; character.  Sign in as the next guy, and carry on.

&gt; &gt; All of this is helpful if you're going to play sock puppets, but I
&gt; &gt; have an even better suggestion.  Why not just be whoever you are?  It
&gt; &gt; simplifies your life by not requiring you to have all these identities
&gt; &gt; and to maintain them; it avoids confusing yourself.  Since sock
&gt; &gt; puppetry doesn't really accomplish much for you anyway, you don't lose
&gt; &gt; much.  In fact, by staying in character, you avoid all those
&gt; &gt; credibility-destroying moments when the curtain opens and people see a
&gt; &gt; man controlling the Wizard...

&gt; &gt; I would point out that a phrase like &quot;Internet tough guy&quot; sounds very
&gt; &gt; much like Saint.  Of course, no one has a monopoly on creative
&gt; &gt; language, but you don't find much of it on an NG.  Saint does use some
&gt; &gt; creative phrases, so when I see something like that, I immediately
&gt; &gt; suspect it's another Saint sock puppet.

&gt; &gt; Just some thoughts...

&gt; Nice. #1. You know WAY too much about sock puppets. #2. You know
&gt; NOTHING about me and are lying about me in public, and so therefore as
&gt; Rrock would say, you are a liar. #3. I do NOT use sock-puppets. I
&gt; certainly never would make any of the mistakes yu just mentioned
&gt; Johnson/Jones made. And thanks, yes, I AM creative at writing. At
&gt; least you don;t keep harping on that aspect. But no, again, I do NOT
&gt; use sock-puppets. and &quot;Internet tough guy?&quot; Please, I made up terms
&gt; like &quot;intergnats&quot; and words that have creative punch! I'm way more
&gt; Stephen Colbert to Boggle's Earnest Goes to the NG.

&gt; Saint
">

You are so busted it's not even funny - and you don't even know it
yet... and I hardly know where to begin...

It's not that I know so much about sock puppets, but that you know so
little, and yet try to play them.  If you're going to be deceptive,
you need to work a little harder.  Someone (maybe Mark Twain) said
something to the effect that it's better to tell the truth, because
then you don't have to remember what you said.  You might consider
that...

If you noticed, I was talking to Samuel Allen Jones when I posted my
comments.  I wasn't talking *to* you, and I wasn't talking *about*
you.  I was addressing all my comments to Jones, who was answering for
Johnson.  And now you're answering for Jones, claiming I'm telling
lies about you (as Saint).  You are making the exact same mistake that
&quot;Jones&quot; did, and accusing me of lying about you.  If you had followed
my advice, you might have avoided this humiliating error.

What the hell is anyone supposed to think about all this?  You are
denying playing a sock puppet, and objecting to the &quot;lies&quot; told about
you, in response to my comments to a different poster, in which I
never discussed you.  The only conclusions available are:

1.  You are a bare-faced liar who has no shame;
2.  You really don't know that you're taking on those other
identities.

Or maybe you'd like to take a crack at explaining how Jones replies to
comments addressed to Johnson (speaking as though the comments were
addressed to Jones); and then you reply to my comments to Jones, also
as though I had directly addressed you.  I'd love to hear you explain
this...

For the time being, I'll drop the &quot;multiple personality&quot; defense,
since it's not all that common, and you'd probably have some inkling
about it even if you didn't quite know all the details.  If at a later
date you explain that you do indeed suffer from this malady, I'll of
course adjust my thinking accordingly.

So, here you are playing sock puppets as Johnson, then come here as
Jones and react as though you were Johnson.  Then you post as Saint
and accuse me of lying about you, when in fact you are lying about not
using sock puppets.  Maybe you believe that &quot;a good defense is a good
offense&quot;, and that by attacking me you'll somehow appear to be
innocent.  But you totally flubbed this.  You posted as Saint, using
Jones's voice.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.  Use Jones voice, when responding
to comments addressed to him.

I guess your problem is that you can't readily tell who's responding
to whom, from your newsreader (or Google, whatever).  But you know
that I was impugning your honor, whoever you happened to be at the
time.  So - you responded to the accusations, forgetting that I wasn't
talking to Saint.  This is just plain sloppy.  You can do better than
that.

So yes, I was accusing you of using sock puppets, because you are
Jones as well as Johnson.  Whatever I say to them, I am saying to
you .  I know it, you know it, and now everyone in the world knows it,
because you goofed again.

Although I hinted at how to effectively play sock puppets, I really
think it's better for everyone involved if you don't try it.  Aside
from not having the requisite skill (and that's not necessarily an
insult; it's kind of like saying you're too honest to be a bank
robber), you really don't accomplish much with a sock puppet, except
maybe to confuse people (including, alas, yourself).  You are not cut
out for a life of &quot;crime&quot;, Saint.

In some ways, I know nothing about you, as you say; but in other ways,
I know a great deal about you.  I don't know your identity in the real
world, except what you've shared here (like being an artist, living in
Arizona, that sort of thing).  I do know many, if not all, of your
sock puppets.  I know that you have adamantly, steadfastly denied
using sock puppets, so consistently that I wonder whether you actually
know you do it (or whether you dissociate).  I know that you get
highly annoyed whenever someone criticizes you for real or imagined
flaws.  I know that you almost never admit to a mistake, and almost
never admit to being wrong about something (though, to be fair, you
*have* done both, rarely.  Examples are not easy to find, but they do
exist).

&quot;Intergnat&quot; is hardly an example of creative writing.  It is a poor
play on words, like your e-knucklehead or inter-fool, or whatever
those words were that you coined by putting an e- prefix in front of
some real word (or the 'inter-' prefix, or perhaps others).  E-
commerce, e-mail, e-this, e-that, it's not original.  &quot;Internet tough
guy&quot;, in my opinion, has a respectable originality to it, because it
brings to mind the posturing that occurs on these newsgroups, where
people have size 16 boots and can bend rebars with their bare hands
and stuff.  With that short phrase, you've captured this phenomenon.
Hats off to you...

But I don't care.  You've just confirmed that you are all three
personalities - Jones, Johnson, and Saint.  You've shown that you
either lie or are seriously unaware of some of your actions.   Take
your pick.  If you're dissociating, you might at least garner a few
sympathy votes.  Well, maybe not here... people here seem pretty set
in their ways.
