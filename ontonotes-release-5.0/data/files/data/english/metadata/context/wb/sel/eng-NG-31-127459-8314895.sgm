Shalom CAMERA E-Mail Team:

IN BRIEF:

On August 22, CNN aired Part Two, &quot;God's Muslim Warriors,&quot;
of its 3 part series, &quot;God's Warriors,&quot; hosted by Christiane Amanpour.
While much of the program was informative and fair (in contrast
to the propagandistic nature of Part One,&quot;God's Jewish
Warriors&quot;), there were serious flaws and glaring omissions, which
are described later in this alert.  Among the most important
shortcomings, extremist Muslim beliefs and practices were often
minimized and many of the key causes for the spread of Muslim
supremacist beliefs went unexplored.

Since so much of Part One was devoted to the
influence of pro-Israel activists in America, it was very
striking that Amanpour utterly neglected to report on the
powerful Oil Lobby, primarily Saudi-backed, and numerous other
Muslim organizations seeking to influence American public opinion
and foreign policy decisions.

There was a noticeably gentler and more cordial
tone toward Muslim extremists in contrast to the often snide and
hectoring tone displayed toward pro-Israel Americans and Israeli
settlers in &quot;God's Jewish Warriors.&quot; In &quot;God's Muslim Warriors,&quot;
Amanpour included two apolitical segments with appealing devout
Muslim women who talked about why they wear a head covering and
how Islam enriches their lives.  No such apolitical segment about
devout Jews appeared in &quot;God's Jewish Warriors.&quot;

A detailed analysis appears below the Action Items.

ACTION ITEMS:

WRITE TO A SPONSOR whose ad ran during the
&quot;God's Jewish Warriors&quot; program on August 21.  Tell the company
that you are disappointed that their product or service was
associated with &quot;God's Jewish Warriors,&quot; a program that bashed
Israel and unfairly smeared pro-Israel American Christians and
Jews as disloyal Americans.  Express concern that they tarnished
their reputation for integrity by sponsoring such a show and
encourage them to redirect their advertising dollars to more
journalistically professional networks.  Urge them to speak to
CNN about the program's lack of standards.

Remember, be polite!  They likely didn't choose
which exact show their ad would appear in, but they can certainly
chastise CNN for putting their ad in a shoddy show that angered
their customers!

IN DETAIL:

&quot;God's Jewish Warriors&quot; vs. &quot;God's Muslim Warriors&quot;

&quot;God's Muslim Warriors&quot; provided an informative
look at various segments of the Muslim world, how they view and
practice their faith, their thoughts on women's rights and the
role of religion in government, how some Muslims seek to bring
about the return of the Caliphate - a Muslim theocracy - and how
some Muslims are inspired to commit violence to further their
religious goals.  There were several Muslims interviewed who
spoke out against the Islamist extremism and the danger it poses
to moderate Muslims and to the West, and Amanpour did mention
that these people now had to have constant protection against
attacks from extremists.

The 3-part series,&quot;God's Warriors,&quot; is
ostensibly about the growing number of people around the world
who center their life around their religious beliefs and how they
want religious law to be the law of the land. Amanpour introduced
the series with:

&quot;Over the last 30 years, each faith has
exploded into a powerful political force, with an army of
followers who share a deep dissatisfaction with modern, secular
society and a fierce determination to bring God and religion back
into daily life, back to the seat of power. We call them 'God's
Warriors.' &quot;

Since there are very few Jews who are known to
want to create a modern day theocracy based on Jewish law, one
would assume that would leave Amanpour with a lot of time to
explore the beliefs, practices and life stories of devout Jews.
Or perhaps to discuss the tensions between religious and secular
Jews in Israel regarding religious influence on marriages,
divorces and Sabbath activities. One would assume wrong!

What is most striking about &quot;God's Muslim Warriors&quot; vs.
&quot;God's Jewish Warriors,&quot; is the different way Amanpour approaches
the two programs.  In the &quot;Jewish Warriors&quot;, Amanpour focuses
primarily on:

* blaming Israeli West Bank settlements (and their
supporters, called &quot;Jewish warriors&quot; repeatedly by Amanpour) for the
violence and discord in the Middle East and even for &quot;inflaming Muslims
worldwide,&quot; despite the fact that organized Muslim terror attacks against
Jews (and moderate Muslims) began in 1920, long before there were any
settlements in the West Bank. Long segments are devoted to discussing the
settlements' alleged illegality under international law and how Jews who
support or live in the settlements are allegedly defying international law.
Though authorities such as former Israeli Supreme Court Justice Meir Shamgar
and other international legal experts consider them legal, there is no
alternative legal expert cited.

* focusing on tiny fringe groups and the few individual
Jews who pursued terrorism.  They are so few in number that Amanpour had to
do stories on people who were involved in terror long ago and have since
renounced violence or on individuals who planned an unsuccessful attack.
Since these few Jewish terrorists are so widely condemned by the settlers
themselves and Jews worldwide, one wonders why she felt this topic was
relevant.

* presenting American pro-Israel activists as allegedly
all-powerful scheming bullies, distorting U.S. foreign policy contrary to
American interests and ganging up on anyone who criticizes Israel.

Meanwhile, in &quot;God's Muslim Warriors,&quot; even though Muslim
extremists number in the millions and there have been thousands of terror
attacks by Muslims across the globe, Amanpour provides very little context
on the scope of the violence.  A few terrorist attacks are highlighted,
similar to the few terrorist attacks that were highlighted in Part One.

She has playful discussions with spokesmen of Islamist
groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood.  She points out that they are
striving to create a theocracy, but says they are non-violent and makes no
mention that they are deeply anti-Semitic, anti-American and support terror
attacks on Israelis and violence against Americans in Iraq.

In Part One, Amanpour refers again and again -- 20
times -- to &quot;Jewish warriors,&quot; clearly a pejorative term in the context of
the series.  The effect is striking, even jarring, as viewers are reminded
time and again that there are distinctly Jewish warriors who present a
threat to the world -- expansionists whose &quot;settlements have inflamed much
of the Muslim world.&quot; (Never mind that among those labeled a &quot;Jewish
warrior&quot; is Chanan Porat, a religious Jew residing in the West Bank who
explicitly states that &quot;religious belief as a fuel for violence is wrong.&quot;)

Amanpour also freely uses the term &quot;warriors&quot; in Part Two
of the series, but with a difference; she much less frequently directly
pairs &quot;warrior&quot; with &quot;Muslim.&quot; Thus, while Amanpour harps on &quot;Jewish
warriors,&quot; repeating the phrase 20 times in the first episode, she refers to
&quot;Muslim warriors&quot; just four times in the second program. Why does she utter
the words &quot;Jewish warrior&quot; five times more often than &quot;Muslim warrior&quot; when
violent Muslims have inflicted thousands of times more death and destruction
in the world than violent Jews have?

Amanpour devotes two segments (one each) to two young
Muslim women who are not described as being involved in anything political,
who simply speak about why they wear a head covering, and how Islam enriches
their lives.  There is no such segment in the Jewish episode.

What would have been an appropriate counter-part to
American Muslim Rehan Seyam speaking about how her hijab is a public
statement of her faith and her belief in the importance of modesty?  Perhaps
an American Jewish man talking about why he wears a kippah and how Judaism
enriches his life.  Or a Jewish woman who wears modest clothing, covers her
hair and finds comfort and spiritual meaning in her religion.

And in contrast to the huge focus on the so-called &quot;Israel
Lobby&quot; in &quot;God's Jewish Warriors,&quot; in &quot;God's Muslim Warriors,&quot; Amanpour
doesn't mention the powerful Oil Lobby operating in America and advocating
for Muslim, Arab and Palestinian perspectives.  She doesn't highlight any of
the numerous activist Muslim/Arab organizations that lobby and propagandize
to influence American public opinion and foreign policy.

Related to this is the minimal discussion or outright
omission of several key factors in the rise of Islamist extremism and
increased support for terror:

- thousands of Saudi-funded mosques and schools built
worldwide, including many in the U.S., that spread an extreme supremacist
form of Islam.  Saudi Arabia has also funded extremist training for those
who want to work as Muslim chaplains in the U.S. military and the U.S.
prison system.

- Saudi-funded Middle East Studies chairs and departments
in universities all over the world, including the U.S.

- Saudi-funded organizations whose goal is to provide
American elementary, middle and high schools with slanted curricula and
books about the history of the Middle East and Islam

- Saudi-funded student activists and organizations that
indoctrinate and propagandize against Israel, the U.S. and for extreme
Islamist causes.

- extremist websites, online videos, and satellite TV
networks that foster Muslim supremacist values and support for terrorism
among Muslims across the globe.

Instead of examining any of the above reasons
for the
spread of Muslim extremism, Amanpour includes two highly questionable
explanations:  reactions to alleged Israeli brutality and feelings of
hopelessness.  She commendably does mention repressive Arab/Muslim
governments as a factor, but doesn't note how these same governments often
intentionally use propaganda to fan the flames of hatred for Israel and the
West to deflect attention away from their repressive regimes.

FLAWS

While overall, &quot;God's Muslim Warriors&quot; is informative and
covers a number of vital topics, there are several flaws:

* Amanpour's description of the Muslim Brotherhood as
non-violent:

&quot;But the group has now officially renounced violence and
today's Supreme Guide claims it was never condoned.&quot;

But this isn't true.  According to translations of
articles by MEMRI, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Muhammad
Mahdi Othman Akef stated &quot;...the bombings in Palestine and Iraq are a
[religious] obligation. This is because these two countries are occupied
countries, and the occupier must be expelled in every way possible. Thus,
the [Muslim Brotherhood] movement supports martyrdom operations in Palestine
and Iraq in order to expel the Zionists and the Americans.&quot;  &quot;If the gates
of Jihad in Palestine open before the [Muslim] Brotherhood, we will not
hesitate a single moment, and we will be with them on the battlefield.&quot; &quot;In
Israel, there should be no [differentiation between] a civilian and a member
of the military. All are enemies of the Arab homeland and of Islam. They are
occupiers and have no right to one handsbreadth of the land of Palestine.&quot;
&quot;We have no relations with the U.S. It is a Satan that abuses the region,
lacking all morality and law.&quot; (Memri Special Dispatch Series #655, Feb 4,
2004)  Akef has also stated that the Holocaust is &quot;a myth.&quot; (BBC News, Dec
23, 2005)

* Lack of examination of how widespread support for
terrorism is in the Muslim world (other than a mention of one poll about
American Muslims). Amanpour says, &quot;Muslims, like people everywhere, abhor
terrorism. The small minority who resort to violence is symptomatic of
something many of us have failed to understand.&quot;

While it would certainly be accurate and fair to say that
not all Muslims support terror, it is questionable to imply that all Muslims
&quot;abhor terrorism&quot; and a small number are compelled to &quot;resort&quot; to violence.
According to the Pew Global Attitudes Project poll published on July 24,
2007, the percentage of those surveyed in predominantly Muslim countries who
agreed that &quot;suicide bombing and other forms of violence against civilian
targets are never justified&quot; ranged from only 6% (Palestinian Authority) to
77% (Indonesia).  That leaves a significant number of Muslims who don't
appear to &quot;abhor terrorism.&quot;

After all, most of the winning candidates in the most
recent Palestinian legislative election are members of Hamas, a terrorist
organization.  And who can forget the Palestinians who celebrated in the
streets when America was attacked on 9/11? Amanpour herself notes that if
Egypt were to hold elections today, the Muslim Brotherhood would &quot;win, hands
down&quot;.  And the Brotherhood praises the terrorists murdering Jews in Israel.

* There was also a lack of appropriate follow-up to some
inaccurate or highly questionable statements, such as that made by Taji
Mustafa, spokesperson for Hizb Ut-Tahrir, an Islamist organization:

&quot;Under Islamic rule, under the caliphate, there was
stability even in Palestine. Jews, Christians, Muslims lived in harmony
under an Islamic political order.&quot;

Under Islamic rule, non-Muslims lived a life of severe
discrimination, humiliation and fear. While some years were more peaceful
than others, violence against Jews was a constant thread in the fabric of
life under Islamic rule.  Discrimination included being forced to wear a
special tag on their clothing identifying them as non-Muslims, paying a
special tax required of non-Muslims, deferring to Muslims in all situations,
such as moving off the sidewalk into the dung-filled street if a Muslim
approached where they were walking.  In court, the testimony of a Muslim
would always be accepted over that of a non-Muslim. For more info and
