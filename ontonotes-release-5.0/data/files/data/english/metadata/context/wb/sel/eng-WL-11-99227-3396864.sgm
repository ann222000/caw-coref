The Venerable Bede's simile of the sparrow:

"Talis", inquiens, "mihi veditur, rex, vita hominum praesens in terris ad conparationem eius quod nobis incertum est temporis, quale cum te residente ad caenam cum ducibus ac ministris tuis tempore brumali, accenso quidem foco in medio et calido effecto cenaculo, furentibus autem foris per omnia turbinibus hiemalium pluuiarum vel nivium, adveniens unus passerum domum citissime pervolaverit, qui cum per unum ostium ingrediens mox per aliud exierit, ipso quidem tempore quo intus est hiemis tempeste non tangitur, sed tamen parvissimo spatio serenitatis ad momentum excurso, mox de hieme in hiemem regradiens tuis oculis elabitur. Ita haec vita hominum ad mediducm apparet: quit autem sequantur quidque praecesserit prorsus ignoramus."

"This," he added," is how the present life of man on Earth, King, appears to me in comparison with that time which is unknown to us. As when you are feasting with your ealdormen and thegns in winter time; the fire is burning on the hearth in the middle of the hall and inside is warm, while outside the winter storms of rain and snow are raging, and a sparrow files swiftly through the hall. It enters at one door and quickly flies out through the other door. For the few moments it is inside, the storms and tempest cannot touch it, but after the briefest moment of calm, it flits back out of sight, out of the wintry storm and into it again So too the lives of men appear but for a moment; what follows or what came before, we know not at all."

Puts me in mind of To Build a Fire:

He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty-odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man's frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man's place in the universe . . . .The cold of space smote the unprotected tip of the planet, and he, being on that unprotected tip, received the full force of the blow. The blood of his body recoiled before it.

Great Story! But I think Bede's emphasis was on the swiftness of the swallow not on the cold of the storm.
