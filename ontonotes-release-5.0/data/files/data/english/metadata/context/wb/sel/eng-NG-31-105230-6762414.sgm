SECURITY REPORT CARD : US
Government Gets C-, Defense Department Fails
The
feds' report card comes in, and they may want to hide this one from Mom and
Dad.

Eight
US government agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Treasury, and
the Nuclear Regulatory Agency, got failing grades Thursday on their annual
computer security report card.

Overall,
for 2006 the government got a C- grade, which actually is up slightly from the
last three years when it received a grade of D+, D+, and D. A third of the
agencies received an F, while the same number received between an A- and an A+.

Rep.
Tom Davis, R-Va., ranking member of the House Government Oversight and Reform
Committee, presented the report card for the performance of the 24 agencies
covered by the Federal Information Security Management Act.

"This
grade indicates slow but steady improvement from past years," Davis said
in a written statement. "Obviously, challenges remain. But there are some
excellent signs of progress in this year's report, and that's
encouraging."

The
grades are derived from annual reports the agencies produce to comply with the
management act, which was passed in 2002. Agencies are rated on annual tests of
information security, whether they certify and accredit their systems as
secure, how well they manage the configuration of their computers, how they
detect and react to security breaches, their training programs, and the
accuracy of their inventories.

The
departments of Justice and Housing and Urban Development showed the most
improvement. Justice went from a D in 2005 to an A- for 2006, while HUD went
from a D+ to an A+. The Department of Health and Human Services also made great
gains, going from an F to a B last year.

On
the other side of the balance sheet, though, NASA dropped from a B- in 2005 to
a D- in 2006. The Department of Education also slipped from a C- to an F.

The
Department of Homeland Security, which is tasked with protecting the United
States from terrorist attacks, got a D for its computer security efforts.
That's up from 2005, though, when the department got a failing grade. The State
Department, along with the departments of Defense, Education, and Treasury,
also failed.

The
Department of Veterans Affairs, which has been plagued with computer and data
losses, didn't make its report available.

"It's
disturbing that some of the agencies with the most sensitive information
continue to score poorly on this," said Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, in a
written statement. "The Department of Defense, the Department of State and
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission need to improve."

Alan
Paller, director of research for the SANS Institute, said in a statement that
this scorecard process is a positive effort that could lead to meaningful
change.

"By
using the congressional grading process and thoughtful leadership to place high
priority on the most critical security initiatives, Rep. Davis is helping agencies
focus on stopping the increasingly sophisticated attackers," he said.
"It could have a profound effect if changes in congressional focus and
grading provide the necessary incentive to persuade agencies to implement new
secure configurations faster and more broadly."

TOM & JERRY : Bloggers'
search for anonymity

The
internet has given the individual unprecedented power to reach out to millions
but some governments are cautious, even hostile, to giving their citizens free
access to ideas they deem too democratic and dangerous.

Cuba,
Egypt, Tunisia: they are all popular with holiday makers but they also censor
and even lock up journalists and bloggers.

This
is why the media rights group, Reporters Without Borders, has published The
Handbook for Bloggers and Cyber-Dissidents.

"There
is another side to the picture post-card," said Robert Menard, secretary
general, Reporters Without Borders. "There are around 100 people in jail
in Tunisia and the entire media is controlled by the powers that be and there
are bloggers who have been locked up just for criticizing the Tunisian
president."

In
many countries a journalism student covering a demonstration of school children
would be commended for his initiative.

In
Syria, student Mesud Hamid posted photos on the net of Kurdish pupils demanding
equal rights. He was arrested while taking an exam at university.

"I
was tortured," he said. "For one year and three months I was held in
a cell measuring one metre by two. I didn't see the sun or sky for all that time."

Mr
Hamid has since fled to France.

Remaining
anonymous

So
what do you do if you want to escape detection from authorities who might not
like your work as much as you do?

The
Handbook for Bloggers and Cyber-Dissidents is pretty technical but it also
contains some simple tips, so you can say what you think without having to
worry the censors or cyber-police too much.

"The
first thing is don't write anything under your real name," said Julien
Pain of Reporters Without Borders.

"Even
if you are using a pen name, then you have to be careful because the
authorities can track you down on the internet."

You
might be tight-lipped about who you are, but your computer is screaming your
presence all over the net.

All
net-connected computers get assigned an IP address - which ensures that they
data you request is sent to the right place.

It
can let people know which websites you have visited, which e-mails you have
sent and which articles you have posted. But if you are clever you can cover
your tracks.

"If
you want to protect your anonymity you can use a proxy, using a proxy is very
simple. Anybody can do it even if you're not a geek," said Mr Pain.

Now
there are two ways you can do this. An open proxy is essentially a computer,
based elsewhere on the web, through which you can surf, send e-mails or post
articles anonymously.

You
have to change your IP address to one listed on various sites and, in principle
you should be able to work anonymously.

"In
principle", because open proxies can also be used by hackers, so
administrators often block them after a few days.

Another
option might be a web-based proxy site abroad like Anonymouse or ProxyLord.
They are going down well among surfers and bloggers in China.

"The
authorities would not be able to trace the IP because you're doing this through
a proxy site, and that's probably the most efficient way now for the readers in
China now to visit officially blocked websites," explained Xiaorong Li, a
research professor at the University of Maryland.

Proxies
have their drawbacks as they can be blocked.

But
for a very effective, albeit technical way of staying anonymous you could use
The Onion Router (TOR). This is so called because the data it sends between
computers is encrypted in successive layers like an onion. The data also takes
an unpredictable path through all the proxies making up the TOR network.

Each
proxy peels off a layer of encryption, revealing the next proxy it has to go
to. Intercept the message at any point and the identities of both sender and recipient
are protected. Not until it arrives, can the message be read.

Firewall of
China

There
are less technical ways of avoiding censorship. In China filters seek out
specific words that the authorities consider contentious.

The
mere mention of Tiananmen Square would be enough to get you noticed. But you
may, however, be able to fox the filters.

"If
you want to put the words June 4th, you put a comma or a period in between June
and 4th, so they are not one phrase and that enables this word to evade detection
through the filter, because the filter works by phrases: June 4th or
1989," explained Xiaorong Li.

"If
you put some kind of punctuation between the words they become not a phrase but
readers can perfectly understand what you are saying."

There
is no sure-fire way of staying anonymous on the web and avoiding detection. But
if you are careful about what you do, you can cut down your chances of being
caught up by the cyber-police.

Top EVIDENCE : This is How We Catch You Downloading

All
over Europe thousands of people are being threatened with court action for
allegedly sharing games like Dream Pinball 3D on P2P networks. Now, documents
obtained by TorrentFreak show details of the anti-piracy companys techniques
for identifying alleged file-sharers on the internet and the gathering of
claimed forensic quality evidence for use in court cases.

Evidence

In
March we reported in some detail about the case of 500 UK file-sharers being
legally pursued following claims that they uploaded games from the German
publisher Zuxxez onto file-sharing networks.

Since
then, many people have been in touch with the law firm who sent the threatening
letters, demanding evidence that they actually did something. TorrentFreak has
obtained copies of the latest letters and within the claimed evidence is a
description of how the anti-piracy system used by Logistep AG (the company
hired to track the alleged pirates) is supposed to work.

The
cleverly named File Sharing Monitor is the system being used by Logistep to
gather evidence against file-sharers. It is actually just a modified version of
the Shareaza P2P application that is configured to search for infringing files,
and collect the information from the hosts that share these files.

The
File Sharing Monitor only targets Gnutella and eDonkey users, so it is still
unclear how they track down BitTorrent users.

Here is how it
works:

1.
The client connects to the P2P network, searches for sources of the infringing
file, and collects the IP addresses that were gathered through the search.
2.
The client requests to download (a piece of) the file from the host that was
found through the search.
3.
The filename, file size, IP-address, P2P protocol, P2P application, time, and
the username are automatically inserted into a database, if the host permits
the download.
4.
This is the best part. The application does a WHOIS search for the ISP
information and automatically sends an infringement letter to the ISP if
needed.

The
claim is that the File Sharing Monitor is totally foolproof and that it can
provide forensic-quality information to a court in order that file-sharers be
punished. The question remains whether an IP-address is sufficient evidence to
sue a person for downloading copyrighted material. Recent cases suggest that
the RIAA and the MPAA will need more evidence than that.

Here
is the evidence for the functioning of the Logistep system. You decide.

Top DIY : Do-it-yourself data destruction
By

For
some reason, a lot of IT folks love to try some pretty wacky stuff for
themselves. The area of data destruction is no exception.

Our
research has unearthed a few methods suggested or used by your peers to destroy
such storage media as hard disks, tapes and CDs. Some of these methods are
entertaining, but the obvious caveats apply to others: They involve potentially
dangerous or harmful substances and activities that are likely to raise the
hackles of hard-working OSHA, HazMat or EPA personnel. (Some even may be
downright illegal in your jurisdiction.)
Bash
it.

Whether
for its adrenalin rush or the mere simplicity of the solution, many sources
like the idea of wielding a sledgehammer on the hard disk they want to destroy.
The goal is to smash the heads into the disk platter, which probably will break
the mechanism, letting them get at the data. Once the hard disk is out of the computer
(an important first step), smacking it with a sledgehammer on the large side of
the drive about four or five times should do the trick. An automated device
that can crush the drive is the Hard Disk Crusher from EDR Solutions.

Heat it.

In
his blog on the "Ten Commandments of Data Destruction," security
expert Robert J. Hansen suggests heating the drive past the Curie point, the
temperature at which metal loses its magnetic properties.

Smelt it.

Some
IT folks with access to a kiln (or a smelting operation), suggest melting hard
disk drives down to slag.

Microwave it.

Jesse
Kornblum, a computer forensics researcher with ManTech SMA, says one way to
destroy CDs is to put one or two (not more) in the microwave for two seconds.
"It may make a lot of sparks and stink for about five minutes," he
cautions. Proceed with caution here: Kornblum assumes no responsibility for
potential damage to the microwave.

Shred it.

Shredding
such storage media as tapes, hard drives, CDs and cell phones can be performed by
Data Killers or other third-party service providers. It's possibly not as
exciting as melting or bashing it yourself, but you may be able to make some
cool techno-artwork out of the shredded particulate that remains (if you
request a sample before it goes to the smelter or metal recycler).

Dismantle
and Demagnetize It. ZATZ Publishing's David Gewirtz decided to take matters
into his own hands when it came time to dispose of old drives after the company
moved to a new location. He took them apart piece by piece, then used their own
magnets to demagnetize the disk platters.

Top New IT Term of the day
shadowing
A technique used to increase a computer's speed by
using high-speed RAM memory in place of slower ROM memory (RAM is about three
times as fast as ROM). On PCs, for example, all code to control hardware
devices, such as keyboards, is normally executed in a special ROM chip called
the BIOS ROM. However, this chip is slower than the general-purpose RAM that
comprises main memory. Many PC manufacturers, therefore, configure their PCs to
copy the BIOS code into RAM when the computer boots. The RAM used to hold the
BIOS code is called shadow RAM.
