I won't give free press to the actual vendor of cell phones but I just
saw this TV ad with some guys in a 900 convertible which seems to have
crashed into, and more importantly, gotten stuck under the back end of a
big rig- which is merrily making it's way down the freeway.

Sparks flow, parts fall off, guys start screaming when the rear axle
flys away- but nobody will call for help because of high cell charges or
something.

Sad as it is too see a nice car get trashed, it was funny as hell.

Could you somehow get me a screenshot so I can add it to my website?

It was especially funny because it was the rear axle that falls off even
though it was a FWD (classic 900).

I half-noticed a movie trailer for 'Sideways' (think it's been out in the
States for ages but we're only just seeing it here in Blighty).  Seems to be
a road movie, also featuring a c900 conv.  Seems this one gets crashed (into
a tree) too.   Why can't movie makers trash crap cars instead?  I can't
watch The Italian Job without crying (the original one of course, I simply
can't watch the remake, period!)

Ah, but if you get the DVD, they say hat the Dino was a wreck from a
breakers yard and it didn't even have an engine in it. Piy the Aston
and the E-Types were real though. I share your tears. :-)

Aston? E-Types?  I was talking about the Mini Coopers.  If there's one car I
love more than a Saab, it's a proper 60's Cooper S.

But yes, I suppose it was a bit of a pity about the others!

New advert for the 93 Aero is pretty cool.  Following vapour trails along a
city road and up onto a dual carriageway/motorway/freeway you come across
the said vehicle and the tag line talks about SAABs aircraft design heritage
helping them to stick a car to the road...

Very good.

Not so sure. What is the message? That the car can drive in a straight line
and doesn't fly off the road? I would have thought that was the least you
would expect from a car.

It's been a good few years since I've owned a car that's burned that
much oil :o)

There was a Volvo ad on quite a while ago that made me smile. A bloke
driving a Volvo came across a stretch of road that was teeming with
crabs, all scuttling about.

The car handled so badly that, despite desperate and repeated
swerving, he completely failed to hit any of them!

Cheers,

Colin.
