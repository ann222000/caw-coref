I wonder if folks would mind sharing what attracted them to antiques in
the first place?

For me, I admit it was first catching the English version of Antiques Road
Show on television. Until that moment I had never given antiques a second
thought. Now I am hooked on the American version of the show, and spend
every other weekend plundering antique malls, rarely buying anything, just
enjoying the range of stuff in the world and the people I meet there.

My wife thinks my interest is a reaction to my upbringing. We were a very
mobile family when I was growing up, one which often left anything that
didn't fit in the car behind. So I have no heirlooms, no family things
around my house. Nor have we ever been collectors. She thinks I'm looking
for my heritage or something. (She talks this way a lot, but I love her
anyway.)

Since falling for this subject, I find I've become a collector of books
about antiques. I have neither the budget nor the inclination to go on a
buying spree for pottery, or steins, or what-have-you yet. Rather, I am
fascinated by the breadth of knowledge antiquers (if that's a word) show
about furniture and lamps and glass and such. I think it must be
wonderful to know so much about something.

So I'm curious.

Strange, isn't it? There's probably a lot of different reasons we're
attracted to old things.

For me, it started out in archeology (even got my degree in it) - I was
attracted to the past for the usual esoteric reason (the old, &quot;We can't
know where we're going unless we know where we've been,&quot; bit). I then
spent 20 years in the RL (real world) as an accountant dealing with all
the mundane P&amp;L, Balance Sheet stuff, with the occasional purchase of
some &quot;old thing&quot; or another.

Then, when I got injured in '93 and could no longer be an accountant
(yippee!), I started getting more interested in collecting. Maybe
because I no longer lived near my relatives I had to make my home remind
me more of &quot;home.&quot; Little by little, the particleboard was replace by
real wood furniture, I got rid of my supermarket coupon dinnerware and
replaced it with old (S&amp;H green stamp and soap box) dinnerware and some
nice English pieces, and a hobby was born.

Now that most of my injuries are about as good as they're going to get,
I'm selling almost as much as I'm buying, and I use &quot;that online place&quot;
to do most of my selling. And I'm selling enough now to make me think
that I might be able to make a living (again) selling this stuff that I
love if I can just get the volume up. That would allow me to collect the
things I want, pay some bills and have some fun - what could be better?

Have fun, Michele

"/> When I was about eleven years old I started working on the neighbors farm. I
worked hard and got a few dollars a week. Mom would take us to the little old
lady who sold glassware in her garage and we would pick out a piece of green
glass. Before long my sisters and I could set a whole table with it and boy
were we proud!
Next I was exposed to auctions. I remember one auction where I sort of
hung around and watched. Near the end there were all these boxes of (probably
worthless) glassware that no one wanted. The auctioneer pointed at me and
said....I bet this young lady would pay a dime for the box! (I was maybe 12).
Well, of course! I bought that box and a few more. Oh, the power! Oh, the
adreneline rush! I was hooked forever more.

"/> For me, it seems to be a combination of art and voyeurism.

I like to see a beautifully-designed chair, bowl, or hat. I have trouble
understanding why anybody ever buys a new piece of furniture (other than
computer tables and lazyboys) for $500 when they could get a really
well-made, solid, interesting old piece for the same amount with just a
little patience. And I love to see how fashions come and go and change
through time. I'm too close to the present to see it clearly.

And I have to confess that I'm fascinated at other ways of being than
1998 college-town middle class. A good estate auction (or even garage
sale) lets me construct my own character sketch of the people who owned
those objects. Having spanned the times from privies, crank phones, and
kerosene lanterns to voice mail and phones you can actually lose because
they aren't attached to the wall, I am endlessly curious about how people
did things in daily life.

With my own major field of collecting, dolls from 1900-1930, both come
into play. I like them as works of art, and as clues to how people
looked at childhood and the human form. But after that, an almost
superstitious feeling of connection takes over. It's why I don't care
for the &quot;mint in the box&quot; kind of doll (even if they were available in my
time frame). I love to feel connected to the child who rubbed the paint
off the nose.

A friend once shuddered, &quot;I can't see how you can stand to have to dead
people's things in your house.&quot; I can't see how she can stand not to.

When I was about 10 years old, my buddy and I got into an old turn of
the century hotel that had been abandoned for 20 or 30 years. We made
our way into the basement where all the old dishes still were. I can
still remember the crystal and fine porcelin in rotting old cardboard
boxes strewn all over the floor. On each piece was the insignia of the
hotel &quot;The Sunset Hotel&quot;. There were huge crystal platters of a pattern
I can still remember, (but have never traced). And what do you think a
couple of 10 year old kids would do with all that treasure? Why we went
home and got our pellet guns, returned, and had a grand time shooting
all of them. The large platters would only chip when we hit them so they
became frisbees. About 6 yrs. later I saw a single plate in the local
antique dealer's window with a surprisingly high price on them, and it
kinda dawned on me what we destroyed. Since then, I've been interested
in antiques and the value of what, in my young ignorance I had
destroyed.

I've been wracking my feeble brain, trying to remember WHEN I
became interested in antiques. I've decided that it's inbred to
some extent - not that I grew up with wonderful stuff or anything
like that, but because &quot;old stuff&quot; was just how our home (and
those of our relatives) were decorated.

When I got my first apartment, I bought &quot;old things&quot; at thrift
shops (and if there had been a rec.antiques at that time, I'd
be one of those people asking newbie questions.)

Since the time I've set up housekeeping and throughout our
marriage, my husband and I have purchased various antiques
for our home. After many years, I had lots of things packed
away that didn't fit the current decor.

A friend began selling antiques at shows -- and I got &quot;hooked.&quot;
My first sales stock was comprised of many of the things I'd
packed away -- and like first-time show dealers do, I put ridiculously
LOW prices on them (the prices I'd PAID for the items.) I felt
such gratification having the money back, but it took only about
90 minutes for me to realize that the other dealers were selling
my things for much more. (See, I told you I started stupidly.)

So....that event began my quest for information and purchase
of hundreds of books relating to various items.

Even though we recently redecorated our living room in new (gasp!)
furniture, the rest of the home is still &quot;old stuff.&quot; Our various
collections are the decoration in the kitchen and TV room - as well
as in the living room's new glass cabinets. (Of course, we were
very careful to buy classic-styled furniture that won't go out of
style.)

At one time, I wanted to have a shop. But after retiring from my
US Government job five years ago, I decided it'd be awhile
before I worked full-time at anything. It's still going to be &quot;awhile,&quot;

I guess. But we sell at antique shows and online, and still
spend time seeking out fun things either for ourselves or for
resale to others.

It's an illness, I tell you.

Kris

Hi---
Gee, I just sort of &quot;grew up with antiques&quot;.
My grandmother used to rescue &quot;old stuff&quot;
from her father-in-law's barn, so my daughter
now has an exquisite spool-turned walnut
cradle that my mom, I, she &amp; her brother &amp;
now HER babies have slept in. I grew up
surrounded by &quot;family heirlooms&quot;. Is kinda
interesting, because my kids did NOT rebel
against this, but just dropped right into line.
When my son married, he &amp; new bride
went shopping for furniture. After the 3rd
store, he took her aside &amp; explained to her
that MOST of what they had seen was &quot;junk&quot;
&amp; that they should buy antiques---it at least
kept its value over time!!

I, too, grew up with these things all over. My grandmother collected
Fiesta since the 60's. My aunts collected depression and cut glass. And
my mom bought old furniture to restore, because that's all we could afford.
I started collecting bubblegum machine premiums and it was really exciting
when with one twist, you
could get two premiums. I then started collecting stamps and political
buttons. By the time I was married, we inherited a bunch of oak furniture
and glassware,
and then it got out of control. Once my children were school age, I opened
my
own shop with my mother and now I sell online too. With the time spent in
a shop, I really feel its' easier and alot more fun sitting here selling
off a computer.

I wantedto reply because you see what I see. I love the vast amount of
knowledge that you can tap into when you start learning about antiques. I
just quit nursing, and one of the things I had always liked about it was that
you never could master the subject. The body and stuff that can happen to it
are just to big to ever fully know. So, no boredom. And every night I went to
work I learned something new. And I really liked that and thought I'd miss it
if I ever left nursing. Until I opened my antique shop. Talk about a vast
topic...there is NO end to what you can and should learn. And much to my
delight I learn new stuff everyday from my customers, from all the books I'm
gathering, and yes, from rec. antiques. Anyway, it works that way for me. And
I love it. Tina

"/>  Excellent topic, Don...

I have always been around antiques since my folks have bought and sold for
many years. I can't say I paid much attention as a child, except I noticed
our stuff was different from my friends parents stuff. We are a Scot-Irish
family that immigrated during the great wave. We've been buying secondhand
since. Interestingly there has been a long succession in a our family of
&quot;knockers&quot; and traveling tinkers. We basically saw opportunity in recycling
and have had a knack for it. Being poor, made us appreciate an object that
continued to serve over a great deal of time. Being Scottish bred a
frugalness that blends nicely with the antiques world. Antiques give me the
opportunity of being in tune with my heritage. It simply fits... John

"/> I agree with that!! I think what I enjoy the most about antiques is the
research. (Although the shopping is a very close second!) I realized a
while back that I'm usually at my most content sitting with a glass of
iced tea and a pile of reference books trying to figure something out.
I've learned more about history handling old things than I ever learned
in school.

I've been wandering second-hand stores since I was a child. It seems
like I've always collected something. I'm attracted to anything that
sparkles, so I always head right for the glass then for the rhinestone
jewelry. If it's pretty or interesting it jumps into my arms and I have
to take it home.

Like most collectors, I eventually had to send a few pieces to a new
home. When I sold a few items and the buyers were utterly thrilled to
take home my treasures, I really enjoyed it. And of course one thing
lead to another, and a small business was born. I just love finding the
right something for the right someone and introducing them to each
other.

I think collecting is just in the blood. Either you have the disease or
you don't, and either way it's almost impossible to change.

I just thought of another reason I like antiques! I like the recycling
aspect of it. Not just the environmental aspects of it, but the thought
that something that is old and still beautiful is _not_ thrown away just
because the current owner can't use it, but given or sold to someone
else who can enjoy it for many more years to come (before they give it
away or sell it).

On the environmental aspects - think of all the trees we've saved each
and every time we buy antique furniture. Think of the kiln energy _not_
used every time one of us buys some more antique dinnerware or
glassware! I think it's kinda neat! Even when we ship, many of us re-use
boxes and shipping material!

Have fun, Michele

great way to decorate your home and make it different from every other on the
block. Don't tell anyone; but decorating and collecting with antiques can be
cheaper than buying new. Antiques are a good investment and a wonderful way to
learn your history. Give me an antique that increases in value any day as
opposed to a new item that depreciates the minute you take it out of the store.
My collections are constantly evolving as I learn and upgrade.
