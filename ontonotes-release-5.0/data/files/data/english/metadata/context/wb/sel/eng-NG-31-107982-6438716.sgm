I have just set up a small site about the Viking Raids seen through Postage
Stamps. It has nothing -- at least not much ;-) -- to do with arts, but
provides a pleasant break from the traditional collecting areas.

http://vikings.heindorffhus.dk

The site being intended for attracting the youth to philately in a limited
collecting area within the reach of everybody, all the material shown is
modern, and readily available to anyone interested. I hope, all the same,
that also adult collectors will take pleasure in browsing through. Please
take your seats and enjoy a colourful journey through the last centuries of
the first millennium :-)

Dear Mette,

also the USA honored the vikings with two stamps:

1925, SC 621 (A185, Viking ship), 5 c dark blue (sorry, no scan available of
my own).

1968 Leif Ericson, SC 1359 (A781 Leif Ericson by A. Stirling Calder) 6 c
light grey brown and black brown (sorry, also no scan available of my own).

You will get scans, I am sure :-)

Kind regards

Gerhard

Hello Gerhard,

Thanks for your applause, and also thanks everyone else and the many
visitors who have contacted me privately about this new site. It is always
good to know that others are interested in what I am doing ;-)

What concerns the US-stamp (1968 - Sc.1359)  for Leif Erikson, it is already
online on this page
http://vikings.heindorffhus.dk/frame-Canada.htm
which is listed in the navigation in the section about the Norwegian Vikings
in Iceland. I have found it appropriate to place it there, simply because
the Vikings did not settle in the US, but "only" in what is today known as
Canada.

I will search my collections for the US-stamp (1925 - Sc.621), and it may
well be "somewhere" in my huge accumulations! If not, I must rely on kind
visitors' contributions ;-)

Mette

Hello Mette:

The Norse-American issue (1925) promoted the Norse American
Centennial in St. Paul, Minnesota which began on June 8, 1925.
The two cent stamp was issued to meet the regular mail rate and
the five cent stamp to cover most foreign mail, including letters to
Norway.

The illustration on the two cent stamp is an artist's rendition of
what the ship "Restaurationen" probably looked like based on a
drawing of its sister ship. In 1825, the Restaurationen was the
first ship to bring Norwegian immigrants to America.

http://cjoint.com/data/bqsLHiexjM.htm

The design on the five cent stamp is from a photograph of an exact
size replica of an ancient Viking ship that sailed from Norway to
Chicago in time for the Columbian Exposition of 1893. So faithful
were the engravers to the photograph from which the stamp's design
was made, that a flag of the United States is seen waving from the
bow of the ship!

G'day Mette,
I think Cody will enjoy your site :)
I am only half way through.

Here are a couple of images that may be of interest,
from a Wessex man, who managed to keep you bloodthirsty lot at bay :)
and without King Harold, possibly Christianity would not have survived
in Great Britain.

http://cjoint.com/data/bquO1zOiQn.htm

and a fellow that goes by the engaging name of "Eric Bloodaxe"
http://cjoint.com/data/bquXT2GGWh.htm
a defeat anniversary :)

There are lots more Vikings on labels Ajman, Lundy, Shetlands etc,
could not find any from Eire, though.
Cheers and well done.

Well I'm not sure if you can copyright slogans :) but acknowledgement to:
but the "Hastings"  image was lifted from a circa 1960's book,
"Discovering British Postage Stamps" by C.W.Hill.
(no ISBN available scribbled over by kids, some pages missing)

The text suggests that in 1963 British Post announced
that as well as advertising local events and anniversaries,
towns could also advertise local tourist attractions.
There was a flood of replies, and "Hastings" was the first
tourist attraction slogan accepted.
It features a local cartoon character "Happy Harold"

Best Regards,
Rod.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; G'day Rod,
&gt;&gt; Thanks!  Very interesting -- will be uploaded tomorrow with credits to
&gt;&gt; you

&gt; Well I'm not sure if you can copyright slogans :) but acknowledgement to:
&gt; but the &quot;Hastings&quot;  image was lifted from a circa 1960's book,
&gt; &quot;Discovering British Postage Stamps&quot; by C.W.Hill.
&gt; (no ISBN available scribbled over by kids, some pages missing)

&gt; The text suggests that in 1963 British Post announced
&gt; that as well as advertising local events and anniversaries,
&gt; towns could also advertise local tourist attractions.
&gt; There was a flood of replies, and &quot;Hastings&quot; was the first
&gt; tourist attraction slogan accepted.
&gt; It features a local cartoon character &quot;Happy Harold&quot;
">

Acknowledgemens are good enough :-)

Thanks for the further explanation. It was on my mind to ask this question
today, so you must have been a mind reader :-)

Regards
Mette

There is also a slogan postmark " Hastings - popular with visitors
since 1066" - a reference to a "second-hand" Viking - William the
Bastard, Duke of Normandy, and his invasion of England where he
defeated Harold, completely exhausted after just defeating Harald
Hardrada's mainly Viking army at Stamford Bridge,and then having to
force march his army to the South of England to face William.

Thank you, Malcolm,
Sounds just the right thing to include. I will try and locate one of these.
