The discussion on tow vehicles hits home.  I have to replace the
trusty Accord with something that has a beefier hitch attachment
point.

I've managed to rip the hitch off from the bottom of the trunk twice
now.

Car:  2000 Honda Accord V6 sedan, 201,000 miles.

Trailer:  2006 Swan, with fiberglass top.  Tongue weight:  170 lbs.
Total weight:  Not yet weighed, but empty trailer is, according to the
manufacturer, 500 kg and the glider (LS1-d)weighs around 550 lbs, I
think.  I would imagine the total trailer weighs about 1,700 lbs.  I
hope to weigh it soon.

The first hitch attached with three bolts to the bottom of the Honda
trunk.  The sheet metal  measures &quot;Oh Too Thin&quot; I found out the hard
way.  I think the trunk started tearing when the trailer hitch
wouldn't release from the knob as I was cranking the trailer hitch up
off of the knob and I was lifting the rear end of the car.  Why was
the knob sticking?  Because, unknown to me at the time, the Al-Ko
hitch has a little rubber cover that provides a cushion for the
trailer tongue when you back your car's bumper into it.  It prevents
the trailer tongue from scratching your bumper.  Well, a bit of the
rubber would get caught on the knob when hooking up the trailer and
when I tried to release, I would end up jacking up the rear of the car
a bit and stomp on the trailer hitch to release it.  I thought it was
just a tight connection.  Turns out the car wasn't made for this
abuse.  Duh.

A body shop welded up the trunk and I found another hitch design.
This one bolted to the &quot;frame&quot; in two points and also to the &quot;tie
down&quot; or &quot;tow&quot; loop that is right over the center of the hitch.  The
first hitch bolted here, too.

But I've managed to tear that out too.  I think I did that when I
bottomed out recently.  That is, when I drove the car out of a gravel
driveway onto a road and the trailer hitch hit the ground.  I suppose
that's when the bottom of the trunk cracked around the central hitch
attachment point.

Damn.

So now, I need a vehicle that I can afford to buy, and afford to
commute 80 miles per day to work.  Oil just hit US$88 per barrel.

I try to ride a bus to work as often as I can, but sometimes, I still
drive.

So, no, I'm not buying a Ford F-150 or Chevy pickup truck.  I'm not
getting an Avalanche or Ford Excursion.  In fact, I'm not getting a
Ford of anything.  I've had two and they both lived up to the name of
&quot;Found on the Road Dead.&quot;

I wish Honda had their turbo diesel here in America in the CR-V.
Sigh.

So, I think I've narrowed my search to the current Toyota RAV4 with V6
and the current Hyundai Santa Fe with V6.  Both seem to have good
reviews in media that I have found.  The plus for the RAV4 is that it
is a Toyota.  It also gets about the same mileage as my Accord, even
with all wheel drive and 69 more horsepower!  The Hyundai gets
excellent reviews on safety, but mileage isn't as good as the RAV4.
Both are rated to tow 2,000 lbs without the trailer towing package.
And both can tow 3,500 lbs with the tow package.

Which shall it be?  I don't know, the story isn't over yet.  But if
anyone wants a good hitch for a 2000 Accord (probably fit any sixth
generation Accord), send me a note.  Should be great for a bicycle
rack.

I've driven one of our club member's Honda Passport on a retrieve

bit too firm for my liking.  Good mileage.

My Honda Odyssey has a sub frame which holds a 3500 lb hitch.
I understand may car is based on an Accord chassis.
I have 120000 miles on it 75% of it with my trailer.
On its own, at normal highway speed, I get 25-27m/g
If you like your accord you will love the Odyssey, new or used

Hi Ray,

How about a &quot;treading water&quot; approach.   Pick up a used Subaru Outback
wagon (maybe a 2-3 year old one) and use this for a year or two.  They
use a very simple, robust frame hitch setup.    Then, sit back and
watch the various manufacturers race to get their new diesels online
here.     You may be pleasantly surprised, as we know that VW, BMW,
and now Honda and Toyata are bringing their diesels here sometime in
the next 6 to 18 months.

I'm personally going to try to keep my Passat VR6 wagon alive for
another 10,000 miles (pathetic, I know - the car only has 120,000 on
it and it's become a maintenance hog) and watch.    I'm seriously
considering another VW (I'm a glutton for punishment) assuming they
get one here next year AND are willing to publish a tow capacity.
BMW is in the running, though I'm not sure I can ever justify a car
that costs more than my glider :-)   And, if Honda were to come
through with something like the CR-V with diesel, then it's &quot;tschuss&quot;
to the VW brand (after 23 years as a loyal customer).

Cheers,
Erik Mann

I'm curious why you're not considering the gas powered CR-V?  We bought
a Fit (not for towing!!!) a few weeks ago, and need a bigger vehicle in
the next year or so.  We were lusting over the CR-V at the dealership,
and it is top of the list to replace our Subaru (Rav-4 is close second
but we've had 5 Hondas so far).
I'm hoping the diesels arrive before the Ru needs another $3000 work :-(

Get a large person to give you a dope-slap to the head, and get a grip,
man! (pun intended - I know, I need a dope-slap, too)

Buy the BMW and get a more expensive glider. What's so complicated? And
it'd be the start of a great thread: &quot;What glider should I get that
costs more than a BMW?&quot;.

Just trying to get through the winter...

I have been a Honda person for years, with four Honda motorcycles, my
first Accord that ran for 396,000 miles before it was totalled in a
wreck and my current Accord that has 201,000 miles on it and remains a
great car.  If Honda made sailplanes, I would probably be lusting
after one all the time.

The CR-V is rated to tow &quot;only&quot; 1,500 lbs.  Remember how I started
this thread:  Trailer hitch getting ripped off the car and the trailer
most likely weighs more than 1,500 lbs.  I'm tired of having to weld
up the car where the trailer hitch is attached...

Now, after driving the 2000 Accord for a few years, I do like the
power of the V-6 over that of a four.  Also, it seems that some V-6's
give very similar mileage as four cylinder engines.  My wife drives a
2006 Hyundai Sonata with a four cylinder and on the same trek as I
drive to work, it gets NO BETTER mileage than my six cylinder Accord.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From the web page: www.fueleconomy.gov

The numbers shown below are the &quot;new&quot; EPA estimates on mileage.  Note
that the four cylinder CR-V doesn't do much better than any of the V6
vehicles.

Since a very high percentage of my driving is highway driving, I tend
to look at those figures more than the city or combined numbers.

Yes, a four cylinder will work, but for not much, if any, penalty, why
not use a V6?
Power corrupts and absolute power is pretty neat.

The CR-V's towing capacities are very limited. When I inspected an 08
model a few weeks ago I could not even see how one could get a class 3
hitch on it.

The Caravan Club of the UK has just released a report testing lots of
Euro and Far East cars (and a few American ones) for caravan towing.
Might be of interest, although nearly all of the cars are diesel, so I
guess very few are available in the US.

http://preview.tinyurl.com/2tx5wt

Note that the lightest caravan towed was 880 kg, compared to Ray's 750
kg laden trailer, pulled by what I think are called &quot;subcompact&quot; cars
in the States. Larger cars were towing caravans up to 2,000 kg.

The last page also lists the same advice on weight and balance you've
all probably grown tired of me listing here :-) - at least it proves
I'm not making it up!

&gt; Check out Saturn Vue Hybrid.  A fellow contest pilot is very happy with his.

A coworker has a 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid with a towing package.
It's rated to tow something like 3,300 or 3,500 lbs.  It is
interesting, but PRICEY!

The new Saturn Vue, based on an Opel does look nice, but one &quot;little&quot;
thing turned me off:  A 40 foot turning radius.  No, I won't be
turning tight pulling a trailer, but my &quot;tow&quot; vehicle HAS to be my
every day driver, too.  I don't want to take up so much space just to
turn around.  The others I'm looking at turn somewhere in the 34 feet
to 36 feet radius.  Not much less?  Doesn't seem like it, but I think
40' is pushing it a bit.

Also, I'm not &quot;in&quot; to the hybrid stuff yet. I typically drive my cars
for long time and I don't know what a new set of batteries will cost
plus I would like to see the technology mature a bit.  Diesel has been
around for a long time and it is still &quot;maturing&quot; with the new &quot;Blue
Tec&quot; stuff from Mercedes and other new stuff from the other German
automakers and Honda, etc...

Nope, hybrids just don't excite me, yet.  Give it a few years.

The VW Rabbit (current model) works for me.  Perfectly stable at 65 mph
(towing a Cobra with Discus inside) and 25 mpg with the trailer.  No
problem accelerating when going uphill with the trailer.  25,000 miles
and nothing has gone wrong, though the car does have various rattles.

Hitch assembly attaches to the car's frame.  Don't see how there could
be any problem there (though there now is a second hitch design
available that isn't strong enough for glider towing).  The exhaust
system does rattle against the hitch assembly, which I have attempted to
solve by gluing a thin strip from an old wing skid to the hitch assembly
at the point of contact.

As another data point -- a local pilot used to tow with a VW Scirocco,
and he says it was a great towcar.

&gt; The discussion on tow vehicles hits home.  I have to replace the
&gt; trusty Accord with something that has a beefier hitch attachment
&gt; point.

&gt; I've managed to rip the hitch off from the bottom of the trunk twice
&gt; now.

&gt; Car:  2000 Honda Accord V6 sedan, 201,000 miles.

&gt; Trailer:  2006 Swan, with fiberglass top.  Tongue weight:  170 lbs.
&gt; Total weight:  Not yet weighed, but empty trailer is, according to the
&gt; manufacturer, 500 kg and the glider (LS1-d)weighs around 550 lbs, I
&gt; think.  I would imagine the total trailer weighs about 1,700 lbs.  I
&gt; hope to weigh it soon.

&gt; The first hitch attached with three bolts to the bottom of the Honda
&gt; trunk.  The sheet metal  measures &quot;Oh Too Thin&quot; I found out the hard
&gt; way.  I think the trunk started tearing when the trailer hitch
&gt; wouldn't release from the knob as I was cranking the trailer hitch up
&gt; off of the knob and I was lifting the rear end of the car.  Why was
&gt; the knob sticking?  Because, unknown to me at the time, the Al-Ko
&gt; hitch has a little rubber cover that provides a cushion for the
&gt; trailer tongue when you back your car's bumper into it.  It prevents
&gt; the trailer tongue from scratching your bumper.  Well, a bit of the
&gt; rubber would get caught on the knob when hooking up the trailer and
&gt; when I tried to release, I would end up jacking up the rear of the car
&gt; a bit and stomp on the trailer hitch to release it.  I thought it was
&gt; just a tight connection.  Turns out the car wasn't made for this
&gt; abuse.  Duh.

&gt; A body shop welded up the trunk and I found another hitch design.
&gt; This one bolted to the &quot;frame&quot; in two points and also to the &quot;tie
&gt; down&quot; or &quot;tow&quot; loop that is right over the center of the hitch.  The
&gt; first hitch bolted here, too.

&gt; But I've managed to tear that out too.  I think I did that when I
&gt; bottomed out recently.  That is, when I drove the car out of a gravel
&gt; driveway onto a road and the trailer hitch hit the ground.  I suppose
&gt; that's when the bottom of the trunk cracked around the central hitch
&gt; attachment point.

&gt; Damn.

&gt; So now, I need a vehicle that I can afford to buy, and afford to
&gt; commute 80 miles per day to work.  Oil just hit US$88 per barrel.

&gt; I try to ride a bus to work as often as I can, but sometimes, I still
&gt; drive.

&gt; So, no, I'm not buying a Ford F-150 or Chevy pickup truck.  I'm not
&gt; getting an Avalanche or Ford Excursion.  In fact, I'm not getting a
&gt; Ford of anything.  I've had two and they both lived up to the name of
&gt; &quot;Found on the Road Dead.&quot;

&gt; I wish Honda had their turbo diesel here in America in the CR-V.
&gt; Sigh.

&gt; So, I think I've narrowed my search to the current Toyota RAV4 with V6
&gt; and the current Hyundai Santa Fe with V6.  Both seem to have good
&gt; reviews in media that I have found.  The plus for the RAV4 is that it
&gt; is a Toyota.  It also gets about the same mileage as my Accord, even
&gt; with all wheel drive and 69 more horsepower!  The Hyundai gets
&gt; excellent reviews on safety, but mileage isn't as good as the RAV4.
&gt; Both are rated to tow 2,000 lbs without the trailer towing package.
&gt; And both can tow 3,500 lbs with the tow package.

&gt; Which shall it be?  I don't know, the story isn't over yet.  But if
&gt; anyone wants a good hitch for a 2000 Accord (probably fit any sixth
&gt; generation Accord), send me a note.  Should be great for a bicycle
&gt; rack.

The British have to be unique in this respect - dragging a small tin

I second the &quot;treading water&quot; approach.  A well depreciated Subaru or
even (and I'm admittedly biased here) Dodge with a Cummins diesel,
until newer smaller diesels start showing up.  I'm addicted to owning
3/4 ton pickups.  I bought mine (on ebay) with 124,000 miles on it for
under $11,000.  I'm always amazed at the fuel economy.  Empty, I get
19.5 mpg on the highway, 17ish around town.  Towing my trailer, 19
highway and 16ish around town.  I feel it's about twice as much
vehicle and engine than I really need.  If I could find a mid size
pickup with a 2.5 to 3 liter TD engine (that I could afford) I'd have
one.

My 2000 Accord got a new (rebuilt?, remanufactured?)
transmission at 96,000 miles.   Thank you, Honda.

Honda must have realized they had a bad batch of automatic
transmissions because they extended the warranty on
my Accord's tranny from 36,000 miles to 100,000 miles.
As mentioned above, it got replaced at 96,000 miles.
Now at 201,000 miles, it's still shifting as required
and not making any nasty or strange noises.

I also had a transmission oil cooler installed earlier
this year.

By the way, the car towed the trailer nicely up to
about 70 mph.  However, weather (winds) and traffic
(large trucks hauling ass), could make the car/trailer
sway a little with speeds over 70 mph.   Below that
speed, it seemed pretty steady to me.  In calm air
and not many trucks, it was steady at 80 mph, but I
felt more comfortable at 65 to 70 mph.

I really don't like the idea of having to get rid of
it just because the damned tow hitch won't stay attached.
Sigh.

Well, my brother still has the 1968 Chrysler New Yorker
four door 'hard top' (no 'b' pillar between the doors)
and 440 cubic inch gas guzzler V8.  And, it still has
a trailer hitch on it for the times many, many years
past when dad pulled the camping trailer with it.

Naaahhhhh!

While I'm not in the market for a powered aircraft,
Honda or other make, I do live somewhat close to the

Carolina.  In fact, Burlington is a common turnpoint
for us when we fly our 300 km FAI triangle around the
RDU Class C airspace.

This evening as I got off the bus coming back from
work, I saw a Subaru Forester in the park and ride
parking lot with a 'For Sale' sign on it.  2002 'S'
model with 72,000 miles.  Asking $10k or best offer.

Normally aspirated four banger with four speed auto
tranny.

Has a trailer hitch on it.

Normally aspirated four banger with four speed auto

Has a trailer hitch on it.

Well, great, as long as it can handle a 170 lb tongue
weight and a total trailer weight around 1,700 lbs.

I was really surprised to find the sheet metal in the
bottom of the Honda trunk (boot) that looked as thin
as an egg, and that's what the first hitch I had was
bolted through.

I love hondas as well, have owned several of their cars and
motorcycles. I was looking at getting a honda element as a friend said
that his towed very well. After driving Jim Staniforth's subaru
outback from ely to eureka and back, up and down some big mountains,
to retrieve him and an LS-6 in a cobra, decided to try a subaru
forester.

I'm very happy with the car after a year, I was worried that the
little four cylinder engine wouldn't have enough power but it hasn't
been an issue. The car tows the LS-6 and now an ASH-26 up and down the
mountains out west with no problems. I'm very happy with this car,
it's easy to drive, park, and doesn't use too much fuel. As nice as it
was, I don't miss my full size chevy pickup.

I pulled my glider 2,000 miles with my Subaru Outback.  It was no
problem and would go 70 - 80 mph.  I don't think I have your trailer
weight though.  The Forester is smaller and has less horse power.
Mine is a 2005 with a 4-cyl 168 hp and about 3300 lbs.  Can't speak
for the Forester but the Outback Wagon works great.  Mayby the seller
would let you try it out with your trailer.

I just can´t believe there is no solution to the hitch problem. Try to find
a hitch that attaches to the structure that holds the rear bumper, not some
sheet metal of the trunk, and keep the car.

I did as you suggested, to the best that I could find
another hitch.

The first hitch attached with two bolts through the
bottom of the trunk and one bolt through the 'tie down'
loop that is centered on the car and right at the rear
of the car.

The second hitch did away with the two bolts in the
trunk sheet metal and bolted to the 'frame rails',
but it still had a connection to the 'tie down' loop.

Problem is:  The 'tie down' loop, while reinforced,
is still a part of the trunk bottom sheet metal.

Also, the car is rated to tow 1,000 lb.  I'm pulling
a trailer that is over 1,000 lbs, closer to 2,000 lbs.
Also, the tongue weight shouldn't be more than 100
lbs for this particular car and I measured the tongue
last weekend with bathroom scales:  170 lbs.

This particular car just isn't going to pull this particular
trailer any more.  The hitch has been removed, the
trunk repaired, for the second and last time, and I'm
going to have to get another tow vehicle.

Ray,

Have you looked into Subaru Foresters and Outbacks?  They tow good,
and if you can resist the turbo options the gas mileage is fine.  They
are all wheel drive so if you landout in a field you'll have better
traction than the front wheel drive cars.
I've got 73000 trouble free miles on my Forester.

Chris,

Yes, I am considering the Forester.  I know you and RQ tow with turbo
versions, but I would look ONLY at the normally aspirated models
because I don't want to pay for the premium octane fuel required for
the turbo models.

The tough adjustment will be that I've been &quot;corrupted&quot; by the
additional power of a V6 and I don't know what it will be like to tow
with a four cylinder, again.  Also, both the Forester and the Outback
are smaller than the Accord which will take some time to adjust to.

The 07 Forester is rated to tow 2,400 lbs, but I don't know what the
max tongue weight is.  Probably 10% of the max trailer weight.

So, I guess I'm looking for a good, used, Forester.

One good thing:  Time is on my side.  My flying is done for the winter
and I don't have to worry about towing it anywhere for a while.

I think my 05 Outback is rated for 200 lbs tongue weight and 2,700
trailer weight.  It has the factory hitch.  It's in the shop right now
for an unrelated matter so I can't check.

It's the regular 2.5i version, non-turbo 168 hp.  Drives 70-80 no
problem through New Mexico with a Cobra trailer and a 570 lb glider
and other gear in the trailer.  This is mostly on I-40 and some
highways.  There are places it would probably go a little slower here
though.

There is a fellow pilot at Truckee (elev. 5,900') who tows his Genesis
2 in a Cobra fiberglass top trailer using a normally aspirated Subaru
Forrester.  I'm not sure of the vehicle's year but its the generation
before the current one, maybe a 2003.  He has towed it from sea level
and over the Sierra Nevadas without complaints or incident.  So I
wuold imagine that a Forrester will be more than enough tow vehicle at
your elevation.  He also likes the car's AWD capability as he lives in
the Sierras where it snows heavily during the winters.  As an aside,
not all AWD systems are equal.  Most systems favor FWD and do not
engage the rear wheels unitl slippage is detected in the front
wheels.  Subarus have several versions of AWD depending upon the model
but they have continuous AWD in common, always sending power to all
four wheels.  To see how Subaru AWD compares to the competion see
