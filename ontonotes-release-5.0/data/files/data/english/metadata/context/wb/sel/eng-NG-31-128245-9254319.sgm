&quot;Palestinians who are Israeli citizens. They are equal rights citizens but
the creation of the Palestinian state gives them the national answer. As
individuals, they can live in Israel and be equal rights citizens because
Israel is a democracy, but simultaneously they cannot ask for the
declaration of a Palestinian state while working against the nature of the
State of Israel as home unto the Jewish people.&quot;

JOINT PRESS CONFERENCES WITH FRENCH FM KOUCHNER &amp; UK FM MILIBAND
Israel Government Press Office

#1 Joint Press Conference with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and
French
Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner
November 18, 2007

Link: http://tinyurl.com/yrq7y7

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: Bonjour. Thank you. I would like to welcome Bernard
Kouchner, the French Foreign Minister, to Israel. Bienvenue en Israel. We
just discussed the situation in the region and of course the threat coming
from Iran and the process between Israel and the Palestinians before
Annapolis, and we also discussed the day after Annapolis. And I think that
the meeting which is the most important the day after Annapolis is the Paris
Conference, which is going to help in terms of donor states to create and to
change reality on the ground on the part of the Palestinian Authority, and
this is the vision of two states for two peoples. The bilateral track
between Israel and the Palestinians is the most important one but the role
of the international community and especially the Arab world is not less
important. And when it comes to the international community, to support the
bilateral track is one thing and, of course, to support capacity-building in
the Palestinian Authority and to change the situation on the ground, as will
be part of the Paris Conference, is not less important.

When it comes to the Arab world, we believe that the role of the Arab world
is to support the moderates in the Palestinian Authority, to support the
bilateral track, to be in Annapolis and to support the process and not to
put conditions in order to participate and to attend the meeting. But,
basically, we all discussed it and it was enlightening, like always. Thanks.

FOREIGN MINISTER KOUCHNER: Thank you, Tzipi. I want to -- sorry for my
voice. Sorry for you, sorry for me. Thank you for your warm welcome and it
was very interesting to discuss because there is an emergency now. I met
with Ehud Barak yesterday. This morning I met with the Prime Minister, then
with Yossi Belin and Abid Rabu and with Tzipi.

Now, we were together in Lisbon last week. Now we are in a real emergency
period because we're facing the Annapolis Conference, some particular
problems in Lebanon and an election meanwhile. Then after -- but it is a
real link in between the two events -- Annapolis will drive us to the Paris
Conference, and the Paris Conference is the place where we have to give
freshness to the decision and perspectives accepted in Annapolis,
perspectives concerning the main issue. I'm talking for myself and on the
part of my peoples for twenty-five years. A Palestinian State.

So the Paris Conference, a donation conference, must be prepared as a
success in the battlefield, some particular items like security, like
administration, like offering trading for the Jordan (indiscernible: 4:05)
police, etc., and economically projects, like offering to the donors, not
only to the nations, including to personal donors of foundations, private
money, to businesspeople -- a sort of shopping list, which they can
participate on a certain level of some project.

We received two days ago a rough draft document coming from the Prime
Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Salim Fayad, and it was a very
good surprise, not completely achieved because we have to offer this
perspective to the World Bank and some international institutions, etc., but
a real series of projects. So that's why we are considering Annapolis, not
only as an achievement but as the beginning of the setting up of that
Palestinian State leaving aside Israel.

Two states for two peoples, we are looking for that. All the activists, all
the militants for peace we have seen years and years, and we have the
opportunity to play a role from one conference to the other. I have to
underline, of course, the role of my good friend, Toni Blair, as a
representative of the Quartet, and you will see that it has really been my
colleague, the minister in France for the UK. We are all working in that
direction with strengths and hope. Thank you.

Q: A question to Minister Livni, what are the gestures that Israel will
bring to the Annapolis Summit? Is it only a declaration that it's going to
implement the first days of the roadmap and to freeze the settlements or is
it more than that? What about releasing prisoners? We heard that there are
some disagreements between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the
Americans about the numbers. Is Israel going to raise the number?

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: Well, basically, the success of the Annapolis
meeting is the beginning and launching of the process, a dialogue between
Israel and the Palestinians on all of the outstanding issues that are needed
to be solved before and in order to create a Palestinian state as part of
this region of two states for two people, two different homelands for two
different peoples. And it's important to remember that in the last seven
years, there was none. I mean, Israel took a unilateral step when it came to
the disengagement from Gaza, and the situation on the ground with the
Palestinian Authority is difficult enough, but we decided not to take it as
an excuse not to promote the process and we need and we want to reach an
understanding with the pragmatic leaders. But of course any understanding
will be subject to the implementation of the roadmap at the end of the
negotiations.

So, basically, this is the real beginning of something that I believe should
be embraced by the world. Israel accepted and Israel is willing to implement
its obligation according to the roadmap, as we expect the Palestinians to
implement their part of the roadmap, especially the parts which relate to
Israel's security because as the future of the Palestinian state being a
viable and prosperous Palestinian state is part of the Israeli interest, we
believe that Israel's security is part of the Palestinian interest as well.

So there are certain things that are part of the implementation of the first
phase of the roadmap and there are some, what we call, CBMs that Israel is
thinking of taking in order to support the process of such, even though it
is not part of the implementation of the first phase of the roadmap.
Tomorrow there's going to be a Covenant meeting and we will discuss all the
issues, so excuse me for not referring to the exact number of prisoners that
will be released, but we believe that in order to see that we are -- I think
that both sides are -- serious, but Israel is serious and we are talking not
only about a virtual process but we want to change also the reality on the
ground, as we expect the Palestinians to change the reality on the ground
when it comes to Israel's security.

Q: Does the headline of an Israeli newspaper this morning reflect a change
in your position about Iran?

FOREIGN MINISTER KOUCHNER: Good question. The horrible title of this article
doesn't reflect the French position. The French position is very clear and
is not changed at all. We are offering to this very difficult problem of the
nuclear power, not the civilian nuclear power in Iran. They have the right
to set up civilian nuclear power and we are ready to help them but we are
not ready to accept an atomic bomb, a military power. I've been very clear
on that.

So that having been maintained, and it was the French role in New York, we
maintained the unity of the six P3 (indiscernible: 10:17): Russian, Chinese,
United States, British, German and French, who maintained the unity of this
group. We had a document. We signed all the documents waiting for El
Baradai. So we did sign it as we broke at the end of November, then going
back all together, the six, if we are all united in that period, going back
to the Security Council and offering if it may happen a new resolution with
new sanctions, international, accepted by the UN system.

Meanwhile, all the European nations signed the twenty-seven nation document
while working on national or European sanctions. We are working; we are not
imposing for the time being, certainly not.

And at the same time, with big strengths and obstination, we are talking to
the Iranians. Discussions, discussions, discussions. Diplomacy, diplomacy,
diplomacy. So I was really surprised to discover this particularly vile
position of France in the title of this newspaper, and it doesn't correspond
to any change, nothing, negotiation in the front line. And meanwhile, we are
offering and strengthening sanctions and we are absolutely conscious about
the threat, the coming danger, the universal real danger of offering to this
particularly dangerous region sort of -- comment dit tr?s (indiscernible:
37:12) -- nonproliferation. Sorry, I'm very sick. So we are against
proliferation, and proliferation starts with one bomb in Iran.

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: I would like to add a few things about the last IAEA
report on Iran because clearly it is reaffirmed that Iran is in violation of
the resolution of the Security Council and is promoting its nuclear program,
and this is something that the international community needs to address.
Clearly Iran tries to gain more time. While the international community is
talking about sanctions, they are continuing in their attempts to achieve
the nuclear weapon. So I believe the determination of the international
community is needed, as well as more sanctions by the Security Council plus
more sanctions that can enhance the resolutions of the Security Council that
can be taken by the Europeans as such or by other members of the
international community as it states, but also by the private sector. I
believe that this is needed, more enhanced, strong and immediate sanctions
that can change the situation and the Iranians' plan.

Q: If I may, why did you ask recently to the Palestinians as a precondition
to recognize Israel as a Jewish state at this moment, putting at risk the
very difficult process you are trying to start again?

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: Israel didn't put anything as a precondition but I
would like to explain to you the vision. When the world is talking about the
need to create a Palestinian state, I am sure that this is part of the
vision of two states for two peoples. The whole idea or the demand of the
Palestinians was to create a state in order to give an answer to their own
national situation, in order to give an answer to their need of
self-determination in a state of their own. So in translating the basic
words of two states for two peoples, the way I'm understanding it, the way
the international community I'm sure is understanding it, is that as Israel
was created in the past in order to give an answer to create a homeland for
the Jewish people, as Israel absorbed refugees that needed to leave Arab
states without nothing and came to Israel, and Israel absorbed them because
this is part of the raison d'etre of the State of Israel, thus the situation
of the Palestinian state.

So it's not about asking the Palestinians something which relates to the
identity of the State of Israel but the understanding that the goal of the
process is to be according to this region of two states for two peoples
because at the end of the day, the conflict is a conflict between two
nations. The conflict is between the two peoples. The fact that Israel needs
to defend itself and the fact that Israel is fighting for its existence
since it was established is not because Israel is the only democracy in the
Middle East but because Israel was created as a Jewish State according to
the United Nations resolution.

In 1947, before the State of Israel was established, the world decided to
create a Jewish State. The Arab world rejected it then. By the way, the
Palestinians could have celebrated the sixtieth anniversary of a Palestinian
state. They could have celebrated, by the way, the seventh anniversary of
the Palestinian state if they had accepted us as something that was on the
table at Camp David seven years ago.

So basically, it's not putting obstacles in the way; it's just understanding
where we are going together. And I believe in the dialogue. I believe in the
bilateral track. I believe that the goal, the just solution to the national
inspiration, on the one hand, of the Jewish people was the creation of
Israel, and for the Palestinians it's creating a Palestinian state in order
to give them the national answer. What else is to be discussed on this
obvious thing, excuse me?

Q: Thank you. To Mrs. Livni, what do you think about Knesset member Ahmad
Tibi, who went to Abu Mazan and told him not to give up this issue? And,
again, can I ask is Israel prepared to weigh the possibility of foregoing
the occupation of Israel, the Jewish state? If we can hear what the
Palestinians say that maybe it will not come or maybe they will not stand
near the microphone with you at the end of Annapolis, is Israel prepared to
erase the possibility, to forego the occupation of Israel as a Jewish state?
And what do you think about, again, about Ahmad Tibi who went to Abu Mazan?

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: I just answered your second question but I can say
that the idea of creating a Palestinian state is to give a national answer
to the Palestinians, wherever they are. Those who live in the territories in
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, those who live outside of the territories,
whether they live in different refugee camps or in Israel, it's the national
answer to them. But, of course, any Israeli citizen is an equal rights
citizen. Israel is home unto the Jewish people and democracy as well.

So, basically, I believe that by doing so, Ahmad Tibi and some of his
friends are working against something that they fought for in the future
because if they represented here in Israel what is called the Palestinian
cause and the nondeclaration of the Palestinian state, then clearly the
creation of the Palestinian state is the answer to the national situation of
the Palestinians. By saying today that, on one hand, they demand a
Palestinian state in order to give an answer to the national aspiration of
the Palestinians but simultaneously they are talking in terms of national
aspirations inside Israel, this is going to make a huge problem in the way
of two problems: to find an end to conflict and the end of all claims. And I
believe that the stance against the nature of the existence of the State of
Israel is -- this is part of our -- it's not a constitution but our basic
laws, and this is something that I said also before to some representatives
of the Palestinians who are Israeli citizens. They are equal rights citizens
but the creation of the Palestinian state gives them the national answer. As
individuals, they can live in Israel and be equal rights citizens because
Israel is a democracy, but simultaneously they cannot ask for the
declaration of a Palestinian state while working against the nature of the
State of Israel as home unto the Jewish people.

Q: I have one question for both of you, sorry. Ms. Livni, you said that
Israel is ready to implement its obligation concerning the roadmap. What
kind of gesture is Israel considering, first? And Monsieur Kouchner,

FOREIGN MINISTER KOUCHNER: I maintain my obstination from an optimist's
position. And thank you to Tzipi and thank you to the people I'm going to
meet on the Palestinian side because they are more -- this is something very
new that, in between, as I told you several times, Ehud Olmert and Abu
Mazan, they both want to be effective and successful, and also the others
who were aside from the negotiation, terribly, not only jealous but they
want to interfere. They want to feed their problem. This is not -- for the
time being, let them do that and let's meet in Annapolis, all of us, to be
positive.

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: Okay. Well, basically, according to the roadmap,
there are some obligations taken by the Israeli side referring to the
refusal of settlements, outposts and so-on. This is part of the negotiations
that we are now having with the Palestinians about the timetable and how to
do so, and on the other hand, there are certain things that are not part of
the roadmap but we think that maybe these kind of confidence-keeping
measures can be taken by Israel in order to send a message to the
Palestinians and to the Arab world that we're willing to change reality on
the ground in order to ease the life of the Palestinians during the
negotiations, before the negotiations, in order to create an atmosphere of
peace, if I would say, not only in terms of negotiating peace but also to
change reality on the ground, as we expect the Palestinians also to change
reality on the ground when it comes to Israel's security.

#2 Joint Press Conference with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and
British
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband
November 18, 2007

Link: http://tinyurl.com/yrh34h

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: Hello. Welcome. I would like to welcome David
Miliband, the British Foreign Minister, to Israel. We had a conversation
talking about the bilateral relationship between Israel and Britain and, of
course, I think this visit is a successful visit even before it started due
to the Israeli achievement in the football game that makes some of the
streets of London very happy and supportive when it comes to Israel.

But, of course, we also had some -- I don't want to say more serious,
because football is serious enough, but we also discussed the situation in
the region, the future of the bilateral tracks between Israel and the
Palestinians when it comes to Annapolis and the day after Annapolis, the
threat coming from Iran to the region and to the world as well. And it was a
very fruitful discussion, enlightening and the beginning of -- not the
beginning of friendship but I'm sure that this is -- it's the second meeting
but it is based on the understanding that the relations between Israel and
Britain is based on an understanding of values, and we're going to speak
openly in the ongoing weeks about the situation in the region to share some
ideas and to work together to make a better future for the region.

MR. MILIBAND: Well, thank you very much, Foreign Minister. Foreign Minister,
this has been a very fruitful meeting. I wholeheartedly agree it's been a
very positive discussion, I think, animated at every stage by two shared
goals. One shared goal is for the region, for a secure Israel living
peacefully with its neighbors, including a Palestinian state, and secondly
for a vibrant, close, detailed bilateral relationship at the level of
government but also at the level of people and business. And I feel this is
obviously a very, very significant time for the region. The opportunities
that are represented by the negotiations that could be started by the
Annapolis Conference don't come along very often, and it's very, very
important that everyone in the international community does everything they
can to provide practical and political support for the two parties to the
discussions to take forward the track with real drive.

In respect to the bilateral agenda, in addition to the football, it is
strong and is deep and I look forward to taking that to ever greater levels.
Thank you very much.

Q: We heard that Prince Charles refused to visit Israel because he doesn't
want to support Israel in the conflict. What do you think of that? And,
besides, do you have a message to the Israeli team after the game last
night?

MR. MILIBAND: Let me deal with the question about Prince Charles first
because I think it will be a very -- not very bad but very wrong for anyone
in Israel to have the impression that somehow Prince Charles didn't want to
come here on the base of an e-mail exchange amongst his staff. I spoke to
Prince Charles on Friday evening after I'd read the story in the newspapers
on Friday and he said to me that he remembered well his last visit here at
the time of the -- the tragic time of Yitzchak Rabin's funeral. He also made
it absolutely clear, and I'm very pleased to make it clear today, that as
soon as the Israeli government is -- assuming the Israeli government is keen
to organize a visit by the Prince of Whales and of course all other members
of the Royal Family, then of course the government and Clarence House will
be happy to enter into those discussions to find the right time and the
right place to take this forward. So I think we can scotch comprehensively
any suggestion of difficulties in that area.

In respect of the football, we were all very worried when Mr. Benayoun was
ruled out by injury, the Liverpool star. Obviously we had to think whether
the visit could take place under such a deep, diplomatic cloud but we
rejoice in the success of Israel yesterday and we look forward to making
sure that our side of the bargain, which is the correct result against
Croatia, is the next step, but we're extremely grateful to the Israeli team
for their help in this regard.

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: And that our success is their success.

Q: On the subject of Annapolis, clearly it's an urgent moment. What are the
costs -- I'd like both of you to answer, if possible -- what are the costs
of failure next week?

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: I think that next week is going to be a success. I
mean, the idea is to launch negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians
to address the day after Annapolis all the issues that need to be addressed
in order to create and to establish a Palestinian state as part of this
vision of two states for two peoples. This is the idea. The meeting itself,
the idea of the meeting is not to address the core issues but to launch the
forces. We are willing to do so for the first time after seven years in
which there was no real dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians. During
these seven years, Israel took some unilateral steps and seven years ago,
when we tried to reach an understanding, unfortunately the Palestinians
refused to take what was on the table, and I think that they could have
recently celebrated the seventh anniversary of a Palestinian state.

But stagnation is not the Israeli government's policy. It's not our
interest. Even though, according to the roadmap, there is a need to address
the first phase in which the Palestinians need to address our security
needs, we decided not to wait until a full implementation of the first phase
of the roadmap. We decided to launch discussions right now according, of
course, to the understanding that at the end of the road, when a treaty will
be reached, I hope, then we can see what the situation is on the ground and
to implement fully and completely the roadmap.

So, basically, success is a matter also of definition, perception and the
determination of both sides, and I think that we are there.

Q: It's not -- success is not predetermined. It's very difficult --

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: Well, tell me about it.

Q: What if doesn't go well, and not just next week but in the course of the
next six months?

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: Okay. So this is the real question. The real
question, the way I see it, is not the meeting itself but really the months
after the meeting, and it is part of our responsibility to find a common
ground, to find a common denominator when it comes to the most sensitive
issues according to the vision of two states, two different homelands for
two different peoples. This is the basic idea that was embraced and adopted
by the Israeli government and the Israeli public. I think that the role of
the Arab world is crucial and this is maybe the most important thing in
terms of success because the Palestinians, the pragmatic leaders and the
Palestinian Authority, need the support of the other board, not a
conditional support but a support of the bilateral track, investing in the
Palestinian Authority, supporting any kind of compromises which are needed
instead of dictating the outcome.

And I believe that -- I hope that the Arab world understands that there is
an opportunity here not only to solve at the end of the road the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict but to change the region as such. And I hope
that they will not just sit on the fence waiting for the Israelis and
Palestinians to solve the problem and then to normalize their relations with
Israel and to support the process. The best thing to do is to start all
together. Israel, the Palestinians of the bilateral track, plus the support
of the Arab world, plus the support of the international community in terms
of economic needs and capacity building and with the role of Tony Blair, of
course, is crucial on this.

MR. MILIBAND: I think that we've seen the costs of a frozen process over the
seven years that Foreign Minister has referred to, and the costs are -- for
Israelis and for Palestinians, the costs are fear and insecurity and, in
some cases, death, on all sides, and those are very, very high costs indeed.
And I think that that is sufficient motivation for anyone to realize that
there is massive gain to be had from a process that step-by-step is
proceeding in the right direction rather than in the wrong direction. And I
believe the seriousness of purpose of leaders on both sides is something
that the whole of the international community has a responsibility to
support, and I'm very committed to the idea that the UK will play its part
practically, unpolitically. But obviously I agree with the Foreign Minister
as well that right around the world there are countries that can play a
critical role, and that especially applies in the region, and I very much
hope that the contribution of Arab states will take that forward.

Q: James Blitz, Financial Times. Obviously, it's of huge importance to the
world that the peace process gain some momentum and get somewhere. Can you
say what is the sort of role that a country like Britain can play, not only
now in the run-up to Annapolis but also in the year ahead when negotiation
happens? Can you spell out, the two of you, what thoughts you have on the
role that the UK can play?

FOREIGN MINISTER LIVNI: Yes. In a way we need to bridge two different gaps.
One is between the two sides, between Israel and the Palestinians, when it
comes to the core issues, when it comes to the most sensitive issues. We've
had some differences; we need to bridge them. This is part of our
responsibility. But there is also another gap to bridge and this is between
the willingness of the current Palestinian government -- legitimate
government -- the moderates and pragmatic leaders, and their ability and
capability to deliver on the ground. And even if we reach an understanding
on the core issues at the end of the road, we need to implement it according
to the roadmap because part of any agreement is, of course, Israel's
security and the need to reform and to change the situation on the ground.

We are looking at Gaza Strip in an understanding that the situation there
needs to be changed. And the pragmatic leaders, even though they are
partners in order to reach an understanding on the bilateral track, they
need to perform and to reform and to change the situation on the ground.

So, the role of the international community, when it comes to
capacity-building of the legitimate Palestinian government, when it comes to
changes on the ground, when it comes to the Palestinian economy, is crucial
because the people, of course, also in Israel, need to see the fruits of the
negotiations while they're taking place and not just to wait until the end
of the road.

And according to this understanding, the role of the international community
is to support a bilateral track and to help the Palestinians to take the
right steps and to invest in and to change the situation on the ground, not
only when it comes to Israel's security but when it comes to the internal
matters in the Palestinian Authority.

MR. MILIBAND: I strongly agree that there is a political and a practical
role that we have to play. In respect of the politics, the only decision
makers, the only people who can make decisions, are the Israeli government
and the representatives of the Palestinian people. The international
community can't make decisions on behalf of those two partners but we can be
insistent and consistent in how we support those committed to peaceful
resolution and to the shared goal of a two-state solution, and we must be so
in all the fora in which we are players.

Secondly, though, I think the practical support we can give was demonstrated
to me today when I visited the police training center in Jericho. A top
issue for Israel, rightly, is its security, and now it's a top issue for the
Palestinian Authority as well, and they know that for the Palestinian people
and for their relationship with Israel, security is an absolute must. And
the international community has experience in this regard, has resources and
its commitment can be very important. And you saw yourself the people being
trained there. There are some very difficult terrain in which they're going
to be policing but they can use the support of the international community.

Security -- I would raise economics as the second, not just economics in the
far-off future -- I absolutely agree with the Foreign Minister about this --
the economy in the short term as well. Tony Blair's work as the Quartet's
representative, after all, an international representative there, is looking
at short term as well as medium and long term. And the Prime Minister's
announcement this week that we would be going to the donor's conference in
December with a strong commitment of up to five hundred million dollars over
three years to support that policy in economic reconstruction is important.
And I would say that the road from Annapolis, which the Prime Minister
talked about last Monday -- he said the road from Annapolis is as important
as the road to Annapolis, and the road from Annapolis runs through Paris,
because there's a donor's conference there -- it runs through the
negotiations that will take place between the Palestinian Authority and the
government here, and it runs through all international fora that can make a
contribution, a practical contribution, to that process.

So, I hope we see a real drive next year in many fora to make a positive
contribution, and the fact that both the Palestinian Authority and the
Israel government say they want the support of the international community,
I think, is very helpful.
