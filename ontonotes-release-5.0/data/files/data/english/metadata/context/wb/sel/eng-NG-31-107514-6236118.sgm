This is a poem written NOT BY ME but a very close friend who let me
put it on my blog because its her words but mirrors Â my thoughts and
heart, I would love to know what it means to others....

He is secretive and sly, a mastermind of manipulation.
Yet, candid and exposed, enslaved in combination.

He is the annoying irritation deep beneath my skin,
Yet, he is my every breath, my forbidden original sin.

He's an intro- extrovert, a pessi-optimist,
Objective and subjective together coexist.

He is the torturous pain that brutally aches my ass,
Yet, the one who makes me whole that I cannot get past.

He is the elixir of oil &amp; water perfectly combined,
A clever Alchemist created by design.

He is the cold chill in my bones, a cruel contemptuous shell,
Yet, the warmth that flames desire, entraped within his spell.

He is plagued with Procrastination, withdrawn in emptiness,
Yet, maneuvers in imagination to skillfully progress.

He is the fury in my blood, the boiling point of rage,
Yet, the peaceful beat of my heart that keeps me well engaged.

He is his own worst enemy, and yet his only friend,
Uncertain but assured imprisons his toxic blend.

He is a nuisance, my aggravation, smug and swollen with pride,
Yet, compassion and understanding are traits he cannot hide.

He is the manifestation of self-love, and yet he hates himself,
His reflection of depression blinds him of his wealth.

He is passively domineering, and intrigues me to the core,
I outright cannot stand him, yet it's him that I adore.

He is perceptive, keen, and clever, but cannot see the writing the
wall.
He is wicked, cruel, and evil, yet he is none of these at all,

He is the root of all my pain, the source of my aggression,
Yet, my seed of happiness, my passion and obsession.

He is my sadness that repels, a lethal intoxication,
Yet, my ecstasy and thrill, my magnetic infatuation.

He's both vague and very clear, impulsive and sincere,
He is fragile and he's strong, always right and always wrong.

He is a peaceful ticking bomb swift and slow to inflame,
He is tolerant, and sensitive, but coldhearted just the same.

I love him and hate him, I want him and I don't,
He sends a mix of messages, he will and yet he won't.

He is a puppet master that controls my mental states,
I am the reflection of his projection, happy but irate.

He says that he will be around, a promise he cannot fulfill
He wants to cut the ties with me, but knows he never will.

He is my immaculate self-deception, the one I want in vain,
He is the apple of my eye, and yet my paradox of pain.
