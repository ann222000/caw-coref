Perhaps the relative numbers can be instructive as to who gets it right?
First contestant: The Kantian (and Ficthean) Herrmann von Helmholtz.
Any Randian contributors to science to match him?

BTW, any thoughts on HvH's (&quot;Helmholtz-Gregory&quot;, these days) constructivist
theory of perception?

OK. Someone here posts a lot about kantians being opposed to science, as
opposed to any other, randomly selected philosopher, or at least writer,
say, Rand. I was just comparing the scientific record of kantians vs.
followers of any other, randomly selected philosopher, or at least writer,

Rand's ideas on Nature are compatible, but they aren't original in

Rand's ideas. It happened the other way around.

Scientists?

Why use a cannon to kill a fly?

When faced with the logic of a mere politician, Bill Clinton, Randroid
Greenspan turned monetary policy over to the executive.

Why do you think Randroids swear so much?

This shouldn't be surprising.  In science everything and every field
of science is interrelated and interconnected.

In Randroidism everything is individualist this individualist that.

Why &quot;still&quot;? Have the patently specious arguments for AGW gotten any
better lately? If Objectivists - and they are hardly the only ones -
reject these arguments maybe it is because they are blatantly
politicized junk science. They happen to be very easy to debunk, not
to mention outright ridicule. For example:

&quot;Norway's Moose Population in Trouble for Belching&quot;

Brat, your ignorance of Objectivism is breathtaking. Individualism is
an ethical/political concept and doesn't by itself, per se, address
the connectedness of the branches of philosophy. So, at the very least
you are equivocating like crazy and committing an obvious category
error.

However if your pronouncements about Objectivism were ever based on
actual knowledge you would know that Ayn Rand explicitly regarded
ethics and politics - and thus &quot;individualism&quot; - as profoundly
&quot;interrelated and interconnected&quot; to every other branch of philosophy,
especially epistemology.

You are also apparently completely unaware of the fact that leading
Objectivists have publicly spoken out against the Neo-Cons.

Here is just one example:

&quot;Neoconservative Foreign Policy: An Autopsy&quot; by Yaron Brook and Alex
Epstein

http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2007-summer/neoconservativ...

http://tinylink.com/?sv4WkN6Zmv

However far be it for me to interfere with your pronouncements about
Objectivism being tainted by any actual knowledge of it. Why should
that be any different from
your babblings on any other subject.

I was comparing the mentalities and psychologies, not position papers.

For example, neocons think everything in life is just like an excitin'
WWII action movie.  Just blow some stuff up and utopia will break out.

Rantards think everything in life is like a Rand novel.  Act really
emotive and swear a lot and utopia will break out.

The fact that WWII movies and Rand novels aren't identical genres of
fiction isn't important to me.

What's important is both groups are living in a fantasy based on
fiction, and a rather narrow band width of fiction at that.

Even looneytarians aren't THAT sclerotic.

I would even add that Objectivism is at odds with our best methods of

There's no nexus between morality and science.

There is a nexus between saying everything can be a purely

pointing out how individual actions cannot be isolated from everyone
else.

That nexus is well known:

It's called a direct contradiction.

That's why Randroids try to contradict 98% of the independent physical

There are two issues here, what Rand believed, which was warped from
her background in the USSR, and her small core of followers who
managed to screw up what little she did get right.

First let's explain Rand:

You know how Justice Thomas wants to be a white guy?  In Thomas' mind
no one is whiter than Justice Scalito so he tries to act just like
Scalito.

You know how immigrants like to do and over do what they think is
American?

You know how much easier it is to pick up on the vices of a different
culture?

Well that's Rand.  She came here and wanted to be as anti-Russian or
antiSoviet as possible.

Not that the commies had it right but merely being anti-commie doesn't
mean you are right either.

Her followers are the most weak minded dogmatists ever.

They will _never_ make any contributions to science.

You mean as compared to the dogmatists who support gov't regulation or
AGW? What does science have to do with the pros or cons of gov't
regulation? But even if one assumes that economics and politics are
sciences, Objectivism simply agrees with the free market and less
gov't schools of thought which *long preceded* Objectivism and many of
which are still active today and most of which have nothing to do with
Objectivism, e.g. the Austrian or Chicago Schools of economics. It is
my understanding that free market thinking is now predominant in
American economic depts. Are you saying that economists today are anti-
science? The only real anti-science was the nonsense of socialist
&quot;science&quot; which prevailed in much of the 20th Cent and which has
proven to be a total disaster.

As for AGW, are you going to claim that Freeman Dyson professor of
physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton is anti-
science.

&quot;My first heresy says that all the fuss about global warming is
grossly exaggerated. Here I am opposing the holy brotherhood of
climate model experts and the crowd of deluded citizens who believe
the numbers predicted by the computer models.&quot;

http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/dysonf07/dysonf07_index.html

I just cite this because it is relatively recent but I could give you
dozens of other citations by leading and reputable scientists who
dismiss the AGW claims. Are you going to claim that these scientists
are anti-science.

The rest of your claims about Objectivism and science are total

plain water in a spray bottle because it will slow them down enough to
be squished. In the kitchen, I have a very dilute solution of Simple

Why to flies fly the way they do?  I mean they drive you crazy with
the high-speed buzzing around a room, and they obviously aren't
looking for food, and they must be consuming lots of energy. Is it a
death wish, kind of like 'suicide by cop', because they are trapped
away from piles of cow manure that might exist outside? Still, if you
open the door or window, they are no more likely to fly out than stay
in. Why torment and enrage us that way? Are they Satanic wannabees; is
it a kind of reality show contest to see if they can get high
positions in the nether regions when they pass on?

Why don't Mexicans in Mexico mind flies around their food?

They'll fix me a nice tasty meal and then I feel like I'm being

One theory is that they are or were so poor at one time that having
enough food to attract flies became a real status symbol.

It's a matter of association.

No, it seems quite a clear statement of his emotional/subjective
state. Many (most?) people, including scientists, are conditioned in
childhood to the point where no amount of reasoning can overcome the
conditioning.  That's just how morality works, and his comment is
perfectly rational---he is saying that his emotional (conditioned)
response to  his (potential) acceptance of 'immoral' behavior would be
negative. Big deal.

That's hardly a critique of pure Kant. Many (most) modern scientists
would argue that there is nothing in science that *any* philosopher
can muse about, and that metaphysics can make no contribution to the

I agree that not everyone would consider this argument conclusive.
The premises might all be wrong (are moral principles overthrown by shaken
belief? etc.), and the argument as a whole may seem a surrender of human
dignity (or whatever) - but the syllogism as such is not illogical, not
against reason.
Truth of premises are not a function of logic (&quot;Vernunft&quot;), but of
&quot;Verstand&quot; (understanding how the world works, understanding causal
relations etc.).

OTOH this is a good example of Kan's &quot;transcendental&quot; argument structure:
beginning with something given (a moral intuition or some such), and then
investigating what is required for this given to exist. I.e., Kant never
questions that we are moral beings, he begins with that intuition (in a
non-Kantian-vocabulary sense) and tries to explain what it takes to be a
moral being.

Would you care to present your criticism in more technical terms than
&quot;pathetic&quot;?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

They weren't &quot;musings&quot; ... They are a fairly logical investigation of our
cognitive faculties.
And they are not unscientific. Then, as now, natural philosophy (AKA natural
science or simply &quot;science&quot;, although that latter term is originally
coextensive with &quot;philosophy&quot;) cannot take a simple step before the
metaphysical questions have, if not been answered, then at least been posed.
Stuff like &quot;the world as we see it, exists&quot; (which is one of many possible
metaphysical positions), and &quot;we can get to know the world&quot;, and &quot;we can
share knowledge&quot; etc. etc.
As I have tried to show (by references), it was Kant's &quot;musings&quot; that
delimited the field of modern natural science in the first place.
And as far as I have read KdrV, he does not assume that he can argue things
about the universe that he rightfully (sez who?) can't. Au contraire, again
it was he who limited our discourse on the world, as far as we want it to
have any truth value, to that which can be confirmed by experience, branding
the rest speculation. So you are actually trying to level that criticism -
which he developed ; now we know &quot;who sez&quot; - against him who first argued
and justified it. That is fairly ironic.

As a result of that, he makes many conclusions that are now

I didn't address that point. But as to it, modern scientists have a
different conception of what it takes to be a science, compared to
Kant's day. What did Kant mean by a &quot;science of metaphysics&quot;?
Doing experiments on the astral plane during meditation? No, he meant
&quot;science&quot; as in a general investigation ruled by rational principles.
As such, a science of metaphysics is an investigation into the
principles underlying math, the sciences in general, morals, politics,
and aesthetics. It is the science which asks, what principles make
these sciences possible to begin with?

There is also a difference between those who have studied Kantianism
for years, such as myself, and those, such as Stockbauer, who have
looked into it very little and so can only acquire their opinions from
other sources. I have an understanding of Kant such that I am able to
generate my own ideas about Kant theory. I came up with the idea that
non-Euclidean geometry was predicted by the theory of the synthetic a
priori and Kant's theory of Forms. Fortunately, I am not the only one
who has found this.

For example, note the following argument found at:
http://www.friesian.com/curved-1.htm
'The Euclidean nature of our imagination led Kant to say that although
the denial of the axioms of Euclid could be conceived without
contradiction, our intuition is limited by the form of space imposed
by our own minds on the world. While it is not uncommon to find claims
that the very existence of non-Euclidean geometry refutes Kant's
theory, such a view fails to take into account the meaning of the term
&quot;synthetic,&quot; which is that a synthetic proposition can be denied
without contradiction.'

I have never read this article before now, I simply searched
Friesian.com for the string &quot;Kant non-euclidean.&quot; That shows you
how easy it is to find good ideas which completely defeat the
vaguely-defined notions which non-Kantian scientists have garnered
from reading this or that scientific publication while sitting on the
toilet waiting for a subway train, and yet consider true. Then they
come into usenet spreading, from the pulpit of science, anti-Kant
gossip as some kind of gospel, thus lending it a respectability it
doesn't deserve. How scientific is that?

What non-Kantian scientists need to learn, before pontificating
on matters they have no clue about,  is that the
appearance/thing-in-itself distinction serves a real theoretical
function for physics. For &quot;...our intuition is limited by the form of
space imposed by our own minds on the world.&quot; What this says to
the modern scientist is that the thing-in-itself, studied by physics
and considered a space-time matrix, is not the appearance in
intuition, which gives us some other kind of space distinct from time.
Kant's distinction thus frees our scientific reasoning of the
mistaken, common-sense notion that appearance duplicates the reality
of physics, thus freeing physics to create theories that go far beyond
common-sense, and yet remain valid. Common-sense (whether it considers
appearances to be Euclidean or some other geometry) remains valid --
for appearances, but that is all.
