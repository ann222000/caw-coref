This is a test

Well, you spelled everything correctly and that's GOOD.
But, you forgot to put a period at the end and that's BAD...
But, you capitalized your T and that's GOOD,
But,you tested here instead of the proper test group and that's BAD.
But,then again,you are joining in a new group and that's GOOD,
But, if you post FS or WTB Ads that's BAD, that's VERY BAD....
But, if you have any knowledge of Antiques that's GOOD,
But,if you turn out to be just another 'yacker' that's BAD.
But, if you acknowledge the cabal and 'know' your place that's GOOD,
But,if you're just a new screen-name for Ronnie or Charleen that's
BAD,actually HORRID (and you won't like the punishment....... IMO

I'm Good at being Bad,
