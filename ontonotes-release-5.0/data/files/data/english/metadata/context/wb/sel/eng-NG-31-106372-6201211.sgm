Thank you to everyone who has responded to my prevous "grey area"
questions in the past - I have learned a lot about copyrights and music
legalities!  I have another one that I thought I'd throw out and see
what you guys think.

I have recently moved from Vinyl Djing to a Vinyl / MP3 Hybrid setup
(Serato Scratch Live for those interested).  This is what has me
thinking about all many music legal issues.  I want to remain
completely legal in my DJ practices.

I am assuming that if I purchase a song I am entitled to "fair use" - I
can have a copy on any format. iPod, Vinyl, CD, etc. I have learned
this from this newsgroup.

If I purchase a song on iTunes, the song contains Digital Rights
Management which restricts my ability to freely use said song.  I can
only burn to a CD X amount of times, can only share Y amount of times,
and if I remove the DRM from this song, this is technically illegal.

My question is this:
Lets say that I obtain a copy of a song that I really like by borrowing
a CD from a friend (or even lets say that I "pirate" the song and
download it from the internet).  I put this file on my computer ("rip
the mp3") and play it while I still have the CD from my friend, then
return the CD to my friend after listening.  At this point I have an
mp3 on my hard drive which I did not pay for, nor have the original CD
on my person.  I realize that I really enjoy this song and wish to own
it (and use it in a DJ set) and support the artist, plus I want to
remain "legal".  I go to iTunes (or really any legal download service)
and purchase the song and download it to my computer.  I do not,
however, wish to use the file that has DRM - especially since I need to
be able to make copies for playback on Turntables, etc.  I have paid
the copyright holder for the song I now own.  My main question is this:

* Since I have purchased the song but will be using the original MP3
which did not derive in any way from my purchased music, am I still
acting with in the law when I listen to this original MP3?
* What if I delete or "lose" in some way (but can still prove I
purchased the song from iTunes, if that matters) the purchased MP3, but
still retain the non-DRM'd song (Digital Backup, if you will) - does
that change my legal ownership of the song?
* Slightly side-topic: I own many albums on vinyl, but do not wish to
digitalize them myself - Am I legally able to download these songs from
the internet since I do legitmately own them? This would save hours and
hours (and hours!) of recording songs from vinyl to MP3.

Thank you very much in advance.

Laws,

You are a DJ and have some rather convoluted questions about copyrights
and contracts.
You have an illicit copy, borrowed from a friend, of a copyrighted album.
You wish to use this in your business. You propose to buy an mp3 copy of
this album. The mp3 comes with certain terms regarding copying that are
restrictive. You hope to use the mp3 purchase as "permission" to use the
borrowed music. I think I have this right
. The mp3 and the borrowed album are not the same work, most likely. The
music is, I think, mixed down differently. So you have a legal mp3 version
which allows you to make a few copies and an illegal borrowed version. They
may have the same title and songs but these are different works.
But I could be wrong. Since you do this as a business, it would be
business-like to peak with a lawyer. There are "music" lawyers who work with
musicians on contract and copyright matters and musicians aren't rich, so
the price of advice is probably affordable. I'm not sure you need a
copyrighted version of a song for your business since the bar should have an
agreement with ASCAP to allow you to use ASCAP's music.

Good luck,
Dave M.

correct analysis so far.  You have an "illegal" (or possibly merely an
'infringing' and/or unauthorized) copy.

There are _lots_ of alligators in this swamp.
1) Is what you purchased the _same_ as the unauthorized copy you already
had? Are you *sure*?  Did the artist record the piece at different
times/places?
2) You purchased a copy with DRM. Which it is a crime to remove/circumvent.
You ask if your 'illegally obtained' copy _without_ DRM is a 'legal'
*copy* of the copy you purchased.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;* What if I delete or &quot;lose&quot; in some way (but can still prove I

&gt;that change my legal ownership of the song?

Nope.  You *DO*NOT* own 'the song'.  You own a copy of a particular
recording of that song.  Your 'fair use' rights extend only as far as
making copies of the copy you legally own.

Again, _ARE_ they the 'same'?  Are the downloads derived from (analog)
vinyl identical to yours -- right down to any pops, clicks, and random
noise?  Was there any 'post processing' done in the making of the down-
loadable files?

Your 'fair use' rights, such as they are, do _not_ extend to 'any copies'
derived from the original work -- only to derivatives of a copy you legally
possess.

It is not illegal to burn it to CD and rip it from the CD,  just use a very
high bit rate for mp3 or ogg or FLAC when you rip the CD to reduce any further
degradation of the audio.
You only violate the law if you distribute the songs you purchased to others.

No, you don't own the song -- the copyright owner does.  You have
purchased a certain package of rights to copy and play the song, a
package that includes DRM restrictions.  By retaining an illegally
produced copy without those restrictions, you are exceeding your
rights.  This is no different in principle from making and retaining
an illegal copy of the song without purchasing anything.  It violates
the law.

Apart from that, I don't think anyone has successfully argued that a
copyright infringement may be "cured" by purchasing a legal copy of
the infringed material.  The policy argument against such a rule is
obvious:  the law would have no deterrent effect if an infringer could
count on getting a free pass by purchasing the material if he's
caught, or began to have second thoughts about possibly being caught.

No, for the same reason.

The idea that that you can "buy a song" from a service like iTunes
makes intuitive sense, but it's technically incorrect, and misleading.
It's a holdover from the days when people only had to think about
owning tangible things.   In a few more decades our language ought to
catch up with the concepts of intellectual property rights, and these
things will make more intuitive sense.

I don't understand how this example is the same as the previous.  If
it's considered fair use to make a copy for personal use of a song that
is on a vinyl record you have obtained legally, what difference does it
make what exact method you use to make the copy?

In the OP's first example, the illegal copy is obtained first, and then
one contemplates obtaining a legal copy "retroactively".  You state that
this won't fly, although my impression is that the copyright holders
don't want you in jail, they just want their money.

Although he did not say so, I'm assuming that the OP is proposing to
download from a pirate site -- if he were not, there would be no
issue.

It would make no difference how he made a copy, but he is not
proposing to make a copy of the work he owns.  He is proposing to make
an illegal copy of a different work in a different medium.  That work
is based on the same original recording, but it has been remastered,
perhaps with extensive processing, perhaps also with time compression
or editing, since the capacity of a standard CD is somewhat less than
the capacity of an LP.  In any case it comes to the listener with none
of the analog noise that inevitably accumulates on an LP with use.

Even if those things were not true, laws are almost always interpreted
strictly where illegal activity is  involved.  The OP is proposing to
download protected works from a site that is operated for the purpose
of illegal distribution.  No court is likely to listen sympathetically
to arguments about why, in this particular fact situation, it was
perfectly okay for him to do so.  The OP even could arguably be
committing contributory infringement by knowingly dealing with an
infringer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

That's a somewhat naïve view of intellectual property rights.  Laws
are usually shaped and interpreted in the light of policy
considerations, and in this case, an important policy is to preserve
the effectiveness of the law itself.  Please reread what I wrote about
deterrence earlier in this thread.  If courts are are not inclined to
be liberal with people who deal with known infringers, they also are
unlikely to be liberal where creating an exception would make the law
more uncertain in its application, and more difficult to enforce.

You have the right to make a copy of a phonorecord for certain
specified purposes(*).  If you bought a vinyl record, you have
a right to make a copy *of that vinyl record*.  With all the
imperfections that go with a vinyl record -- limited dynamic range,
noise from the stylus tracking the groove, etc.  Or if you bought a
tape, you could transfer it to CD, with all the frequency limitations
inherent in a tape recording.

You do *not* have the right to say that your tape or vinyl copy gives
you the right to a (permanent) high-quality digital copy downloaded
off the net.  You can copy what you have, not something better.

(*) Mostly so that you can play it on a different player, e.g., you
have a vinyl record but turntables are kind of hard to carry around,
so you make a copy on tape or CD for your Walkman/Diskman/equivalent.

Yes, but they want their money in full.  That often means they want at
least part of the statutory penalties (civil fines, in effect) for
illegal copying.

This gives you a choice: you can buy a CD for $17 (or whatever they
sell for these days) and keep it (and even make a copy in a different
medium *for your personal use*), or you can get an illegal copy off
the net.  If you get the illegal copy, you *might* get away with it,
if so you have "your" copy for free.  But if you get caught, you pay
$250 or whatever the penalty is.  This means you need to weigh the
chances of getting caught and having to pay $250 against the $17 that
you save by getting the "free" copy off the net.

In many cases you can get a limited-use copy (e.g., from iTunes,
Rhapsody) for a miniscule cost.  But those copies *are* limited
(Rhapsody, e.g., will allow you to play a given item up to 25 times,
after that you have to pay.)

And regardless of how you get the copy, you do *not* get the right to
perform the piece "publicly".  That means if you plan to play it in
some venue that is open to the public (a bar, a dance hall, whatever),
you need to either buy the appropriate license yourself, or make sure
that your venue has the appropriate license.  Most of the time, the
latter applies so you don't need to pay anything, but you should _ask_
ahead of time to be sure.

I've been to one place that featured live performances, but would not
allow performers to do songs that are copyright to somebody else,
because they didn't want to pay the license fees to ASCAP and BMI.  So
it wa strictly your own material or material written by somebody that
you have an arrangement with.

Copy of _what_??  *THAT* is the central issue.  Is it, or is it not, from
the same original?  Did the artist record the song multiple times?  Is the
was the downloadable file processed differently, during creation, from the
audio processing used to create the vinyl disk?

"personal use" lets you make copies of the artifact you have.  *NOT* to
acquire copies derived from a different (albeit _possibly_ related) artifact.

Thank you and the other respondents for the enlightening replies. If you
will indulge, I'd like to explore further -- IANAL, but I do have some
vinyl records I'd like to convert into computer files someday!

There are easily-obtained software tools that can clean up clicks and
pops from vinyl recordings, as well as enhance other sonic qualities.
Would the burden of proof in a legal proceeding be on me to show that I
personally had access to such equipment and used it to make my digital
copies that I listen to in my car?  Or could a friend do it for me as a
favor, using my original vinyl?  Or could I pay a commercial service to
do it?  Or, if a friend happened to own a commercial CD of the same
recording, and I ripped that.... it sounds like that's where I cross the
line, but I still have a hard time seeing the difference.

Some of the replies seem to claim that the noise is part of what I
originally purchased when I purchased the vinyl, I tend to think of it
as a product defect instead.  Suppose I purchase a paperback version of
a book, and due to vision problems I make enlarged photocopies of some
pages so I can read them -- I have enhanced the product for my own use,
even though I could have spent more money for a large-type, coffee-table
version of the same book.  Or suppose I OCR some of the text into a
computer and use voice-recognition software to "read it aloud" to me. Or
suppose I just ask my roommate to read it aloud into a voice recorder
and I play that back in my car.  Are these actions (enhancing the
quality or usefulness of my original artifact) copyright violations?
After all, I'm getting the benefit of an audio book without paying
double for it, yet it was created from my original artifact.

In the end, if the copyright holder can claim that all different
"copies" or versions of a work of art are one and the same for
enforcement purposes (for example, the bar band that plays cover
versions), why can't I, as the legitimate purchaser of a copy of a
copyrighted work for personal use, do the same (for example, my vinyl
record and a digital version of the same song that I ripped from a
friend's CD)?  After all, I don't think that what I purchased was 50
grams of petrochemicals and cardboard, but rather the right to privately
listen to a song whenever and wherever I choose.

Ironically, in the area of computer software, I'm not aware that anyone
cares about any link to an original artifact -- if I originally obtained
some floppy disks, but now I install the software from a CD-ROM or a
downloaded copy, all that matters is that I'm using the software under
the terms of the license I paid for, even if I threw out my pokey old
monochrome computer and now run the software on a shiny new fast
full-color computer. (I suppose this is not a copyright issue, but it
feels the same to me as a layman).

This is a perfect analogy.  This really is the root of what I am trying
to figure out.

Thank you everyone for your responses - I'm a little more 'refined' if
you will, but have not quite figured out exactly the answer to what I'm
looking for.  There was a very good point made though that I agree with
- technically any place that I would download a 'digital backup' from
would be a pirate site. I am unaware of any websites where you can
download music for 'free' as long as you prove that you owned the song
previously.

So this is also true - that iTunes and Rhapsody actually have "limited
use" licenses, even though you can burn these CDs legally and re-rip
them which essentially strip the DRM legally? This seems a bit silly to
me.

I had another post that got deleted but I did not get notified that it
was deleted... is that normal? I had one repost I made because I had
too many inline quotes from previous posts, but I got an email telling
me that. Oh well, I digress.

Thanks again!

That's because you're creating hypotheticals which are so close to the
line that the generally understood meaning of the law offers little
guidance, and precedent probably offers little guidance, either.

These are hypotheticals not in the sense that the situations are
implausible, but that it's implausible to suppose that  in the real
world, anyone would care.  When no one cares, the laws are not drafted
to ensure a clear result, and legal precedents which could clarify the
issues do not exist.

If you borrow your friend's CD and rip it, are you be breaking the
law?  I think so, and I have cited reasons that I consider persuasive.
Will you be sued?  Almost certainly not.  In the unlikely case that
someone ratted on you to the RIAA, there is just about zero chance
that they would care.

If you pay a commercial service to rip your LP and do a professional
cleanup job,  are you or they breaking the law?  I haven't researched
that, but my hunch is no, provided the copy was for personal use.

There are commercial services that do that type of thing.  I don't
think it's a very big business.  IF it became significant enough to
register on the recording industry's radar screens, and IF someone
decided to take legal action, and IF the defendants were stubborn
enough and well enough financed to mount an effective defense, the
case might become a media event in the intellectual property
community, with lots of attorneys making conflicting predictions about
the outcome.  Unless those things happen, the question is more or less
in the nature of a late-night college dorm bull session.

I don't mean to belittle the questions you're asking; they are
intellectually interesting, and well worth discussing for the sake of
the light that the answers shed on broader issues.  However, I don't
see a lot of value in seeking clear-cut answers to questions that are
formulated to have none.

You assert your 'digital copy' is a derivative of the vinyl you legally
own.

Plaintiff asserts it is _not_ from that source.

Absent _any_ evidence either way, plaintiff has produced the required
'preponderance of the evidence' to substantiate their claim.  Judgement
for the defendant.

HOWEVER, if they provide _anything_ to support their claim, you have to
rebut that claim with evidence that is 'at least as strong' as what they
present.

_Not_ violations, *because* they are derived from the artifact you possess.

Changing the computer is the equivalent of changing the light you read

With computer software, the 'rights' issue doesn't rely as much on
'copyright' as the 'license' under which it was made available.

liable for *copyright*infringement* for 'copying' a computer program

awarded to the copyright owner.

I think it would be sufficient for you to testify that you did so.
Then it would be up to the other side's attornies to try to prove you
were lying.  The burden of proof is, after all, on the plaintiff.

They could cross question you, "how did you get access to the
equipment", and you could give a list of freeware/shareware products
that you used, or name a friend who has sophisticated equipment.

The real kicker, though, would be if the commercial CDs, iTunes
versions, etc. have been mixed differently from the vinyl ones.  They
could show a correspondance between the digital version and your
version, that wouldn't exist in a cleaned up version of the vinyl
record.  That would demolish your claim of legitimacy pretty fast.

Or not, if you in fact just cleaned up the copy you made from the
vinyl LP.  Then it would match the instrumentation, mixing, etc. of
the LP pretty closely, perhaps re-equalized or otherwise modified to
your taste, but *not* with certain instruments or voices made louder,
softer, moved from left to right, etc.

Like anything else in court, it eventually comes down to the evidence.
You present your evidence, they present theirs, and a judge or jury
decides who is more believable.

Because if you clean up the vinyl, you have used the rights you
obtained when you bought the vinyl record.  If you rip a commercial
CD that you didn't buy, you have used right you _don't_ have, and

No, the noise isn't part of what you purchased.  But it's fairly easy
to tell a cleaned up copy from a vinyl recording vs. a copy of a CD.
As other people have mentioned, the CD is often remixed.  Even if they
haven't done that, the cleaned up clicks and pops show up as moments
of silence in your (legitimate) copy, which would _not_ be present in
the waveform of a copy made from a digital original.

Believe that if it comes to a trial on the question, the music
company's lawyers will show up with printouts of the waveform of the
CD, the waveform of a (good quality) vinyl recording, and the waveform
of _your_ CD.  And they will compare them, millisecond by millisecond,
explaining any discrepancies to the judge/jury.

I don't see that they claim that all different copies or versions are
the same.  On the contrary, each version has its own rights attached.
_Some_ of those rights belong to the creators of the music -- the
composer and the lyricist.  Other rights belong to whoever preformed
that particular version.

If I record my interpretation of "I Want to Hold Your Hand" (a
"cover" of the song), I have to pay the Beatles' licensing organization
the statutory fee, so much for each copy that I sell.  But _they_ don't
have the right to distribute _my_ performance, that right belongs to
me.

Oddly, a software license grants you certain rights beyond what pure
copyright allows.  For example, you may have the right to make one or
more copies for backup purposes, in case the original media fails.
This is *not* a right that you get with, e.g., a book or phonorecord.
You can make copies to use on a different type of player, but *not* so
you'll have a backup (and even _that_ right, AFAIK, is specific to
sound recordings, *not* to books).

Software license also (attempt to) limit the rights you have under
pure copyright.  Whether those limits are really enforceable is still
being litigated, but AFAIK most courts have held that "first purchase"
applies just as much to software as it does to books, records, etc.
OTOH, if the license grants you rights _not_ provided under pure
copyright, you may have to choose which set of rights you want to use,
not be able to take the "best of both worlds".  Again, this isn't hard
and fast law (yet).

Itunes is actually fairly DJ-friendly--- although if you want to stream
iTunes tracks over the internet (e.g., if you want to set up your own
radio station) you have to use a hosting provider who charges you a
(not too horrendous) fee for using copyrighted material.

If it's just a question of getting hold of that "one song which you

cents per song is the a la carte price.  So the hypothetical
contortions which Music Laws speculated about would be a lot of effort

CD and owning an iTunes track are weakened somewhat, BTW, by the fact
that the ownership of a CD actually doesn't confer you any rights to

If I correctly understand what Music Laws is saying, he is right .

The DRM provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act are rather
convoluted, but they boil down to this: it IS NOT legal to make or
sell a device or service whose primary purpose is to circumvent use
restrictions, but it IS legal to circumvent them oneself.

In other words, if you "buy a song" through iTunes and want to crack
the protection that only lets you make three copies or whatever, have
at it; that's perfectly legal.  But it's not legal to do the same
thing for another person, or to make or sell a program or gadget that
enables another person to do the same thing.

Note that it's not legal to make or sell a device whose primary
purpose is to circumvent access protection, OR to circumvent it
oneself.  This would apply to gadgets for pirating cable TV signals,
for example.

The relevant part of the law is 17 USC §1201.

Burn-and-rip has no sound quality loss (if you do it right).

Burning for my own use (in a portable CD player) is legal (fair use).

So here is an update that will help to solve this issue of 'why' I am
wondering this. This week I got "Serato Scratch Live" which allows me
to play MP3 files on a traditional turntable / mixer setup. In short it
lets me manipulate a time-encoded vinyl record to play these files back
just like the MP3 itself was on the vinyl. IE: I drop the needle in the
middle of the record, the middle of the mp3 is sent to my mixer.

The problem is that with iTunes you cannot take the songs you purchased
(which have DRM) and play them in Serato - this is the nature of DRM.

So if I understand correctly, it is legal for me to burn to a CD, rip
from CD, and play in Serato.  It *may* be legal (in the sense that it
may not be possible to prove otherwise) if I acquire a song of the
exact same recording, mix, composition, etc. from another source and
use this in Serato. The re-ripped song and the "other" song are almost
identical (within the error range of the ripping software settings, or
perhaps transcoding between different audio encodings).

It is still a little unclear (but perhaps actually "not legal") if I am
able to play back MP3s that I own on vinyl but did not rip from the
original source.

Not to stretch this to a point of obscurity, after all I do appreciate
everyone's input very much so, but what about the following situation
(as ridiculous as it may be):
I own "Hotel California" by The Eagles on Vinyl. I want it in MP3
Format.
I borrow my friend's copy of "Hotel California", on Vinyl, and rip it
to my computer.  I would imagine that this copy is now "legal". I
ripped from vinyl of the "same recording", but I did not use my own
copy of the vinyl. Would this change if my copy had a large scratch
across the face?

Now, what if my friend instead had a CD copy of "Hotel California" -
one of those special releases that are exactly (aside from digital
remastering perhaps?) like their vinyl counter-parts. This is where it
becomes "illegal" right? Even though that CD was released to be a "just
like the vinyl album release" - it is still illegal since there may or
may not be any kind of digital remastering done that would differ from
the vinyl.  Does this change anything if I were able to guarantee there
was no difference? Say I go to a studio and obtain the master tracks.
I cut a copy to vinyl and a copy (unaltered) to CD. (Or say I purchase
the vinyl, and my friend purchases the CD from the producer). These are
the exact same - but can I cross-rip as in the previous example? I
would imagine so...

So the point I guess I'm trying to make is what has to be "added" to a
music piece (assuming my assumptions are correct) to make this piece no
longer the same as the original? This also goes along the lines of how
much distortion can you do to someone's sample that you use in your own
original piece before it no longer is considered a derivative work.

There have been so really awesome responses so far - thanks to everyone
who has participated in humoring my original question :)

At least its friday! :)

Well I don't know about Serato... but some DJ programs do allow you to
use your iTunes library.  As long as you are a subscriber, etc., all
you have to do is pull down the track from your iTunes library and use
it just like a CD track.

I will also say again that the physical possession of a copy of a vinyl
record or a CD does NOT confer any rights to perform the music in
public and/or incorporate it into another derivative work.

&gt;to my computer.  I would imagine that this copy is now &quot;legal&quot;. I
&gt;ripped from vinyl of the &quot;same recording&quot;, but I did not use my own
&gt;copy of the vinyl.
">

You imagine wrongly.

You have made a infringing copy of your friends record. Not a copy of
your record.

Even if they may have the same 'ancestor', some number of generations
back, they are _not_ 'the same thing'.  No more than identical twins
are the same person under law.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;                   Would this change if my copy had a large scratch
&gt;across the face?
">

Nope.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Now, what if my friend instead had a CD copy of &quot;Hotel California&quot; -
&gt;one of those special releases that are exactly (aside from digital
&gt;remastering perhaps?) like their vinyl counter-parts. This is where it
&gt;becomes &quot;illegal&quot; right?
">

Wrong.  it's _already_ illegal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;                         Even though that CD was released to be a &quot;just
&gt;like the vinyl album release&quot; - it is still illegal since there may or
&gt;may not be any kind of digital remastering done that would differ from
&gt;the vinyl.  Does this change anything if I were able to guarantee there
&gt;was no difference? Say I go to a studio and obtain the master tracks.
">

If you _legally_ acquire the master tracks, you can make copies to the
media of your choice.  If you acquire them by means other than a 'legal'
purchase, you have *zero* rights to copy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I cut a copy to vinyl and a copy (unaltered) to CD. (Or say I purchase
&gt;the vinyl, and my friend purchases the CD from the producer). These are
&gt;the exact same - but can I cross-rip as in the previous example? I
&gt;would imagine so...
">

Repeating:  you imagine wrongly.  :)

The vinyl and the CD are *NOT* the same. Your "legal right" to copy
extends _only_ to the actual copy you own.  To make it absolutely clear,
if 'somebody else' owns *exactly* the same recording -- e.g. they have
a piece of vinyl that is the same record as the one you have -- same
same record company, same catalog number, same 'pressing', etc. -- you
do *not* have any right to copy _that_ record for *your* use.

You have rights *only* with regard to the specific copy you purchased.
*NOT* to "it's brothers and it's sisters and it's cousins and it's aunts".

It is not enough that the source of the copy be 'descended' from the
same 'ancestor' as the copy you own.  Your copy must be a 'direct ancestor'
of the copy in question.

That is how the law _is_ interpreted.  In fact, the _letter_ of copyright
statute in the U.S. makes no provision for 'personal use' copying. There is
case law that holds that copies _of_a_copy_you_own_, made for personal use
only, are not infringing.  There is _no_ case law supporting the making of
a copy of an item 'similar in all respects' to the copy that you own.

Now, if you want to discuss 'what you can get away with', in violation of
the letter of the law, well that's a whole different issue.

"What you can get away with" is not a measure of compliance with the law.
You're asserting "it's legal if I don't get caught".

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So the point I guess I'm trying to make is what has to be &quot;added&quot; to a
&gt;music piece (assuming my assumptions are correct) to make this piece no
&gt;longer the same as the original?
">

Your assumptions are *NOT* correct, thus our question has no answer. :)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;                                 This also goes along the lines of how
&gt;much distortion can you do to someone's sample that you use in your own
&gt;original piece before it no longer is considered a derivative work.
">

*Anything* 'based on' the original piece, is, _by_definition_, a derivative
work.

Even if it is distorted to the point that it is "unrecognizable by ear" as
the same piece, it is _still_ 'derived from' the original,

&gt; The problem is that with iTunes you cannot take the songs you purchased

iTunes contains specific features, and the iTunes Music Store license,
allows you to copy and burn songs from iTunes.  Look in Help under the
topic "Create Playlists and burn CDs", "Burning CDs or DVDs", and
"Creating your own audio CDs" and "Creating your own MP3 CDs".
The resulting files are not encumbered with any DRM, because the
purpose and intent is to allow you to play them on other devices.

So you can stick the resulting disc into Serato.

By the way, you might reconsider whether the audio quality of your
original iTunes downloads are good enough to play in public.
The 128 kbps AAC format may not sound very good.

Apple has said they might change over to their "Lossless"
format sometime in the future.   Then you will presumably
have to re-purchase all your songs over again, probably
for more money, and they will take up more space.
No mention has been made of the DRM for these, nor if
the license will still allow you to burn them, etc.

For professionaly work, I would always just buy the entire
actual CD (not an iTunes Music Store download), and rip
it myself.   You can rip it using iTunes; that's no issue.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So if I understand correctly, it is legal for me to burn to a CD, rip
&gt; from CD, and play in Serato.

Now we're talking aobout something else.  If you have purchased a CD,
I believe it is legal for you to copy it into other formats such as
MP3 and play it on some other device.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I borrow my friend's copy of &quot;Hotel California&quot;, on Vinyl, and rip it

That's the same as the CD above, in practice.  (I think it might be
even more straightforward, legally, for those particular artifacts.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now, what if my friend instead had a CD copy of &quot;Hotel California&quot; -
&gt; one of those special releases that are exactly (aside from digital
&gt; remastering perhaps?) like their vinyl counter-parts.

No, the Digitally Remastered version is not the same WORK as
the vinyl album that you have.  (It may be a derivative work,
but that's not interesting.)  You cannot copy your friend's CD on
the basis that you have a vinyl recording of something very similar.
Even if it doesn't say Remastered or whatever, then it is still
probably not the same work, anyway, and you are still out of luck.

Record your own MP3 of Hotel California from your vinyl and
clean it up using software.   Or just buy your own copy of
the CD, which is much less expensive than doing it yourself.

Also, none of the above has nothing to do with a performance license
to play the songs in public.  For that, you need to get a licenses
from ASCAP and BMI.  If you are doing this in a bar, ask them - the
usually have a license that covers you.  If they do not, you will
have to obtain the licenses yourself.  Yes, they do regularly send
out people to spy on venues like that, and yes, they can hold you
legally responsible for each and every one of their songs you play.

Thank you for the insight, and that last paragraph of yours is
awesome ;)

You are completely right when it comes to the quality of the iTunes
downloading.  I have realized that this isn't even an issue since, as
you stated, the quality of the songs isn't worth the download anyway.
I've decided to download instead from services (which do not have DRM)
like beatport.com, traxsource.com, and junodownloads.com.

I've also started ripping my own vinyl - which is a pain but it feels
a lot more 'rewarding' when you finally get that album ripped into a
lossless file.

As far as the BMI is concerned, and this is a completely new topic,
but do you know if licensing fees for public performances are
necessary for licenses like Creative Commons? Not that I want to rip
anyone off, I just want to know what I am able to play in public in a
venue that has no BMI / ASCAP licenses (and is not paying me to play).

And lastly - if I create beats on something like fruity loops, do I
own 100% of the copyright permissions, especially if I am using drum
beats that are included in the packages? That would be a bit
ridiculous if you had to get permission to use songs you make with
$500 software to play in public.

Thanks again!

Copyright law gives the author of the music the owner of a song
the right to license its public performance.  To see what rights
you are being granted by any particular license, you would have
to read it and see.  (It doesn't matter in what way a given license
might be "like" some other license -- it only matters what it
actually says.)

There are two different things going on when you do that.
First, you are composing music: musical notation on a page
indicating times, accents, notes, rests, and in the case of
percussion, the instrumentation.    The moment that you record
that (for example, on paper, in some computer program file),
you own the rights to your music.

The second thing that's going on in your scenario is that you are
playing your musical compsition through a "generator" (that is, a
synthesizer).  The synthesizer contains recordings (waveforms) of the
instrument's sounds: the sound of some real or imgainary snare drum or
individual piano key being struck.  It seems to me that the waveforms
of those sounds could be copyrighted, and conceivably you would need a
license to play those sounds in public.  We're talking here about the
sound of the musical instrument itself, not the song being played on it.
I don't know what the law says about this -- perhaps someone else will
fill us in -- but I guess one of two things must be true.

One possibility is that you do not need a license to publicly play
those sounds.  The sounds were given to you specifically for that
purpose by the person who owned the waveform copyrights.
The other possibility is that you are required to have a license,
which may or may not have been granted to you when you obtained the
waveform as part of (or plugin module to) the synthesizer.
The other wrinkle here is that you might also need a mechanical
reproduction license, if you're going to record the playing of
those notes (even though it's of your own song).  The convergence
of audio generating and recording technology makes my head hurt.
Certainly if you are sampling some other music (not built into the
synthesizer) as part your song, you are creating a derivative work
and will need licenses.  I don't quite know what happens if the
"sample" was only one note, and it was provided to you directly.

(I probably haven't answered your question very well, sorry.)

I'm not a copyright lawyer and have no idea what Fruity Loops is,
other than a sugary breakfast cereal with food coloring.   But I'll
assume it's some kind of music creation software with built-in chords,
riffs, different instrument tones, etc. that turns your computer and
sound card into something  like an electronic keyboard or combo organ
with recording capability.

Read the license that came with the software.   Chances are the $500
you paid for it does allow you to create original works using the
beats and riffs provided by the software without paying any further
royalties to the software's copyright holder (its author or
distributor).   IMO for them to ask otherwise would be analogous to
Mont Blanc charging royalties to Elmore Leonard for his next best-
selling novel because he wrote it with a fountain pen using their
ink.   All they provide is a set of standard tools for you to use, so
the original creative work is yours alone.

Yes, much like I would own the copyright to the text of this message.

[snip part about how the music may be sent through a synthesizer or such
and the samples of music used to produce the end results may be
copyrighted.]

There also may be an issue of the formatting of the resulting file. Such
as if I was typing this message into M$ Word, I would own the copyright
on the text that I typed in but M$ may (or might not) own the copyright
on the rest of the resulting .doc file and the way it's all put together
in that file and you'd need to see what the license for the program says
about that. M$, in this example, grants free license on the resulting
.doc file (if they do own any copyright in it. It may actually fall
under a patent issue instead of copyright issue.) but you'd still need a
program to actually read the file and that's where they make their money.
