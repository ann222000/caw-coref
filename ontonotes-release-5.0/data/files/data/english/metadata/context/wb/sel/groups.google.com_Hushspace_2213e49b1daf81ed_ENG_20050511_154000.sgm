Damn you :( It was only Captain Scarlet :p It said &quot;blah foo, Amerie,
etc. faders, and Girls Aloud&quot;. So I was thinking they'd be on somewhere
near the end or the middle. Of course they were on right at the fecking
start.

Must admit, Holly was looking nice this morning.

I guess a few of you will jump on me/disagree with me on this (but tbh
I don't care ;op) but I'd rather watch Holly Willougbhy than Girls
(should't be) Aloud any day - but then you probably knew that.....

Well yeah ;) But seriously who watches Girls Aloud for their singing
talent? ;) Thing is, you've got at least two hours of Holly, I had like
3 minutes of Girls Aloud and I missed 'em :p So you should feel sorry
for me :D :p

I guess no-one else capped the &quot;performance&quot; then? :(

Here's the vid I think 40MB, I watched it with the sound off. Despite Mr.

said this this. As usual not my caps or vid, so credit the fine bloke that
sets his VCR. I found this yousendit link, and d/led it a put it up again,
where it was originally it wasn't going to last very long. If you can't

We did some Lisa Loeb pics in here back in March. She's a cutie with a unique look and sweet little songs. I'd post some more pics, but I already posted everything I had last time and don't want to subject the group to 5MB of reposts.

sister's best m8s I had a massive crush on when I was a kid.

Alone
Tails ( )
I want to be by myself, sometimes I do
I don't want to be left behind, but sometimes I'm left by you
I press my tongue to the top of my mouth
Cause my jaw, was tired from the thinking
And I stretched my toes to the end of the couch
'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all alone
You do not cheat me of my childhood
You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
When you do the fantastic I am amazed
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so alone?

You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone with you
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?
Oh, why do I feel so alone?

Lisa Loeb's only real hit that still gets airtime in the US was the song &quot;Stay&quot; (which has the lyric &quot;you say&quot;). Some of the pop stations still play it once in a while.

So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all alone
You do not cheat me of my childhood
You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
When you do the fantastic I am amazed
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so alone?

You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone with you
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?
Oh, why do I feel so alone?

I think you mean Alone from the album Tails. Lisa looks like one of my

I don't have any of her music, but she is listed on my Launchcast thingy.

Alone

I don't want to be left behind, but sometimes I'm left by you

'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping

My name is not Luca though.

Stay
Tails ( )
You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time so

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I mised you
Yeah yeah, I missed you

You say I only hear what I want to:
I don't listen hard, don't pay attention to the distance that you're running
To anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care, I'm only hearing negative: no, no, no

So I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song:
Lover's in love and the other's run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
Dying since the day they were born
Well, well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take me anyhow, or anywhere with you

You said that I was naive and I thought that I was strong
I thought, &quot;hey, I can leave, I can leave.&quot;
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you
Yeah, I miss you

You said, &quot;I caught you 'cause I want you and one day I'll let you go
&quot;You try to give away a keeper, or keep me
'Cause you know you're just scared to lose
And you say, &quot;Stay.&quot;

You say I only hear what I want to

You do not cheat me of my childhood
You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
When you do the fantastic I am amazed
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so alone?

You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone with you
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?
Oh, why do I feel so alone?

I think you mean Alone from the album Tails. Lisa looks like one of my
sister's best m8s I had a massive crush on when I was a kid.

Stay
Tails ( http://www.absolutedivas.com/lisa/lyrics/index.php)
You say I only hear what I want to
You say I talk so all the time so

And I thought what I felt was simple
And I thought that I don't belong
And now that I am leaving
Now I know that I did something wrong 'cause I mised you
Yeah yeah, I missed you

You say I only hear what I want to:
I don't listen hard, don't pay attention to the distance that you're
running
To anyone, anywhere
I don't understand if you really care, I'm only hearing negative: no, no,
no

So I turned the radio on, I turned the radio up
And this woman was singing my song:
Lover's in love and the other's run away
Lover is crying 'cause the other won't stay
Some of us hover when we weep for the other who was
Dying since the day they were born
Well, well, this is not that
I think that I'm throwing, but I'm thrown

And I thought I'd live forever, but now I'm not so sure
You try to tell me that I'm clever
But that won't take me anyhow, or anywhere with you

You said that I was naive and I thought that I was strong
I thought, &quot;hey, I can leave, I can leave.&quot;
Oh, but now I know that I was wrong, 'cause I missed you
Yeah, I miss you

You said, &quot;I caught you 'cause I want you and one day I'll let you go
&quot;You try to give away a keeper, or keep me
'Cause you know you're just scared to lose
And you say, &quot;Stay.&quot;

You say I only hear what I want to

I want to be by myself, sometimes I do
I don't want to be left behind, but sometimes I'm left by you
I press my tongue to the top of my mouth
Cause my jaw, was tired from the thinking
And I stretched my toes to the end of the couch
'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?

During that time was when I got heavily (excuse the pun) into Metallica, and
that has continued since. 1995 i was a 4th year at high school and 1997 i

'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all alone
You do not cheat me of my childhood
You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
When you do the fantastic I am amazed
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so
alone?

You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone with
you
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?
Oh, why do I feel so alone?

And I stretched my toes to the end of the couch

So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all alone
You do not cheat me of my childhood

You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone with

So what is this weather, and what is this darkness

I've heard of Lisa Loeb Jeri, if it makes any difference to you ;op.

I don't have any of her music, but she is listed on my Launchcast
thingy.

Alone
Tails ( http://www.absolutedivas.com/lisa/lyrics/index.php)
I want to be by myself, sometimes I do
I don't want to be left behind, but sometimes I'm left by you
I press my tongue to the top of my mouth
Cause my jaw, was tired from the thinking
And I stretched my toes to the end of the couch
'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all alone
You do not cheat me of my childhood
You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
When you do the fantastic I am amazed
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so
alone?

You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone with
you
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?
Oh, why do I feel so alone?

I'm not much into Metallica anymore. Once I realized the kind of people that listen to Metallica around here most likely drive a Bitchin' Camaro and live in a double wide I sort of stopped liking them. They're just too cliche anymore, plus the whole Napster thing really turned me off. It didn't help that they haven't had a decent album since then either.

'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all alone

I did not like their last album. Personally liked the crowd that listened to Metallica. Not one of us owned a Camaro. I also did not like Napster much. The idea of getting music for free is kind of stupid. It makes music too disposable, and people don't tend to appreciate it much. It also showed when The Offspring offered some stuff with the Napster logo on it, and Napster was so quick to get the courts to make them stop, while people could download The Offspring stuff off of their site for free. That seemed to turn alot of people off of Metallica. Seems to happen when groups stand up for something.

I'm not much into Metallica anymore. Once I realized the kind of people that listen to Metallica around here most likely drive a Bitchin' Camaro and live in a double wide I sort of stopped liking them. They're just too cliche anymore, plus the whole Napster thing really turned me off. It didn't help that they haven't had a decent album since then either.

I don't have any of her music, but she is listed on my Launchcast

Alone
Tails ( http://www.absolutedivas.com/lisa/lyrics/index.php )
I want to be by myself, sometimes I do
I don't want to be left behind, but sometimes I'm left by you
I press my tongue to the top of my mouth
Cause my jaw, was tired from the thinking
And I stretched my toes to the end of the couch
'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all alone
You do not cheat me of my childhood
You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
When you do the fantastic I am amazed
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so
alone?

You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone with
you
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?
Oh, why do I feel so alone?

To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if people go
off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a fan in the
first place.

They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't all
have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the time.
The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go off
them. All the band were after was the money for what they had produced and
why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of working on a
specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for the entire
month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just give it for
nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the record, the
band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and recordings the
made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is wrong. Maybe in
your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album that for the
most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

I understand your point Waste. The artist deserve money for their hard work.
However, the whole download thing has evolved now. Now it's a way for the
new artist to have their music listened too without all the added cost of
getting their song out there. Also a lot of singers put they're new stuff out
there to see how it fares before they pump a lot of advertising money behind a
flop.

We may not like the system, but it's one of those things that will not be
stopped now. It's here and it's not going anywhere. Who knows what it will
eventually evolve into, but it's not going anywhere.

There are some people out there that have been discovered because of it.
they're names escapes me now, but they are names that we all know now.

I did not like their last album. Personally liked the crowd that listened to
Metallica. Not one of us owned a Camaro. I also did not like Napster much.
The idea of getting music for free is kind of stupid. It makes music too
disposable, and people don't tend to appreciate it much. It also showed when The
Offspring offered some stuff with the Napster logo on it, and Napster was so
quick to get the courts to make them stop, while people could download The
Offspring stuff off of their site for free. That seemed to turn alot of people
off of Metallica. Seems to happen when groups stand up for something.

I know that there's a chain of people who need to get paid before the
money gets to the artist(s), but I also firmly believe that if the
&quot;industry&quot; were to reduce the price of CDs etc in the shops, then far
less people would bother to download stuff, as, IMO, it's always
better to have the original, even if only for the booklets, lyrics
etc.

I didn't write that.
I still buy the CD if it really good or an artist that I really like. I'd
rather see them get paid. But for the one's that have just one good song on a
cd, and that the word that I get from my friends, I'll just download it. I
hated buying cds and there only be one or two decent songs on it.

To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if people go
off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a fan in the
first place.

They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't all
have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the time.
The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go off
them. All the band were after was the money for what they had produced and
why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of working on a
specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for the entire
month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just give it for
nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the record, the
band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and recordings the
made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is wrong. Maybe in
your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album that for the
most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

I'm not much into Metallica anymore. Once I realized the kind of people
that listen to Metallica around here most likely drive a Bitchin' Camaro and
live in a double wide I sort of stopped liking them. They're just too
cliche anymore, plus the whole Napster thing really turned me off. It
didn't help that they haven't had a decent album since then either.

I've heard of Lisa Loeb Jeri, if it makes any difference to you ;op.

I don't have any of her music, but she is listed on my Launchcast
thingy.

Alone
Tails ( http://www.absolutedivas.com/lisa/lyrics/index.php )
I want to be by myself, sometimes I do
I don't want to be left behind, but sometimes I'm left by you
I press my tongue to the top of my mouth
Cause my jaw, was tired from the thinking
And I stretched my toes to the end of the couch
'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all
alone
You do not cheat me of my childhood
You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
When you do the fantastic I am amazed
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so
alone?

You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone with
you
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?
Oh, why do I feel so alone?

Alot of groups put out teasers, and some sell complete downloads of a CD off of their sites. Lots offer up videos, and they know full well that once they are out there they have no control over them. One of the big things is why should someone else be able to profit from someone elses hard work and intellectual property when all the did is slap up a web site. I have no problem with fans swaping stuff, but when it is someone making millions off of other peoples stuff. There has always been bootleged stuff, but Napster took it to a new high or low. I know it pissed off alot of people who liked getting free music. It seems to have changed the music business greatly already. I do not see people living so much for the music, or caring for it the way we did in the 70's and 80's. It just seems to them to be more of a background noise.

There are more and more CD's with various types of coping protection. I am not sure how good these are.

I understand your point Waste. The artist deserve money for their hard work. However, the whole download thing has evolved now. Now it's a way for the new artist to have their music listened too without all the added cost of getting their song out there. Also a lot of singers put they're new stuff out there to see how it fares before they pump a lot of advertising money behind a flop.

We may not like the system, but it's one of those things that will not be stopped now. It's here and it's not going anywhere. Who knows what it will eventually evolve into, but it's not going anywhere.

There are some people out there that have been discovered because of it. they're names escapes me now, but they are names that we all know now.

I did not like their last album. Personally liked the crowd that listened to Metallica. Not one of us owned a Camaro. I also did not like Napster much. The idea of getting music for free is kind of stupid. It makes music too disposable, and people don't tend to appreciate it much. It also showed when The Offspring offered some stuff with the Napster logo on it, and Napster was so quick to get the courts to make them stop, while people could download The Offspring stuff off of their site for free. That seemed to turn alot of people off of Metallica. Seems to happen when groups stand up for something.

It use to cost about 10 dollars Canadian for a LP, now it is about 16 dollars for a CD. You can get them second hand for about 10 bucks here. I don't see it as that bad. If you have to specially order them then they cost more. You can always join the CD clubs like columbia house, but I personally don't like them. I understand there are places on the net, where you can buy the downloads, and the artists get paid. I don't know the cost of these.

money gets to the artist(s), but I also firmly believe that if the

less people would bother to download stuff, as, IMO, it's always
better to have the original, even if only for the booklets, lyrics

I usually find the groups that have single songs that I like, I end up getting bored with the song too quick. Some of the so called one hit wonders have some stuff that did not make it to the radio as good. I love the entire Dexy's Midnight Runners album, and Nene of 99 Red Ballons has alot of other songs that are great.

I didn't write that.
I still buy the CD if it really good or an artist that I really like. I'd rather see them get paid. But for the one's that have just one good song on a cd, and that the word that I get from my friends, I'll just download it. I hated buying cds and there only be one or two decent songs on it.

new high or low. I know it pissed off alot of people who liked getting free
music. It seems to have changed the music business greatly already. I do not see
people living so much for the music, or caring for it the way we did in the

There are more and more CD's with various types of coping protection. I am

I think the free downloading sent a message, and has helped keep the prices down abit. Still it is all huge companies running it all now, and they have bloated bureaucracies to support. They killed the independents, and control the air play. They even learned to control the area of angry music that once propelled the rebellious youth. They fill it with crap, and turn the youthful anger inward instead of out at the establishment where it should be. Music is becoming more a dull background music instead of the voice of the youth.

Nah, I wasn't much of a fan. Actually, I was, but damn radio beat it to death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations in town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of the three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they would play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no one plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one song every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice for a few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played in heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the new songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them. Most of the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in their Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me... *meh*. I still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time, but for the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become. Hell, just like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of the group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know I'd lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band ever and have grown tired of their music being played to death.

To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if people go
off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a fan in the
first place.

They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't all
have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the time.
The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go off
them. All the band were after was the money for what they had produced and
why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of working on a
specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for the entire
month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just give it for
nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the record, the
band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and recordings the
made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is wrong. Maybe in
your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album that for the
most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

I've heard of Lisa Loeb Jeri, if it makes any difference to you ;op.

I don't have any of her music, but she is listed on my Launchcast
thingy.

Alone
Tails ( http://www.absolutedivas.com/lisa/lyrics/index.php )
I want to be by myself, sometimes I do
I don't want to be left behind, but sometimes I'm left by you
I press my tongue to the top of my mouth
Cause my jaw, was tired from the thinking
And I stretched my toes to the end of the couch
'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all
alone
You do not cheat me of my childhood
You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
When you do the fantastic I am amazed
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so
alone?

You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone with
you
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?
Oh, why do I feel so alone?

I have to agree with that. I've bought CDs after I've gone and downloaded nearly the entire thing already anyway. Aside from the better quality, it's nice to have the album art and to listen to the songs with the timing and order the artist intended. Sometimes it gives you some real insight into the music.

It use to cost about 10 dollars Canadian for a LP, now it is about 16

it as that bad. If you have to specially order them then they cost more. You
can always join the CD clubs like columbia house, but I personally don't

I know that there's a chain of people who need to get paid before the
money gets to the artist(s), but I also firmly believe that if the
&quot;industry&quot; were to reduce the price of CDs etc in the shops, then far
less people would bother to download stuff, as, IMO, it's always
better to have the original, even if only for the booklets, lyrics
etc.

If they're anything like DVD copy protection then they're nothing more than a minor annoyance and not much of a threat to those who really want to copy. I've never really tried to copy a CD before though, so it's hard for me to say for sure.

Alot of groups put out teasers, and some sell complete downloads of a CD off of their sites. Lots offer up videos, and they know full well that once they are out there they have no control over them. One of the big things is why should someone else be able to profit from someone elses hard work and intellectual property when all the did is slap up a web site.

I do not see people living so much for the music, or caring for it the way we did in the 70's and 80's. It just seems to them to be more of a background noise.

There are more and more CD's with various types of coping protection. I am not sure how good these are.

CDs don't generally have *any* copy protection. The record companies
keep trying to introduce it but thankfully the public aren't convinced.
I personally won't buy a copy-protected CD and have sent them back
before when I've ordered them over the net.

I know the feeling, when radio does play Metallica it is usually the same songs over and over. Still when I like a group, there is little that will stop me from disliking them. I even still like Gary Glitters music, even though he turned out to be a huge pervert. I don't listen to the radio that much. I have a hard time, with all the commercials, and then trying to find more than one good song played in a row. I don't think of Metallica as close to the greatest band on earth. They were good, but could never compare to Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Scorpions, or Helloween. So many much better than them. I even liked Megadeth better.

Nah, I wasn't much of a fan. Actually, I was, but damn radio beat it to death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations in town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of the three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they would play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no one plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one song every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice for a few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played in heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the new songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them. Most of the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in their Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me... *meh*. I still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time, but for the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become. Hell, just like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of the group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know I'd lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band ever and have grown tired of their music being played to death.

To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if people go
off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a fan in the
first place.

They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't all
have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the time.
The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go off
them. All the band were after was the money for what they had produced and
why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of working on a
specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for the entire
month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just give it for
nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the record, the
band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and recordings the
made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is wrong. Maybe in
your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album that for the
most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

I've heard of Lisa Loeb Jeri, if it makes any difference to you ;op.

I don't have any of her music, but she is listed on my Launchcast
thingy.

Alone
Tails ( http://www.absolutedivas.com/lisa/lyrics/index.php )
I want to be by myself, sometimes I do
I don't want to be left behind, but sometimes I'm left by you
I press my tongue to the top of my mouth
Cause my jaw, was tired from the thinking
And I stretched my toes to the end of the couch
'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all
alone
You do not cheat me of my childhood
You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
When you do the fantastic I am amazed
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so
alone?

You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone with
you
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?
Oh, why do I feel so alone?

That's the chain-store price. You can get them for cheaper on-line.
www.cdwow.co.uk sells cds for £9 for example. But yes, we are getting
ripped off and have done for years.

Iced Earth CD's are ridiculously priced here too mate, because it's metal,
the shops crank the prices up even more cos they know that metal fans are
true fans and will pay whatever to get something they want. BTW - got The

I know the feeling, when radio does play Metallica it is usually the same songs over and over. Still when I like a group, there is little that will stop me from disliking them. I even still like Gary Glitters music, even though he turned out to be a huge pervert. I don't listen to the radio that much. I have a hard time, with all the commercials, and then trying to find more than one good song played in a row. I don't think of Metallica as close to the greatest band on earth. They were good, but could never compare to Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Scorpions, or Helloween. So many much better than them. I even liked Megadeth better.

Nah, I wasn't much of a fan. Actually, I was, but damn radio beat it to death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations in town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of the three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they would play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no one plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one song every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice for a few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played in heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the new songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them. Most of the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in their Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me... *meh*. I still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time, but for the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become. Hell, just like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of the group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know I'd lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band ever and have grown tired of their music being played to death.

To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if people go
off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a fan in the
first place.

They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't all
have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the time.
The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go off
them. All the band were after was the money for what they had produced and
why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of working on a
specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for the entire
month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just give it for
nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the record, the
band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and recordings the
made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is wrong. Maybe in
your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album that for the
most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

I'm not much into Metallica anymore. Once I realized the kind of people
that listen to Metallica around here most likely drive a Bitchin' Camaro and
live in a double wide I sort of stopped liking them. They're just too
cliche anymore, plus the whole Napster thing really turned me off. It
didn't help that they haven't had a decent album since then either.

Alone
Tails ( http://www.absolutedivas.com/lisa/lyrics/index.php )
I want to be by myself, sometimes I do
I don't want to be left behind, but sometimes I'm left by you
I press my tongue to the top of my mouth
Cause my jaw, was tired from the thinking
And I stretched my toes to the end of the couch
'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
And why do I feel so alone?
And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
And why do I feel so alone?

And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all
alone
You do not cheat me of my childhood
You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
When you do the fantastic I am amazed
So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
And why do I feel so alone?
When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so
alone?

You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

I've not personally used cdwow.co.uk - is it a good site to use? In
terms of reliability, range of stock etc?

If I get anything online (and certain health/mobility issues mean I
tend to) I tend to get it from  http://www.play.com  They've never let

that aren't in the shop (though I dare say that can be said for most

Its pretty reliable. I've ordered about 30 cds off them and not really
hadhad any huge problems (they sometimes have a habit of telling you
something is out of stock, but back in stock 2 days. Then they send you
an email 2 days later saying, its still out of stock, but they'll get
some in in 2 days. etc. Its only happened a few times.) The best
thing about them is you know you're going to get it for a maximum of £9
inclusive (obviously a bit more for special editions and the like). I
got a link from dabs which give you a further 50p off as long as you go
through this link:  http://www5.cd-wow.com/?affid=15010  so you get them
for £8.50. And that's quite a bargain imo.

I've got dvds through play but a lot of their CD's are £10 after the new
release period and that's taking the piss a bit I think.

I've been getting quite a lot of stuff through Amazon's marketplace
buyers recently too because they're sometimes even cheaper. But most of
them ship from the US, so it takes longer, and you have p&amp;p on top.

To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if people
go
off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a fan in
the
first place.

They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't all
have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the
time.
The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go off
them. All the band were after was the money for what they had produced
and
why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of working
on a
specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for the
entire
month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just give it
for
nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the record,
the
band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and recordings
the
made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is wrong. Maybe
in
your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album that for
the
most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

Dear lord you are getting taken. That is awful. There are some here at that

I know that there's a chain of people who need to get paid before the
money gets to the artist(s), but I also firmly believe that if the
&quot;industry&quot; were to reduce the price of CDs etc in the shops, then far
less people would bother to download stuff, as, IMO, it's always
better to have the original, even if only for the booklets, lyrics
etc.

for the

cost of
&gt; getting their song out there. Also a lot of singers put they're new
stuff

I remember as a teen all my friends had all these pictures of Kiss, and Led Zepplin, and other male rocker stars on the wall. They thought I was strange because I had posters of the Runaways, and Suzie Quatro. Strange the way guys are about some of their favourite rock stars, and then they turn about and call others gay.

I know the feeling, when radio does play Metallica it is usually the same songs over and over. Still when I like a group, there is little that will stop me from disliking them. I even still like Gary Glitters music, even though he turned out to be a huge pervert. I don't listen to the radio that much. I have a hard time, with all the commercials, and then trying to find more than one good song played in a row. I don't think of Metallica as close to the greatest band on earth. They were good, but could never compare to Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Scorpions, or Helloween. So many much better than them. I even liked Megadeth better.

Nah, I wasn't much of a fan. Actually, I was, but damn radio beat it to death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations in town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of the three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they would play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no one plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one song every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice for a few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played in heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the new songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them. Most of the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in their Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me... *meh*. I still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time, but for the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become. Hell, just like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of the group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know I'd lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band ever and have grown tired of their music being played to death.

&gt; I've heard of Lisa Loeb Jeri, if it makes any difference to you
&gt; ;op.

&gt; I don't have any of her music, but she is listed on my Launchcast

&gt; Alone
&gt; Tails ( http://www.absolutedivas.com/lisa/lyrics/index.php )
&gt; I want to be by myself, sometimes I do
&gt; I don't want to be left behind, but sometimes I'm left by you
&gt; I press my tongue to the top of my mouth
&gt; Cause my jaw, was tired from the thinking
&gt; And I stretched my toes to the end of the couch
&gt; 'Cause my back, it was aching from sleeping
&gt; So what is this weather, and what is this darkness,
&gt; And why do I feel so alone?
&gt; And when will it snow, it's been raining for hours
&gt; And why do I feel so alone?

&gt; And when I'm left at home, when you're with someone else I'm all
&gt; alone
&gt; You do not cheat me of my childhood
&gt; You bring me blankets for the walls of my forts
&gt; There is no anger with the eyebrow raised
&gt; When you do the fantastic I am amazed
&gt; So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
&gt; And why do I feel so alone?
&gt; When will it snow, it's been raining for hours and why do I feel so
&gt; alone?

&gt; You were leaving some bar, and you're coming downtown
&gt; You're not ripping out stitches, but you want me around
&gt; Just to call you my love, just to call you my love
&gt; You are the treasure custodian cleaning the moon for me
&gt; Scouring the sky so the stars would shine bright
&gt; You stand straight-faced, and tip-toed on top of a ladder
&gt; And I, I wait and I, I wait, and I, I wait

&gt; And when I'm left at home, I'm all alone but I'd rather be alone

&gt; So what is this weather, and what is this darkness
&gt; And why do I feel so alone?

Think yourselves lucky mate. In the UK, you tend to have one or two local
radio station and then a few national stations. None of them play anything
like Metallica anymore. You tend to hear the Foo Fighters on national radio
every now and then, but they stopped being good after their 3rd album IMHO.

The last Metallica song I heard on national radio was Until It Sleeps. Not
their greatest song, but not their worst either. To hear 2 songs every
night, even the same ones, sounds great to me, and still would after 20
years. I might not like those songs so much, but I probably would. I have
been a huge Metallica fan for about 12 years now, and will be to my grave.

Some of the new stuff has been bloody good mate, some of it not so. I like
almost all of it, but that's because I have a very open mind, and wasn't
always into metal, therefore I don't have to hear them thrashing it out as
hard as they can, if I wanted that, i'd listen to Slayer (which I do as
well), but they are the cliche. Metallica are not cliche as I previously
said and explained. Metallica have reinvented themselves a number of times,
and they seem now to be happy with what they are putting out which you can
hear when you listen to them. One of my fave songs that Metallica have done
was the song they did with Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule, called We Did It Again.
It's a proper metal track with hip-hop beats and proper rapping over the
top. Just goes to show the do what they want, and that's all good.

You know me, i'm not the argumentative type, but i will argue if i feel
strongly about something.

Nah, I wasn't much of a fan. Actually, I was, but damn radio beat it to
death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations in
town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of the
three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they would
play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no one
plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one song
every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice for a
few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played in
heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the new
songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them. Most of
the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in their
Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me... *meh*. I
still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time, but for
the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become. Hell, just
like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of the
group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know I'd
lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band ever and
have grown tired of their music being played to death.

To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if people
go
off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a fan in
the
first place.

They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't all
have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the
time.
The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go off
them. All the band were after was the money for what they had produced
and
why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of working
on a
specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for the
entire
month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just give it
for
nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the record,
the
band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and recordings
the
made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is wrong. Maybe
in
your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album that for
the
most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

I know the feeling, when radio does play Metallica it is usually the same
songs over and over. Still when I like a group, there is little that will
stop me from disliking them. I even still like Gary Glitters music, even
though he turned out to be a huge pervert. I don't listen to the radio that
much. I have a hard time, with all the commercials, and then trying to find
more than one good song played in a row. I don't think of Metallica as close
to the greatest band on earth. They were good, but could never compare to
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Scorpions, or Helloween. So many much
better than them. I even liked Megadeth better.

I know that there's a chain of people who need to get paid before
the
money gets to the artist(s), but I also firmly believe that if the
&quot;industry&quot; were to reduce the price of CDs etc in the shops, then
far
less people would bother to download stuff, as, IMO, it's always
better to have the original, even if only for the booklets, lyrics
etc.

for the

&gt; To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if people

&gt;
&gt; They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't all
&gt; have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the

&gt; The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go off
&gt; them. All the band were after was the money for what they had produced

&gt; why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of working

&gt; the

The main thing I have about Metallica is they compromised on the singer. They admit as much. They said that all that they tried out just had too much of an ego, or drug problem or both. I saw them several times in concert even in a club. They are good, but not my favourite.

I know the feeling, when radio does play Metallica it is usually the same
songs over and over. Still when I like a group, there is little that will
stop me from disliking them. I even still like Gary Glitters music, even
though he turned out to be a huge pervert. I don't listen to the radio that
much. I have a hard time, with all the commercials, and then trying to find
more than one good song played in a row. I don't think of Metallica as close
to the greatest band on earth. They were good, but could never compare to
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Scorpions, or Helloween. So many much
better than them. I even liked Megadeth better.

Nah, I wasn't much of a fan. Actually, I was, but damn radio beat it to
death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations in
town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of the
three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they would
play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no one
plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one song
every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice for a
few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played in
heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the new
songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them. Most of
the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in their
Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me... *meh*. I
still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time, but for
the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become. Hell, just
like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of the
group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know I'd
lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band ever and
have grown tired of their music being played to death.

Ever since And Justice for All, ever album after I have heard that Metallica have sold out. Then those people go back and buy the album, and say the same thing about the next album. It was said that when Cliff died thatthat was the end of them. They just keep on going. I think the Napster thing hurt them with alot of the fans. I still like Master Of Puppets best of their stuff.

Think yourselves lucky mate. In the UK, you tend to have one or two local
radio station and then a few national stations. None of them play anything
like Metallica anymore. You tend to hear the Foo Fighters on national radio
every now and then, but they stopped being good after their 3rd album IMHO.

The last Metallica song I heard on national radio was Until It Sleeps. Not
their greatest song, but not their worst either. To hear 2 songs every
night, even the same ones, sounds great to me, and still would after 20
years. I might not like those songs so much, but I probably would. I have
been a huge Metallica fan for about 12 years now, and will be to my grave.

Some of the new stuff has been bloody good mate, some of it not so. I like
almost all of it, but that's because I have a very open mind, and wasn't
always into metal, therefore I don't have to hear them thrashing it out as
hard as they can, if I wanted that, i'd listen to Slayer (which I do as
well), but they are the cliche. Metallica are not cliche as I previously
said and explained. Metallica have reinvented themselves a number of times,
and they seem now to be happy with what they are putting out which you can
hear when you listen to them. One of my fave songs that Metallica have done
was the song they did with Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule, called We Did It Again.
It's a proper metal track with hip-hop beats and proper rapping over the
top. Just goes to show the do what they want, and that's all good.

You know me, i'm not the argumentative type, but i will argue if i feel
strongly about something.

&gt;&gt; To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if people
&gt;&gt; go
&gt;&gt; off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a fan in
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; first place.

&gt;&gt; They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't all
&gt;&gt; have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the
&gt;&gt; time.
&gt;&gt; The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go off
&gt;&gt; them. All the band were after was the money for what they had produced
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of working
&gt;&gt; on a
&gt;&gt; specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for the
&gt;&gt; entire
&gt;&gt; month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just give it
&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt; nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the record,
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and recordings
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

&gt;&gt; And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is wrong.
&gt; Maybe
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt; your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album that for
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

Any band that evolves will always be accused of selling out. I personally
think that RHCP have sold out, cos all of their songs on all of their albums
for the last few years sound the same. They found a formula and have stuck
to it. I like all of their albums, and all of them have some amazing tracks
on. Master was one that I bought about 10 years ago, but never really got
into until about 2 years ago. Now, Orion is one of my fave songs of all
time, and Battery? Fo'get about it!

I really don't think that true fans would intentionally try to steal from
them. I downloaded I Disappear from Napster which was one of the tracks that
people got stung for downloading, but if you look at my CD collection, i
bought it too. I actually own a copy of every CD Metallica have ever
released in the UK, and some imports too.

Ever since And Justice for All, ever album after I have heard that Metallica
have sold out. Then those people go back and buy the album, and say the same
thing about the next album. It was said that when Cliff died thatthat was
the end of them. They just keep on going. I think the Napster thing hurt
them with alot of the fans. I still like Master Of Puppets best of their
stuff.

Think yourselves lucky mate. In the UK, you tend to have one or two local
radio station and then a few national stations. None of them play
anything
like Metallica anymore. You tend to hear the Foo Fighters on national
radio
every now and then, but they stopped being good after their 3rd album
IMHO.

The last Metallica song I heard on national radio was Until It Sleeps.
Not
their greatest song, but not their worst either. To hear 2 songs every
night, even the same ones, sounds great to me, and still would after 20
years. I might not like those songs so much, but I probably would. I have
been a huge Metallica fan for about 12 years now, and will be to my
grave.

Some of the new stuff has been bloody good mate, some of it not so. I
like
almost all of it, but that's because I have a very open mind, and wasn't
always into metal, therefore I don't have to hear them thrashing it out
as
hard as they can, if I wanted that, i'd listen to Slayer (which I do as
well), but they are the cliche. Metallica are not cliche as I previously
said and explained. Metallica have reinvented themselves a number of
times,
and they seem now to be happy with what they are putting out which you
can
hear when you listen to them. One of my fave songs that Metallica have
done
was the song they did with Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule, called We Did It
Again.
It's a proper metal track with hip-hop beats and proper rapping over the
top. Just goes to show the do what they want, and that's all good.

You know me, i'm not the argumentative type, but i will argue if i feel
strongly about something.

Nah, I wasn't much of a fan. Actually, I was, but damn radio beat it to
death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations in
town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of the
three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they
would
play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no
one
plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one song
every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice for
a
few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played in
heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the
new
songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them. Most
of
the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in their
Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me... *meh*.
I
still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time, but
for
the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become. Hell,
just
like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of the
group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know I'd
lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band ever
and
have grown tired of their music being played to death.

I know that there's a chain of people who need to get paid before
the
money gets to the artist(s), but I also firmly believe that if the
&quot;industry&quot; were to reduce the price of CDs etc in the shops, then
far
less people would bother to download stuff, as, IMO, it's always
better to have the original, even if only for the booklets, lyrics

Sorry mate, i don't understand your point.

I do wonder how they'd have sounded as a 5 piece with John Bush on vocals
(Anthrax, ex-Armored Saint (they asked him but he turned them down)), Dave
Mustaine on guitar, Cliff on bass, Lars on drums and James on vocals/backing
vocals/guitar.

I always liked Jason Newsted and like Robert Trujillo now. I think that
Jason was more interesting/fun like Cliff, but Robert is more like Cliff
playing/sound wise.

The main thing I have about Metallica is they compromised on the singer.
They admit as much. They said that all that they tried out just had too much
of an ego, or drug problem or both. I saw them several times in concert even
in a club. They are good, but not my favourite.

I know the feeling, when radio does play Metallica it is usually the same
songs over and over. Still when I like a group, there is little that will
stop me from disliking them. I even still like Gary Glitters music, even
though he turned out to be a huge pervert. I don't listen to the radio
that
much. I have a hard time, with all the commercials, and then trying to
find
more than one good song played in a row. I don't think of Metallica as
close
to the greatest band on earth. They were good, but could never compare to
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Scorpions, or Helloween. So many much
better than them. I even liked Megadeth better.

Nah, I wasn't much of a fan. Actually, I was, but damn radio beat it
to
death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations in
town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of the
three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they
would
play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no
one
plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one song
every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice for
a
few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played in
heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the
new
songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them. Most
of
the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in their
Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me... *meh*.
I
still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time, but
for
the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become. Hell,
just
like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of the
group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know I'd
lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band ever
and
have grown tired of their music being played to death.

To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if
people go
off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a fan
in
the
first place.

They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't
all
have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the
time.
The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go
off
them. All the band were after was the money for what they had
produced
and
why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of
working
on a
specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for the
entire
month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just give
it
for
nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the
record,
the
band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and
recordings
the
made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is wrong.
Maybe in
your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album that
for
the
most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

Alot of people did not, and still do not see not paying for the music as stealing from them. They think they are stealing from the record company only.

Master of Puppets is the album that actually got me into them. Before that I had not really heard of them. Then I got the other albums, and have bought each one since, except St Anger. I heard it, and could not find a song I liked on it. I will still have a listen when their next one comes out.

Any band that evolves will always be accused of selling out. I personally
think that RHCP have sold out, cos all of their songs on all of their albums
for the last few years sound the same. They found a formula and have stuck
to it. I like all of their albums, and all of them have some amazing tracks
on. Master was one that I bought about 10 years ago, but never really got
into until about 2 years ago. Now, Orion is one of my fave songs of all
time, and Battery? Fo'get about it!

I really don't think that true fans would intentionally try to steal from
them. I downloaded I Disappear from Napster which was one of the tracks that
people got stung for downloading, but if you look at my CD collection, i
bought it too. I actually own a copy of every CD Metallica have ever
released in the UK, and some imports too.

Ever since And Justice for All, ever album after I have heard that Metallica
have sold out. Then those people go back and buy the album, and say the same
thing about the next album. It was said that when Cliff died thatthat was
the end of them. They just keep on going. I think the Napster thing hurt
them with alot of the fans. I still like Master Of Puppets best of their
stuff.

Think yourselves lucky mate. In the UK, you tend to have one or two local
radio station and then a few national stations. None of them play
anything
like Metallica anymore. You tend to hear the Foo Fighters on national
radio
every now and then, but they stopped being good after their 3rd album
IMHO.

The last Metallica song I heard on national radio was Until It Sleeps.
Not
their greatest song, but not their worst either. To hear 2 songs every
night, even the same ones, sounds great to me, and still would after 20
years. I might not like those songs so much, but I probably would. I have
been a huge Metallica fan for about 12 years now, and will be to my
grave.

Some of the new stuff has been bloody good mate, some of it not so. I
like
almost all of it, but that's because I have a very open mind, and wasn't
always into metal, therefore I don't have to hear them thrashing it out
as
hard as they can, if I wanted that, i'd listen to Slayer (which I do as
well), but they are the cliche. Metallica are not cliche as I previously
said and explained. Metallica have reinvented themselves a number of
times,
and they seem now to be happy with what they are putting out which you
can
hear when you listen to them. One of my fave songs that Metallica have
done
was the song they did with Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule, called We Did It
Again.
It's a proper metal track with hip-hop beats and proper rapping over the
top. Just goes to show the do what they want, and that's all good.

You know me, i'm not the argumentative type, but i will argue if i feel
strongly about something.

Nah, I wasn't much of a fan. Actually, I was, but damn radio beat it to
death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations in
town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of the
three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they
would
play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no
one
plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one song
every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice for
a
few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played in
heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the
new
songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them. Most
of
the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in their
Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me... *meh*.
I
still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time, but
for
the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become. Hell,
just
like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of the
group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know I'd
lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band ever
and
have grown tired of their music being played to death.

To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if
people
go
off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a fan
in
the
first place.

They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they don't
all
have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all the
time.
The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to go
off
them. All the band were after was the money for what they had produced
and
why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of
working
on a
specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for the
entire
month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just give
it
for
nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the record,
the
band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and recordings
the
made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is wrong.
Maybe
in
your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album that for
the
most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

Metal is famous for stuff that is tough to do. The vocals on Metallica are pretty easy. They do not require alot of range, or even power. There are alot of metal groups that have worse vocals.

I like all the bassists of Metallica myself. When someone dies everyone always says they cannot be replaced.

Sorry mate, i don't understand your point.

I do wonder how they'd have sounded as a 5 piece with John Bush on vocals
(Anthrax, ex-Armored Saint (they asked him but he turned them down)), Dave
Mustaine on guitar, Cliff on bass, Lars on drums and James on vocals/backing
vocals/guitar.

I always liked Jason Newsted and like Robert Trujillo now. I think that
Jason was more interesting/fun like Cliff, but Robert is more like Cliff
playing/sound wise.

The main thing I have about Metallica is they compromised on the singer.
They admit as much. They said that all that they tried out just had too much
of an ego, or drug problem or both. I saw them several times in concert even
in a club. They are good, but not my favourite.

I know the feeling, when radio does play Metallica it is usually the same
songs over and over. Still when I like a group, there is little that will
stop me from disliking them. I even still like Gary Glitters music, even
though he turned out to be a huge pervert. I don't listen to the radio
that
much. I have a hard time, with all the commercials, and then trying to
find
more than one good song played in a row. I don't think of Metallica as
close
to the greatest band on earth. They were good, but could never compare to
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Scorpions, or Helloween. So many much
better than them. I even liked Megadeth better.

I know, and that to mean seems ridiculous! The worst part is that some of
the people who think that are quite smart and not &quot;intellectually
challenged&quot; like most of the people who would come out with that drivel.

I actually first heard (and heard of) Metallica when I was on the French
Exchange programme with my school when I was 12. One kid asked the bus
driver if he could put his tape on and it was the Black album. When the riff
of Enter Sandman kicked in, i was hooked. When I got home 2 weeks later, I
turned on MTV and they were playing Wherever I May Roam and that same day I
went and bought that album. Initially, I didn't buy And Justice because the
video for One freaked me out (the full version with clips of Johnny Got His
Gun) and therefore never listened to the song, but now it's one of my faves.

I'm surprised that you don't like anything on St Anger if MOP is your fave
of their albums, as there are a lot of similarities between the two. The
only thing I hate about St Anger is the sound of the snare drum, which is
far to tinny sounding (best way I could describe it was &quot;like Danny
Schulers' snare from the first Biohazard album&quot;). Personally, I really like
St Anger, but to each their own.

Are you a Slipknot fan, or am I trying to put 2 and 2 together and getting
the wrong answer from your name?

Alot of people did not, and still do not see not paying for the music as
stealing from them. They think they are stealing from the record company
only.

Master of Puppets is the album that actually got me into them. Before that I
had not really heard of them. Then I got the other albums, and have bought
each one since, except St Anger. I heard it, and could not find a song I
liked on it. I will still have a listen when their next one comes out.

Any band that evolves will always be accused of selling out. I personally
think that RHCP have sold out, cos all of their songs on all of their
albums
for the last few years sound the same. They found a formula and have
stuck
to it. I like all of their albums, and all of them have some amazing
tracks
on. Master was one that I bought about 10 years ago, but never really got
into until about 2 years ago. Now, Orion is one of my fave songs of all
time, and Battery? Fo'get about it!

I really don't think that true fans would intentionally try to steal from
them. I downloaded I Disappear from Napster which was one of the tracks
that
people got stung for downloading, but if you look at my CD collection, i
bought it too. I actually own a copy of every CD Metallica have ever
released in the UK, and some imports too.

Ok, gotcha mate. I personally like James' vocals, as he has a distinctive
sound, but yes, he doesn't push himself. Perhaps that's as much to do with
the fact he wasn't going to be the vocalist as anything. I'd rather listen

I know the feeling, when radio does play Metallica it is usually the
same
songs over and over. Still when I like a group, there is little that
will
stop me from disliking them. I even still like Gary Glitters music,
even
though he turned out to be a huge pervert. I don't listen to the radio
that
much. I have a hard time, with all the commercials, and then trying to
find
more than one good song played in a row. I don't think of Metallica as
close
to the greatest band on earth. They were good, but could never compare
to
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Scorpions, or Helloween. So many
much
better than them. I even liked Megadeth better.

Nah, I wasn't much of a fan. Actually, I was, but damn radio beat
it
to
death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations
in
town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of
the
three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they
would
play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no
one
plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one
song
every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice
for
a
few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played
in
heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the
new
songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them.
Most
of
the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in
their
Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me...
*meh*.
I
still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time,
but
for
the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become.
Hell,
just
like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of
the
group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know
I'd
lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band
ever
and
have grown tired of their music being played to death.

I know, and that to mean seems ridiculous! The worst part is that some of
the people who think that are quite smart and not &quot;intellectually

I actually first heard (and heard of) Metallica when I was on the French
Exchange programme with my school when I was 12. One kid asked the bus
driver if he could put his tape on and it was the Black album. When the riff
of Enter Sandman kicked in, i was hooked. When I got home 2 weeks later, I
turned on MTV and they were playing Wherever I May Roam and that same day I
went and bought that album. Initially, I didn't buy And Justice because the
video for One freaked me out (the full version with clips of Johnny Got His
Gun) and therefore never listened to the song, but now it's one of my faves.

I'm surprised that you don't like anything on St Anger if MOP is your fave
of their albums, as there are a lot of similarities between the two. The
only thing I hate about St Anger is the sound of the snare drum, which is
far to tinny sounding (best way I could describe it was &quot;like Danny
Schulers' snare from the first Biohazard album&quot;). Personally, I really like
St Anger, but to each their own.

Are you a Slipknot fan, or am I trying to put 2 and 2 together and getting

Alot of people did not, and still do not see not paying for the music as
stealing from them. They think they are stealing from the record company
only.

Master of Puppets is the album that actually got me into them. Before that I
had not really heard of them. Then I got the other albums, and have bought
each one since, except St Anger. I heard it, and could not find a song I
liked on it. I will still have a listen when their next one comes out.

Any band that evolves will always be accused of selling out. I personally
think that RHCP have sold out, cos all of their songs on all of their
albums
for the last few years sound the same. They found a formula and have
stuck
to it. I like all of their albums, and all of them have some amazing
tracks
on. Master was one that I bought about 10 years ago, but never really got
into until about 2 years ago. Now, Orion is one of my fave songs of all
time, and Battery? Fo'get about it!

I really don't think that true fans would intentionally try to steal from

that
people got stung for downloading, but if you look at my CD collection, i
bought it too. I actually own a copy of every CD Metallica have ever

Think yourselves lucky mate. In the UK, you tend to have one or two
local
radio station and then a few national stations. None of them play
anything
like Metallica anymore. You tend to hear the Foo Fighters on national
radio
every now and then, but they stopped being good after their 3rd album
IMHO.

The last Metallica song I heard on national radio was Until It Sleeps.
Not
their greatest song, but not their worst either. To hear 2 songs every
night, even the same ones, sounds great to me, and still would after
20
years. I might not like those songs so much, but I probably would. I
have
been a huge Metallica fan for about 12 years now, and will be to my
grave.

Some of the new stuff has been bloody good mate, some of it not so. I
like
almost all of it, but that's because I have a very open mind, and
wasn't
always into metal, therefore I don't have to hear them thrashing it
out
as
hard as they can, if I wanted that, i'd listen to Slayer (which I do
as
well), but they are the cliche. Metallica are not cliche as I
previously
said and explained. Metallica have reinvented themselves a number of
times,
and they seem now to be happy with what they are putting out which you
can
hear when you listen to them. One of my fave songs that Metallica have
done
was the song they did with Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule, called We Did It
Again.
It's a proper metal track with hip-hop beats and proper rapping over
the
top. Just goes to show the do what they want, and that's all good.

You know me, i'm not the argumentative type, but i will argue if i
feel
strongly about something.

Ok, gotcha mate. I personally like James' vocals, as he has a distinctive

Metal is famous for stuff that is tough to do. The vocals on Metallica are
pretty easy. They do not require alot of range, or even power. There are
alot of metal groups that have worse vocals.

I like all the bassists of Metallica myself. When someone dies everyone
always says they cannot be replaced.

Sorry mate, i don't understand your point.

I do wonder how they'd have sounded as a 5 piece with John Bush on vocals
(Anthrax, ex-Armored Saint (they asked him but he turned them down)),
Dave
Mustaine on guitar, Cliff on bass, Lars on drums and James on
vocals/backing
vocals/guitar.

I always liked Jason Newsted and like Robert Trujillo now. I think that
Jason was more interesting/fun like Cliff, but Robert is more like Cliff
playing/sound wise.

The main thing I have about Metallica is they compromised on the singer.
They admit as much. They said that all that they tried out just had too
much
of an ego, or drug problem or both. I saw them several times in concert
even
in a club. They are good, but not my favourite.

So where does you're ;) name come from then?

The only song I can see that with is St Anger itself, and i think the single
version should have been the version on the album, as the single was about
half the length, much tighter and stronger and didn't get too repetitive
(not for me anyway).

But as we keep saying, it would be boring if everybody loved the same
things.

Thank god someone feels the same way as I do. Nirvana were good, but not
great. They wrote a few decent songs, but they seemed to try to sound raw. I
was more into the scene than the music. There were far better bands around
from that area at that time, AIC and Soundgarden to name a few. And of
course, Metallica...

Cobain never showed much vocally. I did like their sound, but I thought them
over hyped. I found the whole grunge thing bland.

Ok, gotcha mate. I personally like James' vocals, as he has a distinctive
sound, but yes, he doesn't push himself. Perhaps that's as much to do
with
the fact he wasn't going to be the vocalist as anything. I'd rather
listen
to him than Cobain anyday, yet some people think he was great!

Metal is famous for stuff that is tough to do. The vocals on Metallica
are
pretty easy. They do not require alot of range, or even power. There are
alot of metal groups that have worse vocals.

I like all the bassists of Metallica myself. When someone dies everyone
always says they cannot be replaced.

Sorry mate, i don't understand your point.

I do wonder how they'd have sounded as a 5 piece with John Bush on
vocals
(Anthrax, ex-Armored Saint (they asked him but he turned them down)),
Dave
Mustaine on guitar, Cliff on bass, Lars on drums and James on
vocals/backing
vocals/guitar.

I always liked Jason Newsted and like Robert Trujillo now. I think
that
Jason was more interesting/fun like Cliff, but Robert is more like
Cliff
playing/sound wise.

The main thing I have about Metallica is they compromised on the
singer.
They admit as much. They said that all that they tried out just had
too
much
of an ego, or drug problem or both. I saw them several times in
concert
even
in a club. They are good, but not my favourite.

I know the feeling, when radio does play Metallica it is usually
the
same
songs over and over. Still when I like a group, there is little
that
will
stop me from disliking them. I even still like Gary Glitters music,
even
though he turned out to be a huge pervert. I don't listen to the
radio
that
much. I have a hard time, with all the commercials, and then trying
to
find
more than one good song played in a row. I don't think of Metallica
as
close
to the greatest band on earth. They were good, but could never
compare
to
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Scorpions, or Helloween. So many
much
better than them. I even liked Megadeth better.

&quot;no

song
every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was

I worked at a recycling plant, and when the waste got stuck I ended up being the one to climb in and get it out. It would plug things up pretty bad at times, and I then started calling it a wasteknot. I liked it and thought it a good name for the net. It could mean alot of things. So where did you come up with Martin Lyel?

So where does you're ;) name come from then?

The only song I can see that with is St Anger itself, and i think the single
version should have been the version on the album, as the single was about
half the length, much tighter and stronger and didn't get too repetitive
(not for me anyway).

But as we keep saying, it would be boring if everybody loved the same

I know, and that to mean seems ridiculous! The worst part is that some of
the people who think that are quite smart and not &quot;intellectually
challenged&quot; like most of the people who would come out with that drivel.

I actually first heard (and heard of) Metallica when I was on the French
Exchange programme with my school when I was 12. One kid asked the bus
driver if he could put his tape on and it was the Black album. When the
riff
of Enter Sandman kicked in, i was hooked. When I got home 2 weeks later,
I
turned on MTV and they were playing Wherever I May Roam and that same day
I
went and bought that album. Initially, I didn't buy And Justice because
the
video for One freaked me out (the full version with clips of Johnny Got
His
Gun) and therefore never listened to the song, but now it's one of my
faves.

I'm surprised that you don't like anything on St Anger if MOP is your
fave
of their albums, as there are a lot of similarities between the two. The
only thing I hate about St Anger is the sound of the snare drum, which is
far to tinny sounding (best way I could describe it was &quot;like Danny
Schulers' snare from the first Biohazard album&quot;). Personally, I really
like
St Anger, but to each their own.

Are you a Slipknot fan, or am I trying to put 2 and 2 together and
getting
the wrong answer from your name?

Alot of people did not, and still do not see not paying for the music as
stealing from them. They think they are stealing from the record company
only.

Master of Puppets is the album that actually got me into them. Before
that I
had not really heard of them. Then I got the other albums, and have
bought
each one since, except St Anger. I heard it, and could not find a song I
liked on it. I will still have a listen when their next one comes out.

Any band that evolves will always be accused of selling out. I
personally
think that RHCP have sold out, cos all of their songs on all of their
albums
for the last few years sound the same. They found a formula and have
stuck
to it. I like all of their albums, and all of them have some amazing
tracks
on. Master was one that I bought about 10 years ago, but never really
got
into until about 2 years ago. Now, Orion is one of my fave songs of
all
time, and Battery? Fo'get about it!

I really don't think that true fans would intentionally try to steal
from
them. I downloaded I Disappear from Napster which was one of the
tracks
that
people got stung for downloading, but if you look at my CD collection,
i
bought it too. I actually own a copy of every CD Metallica have ever
released in the UK, and some imports too.

Think yourselves lucky mate. In the UK, you tend to have one or two
local
radio station and then a few national stations. None of them play
anything
like Metallica anymore. You tend to hear the Foo Fighters on
national
radio
every now and then, but they stopped being good after their 3rd
album
IMHO.

The last Metallica song I heard on national radio was Until It
Sleeps.
Not
their greatest song, but not their worst either. To hear 2 songs
every
night, even the same ones, sounds great to me, and still would
after
20
years. I might not like those songs so much, but I probably would.

have

was the song they did with Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule, called We Did
It
Again.
It's a proper metal track with hip-hop beats and proper rapping
over
the
top. Just goes to show the do what they want, and that's all good.

You know me, i'm not the argumentative type, but i will argue if i
feel
strongly about something.

Any band that evolves will always be accused of selling out. I
personally
think that RHCP have sold out, cos all of their songs on all of
their
albums
for the last few years sound the same. They found a formula and
have
stuck
to it. I like all of their albums, and all of them have some
amazing
tracks
on. Master was one that I bought about 10 years ago, but never
really
got
into until about 2 years ago. Now, Orion is one of my fave songs of
all
time, and Battery? Fo'get about it!

I really don't think that true fans would intentionally try to
steal
from
them. I downloaded I Disappear from Napster which was one of the
tracks
that
people got stung for downloading, but if you look at my CD
collection,
i
bought it too. I actually own a copy of every CD Metallica have
ever
released in the UK, and some imports too.

Ever since And Justice for All, ever album after I have heard that
Metallica
have sold out. Then those people go back and buy the album, and say
the
same
thing about the next album. It was said that when Cliff died
thatthat
was
the end of them. They just keep on going. I think the Napster thing
hurt
them with alot of the fans. I still like Master Of Puppets best of
their
stuff.

Think yourselves lucky mate. In the UK, you tend to have one or
two
local
radio station and then a few national stations. None of them
play
anything
like Metallica anymore. You tend to hear the Foo Fighters on
national
radio
every now and then, but they stopped being good after their 3rd
album
IMHO.

The last Metallica song I heard on national radio was Until It
Sleeps.
Not
their greatest song, but not their worst either. To hear 2 songs
every
night, even the same ones, sounds great to me, and still would
after
20
years. I might not like those songs so much, but I probably
would.
I
have
been a huge Metallica fan for about 12 years now, and will be to
my
grave.

Some of the new stuff has been bloody good mate, some of it not
so.
I
like
almost all of it, but that's because I have a very open mind,
and
wasn't
always into metal, therefore I don't have to hear them thrashing
it
out
as
hard as they can, if I wanted that, i'd listen to Slayer (which
I
do
as
well), but they are the cliche. Metallica are not cliche as I
previously
said and explained. Metallica have reinvented themselves a
number
of
times,
and they seem now to be happy with what they are putting out
which
you
can
hear when you listen to them. One of my fave songs that
Metallica
have
done
was the song they did with Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule, called We
Did
It
Again.
It's a proper metal track with hip-hop beats and proper rapping
over
the
top. Just goes to show the do what they want, and that's all
good.

You know me, i'm not the argumentative type, but i will argue if
i
feel
strongly about something.

Ok, gotcha mate. I personally like James' vocals, as he has a distinctive
sound, but yes, he doesn't push himself. Perhaps that's as much to do with
the fact he wasn't going to be the vocalist as anything. I'd rather listen
to him than Cobain anyday, yet some people think he was great!

Metal is famous for stuff that is tough to do. The vocals on Metallica are
pretty easy. They do not require alot of range, or even power. There are
alot of metal groups that have worse vocals.

I like all the bassists of Metallica myself. When someone dies everyone
always says they cannot be replaced.

Sorry mate, i don't understand your point.

I do wonder how they'd have sounded as a 5 piece with John Bush on vocals
(Anthrax, ex-Armored Saint (they asked him but he turned them down)),
Dave
Mustaine on guitar, Cliff on bass, Lars on drums and James on
vocals/backing
vocals/guitar.

I always liked Jason Newsted and like Robert Trujillo now. I think that
Jason was more interesting/fun like Cliff, but Robert is more like Cliff
playing/sound wise.

The main thing I have about Metallica is they compromised on the singer.
They admit as much. They said that all that they tried out just had too
much
of an ego, or drug problem or both. I saw them several times in concert
even
in a club. They are good, but not my favourite.

I know the feeling, when radio does play Metallica it is usually the
same
songs over and over. Still when I like a group, there is little that
will
stop me from disliking them. I even still like Gary Glitters music,
even
though he turned out to be a huge pervert. I don't listen to the radio
that
much. I have a hard time, with all the commercials, and then trying to
find
more than one good song played in a row. I don't think of Metallica as
close
to the greatest band on earth. They were good, but could never compare
to
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Scorpions, or Helloween. So many
much
better than them. I even liked Megadeth better.

it
to
death and now I'm sick of it. There were basically two rock stations
in
town and one classic rock station when I was in high school. Two of
the
three played Metallica at a certain hour of the day (ie: 10:00pm they
would
play 2 songs back to back every night). The other station claimed &quot;no
one
plays more Metallica than we do&quot; and they were right. At least one
song
every two hours. That may sound all good and great, and it was nice
for
a
few years. After 7 years of hearing the same damn songs still played
in
heavy rotation I have to be honest I got tired of it all. None of the
new
songs have been any good, so the radio stations rarely play them.
Most
of
the people I know grew tired of it too, except for the rednecks in
their
Camaros who still think Metallica &quot;RAWKS THE SHIT&quot;. As for me...
*meh*.
I
still like the odd song on the radio I haven't heard in a long time,
but
for
the most part I'm just tired of the giant cliche they've become.
Hell,
just
like all music this is just an opinion and probably one that a lot of
the
group doesn't agree with. I'm not trying to convince anybody, I know
I'd
lose that. I just personally don't think they're the greatest band
ever
and
have grown tired of their music being played to death.

To be honest mate, and please don't take too much offence, but if
people go
off the music because of how other fans look, then you were'nt a
fan
in
the
first place.

They are not bloody cliche, they don't always wear black, they
don't
all
have long hair, they don't play as fast and loud as they can all
the
time.
The napster thing is also another (i'm sorry!) pathetic reason to
go
off
them. All the band were after was the money for what they had
produced
and
why shouldn't they. It's like telling you that after a month of
working
on a
specific project that has kept you busy for 15+ hours a day for
the
entire
month, that then you shouldn't get paid for it, you should just
give
it
for
nothing. There's nothing wrong with what they did. And for the
record,
the
band have always encouraged fans to trade in live shows and
recordings
the
made themselves, just not the stuff that is officially released.

And to say that they've not had a decent album since then is
wrong.
Maybe in
your opinion, but they have had a multi-million selling album
that
for
the
most part people thought was amazing. It's all a matter of taste.

The only song I can see that with is St Anger itself, and i think the

version should have been the version on the album, as the single was
about
half the length, much tighter and stronger and didn't get too repetitive
(not for me anyway).

But as we keep saying, it would be boring if everybody loved the same

I know, and that to mean seems ridiculous! The worst part is that some
of
the people who think that are quite smart and not &quot;intellectually
challenged&quot; like most of the people who would come out with that
drivel.

I actually first heard (and heard of) Metallica when I was on the
French
Exchange programme with my school when I was 12. One kid asked the bus
driver if he could put his tape on and it was the Black album. When
the
riff
of Enter Sandman kicked in, i was hooked. When I got home 2 weeks
later,
I
turned on MTV and they were playing Wherever I May Roam and that same
day
I
went and bought that album. Initially, I didn't buy And Justice
because
the
video for One freaked me out (the full version with clips of Johnny
Got
His
Gun) and therefore never listened to the song, but now it's one of my
faves.

I'm surprised that you don't like anything on St Anger if MOP is your
fave
of their albums, as there are a lot of similarities between the two.
The
only thing I hate about St Anger is the sound of the snare drum, which
is
far to tinny sounding (best way I could describe it was &quot;like Danny
Schulers' snare from the first Biohazard album&quot;). Personally, I really
like
St Anger, but to each their own.

Are you a Slipknot fan, or am I trying to put 2 and 2 together and
getting
the wrong answer from your name?

Alot of people did not, and still do not see not paying for the music
as
stealing from them. They think they are stealing from the record
company
only.

Master of Puppets is the album that actually got me into them. Before
that I
had not really heard of them. Then I got the other albums, and have
bought
each one since, except St Anger. I heard it, and could not find a song
I
liked on it. I will still have a listen when their next one comes out.

Any band that evolves will always be accused of selling out. I
personally
think that RHCP have sold out, cos all of their songs on all of
their
albums
for the last few years sound the same. They found a formula and
have
stuck
to it. I like all of their albums, and all of them have some
amazing
tracks
on. Master was one that I bought about 10 years ago, but never
really
got
into until about 2 years ago. Now, Orion is one of my fave songs of
all
time, and Battery? Fo'get about it!

I really don't think that true fans would intentionally try to
steal
from
them. I downloaded I Disappear from Napster which was one of the
tracks
that
people got stung for downloading, but if you look at my CD
collection,
i
bought it too. I actually own a copy of every CD Metallica have
ever
released in the UK, and some imports too.

Ever since And Justice for All, ever album after I have heard that
Metallica
have sold out. Then those people go back and buy the album, and say
the
same
thing about the next album. It was said that when Cliff died
thatthat
was

hurt
them with alot of the fans. I still like Master Of Puppets best of

Think yourselves lucky mate. In the UK, you tend to have one or
two
local
radio station and then a few national stations. None of them
play
anything
like Metallica anymore. You tend to hear the Foo Fighters on
national
radio
every now and then, but they stopped being good after their 3rd
album
IMHO.

The last Metallica song I heard on national radio was Until It
Sleeps.
Not
their greatest song, but not their worst either. To hear 2 songs
every
night, even the same ones, sounds great to me, and still would
after
20
years. I might not like those songs so much, but I probably
would.
I
have
been a huge Metallica fan for about 12 years now, and will be to
my
grave.

Some of the new stuff has been bloody good mate, some of it not
so.
I
like
almost all of it, but that's because I have a very open mind,
and
wasn't
always into metal, therefore I don't have to hear them thrashing
it
out
as
hard as they can, if I wanted that, i'd listen to Slayer (which
I
do
as
well), but they are the cliche. Metallica are not cliche as I
previously
said and explained. Metallica have reinvented themselves a
number
of
times,
and they seem now to be happy with what they are putting out
which
you
can
hear when you listen to them. One of my fave songs that
Metallica
have
done
was the song they did with Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule, called We
Did
It
Again.
It's a proper metal track with hip-hop beats and proper rapping
over
the
top. Just goes to show the do what they want, and that's all
good.

You know me, i'm not the argumentative type, but i will argue if

I worked at a recycling plant, and when the waste got stuck I ended up being
the one to climb in and get it out. It would plug things up pretty bad at
times, and I then started calling it a wasteknot. I liked it and thought it
a good name for the net. It could mean alot of things. So where did you come

So where does you're ;) name come from then?

The only song I can see that with is St Anger itself, and i think the
single
version should have been the version on the album, as the single was
about
half the length, much tighter and stronger and didn't get too repetitive
(not for me anyway).

But as we keep saying, it would be boring if everybody loved the same
things.

The cost for a song online (e.g., ITunes), I believe, is $.99. If you think of it, no bargain over buying a cd at the store.

It use to cost about 10 dollars Canadian for a LP, now it is about 16 dollars for a CD. You can get them second hand for about 10 bucks here. I don't see it as that bad. If you have to specially order them then they cost more. You can always join the CD clubs like columbia house, but I personally don't like them. I understand there are places on the net, where you can buy the downloads, and the artists get paid. I don't know the cost of these.

I know that there's a chain of people who need to get paid before the
money gets to the artist(s), but I also firmly believe that if the
&quot;industry&quot; were to reduce the price of CDs etc in the shops, then far
less people would bother to download stuff, as, IMO, it's always
better to have the original, even if only for the booklets, lyrics
etc.

&gt; However, the whole download thing has evolved now. Now it's a way for the

&gt; getting their song out there. Also a lot of singers put they're new stuff

&gt;
&gt; I'm surprised that you don't like anything on St Anger if MOP
&gt; is your
&gt; fave
&gt; of their albums, as there are a lot of similarities between
&gt; the two.
&gt; The
&gt; only thing I hate about St Anger is the sound of the snare
&gt; drum, which
&gt; is
&gt; far to tinny sounding (best way I could describe it was &quot;like
&gt; Danny
&gt; Schulers' snare from the first Biohazard album&quot;). Personally,
&gt; I really
&gt; like
&gt; St Anger, but to each their own.

&gt; Are you a Slipknot fan, or am I trying to put 2 and 2 together and
&gt; getting
&gt; the wrong answer from your name?

iTunes uses mp3 mate. at least, the UK version does. Unfortunately it's only
128kbps versions which are generally not the virtual plastic they're printed
on!

Unless you don't want the whole CD. I won't buy songs from Napster or
iTunes until they stop using WMV files with DRMs encoded.

The cost for a song online (e.g., ITunes), I believe, is $.99. If you
think of it, no bargain over buying a cd at the store.

I know that there's a chain of people who need to get paid before the
money gets to the artist(s), but I also firmly believe that if the
&quot;industry&quot; were to reduce the price of CDs etc in the shops, then far
less people would bother to download stuff, as, IMO, it's always
better to have the original, even if only for the booklets, lyrics
etc.

Correct. That is why I still buy most, if not all, of my music at the record store. I too want to hear the rest of the band's music if I am interested as opposed to the one and done.

I agree. I hear the same the from the youth about hip hop. They say that it's all controlled now by big cooperations. Like Rock and Roll now, it's only job now is to make a buck. It's Not the music of the people any more.

I think the free downloading sent a message, and has helped keep the prices down abit. Still it is all huge companies running it all now, and they have bloated bureaucracies to support. They killed the independents, and control the air play. They even learned to control the area of angry music that once propelled the rebellious youth. They fill it with crap, and turn the youthful anger inward instead of out at the establishment where it should be. Music is becoming more a dull background music instead of the voice of the youth.

IMO...something should have happened to change the music industry. CD's were becoming too expensive for one maybe too two songs.

Alot of groups put out teasers, and some sell complete downloads of a CD off of their sites. Lots offer up videos, and they know full well that once they are out there they have no control over them. One of the big things is why should someone else be able to profit from someone elses hard work and intellectual property when all the did is slap up a web site. I have no problem with fans swaping stuff, but when it is someone making millions off of other peoples stuff. There has always been bootleged stuff, but Napster took it to a new high or low. I know it pissed off alot of people who liked getting free music. It seems to have changed the music business greatly already. I do not see people living so much for the music, or caring for it the way we did in the 70's and 80's. It just seems to them to be more of a background noise.

There are more and more CD's with various types of coping protection. I am not sure how good these are.

We may not like the system, but it's one of those things that will not be stopped now. It's here and it's not going anywhere. Who knows what it will eventually evolve into, but it's not going anywhere.

There are some people out there that have been discovered because of it. they're names escapes me now, but they are names that we all know now.

I did not like their last album. Personally liked the crowd that listened to Metallica. Not one of us owned a Camaro. I also did not like Napster much. The idea of getting music for free is kind of stupid. It makes music too disposable, and people don't tend to appreciate it much. It also showed when The Offspring offered some stuff with the Napster logo on it, and Napster was so quick to get the courts to make them stop, while people could download The Offspring stuff off of their site for free. That seemed to turn alot of people off of Metallica. Seems to happen when groups stand up for something.

I'm not much into Metallica anymore. Once I realized the kind of people that listen to Metallica around here most likely drive a Bitchin' Camaro and live in a double wide I sort of stopped liking them. They're just too cliche anymore, plus the whole Napster thing really turned me off. It didn't help that they haven't had a decent album since then either.

During that time was when I got heavily (excuse the pun) into Metallica, and
that has continued since. 1995 i was a 4th year at high school and 1997 i
