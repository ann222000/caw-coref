Hello,

I'm doing some voice production work at home for a local radio station.
Using Cool Edit along with M Audio's Mobile-Pre, a Pentium 3 computer, a
Shure PG-58 mic, Windows XP.

When everything is powered up and the mic is on, I'm showing a -54 dB
reading on my Cool Edit screen. I think that that is too noisy.  Obviously,
I can  just about eliminate any of  this noise (hiss or system noise) by
using Cool Edit's Noise Reduction software after I have recorded, but no
matter what percentage of  reduction I use, I will hear some artifacts.

On the Mobile Pre, the gain control is set at about 4 o'clock, six is about
maximum. The recorded wave form is showing peaks at about 30%. I then must
&quot;normalize&quot; the recording to 95-100% for the final recording. It seems that
I should be getting more mic gain from the pre-amp( or the computer?), so
that I don't need to set the output gain to 4 o'clock and then normalize in
Cool Edit. I must use about a 12 foot USB cable to connect the pre-amp to
the computer, but I don't think that this is much of a factor.

I would appreciate any thoughts you might have.

If I wanted to improve the sound quality, without spending a lot, what areas
do you think I could improve? THANKS.

Thank you,
Bob K at gateway4 ... @hotmail.com.

First off, what *is* the noise? Is it hiss generated in the Mobile-Pre, or
is it room noise? The amount of mic gain you're needing to use seems
reasonable for a relatively insensitive mic, a speaking voice and someone
with good mic technique (6-12&quot; from the microphone). The preamp, like many
modern ones, seems designed for louder noises, like loud guitars, stuff
close-miked with condenser mics, and people kissing the microphone while
they sing loud.

Suggestion -- you're using CoolEdit, which has a frequency-analyzer
function. Record 10sec. of the noise at 24bit resolution. Bring the
frequency analyzer up, set it to 65xxx, and do a screen grab. Post it
someplace where we can look at it.

-54 dB is relative to the dynamic range. After normalizing to 0 dB after
recording, what is the noise floor at?

You can't get away from normalization. You never want to risk clipping a
digital input, especially during recording. Thus, you're going to have to
set the input level low enough so that you know it will never clip.

Use a small amount of NR, and then use Dynamic Processing to expand.

Thanks Paul,

I recorded 10 seconds of noise. The noise level recorded showed as -45
to -50 dB.
I'm not too technical but here is what I know. The recording was made at a
sample rate of 44,100, mono, 32 bit float, FFT size of 2048,
Blackmann-Harris. With frequency analysis of the waveform, placing my cursor
over the form every quarter inch or so, Cool Edit showed an overall
frequency range of between 17 to 81 Hz.  In MOST random samples the
frequency was clearly in the 50s range.

I don't how to describe it. It is not a hum.  I would call it a very low
level static as if you had an AM radio on that was deliberately tuned to
quiet spot on the dial. As I said, the &quot;average&quot; frequency range is 50 to 60
HZ. It is not 60 cycle hum.

I recorded 10 seconds of noise only. If I'm understanding this correctly, I
normalized this noise only recording in Cool Edit by normalizing to 0 dB
with the Decibel format. I now listen to the new waveform and it is showing
showing a static peak at about -1 or -2 dB.

I take a voice recording which probably showed a noise level of -54 dB when
all was quiet with just the mic just turned on. I then normalize the voice
recording to 0dB with the decibel format and I now see the the quiet area,
just after I stop the voice portion is now reading abou -47 dB.

How much Noise Reduction would you use? What percentage? I've never used
Dynamic Processing. Any basic suggestions on that?  THANKS.

Ok, well I suppose you could filter it with a high=pass filter.

It's unusual though. I'm sure it shouldn't be there.

First, record at a higher sample rate, if you can. 48k or 96k.

After normalizing, do a 1st order High Pass at 400 Hz. Then, do a 4th order
High Pass at 150 Hz. That will roll the bass off, and bring the noise floor
down. It'll thin a male voice out, but not unresaonably so, in my opinion.
Not for your application, anyways.

Then, do a small amount of NR, using a sample from a quiet passage.

You can try this... It's what I've been using on our 48k recordings in a
similar situation:

FFT Size: 4096
Snapshots in Profile: 4000
NR Level: 100
Reduce by: 15
Precision Factor: 7
Smoothing Amount: 2
Transition Width: 15
Spectral Decay Rate: 65%

After that... Mess around with the compression/limiter/gate/expander
(dynamics processing). Can't give you much guidance here... Too many
variables. Suffice to say, though... Whatever your noise floor is at, you
can start the rolloff slightly before that.

Use the presets as a starting point, and experiment tweaking them.

After you've done that, normalize again. Then downsample to 44.1k @ 16-bit.

Which model of the PG58 are you using? Does the cable end that plugs
into the Mobile-Pre have an XLR or a 1/4&quot; phone plug?

The box just says PG58 vocal microphone. I just bought it new a month ago.
It connects to the back of the Mobile-Pre with a XLR connector.

I have the gain almost to full. I have it at 4 o'clock, full would be about
six. The noise that I'm hearing sounds like a low level static or line
noise. It seems that if I had more gain from the mic then the background
noise would be proportionally reduced. Does that make sense?

Would a condenser mic powered by the Mobile-Pre phantom power be a stronger
signal with less noise?

I can hear the noise through the Mobile-Pre jack with only the USB cable
connected to the PC. Am I getting some feedback or system noise from the PC?

I bought the Mobile-Pre because I thought that it would be sending a digital
signal to the PC, bypassing the PC sound card and would make a cleaner
recording.

Try again with 65536 like Paul suggested - instead of 2048. That will give
you a better resolution in the lower frequencies.

Looks to me like you can pretty much just chop off everything below 60Hz
without noticing it, and you might even be able to get away with 80Hz this
should get rid of your entire problem, but obviously rolling it off is a
better solution (based on looking at the response graph for the PG-58,
http://www.shure.com/stellent/groups/public/@gms_gmi_web_us/documents... ).
It does look to me though that you won't be able to record at above 44.1 by
too much, so the oversampling solution won't work it will only introduce
artifacts for no gain. Just a thought, do you have phantom power turned on?
I dont' see phantom mentioned in the Mobile-Pre specs, but if it is there,
turn it off.

Bill, I ran across something a bit like that once. I had what looked
like a low frequency noise at a very low level. Then I normalized the
noise sample and saw something very different. I saw a peak at the low
frequency, dropping about 6 dB per octave through the entire audible
spectrum.

This is normal thermal noise, but only the low frequencies were visible
at first because they have the highest amplitude. The higher frequencies
fell off the bottom of the chart until I added some gain. I suspect you
are seeing a peak between 17 and 81 Hz because of some attenuation of
the lower frequencies, either due to a filter or just the limitations of
the analog device. The only way to be sure is to normalize your noise
sample and take another look.

I have a MobilePre. It's on more or less permanent loan, or I would have it
out now. I asked about the mike, in case you were inadvertently connecting
the mike to the instrument inputs, but this is not the case.  So let's
consider the limitations of the MobilePre: it is powered by the USB port,
which provides a mere 2.5 watts to power the whole kit and caboodle. This is
really micropower. By comparison,  the Midiman DMP3,
http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/DMP3-main.html , draws about 9 watts,
and it is nothing but a preamp. The more power the gadget is allowed to use,
the better the choices available to the designer.

One general problem with USB powered devices is that the internal power
rails tend to pick up noise from the USB bus. It actually jerks the ground
reference of the gadget around. It interferes with the operation of mike
level inputs. The more gain the inputs are required to supply, the more
likely this noise is to be audible.  Dynamic mikes have low output. It's a
bad combination.

Modern condenser mikes have tremendous output levels. One of these would
make the noise go away, but most of these require 48 volts phantom. The
MobilePre is specced as providing 48V, but they may be lying. Since my
MobilePre is not in my possession, we have to rely on someone else to tell
us whether it does. Or perhaps you can measure it: one probe on pin 1, the
other on pin 2 or 3.  If it does in fact put out a full 48V, then you need
to look for a cheap vocal mike. If it doesn't, or you don't trust it, you
might consider one of the AT mikes, such as the MB4K:
http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/d27241d7814a0056/index.html

Since this mike has a back electret design, it is very tolerant of low
phantom voltage: 11-52V, and can even operate from an internal battery.

&gt; The box just says PG58 vocal microphone. I just bought it new a month ago.
&gt; It connects to the back of the Mobile-Pre with a XLR connector.

&gt; I have the gain almost to full. I have it at 4 o'clock, full would be
&gt; about six. The noise that I'm hearing sounds like a low level static or
&gt; line noise. It seems that if I had more gain from the mic then the
&gt; background noise would be proportionally reduced. Does that make sense?

&gt; Would a condenser mic powered by the Mobile-Pre phantom power be a
&gt; stronger signal with less noise?

&gt; I can hear the noise through the Mobile-Pre jack with only the USB cable
&gt; connected to the PC. Am I getting some feedback or system noise from the
&gt; PC?

&gt; I bought the Mobile-Pre because I thought that it would be sending a

Neither of those descriptions makes any sense. Do you know what wideband 'white'
noise (usually called 'hiss') sounds like. Like a radio that's not tuned into
anything.

Too much 'hiss' indicates you're using a very large amount of gain (to the
extent that the mic preamp noise is your problem) and/or your preamp is a rather
poor performer.

How close is the 'performer' to the mic btw ?

Set the FFT to 65536. You should now have a much higher-resolution spectrum
and should be able to identify the noise components. If, as you suggest,
they're mostly below 100Hz, they're room noise. If you could do a screen
grab of the spectrum using the 65536 FFT setting and post it someplace
that'll tell you a lot.

Now how to get rid of it? Noise in that band usually has a few sources:

1) HVAC noise; assuming you're in North America and it's hot, this is air
conditioner noise. If necessary (and possible) turn off the air conditioner.
Ditto the dehumidifier if you have one.

2) Refrigerators. If necessary, turn off the fridge before you start to
record; at the very least, close some doors between you and it. If you turn
it off, remember to turn it on again as soon as you're done recording.

3) Traffic noise. This is harder, short of putting up barricades on your
block. (Don't laugh; they did it in Montreal on the block where the symphony
hall is when they were recording.) If you have storm windows, putting them
in place may help.

4) Computers. You *do* have your computer in another room from the
microphone, don't you? (You mentioned a long USB cable.) If not, fix that.

Finally, of course, the closer you get to the microphone, the louder your
voice will be in the mic, which will render the noise relatively quieter.

Okay, you've done all those fixes. With luck, that'll solve the problem, and
that's the best, because it's much better to prevent this sort of thing than
to try and solve it. But if it's still there...

...first try a high-pass filter, something like 3rd or 4th order
(18-24dB/octave) at 100Hz. This should interfere with your voice very little
unless you're a deep baritone or basso. If you're up close to the mic (to
maximize signal-to-noise ratio) the bass cut may even help.

Most of the time, prevention plus a good high-pass filter should solve your
problem. Only if you still hear objectionable noise should you consider
using noise reduction, which, as you point out, often leaves artifacts.

If the problem is room noise, and I'm fairly certain it is, then a condenser

Probably true, if your computer's sound card isn't very good, and many
aren't. The Mobile-Pre is almost certainly not the problem. Like I said, I'm

I think that we could call it &quot;white&quot; noise. I am about 8 inches or less
from the mic.
What do you think of using a condenser mic to increase the gain &quot;going in&quot;?
The Mobile-Pre has provisions for 48 volts of power. I think you are right.
I think that we are simply not getting enough gain, so we are cranking up
the gain to the point that we are proportionally increasing the noise. When
I look at the recorded waveform, I'm only peaking at about 30%, so I have to
normalize a lot to make the signal usable.

The phantom power is turned off. I think this is &quot;white noise&quot; not room
noise.
Do you think that the power from a condenser mike would inprove the signal
to noise ratio? I like the thought of cutting everything off below 80hz. I'm
not sure if I should do this while recording or after. I'm not sure how Cool
Edit handles this.

&gt;&gt; Using Cool Edit along with M Audio's Mobile-Pre, a Pentium 3 computer, a
&gt;&gt; Shure PG-58 mic, Windows XP.

&gt; Looks to me like you can pretty much just chop off everything below 60Hz
&gt; without noticing it, and you might even be able to get away with 80Hz this
&gt; should get rid of your entire problem, but obviously rolling it off is a
&gt; better solution (based on looking at the response graph for the PG-58,
&gt; http://www.shure.com/stellent/groups/public/@gms_gmi_web_us/documents... ).
&gt; It does look to me though that you won't be able to record at above 44.1
&gt; by too much, so the oversampling solution won't work it will only
&gt; introduce artifacts for no gain. Just a thought, do you have phantom power
&gt; turned on? I dont' see phantom mentioned in the Mobile-Pre specs, but if
&gt; it is there, turn it off.

Paul,

I set the FFT to 65536. Sorry I don't know how to give the group a screen
shot.
The noise showed a static peak level of -45 dB.

I moved my cursor over the waveform and sampled at lease 60 points. In
almost all instances other than about three, the frequency fell between 58.1
and 58.9 hz. In the three other instances the frequency averaged 49.5 hz.

&gt;&gt; I recorded 10 seconds of noise. The noise level recorded showed as -45
&gt;&gt; to -50 dB.
&gt;&gt; I'm not too technical but here is what I know. The recording was made at
&gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt; sample rate of 44,100, mono, 32 bit float, FFT size of 2048,
&gt;&gt; Blackmann-Harris. With frequency analysis of the waveform, placing my
&gt; cursor
&gt;&gt; over the form every quarter inch or so, Cool Edit showed an overall
&gt;&gt; frequency range of between 17 to 81 Hz.  In MOST random samples the
&gt;&gt; frequency was clearly in the 50s range.

&gt; Set the FFT to 65536. You should now have a much higher-resolution
&gt; spectrum
&gt; and should be able to identify the noise components. If, as you suggest,
&gt; they're mostly below 100Hz, they're room noise. If you could do a screen
&gt; grab of the spectrum using the 65536 FFT setting and post it someplace
&gt; that'll tell you a lot.

&gt; Now how to get rid of it? Noise in that band usually has a few sources:

&gt; 1) HVAC noise; assuming you're in North America and it's hot, this is air
&gt; conditioner noise. If necessary (and possible) turn off the air
&gt; conditioner.
&gt; Ditto the dehumidifier if you have one.

&gt; 2) Refrigerators. If necessary, turn off the fridge before you start to
&gt; record; at the very least, close some doors between you and it. If you
&gt; turn
&gt; it off, remember to turn it on again as soon as you're done recording.

&gt; 3) Traffic noise. This is harder, short of putting up barricades on your
&gt; block. (Don't laugh; they did it in Montreal on the block where the
&gt; symphony
&gt; hall is when they were recording.) If you have storm windows, putting them
&gt; in place may help.

&gt; 4) Computers. You *do* have your computer in another room from the
&gt; microphone, don't you? (You mentioned a long USB cable.) If not, fix that.

&gt; Finally, of course, the closer you get to the microphone, the louder your
&gt; voice will be in the mic, which will render the noise relatively quieter.

&gt; Okay, you've done all those fixes. With luck, that'll solve the problem,
&gt; and
&gt; that's the best, because it's much better to prevent this sort of thing
&gt; than
&gt; to try and solve it. But if it's still there...

&gt; ...first try a high-pass filter, something like 3rd or 4th order
&gt; (18-24dB/octave) at 100Hz. This should interfere with your voice very

&gt; unless you're a deep baritone or basso. If you're up close to the mic (to

It's commonly done at the input stage, while recording. Many mic premaps
and mixer inputs have a high pass filter built in for this purpose, and
some mics have the same. The vast majority of instruments and voices
don't have any useful low frequency information so there's no damage to
the sound.

There is no such thing as 'gain goin in'. I suspect you mean 'signal going
in'.You really need to learn how to use technical terms correctly. At the moment
your use of them is probably confusing the issue more than anything. Some
condenser mics will provide a larger signal than dynamics and *may* improve the
overall signal to noise ratio (it's not quite as simple as that) but I doubt
that this is your fundamental problem.

High gain settings do increase the noise level for sure.

That doesn't affect the *signal to noise ratio* though. The normalising is just
fine.

Okay, that tells us that the most important components of your noise signal
are low-frequency, and not 60Hz hum. Again, the culprit is likely to be room
noise: motors, blowers, etc.. Exactly where in your house are you recording?
Exactly where is the computer? Where is the refrigerator? Is the AC turned

I live in a suburb. There is a residential street out front of my house with
very little traffic except for residents who live on the street. The PC is
sitting on a small particle board (?) box about four inches off the floor
that I cut down from a small nightstand to gain a little elevation for
convenience of use. The mic is in the closet setting on top of a moveable
wooden clothes cabinet. The distance between the PC and the clothes cabinet
is about 13 feet via the floor, and themic is on its stand on top of the
cabinet, about 6 feet off the floor. There are a lot of clothes in there but
think that that just helps with sound deadening.

It's really pretty quiet in there. I won't rule out ever hearing any outside
noises but do my best to minimize such things when recording. I have
recorded in the early morning hours when all was as quiet as it will ever
be. I use stethoscope stethoscope syle headphones. I have recorded without
any headphones and found no difference in noise.

Earlier today, I made a new test recording. While recording, I shut the mic
switch off. When I looked at the meter on Cool Edit there was only about a 2
or 3 dB difference between the recorded voice and the noise level.

When recording with the mic switch off, I tried a couple of settings and
viewed my meter on Cool Edit. I usually set the gain knob at about 4
o'clock, six is max. At this setting, the meter showed -47 dB. At a 12
o'clock setting the meter was showing about -63 dB and at 9 o'clock the
meter was showing a -76 dB reading.

I'm thinking that if I don't have to raise the gain as much to get a usable
signal then we could proportionally reduce the noise. I think we are hearing
the system noise of the pre-amp because the gain is set so high. I think a
condenser mic could feed an already amplified sound into the preamp so that
the gain wouldn't need to be so high. The pre-amp has provisions for phantom
power for a condenser mic.

I tried filtering the finshed recording with several types of filters with
little or no success. I don't know why that is. If I was able to reduce the
noise level, it returned when I normalized. I tried filtering after I
normalized, no luck there either.

I can always eliminate any percentage of noise that I want after getting a

&gt;clothes cabinet is about 13 feet via the floor, and themic is on its stand
&gt;on top of the cabinet, about 6 feet off the floor. There are a lot of
&gt;clothes in there but think that that just helps with sound deadening.

&gt; It's really pretty quiet in there. I won't rule out ever hearing any
&gt; outside noises but do my best to minimize such things when recording. I
&gt; have recorded in the early morning hours when all was as quiet as it will
&gt; ever be. I use stethoscope stethoscope syle headphones. I have recorded
&gt; without any headphones and found no difference in noise.

&gt; Earlier today, I made a new test recording. While recording, I shut the
&gt; mic switch off. When I looked at the meter on Cool Edit there was only
&gt; about a 2 or 3 dB difference between the recorded voice and the noise
&gt; level.

&gt; When recording with the mic switch off, I tried a couple of settings and
&gt; viewed my meter on Cool Edit. I usually set the gain knob at about 4
&gt; o'clock, six is max. At this setting, the meter showed -47 dB. At a 12
&gt; o'clock setting the meter was showing about -63 dB and at 9 o'clock the
&gt; meter was showing a -76 dB reading.

&gt; I'm thinking that if I don't have to raise the gain as much to get a
&gt; usable signal then we could proportionally reduce the noise. I think we
&gt; are hearing the system noise of the pre-amp because the gain is set so
&gt; high. I think a condenser mic could feed an already amplified sound into
&gt; the preamp so that the gain wouldn't need to be so high. The pre-amp has
&gt; provisions for phantom power for a condenser mic.

&gt; I tried filtering the finshed recording with several types of filters with
&gt; little or no success. I don't know why that is. If I was able to reduce
&gt; the noise level, it returned when I normalized. I tried filtering after I
&gt; normalized, no luck there either.

Something is very wrong with this story. Are you saying:

1) When the mic switch is off, the CoolEdit meter shows -47dB

2) When you record your voice, the CoolEdit meter shows something like -45dB
or -44dB.

Because that's what the two paragraphs above imply.

Forget normalizing. Are these the levels you're getting in CoolEdit, raw
recording, no treatment at all?

Peace,
Paul

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Using Cool Edit along with M Audio's Mobile-Pre, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Pentium 3 computer, a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shure PG-58 mic, Windows XP.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Have you isolated the components to avoid f/back?  If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; isolation isn't possible place a thin metal grill with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; round holes   (swiss cheese pattern) in between them.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you hear noise it is already an analog signal, so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feed/back may be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; your primary prob.  Also if you have fluorescent
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; lighting
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; nearby the transformers will also cause f/back.

&gt;&gt; How can there be feedback with no speakers?

We all know those are a kind of loudspeaker.

What if you replace the microphone with a shorting wire (a paperclip will do)
between pins 2 and 3 of the preamp.  What is the noise floor then?

If the noise floor drops, the dominant noise problem is the microphone or
room.  If it does not, the dominant noise problem is the preamp.

Sounds like flicker noise from a cheap FET-IC in the mike.  You'll know
for sure if you replace the microphone with a shorting plug or calibrated load
and the problem goes away.

Could also be an air conditioner or fridge in an adjacent room, especially if
you aren't using a shockmount.

No, white noise is a specific kind of noise.

You need to find out where the noise is coming from and fix it.  Randomly

like flushing mney down the toilet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;The Mobile-Pre has provisions for 48 volts of power. I think you are right.
&gt;I think that we are simply not getting enough gain, so we are cranking up
&gt;the gain to the point that we are proportionally increasing the noise. When
&gt;I look at the recorded waveform, I'm only peaking at about 30%, so I have to
&gt;normalize a lot to make the signal usable.

Well, THERE is your problem right there.

Interesting comment.

From what I've heard here and elsewhere I'm getting the impression the US homes
are much noisier than I'm used to. Maybe the fact mine is made mainly of brick

In the US, particularly where earthquakes are an issue, buildings are
built to flex and that means they are usually wood-frame and much less
massive than a brick or cement building.  As we know from studio
designs, a single layer of gypsum board is not a very efficient sound
block.  Low frequency vibration seems to go right through exterior walls.
