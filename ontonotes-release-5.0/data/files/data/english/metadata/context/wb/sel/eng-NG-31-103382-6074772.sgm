===============================================
In a list, called for some strange reason
"Epistemology" I read a fanatic condemnation of
Israeli Kibbuzim and of:
"Israeli Air Force bombing Palestinian houses
and killing regularly (democratically) elected
Hamas leaders."
===============================================
It brings me back to 1943. The first Kibbutz I
ever saw, at the Mila str. of Warsaw Ghetto
committed the first aggressive assassination
shooting at (SS) functionaries of regularly
(democratically) elected NAZI Party, who entered
peacefully the Ghetto. There was some talk about
the SS entering in order to send the last
survivors to gas, but that was obviously the
lie of dirty Jews calumniating the regularly
(democratically) elected Party.
===============================================
The leader of the assassination known as Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising addressed the SS with "I spit
in your face" and called the survivors to die
upright, fighting and spitting in their face.
I made it to my motto, when doing my little
bit in the Ghetto and in the Polish Resistance.
===============================================
What was left of Warsaw Ghetto was transferred
to Israel, another Ghetto of 2-3 millions
besieged by a billion of Islamists commited to
the Jihad, organized in "REGULAR" Fatah's, Hamas's
Al-Qaidas, Iranian extremists, Hesbollah's,
Iaqi Saadamists, Khadafi'sts, Jordanian, Syrian,
Egyptian Armies, committed to the Second Holocaust,
vowing openly to exterminate Israelis and proving
the sincerity of their vows with a series of
pitched wars and continuous terrorism.
===============================================
I did my little bit in this second Ghetto as
well, but must admit to having disregarded a
part of my motto, that of spitting. I had respect
for my adversaries who had the guts to fight me
and, destiny deciding, to succumb.
===============================================
But I have no respect for you, back seat friends
and supporters of Hamas, of Iran's Ahmadinejad
and Hezbollah, who glorify the Second Holocaust
and plead for it.

I spit in your face

Georges.

For even stranger reasons The World Savyor, after having launched his
New Manner of Thinking campaign comes to direct statements of
intentions: after Zen, Spit. Herr GM seeks his "star from behind" in
his Zen meditations and directly spits his poison in the face of anyone
dares to bring facts against his ideology.
Turning exposure of facts into personal insults is, of course, the
method to achieve the New Manner of Thinking via the Old Way of
Offending (and possibly physically eliminate anyone who dares to bear
different ideas supported by facts).
Which are:
I have NEVER condemned any kibbutzim, rather i was remembering
something that the same GM told me once: Israeli kibbutzim give the
best jet fighter pilots to the Israeli Air Force.
It happens that the same Israeli Air Force has destroyed many civilian
targets in the recent Lebanese war: power plants, roads, airports,
ports, water plants....
More than 1,200 mostly civilian Lebanese were killed in Israel's vast
bombardment of the county and land invasion in the south.
Israeli forces pounded buildings into the ground, reducing entire
neighbourhoods to rubble and turning villages and towns into ghost
towns, as their inhabitants fled the bombardments. Main roads, bridges
and petrol stations were blown to bits. Entire families were killed in
air strikes on their homes or in their vehicles while fleeing the
aerial assaults on their villages. Scores lay buried beneath the rubble
of their houses for weeks, as the Red Cross and other rescue workers
were prevented from accessing the areas by continuing Israeli strikes.
The hundreds of thousands of Lebanese who fled the bombardment now face
the danger of unexploded munitions as they head home.

The Israeli Air Force launched more than 7,000 air attacks on about
7,000 targets in Lebanon between 12 July and 14 August,'
Statements by Israeli military officials seem to confirm that the
destruction of the infrastructure was indeed a goal of the military
campaign.
So says Amnesty International about Israeli Air Force (and the brave
jet pilots coming from kibbutzim, land of true democracy)

http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engmde180072006

Spit those human rights activists in their face, Herr Metanomski!

Israel will attempt to kill the entire leadership of Palestinian
militant group Hamas, stepping up targeted attacks, Israeli security
sources said today.
Guardian, 23 March 2004

This made a few pilots refuse to accept to fly missions which could
endanger civilians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

The declaration was aimed at Israel's policy of assassinating activists
of Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade.
"We, who have been educated to love the state of Israel refuse to take
part in airforce attacks in civilian population centres. We refuse to
continue harming innocent civilians."
A spokesman for the Israeli army said they never discussed the numbers
of military personnel in any sector but said that the 27 pilots were "a
drop in the ocean".

The birth of Israel needed a high number of refugees: palestinians had
to be chased from their homeland to make room. By the end of 1949 about
1 million Palestinian Arabs had left the region. Those Palestinian
refugees and their descendants are now more than three million. Israel
has since refused to allow the refugees to return. Add this to the
exacerbation of the Palestinians' life in the last decade and you'll
have some reasons of deep discomfort that may lead to revenge.

Certainly the Palestinian people have been viciously punished for
making their democratic choice early this year to elect a Hamas
government that Israel and the Western powers disapprove of:
an economic blockade has been imposed, starving the Palestinian
Authority of income to pay for services and remunerate its large
workforce;
millions of dollars in tax monies owed to the Palestinians have been
illegally withheld by Israel, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis;
a physical blockade of Gaza enforced by Israel has prevented the
Palestinians from exporting their produce, mostly perishable crops, and
from importing essentials like food and medicine;
Israeli military strikes have damaged Gaza's vital infrastructure,
including the supply of electricity and water, as well as randomly
killing its inhabitants;
and thousands of families are being torn apart as Israel uses the
pretext of its row with Hamas to stop renewing the visas of Palestinian
foreign passport holders.

Then the apartheid wall: the International Court of Justice has ruled
the wall to be illegal, and the General Assembly of the UN has
repeatedly and overwhelmingly supported a resolution calling for the
immediate cessation of construction. Despite this Israel continues to
ignore its international obligations and has proceeded with the
barrier.

Can anyone see the seeds of terrorism here?

In your usual bipolar mind (either with me or against me) you cannot
see that i am no supporter of Hamas nor Ahmadinejad, rather someone
who's trying to picture out the reasons of the ethical black hole
devouring the whole Middle East.
I have a prediction: soon the US economy will collapse and Israel will
loose most funds to sustain the current warfare. BRIC (Brazil, Russia,
India and China) are determined to gain access to ME resources, and if
Israel is a problem, they'll solve it. In a few decades the games will
be done. Holocausts happen for specific reasons: money and power,
always.

I salute you, hartred sower with a question: do you really think that
spitting in the face of anyone who disagree with you does any good to
the Israeli cause? Does spitting in the face help to build a world of
peace where people can live without fears and freely exchange ideas?

===============================================
G:
There is an old Jewish proverb: "I wish my worst
ennemy to have great life experience".
And another one: "It's wise to remember proverbs
and it's stupid to follow them blindly".

"I spit in your face" is a historic quotation,
which I endeavored to make my motto under certain
circumstances. Actually, Mordechai Anielewicz did
not invent it, calling Ghetto inmates to die
upright, spitting morally in the face of deathsmen
who perpetrated the Holocaust of 6 million Jews,
10 million Christians, 1900 Catholic priests,
innumerable Gipsies, Gays, Handicapped ...
and entered the Ghetto to send the few survivors
to gas.

The original "Germans, I spit in your face" was
uttered by Warsaw Mayor Starzynski in his last
speech on the day of Warsaw surrender at the
end of September 1939. I heard it and recall
exactly these words, but only vaguely the rest,
which was something like: "To morrow you will
enter my office and find me sitting behind
my desk. Don't expect me to stand up and cede
you my place. It will stay vacant after you
pull me out by force. You will torture me and
try to make me scream excuses and implore your
pardon. You may succeed, yet it won't be me,
but a piece of lacerateg flesh. These here
are my last words and they will stay so in
history: "Germans, I spit in your face".

Actually, your proverb can be taken literally,
albeit poetically: their beards were on fire,
which, communicated to the world, consumed
50 million people.

And so are the beards of all shades of
Islamists which inflamed the world with Jihad,
the WWIII, which we are losing so far.

And so are the meagre beards of their amigotes
in our midst, prophets of the second Holocaust,
haranguing to go on our knees.

I prefer to stay upright and to spit in their
face.

Georges.
