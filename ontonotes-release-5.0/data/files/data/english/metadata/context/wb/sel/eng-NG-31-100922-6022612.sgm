Okay - it's x-posted. Hope you're happy now.

No particularly interesting stories about the extraction or the
aftereffects thereof (it came out easily, it didn't bleed much at the
time and it's not even sore today) but still - it's a pretty fucking
nasty-looking tooth. Some of the funky dentine has started to
disintegrate and crumble now it's dried out...

I managed to completely shatter the wisdom tooth on the other side
whilst eating last night (I was shifting the food over to the left
side, so as not to irritate the hole/clot). From the feel of what's
left, I guess she'll just yank the fucking thing when I go to see her
tomorrow. Not my lucky week.

I'll give you a little story then. I have a molar that had root canal
and some heavy-duty filling. The filling popped out a few months back

While we normally discourage cross-posting (by dint of gang-fucking crossposters
with glass-splintered vaseline), I was actually quite impressed and engaged by
the pic.

Dentin will dry out and get crumbly without a steady supply of moisture,
nutrients and minerals from the pulpy goodness within. Once this is drilled and
scooped out, the tooth dies. This is why, when a root canal is done, the tooth
has to be shored up with a metal post and ceramic crown to maintain its
structural support.

This hits close to home at the moment, as I'm suffering from severe pain in my
upper jaw that is likely from an impacted wisdom tooth. I had my lowers done in
'98, but the doc assured me the uppers would be ok. Dipshit. The pain is dull
and throbbing, and is located well behind my molars which leads me to believe
it's not a cavity.

ObT1: I'm going to ask if I can keep the teeth after they're pulled out.

ObT2: 3 hours of general anesthesia with IV saline running left me needing to
take a wicked piss, but hardly able to hobble to the head on my own. I had to
have the dentist and assistant support me on either side as I staggered in my
blood-drooling stupor to the can. The drugs were still in effect, and halfway
there, my legs went hot and tingly, and I was *certain* I was pissing myself; it
turned out to be a tactile hallucination of some kind.

ObT3: If this happens again, I'm not going to try getting up in that condition.
I'll ask for a piss bottle, and if they don't have one handy, I may just piss
myself in the chair. I'm getting a ride home afterward anyway, right?

i'm going to have to go through that again soon myself. the dentist i went
to for the last go-round of dental surgery includes "wear old clothes" in
the pre-op instruction packet, but it took me a couple of sessions before
i found out why.

the first time, i woke up with a mouthful of novocaine, and an
overwhelming need to piss. i mumbled, "i 'ee' 'oo 'ee! 'emme uh,
i 'ee 'oo 'ee!" but they said they couldn't let me stand up right
away, because i might fall over and sue them. but in a moment or
two, the nurse and the technician held me up on either side and
helped me hobble to the john... i *just* made it.

the second session of surgery took longer, and all that IV fluid had
to go *somewhere*. this time, when i woke up, my clothes were soaking
wet from waist to thighs. yep, i'd pissed myself while i was out.

the third time, i stuffed a couple of Maxi-Pads into my unmentionables.
(i had been seriously considering buying adult diapers, until i saw
how much they cost.)

at least they always give me fun drugs afterwards...

I was about to ask you about pain when eating/drinking cold stuff,
then I saw the 'root canal' bit.

I had a broken molar that eventually got so bad that it sent agony
shooting through me every time the air moved over it as I breathed in
or out. When I finally got in to see the dentist, she sprayed cold air
onto the cracked, crumbly mess and asked me 'if that hurt'. I nodded
the affirmative whilst hanging from the ceiling.

i can't take codeine, so my dentist likes to alternate between Percocet
and Vicodin. Vicodin actually seems to do a slightly better job on the
pain, but Percocet gives me a bit of a high. the only time it's ever
made me nauseous was the one time i had the bright idea of combining it
with Mother Nature's gift to humankind... i got a pretty bad case of the
spins, and had to lie down, upon which i fell asleep. in your case,
though, yeah, drinking water will dilute the acid, as well as preventing
dry heaves. too bad you don't enjoy it.

Not that anybody really goves a shit about advice, but when I had a
filling drop out on a Friday night, some years back, I pinched a BB
sized bit off a beeswax candle. Rolled it until warm and soft, and
packed the hole. Perfect seal, until I could get to the dentist. He
agreed that it was a perfectly fine, old-fashioned remedy...

And getting busted by an Irish mick paddyface cop. "Very funny, me boyo. Now
bend over and let me see your round brown. My maglight is getting cold."

I think I almost had a nasty encounter with a plainclothes pig today. I was in a "N.Y."
deli, second in line, when this white guy in a leather coat came in and cut right to the
front of the line. The manager immediately greeted him by name and got his order.

like he can get away with that unless he's carrying a gun.

Then this cocksucking prick takes out his wallet and started fishing through the
compartments, like he was looking for his frequent diner lunch card or something.
This went on for a minute, and finally the manager saw my face and got my order.
I had called it in. What the first guy in line thought, I have no idea.

If this was a real N.Y. deli, somebody could end up dead for that. Especially if
a cop was involved. Head shots, people.

Get some 'Temparin' temporary filling from Boots. It lasts a couple of
weeks depending on how you treat it. I managed to go a year just using
it after a filling fell out, but because the original filling was the
size of a planetoid some of the tooth gradually crumbled off so I
eventually went and got it sorted out. I now have one tooth which is
half the height of the others; the dentist asked if I wanted a crown but
I said fuck it, just fill it again, so it's got a white filling in now.

The left side of my mouth has been gradually falling apart.  I broke an
upper molar eating linguine (!) recently, then lost my lower back molar
to a huge vertical crack that hurt like hell and developed an abscess.
After I got that one removed, and apparently the tooth next to it was
counting on it for support because it broke apart a few days later.  I

Heh. I always seem to have my most painful/distressing medical
problems on a Friday night, at the weekend or over a bank holiday.
Sod's law.

Last one was a severe ear infection over a bank holiday. I was in
feverish agony for two days before I could get to see a doctor (I
considered going to A+E but I didn't want to waste the time of the
doctors and nurses who had lives to save over an earache, as bad as it
felt to me at the time - and TBH, I felt too sick and dizzy to wait
for/sit on the bus and I didn't have enough money for a taxi there and
back).

On the morning my GP was coming to see me, my eardrum perforated and a
couple of teaspoonfuls of pus poured down the side of my head. I felt
so much better after that.

Months later, my hearing on that side is still not 100% and I get
twinges of pain from time to time...

I learned the trick of holding in farts for an impossibly long time in school.
My mother used to feed me raisin bran or crunchy granola cereal or *choke*
muesli every morning. This gave me an incredible amount of gas, which I
had to keep bottled up or be known as "Stinky" for the rest of my primary
education. No wonder I couldn't pay attention in class. At least until tenth
grade. After that it was the drugz. Which, oddly enough, seemed to clear

I had a similar experience, except that I lodged a large one so that it

&gt; Whiskey Sour maybe? Dunno, I'm a bourbon and water man myself.
&gt; Sometimes bourbon straight on the rocks, or rarely neat if it's really
&gt; yummy boubon, like the bottle of 15 year old Pappy Van Winkle I bought
&gt; at Starr's last Fall! Mmmmmmmm! So much rich bourbony goodness!!! :-)

&gt; JD is OK if that's all there is, but I always drink it with water on
&gt; the rocks, unless someone's passing a bottle, then it's neat, but still
&gt; it's kind of vile. But not nearly so much as many other cheap bourbons,
&gt; or heaven forbid the king of all vile hard liquors: GIN! Ick! Gin is
&gt; for only for cleaning paintbrushes and starting fires, although it
&gt; really has too much water in it for starting fires really well.

Gin is an acquired taste for a lot of people.  It definitely was
for me.

One day the vodka ran out, and so by necessity I learned to appre-
ciate a G&amp;T on a hot afternoon.  And then something happened that
I never expected: I became a martini aficionado.  A martini after
work on Fridays is a ritual of mine.

When I'm on the ball, I'll mix a couple on Thursday evening and put
them in the freezer, in a measuring cup (handy for pouring).  When
the time comes, they're downright cryogenic: cold enough to pour almost
like syrup, and to form a thin layer of ice on the outside of the glass
(also chilled overnight, of course).  At the end of the work week, that's
almost as good as a slurp-job.

There are only two reasons to sit in the back row of an airplane.
Either you have diarrhea, or you're anxious to meet people who do.

How about a long flight on a C130 with 20 guys in the back cabin.
You want to take a shit? There is one pot and it is on the port
wall and you wind it down to the level you can sit on it, in
front of the other 20 guys on the plane.

Copper *waste* pipes? Was your plumbing put in by the Romans?

Feh. A couple of years ago I spent a very enjoyable long weekend in
Prague. The only down(?)side was that the stodgy Czech cuisine mixed
with large quantities of the excellent pilsner produced prodigious
procto-rectal pressure* and an aroma which, if it could have been
weaponized, would certainly have breached the Geneva Convention on
chemical warfare.

I was in row 5 and all in Rows 6-33 must certainly have been
appreciative of my efforts. Luckily flight deck visits are a thing of
the past, otherwise we could have ended up like that Helios Air flight
where everyone including the pilots passed out. Seriously though, it
was so bad I was almost gagging myself, and the quantities were simply
enormous - several farts per minute for the entire flight. The relief
from the severe bloating I'd been experiencing was very welcome however.

I find it hard to imagine how (or why) anyone could hold farts in for
any length of time at zero feet altitude, it's far harder at 6 or 8
thousand feet (pressurised) altitude in a 'plane cabin as the pressure
differential between what's inside trying to get out and what's
outside pressing in is so much greater. Even the most heroic,
motivated and well-trained sphincter can only accomplish so much.

Various air forces put candidate pilots through simulated explosive
decompressions - the point being that hypoxia causes initially subtle
but increasingly serious mental confusion rather rapidly. But from the
a.t. point of view, what's of interest is that the test subjects
immediately and uncontrollably experience explosive farts at the
moment of decompression, as the relative pressure of even normal gut
gas is just too much to hold in. Not something they warn you about on
your seat-back card.

This now ends your Physics the A.T. Way lesson.

Much more fun to let them out especially when blame can be transferred.

No, Georgians. Just as primitive, only less intelligent.
