Hi,

I'm hoping someone here might be able to help me.  About a  month ago
I moved flat and I'm trying to get my phone line reconnected.  There
is a line in the property, but BT can't find my address in their
system and think a new line has to be installed.  If I plug a phone
into the line, I can get a dial tone, but can't call anywhere.

My question is this:  is there some way I can identify my line so that
BT can reactivate it?  I really don't want to waste an engineer's
time, or my money.

Thanks in advance,

Ewan

Or if it goes straight to BT line test facilities, dial 1470 17070.

1470 releases the presentation CLI if it has been &quot;permanently&quot; withheld,
in the same way as 141 hides it if it hasn't been withheld.

You would think that 17070 would use the network CLI like the
Emergency Services etc. but it doesn't.
