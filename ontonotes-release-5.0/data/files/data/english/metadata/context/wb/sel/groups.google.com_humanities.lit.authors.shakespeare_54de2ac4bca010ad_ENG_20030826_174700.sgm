Mark Twain was on the wrong side of most everything except horse
sense, going up against every shrine of established goodness except
the sanctity of womanhood and the boyness of boys. And he got away
with his iconclasm by turning several sorts of collective fools out
for a laugh. He dared even to turn established religion out for a
laugh, and dared even to set up a roast for Satan his very self and
his business below. His more secular target was big business, or even
small business, or any business at all that was populated with
grifters, sharks, humbugs, and sneak thieves. He took all humankind
of a bunch, and saw little chance for their redemption, take it all in
all.

Mark Twain would have known of Jesse James, of course, and possibly
liked the man's style. Twain was always searching for the right word,
and he might have envied Jesse's judgement in this. A Navy Colt .44
is an expressive choice when you want to get a point across. Mark
never shot a man, I think, but he put
a good many holes in their cherished facades. And the peculiar thing
was that he got away with it, for the world is generally kind to
people who can make us laugh.

Only once, so far as I know, did he stick up some high and mighty
people seated in their high and mighty chairs and receive scorn and
outrage for his affront. This was when he wrote &quot;Is Shakespeare
Dead?&quot; For nearly 90 years the book was out-of-print, and if you
could tar and feather a book and ride it out of the world on a rail,
that's what the Stratfordians would wish for it.

The book was sent into the world with all the humility Mark generally
gave to the cheats, frauds, and swindlers of the world, and those who
were of those tribes gave up on the man and called him a fool. The
academics of this or that profession were often his victims, and could
take a joke for the most part, but this was going too far. Mark Twain
was making a joke about the whole and entire god of literature, the
man from Stratford, and making dupes of those who believed that a
small town untaught bookless burgher was this mighty god Shakespeare
of the poems and plays. Well, that's the stuff of damnation, or 90
years purgatory at least, which for a writer is to be out-of-print.
But now we have the book again, and it's a pleasure and a laugh, and
it's still just as good and true as it was when it was first published
in 1909.

Perhaps Mark was a fool to write the book. He should have known more
that anyone that you shouldn't try to milk a cow from between it's
hind legs, and that was his mistake. The cow was owned by the
academic extablishment, and it was a holy cow. So Mark got kicked and
dumped on by the cow and the schools, and especially by those
cow-scholars who were just watching for anyone to set up behind that
cow, because they knew their cow intimately, and they knew the church
the cow belonged to.

Also, being a holy cow, there were rituals about it, and taboos, and
chants, and and they knew how to milk it, and Mark Twain was an
amateur, and they let him know it. So &quot;Is Shakespeare Dead?&quot; went out
of print and stayed out of print for about 90 years, as much for the
general ignorance of the Shakespeare Authorship Question as for the
load dropped on him on by the priests and attendents of the holy cow.

Oh, ye of little faith! Can you believe that a man of the top ten
most beloved writers since the building of the pyramids, and wise in
the ways of the cheating world, could so mistake such gullible and
sanctimonious simpletons as those who believe that the man from
Stratford was the author of those immortal works? Not likely.

In a year's time Mark Twain would be dead, and maybe took his chances
with &quot;Is Shakespeare Dead?&quot; because he did not want to travel into
eternity in the company of nitwits, geese, and humbugs. Here's a man
universally honored for his surpassing wit and intelligence, shrewd
insights, and recognition of jackass notions, and won't you believe he
knew something of literature and where it comes from?

I think you have it wrong about what Twain is universally honored
for and the reliability of your literal translation of ISD?, and
this confusion is possibly reciprocally related.

Critics notice he became famous after he left Missouri but
writing the Great American Novel in terms of its lenses, and that
novels written under his wife's influence in Connecticut, like A
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court and Mysterious
Stranger, are less honored as literature. Thus, writing about
the famous author from Stratford as the famous author now living
in Hartford, his angle of vision about origins is ambiguous,
especially where Twain-Shakespeare parallels are involved

Probably, Clemens of Hannibal (Hanman), in writing Is Shakespeare
Dead? was both making a faceted joke punning on immortality,
signified in the title, and selling a book by adding his
sarcastic humor to the public comedy of Delia Bacon's theory that
Bacon was Shakespeare.

Given this much irony in the author's celebrated comic point of
view, I doubt the serious reader familiar with Twain translates
Twain's comments in ISD literally; more like the drill is to
first recognize fools gold for what it is.

My God, Richard Kennedy knows as little about Mark Twain as he does
about Shakespeare, if such a thing is possible!

The man's ignorance is absolutely astonishing!!!! His capacity for
being wrong is wonderous.
