GenerationDB is the Portal to your personal Genealogy, powered by you
and your Family Members. An online Family Journal, which permits each
Family Member from anywhere in the World to add that missing piece you
have been searching for. Each Member can add vital or personal
interest Data, Photos, special Events and more to create a Story to be
passed along and transcend the Generations.

Family, Community, Tradition, History ~ all of that is what www.generationdb.com
is about. We offer you real memories of your own Family, as can only
be told by you and the Members of your Family that join up. Not a cold
observation you can find in Family Tree History Sites, but Anecdotes
as told by the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of your Family.

By creating the Tale from History to the Present of your Family
together, you form a stronger bond between the Generations and Family
Members that are separated by Distance. Each and every single Person
has something valuable to add to that History and with that carries on
Traditions, Believes and Responsibility.

Due to modern technology it is now easier then ever to travel
thousands of miles from your homeland, why not use the marvels of
modern technology to reconnect those strained bonds? GenerationDB
makes it simple to navigate, browse, upload and add to your Profile.
Even those among us that are Novices at computer can join in the
Family Gathering.

Simply click on an individuals profile link to discover how they are
linked within their particular Family Structure. Our unique system
keeps it simple yet is highly sophisticated. By matching everyone that
is registered up based on certain criteria each finds its place in the
correct branch of their Family Tree.

Wise men said once: "It takes a Village to raise a Child."
GenerationDB, believes that it takes the Global Village to nurture the
Identity of every "Child" no matter what its age. We all are
somebody's child.

Create your own Family Group within GenerationDB. Find likeminded
People from all over the World, share interests, find and give advice.
Be all a Family is meant to be on a large scale.

www.generationdb.com makes it possible to share only as much or as
little of yourself by letting you choose to allow your data to be
private or public. Your Privacy is strongly valued.

The possibilities are only limited by your imagination. We have given
you the Key and the Portal, now it is up to you to unlock your
Families Secrets and Treasures. Join us inside.
