Now, by God, you've got me tempted.
It still would've been a ball to see APR as a huge bound book.
It needs peanut butter stains on the page edges to mark the really good
parts. :-)

Did you ever see the TV show with the CGI work on all the U.S. secret
aircraft projects?
I was surprised you didn't show up in it at some point, as it looked
like a visual issue of APR.
I'd like to know how many RPM that triangular wing on the convertoplane
F-104 had to hit to get it airborne, given the small area of the three
rotor sections of it. Very interesting concept though; I imagine the
idea was to spin it via high pressure air jets using air bleed from the
engine's compressor section, which would be a very simple approach. I'm
surprised Lockheed didn't build one of those as a in-house project, as
if it had worked, you could sell them hand over fist all over the world.
It would beat the hell out of the Harrier in both performance and
simplicity.

How did you like how they raked "Hill-Dog" over the coals in this week's
episode? They sure do like to see just what they can get away with,
don't they?
My all-time fave is still the "Warcraft" one. I was laughing so hard  on
that one I almost fell out of the chair. The "Sea Men" is also a
classic. The movie is in a league all of its own. Well, we all know
where Saddam is at these days. :-D

Nope. The sheer number, low production values and just plain dead
wrong research of many of these "documentaries"  long ago turned me
off to 'em.

The camera lens would shatter. As they say, I have a fact fit for
radio. And a voice fit for silent films, I suppose.

Maybe, but a regular F-104 would blow it out of the sky no sweat.  The
value of VTOL fighters has largely been in a post-nukewar world where
runways have been blasted away... but the militaries of the world
gambled on not losing their runways, and just kept building
conventional and higher-performing (and cheaper) fighters.

Actaully, they didn't. Apart from showcasing Hilldogs penchant for
changing her accent to suit the locals... they pretty much kept her as
an inanimate prop. A great oppoprtunity missed. Look what they did
with Al Gore, for example.

Even in a conventional war, runways can be pretty vulnerable, especially
if there aren't many of them on hand (see, e.g., the Falklands War).

However, I'd say Scott's basically right.  Even the Harrier has been
successful mostly in the two roles where runways are scarce to begin with:
non-supercarrier navies, and close air support of troops, especially
highly mobile troops.  For either of those, there is real value in an
aircraft that's independent enough of runways to operate from close to the
action, rather than from distant bases.  But for the roles where runways
were reasonably available, the militaries have preferred to gamble on not
losing them.

If you're willing to concede STOVL rather than VTOL operation, there isn't
really much performance penalty, given good design.  The Harrier is
comparable in performance to the conventional aircraft that's closest to
the same size -- the Skyhawk -- if you are careful to compare early
Harriers to early Skyhawks and late-model Harriers to late-model Skyhawks.
However, there definitely *is* a difference in complexity, and hence cost
and reliability.

You should of seen the F-103 raging into the skies with that trail of
black exhaust behind it... last time I checked, ramjets worked a bit
more effectively than that. ;-)

It looked sharp to me, I don't know if the whole concept was sound, but
it beat the hell out of the Mirage III V as far as parasitic weight of
its VTOL system went. Mind you, to get the three little edges of the
triangular wing going fast enough to lift off might have well meant one
was dealing with a supersonic rotor, and the thing was going to generate
around 300 decibels on takeoff and landing...

How does the Falklands demonstrate this?  I thought that the Port
Stanley airfield stayed open throughout the war, or at least until it
was overrun by British ground troops.
