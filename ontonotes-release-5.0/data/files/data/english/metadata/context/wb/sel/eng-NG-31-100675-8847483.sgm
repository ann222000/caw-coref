But, unlike, YOU, pathetic creeps, *I*,
actually, *have*, a, fulfilling,
professional and social,
*REAL* *LIFE*, that, I
am, Actually,
*LIVING*....!!

HELLO....!?

So, there, ARE,
times, that, I,
may, indeed,
start posting
again, (fully
*intending* to
stick around
for another
extended
spell), (to
valiantly
resuscitate
'My Little
Miss
A.C.S.',
yet again,
as only _*I*_
Can Truly
(Bloody!!)
Truly, Do);
Yep,
There
ARE,
Times, I'll
Do, *THAT*,
But, Yet,
Something
*MAY*
Come-Up
Which
Suddenly
PREVENTS Me
From Sticking
For Around
As Long As I
Had Planned,
Etc., Etc.!!

That's all there, is, or,
was, to it.
Period.

It truly speaks volumes,
how, when, *I*, end-up,
inaccurately stating
and//or conveying
something, (in
regards to my
staying or going),
that, *I*, always
err on the side
of thinking that I'll
stay posting here
longer than I actually
end-up doing, at times,
whereas, most
of, *YOU*, utterly
lonely and lovelorn
fools, always end-up
coming back, *much*
*sooner*, and,
embarrassingly
renigging on
your plans to
stay away....!!

HELLO....!?

What does &quot;renigging&quot; mean? Sounds racist. Chafey, I knew you weren't
dead. Hoped you were. Knew you weren't. But if you do decide to kill
yourself, please take that annoying gaping colon with you.

I am not small at all nor am I unclever
in even the slightest sense. I am
highly-original and immensely
clever and I am LUSCIOUSLY
LARGE and DOMINATINGLY
IN-CHARGE, Baby!! And
YOU (Bloody!!)
know it, Mr.
Jealous--:
Jaffery
Joueat....!!

Which is why you and all the
others had so desperately
longed for My
Glorious
Return (i.e.
Resurrection)....!!

Also, I must have hurt your feelings
severely yet again. Which is
clearly the reason for those
thoroughly
undeserved

UNTRUE
negative

&quot;Renigging&quot; is my coolly alternative
spelling for &quot;reneging&quot;. No racist
notions are in any way
implied in even the
slightest senses.
Period. My

colloquialism
(Or, what I
like to call
My--: Ultra-Cool
'Colloquiasniggin')
....*IS*....
above

No. Wrong Again, Jealous Jaffery Joueat.
Just the opposite. I am in an extra
good-an-giddy mood, dude.
Things are going better
than expected. And
I've just been
extra busy,
is all.

You and your Daisy Dude Witch

deal with your perpetual
ultra-failures at
trying to successfully
wish some kind of
