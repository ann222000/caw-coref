That is the question :)  I've heard for years only turn a steak (or even a
burger) one time, halfway through cooking.  I generally stick to that rule
because I can usually tell it will be cooked to my liking.  But then it
occurred to me.  Why only once?  Does it make a difference?

That's so it gets really browned on the outside
before it's done on the inside.  If you turned
it very often, it would become more uniformly
cooked all the way through.  The browned surfaces
add lots of flavor.  If you didn't want it that
way, you could steam it or microwave it.

I once-flip burgers since like you, you develop that &quot;knack&quot;. Sometimes it's
visual, sometimes it's aroma and sometimes even the sound of sizzling.

If I want to baby my food as it cooks, it doesn't matter. That's what
probably separates me from the great restaurant chefs. ;)

America's Test Kitchen did a show on that some time ago and I now have
adapted it. I like my steaks to be pink in the middle, not bloody. I
also like them to have a nice sear on the outside.

So I season them, into a very hot pan (One that has been seriously
abused by searing!) four minutes to a side. You can hear it, when the
volume of sizzling reduces you've got a nice sear going on and can flip
it.

Then into an oven preheated to 400F for ten minutes, turning once at 5
minutes. Then the meat is allowed to rest under tented aluminum foil for
5 minutes.

I suppose everyone has their own technique but for me it depends on
thickness and for what level of doneness I'm striking.  For medium
rare with steaks and burgers under 3/4&quot; I flip once, with thicker meat
I filp twice.  I think success is mostly predicated on experience, the
only way to learn is to do a LOT of grilling/frying and eating.  I'll
cook rare but I won't cook a steak done more than med-rare, when
someone wants their meat more well done I let them cook their own.  I
think beef cooked to what people call medium (a little pink in the
center) is ruined, by then it's too dry.  Btw, the reddish juice you
see comming out of rare or med-rare beef is not blood... the animal's
blood was all drained at slaughter... any blood remaining will form
clots you can't possibly miss.  The reddish juice that exudes from
beef is water and minerals that dissolve in the warmed water naturally
contained in the meat... mammal flesh is like 73pct water.  Bloody
rare is a misnomer.

But if you are cooking on a grill, I would think you need to turn
twice, so you can get those cute little branded cris-crosses on the
meat;-)

Well, yes, but that's not turning it _over_ more than once.  I rotate the
steaks ~90 degrees after about 2 minutes of cooking to get the criss-cross
marks, and repeat that on the other side when I do turn it over.

You just answered a question that I've had for the longest time.  I
have always lost track of where the grill marks were, so that I could
line them up perfectly when I flipped them.

Now I know - all I need do is rotate them the 90 degrees. . .That is
so unbelievably simple that even a blonde should have known that;-)

Ahem...

For &quot;pseudo-diamond&quot; grill marks lay your steak on the grill at a 45° angle
to the grill rods, then rotate 90° from the steak's centerpoint. Starting a
steak straight across the grill rods and rotating creates the unappealing
looking &quot;rows and columns&quot; grill marks. Long steaks might also be rotated
so the ends move away from the burners or coals causing uneven cooking AND
grill marks.

For true diamond grill marks, lay your steak on the grill at a 22.5° angle
to the grill rods, then rotate 45° from the steak's centerpoint. A diamond
grilled steak creates more grill marks, hence a more char-grilled tasting
steak.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Well now, if you guys were ALL that smart, how come you left the part

&gt;&gt; &gt; I stood there looking at the grill late last night, and the meat

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But if you are cooking on a grill, I would think you need to turn
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; twice, so you can get those cute little branded cris-crosses on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meat;-)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Myrl Jeffcoat

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, yes, but that's not turning it _over_ more than once.  I rotate the
&gt; &gt; &gt; steaks ~90 degrees after about 2 minutes of cooking to get the criss-cross
&gt; &gt; &gt; marks, and repeat that on the other side when I do turn it over.

&gt;&gt; For &quot;pseudo-diamond&quot; grill marks lay your steak on the grill at a 45°
&gt;&gt; angle to the grill rods, then rotate 90° from the steak's centerpoint.
&gt;&gt; Starting a steak straight across the grill rods and rotating creates the
&gt;&gt; unappealing looking &quot;rows and columns&quot; grill marks. Long steaks might
&gt;&gt; also be rotated so the ends move away from the burners or coals causing
&gt;&gt; uneven cooking AND grill marks.

&gt;&gt; For true diamond grill marks, lay your steak on the grill at a 22.5°
&gt;&gt; angle to the grill rods, then rotate 45° from the steak's centerpoint. A
&gt;&gt; diamond grilled steak creates more grill marks, hence a more

I lay the steaks on the grate at a 60 degree angle to their length,
then rotate to 60 degrees the other way... this produces a diamond
patern in the appropriate relationship to the steak configuration.  I
don't think checkerboard squares directly across mid axis is very
aesthetically pleasing.  Of course I'm talking approximately, I don't
actually use a protractor... although that's not such a shabby idea
for a grilling tool.

&gt; &gt; occurred to me.  Why only once?  Does it make a difference?

&gt; America's Test Kitchen did a show on that some time ago and I now have
&gt; adapted it. I like my steaks to be pink in the middle, not bloody. I
&gt; also like them to have a nice sear on the outside.

&gt; So I season them, into a very hot pan (One that has been seriously
&gt; abused by searing!) four minutes to a side. You can hear it, when the
&gt; volume of sizzling reduces you've got a nice sear going on and can flip
&gt; it.

&gt; Then into an oven preheated to 400F for ten minutes, turning once at 5
&gt; minutes. Then the meat is allowed to rest under tented aluminum foil for
&gt; 5 minutes.
">

I use a variation on your technique. This is for steaks that are at
least 1.5 inches thick.

1. Season steak with S&amp;P. Pat dry with paper towels. Rub with a little
grapeseed oil.

2. Heat oven to 500 degrees.

3. Turn the vent hood to high.

4. Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat until smoking, and then a few
minutes more.

5. Put the steak in the skillet and let it sear for a minute or 2. Don't
try to move it. Use tongs to lift a corner to see if it is seared to
your liking.

6. Use tongs to flip the steak.

7. Put the pan in the oven.

8. Cook until medium rare or to your liking.

The last step is the hard part - how do you know when it is done? Until
you have the experience to just &quot;know&quot; you can use a cooking thermometer
inserted into the middle of the steak. Take it out about 5 degrees below
the desired temp.

Obviously it depends on the thickness of the steak as well as the cooking
method.  But I love my steak done rare.  Sear it well on the outside,
absolutely.  But leave it pink and juicy on the inside.  Steak done more

The goal is 100% of the white cooked hard, and 100% of the yolk still

Harold McGee says that for the most uniform doneness through the
thickness of the meat (medium-rare throughout right up to the surface,
as opposed to brown, moving through gray to a thin pink stripe in the
middle), you should turn often; every thirty seconds to a minute, say.
Of course, use tongs; not a fork.

From a physics and heat transfer standpoint, that makes the most sense,
too. If you cook one side until completely done and then turn, the top
side is just sitting there cooling off, while the second side heats up.
If you're into heat transfer calculations, it can be shown that with the
&quot;one flip&quot; method it takes longer to bring the center point up to a
given temperature.

Grill or pan seared, I always use the turn-turn-turn technique.

&gt;&gt; &gt; But if you are cooking on a grill, I would think you need to turn
&gt;&gt; &gt; twice, so you can get those cute little branded cris-crosses on the
&gt;&gt; &gt; meat;-)

&gt;&gt; &gt; Myrl Jeffcoat

&gt;&gt; Well, yes, but that's not turning it _over_ more than once.  I rotate the
&gt;&gt; steaks ~90 degrees after about 2 minutes of cooking to get the criss-cross
&gt;&gt; marks, and repeat that on the other side when I do turn it over.

&gt;You just answered a question that I've had for the longest time.  I
&gt;have always lost track of where the grill marks were, so that I could
&gt;line them up perfectly when I flipped them.

&gt;Now I know - all I need do is rotate them the 90 degrees. . .That is

Yes, but most people do not want uniform doneness throughout.  They

Well, I don't think that's right. The &quot;turn often&quot; technique is much
more likely to give you a nice, thick layer of &quot;juicy underdoneness in
the middle&quot; and a crusty exterior.

Heat transfer is no different in the kitchen than anywhere else; do the
math.
