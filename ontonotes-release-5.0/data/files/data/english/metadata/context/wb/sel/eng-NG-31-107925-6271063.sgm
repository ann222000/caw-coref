Which driver do you think will have the biggest turnaround from the 06
season? I am thinking that Elliot Sadler or Casey Mears either one
might be ready to step up a notch and of course now that Nascar legend
Sterling Marlin is totally commited to Nascar and not F1 I look for
the #14 WMD car to be running up front every week as well.

Well, I'm glad to hear that Sterling has been committed, er, is
committed to roundy-round racin'.

However, I think it will be Mark Martin.  Running a limited schedule,
you just know he's going to go for the win every week.  No more points
chasin'.

I predict he'll win at least 50% of the races he enters, making everyone
remember David Pearson.

I think Ward Burton's 2007 season will be far more productive than his '06
effort.

I would say JPM, but it's kinda hard to improve upon racing at the top
of the mountain.
