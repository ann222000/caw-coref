Wow! That *reeks* of objectivity.

C'mon, there is a lopsided population of anti-Ferrari posters here. When
Schumacher was driving they focused on him and now it's Ferrari as a

fairing somewhat better perhaps because a. he's ex-Ronny Mac and b. his

Really?

Many of us have been Ferrari fans for more years than we care to
mention. Personally I've followd Ferrari since the late fifties, my
father for many years before that.

Which is why we hate the lying, cheating team they've become.
Win-at-all-costs Ferrari.

Not by me he's not. I rate him pretty highly, he's a passionate Ferrari

seems to have the passion... something which Kimi has not got, and will
never have.

Stepney is innocent. There is not a shred of evidence against him. If
one day it becomes a proven fact that he stole Ferrari secrets I for
one will cheer his demise, but until then, and, it seems, unlike you, I
believe in the innocence of anyone accused until he or she is proven
guilty. As at this date Ferrari haven't even attempted to do that. Just
smears and innuendos.

I would argue on several points, however, why bother? I've found the
argumentative process for logical debate is absent here. In fact, a
favorite ploy seems to be an attack on word usage or other bizarre method

Yes, but it is good fun. I would think that any Ferrari fan who didn't
at least think of the possibility of framing, has not thought the
whole thing through properly for one reason or another.
No matter how thin it is.

Not very (thin), apparently. Why not McLaren framing Coughlin? That works,
doesn't it? Or how about paying Coughlin large sums to take the fall?
Can't you visualize Ron Dennis with a rather large briefcase full of
sterling notes? No, strike that, make it Swiss Francs. And while were at
it, wouldn't Ronny be quite the smart lad and maximize use of the Ferrari
data whilst planning ahead to be sure that nothing resulted in looking
like Ferrari intellectual product? Little did he know that the idiot Trudy
would take the stuff to a copy shop to help hubby pull an end around with
Honda.

Of course it's a possibility. But the copying discounts that by indicating
anything other than a 'patsy'.

What is lacking amongst many here is an acknowledgement that the smoking
gun was never going to be found. The evidence that was found was quite
damning, but the idea that any direct copying would have taken place or
that with such warning any trail would be found is ludicrous.

Well, we could play the conspiracy game until the cows were copied
back home. :)

Let's do so..
As we know, Ferrari had all kinds of problems with Stepney for months,
even prior to this fiasco, with nasty words being said on both sides.
Being the security conscious company, they've placed a PI on him and
followed his communications tracks. Upon learning that someone ratted
out the illegality of their floor, they've looked further into it and
found that Stepney had been in contact with Coughlan on numerous
occasions, and also with regards to a possible split to a team, let's
say to Honda.
They saw their chance and sent a red package to Coughlan, knowing that
he would see it as invaluable in coming up with a great plan for
Honda. Of course, being already able to prove some form of collusion
between Coughlan and Stepney, all they would have to do is to post the
parcel in the name of Stepney, leaving a trail and then when the time
is right, stumble on this information. Even better, an unforeseen
occurance at a copy shop could hand them the perfect opportunity to
start the scheme rolling.. and they wouldn't even need to resort to
that shaky fake trail..
Once the case unrolled, Stepney would be totally discredited in
anything he may blab to the media, teams or to the FIA about Ferrari
and as an bonus, McLaren as a competitor will be rattled and will
probably be forced to draw into their shell a bit, which can not be
bad for the racing series from Ferrari's point of view..
And Coughlan ? Nobody cares about him, he is just a handy pawn in the
big game.

Far fetched ? Maybe, but if i can think of it, they could too. :)

And before the fuckwits chime in.. it is not my POV, it was mere
speculation for the sake of speculation.

Agree. On the other hand it also leaves the question whether in fact
any of it was used in any way.
Then again the floor thing remains dubious, the only thing that makes
that somewhat understanable is that if i recall, that was the time
when Stepney and Ferrari were publicly at each other's throat. Call it
a hate crime ? :)

When Spyker and Tora Rosso are fighting over the WC's and playing
silly buggers with internet protocols or whatever, then they will be
argued over.

Why not have a go at the Renault fans. They were in the mix last year.
Surely its up to them to discuss thier team. But, this year they are
oddly very quiet. Or should Mclaren and Ferrari fans help out a bit by
slagging off the crappy Renault?

Or are you a Ferrari fan, all upset over yesterdays decision, and want
to have a weak op at the victiorious Mclaren fans? Oh, ok, fair
enough. Good luck.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You must be new here. For at least 10 years, probably more,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F1 teams have been discussed.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They've been discussed all right.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; otoh if you're a comparative cfn you can foad.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow! That reeks of objectivity.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C'mon, there is a lopsided population of anti-Ferrari posters
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Really?

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Many of us have been Ferrari fans for more years than we care
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mention. Personally I've followd Ferrari since the late
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fifties, my
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; father for many years before that.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why we hate the lying, cheating team they've become.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Win-at-all-costs Ferrari.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Schumacher was driving they focused on him and now it's
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ferrari as a whole, the biiig cheaters

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; No, not now, they've been cheating since Schumacher and Todt
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; startyed to mould their philosophy.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Massa is now known as &quot;chump.&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Not by me he's not. I rate him pretty highly, he's a passionate
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ferrari fan... his overall driving abilities remain suspect,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; but in
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the end he seems to have the passion... something which Kimi
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; has
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; not got, and will never have.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kimi is fairing somewhat better perhaps because a. he's
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ex-Ronny
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mac and b. his &quot;taking a shit.&quot; quote. And the ludicrous
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theories, such as Ferrari planted the data and is framing
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stepny.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Stepney is innocent. There is not a shred of evidence against
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him.
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If one day it becomes a proven fact that he stole Ferrari
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; secrets I
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; for one will cheer his demise, but until then, and, it seems,
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; unlike you, I believe in the innocence of anyone accused until
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or she is proven guilty. As at this date Ferrari haven't even
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; attempted to do that. Just smears and innuendos.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I would argue on several points, however, why bother? I've found
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; argumentative process for logical debate is absent here. In fact,
&gt;&gt; &gt; a
&gt;&gt; &gt; favorite ploy seems to be an attack on word usage or other
&gt;&gt; &gt; bizarre
&gt;&gt; &gt; method of attempting to quiet someone, leaving any true
&gt;&gt; &gt; discussion
&gt;&gt; &gt; left for dead.  Or your style, &quot;you know nothing about F1,&quot; &quot;your
&gt;&gt; &gt; viewpoint is worthless&quot; and the wonderful &quot;foad&quot; suggestion.

&gt;&gt; So, quote the evidence which points to Stepney's guilt.

&gt;&gt; That'll do for a start.  Here ya go, this space left for your
&gt;&gt; proof,
&gt;&gt; nothing more, nothing less:

&gt;&gt; .
&gt;&gt; .
&gt;&gt; .
&gt;&gt; .

&gt;&gt; anything yet?

&gt;&gt; We await your proof with bated breath (but I'd bet you don't have
&gt;&gt; an
&gt;&gt; answer).

&gt;&gt; tick-tock-tick-tock

&gt; Stepny's guilt? That's a good subject. However, more germane is for
&gt; you to
&gt; quote the evidence which points to Ferrari planting data and framing
&gt; someone.
">

With the lack of evidence, both are equally possible. But some choose
to believe one lack of evidence or the other.

The only imbalance is the recent cheating histories of both teams,
where Ferrari look pretty poor compared to Mclaren.

A conspiracy only works for Ferrari. There is nothing in it for
Mclaren. Ferrari data is only really usefull to Ferrari. Its even more
useless in July. The only thing Mclaren could get form the documents
is proof of Ferrari cheating. Imagine the painc at Ferrari if that
were tha case.

Simply, there is more to gain by Ferrari proving espionage than for
Mclaren to actually do it.

And making the leap from one employee being in posession of these docs
to a team being directly involved and cheating is a desparate stretch
at best.

That could be much simpler. Set the PI on Stepney and discover the
Coughlan relationship. Then just anonomously send the docs to
Coughlan. Expose it by a report from the PI that a large package was
seen posted by Stepney.

To me, the most interesting thing is Stepney's silence. I wonder what
his deal was? Clearly not enough to completely stitch up Mclaren,
yet...........

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wow! That reeks of objectivity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C'mon, there is a lopsided population of anti-Ferrari posters
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Really?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many of us have been Ferrari fans for more years than we care to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mention. Personally I've followd Ferrari since the late
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fifties, my father for many years before that.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why we hate the lying, cheating team they've become.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Win-at-all-costs Ferrari.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Schumacher was driving they focused on him and now it's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ferrari as a whole, the biiig cheaters

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No, not now, they've been cheating since Schumacher and Todt
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; startyed to mould their philosophy.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Massa is now known as &quot;chump.&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not by me he's not. I rate him pretty highly, he's a passionate
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ferrari fan... his overall driving abilities remain suspect,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but in the end he seems to have the passion... something which
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kimi has not got, and will never have.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kimi is fairing somewhat better perhaps because a. he's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ex-Ronny Mac and b. his &quot;taking a shit.&quot; quote. And the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ludicrous theories, such as Ferrari planted the data and is
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; framing Stepny.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Stepney is innocent. There is not a shred of evidence against
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him.  If one day it becomes a proven fact that he stole Ferrari
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; secrets I for one will cheer his demise, but until then, and,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it seems, unlike you, I believe in the innocence of anyone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accused until he or she is proven guilty. As at this date
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ferrari haven't even attempted to do that. Just smears and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; innuendos.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I would argue on several points, however, why bother? I've found
&gt; &gt; &gt; the argumentative process for logical debate is absent here. In
&gt; &gt; &gt; fact, a favorite ploy seems to be an attack on word usage or
&gt; &gt; &gt; other bizarre method of attempting to quiet someone, leaving any
&gt; &gt; &gt; true discussion left for dead.  Or your style, &quot;you know nothing
&gt; &gt; &gt; about F1,&quot; &quot;your viewpoint is worthless&quot; and the wonderful &quot;foad&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggestion.

&gt; &gt; So, quote the evidence which points to Stepney's guilt.

&gt; &gt; That'll do for a start.  Here ya go, this space left for your proof,
&gt; &gt; nothing more, nothing less:

&gt; &gt; .
&gt; &gt; .
&gt; &gt; .
&gt; &gt; .

&gt; &gt; anything yet?

&gt; &gt; We await your proof with bated breath (but I'd bet you don't have an
&gt; &gt; answer).

&gt; &gt; tick-tock-tick-tock

&gt; Stepny's guilt? That's a good subject.

Gonna answer it, then?

Thought not!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Ferrari stated that Stepney stole the information and gave it to
Coughlan.

He did no such thing. Therefore someone else at Ferrari must have done
so. But it backfired, didn't it?

You would get short on words too, if you got a black stallion's head

As i recall he still has a criminal issue to settle in Italy, so he'd
be a nutcase to even tell the time to the media and i'm sure his

He certainly stated that he has a lot to say. Time will tell whether
he indeed has something. Or perhaps he is full of crap, or if not get

weights.

You're not wrong. I suppose we'll have to wait a few years for a book
or too to come out. Mind you, testimony in open court should be
interesting. Although, I would imagine that Ferrari would have as much
to fear in open court as perhaps Mclaren. Im not so sure it will get
that far. A few $m will solve most F1 probems :)

As of what we know, McLaren had no reason to frame Coughlan.

Pay him sums ? But of course, that is basically what the accusation is
all about. If McLaren had any use or even idea of that data and
Coughlan was the courier, then the courier would get a tip.

As for the use of the data, of course McLaren could attempt to cover
all, but it would be damn hard to evaluate a part's data then alter it
so it can not relate back to Ferrari and still have it working as
expected. Unless you think that things like torquing down the fuel
flap screws at 24lbs instead of 21 is something that didn't occur to
McLaren who had a pretty good car from the getgo..

The Honda thing indeed. That is what makes this McLaren thing all too
fuzzy. If it wasn't for that, my suspicion would be much higher, but
that thing just sets a very likely scenario that it was just engineers
building resources for their new team. The copying was probably done
in order to pass it on to others who were to be on that team as well.
Remember that a BMW and another McLaren person was rumoured to be on
this new team.
Coughlan, of course, may have taken some of what he read to the
McLaren table, but it would be counter productive for him to give away
any of the good stuff.
