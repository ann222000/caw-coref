Oh boy.

&quot;The Old Testament talks about almah 'young woman,' not bethulah 'virgin.'
However, the scholars in the 3rd century BC translated the Hebrew almah as
parthenos in Greek. Thus the 'young woman' in Hebrew metamorphosed into a
'virgin' in Greek?and she has remained a virgin ever since in translations
across the world. The notion of 'virgin birth' was born, thanks to a
mistranslation.&quot;

Does anyone think we can settle this one on Honyaku? Invite comments from
the Jesuits? Redo the Septuagint (1) ourselves?

It could be said that at the time and place in question an UNMARRIED young woman would have been a virgin by definition, i.e., she would have had to be / was supposed to be / was assumed to be a virgin (many societies had/have such tatemae-type notions). ;-)

However, Mary is reported to have been MARRIED, no? By similar definition she therefore had to / was supposed to / was assumed to have had sex with her husband.

Wonder what there would be left to argue about. ;-)

You are right about the unmarried status equating with virginity. On your
second point, however, Mary was NOT married to Joseph at the time in
question. She was only ENGAGED to be married, which would make the situation
very touchy indeed... (as the Gospel of Luke refers to, in an oblique way)

As you might expect, this issue has been analyzed for centuries. I
have heard that the status usually translated as &quot;betrothed&quot; in
traditional English translations of the Gospels may have been
equivalent to marriage in the modern legal/moral sense. So maybe the
situation was not just touchy, but also feely.

However, the account given in the Gospels says that Joseph discovers
that Mary is pregnant (not by him) and rather than denounce her for
fornication and have her stoned to death, as he could have, he
decides to break the engagement quietly. Then an angel appears to him
and tells him to marry Mary anyway.

I'm currently in the midst of an in-depth  course on religion and
theology for lay peopel sponsored by the Episcopal Church, and right
now, we're on the New Testament. The current thinking on this story
among Biblical scholars stems from the fact that the Gospel writers
liked to spice up their accounts with allusions to more ancient
texts, some valid, some not so valid.

I don't know Hebrew, but whether the word in question means &quot;virgin&quot;
or &quot;young woman,&quot; Matthew takes the passage usually quoted as &quot;And a
virgin shall conceive and bear a son...&quot; out of context. If you look
at the original passage from Isaiah, it refers not to an event in the
distant future (about 700 years in the future), but to an event that
is about to happen very shortly.

The New Testament is full of back references like this.

Form criticismly yours,

There.  Thanks for a good chuckle : )

My world almost toppled over flat on account of a single mistranslation.
That's not a good picture from where I'm looking at.

I am not a Bible scholar and I know nothing of the languages involved, but I
think an extraordinary claim like this requires extraordinary proof.

I think the birth of Jesus Christ to the virgin mother Mary is a central
tenet of Christianity and this supposed miracle of his birth is cited as
proof that Jesus is the prophesied Christ or Savior; this is why he is said
to be the son of God since he was supposedly not born of conception with a
human father.

There are several mentions in the Old Testament of prophesies to the effect
that a virgin mother will give birth to the son of God.

Think about it: why would anyone make, listen to or give credence to a
prophesy claiming that not a virgin but merely a &quot;young woman&quot; would give
birth to Christ? This would be commonplace and not miraculous at all.

As to the meanings of the words used, as translators, we all know that some
words can have different meanings and nuances. The word &quot;virgin&quot; is fairly
clear in its meaning, but the word &quot;maiden&quot; is not. It can refer to a virgin
as in a &quot;maiden voyage&quot; or the &quot;maidenhead&quot; (hymen), but it can also refer
to a young woman.

Perhaps the Hebrew word in question had meanings something like &quot;maiden&quot; but
it was translated with a more specific Greek word meaning &quot;virgin.&quot; Is this
a translation error?

If it were an error, why would no one have noticed it in the 2000+ years
hence? The Bible has to be one of the most closely studied documents ever.

Is this even an important issue? To Catholics, I believe the critical
issue is that Mary was free of original sin (the immaculate conception),
not virginity of the mother. I don't know that any Protestant religions
believe in that, but again, would it matter if Mary wasn't a virgin? As
stated here, she was unmarried and surely virgin, but even if it were
somehow deduced that she wasn't, is there any theological point that
would be in trouble? Just curious. BB

This is a good point. As long as the conception was divine, it doesn't
seem like it would matter, but certainly having a virgin divine
conception is more believable as a miracle than a non-virgin divine
birth. Perhaps it is a critical issue for all Christian denominations
that Mary was virgin.

For reference, the AHD3 gives unmarried girl/woman as definition 1a and
virgin as definition 1b for maiden. BB

Oh, please. This is not something new at all. It and countless other
such &quot;errors&quot; have been known for a long time. Most believers are
simply ignorant of them or choose to rationalize them away.

Here's another one. The ascension story is also one of the big events
in the Christian tradition today, yet it didn't even make it into the
early editions of the Gospels. It was added on by early Christians
several decades after the fact. This, too, has been known for a long
time by scholars, but what about the general public? It's another
conveniently ignored factoid.

Wow! I always thought Jesus was a spirit after he was crucified. I never

I presume that you are referring to the verses added on to the end of Mark?

The Ascension is certainly missing from the early editions of Mark. But the
Ascension is in the earliest versions of the other three Gospels, as well as
in the intro to Acts, and is alluded to in early catechisms quoted by Paul.

The whole topic of how the Christology stories developed in the NT, and also
based on what the early writers thought the OT said (reading from the Greek
Septuagint rather than from the Hebrew), is a fascinating subject that I
could discuss on and on. But this is getting far from Honyaku's mission. So
I will desist.

Why would Mark end his account with the Resurrection, and say nothing
about the Ascension? Did he just forget about it?

Considering that Mark was the earliest of the Gospels, and the Acts and
Paul's epistles were all written later than the Gospels, it seems clear
that the Ascension story was devised by early Christians but not part
of the earliest Gospel accounts. It became necessary in order to
explain what happened to Jesus after the Resurrection.

(Sorry to prolong this OT discussion, but it's hard to leave something
in a half-explained state.)

As I said, I am not a Bible scholar and cannot cite any passages at all. I
have only heard of several such prophesies. Those interested might want to
look into this article in the Catholic Encyclopedia:
http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15464b.htm

I think the point is the &quot;sign&quot; from God. From what I understand, they had
interpreted this to mean a physical sign. Supposedly Mary was examined and
found to be a virgin (with an intact hymen) both while she was with child
and even after the birth of Jesus.

I think this is interpreted as being a miraculous sign that Jesus was indeed
the son of God and the Savior of prophesy, as no man could have been the
father.

I don't think this is a matter of reading anything into the text. The words
&quot;behold a virgin shall conceive&quot; would be interpreted by the listeners as
being a prophesy of a miracle only if the word &quot;virgin&quot; (whatever it was in

The original Mark ends in a sentence fragment. Apparently there is supposed
to be something else, but nobody knows (or knew) what that might be. So
early editors filled it in with various versions, one of which has come down
to us as the Orthodox version. This one happens to accord closely with the
other Three Gospels, and Acts.

Wateru's argument is that if the Ascension is missing in the Oldest Gospel,
it must have been made up by the Other Gospels. But surely the situation is
more complicated than that...

For example, Paul alludes to an Ascension several times in his letters,
which predate any of the Gospels (including Mark). See 1 Thess. 1:10, for
example, which is reliably date to 51 C.E., or two chapters later, where the
famous Rapture verse can be found, talking about a Return (a reverse
Ascension, if you will).

&gt;&gt; &quot;The Old Testament talks about almah 'young woman,' not bethulah

&gt;&gt; 'virgin' in Greek?and she has remained a virgin ever since in
&gt;&gt; translations
&gt;&gt; across the world. The notion of 'virgin birth' was born, thanks to a
&gt;&gt; mistranslation.&quot;

I didn't write that, but:

&gt; If it were an error, why would no one have noticed it in the 2000+ years

その通りです。その書評の論理は無茶苦茶すぎる。

それでも私達翻訳者にとって「翻訳ミス」と指摘されたら、敏感ですよね。

新約聖書の著者は、旧約聖書における当該問題箇所を「予言」として捕らえ

To which Alan agrees quite fervently.

It might be helpful to remember, though, the importance that was placed
in those times on the fulfilment of every phrophecy in the scriptures,
right down to the smallest detail. This was carried to such an extreme
that in some cases where the original Old Testament text had a disputed
reading, the New Testament story was written to fulfil both readings.
This resulted in some highly convoluted stories like that in Matthew
26-27, where the repentant Judas returns his blood money and the Jewish
priests use the money to buy a &quot;potter's field.&quot; The story is
deliberately written so that both possible readings of the disputed Old
Testament passage (Zech. 11) are covered.

Given that kind of culture, the translation of Heb. almah (not b'tulah)
in the Septuagint into a word that clearly means &quot;virgin&quot; was a very
consequential decision. Maybe it overstates things to say the &quot;virgin
birth&quot; notion was born of a mistranslation, but the decision to
translate it that way certainly sealed the deal for Christianity.

Wow, and i always thought &quot;bethrothed&quot; or &quot;espoused&quot; (the words i recall being used in some or other version of the bible) meant &quot;married&quot;.

This translation may indeed have been fortuitous for Christianity, but the
decision to translate the word in that manner certainly could not have been
influenced by Christian doctrine or dogma. Remember that the Septuagint was
completed by Jewish scholars in 300-200 BC -- two or three centuries before
the birth of Christ and the schism between Judaism and Christianity.

It appears to have been later Jewish scholars that, hundreds of years after
the fact of the translation of the Septuagint, objected to the translation
of that word, perhaps in an attempt to discredit the breakaway Christians
and their belief in Jesus as the Messiah. Why did the Jewish scholars as a
body not object to the translation before Christianity came about?

It seems curious that a correct translation would suddenly become a
translation error due to a change in the political or theological climate.

Why do you insist on calling it the &quot;correct&quot; translation, after having
told us you know nothing about either language?

You have also vastly oversimplified a few hundred years of history,
much of which has been told in the considerable body of messianic
writings that did not make it into the Bible, as well as the
relationship between the messianic Jews of that time and the people who
started what is today called Christianity. But all of that is seriously
off topic for this list.

It is not my opinion that the Septuagint translation is correct, but rather
I am leaving this decision up to the learned Jewish scholars. The 70 or 72
scholars that worked to prepare the Septuagint would naturally have done
their best to ensure it was a correct translation. Once complete, the
translation was naturally distributed to other scholars and read and
presumably scrutinized for hundreds of years, since it was a translation of
their own holy book.

What then caused the later Jewish scholars to decide that it was not
correct?

Well, at least it was sort of translation-related for the most part.
It's hard to keep it that way, though, since there are all kinds of
other highly charged issues involved.

I approach the subject on the premise that the biblical stories are
based on traditions that developed over time, with many different
people involved both before and after the time they were first written
up, and that the relation to actual facts and events is dubious at
best. But not all people have that same detachment. Certainly the
Jewish scholars who decided to make the messiah's mother a virgin had
their own reasons for doing so, but that doesn't make their translation
an accurate rending of almah. It's an interpretation, not a
translation. And that, apparently, is what the book reviewed in the
article is about.
