I am trying to install a six volt new fuel pump to my 55 thunderbird, replacing
the manually operated one. Where is the safest point to wire the positive lead
to without harming anything else? Thank you

The best place to wire in the fuel pump is probably at the switch side of
the starter solenoid, but you should put a switch in between the pump and
whatever power supply lead that you decide to use. Also you might need to
consider speaking to the pump manufacturer about the possibility of putting
a fuse inline also. Just my personal opinion though! Rick Coder.

I would wire it right from the solenoid.. to a 6 volt relay.. that way you wont
have to run the large supply wire to a switch... any electronics repair place
or auto electronics place can supply to with the stuff and how to do it if ya
ask em nicely. and with using a good relay you are not gonna have any voltage
drop that you get when running a long power wire to the dash and then back to
the pump... Also you can use a smaller switch or even tie it into a switched
power source on your ignition switch or fuse panel.. and yes always put a fuse
inline...

I agree, Most pumps like to be installed close to the tank. I would do that
and then pull a nice heavy guage wire down the frame to the source (for
power) and install a fuse to protect it. The time you spend soldering all
your wire connections is well worth the effort. More so as you applications
pull more current! Good luck.

Well, all the people that posted replies had good ideas, but there's also
this one.....

You have a wreck, and then there's this *little tiny spark* under the hood
there, and now you're kinda sideways, and the ignition is still on, and the
pump is still pumping twenty five gallons of gas all over you cause the key
is still on, and you can't turn it off for some reason.....

You should wire your fuel pump through a relay that is controlled by the
output/charging wire on your alternator. When the engine stops, the
alternator stops turning, so it stops charging the battery, and the charging
wire looses current, and so shuts off the fuel. Either that or you might be
able to use a tach lead.

Then also, you'd need to wire a switch in that bypasses the relay, so that
you could run the fuel pump by the switch to prime the car for starting
(if the alternator runs the relay, you won't have current till after the
engine starts) , or to test the system, or for other possible needs......

Virtually all modern cars are set up to where if the engine stops so does
the fuel pump. But they have one relay that primes as well as runs the pump,
as well as capabilities to run the pump manually if you want to. One relay
does all the above.

So, however you do it, use a relay......
