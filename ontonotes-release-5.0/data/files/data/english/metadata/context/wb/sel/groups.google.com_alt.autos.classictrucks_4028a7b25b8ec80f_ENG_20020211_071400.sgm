URGENT FEDERAL SCRAPPAGE ALERT

U.S. Senate Bill Would Fund Scrappage Programs Nationwide

A bill (S. 1766), authored by Senators Daschle (D-SD) and Bingaman (D-NM), has
been introduced in the U.S. Senate containing a provision (Section 803) that
would federally fund state scrappage programs for vehicles over 15 years old.
Owners who turn in vehicles for crushing would receive a “minimal” payment
and a future credit toward purchasing a newer vehicle, all in a misguided
attempt to improve the overall fuel economy of the country’s vehicle fleet.
This bill represents the most formidable Federal legislative threat to
specialty aftermarket businesses in years.

Oppose the Use of U.S. Taxpayer Dollars for Scrappage

Section 803 of S. 1766 would unfairly and unjustifiably deny automotive
aftermarket businesses the availability of vintage cars necessary for us to
market our products and services. As a consequence, our efforts to do business
nationwide will be severely hampered.
Section 803 of S. 1766 would give states that don’t currently operate
scrappage programs an extra incentive to create a program due to generous
federal funding.
Section 803 of S. 1766 requires that federally funded state scrappage programs
crush every car. It threatens enthusiasts nationwide with the loss of valuable
parts and parts-cars for repair, restoration, and customization projects.
Section 803 of S. 1766 does not require states to determine the fuel efficiency
of vehicles being scrapped or that scrapped vehicles are being replaced by more
fuel-efficient vehicles
Section 803 of S. 1766 ignores the fact that cars turned in for scrappage often
barely run or are rarely driven second or third vehicles that have a minimal
impact on overall fuel economy.
Section 803 of S. 1766 will diminish the availability of affordable
transportation and repair parts to low-income drivers as more and more older
cars are crushed.
Section 803 of S. 1766 does not guarantee that low-income individuals will be
able to afford to purchase new vehicles – let alone more fuel-efficient
vehicles – with the money provided by scrappage programs.
Section 803 of S. 1766 ignores more socially responsible and cost-effective
policy options like voluntary vehicle repair and upgrade programs that maximize
the fuel efficiency of existing vehicles.

There ain't enough cash in the budget to refund everyone here in
Arkansas if they gave us money for our old trucks.... and how would we
*move* about?

Garry,

First off, the United States is a republic, not a democracy. The difference
is huge.

Second, what data is there that shows that your sensitive lungs are being
harmed? There is no such data. This is yet more legislation (by the
democrats) to act like they're cleaning up the environment, spend money, and
in the end not make any improvements. But as long as there's people like
you, Garry, there will be these bills in the house to distract the American
people from the important issues facing the nation.

As for protecting me from boneyards where's there's all these great old
parts to be found, Senator Daschle, don't do me any favors.

Regards,

CJ Loeffelholz

For Christ sake, I can't believe this &quot;law&quot; is resurfacing again. This was
brought up in Cal about 5 years ago and it was defeated in the house of
reps. I am not in any fear of have my '67 GMC crushed. Nether should anyone
else. Besides, the ratio of old &quot;smoggy&quot; cars &amp; trucks is so lopsided it's
laughable.

with their time. Senators...They can all nurse me as far as I am
concerned. Between this type of crap and the overally anal retentive
smog testing we are now stuck with here in Houston, I've come to the
conclusion that all you need to be a senator is strong case of
&quot;dumbass of the brain&quot;. If you were to operate on on of these
goofballs, you would find that instead of grey matter, their craniums
are filled with old dried up fecal matter. Minimal payment my

to swap. MK

"/> Dear genius -

Participation in the program would be *voluntary*. According to the words you
quoted from the original posting, they're not forcing you to do anything
whatever. They would be making *offers* to buy old vehicles and take them off
your hands. You could choose to sell, or not. Obviously, for the program to
work, the offer to you would have to be for more than the truck is worth on
the open market.

Getting unexpected cash for old vehicles would be a bad thing?

There are a *lot* of trucks out there that are never going to attain
&quot;classic&quot; status... the program, if it ever came to pass, would just scavenge
the derelictmobiles. That's certainly all the government can afford. Classics
will still exist. As for the fears of the &quot;aftermarket businesses&quot;: it's true
that the current bill requires that the vehicle be &quot;operational&quot; when turned
in. They ought to change that, to permit useful parts to be removed before
final scrapping.

Whether the bill is a good use of tax money is another question. California
here gets rid of the polluting vehicles by edict. No tax money required at
all. If it belches, and you can't fix it, you can't drive it here. No choice.
Very cheap for the state. I've owned classics that were *barely* able to
&quot;pass smog&quot;, even at the end of a complete rebuild, professionally done.
Perhaps you would all prefer that Senator Daschle take that approach - the
edict approach - rather the offer-to-buy-it approach?

Garry

PS - If you want to see what the proposal really says, go to
http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c107:S.1766:  and scroll down to section
803. Warning, it's a big download.

PPS - Note to Corey re the word &quot;democracy&quot;: under the net.pedantic
definition of the word, no true &quot;democracy&quot; exists, has ever existed in the
history of the world, or probably ever will exist. That makes the word kind
of useless. I prefer to use the common-American definition of the word,
rather than the pedantic definition.

PPPS - Note to whoever made reference to the nationality of my vehicles: I
buy from whoever builds the best stuff. Sometimes that has even been an
American company. My first Plymouth was a gem.
