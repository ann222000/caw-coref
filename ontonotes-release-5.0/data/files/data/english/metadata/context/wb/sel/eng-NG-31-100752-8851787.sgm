Was he told to eat less salt or sodium?  If so, I don't think there is any
salt that is better for him than another.

There is a cardiology newsgroup but it is run by a quack.

I eat Real Salt.  It's a sea salt and it tastes really good.  I have the
Himalyan salt.  Use it for bathing but haven't tried eating it.

I heard that regular salt is bad for anyone.  I've recently switched to
sea salt, and I like it too.  I'll never go back to regular table salt.
I heard that table salt is the same price as it was for the last 100
years.  Don't know if that's true or not, but if it is, maybe there is
some truth to it being bad for you.  Your response was incredibly
fast...like 10 seconds   :-)   Thanks for your advice.  I don't have
diabetes, but I know a few of people that do.  Seems like as long as you
take care of yourself your life is pretty much the same as everyone
else.  I came on this web site because I knew someone would know the
answer to my question  ..thanx Julie

I use a potassium salt instead of the normal sodium salts.  In addition
to it not raising my blood pressure, it helps with my potassium
deficiency (your friend's father may wind up needing potassium
supplements depending on what type of medications he is given for his
heart problem).

My DH has congestive heart failure. I have problems retaining fluids
when I have too much salt, We use Salt Sense. Here is a link:

http://www.cargillsalt.com/food/dc_salt_food_senseplainiod.htm

I use very little when cooking and both of us don't use salt at the
table. What we do use is the Salt Sense. It's hard to find in my area so
my kids send me a box when I need it. Usually a box will last two or
more years.

I also use potassium salt, in an attempt to minimise night

cooking.

I don't know Alan.  Just heard that salt isn't good for you.  Lot's of
web sites out there to back it up, but I'm no scientist.  They'll soon
find some evidence that they made a mistake and that regular salt is
good for you after all, and that sea salt causes cancer....  :-)

Bobby, salt is salt, no matter what you call it. If your father is
salt/sodium sensitive and been advised to lower salt intake then I am afraid
using sea salt won't make a scrap of difference. It all comes from the sea.
He may have to learn to like less salty things

As best I can tell they are both 97% sodium chloride and
whether there is any tangible difference may depend on where
you are. For example, my local table salt is from
evaporative seabeds anyway; the only difference is in size
of the grains and packaging. Yours may be from mines. The
significant chemical differences would be in that final 3%,
if any, and considering the quantity of salt you would
normally use in your diet that should be just about
meaningless.

Before I started using potassium salt (sparingly) for
cramps, I had changed my menu to not use any added salt at
all in my cooking or at the table.

That's a long-winded way of saying I don't think &quot;sea-salt&quot;
is likely to be any healthier, or less unhealthy, than table
salt.

Good point.  There are, however, other materials that are removed in the
refining process, are there not?  They may provide some benefit I
suppose.

The bottom line, though, is that NaCl is NaCl.

I don't know if his group is moderated or not.  But you know who I am

&quot;Regular&quot; salt such as Morton's has something added to it to keep it from
clumping.  Not sure what that is, but some people would consider it to be
bad for you.

I find I am very salt sensitive.  For some odd reason kosher salt does not
make me retain fluid, but regular iodized salt definitely does.   That may
be because koser salt has nothing in it BUT salt.   It also tastes better,
which is why all the top chefs specify to use it.
