NOTE:  Hats off to these activists below who've taken 9/11 Truth (and
other truths) literally into their own hands and have progressed
full-circle through various corporate media and now back to the
venerable Oral Tradition with face-to-face challenges of those with
the power to act.  Hats off also to the 9/11 Truth Movement in general
for their successes this year in reaching more and more mainstreamers.

Reply-To: 911TruthAct ... @yahoogroups.com

DC has been through 8 days of events. It has been a whirlwind. Two
were lobby days as taught by Col. Bob Bowman. DC911truth is making
lobby packs and will assist anyone wanting to come to DC to lobby
Congress.

We cover four points. The war, rights, impeachment and lastly the
911 cover-up. We can't just go in wanting 911 dealt with. We have to
move with ease to the subject. Bob Bowman made a 3-minute
documentary of WTC7 and the BBC announcement while it was still
standing. We either show it to the reps or we leave it with them if
we think they will watch. The Virginia group first went to Frank
Wolf (an old republican) and we got into his private office with two
staffers. We had a great discussion and were able to show them the 3-
minute doc. It worked, they were surprised and I could tell
genuinely so. We also left them with a 4-doc dvd. I'm hoping it got
viewed. I know we had an interest. We stayed for 45 minutes which
caused us to miss the Tom Davis meeting. We probably could have
stayed longer but we didn't want saturation.

We then went to Jim Moran's office (he voted against war) and were
able to bring up the 911 cover-up and leave the dvd. As we left, I
looked
back and saw his two staffers go into a huddle and the younger one
looked frightened. They know what we are asking for and they know we
are not going away.

The Maryland contingency also got the dvd seen.

We then took Bob Bowman to see our Virginia Senators (Warner and
Webb). We met with staffers in one room together. That was tougher
but they were taken back with Bob Bowman. They too know we are not
going away and we did leave the short doc with Webb's staffer.

The plan is to get into more congressional offices and bring these
people to the 911 coverup. If anyone would like to come to DC
someone from DC911truth will accompany them and we will give you the
talking points to build on. Bob also got us a ride in the subway
underneath the capitol which is for insiders. You know he ran for
Congress in Florida on 911 truth and got 45% of the vote.

What we learned by our training with Bob is to go for the cover-up.
Expose that to Congress. They aren't ready for the hows or the
whos. Just why is it being covered up.

The lobby packet will be tightened up and ready for anyone to use.
The congressional people realized we are not nuts. We are good
citizens on a mission.

We got good FM radio time too. And now for some down time.

This looks good and I was approached about showing some 911 films
during the encampment. http://www.troopsoutnow.org so we will be
doing some outreach here. The powers really want the peace and 911
movement separated. That is changing.

p.s. yesterday I met a retired couple at the march from Carlyle PA
who wanted a documentary. They said that people there are more
interested in the truth about 911 than in the war. I was surprised
with the war college being there. The military had better wake up
because this crime is costing them the most.

Flood Misery Hits Arc of Africa

An estimated one million people across Africa have been hit by
prolonged rains which have destroyed crops, burst dams and left dozens
dead, officials say.

Parts of Ghana have been declared a disaster zone, while on the other
side of the continent, many thousands are now homeless in Ethiopia and
Uganda.

The UN said the floods could lead to locust infestations and
outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as cholera.

The flooding and torrential rain have brought chaos to at least 14
countries.

UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs spokeswoman
Elisabeth Byrs said 500,000 people had been affected in West Africa
and a further 500,000 in Sudan, and the numbers were rising.

Health charities have warned that many areas are in urgent need of
food, shelter and medicine.

The BBC's Adam Mynott says not a single country in West, Central and
East Africa has been unaffected by the torrential rain.

'Dire' situation

In Uganda, where at least nine people are reported to have died,
government minister Musa Ecweru said the situation &quot;borders a crisis&quot;.

&quot;Several communities have been cut off and we cannot access them,&quot; he
said.

In Ethiopia, one of the worst-hit east African nations, deaths have
been reported and a massive food aid programme has been set up after
flooding hit almost 200,000 people.

In West Africa, Ghana has been hit particularly hard, with at least
20 people killed and about 400,000 people made homeless.

The floods have submerged land which produces food for the entire
country.

President John Kufuor has declared the north of his country a
disaster zone.

George Azi Amoo, co-ordinator of Ghana's disaster management body,
told the BBC: &quot;Some villages and communities have now been totally
wiped off the map of Ghana.&quot;

He said food and clothing were being distributed, and that the
country's small navy had sent two boats to help ferry people to safety.

It is feared that outbreaks of diseases such as cholera are likely
due to the contamination of the water supply.

In neighbouring Togo some 34,000 people have been displaced, at least
20 killed and the infrastructure has suffered major damage.

Officials in northern Rwanda said 15 people had died there and 500
homes had been destroyed since Wednesday.

Dozens are also reported dead in Sudan, which has been suffering some
of the worst floods in living memory.

Kenyan government spokesman Alfred Mutua told the AFP news agency:
&quot;We have activated our disaster response and the government and aid
groups are providing food, shelter and medicine to those affected by
the floods.&quot;

Niger, Nigeria, Liberia, Mali and Burkino Faso are among other
countries affected.

Subject: [bluegreenearth]  fwd: Australia - Drought, oil send food
prices soaring

Drought, Oil Send Food Prices Soaring

Asa Wahlquist, Rural writer | September 15, 2007

IT'S called agflation and it's coming very soon, propelled by climate
change
and drought.

Grain prices have hit record levels, and those prices will ramify
through
the feed chain - beef, dairy, pork, eggs and chicken -- and reach
consumers.

The nation's food bowl, the Murray-Darling basin, does not have
enough water
in the system to keep 150,000ha of citrus, apples, pears, apricots,
plums,
cherries, table grapes and winegrapes alive, let alone in production.

Fruit production in the basin is worth more than $1.5 billion and
accounts
for 60 per cent of Australian-grown fruit.

Australian Horticulture Council chief executive Kris Newton says the
severe
cutback in irrigation water could result in price rises, as seen with
bananas after Cyclone Larry.

&quot;But that will be across all the commodities,&quot; Ms Newton said.

&quot;We are facing a disaster unprecedented in Australian history. I
can't think
of anything in agriculture that comes even close.&quot;

Dairy prices are skyrocketing, too, although that is little comfort for
those farmers having to pay high grain prices.

Australian Dairy Farmers policy director Robert Poole says
agriculture is
going through its most profound change in modern history.

&quot;The whole oil price, climate change, food for fuel scenario -- that has
changed the world forever,&quot; Mr Poole said.

&quot;The linking of agriculture land and its use to the price of energy,
in the
medium to long term, will radically change the way the world works.

&quot;We will see land use change, which will change the supply pattern of
all
products, including dairy products. We will see the run-down of
stocks, we
will see the increasing of food prices. It will bring the issue of food
security back on to the table.&quot;

Those with good wheat crops, and there are patches in most states, or
dairy
farmers in coastal areas where there has been good rain will have a very
good year. But the dry winter over the Murray-Darling basin has withered
crops and forced intensive livestock farmers into the rising grain
market.

In June, ABARE forecast a 22.5 million tonne wheat crop -- if there were
normal conditions. There weren't. The next forecast is out on
Tuesday, and
will probably be between 14 and 19 million tonnes.

Grain prices are rising due to increased demand from the biofuel sector,
along with a series of weather events leading to crop failures this
year,
which have resulted in world grain stocks being at a 30-year low.

Australian Lotfeeders Association president Malcolm Foster has been
campaigning against mandated ethanol in petrol.

&quot;It is putting extreme pressure on the world grain prices, because of
what
the US has done,&quot; Mr Fraser said.

&quot;Our concern was Australia would do it and put pressure on Australian
prices, but it is happening in the US anyway. The impact is going to be
quite severe on food prices around the world.&quot;

Along the Murray River, irrigation allocations have been slashed. On
the NSW
side of the Murray they are zero, on the Victorian side 5 per cent,
and in
South Australia 13 per cent, rising to 16 per cent next month. Only
on the
Murrumbidgee do growers have enough water to survive, with 60 per
cent of
high-security allocations.

Ms Newton said around 48 per cent of normal allocation was &quot;required to
simply keep them alive -- not produce a crop, just keep them alive --
and we
are not going to get that, with the exception of the MIA (Murrumbidgee)&quot;.

She said that, even with above-average spring rains, &quot;there is not
going to
be enough. Basically between now and Christmas they will die&quot;.

Blair Trewin from the National Climate Centre says 2007 has been the
worst
post-drought year on record.

&quot;Not only was 2006 a severe drought year, but 2007 in many areas is
unprecedentedly poor.&quot;

Dr Trewin says climate change, particularly rising temperatures, has
made
climate forecasting more difficult.

&quot;Our outlooks are based on historical relationships between sea surface
temperatures and rainfall and temperatures,&quot; he says. &quot;We are not as
confident as we once were that those relationships are still stable.&quot;

He says there are signs a La Nina is developing, although it is late.
&quot;There
is still hope for decent rainfall, particularly in the summer rainfall
areas,&quot; Dr Trewin said.

Ms Newton points out that horticulture is a huge employer in the
regions, in
food processing, winemaking, farm and irrigation services, transport and
even wine and food tourism.

Dairy also has a big multiplier effect. Milk production since the
drought
began in 2002 is down by nearly 2 billion litres. Mr Poole estimates
that
has cost &quot;about 15,000 jobs and approximately $3 billion to the economy&quot;.

Australian Farm Institute executive director Mick Keogh says: &quot;The thing
that scares me this time is when you add the widespread nature of the
drought to the lack of water.

&quot;There is not a sector of agriculture, with perhaps the exception of
some of
the coastal fruit and vegie and the northern beef industry, that are
missing
out. I can't recall that sort of widespread impact before.&quot;

The grain industry is full of rumours about grain growers, new to
hedging,
being badly caught out.

Risk management consultant with regional NSW company MarketAg, Colin
Lethbridge, explained that &quot;because AWB hasn't been there, growers
have had
to do their hedging themselves this year&quot;.

Many locked in a prudent one-third of their crop at the beginning of the
season at what were very good prices. Then prices soared and the crop
failed.

&quot;Now they are facing a $US120 to $US150 loss a tonne. They might have
sold
forwards only 1000 tonnes, but that is $US150,000 which is perhaps
$200,000
on top of your input costs. There are a lot of blokes around here who
are
still short and who may lose a property,&quot; Mr Lethbridge said.

Ms Newton is worried that if permanent plantings die, many farmers
will not
be in a position to replant. The average farmer is over 55, &quot;and you
have to
wait eight to 10 years (for income), assuming you have the confidence to
replant, or you can afford to&quot;.

&quot;People are going to throw their hands up and go, 'well that's it, I'm
out',&quot; she said.

Ms Newton says many of the best operators, and the most innovative,
will be
the hardest hit. The most water efficient, computer-controlled method of
growing fruit trees results in a dense root ball.
&quot;The intention is to reduce the amount of water it needs, but it
means it
has no deep tap roots so the moment irrigation goes off and there is
no rain
they will die in about two weeks.

&quot;Most of these people are extremely efficient farmers. We are not
talking
about the marginal or the vulnerable who may have been caught up in the
drought.&quot;

Ms Newton says the effect of the dry will be felt in the cities.
&quot;Whether it
is in the hip-pocket nerve, whether it is in terms of unemployment in
regional communities, it will be felt across the nation,&quot; she said.

Mr Keogh said: &quot;I don't think anyone in their wildest dreams would have
imagined a problem on this scale.&quot;

Petraeus will press Gordon Brown to increase the number of British
troops patrolling the Iraqi border with Iran when he meets the Prime
Minister this week. The US commander in Iraq wants Britain to move a
significant proportion of the 5,000 troops garrisoned at Basra airport
to cut off the [alleged] smuggling of Iranian weapons to Shia militias.

World should brace for possible war over Iran: France 16 Sep 2007 The
world should brace for a possible war over the Iranian nuclear crisis
but seeking a solution through talks should take priority, French
Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said on Sunday.

Report: US wants war with Iran 16 Sep 2007 The United States
Department of Defense has developed a list of up to 2,000 bombing
targets in Iran, the Sunday Telegraph reported. According to the
report, senior CIA and US defense officials believe that the White
House was taking steps to ensure military confrontation with Iran, for
fear that diplomatic efforts to slow the country's nuclear weapons
program are doomed to fail. According to a senior US intelligence
officer, the escalation to military confrontation could begin with a
public denunciation of Iran's suspected meddling in Iraq, the report said.

US Iran report branded dishonest 14 Sep 2007 The UN nuclear watchdog
has protested to the US government over a report on Iran's nuclear
programme, calling it &quot;erroneous&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot;. In a leaked
letter, the IAEA said a congressional report contained serious
distortions of the agency's own findings on Iran's nuclear activity.

Mystery Trader to Collect on Global Financial Meltdown?

by Paul Joseph Watson

Global Research, September 17, 2007

Prison Planet

A run on the Northern Rock bank in Britain has increased the
possibility that a mystery trader could stand to collect around $2
billion should a panic send markets tumbling during the course of this
week, as investors have predicted.

Last month, we reported on the mystery trader who risks losing around
$1 billion dollars after placing 245,000 put options on the Dow Jones
Eurostoxx 50 index, which led many analysts to speculate that a stock
market crash preceded by a new 9/11 style attack or another
catastrophe could take place before or during the third week of September.

The anonymous trader only stands to make money if the market crashes
by a third to a half before September 21st, which is when the put
options expire.

Following the run on the Northern Rock bank in Britain, specialist
investors are now warning of an imminent and severe correction in the
markets.

&quot;The credit cycle has turned, bad debts are soaring, banks will go
bust and stock markets will fall much further,&quot; Ken Murray, the
founder and chief executive of Blue Planet Investment Management, told
the Financial Times today, shortly after selling half the equities in
his portfolio.

The Northern Rock crisis was followed by Alan Greenspan's warning that
both the US and UK housing markets are on the verge of a major
downturn as Prime Minister Gordon Brown holds an emergency meeting
with US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson today.

Thousands of people around Britain queued for hours at Northern Rock
branches throughout Friday and Saturday attempting to withdraw their
money as the global credit crunch sunk its teeth in again following
the sub-prime mortgage fallout in the US.

Analysts from TheStreet.com dismissed last month's so-called Bin Laden
trades as nothing out of the ordinary, but still noted that the
transactions outstrip anything else seen in a year.

Though the current climate will undoubtedly send stocks tumbling, to
see a downturn of a full third within a week is unlikely bar a
catalyzing outside event like the announcement of military operations
against Iran or a terror attack in the west on the scale of 9/11.

The Mysterious US Option Trade
FN Arena News - September 03 2007

By Greg Peel

It has internet chat rooms absolutely abuzz. It has evoked conspiracy
theory fears of the most frightening nature. But it has not made news
in any of the traditional media outlets. It is, in short, a total mystery.

Last week a transaction was posted in the US SPY options market of an
astonishing US$900 million in value. The SPY (or &quot;spyder&quot; as it is
called) is an exchange-traded fund which replicates the S&amp;P 500 index.
12 million call options ranging in exercise price from 600 to 950 have
been bought/sold (and thus created) by parties unknown. The S&amp;P closed
at 1474 on Friday. The options expire on September 21. This represents
a three-week bet on the market being 35% to 60% lower in that time.

What has the crazier element of the internet chat room fraternity in a
frenzy is a transaction that occurred prior to September, 2001.
Somebody came into the market and bought an extensive number of put
options on US airline stocks. After September 11, those positions
would have booked some US$50 million in profit. Quite sufficient, one
would assume, to cover the cost of certain terrorist activities.

But the reality is that there are so many reasons this option trade
has been transacted, it's impossible to settle on one conclusive
reason. This is why, suggests Keith Fitz-Gerald of Money Morning, the
story has not been published at respected media outlets. There are too
many unknowns, too many rash conclusions to jump to, and no one to
interview.

Among various possibilities, Fitz-Gerald offers four as a
cross-section. Two benign, two sinister.

On the benign side, it could just be a dividend play, popular with
hedge funds. As option instruments don't receive dividend payments
there are plays to be exploited just in the same way traders try to
strip dividends out of the banks and other stocks each season in the
Australian market. Or it could be a &quot;covered call&quot; play. While such
trades usually involve the sale of out-of-the-money calls to enhance
returns on long equity positions, some large funds prefer to operate
within the safety of in-the-money-calls.

On the sinister side, one theory is that China has been caught up in
the subprime mortgage debacle far more extensively than has so far
been disclosed. In the meantime, the Chinese stock market has not
corrected, but continued to rally blissfully on throughout the
turmoil. Could the Chinese government be readying itself to start
dumping US dollars? This would cause havoc in the US stock market and
a profitable offsetting trade for the Chinese.

Or, of course, it could be Osama Bin Laden.

One thing is for sure - this transaction would not have gone unnoticed
by those who should take notice. The US government, amongst many of
its clandestine spook outfits, has a unit colloquially known as the
Plunge Protection Team.

Whatever the reason, this is an unusually large trade at a surprising
level. However, there are just as many simple explanations as there
are conspiratorial ones. Should we be worried? No one has any idea.

British Academics Warn US Is
Preparing &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; Attack on Iran

by Peter Symonds

Global Research, September 15, 2007

wsws.org

An 80-page study written by two British security analysts and released
on August 28 makes a chilling estimation of the overwhelming force
that the US would use in the event of any attack on Iran. &quot;The US has
made military preparations to destroy Iran's WMD, nuclear energy,
regime, armed forces, state apparatus and economic infrastructure
within days, if not hours, of President George W. Bush giving the
order,&quot; the paper declared.

The authors, Dr Dan Plesch and Martin Butcher, concluded on the basis
of publicly available sources that &quot;US bombers and long range missiles
are ready today to destroy 10,000 targets within Iran in a few hours.
US ground, air and marine forces already in the Gulf, Iraq and
Afghanistan can devastate Iranian forces, the regime and the state at
short notice.&quot;

Both Plesch and Butcher have written extensively on security and
international relations. Plesch is director of the Centre for
International Studies and Diplomacy at the prestigious School of
Oriental and African Studies. The study, entitled &quot;Considering a war
with Iran: A discussion paper on WMD in the Middle East&quot; made no
estimate of Iran's nuclear programsthe nominal pretext for a US
warand reached no definitive conclusion as to the likelihood of an
attack. But it did outline the Pentagon's extensive preparations and
examined probable US military strategies.

Plesch and Butcher assessed that any US military attack would not be
limited to Iran's nuclear facilities, but would aim to eliminate its
ability to strike back by destroying its military capacities and
economic infrastructure. &quot;Any attack is likely to be on a massive
multi-front scale but avoiding a ground invasion. Attacks focussed on
WMD facilities would leave Iran too many retaliatory options, leave
President Bush open to the charge of using too little force and leave
the regime intact,&quot; they stated.

The paper examined the Pentagon's Global Strike plans developed under
the Bush administration to enable the US military to strike anywhere
around the world at short notice. Since 2001 in particular, the role
of the US Strategic Command (STRATCOM), previously a nuclear deterrent
against the Soviet Union, has been modified to &quot;enable the seamless
delivery of tailored effects, anywhere and anytime, across the
globe.... The US has strategic forces prepared to launch massive
strikes on Iran within hours of the order being given.&quot;

Plesch and Butcher analysed the available types of US bombers and
conventional bombs and calculated that 100 strategic bombers, each
with 100 &quot;smart&quot; bombs, would be enough to hit 10,000 individual
targets. &quot;This strike power alone is sufficient to destroy all major
Iranian political, military, economic and transport capabilities,&quot; the
authors conclude. &quot;Such a strike would take `shock and awe' to a new
level and leave Iran with few if any conventional military
capabilities to block the straits of Hormuz or provide conventional
military support to insurgents in Iraq.&quot;

The study all but ruled out the US use of nuclear weapons, declaring
that &quot;the human, political and environmental effects would be
devastating, while their military value is limited.&quot; But the authors
did acknowledge &quot;clear evidence that nuclear weapons use [against
Iran] is being given serious political consideration&quot; in the US. And
while stating that a US or British nuclear attack on Iran was &quot;most
unlikely,&quot; Plesch and Butcher did not think it impossible. They
calculated that nearly three million &quot;prompt deaths&quot; would occur in
the event that 300 kilotonne nuclear bombs were dropped on just 11
suspected Iranian WMD sites.

A substantial portion of the paper dealt with the various US options,
using military forces already in place within the region, to counter
Iranian responses to a US attack. &quot;Iran has a weak airforce and
anti-aircraft capability, almost all of it is 20-30 years old and it
lacks modern integrated communications. Not only will these forces be
rapidly destroyed by US air power, but Iranian ground and air forces
will have to fight without protection from air attack,&quot; the authors
stated.

The paper noted the existence of standing US war plans to counter any
blockade of the strategic straits of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, and
to seize the western Iranian province of Khurzestan, where the bulk of
the country's oil production occurs. It detailed the ability of the US
military in neighbouring Iraq and Afghanistan to devastate forces and
bases inside Iran hundreds of kilometres from the border without a
ground invasion. It cited a variety of sources pointing to covert US
operations already taking place inside Iran to identify targets and
foment armed rebellion among ethnic and religious minorities.

Considering the question &quot;how likely is an attack?&quot; the authors
pointed out: &quot;The [US] administration has steadfastly refused to
remove the military option from the table, and has continued to
prepare to go to war. Congress rejected a proposal to require the
president to consult it before going to war with Iran.&quot; The study
cited a number of menacing comments by senior Bush officials this
year, as well as belligerent anti-Iranian statements by Republican and
Democrat presidential candidates. It also noted Congressional moves
for tougher measures against Tehran.

The authors rebutted many of the arguments commonly advanced as
reasons why the US would not launch an attack on Iran. They assessed
the likelihood of a compromise over Iran's nuclear programs as
&quot;extremely remote&quot; as &quot;the United States refuses to offer any form of
security guarantee to Iran, and indeed is actively engaged in attempts
to undermine Iranian authorities.&quot; As to the European Union's attempts
to broker a deal, &quot;privately, and not so privately, senior US
officials ... deride the EU's efforts as futile.&quot;

Responding to those who point out the US military is bogged down in
Iraq and lacks troops, the study stated: &quot;Army overstretch from
long-term deployments in Iraq is a significant problem, but providing
forces for a short duration war (following the pattern of the initial
invasion of Iraq) would be much less of a problem. Iran has little
ability for conventional military attack outside its own territory,
allowing the US considerable scope to sit back and await internal
developments after the type of attacks described in this paper.&quot;

The paper also considers Iran's capacity to retaliate in other ways,
either directly against US allies like Israel and US bases or
indirectly by encouraging unrest among Iraqi Shiites. The authors
regarded such arguments as strengthening the military case for an
overwhelming, rather than limited, US attack. They pointed out that
Iran retained some options for counter-missile strikes and had closely
observed US military operations around its borders. &quot;At the same time,
the US armed forces have been preparing for this contingency for many
years and it would be hard to be the military commander telling
President Bush that Iran is just not `doable.'&quot;

Plesch and Butcher did not make any predictions about a war, but they
did note that the lack of publicity surrounding US military
preparations was no guarantee against a US attack. &quot;US military, if
not political, readiness for a war using minimum ground forces
indicates that the current seeming inaction surrounding Iran is
misleading. The United States retains the abilitydespite difficulties
in Iraqto undertake major military operations against Iran. Whether
the political will exists to follow such a course of action is known
only to a few senior figures in the Bush administration.&quot;

Plesch and Butcher made no attempt to analyse the underlying economic
and strategic reasons for a US attack on Iran or to consider in detail
the potential for it triggering a broader war. Their study in no way
challenged the escalating US propaganda campaign concerning Iran's
alleged nuclear weapons programs. The real motivation for a reckless,
new US war on Iran lies in the Bush administration's attempts to
establish unfettered American dominance in the resource-rich regions
of the Middle East and Central Asia. Any outcome that allows America's
European and Asian rivals to strengthen their influence in these key
regions is simply intolerable to the US ruling elite.

The rather limited scope of the study only makes its conclusion all
the more disturbing: the military preparations that would allow the
Bush administration to reduce much of Iran to rubble at short notice
have already been completed.

project because busting the BOOsch Junta on mere 9/11 negligence
reduces chances of them being busted for engineering the attacks
themselves.  The most likely reason why the response of this Northern

only some of the &quot;documented facts&quot;.  Evidently they were presented

2020Vision Sees Success

The First 9/11 Criminal Investigation has yet to
take place. The 2020Vision campaign to convince
California Attorney General Jerry Brown to file
charges against Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld, et al for
Criminal Negligence in allowing the attacks to happen,
held its kick-off party in the Stinson Beach
Community Center on 9/11/07, the sixth anniversary of
the attacks.
Interest was huge, attendance was far more than
expected and considering the weight given to
handwritten postcards by politicians,  thousands of
citizens want Jerry Brown to make the case. Admit it,
you'd love to see Dick and Ron being grilled on the
witness stand by `Moonbeam' Brown, because of the
murder of 86 California citizens that day.  At  the
very least a California grand jury opened to take
testimony about bringing these charges will be a shot
across the bow of their plans for an endless war.
Don't hesitate, write  a postcard to CA Attorney
General Edmund G. Brown, Jr.. Box 944255, Sacramento
CA 94244 , asking him to bring charges. It may be the
only way to stop Cheney from starting WWIII.
Most informed Americans believe the Bush
administration, specifically Cheney, Rummy and their
henchmen, at the very least allowed the attacks to
happen  to support their agenda for an endless war and
increases in military funding for 'full spectrum
dominance&quot;.  Opposition to their plans felt hopeless,
after a Democratic Congress took impeachment off the
table, while  the Bush administration dragged out the
dead bodies of the victims whenever support for their
War on Terrorism began flagging.
When this focused idea  of  convincing Jerry Brown
to file the first Criminal Investigation of 9/11
emerged from a www.2020Vision.be brainstorming
session,  it  was a ray of hope that  potentially can
pierce the chink in their armor.  Jerry Brown, our
Knight riding out of the west, will be the one to
hoist these hijackers of our nation on their own
petard.
After presenting the documented facts, those
attending unanimously agreed there was sufficient
evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the
charges of Criminal Negligence, rising to the level
of Aiding and Abetting, with Conspiracy to Cover Up
their culpability, against  Cheney, Rumsfeld, et al .
In fact one person believed that Jerry Brown had
already brought these charges, such is the power of
this idea.
Those present agreed that a postcard campaign
asking Jerry Brown to file charges and begin the first
Criminal Investigation of 9/11 was a first step.  We
all filled out a postcard and they were mailed after
the meeting.
The 9/11 Commision detailed many Prior Warnings that
Bin Laden was determined to attack inside the U.S.
with hijacked airplanes. They pointed out deviations
from required protocols and failures to act with due
diligence on  critical measures to prevent the known
threat of al Qaeda hijackers training in the U.S.
VP Cheney was head of the administration
counterterrorism response and SecDef Rumsfeld was the
top of the chain of command for military shoot down
orders. Both were responsible for the failure to
defend against the attacks, with clear dereliction of
duties, yet neither were held to account.
When does negligence become criminal?  When will
those who failed to act with due diligence to prevent
the attacks be held accountable? Will you take the
time to write a postcard to Jerry Brown? This simple
act multiplies your request times hundreds of
citizens.  This may be the best shot we have at
stopping these criminals who've seized control of our
nation.

(4) Key Lockerbie Witness Admits Perjury

Key
Lockerbie Witness Admits Perjury

Prof. Ludwig De Braeckeleer, Global Research, September 15, 2007
http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid;=6786

The Lockerbie Affair has taken yet another extraordinary twist. On
Friday August 31st, I received from Edwin Bollier, head of the
Zurich-based MeBo AG, a copy of a German original of an Affidavit. The
document is dated July 18th 2007 and signed by Ulrich Lumpert who
worked as an electronic engineer at MeBo from 1978 to 1994. I have
scrutinized the document carefully and concluded that I have no reason
to doubt its authenticity or the truthfulness of its content. Lumpert
was a key witness (N0 550) at the Camp Zeist trial, where a three
Judges panel convicted a Libyan citizen of murdering 270 persons who
died in the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie. In his testimony,
Lumpert stated that: &quot;of the 3 pieces of hand-made prototypes MST-13
Timer PC-Boards, the third MST-13 PC-Board was broken and [he] had
thrown it away.&quot;

In his Affidavit, certified by Officer Walter Wieland, Lumpert admits
having committed perjury. &quot;I confirm today on July 18th 2007, that I
stole the third hand-manufactured MST-13 Timer PC-Board consisting of
8 layers of fibre-glass from MEBO Ltd. and gave it without permission
on June 22nd 1989 to a person officially investigating in the
Lockerbie case,&quot; Lumpert wrote. (The identity of the official is
known.) &quot;It did not escape me that the MST-13 fragment shown [at the
Lockerbie trial] on the police photograph No PT/35(b) came from the
non-operational MST-13 prototype PC-board that I had stolen,&quot; Lumpert
added. &quot;I am sorry for the consequences of my silence at that time,
for the innocent Libyan Mr. Abdelbaset Al Megrahi sentenced to life
imprisonment, and for the country of Libya.&quot; In just seven paragraphs,
the Lumpert affidavit elucidates the longstanding mysteries
surrounding the infamous MST-13 timer, which allegedly triggered the
bomb that exploded Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie on December 21st 1988.

The discovery of the MST-13 timer fragment

In the months following the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie,
someone discovered a piece of a grey Slalom-brand shirt in a wooded
area located about 25 miles away from the town. According to a
forensics expert, the cloth contained a tiny fragment - 4 mm square -
of a circuit board. The testimony of three expert witnesses allowed
the prosecutors to link this circuit board, described as part of the
bomb trigger, to Megrahi. There have been different accounts
concerning the discovery of the timer fragment. A police source close
to the investigation reported that it had been discovered by lovers.
Some have said that it was picked up by a man walking his dog. Others
have claimed that it was found by a policeman &quot;combing the ground on
his hands and knees.&quot; At the trial, the third explanation became
official. &quot;On 13 January 1989, DC Gilchrist and DC McColm were engaged
together in line searches in an area near Newcastleton. A piece of
charred material was found by them which was given the police number
PI/995 and which subsequently became label 168.&quot;

The alteration of the label

The officer had initially labelled the bag 'cloth (charred)' but had
later overwritten the word 'cloth' with 'debris'. The bag contained
pieces of a shirt collar and fragments of materials said to have been
extracted from it, including the tiny piece of circuit board
identified as coming from an MST-13 timer made by the Swiss firm MeBo.
&quot;The original inscription on the label, which we are satisfied, was
written by DC Gilchrist, was &quot;Cloth (charred)&quot;. The word `cloth' has
been overwritten by the word `debris'. There was no satisfactory
explanation as to why this was done.&quot; The judges said in their
judgement that Gilchrist's evidence had been &quot;at worst evasive and at
best confusing&quot;. Yet the judges went on to admit the evidence. &quot;We
are, however, satisfied that this item was indeed found in the area
described, and DC McColm who corroborated DC Gilchrist on the finding
of the item was not cross-examined about the detail of the finding of
this item.&quot; It has long been rumoured that a senior former Scottish
officer, who has worked at the highest level of the Lockerbie inquiry,
has signed a statement in which he claims that evidence has been
planted. UK media have confirmed the story. Thus, the Scottish officer
has confirmed an allegation previously made by a former CIA agent. The
identity of the officer remains secret and he is only known as
&quot;Golfer&quot;. &quot;Golfer&quot; has told Megrahi's legal team that Gilchrist had
told him that he had not been responsible for changing the label.

The new page 51

According to documents obtained by the Scotland on Sunday, the entry
of the discovery is recorded at widely different times by UK and
German investigators. Moreover, a new page 51 has been inserted in the
record of evidence. During the Lockerbie investigation, Dr Thomas
Hayes and Allan Feraday were working at the DERA Forensic laboratory
at Fort Halstead in Kent. Dr Hayes was employed at the Royal Armament
Research Development Establishment (RARDE). In 1995, RARDE was
subsumed into the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). In
2001, part of DERA became the Defence Science and Technology
Laboratory (DSTL). Dr Hayes testified that he collected the tiny
fragment of the circuit board on May 12th 1989. He testified that the
fragment was green. (Keep in mind that the board stolen from Lumpert
is brown.) His colleague, Alan Feraday, confirmed his story at the
Zeist trial. The record is inserted on a loose-leaf page with the five
subsequent pages re-numbered by hand. Dr Hayes could not provide a
reasonable explanation for this rather strange entry, and yet the
Judges concluded that: &quot;Pagination was of no materiality, because each
item that was examined had the date of examination incorporated into
the notes.&quot; The argument of the Court is illogical as the index number
Dr Hayes gave to the piece is higher than some entry he made three
months later. And there is more. In September 1989, Feraday sent a
Polaroid photograph of the piece and wrote in the attached memorandum
that it was &quot;the best he could do in such short time.&quot; So, are we
supposed to believe that it takes forensic experts several months to
take a Polaroid picture? Dr Hayes could not explain this. He merely
suggested that the person to ask about it would be the author of the
memorandum, Mr Feraday. This however was not done. At the young age of
43, Hayes resigned just a few months after the discovery of the timer
fragment. Based on the forensic Dr Hayes had supplied, an entire
family [The Maguire seven] was sent to jail in 1976. They were
acquitted in appeal in 1992. Sir john May was appointed to review Dr.
Hayes forensic evidence. &quot;The whole scientific basis on which the
prosecution in [the trial of the alleged IRA Maguire Seven] was
founded was in truth so vitiated that on this basis alone, the Court
of Appeal should be invited to set aside the conviction,&quot; said Sir
John May. In the Megrahi case, Dr Hayes did not even perform the basic
test which would have established the presence of explosive residue on
the sample. During the trial, he maintained that the fragment was too
small while it is factually established that his laboratory has
performed such test on smaller samples. Had he performed such test, no
residue would have been found. As noted by Lumpert, the fragment shown
at the Zeist trial belongs to a timer that was never connected to a
relay. In other words, that timer never triggered a bomb. Dr Alan
Feraday's reputation is hardly better. In three separated cases,where
men were convicted on the basis of his forensic evidence, the initial
ruling was overturned in appeal. After one of these cases in 2005, a
Lord of Justice said that Feraday should not be allowed to present
himself as an expert in the field of electronics. According to
forensic scientist, Dr Michael Scott, who was interviewed in the
documentary The Maltese Double Cross  Lockerbie, Feraday has no
formal qualifications as a scientist.

The identification of the MeBo timer

Thomas Thurman worked for the FBI forensics laboratory in the late
80's and most of the 90's. Thurman has been publicly credited for
identifying the fragment as part of a MST-13 timer produced by the
Swiss company Mebo. &quot;When that identification was made, of the timer,
I knew that we had it,&quot; Thurman told ABC in 1991. &quot;Absolute,
positively euphoria. I was on cloud nine.&quot; Again, his record is far
from pristine. The US Attorney General has accused him of having
altered lab reports in a way that rendered subsequent prosecutions all
but impossible. He has been transferred out the FBI forensic
laboratory. &quot;He's very aggressive, but I think he made some mistakes
that needed to be brought to the attention of FBI management,&quot; says
Frederic Whitehurst, a former FBI chemist who filed the complaints
that led to the Inspector General's report. &quot;We're not necessarily
going to get the truth out of what we're doing here,&quot; Whitehurst
concluded. The story shed some light on his formation. The report says
&quot;Williams and Thurman merit special censure for their work. It
recommends that Thurman, who has a degree in political science, be
reassigned outside the lab and that only scientists work in its
explosives section.&quot; And the legal experts were just as fake as their
scientific counterparts. In late 1998, Glasgow University set up the
Lockerbie Trial Briefing Unit [LTBU] to provide impartial advice to
the world media on the legal aspects of the complex and unique trial.
Andrew Fulton, a British diplomat, was appointed as a visiting law
professor to head the Unit. Fulton has no legal experience whatsoever.
Prior to his appointment as head of LTBU, Fulton was MI6 station chief
in Washington DC.

The modification of the MST-13 timer fragment

Forensic analysis of the circuit board fragment allowed the
investigators to identify its origin. The timer, known as MST-13, is
fabricated by a Swiss Company named MeBo, which stands for Meister and
Bollier. The company has indeed sold about 20 MST-13 timers to Libyan
military (machine-made 9 ply green boards), as well as a few units
(hand-made 8 ply brown boards) to a Research Institute in Bernau,
known to act as a front to the Stasi, the former East German secret
police. The two batches are very different but, as early as 1991,
Bollier told the Scottish investigators that he could not identify the
timer from a photograph alone. Yet, the Libyans were indicted in
November 1991, without ever allowing Bollier to see the actual
fragment, on the ground that the integrity of the evidence had to be
protected. But in 1998, Bollier obtained a copy of a blown-up
photograph that Thurman had shown on ABC in 1991. Bollier could tell
from certain characteristics that the fragment was part of a board of
the timers made for East Germany, and definitely not one of the timers
delivered by him to Libya. In September 1999, Bollier was finally
allowed to see the fragment. Unlike the one shown by Thurman on ABC,
this one was machine-made, as the one sold to Libya. But, from the
absence of traces of solder, it was obvious that the timer had never
been used to trigger a bomb. &quot;As far as I'm concerned, and I told this
to [Scottish Prosecutor Miriam Watson], this is a manufactured
fragment,&quot; Bollier says. &quot;A fabricated fragment, never from a
complete, functional timer&quot; The next day, Bollier was shown the
fragment once more. You may have already guessed that it now had the
soldering traces. &quot;It was different. I'm not crazy. It was different!&quot;
says Bollier. Finally, at the trial, Bollier was presented a fragment
of a circuit board completely burnt down. Thus, it was no longer
possible to identify to which country that timer had been delivered.
As he requested to explain the significance of the issue, Lord
Shuterland told him that his request was denied. How did the Judges
account for all the mysterious changes in the appearance of the
fragment? They simply dismissed Bollier as an unreliable witness. &quot;We
have assessed carefully the evidence of these three witnesses about
the activities of MEBO, and in particular their evidence relating to
the MST-13 timers which the company made. All three, and notably Mr
Bollier, were shown to be unreliable witnesses. Earlier statements
which they made to the police and judicial authorities were at times
in conflict with each other, and with the evidence they gave in court.
On some occasions, particularly in the case of Mr Bollier, their
evidence was self contradictory.&quot; (' 45)

A scenario implausible on its face

&quot;The evidence which we have considered up to this stage satisfies us
beyond reasonable doubt that the cause of the disaster was the
explosion of an improvised explosive device, [] and that the
initiation of the explosion was triggered by the use of an MST-13
timer,&quot; wrote the three Judges. (' 15) Lockerbie experts, such former
CIA Robert Baer, have suspected that the MST-13 timer could have been
given by the Stasi to the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine  General Command [PFLP-GC], a terrorist group based in
Syria, funded by Iran, and led by Ahmed Jibril. The allegation
deserves attention as it is well known that the two organizations had
strong ties. Moreover, the archives of the Stasi reveal that agency
had infiltrated the Swedish government and it is well documented that
Jibril's close collaborators were operating from Sweden. Yet, I never
believed for a moment that the Lockerbie bomb had been triggered by a
timer. No terrorist would ever attempt to bomb an airliner with a
timer triggered bomb, and definitely not during the winter season, let
alone Christmas time, where the time tables are absolutely useless as
delays are the norm rather than the exception. Don't take my word for
it. Terrorists such Ahmed Jibril and counter-terrorists such Noel Koch
have stated that much. &quot;Explosives linked to an air pressure gauge,
which would have detonated when the plane reached a certain altitude,
or to a timer, would have been ineffective,&quot; Jibril said. &quot;I know all
about the science of explosives. I am an engineer of explosives. I
will argue this with any expert, that the bomb went on board in
London. I do not think the Libyans had anything to do with this.&quot; Noel
Koch headed the US Defence Anti-Terrorism Department from 1981 to
1986. Koch ridiculed the idea that terrorists would gamble on the
likelihood that an unaccompanied luggage would be successfully
transferred twice, first from Malta to Frankfurt, and then from
Frankfurt to London. &quot;I can tell you this much that I know about
terrorism: it's simple,&quot; Koch says. &quot;You don't complicate life. Life's
complicated enough as it is. If you've got a target you want to get as
close as you can to it and you don't go through a series of
permutations that provide opportunities for failure and that provide
opportunities for discovery. It doesn't work that way.&quot;

The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission

On November 13th 1991, two Libyans were indicted for the murder of 270
people who died in the Lockerbie bombing. The indictment was the
outcome of a three year US-UK joint investigation. Although Libya
never acknowledged a responsibility in the matter, a decade long UN
sanctions forced Colonel Gaddafi to hand over the two men accused of
the worst act of terrorism in the UK. On April 5th 1999, they were
transferred to Camp Zeist in the Netherlands where they were judged
under Scottish Law. On January 31st 2001, a panel of three Scottish
Judges acquitted one of them. They convicted the other for murder and
sentenced him to life. Megrahi is serving his sentence in a prison
near Glasgow. Megrahi's appeal was rejected on March 14th 2002. The
European Court Of Human Rights declared his application inadmissible
in July 2003. In September 2003, he applied to the Scottish Criminal
Cases Review Commission [SCCRC] for a legal review of his conviction.
His request was based on the legal test contained in section 106 (3)
(b) of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. The provision
states that an appeal may be made against &quot;any alleged miscarriage of
justice, which may include such a miscarriage based on  the jury's
having returned a verdict which no reasonable jury, properly directed,
could have returned.&quot; On June 28th 2007, the SCCRC has decided to
grant Megrahi a second appeal and to refer his case to the High Court.
An impressive 800 pages long document, stating the reasons for the
decision, has been sent to the High Court, the applicant, his
solicitor, and Crown Office. Although the document is not available to
the public, the Commission has decided &quot;to provide a fuller news
release than normal.&quot; Is it too much to ask why the &quot;fuller news
release than normal&quot; lists only four of the six grounds that justify
the Commission conclusion that a miscarriage of justice might have
occurred? As recently pointed out by Dr. Hans Koechler, who was an
international observer appointed by the United Nations at the
Lockerbie trial, we may also wonder &quot;why a supposedly independent
judicial review body [the SCCRC] would try to exonerate 'preventively'
officials in a case which is being returned to the High Court for a
second appeal because of suspicions of a miscarriage of justice.&quot;
Indeed, the SCCRC's statement: &quot;The Commission undertook extensive
enquiries in this area but found nothing to support that allegation or
to undermine the trial court's conclusions in respect of the fragment
[of the MST-13 MeBo timer]&quot; is rather difficult to justify.

Towards a criminal investigation ?

Dr Jim Swire, who lost his daughter in the tragedy, describes the
ruling of Megrahi as the most disgraceful miscarriages of justice in
history, blaming both the Scottish legal system and US intelligence.
&quot;The Americans played their role in the investigation and influenced
the prosecution,&quot; Swire told the Scotsman Newspaper. Top level UK
diplomats tend to agree with him, such Oliver Miles, a former British
ambassador to Libya. &quot;No court is likely get to the truth, now that
various intelligence agencies have had the opportunity to corrupt the
evidence,&quot; Miles told the BBC. The spectacular decision of the SCCRC
is certain to give a second life to the dozen of alternative theories
of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Nearly two decades later, the
case is back to square one.

Back to square one

Let us give Lord Sutherland, Lord Coulsfield and Lord Maclean some
credit. After hearing 230 witnesses and studying 621 exhibits during
84 days of evidence, spread over eight months, the three judges of the
Lockerbie trial almost got correctly the date of the worst act of
terror in the UK. In the first line of the first paragraph of the most
expensive verdict in history (#80m), they wrote: &quot;At 1903 hours on 22
December 1988 Pan Am flight 103 fell out of the sky.&quot; As a matter of
fact, Pan Am Flight 103 exploded on December 21st 1988. Michael Scharf
is an international law expert at Case Western Reserve University in
Ohio. Scharf joined the State Department's Office of the Legal Adviser
for Law Enforcement and Intelligence in April 1989. He was also
responsible for drawing up the UN Security Council resolutions that
imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992. &quot;It was a trial where everybody
agreed ahead of time that they were just going to focus on these two
guys, and they were the fall guys,&quot; Sharf wrote. &quot;The CIA and the FBI
kept the State Department in the dark. It worked for them for us to be
fully committed to the theory that Libya was responsible. I helped the
counter-terrorism bureau draft documents that described why we thought
Libya was responsible, but these were not based on seeing a lot of
evidence, but rather on representations from the CIA and FBI and the
Department of Justice about what the case would prove and did prove.
It was largely based on this inside guy [Libyan defector Abdul Majid
Giaka]. It wasn't until the trial that I learned this guy was a
nut-job and that the CIA had absolutely no confidence in him and that
they knew he was a liar.&quot;

The magic luggage

According to the Lockerbie verdict, the bomb was hidden in a Toshiba
Radio, wrapped in clothes, located in a luggage that was mysteriously
boarded in Malta. The Court has examined this allegation in depth and
the matter occupies 24 paragraphs of the final verdict (' 16 to ' 34).
After reviewing all the evidence and testimonies, the three judges
came to the following conclusions. &quot;Luqa airport had a relatively
elaborate security system. All items of baggage checked in were
entered into the airport computer as well as being noted on the
passenger's ticket. After the baggage had passed the sniffer check, it
was placed on a trolley in the baggage area to wait until the flight
was ready for loading. When the flight was ready, the baggage was
taken out and loaded, and the head loader was required to count the
items placed on board. The ramp dispatcher, the airport official on
the tarmac responsible for the departure of the flight, was in touch
by radio-telephone with the load control office. The load control had
access to the computer and after the flight was closed would notify
the ramp dispatcher of the number of items checked in. The ramp
dispatcher would also be told by the head loader how many items had
been loaded and if there was a discrepancy would take steps to resolve
it. In addition to the baggage reconciliation procedure, there was a
triple count of the number of passengers boarding a departing flight,
that is there was a count of the boarding cards, a count by
immigration officers of the number of immigration cards handed in, and
a head count by the crew. The records relating to KM180 on 21 December
1988 show no discrepancy in respect of baggage. The flight log
(production 930) shows that fifty-five items of baggage were loaded,
corresponding to fifty-five on the load plan. On the face of them,
these arrangements seem to make it extremely difficult for an
unaccompanied and unidentified bag to be shipped on a flight out of
Luqa. If therefore the unaccompanied bag was launched from Luqa, the
method by which that was done is not established, and the Crown
accepted that they could not point to any specific route by which the
primary suitcase could have been loaded. The absence of any
explanation of the method by which the primary suitcase might have
been placed on board KM180 is a major difficulty for the Crown case.&quot;
An internal 1989 FBI memo indicates that there is no indication that
an unaccompanied luggage was transferred from Air Malta to Pan Am. Law
authorities from Malta and Germany came to the same conclusion. And
yet, without any explanation, the judges wrote in the conclusion of
the verdict that: &quot;the absence of an explanation as to how the
suitcase was taken into the system at Luqa is a major difficulty for
the Crown case, but after taking full account of that difficulty, we
remain of the view that the primary suitcase began its journey at
Luqa.&quot; (' 82)

The Maltese storekeeper

According to the verdict, Megrahi bought the clothes, in which the
bomb was wrapped, in Sliema, a small town of Malta, including the
&quot;cloth&quot; in which the fragment was &quot;discovered&quot; by Dr Hayes. At first
sight, the &quot;cloth&quot; appears to be part of a 'Slalom' shirt, indeed sold
in a little shop, Mary's House, located on the island of the
Mediterranean Sea. However, upon closer examination, the &quot;cloth&quot;
raises a series of issues. Firstly, the colour of the label is
incorrect. A blue slalom shirt label should have blue writing, not
brown. Secondly, the breast pocket size corresponds to a child shirt,
not a 16  sized allegedly bought by Megrahi, for the pocket would
have been 2 cm wider. Thirdly, German records show the shirt with most
of the breast pocket intact, while the evidence shown at Zeist has a
deep triangular tear extending inside the pocket. Fourthly, last but
certainly not least, the storekeeper initially told the investigators
he never sold such shirts to whoever visited him a few weeks before
the Lockerbie tragedy.The testimony of Tony Gauci (the storekeeper)
was pivotal in the case against Megrahi. Gauci gave a series of 19
statements to the police which are fully inconsistent. Yet, the Judges
found him trustworthy. Allow me to disagree. On January 30th 1990,
Gauci stated: &quot;That time when the man came, I am sure I did not sell
him a shirt.&quot; Then, on September 10th 1990, he told the investigators
that: &quot;I now remember that the man who bought the clothing also bought
a 'Slalom' shirt.&quot; And to make things worse, two of his testimonies
have disappeared.

When were the clothes bought?

According to the verdict, Megrahi bought the clothes on December 7th
1989. Gauci remembered that his brother had gone home earlier to watch
an evening football game (Rome vs. Dresden), that the man came just
before closing time (7pm), that it was raining (the man bought an
umbrella) and that the Christmas lights were on. The game allows for
only two dates: November 23 or December 7. The issue is critical for
there is no indication that Megrahi was in Malta on November 23rd but
is known to have been on the island on December 7th. Malta airport
chief meteorologist testified that it was raining on November 23rd but
not on December 7th. Yet the judges determined the date as December
7th. This rather absurd conclusion from the judges raises two other
issues. The game Rome-Dresden on December 7th was played at 1:00 pm,
not in the evening. What is more, Gauci had previously testified that
the Christmas lights were not up, meaning that the date had to be
November 7th. On September 19th 1989, Gauci stated that &quot;the
[Christmas] decorations were not up when the man bought the clothing.&quot;
Then, at the Lockerbie trial, Gauci told the Judges that the
decoration lights were on. &quot;Yes, they were  up.&quot;

Who was the mysterious buyer?

&quot;We are nevertheless satisfied that his identification, so far as it
went, of the first accused as the purchaser was reliable, and should
be treated as a highly important element in this case,&quot; wrote the
judges. In fact, Gauci never identified Megrahi. He merely stated that
Megrahi resembles the man to whom he had sold the clothes, but only if
he were much older and two inches taller. Gauci had however identified
another man: Abu Talb. And in case you wonder, Talb was a member of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine  General Command
[PFLP-GC], the terrorist group led by Ahmed Jibril. In late October
1988, the senior bomb maker of the PFLP-GC, Marwan Khreesat, was
arrested in Frankfurt in company of Hafez Dalkamoni, the leader of the
organization German cell. Dalkamoni had met Talb in Cyprus and Malta
the weeks before. In their car, police found a bomb hidden in a
Toshiba radio. Khreesat told the police that he had manufactured five
similar IED's. Each device Khreesat had built was triggered by a
pressure gauge that activates a timer - range from 0 to 45 minutes -
when the plane reaches a cruising altitude of 11,000 meters. The
timers of all recovered bombs were set on 30 minutes. It takes about 7
minutes for a 747 to reach cruising altitude. Pan Am 103 exploded 38
minutes after take-off from London. German police eventually recovered
four of the IED's Khreesat had built. No one seems to know what ever
occurred to the fifth one which was never recovered. When police
raided Talb apartment in Sweden, they found his appointment notebook.
Talb had circled one date: December 21st. Contrary to Jibril's
statement, and surely he must know better, a bomb triggered by a
pressure gauge set at 11,000 meters would not have detonated during
the Frankfurt to London flight, as the airliner does not reach
cruising altitude on such short flight. Then again, such device would
not have detonated at all if it had been located in the luggage area,
as the hold is at the pressure of the passengers' zone, and never
drops below the pressure equivalent to 2,400 meters. This is why, when
the judges were presented with the undisputable and undisputed
evidence that a proper simulation of the explosion - taking proper
account of the Mach stem effect  would locate the explosion outside
the luggage hold, they simply decided to dismiss the existence of a
scientifically well established fact. &quot;We do not consider it necessary
to go into any detail about Mach stem formation,&quot; the judges wrote.
Had the judges deemed &quot;necessary to go into the details regarding Mach
stem formation&quot;, they would have been forced to acknowledge that the
position of the bomb was fully incompatible with the indictment. That
a magic unaccompanied luggage went mysteriously three times through
airport security was &quot;plausible&quot;. That it jumped on its own out of the
luggage hold at London airport was a little too much to believe. In
truth, a proper simulation of the explosion locates the bomb just a
few inches away from the skin of the plane, a position fully
consistent with the very specific damages left by the explosion. The
truth was inconvenient. The three judges had to dismiss it in order to
justify a verdict that had been decided more than a decade before the
first day of the Zeist trial. Shame on those who committed this
horrific act of terror. Shame on those who have ordered the cover-up.
Shame on those who provided false testimony, and those who suppressed
and fabricated the evidence needed to frame Libya. And shame on the
media for their accomplice silence. And to those who seek the truth, I
advise them to follow the drug trail on the road to Damascus.

Grand
Theft Iraq
Privatizing and Carving
up an Entire National Economy

by Felicity Arbuthnot

Global Research, September 14, 2007

&quot;We live under a system by which the many are exploited by the few -
and war is the ultimate sanction of that exploitation.&quot; Harold Laski,
1945.

At the end of August, in Dubai and the beginning of September, in
London, conferences were held in order to privatize and carve up
contracts for every essential service and infrastructure in Iraq.
There was not a mega-corporate pig anywhere on earth, seemingly, who
did not have its trotters in the trough. As Iraqis flee in an exodus
of biblical proportions and die in a genocidal one, US/UK government
backed corporate priority is a smash and grab raid of every asset and
facility in the &quot;land between two rivers&quot;.

Meetings were organised by the Iraq Development Programme, under the
auspices of the Arab-British Chamber of Commerce (&quot;Arab&quot; clearly
secondary, as since Arabic is written from right to left, Britain
comes first and the Arabic version, last) ninety five percent of
&quot;tendered&quot; (&quot;assumed&quot; seems more apt) contracts are US giants. The UK
was thrown minimal bones, with Egypt, Netherlands and Spain getting
one each, according the IDP website
( http://www.iraqdevelopmentprogramme.org )

The &quot;best-in-breed&quot; technology is to the brought to Iraq, as it is
milked dry.

Trough facilitators include: the misnamed United States Aid and
International Development (USAID), U.S. Embassy Iraq, Department of
Defence Army Corps of Engineers, (U.S.) Defence Procurement and
Acquisition Police, U.S. Government Iraq Infrastructure and
Reconstruction Programme (NB: http://www.bechtel.com/iraq ) the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation, U.S. Government Iraq
Reconstruction Projects - and on and on. To mix metaphors, potential
cash cows don't come bigger than this.

The carpetbaggers had a little bit of help from their quisling friends
in their illegitimate and illegal carve up. Dr Adel Abdul Mehdi,
Iraq's &quot;Vice President&quot;, said: &quot;Iraq's new investment law will
facilitate investment for both Iraqi and non-Iraqi businesses by
providing a secure investment environment.&quot; Referring to Iraq's
resources, he said the conference presented opportunities across a
wide range of industries: oil, gas, agriculture, infrastructure.

Indeed. Up for grabs are: hospital and security equipment, medicines,
road and rail machinery, oil production tools, finance and
telecommunication systems. Rebuilding of roads, rail, hospitals,
government buildings, schools, water purification plants and
electricity, information technology, telecommunications, all to move
from state owned to the &quot;free market economy&quot;.

If Iraqis are down to near no electricity now, due to the liberators'
inability to provide what Saddam Hussein's government did within just
months after the 1991 decimation, they won't be able to afford it in
the future anyway. &quot;Yes we have plans for fully privatising&quot;, Iraq's
electricity &quot;Minister&quot; Karem Waheed Hassan, told UPI.

Ali Al Dabbagh, for the Electricity Company, was concerned only for
assurances &quot;for the investor&quot;, Iraq's population did not come into the
equation. Contracts will be granted; $Billions will be spent;
contractors paid their massive profits - and the lights will go out
all over Iraq (except the Green Zone, and the Vatican City sized U.S.
embassy, if the resistance haven't blown them up.)

In the country which brought the world writing, the first written
records, Algebra, Astronomy, the wheel, the first time piece,
Irrigation, the first pharmaceutical college, the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;,
and it is thought, the first university, the Universities of Florida
and Oklahoma are being drafted in as education &quot;curricular
consultants&quot; to take advantage of the &quot;key opportunities in ICT and
education&quot;.

It would be interesting to know what the Universities of Florida and
Oklahoma can offer to a country which, as with Palestine, prior to the
invasion, had the most PhD's per capita, in the world. Whose
educational system was so exemplary, that UNESCO devised a unique
award for Iraq, commenting that it was the only country, in their
experience, where a child could be born in abject poverty, of
illiterate parents and complete his education to become an architect,
engineer, surgeon, or whatever he or she aspired to. Education was
free from kindergarten through university and post graduate studies
abroad.

&quot;Panel sessions at the conferences covered the legal environment for
conducting business in Iraq, financing private sector business, trade
and commerce and private sector banking.&quot;

You bet. American lawyers seemingly are on hand at every ministry to
draft laws legitimising one of the biggest ram raids in history.

Electricity, of course, is also needed to pump oil. Some of those
representing the oil industry - which, after nationalisation in 1971,
saw the Iraqi government pour money into all that is now being
privatised, thereby creating a near &quot;first world country&quot;, according
to the U.N. - were: Chevron, B.P., Conoco Phillips, Marathon Oil,
Total, Exxon, Lukoil, Statoil, General Electric, Dana Gas, Raytheon,
Crescent Petrolium and Hawker Beechcroft.

Ahmed Janabi (Al Jazeera, 4th May 2006) reminds us of Douglas Feith,
then US Under-Secretary of Defence, who said on February 11, 2003:

&quot;Only someone ignorant of the easy-to-ascertain realities could think
that the United States would profit from such a war, even if we were
willing to steal Iraq's oil which we emphatically are not going to do.&quot;

He was either economical with the truth, or very forgetful of
President George H.W. Bush's statement after 1991, Janabi reminds, who
said he would not let one country control twenty percent of the
world's oil resources. Further, at a conference in London on 20th June
2003, just a month after the fall of Baghdad, writes Janabi, Israel's
Binyamin Netanyahu told a group of investors that Iraqi oil would be
flowing through Israel's Jaffa pipeline &quot;sooner or later&quot;.

&quot;Iraq has the capacity to become the biggest revenue generating
country in the Middle East&quot;, states I.D.P., with one delegate shown on
BBC Newsnight, nearly salivating, as he talked of opportunities
unheard of anywhere on the globe. &quot;A follow up summit is expected to
take place in 2008, by which time the hydro-carbon law will have been
approved.&quot; The &quot;Iraqi people are going to become part of the
international community&quot;, said another I.D.P. delegate.

Indeed, stripped of all and sold down Mesopotamia's two great rivers.
Coincidentally, the U.S. is to build another vast base in Wasit
Province, to protect Iraq from &quot;insurgents&quot; coming in from Iran. As
the gimlet eyed analyst Sarah Meyer points out coincidentally, another
vast oilfield, it seems, has just been discovered there.

( http://www.indexresearch.blogspot.com);

In an article worth revisiting, (U.S.) Major General Smedley Butler,
in Common Sense Magazine, in November 1935 wrote:

&quot;There isn't a trick in the racketeering bag that the military gang is
blind to. It has its 'finger men' (to point out enemies) its 'muscle
men' (to destroy enemies) its 'brain guys' (to plan war preparations)
and a 'Big Boss' (supernationalistic capitalism.)

&quot;It may seem odd, for me, a military man, to adopt such a comparison.
Truthfulness compels me to do so. I spent thirty three years and four
months in active service in one of our country's most agile forces -
the Marine Corps. I served in all commissioned ranks from Second
Lieutenant to Major General. During that period I spent most of my
time being a high class muscle man for Big Business and Wall Street
and for the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer; a gangster for
capitalism.

&quot;I suspected I was just a part of a racket at the time. Now I am sure
of it.... My mental faculties remained in suspended animation while I
obeyed the orders of the higher ups. This is typical with everyone in
military service.

&quot;Thus, I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American
oil interests in 1914. I made Haiti and Cuba a decent place for
National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping
of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall
Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua
for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-12. I
brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interests
in 1916. In China, in 1927, I helped see to it that Standard Oil went
its way unmolested.

&quot;During those years, I had, as the boys in the backroom would say, a
swell racket. I was rewarded with honors, medals and promotion.
Looking back on it, I feel I might have been able to give Al Capone a
few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three
city districts. I operated on three continents.&quot;

Mesopotamia is a racket so gargantuan, that it surely would have
stunned even General Butler. Not, however, it seems, General Colin
Powell, who told U.S, Commander in Chief, President George W. Bush, in
the summer of 2002, that in the event of an invasion of Iraq: &quot;You are
going to be the proud owner of twenty five million people ... You'll
own it all.&quot;

Global Credit Crunch Hitting Korea

Global Research, September 17, 2007

Chosun Ilbo

In the aftermath of the subprime mortgage debacle in the U.S., the
credit crisis has continued in the global financial market, bringing
repercussions for Korean financial firms and consumers as well. Since
the crisis, Korean financial firms have had difficulties raising
foreign funds. Even when they borrow only small amounts of foreign
funds, they have to pay up to 50 basis points (1basis point=0.01
percentage point) above the average interest rate.

Kim In-joo, the chief of the global funding team at Korea Development
Bank, said, &quot;In the global money market these days, even leading
investment banks like Citibank and Merrill Lynch can raise funds only
when they propose additional interest of 30 to 40 bp. Although it
maintains a higher credit rating than Korea's sovereign credit rating,
KDB finds it very hard to raise more than US$500 million in foreign
funds.&quot;

The Export-Import Bank of Korea raises more foreign funds than any
other Korean bank. &quot;We've so far managed to cope with the widened
yield spreads&quot; - the interest rates borrowers have to pay over
Treasuries -- its CEO Yang Cheon-sik said. &quot;But if the trend
continues, we'll have to increase the interest rates for domestic
loans to make up for the loss.&quot; That would mean a blow to corporate
profitability.

And still the sluggish housing market in the U.S., the cause of the
subprime mortgage crisis and ensuing worldwide credit crisis, is
showing signs of getting worse. Lee Geun-tae, a research fellow at the
LG Economic Research Institute, predicted, &quot;Falling housing prices in
the U.S. will lead to sluggish consumption and investment and push
down the U.S. economic growth rate to the 1 percent level in 2008. In
that case, Korea's economy, which relies highly on the U.S. economy,
will shrink and feel pressure.&quot;

In recent years, Korean financial firms have scrambled to increase
project finance loans for property. Now many experts are saying that
such loans are in great danger of turning into a Korean version of the
subprime crisis. The domestic real estate business recession has
dragged on, forcing financial companies to virtually suspend project
finance loans. As a result, construction firms have had trouble
raising funds, with many a small and medium-sized builder going bankrupt.

Many worry that the trend could spark a financial crisis, resulting
in a domino effect in which the real estate business stays in
recession, small and medium-sized construction companies go bankrupt,
and large amounts of financial firms' insolvent bonds circulate. As of
the end of June, project finance loans from domestic banks amounted to
W69 trillion (US$1=W928), up W25 trillion year-on-year. For savings
banks, project finance loans account for 29 percent (W12.5 trillion)
of all their loans, their rate of overdue repayments a whopping 13
percent. Some are already talking about a savings banks crisis.

In the wake of the global credit crunch, overseas bond issuing has
been all but suspended and securities firms have attracted more
clients who would otherwise have deposited their money in banks. This
trend has, in turn, led to a dearth of funds for commercial banks. So
the banks are raising funds for most of their needs by issuing bank
bonds and transferable certificates of deposit. But the drastic
increase in the issuance of CDs has sent the CD interest rate, which
plays the role as the standard rate for bank loans, soaring, and has
forced households to pay more interest. As of Sept. 14, the CD
interest rate had soared to 5.35 percent, up 0.72 percentage points
year-on-year.

As of the end of August, domestic banks' housing mortgage loans were
W218 trillion. Given that more than 95 percent of loans are at
variable interest rates pegged to the CD interest rate, borrowers will
have to pay an additional W1.5 trillion in interest per year due to
the increase. Park Deok-bae, a researcher at the Hyundai Economic
Research Institute, warned, &quot;If the interest rate keeps rising, Korea
could face a household liquidity crisis like the U.S.&quot; In other words
Korea, too, could be trapped in a vicious cycle of rising interest
rates, falling housing prices, household bankruptcies, insolvent
household loans and a looming credit crisis.
