I just received this email from my brother Wayne (who is also a member of the WWWCOF).  He means the world to me and I would really appreciate it if you could take a moment to email him and say hello.  His email address is w.j.stann ... @gmail.com

Thank you so much.

Love,

Hi Sharon
Sorry that I haven't written much of late. I am still trying to getting back on my feet after spending the better part of last week in intensive care. It seems that my blood sugars went to hell in a hand basket after we arrived back in Edmonton after our world wind visit to the coast and Island. I went into a diabetic coma which almost cost me my life. I was being power hydrated for the better part of five days in order to save my kidneys. Tests show that there is NO KIDNEY DAMAGE. I'll tell you one thing Sharon, I have never been so scared in all my 57 years, as I was in these past six or seven days. I have lost 60% of my overall strength, and believe me, the next two months could prove weather I will have the strength to overcome this latest health problem. I can't say enough about Jenny and all the hours she spent beside me. Her health also took a turn for the worse as a result of what happened, but she has mustered some of her stubborn courage and with that alone has given us great strength. Karen, Steven, Mary, Jason, Melisa, Kevin, Chris &amp; Mikey all made a short visit. I sort of remembered watching the looks on there faces as they looked at all the equipment that I was hooked up to. I guess it would have been an overpowering experience to say the least...Love Wayne
