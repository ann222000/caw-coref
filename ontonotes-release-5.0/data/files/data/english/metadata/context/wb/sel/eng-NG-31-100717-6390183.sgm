The New Republic's odd new owner

By Eric Boehlert
Created Mar 3 2007 - 10:15am

Even though it's Canada's largest and most influential media conglomerate,
it's likely that some staffers at The New Republic are still only vaguely
aware of CanWest Global Communications, the Great North media giant that
announced [0] it had purchased the 93-year-old Beltway opinion journal.

The good news is that CanWest, run by the Asper family, is expected to beef
up TNR's resources both in print and online. Yes, the magazine, whose
circulation has cratered in recent years, is scaling back to just twice a
month. But CanWest promises to redesign the magazine, introduce more
illustrations, and try to make TNR look like a real consumer magazine. (TNR
is the only stand-alone magazine amidst the multibillion-dollar media
behemoth that's brimming [0] with more than 100 Canadian newspapers and
dozens of television and radio properties worldwide.)

That's the good news. The bad news [0] for TNR staffers is that CanWest's
recent history is littered [0] with lawsuits, gag orders, and byline
strikes, buffered by a steady stream of columnists, reporters, and editors
who complain CanWest actively censors [0] its employees who stray from the
company's conservative, pro-war, pro-Israel blueprint. On paper, that's not
a problem for The New Republic, since it was proudly pro-war and pro-Israel
under its previous ownership. But TNR editor Franklin Foer told [0] The New
York Times that the CanWest deal cements the magazine's "center-left"
philosophy. And more importantly TNR remains, in theory, a publication
dedicated to open debate and would likely recoil at any kind of top-down
editorial litmus test. Yet that's precisely what Canadian journalists have
been complaining about for years with CanWest.

"The Asper family of Winnipeg is violating Canada's cherished tradition of a
free media," wrote Haroon Siddiqui, a columnist for the Toronto Star, in
2002. "CanWest has spawned a culture of fear and self-censorship among
journalists."

Writing for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer in 2005, columnist Joel Connelly,
looking across the border, noted [0]TNR, particularly during the upcoming
election cycle, fares under the traditionally heavy-handed ownership of
CanWest. Here's a look at the laundry list of conflicts that have arisen in
recent years as CanWest tried to muzzle its own journalists:

a.. In December 2001, CanWest's Winnipeg headquarters announced the
chain's 14 daily metropolitan newspapers were to begin running the same
unsigned "national editorials. [0]" CanWest prohibited the publication of
conflicting local editorials. Turmoil [0] ensued when furious journalists at
the Montreal Gazette launched a two-day byline strike [0] in protest of the
new policy. CanWest executive David Asper then attacked Gazette staffers as
"bleeding hearts" and "riff-raff" who engaged in "pathetic politics" and a
"childish protest." CanWest quickly imposed a gag order [0] on all its
Gazette employees.
b.. Months later, employees at CanWest's The Regina Leader-Post in Ottawa
began their own byline strike [0] after editors there rewrote a news article
about speech given by a media critic who claimed CanWest censored free
speech. Ten participating journalists were reprimanded with suspensions and
pay cuts. "I will not tolerate an employee who is not loyal to his
employer," said CanWest founder Izzy Asper. (Izzy died in 2003; his son,
Leonard, now serves as president.) "I happen to think the sanction should be
much more strong." CanWest extended its Gazette gag order to include all of
its news outlets.
c.. Stephen Kimber quit his job as a columnist for The Halifax Daily News
in 2002 after being [0] censored [0] by his CanWest editors: "It was very
direct, [they said] 'You can't say anything that would not be supportive of
the government of Israel, that might be supportive of the Palestinians, you
can't say anything that would reflect badly on CanWest, and you can't talk
about [then-Canadian Prime Minister] Jean Chrétien.' " (The Aspers were
close political allies of Chrétien.)
d.. Montreal Gazette columnist Lyle Stewart quit the newspaper in 2002
after three of his weekly columns were spiked. Stewart publicly complained
[0] about the "thought police in the CanWest ministry of truth." He also
bemoaned "the atmosphere of censorship and intolerance that the Aspers have
encouraged throughout the [CanWest] chain."
e.. In June 2002, Russell Mills, longtime publisher of The Ottawa Citizen,
was fired [0] after his paper ran an editorial calling for the resignation
of Chrétien for his role in a conflict-of-interest scandal. Mills claimed
that CanWest executives resented the fact Mills failed to submit the
critical editorial to company headquarters prior to publishing it. Mills
later filed legal notice, insisting he was libeled [0] by CanWest president
Leonard Asper in the wake of the firing. (Mills later settled for an
undisclosed amount of money.) In response to Mills' firing, more than 40
ex-publishers and executives of CanWest's Southam Newspapers chain took out
a full-page [0] newspaper ad accusing CanWest of limiting freedom of the
press by forcing centralized editorials to run in its daily newspapers.
f.. In October 2003, a Quebec arbitrator ruled [0] against CanWest by
finding that Montreal Gazette journalists had the right to withhold their
bylines "as they see fit."
g.. In February 2004, CanWest was forced to un-gag the Montreal Gazette
journalists who had protested the company's central editorial policy. The
arbitration settlement [0] reaffirmed the journalists' freedom of speech and
their right to "contribute to and participate in open public debate" over
the paper's policies.
Unfortunately, when it comes to reporting on the Middle East, CanWest
outlets seem averse to "open public debate," with the Asper family often
demanding editorial purity on the topic. CanWest is "unabashedly"
pro-Israel, company executive Murdoch Davis once famously announced.

Indeed.

Following a deadly, anti-Israeli terrorist attack in Jerusalem in 2001, a
CanWest chain-wide editorial announced "Howsoever the Israeli government
chooses to respond to this barbaric atrocity should have the unequivocal
support of the Canadian government" [emphasis added]. CanWest deplored "the
usual hand-wringing criticism about 'excessive force' " and declared,
"Nothing is excessive." (Papers were instructed not to publish columns or
letters to the editor taking issue with that editorial.)

During an October 2002 speech [0], Izzy Asper eviscerated media coverage of
the Middle East, complaining that "lazy," "sloppy," "stupid," and
"anti-Semitic" reporters suffer from a pro-Palestinian bias. "'They have
adopted Palestinian propaganda as the context of their stories. They have
become partisans in, and not providers of, knowledge about this war against
Israel," said Asper.

Montreal Gazette TV critic Peggy Curran was forced to appeal to union
officials to get her review of a Middle East documentary critical of Israeli
forces for targeting media working on the Palestinian side published.
CanWest editors objected to her conclusions. Said Curran [0]: "Usually
[television] criticism is criticism, and you're allowed to say what you
want. I can't think of another occasion when this has happened to me.
Whether you know it or not, you start censoring yourself." Curran soon gave
up her critic's job.

Meanwhile, Halifax Daily News columnist Peter March was fired, he said,
because he had been critical of Israel. When Doug Cuthand, a columnist for
the Leader-Post

in Regina and the Star-Phoenix in Saskatoon, compared the plight of
Palestinians to that of Canadian aboriginals, his column was spiked [0], a
first in his 10 years with the newspapers. And Montreal Gazette's veteran
reporter Bill Marsden once complained [0] that CanWest bosses "do not want
any criticism of Israel. We do not run in our newspaper op-ed pieces that
express criticism of Israel and what it's doing."

In 2004, Reuters, the worldwide news agency, asked [0]

CanWest to drop the Reuters byline from some articles the chain published
because CanWest editors were rewriting copy originating from the Middle East
and inserting the word "terrorist" for phrases such as ''insurgents'' and
''rebels.'' CanWest though, had to publish one correction after it
erroneously labeled several Palestinian killed by Israeli troops to be
"terrorists" when in fact they were "fugitives." CanWest had to publish
another correction after it inserted "terrorist" more than half-a-dozen
times in an article describing fighting between Iraqis and United States
forces in Fallujah.

In a statement following the announcement of the TNR purchase, CanWest
declared [0], "In today's media environment, we need to place a priority on
delivering quality content to readers when, where and how they want it. The
New Republic is well positioned to do just that."

The question remains: Will CanWest owners allow The New Republic to do just
that?

I stopped reading "The New Republic" years ago. I didn't even know they
were still in print.  When I stopped reading them they were 100% anti
Clinton (ie: facts be damned).  Pro war?  Was there a single news
publication in the US that wasn't pro war? and 100% wrong?
