My alma mater is going to open the class size up in spring of 2008 for about
20 foreign trained dentists to get their US equivalent degree.  They will
have to do 3 years of schooling.

In Ontario, Canada, both dental schools will require you to do 2 years of
training to get your general licence to practice here.  From what I
understand, it is quite competitive for the limited number of spots for this
qualifying program.

As for postgraduate studies, you may receive a postgraduate licence (simply
just paperwork once you have been accepted into a postgraduate program) to
allow you to come here to learn your specialty.  After your specialty course
is finished (3-5 years), you take your specialty board exams and if you pass
them, you can work as a specialist here.

I have attended both schools (Toronto for advanced training in Dental
Anaesthesia and Schulich for my general dental degree).  Both were excellent
in training and experience.

For licensure in any US state, a BDS will be treated as only fulfilling
the first two years toward a DDS/DMD which is the minimum requirement.
Two extra years in a dental school program structured for the BDS
graduate will be necessary to get the DDS/DMD. I really don't think that
there are any programs that will train you if you can't qualify for a
license. I had a BDS from India back in 1981 as my US Army dental
assistant. They would only allow him to be an assistant, not a hygienist
either, despite his knowledge, training, and experience.

I think the only &quot;foreign&quot; trained dentists accepted as equivalent as US
trained are Canadian dentists. e.g. The People's Republic of
Massachusetts made the reknowned, well trained, Swiss-educated
periodontist, Dr. H.P. Weber, complete an extra two years to get a DMD
in order to practice there.

The dental school ( in the US ) I went to accepts like ~100 foreign
dentists for placement into its 2nd yr class for a traditional 4 yr
DDS program. Other foreign dentists enter 3 yr PG programs in perio or
prostho, which I believe might be another backdoor towards US
licensure.

What's the main reason for her wanting to get out of India so bad? I
don't specifically know about the other listed countries but, in the
US, being a dentist isn't necessarily all that.

Back door?  They do go to school for their specialty, so they've earned it.
This is not a backdoor as they will be restricted to practicing their
specialty only.  It doesn't matter from where they come from.  Why so bitter
about foreigners who are professionals trying to get legit training/work in
the North America?  Many big names in early dentistry (and medicine for that
matter) in North America weren't born here.

India has a billion people living there.  Much of the country is
third-world.  If I could use my profession as a ticket somewhere else, I
might take it, too.  Being a dentist in the USA or Canada maybe a whole lot
better for this person than being one in India.

But if you think about how just 3 yrs of PG can provide a foreign
dentist with both US licensure and specialty status, it doesn't sound
right. Most foreign dental schools begin right after high school,
meaning in the same 8 yrs required for a US student to become a
general dentist, a foreign dentist can even become a specialist in the
US.

Even Canadians want to become dentists in the US. I also saw plenty
from the UK, Taiwan, and Spain, which are all far from being third
world.

I wasn't talking about general immigration; I'm not of the Anglo-Saxon
US blood myself.

I was wondering if there was something with dentistry in the US that
makes it so desirable.

I think you answered your own question in your paragraph below:

How much of that undergraduate education do you actually use as a dentist?
Zero.  The only benefit you get with a few years of undergrad is that you
should be a more mature person.  It has no bearing on your ability as a
dentist.  An American or a Canadian can go to India to get their dental
education, right out of high school as you put it, but my sense is no one
does that.  The 6-8 year North American thing is just the way it is here.

There are more good opportunities from a professional standpoint in the USA
than in any other country.  Sure, if you just want to be the neighbourhood
dentist in a busy town, you might have a tough slug at it.  But move to
rural Maine and you will be busy.  Move to Northern Ontario (Canada) and you
will be busy.  Also, lots of good dental schools in the USA to teach at, if
that is your desire.

Like medicine, dentistry in the US is highly renumerative. I think that
this is also the case in Germany. As I recall, in the early eighties,
German dentists were the most prosperous members of the artze klasse,
and made much more than their US counterparts, even under the socialized
system in BRD. One sees very few German dentists emigrating to the USA
but there are many Irish, British, Indian, South African, Arab, and
Pakistani dentists in the US. I know an Irish periodontist who practiced
in the US for 10 years then went back to Eire in 1993 to ply his craft.
He was back in the US in 1995 because his specialty was not appreciated
or renumerative in his homeland. The USA still presents a very
attractive place to practice, hence the restrictions.

I really don't think that a BDS can get into a specialty training
program unless he/she first gets a DDS/DMD - that usually means 2 more
years of pre-doctoral training.

Originally, I was mentioning how one can alternatively head right to a
PG program for licensure (+ bonus of an added specialty ). I was
merely answering the OP's question. And just because I feel this
pathway to licensure is advantageous and provides a bonus to foreign
dentists doesn't mean I'm bitter. And I'm even admitting to you that
I'm not of Anglo-Saxon blood.

Out of curiosity, I was also asking if it was a problem with dentistry
that makes a foreign dentist want to move away from her country.

No reason to get defensive. But if you were offended in any way, then
I acknowledge I should have been more sensitive in this discussion.
