Hello

Dear Iftikhar

It is good step from you and birds are looking happy in outside flight, but
always remember when you allow your birds to stay in out door flight the
chances of attacks and disease transfer also increase from wild birds.

For attacks from wild birds you can use double wire wall with few inches
gape but about diseases from wild birds I hope international members will
reply with their experiences.

Best Regards

Mobassir Sattar Khan

Hi Mobassir
I have already sent Iftikhar an email about covering the roof area of the
aviary to prevent disease being spread to the birds via their droppings.
As you are well aware, and some members may not be aware that a lot of
disease that your birds gets comes from the wild birds which perch on the
aviary.
The droppings come through to the floor underneath and budgies being as they
are - eat dropping - and then they can get disease from this.

If you want light in the aviary and covered, I suggest polycarbonated
roofing or plastic corrugated roofing to protect the birds from disease and
the elements. Having them out in the hot sun - they will not appreciate it.
I realise that they can get inside, but the main thing is keep the disease
out.

Regards
Betty

HI BUTT Sahib

Nice aviary you did the rapid work few day ago you have just
constructed  paved
floor out side the bird room and now in short time completed the
construction work and allow the birds to access in new environment but I
believe  there is nothing to worry about the hot temperature has drooped

It is really  modern aviary and I enjoyed it and the birds movement in it
they were very comfortable
Our friends on the list give you fruitful comprehensive advices you must
follow  in this way you can secure your birds by adopting preventive
measures .diseases can easily intervene  from the wild birds in  our captive
birds because the wild birds devolved immunity against these diseases and
they are carriers of these diseases  so we should careful about these facts
Betty gave you the good suggestion any way it is very impressive aviary and
of course the inmates are excellent  keep it up
take care

Regards

Ahmad raza sahi

I have already sent Iftikhar an email about covering the roof area of the aviary to prevent disease being spread to the birds via their droppings.
As you are well aware, and some members may not be aware that a lot of disease that your birds gets comes from the wild birds which perch on the aviary.
The droppings come through to the floor underneath and budgies being as they are - eat dropping - and then they can get disease from this.

If you want light in the aviary and covered, I suggest polycarbonated roofing or plastic corrugated roofing to protect the birds from disease and the elements. Having them out in the hot sun - they will not appreciate it. I realise that they can get inside, but the main thing is keep the disease out.

Regards
Betty

Hello
Dear Iftikhar
It is good step from you and birds are looking happy in outside flight, but always remember when you allow your birds to stay in out door flight the chances of attacks and disease transfer also increase from wild birds.
For attacks from wild birds you can use double wire wall with few inches gape but about diseases from wild birds I hope international members will reply with their experiences.

Hi folk

The Bannerettes' were sent via Airmail last Friday - I added a few extra varieties for you to use as well.

I believe I added Fallow, Clearbody, Black Eyed Self (Dilute class would cover this), Opaline AOSV (Any other standard variety of Opaline - includes Cinnamonwing, Greywing, Clearwing - the WBO might have more than this in their Standard?)

I was not sure if you have these varieties, if you have - then it is a bonus, if not, then not a problem.

They should arrive well in advance of your show - fingers crossed.

I trust the show is successful

Cheers
