*NEW RESOURCES: "State of the States" Report Features U.S. Death Penalty
Developments*
Posted: January 26, 2007
Stateline.org's recent "State of the States" report features an
extensive article on capital punishment trends in the United States. The
piece includes a thorough review of lethal injection challenges in the
states, as well as a brief update on the issue of innocence and an
overview of other state legislative developments, such as efforts to
authorize the death penalty for some crimes other than murder. [ More

*North Carolina Panel Bars Doctors From Participating in Executions*
Posted: January 25, 2007
The North Carolina Medical Board, which licenses and disciplines doctors
in the state, has unanimously voted to make it unethical for a physician
to participate in executions. Under the new policy, doctors and nurses
employed by the prison system won't be disciplined for "merely being
'present' during an execution," but are forbidden from administering the
lethal drugs or physically assisting with the execution. The North
Carolina Medical Board ruling comes as the state continues its debate
about the humaneness of its lethal injection protocols. Defense
attorneys have argued that only anesthesiologists or trained medical
professionals can tell if an inmate is unconscious before being put to
death. They argue that the state's protocol could result in an inmate
waking up during the procedure but being paralyzed and unable to express
pain before dying. Currently, the North Carolina Department of
Corrections uses a brain wave monitor and heart monitor to evaluate the
status of a person being executed. The machines are watched from a small
viewing room established for doctors or nurses who are employed by the
prison system. UPDATE: The execution of Marcus Robinson and another
North Carolina inmate scheduled for execution, James Thomas, were stayed
by a state judge on January 25 because the state had made changes to its
execution process without getting the necessary approval. [ More

*****FEDERAL DEATH PENALTY: Man Receives Life Sentence for Role in
Illegal Immigrant Deaths*
Posted: January 24, 2007
A federal jury chose a sentence of life without parole for Tyrone
Williams (pictured) for his role in a human-smuggling operation that
left 19 illegal immigrants dead. In December, the same jurors convicted
Williams of 58 smuggling counts, 20 of which carried the death penalty
as a sentencing option. Williams, who abandoned about 100 immigrants
sealed in his truck's refrigeration trailer after determining that it
had become a death trap in 2003, is the third person to face federal
capital charges in the Southern District of Texas. [ More

*Texas Man Exonerated By DNA Evidence; Court and Prosecutor Apologize*
Posted: January 23, 2007
A Dallas man who spent nearly half of his life in prison or on parole
for a crime he did not commit was recently exonerated after DNA evidence
cleared him of raping a 12-year-old boy in 1982. James Waller is the
12th person since 2001 whose conviction in Dallas County has been
overturned as a result of genetic evidence. "Nowhere else in the nation
have so many individual wrongful convictions been proven in one county
in such a short span," said attorney Barry Scheck. Scheck and his
colleagues at the New York-based Innocence Project represented Waller
during his most recent efforts to prove his innocence. [ More

*"The Mentally Ill, Behind Bars" - an Op-ed by Bernard Harcourt*
Posted: January 22, 2007
In a recent New York Times op-ed, University of Chicago law and
criminology professor Bernard Harcourt notes that a growing number of
individuals "who used to be tracked for mental health treatment are now
getting a one-way ticket to jail." Pointing to a Justice Department
study released in September 2006, Harcourt notes that 56% of those
jailed in state prisons and 64% of all inmates across the nation
reported mental health problems within the past year. He states that one
reason for the increase in the number of mentally ill inmates may be a
trend away from institutionalizing these individuals in mental hospitals
and asylums. [ More
