When my pet made it to 39, I was about one third from 39 to 40.  I'm about
5000 from 40 now and my pet is still at 136.  It hasn't gotten one xp point
and we're fighting 41/42's mostly.  WTF?

Hunter pet usually lags one level behind the hunter. If it is on the
same level as the hunter, it won't gain experience. Your pet will
start gaining experience again when you ding 40. When it reaches 40,
it won't gain experience until you ding 41.

Thanks for this, answered on of my questions.

Another one though...
I just rolled a hunter.

while I was level 13 I picked up a level 8 pet, it seems to be catching up
on levels as I'm sure its level 12 now, will it catch up to 1 level bellow
me or should I have picked up a close level pet?

Also, if I let the pet do all the work killing something I cant loot the
corpse, or skin it if its a beast, is this to be expected?

thanks.

It will eventually catch you. Pets generally level up faster than the
player. There's one exception though: In Outland a player gets so much
quest XP that the pet can't keep up.

Yes. The reason is that the hunter pet is quite powerful and can solo
lower level mobs. You could go to an area which has 5-10 levels lower
mobs and set the pet to aggressive and go AFK and loot the corpses
afterwards. That would be a bit too easy. :-)

Yeah, I finally tamed an Ashmane Boar after getting up to level 48 with an
Elder Ashenvale Bear. Porky is blazing fast. If I'm in range of a mob it's
like he just teleports there he's so fast--plus he has almost as many hit
points as Yogi and eats almost as many types of food.

I set Porky on aggressive at the prime linen cloth grind point in Westfall,
32,32, and he was just constantly on the go. If I could have looted I would
have reams of linen in mere minutes.

As has been said, your pets will *generally* catch up and keep up.
Once you get one of a species you plan to keep, then I'd stick with
just one rather than swapping every few levels.  You need to keep the
loyalty level high to be able to train it up with all the next skills
you can get :).

One thing though: some pet abilities that can be taught to your
current pets must be learned from new pets.  In any zone, if you see a
beast, do a &quot;Beast Lore&quot; on it.  See if it has any Abilities that you
don't know.  If it does, go stable your pet, come back without one,
and then tame this new beast.  Fight with it just long enough to learn
it's ability, then abandon it.  Go get your original pet again.
*MOST* hunters will keep 2 permanent pets (I keep a solo and a group
pet - many others will keep a PvE and a PvP pet), and then keep the
3rd slot open for temporary pets. If you happen to feel confident that
you've learned all current pet abilities there are, then feel free to
pickup a 3rd permanent pet and use it too.

Question: which skills on each pet?

I mean: do you have speed increase and aggro reduction on the group
pet, and aggro gaining skills on the other one (and same DPS class,
for example two cats), or a tanking pet when soloing and a DPS when
grouping?

I levelled to 44 my little hunter in my spare time mostly with an
armored boar, now I really feel the need to get a DPS pet. The boar is
really good at tanking (and I'm a noob at pulling, so it takes care of
the wrong pull...) but grinding is slow.

Ok, now I have the problem that I wanted a ghost saber, went to
Ashenvale to tame it and now I have the BIG problem of being lvl 44
with a lvl 32 pet... Almost useless, and for a Beast Master it's a
problem. :-) But any advice will be appreciated :-)

unfortunately that doesnt work. for the longest time now, if you
yourself cause zero damage you dont get xp or get to loot corpses. you
have to cause at least 1 point of damage to trip the flag. but yes, pets
can indeed solo areas if you let them.

I did that (got my level 20 at level 30 so it was a grind catching him up)
and now I've replaced Casper with FishTank, an Elder Shadowmaw Panther from
STV. That cat has prowl rank 2 and dash rank 2, while the ghost sabre
doesn't have any special abilities, and FishTank was my level when I first

You can do it... Just grind mobs which are barely green to you. Such
mobs are probably around lvl 35-37. Your pet generally gets the same
around of XP, as long as the mobs aren't gray to you. You won't get
much XP from those mobs, but your pet will get a nice amounf of XP, so
your pet will slowly catch you up. You'll probably be around lvl 46-47
when your pet catches your level.

That isn't actually bad... I tamed a ghostsaber with my lvl 70 hunter!
It is a daunting task to level it up. I tamed it over a month ago and
it is lvl 58 now. I grind a level or two killing lvl 62-63 mobs when I
have nothing else to do.

I've got cower on the group pet for reduced aggro when needed.  I
still teach it growl though since it's free and the pet can &quot;tank&quot;
some trash mobs in a pinch.  I also gave the group pet reduced AOE
damage and the stamina talents, but didn't bother with the extra armor
since most damage a pet takes in groups is non-physical (unless it

At 70 I will also likely up the resistances on the group pet.

Even at same level mobs, you could have the pet
attack one, you attack another, and do stuff twice
as fast.  So the game makes you do at least some
damage.

I've run across this problem even with groups in
instances.  The pet takes on an enemy and kills
it without any help while the rest are focused
on more dangerous stuff, and no one can loot
that corpse.  In the wild I've often just set
an explosive trap to tag everything aggroing
my pet, then feign death to watch the fight.

I'm level 65 currently, and he's got the most recent claw and bite he

True. However, there is a much more efficient way to do this:

go to

http://petopia.brashendeavors.net
where you can find comprehensive lists of which pets can teach you which

levels or so in order to get the new skills without going back and forth to

There is a Beastmaster talent, Intimidate, that
generates a large amount of threat.  If you're not
Beastmaster specced, then you'll have to rely on
damage and growl (not sure if the level 70 Misdirection
applies to pets).

Even with Intimidate, I find myself using Disengage

Misdirection works on pets, but it has 2 min cooldown, so you can't
use it all the time. Intimidation has 1 min cooldown too. I don't
think it is a good idea to use these all the time. If a hunter always
gets aggro, he is making too much DPS in the beginning of the fight.
Aimed shot, for example, is usually not a good idea in the beginning
of fight (unless you're using Misdirection or fighting low level mobs
which can be killed easily).

I use it when I steal aggro from my pet.  Feign Death has a cooldown,
and I like to save that for times when I have multiple enemies on me
or an enemy that doesn't have my pet on its aggro list.  Ie, Feign
Death is for when I'm in trouble, Disengage is just for when I just
want to pop the enemy back onto my pet.  If I need to get rid of
another enemy before the battle is over, Feign Death is ready
to go.  All of the tools in the toolbox have uses.

Hmm, I find that a single Intimidation gives me free reign to do
as much damage as I want and not take aggro.  But I'm
beastmaster specced, which may make a difference.  I used
to have aimed shot, but I dont' remember it stealing aggro
away from intimidate.  Of course I dont' use Intimidate all the
time since the cooldown is too long.  But it's good insurance
if I'm up against something that hits hard (elite giant) so that
I can do all the damage I want safely and not worry about
too many crits (and if they hit hard I want to kill them fast,
not keep my damage low).

And intimidate does stop a PVE caster from healing at the
wrong time.  Very useful.  It's the only ability I have that does
that since I don't have the MM talents that stun.

So, intimidate has a 1 minute cooldown, feign death is 1 minute,
and Bestial Wrath is 2 minutes, which means I usually have at
least one of them free for an upcoming fight that might have
aggro problems.

Well, according to wowwiki.com, Growl has +664 (rank 8), scales with
pet attack power and level: http://www.wowwiki.com/Growl_(pet )

On the other side, Intimidation causes threat (+580), stuns the target
for 3 sec, and your pet will generate 50% more threat for 15 seconds:

You may find your pet is not casting Growl as often as it could, if
it is short on focus. Keep an eye on the pet bar when fighting and
see if it is growling every time the cooldown is up. If not, try
turning off Claw (which is a real focus-drain) and see if that
helps. Also, make sure Growl is the left-most ability of the four
you can add on the pet bar, so that it gets priority when its
cooldown is up.

An obvious thing, but make sure you are using the latest rank of
Growl - lower ranks will start to get resisted more and more often
as you fight higher level enemies, and a resisted growl really puts
a hole in your pet's threat generation.

Yes, but all you need to do is use Mend Pet and you get in on the
kill. So you could use AutoIt to spam Mend on your pet while you are
away. This is cheating, though, and against the Terms of Service.

It's a good way to save ammo and still be in on a kill that is some
distance away though. Not the cheating thing, I mean just casting
Mend.

I'm basing my gut reaction on what Omen reports as the current threat
situation.   Perhaps it's simply not as accurate as it could be, but I
notice if I start topping the cat on its meter, I soon have something
heading towards me.

I'll keep experimenting.  I really don't *want* a different pet.
Cathwylit has followed me all the way from the forests of Tendrassil to
the swamps of Zangermarsh and beyond.  I would feel wrong to put him
away now.

Mend pet works for that? I always thought you had to actually do some
damage... interesting one, I can see that being pretty useful if I can just
send the pet off to kill something while I'm looting previous corpses. I'll
have to experiment with that one :-)

Too many training points?? Maximum rank of bite and claw take only 29
training points each, whereas the high ranks of natural armor and
great stamina are very expensive, although they offer just a small
gain.

I generally give my pets maximum damage talents and good resistances.
I assign 100 points or less to great stamina and natural armor.
Resistances are important, because spellcasters usually cause the
worst damage.

I see no reason not to give him both, either.  The cost is very small,
comparitively.

Last night I stabled Cathwylit and went looking for Claw 9 and Bite 9.
Both were relatively easy, since the mobs you need are found in the Bone
Wastes about 30 seconds ride out of Shattarath.  Got a scorpoid and very
quickly learned Claw, then wandered a bit further north and found a
Dreadfang Widow to learn Bite from.  Pet is all trained up and ready to
do more damage.

I'm seriously considering respecing him out of Dash, which I have yet to
see any concrete usefulness out of.  Ok, he gets to the mob faster, but
he's rarely that far away from the mob anyway.

Possibly.  But I respecced the pet when I was stuck
unable to buy the next level of armor; somewhere in
the 40's I think.  Now that I'm 60 (and not going to
outlands for a long time) I'll see if any of the
left over points can be used for something before I
retire the character.

Also, two damage abilities both require energy.
The cooldown on claw doesn't seem to be too long,
so wouldn't a bite reduce the number of times
claw would be available?

That was one of the things I was considering adding :-)
Sometimes it feels like it takes just a little long to
get the pet into range and the first growl, so that I
can start shooting.

That depends on the level. When you're level 70, your pet has at least
10k armor and over 5k health. Next rank or two of armor don't mean
much, it is just 100-300 points of armor (300 for two ranks, 50
training points extra). The only exceptions are final ranks, which
offer bigger improvements, but on the other hand they are generally
too expensive to be practical.

Bite causes more damage than Claw, so it is a good thing. It requires
more focus too, but it also causes more damage per focus point.

">

The key difference between Bite and Claw is that Bite has a cooldown
while Claw does not.  Thus Claw will do more damage over the entire
fight as long as your pet has the focus to keep it firing.  The
Beastmaster Bestial Discipline talent and the Marksmanship Go For The
Throat talent both give you ways of artificially refilling your pet's
focus bar.  These talents allow a pet to use instant cast abilities
like Claw and Gore (or Lightning Breath) as a focus dump and give you
the maximum damage output.  If your pet is tanking be careful that it
has enough focus to use Growl when it's up.  In that situation Bite
may be a better choice because it is a more &quot;controlled burn&quot; of focus
that will ensure you have plenty available at all times.  Otherwise
you want to use that focus up as much as possible for maximum pet dps.
