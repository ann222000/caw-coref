I have a Ford with 249,976 miles on it is a 1985 Loncoln Town Car.The
top bolt on the starter might be a little hard to get to,unless you have
a universal socket,extension,and a ratchet,but I haven`t had to replace
a starter in several years.I have a 1991 Escort with 125,000 miles on it
and a 1993 F-150 with 115,650 miles just normal wear items needing to be
replaced(tires brakes,oil changes)

well for your information ford starters is alot easier than a chevy
because you dont have to change a ford starter its the chevys you have
to change becaue the are right beside the exhaust manofold and they get
hot and destroys the starter

i think studebakers is pretty good but a ford is better to haul with but
studebakers is good to look at all chevys are good for is to junk the
reason i know is because my uncle owns a wrecker service and all he ever
gets to do is work on them but hes got an 70s model ford and he hardly
gets to turn a bolt and his chevys scwat down in the back end when he
tows a car on them chevys are just week piles of junk so if your going
to do any towing you might as well buy a ford and crush that chevy

I recently saw a bumper sticker on a Ford van.

It said &quot; IF IT AINT A FORD, IT AINT SHIT &quot;

I guess the guy meant &quot; if it is a Ford, it IS shit ?????? &quot;

Sorry, after 25 years driving my Chevrolets, I'll stick with them.

I rather dive GMC's than either of those two! I have friends who drive old GMC's and have for years. I happen to drive both Chevy, GMC, and Ford trucks! What I have seen is that the GMC beats them both! I had to get a new moter for my 70 Ford, I have also replaced the engine in my 65 Chevy! MY 60 GMC has the origonal 305 in it and is still running great. Its only supposed to be a half ton but I have put almost 2 tons on it before! It is a GREAT truck and I will keep it untill I DIE!

Alright!!!! you go man. I'm sick of this kid. One thing I cant stand is
someone that only knows what his daddy told him. If he wants to see junked
fords...I got'em. Over 300 of them, rusty as hell. And like someone said,
the F-100 is the biggest piece of junk excuse for a truck I have ever seen,
other than imported excuses for trucks. I will say that as far as 1 ton and
bigger, I'd rather have a Ford than a Chevy, unless it has that stupid
poorly engineered twin I-beam crap under it. What the hell was that crap?
Everyone else quit putting straight axles under pickups years ago, yet Ford
engineers dont have the intelligence to design a good independent. They
just used two straight axles. I'll take my Dodge Ram anyday over Ford or
Chevy. Oh...and F100 man (yeah, right) BOY, I mean, my daddy can kick you
daddys ass anyday. hehee...would him and your momma still be related if
they got a divorce?

Actually GMC's are more innovative. I have seen many articles over the
years that indicate that GMC has tried more innovations in their
designs. GMC has been more experimental than Chevy. GMC was the first to
offer the vette L-5 in a truck that out ran and out performed the Chevy
SS at that time.

Ford tends to make overall, mediocre cars. Not great, not terrible.
GMC's cars tend to go into thirds: 1/3 excellent (SB chevy, etc), 1/3
mediocre, and 1/3 terrible (Vega, Cad 4-6-8, aluminum V8, diesel 350
and other &quot;technological advances&quot; they tried out on the public instead
of doing the appropriate long-term testing IMHO.
I own both GMC and Ford.
My Fords wear out slowly, giving me time to get parts and plan to fix it.
My GMC products break instantly, and have left me in bad straits--
5 degree weather and 30 miles from ANYTHING in outback Nevada,
and visiting SF on Sunday (when all stores/ machinists are closed!)

&gt; bigger, I'd rather have a Ford than a Chevy, unless it has that stupid
&gt; poorly engineered twin I-beam crap under it. What the hell was that crap?

"/> It was a good idea in theory, just badly developed. The longer the arm, the
less deflection of the wheel as it moves up and down. Similar to having the
longest panhard rod possible on a rear axle.
Another good idea mangled was the Variable Venturi carburetor.
But GM has also fumbled with new ideas too!
One glaring Chevy fault was the design of the 73-77? (not sure of years)
hood which buckled and broke the hood from poor structural stiffness.
But at least it was an easy fix if caught in time.........

Muto, how many miles does your 305A V6 have on it?

Only &quot;bad&quot; thing about my '63 is that the V6 is slower than a
VW Microbus going uphill in the mountains. How does yours
fare?

I will give you that, but in general there is really no difference! Some
years had other options, dual front shocks, etc. But the original post
compared GMC above Ford or Chevy.
Its kind of like comparing a '80's Chevy Caprice to a Pontiac Parisian of a

I beg to differ, I had a '64 Chev, coils all around. Chevy did not use torsion bars until lately with IFS 4x4. Coils in back ride better than leafs. Screw the dash, thats cosmetic.Axles are an option. I am talking major differences, body ,engine transmission. Any engine, trans you could get in a GM you could get in a Chev excluding the V-6.
Sure GMC's V-6 was a tank, a good engine, but I would not trade on for a 283 small block. That V-6 will run forever, but on the road it doesn't have enough power to get out of its own way!!
Many GMC's also used the same engines used in Chev's for the same year. There were more GMC's built with a straight 6 than the V-6.
Also, compare the differences in later years, not many off us are driving a 35-40 year old truck. Late model trucks have little or no differences. Not enough to separate them in a Ford vs. Chev vs. GM arguement! In my mind it should be a
Ford vs. Chev/GM arguement!

Okay, later years. 1980s GMC did not have to meet the smog controls that a
Chevy did. Made a world of difference in power. Company I worked for bought a
Chevy and a GMC 2-ton truck, same year, same chassis... major difference was
that the Chevy had *all* the smog/pollution equipment while the GMC didn't.
For some reason the Chevrolet is considered the &quot;car&quot; line and the GMC is the
Truck line. And they have to meet the smog/pollution criteria for that line.
The GMC definately had more power than the Chevy, and both with the 350 engine.

&gt; ...They must have changed at that year, unless the 1-tons had coils. ALL of the 60-63's Chevys I
&gt; have
&gt; ever seen have had the torsion bars in front. The hot-rodders usually put V8s in GMC because they

&gt; prefer the suspension.

&gt; Chevy did not use torsion bars until lately with IFS 4x4. Coils in back ride better than leafs

&gt; ...But are worse for hauling heavy stuff

&gt; . Screw the dash, thats cosmetic

&gt; ....Not quite. It is sheet metal integral with the cab body, and parts for the Chevy are
&gt; different.

&gt; .Axles are an option. I am talking major differences, body ,engine transmission. Any engine, trans
&gt; you could get in a GM you could get in a Chev excluding the V-6.

&gt; ....Don't think so. I have never in 15 years of junkyarding (and seeing 400+ trucks) have EVER
&gt; seen the
&gt; V6s in a Chevy. Ever. The only engines in the Chevy were straight 6s and V8s, and the only
&gt; ORIGINAL motors I've seen in the GMCs were V6s. Some had V8s, but they had been shoveled in later
&gt; by
&gt; unhappy owners!

&gt; ....Transmissions were alike though. I'm not sure what the difference in the axles were, apart
&gt; from
&gt; the suspension mounting. The GMC half-ton use a Dana 44, The Chevy half-ton has something
&gt; else, but fairly similar. The 3/4 ton and above (not too popular) probably shared axles.

&gt; ....The GMC had quad lights, which require a slightly different wiring loom.

&gt; .....OVERALL, I'm talking of differences that prevent easy swapping pf parts from one type to
&gt; another truck. You're looking at the big stuff.

&gt; Sure GMC's V-6 was a tank, a good engine, but I would not trade on for a 283 small block. That
&gt; V-6 will run forever, but on the road it doesn't have enough power to get out of its own way!!

&gt; Absolutely agreed! It's really something to be passed by a VW microbus going up the hill. He's
&gt; probably
&gt; getting 25mpg, I'm getting 8 at that point!!

&gt; Many GMC's also used the same engines used in Chev's for the same year. There were more GMC's
&gt; built with a straight 6 than the V-6.

&gt; Probably true, but only after 1963. In '64 and beyond they added the straight 6, and later yet
&gt; added the V8 in
&gt; hopes of picking up sales lost because of the V6s reputation.

&gt; Also, compare the differences in later years, not many off us are driving a 35-40 year old truck.

&gt; Out here in Californy the oldies are VERY common. I see several every day

&gt; Late model trucks have little or no differences. Not enough to separate them in a Ford vs. Chev
&gt; vs. GM arguement! In my mind it should be aFord vs. Chev/GM arguement!

&gt; Right! In the later years I don't see much difference apart from badging.

Owning 2 1961 GMCs and knowing several contractors who own early '60s Chevrolet
and GMC trucks, 60-63 used Torsion bar front suspension and coil spring on the
rear for 1/2 and 3/4 ton. Used Leaf on the rear of the 1 ton and up. Torsion
bars on the front of everything up to the 5000 series trucks with a *few*
applications showing leaf springs on the front. This covers all trucks from 1/2
ton on up through large busses and 5th wheel trucks (according to the '60-'61

It has about 250 000 miles or more on it, Im not sure because my grandpa gave me the truck. I dont know how many times the odometer has turned over! That would be my geuss. Its Still running great though! The top speed for mine is about 55 with large tires it can go more like 65 but thats pushin it!

Muto, how many miles does your 305A V6 have on it?
Only &quot;bad&quot; thing about my '63 is that the V6 is slower than a
VW Microbus going uphill in the mountains. How does yours
fare?

Cheers, Jeff

I rather dive GMC's than either of those two! I have friends who drive old GMC's and have for years. I happen to drive both Chevy, GMC, and Ford trucks! What I have seen is that the GMC beats them both! I had to get a new moter for my 70 Ford, I have also replaced the engine in my 65 Chevy! MY 60 GMC has the origonal 305 in it and is still running great. Its only supposed to be a half ton but I have put almost 2 tons on it before! It is a GREAT truck and I will keep it untill I DIE!

&gt; Had one of them.....just lube the hinges regularly, no problem! But I do
&gt; remember seeing a lot of buckled hoods!!

&gt;&gt;One glaring Chevy fault was the design of the 73-77? (not sure of years)
&gt;&gt;hood which buckled and broke the hood from poor structural stiffness.
&gt;&gt;But at least it was an easy fix if caught in time.........

Hate to say it but I have owned a few Fords and as fer the starters on
'em... they don't get shimmed like the Chevys do. Stuck with the Bowties
'cause of their universality of parts. Got a like bolting new model parts
on a '68 C-10. Not too many Fords have that claim to fame.

If it ain't broke... don't buy it!
Restore it yerself.

&gt; well for your information ford starters is alot easier than a chevy
&gt; because you dont have to change a ford starter its the chevys you have
&gt; to change becaue the are right beside the exhaust manofold and they get
&gt; hot and destroys the starter

Lord don't do what I just did. Just ran down the list of bitching about
this &quot;Chevys are junk&quot; with a wheel mouse. Got sick, a real dizzy kind
of sick! The kind of sick that makes me want to abandon the Chevy and
the Ford that I own and step into the light and but my first Dodge.
Those guys seem so quiet and keep to themselves. Y'all probably got
those stickers with the dude pissing on Blue Ovals and Bowties too,
right?

i saw a bumper sticker that said &quot; I would rather be pushing a chevy
than driving a ford&quot; thats funny.
the only thing funnier would be a chevy pulling/pushing a ford.

hi all
well let a chevy van owner put his .02c in.
the only thing wrong with chevrolet of old was body by fisher. down
here in fla they rusted out.the fords weren't as bad. dodges not at all
however my 71 chev van w/3 on a tree still has its original 307 engine
with 300k miles on it and hasn't needed a valve job since its only one
200k miles ago. it burns regular and on a good day highway mileage is
18mpg. a ford would be an exception to the rule to say that.
my suspension has grease fittings not rubber bushings that wear out
on fords and dodge. hey my vans a real LT.duty trk.
fords twin I beam suspension was so bad on tires the edges would wear
prematurely.
the power steering gear boxes @ $850 would wear out so fast even junk
yards were no source for them.
by the way ford now uses the same unequal arm suspension dodge and
chevy have been using for years. all kidding aside,with that said, i
would rather own an american ford than an imported rice burner.
