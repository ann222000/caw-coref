The question is, for nations with socialistic national health insurance
coverage: Ought they to cover the cost of cigarette smoker's ailments?

If health insurance is no longer given for smokers, then it stands to
reason (at least in an &quot;equal rights society&quot;) that any health problems
brought on as a willful act of a person should not be covered either. I
don't think healthcare should be that discriminatory, but I suppose
they might have to draw the line somewhere. My 2 cents

Okay, then, what would you say to simply raising the premiums for the
bad habit, provided that it's established that an individual is a
smoker?

That *is* a hard one. I'm sure most of us have unhealthy habits that
increase the cost of our healthcare. I guess if we sock it to the
tobacco companies (and I'm not dropping that idea just yet), it would
be only fair to sock it to McDonald's, too. Even I can't quite stomach
that. (I'm wholeheartedly with the lady that sued them after being
burned by their coffee, though.)

I guess the difference between food and tobacco is that no one needs to
smoke in order to live and tobacco smoke is not beneficial to any
degree to anyone's health even when used in moderation. Even McDonald's
food provides some nutrition.

I think that the risks of certain behaviors should be weighed and
quantified. The costs of the additional healthcare should be passed on
to both the patient and to the manufacturer of the harmful product if
applicable.

It's not remotely practical, though. You'd have to extort the money
from the companies considered responsible. You'd have to be able to
determine if people were being honest about their habits. You'd have no
way to extract the money from the poor. People start a lot of bad
habits while they are young and have no thought of their future
healthcare costs, so penalizing them for their behaviors years after
the fact isn't likely to prevent anything. If they don't care about the
risks of death by cancer, they aren't going to care about how much
money it will cost to die that way.

Not going to edit this as I should. Sorry for the typos, etc.

You know - I've been thinking a lot about the whole smoking thing. My
wife and I both smoke and so this is of no small concern to me. I
smoke both Marlboro's and I roll my own with Drum tobacco. If I light
a Marlboro and put it in an ashtray it will burn all the way to the
filter. If I light a Drum and don't smoke it, it will go out in less
than a minute. Shouldn't we try to get a law passed making it illegal
to add chemicals to cigarettes? Think about all the lives it would
save - not just from the reduced cancers, but also by eliminating the
number of people who die because they fell asleep with an incendiary
device in their hand

A couple of things. First of all - anyone who drives with a cup of hot
coffee between their legs deserves whatever they get. (and I don't mean
a multi-million dollar award for being a moron) Secondly, maybe if the
U.S. government wasn't so actively involved in supplying customers to
the tobacco and alcohol manufacturers it wouldn't be such a problem.
When I was in the army a carton of cigarettes was $1.70. Now, granted,
this was over 25 years ago, but still. 17 cents a pack? I was smoking
3 packs a day back then. (and probably still would be if they were that
cheap in real life. And as for booze - a 1.75 liter bottle of Jim Beam
cost us less than $5. So here you have the U.S. government turning out
chain smokers and alcoholics - ain't capitalism great?

I wonder whether it's the paper or the additives in the tobacco.
Marlboro is a bit on the famous side for the extras in the cigarettes.
What paper do you use for your tailor mades?

I suspect you are misinformed about the McDonald's coffee lawsuit. Here
is a brief summary:

In February 1992, Stella Liebeck of Albuquerque, New Mexico, was
severely burned after spilling hot McDonald's Coffee on her lap. Far
from being a frivolous award, the investigation into her case revealed
upwards of 700 similar documented cases of similar burns proving that
McDonald's knew its coffee was dangerously hot. Liebeck and her lawyers
sought a $20,000 settlement, but McDonald's refused. Instead, the court
awarded her $160,000 compensatory damages (reduced from $200,000
because they found Liebeck to be 20% at-fault) and $480,000 in punitive
damages.

She was not driving, BTW. She was a passenger in a stationary vehicle.

I was pretty surprised by what I read about this. It isn't what David
Letterman, etc made it out to be.

That link is being stupid. You have to click on&quot;not the whole story&quot; in
the first paragraph. Sorry for the inconvenience.
