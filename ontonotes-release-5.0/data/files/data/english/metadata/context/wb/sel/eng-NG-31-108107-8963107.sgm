I noticed that one too. It made me smile to myself. No one I know
really knows Phil. Nor do I if truth be known, but he did help me trap
Lucy(fur!!) &amp; I  am still very grateful for that. He gave me the
confidence to try &amp; now I've done two more since then as well. I have
found a new source to get traps from- The RSPCA come &amp; set one up for
me if I need one, &amp; their help really does make my life a lot easier.
Without that advice we would be without our Lucy(fur!!), &amp; that
doesn't bare thinking about. She is really a Tilly slaved for cat. In
fact I would go so far as to say she has Tilly right to heel, Lol..

Well done Phil. You deserve a bit of recognition for what you do. It's
no small thing, &amp; you do it very well. Be proud! You earned that
yourself through all those times you sat out in the searing heat,
waiting for the cats to take the bait &amp; you get the colony- the times
that you get one that simply won't fall for that trick, again.
I'm sure there must be hard times, but you deal with it &amp; you move on,
because you have to.. you don't moan &amp; you don't whine- you do!! You
have been a huge asset to this group &amp; everyone respects you here.
They know when they get advice from you, it is time to sort this issue
out, Now!

That is no small thing. Sometimes we rely on you too much. We don't
realise we are doing it, but you still try your best to help. I will
think twice before contacting you when it comes to asking you to take
in a cat or a kitten. Because we are not with you, we don't see that
you are already Sooo busy that you have kitties coming out the
rafters. I will think twice &amp; try everyone else 1st, to see if they
can help out first. I don't think we realise that we are doing this,
until you sit back &amp; look @ it from your point of view. If I had to, I
would, but I would  explore every other option first, so that we don't
over- rely on you too much. Thanks for all :o)

Your website is getting the attention it should do! You have most
things covered in there- &amp; if it isn't they still have the chance to
ask...!! Thank you for being there when we ask help from you- You do
your best to help us. We appreciate that Phil.
