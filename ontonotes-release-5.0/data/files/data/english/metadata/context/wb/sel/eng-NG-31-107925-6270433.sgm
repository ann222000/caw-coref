They will say his name every 10 seconds, or more frequently, even if he does
go out on the first lap. He's a foreigner and therefor they think he's better
and more interesting than a plain old American driver. Of course what they
don't realize is that the foreigners will destroy NASCAR just like they did
CART (now reincarnated as ChumpCar which is also about to go belly up) and the
IRL which is losing more U.S. fans with each passing season. Who wants to
support a driver whose name you can't even pronounce in English?

You mean like Giuseppe Paolo DiMaggio, Jr., the All-American boy?

Or does it just apply to drivers like Mario Andretti?

Help me understand what you're trying to say....

Is it that NASCAR shouldn't use the best drivers they can get?  Or is it
that NASCAR should limit drivers in the series to only Americans?

NASCAR claims that they have the best drivers.  So is it your idea to
dummy down the series talent?

Would it be better for you if there were no foreign-based manufacturers
in NASCAR?  Get rid of Toyota in cup?

Would you ban Michael Waltrip because he's from another planet?

Would you ban Jimmy Johnson because he looks like Brooke Shield?

JPM lives in the states.  Most of the OWRS and IRL drivers live in teh

Mario Andretti was born in Italy.  From your answer that disqualifies him.

Johnny boy wouldn't even be in NASCAR if NASCAR wasn't trying to reach *a
new fan base*.  Montoya was pretty much washed up in F1 and wasn't going to
make much money in CART so he had no choice but to come to NASCAR and be the
new South American face for NASCAR.  let's face the facts, he might win a
race somewhere along the way......hell Mike Waltrip even won the D'500 so
anything is possible, but John Montoya will never be a big name in CUP or
BUSCH.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Is it that NASCAR shouldn't use the best drivers they can get?  Or is it
&gt; &gt;&gt; that NASCAR should limit drivers in the series to only Americans?

&gt; &gt;&gt; NASCAR claims that they have the best drivers.  So is it your idea to
&gt; &gt;&gt; dummy down the series talent?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Would it be better for you if there were no foreign-based manufacturers
&gt; &gt;&gt; in NASCAR?  Get rid of Toyota in cup?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Would you ban Michael Waltrip because he's from another planet?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Would you ban Jimmy Johnson because he looks like Brooke Shield?- Hide quoted text -

No - Toyota is a foreign manufacturer with plants in the United States.
That they assemble cars here does not change the fact that they manufacture

Now this is a philosophy I can warm to.  NASCAR racing in all three of its
top tier forms has suffered from a lack of driver gut.  A driver who brings
a renewed desire to get out there and mix it up and go for the win, will
indeed bring back an element of excitement and freshness to the sport.  I've
had enough of the cookie cutter drivers as well.

CART doesn't exist anymore, it went bankrupt. And the IRL is losing U.S.
viewership. Open wheel is dying in the U.S. even though I agree it seems to
have remained popular elsewhere in the world. You need to ask yourself why if
the racing was so good. My contention is that U.S. fans can't relate to the
drivers or their cookie cutter cars. It's a path that NASCAR seems to be
headed down as well. They already have template spec cookie cutter cars and
are starting to bring in non-American drivers.

I never tried to claim that open wheel isn't popular outside the U.S. If fans
elsewhere like to watch cookie cutter cars operated by foreign drivers I'm all
for it. It still won't have any relevance to the U.S. sports scene. The Indy
500 used to be a premier sporting event, now they have trouble filling the
field and the stands are half empty. The biggest race in Indiana these days is
the Brickyard 400. And the F1 drivers just quit last year during the
opening lap but they called it a race anyway with 5 cars so they could screw
the few fans in attendance and not give them a refund. This was at the same
time their leader was calling women no better than kitchen appliances. Like I
said, open wheel is irrelevant in the U.S. and on a steep decline.

Again another claim that is made up. I never said unpronounceable names were

During its season, soccer (indoor and outdoor) draws more fans than
NASCAR.  Even in the U.S.  Period.  Is it a dominant sport?  No.  But
its not really a mainstream sport like baseball or football.  Its a
specialized sport with its roots in grade school and high school; its
fans are young and the parents of players.  But there's a gazillion of
them.  So it is a relevant sport.

are you talking all soccer all year?? Euopean, South American, Asian and US
combined because there you might have a point. NASCAR draws CUP fans over a
36+ week schedule and averages about 90K per CUP race, not including BUSCH
series and TRUCK Sister weekends.

the NYY's sell out EVERY home game....that's 52k+ and since they play about
1/2 the season at home that's about 80 games, over 4 million people every
season.
