Rowers.  This sounds like a great idea.  I know we had a lot of fun a couple of years ago, so put May 5th on your calendar.  We will be working up some crews.

Hi Roger,

I trust you had a good board meeting this morning.  It was a good enough day to get out on the water, but  home chores kept me grounded.

In talking with Stan Cummings and Steve, I proposed the idea of sending a set of wooden boats to the opening day parade in Seattle on May 5.  As you recall the Nails paraded several years ago in a wooden eight.  I understand that the parade is interested in having some wooden shells again this year, and Stan and Steve are especially interested in highlighting the Pocock singles project there, including a display of the first completed shell.  My idea was to have Steve row his own Pocock single, perhaps with Alice in hers also, followed by the wooden double, the wooden triple, the Oho, perhaps the Ron Neal, and then the Quinault.  It could be a good show with the complete lineup of wooden shells.  We may be the only club around with that variety of operating wooden shells.  Assuming we can line up enough rowers, and that we can complete the repair work on the Quinault and Oho, the only cost would be the $80-$100 for gas for someone to haul the trailer over.  What do you think?

Thanks

John

Roger......Opening Day would be great fun, please sign me up.  Also would anyone be interested in joining me for the Level 1 Coaching Clinic on February 17th at Green Lake?  I figure it would be useful just to coach myself.
Regards to all,
Patricia
