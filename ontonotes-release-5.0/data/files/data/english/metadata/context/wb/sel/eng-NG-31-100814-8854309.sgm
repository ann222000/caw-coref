A man goes to visit his doctor,

&quot;Well how do they sound?&quot; enquires the doctor.

&quot;They make a HONDA sound&quot;

The doctor looks puzzled, &quot;Hmm, is there anything else I should know?&quot;

&quot;Well I also have a terrible boil on my arse,&quot; replies the man

The doctor looks pleased, &quot;Thats it then. We'll lance that boil and you'll see a difference immediately,&quot;

&quot;Why's that then, Doc?&quot; asks the man

&quot;It's well known,&quot; laughs the Doctor, &quot;Abscess makes the fart go Honda.&quot;

fart:
Function: intransitive verb
Unpleasant onomatopoetic word to indicate an explosion. References are
recurrent in the anals of literature of which graffiti are fart and parcel.

The old ones are the best... mind you, the punchline was &quot;absinthe

years ago.

I read it in one of the bike mags, not quite so many years ago,
probably 25 or so. I think it was an abscess then, I couldn't remember
the whole thing so googled it, I knew I'd find it somewhere :-)
