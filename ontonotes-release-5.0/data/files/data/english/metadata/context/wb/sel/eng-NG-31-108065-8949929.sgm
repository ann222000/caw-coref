Hello all,

First of all, i'm a newbie. i just moved into a house from an
apartment, and the idea of having an organic kitchen garden has always
excited me, so i built one, and i've got a few crops going now that
are coming out well so far.

The okra, pumpkin vines, spearmint, pepper, and basil plants are
thriving in the soil, and doing very well. I live in central Florida.

My problem: my Heatwave tomato plants have wilted over the past 2
days, even with the same amount of water and plant food and
temperature that they're used to. the only thing different i can
imagine is that a few days ago i bought some Round Up that said it was
safe for use in flower and vegetable gardens to kill some grass and
weeds that had popped up around the tomato plants. However i didn't
use much of it, just enough to get the grass and weed seedlings, and i
thought it should be safe around the plants. but as of now the tomato
plants have their leaves drooped down, very weak and soft, and they
look pretty pathetic.

The other plants that i did not spray the roundup near are doing well
still.

Would that have caused the problem, or can you imagine anything else?
Is there anything i can do to reverse them wilting and dying before
it's too late?

Thanks!

Paul

How much water &amp; &quot;plant food&quot;. What type food? If your weather is like
mine in NC, then it might just be about time for the tomatoes to go...

You need to pull weeds, not use chemicals, especially around food. The
tomatoes are toast, pull them and learn.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Then don't spray near them and they'll be fine.

Go to the library and get a book on organic gardening, there are many.
One universal theme is no use of chemicals to control weeds, and no
chemical fertilizer to feed the plants, instead, you feed the soil
with compost and mulches.  There is much more, read and ask questions.

Thanks for the input. As i said, i'm a newbie, i didn't even think
about the fact that the stuff to kill weeds would be just as bad as
insecticides. I've been using an organic &quot;insecticide&quot; which contains
canola oil and sesame oil that i spray on the leaves to prevent
caterpillars and such.

So, let's forget the organic thing, even in a non-organic garden Round
Up doesn't actually work without killing the plant?

Also, how do you feed with compost after they've been planted? I've
mixed compost in the soil when i plant them, but can i just sprinkle
compost near the base and they'll absorb it?

For annuals like tomatoes, mixing a suitable amount of compost into
the soil at the start of each season should be enough.  It is
naturally slow-release, especially if you avoid washing out nutrients
by excessive watering.

For perennials like turf grass, flowers, etc, or if you prefer not to
till, yes you can spread compost on the soil and let the rain and
earthworms distribute nutrients.  One common version of this is to
mulch with an organic mulch like wood chips, leaves, coffee grounds,
etc, and let it eventually decompose.  You can also fertilize with
liquid organic fertilizers like compost tea, compost leachate, or fish
emulsion.

Round up is an organic chemical, see the formula below,

MOLECULAR FORMULA:  C3 H8 NO5 P (glyphosate); C6 H17 N2 O5 P
(glyphosate-mono(isopropylammonium)) (62).

There are three carbon atoms in glyphosate and six in glyphosate-mono
(isopropylammonium.

Fish emulsion is good for nitrogen but the others don't supply it. You
need to add manure or rotate crop with legumes (beans, peas, clover,
ect) that are nitrogen fixers.

Some plants like tomato are super sensitive to RoundUp.  Had a fellow
garden learn the hard way not to use it around tomatoes.  He even
tried painting it on weeds near the tomatoes and still killed the
tomatoes.

You need to apply it on the beds before planting.  After planting you
pretty much need to use other methods of weeding.  Using a corse spray
helps prevent drifting it to other areas.

Compost is best mixed in the beds before planting but it doesn't hurt
to add it on top after planting.

Roundup is safe to plant in the NEXT day, but I would not reccomend
using it withing 20' of growing plants.

Round Up will kill any plant whose leaves it gets on.  I have used it
in my tomato beds with no problem.  I have a dispenser which puts out
a foam.  I put the wand almost on the weed and it does not spread to
the neighboring plants.

Check out this site for information on tomato problems.

And check with your local extension service.  You can locate yours
here. http://www.csrees.usda.gov/Extension/index.html

Last year I swore that my husband got Round Up on some of my tomatoes.
After we talked to a biologist I realized that it was not Round Up but
some other problem.

Thanks for the straightforward answer. I tried my hardest not to get
it on the plant, i did do a direct foam onto each weed and i was about
an inch away from each weed when i sprayed, whereas my tomato plants
were about 2' tall. so maybe it was another problem, or maybe my
plants were really sensitive. either way, i've since pulled them and
i'll try again.

I am curious.  If you are going to all that trouble to spray the weed, why
don't you just pull it/them?  It makes so much more sense to me to do that
since you are taking the time anyway.  Just for the record, it is a
serious question, not a criticism.  When I see weeds out there, I just
start pulling them.  They go great in the compost bin or into the chicken
yard  I guess there is a sort of therapy in pulling them up; if the area
is freshly watered, it's so easy.

I have done that, but like all americans i guess i wanted to take the

I wish you much success for the rest of your gardening.  We newbies do
some things we later consider a bit odd later as we learn more.  I
remember the first year I had this house  (closed in May) and my first
almost garden which consisted of only tomato plants in an area about 10x10
feet.  I knew nothing much at all, planted the tomato plants about two
feet apart (yep!), had not a clue about cages or such.  After all, my
grandparents grew tomatoes for market, acres of them, and didn't stake.
So much for determinate versus indeterminate of which I knew nothing.  You
plant, it grows, simple.  In theory. LOL!  When the plants went all over
the place, my husband said, &quot;Why do you think they call them *vines*?&quot;  So
much for that.  Also, that first year, I treated them like they were
truly fragile, something I find very amusing now - as long as we are
reasonably careful, they usually do very well.  My husband, who had worked
at a large-city sewage treatment plant when it was being expanded in the
seventies, also said to me, &quot;Remember how I told you at the plant, we'd
have tomato plants randomly growing?  Those came from seeds in the
sewage.&quot;  Well, that's food for thought regarding their hardiness
considering the extreme treatment of the processing done.

I even talked to them as I put them in the ground.  Still do, but not for
the same reason, now it's just out of habit rather than thinking it will
make a difference.&lt;g&gt;  If one could put a clip of me planting that first
tomato plant next to the one of the way I plant now, it would be comical.
That is not to say I'm careless, just realistic.  I still dig the large
planting hole, mix a little fertilizer (natural), a handful of sweet lime
(calcium) into the bottom of the planting hole, fill it with water, set in
the plant, fill it again, and fill in the dirt, and thinking nothing more
about it.  I just don't do it like the world depends on it.  After laying
the soaker hose, mulching, adding the cages, all that is left is to turn
on the faucet for water, pull a few weeds (mulch keeps them at a minimum)
and harvest.

Around here (Portland, Oregon, area), we have had a cool August so it has
only been this past week that our tomatoes have been getting ripe.  Up
until now, one would have thought it was early or mid-July.  Mine were at
the end of August like the usual third week of July!  Now that we have had
some seasonal weather, the tomatoes (and everything else) are responding
very well.  Now, if we can only have enough warm weather left for most of
the green tomatoes to ripen, that will be good.

You will find each year is completely different.  The best thing is to
just keep on doing it and noting the results from what you have done each
year.  As I said, I wish you much luck and success and satisfaction from
your gardening endeavors.

&gt; remember the first year I had this house  (closed in May) and my first

&gt; feet.  I knew nothing much at all, planted the tomato plants about two
&gt; feet apart (yep!), had not a clue about cages or such.  After all, my
&gt; grandparents grew tomatoes for market, acres of them, and didn't stake.
&gt; So much for determinate versus indeterminate of which I knew nothing.  You
&gt; plant, it grows, simple.  In theory. LOL!  When the plants went all over
&gt; the place, my husband said, &quot;Why do you think they call them *vines*?&quot;  So
&gt;  much for that.  Also, that first year, I treated them like they were
&gt; truly fragile, something I find very amusing now - as long as we are
&gt; reasonably careful, they usually do very well.  My husband, who had worked
&gt; at a large-city sewage treatment plant when it was being expanded in the
&gt; seventies, also said to me, &quot;Remember how I told you at the plant, we'd
&gt; have tomato plants randomly growing?  Those came from seeds in the
&gt; sewage.&quot;  Well, that's food for thought regarding their hardiness
&gt; considering the extreme treatment of the processing done.

&gt; I even talked to them as I put them in the ground.  Still do, but not for
&gt; the same reason, now it's just out of habit rather than thinking it will
&gt; make a difference.&lt;g&gt;  If one could put a clip of me planting that first
&gt; tomato plant next to the one of the way I plant now, it would be comical.
&gt; That is not to say I'm careless, just realistic.  I still dig the large
&gt; planting hole, mix a little fertilizer (natural), a handful of sweet lime
&gt; (calcium) into the bottom of the planting hole, fill it with water, set in
&gt; the plant, fill it again, and fill in the dirt, and thinking nothing more
&gt; about it.  I just don't do it like the world depends on it.  After laying
&gt; the soaker hose, mulching, adding the cages, all that is left is to turn
&gt; on the faucet for water, pull a few weeds (mulch keeps them at a minimum)
&gt; and harvest.

&gt; Around here (Portland, Oregon, area), we have had a cool August so it has
&gt; only been this past week that our tomatoes have been getting ripe.  Up
&gt; until now, one would have thought it was early or mid-July.  Mine were at
&gt; the end of August like the usual third week of July!  Now that we have had
&gt; some seasonal weather, the tomatoes (and everything else) are responding
&gt; very well.  Now, if we can only have enough warm weather left for most of
&gt; the green tomatoes to ripen, that will be good.

&gt; You will find each year is completely different.  The best thing is to
&gt; just keep on doing it and noting the results from what you have done each
&gt; year.  As I said, I wish you much luck and success and satisfaction from
&gt; your gardening endeavors.

Thanks! I am learning what not to do more than i'm learning what TO
do. But my other plants are doing really well, so i'm not disappointed
that i'll just have to try and have a strong crop of tomatoes next
season. After all, it is a bit late to get them started again now,
right? I do live in florida, so it's hot or at least warm until mid-
december.

Tomatoes require a fairly narrow nighttime temperature to set their
fruit, and reasonably warm weather to do much growing.  So I don't
really know Florida, but I'd probably think in terms of planting cool
weather crops at this time of year.  Things like Spinach and Kale you
probably can grow all winter (even here in Washington, DC, we can grow
them well into the fall and early in the spring).

You can take cuttings from your other tomatoes.  Either cut the
suckers or else tips about 10&quot; long and put them in water.  They'll
develope a good set of roots in about 10 days.  Give them shade till
established when you plant them in the soil.  Unless your varieties
have a long maturity period you should get a crop.

Maybe the following will help.

http://ottawahortiphilia.blogspot.com/2007/06/rooting-tomato-cutting....

Tomatoes root so easily that it really don't matter much what and
where you cut.  Just cut off a few new shoots the size of young plants
and stick it in water.  I like using a cutting in a bottle.

You might be able to google and find some pictures.
