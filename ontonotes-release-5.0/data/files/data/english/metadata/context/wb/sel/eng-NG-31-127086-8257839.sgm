The Doctor Will See You‹In Three Months

http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_28/b4042072.htm

&lt;excerpts&gt;

&quot;The health-care reform debate is in full roar with the arrival of
Michael Moore's documentary Sicko, which compares the U.S. system
unfavorably with single-payer systems around the world. Critics of the
film are quick to trot out a common defense of the American way: For
all its problems, they say, U.S. patients at least don't have to endure
the endless waits for medical care endemic to government-run systems.
The lobbying group America's Health Insurance Plans spells it out in a
rebuttal to Sicko: &quot;The American people do not support a government
takeover of the entire health-care system because they know that means
long waits for rationed care.&quot;

In reality, both data and anecdotes show that the American people are
already waiting as long or longer than patients living with universal
health-care systems.

.... The Commonwealth study did find one area where the U.S. was first
by a wide margin: 51% of sick Americans surveyed did not visit a
doctor, get a needed test, or fill a prescription within the past two
years because of cost. No other country came close.&quot;

Just because you disagree with something doesn't make it &quot;total and
utter BS.&quot; You can't just pick what facts you like, and ignore those
you don't. If you have evidence contradicting this study that would be
better than a blanket dismissal.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

I don't know any doctor, any place where you don't have to wait to see
him in anything but an emergency basis. If you find you never have to
wait, I would assume your insider status, even more than your
insurance, is the cause though good insurance helps. I have a doctor I
see regularly for fibro, a rheumatologist and one of the few docs in
this area (aka Upstate New York, home to several million people) that
understands fibro. It can takes 3 months to get in to see him, and he
is in Albany, the state capital. It can six months to see a neurologist
in the nearest major city.

Seriously Hawki, you are going to have a tough time trying to convince
the majority of people that wait times don't exist in the US, since
most people have actually experienced having to wait to get a procedure
done. Wait times are inevitable in any system as there aren't an
infinite number of doctors and the only question is who waits more, and
the evidence suggests that for most things, we wait longer than most
countries.

No one said it was. It is, however, a fact of life for many people,
including those with insurance, that they forgo medical care due to
inability to afford co-pays and meds.

&quot;As nurses, we never worry about costs, billing, whether a procedure
will be covered or anything like that. I never have to worry about
whether one of my patients will get the treatment or care they need,&quot;
wrote Bev Dick, RN, vice president of the United Nurses of Alberta
wrote in a Portsmouth (NH) Herald commentary July 1. &quot;That's the reason
nurses are so supportive of our public system. And we have fought to
protect it.&quot;

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/deborah-burger/ugly-health-care-waiting-_b
_55749.html

&quot;But, here's the dirty little secret that they won't tell you. Waiting
times in the U.S. are as bad as or worse than Canada. And, unlike the
U.S., in Canada no one is denied needed medical care, referrals, or
diagnostic tests due to cost, pre-existing conditions, or because it
wasn't pre-approved.

U.S. waiting times are like the elephant in the room few of the critics
care to address. Listen to what the chief medical officer of Aetna had
to say in March.

Speaking to the Aetna Investor's Conference 2007, Troy Brennan let
these nuggets drop:

* The U.S. &quot;healthcare system is not timely.&quot;
* Recent statistics from the Institution of Healthcare Improvement
document &quot;that people are waiting an average of about 70 days to see a
provider.&quot;
* &quot;In many circumstances people initially diagnosed with cancer are
waiting over a month, which is intolerable.&quot;
* In his former stint as an administrator and head of a physicians'
organization he spent much of his time trying &quot;to find appointments for
people with doctors.&quot;

Statistics Canada's latest figures show that median wait times for
elective surgery in Canada is now three weeks -- that's less time than
Aetna's chief medical officer says Americans typically wait after being
diagnosed with cancer.&quot;

That is a shocking statistic and one that should give everyone pause to
wonder how we could ever have gotten to a place like that.

If you were to pose a question about this to a room full of people, what
percentage do you think would first find a way to blame it on the people
who went without the medical care?

We see a small percentage here, but I bet it's a lot larger in the
general population.

First of all, any country CAN afford decent universal health care with
short wait times IF they are willing to pay the actual costs for it.

And second, when someone criticizes you (figuratively) and you point to
the other guy and say I'm fine because he is worse, is that really such

We can do the job right or we can do a half-assed job. Either way, there
will be bitching. But will universal healthcare cut down dramatically on
the number of people who die for lack of any medical care? I think so.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The Doctor Will See You &gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_28/b4042072.htm

&gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;excerpts&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;The health-care reform debate is in full roar with the arrival of
&gt;&gt;&gt; Michael Moore's documentary Sicko, which compares the U.S. system
&gt;&gt;&gt; unfavorably with single-payer systems around the world. Critics of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; film are quick to trot out a common defense of the American way: For
&gt;&gt;&gt; all its problems, they say, U.S. patients at least don't have to endure
&gt;&gt;&gt; the endless waits for medical care endemic to government-run systems.
&gt;&gt;&gt; The lobbying group America's Health Insurance Plans spells it out in a
&gt;&gt;&gt; rebuttal to Sicko: &quot;The American people do not support a government
&gt;&gt;&gt; takeover of the entire health-care system because they know that means
&gt;&gt;&gt; long waits for rationed care.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; In reality, both data and anecdotes show that the American people are
&gt;&gt;&gt; already waiting as long or longer than patients living with universal
&gt;&gt;&gt; health-care systems.

&gt;&gt; this is total and utter bs....

&gt; Just because you disagree with something doesn't make it &quot;total and
&gt; utter BS.&quot; You can't just pick what facts you like, and ignore those
&gt; you don't. If you have evidence contradicting this study that would be
&gt; better than a blanket dismissal.

&gt;&gt; call me an insider with decent insurance (which I pay dearly for)...but
&gt;&gt; NEVER have hubby or I or any family members been put on waiting lists...

&gt; I don't know any doctor, any place where you don't have to wait to see
&gt; him in anything but an emergency basis. If you find you never have to
&gt; wait, I would assume your insider status, even more than your
&gt; insurance, is the cause though good insurance helps. I have a doctor I
&gt; see regularly for fibro, a rheumatologist and one of the few docs in
&gt; this area (aka Upstate New York, home to several million people) that
&gt; understands fibro. It can takes 3 months to get in to see him, and he
&gt; is in Albany, the state capital. It can six months to see a neurologist
&gt; in the nearest major city.

&gt; Seriously Hawki, you are going to have a tough time trying to convince
&gt; the majority of people that wait times don't exist in the US, since
&gt; most people have actually experienced having to wait to get a procedure
&gt; done. Wait times are inevitable in any system as there aren't an
&gt; infinite number of doctors and the only question is who waits more, and
&gt; the evidence suggests that for most things, we wait longer than most
&gt; countries.

&gt;&gt;&gt; .... The Commonwealth study did find one area where the U.S. was first
&gt;&gt;&gt; by a wide margin: 51% of sick Americans surveyed did not visit a
&gt;&gt;&gt; doctor, get a needed test, or fill a prescription within the past two
&gt;&gt;&gt; years because of cost. No other country came close.&quot;

&gt;&gt; the above is not an example of a waiting list ....

&gt; No one said it was. It is, however, a fact of life for many people,
&gt; including those with insurance, that they forgo medical care due to
&gt; inability to afford co-pays and meds.

Any one person's experience is anecdotal evidence at best. When my spinal
tumor was discovered, I had to wait for 2 months to get a needle biopsy to
find out if it was malignant or not (2 MONTHS to find out if i had cancer!),
this is while I worked at Mayo Clinic, and was insured by same (that's about
as insider as I know of). When I returned to Kansas afterwards for further
opinions,  I had a 1.5 month wait for a Neurosurgeon, but then afterwards,
Ive had little if any wait times. With my PCP I can often get same day appts,
but he practices in a town of 5,000. Wait times in larger city centers, or in
high reputation med centers will always have proportionally long wait times
in my opinion....or at least as my anecdotal evidence indicates.

&gt; surgeries,,MRIs etc

The *only* waiting lists in Canada are for elective surgeries. There
are no waiting &quot;lists&quot; for emergency surgeries or any other problems.

There are two main problems with comparing &quot;wait times&quot; in the US vs
Canada, or throughout Canada. Firstly, every province in Canada uses
different criteria for &quot;wait times.&quot; Some measure waiting time from
when the person first goes to his primary care to point of surgery.
Others measure from the time the person sees a specialist to the time
they have surgery. There are other criteria as well. Because it is not
uniform, it is difficult to come up with an exact figure for wait
times, but certainly if you look at the data the majority of people,
undergoing the majority of procedures, are not waiting anything like a
year. In fact, I could see only one province where even 1 percent of
people waited over 182 days for *any* procedure. The median wait time
is now 3 weeks, and it is a small minority that have to wait a long
time in Canada.

The other issue is that the US government does not maintain data on
wait times, nor do the governments of many other countries with
universal health care. The Commonwealth Fund study I cited is one of
the first to actually study the wait times in multiple countries, and
come up with a meaningful comparison. I am sorry you feel the need to
dismiss it out of hand, because almost everything else you're reading
out there is based on anecdotal evidence, speculation and, in some
cases, blatant exaggeration. The Commonwealth study showed that people
in Canada do indeed wait longer for non-emergency specialist care than
in the US, but US citizens wait longer for regular doctor visits than
any other country besides Canada. Germany was tops for lowest wait
times, which is not surprising as it also has the largest number of
doctors and nurses of all countries surveyed.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; tell me WHERE one waits  (Canadian and UK data)...10 + months for heart
&gt; surgery...a year or so for joint replacement surgery...etc etc

&gt; getting in to see a doctor is not a &quot;wait&quot;...it is called triage..
">

Rationing occurs in every system. In Canada, rationing takes the form
of long waits, but those who are most at risk get seen promtly. In the
US, rationing takes the form of people being denied treatment
altogether. Which do you think works better for most people: waiting,
or being denied?

Another topic that isn't often raised in this debate is that the US
leads the world in unnecesssary surgeries and procedures, a reality
that led to the creation of HMOs and bureaucratic oversight of doctors
in the first place. So people with really good insurance are being
convinced by unscrupulous doctors to get procedures they don't really
need or are questionable as this makes them $$$, and those without
insurance or with poor insurance are being denied treatment altogether,
both by doctors and by insurance companies. The profit motive creates
incentives to exploit patients in one way and deny them necessary
treatments in others.

There are no &quot;waiting lists&quot; in the US, but people do have to wait.
Even the chief medical officer of Aetna said wait times for procedures
like cancer surgery can be over a month on average. Add on to that the
time it takes to see your PC and the specialist in the first place. Do
you know something he doesn't?

You also have insider status, so your particular experience is not only
anecdotal, but is not representative of what most people go through.
I'm sure if you know somebody or are connected in Canada or anywhere
else, you get seen way before the rest of the herd as well.
Professional courtesy exists everywhere. Beyond that, money always
talks.

That is certainly not typical in the US, where people often wait for
over a month for such procedures. You keep forgetting you have insider
status, and that counts for a lot.

&gt; &gt; &quot;But, here's the dirty little secret that they won't tell you. Waiting
&gt; &gt; times in the U.S. are as bad as or worse than Canada. And, unlike the
&gt; &gt; U.S., in Canada no one is denied needed medical care, referrals, or
&gt; &gt; diagnostic tests due to cost, pre-existing conditions, or because it
&gt; &gt; wasn't pre-approved.

&gt; &gt; U.S. waiting times are like the elephant in the room few of the critics
&gt; &gt; care to address. Listen to what the chief medical officer of Aetna had
&gt; &gt; to say in March.

&gt; &gt; Speaking to the Aetna Investor's Conference 2007, Troy Brennan let
&gt; &gt; these nuggets drop:

&gt; &gt;    * The U.S. &quot;healthcare system is not timely.&quot;
&gt; &gt;    * Recent statistics from the Institution of Healthcare Improvement
&gt; &gt; document &quot;that people are waiting an average of about 70 days to see a
&gt; &gt; provider.&quot;
&gt; &gt;    * &quot;In many circumstances people initially diagnosed with cancer are
&gt; &gt; waiting over a month, which is intolerable.&quot;
&gt; &gt;    * In his former stint as an administrator and head of a physicians'
&gt; &gt; organization he spent much of his time trying &quot;to find appointments for
&gt; &gt; people with doctors.&quot;

&gt; &gt; Statistics Canada's latest figures show that median wait times for
&gt; &gt; elective surgery in Canada is now three weeks -- that's less time than
&gt; &gt; Aetna's chief medical officer says Americans typically wait after being
&gt; &gt; diagnosed with cancer.&quot;

&gt; total and utter bs...wait times in Canada can easily be up to a year
">

Do you have a cite for a study that shows that *median wait times*,
which is what Stats Canada is reporting, are up to a year? We are
talking median here, which means that 50 percent are seen in less than
3 weeks, and 50 percent more than 3 weeks. That doesn't preclude the
possibility of someone waiting for a year for a procedure, but
certainly at least half do not wait more than 3 weeks. Based on what I
have read, I have seen no evidence of anyone waiting over 182 days for
anything, but there are certainly anecdotal reports in the right-wing
media of people waiting a year. Do you have something solid to back
your assertion? If not, I'll stick with the facts at hand.

&gt;The Doctor Will See You‹In Three Months

&gt;&lt;excerpts&gt;

&gt;&quot;The health-care reform debate is in full roar with the arrival of
&gt;Michael Moore's documentary Sicko, which compares the U.S. system
&gt;unfavorably with single-payer systems around the world. Critics of the
&gt;film are quick to trot out a common defense of the American way: For
&gt;all its problems, they say, U.S. patients at least don't have to endure
&gt;the endless waits for medical care endemic to government-run systems.
&gt;The lobbying group America's Health Insurance Plans spells it out in a
&gt;rebuttal to Sicko: &quot;The American people do not support a government
&gt;takeover of the entire health-care system because they know that means
&gt;long waits for rationed care.&quot;

&gt;In reality, both data and anecdotes show that the American people are
&gt;already waiting as long or longer than patients living with universal
&gt;health-care systems.

&gt;.... The Commonwealth study did find one area where the U.S. was first
&gt;by a wide margin: 51% of sick Americans surveyed did not visit a
&gt;doctor, get a needed test, or fill a prescription within the past two
&gt;years because of cost. No other country came close.&quot;

Six months for my mom to get a hip replacement. Four months prior to
that to get the surgical evaluation appointment. She has Tri Care she
picks the doctor with the only approval needed is that from her PCP.
It is the closest thing to self pay and the wait is still long.

It took two months to see if UCSF Pain Clinic would see me and three
months later I saw a doctor.

Nope, no wait with our current system.

&gt;&gt; &gt; better than a blanket dismissal.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; call me an insider with decent insurance (which I pay dearly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for)...but
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; NEVER have hubby or I or any family members been put on waiting
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lists...

&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't know any doctor, any place where you don't have to wait to see
&gt;&gt; &gt; him in anything but an emergency basis.

&gt;&gt; the &quot;waiting lists&quot; I am referring to are for TREATMENT once ordered..ie
&gt;&gt; surgeries,,MRIs etc

&gt; The *only* waiting lists in Canada are for elective surgeries. There
&gt; are no waiting &quot;lists&quot; for emergency surgeries or any other problems.

&gt; There are two main problems with comparing &quot;wait times&quot; in the US vs
&gt; Canada, or throughout Canada. Firstly, every province in Canada uses
&gt; different criteria for &quot;wait times.&quot; Some measure waiting time from
&gt; when the person first goes to his primary care to point of surgery.
&gt; Others measure from the time the person sees a specialist to the time
&gt; they have surgery. There are other criteria as well. Because it is not
&gt; uniform, it is difficult to come up with an exact figure for wait
&gt; times, but certainly if you look at the data the majority of people,
&gt; undergoing the majority of procedures, are not waiting anything like a
&gt; year. In fact, I could see only one province where even 1 percent of
&gt; people waited over 182 days for *any* procedure. The median wait time
&gt; is now 3 weeks, and it is a small minority that have to wait a long
&gt; time in Canada.

&gt; The other issue is that the US government does not maintain data on
&gt; wait times, nor do the governments of many other countries with
&gt; universal health care. The Commonwealth Fund study I cited is one of
&gt; the first to actually study the wait times in multiple countries, and
&gt; come up with a meaningful comparison. I am sorry you feel the need to
&gt; dismiss it out of hand, because almost everything else you're reading
&gt; out there is based on anecdotal evidence, speculation and, in some
&gt; cases, blatant exaggeration. The Commonwealth study showed that people
&gt; in Canada do indeed wait longer for non-emergency specialist care than
&gt; in the US, but US citizens wait longer for regular doctor visits than
&gt; any other country besides Canada. Germany was tops for lowest wait
&gt; times, which is not surprising as it also has the largest number of
&gt; doctors and nurses of all countries surveyed.

&gt;&gt; tell me WHERE one waits  (Canadian and UK data)...10 + months for heart
&gt;&gt; surgery...a year or so for joint replacement surgery...etc etc

&gt;&gt; getting in to see a doctor is not a &quot;wait&quot;...it is called triage..

&gt; Rationing occurs in every system. In Canada, rationing takes the form
&gt; of long waits, but those who are most at risk get seen promtly. In the
&gt; US, rationing takes the form of people being denied treatment
&gt; altogether. Which do you think works better for most people: waiting,
&gt; or being denied?

&gt; Another topic that isn't often raised in this debate is that the US
&gt; leads the world in unnecesssary surgeries and procedures, a reality
&gt; that led to the creation of HMOs and bureaucratic oversight of doctors
&gt; in the first place. So people with really good insurance are being
&gt; convinced by unscrupulous doctors to get procedures they don't really
&gt; need or are questionable as this makes them $$$, and those without
&gt; insurance or with poor insurance are being denied treatment altogether,
&gt; both by doctors and by insurance companies. The profit motive creates
&gt; incentives to exploit patients in one way and deny them necessary
&gt; treatments in others.

&gt;&gt;  If you find you never have to
&gt;&gt; &gt; wait, I would assume your insider status, even more than your
&gt;&gt; &gt; insurance, is the cause though good insurance helps.

&gt;&gt; sorry...I simply call in...do I get seen the same day?? course not...can
&gt;&gt; I
&gt;&gt; see my ortho in a few days ...always (or one of his associates if he is
&gt;&gt; booked out more than a week)....last week I needed an MRI...took 36 hours
&gt;&gt; for insurance auth..then was scheduled the next day...left with the
&gt;&gt; films...called ortho for return appt...offered an appt 5 days
&gt;&gt; later...that
&gt;&gt; is NOT the waiting lists referred to...

&gt; There are no &quot;waiting lists&quot; in the US, but people do have to wait.
&gt; Even the chief medical officer of Aetna said wait times for procedures
&gt; like cancer surgery can be over a month on average. Add on to that the
&gt; time it takes to see your PC and the specialist in the first place. Do
&gt; you know something he doesn't?

&gt;&gt;  I have a doctor I
&gt;&gt; &gt; see regularly for fibro, a rheumatologist and one of the few docs in
&gt;&gt; &gt; this area (aka Upstate New York, home to several million people) that
&gt;&gt; &gt; understands fibro. It can takes 3 months to get in to see him, and he
&gt;&gt; &gt; is in Albany, the state capital. It can six months to see a neurologist
&gt;&gt; &gt; in the nearest major city.

&gt;&gt; wellll  golleee....I live in a large urban area...I have never had to
&gt;&gt; wait
&gt;&gt; more than ...at most a few weeks..to see a &quot;new specialist&quot;...all I do is
&gt;&gt; call ...tell them I have PPO  insurance..etc...

&gt; You also have insider status,

I never...never...tell the person on the phone that I am a nurse etc...so I
do NOT have insider status...

AGain...having PPO insurance which allows me to call specialists
directly..without getting &quot;permission&quot; from a pcp...is the difference...

do you REALLY think I have personal relationships with every specialist in
my area??

wrong...the cancer surgeon's office scheduled all the scans needed....done
promptly...

his cardiologist's office (since he has one...) DID get him in for a stress

without cardiac clearance...

this is NOT insider status...it is the way the system works (at least in my
experience)

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;As nurses, we never worry about costs, billing, whether a procedure
&gt;&gt; &gt; will be covered or anything like that. I never have to worry about
&gt;&gt; &gt; whether one of my patients will get the treatment or care they need,&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote Bev Dick, RN, vice president of the United Nurses of Alberta
&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote in a Portsmouth (NH) Herald commentary July 1. &quot;That's the reason
&gt;&gt; &gt; nurses are so supportive of our public system. And we have fought to

&gt;&gt; &gt; _55749.html

&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;But, here's the dirty little secret that they won't tell you. Waiting
&gt;&gt; &gt; times in the U.S. are as bad as or worse than Canada. And, unlike the
&gt;&gt; &gt; U.S., in Canada no one is denied needed medical care, referrals, or
&gt;&gt; &gt; diagnostic tests due to cost, pre-existing conditions, or because it
&gt;&gt; &gt; wasn't pre-approved.

&gt;&gt; &gt; U.S. waiting times are like the elephant in the room few of the critics
&gt;&gt; &gt; care to address. Listen to what the chief medical officer of Aetna had
&gt;&gt; &gt; to say in March.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Speaking to the Aetna Investor's Conference 2007, Troy Brennan let
&gt;&gt; &gt; these nuggets drop:

&gt;&gt; &gt;    * The U.S. &quot;healthcare system is not timely.&quot;
&gt;&gt; &gt;    * Recent statistics from the Institution of Healthcare Improvement
&gt;&gt; &gt; document &quot;that people are waiting an average of about 70 days to see a

&gt;&gt; Seriously Hawki, you are going to have a tough time trying to convince
&gt;&gt; the majority of people that wait times don't exist in the US, since
&gt;&gt; most people have actually experienced having to wait to get a procedure
&gt;&gt; done. Wait times are inevitable in any system as there aren't an
&gt;&gt; infinite number of doctors and the only question is who waits more, and
&gt;&gt; the evidence suggests that for most things, we wait longer than most
&gt;&gt; countries.

&gt;&gt;&gt; the above is not an example of a waiting list ....

&gt;&gt; No one said it was. It is, however, a fact of life for many people,
&gt;&gt; including those with insurance, that they forgo medical care due to
&gt;&gt; inability to afford co-pays and meds.

&gt;&gt; --Sean C

&gt; Any one person's experience is anecdotal evidence at best. When my spinal
&gt; tumor was discovered, I had to wait for 2 months to get a needle biopsy to
&gt; find out if it was malignant or not (2 MONTHS to find out if i had
&gt; cancer!),
&gt; this is while I worked at Mayo Clinic, and was insured by same (that's
&gt; about
&gt; as insider as I know of). When I returned to Kansas afterwards for further
&gt; opinions,  I had a 1.5 month wait for a Neurosurgeon, but then afterwards,
&gt; Ive had little if any wait times. With my PCP I can often get same day
&gt; appts,
&gt; but he practices in a town of 5,000. Wait times in larger city centers, or
&gt; in
&gt; high reputation med centers will always have proportionally long wait
&gt; times
&gt; in my opinion....or at least as my anecdotal evidence indicates.
">

My seeking 2 needle biospy is going on 7  and 16 months now and it has
been all left up to me to setup and get done, nothing new here, that's how
they used there work ethic to say I was abusing my meds by leaving something
up to me I had absolutely no idea I was to &quot;Do Myself&quot; this is becoming
common place now for the sick and suffering, and anyone would know leaving
these things up to a severly ill person is not a very professional thing to
do but it's part of the cut/rate/run system being run right now, excuse
please...Joe

Well, hubby and I have a PPO and it's union insurance, which is not
only decent but good...

To get an appointment with the headache specialist at Wash U I had to
have my neuro contact her office first, then they sent me paperwork
and I had to fill it out and send it back, and then it took 2 months
to hear back that I qualified to be seen by her, after which they
scheduled my appointment for 8 weeks later...total wait time...5 1/2
months.  Never mind that all of this and the insane parking fees,
which you have to pay because there is no free parking at the
hospital, and the hour and a half drive there and back, and the hour
wait, were all so that she could tell me that basically it was as she
thought...there was nothing she could do for me that my current
neurologist wasn't already doing.

SO....5 1/2 months to wait, 20 bucks in gas, and $7.50 in parking,
plus a day without pay for hubby to drive me there...

Nah, the system ain't broke.

My daughter and her husband, both young, with 3 1/2 kids, don't have
insurance.  Donovan lost his job due to seizure disorder and Abby took
a job cleaning houses till his meds got regulated and he could go back
to work.  In the meantime, she was paying daycare because she couldn't
leave the kids with a dad who might have a seizure and go out on them
(twins and a toddler, all under the age of 5).  Based on income
guidelines, their family would have to make less than $500 a MONTH to
qualify for medical assistance for the parents, though the kids are
covered.  Donovan's ER trips (2 now) and the ambulance rides and the
scans and the labs and the meds are not covered because he doesn't
count as disabled.  His new job didn't get him the paperwork in time
and now he has to wait till November to sign up.  They get sick, they
just tough it out until November.  On $12 an hour, how are they going
to afford to pay the $60 a week for the insurance?  I guess someone
doesn't eat.

Ethics aside, the discussion of whether or not they should have had
the kids aside, all that stuff aside because it's already happened,
these are the kinds of people who don't have insurance...the working
poor, the ones who don't have the money to pay so that if they do get
sick they can go to the doctor, and then it gets all out of whack and
they end up thousands and thousands of dollars in debt, and they have
to go to the ER because they don't have the money to pay for an office
visit, and if there was even a clinic in the area with a horrid
waiting time at least they could go there, but we're medically under-
served out here because it's the Midwest and only the cities have
anywhere near decent care if you're uninsured.

My son also has no insurance.  He got scratched in the eye last week
by a dog.  I drug him to the ER and his meds, though they were
generic, I had to pay for, because otherwise he wouldn't have had
them...antibiotics and a few Vicodin.  Big city hospitals will
sometimes give the patient the meds and send them to the clinic for
follow up.  That's not out here.  There is no clinic.  He can't afford
the follow-up appointment and neither can I.  He did the eye ointment
and took the pain meds and was back at work the next day because he
can't afford to take a day off.

I raised my kids on my own as a single mom with no child support,
choosing that over abuse and beatings.  My kids didn't have the luxury
of going to college.  I could barely pay the rent and put food on the
table...with 3 kids even $17 an hour doesn't go far when you don't
qualify for any assistance at all and the rent was $650 a month plus
utilities and food and gas and insurance and clothes and such...so
it's not because they're slackers or just don't want to pay.  It's
because they don't have it.

The attitude of those who have the opportunity and benefits of a good
upbringing and the money to do what needs to be done when it presents
itself toward those who don't have those things to start out with
infuriates me at times.  It would only take a few weeks at most in the
shoes of a single mom trying to do the best she can while raising kids
on her own and making it paycheck to paycheck with no extra resources,
no savings, no child support for the high-and-mighty ones to admit
that it isn't about motivation or desire.  It's about money.

I have no idea who you are or who you lnow. I can only go by what *you*

&gt;  so your particular experience is not only

&gt; &gt; I'm sure if you know somebody or are connected in Canada or anywhere

&gt; &gt; Professional courtesy exists everywhere. Beyond that, money always

&gt; &gt;&gt; try getting cancer surgery in Canada in a week

&gt; &gt; That is certainly not typical in the US, where people often wait for
&gt; &gt; over a month for such procedures. You keep forgetting you have insider
&gt; &gt; status, and that counts for a lot.

&gt; wrong...the cancer surgeon's office scheduled all the scans needed....done
&gt; promptly...

It is not wrong just because you have experienced differently. I am
basing this on a statement by Aetna's CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, who
certainly has an incentive to fudge the numbers downward, not upward,
as well as a scientific study by the Commonwealth Fund.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; his cardiologist's office (since he has one...) DID get him in for a stress

&gt; experience)

In your experience. Your experience does not trump a scientific study.
Another issue of course is the severity of the problem. If doctors
think you are an emergency or high priority case, they will tend to
speed you to the top of the line ahead of others.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; _55749.html

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;But, here's the dirty little secret that they won't tell you. Waiting
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; times in the U.S. are as bad as or worse than Canada. And, unlike the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; U.S., in Canada no one is denied needed medical care, referrals, or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; diagnostic tests due to cost, pre-existing conditions, or because it
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wasn't pre-approved.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; U.S. waiting times are like the elephant in the room few of the critics
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; care to address. Listen to what the chief medical officer of Aetna had
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to say in March.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Speaking to the Aetna Investor's Conference 2007, Troy Brennan let
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these nuggets drop:

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;    * The U.S. &quot;healthcare system is not timely.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;    * Recent statistics from the Institution of Healthcare Improvement
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; document &quot;that people are waiting an average of about 70 days to see a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; provider.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;    * &quot;In many circumstances people initially diagnosed with cancer are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; waiting over a month, which is intolerable.&quot;
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;    * In his former stint as an administrator and head of a physicians'
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; organization he spent much of his time trying &quot;to find appointments for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; people with doctors.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Statistics Canada's latest figures show that median wait times for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; elective surgery in Canada is now three weeks -- that's less time than
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Aetna's chief medical officer says Americans typically wait after being
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; diagnosed with cancer.&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; total and utter bs...wait times in Canada can easily be up to a year

&gt; &gt; Do you have a cite for a study that shows that *median wait times*,
&gt; &gt; which is what Stats Canada is reporting, are up to a year? We are
&gt; &gt; talking median here, which means that 50 percent are seen in less than
&gt; &gt; 3 weeks, and 50 percent more than 3 weeks. That doesn't preclude the
&gt; &gt; possibility of someone waiting for a year for a procedure, but
&gt; &gt; certainly at least half do not wait more than 3 weeks. Based on what I
&gt; &gt; have read, I have seen no evidence of anyone waiting over 182 days

&gt; uhhh....182 days is SIX months....you don't see a problem with waiting SIX
&gt; months for needed....but non emergent surgery and treatment...

&gt; yikes
">

I never said it wasn't a problem. What I did say is that there is only
a small minority of people (1 percent) who fall into this category.
Waiting six months for anything is intolerable on its face, but without
further data nobody can say why someone is waiting that long. Is it an
organ transplant case waiting for an available organ? In that case such
a wait is hardly unusual, however intolerable. The way you and others
present the argument, you would think *everyone* has to wait a year for
heart surgery in Canada, and this is simply not the case. The median
for elective procedures is three weeks, *not* a year, and no one gets
denied care for financial reasons or because some insurance company
bureaucrat signed your death warrant.

It should also be noted the Canadian governemnt has launched a major
effort to combat wait times at all levels of the system, has already
achieved results, and many of the figures you see are outdated.

Actually, the British NHS reimburses at least some patients for travel

Never said I thought that.  It's just that if you have no coverage, or
if you have coverage and not a lot of extra money for gas and parking
and this and that, getting decent care can still be prohibitive...not
to mention what happens to the people who don't have the insurance.

How about waiting a year to see a doctor and when you finally get him (and

course I want to see him get more than the $390 a visit he got with me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; American people
&gt;&gt;&gt; are already waiting as long or longer than patients living with
&gt;&gt;&gt; universal health-care systems.

a week if not emergent

and of course when leaving an appt..with say...my ortho...who tells me to
come back in 4 weeks...I make the appt as I leave...I do not consider that
waiting

in the past 6 years I have scheduled angiograms..open heart surgery..colon
cancer surgery..hernia surgery..knee surgery...etc.....almost without
exception surgeries were scheduled promptly...yes..needed time to do pre op
stuff like scans and treadmills....
