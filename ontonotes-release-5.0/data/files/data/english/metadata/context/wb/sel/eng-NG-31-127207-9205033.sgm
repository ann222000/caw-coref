Here was his response to LaJuan Ramsey's *cheap shot* on Julius Jones:

http://www.philly.com/dailynews/sports/20071106_Reid_says_Sheppard_sh...

&quot;The thing he was doing was, he was trying hard to get to that spot
and get there fast. He tried to make something happen,&quot; Reid said. &quot;He
ended up being late by a tick and you can't do that . . . at least he
was trying to get there and hustle and be part of that play.&quot;

I've lost all respect to this arrogant SOB.

He's defending his guy. Did you expect something different?

For the record, it was not just a cheap shot - it was the kind of
dangerous play that should be punished with a suspension. The Eagles
were clearly frustrated at being beaten so thoroughly at home, and they
just started trying to injure guys. The NFL has got to crack down on
that BS.
