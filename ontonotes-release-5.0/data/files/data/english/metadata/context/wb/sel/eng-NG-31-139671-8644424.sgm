I was rather shocked the first time I saw a guild named &quot;Twinks R Us&quot;
in general chat. From context and my understanding of the word &quot;twink&quot;
outside of WoW, I thought they were a gay pride guild who liked to
fight Horde. This was something I thought was technically against
Blizzard's narrow minded TOS.

Before playing any MMORPGs, I had only heard &quot;twink&quot; used to refer to
young attractive gay males. How did &quot;twink&quot; attain the usage it has in
WoW?

AFAIK

A Twink is a char that will play in Arena's at level 19, 29, 39, 49 etc. to
collect honour points, marks and all...

These honour points or weapons that can be bought for these honour points
will be transfered to the main char.

The main char wil vis-a-vis transfer nice gear collected in quests to the
twink (say the main is a warrior and the twink is a mage: the warrior will
transfer the clothie stuff to the twink).

Dunno if it's even possible with the soulbound-option for weapons bought
with marks...

While this does explain what a twink is, it doesn't really explain how
an uber-geared player came to be known as a twink.  From what I've read
elsewhere, one explanation is that twinks usually have high-level
enchants on their weapons, causing them to &quot;twinkle&quot;, hence the term.

I've also heard that it actually comes from the &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot;
connotation you mentioned, whereas in that context it often refers to a
younger person with a lifestyle and/or possessions beyond his means paid
for by an older &quot;admirer&quot;, in this case a twink is a lower-level
character with gear usually provided to him by a higher-level main or
guildmate.  Either explanation sounds feasible to me.  However, I
believe the term has been used pre-WoW in MMORPG's which don't
necessarily feature the &quot;twinkling&quot; of enchants (i.e., text only MUDs),
so the second explanation may be closer to the truth.

Young attractive gay males sometimes have rich older gay boyfriends who buy
them nice things. Hence the term.

The replies he was referring to weren't actually within the inquiry.
They were definitions of the word, when it seems (to me) quite clear
that he was asking about its etymology.

It's a great question though.  The most logical &quot;guess&quot; is pretty
illogical.  It doesn't seem like gay slang would be able to work its
way into 1980s text-based gaming.  But that seems to make more sense
than the idea that it's a variation on &quot;twinkle&quot;.

Perhaps &quot;twinkie&quot; meaning you ended up with cookie-cutter characters,
since twinkie often refers to pseudo-twins?

On the &quot;Twinking&quot; discussion I linked, one of the contributors of the

&quot;I also first heard the term in EverQuest, but the word's origin had a
slightly different meaning. A higher level character would give money
or new items to a lower level character. While graphically the money
or new items may not twinkle, in popular culture someone who is rich
adorns themselves or others with new things that are often portrayed
as sparkling, shiny or twinkling, such as a &quot;shiny new car&quot; or a
&quot;twinkling diamond necklace&quot;. So, if a player receives these new items
or wealth which they normally could not obtain without help, they are
called a Twink: which is a negative connotation for someone who
receives wealth beyond their means.&quot;

In the text based MUDs, you do not need to graphically twinkle
(shine). The fact you can get something that hypothetically twinkles
might already be enough for the etymology of the term. I think both,
the &quot;young, pretty gay&quot; slang and the twinkle, shinning suggestion
applies for the origin of the term.

It's used in WoW because it was a term that already existed at launch.  How
it originally came into use I don't know, but it does predate WoW by quite a
long time.  I know twink gear was a term commonly used in Diablo 2 for
overly good equipment for low level characters.  I assume it had a
definition along those longs in similar games before that as well.

The word &quot;twink&quot; has been used in MMORPGs for many, many years - since
before WoW was even on the drawing board.  David Collantes summed it
up in his post very well.  As he said, in EQ the word &quot;twink&quot; was any
character that had been given a large injection of cash at, say lvl 1,
and thus was wearing gear vastly better than the stuff a 'genuine' lvl
1 character would have.  My first lvl 1 magic-user in EQ was glad to
get a full set of cloth armour by scavenging, and buying my first
backpack was a big deal. One of my later ones had gear which gave
about 20 times the ac of the first guy, and had weapons and gear
'donated' from my other characters and bought in the Bazaar.  The
difference was incredible, and to me, that was &quot;twinking&quot;.

The ideal example in WoW was that lvl 1 character wandering about
recently on one of the servers, who was duelling lvl 12 characters and
soundly beating them. That, my friends, is a &quot;twink&quot; as we old-time
MMORPGers know it  :)

I wasn't even aware that &quot;twink&quot; was used to refer specifically to
characters in Battlegrounds, as I just assumed the term referred to
ANY player character with high-powered equipment and enchants.  As for
the gay term, well, as we see from the word &quot;gay&quot;, terminology can be
adapted from anything!  I, for one, didn't even KNOW &quot;twink&quot; was a
term also used by gays, so you live and learn...

I would think gamers used it first though, certainly in Europe if not
in the USA.

&gt; &quot;Twinking&quot; has a long history in ORPGs, but it never really meant
&gt; what it meant in WoW.  Historically to &quot;twink&quot; (short for &quot;twinkie&quot;,
&gt; related to &quot;munchkin&quot; tho not the same thing) meant that your character
&gt; was being aided or given access to equipment beyond their means.  So
&gt; IOW, a runthrough of a lowlevel instance would be &quot;twinking&quot;.  Sending
&gt; an alt gold would be &quot;twinking&quot;.

&gt; I have no idea how the idiots of today settled on &quot;twinking&quot; to mean
&gt; pvping at a particular level w/ the best gear.
">

It's *sort of* the same thing.  Just a further evolution of the word.
In other words, a twink in EQ was typically a low-level character
wearing high-level gear.  In WoW, it's similar, but since almost
everything is level-capped it refers mostly to enchants.  Further,
since gear is level-restricted and progression through levels is very
fast, there's not much need to truly &quot;twink&quot; a character since they
will have access to better gear so quickly.  The only place in the
game where it makes since to not progress your character's level
relatively quickly is BGs.

It's a pretty old word in the gay community, as far as I know.  Keep
in mind there's a been a gay culture much longer than there's been a
gamer culture ;P

Looking into it this morning, I found one place that pegged it (an
etymology site, and the wiki talk page as well) as early as 1963, but
I didn't see any citations so it's pretty useless.

On the server I play on, if people find out you're a twink you'll be

It's not &quot;uber-geared&quot; players, but players with
uber-gear that they got because someone gave them
a ton of money.  Ie, they didn't earn the gear.

&quot;Twink&quot; is probably short for &quot;twinkie&quot; (no
nutritional value).  And &quot;twinkie&quot; is the
same as &quot;cream puff&quot;.  Both are used to
disparage manhood.  For a long time, &quot;twink&quot;
was an insult.  It meant to imply that even
though the player had good gear on the
outside they were still soft and squishy
on the inside.

In the RPG world, &quot;twink&quot; and &quot;munchkin&quot; are
the same thing.  Someone who exploits loopholes
to get more powerful than normal.

But with the battlegrounds things changed I think
and the term evolved.  Lots of rich bored players
wanted to get the absolute best gear that was
available for levels 19/29/39/etc.  And that was
accomplished through twinking.  People forgot the
old meanings, and new players associate &quot;twink&quot;
only with the battlegrounds.

Because they're trying to turn the word around

high level players with low level twinks in
the battlegrounds who keep being called
twinks.  What better way to deflect the

The word &quot;Twink&quot; is used in the gay community by older gents referring to

because the older men buy them stuff. Cars, clothes, apartments, etc. The
word was then applied in the gaming world to low-level characters who

&gt;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twinking

&gt;While this does explain what a twink is, it doesn't really explain how
&gt;an uber-geared player came to be known as a twink.  From what I've read
&gt;elsewhere, one explanation is that twinks usually have high-level
&gt;enchants on their weapons, causing them to &quot;twinkle&quot;, hence the term.

Nope. This expression has been around long before twinkly item
enchantments existed in games.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I've also heard that it actually comes from the &quot;alternative lifestyle&quot;
&gt;connotation you mentioned, whereas in that context it often refers to a
&gt;younger person with a lifestyle and/or possessions beyond his means paid
&gt;for by an older &quot;admirer&quot;, in this case a twink is a lower-level
&gt;character with gear usually provided to him by a higher-level main or
&gt;guildmate.

Hehe, somebody pulled that fanciful piece of imagination out of their
rump. No gay pun intended.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Either explanation sounds feasible to me.  However, I
&gt;believe the term has been used pre-WoW in MMORPG's which don't
&gt;necessarily feature the &quot;twinkling&quot; of enchants (i.e., text only MUDs),
&gt;so the second explanation may be closer to the truth.
">

Neither have the remotest basis in truth, but it is fun to randomly
hypothesize, sometimes ;-)  I have no idea how long the term has been
around, but my first encounter with it was back in the year 2000, with
the arrival of Diablo2. I never played Evercrack, but I'm sure that
game had a similar twinking thing going on. Back then it was referred
to as &quot;twinking up&quot; your character, or &quot;twinking&quot;. A player who did
this was a &quot;twinker&quot;. As is the nature of the human beast, we tend to
always make things shorter and easier to say, over time... hence, now
it is just &quot;twink&quot;. Probably nobody knows for sure exactly who coined
the phrase orginally, or what their reasoning for it was (if any), but
I like to think it was probably just a flippant verbal variation of
'tweaking', with possibly a dab of 'tinkering', that gave birth to the
phrase. Tweaking + tinkering = twinking. As logical a rationalization
as any, heh.

But twinking is the basic act of tinkering with your character to make
him as good as he can possibly be for his level, by tweaking his kit
to include weapons, armor, enchantments, etc. that he wouldn't
normally have access to. There you have it.

Yeah, most references to twinking in WoW seems to be in regards to
characters that are built for doing the battlegrounds.

I come from a Diablo 2 background though and in my view, just about
all my characters have been twinked to varying degree's despite only
ever been in 1 battle ground, at that was with my one level 70.
Instead, all 9 of my alts have 3 bag slots in their banks, I'm well on
my way to getting them all filled up with 16 slot bags.  I've still
got a dozen or so 14 slot bags in use.  They've all gotten gold to
help get and level their secondary skills and their crafting skills.
And when one of my crafters makes something for the lower level ones,
they first go via my enchanter.  Heh, I've even got a copper sword,
useable at level 4 with a fiery enchant on it.  It was a white item so
I could even swap it around between characters, though none of them
that were of a level to want it could use swords at that time.

On a slightly different topic, one thing that might make tradeskills
better is to give the items they create the same &quot;points&quot; per level as
epics have.  So a tailor can make a robe with stats that you could use
at level 20 that you'd have to be level 30 if you wanted the same
stats from a green world drop.

&gt; &gt; The meanings are similar, but I still am somewhat unsure about gay
&gt; &gt; slang finding its way into MUD culture.  Particularly in a time when
&gt; &gt; they didn't have much open interplay.

&gt; One problem I have is just seeing how much revisionist history shows
&gt; up with modern players as it is - my acceptance would depend a lot
&gt; on who was writing it.

&gt; Example:  I actually knew the person who coined the term &quot;Carebear&quot;
&gt; (and it wasn't the negative that it is now) - but the stories I see
&gt; that float around about how it started are not only completely wrong
&gt; but point to games that came out *after* this happened.  There have
&gt; even been times when I tried pointing this out only to be told that
&gt; Asheron's Call came out before UO.  errr, okay.

Exactly.  We've seen the same thing with pretty much every single
video game slang-term.  Pwn, twink, etc.  They always seem to
&quot;originate&quot; in the author's favorite game (EQ, CS, and UO being the
usual culprits).

While &quot;carebear&quot; may have become more popular with
UO, especially with the non-PVP meanings, the term
is older.  Here's a post that refers to obliquely
as a style of play for Diplomacy, from 1994 (UO was
1997):

http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.diplomacy/msg/0712bd4b6a2720...

Ie, &quot;carebear&quot; there is a style where you're more
politically correct and maintain your alliances
rather than being cuthroat and backstabby.  That
would seem to easily morph into a &quot;no PVP&quot; pejorative.

(As a side note, while searching I found references
to &quot;twink&quot; with respect to Diku MUDs from before
Ultima Online opened; though no references to other
types of MUDs)

I love it when this happens! You frequently see Wapanese types say that
some story or TV show was 'ripped off' from an anime series viewed only by
5 people in this hemisphere. Inevitably, a moment's thought will make you
remember a much older example of the same thing, sometimes what the ANIME
was ripping off (this happens rather a lot from what I can tell). It's so
much fun to watch them blow a gasket.

As a general rule - any term or plotline that you think is original (or
that you invented) will always found to be derivative of something older,
or your believed origin story will be complete hogwash. Beware. *

&gt;&gt; in general chat. From context and my understanding of the word &quot;twink&quot;
&gt;&gt; outside of WoW, I thought they were a gay pride guild who liked to
&gt;&gt; fight Horde. This was something I thought was technically against
&gt;&gt; Blizzard's narrow minded TOS.

&gt;&gt; Before playing any MMORPGs, I had only heard &quot;twink&quot; used to refer to

&gt;&gt; WoW?

&gt; AFAIK

&gt; A Twink is a char that will play in Arena's at level 19, 29, 39, 49 etc.
&gt; to collect honour points, marks and all...

&gt; These honour points or weapons that can be bought for these honour points
&gt; will be transfered to the main char.

Ah, you can't transfer honor or Marks or any armor/weapons bought with them
to other toons.

Wow, this was a pretty heavy discussion from Twink to
Carebears...amazing....although, the initial question stated by Bill
was a good one.  I myself asked my son the same question a few weeks
ago which he just replied &quot;its a really tricked out toon&quot;.

So where did toon come from?

Look. I think we should just come out and say that we can use the word
'twink' and not be thought gay. There. I said it.
...not that there's anything wrong with that.

'Twink' was certainly already in common use on LP muds when I
started playing them in 1993. The meaning there was much the same -
a character who had been given a big headstart in money or gear by
an existing high level character.

The same term was in use in MUSHes too, but with a different slant
as those games were much more focussed on roleplay. In those games
'twink' tends to refer to someone who power-poses in consent-based
play (i.e. poses (emotes) consequences happening to people who
haven't agreed to them or without giving them a chance to respond or
avoid it); or to someone who repeatedly poses doing things that are
beyond their character's actual abilities so that they seem more
powerful than they really are.
