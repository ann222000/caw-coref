It seems that we have a few Trolls determined to make this their
personal playground. They are easy to spot by their cute comments and
lack of focus on the threads they jump into. You can also ID them by
the fact they rarely even use their real email address too. If you
ignore them long enough they "might" go away but if not you can see
right thru there scam as they try to makeup for some insecurity they
have by trying to attack others. They are legends in their own minds.
Troll such as these make it hard for some actually seeking help or
advise which they seem to deem is only valid if it comes from them. Do
not take my word for it just look at how and where the post and how
often too.

Yes, that is really smart on the newsgroups, use your real e-mail
address.  Not only do you give out inaccurate and dangerous
info, now you want people to copy you and foolishly put up their
"real" email addresses.  That's dumb, but par for the course for you.

Now just how on earth would you know who uses their real email address
and who doesn't?  Do you send test msgs to everyone that you class as
a troll?  I know you don't because if you were smart enough to reply
to sender, how come I haven't received an email from you?  NOT THAT I
WANT ONE.

Dud, the only person that needs to go away is you, you are dangerous
and your opinions and advice is hurtful, useless and just plain
idiotic.

Well this is one of the disadvantages of the internet.  In the old days, it
was considered to be poor form to use a fake email address but now a-days
there is no such thing as net-etiquette.  Just keep ignoring them, I would
imagine other readers do as I do, read the first sentence and just go on to
the next post in the thread.

Ok, I will ask you your thoughts, as from what I am reading you are
siding (oddly enough) with Snoturd.  How do you know who uses real
email and who doesn't?  Also, who should you (figuritively) really
ignore, the person that posts answers such as "trade your truck in"
when 50 bucks would have fixed the problem, or "use a higher viscosity
gear oil" to the person that had rear ends burning up.  OR the people
that are here, helping those in need, even if it is by simply
pointing out that all caution should be used when listening to Snoturd.

Let's see how this applies to you.

You seem to be determined to post wrong inaccurate and at times dangerous
answer's and advice in your attempt to make this one of your many
playgrounds

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;They are easy to spot by their cute comments and
&gt; lack of focus on the threads they jump into.

The focus of those of us who take exception to your continueing to post
useless wrong info is to alert those whe may not know that youe info is
wrong or useless or dangerous. You find the need for that cute?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; You can also ID them by

Gee, I have alot of these folks addy's and some their phone numbers. Your
point?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;If you
&gt; ignore them long enough they &quot;might&quot; go away

Not until you stop the bs you have been posting. You were told before that
as long as you continued with the inaccurate post's you would be called on
them. It is real simple, knock off the mind numbing crap.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;but if not you can see
&gt; right thru there scam as they try to makeup for some insecurity they
&gt; have by trying to attack others.
">

The only scammer here is you. Why do you think you are attacked? You haven't
really seen a attack have ya? All that I have seen is people correcting or
pointing out you bs info.

That is probably the best advice you have given, advice I support. I would
invite anybody who before acting on any of your advice or info to wait and
see if sombody corrects it. You know that the few times you are correct
nobody post's a correction.

So I have another  couple of question for you, not that you have ever
answered a question about your post's.

My question are these:

Does it strike odd that people have to post and correct what you give out as
advice?

Has it ever dawned on you that if you were to stop with the BS answer's the
follow up post's would stop?

You have been useing the term "troll" You know that a troll is one who
post's bs to elicit a response. It wouild seem to me that you are the real
true troll here.

I wonder how it looks in your sig. Here ya go. Looks like a perfect fit.

Nice preemptive post. Sarcasm intended.  It's bad enough that you post
incorrect information or post something the OP is not asking about. But, the
thing that bothers me the most is when someone posts a valid response to a
question and you reply first by refuting good advice, then come up with some
really hare-brain, dangerous idea.

I do understand what you are saying.  You are trying to keep people from
being lead in the wrong direction and I do think that is necessary but I
feel this can be done without attacking the poster. He posts his opinion (as
we all do) and I feel he has the right to do so but some of the responses to
his posts do get quite personal.   While I feel this group is a wonderful
source of information; I also feel the person asking the question needs to
be able to filter the information and if they are not familiar with the
topic they need to do more research or take the vehicle to a professional
mechanic.  The internet should never be the sole source of information.
More importantly, someone who lurks here will read these posts and see it as
an unfriendly or unprofessional environment.  They will think twice before
they post.

My policy is to ignore posts that are not on topic, which generally can be
established with in the first couple of sentences.  Whether or not the post
contains correct or incorrect information is a moot point, as long as it is
on topic, I will read it.  .And like all advice, I will listen but I will
choose what to believe and what to ignore.

A valid email address is one that can be used to contact the author of the
post for further information.  Personally, I do not care who uses read
address, as I do not send emails to group members nor do I block anybody.  I
assume there are many here who post with a real address or an obvious
variant of their real address but there are many who obviously do not (i.e.
M3LT1NG5N0W ... @WAH00.COM, a ... @verizon.net and so on).  In addition, while
verizon does exist a WHOIS search for WAH00 returned no host listing...

I've seen snoball give bad answers to people with fake emails just as
often as people with real emails. Didn't mean jack shit to him then,
shouldn't mean jack shit now. Cant argue with someone with a fake email
