Dear All,

Israel’s practices regarding entry into the OPT to foreign passport holders, some of Palestinian descent, others spouses of Palestinians, some staff of universities or schools, some students belies Israel’s leaders’ claims to be willing to divide historic Palestine into two states: Israel and Palestine.  Had Israel really intended to do this, then it would have allowed Palestinians, or spouses of, or citizens of other countries who are of Palestinian descent enter without difficulty the supposedly forthcoming Palestinian state.  Ida is right in calling Israeli practices ethnic cleansing.  Israel wants all the land with as few Palestinians on it as possible.  The practices are also racist.  But that’s another story.

Hello, everyone.
An article I wrote about the problem we are facing (as
foreign passport holders trying to live with our
families in the occupied territories) was published on
countercurrents.org. I boiled this down to a shorter
op-ed and sent it to four newspapers, but no luck yet.

Regards,
Ida

Israel Takes Aim At
Palestinian Families

By Ida Audeh

11 September, 2007
Countercurrents.org

Israel's practice of denying family reunification
permits and denying entry to foreign passport holders
(many of whom are of Palestinian origin) is part of a
campaign of ridding the occupied territories
(including East Jerusalem) of Palestinians and
controlling those it is obliged to retain. The
practice takes aim at Palestinian families under
occupation: it splits families apart, denies
Palestinian communities access to foreign and
expatriate talent, deprives the economically hard-hit
territories of foreign currency, and further isolates
the Palestinians under occupation.

The Campaign for the Right of Entry/Re-Entry to the
Palestinian Occupied Territories ( www.righttoenter.ps )
estimates that more than 150,000 family reunification
applications were submitted to the Israeli occupation
authorities between 1973 and 1982 but that only 1,000
were approved each year. Between 1983 and 2000, the
annual number of approved applications has fluctuated
between 1,000 and 3,000. Since the second intifada
began in September 2000, Israel has not processed
about 120,000 family reunification applications.
Multiply that by 4 or 5 (a conservative estimate; most
Palestinian families are much larger), and the number
of people affected by the Israeli refusal to grant
residency rights to Palestinians with foreign
passports becomes apparent. As applied to Palestinian
residents in East Jerusalem, the policy is clearly
designed to drive out as many indigenous Palestinians
as possible, with the aim of maintaining a Jewish
majority in the city.

Israeli Arab citizens are targeted by legislation that
violates their rights in similar ways. In May 2002,
the Israeli Knesset enacted Government Decision #1813,
thereby freezing all unification applications for the
Palestinian spouse of an Israeli citizen or permanent
resident. The 2003 Law of Nationality and Entry into
Israel (Temporary Order 2003) effectively denies
Israeli citizens the right to marry Palestinians and
to live with their spouses in Israel. These laws
violate the Human Rights and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights because they
violate the fundamental right to privacy and family
life of Palestinian citizens of Israel on the basis of
the ethnicity of their spouses.

The denial of legal residency has meant that foreign
passport holders have had to leave the country when
their visas expired and then re-enter in hopes of
receiving another tourist visa, typically good for 3
months. These visas had been granted routinely, but in
March 2006, the Israelis began to withhold them.
Thousands of people whose families, businesses, and
jobs -- in short, their lives -- were centered in the
occupied territories have been turned back from the
borders.

The result? Families live in a state of chronic
uncertainty. Not only can't they make long-term plans,
they can't even trust that they will be permitted to
live together for more than a month (or two, but not
more than three) at a time. Anita, a Swiss woman
married to a Palestinian resident, left the occupied
territories this summer to visit her elderly mother in
Europe because she hadn't seen her in years; she left
knowing that she might not be able to rejoin her
husband. Why should anyone have to choose between
visiting an elderly parent and living with her or her
spouse in their own home? Sam, a businessman from the
US, married a West Bank resident and has lived in the
West Bank for 10 years or so; his two young daughters
are terrified that when he leaves the area, as he must
periodically to avoid illegal residency, he may not be
able to return. Enaya, a Palestinian grandmother with
a US passport who is married to a Palestinian
resident, was denied entry after having lived with her
husband for 30 years on a tourist visa that she
renewed every 3 months. After a separation of about 9
months, she was finally allowed to return on a 3-month
visa. But even those who manage to get a visa cannot
be sure that they will be so lucky the next time they
apply.

In the summer of 2006, my husband and I had flown into
Israel's Ben-Gurion airport after visiting his mother
in Jordan. At that point, we had been living in
Ramallah for about 18 months. Upon presenting our
passports at the passport control counter, we were
whisked off to a separate section behind a partition
and away from incoming tourists. Soon my husband was
called in for interrogation and told that we had to
return to Jordan.

The official who told us this, an Israeli with a New
York accent, seemed a little embarrassed to be in this
position. He could see from our US passports that my
husband's roots in the area predated the establishment
of the state he served. I'd like to think that he had
the grace to be ashamed of the power he had, by virtue
of his being a Jew, to deny another American entry to
his geographic birth space, even for a visit, and to
be doubly ashamed by the knowledge that we would have
been welcomed enthusiastically no matter how many
times we entered as tourists, had we been Jews
ourselves and &quot;untainted&quot; by any Palestinian
connection. My argument that we needed to go home,
even if only briefly, to close down our apartment and
find our cat a new home (I mentioned my cat rather
than my elderly mother, reasoning that a Westerner
would more likely be swayed by a pet than a
Palestinian mother), simply made things worse; as a
tourist, I was told, there was no reason I should have
either a home or a cat.

We later learned that the US embassy in Jordan was
receiving 24 complaints a day of US citizens -- most,
but not all, of Palestinian ethnicity -- being turned
back from the bridge. US citizens were the largest
group of foreign passport holders denied entry, but no
foreign nationals were immune. (To get an idea about
the vicious treatment that many foreign nationals have
been receiving at the hands of Israeli border
authorities, check out the cases on this page:
http://www.righttoenter.ps/Cases.php ).

Less than 3 months later, I tried again to enter the
territories through the Allenby Bridge, this time
accompanied by my mother, who lives alone and has
chronic health problems that are pretty apparent even
on casual observation. I assumed that after taking one
look at her (my Exhibit A), any Israeli official I
encountered, swayed by humanitarian law and normal
human decency, would let me enter the country to care
for her. I was wrong. Once again I was told that I
could not enter the territories.

While waiting for my documents to be returned to me, I
noticed that a family was also waiting. The man was a
Palestinian resident, his wife was not; their children
were perhaps 2 and 3 years old. Then an Israeli
officer approached them, and I could tell by the
animated way in which the man spoke and the stunned
silence of the woman that she too had been denied
entry. Rather than separate the children from their
mother, all four returned to Jordan.

Israel's denial of entry to the occupied territories
and its refusal to grant permanent residency to
spouses of Palestinian residents -- Israeli officials
insist that it is not a policy, although they have
enforced it with increasing regularity since March
2006 -- is a violation of international humanitarian
law and the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, which
Israel, as occupying power, is obligated to respect.
Third states have an obligation to insist that Israel
respect the law, since it can do so easily; when they
ignore Israel's violations, they violate their own
obligations not to acquiesce to unlawful and
deliberately harmful acts by other states. (Someone
should bring this to the attention of our fearless
members of Congress.)

Academic institutions have been hard hit by this
policy, too. A Birzeit University press release dated
6 January 2007 notes that 50% of foreign passport
holding staff have had to leave, which has put most
departments at risk of dropping courses from their
offerings or losing specialists they cannot replace.
One department risks losing as much as 70% of its
staff. Programs such as the Arabic language and
cultural program were funded by foreign student
tuitions; when foreign students are denied entry to
the region to study at Birzeit, the loss of funding
has meant a loss of emergency funding that had helped
the university cover its expenses. Because of the
growing problem with entry denials, applications to
the program have dropped by 50%. Recent e-mail I
received from the campaign show that the university
continues to struggle with this Israeli restriction.

I think of the people I know of or met who have been
turned back at the borders -- middle-aged people like
myself and Walid, the Brazilian national of
Palestinian origin in his 70s who had been in the
occupied territories for 10 years and who was sent
back to Jordan on the same bus I did, others with
families, teachers at the Quaker high school in
Ramallah that I graduated from, Birzeit University
staff -- and I know that no on in his right mind could
believe we pose a threat to Israel's security. The
only explanation for a practice that is inconsistently
implemented just enough to keep people off balance is
that it is part of the ongoing Israeli strategy of
tightening the noose on Palestinians.

Since Oslo, Israel has speeded up implementation of
the policy it has followed even before the state of
Israel was established -- grab as much land as
possible with as few indigenous Palestinians as
possible. To establish a Jewish state in a part of the
world that has not had a Jewish majority since
biblical times, Zionist militias wiped off the map
more than 400 Palestinian towns and villages and made
700,000 Palestinians refugees. In the 40 years since
the 1967 war, it has illegally settled Israeli
colonizers in Jewish-only settlements in the occupied
territories, it has established more than 400
checkpoints, it has built a monstrous separation
barrier complete with patrol roads and watchtowers
that seal off Palestinian towns from each other, it is
building a separate road network to connect Israeli
settlements in the West Bank with Israel to make sure
they never come into contact with Palestinians (a type
of segregation that one South African anti-apartheid
activist labeled &quot;obscene&quot; and exceeding anything he
experienced under apartheid), and it has sealed
geographic districts for months on end, preventing the
movement of people and goods, with predictably
devastating effects on the Palestinian economy.

One of Israel's thorniest problems has always been the
presence of an indigenous non-Jewish population
(typically referred to in racist terms as a
&quot;demographic problem&quot;) residing within its
(undeclared) borders as well as in the territories it
occupies. Through a combination of laws and policies
designed to make the occupied territories unlivable,
Israel has sealed all large Palestinian population
centers into open-air prisons cut off from one
another. A case in point (there are unfortunately many
to choose from): Qalqilya, at one time referred to as
the West Bank's bread basket, has been completely
encircled by a wall since 2003, with a single gated
road leading into and out of the city. Qalqilya had a
population of 43,000, but by 2006, several thousand
had moved. No doubt they left in search of work -- the
wall has had that effect on many communities. But who
can gauge the psychological pressure of living in a
city where a monstrous concrete wall higher than the
former Berlin wall blocks view of the sunset?

Israel's policies will ultimately fail. A state
narrowly defined in terms of a religion adhered to by
a minority of the residents (and in the
not-too-distant future, Jews will be a minority in
Mandate Palestine) cannot indefinitely control the
majority population or extinguish its demand for a
life with dignity and political, civil, and human
rights. Nor can it hope to survive in the region as
long as its policies are both expansionist and
exclusionary. But until the international community
insists that Israel respect international law and
abandon its cruel policies, Israel will continue to
target Palestinian families, a silent form of ethnic
cleansing that is less dramatic than other forms it
has implemented since the state's inception, but just
as deadly to Palestinian national life.
