Yerrrs. I was watching it and couldn't believe quite how, er, forceful
JPM was. He is not going to get away with that kind of driving for long;
if he keeps trying it on ovals someone is going to get hurt - either in
the accident, or JPM will when someone decks him.

The Busch cars did look fantastic there though.

Good heavens, yes! I remember watching the last couple of Busch races
there and not being too impressed. I think removing the chicane on the
front stretch made for a much better race. I would like to see how the
cars would do going all the way down into the hairpin section. On the
other hand, the carousel turn they use to short-cut that section is
quite nice and makes for a great launch into the Esses.

That looks like such a wonderful course. I'd love to work one of the
races down there someday. I just need to learn how to speak teh Español.

Punted?  I think the question is who spun who?

Watch closely.  Montoya's front-end was even with Pruett's right-side
door, Montoya had the inside line.  Pruett turned into the corner late
to block and came down on Montoya.  Pruett's line was so late that it
would have caused him to enter then next corner poorly (late entry /
late apex).

It was clearly a block and it was thrown too late.

Montoya got on the brakes hard, but was unable to get out of Pruett's way.

Could the incident be avoided?  Sure.  Montoya could have waited for
Pruett to make one of his famous bone-head mistakes, Pruett didn't have
to throw the block.

So chalk it up to (switching languages to NASCAR) "one of them racin deals."

I would not have wanted to be either Montoya or Pruett during the
post-race team meeting.  I'm sure both came out several pound lighter
and in need of emergency rectal surgery.

But the bottom line (no pun intended) is that NASCAR is a contact sport.
After Montoya assumed the lead, Hamlin tried a classic NASCAR move to
"rub" Montoya in an effort to get by.  But Hamlin couldn't get enough of
Montoya to spin him.

I'm sure Chip was pleased with the win.  But he was clearly unhappy with
the means to that end.  1-2 was within reach until Pruett got greedy.
But two in the top 5 is still a fabulous day for the Chipster.

Statement from Ganassi:

"That was a vintage Montoya drive from back there," Ganassi said.
"Obviously, the incident down there in Turn 1 with our teammate Scott, I
probably need to take a good look at it to see what happened before I
make any comment."

Pruett needs to be asked what he was thinking (or lack thereof).  What
did his spotters say?    It looked to me that Scott came down on JPM who
had the inside line.

If you watched the replays it looks worse than it really was, the live shot
shows what really happened better. JPM had the inside and was almost to his
door when he braked and SP decided he wasn't going to give it up. I blame SP
for this too, he shouldn't have let JPM get the inside line. JPM passed him
earlier in the race the same exact way, but the difference was SP didn't try
to close the door.. I'm not saying JPM wasn't at fault too, he could have
been more patient, but when has he ever shown patience? They really should
run the cup cars there!

I've probably seen 20 replays of the "incident." To me it's clear that
Pruett came down on Pablo. Pablo was clearly up a ways on Pruett when Pruett
tried to cut him off. Pruett, despite all the talk of him being a great road
racer, has never been to much of a factor in any NASCAR road race.  But he
sure has the whining (or as you'd say "whingeing" down pat.

It all comes down to the fact that Chip knew what he was getting when he

Removing the chicane is one of the best moves I can remember in recent

That was my initial impression. It was an unfortunate combination of an

I have to agree. And while I hated to see the contact, in replay, Pruett
moved over just enough where Montoya had no chance of slowing that 3500

Looked at it on Youtube.  It seems like Montoya's fault to me.  He
comes in from too far back, as Scott is already turning into the
corner.  Montoya also seems to be trying to get out of it right before
contact is made.

The NASCAR cars are not that bad at Watkins Glen and is worth watching
when it is on TV.    I think JPM better be careful because someone
will clip him from behind on a oval if he keeps up the argy bargy.

Nice win by Alex Gurney in the Rolex cars.  He looks like his dad and
a little bit like a better looking version of Schumi.  May have
something to do with his mum being German. Think she was a former
Porsche employee that Dan met in Germany back in the 1960s.

Didn't the Mexican fans almost sit on the track back in the 1960s F1
days?  They made rally fans look safe.

I think Montoya will be good for NASCAR.  I did not like him before
but now I like his personality.  I think he wasted his career leaving
F1.  My guess the pressure at McLaren with super fast Kimi as a
teammate got to be too much.

On the contrary, I think he wasted his career *staying* in F1 for that
last season and a bit. He could've been racing somewhere where he was
doing it for more than the money.

I'm delighted that J-PM shared the Daytona 24 win; I would rather he won
last weekend in slightly less controversial fashion though.

F1 is not the be-all-and-end-all of racing.

We met Alex, team owner Bob Stallings and the team in '05 when they
were still finding their feet in GA. Bob is a true gentleman amateur
who loves racing, a man who was quick enough to be able to lap
steadily and competently in a field with a lot of hardened professionals
but was willing to stand aside to help his team grow.

Alex is a true gent as well as a seriously quick young driver. I hope
this is the first of many wins for them - they've been on the pace for a
while but it's never quite come together.

The only trouble with GA is that there are so many good guys and great
characters in virtually all the cars - a real mix of old pros,
serious amateurs and up-and-coming young racers.

(Well that and the glasshouse is still too wide ;P)

What the hell is everyone thinking?

From the commentary on this thread I expected it to be Pruett's fault, but
it was in fact a classic bonehead move.

Montoya barely got to the _tail_ of Pruett at the end of the braking zone.

I'm so glad he's not in F1 anymore so I don't have to listen to the press
and the anyone-but-schu crowd bleat on in praise of a manouevre that would
have made Sato blush.

Nah. He left F1 because he wanted to actually race - you know, where cars
pass each other frequently.

His run in Mexico will forever define Juan in many ways. This is what he
thrives to do - race.

In F1, the racing part is much more limited.

The point is, irrespective of exactly who's fault it was, allowing for both
drivers to have *some* blame (though the consensus amongst most annalists is
that Juan was too aggressive right there), is that Juan had the faster car,
was the better driver, had fresher tires and was somewhat familiar with this
track.

With 2 laps to go, if Scott was blocking him, then one can see this, but not
with 9 laps to go.

Better for Juan to wait until he's clearly alongside (not his front right
quarter on Scotts' rear one) and then just drive around Scott clean and
allow his teammate to finish second and adhere to team orders (and
professional courtesy) of not taking the other out. Scott, for his part,
made a great recovery himself coming several positions back to finish fifth.
He was clearly the second faster car on the track and that's where he should
have finished.

Personally, I think it was great for these road course pros to show the
stockcar guys a thing or two about tight road courses.

These two had just won the 24 hours of Daytona together with Juan being the
real standout there.

Removing the chicane is one of the best moves I can remember in recent
history. Some incredible moves with guys going 3 abreast and a
tremendous sense of speed. Lots of overtaking too and some solid
racing.

The course features eight tight turns and was tough for many Busch Series
regulars used to negotiating oval tracks.

David Reutiman, who finished 12th in a Toyota, said he had never seen turns
like these in his life.

"I definitely learned a lot," he said. "We had to run off the track one time
but other than that we stayed on course, and they told me if I kept clean I
would come home with a top 15."

Nah, Juan was not close enough - he could have waited a few laps when there
was no dispute - he was surely faster.

Juan's front right quarter tagged Scott's rear quarter. To be "up a ways,"
they would have to be closer to door-to-door, but they weren't, at least
yet. Next lap or so would have been the right time for Juan. Remember, team
orders said don't take the other out.

You're so inaccurate and unfair. Goodness.

Scott has never really had top equipment, but in the few races where he did,
he has fared very well at Watkins Glen and Sears Point. Scott certainly has
been a factor in most of the road course races he raced in these cars. (He
has never even had one complete full season in this series - give him a
break and allow credit where its due.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; But he sure has the whining or as you'd say &quot;whingeing&quot; down pat.

Scott got a little carried away with his comments there, but most felt he
was more right than not. Juan should have waited. Scott even admitted he
would have let Juan go if he was faster.

Scott was plenty fast in his own right - pole - fast lap many times - leader
twice, and after the incident he came from several positions back to finish
a very respectable fifth.

Scott was the second fastest car here and that's exactly what he earned the
right to finish at.

These two were teammates for the 24 hour Daytona win. What a real shame.

&gt;&gt; I've probably seen 20 replays of the &quot;incident.&quot; To me it's clear that
&gt;&gt; Pruett came down on Pablo. Pablo was clearly up a ways on Pruett when
&gt;&gt; Pruett tried to cut him off.

&gt; Nah, Juan was not close enough - he could have waited a few laps when
&gt; there was no dispute - he was surely faster.

&gt; Juan's front right quarter tagged Scott's rear quarter. To be &quot;up a ways,&quot;
&gt; they would have to be closer to door-to-door, but they weren't, at least
&gt; yet. Next lap or so would have been the right time for Juan. Remember,
&gt; team orders said don't take the other out.

&gt;&gt; Pruett, despite all the talk of him being a great road racer, has never
&gt;&gt; been to much of a factor in any NASCAR road race.

&gt; You're so inaccurate and unfair. Goodness.

&gt; Scott has never really had top equipment, but in the few races where he
&gt; did, he has fared very well at Watkins Glen and Sears Point. Scott
&gt; certainly has been a factor in most of the road course races he raced in
&gt; these cars. (He has never even had one complete full season in this
&gt; series - give him a break and allow credit where its due.)

&gt;&gt; But he sure has the whining or as you'd say &quot;whingeing&quot; down pat.

&gt; Scott got a little carried away with his comments there, but most felt he
&gt; was more right than not. Juan should have waited. Scott even admitted he
&gt; would have let Juan go if he was faster.

&gt; Scott was plenty fast in his own right - pole - fast lap many times -
&gt; leader twice, and after the incident he came from several positions back
&gt; to finish a very respectable fifth.

&gt; Scott was the second fastest car here and that's exactly what he earned
&gt; the right to finish at.

&gt; These two were teammates for the 24 hour Daytona win. What a real shame.

&gt;--------------------------------
">

If folks want to contend that Pruett wass the injured party, that's fine.
But what kind of smarts does it take for a driver who is piloting the
clearly slower car and has many more laps on his tires to try to block (in
the turn), the faster car? Whether he's the innocent party or not, Pruett
clearly made the bonehead move. He knew what Pablo was going to do as Pablo
had put the same move on him earlier.

Your logic is overly focused on justifying Juan about what Scott should have
known that you're also overlooking the cardinal sins of racing... Racing 101
teaches you that... If you're the faster car, wait and pick your proper
point and, never take your teammate out in the process. (And since when is
"blocking" not a part of all racing, especially NASCAR?)

Look, I am a Montoya fan and was pulling for him and was elevated with the
race and his win, despite the unfortunate circumstance. I just wish it were
not marred with this kind of detraction away from his promising career.

The "bonehead" thing is not universally agreed upon; in fact, most in the
professional annalist world side with Scott on this one, despite
acknowledging that Scott knew this kind of thing was possible. (One is
supposed to drive around the cars in front of them - not push them aside.)

Besides, sometimes the slower car wins the race because of the difficulty in
getting around a car that is not so much slower than the quicker car,
especially for 9 laps. Scott earned the right to take his chances and hope
Juan made a mistake somewhere, as this happens all the time, and not force
the issue on Scott. Everyone knows in racing that a quicker car and
composure leads to more wins than one without the other.

Yes, because Nascar officials are world renowned for being fair and
