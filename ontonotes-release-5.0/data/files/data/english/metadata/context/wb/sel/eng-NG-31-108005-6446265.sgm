And did I have fun!  I do not want to go back to work today.  I want to quilt
some more.

We left a little later than planned Thursday morning, in the rain.  After we
packed up the car (there was, just barely, room for us) we headed out.  On
the way there, I had to call into for a court status hearing.  But by the
time that call ended, we were ready to stop for breakfast.  We ate a diner in
Jacksonville and had a massive breakfast of omlets, hashbrowns, and toast
(had to fuel up for the quilting).

Back in the car, I had another call from work.  Did they think an inspector
could make it to the landfill on Friday?  Well for crying out load, call an
inspector and see, what did you want me to do, I'm on vacation!!!

We made it to the lodge by noon, and moved in.  We checked in with my Mom,
who was supposed to be coming on Friday.  Turns out her car was still in the
shop and she was afraid she couldn't make it.  The girls and I started to
plan to go pick her up in Peoria.  However, we realized another lady was also
coming on Friday and arranged for Mom to ride with her.  While all these
plans were afoot, I got another call from work.  Inspector is going to
Equistar tomorrow and is sure that they'll ask about the settlement.  Just
tell them you don't know.  Tell them to call me on Monday.  Yes, but I'm
sure..... we can talk about it on Monday.  We can talk on Monday.  ON MONDAY!
Would you people just leave me alone!

In the afternoon, between phone calls, I worked on finishing some BOMs from
2006 and then put the top together.  I hadn't planned on a border, but we
decided it needed a very narrow one.  After a dinner of some very tasty
pizzas, it was back to an evening of sewing.  I laid out some batik BOMs from
2005 and pulled out the pile of batiks I had with me to decide on some
sashing.  Worked on that until about midnight, when I ripped out a row
because I forgot to square up one of my applique blocks, and it was too wide.

Got an early start on Friday.  Looking forward to a full day of sewing, but
horrors, my throat hurts, I'm coughing, I'm stuffy.  I'm getting a cold!!!
We decide we'll have to go into town in the afternoon.  We can stop by the
local winery for another bottle of wine, go to the LQS, and find a drug
store. Finished up the batik top.  It looked fabulous.  Almost lunchtime and
the late arrivals are here.  Another round of setting up.

After lunch, I clean out my bobbin case, change the needle, and put on my
walking foot to quilt a wall hanging.  And my dang thread keeps breaking.
Switch needles, switch thread.  It keeps happening.  Grrr!  We perform
surger, and clean out the tension disks, and the bobbin case.  it is still
breaking!!!!  Finally, we decide, it is not the problem of the top thread,
but the bobbin.  I switch to a prewound bobbin, and it starts to hum along.
But I'm feeling icky, so we go out to the winery, LQS, and grocery store (for
the cold medicine).  I need border fabric anyway.  At the LQS I found some
border fabric and a few other things as well.  (It was on sale!!)

We got back with about an hour to go until dinner so I started in with the
quilting.  After dinner, it was time to initiate the newbies.  They went
"under the sheets", an old game from summer camp days.  We had tons of fun,
and then the practical jokes started.

I worked on the wall hanging until about midnight, took some Nyquil and went
to bed.

Saturday, I quilted on that wall hanging some more.  Why did I decide cross
hatching would be a good idea?  It was taking forever, but kept plugging
along.  Finally finished the quilting after lunch, cut the binding strips and
sewed them to the front.

After dinner, I pulled out a table runner kit I'd had forever.  Got that
pieced and quilted, and the binding sewn to the front.  Realized it was 1
a.m. and decided maybe it was time for bed.  Took some more Nyquil and got
some sleep.

Up by 8 again on Sunday morning.  Finished the binding on the table runner.
And I had time to start on something else before lunch.  So I got out the
wall hanging I'd been working on when I had my rotary cutting accident a few
years ago.  Why was I dreading this.  It's pretty and its going together
beutifully.  Had the last of the block pieced by lunchtime.  After lunch,
cleaned up a little since we'd be leaving in a couple of hours.  Put the
blocks together and started on the borders.  I got the first of three borders
on, and then it was time to pack up and go.  :-(

I can't wait until next year!  Plus, by my calculations, if I  don't start
anything new, I can go on retreat once a year, and maybe finish all my
projects in another 4 or 5 years.

That sounded like so much fun! And it was productive too! Amazing! I'm going
to have to make time for a retreat someday!
Thanks for sharing.

G'day Maureen
That was a lovely account of your retreat - I felt almost there!  Our
guild hasn't had one for a while, they really must get on to it this
year.  Did you eat any chocolate?
I must be having my own retreat at home this week -- I got out a UFO,
pulled out the handquilting I had started, and began machine quilting
yesterday.  I had used the wrong type of batting for handwork.  Should
get it finished this afternoon if I get a move on here....tennis this
morning.  Steady on, I might get the last two UFO'S finished. better
sit down and rest LOL

Hugs to you friend,
Bronnie

&gt; We decide we'll have to go into town in the afternoon.  We can stop by the
&gt; local winery for another bottle of wine, go to the LQS, and find a drug
&gt; store. Finished up the batik top.  It looked fabulous.  Almost lunchtime
&gt; and
&gt; the late arrivals are here.  Another round of setting up.

&gt; After lunch, I clean out my bobbin case, change the needle, and put on my
&gt; walking foot to quilt a wall hanging.  And my dang thread keeps breaking.
&gt; Switch needles, switch thread.  It keeps happening.  Grrr!  We perform
&gt; surger, and clean out the tension disks, and the bobbin case.  it is still
&gt; breaking!!!!  Finally, we decide, it is not the problem of the top thread,
&gt; but the bobbin.  I switch to a prewound bobbin, and it starts to hum
&gt; along.
&gt; But I'm feeling icky, so we go out to the winery, LQS, and grocery store
&gt; (for
&gt; the cold medicine).  I need border fabric anyway.  At the LQS I found some
&gt; border fabric and a few other things as well.  (It was on sale!!)

&gt; We got back with about an hour to go until dinner so I started in with the
&gt; quilting.  After dinner, it was time to initiate the newbies.  They went
&gt; &quot;under the sheets&quot;, an old game from summer camp days.  We had tons of
&gt; fun,
&gt; and then the practical jokes started.

&gt; I worked on the wall hanging until about midnight, took some Nyquil and
&gt; went
&gt; to bed.

&gt; Saturday, I quilted on that wall hanging some more.  Why did I decide
&gt; cross
&gt; hatching would be a good idea?  It was taking forever, but kept plugging
&gt; along.  Finally finished the quilting after lunch, cut the binding strips
&gt; and
&gt; sewed them to the front.

&gt; After dinner, I pulled out a table runner kit I'd had forever.  Got that
&gt; pieced and quilted, and the binding sewn to the front.  Realized it was 1
&gt; a.m. and decided maybe it was time for bed.  Took some more Nyquil and got
&gt; some sleep.

&gt; Up by 8 again on Sunday morning.  Finished the binding on the table
&gt; runner.
&gt; And I had time to start on something else before lunch.  So I got out the
&gt; wall hanging I'd been working on when I had my rotary cutting accident a
&gt; few
&gt; years ago.  Why was I dreading this.  It's pretty and its going together
&gt; beutifully.  Had the last of the block pieced by lunchtime.  After lunch,
&gt; cleaned up a little since we'd be leaving in a couple of hours.  Put the
&gt; blocks together and started on the borders.  I got the first of three
&gt; borders
&gt; on, and then it was time to pack up and go.  :-(

&gt; I can't wait until next year!  Plus, by my calculations, if I  don't start
&gt; anything new, I can go on retreat once a year, and maybe finish all my
&gt; projects in another 4 or 5 years.

&gt; G'day Maureen
&gt; That was a lovely account of your retreat - I felt almost there!  Our
&gt; guild hasn't had one for a while, they really must get on to it this
&gt; year.  Did you eat any chocolate?
&gt; I must be having my own retreat at home this week -- I got out a UFO,
&gt; pulled out the handquilting I had started, and began machine quilting
&gt; yesterday.  I had used the wrong type of batting for handwork.  Should
&gt; get it finished this afternoon if I get a move on here....tennis this
&gt; morning.  Steady on, I might get the last two UFO'S finished. better
&gt; sit down and rest LOL

&gt; Hugs to you friend,
&gt; Bronnie

We ate lots of dark chocolate M n Ms.  Had chocolate cheescake, chocolate
chip cookies, and chocolate trifle for deserts at various times.
