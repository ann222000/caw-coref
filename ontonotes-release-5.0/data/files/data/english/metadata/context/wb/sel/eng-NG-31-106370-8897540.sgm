North American Union driver's license created
Logo intended to standardize documentation across continent
Posted: September 6, 2007

The first &quot;North American Union&quot; driver's license, complete with a
hologram of the North American continent on the reverse, has been
created in the state of North Carolina.

&quot;The North Carolina driver's license is 'North American Union' ready,&quot;
charges William Gheen, who serves as president of Americans for Legal
Immigration.

Gheen provided WND with a photo of an actual North Carolina license
which clearly shows the hologram of the North American continent
embedded on the reverse.

&quot;The hologram looks exactly [like] the map of North America that is used
as the background for the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North
America logo on the SPP website,&quot; Gheen told WND. &quot;I object to the loss
of sovereignty that is proceeding under the agreements being made by
these unelected government bureaucrats who think we should be North
American instead of the United States of America.&quot;

In 2005, WND reported North Carolina was the state where illegal
immigrants go to get a driver's license, with busloads of aliens
traveling south on I-95 to get an easy ID.

The Tar Heel State's requirements to obtain a license are weaker than
those of many surrounding states.

Marge Howell, spokeswoman for the North Carolina DMV, affirmed to WND
the state was embedding a hologram of North America on the back of its
new driver's licenses.

&quot;It's a security element that eventually will be on the back of every
driver's license in North America,&quot; Howell told WND.

Damn the dumbing down. Have you ever read the US Constitution and Bill of
Rights? You have the whole thing ass-backwards. The US constitution
leaves everything not mentioned to the people by default.

Amendment IX
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be
construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.

Once you allow the government to make something a government granted
privilege it will hold that over the heads of people for everything under
the sun and use it as an excuse to steal from the people. People think
driving is a government granted privilege because that's what government
has said for decades. Since that most of the population thinks that's true,
it has gone about doing away due process, innocent until proven guilty,
etc and so forth for most everything driving related and has tied
everything from child support to good grades to being allowed by the
government to drive. What next? We have to be blindly supportive of the
government or else lose our DL? At what point do we cut off this
nonsense?

That's for powers. He was saying there are no 'rights' beyond what is
specifically mentioned. 9 applies to his statement, not 10.

I am not arguing the state governments cannot regulate driving, they can
as per 10 (feds cannot, but use blackmail to achieve the same ends, which
is why DLs are becoming stealth federal ID cards, see RealID act).
Regulation and privilege are two very different things, but people were
duped into thinking that regulation made something a privilege.

Moron... nice projection there.  I suggest you actually understand what
was written before spouting off. It sounds like you're one of the masses
who has fallen for the D vs. R brainwashing. I have no more time to waste
on you idiots. Your 'team' is good, the other 'team' is bad. Meanwhile
you have no grasp what so ever on the topics you spew on.

The Bill of Rights was not meant to cover everything, that's why it left
everything rights wise not mentioned to the people.

BTW, for the most part, with very few exceptions, the people don't make
laws. If you can find a law that the people 'made', one brought about
from the people casting votes that made driving a government granted
privilege where government could tie anything it wants to driving, sieze
your property, demand payment of fines, etc on mere accusation alone, well
just cite it.

Geez... I just went and looked at the damned WND article that the
original poster cited and it's not even a map of North America in the
first place!

It's a projection of the globe, centered on NA, with SA dribbling off to
the bottom right, western Europe and Africa peaking around the
right-hand edge and eastern Australia and New Guinea at the bottom left.

Here's a clue.  If you think you need more than one exclamation mark, then
don't post your remark.

The point, which went whooshing over your head, is that in spite of our use
of the word American to mean citizen of the United States, the rest of the
hemisphere (i.e, South *America* and the non-US part of North *America*)
may use the adjective to describe themselves.  Without claiming US
citizenship.

What's the level of complexity of a task before the state's allowed to
intervene and require you to get permission to perform it?

Obviously, you think that driving a car meets that standard. What else
does? What doesn't?

What's the level of risk before the state can regulate it?

Is raising a child safe? Safe for you? Safe for the child? Safe for
society?

How about eating fatty foods?
