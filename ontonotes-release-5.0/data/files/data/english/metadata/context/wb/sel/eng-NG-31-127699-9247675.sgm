No fonts at all in XMMS for a very very long time now. The options alongide
the text gets displayed properly like Shift+L and Control + 3.

Switched to audacious looong back. Looking at the number of plugins and the
desklets for xmms make me want to get back to it.

Does anyone know the package I need for the fonts to render right on X?

I do have some sort of a solution :
http://www.fell.it/2007/07/26/no-button-font-on-gtk1-applications/

But i cant seem to set them globally. XMMS fonts render properly only if I
launch them from a terminal.  I dont. I use alt+f2 with alltray^ :). AND it
throws up warnings saying :

Gdk-WARNING **: locale not supported by C library

^ http://alltray.sourceforge.net/ :)

Have you tried this:
do sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales;
and on the second screen select &quot;None&quot; for the Default locale.

you meant
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales;
without the do (and with or without the semicolons.)

I have.

It doesn't give me any options at all. Runs itself off. Here it is:

spranesh@core2duo:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales;

This is the first time I am using dpkg. Am i doing something wrong?

On Debian it allows you to configure what all locales you want.
Are you using Ubuntu?

It is some locales and font problem and usually the dpkg-reconfigure
locales trick works. Also just check if you have &quot;xfonts-base&quot; package
installed.

FIXED :)

while logging in (at the GTK+ greeting screen) where you select session.
There is an option there called choose language.
I set that US English, made it default and everything works perfectly now.

:( - The ubuntu way of doing things. Make them guied. I dont have much
choice.

Saw the link halfwar through typing this message. Right HERE! :)

don't have much choice .. cotd.. Nothing really works on the G965
motherboard that I have. Half the linux kernels dont recognise my hdd or
cdrom drive. Those that do, spew :
&quot;job control turned off. tty error&quot;
during booting of the live cd.

I have come across only the foll that managed to work on the g965:
-Suse 10. 2+
-Fedora 6 +
-Ubuntu 7+

I would choose the deb system of the above 3 - any day.
I tried etch yest, but it cupped badly.

So I guess it is just ubuntu for now. Till newer dists release with better
support for the Intel g965.

P.S. I rem Hula said you can get around this problem by installing silicon
drivers as a module for kernels. Yet to try it out. No fundaes on modprobing
and kernel compilation yet.

Make sure your debconf priority is low.
sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow locales.

As a follow-up and an urge to get this dpkg thing fixed, this is the output
i get:

spranesh@core2duo:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow locales

I'd advise you to try out the daily build of the Debian
installer. Search for Kmap's earlier mail about the Debian net
install.
