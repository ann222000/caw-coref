&gt; Time for the Truth About Black Crime Rates
&gt; The lessons of the Sean Bell case

&gt; 2 April 2007

&gt; Mayor Mike Bloomberg has the chance to transform not just New York,
&gt; but all American cities, by breaking the taboo on talking about the
&gt; connection between race and crime. Doing so would take courage that no
&gt; politician has yet mustered. But after the manslaughter and assault
&gt; indictments of three New York police officers for fatally shooting
&gt; Sean Bell last November, Bloomberg has an opening: acknowledge that
&gt; police officers may react too precipitously to perceived threats in
&gt; charged urban settings, in exchange for a wide-open discussion about
&gt; the sky-high black crime rates that encourage that reaction. Crime,
&gt; not police racism, drives negative police-community relations in black
&gt; neighborhoods. And until the crime rate comes down, tragedies like the
&gt; Sean Bell shooting may reoccur.

&gt; After the Bell shooting, which occurred outside a Queens strip joint,
&gt; critics of the NYPD followed the usual script: increasingly ugly
&gt; charges of police bigotry (despite the fact that several of the
&gt; officers involved were black); deployment of the threat-of-black-riots
&gt; weapon; calls for convictions of the officers on the most severe
&gt; murder charges; and the transformation of the highly aberrant Bell
&gt; shooting into the very symbol of the NYPD. To his discredit, Mayor
&gt; Bloomberg joined the rush to prejudge the officers. The day after the
&gt; shooting, he declared: &quot;It sounds to me like excessive force was
&gt; used.&quot; Even more irresponsibly, he deemed the incident &quot;inexplicable,&quot;
&gt; thus fueling the belief that the officers could not possibly have
&gt; perceived a deadly threat and all but guaranteeing that any acquittal
&gt; of them would be viewed as proof that the criminal-justice system was
&gt; antiblack.

&gt; Carefully omitted from the swirl of media coverage and the
&gt; denunciations of the NYPD was any discussion of black crime rates. The
&gt; New York Times did its usual best to shroud the issue. A March
&gt; article, for instance, devoted itself to charges that the police were
&gt; preying on the black community. After noting that more than half the
&gt; people whom cops stop and frisk are black, Times reporter Diane
&gt; Cardwell added: &quot;City officials maintained that those stopped and
&gt; searched roughly parallel the race of people mentioned in reports from
&gt; crime victims.&quot; No, actually, there is no &quot;rough parallel&quot; between the
&gt; proportion of stops and the proportion of alleged assailants: blacks
&gt; aren't stopped enough, considering the rate at which they commit
&gt; crimes. Though blacks, 24 percent of New York City's population,
&gt; committed 68.5 percent of all murders, rapes, robberies, and assaults
&gt; in the city last year, according to victims and witnesses, they were
&gt; only 55 percent of all stop-and-frisks. Of course, the Times didn't
&gt; give the actual crime figures. Even a spate of vicious assaults on
&gt; police officers in the week before the indictments didn't change the
&gt; predominant story line that officers were trigger-happy racists.

&gt; But the context of the Bell shooting suggests a different picture. The
&gt; undercover officers and detectives involved had been deployed to Club
&gt; Kahlua in Jamaica, Queens, because of the club's history of
&gt; lawlessness. Club patrons and neighbors had made dozens of calls to
&gt; the NYPD, reporting guns, drug sales, and prostitution, and the police
&gt; had recently made eight arrests there.

&gt; The night of November 24, undercover officer Gescard Isnora, who fired
&gt; the first shots at Bell, had observed a man put a stripper's hand on
&gt; his belt to reassure her that he had a gun and would protect her from
&gt; an aggressive customer. Outside the club, Isnora (who is
&gt; African-American) and his colleagues witnessed a heated exchange
&gt; between Bell's entourage and an apparent pimp over the services of a
&gt; prostitute, during which the pimp kept his hand inside his jacket, as
&gt; if holding a gun. After the hooker refused to have sex with more than
&gt; two of the group's eight members, Bell-presumably referring to the
&gt; pimp-said, &quot;Let's fuck him up,&quot; and Bell's companion, Joseph Guzman,
&gt; said, &quot;Yo, get my gun, get my gun.&quot; Isnora reported these exchanges
&gt; over his cell phone to his colleagues in the area.

&gt; Feeling the danger level mounting, Isnora retrieved his gun from his
&gt; unmarked car. When he returned to the scene, Bell and his two
&gt; companions had gotten into their car, ready to drive away. Isnora
&gt; thought that a drive-by shooting of the pimp could be imminent, and so
&gt; moved to question the car's occupants. He held out his badge (by his
&gt; account), identified himself as a police officer, and told the car to
&gt; stop. Instead, Bell drove forward and hit Isnora and a police minivan,
&gt; backed up, and then slammed into the minivan again, nearly hitting
&gt; Isnora a second time.

&gt; Isnora, who was standing on the passenger side of Bell's car, claims
&gt; that he saw Guzman reach for his waistband. Believing that he faced a
&gt; deadly threat, Isnora opened fire. The four other undercovers and
&gt; detectives at the scene also started shooting, killing Bell and
&gt; wounding Guzman and Bell's other companion in the car, Trent
&gt; Benefield. No gun turned up in Bell's car. (Benefield alleges that
&gt; Isnora began shooting before the car started moving, which is absurd.
&gt; The barrage of 50 bullets was so fast that no witness at the scene
&gt; remembers hearing more than eight rounds fired off. Bell was
&gt; undoubtedly killed as soon as the shooting started, and so wouldn't
&gt; have been able to move the car forward and back and forward again, as
&gt; he did. None of the officers had ever used their guns before,
&gt; moreover, despite making hundreds of arrests, including for gun
&gt; possession. These were not trigger-happy cops.)

&gt; Without question, the results of this episode are horrific. And the
&gt; tactics stank-Isnora should never have left himself as exposed as he
&gt; was. But was the officers' perception of a deadly threat so
&gt; unreasonable as to make their shooting a criminal homicide? If a judge
&gt; or jury finds that they did not reasonably believe that they faced an
&gt; imminent use of deadly force, then, according to the woefully
&gt; inappropriate criminal code, their actions fall within the literal
&gt; definition of manslaughter. (Showing what appears to be arbitrariness,
&gt; the grand jury indicted two of the officers for manslaughter and
&gt; assault-even though one of them, Isnora, did not even hit Bell-and a
&gt; third for reckless endangerment, but didn't indict the remaining two
&gt; officers, even though all had fired their guns.)

&gt; Isnora and his colleagues knew the following, when they saw a car
&gt; racing toward them whose occupants they believed could have guns:
&gt; shootings at after-hours joints like Club Kahlua are by no means
&gt; uncommon. Just the previous month, a patron had been fatally gunned
&gt; down outside another Queens club, the third lethal shooting there in
&gt; three years. This March, a club customer in Brooklyn tried to blast an
&gt; off-duty cop's head off after the two had unintentionally bumped into
&gt; each other on a crowded dance floor.

&gt; Isnora and his colleagues did not know the following, but it's a
&gt; further indication of the reality of crime in New York: Bell,
&gt; Benefield, and Guzman had all been arrested for gun possession in the
&gt; past, according to the New York Times. Further, Guzman had a long
&gt; prison record, including a sentence for an armed robbery during which
&gt; he shot at his victim. And Bell and his entourage were dealing drugs,
&gt; an activity highly correlated with violence.

&gt; These specific facts about the Bell shooting are just a few of the
&gt; hundreds of thousands of data points that reveal a hard truth: any
&gt; given violent crime in New York is 13 times more likely to have a
&gt; black than a white perpetrator. While most black residents are
&gt; law-abiding and desperately deserve police protection, the incidence
&gt; of criminal activity among young black males is off the charts. &quot;A
&gt; black kid between the ages of 18 and 24 is the scariest thing to
&gt; cops,&quot; says a police attorney, &quot;because they know how crazy it can
&gt; get.&quot; And this is true whatever the officer's race.

&gt; The &quot;public doesn't get how frightened cops are,&quot; says a former NYPD
&gt; commanding officer. &quot;Cops are reluctant to articulate everything that
&gt; goes into a shooting incident,&quot; says another former officer, retired
&gt; assistant chief Jim McShane. &quot;They're afraid to say: 'Are you kidding
&gt; me? I was terrified. The guy was drinking; I told him to stop; I was
&gt; afraid that someone was going to get shot.' &quot; When an officer thinks
&gt; that he is under deadly threat, he knows that any hesitation could
&gt; cost him his life. NYPD officer Steven McDonald was staring down the
&gt; barrel of a small gun in Central Park in the summer of 1986, held by a
&gt; 15-year-old whom he had stopped to question about a stolen bicycle.
&gt; Rather than immediately responding with deadly force, he paused-and
&gt; was shot twice in the head and once in the arm, paralyzing him from
&gt; the neck down.

&gt; Because of these realities, it's possible that officers are quicker to
&gt; perceive-and react to-a deadly threat when dealing with young black
&gt; men than they would be with other demographic groups. (Even so, fatal
&gt; shootings by the NYPD are extremely rare; fatal shootings of unarmed
&gt; civilians, even rarer.) And it's undeniably true that the much greater
&gt; incidence of crime in black neighborhoods means that the police
&gt; activity there will be higher, leading to a greater risk of the use of
&gt; force.

&gt; The NYPD's goal at this point-understandably and rightly-is to do
&gt; everything it can to prevent the death of another Sean Bell. The
&gt; department's recently announced tactical review is more than
&gt; justified. But the police can only go so far in ensuring that tragic
&gt; errors, when they inevitably happen, do not happen to black males.
&gt; Mayor Bloomberg has already pandered enough to antipolice activists.
&gt; He should now cash in his political chips and speak the truth: the
&gt; black crime rate is the most important determinant of how the police
&gt; interact with the black community. Unless black leaders-real or
&gt; media-created-muster the will to address the crime epidemic among
&gt; black youth (most of it inflicted on other blacks), the ongoing
&gt; carnage will almost inevitably include an infinitesimal number of
&gt; accidental police shootings of unarmed men. Criminal activity among
&gt; young African-Americans is the poison of cities and of race relations;
&gt; if Bloomberg can force a conversation about it, he could help reclaim
&gt; urban America
