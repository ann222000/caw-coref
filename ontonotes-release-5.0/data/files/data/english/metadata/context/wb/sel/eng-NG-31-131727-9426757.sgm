I have been hearing about this list for a while. Just joined. I play
bass for a bluegrass band here in NY, but I also get hired frequently
by other area bands.

I look forward to reading and joining the discussions here.

Because Rick is new, he needs to know that some members are fond of saying that the list is moribund, dead, etc.  The reality is, Rick, that this list has a pretty small (I prefer to say &quot;elite&quot;) membership.  Weeks can go by with no posts.  But it is a great resource if you have a question or a comment related to playing bass.  If you put something out, you will normally get several responses.  And it is more personal in my opinion than the larger lists that have hundreds of posts every day.  To each his own, of course, but I have gotten some very helpful information from this list.  So welcome, Rick.

Okay, in an effort to rejuvenate...

As some of you might remember, I purchased a Shen bass from Upton Bass
during the summer. Despite the wonderful guidance from Kip Martin (thank you
yet again!), when it came to ordering it on the phone, I was at times at a
loss. This was my first bass purchase, but they try to customize it for you.
When you don't know diddly, it's hard to answer all of their questions! They
said &quot;what kind of strings do you want?&quot; and I said &quot;I don't know.&quot; I told
them I planned to play bluegrass, and they recommended Upton Blacks.

Anyway, the bass arrived; the strings seemed fine and were great to learn
on, except that at jams, especially outdoors, I felt as if I couldn't be
heard. Long story made short, I bought some D'Addario Helicore Pizzicato
medium tension strings. Oh, my...What a difference! This bass is so alive
now that I really can't believe it. I've had them on for about a month now,
and have had lots of compliments about the sound of it (ummmm, not
necessarily my playing).

Thanks to all involved in past discussions about suggested string types and
brands. Given how expensive they are, I doubt I'll do much experimenting,
and at least for the moment, I don't need to. I'm looking forward to hearing
how it sounds once the bass matures, but for right now, I think I have a
winning combination.

this is a good example of my axiom, &quot;No One Set of Strings Sounds Good On
All Basses&quot;. ive heard the Upton Blacks sound GREAT on a bass owned by Mark
Fain. and I hate how medium strings sound on my basses.

Recently, through a series of trades and an old debt owed me, i acquired a
blonde Engelhardt Swingmaster. it needs a new bridge, better endpin,
aircraft cable tailpiece wire, and a neck scrape. I use it for my rockabilly
gigs and tried a few sets of strings on it. it sounds best with a full set
of Obligatos on it, but I cant slap those heavy, tacky strings for 3 sets.
got blisters the size of Lake Erie. so I put SuperSilvers on and they sound
OK--especially when im standing on it or playing it behind my head. in
rockabilly, its not how you sound, but how your hair looks. I use AquaNet
Extra Super Hold to get my hair up to the proper height.

Glad you are happy with that bass. Shen basses are muy fina.

I don't mind the low noise level on the list, but it has been a while since anyone has really started a discussion. hows this:

my 10 favorite bluegrass/country bassists (based on who I really listen to and study and enjoy):

1. marshall wilborn--king of tastefulness
2. earl yager--king of drive and my mentor
3. tom gray--king of walking and cool lines
4. mike bub--king of not sounding like anyone else
5. mark fain--king of the totally pro approach
6. missy raines--queen of interesting notes (maybe my favorite lately)
7. jake tulloch--king of simpicity
8. jennie keel--queen of going out on a limb and bringing it back
9. joe zinkan--king of country upright
10. bob moore--the real king of bass

im sure I missed someone.

anyone have a wildly different list than me? I know archie will agree with 5 of mine, and probably come up with 5 I didn't list.

I've only seen one bassist who did those two tricks.  He'd stand on the bass
perched on the front edge of the stage looking like he was about to topple into the crowd.  To end the show he spun
the bass and hopped on for a ride, jumping off and hitting the last note...  just a little behind the drums.
Kind of an oops, but still really fun to watch.

So was it you playing with C.C.Adcock when he (they, you) opened
for Robin Ford at the Cabooze in Minneapolis sometime in the later '90's?   Funny how the opening act made a
much bigger impression than the headliner that night.

Hey Kip,

I see you're back online.  Does that mean you have a day job with online
service? haha

Thanks for putting me onto that American Standard #95.  I'm hoping the
new bridge comes in today.  Here's what I did to rehab it.
1.  Reglued fingerboard
2.  Closed seams front and back
3.  New endpin
4.  Aircraft cable for tailpiece
5.  Stripped and refinished-varnish/ french polished shellac
6.  New strings- Obligatos-  Wanted to try Super Silvers but they
were                    back-ordered with no delivery date mentioned (Lemur)
7.  New bridge with one piece aluminum adjusters.

Lots of time and effort.

Pictures?
I just finished up working on an AS I picked up this summer.  I put a new
fingerboard on (from Upton, they're nice!), dressed it,  shimmed the neck to
raise the bridge height for better bowing.  I made a new nut, put a new
soundpost in, thinned the neck, added a new bridge, cable.... Now it's ready
to find a good home!
They are really impressive sounding instruments.  And I have two more I'm
working on.
If anyone is looking for one, I'd be happy to send pictures.

Oh this fun, Here's my BG bass hero list:

1.  Roy Huskey Jr.  Tone, Taste, Timing, and fast son of a gun.  the best...
ever.
2.  Barry Bales  some of the most inventive fills in any music.  and his
tone is not human. and he's a click track...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZHeVtnaiVQ
3.  Jason Moore  Drive, energy
4.  Marshall Wilborn  So Smooth
5.  Mark Schatz-  his stuff on Fleck's &quot;Drive&quot; is unreal.
6.  Mike Bub- in the words of Grisman at Grey Fox &quot;the most pumpin' bass
player... ever&quot;
7.  Tom Gray-  His intro on &quot;Rider&quot;  made me want to play bass
8.  Todd Phillips-  Bluegrass Album Band... enough said
9.  Junior Huskey-  on the old Louvin Bros stuff... yes sir
10. Byron House-  INSANE runs and keeps the Groove.  Wicked Tone.

Best,
Josh

On my tinny computer speaker Barry actually SOUNDS like a click track.

By the way, did you notice you only see his back in the video?  Bass players get no respect.

PS - There must be someone on this list that can introduce me to Alison...

thanks for the welcome messages folks. i am glad this sparked some new
discussion. Kip, those are some of my favorite bassists too. I'll see
if I can add a few later.

I'm using those Upton Blacks on my old ply Meisel. I LOVE them. Great
volume and tone. And I can slap them all day.

At the risk of offending half the listserv, I will again quote my philosophy
on this topic.  Slapping the bass is like slapping one's intimate partner.
You should only do it if asked.

I tried replying to this before. Don`t know what happened but it came back. Let`s try it again.

That is a great room. A funny story, The guy that owns the local pub in that little village opened up just for thew concert. I think he was Johns brother&lt;?&gt; Anyway, John thought they would out drink the Yanks. Jimmy &amp; I were the only ones to go to this pub, They did`nt know I was practically raised on Guiness &amp; Jimmy drank nothing but import beer , long story short, they said we drank pretty good for a couple of Yanks!

Mark Fain--member of Ricky Skaggs band for the past 13 years. Also recorded
with Alan Jackson, Bruce Hornsbey, Sting, and Elton John.

Jenny Keel--has played with husband Larry Keel, as well as Vassar Clements,
Tony Rice, and David Via

Joe Zinkin--has played on the Opry 1000 times with Brenda Lee, Loretta Lynn,
George Jones, the Delmore Brothers, the Louvins, Patsy Cline, Porter
Wagoner, Kitty Wells, etc. I'm just scratching the surface.

Bob Moore--the most recorded bassist in history with over 17,000 recordings
ranging from sessions with Elvis, Hank Williams, Jimmy Martin, Lester Flatt,
Patsy Cline (that's him on 'Crazy'), Johnny Carrol, Marty Robbins, Jerry Lee
Lewis, Johnny Cash, Nick Lowe, George Jones, etc. I was told that at one
time, he was the bassist on all 10 of the C&amp;W Top 10 songs.

Joe Zinkan and Bob Moore both played on a number of bluegrass recordings as
well - in fact, I believe Bob came to town with Flatt &amp; Scruggs when they
moved from Knoxville in 1953.

Two more to mention (as long as we're not restricted to the living):

Floyd 'Lightning' Chance - Check out Peter Rowan's 'Walls of Time' album for
a prime example of pure bass.
Mike Paisley - another pure (as in unadorned but rock solid) Bass player.
Can't say much about him except that he is *there* always.
Dewey Renfro - Played high 'C' string setup (C-G-D-A) on a standup bass. I
later found C strings at International Violin in Baltimore and strung up my
old Kay M-1 that way for awhile.

Coolest bass ever: (Porter Wagoner's bass player) Speck Rhodes' Gibson EB-1,
with the big stick.

Funny! Ive had service at home from the first day I moved here. But Google
was acting up.

And seriously, I WAS wondering what was up with the list with all the
conspicuous lack of verbosity going on. I always like the '10 Best List'
thing, so I thought id throw it out there and see if I could generate some
discussion. Then someone threw out the 'Best Room' topic and I liked that
too. All of the sudden, the list was blabbing away!

Hows this for yet another topic?

If you could have front row tickets to see ANY bass player, electric or
upright, in the history of the instrument, who would it be? Pick ONE
bassist.

Id pick Nashville session upright player Dave Roe who plays evenings at
Roberts Western World with the Don Kelly Band.

&gt; If you could have front row tickets to see ANY bass player, electric or

For me, it would be to revisit and hear Roy Huskey play again.  To watch those incredible stretches he could do and hear him become his own compressor as he played the room.

I saw him play once at the IBMA awards show in O'Boro and then one time with Emmylou at MerleFest as part of the Nash Ramblers.  He was the bomb for me.

I've played bass (actually compared mine to his) with Barry Bales, I've watched Todd Phillips in a jam at Wintergrass a couple years back.  That's 2 other influences for me, done been there, done that.  I've also traded licks with Tom Gray while we were checking out basses at Louisville during the IBMA at the trade show.  There's also been some lick trading with John Shuffler here at home.  Heck, I even had to stunt double for John a few years back when he fell at The Old Rock School and messed up his knee.

If I had to make a decision about who I'd want to listen to that is still living, it would probably be Marshall Wilborn.  Taste, tone and timing for the music that moves me.  And maybe Bob Moore.

Sorry, I couldn't resist.  &lt;G&gt;

I would choose Mark King, bassist/singer of Level 42. Why? Search for him or Level 42 on youtube and you'll see why. Also, because he hasn't been stateside for any tours since the 80's, it seemingly would take a miracle to get him here, whereas there is a much greater likelihood that I can see any other US-based bassist (ha!) regardless of style or sound.

The earlier vote for LeFaro was good too.

I'm with you Kip, the first time I saw Dave Roe was this past IBMA in Nashville when he played with Kathy Mattea on
the main stage for Fan Fest.  I was taken with the ease of his slap and at the same time the power, tone and drive he was able to give to a tune that was not all that fast.  Each year I find a new treat and this time it was Dave Roe.

Kip:

I think he donated the old Italian bass (the twin to Ray Browns when he had it) to the Country Music Museum in Nashville. Thats the one (all gut) he did many of his recordings with.
Somehow I think he could make even a Palatino sound OK.
I'm told Bob is also Dennis Crouch's main influence.

and what can I say about this guy? I believe he played with the gillis
