Room For Jesus

“And she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.”
Luke 2:7 (NASB)

One of the first words that come to mind when most think about the holiday season is “busy.” Sad, but true. We are busy decorating the house, baking goodies, shopping for presents, planning parties, attending Christmas plays, and writing out our Christmas cards. Then, just when we think we’ve got a handle on it, we receive that unexpected card in the mail or the neighbor brings us a fruit cake. What do we do? We find time to return the gesture.

In fact, we find time and make the room to do all sorts of things during the holidays. We make room for company to come. We make room in front of the picture window for the Christmas tree. We even make room in the kitchen cabinets to store the extra cooking ingredients we need to make our favorite holiday dishes. Let me ask you this…have you made room for Jesus this season?

In the familiar story of Christ’s birth, I’ve always been bothered that there was no room in the inn for Jesus. I can’t help but think, Didn’t they know who He was? What could have been so important that they couldn’t stop to make room for Jesus? My best guess is they were thinking only about themselves and their own busy agenda. In doing so, they missed Jesus.

Likewise, we can become so busy with our Christmas agenda that we can miss Jesus, too. Instead, we should approach the season with expectancy. If we make the time and room for Jesus, I know He will show up! My nephew taught me that.

One of my mother’s Christmas traditions is to withhold baby Jesus from her nativity set until Christmas morning. One year, when her firstborn grandson was about three years old, he asked her, “Grandmamma, where is baby Jesus?”

“He’s not been born yet,” she explained to Patrick. “Jesus comes on Christmas Day. Then, you’ll find Him lying right here,” she added while pointing to the manger.

Like years past, Christmas came. Mom’s and Dad’s house was full of excitement as each family member arrived with their arms full of presents. We expected to exchange gifts and enjoy a time for food, fun, and celebration. Patrick expected something different. He came running into the house shouting, “Is He here, yet? Is He here? Has Jesus come?”

Mother took Patrick over to the nativity and there, cradled in the manger, was baby Jesus. He had come just like He had promised.

Over 2,000 years ago, God promised us a Savior. In a little town called Bethlehem, God kept His promise and Christ our Lord was born. While most missed what was happening that holy night, Christ’s birth didn’t escape the attention of heaven, a few shepherds, three Wise men, and some cattle. They pushed aside their duties and agendas to make room for Jesus. In fact, like Patrick, some of them anticipated His arrival. In doing so, their lives were forever changed.

Every year Jesus still searches for hearts to fill. The trouble is He can only fill the space you and I allow for Him. Will you make room in your heart for Jesus this season?

Christ’s presence may go unnoticed by the world, but you and I, along with heaven, a few shepherds, three wise men, and others who have made room in their hearts, can experience all the glorious wonder that He brings.

I invite you to throw away your busy agenda this year. I nstead, make room for Christ to come. Anticipate His arrival and experience Christmas like never before!

Dear Lord, The best I know how, I lay down my busy agenda to make room for You. Jesus, I don’t want to miss a thing. Give me fresh eyes to see You anew this holiday season. I want to experience Your birth like never before so that I never close You out again. Welcome home, Lord. In Jesus’ Name, Amen.

Midi: &quot;Hallelujah&quot;

Days of Heaven on Earth 12-14-07

So familiar are the vine and the branches, it is not necessary to explain that the branches and the vine are one. The vine does not say, &quot;I am the central trunk and you are the little branches.&quot; Rather it acknowledges, &quot;I am the whole thing, and you are the whole thing.&quot; Jesus counts us partakers of His nature. Without me ye can do nothing. The husband and the wife and many other illustrations contribute to our understanding of this marvelous teaching. It has no parallel, no precedent in any other teaching: that Christ is the life of His people, and we are absolutely linked with and dependent upon Him. All other systems teach how much man is and may become. Christianity shows how a man must lose all he is if he would come into full unity with Christ in His life. Lord, help me this day to abide in Thee. Oh! what a wonderful place Jesus has given to me! Saved by His glorious grace, I may be even as He.

Scripture
He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing—John 15:5

The Freedom of the Will

The Responsibility of Choice

Our Lord Jesus looked after the rich young ruler as he walked away, but He did not follow him or attempt to coerce him. The dignity of the young man's humanity forbade that his choices should be made for him by another. To remain a man he must make his own moral choices; and Christ knew this and permitted him to go his own chosen way. If his human choice took him at last to hell, at least he went there a man; and it is better for the moral universe that he should do so than that he should be jockeyed to a heaven he did not choose, a soulless, will-less automaton. God will take nine steps toward us, but He will not take the tenth. He will incline us to repent, but He cannot do our repenting for us. It is of the essence of repentance that it can only be done by the one who committed the act to be repented of. God can wait on the sinning man; He can withhold judgment; He can exercise long-suffering to the point where He appears &quot;lax&quot; in His judicial administration; but He cannot force a man to repent. To do this would be to violate the man's freedom and void the gift God originally bestowed upon him. Where there is no freedom of choice there can be neither sin nor righteousness, because it is of the nature of both that they be voluntary. However good an act may be, it is not good if it is imposed from without. The act of imposition destroys the moral content of the act and renders it null and void.

Prayer
O God, so important are the choices before me. You have given me personal responsibility of choice. Thank You for the revelation of Your will to guide me and the presence of Your Spirit to enable me!

Scripture
Jesus looked at him and loved him, &quot;One thing you lack,&quot; he said. &quot;Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.&quot; At this the man's face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.
— Mark 10:21-22

Thought
Moving, isn't it. Jesus loved the young man who sadly went away. That rich young ruler made his choice as we make ours. Others cannot choose for us or repent for us. We are personally responsible for our choices.
