The frustrations are not in the world, they are in your mind.
When you want 'this' but get 'that', then there is the pain of

As far as Zen goes,

A Zen person is not bound by the way of the valley, but
he or she is free to make use of it.

A Zen person is not bound by the way of the mountain,
but he or she is free to make use of it.

A Rinzai person might say, &quot;kill that, too.&quot;  But the larger
picture involves skillful means, vehicles, freedom of
religion, and so forth.

And kill that, too.  But only as a discrimination in one's
own mind.  To fully come up to the level of the Zen
teachings one must be able to make skillful use of
discriminations, without losing sight of the seamless whole:
outside of all discrimination.  Gaining that &quot;sight&quot; in the
first place is the focus of most beginning-Zen training
practices (jorikis notwithstanding).  The practice
*continues* beyond that.  Koans which tend to be used in
later-stage training are called &quot;nanto koans.&quot;

There's a lot of it about. Power can go to peoples heads. Doesn't matter if
it's the internet, government, or a customer in a shop. You get similar
problems when someone is promoted to management. The smart people get over
this. It might take a few weeks or months, depending. The idiots are the

&gt;&gt;Perhaps you are transferring some other stuff,

&gt;&gt;from some other ongoing ego-battle threads?  That state

&gt;&gt;of mind does tend to cloud the awareness.

&gt;&gt;If we must ego-battle, I expected more of you.

&gt; Great expectations?

&gt;&gt;What does the circle around the Yin-Yang symbol represent?

&gt; You tell me.  Is it important?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As far as Zen goes,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  A Zen person is not bound by the way of the valley, but
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  he or she is free to make use of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  A Zen person is not bound by the way of the mountain,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  but he or she is free to make use of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I've heard that sort of free-choice language used
&gt;&gt;&gt;before by masters.  It's talking down to folks who
&gt;&gt;&gt;are still making 'decisions'.  What do you say?

&gt;&gt;&gt;What is the valley?   Don't say yin.
&gt;&gt;&gt;What is the mountain?   Don't say yang.

&gt;&gt;Why should I say?

&gt; To validate your apparent claims.

&gt; I'll answer.

&gt; Valley is valley, not low.
&gt; Mountain is mountain, not high.
&gt; Tall grass can't hide the sound of the brook.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A Rinzai person might say, &quot;kill that, too.&quot;  But the larger
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;picture involves skillful means, vehicles, freedom of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;religion, and so forth.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And kill that, too.  But only as a discrimination in one's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;own mind.  To fully come up to the level of the Zen
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;teachings one must be able to make skillful use of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;discriminations, without losing sight of the seamless whole:
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;outside of all discrimination.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Do tell.  It isn't like that at all.

&gt;&gt;No, it's nothing like that at all.  Keynes assures us.

&gt; The Buddha assures us it is not thinkable.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Gaining that &quot;sight&quot; in the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;first place is the focus of most beginning-Zen training
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;practices (jorikis notwithstanding).  The practice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*continues* beyond that.  Koans which tend to be used in
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;later-stage training are called &quot;nanto koans.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;That's the plan more or less (from a beginner's view.)

&gt;&gt;So you agree with that, at least?  More or less?

&gt; It isn't completely accurate, but so what.
&gt; Why are you telling me this stuff?
&gt; Do I need your instructions and corrections?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Having uttered these words, I now must retract them.  ;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Too late for that.  You've lost your virginity.  Twice.

&gt;&gt;Talk about contention.  Man, you do seem about ready to
&gt;&gt;crash.  The &quot;retract&quot; thing was a reference to a Buddha
&gt;&gt;quote that I posted a few weeks back.

&gt; It's also elementary zen speak used by many masters
&gt; and many more zen pretenders.

&gt;&gt;I wish I could lose my virginity a few more times, but
&gt;&gt;how I have lost it *twice* in your metaphor -- let alone
&gt;&gt;once -- is unclear.

&gt; Apparently so.

&gt;&gt;&gt;So you've read some books about what others say.
&gt;&gt;&gt;And now you're ready to pull some beards.

&gt;&gt;Your beard is not nearly as full as you seem to imagine
&gt;&gt;it to be.

&gt;&gt;&gt;What have you got for yourself?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Speak up.

&gt;&gt;I already did.  You disappointed me... that's what

Keynes is masquerading under the delusion that being argumentative and
sneaky makes him an asset to civil society. He's a bararian king swinging an
axe with a skinful of ale, mere entertainment for common folk.

Developing correctness, or the centre, strikes me as being where life and
enthusiasm lives. Ravers mistake battle and foolmongery for creativity and
wellbeing. Why have cotton when you can have silk, eh?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The American culture in general is as opposite to the

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;true that the Daoist ideal can never exist in social
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;reality, but only in isolated individuals, and even then
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;only sporadically, because such individuals still have
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to live in society (unless they retire to caves) and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;living in society exacts its tolls, in the line of bending
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;to social manners, which generally are not Daoist.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Even in China, Daoism is known as world-exiting,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;as against Confucianism, which is known as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;world-entering. Daoism is a &quot;higher critique&quot; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;society, which takes society as existing (the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;establishment) and tries to critique it to bring about
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;a &quot;better&quot; life. What society takes to be good (and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;good because necessary for its functioning), like
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;conformism, knowledge, learning, distinction,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;hierarchy, meritocracy, etc., Daoism takes to be bad
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;(and bad because it leads people to compete and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;excel, and therefore to results thereof, like stress,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;anxiety, ulcers, etc.). Generally, what is good for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;society can be not good to individuals, and Daoism
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;takes this insight and develops it. Certainly the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Scripture on the Way and Virtue tries to apply
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Daoism to politics, but politics is where Daoism has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;almost totally failed to make any impact. Where
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Daoism has made an impact is on individuals, and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;more precisely on individuals who are &quot;on the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;margin&quot; of society, because they have got to have a
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;critical eye for the ills that are unavoidable
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;by-products of society, like stress, anxiety, ulcers, etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Even mere conformism can lead to routine as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;contrasted with spontaneity, and routine, pushed
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;further and further, becomes a plaster-cast that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;scarcely fosters growth and freedom.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The whole cast of ills that Daoism revolts against is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;glorified in the USA. Competition, distinction,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;meritocracy, hierachy, mass saturation of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;advertising (including political advertising),
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;self-promotion, consumption exacerbated by
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;advertising, a very intent attitude, etc. are the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;epitome of ills that Daoism inveighs against.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Certainly the high rate of use of tranquilizers says
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that something is wrong. I remember that when I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;first came to the USA, Chinese students told me that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;they were told to compete, accomplish and excel
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;(with the underlying assumption that if they didn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;they would be failures beyond redemption), but what
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;did the whole rat race lead to? Burnout (a word that
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;was scarcely heard back then) is now a prominent
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;social phenomenon. They were inchoately retracing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the steps of Daoists. (Even in China, Daoism has
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;never been popular, and with expatriate Chinese,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;only rebels and misfits have taken a shine to it --
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;remember that the Buddha said that his teaching
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;goes against the stream, in modern terms that it is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;counterintuitive).

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The American culture glorifies particularisation, as
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;in self-promotion, whereas Daoism counsels the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;contrary, not withdrawing into a homogeneous blank,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;but an attenuation of the boundaries and edges and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;a return to the whole -- not the social whole, but the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;natural whole, before human artifice, and beyond
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;that, to what is above nature, the Way (Dao) or grace
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;or whatever. The norms and standards of society are
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;criticised for their enslaving effects, and an opening is
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;made to what is outside of norms and standards
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;altogether, first by a return to nature before human
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;artifice, and then by going outside and beyond nature
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;altogether into supernature, the realm of mystery or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;grace, what cannot be fathomed by the social
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;imagination.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;What happens out there in society is often mirrored
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;inside its denizens, and in a fragmented, contentious,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;unglued society imbued with cut-throat competition,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;the dwellers tend to introject such an attitude. There
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;are always people who know how to retain balance
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and perspective, measure and proportion, detachment
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;and equanimity, but they tend to be a small minority.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The majority merely absorb the prevailing social
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;atmosphere, and then take pills or develop ulcers or
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;heart attacks.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Tang Huyen

&gt; &gt;&gt; Daoism offers worlds of wisdom.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The 'sage' (holy man) who has dropped
&gt; &gt;&gt; body and mind is called 'immortal'.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The Tai Chi symbol we all know is a teaching device.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Within the unity (Tao) of the circle are the equal black
&gt; &gt;&gt; and white curving sections signifying the positive and
&gt; &gt;&gt; negative yang and yin.  At the heart of each is a dot of
&gt; &gt;&gt; the other.  Each revolves and resolves into it's opposite.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Within any event there is an upside and a downside.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Calamities are the best of opportunities once the field
&gt; &gt;&gt; has been cleared of the difficulties associated with
&gt; &gt;&gt; and leading up to the disaster.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It's human nature to see gain and loss in events, but it
&gt; &gt;&gt; isn't really in the events, but in our judgements of them.
&gt; &gt;&gt; After the game, half the spectators have seen good and
&gt; &gt;&gt; half have seen bad, even though everyone actually saw
&gt; &gt;&gt; the very same thing.

&gt; &gt;&gt; It doesn't take very much wisdom to see the positive
&gt; &gt;&gt; in presumably negative situations.  That much would
&gt; &gt;&gt; relieve many of their troubles.  Even better is to see
&gt; &gt;&gt; both the light and the dark of it and make no personal
&gt; &gt;&gt; judgement about it.  Free of the confines of emotional
&gt; &gt;&gt; opinions, not even gravity can hold one down.- Hide quoted text -

&gt; &gt;The circle with the curving blk. &amp; white. Is the symbole of Yin &amp;
&gt; &gt;Yang,male &amp; female principles,of Balance.Positive &amp; negative,We all
&gt; &gt;need to be that balanced.But this world is full of frustrations,&amp;
&gt; &gt;noise, all kinds.It is hard to find peace.

&gt; The frustrations are not in the world, they are in your mind.
&gt; When you want 'this' but get 'that', then there is the pain of
&gt; the frustration of your wanting.  The world is alright all
&gt; by itself.

&gt; Have you read the Tao Te Ching?
&gt; The Chuang Tsu is also very good.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Daoism to politics, but politics is where Daoism has
&gt; &gt;&gt;almost totally failed to make any impact. Where
&gt; &gt;&gt;Daoism has made an impact is on individuals, and
&gt; &gt;&gt;more precisely on individuals who are &quot;on the
&gt; &gt;&gt;margin&quot; of society, because they have got to have a
&gt; &gt;&gt;critical eye for the ills that are unavoidable
&gt; &gt;&gt;by-products of society, like stress, anxiety, ulcers, etc.
&gt; &gt;&gt;Even mere conformism can lead to routine as
&gt; &gt;&gt;contrasted with spontaneity, and routine, pushed
&gt; &gt;&gt;further and further, becomes a plaster-cast that
&gt; &gt;&gt;scarcely fosters growth and freedom.

&gt; &gt;&gt;The whole cast of ills that Daoism revolts against is
&gt; &gt;&gt;glorified in the USA. Competition, distinction,
&gt; &gt;&gt;meritocracy, hierachy, mass saturation of
&gt; &gt;&gt;advertising (including political advertising),
&gt; &gt;&gt;self-promotion, consumption exacerbated by
&gt; &gt;&gt;advertising, a very intent attitude, etc. are the
&gt; &gt;&gt;epitome of ills that Daoism inveighs against.
&gt; &gt;&gt;Certainly the high rate of use of tranquilizers says
&gt; &gt;&gt;that something is wrong. I remember that when I
&gt; &gt;&gt;first came to the USA, Chinese students told me that
&gt; &gt;&gt;they were told to compete, accomplish and excel
&gt; &gt;&gt;(with the underlying assumption that if they didn't
&gt; &gt;&gt;they would be failures beyond redemption), but what
&gt; &gt;&gt;did the whole rat race lead to? Burnout (a word that
&gt; &gt;&gt;was scarcely heard back then) is now a prominent
&gt; &gt;&gt;social phenomenon. They were inchoately retracing
&gt; &gt;&gt;the steps of Daoists. (Even in China, Daoism has
&gt; &gt;&gt;never been popular, and with expatriate Chinese,
&gt; &gt;&gt;only rebels and misfits have taken a shine to it --
&gt; &gt;&gt;remember that the Buddha said that his teaching
&gt; &gt;&gt;goes against the stream, in modern terms that it is
&gt; &gt;&gt;counterintuitive).

&gt; &gt;&gt;The American culture glorifies particularisation, as
&gt; &gt;&gt;in self-promotion, whereas Daoism counsels the
&gt; &gt;&gt;contrary, not withdrawing into a homogeneous blank,
&gt; &gt;&gt;but an attenuation of the boundaries and edges and
&gt; &gt;&gt;a return to the whole -- not the social whole, but the
&gt; &gt;&gt;natural whole, before human artifice, and beyond
&gt; &gt;&gt;that, to what is above nature, the Way (Dao) or grace
&gt; &gt;&gt;or whatever. The norms and standards of society are
&gt; &gt;&gt;criticised for their enslaving effects, and an opening is
&gt; &gt;&gt;made to what is outside of norms and standards
&gt; &gt;&gt;altogether, first by a return to nature before human
&gt; &gt;&gt;artifice, and then by going outside and beyond nature
&gt; &gt;&gt;altogether into supernature, the realm of mystery or
&gt; &gt;&gt;grace, what cannot be fathomed by the social
&gt; &gt;&gt;imagination.

&gt; &gt;&gt;What happens out there in society is often mirrored
&gt; &gt;&gt;inside its denizens, and in a fragmented, contentious,
&gt; &gt;&gt;unglued society imbued with cut-throat competition,
&gt; &gt;&gt;the dwellers tend to introject such an attitude. There
&gt; &gt;&gt;are always people who know how to retain balance
&gt; &gt;&gt;and perspective, measure and proportion, detachment
&gt; &gt;&gt;and equanimity, but they tend to be a small minority.
&gt; &gt;&gt;The majority merely absorb the prevailing social
&gt; &gt;&gt;atmosphere, and then take pills or develop ulcers or
&gt; &gt;&gt;heart attacks.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Tang Huyen

&gt; &gt; Daoism offers worlds of wisdom.
&gt; &gt; The 'sage' (holy man) who has dropped
&gt; &gt; body and mind is called 'immortal'.

&gt; &gt; The Tai Chi symbol we all know is a teaching device.
&gt; &gt; Within the unity (Tao) of the circle are the equal black
&gt; &gt; and white curving sections signifying the positive and
&gt; &gt; negative yang and yin.  At the heart of each is a dot of
&gt; &gt; the other.  Each revolves and resolves into it's opposite.

&gt; &gt; Within any event there is an upside and a downside.
&gt; &gt; Calamities are the best of opportunities once the field
&gt; &gt; has been cleared of the difficulties associated with
&gt; &gt; and leading up to the disaster.

&gt; &gt; It's human nature to see gain and loss in events, but it
&gt; &gt; isn't really in the events, but in our judgements of them.
&gt; &gt; After the game, half the spectators have seen good and
&gt; &gt; half have seen bad, even though everyone actually saw
&gt; &gt; the very same thing.

&gt; &gt; It doesn't take very much wisdom to see the positive
&gt; &gt; in presumably negative situations.  That much would
&gt; &gt; relieve many of their troubles.  Even better is to see
&gt; &gt; both the light and the dark of it and make no personal
&gt; &gt; judgement about it.  Free of the confines of emotional
&gt; &gt; opinions, not even gravity can hold one down.

&gt; Neither you nor Tang seem to really have much of a clue
&gt; about Taoism.

&gt; Not to appear to &quot;contend&quot; or anything. ;-)

&gt; What does the circle around the Yin-Yang symbol represent?
&gt; (That's merely a rhetorical question here.)

&gt; As far as Zen goes,

&gt;     A Zen person is not bound by the way of the valley, but
&gt;     he or she is free to make use of it.

&gt;     A Zen person is not bound by the way of the mountain,
&gt;     but he or she is free to make use of it.

&gt; A Rinzai person might say, &quot;kill that, too.&quot;  But the larger
&gt; picture involves skillful means, vehicles, freedom of
&gt; religion, and so forth.

&gt; And kill that, too.  But only as a discrimination in one's
&gt; own mind.  To fully come up to the level of the Zen
&gt; teachings one must be able to make skillful use of
&gt; discriminations, without losing sight of the seamless whole:
&gt; outside of all discrimination.  Gaining that &quot;sight&quot; in the
&gt; first place is the focus of most beginning-Zen training
&gt; practices (jorikis notwithstanding).  The practice
&gt; *continues* beyond that.  Koans which tend to be used in
&gt; later-stage training are called &quot;nanto koans.&quot;

&gt; Having uttered these words, I now must retract them.  ;-)

your mt. &amp; valley paths for a Zen person.I don`t think I have read
that any where.Where did
you get it, if you don`t mind me asking.I only know the one hand
clapping,I am too
ignorant to write koans.It only takes one hand to clap?I like haiku,my
spelling of these eastern words is not great.I have written some
haiku, one or 2 is OK.The hardest part is using the set of sillybals

is supposed to make a lot of mystical sense?

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Even in China, Daoism is known as world-exiting,

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;world-entering. Daoism is a &quot;higher critique&quot; of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;society, which takes society as existing (the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;establishment) and tries to critique it to bring about
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;a &quot;better&quot; life. What society takes to be good (and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;good because necessary for its functioning), like
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;conformism, knowledge, learning, distinction,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;hierarchy, meritocracy, etc., Daoism takes to be bad
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;(and bad because it leads people to compete and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;excel, and therefore to results thereof, like stress,
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;anxiety, ulcers, etc.). Generally, what is good for
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;society can be not good to individuals, and Daoism

Who's Tang and why does he have such a funny name?

The Dao, as I understand it, is an underlying &quot;opinion&quot; of the &quot;why&quot; of the
un-understandable.  It unexplains emptiness.  Good for the Dao, now what can
I not do with it?

The Confucius stuff explains practical matters.  As opposed to the Dao, we
can use it to make conscious decisions.  Daoist stuff doesn't but it might
help to shift a sentiment to a less harmful state - could go the other way,
I suppose.

We could have a general question of &quot;why do bad things happen to good
people?&quot; and approach it with Confucius thinking.  In which case, we
wouldn't answer the question but rather design thought frameworks to help
try and avoid bad things happening to good people.  Daoist approach would
not answer the question either, but a person with a developed &quot;chi&quot; or
something, would not be swayed to anxiety.

From a less anxious state, a person could better work within the framework
of thoughts.  They are able to hold the factors with balance and
perspective.  Both good and bad are there in the thought framework but there
is less fighting/fleeing the bad and less clinging to the good.

Good thought frameworks are good for making good decisions.  Bad thought
frameworks are bad for making bad decisions.  Making good thought frameworks
doesn't require any Daoist understanding; one just needs to have a belief
structure that harmonizes with the environment.  We do this with normal
disciplinary training right from the point where we start developing our
egos.  As long as the belief structure harmonizes with the environment, the
decisions made will be good.

As things change the belief structure becomes more sophisticated and
burdensome.  Normal modes of thought based on the ego become unstable.
Enter the gods and superstions who shore up some of the more tenuous
structures.  Even still, though, they eventually clash with their
environment and go from being good decision making systems to disastorous
ones.  Bad things start happening to good people.

Daoism, with its acceptance of yin and yang, subverts burdensome belief
structures.  It fits well with any belief structure, such as Confuciunism,
that accepts the belief structure for its own purpose.
