We had a great time, no major injuries except maybe to one guy's ego,
but he'll get over that...

After being gone for 11 days I'm stilll wading through the pile of

Looking forward to the RR. I'm really bummed that I couldn't make this
one. We're trying to conserve cash with the big Intel layoffs were
facing. Lotsa fun, no injuries, sounds good. Was it dust free too.

When going to Baum for camping, I prefer to go up on Wednesday in an
attempt to miss the previous weekend's late stayers and beat the other
early arrivers. It worked...

I arrived to a mostly empty camping area, only a couple of other
campers visible. I took a quick peek from the road into the area now
known as the &quot;Harrell Compound&quot;. It was available so I pulled in and
parked the trailer in my preferred spot about 20' from the river in
the shade of several large Ponderosa pines. This camping spot is kind
of a secluded, dead end cul-de-sac, not large, but enough for the
small contingent I was expecting.

I took a quick fishing break between setting up the trailer and
unloading the bikes, caught a few, one of size the rest small.

Thursday, still alone, it rained lightly off and on until mid
afternoon. I was really hoping for some substantial precip, but the
dust just laughed at this measly amount of moisture. Of course the
wind picked up after the rain stopped and within an hour or so there
was little evidence of the morning's showers, at least where I was.
Later that day, the river by camp suddenly went milky greenish-white,
later it went brown. Evidently, somewhere up the drainage, there had
been a stubstantial amount of precip, enough to make my crystal clear
river murky. It was about 24 hrs until the water returned to normal.

I had invited a couple of non-RMD friends from SLC (UT) to come up and
experience Idaho riding. I've known both these guys since the mid 70s
when I worked at one of the ski resorts outside SLC. Steve also worked
in the ski school; Ed ran a snow cat and various heavy machinery.

Both Ed and Steve were also dirt bikers. Ed had flown sailplanes at
some point in the past, I got him interested in hang gliding and
ultralight flying after I took up the sport(s). Ed's always been
naturally good at physical activities, I think this trip was a huge
blow to his ego, he thought he was a pretty good dirt biker...

Ed arrived on Friday as did Joe Dowd. Joe wanted to ride Big Smoky on
Saturday to video the trail. While I love that trail, I thought it a
good idea to take Ed out for an evaluation ride on some less demanding
terrain (40 miles).

Ed is riding a 95 XR250, old tires, no handguards, no skid plate,
heavy hiking boots, one piece cotton jump suit, jeans and a sweat
shirt, small pack with water bottles. He does have a decent helmet,
goggles and gloves, woohooo...

Up Kelly Creek, down Bremner to the SFk Lime Cr., up Roanhide to a
&quot;secret&quot; cutoff to the MFk Lime Cr. Ed was huffing and puffing by the
time we topped out on Kelly, a fairly easy, ATV width trail, about 8
miles long. He shed his sweatshirt, leaving it hanging in a tree,
never to be seen by him again.

Bremner is also what I'd call an easy trail, the SFk gets a bit more
technical but still what I'd rate as intermediate. The riding starts
to get serious on the cutoff trail, steep, loose switchbacks right off
the bat leading to a long, narrow, open, exposed sidehill trail
through light brush. The MFk Lime isn't particularly difficult as
trails go around here, but it does offer some narrow sidehills and
plenty of rocks.

I was in the lead, then Ed with Joe in back. I get to the top of the
first climb on the cutoff, wait for Ed and Joe, then head out across
the long open section. I peek back at Ed early on, he seems to be
doing OK so I ride to the top of this climb. No Ed or Joe behind me
anymore. I look out across the hill and see what I think is a bike way
back near the start. I strain to see if there is any movement but from
this distance I can't tell. I have a smoke to give them a minute, but
no movement, so I ride back. I get there, Joe is kicking Ed's XR, Ed
sitting next to the trail looking pretty spent, sweat dripping off his
face. It's hot and no shade in sight. Ed slipped off the trail and
wasted himself getting the bike upright and trying to start it. I'll
let Joe fill in the details. Joe got the XR going and off we went.
After the ride, Ed's sore from head to toe and comments that it was
the toughest ride he's ever been on, uh-oh, it's just day one and that
was the easy ride.

Ed and I have always been a bit competitive with each other so I took
some small measure of pride that I whupped him on this ride, but feel
genuine sorrow for him. I'd really rather we be on more equal footing,
there's so much to see and trails to ride and I'm afraid I won't be
able to share all of it with my old buddy.

Steve and his wife Carolyn arrive Saturday afternoon. Murray and my
wife Karen Sunday morning. Al Youngwerth also arrives Sunday (for the
day only). Murray, Al and I want to spread Chris Johnson's ashes on an
appropriate trail.

I sugggest we do the same ride as I'd done Saturday with Ed and Joe so
Steve can get an idea on terrain.

We spread the ashes on and near the big rock at the top of MFk Lime,
the same rock featured on the ISF06 tee-shirts.
http://chrisraffle.com/alb_sport/photos/photo20.html

I put some on the top of the rock, some at the base and then flick the
remainder into the wind. Ironically, my last act with Chris' earthly
remains brings us closer together, literally. As I cast the ashes into
the wind from the rather unceremonious ziplock baggie, I muff it and
it all blows back into my face, eyes, mouth and clothes, you get the
idea. Chris, you taste rather strange...&lt;G&gt;

Steve, on his 98 XR400, made the ride okay, but commented somewhere in
the middle that he was whupped and felt like &quot;a little girl&quot;. Ed
started off with us but left the group at the top of Kelly, deciding
to ride solo to the Iron Mtn. Lookout then back to camp instead.

Karen and Steve's wife Carolyn did a 60+ mile dirt road ride, Karen on
her XT225, Carolyn on her XR200.

Dennis Kennedy and Doug Landau arrive on Monday.

Next:

Tues: Skeleton, SFk Ross, Horse Trail, Bear Cr Mine road and back down
Skeleton with Murray wearing Joe's helmet cam the whole day. (62
miles)

Thurs: Paradise, Snowslide, WFk Smoky, Emma, Jones Creek and Conant
Creek. (67 miles)

Saturday: Short ride up Skeleton to the mine then down Little Water.
(30 miles)

The bear sightings, the hummingbirds, chipmunks, the nightly fox
visits and working on Doug's &quot;new to him&quot; 97 KTM250...

I'll give you my view of Tuesday.
Skeleton, SFk Ross, Horse Trail, Bear Cr Mine road and back down
Skeleton with Murray wearing Joe's helmet cam the whole day. (62
miles)
Riders:  David Jones, Murray, Ed, Doug Landau, Me, and Joe Dowd

This was a first ride for me in months and though I didn't know it at
the time, I wasn't really ready for it.  I rejetted my bike that
morning at camp, put the carb back together and tried to start the
bike.  It wouldn't start.  That's odd, because I usually have no
trouble starting it all.  Joe was supervising and noticed fuel pouring
out of the vent hose.  The float must have gotten stuck somehow when I
was reassembling the carb.  I loosened the bowl, jiggled it around,
and pushed it back into place.  Gas on, and no leaks.  Good!  Got the
screws in and dressed for the ride.
Skeleton Creek is about 5 miles down the road from camp.  We got
there, and Joe had already signed us in.  Then we noticed Doug's
carburetor leaking out the vent hose.  We figured he had the same
problem I had, but, on his bike ('97 KTM 250) he couldn't get at the
bowl screws without removing his tank and twisting the carburetor
sideways.  He headed back to camp to work on it and do some short
rides close to camp.
On up Skeleton Creek.  David and Murray, then Ed, me, then Joe.  It
isn't a difficult trail, but it's more difficult than I should have
been riding for a first ride.  There's some narrow sidehill, several
creek crossings, and some pretty rocky sections up at the top.  Not
far up the trail, I managed to catch my handlebars on a log, which
sent the front wheel down the side hill.  Joe was behind me and quite
amused, but he did give me a hand getting it back up on the trail.
Little did I know, this was just the beginning of a difficult day for
me.  A little farther up, we found the group.  Apparently, Ed had bent
his shifter.  David and Murray had the tools out and got it bent back
into a position that looked workable.  On farther up the trail, I
found Ed by the side of the trail.  He waved me on, so I went on to
inform David and Murray that he might be in trouble.  I found them,
and we waited for Joe to catch up and report.  Joe reported that, Ed
had really taco'd his shifter this time and chose to turn back.
On up to the top, with no major mishaps, but I may have a few minor
drops.  There were so many drops that day that they all just run
together.
At the top, again, David and Murray were waiting, helmets off, and
cigarettes lit.  Joe chose to bring up the rear, but he may have been
regretting this decision by now.
The trail down the other side, South Fork Ross, I think, was a steep
downhill with several loose switchbacks.  Joe watched me struggle with
this as going up Skeleton had taken a lot of me at that point.  On
down towards the bottom, a large log was laying across the trail.
Murray and David took the short way around which involved hopping over
some smaller logs, while Joe and I took a longer way, which didn't
involve any logs, but caught me on some branches.
We stopped for lunch at two old log cabins.  One of them had been kept
up until a decade or two ago, while the other one had fallen in on
itself.
Then we did a little road riding and crossed a fork of the Boise
river.  The ride down Horse Trail was really nice.  No real obstacles,
but just very nice twisty single track along the edge of the river.
This went on for several miles.
We came off of this onto Bear Creek Mine Road.  Again, this was easy
riding back up the hill.  I was doing my best to ride a little faster
and keep up with David and Murray.  I was doing great until my front
wheel hit a rock while I wasn't paying enough attention.  This shot me
off of the road to my right into a slight sidehill full of boulders.
Miraculously, I managed to weave through them, scrubbing off speed,
until I came to a dead stop, which catapulted me forward, off of the
bike, head first into a boulder.  Thankfully, I have a hard head, and
of course, it was protected with a decent helmet.  I got up and felt
no injuries.  I picked my bike up, expecting to see a taco'd front
wheel, and couldn't find any damage.  I walked back down to the road
and inspected everything and only found that the cheap plastic Honda
odometer had come apart and wasn't going to work.  I felt pretty
lucky.  After that, I tried to ride more carefully, but was getting
pretty tired.  Shortly after that, we left the road and got back on a
single track trail.  The trail back up got into some more switchbacks,
but again, wasn't exceptionally hard.
Then, we rode back down Skeleton Creek.  By this time Joe had enough
of following me and went on ahead.  I was really tired by this point
and was having trouble keeping my bike on two wheels.  Not far from
the top, I got a little out of shape and dropped my bike in a very
easy section, only to see a pretty big fat dead chipmunk laying in the
middle of the trail.  He was freshly dead, so one of the riders in
front of me had gotten him.  Farther on down, there was a creek
crossing that hadn't been hard on the way up.  I took the old line and
stalled on some bigger rocks on the other side.  I dropped the bike
right on them.  Murray and Joe said they had heard some loud sounds of
metal hitting rock, but again, I couldn't find any apparent damage to
the bike.  Hopefully, it was just the skidplate.  The rest of the way
down was uneventful, but I was getting really tired.  I quite happy to
see the road and get back to camp.
More to come...

Wednesday
Kelly Creek, Bremner, S Fk Lime Creek, Coyote, Bremner, up to Iron
Mtn, back down Kelly Creek
Riders:  Doug Landau, and Me

Joe had left the day before and David and Murray were taking the day
off.  I needed an easier ride and Doug was game.

Up Kelley Creek.  This is a pretty fast (except for the boulder field)
ATV trail.  The trail had been worked on since last year and the
boulder field part of the trail is much better.  Last year a few of
us stalled or dropped our bikes in that section.  It's still rough,
but much more easily passable.  There are many water bars for catching
air and there was little traffic that day.
Bremner is another pretty easy trail, but not passable by an ATV.  It
winds down to the South Fork of Lime Creek.  About a third of the way
down, we ran into a large flock of sheep.  They wouldn't get out of
the trail.  Doug was leading and slowly rode forward.  The sheep
insisted on staying on the trail and moving the same direction we
were.  Then, seemingly out of nowhere, two white dogs started barking
furiously at us.  Doug started riding a little faster and the
sheep parted out of the trail.  We rode down to a creek crossing and
Doug noticed that his barely worn, but 10 year old, Alpinestars Tech
7s had started to disintegrate.  The soles were completely
delaminating.  Fortunately, he had a big roll of duct tape in his pack
and we were riding again.  We crossed the creek and the trail turned
into a fire road.  I had been here last year and knew this was wrong,
so we turned around.  We finally realized that we were supposed to
take a right before the creek crossing.  Not long after that we found
Lime Creek and had lunch.
Then we turned up Coyote.  This is slightly more challenging with some
narrow sidehill mixed in, but nothing like the sidehills were to
encounter the next day.  It winds around a while and runs back into
Bremner.  We had to go through the same flock of sheep and the dogs
were really unhappy this time.  They never attacked, but I was
wondering if I was going to lose a chunk of my calf.  There is one
steep loose section going up Bremner.  Doug stalled his bike near the
top and I paddled around him.  Then we were back up in the saddle
below iron mountain lookout.
We both had our cameras that day, so we decided to ride up for some
pictures.  This is a long ATV trail uphill.  I think goes from about
7,000' to almost 10,000' in just a few miles.  Doug's bike overheated
about 3/4ths of the way up, so we stopped for a few minutes to let it
cool down.
When we did get to the top, it turned out that the battery in my
camera was dead, so Doug took some pictures with his disposable.
The ride down was uneventful.  Kelly Creek is much more fun going down
than up, but you do have to be careful of on coming traffic.
Unfortunately, I got only one picture during this trip and it was just
Doug sitting on his bike.    Hopefully Doug will scan what he got with
his disposables.
Thursday, the riding got easier for me, but more on that later.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I had invited a couple of non-RMD friends from SLC (UT) to come up and
&gt; experience Idaho riding. I've known both these guys since the mid 70s
&gt; when I worked at one of the ski resorts outside SLC. Steve also worked
&gt; in the ski school; Ed ran a snow cat and various heavy machinery.

&gt; Both Ed and Steve were also dirt bikers. Ed had flown sailplanes at
&gt; some point in the past, I got him interested in hang gliding and
&gt; ultralight flying after I took up the sport(s). Ed's always been
&gt; naturally good at physical activities, I think this trip was a huge
&gt; blow to his ego, he thought he was a pretty good dirt biker...

&gt; Ed arrived on Friday as did Joe Dowd. Joe wanted to ride Big Smoky on
&gt; Saturday to video the trail. While I love that trail, I thought it a
&gt; good idea to take Ed out for an evaluation ride on some less demanding
&gt; terrain (40 miles).

&gt; Ed is riding a 95 XR250, old tires, no handguards, no skid plate,
&gt; heavy hiking boots, one piece cotton jump suit, jeans and a sweat
&gt; shirt, small pack with water bottles. He does have a decent helmet,
&gt; goggles and gloves, woohooo...

&gt; Up Kelly Creek,
&gt; Ed was huffing and puffing by the
&gt; time we topped out on Kelly, a fairly easy, ATV width trail, about 8
&gt; miles long.
">

I can see why with the endless Kelly humps:

http://www.the-dowds.com/Vids/temp/07-08-13 _RMD_Post/Kelly.wmv

(The video is a SMALL sample of the humps but I think it shows most of
the creek crossings).

Very nice trail, I was hooking along pretty well and Ed was right
behind me at the end:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The riding starts
&gt; to get serious on the cutoff trail, steep, loose switchbacks right off
&gt; the bat leading to a long, narrow, open, exposed sidehill trail
&gt; through light brush. The MFk Lime isn't particularly difficult as
&gt; trails go around here, but it does offer some narrow sidehills and
&gt; plenty of rocks.

&gt; I was in the lead, then Ed with Joe in back. I get to the top of the
&gt; first climb on the cutoff, wait for Ed and Joe, then head out across
&gt; the long open section. I peek back at Ed early on, he seems to be
&gt; doing OK so I ride to the top of this climb. No Ed or Joe behind me
&gt; anymore. I look out across the hill and see what I think is a bike way
&gt; back near the start. I strain to see if there is any movement but from
&gt; this distance I can't tell. I have a smoke to give them a minute,

According to my GPS track, we were there from 10:56 to 11:22 (PDT I

&gt; no movement, so I ride back. I get there, Joe is kicking Ed's XR, Ed

&gt; face. It's hot and no shade in sight. Ed slipped off the trail and
&gt; wasted himself getting the bike upright and trying to start it. I'll
&gt; let Joe fill in the details. Joe got the XR going and off we went.
&gt; After the ride, Ed's sore from head to toe and comments that it was
&gt; the toughest ride he's ever been on, uh-oh, it's just day one and that
&gt; was the easy ride.

I have to admit that ride whipped me pretty good - mostly, I think,
because I pushed too hard down Bremmer and then fighting Ed's XR in
the heat did me in.  Remember our last stop where it rained a bit then
the hill afterwards:

Something is screwy in the url's that point to the video. Note the
&quot;space&quot; between &quot;07-08-13&quot; and &quot;_RMD_POST&quot;

When I try to click on the link it stops at the space, if I highlight
and click the entire url it translates the space as &quot;%20&quot; and really
screws up the url.

I'm having to copy and paste the url, strip out the %20 in the middle,
then the videos can be found.

All the url's in your ride report are munged like this.

The hummingbirds provided the entertainment for the week, and
entertaining they were.

For the last few years we've been putting out a feeder in camp. This
was the first time we've had so many birds visit. It was difficult to
count them while hovering and darting around, but I'd guess we had
16+.

Sometimes they would get along and share the 4 &quot;flowers&quot; on the
feeder. Other times the dominant males would fight and bicker to no
end. Even when I'd take the feeder down for replenishment, they would
still defend the string I used the hang the feeder. Sometimes they
wouldn't even let me hang the feeder up before thet hit it. Here I am
about to tie the feeder back on the awning support:

http://www.spodefest.net/rmd/images/2007/hbird2.jpg

Late in the week, there was one very weak bird fluttering around,
barely able to maintain flight. It landed on the ground near the
trailer. Doug attempted to feed it some soda or gatorade from a bottle
cap, but it wouldn't take it. I refilled the feeder and managed to get
the bird on my finger. It tried to land on the chrome mirror post on
the DR400, but it was too slick for his little feet. After a few
minutes of hand feeding it was able to zip away, with some semblance
of normal flight. We came to be able to recognize it when it hit the
feeder. Quite tame compared to the rest of them. I was able to get it
back on my finger a couple of times.

http://www.spodefest.net/rmd/images/2007/hbird1.jpg

And don't forget the Quasimoto Chipmunks, a couple of slightly
deformed dudes or dudettes. I bring sunflower seeds for the small
rodents in camp:

http://www.spodefest.net/rmd/images/2007/chipmunk.jpg

No photos, but we had a fox cruising the camp nightly. It didn't seem
worried about us sitting there on the porch yacking it up as he/she
was only about 15' away.

Lots of bear sightings also. One day, Karen was off on a solo ride up
a dirt road (Marsh Creek). She saw two within a few minutes, one only
about 20' away from her as she rounded a blind curve. This one freaked
her out a bit...

Doug saw two, I think somewhere on or near Kelly Cr. Then as we were
on our way up the road to Big Smoky, we saw one on the road and were
able to watch it scurry up the open hillside above us. It would
scamper up a ways the turn to look at us. Most times the bears quickly
disappear into the woods, only showing us a view of their rear end for
a few seconds. Plenty of bear crap on the roads and trails, it's berry
season in the woods.

All in all I think they improved Kelly quite a bit, but the water bars

&gt;Very nice trail, I was hooking along pretty well and Ed was right

Ed's a pretty good rider, I just don't think he was prepared for the

&gt;&gt; The riding starts
&gt;&gt; to get serious on the cutoff trail, steep, loose switchbacks right off
&gt;&gt; the bat leading to a long, narrow, open, exposed sidehill trail
&gt;&gt; through light brush. The MFk Lime isn't particularly difficult as
&gt;&gt; trails go around here, but it does offer some narrow sidehills and
&gt;&gt; plenty of rocks.

&gt;&gt; I was in the lead, then Ed with Joe in back. I get to the top of the
&gt;&gt; first climb on the cutoff, wait for Ed and Joe, then head out across
&gt;&gt; the long open section. I peek back at Ed early on, he seems to be
&gt;&gt; doing OK so I ride to the top of this climb. No Ed or Joe behind me
&gt;&gt; anymore. I look out across the hill and see what I think is a bike way
&gt;&gt; back near the start. I strain to see if there is any movement but from
&gt;&gt; this distance I can't tell. I have a smoke to give them a minute,

My old RM is sorta the opposite... the pegs are high enough to
clear a surprising amount of obstacles, but so high that you feel
somewhat cramped and more effort is required to transition from
sitting to standing. Obviously the ideal solution would be taller seat
foam then, but I'm not fond of that idea either. Ho-hum...

I have problems with the right handers too.  And, oh yeah, the

Ed was dressed for wintertime.  Doesn't he know that coveralls are one
of the hottest things to wear on the trail.  They are okay for dual
sport, but for singletrack?  NOT!

Leather gloves, work boots and helmet.  Not much all around protective
gear.  I fall too much, or at least I fall too hard, to dress like
that.

Ed looked tired when you got there , Joe.  Shame on you.  &lt;VBG&gt;

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; face. It's hot and no shade in sight. Ed slipped off the trail and
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; wasted himself getting the bike upright and trying to start it. I'll
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; let Joe fill in the details. Joe got the XR going and off we went.
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; After the ride, Ed's sore from head to toe and comments that it was
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the toughest ride he's ever been on, uh-oh, it's just day one and that
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; was the easy ride.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I have to admit that ride whipped me pretty good - mostly, I think,
&gt; &gt;&gt;because I pushed too hard down Bremmer and then fighting Ed's XR in
&gt; &gt;&gt;the heat did me in.  Remember our last stop where it rained a bit
&gt; &gt;&gt;then
&gt; &gt;&gt;the hill afterwards:

&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.the-dowds.com/Vids/temp/07-08-13_RMD_Post/Hill.wmv

&gt; &gt;Like someone else said, &quot;poor Ed...&quot;
&gt; ****************************************************

&gt; Ed was dressed for wintertime.  Doesn't he know that coveralls are one
&gt; of the hottest things to wear on the trail.  They are okay for dual
&gt; sport, but for singletrack?  NOT!

&gt; Leather gloves, work boots and helmet.  Not much all around protective
&gt; gear.  I fall too much, or at least I fall too hard, to dress like
&gt; that.

&gt; Ed looked tired when you got there , Joe.  Shame on you.  &lt;VBG&gt;

&gt; I love two strokes.  I bought another spare bike just this week.

Hey Jim,  I've got extra room in the garage if you need a place to park the
*new* fart fart in the event that scrape's bike resort is all full up. I
might even take it out once or twice a week in order to keep everything
properly lubed! :-)

&gt;&gt;&gt;Totally understandable on not raising the seat height as I did notice on
&gt;&gt;&gt;some of the steeper sidehill at Brushy Mtn, that you seemed to suffer a

&gt;&gt;   What? I don't remember being intimidated by anything other than
&gt;&gt;those sharp-ass 180-degree right switchbacks with the big drops in the
&gt;&gt;middle. Is that what you're referring to? The heights didn't scare me,
&gt;&gt;just the possibility of cartwheeling to the bottom with an RM-250
&gt;&gt;chasing my ass. As tricky right-handers aren't my specialty, I figured
&gt;&gt;a little caution was prudent. Hope I didn't slow you up too much
&gt;&gt;(cocksmoker!)? ;-p

&gt;I have problems with the right handers too.  And, oh yeah, the
&gt;left handers.  I've always found that when a situation arises
&gt;where I'm racing my bike down a hill solo, I always win though.
&gt;Usually meaning I get to climb back up to retreive the fucker.

&gt;----
&gt;Go fast and aim for where the trees aren't.

***********************************************
I'm going back to Brushy as soon as I can talk someone into
traveling with me. Gabe will go, but i will have to take at least one
day off and do white water with him while we are there.   I'm working
on RahRah pretty hard already.

Don't you all worry one bit.  After a day (or two) with Uncle Jim
in the Ouachita Mtns, I'll have you all singing the praises of wooded
side hill trail and single track heaven.

Just have better tires than RahRah had on his EC300.

Fred, I'll have you a loaner with me, and may even put my clutch
back on my bike before then.
I'll  even set up some more &quot;limited&quot; trails for the younger boys to
get used to and ride  while we go play on the north side for a while.

&gt;How did you got the chipmunks to get close? I tryed everyday to get a

&gt;ran away everytime, I got a somewhat decent picture, but I had to
&gt;cheat (camera with zoom).

&gt;re: hummingbirds, if you can, don't put sugar on the water, is not
&gt;good for them, try honey... They are nice creatures, a nice shiny

I think that tree is a relative of our local bois'darc tree.  This

And if someone tries to get you to cut down a bois d'arc tree
(bodark), buy extra chains and work on yer endurance beforehand.
I'd suggest 6' lengths that you then use for fence posts, since the
damn stuff is nearly impervious to rot (and since you don't wanna cut
it any more than you have to).

Sounds like what they sell at the lumber yard as Ipe, a.k.a. Pau Lope. It is
popular for high end decks. Very hard on edge tools, very dense and heavy. I
built a mortise and tennon Pergola out of the stuff maybe a decade ago -
sixteen foot long 2x12s - man those timbers were heavy for a one man job.
And it sure did eat drill bits and router bits for breakfast.

Never tried to saw or drill it... Are you nuts? :-) it is a capital
crime to harm one of these trees, we owe the country name to them!

Seriously though, I had to cut a branch once, with a hand saw... It is
hard! sci name is caesapina echinata, pretty full of thorns indeed,
red wood, beautiful, but I do believe it is not legal for any use that
is not providing shadow and bird nest support...

I think it is hard enough that one could make edge tools out of it. I know I
laid a few knuckles open just bumping into a fresh cut the wrong way.

I think there are some ethical issues with using the wood. It has replaced
our redwood in a lot of projects. I tell customers this by telling them it
is &quot;rainforest wood&quot; even though I don't really know that for sure.
I wouldn't mind if I never worked with it again.

It's definitely &quot;South Arkansas rain forest wood&quot;..  We have a lot of
them growing here, around Smackover, in the sandy swampy ground.
