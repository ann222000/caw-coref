Wisdom of George Orwell (1903-1950)

Note: Some of these quotes are paraphrased

Early in life I had noticed that no event is ever correctly
reported in a newspaper.

During times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes
a revolutionary act.

If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to
tell people what they do not want to hear.

In our age there is no such thing as 'keeping out of
politics.' All issues are political issues, and politics
itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and
schizophrenia.

Liberal: a power worshipper without power.

Men can only be happy when they do not assume that the
object of life is happiness.

People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because
rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.

Patriotism is usually stronger than class hatred, and
always stronger than internationalism.

Political chaos is connected with the decay of language...
one can probably bring about some improvement by starting
at the verbal end.

The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the
world. Lies will pass into history.

There are some ideas so wrong that only a very intelligent
person could believe in them.

War against a foreign country only happens when the moneyed
classes think they are going to profit from it.

War is a way of shattering to pieces... materials which
might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable
and... too intelligent.

We may find in the long run that tinned food is a deadlier
weapon than the machine-gun.

Myths which are believed in tend to become true.

Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the
present controls the past.

The Most Effective Way to Destroy a people is to Deny and
Obliterate their own Understanding of their History.

George Orwell (1903-1950)
