Just rec'd the ppwk from United In Hell Until They Rot and I See It From
Heaven And Laugh Myself Assless saying congrats, the state decided in your
favor, so here is our ass....until 12/31/07.

I figure, okay, that's cuz the school district only has a year policy.
They'll re-up it when it comes time to get the med in January.

Yes, as you will ask, then i called them

They are only acknowledging the overturn until 12/31.  I cannot use the
state info for the year '08.  I have to go through the entire FUCKING
process again.  I scared one customer service rep away and ended up with a
supervisor who wanted to transfer me away, too.  I threatened her with legal
action.  No, i did not curse at any time....i know that's grounds for
terminating the call....i was a killer customer service rep for several
years.

she said they &quot;might&quot; want to use the state ppwk when they begin the appeals
process this time (which cannot begin until Jan 1) and &quot;maybe&quot; that will
circumvent the double denial, but since it's a &quot;label&quot; issue, she doubts it.

i was so happy.  i'd spoken with a rep this afternoon, before rec'g the &quot;we
bend over&quot; letter this afternoon.  she gave me a reference number and told
me that, yes, i can get the med right away...today if i wanted.  Called the
pharmacy, they can have it tomorrow.  Called the doc, need to call in the
a.m. and get into his day clinic cuz he's on-call.  It was all lining up so
i was going to post tomorrow and tell you i was posting with the sucker
firmly planted under my tongue or between my gum and cheek.

and they've sucked every ounce of joy and relief out of the situation.  am i
grateful for the med?  yes, of course.  but i was taking down my pants,
finally being given the tush, and once again, it's me getting screwed.

I think i have a case for cruelty, pain &amp; suffering if they don't allow the
med during the first appeal.   i expect them to deny it right off the bat in
January, as usual....that's a system thing....a computer automatic thing
that a person has to go in and change.  But if they pull an actual denial of
that request....Then i'm going to have to get ugly.

Had to KY myself for 9 months now....they'd better grease up, and i DARE
THEM to deny me in January past the initial thing.

F...no, i won't use that anymore.   I've got some praying to do....

Thanks for the ears, guys....Lavon

Sorry to hear this latest development Lavon. Enjoy the suckers for now,
pun intended, and resubmit the paperwork in January. I am sure the state
insurance board will be MUCH more firm when they realize they have
already told the insurance company one time already what they have to
do. They still have all your paperwork from this past time. The second
time will really piss them off.

Wow, Lavon...that;s too bad.
I know how you must feel-going through all of this, and aving this
roadblock pput i your way. Is there any way you could go to a
drugstore out-of-town?  I know that it'll be an inconvenience-but, it
seems that the meds are worth it. Use what you can now, and show
everyone how much better your lifestyle is now.  who knows? it may
work out!

My reply to what cllmd had to say:

You go girl!!!  Hopefully it won't be the whole 9 yards in January.
Hopefully rather than pay the expense of going through the entire process
they will use their heads and show some intelligence,( not to mention
compassion) and do the right thing from the get go.

Good Luck!  We are all in your corner.

Time to call your state contact back. Maybe they can help if this is
considered a failure to agree to the terms of the arbitration. Does
the letter from the state say that their decision was for a specified
period of time? It also might be worth another $200 to see what the
lawyer has to say.

This is what I have come to expect from PacifiCare/United Health. If
you are in N. CA. contact Call 3 for Action, a KCRA news feature that
has righted wrongs in the past. I don't think Pacificare/United Health
wants bad publicity.

If I am reading you accurately (there may be some doubt):

1.) You have a binding arbitration judgment from CA ins. board allowing you the Actiq.
2.) United Slimebags sez it's only valid 'till yearend.

It's -really- hard for me to imagine that CA would allow UHC to
force re-arbitration (or somesuch) of the issue. At worst, I'd
expect some garbage paperwork.

That's if (very serious IF) terms of your UHC policy remain static. They
-can- and -do- change 'em from time to time (watch carefully).

If I were you, I think maybe I'd worry that hubby's employer should
change healthcare providers, a very common practice now days.

My best guess is that Anthem healthcare (or whatever they call 'em
on the W. coast) would be even worse. UHC *used* to have a good rep.

Relax but watch carefully,

&gt; Trisha in MO, exhausted yet again

I'm going to answer the others, but i had to answer Trisha today cuz, you
nailed it.  Yesterday i had the worst puker i've had in a loooong time.
Praise God that it only lasted one day!  They usually last three.  Today i'm
just jelly, but need to play guitar this afternoon at a pastor's
installation (minister's version of a wedding...he weds the church,
basically.)

There were a zillion reasons for it, any one taken on its own would have
caused a puker.  I had the big up, the big down, then the re-settling.
Then, after talking with the insurance, the pharmacy and my dr's office, i
was able to get the suckers Friday...Sept 28th, which means i'll get my
refill between Cmas &amp; New Year's Eve, carrying January as we fight again.
I'm weaning down the Dilaudid and completely tossing the Vicodin (no, saving
it for emergencies) so there might be an element of withdrawal...that makes
sense, cuz i had a couple of bouts of diarrhea....unusual for my pukers.
And i was stupid enough to eat shrimp Friday night.  I know
better....shellfish and i no longer get along.

Yesterday, Saturday 29th, was our 17th anniversary.  I spent it puking,
hurting and sleeping.  chris has already taken Monday off due to Sunday
being nuts.  We'll &quot;celebrate&quot; then.

Mom called last night and asked, when i told her, what caused it.  She
started to rattle off much of what i stated above.  I told her to pick an
ingredient.

One more thing.   We rec'd a letter from the state on Friday.  It is vague,
on purpose surely, but it hints that we will be rec'g some type of
remuneration.  Dunno if this means lowered premiums for the rest of the
year, or what.  I'll be calling B. Love at the Dept of Insurance on Monday
to get a better idea of what the letter means.  I expect U. Hellscare to
fight it.  I was ready to just let it go, but chris told me to remember what
these last months have been like.  If i can get a trip to Disneyland outta
them, heck ya, i'm gonna try.

Also, chris gets a monthly rag from the Nat'l Educator's Assoc.  This month,
it discusses this exact issue.....patients being denied necessary meds due
to the insurance's demanding that they try (and fail) at every lesser med
first.  The union is helping teachers and their families in these cases.
So, now we know we can tap into them.

The weirdest thing happened at the pharmacy.  I'd been to Pauls, we Happy
Danced and he gave me my scripts.  Then i got a haircut, bought two outfits
and two pairs of shoes, waiting for the pharmacy to receive their daily
shipment.  Got to the pharmacy, loaded with every paper, letter, reference
number and phone number regarding the situation, expecting the pharmacist to
get a refusal.  Didn't happen.  I had a few other meds to pick up.  So Ted
fills everything and slaps the labels onto the boxes.  Then he put them on
the counter for me to transfer them over to the cashier.  I could not walk
forward.  I stood, staring at the boxes, unable to approach them.  Felt like
an idiot, cuz everyone was watching, but i could not allow myself to take
them.  Finally a cashier who knows me, picked up the meds, placed  them on
the cashier counter, then came to me and led me over there.  Again, i just
stared at them.  She asked what was wrong.  I told her, then started to cry
(idiot, i KNOW that makes my pain worse...i'd been trying not to cry up till
then) and i told her, &quot;They're going to take them from me again.  I know
it.&quot;  Wisely, the woman said, &quot;You've been given a blessing.  Take this now,
and He'll take care of you when that time comes.&quot;

It was exactly what i needed to hear.  Paid for everything and drove home.
I didn't take a sucker until i was to pick up chris, about three hours
later.  I've only used 3 suckers since rec'd them Friday afternoon.

Also have begun to realize something...or remember it.  On the Actiq, my day
is filled with pain highs and lows.  I wake up in an ugly pain state.  Start
the first sucker around 11.  On the Dilaudid and Vicodin, i didn't have the
jolts.  It was pretty even all of the time.  Problem was, that &quot;even&quot; was at
a point where i couldn't do anything.  At least during the lesser pain times
the Actiq affords, i can go out and play guitar and such.  But i had
forgotten the high-low thing.

When i had to go do something on Vicodin, i had to take one and bring 3 with
me....they only last about 40 minutes.  The suckers give me about 3 hours
each.

On the Actiq, also, my brain isn't as &quot;quick&quot; as it tends to be on Vicodin.
I write scripts, re-write songs and write articles for the church monthly.
On Actiq, my brain doesn't enter the playground as easily.

However, life on the whole, is better with it.  I'm able to exercise, drive,
and participate for a few hours.  Problem is, i tried to do EVERYTHING on
Friday.  Boo-boo.

Gotta go re-string my guitar &amp; shower.  Again, thank you for all you've put
up with from the Lavon corner lately.  I'm usually not this bad of a
mess....really!

deep peace,
Lavon

&gt;&gt;Thanks for the ears, guys....Lavon

&gt; Time to call your state contact back. Maybe they can help if this is
&gt; considered a failure to agree to the terms of the arbitration. Does
&gt; the letter from the state say that their decision was for a specified
&gt; period of time? It also might be worth another $200 to see what the
&gt; lawyer has to say.

&gt; This is what I have come to expect from PacifiCare/United Health. If
&gt; you are in N. CA. contact Call 3 for Action, a KCRA news feature that
&gt; has righted wrongs in the past. I don't think Pacificare/United Health
&gt; wants bad publicity.

&gt; Mike
">

What's so funny, Mike, is just this last week, i suggested the KCRA thing to
another patient!  chris had suggested we use the local newspaper.  I will
wait until they deny the first appeal.

Basically, the insurance is a one-year contract...Jan 1 at 12:00 until Dec.
31 at 11:59.  Everything starts over, at least that's how they've explained
it.  I've had other insurances that extended the allowance past the first of
the year.  Reminded chris that the school district only signs up for one
year at a time.  It makes sense for the insurance to only say that for as
long as the contract extends.  What will get ugly is when i ask for it in
January, get the initial denial, then appeal.  If they deny the first
appeal, then they'd better fasten their seatbelts.

The school district actually does the sign up in October.  We can begin
then.  I won't actually wait until January.  Once the district has
contracted with them for the next year, we'll start.

The only reason the insurance would have to NOT continue to deny the med
again is if the state actually does make them pay.  Sure, chris and i would
appreciate 10 cents, but unless they have some financial gouge outta this,
there is no down side for them to put me thru the same maze.

Thanks Mike!  Get in touch with that Love chick!  We need you to get your
injections!

deep peace,
Lavon

&gt; If I am reading you accurately (there may be some doubt):

&gt; 1.) You have a binding arbitration judgment from CA ins. board allowing

&gt; 2.) United Slimebags sez it's only valid 'till yearend.

&gt; It's -really- hard for me to imagine that CA would allow UHC to
&gt; force re-arbitration (or somesuch) of the issue. At worst, I'd
&gt; expect some garbage paperwork.

&gt; That's if (very serious IF) terms of your UHC policy remain static. They
&gt; -can- and -do- change 'em from time to time (watch carefully).

&gt; If I were you, I think maybe I'd worry that hubby's employer should
&gt; change healthcare providers, a very common practice now days.
">

That has been my main sweat, too.  It's possible, but not probable.  The
district has a bunch of older folks with a zillion health problems.  Most
insurances don't want Modesto City Schools.  They'll stick with UHC cuz few
others have complained about them (though you should hear the horror stories
just on chris' campus alone!)  But yeah, the district changing insurance
carriers has been a big fear.

But i can't change what i can't affect.  At this point, odd as it has been,
i want them to keep this hell-hole of an insurance company.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; My best guess is that Anthem healthcare (or whatever they call 'em
&gt; on the W. coast) would be even worse. UHC *used* to have a good rep.

I'd been warned by a few folks as to what to expect from them.  Their
warnings have proven true, every single one of them.  Either they are the
worst run business i've seen, or they are as ruthless as they try to be.  I
dunno which is true.

Thanks, Juba!  You know, what is weird is that, having the sucker in my
system now, this a.m., i can take them on.  chris had to do almost all of
the paperwork, running around, appts. with his union and that sort alone
this last year.  Now, i can help.

I'm still kinda funky from yesterday's puker, but even with a quarter of one
sucker in my system this a.m., i have regained the confidence i'd lost, just
due to having less pain.  I forget how much of me my pain robs.

What's sad is that, i've never planned on being this...experienced.  I've
always kept a silly and optomistic outlook....thru the tumor thing, thru
being raped twice, thru going thru rehab and sinking as low as i did during
my active irresponsibility.  I've always been able to get back to that
&quot;alternate reel&quot; part of me.  I delight in Looney Tunes &amp; Warner Bros
cartoons....chris and i giggle a lot.  I also tend to be able to find the
softer side of those who come off as rather coarse.  What is joyful to me is
that, that part of me seems to be able to touch damaged folks and bring them
out into the sunlight somewhat.  Just had it happen again last Tuesday, with
a church woman who is in the hospital.  I'm able to show her the damaged
parts of me, but am still able to dance on those scars.  Sounds most
immodest, but it's true and i take such fulfillment in that.  On Actiq, i
can take on folks who need a positive &quot;invite-or&quot;....someone who has gone
thru the deep ugly and can still sing.  On the short term crap, i didn't
have the amount of time it takes to do that.  The suckers give it back to
me.

I've not said this, but it also gives chris his wife back...to a certain
extent.  We went to dinner Friday night.

still hafta shower, change guitar strings, and meet with the duet for
special music this afternoon....but the cooler weather is here, and so am i!

&gt;&gt; I'm sorry for the mess-up and the attitude they're giving you.
&gt;&gt; Really, I am.

&gt;&gt; Please, just try to chill out for a day or two and get a bit of rest
&gt;&gt; so you're not fighting tired or impaired.

&gt;&gt; Trisha in MO, exhausted yet again

&gt; I'm going to answer the others, but i had to answer Trisha today cuz, you
&gt; nailed it.  Yesterday i had the worst puker i've had in a loooong time.
&gt; Praise God that it only lasted one day!  They usually last three.  Today
&gt; i'm just jelly, but need to play guitar this afternoon at a pastor's
&gt; installation (minister's version of a wedding...he weds the church,
&gt; basically.)

&gt; There were a zillion reasons for it, any one taken on its own would have
&gt; caused a puker.  I had the big up, the big down, then the re-settling.
&gt; Then, after talking with the insurance, the pharmacy and my dr's office, i
&gt; was able to get the suckers Friday...Sept 28th, which means i'll get my
&gt; refill between Cmas &amp; New Year's Eve, carrying January as we fight again.
&gt; I'm weaning down the Dilaudid and completely tossing the Vicodin (no,
&gt; saving it for emergencies) so there might be an element of
&gt; withdrawal...that makes sense, cuz i had a couple of bouts of
&gt; diarrhea....unusual for my pukers. And i was stupid enough to eat shrimp
&gt; Friday night.  I know better....shellfish and i no longer get along.

&gt; Yesterday, Saturday 29th, was our 17th anniversary.  I spent it puking,
&gt; hurting and sleeping.  chris has already taken Monday off due to Sunday
&gt; being nuts.  We'll &quot;celebrate&quot; then.

&gt; Mom called last night and asked, when i told her, what caused it.  She
&gt; started to rattle off much of what i stated above.  I told her to pick an
&gt; ingredient.

&gt; One more thing.   We rec'd a letter from the state on Friday.  It is
&gt; vague, on purpose surely, but it hints that we will be rec'g some type of
&gt; remuneration.  Dunno if this means lowered premiums for the rest of the
&gt; year, or what.  I'll be calling B. Love at the Dept of Insurance on Monday
&gt; to get a better idea of what the letter means.  I expect U. Hellscare to
&gt; fight it.  I was ready to just let it go, but chris told me to remember
&gt; what these last months have been like.  If i can get a trip to Disneyland
&gt; outta them, heck ya, i'm gonna try.

&gt; Also, chris gets a monthly rag from the Nat'l Educator's Assoc.  This
&gt; month, it discusses this exact issue.....patients being denied necessary
&gt; meds due to the insurance's demanding that they try (and fail) at every
&gt; lesser med first.  The union is helping teachers and their families in
&gt; these cases. So, now we know we can tap into them.

&gt; The weirdest thing happened at the pharmacy.  I'd been to Pauls, we Happy
&gt; Danced and he gave me my scripts.  Then i got a haircut, bought two
&gt; outfits and two pairs of shoes, waiting for the pharmacy to receive their
&gt; daily shipment.  Got to the pharmacy, loaded with every paper, letter,
&gt; reference number and phone number regarding the situation, expecting the
&gt; pharmacist to get a refusal.  Didn't happen.  I had a few other meds to
&gt; pick up.  So Ted fills everything and slaps the labels onto the boxes.
&gt; Then he put them on the counter for me to transfer them over to the
&gt; cashier.  I could not walk forward.  I stood, staring at the boxes, unable
&gt; to approach them.  Felt like an idiot, cuz everyone was watching, but i
&gt; could not allow myself to take them.  Finally a cashier who knows me,
&gt; picked up the meds, placed  them on the cashier counter, then came to me
&gt; and led me over there.  Again, i just stared at them.  She asked what was
&gt; wrong.  I told her, then started to cry (idiot, i KNOW that makes my pain
&gt; worse...i'd been trying not to cry up till then) and i told her, &quot;They're
&gt; going to take them from me again.  I know it.&quot;  Wisely, the woman said,
&gt; &quot;You've been given a blessing.  Take this now, and He'll take care of you
&gt; when that time comes.&quot;

&gt; It was exactly what i needed to hear.  Paid for everything and drove home.
&gt; I didn't take a sucker until i was to pick up chris, about three hours
&gt; later.  I've only used 3 suckers since rec'd them Friday afternoon.

&gt;&gt; If I am reading you accurately (there may be some doubt):

&gt;&gt; 1.) You have a binding arbitration judgment from CA ins. board allowing
&gt;&gt; you the Actiq.
&gt;&gt; 2.) United Slimebags sez it's only valid 'till yearend.

&gt;&gt; It's -really- hard for me to imagine that CA would allow UHC to
&gt;&gt; force re-arbitration (or somesuch) of the issue. At worst, I'd
&gt;&gt; expect some garbage paperwork.

&gt;&gt; That's if (very serious IF) terms of your UHC policy remain static. They
&gt;&gt; -can- and -do- change 'em from time to time (watch carefully).

&gt;&gt; If I were you, I think maybe I'd worry that hubby's employer should
&gt;&gt; change healthcare providers, a very common practice now days.

&gt;That has been my main sweat, too.  It's possible, but not probable.

Whelp, doubt the actual ingrediants and such are the cost, nor the research
that is part of every med's price.

My belief is that Cephlon keeps the label as &quot;for cancer pain only&quot; because
they can multiply any price a good 70 times if it is specialized for
anything &quot;cancer.&quot;  (The education field does the same...anything marketed
&quot;for classroom use only&quot; can bear a humongo price tag.  It can be the exact
same item you take off a WalMart shelf for $8.  If it is being sold for
classroom use, put that price times 10.

If the suckers were put out simply for pain use, i'd guess the price to be
around $10 a sucker....still a lot, but more likely the market reality.

Pud, i canNOT tell you how...amazing...the last couple of days have been.
I've helped folks with stuff in the flesh world, have rarely been on the
'puter, had the neighbor girl over for several hours yesterday....it's been
a taste of my pre-January life again.  It's still not the pre-pain life i
had, but it's been a life that my heart can rejoice upon.  My brain hid the
memory of this life from me in the last few months...smart of it.

I've been a person again for a few days.

WOW!!!!!!!!

The cleaners are here, and want to dust this area...off i go!  But,
golly.....

thanks, Pud!

deep peace,

Well, you may be right. But, I gotta wonder ...

Is Cephlon cutting their own (and the patient's) throats (with over-

If you had pancreatic cancer, would you -still- have had to
go into arbitration? Aren't cancer patients being denied
Actiq (by their ins. co's) due to the exorbitant cost? These
question based on the assumption that the ins. co's care neither
a fig nor a fart about the source of a patient's pain iffen it's
gonna cost 'em a bundle.

So the binding arbitration judgment states that this judgment only
affects your current insurance contract?

Does the agreement say anything about your need as established by a
group of doctors who reviewed your claim?

What I am getting at is that this agreement should be filed as part of
your documentation in any new appeal with whatever insurance company
if and only if your new insurance policy covers prescriptions. (As I
recall that is the law's requirement. You are not protected by the
establishment of need if your insurance does not cover prescriptions.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm sorry for the mess-up and the attitude they're giving you.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Really, I am.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Please, just try to chill out for a day or two and get a bit of rest
&gt;&gt;&gt; so you're not fighting tired or impaired.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Trisha in MO, exhausted yet again

&gt;&gt; I'm going to answer the others, but i had to answer Trisha today cuz, you
&gt;&gt; nailed it.  Yesterday i had the worst puker i've had in a loooong time.
&gt;&gt; Praise God that it only lasted one day!  They usually last three.  Today
&gt;&gt; i'm just jelly, but need to play guitar this afternoon at a pastor's
&gt;&gt; installation (minister's version of a wedding...he weds the church,
&gt;&gt; basically.)

&gt;&gt; There were a zillion reasons for it, any one taken on its own would have
&gt;&gt; caused a puker.  I had the big up, the big down, then the re-settling.
&gt;&gt; Then, after talking with the insurance, the pharmacy and my dr's office,
&gt;&gt; i was able to get the suckers Friday...Sept 28th, which means i'll get my
&gt;&gt; refill between Cmas &amp; New Year's Eve, carrying January as we fight again.
&gt;&gt; I'm weaning down the Dilaudid and completely tossing the Vicodin (no,
&gt;&gt; saving it for emergencies) so there might be an element of
&gt;&gt; withdrawal...that makes sense, cuz i had a couple of bouts of
&gt;&gt; diarrhea....unusual for my pukers. And i was stupid enough to eat shrimp
&gt;&gt; Friday night.  I know better....shellfish and i no longer get along.

&gt;&gt; Yesterday, Saturday 29th, was our 17th anniversary.  I spent it puking,
&gt;&gt; hurting and sleeping.  chris has already taken Monday off due to Sunday
&gt;&gt; being nuts.  We'll &quot;celebrate&quot; then.

&gt;&gt; Mom called last night and asked, when i told her, what caused it.  She
&gt;&gt; started to rattle off much of what i stated above.  I told her to pick an
&gt;&gt; ingredient.

&gt;&gt; One more thing.   We rec'd a letter from the state on Friday.  It is
&gt;&gt; vague, on purpose surely, but it hints that we will be rec'g some type of
&gt;&gt; remuneration.  Dunno if this means lowered premiums for the rest of the
&gt;&gt; year, or what.  I'll be calling B. Love at the Dept of Insurance on
&gt;&gt; Monday to get a better idea of what the letter means.  I expect U.
&gt;&gt; Hellscare to fight it.  I was ready to just let it go, but chris told me
&gt;&gt; to remember what these last months have been like.  If i can get a trip
&gt;&gt; to Disneyland outta them, heck ya, i'm gonna try.

&gt;&gt; Also, chris gets a monthly rag from the Nat'l Educator's Assoc.  This
&gt;&gt; month, it discusses this exact issue.....patients being denied necessary
&gt;&gt; meds due to the insurance's demanding that they try (and fail) at every
&gt;&gt; lesser med first.  The union is helping teachers and their families in
&gt;&gt; these cases. So, now we know we can tap into them.

&gt;&gt; The weirdest thing happened at the pharmacy.  I'd been to Pauls, we Happy
&gt;&gt; Danced and he gave me my scripts.  Then i got a haircut, bought two
&gt;&gt; outfits and two pairs of shoes, waiting for the pharmacy to receive their
&gt;&gt; daily shipment.  Got to the pharmacy, loaded with every paper, letter,
&gt;&gt; reference number and phone number regarding the situation, expecting the
&gt;&gt; pharmacist to get a refusal.  Didn't happen.  I had a few other meds to
&gt;&gt; pick up.  So Ted fills everything and slaps the labels onto the boxes.
&gt;&gt; Then he put them on the counter for me to transfer them over to the
&gt;&gt; cashier.  I could not walk forward.  I stood, staring at the boxes,
&gt;&gt; unable to approach them.  Felt like an idiot, cuz everyone was watching,
&gt;&gt; but i could not allow myself to take them.  Finally a cashier who knows
&gt;&gt; me, picked up the meds, placed  them on the cashier counter, then came to
&gt;&gt; me and led me over there.  Again, i just stared at them.  She asked what
&gt;&gt; was wrong.  I told her, then started to cry (idiot, i KNOW that makes my
&gt;&gt; pain worse...i'd been trying not to cry up till then) and i told her,
&gt;&gt; &quot;They're going to take them from me again.  I know it.&quot;  Wisely, the
&gt;&gt; woman said, &quot;You've been given a blessing.  Take this now, and He'll take
&gt;&gt; care of you when that time comes.&quot;

&gt;&gt; It was exactly what i needed to hear.  Paid for everything and drove
&gt;&gt; home. I didn't take a sucker until i was to pick up chris, about three
&gt;&gt; hours later.  I've only used 3 suckers since rec'd them Friday afternoon.

&gt;&gt; Also have begun to realize something...or remember it.  On the Actiq, my
&gt;&gt; day is filled with pain highs and lows.  I wake up in an ugly pain state.
&gt;&gt; Start the first sucker around 11.  On the Dilaudid and Vicodin, i didn't
&gt;&gt; have the jolts.  It was pretty even all of the time.  Problem was, that
&gt;&gt; &quot;even&quot; was at a point where i couldn't do anything.  At least during the
&gt;&gt; lesser pain times the Actiq affords, i can go out and play guitar and
&gt;&gt; such.  But i had forgotten the high-low thing.

&gt;&gt; When i had to go do something on Vicodin, i had to take one and bring 3
&gt;&gt; with me....they only last about 40 minutes.  The suckers give me about 3
&gt;&gt; hours each.

&gt;&gt; On the Actiq, also, my brain isn't as &quot;quick&quot; as it tends to be on
&gt;&gt; Vicodin. I write scripts, re-write songs and write articles for the
&gt;&gt; church monthly. On Actiq, my brain doesn't enter the playground as
&gt;&gt; easily.

&gt;&gt; However, life on the whole, is better with it.  I'm able to exercise,
&gt;&gt; drive, and participate for a few hours.  Problem is, i tried to do
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING on Friday.  Boo-boo.

&gt;&gt; Gotta go re-string my guitar &amp; shower.  Again, thank you for all you've
&gt;&gt; put up with from the Lavon corner lately.  I'm usually not this bad of a
&gt;&gt; mess....really!

&gt;&gt; 8^D

&gt;&gt; deep peace,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;At this point, odd as it has been,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;i want them to keep this hell-hole of an insurance company.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I understand how you feel (I'd likely feel the same my po' self), and
&gt;&gt;&gt; I ain't gonna defend *any* healthcare ins. co's, but ...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A box of 30 of the suckers is $1400 ($2200 brand) and i use 4 bxs a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;month.  The pharmaceutical company that makes the suckers, Cephlon, has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;labelled them for cancer pain only so they can charge that extra
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;percentage
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that a &quot;cancer only&quot; med can get away with.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Near $47 per sucker? For generic??? &quot;Gott Im Himmel!!!&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Actiq is just a fentanyl formulation. Fent has been around for quite
&gt;&gt;&gt; some time.
&gt;&gt;&gt;*******************************************************
&gt;&gt;&gt; I can't figger why they cost so much (maybe someone can explain?).
&gt;&gt;&gt; The exorbitant cost has got to be 80% of your headache. If they
&gt;&gt;&gt; were reasonably priced, you'd likely not hear a sqeak (let alone &gt;&gt; a
&gt;&gt;&gt; holler) from United Gut&amp;Filet.

&gt;&gt;Whelp, doubt the actual ingrediants and such are the cost, nor the
&gt;&gt;research
&gt;&gt;that is part of every med's price.

&gt; Check.

&gt;&gt;My belief is that Cephlon keeps the label as &quot;for cancer pain only&quot;
&gt;&gt;because
&gt;&gt;they can multiply any price a good 70 times if it is specialized for
&gt;&gt;anything &quot;cancer.&quot;  (The education field does the same...anything marketed
&gt;&gt;&quot;for classroom use only&quot; can bear a humongo price tag.  It can be the
&gt;&gt;exact
&gt;&gt;same item you take off a WalMart shelf for $8.  If it is being sold for
&gt;&gt;classroom use, put that price times 10.

&gt; Well, you may be right. But, I gotta wonder ...

&gt; Is Cephlon cutting their own (and the patient's) throats (with over-
&gt; pricing)?

&gt; If you had pancreatic cancer, would you -still- have had to
&gt; go into arbitration? Aren't cancer patients being denied
&gt; Actiq (by their ins. co's) due to the exorbitant cost? These
&gt; question based on the assumption that the ins. co's care neither
&gt; a fig nor a fart about the source of a patient's pain iffen it's
&gt; gonna cost 'em a bundle.

&gt;&gt;If the suckers were put out simply for pain use, i'd guess the price to be
&gt;&gt;around $10 a sucker....still a lot, but more likely the market reality.

&gt; Sounds reasonable.

&gt;&gt;Pud, i canNOT tell you how...amazing...the last couple of days have been.
&gt;&gt;I've helped folks with stuff in the flesh world, have rarely been on the
&gt;&gt;'puter, had the neighbor girl over for several hours yesterday....it's
&gt;&gt;been
&gt;&gt;a taste of my pre-January life again.  It's still not the pre-pain life i
&gt;&gt;had, but it's been a life that my heart can rejoice upon.  My brain hid
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;memory of this life from me in the last few months...smart of it.

&gt;&gt;I've been a person again for a few days.

&gt;&gt;WOW!!!!!!!!

&gt; Well, to hell with the Actiq price issue. Rejoice!

&gt;&gt;The cleaners are here, and want to dust this area...off i go!  But,
&gt;&gt;golly.....
&gt;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;
&gt; I'm damned glad you won, and I'm damned glad you feel &quot;right&quot; again.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My best guess is that Anthem healthcare (or whatever they call 'em

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I'd been warned by a few folks as to what to expect from them.  Their
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;warnings have proven true, every single one of them.  Either they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;dunno which is true.

&gt;&gt;&gt; As near as I can tell, **all** the hc ins. providers are moving in

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I figure, okay, that's cuz the school district only has a year policy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They'll re-up it when it comes time to get the med in January.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, as you will ask, then i called them

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are only acknowledging the overturn until 12/31.  I cannot use
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;state info for the year '08.  I have to go through the entire FUCKING
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;process again.  I scared one customer service rep away and ended up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;supervisor who wanted to transfer me away, too.  I threatened her with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;legal
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;action.  No, i did not curse at any time....i know that's grounds for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;terminating the call....i was a killer customer service rep for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;several
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;years.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;she said they &quot;might&quot; want to use the state ppwk when they begin the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;appeals
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;process this time (which cannot begin until Jan 1) and &quot;maybe&quot; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;circumvent the double denial, but since it's a &quot;label&quot; issue, she
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;doubts
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;we
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;bend over&quot; letter this afternoon.  she gave me a reference number and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;told
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;me that, yes, i can get the med right away...today if i wanted.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Called
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pharmacy, they can have it tomorrow.  Called the doc, need to call in

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;finally being given the tush, and once again, it's me getting screwed.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think i have a case for cruelty, pain &amp; suffering if they don't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;allow

The Maximus group (independent group of docs who evaluate the claim for the

the time frame limitations.  Even the United Hellscare supervisor stated
that the state's decision should be part of the first appeal when they deny
the med in January.  But the binding arbitration report states that the
medication is necessary for managing my pain.

However, since the school district only signs up for one year at a time, it
is simply a cold hard business fact that the insurance stated an ending

blow...but that was all emotion...we should have expected it.)  I have to
wait for the district to sign for another year (happens in Oct, dunno what
date) to address an extension of the decision with the insurance.

The district has to get an insurance that covers prescriptions, per the
teachers' union contract. ( The district and the union agree upon the
insurance company before signing. They also have to provide dental and
vision.)  As much as chris hates the union, there are advantages....better
be, for the chunk they grab off his check each month!  We've also learned
that we can get the national union involved if the insurance hassles us when
it comes time to get the med continued thru '08.  Our local union wasn't
much help when chris went to them, but that was the state union...not the
nat'l.

We'll see....any news on your injection quantity?

&gt;&gt;&gt; So the binding arbitration judgment states that this judgment only
&gt;&gt;&gt; affects your current insurance contract?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Does the agreement say anything about your need as established by a
&gt;&gt;&gt; group of doctors who reviewed your claim?

&gt;&gt;&gt; What I am getting at is that this agreement should be filed as part of
&gt;&gt;&gt; your documentation in any new appeal with whatever insurance company
&gt;&gt;&gt; if and only if your new insurance policy covers prescriptions. (As I
&gt;&gt;&gt; recall that is the law's requirement. You are not protected by the
&gt;&gt;&gt; establishment of need if your insurance does not cover prescriptions.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Mike

&gt;&gt;The Maximus group (independent group of docs who evaluate the claim for
&gt;&gt;the
&gt;&gt;state) mentioned no time frame in the report.  It also doesn't state
&gt;&gt;anything about my insurance contract.  It's the insurance who is
&gt;&gt;introduced
&gt;&gt;the time frame limitations.  Even the United Hellscare supervisor stated
&gt;&gt;that the state's decision should be part of the first appeal when they
&gt;&gt;deny
&gt;&gt;the med in January.  But the binding arbitration report states that the
&gt;&gt;medication is necessary for managing my pain.

&gt;&gt;However, since the school district only signs up for one year at a time,
&gt;&gt;it
&gt;&gt;is simply a cold hard business fact that the insurance stated an ending
&gt;&gt;date.  (i was so up from the win that the reality of the contract was a
&gt;&gt;huge
&gt;&gt;blow...but that was all emotion...we should have expected it.)  I have to
&gt;&gt;wait for the district to sign for another year (happens in Oct, dunno what
&gt;&gt;date) to address an extension of the decision with the insurance.

&gt;&gt;The district has to get an insurance that covers prescriptions, per the
&gt;&gt;teachers' union contract. ( The district and the union agree upon the
&gt;&gt;insurance company before signing. They also have to provide dental and
&gt;&gt;vision.)  As much as chris hates the union, there are advantages....better
&gt;&gt;be, for the chunk they grab off his check each month!  We've also learned
&gt;&gt;that we can get the national union involved if the insurance hassles us
&gt;&gt;when
&gt;&gt;it comes time to get the med continued thru '08.  Our local union wasn't
&gt;&gt;much help when chris went to them, but that was the state union...not the
&gt;&gt;nat'l.
