Fog Lights should be aimed below your Low Beams.

The idea of fog lights is that they cut below your headlamps to reduce
glare. Think of standing in your kitchen on a dark night with the lights on,
you can not see outside because of the glare. If you had a light that was
below your line of sight, it could shine below the other lights and reduce
the glare that comes back at you.

At 25 ft, your headlamp should strike a horzontal line approximately 25
inches from the ground. The top of the &quot;hot spot&quot; of the Low Beam should be
set to 25 inches from the ground, and the left side lamp should be
positioned so that it does not shine onto the oncomming cars. I like to
place a blanket or similar over one headlamp so that I can adjust the other.
The hot spot of the lamp is easier to see if the other lamp is not visible.
The lamps are adjusted by screws that are located in various locations in
the vicinity of the headlamp -- different automakers do this differently,
you have to find the adjustment screws. Once you get one headlamp set, cover
it and adjust the other lamp.

Now that the head lamps are set, you can adjust the fog lamps. Your fog
lamps MUST be adjusted so they illuminate the area below the Low Beam of the
headlamps. The adjustment of the fog lamps is done via the mounting bolt on
the base of the lamp housing. Your adjustment depends greatly on the type of
beam pattern your lamps have, but it is important that your fog lamps do not
shine into the eyes of oncomming cars. I prefer my fog lamps to shine
straight in front of my car, but you might prefer your fog lamps point
toward the gutters so that animals that come from the side of the road will
be seen earlier. I do not live where animals are likely to dart out, so I
want to see stuff in the roadway as early as possible.

As a matter of law (in my State), Fog Lights must be wired so they are ON
with the Low Beams and OFF with the High Beams. This is perfectly logical
because you should NEVER use high beams in foggy conditions. Fog Lights are
also considered auxiliary lighting, therefore they should never be the only
lights you are running on the front of your car. (Having said that, my BMW
is wired so the Fog Lamps can be the only lights that are on -- the local
cops talked to me one night about this ... )

If you can, find a building with a nice smooth wall/garage door and a smooth
road/driveway/parking lot by it. Park 25ft away from the wall and hit the
wall with your lights.

Note that this is not true in California. A common modification made to
the OEM fog lights in California is to raise a leg of the fog light
relay so that the fog lights can stay on with the high beams. This fills
in the area underneath the high beams to put more light overall onto the
ground in front of you (useful when off-roading). Just remember not to
run fogs and high beams at the same time once you cross the state border
:-).

It is unlawful to have your Fog Lights ON with the High Beams. Period. It is
also stupid because if there is fog, the hight beams should not be used. I
can pull the code for you, or you can take my word for it. Fog Lights in
California are considered Auxiliary Lights, and they are only allowed to be
used with Low Beams. Mine can come without the low beams, but I got a
talking-to for doing this. It is unlawful.

It may be common practice, but it is an illegal common practice. Rolling
through a STOP sign is also common practice, but do not make the argument in
court that everybody does it.

If you want them to only come on with the low beams, you just need to
take the 'trigger' power feed to the relay from the low beam power wire
via a switch.

This way the switch will only have power when the low beams are on.  You
take the main power to the relay directly from the battery with a fuse
in the line.

Here is a link that explains a basic Bosch style light relay.

http://www.classictruckshop.com/clubs/earlyburbs/projects/bosch/relay...

I prefer to power the trigger on the relay direct from 'say' the low
beam power line or battery like the drawing and then just use the switch
as the trigger ground like the last diagram.  This way I only have a
ground line running inside.

Wire them according to the law. Buy Driviung Lights if you want them for the
High Beams.

Then you want Driving Lights, not Fog Lights.

Driving Lights have a narrow beam that is ideal for use with your High
Beams. Fog lights have a wide beam, and are intended for use with the Low
Beams.
