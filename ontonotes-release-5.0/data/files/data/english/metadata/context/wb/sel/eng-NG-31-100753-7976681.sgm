Friggin Taco Bell.  My Taco's averaged about 10 half-shreds of cheese, and I
ordered a regular nacho's.  THE DAMN CUP WAS A QUARTER FULL, I kid you not.
Are they really that strapped for cash these days?  Are they suffering
because of bad publicity over the last year?

What would you reccoemend a cheese-lover would order from there?  Personally
I would say the chili-cheese burrito with extra chese, Quesadilla's
especially the chicke, and the MexiMelt has a three different cheeses on it
I believe.  They won't skimp if you order extra cheese.

You and Taco Bell do not seem to get along. Half of your posts are
about how they have banned you, dropped an ingredient, added an
ingredient, dissed you, locked you in the restroom, etc.

Oh, and no apostrophe in &quot;tacos.&quot; And no capitalization. Ditto for
&quot;nachos.&quot;

I would agree with BBT; the cost of cheese *has* really increased lately
which may lead me to believe that Taco Bell is trying to keep their costs
down.  A good question to ask yourself would be, if you could get a &quot;fair&quot;
amount of cheese on your taco, would you pay, let's say, an extra $.20 for
it?

That's got to be the most difficult thing for a restaurant to judge.  How do
you maintain the cost of an item when prices on the market fluctuate so
much?  Do you remember the great tomato &quot;famine&quot; a few years back when it
cost upwards of 10 - 25 cents extra for a sliver of an unripe tomato on your
sandwich?

I wish I had a definitive answer for you, Jerry.  You're making me want to
hit our local Taco Bell to see if I get cheese or not.  I wonder how they do
their Mexican Pizza with hardly any shreds of cheese?

Your point being?  Yeah I diss them a lot but we get along great since their
food is delicious and cheap, which trumps everything.  I know that Mcdonalds
is the classic #1 fast food place, but Taco Bell IS WAAAAAAY up there on the
list.  I only like Mcdonalds' better becuase it's the biggest and it's the
first fast-food place I was exposed to in the early '80s.  By Volume
currently, I eat more at Taco Bell then anywhere else.

BTW I'm a high school graduate.  Kiss my ass.

And I was never locked in the restroom, you imagined that.

&gt; The &quot;cheese&quot; they use for nachos isn't really cheese.  Sure, it
&gt; has some cheese in it, but not much.  Cheese is fifth in the list
&gt; of ingredients for their nacho cheese sauce.

&gt; You can still but one of those Rico's #10 cans at CostCo for
&gt; under $6.  This would make about 50 orders of Taco Bell nachos
&gt; assuming they give you a 3.5oz squirt (if that).  And most of
&gt; these have more cheese in them than TB's cheese sauce.  These are
&gt; actually pretty good, but once you buy a can of this, you'll be
&gt; sick of nachos by the time half the can is gone.

&gt; Add a 8lb jug of sliced jalapenos from CostCo and you're set for
&gt; a year.

&gt; [Note to Jerry about saving money:  That's about $.19 for a
&gt; serving of nachos when you include chips and jalapenos]

&gt; -sw
">

&lt;ahem&gt;  care to share with us the first four ingredients, Steve?  Seems to
me there's only ONE ingrediant... CHEESE.

BTW I really don't think it's possible for me to get sick of Nacho's, I've
been eating them non-stop for the last 25 years.

The Popeye's near here accepts competitors' coupons, so I can get a leg

It works.  It does stick together a bit but with the AC running in the
car for a while you can peel off shreds for the tacos, nachos, fries, etc.

As far as anyone getting sick, very sick from non refrigerated cheese,
that's simply retarded.  It's an American myth.

As long as it's airtight and contaminant free, it doesn't matter if it melts
to fondue in your glovebox, it's still edible.

Remember, cheese has already rotted before it's sold.

I bet Bobobo bo Bobobo eats his cheese at 45 degrees.  Tsk, he's never
tasted cheese.

BTW, I once left an unopened 8oz block of swiss in a cooler (no ice) in my
truck for 3 days.  It was amorphous when I found it.  I thought about
drinking it on the spot, but I instead transported to the house and
refrigerated it.

Upon consumption the next day, all was fine, only the texture was different.

You can buy a big-ass can of nacho cheese, a big-ass bag of tortilla chips,
and a big-ass jar of jalapenos and have *NACHOS* about 50 times for the cost
of one trip to Taco Hell.

The big-ass can of nacho cheese *will not* fit in the cupholder in your car,

YOUR FUCKIN INSANE, THORNTON.  Although  the cost of a big-ass can of nacho
souce and chips could provide maybe 10 times the amount of nacho's, it still
DOESN'T cover the cost of all the other food(taco's, burritos, enchildada's,
etc), PLUS THE ADDED DETERMENT THAT YOU MUST ACTUALLY COOK THE NACHOS
YOURSELF!!!!!

And you can't live on just Nacho's alone, you need other food like Taco's
and burritos. (and of course many other foods)

Conclusion:  your point (and steve's) is invalid.

Durn, Dan.  Read your ingredient list.  The bagged, shredded stuff isn't
processed other than shredding and adding potato starch to keep it from

If you think nachos are _cooked_, I can see you've never actually made
them yourself.

While some folks use a broiler to melt the cheese, a microwave works as
well.

Melting the cheese is not the same as &quot;cooking.&quot; Even _you_ might be
able to learn to melt the cheese at home.

If you're trying to expose my a.f.fast-food side to the folks on
r.f.cooking, too late.

Do you think that a food snob should:
1.  not eat fast food at all?
2.  be selective about what fast food, understanding its limitations?

Del Taco's bean burritos are pretty darned good.  Freshly made in the
store pintos, shredded cheddar cheese and a green chile sauce that is
great.  Their green compares with standard NM style green, and might
be the single best item in the entire fast food industry.  I just got
back from Del Taco.

Popeye's spicy fried chicken is good too.  It's not fried in
hydrogenated oils, and they use young birds, which makes it extra
tender, though I'd rather they used the bigger pieces like Church's.
Popeye's sides are--for fast food--good as well, as are their
biscuits.

Have you, SusanWilliams, eaten at either/both of these places?

There's another FF place I recommend as well, http://www.lionschoice.com

You have demonstrated nothing.  How much would you pay for 50
orders of nachos at Taco Bell?

Apparently you're using a &quot;lazy factor&quot; that is 5,000 times
greater then the average reasonable person.

How much time and money would it cost you to scoop out 3oz of
cheese into a bowl, press 4 buttons, wait 30 seconds, and wash
one dish?

Now, how much time, money, gas, and embarrassment would it have
taken you to get to Taco Bell and back?  Think hard and don't

&gt; I don't know how much a single order costs. I'll look in up next time I go
&gt; there.

&gt;&gt; How much time and money would it cost you to scoop out 3oz of
&gt;&gt; cheese into a bowl, press 4 buttons, wait 30 seconds, and wash
&gt;&gt; one dish?

&gt;   A HELL of a lot more time then it takes for someone to hand me my order +
&gt; the time it takes to walk to the garbage and throw out the used
&gt; bag/wrappers.

Yes Jerry: &quot;my point is invalid, which just proves you're right.
End of discussion unless you anything else to add.&quot;

This is pretty much your stock answer to everything posted here.

I can't believe that they let people like you graduate from high
school so ill-prepared for the real world.

&gt;&gt; WRONG, because Steve wasn't telling you to make a full meal out
&gt;&gt; of nachos.  I was using it as an example of how you can sauce
&gt;&gt; money.

&gt;    you said FOR FOR HALF THE COST OF A *NORMAL* MEAL!!!!!!!!  WHICH INCLUDES
&gt; MORE THEN JUST NACHO'S!!!!!!!!

&gt; Steve, I refuse to argue with you if you can't get even these most basic
&gt; issues which you YOURSELF said, and I can quote them,  right.

Even if there was any logic your lame argument, your perception
of a &quot;normal meal&quot; is quite different than &quot;normal people&quot;.

Are you giving up again?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Your point being?????  It's a scientfic fact that larger people require more

We've been over this before.  Fat people like yourself need more
food to stay fat.  They are not normal people.  Normal people eat
normal amounts of food.  You are abnormal and choose to stay that
way by eating tremendous amounts of food.
