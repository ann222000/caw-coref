Have just received our second payment demand too. I must say that
given how the development looks in the pictures on this site taken in
November it is difficult to imagine that the shell is genuinely
completed. We would all appreciate you sharing any information
forthcoming to you from Frans.

Hi

I've received mine also and just paid it.  I think the
back section behind the pool would be finished (where
we are), as it was quite close when we visited early
November, but as you say the other back section looked
a way off.  Mind you there were a lot of workers
around, so guess its possible.

Penny  and co.

I am now concerned, that Penny and others  have  received  their letter re
2nd payment for El Andalous , and I  have just checked today's mail  and I
have not.  I am now away for over 3 weeks from tomororow and will not have
access to post or  banks until my return.
This is giving formal notice of my situation and I will deal with this
payment then.

With all the problems I  had with Ocean Breeze and the unsatisfactory
conclusion ( ie  I was left after  9+  months later of  taking my original
depoist back and not being offered any appartment option at all after the
redesign),  I do not feel confident dealing with everyone involved. hence
the group e mail.

Please can I get a reply confirming  this is acceptable.

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all.

Kind regards,

We received our demand for the second payment on 13/12 and have paid
it.Has anyone else had the demand for the kitchen and air con?
Supposedly they were due at the same time as the shell completion but
have had no mention of those.

Hi Andy

We've recently paid and in the letter it showed the
aircon price separately as also due, so sent money for
it all.  No mention of kitchen though.

Theres some new photos of the Resort Alliance
developments on their website.  Starting to plaster
part of the outside of El Andalous now!!

Hi,
There does not appear to be much consistency here.I received a request for
the second payment 2 weeks  ago along with a request for 50% of the air con
AND kitchen (ie 3,000 Euros).
It is possibly the result of issuing contracts at different times and fine
tuning the contract over that period-possibly in response to buyer/solicitor
requests,
Stephen.
