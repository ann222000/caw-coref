Which names have clanked the loudest into car history's wastebasket?
These are TheCarConnection's 15 contenders:

Ford Probe

In a single stroke, Ford managed to alienate half the potential buyers
of this otherwise not-bad sporty two-plus-two coupe. The unfortunate
connotations bothered many women in the same way that hearing that
banjo theme from Deliverance tends to put most men on edge. Not one of
Ford's better ideas.

Daihatsu Charade

It's not really a car, it's just pretending! This was one of those
econo-boxes that was not merely humiliating to drive, it embarrassed
its owner each time its name was uttered. "I drive a Charade." Good-
bye, prom date! (See also: Ford Aspire.)

Pontiac Aztek

The name's not even spelled correctly, for openers. And it didn't help
matters that the vehicle itself resembled a dumpster on wheels. The
Aztec civilization stood no chance against the ugliness (and
illiteracy) of this General Motors sheetmetal horror show.

Isuzu Big Horn

Sometimes, size really does matter! The associations conjured up here
are surely not what Isuzu intended. That's what happens when things
get lost in translation.

Mazda Protégé

Someday, it hopes to be a real car, we suppose? Tagging your car a
junior partner is forever pegging yourself a Robin, not a Batman. And
who wants to be Robin?

Toyota Yaris

A Toyota what? Maybe it doesn't matter as long as the first name is
there, but Yaris sounds like the noise you'd hear issuing from the
gullet of an exotic animal. Or maybe it is a small animal? (Sorry,
dude, my Yaris left a mess on your rug.)

Mitsubishi Mirage

Hmm, famous mirages. The Flying Dutchman? Cher's musical talent? A
"mirage" is something that's not really there, a figment of your
imagination -- when in distress, especially. Not the hot ticket for a
car name, eh?

Geo Prizm

It doesn't separate light waves, just you from your cash. At least
this thinly disguised, rebadged Toyota Corolla sold by Chevrolet was
an okay car under its goofy nameplate.

Nissan Altima

A made-up word that attempts to evoke positive associations -- in this
case, height/achievement, we think. (See also: Subaru Justy, Toyota
Camry, Olds Alero, Chevy Lumina, etc.)

Pontiac Banshee

This name never reached production, because luckily for Pontiac,
someone consulted a dictionary before the concept escaped GM's design
studios. A Banshee's shriek heralds imminent death, among things -
someone page the liability lawyers!

Dodge Swinger

You'll also find ads for these on the back pages of adult magazines.
Okay, it was the '70s, but still - why not just call it the STD?

AMC Gremlin

Do you really want to own a car named after annoying small problems
that are next-to-impossible to fix? Courtesy of the same folks who
brought you the Pacer.

Mercury Mystique

Way too close to "mistake" for comfort. (A Mercury executive made just
that slip-up at one of the press introductions for this car.) The
third or fourth attempt by Ford to build a "world car" that not even
the U.S. was much interested in.

Volkswagen Touareg

Impossible to pronounce or spell correctly without lessons, this name
takes the cake for being the most gratuitously recondite car name of
the past 30 years - not to mention its unfortunate link to a slave-
trading North African tribe.

Chevy Camaro

This one apparently has double-entendre meanings in other cultures,
such as "shrimp" -- or worse. (See also Chevy Nova; it  "doesn't go"
en espanol.)

Anyone have any additions?

Nissan Cedric.... based (IIRC) the Humber Hawk...

Datsun... Both the Fairlady and the Bluebird.... not particularly inspiring
or provoking thoughts of power and performance (the Fairlady was a two seat
sporty car.

Borgward Isabella... I recall seeing a TS many years ago and it appeared
that the intake manifold was one and the same as the valve cover - O could
be mistaken but it was extremely odd looking all the same.

Volkswagen Thing.... looked like an escapee from a B grade WW2 movie. I can
almost picture Colonel Klink standing up in the back of one of these...

Most Italian cars ever built..... how can you drive something if you can't
pronounce or spell it's name???

Yeah, but . . . the Protégé is an entry level vehicle.  I've always thought the
name fit.  You're a young professional, right out of college, you're not at
Lexus level yet, but you're on your way up.  This is the car for you now.  I
had a GLC, which was the forerunner of the 323, which was the forerunner of the
Protégé, so maybe I'm biased.

I think this model was originally called Stanza, which was another awful name.
The missus has a ten-year old Altima.  We bought it new.  Good car - silly
name.

Mazda Protege not a bad name at all.  I always thought it was fitting for
that car.

&lt;Camry, Olds Alero, Chevy Lumina, etc.)

Altima a nonsence word, but dosent sound bad.   Just look at the sales
figures.  Cant say the name hurt the car.  Quite the contrary.

&lt;AMC Gremlin

Awww... Come on !!!!  What would the US auto industry be without that cute
little Gremlin logo on the car :-)

&lt;Chevy Camaro

&lt;such as "shrimp" -- or worse. (See also Chevy Nova; it  "doesn't go"

Even though I prefer Mustangs to Camaros, I just cant think of Camaro being
a bad name by any stretch of the imagination.  Way too much juice and
history behind it !!!

I'd like to add....

The Nissan Murano....  Pronounced MORON-OH  ...   You've got to be kidding

name badge on the back of one of them, I cant help wonder who the Moron is.

Yabut, that's both a Japanese thing and in the way it's translated.
The Fairlady was built by Nissan before it was imported here under the
Datsun name, and I believe it was the orignal name of the Z car and it's
predecessor.

Pronounce Mure-ah-no. Named after the highly artistic and
multi-colored glass made on the island of Murano, being one of the first
of the highly redesigned and very distinctive looking models released by
Nissan. Now who's the moron, the driver or the clueless boob that
doesn't know where the name came from? I drove a Murano for almost two
years and would bet that it's probably a much nicer car luxury wise than
what you're driving. It is the more practical version of the Infiniti
FX-35/45 and at just under $40K comes with aluminum and leather
interior, HID and LED lights, GPS navigation, DVD player, CVT and 250HP
V6 just to name a few of it's pluses. Yeah, more power than my Mustang
had new and almost as much as the standard 4.6 Mustang. It easily
competes with the Lexus RX and Acura RDX even though it's not really
meant to. Perhaps it would behoove you to do a teeny bit of research on
a word you don't know before you go waving your penis around...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murano_glass

And then take a look at a particular car you've never seen from less
than 40 feet before you call it's owner a moron. There are many things I
miss about my old Mo, but I am more of a truck person and like my Titan
even more.

Pay close attention here.  My commentary related specifically to the
pronunciation of the name and not the origin of it.  Regardless of what the
"correct" pronunciation is, most if not all of the people I have heard speak
the word call it a "MORON-OH".  As a matter of fact, there is a TV ad for a
local dealer that pronounces it MORON-OH.  So... I'm accurate in a sense
when I say that it wasn't the best name to call it from a marketing stand
point.  My line: ("When ever I see that  name badge on the back of one of
them, I cant help wonder who the Moron is.  The man/woman driving it or the
idiot that named it.") was by no means meant to be a personal insult to any
driver of a Murano.  It meant that due to the way the rest of us simple
laymen pronounce the word, it unfortunately conjures up a negative air about
it.  One could imagine, that the owner of a Murano decided to buy one
because the name MORON-OH was self expression.  Now that you understand I
wasn't slinging personal remarks, let me repay you for the ones you have
slung at me.  First off, Big Daddy Warbucks... Don't presume that what you
drive is more "luxurious" then what I drive.  Second of all, don't lecture
me about being informed about language.  Being that you are clearly self
important, I'd have to say that you'd be surprised at my level of education
and my credentials as far as language and communications go.

&gt; them, I cant help wonder who the Moron is.  The man/woman driving it or the
&gt; idiot that named it.&quot;) was by no means meant to be a personal insult to any
&gt; driver of a Murano.  It meant that due to the way the rest of us simple
&gt; laymen pronounce the word, it unfortunately conjures up a negative air about
&gt; it.  One could imagine, that the owner of a Murano decided to buy one
&gt; because the name MORON-OH was self expression.

Wow.... you have hit on one idiosyncrasy that seems to permeate
Americana.... confusing "then" and "than"....

Which sounds better to anyone.....

A&gt; "I'd rather buy him lunch than give him a blow job"...

B&gt; "I'd rather buy him lunch then give him a blow job"....

I know which one I prefer......

And can anyone tell me why "Brokeback Mountain" was such a successful movie?
If I'm gonna get in touch with anyone's "feminine side", she better have
nice tits. "Then"... "than"... who cares how we use them???

We can make sport of any name.... but if we can get 'moron-oh' out of Murano
without applying poetic licence, I'd hate to see what some of could get out
of something innocuous... like "fellatio"....

Oh... that sounds better ".....then give him fellatio..." Whew... I feel
better now....

So.... you'd rather buy him dinner "then" give him a BJ?????

FWIW... YOU should care how you use them.... Anyone that is even passably
literate would see the difference long before the pen hits the paper.... I
recall, more than once, replying to messages from tose complaining that
their favourite search engine wouldn't return any hits on their search
requests.... Little wonder considering the creative spelling used. Google,
at least, has gone to "fuzzy" logic and will ask if you meant to search for
something with similar spelling.... But this will only reaffirm that we will
be allowed to be sloppy...

We wont accept sloppy from a doctor.... a lawyer.... a mechanic or any other
number of professions... yet we will ask everyone to allow "us" to be
sloppy....

I regularly correspond with a lot of Americans that aren't sloppy and they
are great people..... I also correspond with Americans that ride the
coat-tails of the good ones.... We have a different name for them...
