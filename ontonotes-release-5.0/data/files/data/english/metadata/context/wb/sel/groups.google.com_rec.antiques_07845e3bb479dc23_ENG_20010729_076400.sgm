Hello,
I recently attended an estate sale where I purchased a box full of old
straight razors and shaving mug brushes they are all in good shape. I have
done some searching on line to see if they have any value but I have had no
luck, can anyone shed some light on my purchase. Thanks Myssi

A simple search at Google.com produced a very nice site:
