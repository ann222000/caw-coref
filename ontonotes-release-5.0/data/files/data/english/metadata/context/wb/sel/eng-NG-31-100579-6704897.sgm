CATHERINE'S  QUEST.

IMAGINE to yourself an old, rambling, redbrick house, with odd
corners and gables here and there, all bound and clasped together with
ivy, and you have Craymoor Grange.  It was built long before Queen
Elizabeth's time, and that illustrious monarch is said to have slept
in it in one of her royal progresses--as where  has she not slept?

There still remain some remnants of bygone ages, although it has
been much modernized and added to in later - days. Among these are the
brewhouse and laundry-formerly, it is said, dining-hall and ball-room.
The latter of these is chiefly remarkable for an immense arched
window, such as you see in churches, with five lights.

When we came to the Grange this window had been partially blocked
up, and in front of it, up to one-third of its height, was a wooden
daïs, or platform, on which stood a cumbrous mangle, left there, I
suppose, by the last tenants of the house.

Of these last tenants we knew very little, for it was so long
since it had been inhabited that the oldest authority in the village
could not remember it.

There were, however, some half-defaced monuments in the village
church of Craymoor, bearing the figures and escutcheons of knights and
dames of  "the old family," as the villagers said; but the
inscriptions were worn and almost illegible, and for some time we none
of us took the pains to decipher them.

We first came to Craymoor Grange in the summer of 1849, my
husband having discovered the place in one of his rambles, and taken a
fancy to it. At first I certainly thought we could never make it our
home, it was so dilapidated and tumble-down; but by the time winter
came on we had had several repairs done and alterations made, and the
rooms really became quite presentable.

As our family was small we confined ourselves chiefly to the
newest part of the house, leaving the older rooms to the mice, dust,
and darkness. We made use of two of the old rooms, however, one as a
servants' bedroom and the other as an extra spare chamber, in case of
many visitors. For myself, though I hope I am neither nervous nor
superstitious, I confess that I would rather sleep in "our wing," as
we called the part of the house we inhabited, than in any of the old
rooms.

When Catherine 1'Estrange came to us, however, during our first
Christmas at Craymoor, I found that she was troubled with no such
fancies, bat declared that she delighted in queer old rooms, with
raftered ceilings and deep window-seats, such as ours, and begged to
be allowed to occupy the spare chamber. This I readily acceded to, as
we lad several visitors, and needed all the available rooms.

As my story has principally to do with Catherine FEstrange, I
suppose I ought to speak more fully about her. She was an old school-
friend of my daughter Ella, and at the time of which I am speaking was
just one-and-twenty, and the merriest girl I ever knew. She had stayed
with us once or twice before we came to the Grange, but we then knew
no other particulars concerning her family, than that her father had
been an Indian officer, and that he and her mother had both died in
India when she was about six years old, leaving her to the care of an
aunt living in England.

I now, after a long, and I fear a tedious, preamble, come to my
story.

On the eve of the new year of 1850, Catherine had a very bad sore
throat, and was obliged, though sorely against her inclination, to
stay in bed all day, and forego our small evening gayety.

At about 6 o'clock P.M., Ella took her some tea, and fearing she
would be dull, offered to stay with her during the evening. This,
however, Catherine would not hear of. "You go and entertain your
company," said she laughingly, "and leave me to my own devices; I feel
very lazy, and I dare say I shall go to sleep." As she had not slept
much on the preceding night, Ella thought it was the best thing she
could do; so she went out by the door leading on to the corridor,
first placing the night-lamp on a table behind the door opening on to
the laundry, so that it might not shine in her face.

She did not again visit Catherine's room until reminded to do so
by my son George, at about half-past ten. She then rapped at the door,
and receiving no answer, opened it softly, and approached the bed.
Catherine lay quite still, and Ella imagined her to be asleep. She
therefore returned to the drawing-room without disturbing her.

As it was New Year's eve, we stayed up "to see the old year out
and the new year in," and at a few minutes to twelve we all gathered
round the open window on the stairs to hear the chimes ring out from
the village church.

We were all listening breathlessly as the hall-clock struck
twelve, when a piercing cry suddenly echoed through the house, causing
us all to start in alarm. I knew that it could only proceed from
Catherine's room, for the servants were all assembled at the window
beneath us, listening, like ourselves, for the chimes. Thither
therefore I flew, followed by Ella, and we found poor Catherine in a
truly pitiable state.

She was deadly pale, in an agony of terror, and the perspiration
stood in large drops upon her forehead. It was some time before we
could succeed at all in composing her, and her first words were to
implore us to take her into another room.

She was too weak to stand, so we wrapped her in blankets, and
carried her into Ella's bedroom. I noticed that as she was taken
through the laundry she shuddered, and put her hands before her eyes.
When she was laid on Ella's bed she grew calmer, and apologized for
the trouble she had caused, saying that she had had a dreadful dream.

With this explanation we were fain to be content, though I
thought it hardly accounted for her excessive terror. I had observed,
however, that any allusion to what had passed caused her to tremble
and turn pale again, and I thought it best to refrain from exciting
her further.

When morning came I found Catherine almost her usual self again;
but i persuaded her to remain in bed until the evening, as her cold
was not much better. Ella's curiosity to hear the dream which had so
much excited her friend could now no longer be restrained; but
whenever she asked to hear it, Catherine said, "Not now; another time,
perhaps, I may tell you."

When she came down to dinner in the evening, we noticed that she
was peculiarly silent, and we endeavored to rally her into her usual
spirits, but in vain. She tried to laugh and to appear merry, poor
child; but there was evidently something on her mind.

At last, as we all sat round the fire after dinner, she spoke.
She addressed herself to my husband, but the tone of her voice caused
us all to listen.

"Mr. Fanshawe, I have something to ask of you," said she, and
then paused.

"Ask on," said Mr. Fanshawe.

"I know that you will think the request I am going to make a
peculiar one; but I have a particular reason for making it," continued
she. ''It is that you will have the wooden daïs in front of the
laundry window removed."

Mr. Fanshawe certainly was taken aback, as were we all. When he
had mastered his bewilderment, and assured himself that he had heard
aright-

"It is, indeed, a strange request, my dear Catherine," said he; "
what can be your reason for asking such a thing?"

"If you will only have it done, and not question me, you will
understand my reason," answered Catherine.

Mr. Fanshawe demurred, however, thinking it some foolish whim,
and at last Catherine said:

"I. must tell you why I wish it done, then: I am sure we shall
discover something underneath."

At tins we all looked at one another in extreme bewilderment.

"Discover something underneath? No doubt we should--cobwebs,
probably, and dust and spiders," answered Mr. Fanshawe, much amused.

Bet Catherine was not to be laughed down.

"Only do as I wish," said  she  beseechingly, "and you will see.
If you find nothing underneath the daïs but cobwebs and dust, then you
may laugh at me as much as you like." And I saw that she was serious,
for tears were actually gathering in her eyes. Of course we were all
very anxious to know what Catherine expected to find, and how she came
to suspect that there was any-thing to be found; but she would not
say, and begged us all not to question her.
And now George took upon himself to interfere.

"Let us do as Catherine wishes, father," said he; "the daïs
spoils the laundry, and would be much better away."

"Well, well," said Mr. "Fanshawe, "do as you like, only I shall
expect my share of the treasure fiat; is found.--And now," added he,
"you must have a glass of wine to warm you, Catherine, for you look
sadly pale, child."

Hoe the conversation changed, though, we often alluded to the
subject again during the evening.

The next morning the first thing in all our thoughts was
Catherine's singular request.

1 think Mr. Fanshawe had hoped she would have forgotten it, but
such was not the case; on the contrary, she enlisted George's services
the first thing after breakfast to carry out her design, and they left
the room together, accompanied by Ella.

It was a snowy morning, and Mr. Eanshawe was obliged to be away
from home all day on business, so I was quite at a loss how to
entertain my numerous guests successfully. Happily for me, however,
the mystery attendant on the removal of the daïs in the laundry
charmed them all; and I have to thank Catherine for contributing to
their amusement much better than I could possibly have done.

Not long after the disappearance of Catherine, Ella, and George,
a message was sent to us in the drawing-room requesting our presence
in the laundry ; and on all flocking there with more or less
eagerness, we found a fire burning on the old-fashioned hearth and
chairs arranged round it.

It appeared that with the help of Sam, our factotum, who was a
kind of Jack-of-all-trades, George had succeeded in loosening the
planks of the daïs, which, although strongly put together, were rotten
and worm-eaten, and that we were now summoned to be witnesses of its
removal. We found Catherine trembling with a strange eagerness, and
her face quite pale with excitement. This was shared by Ella and
George; and, judging by the important expression on their faces, I
fancied they were let further into the secret than any one else.
We all sat down in the chairs placed for our accommodation, and the
wild whistling of the wind in the huge chimney, together with the
sheets of snow which darkened the window-panes, enhanced the mystery
of the whole affair, while George and his coadjutor worked lustily on.

At length, after a great deal of panting and puffing, George was
heard to exclaim, "Now for the tug of war!" and there followed a
minute's pause, and then a crash as the loosened planks were torn
asunder, and a cloud of dust enveloped both workmen and spectators.

Involuntarily we all started forward, and a moment of the direst
confusion ensued, during which the boys of our party greatly
endangered their limbs among the broken boards.

"By George!" exclaimed my son at last--in his eagerness invoking
his patron saint--as he stumbled upon something, "there is something
here and no mistake;" and, hastily clearing away the rubbish and
clinging cobwebs, he disclosed to view what proved on examination to
be an immense oaken chest, about four feet in height, heavily carved,
and ornamented with brass mouldings corroded with age and damp.

Here was a piece of excitement indeed; never in my most
imaginative moments had I thought of anything so mysterious as this.
The most sceptical among us grew interested.

"Oh, do open it!" cried Ella, when the first exclamations of
surprise were over.

"Easier to say than to do, miss," replied Sam, exerting his
Herculean strength in vain. With the aid of a hammer and the kitchen-
poker, however, he at last succeeded in forcing it open. We all
forward eagerly to peer inside. There something in it certainly, but
we none of us could determine what, until Sam, who was the boldest of
us all, thrust in his hand and brought forth-something which caused
the bravest to start with horror, while poor Catherine sank down,
white and trembling, upon the littered floor. It was a bone, to which
adhered fragments of decaying silk.

The consternation and conjectures which followed can be better
imagined than described. Seeing the effects of the discovery upon
Catherine, and indeed upon all, I bade Sam replace it in the chest,
which George closed again, to be left until Mr. Fanshawe came home and
could investigate the matter.

The rest of the day I passed in attending to Catherine, who
seemed much shocked and overcome by what she had seen, and in trying
to divert my guests' thoughts from the subject, and dispel the gloom
which had gathered over all. In this I succeeded only partially, and
never did I welcome my husband's return more gladly than on that
evening.

On his arrival I would not let him be disturbed by the relation
of what had happened until he had finished his dinner, and it was not
till we were gathered as usual round the fire that George related the
whole story to him.

When he ended the two gentlemen left the room together, in order
that Mr. Fanshawe might verify by his own eyes what he would hardly
believe.

They were some time gone, and on their return I noticed that my
husband held in his hand an old piece of soiled parchment, with mouldy
seals affixed to it.

"We have certainly discovered much more than I thought for,
Catherine," said he, "and possibly much more than you thought for
either."  Here he paused for her to reply, but she did not.

"The bones are most probably those of some animal," added he--I
fancied I uoold detect a certain anxiety in his tone that belied what
he said;  "but in order to quell the active imaginations which I can
see are running away with some of you"--here he looked round with a
smile--"I will send for Dr. Driacoll to come and examine them
tomorrow.  I have also found a piece of parchment in the chest," he
added; " but I have not yet looked at its contents."

"Before you do that, Mr. Eanshawe, and before you send for the
surgeon," interrupted Catherine suddenly in a clear voice, " I think I
can tell you all about the bones found in the chest, and how I guessed
them to be there."

"I should certainly be very glad to be told," my husband
admitted, much surprised; "though how you can possibly know, I cannot
surmise."

"Listen, and I will tell you," answered Catherine ; and feeling
very glad that our curiosity was at last to be gratified, we all "
pricked up our ears," as George would say, to listen.

I here transcribe Catherine's story word for word, as my son
George subsequently wrote it down from her dictation.

"You all remember," she began, "my alarming you on New Year's eve
at midnight, and that I told you I was disturbed by a dreadful dream.

"I said so because I thought you would make fun of me if I called
it a vision; and yet it was much more than a vision, for I seemed to
see it waking, and it was much more vivid and consecutive than any
dream I ever had.

"Before I try to describe it, I want yon all to understand that I
seemed intuitively to comprehend what I saw, and to recognize all the
figures which appeared before me, and their relation to one another,
though I am sure I never beheld them before in my life.

"When Ella left me that night, I lay propped up with pillows,
staring idly at the strange shadows thrown by the hidden lamp across
the laundry ceiling and over the floor.  As I looked it seemed to me
that a change came over the room--
a most unaccountable change.

"Instead of the blocked-up window, the rusty mangle, and the daïs
at the farther end, I saw the window clear and distinct from top to
bottom, and in front of a deep window-seat at its base stood an oaken
chest, exactly corresponding to the one discovered this morning. The
room seemed brilliantly  lighted, and  everything was clearly and
distinctly visible; and not only was it changed, but also peopled.

"Many figures passed up and down; brocaded silks swept the floor,
and old-world forms of men in strange costumes bowed in courtly style
to the dames by their side.  Among all these figures I noticed only
one couple particularly, and I knew them to be bride and bridegroom.
The man was tall and broad, with dark hair and eyes, and a sensual and
cruel face.    He seemed, however, to be quite enslaved by the woman
by his side, whom I hardly even now like to think of, there was
something to me so repellent in her presence.

"She was tall and of middle age, and would have hem handsome were
it not for a sinister expression in her dark flashing eyes, which was
enhanced by the black eyebrows which met over them.

"She reminded me irresistibly of the effigy on the stone monument
in Cray moor church, which Ella a»d I named "the wicked woman."

"As I gazed on the strange scene before me I presently became
aware of three other figures which I had not noticed before.    They
were standing in a small arched doorway in one corner of the room
(where the servants' bedroom now is) furtively watching the gay
company.  One was a pale, careworn woman,  apparently of about five-
and-thirty, still beautiful, though haggard and mournful-looking, with
blue eyes and a fair complexion.

"Her hands rested on the shoulders of two children, one a boy and
the other a girl, of about ten and eleven years of age respectively.
They much resembled their mother, and, like her, they were meanly
dressed, though no poverty of attire could hide the nobility of their
aspect. I noticed that the mother's eyes rested chiefly on the face of
the tall stately man before mentioned, who seemed unaware or careless
of her presence;  and instinctively I knew him to be the father of her
children and the blighter of her life.

"As I looked and beheld all this, the lights vanished, the
company disappeared, and the room became dark and deserted. No, not
quite deserted, for I presently distinguished, seated on the window-
seat by the old oaken chest, the fair woman and her children again.

"The moonlight now streamed through the window upon the woman's
face, making it appear more ghastly and haggard than before. In her
long thin fingers she was holding up to the light a necklace of large
pearls, curiously interwoven in a diamond pattern, and on this the
children's eyes were fixed.

"She then hung it on the girl's fair neck, who hid it in her
bosom. Both children then twined their arms round their mother and
kissed her repeatedly, while her head sank lower and lower, and the
paleness of death overspread her features.

"This scene faded away as the other had done, and I saw the' fair
woman no more.

"Then it seemed to me that many figures passed and repassed
before the window-the wicked woman (as I shall call her to distinguish
her), accompanied by a boy the image of herself, whom I knew to be her
son. He was apparently older than the fair-haired children, who also
passed to and fro, attired as servants, and generally employed in some
menial work.

"At last the wicked woman's son, with haughty gestures, ordered
the other boy to pick up something that lay on the ground, and when he
refused, he raised his cane as though to strike him. Before he could
do so, however, the boy flew at him, and they engaged in a fierce
struggle.

"In the midst of this the wicked woman, whom I had learned to
dread, came forward and separated them; after which she pointed
imperiously to the door, and signed to the younger boy to go out.

"He obeyed her mandate, but first threw his arms round his sister
in a last embrace, and she detached the pearl necklace from off her
neck and gave it to him. He then went out, waving a last adieu to her,
and I saw him no more.

"Confused images seemed to crowd before me after this, and I
remember nothing clearly until I beheld an infirm and tottering figure
led away through the arched doorway, in whom I recognized the tall and
stately man I had first seen in company with the wicked woman, but who
was now an old man, apparently being supported to his bed to die. As
he passed out he laid one trembling hand upon the head of the fair
girl, now a blooming woman, and a softer shade came over his face.
This the wicked woman noted, and she marked her disapproval by a
vindictive frown.

"She also was older-looking, but age had in no degree softened
her features; on the contrary, they appeared to me to wear a harsher
expression than before.

"In the next scene which came before me, the wicked woman's son
was evidently making love to the girl. Both were standing by the old
window-seat, but her face was resolutely turned away from him, and
when she at last looked at him it was with an expression of
uncontrollable horror and dislike.

"Again this scene changed as those before it had done; the young
man was gone, and only the light of a grated lantern illumined the
room, or rather made darkness visible. The wicked woman was the only
occupant of the laundry; she was kneeling by the oaken chest, trying
to raise the heavy lid. In her left hand she held a piece of
parchment, with large red seals pendent from it. I knew it to be the
old man's will which she was hiding, thus defrauding the just
claimants of their rights.

"Her hands trembled, and her whole appearance denoted guilty
trepidation. At length, however, the lid was raised, but just as she
was about to replace the parchment in the chest, a figure glided
silently from a dark corner of the window-seat and confronted her. It
was the fair girl, pale, resolute, and extending her hand to claim the
will.

"After the first guilty start, which caused her to drop the
parchment into the chest, the wicked woman hurriedly tried to close
the lid. Her efforts were frustrated, however, by the girl, who leaned
with all her force upon it, keeping it back, and still held out her
hand as before.

"There followed a pause, which seemed to me very long, but which
could in reality have only lasted a minute.

"It was broken by the wicked woman, who, hastily casting a glance
behind her into the gloom of the darkened chamber, then seized the
girl by the arm and dragged her with all her force into the chest. It
was but the work of a moment, for the woman was much the more powerful
of the two, and the poor victim was too much taken by surprise to make
much resistance. I saw one despairing look in her face as her
murderess flashed the lantern before it with a hideous gleam of
triumph.

"Then the lid was pressed down upon her, and I saw no more, only
I felt an unutterable terror, and tried in vain to scream.

"This was not all the vision, however, for before I had mastered
my terror the scene was superseded by another.

"This time it was twilight, and the wicked woman and her son were
together. The son seemed to be talking eagerly, and grew more and more
excited, while the mother stood still and erect, with a malicious
smile upon her lips. Presently she moved toward the chest with a fell
purpose in her eyes, unlocked it with a key which hung from her
girdle, raised the lid and disclosed the contents.

" I understood it all now: the son was asking for the girl whom
he had loved, and whom on his return home he missed, and the wicked
woman, enraged at hearing for the first time that he had loved her,
was determined to have her revenge.

"He should see her again.

"On beholding the dread contents of the chest, the man staggered
back horrified; then, doubtless comprehending the case, he turned
suddenly upon the murderess, and threw his arm around her, and there
ensued a struggle terrible to witness.

"Her proud triumphant glance of malice was now succeeded by one
of abject fear, and, as his strength began to gain the mastery, of
despair.

"His iron frame heaved for a moment with the violence of his
efforts, the next he had forced her down into the chest upon the
mouldering body of her victim. I saw her eyes light up with the terror
of death for one second, and then her screams were stifled forever
beneath the massive lid.

"The horror of this scene was too much for me; I found voice to
scream at last, and I suppose it i my cry which alarmed you all."

When Catherine ceased speaking there was a profound silence for a
minute, which Mr. Fanshawe was the first to break as he said with a
peculiar intonation in his voice, "It is very strange, very
unaccountable," reechoing all our thoughts.

Now it happened that Mr. Fleet, our family lawyer, was among our
guests that Christmastime, and since the discovery of the chest and
bones had taken a great interest in the whole affair. He now
questioned and cross-questioned Catherine, and seemed quite satisfied
with the result.

"This would have made a fine case," said he, "if only it had been
a question of the right of succession, for any lawyer to make out; but
unfortunately the events are too long past to have any bearing upon
the present." (There Mr. Fleet was wrong, though we none of us knew it
at the time.)

We now all launched forth into conjectures and opinions, during
which Catherine lay still and weary upon the sofa. I saw this, and
thought it quite time to put an end to the day's adventures by
suggesting a retirement for the night, and we were soon all dispersed
to dream of the mysterious vision and discovery.

I think we were none of us sorry when morning dawned without any
further tragedy (by us, I mean the female part of the establishment).

When I came down to breakfast I found Mr. Fleet very active on
the subject of the night before.

"A surgeon ought to be immediately sent for to pronounce an
opinion on the contents of the chest," he said; and Dr. Driscoll
presently came, and after examining the bones minutely, decided that
they were, as we thought, those of two females, who might have been
from one to two hundred years dead.

Mr. Fleet next offered to decipher the will, for such he imagined
the parchment to be, and he and Mr. Fanshawe were closeted together
for some time.

When they at last appeared again, they looked much interested and
excited, and led me away to inform me of the result of their
examination.

They told me that the document had proved to be a will, but that
there was a circumstance connected with it which greatly added to the
mystery of the whole business. This was the mention of the name of
l'Estrange. I was, of course, as much surprised as they, and heard the
will read with great interest.

I cannot remember the technical terms in which it was expressed.
Mr. Fleet read me the translation he had made, for the original was in
old English ; but it was to this effect :

It purported to be the will of Reginald, Viscount St. Aubyn, in
which he bequeathed all his inheritance to his lawful son Francis St.
Aubyn--commonly known by the name of Francis 1'Estrange-- and to his
heirs forever. It was signed Reginald, Viscount St. Aubyn, and the
witnesses were John Murray and Phoebe Brett, who in the old copy had
each affixed their mark.

Mr. Fleet affirmed that it was a perfectly legal document, but
this was not all it contained.

There was an appendix which our lawyer translated as follows:

"In order to avoid all disputes and doubts which might otherwise
arise, I do hereby declare that my lawful wife was Editha, youngest
daughter of Francis 1'Estrange, Baronet, and that the register of our
marriage may be seen in the church of St. Andrew, Haslet. By this
marriage we had two children, a son Francis, and a daughter Catherine,
commonly called Francis and Catherine 1'Estrange. And I hereby declare
that Agatha Thornhaugh was not legally married to me as she imagined,
my lawful wife being alive at the time; neither do I leave to her son
by her first husband, Ralph Thornhaugh, any part or share in my
inheritance."

Both the will and the writing at the foot of it were dated the
14th of May, 1668.

This accumulation of mysteries caused me for a time to feel quite
bewildered and unable to think, but Mr. Fleet was in his element.

"Here is a case worth entering into," said he, and he further
went on to state that he had no doubt that the L' Estranges mentioned
in the will were our Catherine's ancestors, the Christian names being
similar rendering it more than probable. She was most likely a direct
descendant of Francis 1'Estrange, the heir mentioned in the will, who
was no doubt also the fair-haired boy Catherine had seen in her
vision.
The bones were those of his sister, the murdered Catherine 1'Estrange,
and of her murderess Agatha Thornhaugh, herself immured by her own
son ; but the matter ought not to rest on mere surmise, and the first
place to go to for corroborating evidence was Craymoor church.

The rapidity with which Mr. Fleet came to his conclusions
increased my bewilderment, and I was at a loss to know what evidence
he expected to gain from Craymoor church. He reminded me, however, of
Catherine's statement that "the wicked woman" of her vision resembled
the effigy on the monument there.

Thither, then, the lawyer repaired, accompanied by Mr. Fanshawe
and George. It was thought best to keep the sequel of the story from
Catherine and the others until it was explained more fully, as Mr.
Fleet boldly affirmed it should be. I awaited anxiously the result of
their researches, and they exceeded I think even our good
investigator's hopes.

Not only had they 'deciphered the inscription round the old
monument, but with leave from the clergyman and the assistance of the
sexton they had disinterred the coffin and found it to be filled with
stones.

I am aware that this was rather an illegal proceeding, but as Mr.
Fleet was only acting en amateur and not professionally, he did not
stick at trifles.

The inscription was in Latin, and stated that the tomb was
erected in memory of Agatha, wife of Reginald, Viscount St. Aubyn, who
was buried beneath, and who died on the 31st day of December, 1649-
exactly two hundred years before the day on which Catherine had seen
the vision.

I could not help thinking it shocking that the villagers had for
two centuries been worshipping in the presence of a perpetual lie, but
Mr. Fleet thought only of the grand corroboration of his "case." He
applied to Mr. Fanshawe to take the next step, namely, to write to
Catherine's aunt and only living relative, to tell her the whole
story, and beg her to assist in elucidating matters by giving all the
information she could respecting the l'Estrange family.

This was done, and we anxiously awaited the answer. Meantime, all
my guests were clamorous to hear the contents of the will, and I had
to appease them as best I could, by promising that they should know
all soon.

In a few days, old Miss 1'Estrange's answer came. She said her
brother, father, and grandfather had all served in India, and that she
believed her great-grandfather, who was a Francis 1'Estrange, to have
passed most of his life abroad, there having been a cloud over his
early youth. What this was, however, she could not say. She affirmed
that the l'Estranges had in old times resided in ---shire; and she
further stated that her father's family had consisted of herself and
her brother, whose only child Catherine was.

This was certainly not much information, but it was enough for
our purpose. We no longer remained in doubt as to the truth of Mr.
Fleet's version of the story, and when he himself told it to all our
family-party one evening, every one agreed that he had certainly
succeeded in making out a very clever case.

As for Catherine, on being told that the figures she had beheld
in the vision were thought to be those of her ancestors, she was not
so much surprised as I expected, but said that she had had a
presentiment all along that the tragedies she had witnessed were in
some way connected with her own family.

I must not forget to say that on ascertaining that the parish
church of Haslet was still standing, we searched the register, and
another link of evidence was made clear by the finding of the looked-
for entry.

There remains little more to be told. The charge of the old will
was committed to Mr. Fleet, and Catherine's story has been carefully
laid up among the archives of our family. I say advisedly of +our+
family, fat the line of the L'Estranges, alias St. Aubjns. has been
united to ours by the marriage of Catherine to my son George, which
took place in 1850.

I who write this am an old woman now, but I still live with my
son and daughter-in-law.

George has bought Craymoor Grange, thus rendering justice after
the lapse of two centuries, and restoring the inheritance of her
fathers to the rightful owner.

I have but one more incident to relate, and 1 have done. A short
time ago, old Miss 1' Estrange died, bequeathing all her worldly
possessions to Catherine. Among these were some old family relics.
Catherine was looking over them as George unpacked them, and she
presently came to a miniature of a young and beautiful girl with fair
hair and blue eyes, and a wistful expression, and with it a necklace
of pearls strung in a diamond pattern. On seeing these she became
suddenly grave, and handing them to me, said: "They are the same; the
young girl, and the pearl necklace I told you of."  No more was said
at the time, for the children were present, and we had always avoided
alluding to the horrible family tragedy before them; but if we had
still retained any doubt about its truth--which we had not--this would
have set it at rest.

If you were to visit Craymoor Grange now, you would find no old
laundry. The part of the house containing it has been pulled down, and
children play and chickens peckett on the ground where it once stood.

The oaken chest has also long since been destroyed.
