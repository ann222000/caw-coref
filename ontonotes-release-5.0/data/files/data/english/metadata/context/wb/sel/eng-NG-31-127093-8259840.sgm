&gt; PORT ST. LUCIE - The 62-year-old woman used plastic ties and handcuffs
&gt; to control the nine children and adults, some with special needs.

&gt; Malnourished, at least one person was starving to death while another
&gt; was &quot;abandoned&quot; two weeks ago at a Publix in St. Petersburg.

&gt; Police on Thursday said they suspect Judith Leekin, of the 100 block
&gt; of Southwest Hawthorne Circle, kept the people for profit.

&gt; &quot;The manner in which the person that we're looking at, their
&gt; lifestyle, the properties that they own, the only source of income
&gt; that we can attribute this to would be any income that was coming as a
&gt; result of caring for these people,&quot; Capt. Scott Bartal said.

&gt; Leekin faces five counts of aggravated child abuse and single counts
&gt; of tampering with a witness and possession of a fictitious
&gt; identification after an 18-year-old woman told investigators her
&gt; &quot;adoptive mother&quot; left her July 4 at a Publix in St. Petersburg.

&gt; Police tracked Leekin down to a second home in Sanford and found four
&gt; children and four &quot;adult&quot; adoptees. She turned herself in to police at
&gt; the St. Lucie County jail Thursday.

&gt; Leekin reportedly took the 18-year-old to St. Petersburg &quot;under the
&gt; guise of going to Busch Gardens,&quot; court records show. She was sent
&gt; inside to make some purchases, but Leekin was gone when she came out.

&gt; She told investigators she'd lived with Leekin since she was 5 years
&gt; old in several apartments and houses but &quot;wasn't allowed to go outside
&gt; for any reason,&quot; court records show.

&gt; She also hadn't been to a doctor, dentist or school, and since she was
&gt; 15, often wore &quot;zipties&quot; around her wrists. When Leekin left, the
&gt; zipties would be bound by another tie and then &quot;ziptied to another
&gt; person,&quot; according to records. Investigators found zipties and
&gt; handcuffs in a candy bowl in Leekin's five-bedroom home. The home
&gt; contained surveillance equipment, allegedly so she could see if state
&gt; and law enforcement officials were at the door.

&gt; The 18-year-old said she slept on the tile floor of a small hallway
&gt; with at least eight other &quot;adoptive brothers and sisters.&quot; There were
&gt; no blankets and when cold, they &quot;dealt with it.&quot; The hallway had three
&gt; access doors that locked from the outside with deadbolt locks.

&gt; Leekin routinely threatened the woman's life and said she'd &quot;shoot or
&gt; cut off her head and someone else would bury her where she would never
&gt; be found,&quot; court records show.

&gt; Bartal said a birth certificate helped point the investigation to New
&gt; York, where Leekin is thought to have lived. He also said several
&gt; counterfeit documents were recovered. The FBI is helping in the case,
&gt; but a spokesperson there could not be reached late Thursday.

&gt; &quot;There were some very serious questions as to the names of the
&gt; individuals in the house and just how they arrived to be there,&quot;
&gt; Bartal said. &quot;Birth certificates were counterfeit involving some of
&gt; these individuals, and we're still trying to learn their true
&gt; identity.&quot;

&gt; Police also aren't entirely positive of Leekin's identity. She has at
&gt; least two driver licenses with different names and Social Security
&gt; numbers. One indicates Venezuela is her country of origin and the
&gt; other Trinidad and Tobago.

&gt; The state Department of Children and Families has custody of the
&gt; children and adults. DCF apparently investigated &quot;similar allegations
&gt; for the same children&quot; in 1999, but Leekin left to avoid the probe and
&gt; the case was closed, court records show.

&gt; Lorrene Egan, District 15 operations manager with DCF, declined to
&gt; discuss that case.

&gt; &quot;This is just a very sad, sad situation,&quot; she said. &quot;Thank God
&gt; somebody made the phone call.&quot;

&gt; Bartal said other than that incident, Leekin wasn't known to the DCF
&gt; for receiving subsidies from the state. Police are investigating
&gt; whether she's getting funds from New York.

&gt; The case still is posing questions to investigators and is continuing.

&gt; &quot;Did they get here of their own free will, and if they did, what were
&gt; the circumstances that were presented to whoever turned them over to
&gt; this lady?&quot; Bartal said. &quot;What did she tell these people? We're
&gt; talking about nine people coming into control of this one person. How
&gt; did that happen?&quot;

&gt; Bartal declined to detail what kind of statements the victims gave
&gt; police.

&gt; Leekin was held Thursday in the St. Lucie County jail on $435,000
&gt; bail, a jail official said.

&gt; THE ABUSE

&gt; A state child protection team that evaluates alleged child abuse cases
&gt; to help law enforcement and social services agencies conducted medical
&gt; exams and forensic interviews on the four children. Among the
&gt; documented findings on one or more of the children are:

&gt;  Ligature marks on wrist

&gt;  Scars on back, possibly inflicted

&gt;  Burns on lower legs

&gt;  Academically delayed (second-, third- and fourth-grade level)

&gt;  Severe dental problems

&gt;  Medically fragile, can't stand up straight

&gt;  Eye problems

&gt;  Not on growth charts for height or weight

&gt;  Findings positive for physical abuse and neglect

Answers in abuse case sought in N.Y.
By Will Greenlee (Contact)

PORT ST. LUCIE - As Judith Leekin sat in St. Lucie County jail
Friday, police asked a judge in New York to unseal court records that
apparently detail how the 62-year-old woman got custody of nine
people, at least some of whom were malnourished and had been bound
with plastic ties in her five-bedroom home.

Leekin, of 114 S.W. Hawthorne Circle, was arrested Wednesday on
charges including five counts of aggravated child abuse after an 18-
year-old woman told investigators her &quot;adoptive mother&quot; left her at a
Publix in St. Petersburg on July 4.

Leekin is thought to have received custody of the nine people in
Brooklyn, N.Y., police spokesman Chuck Johnson said. At least one of
the children was described as starving, and one told a horrific tale
of being restrained and made to sleep on the tile floor of a small
hallway with at least eight other &quot;adoptive brothers and sisters.&quot;

&quot;We know this whole thing starts in New York City,&quot; Johnson said.

Capt. Scott Bartal said Leekin may have used other names to adopt the
people, some of whom are adults with special needs. Investigators also
suspect she took custody of the people to collect money for their
upbringing, but used the cash to support her lifestyle. Her local home
was valued last year at $358,500, and another she owns in Sanford is
worth about $242,000, online property records show.

&quot;On the surface it appears that it was for financial gain,&quot; Bartal
said. &quot;We're dealing with false documents and people that just aren't
able to tell us all that they may know.&quot;

Some of the documents police hope to get unsealed include birth
certificates and reports of what case workers did in terms of placing
the children.

&quot;Were they adopted? Are they foster children?&quot; Bartal said. &quot;If so,
the ones that we have, what are their names and are they the same ones
that are in the New York records?

&quot;It's going to take a long time to sort all of this through, and
positive identification is going to be one of our biggest problems,&quot;
Bartal said.

Meanwhile, the FBI is actively looking at the case to see if there's a
federal crime, Special Agent Ricardo J. Enriquez said.

&quot;They're trying to see if there's any federal law that has been
violated - for example, violation of civil rights laws,&quot; he said.

Leekin's son, who lives in an apartment complex off St. Lucie West
Boulevard, would not comment Friday.

Eight years ago, Leekin got into a heated dispute with another woman
who was living with her, Claudette Jackson, now 44, that spurred a
year of legal battles.

Leekin appeared at the courthouse in January 1999 to file a domestic
violence injunction against Jackson, claiming Jackson punched and
slapped her, scratched her chest and pushed her. Jackson was arrested
in October 1998 on a misdemeanor battery charge, but it was dropped
about a month later.

The night before she asked for the injunction, Leekin claimed Jackson
put her two &quot;nephews&quot; out of their room and threw their things down a
staircase. &quot;I was afraid for my life for the hundredth time,&quot; Leekin
wrote.

In a later court petition, Jackson wrote, &quot;Judith does not work. She
has over 10 children between the ages of 6 and 17 years of age. They
were adopted in AKA names only 2 go to school.&quot;

Jackson said Leekin got money for the children from New York and had a
savings account with $50,000 in it.

Also in 1999, someone called the Florida Department of Children &amp;
Families to report Leekin for alleged child abuse, though the case

Just can't help wishing CPS had more funding to hire more people to
have more time to supervise and check up on more placements to promote
a far better change of catching these kinds and or drive them off.

What do you think, Greg? A cut in funding would more likely improve
performance. Kick those caseloads up. Cut back on transportation.
Reduce the number of investigators.

My solution or yours.

Oh, wait. Sue them. That will be the ticket to instant improvement by
people already run ragged by double to triple the recommended
caseload, who do it year after year now with no letup.

How dare they leave. And look for better conditions of work elsewhere,
eh?

I think we ought to sue them for giving up, don't you?

They are violating our civil rights....or sumpthin'

Hyuk, hyuk.

Gimmee a third hyuk, little buddie.

More money?  How much are we paying now?
Are we getting a fair value for the current funding?

How much money did Judith Leekin get?

Are you trying to say that the agencies failed
to check up on somebody they put NINE PEOPLE with
because they just didn't have the money to check?

Why did they let go of the 1999 investigation
instead of getting LAW ENFORCEMENT involved?

Wouldn't that have been a reasonable circumstance
to ask for FBI help to locate these people?

Would the phone call have cost them too much?  &lt;sarcasm&gt;

People who perform this poorly do NOT deserve more money.

Many of the children had false birth certificates, while
Leekin has used at least five aliases, police say.
Although she immigrated to the United States,
police say U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement has no record of her name.

Kane, Do you think the agencies who placed these
9 people did ANY background check at all?

Foreign National but no record with INS?
Fake Birth Certificates?

I have heard nothing about any spouse.
How one person get NINE charges?

Did you see her upscale house?
Zip ties and cuffs were to keep the charges from
damaging the house she said.

Woman, 18, tells investigators abuse began at age 5
By PAUL QUINLAN  Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
Saturday, July 21, 2007

PORT ST. LUCIE - The drive from Port St. Lucie ended in the parking
lot of a St. Petersburg Publix around 7:20 p.m. on the Fourth of July.
Nervous about where they were headed, 18-year-old Tracey Wells got out
to use the bathroom, as did the three others in the car: a man named
Tony, Wells' adoptive mother and her adoptive brother.

Tony was the last to see her. Inside the grocery store, he handed
Wells a $20 bill and a new wallet and told her to wait there. Moments
later, she looked outside. The car was gone.

Employees called the police, who took the lost woman to the St.
Vincent de Paul Society. Tracey Wells would go on to describe a life
of imprisonment and abuse that began at age 5 and horrified those who
heard it. She spoke of being handcuffed or zip-tied to her adoptive
siblings daily, of sleeping in a tile hallway with little more than a
sheet and a pillow, and of not being able to use the bathroom.

An investigation began that would come to involve three Florida police
departments, the Department of Children and Families and the FBI,
leading Wednesday to the arrest of a 62-year-old Port St. Lucie woman,
Judith Leekin.

Authorities say Leekin earned her living keeping Wells, along with
four developmentally disabled adults and four teenagers - found
starving and scarred - in her Port St. Lucie home and collecting
support on their behalf.

As Leekin sits in the St. Lucie County jail, held in lieu of $435,000
bail on five counts of aggravated child abuse and charges of false
identification and witness tampering, investigators are tracing leads
to New York, where they believe Leekin may have adopted the teens and
obtained false identification for them and herself.

On Friday, police said they have asked a circuit judge to unseal DCF
records that might help identify the children they believe Leekin
adopted under her various aliases.

DCF is evaluating the teens - who are in temporary care, as are the
adults - and are looking into the case. They would not comment on the
investigation or on why a 1999 complaint involving Leekin and the same
children went nowhere. Leekin left Port St. Lucie then to avoid the
investigation, and the case was closed, according to court records.

Vern Melvin, head of DCF District 15, said in general that cases could
be closed because investigators turn up either no evidence of abuse or
evidence that could be explained.

&quot;What I'm suggesting here is there's some cases where it's not always
cut and dried,&quot; he said. &quot;You make the investigation and you do the
best you can with the information that's available.&quot;

Neighbors say they noticed nothing to suggest that the friendly woman
next door abused the teens or adults in her care, some of whom they
occasionally spotted performing meticulous yard work in front of the
two-story pink house at 114 S.W. Hawthorne Circle.

Steven Fenster, 61, who lives two houses down, said Leekin brought him
some wind chimes as a gift when he moved to the neighborhood.
Skeptical of some of the allegations against her, he says she seemed
warm to him and had a nice smile. From his vantage point, he saw no
signs of abuse or neglect, he said, though he wondered how she could
afford her house, as she never seemed to go to work.

&quot;It got to the point where I said, how much of this is real?&quot; said
Fenster, a retired science teacher from New York's Bronx borough. &quot;She
has a nice house. She says she owns other property. I didn't know
where the money was coming from.&quot;

Investigators found the four teenagers in the house days after Wells
was left at the St. Petersburg Publix, according to court records.
It's not clear where the adults were.

Nothing seemed unusual on the investigators' first visit, when Leekin
denied Wells' allegations and said the 18-year-old had left the home a
year earlier. But a follow-up visit later that day turned up the four
teenagers - ages 15 to 17 - hiding in an upstairs bedroom and a
surveillance system that Wells told investigators was used to alert
Leekin to the presence of police. They also found handcuffs and zip-
ties in a bowl, which Leekin said were used to keep them from damaging
the house, court records show.

When investigators later returned to take the teens away, the home was
shuttered and empty. Clothes had been pulled from closets with doors
left open and scuff marks left on the walls where pictures once hung.
Police caught up to Leekin, the kids and the adults at her second home
in Sanford, about 20 miles northeast of Orlando.

Medical and psychological exams revealed numerous problems with the
teens, who were &quot;noticeably&quot; undersized and underdeveloped, police
said. Some had scars on their backs and wrists, as well as burns on
their legs. One was deemed illiterate, while others had less than
fourth-grade educations.

The identities of all involved remain a mystery, investigators say.
Leekin herself has two Florida driver licenses, one listing Trinidad
and Tobago as her home country. The other lists Venezuela.

Police say Leekin has at least five aliases and that the documents
identifying the children are forgeries that may have originated in New
York, where Wells told investigators Leekin adopted her.

&quot;This whole thing starts in New York City,&quot; Port St. Lucie police
spokesman Chuck Johnson said.

Leekin's Miami attorney, Mario Garcia Jr., has declined to comment on
the case, citing his own ongoing investigation into the allegations.

But retired neighbors of Leekin's, such as 62-year-old David Schlein,
say that if the children who Leekin kept in her home were subjected to
a life of abuse, she hid it well.

&quot;They were real nice kids,&quot; Schlein said. &quot;They were always just
working around the house.&quot;

Because workers are up to their eyeballs in ringing phones, demands
from the court they produce voluminous reports, supervisors collecting
data from them that has to be sorted out and specifically formatted to
provide exactly what a legislative budget oversight committee is
screaming for (and for the past three decades clerical staff has been

Johnny, one of 87 children on a 39 family caseload, has set a fire,
pulled the refrigerator over on himself, smeared feces on the
neighbors car, and she better get out there right now before the cops
are called, and little Johnny is hauled away in handcuffs, ... and
that's before 10 am.

Just wait for the afternoon, when she's done with lunch, has to turn
the screeching phone back, on and wipes the crumbs from her croissant
from her desk.

Then, Greg, she'll remember, among the 412 other things she has to
decide from her prior days and the morning's work, to call the cops
because she THINKS, but has no proof, that something might be afoot
with this lady ... who has successfully hidden from her THE TOTAL
NUMBER OF PEOPLE SHE'S USING TO SCAM.

My bet is the lady has at least two revolving caseworkers going all
the time.

Or, Greg, YOU, not I, can assume that the workers had plenty of time
to hang out and jabber with her, as they picked up subtle clues that
there were nine victims....quietly holding their breaths...IN THE
OTHER HOUSE SHE OWNED WHERE SHE PUT THEM WHEN COMPANY FROM CPS AND DHS
CALLED.

Note, she had a video cam surveillance, and could simply NOT answer
the door, let the worker leave, run the victims to her other house,
and then answer the door with ONLY the current worker's charges in the
home...them carefully brainwashed to cover up for the nice lady.

I would think, that if I had detective training...which CPS workers do
not, that for a case like this, where we had only SUSPECTED there
MIGHT be a problem, I'd want about $250,000 a year for my skills.

So, Greg, YOU show us how CPS workers could have caught this very
clever lady, with the help she had (did you know about the adult
son?), the former roomie, or lover, or roomielover, and the incredible
funding to play with she had scammed, to buy the means to hide so
well?

YOU lay CPS worker for a moment since YOU are claiming they didn't do

People who YOU just asked to do the impossible, Greg (The FBI would

But cutting funding would fix it, as you say.

Now, if you don't mind, explain to me how that works.

In MY world of business I have resources: I have a production floor
with tools and materials; I have workers to turn those into my
product; I have people to sell the products (everything from salesmen
to shipping people, to advertising folks I pay for).

And I find that I am NOT turning a profit.

The logical Greegorian solution would be, of course, to cut the flow

That will get production number up, and sales up. Yep, That's what

No fingerprint images either.

PORT ST. LUCIE - The 62-year-old woman used plastic ties and handcuffs
to control the nine children and adults, some with special needs.

Malnourished, at least one person was starving to death while another
was &quot;abandoned&quot; two weeks ago at a Publix in St. Petersburg.

Police on Thursday said they suspect Judith Leekin, of the 100 block
of Southwest Hawthorne Circle, kept the people for profit.

&quot;The manner in which the person that we're looking at, their
lifestyle, the properties that they own, the only source of income
that we can attribute this to would be any income that was coming as a
result of caring for these people,&quot; Capt. Scott Bartal said.

Leekin faces five counts of aggravated child abuse and single counts
of tampering with a witness and possession of a fictitious
identification after an 18-year-old woman told investigators her
&quot;adoptive mother&quot; left her July 4 at a Publix in St. Petersburg.

Police tracked Leekin down to a second home in Sanford and found four
children and four &quot;adult&quot; adoptees. She turned herself in to police at
the St. Lucie County jail Thursday.

Leekin reportedly took the 18-year-old to St. Petersburg &quot;under the
guise of going to Busch Gardens,&quot; court records show. She was sent
inside to make some purchases, but Leekin was gone when she came out.

She told investigators she'd lived with Leekin since she was 5 years
old in several apartments and houses but &quot;wasn't allowed to go outside
for any reason,&quot; court records show.

She also hadn't been to a doctor, dentist or school, and since she was
15, often wore &quot;zipties&quot; around her wrists. When Leekin left, the
zipties would be bound by another tie and then &quot;ziptied to another
person,&quot; according to records. Investigators found zipties and
handcuffs in a candy bowl in Leekin's five-bedroom home. The home
contained surveillance equipment, allegedly so she could see if state
and law enforcement officials were at the door.

The 18-year-old said she slept on the tile floor of a small hallway
with at least eight other &quot;adoptive brothers and sisters.&quot; There were
no blankets and when cold, they &quot;dealt with it.&quot; The hallway had three
access doors that locked from the outside with deadbolt locks.

Leekin routinely threatened the woman's life and said she'd &quot;shoot or
cut off her head and someone else would bury her where she would never
be found,&quot; court records show.

Bartal said a birth certificate helped point the investigation to New
York, where Leekin is thought to have lived. He also said several
counterfeit documents were recovered. The FBI is helping in the case,
but a spokesperson there could not be reached late Thursday.

&quot;There were some very serious questions as to the names of the
individuals in the house and just how they arrived to be there,&quot;
Bartal said. &quot;Birth certificates were counterfeit involving some of
these individuals, and we're still trying to learn their true
identity.&quot;

Police also aren't entirely positive of Leekin's identity. She has at
least two driver licenses with different names and Social Security
numbers. One indicates Venezuela is her country of origin and the
other Trinidad and Tobago.

The state Department of Children and Families has custody of the
children and adults. DCF apparently investigated &quot;similar allegations
for the same children&quot; in 1999, but Leekin left to avoid the probe and
the case was closed, court records show.

Lorrene Egan, District 15 operations manager with DCF, declined to
discuss that case.

&quot;This is just a very sad, sad situation,&quot; she said. &quot;Thank God
somebody made the phone call.&quot;

Bartal said other than that incident, Leekin wasn't known to the DCF
for receiving subsidies from the state. Police are investigating
whether she's getting funds from New York.

The case still is posing questions to investigators and is continuing.

&quot;Did they get here of their own free will, and if they did, what were
the circumstances that were presented to whoever turned them over to
this lady?&quot; Bartal said. &quot;What did she tell these people? We're
talking about nine people coming into control of this one person. How
did that happen?&quot;

Bartal declined to detail what kind of statements the victims gave
police.

Leekin was held Thursday in the St. Lucie County jail on $435,000
bail, a jail official said.

THE ABUSE

A state child protection team that evaluates alleged child abuse cases
to help law enforcement and social services agencies conducted medical
exams and forensic interviews on the four children. Among the
documented findings on one or more of the children are:

?Ligature marks on wrist

?Scars on back, possibly inflicted

?Burns on lower legs

?Academically delayed (second-, third- and fourth-grade level)

?Severe dental problems

?Medically fragile, can't stand up straight

?Eye problems

?Not on growth charts for height or weight

?Findings positive for physical abuse and neglect

PORT ST. LUCIE - As Judith Leekin sat in St. Lucie County jail
Friday, police asked a judge in New York to unseal court records that
apparently detail how the 62-year-old woman got custody of nine
people, at least some of whom were malnourished and had been bound
with plastic ties in her five-bedroom home.

Leekin, of 114 S.W. Hawthorne Circle, was arrested Wednesday on
charges including five counts of aggravated child abuse after an 18-
year-old woman told investigators her &quot;adoptive mother&quot; left her at a
Publix in St. Petersburg on July 4.

Leekin is thought to have received custody of the nine people in
Brooklyn, N.Y., police spokesman Chuck Johnson said. At least one of
the children was described as starving, and one told a horrific tale
of being restrained and made to sleep on the tile floor of a small
hallway with at least eight other &quot;adoptive brothers and sisters.&quot;

&quot;We know this whole thing starts in New York City,&quot; Johnson said.

Capt. Scott Bartal said Leekin may have used other names to adopt the
people, some of whom are adults with special needs. Investigators also
suspect she took custody of the people to collect money for their
upbringing, but used the cash to support her lifestyle. Her local home
was valued last year at $358,500, and another she owns in Sanford is
worth about $242,000, online property records show.

&quot;On the surface it appears that it was for financial gain,&quot; Bartal
said. &quot;We're dealing with false documents and people that just aren't
able to tell us all that they may know.&quot;

Some of the documents police hope to get unsealed include birth
certificates and reports of what case workers did in terms of placing
the children.

&quot;Were they adopted? Are they foster children?&quot; Bartal said. &quot;If so,
the ones that we have, what are their names and are they the same ones
that are in the New York records?

&quot;It's going to take a long time to sort all of this through, and
positive identification is going to be one of our biggest problems,&quot;
Bartal said.

Meanwhile, the FBI is actively looking at the case to see if there's a
federal crime, Special Agent Ricardo J. Enriquez said.

&quot;They're trying to see if there's any federal law that has been
violated - for example, violation of civil rights laws,&quot; he said.

Leekin's son, who lives in an apartment complex off St. Lucie West
Boulevard, would not comment Friday.

Eight years ago, Leekin got into a heated dispute with another woman
who was living with her, Claudette Jackson, now 44, that spurred a
year of legal battles.

Leekin appeared at the courthouse in January 1999 to file a domestic
violence injunction against Jackson, claiming Jackson punched and
slapped her, scratched her chest and pushed her. Jackson was arrested
in October 1998 on a misdemeanor battery charge, but it was dropped
about a month later.

The night before she asked for the injunction, Leekin claimed Jackson
put her two &quot;nephews&quot; out of their room and threw their things down a
staircase. &quot;I was afraid for my life for the hundredth time,&quot; Leekin
wrote.

In a later court petition, Jackson wrote, &quot;Judith does not work. She
has over 10 children between the ages of 6 and 17 years of age. They
were adopted in AKA names only 2 go to school.&quot;

Jackson said Leekin got money for the children from New York and had a
savings account with $50,000 in it.

Also in 1999, someone called the Florida Department of Children &amp;
Families to report Leekin for alleged child abuse, though the case
apparently was closed. Because that case is included in the current
investigation, a spokeswoman said Friday the records are confidential.

She said the nine people would be taken care of &quot;physically and
psychologically,&quot; but declined to say where they'd be

NY officials stymied Fla. inquiry in '99 into woman in adopt scam   By
BRIAN SKOLOFF Associated Press Writer

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Florida officials investigating child abuse
allegations against a woman now accused in an adoption scam were
stymied in 1999 because New York officials couldn't find any record of
her then. Judith Leekin was charged last month with abusing 11 adopted
children by keeping them handcuffed and forced to soil themselves,
while lining her pockets with $1.26 million in stipends she was
supposed to use to care for them. Her attorney has filed a not guilty
plea. She first came to authorities' attention eight years ago, when
the Florida Department of Children and Families got tipped that was
abusing children adopted from New York. Florida authorities then
contacted the New York City Administration for Children's Services,
according to records unsealed by a judge Monday after The Palm Beach
Post fought for their release.
In a Feb. 22, 1999, letter to the New York agency, a Florida
investigator wrote, &quot;I am trying to locate 11 children who are
reportedly in her (Leekin's) care at this time.&quot; The Florida
investigator included in the letter three aliases for Leekin and two
Social Security numbers and requested any information about her being
a foster parent or having adopted children in New York. The New York
agency responded that it had &quot;no active records on Judith in the
system,&quot; according to the 1999 Department of Children and Families
report. &quot;Files show there may have been some type of case in the past,
but does not indicate what. Would need kids' names to thoroughly
search records.&quot; The Florida agency closed the case without finding
any evidence of abuse. Stacey Cason, who investigated the case for the
Department of Children and Families and made the inquiry of New York
officials, said she did the best job she could. She has since left the
job. &quot;I just couldn't believe it was a case I had been involved in,&quot;
Cason, 33, told The Associated Press. &quot;It's just heartbreaking.&quot;
&quot;We're still looking into all aspects of this investigation,&quot; said
Sheila Stainback, a spokeswoman for the New York City agency. She
declined further comment. Leekin, 62, of Port St. Lucie, used four
aliases over two decades in New York City to adopt the 11 children,
police said. She remains held on more than $4 million bail on 10
charges, including child abuse. She is accused of handcuffing the
children and tethering them together at night, forcing them to sleep
on a floor and soil themselves because they weren't allowed to use the
bathroom. She could face as many as 190 years in prison if convicted
of all 10 counts. The adopted children remained in Leekin's care until
her arrest last month. Authorities showed up at Leekin's house in 1999
after receiving a report from a tipster that she abused the kids,
including beating a 12-year-old boy with an iron bar. Another tip
warned that she had a number of kids in the home, either as foster
children or adopted kids. Officials found at least three boys living
with Leekin, but she said they belonged to a relative who was in
Japan. The boys told investigators Leekin treated them well and denied
that there were any other kids living in the home. Investigators from
the Department of Children and Families never made contact with any of
the actual 11 adopted children because Leekin apparently was hiding
them, Egan said. But nothing at that point suggested the kids even
existed, she said. According to police, Leekin often threatened the
children and hid them when visitors came to the home. The adopted
children now range in age from 15 to 27. Ten of the children and
adults are now in Florida state care. One is blind and mumbles.
Another can barely walk or stand. All have scars on their wrists and
ankles, apparently from being tied and handcuffed. None appears to
have more than a fourth-grade education.

Records shed light on claims of abuse against PSL woman
By Derek Simmonsen (Contact)
Wednesday, August 8, 2007

In many ways, the complaints made to the Department of Children &amp;
Families about Judith Leekin in 1999 mirror the criminal charges she
faces now, according to new records released Tuesday by the agency.

Leekin, 62, was charged last week with 10 felonies after being
suspected of adopting 11 children in New York and collecting up to $2
million for their care, but abusing and neglecting them instead.

She remains at the St. Lucie County Jail on more than $4 million bond
and has pleaded not guilty to the charges. She could face up to 190
years in prison if convicted on all 10 counts.

Between Feb. 3-5, 1999, there were four calls made to DCF from two
unidentified people about abuse of foster children at the Leekin
household. Among the allegations made during the calls:

-Leekin hit a child in the head with an iron as discipline. The woman
who made the allegation said she witnessed the incident and had a
blanket with blood on it.

-One child had marks on his hands and feet from being tied up. A later
call said a boy had his feet and hands tied up and was placed in a
closet as punishment.

-She allowed a 17-year-old boy to bathe three girls, ages 7, 9 and 17.

-The children were made to sleep on a cold floor.

In the current case, police have said it appeared Leekin ordered her
adopted children to hide from investigators when they came over to the
house and some of the children had been coached on what to say,
factors that might have hindered investigators back in 1999.

Police reports allege the children were kept in a utility room in the
house, slept on the floor and were often bound together with handcuffs
and zip ties when she was gone or as punishment.

The adopted children now range in age from 15 to 27. Ten of the
children and adults are now in Florida state care. One is blind and
mumbles. Another can barely walk or stand. All have scars on their
wrists and ankles from allegedly being tied and handcuffed. None
appear to have more than a fourth-grade education.

Investigators didn't find Leekin at home during their first visits in
1999 and finally met with her two days after the first call came in,
records show. She said the kids at her home were her nephews and niece
and denied being a foster parent. Three boys and one girl who were
found at the home had no injuries and backed up Leekin's story, saying
they were not mistreated and their mother was in the U.S. Navy,
stationed in Japan.

DCF contacted the New York City Administration for Children's
Services, giving them three possible names for Leekin and two Social
Security numbers. Arnold Elman, a supervisor with the agency, said
there was no record of Leekin in the system, though there was &quot;some
type of case with her at one point.&quot;

It is now known that Leekin used four aliases at four separate
agencies in New York City between July 1988 and April 1996 to adopt 11
children. It is not known if she used any of the aliases given to New
York by DCF and a spokeswoman for the New York agency declined to
answer questions about the case Tuesday.

Port St. Lucie police also looked into the allegations, but couldn't
develop probable cause for an arrest, according to agency records
released last week. After an initial visit to the house, a detective
later stopped by the home about six times between February and April
1999 for follow-up and drove by without stopping more than a dozen
more times without seeing any children or adults around, records show.

The DCF case was closed on March 8, 1999, with investigators noting
that detectives were unable to find any other children in the Leekin
household, there had been no past complaints and no signs of abuse at
the home, and New York had no record of Leekin being a foster parent,
as the callers had claimed.

DCF faced several challenges in the investigation, among them Leekin's
own denials that she was a foster parent and a lack of records to
prove otherwise, said Lorrene Egan, operations manager for DCF Circuit
19, which covers the four-county area. Egan said it didn't appear the
investigators in 1999 did anything wrong, but said her office would be
reviewing the case nonetheless.

&quot;We want to learn if there was anything that could have been done
differently,&quot; she said.

Alleged adoption scam had a St. Pete connection

The Port St. Lucie woman charged in an alleged $1.26-million scam
involving her adopted children cashed in $62,000 life insurance policy
and put her home up for sale as investigators closed in, court records
show. The Associated Press says that Judith Leekin (left) lived in a
five-bedroom house with lavish furnishings and a pool, but forced all
the children to sleep together on the floor in a utility room,
according to a police investigator's report.

The children were kept in a room with the knobs reversed, allowing
someone to be locked inside, the report says. All have scars on their
wrists and ankles, apparently from being tied and handcuffed. None
appears to have more than a fourth-grade education, authorities say.

Florida officials had previously investigated abuse allegations
against her, but were stymied in 1999 because New York authorities
couldn't find her records. Local investigators caught on last month
after Leekin allegedly abandoned an 18-year-old woman at a store in
St. Petersburg - 200 miles from home.

Source: Child May Have Died In NY-Fla. Abuse Case
Teen With Down Syndrome Not Found In Judith Leekin's Alleged House Of
Horrors
Scott Weinberger
(CBS) PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. The Florida woman accused of abusing and
holding captive her 11 adopted children for years inside her lavish
home while allegedly scamming the New York child welfare system for
millions could be facing even more serious charges, CBS 2 HD has
learned.

Judith Leekin has already been charged with 10 counts of child abuse
for allegedly running a house of horrors, but sources say she may have
been involved in something far more sinister.

When police in Port. St. Lucie arrested Leekin last month, they
located only nine of the 11 children she had adopted from foster
agencies in New York City more than a decade ago. Prosecutors allege
the children, now ranging in age from 15 to 27, and some of whom are
disabled, were found malnourished, beaten, bruised, and even burned
allegedly at the hands of Leekin.

While the tenth child came forward days later, the remaining child --
a teen with Down Syndrome -- has not surfaced. Investigators now fear
that child may have died while in Leekin's care.

Sources say during interviews with detectives, several of Leekin's
adopted children revealted that Leekin told them years ago the child
they called &quot;Mo&quot; had died.

CBS 2 HD learned even though investigators know his name, date of
birth, and other vital infomation, they have been since unable to
locate the teen.

Sources say during an interview with police, Leekin's only biological
son was unable to assist in their search for &quot;Mo.&quot; Just days after his
mother's arrest, he gave CBS 2 HD an exclusive interview and said his
mother was innocent.

&quot;She's been found guilty without a trial,&quot; said the son, who asked to
keep his identity anonymous. &quot;Abuse is something continuous. I didn't
grow up abused so I don't see how it can transpire to this.&quot;

CHILD MAY HAVE DIED IN FLORIDA ADOPT MA'S CARE
DISABLED CHILD STILL UNACCOUNTED FOR
By LEONARD GREENE and ED ROBINSON
August 16, 2007 -- A child adopted by the Florida woman accused of
scamming $1.26 million from New York adoption officials may have died
in her care, a witness has told investigators.

Judith Leekin, formerly of Queens, has been charged with holding 11
adopted children captive and abusing them.

All but one of the kids have been accounted for and Port St. Lucie
police spokesman Robert Vega said yesterday the witness said &quot;one of
the children may have passed away.&quot;

But Vega said officials &quot;don't know if there's any truth to that,&quot; and
that the search for the youngster, now believed to be 19 years old, is
continuing.

WCBS/Channel 2 reported last night that several of Leekin's adopted
children told police the remaining child died in her care several
years ago.

Leekin's biological son [ Desmond ] was unable to provide cops with
leads in finding the missing teen with Down's syndrome who went by the
name of &quot;Mo,&quot; according to Channel 2.

Leekin was arrested on July 4 after she tried to abandon a
developmentally disabled 18-year-old at a market in Florida.

NY adoption records relevant in Florida abuse case, judge says
By BRIAN SKOLOFF
Associated Press Writer

FORT PIERCE, Fla. --New York City records involving a woman accused of
adopting, then abusing and neglecting 11 children while bilking that
city out of $1.26 million are relevant in the criminal case against
her in Florida, a judge ruled Thursday.

Circuit Judge James McCann's ruling opens the door for Florida
prosecutors to now ask a New York judge to unseal the adoption
records.

Judith Leekin, 62, of Port St. Lucie, faces multiple counts of abuse.
Authorities say she adopted the 11 children using four aliases in New
York City between 1988 and 1996 in a scheme to line her pockets with
subsidies for their care.

The New York City Administration for Children's Services says Leekin
received at least $1.26 million over the years. Police allege Leekin
held the children - now ranging in age from 15 to 27 - like prisoners
in her Florida home, never allowing them to attend school or see
doctors. Authorities also say Leekin handcuffed the children and
starved them. None of them have more than a fourth grade education,
and all suffer from physical and mental disabilities.

Leekin has pleaded not guilty. She could face up to 190 years in
prison if convicted.

Prosecutor Marshall Evans argued Thursday that the New York adoption
records are needed to confirm the identities of the victims and to
help establish motive.

The records could also help locate a missing 11th adopted child,
prosecutors say. Nine of the children and disabled adults are in
Florida state care. A 19-year-old who police say Leekin abandoned in
2004 remains on his own.

The children and adults told police the 11th victim, an 18-year-old
boy nicknamed &quot;MO&quot; who suffered from Down's syndrome or autism, died
sometime in 1999 or 2000.

&quot;Other than his name and date of birth and a nickname, we know very
little about him,&quot; Port St. Lucie Police Detective Stuart Klearman
told the judge Thursday. &quot;The children have been led to believe that
he died but we don't have any record of that.&quot;

Klearman also said police need the records to track down the victims'
biological parents for DNA comparisons to determine their true
identities.

&quot;We do not know for 100 percent fact ... that any of these children
are the children adopted out of New York,&quot; Klearman said. &quot;They could
be almost anybody.&quot;

He said copies of their birth certificates obtained from Leekin appear
&quot;suspicious.&quot;

Klearman also said the victims are now becoming curious.

&quot;They're asking questions - 'Who are we?'&quot; he said.

Leekin's attorney, Mario Garcia, argued the adoption records were not
relevant in the abuse case but instead would only apply to any
possible fraud charges, which have not been filed.

Outside court, Garcia said the victims received medical care and that
Leekin nurtured them, often taking them on outings to parks.

Authorities have questioned Leekin's biological son, Desmond, who also
lives in Florida. He told investigators he did not know Leekin had all
the children in her home.

However, Garcia said the Florida Department of Children &amp; Families
seized Desmond Leekin's own children on Wednesday.

Police have said conspirators could be arrested in the case.

[ Who was the conspirator AT THE AGENCIES? ]

They declined comment on Thursday. A telephone message left for DCF
was not immediately returned. A telephone listing for Desmond Leekin
could not be found.

One kid in PSL abuse case may be dead   By Derek Simmonsen Saturday,
August 11, 2007

PORT ST. LUCIE - The children taken care of by Judith Leekin said one
of her kids died sometime in the past, according to investigative
notes released in the case Friday.

Typed notes refer to a child with &quot;Down's syndrome or autism&quot;
nicknamed &quot;Mo,&quot; who the other adopted children said was dead.
Claudette Jackson, who lived with Leekin in the late 1990s before
having a falling out with her, also told police there was a child
called &quot;Mo&quot; who wasn't among the children and adults found by
investigators.

The four children were in &quot;very poor mental condition&quot; and were
described as having Stockholm syndrome, a condition where a hostage
bonds to a captor, and were said to have developed a sense of
dependence upon Leekin, according to the notes released by the State
Attorney's Office. Two of the special-needs adults would not be able
to function alone, while two others had problems stemming from their
social isolation, but have the potential to become independent.

The remaining two adults were noted as being the &quot;brightest and most
articulate.&quot; All of the children and adults in Leekin's care had
mental and psychological evaluations done on them after the police
investigation began.

Leekin, 62, was charged last week with 10 felonies after being
suspected of adopting 11 children in New York and collecting up to $2
million for their care, but abusing and neglecting them instead. She
remains at the St. Lucie County Jail on more than $4 million bond and
has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

The court documents also include more details about how the case first
came to police attention. An 18-year-old adopted daughter of Leekin
was found abandoned at a Publix grocery store in St. Petersburg on
July 4 and she gave investigators two slightly different versions of
what occurred.

In one, she said Leekin and Leekin's brother, Tony, who was visiting
from Trinidad,
were planning to take her to a condo they were going to give her so
she could live on her own. They stopped at the Publix to use the
bathroom and Tony gave her $20 and a new wallet and told her to wait
inside the store.

In another police report, she told investigators she was told they
were going to Busch Gardens and when they stopped at the Publix,
Leekin told her to go inside and get bread. Leekin told police a
similar version of this story when they questioned her July 5, saying
she got in a fight with her adopted daughter and after the woman said
she didn't want to live in the house anymore, Leekin drove aimlessly
across the state before deciding to leave her at the Publix.

The adopted daughter woman said she had been with Leekin since she was
5 years

If this women is guilty of murder of a child in her care (&quot;dead&quot; does
not always mean murdered) she should burn.

As for the treatment of the other children, she should spend the
better part, if not all, of the rest of her life in jail, a harsh one,
given what she is alleged to have done to these children.

As for CPS part in this, Greg, if they in fact DID give children to
her KNOWING that she was doing this too children no lawsuit would be
big enough to ever compensate these children, but they should have
whatever money it takes to make their lives safe and pay for rehab as
long as it takes, even if it lasts for the rest of their lives.

Now the question is, Greg, why have YOU not come up with something
similar yourself?

Why is it you wish to only screech and hysterically point, and demand
OTHERS get on some kind of mission with you (that, as I'm noting now,
you have not even bothered to outline)?

You simply want hysteria and disruption, apparently, trying to
distract folks that come here for help to any other matter possible.

Like the recent advice you gave, and again asked someone why the
subjects persons agreed to a drug test.

Greg, it's TOO FUCKING LATE to answer that question in any meaningful
way. IN other words, you just want to kick people around, as you have
done here for six long dreary years of your bullshit attempts to make
visitors here for help into YOUR lab-rats...well, you and the
dungslingers you hang with.

How many families have followed your advice, and won, Greg?

And why is that?

Police say adopted children were subjected to years of torment
By BRIAN SKOLOFF and ADAM GOLDMAN  Associated Press Writers  12:01 PM
EDT, August 18, 2007

PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.

Adoption is supposed to be a refuge for parentless children. Stephen
Wells entered a house of horrors.

Since his adoption roughly 15 years ago, Wells says he has been
attacked with a stick and a can of evaporated milk. He says he was
handcuffed and ziptied, forced to sleep on a cold tile floor in a
locked hallway, where he soiled himself because he wasn't allowed to
use the bathroom.

Scars mark his wrists from years of restraints. Police say he was
denied education, medical care and food and basically spent his entire
life indoors. His home was his prison.

The warden? Judith Leekin, his adoptive mother and the one he refers
to as &quot;evil.&quot;

Wells' account surfaced in recently released court documents and
interviews that provide a fuller picture of Leekin, the woman at the
center of a lucrative adoption scheme that stretched from hardscrabble
Jamaica, Queens, to sunny South Florida, police said.

Leekin, 62, and originally from Trinidad, used intimidation and
violence to control her 11 adopted children for years while earning a
staggering $1.26 million in adoptive subsidies, police said.

She has been charged with multiple counts of abuse and could face up
to 190 years in prison.

Leekin has pleaded not guilty and denies the allegations. Her lawyer,
Mario Garcia, says she loved and nurtured the children, providing them
with medical and dental care and taking them to parks and out to eat.

Court records tell a different story.

Much about Leekin remains a mystery. She had two Florida driver's
licenses under different last names along with two Social Security
numbers. She had at least seven known aliases.

Investigators have been slowly trying to piece together her life,
dating back to her time in Queens, when her adoption plan was likely
hatched and perfected, records indicate.

Authorities believe she used four aliases to adopt the 11 children in
New York City between 1988 and 1996. She adopted only special needs
children, who brought the highest subsidies _ up to $55 a day,
according to the New York City Administration for Children's
Services.

Her method was simple. She never went to the same adoption agency and
she never used the same name, outwitting child welfare workers since
it wasn't until 1999 that New York began requiring fingerprints from
prospective parents.

It didn't take long for a pattern of cruelty to emerge in New York.

&quot;They were treated horribly. She treated them mean. It was a shame,&quot;
David Spence, an old Queens neighbor, told a local newspaper.

In Queens, Stephen said he was forced to sleep on the basement floor,
where Leekin also employed zipties. Once, Leekin left the house all
day and Stephen, now 20, had to &quot;pee pee&quot; himself, he recently told
investigators. An enraged Leekin took the can of evaporated milk and
cut his right hand, he said. Stephen, who still calls Leekin &quot;mommy,&quot;
and some of the others are severely developmentally disabled, a
testament to their years of isolation, police say.

His sister, Tracey Wells, said Leekin once punished her by burning her
hand on a hot stove.

After the last adoption in 1998, Leekin moved to Florida with the
kids. Not much later, a rookie child welfare worker came very close to
catching Leekin after a tipster reported she was abusing the
children.

But Leekin outsmarted the Florida Department of Children and Families.
She simply denied any abuse allegations, hid the children and fled.
DCF and ACS workers never saw any of the adopted kids or their records
and closed the case.

Leekin resumed whiling away the days as an unemployed &quot;caregiver,&quot;
living in a lavishly furnished home.

&quot;Judith Leekin never worked,&quot; Claudette Jackson, Leekin's former
lover, told police. She didn't even do the dishes. There was no need.
Apparently she had never used her oven or dishwasher, police noted
after searching one of her two homes in Florida.

Her children, now ranging in age from 15 to 27, suffered in silence
and fear.

According to accounts, she would threaten to shoot the children or cut
off their heads if they ever revealed her dark secrets. As another
form of intimidation, Leekin told the children she had served five
years in prison for shooting a woman in the head.

Jackson, who did not return repeated telephone messages, told police
that Leekin was &quot;manipulative.&quot; Jackson said she could always hear
Leekin screaming at the children, &quot;cursing at them, the 'whacks' of
her hitting them and the cries of the children.&quot;

Jackson's daughter called Leekin &quot;the devil.&quot;

To evade interlopers, Leekin constructed an elaborate surveillance
system, which allowed her to keep watch outside on a closed-circuit
monitor, police said. Whenever an unexpected visitor approached, she'd
hustle the children into a passageway that could be locked with dead-
bolts from the outside, according to authorities.

Tracey told police &quot;of being forced to hide in secret rooms when
someone would come to the house.&quot;

Leekin also created fake report cards to document the progress of the
children in school, allowing her to keep ACS at bay, according to the
court papers.

The children said the abuse went on for years until police say she
abandoned Tracey, 18, 200 miles from home at a store in St.
Petersburg. That led to a search of Leekin's house and the eventual
discovery of the other kids. Nine are now are in Florida state care _
&quot;amazed that they ... could eat as much as they wanted to.&quot;

A 10th, a 19-year-old, was discovered living homeless elsewhere in the
state. He remains on his own. He said Leekin abandoned him in 2004.

Some continue to be fearful of Leekin, like Shawn Wells, who turns 28
on Sunday. A doctor described him as being brainwashed and still
scared of her. An officer said in a police report that he had to
&quot;repeatedly reassure him that she could never hurt him again.&quot;

Police are also searching for an 11th victim, an 18-year-old boy named
Shane Graham whom the children said died in 1999 or 2000. They called
him &quot;MO.&quot;

&quot;Other than his name and date of birth and a nickname, we know very
little about him,&quot; Port St. Lucie Police Detective Stuart Klearman
said.

At this point, not much is clear. Leekin's life is a tangle.

And the children are curious, too.

&quot;They're asking questions _ 'Who are we?&quot;' Klearman said.

'Mom' cut, burned kids      Sunday, August 19th 2007, 4:00 AM

Judith Leekin approaches the judge at the county courthouse in Fort
Pierce, Florida, for a pre-trial hearing on August 16, 2007.

He calls her &quot;evil&quot; - but he also still calls her &quot;Mommy.&quot;

The foster kids a former Queens woman adopted to cash in on more than
$1 million in subsidies for their care were beaten, handcuffed,
burned, locked up and threatened with death, one of the adoptees says
in new court documents.

Stephen Wells, a developmentally disabled youth adopted 15 years ago,
says foster mom Judith Leekin tied him up and made him sleep on the
basement floor. Once, when Wells, now 20, wet himself after Leekin
left him home all day, she flew into a rage and cut his hand with a
can of evaporated milk, The Associated Press reported yesterday.

His sister, Tracey Wells, said Leekin once punished her by burning her
hand on the stove.

Leekin, 62, has been charged with multiple counts of abuse in what
authorities call a coldly calculated scam that took her and her
charges from Queens to Florida. Using a variety of aliases, she
adopted 11 special-needs kids, allegedly pocketing $1.26 million in
adoptive subsidies over the course of 19 years.
