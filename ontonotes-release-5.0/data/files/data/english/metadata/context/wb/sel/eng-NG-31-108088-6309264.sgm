Dear Manager of Scrapes,
I am an 86 year old gay man (still sexually active!) living in an
assisted living facility here in Hackensack, NJ. I had never desired
to ride scooters until I was exposed to your aggresive advertising
campaign. Now, suddenly, I must have one of your new 350XXL scoots,
with the red grips option. Do you finance?

I wanted to respond to Scrape earlier, but I was so busy, I simply did not
have the time. Nevertheless, what I need to say is so important, I knew I
simply had to allocate a few minutes to write a brief post on the subject.
For the sake of review, I am not embarrassed to admit that I have neither
the training, the experience, the license, nor the clinical setting
necessary to properly reveal the truth about Scrape's tracts. Nevertheless,
I unequivocally do have the will to lift the fog from his thinking. That's
why I insist that Scrape doesn't want to acknowledge that my empirically
validated theory is that his credos are worthy of a good flush down the
toilet. In fact, Scrape would rather block all discussion on the subject. I
suppose that's because the irony is that his most crazy indiscretions are
also his most foul-mouthed. As the French say, "Les extremes se touchent."
What Scrape apparently fails to realize is that on several occasions I have
heard him state that his revenge fantasies are not worth getting outraged
about. I am not able to rightly apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas
that could provoke such a comment. What I consider far more important,
though, is that Scrape has a knack for convincing the worst types of piteous
lumpenproletariats there are that he can make all of our problems go away
merely by sprinkling some sort of magic pink pixie dust over everything that
he considers illaudable or feeble-minded. That's called marketing. The
underlying trick is to use sesquipedalian terms like
"pseudolamellibranchiate" and "barothermohygrograph" to keep his sales pitch
from sounding snappish. That's why you really have to look hard to see that
there is a proper place in life for hatred. Hatred of that which is wrong is
a powerful and valuable tool. But when Scrape perverts hatred in order to
force women to live by restrictive standards not applicable to men, it
becomes clear that certain facts are clear. For instance, if you're the type
who dares to think for yourself, then you've probably already determined
that we can divide his roorbacks into three categories: bestial, dishonest,
and headstrong.

Even if power-drunk, brusque peddlers of snake-oil remedies join Scrape's
band with the best of intentions, they will still make us less united, less
moral, less sensitive, less engaged, and more perversely ill-bred some day.
Not all, I hasten to add, do join with the best of intentions. Scrape dreams
of a time when he'll be free to erode constitutional principles that have
shaped our society and remain at the core of our freedom and liberty. That's
the way he's planned it, and that's the way it'll happen -- not may happen,
but will happen -- if we don't interfere, if we don't show principle,
gumption, verve, and nerve. Well, let's get our facts straight. Honest
people will admit that his biases are part of a larger attack on the very
notion of meritocracy and quality. Concerned people are not afraid to tell
Scrape how wrong he is. And sensible people know that Scrape wants to
produce an army of mindless insects who will obey his every command. To
produce such an army, he plans to destroy people's minds using either drugs
or an advanced form of lobotomy. Whichever approach he takes, Scrape has
warned us that within a short period of time, obtrusive, virulent drug lords
will distort the facts. If you think about it, you'll realize that Scrape's
warning is a self-fulfilling prophecy in the sense that it's our
responsibility to create and nurture a true spirit of community. That's the
first step in trying to make him pay for his crimes against humanity, and
it's the only way to advance a clear, credible, and effective vision for
dealing with our present dilemma and its most pertinacious manifestations.
Nice try to brand me as unpleasant, Scrape.

Scrape is a lifelong member of the Church of Lascivious Heathenism. Okay,
that's a slight exaggeration, but you get the drift. His slaves are merely
ciphers. Scrape is the one who decides whether or not to reduce history to
an overdetermined, wireframe sketch of what are, in reality, complex,
dynamic events. Scrape is the one who gives out the orders to pose a threat
to personal autonomy and social development. And Scrape is the one trying to
conceal how his method (or school, or ideology -- it is hard to know exactly
what to call it) goes by the name of "Scrape-ism". It is an ignorant and
avowedly unpatriotic philosophy that aims to create a global workers
plantation overseen by transnational corporations who have no more concern
for the human rights of those who produce their products or services than
Scrape has for his proxies. Scrape should get with the program. There, my
ranting is finished.

There is an interesting article about Scrape in this month's Le
Douche. It seems the French consider him a business genius. The author
details Scrape's brilliant use of retired business tactics such as
using child and slave labor, "company stores", intimidation and
extortsion to bring down his cost of production to +3.72 per bike.
That's right, he actually makes money just building the bike. Another
article (Outsourcing Monthly, June 2005), provides clear evidence that
Scrape is directly responsible for the demise of Cannondale, and the
on-going destruction of Harley-Davidson.

I AM a frigging business genius and I possess a great gift of gab.
Haven't you been reading all my posts in this group for the past
several months, even longer?  I am a near genius and expert in
EVERYTHING having to do with motorcycles.  NO ONE in this group or
anywhere else compares to my genius.

2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222

And what the hell's wrong with having 8-year-old kids put together
these fine Chinese bikes.  I pay 'em at least 37 cents an hour and
they're grateful to have the work.

As for Honky-Davidson, somebody should've put them long-haired hippoe
bastards out of business a long time ago.

LONG LIVE CHINESE BIKES !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
