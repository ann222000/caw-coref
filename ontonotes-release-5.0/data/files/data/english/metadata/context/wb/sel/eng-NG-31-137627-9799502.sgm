Rack of lamb: delicious but cruel
James Rose
February 8, 2008

Many Australians gag at the sight of a horribly gored, still living whale being hauled up into the mechanical maw of, say, a Japanese whaling ship.

Blood in the water, other whales loitering in mournful respect or in suicidal compassion; it's a scene that captures the breathtaking damage and suffering modern humanity can inflict on the landscape and those beings within it.

Take the scene to Japan and many would be in denial. Whale meat is not hard to find in the trendy nosheries in Shinjuku or Roppongi, but few who partake of a whale sashimi would be willing to trace the violent trail of their evening meal.

But many Japanese are horrified that in Australia roast lamb is a favourite meal. While the Japanese Government has somewhat desperately played the kangaroo meat card, with limited effect because few humans eat it and most kangaroos are allowed at least a normal life before their generally quick demise, the horror at the willingness of Australians to send tiny, trembling lambs to the 24/7 industrial death machines known as abattoirs seems to even run deeper in Japan.

There is no doubt there is a similar denial here too. If many lamb eaters were obliged to consider and confront the awful reality of their culinary choices, they would spurn the dish. Yet here denial rears its ugly head again and roast lamb and vegies remains among the most popular meals in this country. Leave your conscience under the napkin.

There is also, of course, the line that if livestock were not reared for meat, various breeds would die out. This angle is odd as it ties species' extinction and the destruction of biodiversity with human consumerism, somehow in an attempt to support the latter. This posits that there is nothing troubling about an animal species dying out because we have no commercial need for them. This also assumes a great deal as there is no compelling evidence that this scenario would eventuate anyway.

It raises a compelling conundrum: if you're a meat eater, are you in a position to criticise Japanese whalers?
Perhaps another way of looking at it is to consider whether you are &quot;deep&quot; enough to fully take on board the consequences of your disagreement.

The concept of deep ecology, founded by the Norwegian philosopher and proto-greenie Arne Naess, suggests humankind is wholly integrated in its environment. According to the foundation for deep ecology's website: &quot;The distinguishing and original characteristics of the deep ecology movement were its recognition of the inherent value of all living beings and the use of this view in shaping environmental policies.&quot;

In the context of whaling, the difference might be thus: a deep ecologist would say human meat-eating of any kind is an abomination to our species and an affront to the planet.

It might be allowed that it could be acceptable in some circumstances, but in developed economies, almost always, a deep ecologist would consider our carnivorous habits untenable. Whales, therefore, (and lambs) are no different to any other living being and should be preserved.

But, the more common arguments on whaling are that it is a) inhumane, b) the whales are endangered or c) whales are highly intelligent beings with a spiritual connection to humans. Other forms of slaughter for meat would be acceptable for many who make such arguments because the last two beliefs do not apply and the first belief is tangled denial.

But, what right do we have to make this judgement? Who are we to decide that one species is worthy of the worst form of abuse and mass slaughter, even extending to its young, simply to express our culinary leanings and/or support an industry, while another species should be saved, at risk of human life if need be?

Either we abhor violence in all forms against creatures with whom we share the planet, or we don't. There is no middle ground. There is no reasonable position that allows mass murder for one species and spirited protection for another. No one can plunge a knife into our planet's ecological and spiritual being with one hand and then apply a massage with the other. Doing so is pathological in the action and hypocritical in the intention.

Those many armchair ecologists and animal welfare people who chow down on their steaks, roast lamb or pork snags while they raise shrill cries in sympathy for the minke and fin whales being helplessly massacred in the Southern Ocean, are lacking the piquant condiment of reality.

Human violence against all creatures is an affront to us all, humans and other creatures alike. Many have failed to consider the philosophical and ecological underpinnings of whale hunting. Remaining thus half-standing is very uncomfortable, yet many still are unwilling to budge, up or down, and make their case clear. It detracts from their advocacy and undermines the anti-whaling cause. Perhaps anti-whalers need to consider just what it is they oppose.
