Isis X is a photographic exhibition currently on at the Women's Goal,
Constitution Hill.  It is one of those &quot;Women's Day&quot; linked attractions and
I was initially a little nervous about it.  Politically correct functions
are often dreadfully bad or simply dull.  I need not have feared.  The
visual arts works are all, without exception, magnificent photographs.  Most
of the images are portraits, but no matter what the subject matter, the
photographs are richly evocative of life in South Africa.  The photographers
are Neo Ntsoma, Suzy Bernstein, Riana Wiechers and Anna Anuradha Varney.

This photographic exhibition is special in that it also has a section
devoted to poetry. Well, the two art forms are intersperced.  Two of the
photographers, Riana Wiechers and Anna Anuradha Varney also wrote poetry,
together with elsbeth e, Sumeera Dawood, Lisemelo Tlale, Elizabeth Trew,
Anet Kemp, Baitse Mokiti, Myesha Jenkins, Arja Salafranca, Makhosanzana Xaba
and Bongekile Mbanjwa.    Poems are in English, Afrikaans and what looks to
me like one of the Nguni languages.  The latter also has English
translations.  It appears to be assumed that the people who buy the book
will be able to understand (or ignore) the Afrikaans. I think the Afrikaans
should also have been translated into English.  This is an important
statement.  Where one publishes a work, where one deviates from the main
language, one should translate into the main language.

It takes me longer to digest word based messages than it does for me to
absorb purely visual ones like photographs, and where I internalise the
message it often lasts longer than the purely visual.  It was thus with a
great deal of pleasure that I noted that the book &quot;Isis X&quot; edited by Allan
Kolski Horwitz, has both all the photographic images and all the poems on
display amongst the selection in the book.   This softcover book was selling
at the opening for the very reasonable cost of R100.

The general tone of the photographs and poems is positive.

At the opening we were fortunate to hear the poets reading some of their
works.  I've read through all the poems since the opening.   I'd like to
include some of these poems, but the selection process is overly daunting.
My recommendation?  Catch the exhibition at Constitutional Hill, and/or
purchase the book.

Ok.  Just one.  The same selection as made by the poet herself for the
opening.

The boys in my life (by Baitse Mokiti)

I like the boys who walk me home
Carrying me back to keep me safe
All the way plotting a romance
Ignoring the signs with abundance;

I like the boys whose arms meet mine
With perfect knots lovers' hearts
And all the weighing me up
Looking past the jeering eyes;

I like the lies the boys preach
Of marriage to me they speak
That type of love should be a prize
Or feverish joy if it is to last;

I like the glow my boys wear
My common smile Jezebel's ghost
Standing aloof from bleeding-heart stares
I catch teardrops in eyes that are bare;

I like the songs the boys sing
Urgent looks like boomerangs
I know well when they come back
With no aces in their decks;

What I don't like on the other hand,
Are the boys who ignore me.
