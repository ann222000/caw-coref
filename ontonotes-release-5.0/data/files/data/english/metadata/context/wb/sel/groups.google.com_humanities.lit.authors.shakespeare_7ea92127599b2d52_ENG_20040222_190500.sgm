In the February 6 issue of the prestigious The Chronicle of Higher
Education, Columbia Professor of English (David Kastan) ridicules Wood and the
Catholic Bard theory generally with an article entitled &quot;The Geraldo Approach
to the Mystery of Shakespeare&quot;. Unlike a few die-hard Stratfordians, Kastan
does not deny that there is a mystery which no one has be able to resolve
adequately and he actually refers to the authorship dispute....citing the
Oxfordian, Marlovian and Baconian alternative theories in that order.

As a Stratfordian, Kastan expresses doubt that the mystery will ever be
solved...the mystery being for him, how could the Stratford man compared to
others with similar education and life experience during the heady period of
the late 1500s have ever written these literary works? But what about the
value of more archival research that might flesh out the author's biography,
make him come alive as a real person and explain the creative process?

Kastan informs us that while &quot;biography is not irrelevant....biographical
information can only take us so far. It can show who Shakespeare was but not
what made him Shakespeare&quot;.

Ah! A clever reformulation of the standard Stratfordian Miracle Theory
to rationalize the huge gaps in the historical record that have given rise to
profound skepticism and doubt concerning the Stratford man since the 1850s.
Kastan's formulation is actually less honest than Kern Paster's pathetic
defense in the Harper's magazine debate (1999) that all Strafordians have to
do is show that the Stratford man &quot;could have done it&quot;, not they he did it.
Kern Paster challenges the skeptics to prove that the Stratford man could never
have done it...whereas Kastan says...he did it, but we can never explain
it...it was miraculous.

But what about all the current rage...the growing legion of Stratfordians
convinced that like his parents, the Stratford man had an abiding attachment to
Roman Catholicism, and despite the grave risks in the face of the ruthless
Tudor regime, may have been a pro-active crypto-Catholic? Ah...here Kastan
betrays his loyalty to Stanley Wells and Wells' buddy Robert Bearman at the
Shakespeare Trust who over the past year or so have launched a full-scale
attack (essentially pre-emptive) against Wood and, more generally, on the
troublesome Catholic Bard movement. Keep in mind those two massive
pro-Catholic Bard anthologies of scholarly essays just published by Fordham and
Manchester Universities.

The first line of preemptive attack was Bearman's assault in The
Shakespeare Quarterly (Spring 2003) on the Lancashire Catholic
connection...about which Wood is a bit skeptical himself though he uses it
(actually needs it) to fill up the video tape for part two of his four-part
documentary. The second line of attack was Bearman's companion bomb in the
2003 edition of Shakespeare Survey which argues that John Shakespeare's
Catholic spiritual testament is a forgery.

Quite well aware as he emphasizes in his book the historically
anti-Catholic bias of the Shakespeare Establishment and the nation's strong
Protestant heritage...Wood lied prior to his book's publication to prominent
Stratfordians (but not to me in 1998 in a personal email) about how &quot;Catholic&quot;
his book/film-in-the-works would be. He knew that some of them would come
after him...retaliate and so it is not trivial matter that in his book which
appeared in Britain in May 2003 before Bearman's second essay, Wood decided to
beat Bearman to the punch with his own preemptive attack...arguing in his
bibliographical essay that Bearman's argument about a forgery is silly. Why is
it silly? Because in the mid-1700s there would have been no motive for anyone
fake such a document and than hide it in the roof tiles of the
Shakespeare-Arden home on Henley Street.

How Bearman actually sustains his argument that it was a forgery is not
clear to me because I have had difficulties in locating a copy of his essay in
Shakespeare Survey (2003)...but evidently Kastan is convinced. He asserts that
the Catholic testament &quot;has been recently identified as a forgery&quot; without
providing any details.

The furious Bearman-Wells-Kastan attack on the &quot;spiritual testament&quot; of the
Stratford man's father (his mother was an Arden, that very staunch Catholic
clan in the Midlands)...echoes that of Sir Sidney Lee when in the late
1890s in the name of the Shakespeare Establishment (WASP) and all good
Englishmen ... he insisted that the testament had to have been a forgery.
Orthodox Stratfordians...many secular humanists who find linking the Bard too
closely to religion generally as distasteful...ever since have seen a need to
totally &quot;cleanse&quot; Shakespeare-Arden family of Catholicism.

And Kastan like Wells not only adopts the by now fairly extreme position of
denying altogether that this family had any strong Catholic connections after
the 1560s....which Wood and others before him have shown to have been the case
with solid post-1580 documentation. Kastan actually slants the evidence to
suit his fancy.

He calls the notoriously Catholic Blackfriar's' Gatehouse which the
Stratford man bought in 1613 a mere three years before his death as &quot;the
supposed Catholic safehouse&quot;. And Kastan goes out of the way to finger whom he
sees as one of the main academic culprits behind the Catholic Bard
movement...Professor Richard Wilson, leader of the Lancastrian wing of the
Catholic Bard movement...who has personally purchased a building adjacent to
the site of this old Catholic hideout in London...and whom Wood evidently
interviews in the fourth and final part of the film which airs this Wednesday
evening on PBS.

Prior to this discussion of Wilson and the Blackfriar's Gatehouse,
Professor Kastan contemptuously compares Wood to Geraldo Rivera looking for the
lost safe
of Al Capone in an old building in Chicago...and reminds us that Wood while
interviewing with respect some real experts (such as Peter Blayney) and
official curators, he does so with &quot;his obsessive, hearty laughter perhaps
revealing his nervousness before them&quot;.

But why should the very smug Professor Kastan resist swallowing the
heavily Catholic-flavored biographical data relating to the Stratford man? Why
side with Stanley Wells, Katherine Duncan-Jones, Park Honan, Dennis Kay, Kern
Paster, Sir Frank Kermode....even with the air-head Germaine Greer who
mindlessly declared that Protestant-Catholic division was not all the
significant historically...all who have conveyed a strong distaste this
historical research that points to Catholicization of Shakespeare? Why side
with this crowd?

Well, the answer which Kastan provides in his essay but which he
declines to explore is this huge gap between the character of the Shakespearean
literary works as non-sectarian, secular, and humanist in the Renaissance
spirit ...and a person with an abiding attachment to Roman Catholicism during
the Counter Reformation. Although Wood wants to have it both ways...he never
really at bottom doubts that abiding attachment throughout the Stratford man's
life in the book and the film...with the concluding part four of the film due
up next.

Kastan gives us pithy formulation of his primary reason for rejecting
biographical research being feverishly persuade by the Catholic Bard advocates
such as Wood. Although as I have pointed out in other essays, the Stratford
man's parents lived long lives (he outlived his dear mother Mary of the very
Catholic Ardens by only nine years), Kastan like Wells compartmentalizes the
son from the parents. Kastan allows that John Shakespeare must have been
raised a Catholic, &quot;But, Kastan says &quot;it is not so clear that William was, and
more to the point, it is even less clear this putative Catholicism left any
mark on his works&quot;.

Bingo. There you have it. Since the works show precious few traces of
a real meaningful attachment to Roman Catholicism, the author...the real
Bard...could not have had an abiding attachment to this religious
orientation....ergo it follows that all the evidence Catholic Bard advocates
push in our faces is false or twisted to serve their narrow agenda. However,
this is where Wood and those before him trump the orthodox Wells-Kastan party
line. The evidence...as I have discussed in my long essay in The Oxfordian and
the short essay in The Weekly Standard....is too overwhelming, too compelling:
that the parents were deep down hard core Catholics and that their son William
never broke free from an abiding inward attachment to that religious faith...a
faith which clashed with the Tudor regime, or what Wood calls the Elizabethan
Police State.

As anti-Stratfordians, we know or should know that precisely because he
was so Catholic inwardly, the Stratford man could never have been the author
of these particular works....perhaps some other works...but not the
Shakespearean works. Wells and Kastan know that...and the downside, outright
poisonous long-term impact Wood's expose as an outsider...as a victim of sorts,
not physically like executed Jesuit poet Robert Southwell (Wood's big hero) but
morally at the hands of the Tudor regime...has for the Stratfordian position in
the broader authorship dispute. And this underlying concern is why orthodox
Stratfordians such as Kastan and before him Clive James in his review for the
Times Literary Supplement, ridicule Wood...as a handsome walking-talking head
ideally suited for outdoor films....essentially as British version of Geraldo
Rivera posing as a serious Shakespeare expert.

Wood made clear in his lecture at the Smithsonian on October 29...a mere
two days after Professor Wells' cleverly timed-lecture in the same
auditorium...that he is upset that &quot;Stanley&quot; (i.e. Wells) and others are in a
state of denial about the strong Catholic orientation of William's family and
perhaps that of William himself. ...

If they have secular humanistic beliefs, then why the need to reject Roman
Catholicism instead of all religious belief, you bigot? Shame on me for
continuing to read your bigoted trash.

Remember, he's living in a phantasy world, quite unlike our world where
people have been affirming and denying Shakespeare's putative RCism,
based solely upon the texts, for ages.

So it is not all that surprising to find that, in his world, there are
no Protestants.

Those orthodox Stratfordians who prefer to view the Bard through the prism of
Renaissance humanism also dismiss attempts to portray the Bard as a hard core
Protestant and/or Puritan with respect to theology. They are generally
prejudiced against any attempts to view the Bard as a Christian dramatist or
literary figure as we see in the case of Dante or Milton. They see the Bard as
non-doctrinaire, but in any case, the issue on the table is the hard core
crypto-Catholicism of the Shakespeare-Arden family. This is the problem. So
chill out.
