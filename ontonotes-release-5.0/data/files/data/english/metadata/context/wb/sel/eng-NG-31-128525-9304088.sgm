Barbican Library - 6/Feb/2003

Certainty level: 100%

Here's an item from early February 2003, at which time Security Service were re-igniting hostilities against me, a direct result of my appeal
for a legal hearing against their organisation. On Thursday 6/Feb/2003 I went to the Barbican in central London with my mother to visit the library
and have a meal. Security Service naturally knew about it because it had been mentioned the previous day in our house which is under constant
surveillance on grounds of &quot;National Security&quot;, so they may have been able to inform staff there to say something to me, as has been done elsewhere.
Two of the people at the Enquiries desk in the library obviously knew of my circumstances, I spoke to one of them who was very polite, and while
I was waiting I heard the other speaking with a little less politeness, as recorded on this audio file. He said, &quot;I spy&quot;, to start a game of
guess what &quot;I spy&quot;; unsubtle, MI5 Spy. Then, at the 34 second mark on this clip he said;

&quot;So obvious you couldn't even get that. I shall have to kill you. ha, ha, ha&quot;

The words &quot;I shall have to kill you&quot; are interesting because such overt expression is rarely heard. Security Service wish me extinct.
Some years ago they were openly shouting &quot;suicide&quot; at me, so that is established. But there is an element of doublethink in their attitude;
they use people's natural prejudice against mentally ill, who are popularly painted by media as being aggressive, to try to tinge the group's
view of me and MI5's actions against me. The Security Service religion is that the country's enemies are deadly, and must therefore be
extinguished. Hence, we must seize eagerly upon the disabled schizophrenic from Clapham, and throttle him, because who knows what'll happen if we don't.

There may be a subtle agenda of population control in what the Security Service have been doing in this country since 1990. In the current issue
of 2600 Magazine (the Hacker quarterly, which I read from time to time) there is a quote from Hermann Goering on page 2; &quot;the people can always
be brought to the bidding of the leaders. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked. It works the same in any country&quot;.
2600 printed the quote as a comment on the projected war against Iraq, which does not appear to pose any threat to the territory of
those countries which wish to invade it. However the quote is somewhat relevant to my case, which is widely known about within Britain;
the security service instructs all right thinking citizens to do MI5's bidding and band together against a common enemy, while at the same time
there is a suggestion of &quot;look what'll happen to you if you don't obey us&quot;.

Lyin' Ike!

Romans 11:11-12
I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but
rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to
provoke them to jealousy. [12] Now if the fall of them be the riches of the
world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more
their fulness?

Romans 11:25-32
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery,
lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is
happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. [26] And
so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion
the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: [27] For this is
my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. [28] As concerning
the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election,
they are beloved for the fathers' sakes. [29] For the gifts and calling of
God are without repentance. [30] For as ye in times past have not believed
God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: [31] Even so have
these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain
mercy. [32] For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have
mercy upon all.

Matthew 5:18
For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one
tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

Galatians 5:3
For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a
debtor to do the whole law.

Zech. 12:10
And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look
upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one
mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that
is in bitterness for his firstborn.

1 Chron. 22:6-10
Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house
for the Lord God of Israel. [7] And David said to Solomon, My son, as for
me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the Lord my God:
[8] But the word of the Lord came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood
abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my
name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. [9]
Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will
give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be
Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. [10]
He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be
his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for
ever.

Ezekiel 44:9
Thus saith the Lord God; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor
uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that
is among the children of Israel.

Ezekiel 44:23-24
And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and
profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. [24]
And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it
according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in
all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.

&gt; I see just fine: It was the same group of people Jesus identified as being
&gt; &quot;of Abraham, but NOT &quot;of&quot; Abraham,&quot; i.e. the Pharisees.

No, the Ikes. The Pharisees shared the doctrine of the churh, and the
Christians came out of the Pharisees, whick should be obvious, since it is
the Pharisees who believed in the resurrection and the church taught the
resurrection. The only ones who are going to follow someone preaching the
resurrection are the ones who believe in the resurredtion.

Your bigotry can make you incredibly stupid at times and this is one of
those times:
Matthew 22:23
The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no
resurrection, and asked him,

As he says it is the children of promise, and it is the Jews to whom the
land and salvation are promised for ever. We are the adoption, the genos,
they are the natural children, the genea, of the promise. What you miss is
EVERYTHING!

You're passing judgment on them for the past, which is irrelevant, because
they aren't judged until we judge them: &quot;Do ye not know that the saints
shall judge the world?'&quot; (1 Cor. 6:2), and it is through our mercy that rhey
are saved: &quot; Even so have these also now not believed, that through your
mercy they also may obtain mercy&quot; (Rom 11:31).

Poor unfortinate 3-dimensional soul, lock in your little box, filling all
three dimensions and not being able to move, for you can only be in one
place at a time, and there are only three dimensions. You can see no
dispensations. Poor soul.

This Generation

The Author uses three different words translated &quot;generation,&quot; using the
primary sense of the word generation: &quot;what is generated by a generator;&quot;
for He is calling attention to the generator too. He uses &quot;genea,&quot; a word
used for a natural son to designate the people of Israel generated by Jacob,
as in &quot;This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled&quot;
(Matt 24:34). The Author uses &quot;genos,&quot; a word used for adopted son, to
designate the church, generated by adoption: &quot;ye are a chosen generation, a
royal priesthood&quot; (1 Pet 2:9), and He uses &quot;genemma&quot; to designate all
mankind generated by Adam: &quot;Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye
escape the damnation of hell?&quot; (Matt 23:33).

This is apparent when looking at scripture in which two different words for
generation are used together, as in Matt 23:33-36:

You serpents, you generation [gennema: generated by Adam] of vipers, how can
you escape the damnation of hell? Wherefore, behold, I send to you prophets,
and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and
some of them shall you scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from
city to city: That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the
earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of
Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say to
you, All these things shall come upon this generation [genea: generated by
Jacob].

That's the atonement. How does mankind, generated by Adam, escape the
damnation of hell? Mankind escapes the damnation of hell by all the sins of
the world coming upon the one generated by Jacob, who bore those sins on the
cross.

Satan has been shown this many times, but his interest is in promoting his
own gospel, not the gospel of our Lord.

Bullshit.

1) The Pharisees tried to CORRUPT the doctrine of the church.

2) The church did NOT come out of the Pharisees, who were NOT Jews. The
Church came out of Jesus, who WAS a Jew indeed, as were His disciples.

3) Just because the Pharisees got a couple of doctrines right does NOT make
them legitimate, moron.

Jn 4:21-24
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall
neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is
of the Jews.
But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship
the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship
him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit
and in truth.

But YOU idiot would have people going BACK to what Jesus terminated, now,
AND in the future.

Idiot literalist Dispensationalist.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not all Israel, which are of Israel: Neither, because they are the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of Abraham, are they all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seed.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sara
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shall have a son.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;    And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When Paul (and Jesus, and John) said they are not all Israel that are

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which is understood by everyone who has His discernment.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, that the people whom Jesus, Paul, and John said were not Jews were
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; not Jews, i.e. the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Herodians.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Satan, you're a liar.

&gt;&gt; Nope.

&gt;&gt; You are the liar of Satan.

&gt;&gt; Jesus, Paul, and John all identified who they were talking about--the

He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be
his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for
ever.

Ezekiel 44:9
Thus saith the Lord God; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor
uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that
is among the children of Israel.

Ezekiel 44:23-24
And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and
profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean. [24]
And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall judge it
according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in
all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.

His,

LOL

Idiot: David never built a &quot;tabernacle&quot;--Solomon did. Furthermore, God built
HIS tabernacle THROUGH David, and that Tabernacle IS JESUS.

But you idiotic Pharisees do always read the figurative literally, which was
why you were confused at Jesus' first advent, and you'll be even more
confused at His second.

">

This is your biggest lie of the bunch. This is not an &quot;end-time&quot; prophecy,
idiot--it was a statement about what God was doing RIGHT THEN!

Simeon KNEW that the CHURCH was the &quot;tabernacle,&quot; as he spoke of the raising
up of David's tabernacle as being PRESENT TENSE, not future tense, idiot.

Ac 15:14-20
Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to
take out of them a people for his name.
And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, After
this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is
fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles,
upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.
Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the
Gentiles are turned to God: But that we write unto them, that they abstain
from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled,
and from blood.

THE CHURCH is the restoration of David's tabernacle, and the process will
continue until ALL ISRAEL is named, raised, and sorted out, and named again.

Thus, Jesus says...

Jn 4:21-24
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall
neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is
of the Jews.
But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship
the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship
him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit
and in truth.

It's ALLEGORY, not literal, idiot.

But, as usual, you ignore CONTEXT to take a verse and make it say what it
doesn't say, turning allegory into literalism, and THAT'S how you sons of
the Devil will get the WHOLE WORLD into trouble in the End of the Age.

Fanatic's Fare for the Common Man

Certainty level: 90%

The article reproduced below was penned by Bernard Levin
for the Features section of the Times on 21 September 1991. To my mind, it
described the situation at the time and in particular a recent meeting with
a friend, during which I for the first time admitted to someone other than
my GP that I had been subjected to a conspiracy of harassment over the
previous year and a half.

There is a madman running loose about London, called David Campbell; I have
no reason to believe that he is violent, but he should certainly be
approached with caution. You may know him by the curious glitter in his
eyes and a persistent trembling of his hands; if that does not suffice, you
will find him attempting to thrust no fewer than 48 books into your arms,
all hardbacks, with a promise that, if you should return to the same
meeting-place next year, he will heave another 80 at you.

If, by now, the police have arrived and are keeping a close watch on him,
you may feel sufficiently emboldened to examine the books. The jackets are
a model of uncluttered typography, elegantly and simply laid out; there is
an unobtrusive colophon of a rising sun, probably not picked at random.
Gaining confidence - the lunatic is smiling by now, and the policemen, who
know about such things, have significantly removed their helmets - you
could do worse than take the jacket off the first book in the pile. The
only word possible to describe the binding is sumptuous; real cloth in a
glorious shade of dark green, with the title and author in black and gold
on the spine.

Look at it more closely; your eyes do not deceive you - it truly does have
real top-bands and tail-bands, in yellow, and, for good measure, a silk
marker ribbon in a lighter green. The paper is cream-wove and acid-free,
and the book is sewn, not glued.

Throughout the encounter, I should have mentioned, our loony has been
chattering away, although what he is trying to say is almost impossible to
understand; after a time, however, he becomes sufficiently coherent to make
clear that he is trying to sell the books to you. Well, now, such quality
in bookmaking today can only be for collectors' limited editions at a
fearsome price - £30, £40, £50?

No, no, he says, the glitter more powerful than ever and the trembling of
his hands rapidly spreading throughout his entire body; no, no - the books
are priced variously at £7, £8 or £9, with the top price £12.

At this, the policemen understandably put their helmets back on; one of
them draws his truncheon and the other can be heard summoning
reinforcements on his walkie-talkie. The madman bursts into tears, and
swears it is all true.

And it is.

David Campbell has acquired the entire rights to the whole of the
Everyman's Library, which died a lingering and shameful death a decade or
so ago, and he proposes to start it all over again - 48 volumes this
September and 80 more next year, in editions I have described, at the
prices specified. He proposes to launch his amazing venture simultaneously
in Britain and the United States, with the massive firepower of Random
Century at his back in this country, and the dashing cavalry of Knopf
across the water, and no one who loves literature and courage will forbear
to cheer.

At the time this article was written I had believed for some time that
columnists in the Times and other journalists had been making references to
my situation. Nothing unusual about this you may think, plenty of people
have the same sort of ideas and obviously the papers aren't writing about
them, so why should my beliefs not be as false as those of others?

What makes this article so extraordinary is that three or four days
immediately preceding its publication, I had a meeting with a friend,
during the course of which we discussed the media persecution, and in
particular that by Times columnists. It seemed to me, reading the article
by Levin in Saturday's paper, that he was describing in some detail his
&quot;artist's impression&quot; of that meeting. Most telling are the final
sentences, when he writes, &quot;The madman bursts into tears, and swears it is
all true. And it is.&quot; Although I did not &quot;burst into tears&quot; (he seems to be
using a bit of poetic licence and exaggerating) I did try hard to convince
my friend that it was all true; and I am able to concur with Mr Levin,
because, of course, it is.

At the beginning of the piece Levin reveals a fear of being attacked by the
&quot;irrational&quot; subject of his story, saying &quot;I have no reason to believe that
he is violent, but he should certainly be approached with caution&quot;. This
goes back to the xenophobic propaganda of &quot;defence&quot; against a &quot;threat&quot;
which was seen at the very beginning of the harassment. The impression of a
&quot;madman running loose&quot; who needs to be controlled through an agency which
assigns to itself the mantle of the &quot;police&quot; is also one which had been
expressed elsewhere.

In the final paragraph of this extract, his reference to Everyman's Library
as having &quot;died a lingering and shameful death a decade or so ago&quot; shows
clearly what sort of conclusion they wish to their campaign. They want a
permanent solution, and as they are prevented from achieving that solution
directly, they waste significant resources on methods which have been
repeatedly shown to be ineffective for such a purpose.

Private Eye, 23 Oct 1992

Certainty level: 25%

I'm not really sure whether this cover was intended to get at me,
or whether it was re-interpreted after publication to be about me.
This issue of Private Eye came out in October 1992, by which time I had
been under severe continuous pressure at work and from the general
population in Oxford for many months. It had John Major saying to his
wife, &quot;Come back, Norma!&quot; under the title &quot;Major's support lowest ever&quot;.

There's a story behind this. In late October I was in the local pub
(the Rose and Crown, nice traditional name eh) with two people from
work, Simon and Phil. Phil had with him a copy of the current Private
Eye. These are both &quot;nice people&quot; and on my side, I hasten to add.
Simon pointed out the message on the magazine's cover to Phil, and asked
&quot;what do you think about that&quot;. Phil answered, &quot;Well usually they
[Private Eye] get it right&quot;. This exchange happened in front of me.
Although I was ill at the time (this was before I'd started taking
medicines) I hadn't read anything into the Eye cover until these guys
pointed it out to me.

Sometime later, again in the same road, a student shouted to
one of his friends, &quot;so when are you COMING BACK?&quot;, again in front
of me.

What I realised Phil thought it meant was a double-entendre, the
&quot;coming&quot; referring to the act of ejaculation, the &quot;back&quot; referring
to the human back-side. So in a play on words you get a person who
is referred to as a back-side ejaculating. Charming.

Of course, Phil could have been wrong. Perhaps there was no such meaning
intended by Private Eye. Perhaps he saw meaning which wasn't there.
Perhaps the moon is made from green cheese. Who knows?

Victor Lewis-Smith

Certainty level: 10%

Victor Lewis-Smith has issued a denial through his webmaster
John Hayward-Warburton regarding this article; he says quite categorically
it's not written about me. I kind-of sort-of believe him, but I think
the conspiracy is so wide that the phrase &quot;Eventually, I had to leave
because they were all trying to kill me&quot; could have been intended to be
as if from any paranoid person, but could have been influenced by my
case in the particular. So the influence could have been sort-of
subconscious.

This article is from the Evening Standard of Thursday May 8, 1997.
It is titled &quot;Goon, and best forgotten&quot; and may be found on page 31.

I think VLS has written/produced stuff specifically about me in the past,
both in his Evening Standard column, one of which is reproduced below
(in another case, he was talking about computer hacking, and I think that
was directed at me), and a television programme in around late 1993
when he has a taxi driver who says &quot;they're all trying to kill me guv&quot;
and VLS responds &quot;you're supposed to be quite intelligent aren't you&quot;.

However, his webmaster has issued a formal denial on his behalf, so it
is not for me to oppose what he has stated categorically.

=========================================================================== ===

== 1 of 1 ==

From: guardian Snow

This is my theory, that self proclaimed Apostle Paul fits the prophesy
of Lucifer as recorded in the book of Isaiah.  I'm putting this
forward for critical review and would like evidence that shows I'm
wrong.  For my personal acceptance, please understand that Paul's
claims to visions recorded by Luke are not evidence. I realize that
the vast majority of people believe otherwise but I'm putting this
forward because I want to see if anybody can give other evidence.

Isa 14:1  For the LORD will have compassion on Jacob, and will yet
choose Israel, and set them in their own land; and the stranger shall
join himself with them, and they shall cleave to the house of Jacob.

Now we see the chapter is beginning talking about gentiles joining
with the house of Jacob.

Isa 14:2  And the peoples shall take them, and bring them to their
place; and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the
LORD for servants and for handmaids; and they shall take them captive,
whose captives they were; and they shall rule over their oppressors.

The Gentiles become servants in Israel.

Isa 14:3  And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall
give thee rest from thy travail, and from thy trouble, and from the
hard service wherein thou wast made to serve,
Isa 14:4  that thou shalt take up this parable against the king of
Babylon, and say: How hath the oppressor ceased! the exactress of gold
ceased!

Now the king of Babylon I see as a reference to the leader of the
church of Babylon.

Isa 14:5  The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, the sceptre of
the rulers,

Now this is interesting because a &quot;staff&quot; is used to guide sheep.  So
the staff of the wicked must in fact be something that leads the sheep
to wickedness.

Isa 14:6  That smote the peoples in wrath with an incessant stroke,
that ruled the nations in anger, with a persecution that none
restrained.

The &quot;persecution that none restrained&quot; is in my opinion because people
don't understand that Paul is Lucifer. Nobody would restrain somebody
they believed to be good.

Isa 14:7  The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet; they break forth
into singing.
Isa 14:8  Yea, the cypresses rejoice at thee, and the cedars of
Lebanon: 'Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.'

Lebanon is the location of Damascus and the synagogue of the
Libertines (Acts 6:9). It is the same spot where we see the
introduction of Saul stoning the disciple Stephen. It brought to mind
this parallel in Jeremiah.

Jer 22:22  The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall
go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded
for all thy wickedness.
Jer 22:23  O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the
cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain
as of a woman in travail!

Isa 14:9  Sheol beneath is stirred up to meet you when you come; it
rouses the shades to greet you,

Now when Paul was canonized into scriptures, he was long dead!

all who were leaders of the earth; it raises from their thrones all
who were kings of the nations.

Isa 14:10  All of them will answer and say to you: 'You too have
become as weak as we! You have become like us!'

All the kings begin to ask this question and I would say due to lack
of moral standards, &quot;have you become secular and worldly?&quot; might be
another way of saying this.

Isa 14:11  Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, the sound of your
harps; maggots are laid as a bed beneath you, and worms are your
covers.
Isa 14:12  &quot;How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of Dawn!
How you are cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low!

Lucifer or Day Star, weakens many nations and this would fit with
moral corruption of the commandments of Elohim

Isa 14:13  You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to heaven;
2Co 11:10  As the truth of Christ is in me,
2Co 12:9  ...that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

above the stars of God I will set my throne on high;
1Ti 5:21  In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect
angels (I charge you to keep these rules) without prejudging, doing
nothing from partiality.

I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far reaches of the north;
It's important to note that All of Paul's Assemblies were to the north
of Jerusalem.
Eph 2:6  And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in
heavenly places in Christ Jesus:

Isa 14:14  I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;
1Th 4:17  Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up
together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so
we will always be with the Lord.

I will make myself like the Most High.'
1Co 3:10  According to the grace of God which is given unto me
Gal 1:24  And they glorified God in me.
Gal 2:20  I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I,
but Christ liveth in me:..
Gal 4:14  And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor
rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
Col 1:25  Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation
of God which is given to me for you,...

Isa 14:15  But you are brought down to Sheol, to the far reaches of
the pit.
Isa 14:16  Those who see you will stare at you and ponder over you:
'Is this the man who made the earth tremble, who shook kingdoms,
We see in verse 16 that Lucifer is in fact a man. Probably they stare
and ponder because of the surprise of it being Saul.

Isa 14:17  who made the world like a desert and overthrew its cities,
who did not let his prisoners go home?'

We see that prisoners are people that sit in the shadow of darkness
and death,  Prisoners of sin.
Psa 107:10  Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners
in affliction and in irons,

Isa 14:18  All the kings of the nations lie in glory, each in his own
tomb;
Isa 14:19  but you are cast out, away from your grave,
Paul was brought out of his grave by having his work canonized in the
scriptures and his words live today as his gospel.

like a loathed branch,

A loathed branch probably because it's been fixed in scriptures and we
must find the many examples about trees:
Luk 3:9  Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every
tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown
into the fire.&quot;

...clothed with the slain, those pierced by the sword, who go down to
the stones of the pit, like a dead body trampled underfoot.
Isa 14:20  You will not be joined with them in burial, because you
have destroyed your land, you have slain your people. &quot;May the
offspring of evildoers nevermore be named!
We never knew if or who Paul's &quot;offspring&quot; was.  This in fact helps to
show that it is not Nebuchadnezzar because Daniel names his son.

Isa 14:21  Prepare slaughter for his sons because of the guilt of
their fathers, lest they rise and possess the earth, and fill the face
of the world with cities.&quot;
Isa 14:22  &quot;I will rise up against them,&quot; declares the LORD of hosts,
&quot;and will cut off from Babylon name and remnant, descendants and
posterity,&quot; declares the LORD.
This passage also makes it clear it is a future event because it's
speaking of Babylon and the Saints, also known as the remnant.
Rev 17:5  And on her forehead was written a name of mystery: &quot;Babylon
the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth's abominations.&quot;

Isa 14:23  &quot;And I will make it a possession of the hedgehog, and pools
of water, and I will sweep it with the broom of destruction,&quot; declares
the LORD of hosts.
Isa 14:24  The LORD of hosts has sworn: &quot;As I have planned, so shall
it be, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand,
Isa 14:25  that I will break the Assyrian in my land, and on my
mountains trample him underfoot; and his yoke shall depart from them,
and his burden from their shoulder.&quot;
Assyrian country was where Tarsus was located and the birthplace of
Saul/Paul.  When we consider this passage we must understand that his
&quot;yoke&quot; and his &quot;burden&quot; are placed on the followers and not that of
Elohim's. This false yoke is that of a false belief and a the burden
of conflicting scriptures that divide the true churches of the Messiah
Yeshua.

Isa 14:26  This is the purpose that is purposed concerning the whole
earth, and this is the hand that is stretched out over all the
nations.
Notice also that it effect the &quot;whole earth&quot; and this is also proof it
is a modern day living prophesy.  To me, this passage seals it that
the Assyrian is Paul whose false burden effects the whole earth by
being in the #1 best selling book in world history, the bible.

Isa 14:27  For the LORD of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it?
His hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back?
Isa 14:28  In the year that King Ahaz died came this oracle:
Isa 14:29  Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of you, that the rod that
struck you is broken, for from the serpent's root will come forth an
adder, and its fruit will be a flying fiery serpent.
Isa 14:30  And the firstborn of the poor will graze, and the needy lie
down in safety; but I will kill your root with famine, and your
remnant it will slay.
Isa 14:31  Wail, O gate; cry out, O city; melt in fear, O Philistia,
all of you! For smoke comes out of the north, and there is no
straggler in his ranks.
Isa 14:32  What will one answer the messengers of the nation? &quot;The
LORD has founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of his people find
refuge.&quot;

I also found it interesting this mention of the &quot;messengers of the
nations&quot;. It seems to be speaking of the scriptures to me. So, that's
why I came to that opinion and I'd like to see somebody find a reason
to show me I could be wrong outside of &quot;he's an apostle&quot;.

With respect,

Snow

A man who was completely innocent, offered himself as a sacrifice for
the good of others, including his enemies, and became the ransom of
the world. It was a perfect act. I like your Christ, I do not like
your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.

&gt;&gt; aspect of who Jesus is.

&gt; Nope!

&gt; Mathew and Luke are dependent upon Mark's gospel from which they pinch
&gt; most of their material.  John also depends largely upon Mark's gospel
&gt; along wioth his own ideas.

&gt; These are NOT four independent historical accounts but ONE GOSPEL (i.e.
&gt; PROPAGANDA written to demonstrate Jesus as the messiah) added to by each
&gt; successive gospel writer.
">

Oh, it's true that Mark was the baseline for Luke, which in turn became the
baseline for Matthew, but only because each author didn't want to reinvent
the wheel.

Mark's Gospel came from the testimony of Peter, as Mark was Peter's scribe
(which also accounts for the differences between I and II Peter).

But Mark's Gospel was unfinished, as he joined matters with Luke and Paul,
who added the testimony of additional witnesses.

Matthew, who had fled to Egypt under the persecutions of Herod Agrippa II,
in preparing a version of the Gospel's for the Hebrews, first compiled Mark
and Luke's Gospels in Greek (creating many couplets and doublets along the
way), while adding his own recollections to the story. However, his Aramaic
Gospel was either immediately destroyed by the Jews, or lost to antiquity.

John's Gospel was written after his Revelation experience, and John,
familiar with Matthew's Gospel, saw need to approach the problem from the
spiritual and prophetic perspectives based on the duality and triunism of
prophecy established in the Old Covenant prophets.

Thus, the prophets spoke, the teachers taught, and the legitimate books were
written as Jesus said they would be, from the moment He said it to the death
of the last man standing after the temple was destroyed, John.

Mt 23:34-35
Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes:
and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye
scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: That upon
you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of
righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew
between the temple and the altar.
Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.

Interaction with the universe.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

No it's not. It's the result of the mind and the body, and also the
precursor to the mind and body.

However, that level of intelligence is beyond you.

Wrong.

Spirit has more to do with ACTIVITY than thought OR emotion.

One gains spiritual experiences, both thetic and antithetic.

The mind thinks, based on prior spiritual experiences.

The body carries out the thought, further contributing to the spiritual
reality.

It all comes from spirit, and proceeds to spirit.

Nope.

The Bible specifically separates body, soul, and spirit.

You keep making the mistake of reading &quot;spirit&quot; as &quot;thought&quot; or &quot;mind.&quot;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Only the ones who didn't know what they were talking about.

And if Descartes was the one who began Western philosophy, he has an
eternity in hell coming to him for creating the Great and Terrible beast of
Western Society, which tries to be legalistic, liberal, and humanistic at
the same time, establishing its ongoing confusion.

And from hence cometh Babylon, which, quite frankly, sucks.

&gt; &gt;&gt; [snip]

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As this &quot;I am&quot; is a common term - there is nothing in the use of the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; term
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; indicate this had anything to do with the most high.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Rationalized bullshit.

&gt; &gt;&gt; The point of the conversation is loaded into the Jews' question: &quot;You are
&gt; &gt;&gt; not yet fifty years old and you have seen Abraham?&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; Jesus had seen Abraham in his day (which occurred before Jesus was even
&gt; &gt;&gt; born), and Abraham had seen Jesus in His Day (which is yet to occur,
&gt; &gt;&gt; though
&gt; &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke of Abraham seeing it past tense, even though the resurrection
&gt; &gt;&gt; hasn't occurred yet).

&gt; &gt;&gt; All this is part and parcel of the nature of three-dimensional time, i.e.
&gt; &gt;&gt; time in a line (Beginning and Ending), time in cycles (first and last),
&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt; &gt;&gt; non-linear access to time (Alpha and Omega).

&gt; &gt;&gt; This was no &quot;common term&quot; by any stretch of the imagination.

&gt; &gt; You think wonderfully, and you express yourself beautifully.  But I
&gt; &gt; wonder that you do not address your audience with the love about which
&gt; &gt; you write so eloquently?

&gt; You mean, like Jesus did when confronting the Pharisees, Sadducees, and
&gt; Herodians?
">

Yes, I mean that.  When Jesus confronted those people directly, he did
not call them &quot;moron&quot; or verbally assault them.  In John 8, he strove
to tell people the exact truth.

The more vivid examples, like Matthew 23, are addressed to third
parties.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or as Paul did when confronting the Corinthians, Cretans, homosexuals, etc.?
">

I do not know those passages.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Contrary to the mamby-pamby, warm-fuzzy, re-imaged &quot;nice guy&quot; Jesus preached

Calling a usenet poster &quot;moron&quot; is not a refusal to mince words.  It
is a falsehood in its own right.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; birth.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A christian discussing how he is condemning another - and thus

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; changed.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Typical.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Moron: Before one can get to the problem with the details, one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; get
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the problem with the speaker, and the problem with the speaker
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; he
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a Laodicean who must, of necessity, reduce Jesus' stature, and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; take
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jesus
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; down off the Throne of His Godly Kingdom, so that the beast can
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; advance
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; private agenda at the expense of Christ's divinity.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; So you can't even have a discussion of the transitional meaning
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; word
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for &quot;virgin&quot; until you get past Mark's bullshit agenda.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Oh, and the term 'almah means &quot;virgin,&quot; whoever, the prophecy
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; didn't
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; say
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that the &quot;virgin&quot; had to conceive miraculously.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the difference between the defective iteration in
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Isaiah's
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; day,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the perfect iteration in Jesus' day.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In Isaiah's day, two children where born whose days marked the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; time
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; until
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Israel was forsaken of both her kings,&quot; Emmanuel (to represent
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Judah)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Maher-Shalal-Heshbaz (to represent Israel).

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That the &quot;virgin&quot; had to these two children by normal sex in the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; first
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; iteration (which was necessarily defective, as it was temporal)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to do with the fact that, in the second iteration, the perfect
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; virgin,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mary,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was a virgin until AFTER Jesus was born, when Joseph &quot;knew&quot; her.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ike

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Now the question I asked - is this a sign?

shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no
faith.
They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have
provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy
with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a
foolish nation.
For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest
hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the
foundations of the mountains. I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend
mine arrows upon them. They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with
burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of
beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. The sword
without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin,
the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.

And again...

Isa 65:1 ¶ I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them
that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was not
called by my name.

Ac 18:5-6
And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed
in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ.
And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment,
and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from
henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.

Thus, it is now OUR way as given by God, not your way as incited by Satan,
Pharisee.

TOPIC: MI5 Persecution: Introduction to Sent Faxes (536)

=========================================================================== ===

Introduction to the Sent Faxes webpages

Between 1998 and April/2000 I sent some thirty articles on the subject of the MI5 Persecution to
British politicians, media, legal and diplomatic entities in the UK. Of those articles 24 are reproduced
on this part of the website. They were originally composed as Microsoft Word documents, and saved to HTML
form for publication here. A few of them were slightly edited in format for readability.

You will see that these articles cover quite comprehensively what has been going on since 1990, there being
quite a lot of material to cover, since it is a rare week that goes by without MI5 making some harassing
or threatening action against me. &quot;How could it be True?&quot;... they use the mental illness which they induced
in me as a ready explanation for my complaints. Who started it, why did it start, why it continues...
these faxed articles provide examination in more depth of the treatment in the Frequently Asked Questions webpages.
The sheer meaninglessness of the Secret Police actions is highlighted; their operatives make their livelihoods
by cynically exploiting the taxpayers, when in a more responsible country they would be looking at the inside of
prison cells.

The validity of this observation is proven by their reaction to my several suggestions in the articles that I
would cease sending faxes if MI5's agents (and it's always the same people doing the persecution) desisted from
continually harassing me. A number of times, you will see in the faxed articles, I have suggested that
we come to a &quot;peace of mind agreement&quot; where I cease complaining and they cease harassing. On one occasion,
I wrote to Hugh S.-W., the director of OCTS where I was employed in 1992-94 and who is aware of the
circumstances, asking that he intercede to bring this matter to a close, by initiating a meeting between
myself and the persecutors to mutually settle our differences; he didn't reply, but MI5 did
soon after - they said &quot;This is what you wanted, wasn't it?,  some sort of confrontation?&quot;.
The reality is the people stalking me are not interested in any settlement; for them crime pays, and
pays handsomely; moreover it is State-approved crime; the Police will never investigate or take action;
it is corruption on an incredible level and scale, and it has gone on for over a decade.

You will see that the articles contain three elements; firstly, there are original written articles,
many in the first half of 1999 when I was writing new articles every week and sending them by email and
fax during the weekend; then there are &quot;MI5 Persecution Update&quot; articles, which list happenings recent to
a particular transmission; and finally there is the &quot;old faithful&quot; Frequently Asked Questions article
which was sent on a few occasions during the three year period. These articles generated a number of
interesting responses from politicians and other recipients, many of which are documented in the
&quot;received faxes&quot; area of these webpages.

I hope you enjoy reading these articles. I'm not as angry as these articles necessarily make out,
only sometimes, usually soon after the persecutors have said something unpleasant at me; the purpose
of putting lots of fire and ire into the mix is to try to chuck it into the public domain which might
lead to MI5 being forced to curb their actions. Unfortunately that aim was not achieved, despite
many, many thousands of faxes being sent. Also, if any policemen are reading this, then I'm (a bit) sorry
about the rude things I said about &quot;the Bill&quot; in one or two of the articles; the police have never done me
any harm (yet) by commission, only by omission of doing anything to investigate my complaints or treat
them seriously.

Faxes Sent to British Diplomatic/Legal logs

During the 1998-2000 period my records indicate that I sent at least 3,642 faxes to diplomatic and legal offices
located in the British isles, of which 3,345 went via TPC's email-to-fax service and 297 were sent via fax-modem
direct from my computer. The actual figure is somewhat higher since, for most of this period, whenever a recipient
asked to be deleted from my mailing list, I totally wiped all entries including that from the logfile.

In the records &quot;Y&quot; indicates successful transmission from fax-modem, &quot;N&quot; indicates failed transmission from fax-modem.
&quot;E&quot; indicates an error occurred while transmitting via fax-modem and a fax may have been only partly transmitted.
&quot;y&quot; and &quot;n&quot; indicate success or failure via TPC.

In April 2000 I changed the method of operation by recording &quot;R&quot; when a recipient requested removal, rather than
wiping their details from my mailing list and records; and keeping &quot;B&quot; records for when TPC actioned a ban on a
recipient's fax-number, but the recipient did not write to ask me to cease faxing. The purpose of these changes
was to keep more accurate and complete records, but the intention was thwarted by the police complaint.
