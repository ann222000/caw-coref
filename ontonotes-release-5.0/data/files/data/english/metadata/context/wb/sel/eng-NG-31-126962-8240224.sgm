&gt; Source: Wikipedia

&gt; On the Internet, baiting is similar to trolling, in that
&gt; baiters, like trolls, try to elicit a response from other
&gt; users. The difference is that the response is supposed to
&gt; be embarrassing to the user in question, and humorous to
&gt; others. Baiters frequently concentrate on groups they do
&gt; not like, such as pedophiles, fraudsters (often 419
&gt; fraudsters), religious fundamentalists, or homosexuals.
&gt; What the baiter says does not need to make sense, it is
&gt; often simply written to baffle the bait, and to produce an
&gt; interesting result. In that respect, baiting is similar to
&gt; telephone prank calls, but often much more elaborate. In
&gt; the United States, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 makes
&gt; some prank calls a felony with penalties of up to two years
&gt; in prison, and possible fines (depending on severity).
&gt; However, such penalties are rarely carried out.

&gt; Like prank calls, baiting is illegal in most jurisdictions
&gt; as it is a form of targeted abuse or harassment. On IRC or
&gt; instant messaging this can take the form of a denial of
&gt; service attack and is frequently coupled with otherwise
&gt; illegal practices such a flooding or ping bombing. For
&gt; example a baiter may join an IRC chat channel dedicated to
&gt; gay rights. By baiting the chatters or ops, the baiter
&gt; dominates the venue creating a hostile environment for the
&gt; other users of the IRC service. by concentrating on certain
&gt; groups the baiter focuses his or her hostility in order to
&gt; harass members of that group. When members of this
&gt; community attempt to regain control of the venue the baiter
&gt; will sometimes resort to DoS attacks in order to escalate
&gt; the issue. Frequently chat logs are then typically posted
&gt; on the world wide web in order to humiliate specific
&gt; members of the community.

&gt; On Internet forums, baiting is sometimes used in attempts
&gt; to empty forums or reduce a forum's usage. This type of
&gt; baiting is usually done to make the atmosphere of a forum
&gt; appear unpleasant or to make forum owners, moderators and
&gt; long-time users look foolish. A person using this kind of
&gt; baiting may post comments to elicit rude responses from
&gt; prominent members of a forum, thus making the responding
&gt; member or members appear as trolls or flamers to
&gt; bystanders. As a result, forum users in general may become
&gt; disgusted and leave the forum.
