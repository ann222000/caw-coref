*31 October 2007, Wednesday*

*Praise The Lord!!**

**

Start with four steps*

1. Come as you are right now to the Lord.  Tell him all your feelings,( be
it joy, anger, hate, jealousy, feelings of insecurity,ego, etc ) -
everything -    from the core of your heart.
2. Hand over to the  Lord  the blockages that hinder your path to his Holy
anointing - things you want to change but have no power to change.
3. Surrender your life to the Lord - not by mere words, but from the depths
of your soul - give Him the complete control of your life.
4.  Wait in  silent communion with the Lord in that state of surrender and
the Lord will speak to you and  you will be filled with the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;
*John 1:9 - If we confess our sins, he {God} is faithful and just to forgive
us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness*

*Reading 1*
*Romans 8:26-30* &lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/romans/romans8.htm#v26 &gt;

Brothers and sisters:
The Spirit comes to the aid of our weakness;
for we do not know how to pray as we ought,
but the Spirit himself intercedes with inexpressible groanings.
And the one who searches hearts
knows what is the intention of the Spirit,
because he intercedes for the holy ones
according to God's will.

We know that all things work for good for those who love God,
who are called according to his purpose.
For those he foreknew he also predestined
to be conformed to the image of his Son,
so that he might be the firstborn
among many brothers.
And those he predestined he also called;
and those he called he also justified;
and those he justified he also glorified.

*Responsorial Psalm*
*Ps 13:4-5, 6* &lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/psalms/psalm13.htm#v4 &gt;

*R. (6a) My hope, O Lord, is in your mercy.
*Look, answer me, O LORD, my God!
Give light to my eyes that I may not sleep in death
lest my enemy say, &quot;I have overcome him&quot;;
lest my foes rejoice at my downfall.
*R. All my hope, O Lord, is in your loving kindness.
*Though I trusted in your mercy,
Let my heart rejoice in your salvation;
let me sing of the LORD, &quot;He has been good to me.&quot;
*R. All my hope, O Lord, is in your loving kindness.*

*Gospel*
*Luke 13:22-30* &lt; http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/luke/luke13.htm#v22 &gt;

Jesus passed through towns and villages,
teaching as he went and making his way to Jerusalem.
Someone asked him,
&quot;Lord, will only a few people be saved?&quot;
He answered them,
&quot;Strive to enter through the narrow gate,
for many, I tell you, will attempt to enter
but will not be strong enough.
After the master of the house has arisen and locked the door,
then will you stand outside knocking and saying,
'Lord, open the door for us.'
He will say to you in reply,
'I do not know where you are from.'
And you will say,
'We ate and drank in your company and you taught in our streets.'
Then he will say to you,
'I do not know where you are from.
Depart from me, all you evildoers!'
And there will be wailing and grinding of teeth
when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God
and you yourselves cast out.
And people will come from the east and the west
and from the north and the south
and will recline at table in the Kingdom of God.
For behold, some are last who will be first,
and some are first who will be last.&quot;
*1 John 2:1-2*
My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin.  But if
anybody does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense- Jesus
Christ, the Righteous One.  He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and
not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.

*Come and experience the powerful presence of the Lord Jesus  today at St.
Peter's College Hall  6 p.m. onwards. &quot;Come as you are, God loves you any
way&quot;*

*Happy Birthday &amp; Happy Anniversery for those who are celebrating.*

*Grace, mercy and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord be
with You*
