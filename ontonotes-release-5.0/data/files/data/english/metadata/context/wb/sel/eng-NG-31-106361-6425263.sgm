A new diagnosis for childhood trauma?
Some push for a new DSM category for children who undergo multiple,
complex traumas.

Many children traverse the terrain of childhood with few major upsets.
But an unfortunate number face the opposite fate, suffering repeated
and often serious traumas-everything from abuse and neglect to
persistent community violence to caregivers impaired by illness,
alcohol or depression. No one knows how many children are affected,
but one gauge is the number of children reported annually to child
protection services for abuse and neglect-3 million. About 1 million
of those cases are substantiated, according to a 2003 report by the
Administration on Children, Youth and Families.

Yet no one diagnosis adequately captures the plight of these
youngsters, and that's why a new diagnosis is needed for them, asserts
a working group of child psychiatrists and psychologists developing
such a diagnosis for possible inclusion in the 2011 iteration of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the DSM-5,
published by the American Psychiatric Association. As it stands now,
these children are often misdiagnosed and incorrectly treated, working
group members argue. The team is an interest group of the National
Child Traumatic Stress Network, a consortium of 70 child mental health
centers founded and funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration that brings together clinicians who work with
children who have complex trauma histories.

To fill the gap, the group is proposing a diagnosis called
"developmental trauma disorder" or DTD, to capture what members see as
central realities of life for these children: exposure to multiple,
chronic traumas, usually of an interpersonal nature; a unique set of
symptoms that differs from those of post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) and a variety of other labels often applied to such children
(see "Current trauma diagnoses"); and the fact that these traumas
affect children differently depending on their stage of development.

"While PTSD is a good definition for acute trauma in adults, it
doesn't apply well to children, who are often traumatized in the
context of relationships," says Boston University Medical Center
psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, MD, one of the group's co-leaders.
"Because children's brains are still developing, trauma has a much
more pervasive and long-range influence on their self-concept, on
their sense of the world and on their ability to regulate themselves."

The 10-member group has been meeting since 2005, gathering relevant
research, hashing out possible criteria and devising a strategy for
getting the diagnosis to a rigorous enough place to be considered.
They admit they have much work ahead before that happens, given the
labor involved in gathering case materials, developing instruments and
testing those instruments in the field for validation.

But they are committed to the task because they believe state mental
health systems currently flounder on treatment plans for these
children because they lack an accurate framework for understanding
their problems.

"We think DTD has a strong scientific basis to it," says University of
California Los Angeles child expert Robert Pynoos, MD, co-director of
the trauma network and co-leader of the working group. "But it also
has a common-sense resonance with community mental health workers and
with families who are looking for a proper understanding of their
troubled child or teenager. If we could introduce a rigorous diagnosis
like this, it could have a significant impact on thousands of
children."

Building a case

To make its case that science supports the DTD diagnosis, the group is
examining large databases of children who can help inform the
potential diagnosis. For example, members of the child trauma network,
which sees up to 50,000 children per year, are building a core data
set where they're finding out not only what kind of traumas children
have experienced, but when they occurred and for how long. The group
also is tracking a 20-year longitudinal study of 4,000 Australian
child survivors of natural disasters that includes life-history
questions. The team will look at differences between children who
report interpersonal traumas and those who don't, van der Kolk notes.

In addition, the team is drawing from the attachment, developmental
and interpersonal trauma literature, says University of Connecticut
psychologist Julian Ford, PhD, a group member and an affiliate of APA
Divs. 12 (Clinical) and 56 (Trauma). Ford outlines some of this
research in a paper in the May 2005 Psychiatric Annals (Vol. 35, No.
5, pages 410-419).

The team is considering two research streams, Ford says. One finds
that children who experience interpersonal trauma show a disrupted
ability to regulate their emotions, behavior and attention. For
instance, studies show that when caregiving in animals is disrupted or
withdrawn, they become anxious and highly reactive to stressors, and
when they are older, are less likely to explore their environments,
Ford notes.

The other research area shows that much of children's later ability to
think clearly and solve problems in a calm, non-impulsive way stems
from their experiences in the first five to seven years of life. A
case in point is an ongoing retrospective study of 17,337 adult
managed-care users funded by Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, cited by van der Kolk in the May 2005
Psychiatric Annals (pages 401-408). It found a highly significant
relationship between reported traumatic childhood experiences such as
sexual and physical abuse, and later episodes of depression, suicide
attempts, alcoholism, drug abuse, sexual promiscuity and domestic
violence. It also discovered that the more adverse childhood
experiences a person reports, the more likely he or she is to develop
life-threatening illnesses such as heart disease, cancer and stroke.

In addition, the team is including the latest findings on the
neurobiological consequences of traumatic interpersonal stress. For
instance, studies show that women abused as children who recall
memories of abuse or are confronted with stressful cognitive
challenges have strong reactions in brain areas that signal threat,
but reduced mobilization of brain areas related to focusing attention
and categorizing information, Ford's paper notes.

Finally, the group is piecing together information on how complex
interpersonal trauma can differentially impact each stage of
development, says Pynoos. It also is incorporating the fact that
effects of early trauma can spill over into other stages, even if
those traumas have stopped occurring, he notes.
