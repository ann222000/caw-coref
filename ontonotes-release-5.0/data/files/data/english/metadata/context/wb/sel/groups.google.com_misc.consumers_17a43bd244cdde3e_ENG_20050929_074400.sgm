this country has the biggest social gap in the westernized world - if
you're poor here, you're damned poor! and povertystrick... was just
hypothesizing!

but if he needs some more hints - put plastic sheeting over the doors
and windows - i've seen insurance-poor kids with busted car windows do
that.

&gt;One solution I am presently looking into will be to restrict myself to

&gt;will require shutting off the plumbing in the house to prevent the
&gt;pipes from breaking. I have chosen to remain in my bedroom
&gt;exlusively. I just picked up an old toilet seat and mounted it to a 5
&gt;gallon plastic pail set into a wooden box. This will serve as my
&gt;primary toilet since the bathroom will be unusable without water. I
&gt;have also obtained a box of handi-wipes because I know that I will be
&gt;without a bath or shower all winter, so at least I can wipe my face
&gt;once and awhile. My next projects will be to design a window box that
&gt;will remain outside the one unboarded windows to serve as a
&gt;refrigerator/freezer. I am also designing a trash burning heater that
&gt;will consist of a steel garbage can with a pipe going outside. I am
&gt;collecting all the neighborhood newspaper and other burnable garbage
&gt;and filling my livingroom with this stuff. That will be my only form

&gt;large quantity of candles for light. Without electricity, and with
&gt;all the windows boarded up to retain body heat, there will be a big
&gt;need for a source of light. My other duty will be to fill my car with
&gt;sealed and boxed foods such as crackers. Any foods that do not freeze
&gt;or spoil will be available. Since I have already abandoned my car due
&gt;to the high gas prices, I parked the car right outside my rear door.
&gt;That was I wont have to go far to get something to eat once or twice a
&gt;week. One final note, the piles and piles of old newspapers in my
&gt;livingroom will serve as reading materials throughout the cold winter.
&gt;I will probably sleep as much as possible, but will on occasion need
&gt;something to do. One other thing I am doing is to stock up on old
&gt;clothing and bedding. On the coldest days of winter, I will wrap un

"/> Why should you freeze to death in your own homes, even if you don't
have any heat at all? I remember surviving week-long camping trips
in the middle of a New England winter, with fairly nasty weather
including plenty of snow. No, I didn't spend most of my time
standing around the campfire, either. One these trips had no tents,
and sleeping in 3-foot snow banks. And I actually enjoyed the trips.

I also had vacations in a house out in the woods in Vermont (they
don't even bury people for half the year because the ground is
frozen) with no central heat other than a fireplace, in the winter.
On the same property was a log cabin used by my ancestors without
even a fireplace, and the teenagers (including me at the time) liked
to sleep there to get away from the parents (even if it was only
50 feet away). My ancestors managed somehow, year-round, and I
didn't think it was particularly difficult going without heat. Now,
granted, without the campfire, it's difficult to drink ice (snow
is easier), but I'm assuming that even without heat you still have
something to cook on so you can unfreeze food and water.

Get a good sleeping bag and some good winter clothing. This probably
costs a lot less than what you would spend on heat in a month even
before the &quot;evil Bush&quot; price hikes. Even in my current house, I've
had to go a couple of winter nights with no heat due to a power
failure during a snowstorm. A sleeping bag with blankets over it
in your bed can keep you nice and warm (sometimes even too warm).
Boredom (no Internet, no TV, not a lot of light for reading late
at night) was more of a problem than cold.

I'm not saying it will be pleasant. You can survive it.

Like, uhh.., duhh! You apparently don't have a job, ergo you're a deadbeat
drain on society. It sounds like you suck the government welfare tit and
burden hospitals, social services and your local legal system. If a van
stops by to pick you up on election day, (and the driver offers you a couple
rocks of crack or a Colt 45), you blindly stumble into the voting booth and
pull a straight Democratic ticket.

So what's the net loss to society if you're found in your project hovel next

"/> Keywords: &quot;westernized world.&quot; Which is nothing
compared to the poverty in majority of the world, for
the majority of history.

I have previously lived as a working poor person in the
US, but I don't hold any ongoing grudge, per se. My
negativity on that is mostly about the pervasive
snobbery from the wannabe-middle-class types, along
with incredible leech mentality that I encountered
among other poor people (esp. the NON-working poor
trying to leech off of me.)

Now, I live in a &quot;westernised&quot; country (which is
actually located about as east as you can get. And,
yes, the socioeconomic gap is much less pronounced
here. But that requires me to bend over and get reamed
by the taxman every three months, in order to support
thousands upon thousands of deadbeats, along with
paying the medical and disability costs for all those
morons who can't be bothered take care of their own
bodies.

Even &quot;da projects&quot; (taxpayor-subsidised housing) here
tend to have a large number of satellite teevee dishes
hanging off the windows.

Oh, well, I guess it reduces their incentive to
violently mug me for their smoking/drinking/gambling
budget.

per pete,

there are lots of fatherless children in britain, but they have
national health insurance, and financial support - plus free and
unhindered birth control clinics, etc. you pay all of your working
lives to support each other - just like a family does - a good family
doesn't object taking care of a member, as long as that member is not
greedy and respectfully accepts the care. you can't expect everyone to
do so, but the system, though very expensive, is still in place and
regular people don't want to part with it.

"/> That probably gives them a substantial advantage.

I don't claim any sociological expertise, but it seems to me like if they are
they concentrated to the extent that there just aren't any fathers visible to
any of the children? i.e. if one woman and her children are living in an area
surrounded by families that have a father, that's one thing. But if a thousand
single women and their children are living in one area, that's another situation
altogether.

Put another way, it's different whether having a father is the community norm or
being fatherless is the community norm.

When there aren't any men around to keep the post-puberty male children in line,
they run amok. Witness the &quot;cowboy&quot; phenomenon in Viet Nam when the
government took all the military-age males away from the villages.

&gt; One solution I am presently looking into will be to restrict myself to
&gt; one room in my home, and leave the rest of the home unheated. This
&gt; will require shutting off the plumbing in the house to prevent the
&gt; pipes from breaking. I have chosen to remain in my bedroom
&gt; exlusively. I just picked up an old toilet seat and mounted it to a 5
&gt; gallon plastic pail set into a wooden box. This will serve as my
&gt; primary toilet since the bathroom will be unusable without water. I
&gt; have also obtained a box of handi-wipes because I know that I will be
&gt; without a bath or shower all winter, so at least I can wipe my face
&gt; once and awhile. My next projects will be to design a window box that
&gt; will remain outside the one unboarded windows to serve as a
&gt; refrigerator/freezer. I am also designing a trash burning heater that
&gt; will consist of a steel garbage can with a pipe going outside. I am
&gt; collecting all the neighborhood newspaper and other burnable garbage
&gt; and filling my livingroom with this stuff. That will be my only form
&gt; of heat. I am also geting a large metal pail to melt snow on this
&gt; homemade heater for fresh drinking water. My big purchase will be a
&gt; large quantity of candles for light. Without electricity, and with
&gt; all the windows boarded up to retain body heat, there will be a big
&gt; need for a source of light. My other duty will be to fill my car with
&gt; sealed and boxed foods such as crackers. Any foods that do not freeze
&gt; or spoil will be available. Since I have already abandoned my car due
&gt; to the high gas prices, I parked the car right outside my rear door.
&gt; That was I wont have to go far to get something to eat once or twice a
&gt; week. One final note, the piles and piles of old newspapers in my
&gt; livingroom will serve as reading materials throughout the cold winter.
&gt; I will probably sleep as much as possible, but will on occasion need
&gt; something to do. One other thing I am doing is to stock up on old
&gt; clothing and bedding. On the coldest days of winter, I will wrap un
&gt; in 20 or more layers of clothing and will shivver less. I may or may
&gt; not survive, but I am preparing for the worst possible winter in

&gt; If you are impoverished, prepare to freeze to death this winter.

"/>&lt;CHOP! A long post, filled with silly ways to stay warm cheaply&gt;

This upcoming winter of high heating costs is a serious matter that deserves
a better discussion than this silly post has inspired. How about discussing
some real ways of coping with this?

My house in Virginia, has gas-fired, hot water heating. Warnings have been
reported that natural gas prices will be as much as 70% higher this winter.
Since I already dislike what I am paying for natural gas in the winter, I
have already started to look for solutions to the problem. Here is what I
have come up with:

CHECK FOR DRAFTS. A caulking gun and some weather stripping will probably
save me 5% of my heating costs.

BUY THERMAL DRAPES. I already need new curtains, so opting to buy the
thermal variety won't cost me much more, and will probably save a
significant amount of money over time.

INSTALL MORE INSULATION. Little by little, I'm buying rolls of insulation
and layering them over the blown-in material already in my attic. It will
be done before it gets really cold. Significant potential savings.

INTERNAL CLOTHES DRYER VENTING. With a good filter to eliminate the dust
(regularly emptied), this will prevent the waste of a good source of heat.
The filters are available at most home improvement centers.

DRINKING HOT BEVERAGES. There are few better ways to warm up, right after
getting into the house from the cold outdoors than to drink a hot cup of
tea. That's much more efficient than turning up the heat.

EATING HOT FOODS. Chili, oatmeal, soups, stews, etc. are all good choices
for meals during the winter.

AFFECTIONATE GIRLFRIEND. There is no better way to enjoy a good movie on a
cold evening than to have a well-shaped girlfriend snuggling up to you. Skip
the skinny, shapeless waifs that seem to be so popular today. They have
little heat retention value. The really big ones cost too much to maintain
and provide less motivation for close physical contact.

composition of the city. &quot;No-Fault Divorce: Proposed Solutions to a

&quot;A recent study of 25,000 incarcerated juveniles made by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics indicates that 72 percent of them came from broken
homes. Seventy-four percent of the nation's children live with two
parents, 26 percent with one parent. A child growing up in a
single-parent home (usually female-headed) is seven times as likely to
be a delinquent.
Statistics from the Los Angeles Times, 19 September, 1988.

&quot;In a new study of 72 adolescent murders and 35 adolescent thieves,
researches for Michigan State University demonstrated that the
overwhelming majority of t teenage criminals live with only one parent.
Fully 75 percent of those charged with homicide had parents who were
either divorced or had never been married at all; that number rises to
82 percent of those charged with nonviolent larceny offenses. Dewey G.

&quot;Criminologists have long used race and poverty as key variables for
explaining crime rates. However, researchers at the Univ. of Maryland
find that when differences in family structures are taken into account,
crime rates run much the same in rich and poor neighborhoods and among
black, white, and Hispanic populations.&quot;

in this world of capitalism, with countries like china catching on,
look for more consumerism than you could imagine in the us. like
britain, canada provides probably quite well for its people - only
visited canada, never lived there. fake money backed up by dwindling
gold supplies, and fake people who use plastic surgery (as the
brazilians do) to psychoanalyze themselves - sometimes very 'nice'
people don't cut it here - it's turning into an orwellian world with a
twist - a sinking ship that's been broken in two, and will never be put
back together again in this administration. be thankful you are living
in canada, where there are restraints for spending stupidity, and i
imagine, as most brits do, they appreciate careful budgeting, and want
to preserve their values, and their country.

that's the problem - real people have real problems - if, over time,
those problems are reduced to a minimum or even totally, the end result
might be very suprising. my us wife's brother, had a massive drinking
and womanizing problem - now, at 57 he has a thriving restaurant
business, after years of not having a damn thing. now he travels
whenever and where ever he wants, and money is something in the bank.
is the us becoming a throw-away society for people as well as trash?

as for healthcare - if you don't take care of yourself then how can you
expect a stranger (a doctor) to take care of you? the upper strata of
each society is returning slowly but surely to healthy food, exercise
and herbs to help with heart problems, cancer, good living, and
independence. the days of the drug pushing doctors prescribing to that
echelon, are twindling. when you get old and grey, and have to pay
through the nose, with little left to live on (as many seniors do
today), for you prescribed chemicals; harken back to what i say. as
for hospitals over here - our one public hospital became a private
institution to get on the capitalism bandwagon - I CAN'T WAIT FOR
MICHAEL MOORE'S MOVIE ABOUT HMO'S TO COME OUT.
it's going to rock this country and make them grow up - it's not the
pioneering, prospecting country it once was - it's approaching middle

The original PC. This one, a 1983 model, has been loaded with 640K
RAM, but the very earliest had a mere 64K on their motherboards. This
particular PC has two 5¼&quot; 360K floppy drives, one from Big Blue, and
the other from some third party. The power supply pumps out 63.5 big
watts of power. The green screen monitor has no on/off switch, since
it draws its power from the PC supply. The keyboard is as clicky as

"/> This problem has multiple viewpoints.

In the eastern block political crimes were harshly dealt with while
ordinary low class criminal activity often led to significant
rehabilitative efforts.

Perhaps the greatest significant difference was the general inavailability
of illegal drugs and the absence of a drug culture. Alcoholism was (and
perhaps still is) prevalent but with the easy and legal availability
of alcohol it never presented th sorts of problems arising from the
high price of drugs and the impossibility for most addicts to acquire
that sort of money through legal and legitimate methods.

Add to this the impact of requiring every citizen who was capable of
working to hold a state provided job. Then realize that for many years
the ordinary work week was 7 days with only an occasional &quot;work holiday&quot;
nationally proclaimed. Most people didn't have the time to enagage in
crime and maybe were too tired most of the time anyway.

So it wasn't simply &quot;communism&quot; in and of itself but an entire social
order that went along with it.

In my visits to the region after the collapse of communism and the Warsaw
Pact I heard from plenty of workers how much easier life was for them
under communism. &lt;donning asbestos underwear.&gt;

&gt;primary toilet since the bathroom will be unusable without water. I
&gt;have also obtained a box of handi-wipes because I know that I will be
&gt;without a bath or shower all winter, so at least I can wipe my face
&gt;once and awhile. My next projects will be to design a window box that
&gt;will remain outside the one unboarded windows to serve as a
&gt;refrigerator/freezer. I am also designing a trash burning heater that
&gt;will consist of a steel garbage can with a pipe going outside. I am
&gt;collecting all the neighborhood newspaper and other burnable garbage
&gt;and filling my livingroom with this stuff. That will be my only form
&gt;of heat. I am also geting a large metal pail to melt snow on this
&gt;homemade heater for fresh drinking water. My big purchase will be a
&gt;large quantity of candles for light. Without electricity, and with
&gt;all the windows boarded up to retain body heat, there will be a big
&gt;need for a source of light. My other duty will be to fill my car with
&gt;sealed and boxed foods such as crackers. Any foods that do not freeze
&gt;or spoil will be available. Since I have already abandoned my car due
&gt;to the high gas prices, I parked the car right outside my rear door.
&gt;That was I wont have to go far to get something to eat once or twice a
&gt;week. One final note, the piles and piles of old newspapers in my
&gt;livingroom will serve as reading materials throughout the cold winter.
&gt;I will probably sleep as much as possible, but will on occasion need
&gt;something to do. One other thing I am doing is to stock up on old
&gt;clothing and bedding. On the coldest days of winter, I will wrap un
&gt;in 20 or more layers of clothing and will shivver less. I may or may
&gt;not survive, but I am preparing for the worst possible winter in
&gt;modern history, courtesy of the Bush administration.

"/> I was at the store the other day and I found this stuff in the car
section that must be designed to keep people who go off the road in
nasty places alive. It is called antifreeze. It looks like it comes
in a lemon/lime flavor, probaley like a flat mountin dew. If you are
sure you are going to freeze this winter you might want to look into
buying a bottle of this to try.

&quot; I have previously lived as a working poor person in the
US, but I don't hold any ongoing grudge, per se. My
negativity on that is mostly about the pervasive
snobbery from the wannabe-middle-class types, along
with incredible leech mentality that I encountered
among other poor people (esp. the NON-working poor
trying to leech off of me.) &quot;

Say WHAT? Have lived AS? Meaning you weren't?
