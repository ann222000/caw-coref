Scientists gain new insights into 'frozen' methane beneath ocean floor
**************************************************************

IODP Expedition 311 returns to port with core samples
VICTORIA, British Columbia, Canada--An international team of scientists
supported by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) has completed
a unique research expedition aimed at recovering samples of gas
hydrate, an ice-like substance hidden beneath the seafloor off Canada's
western coast. Gas hydrate, a mixture of water and mostly methane, is
believed to occur under the world's oceans in great abundance, but it
quickly &quot;melts&quot; once removed from the high pressure and cold
temperatures of its natural environment, making it very challenging to
recover and analyze.

&quot;We're interested in gas hydrate because we believe these deposits have
played an important role in ancient global climate change,&quot; explains
Michael Riedel of Natural Resources Canada's Geological Survey of
Canada, IODP Expedition 311's co-chief scientist. &quot;This expedition is
the first to explore a transect of deep drilling research sites across
the Cascadia Continental Margin and will yield new data that will help
us understand the deep origin of the methane that composes the gas
hydrate, how the methane is transported into the sediments where gas
hydrate exists, and how methane is eventually released into the ocean,
and possibly, into the atmosphere where it could impact climate.&quot;

&quot;What we've found will fundamentally change how we investigate the
impact of gas hydrate deposits,&quot; confirms IODP co-chief scientist
Timothy S. Collett of the U.S. Geological Survey, Denver, Colo.
&quot;Expedition 311 has shown that the occurrence of gas hydrate is much
more complex than predicted. Instead of finding gas hydrate
concentrated in one layer,&quot; he explains, &quot;near the base of the zone
where it is stable, higher concentrations of gas hydrate were found
within coarse-grained sand layers throughout core samples from most of
the sites drilled.&quot;

Scientists and engineers aboard IODP's U.S.-sponsored research drilling
vessel, the JOIDES Resolution, drilled hundreds of meters below the
seafloor and successfully retrieved gas hydrate in long sediment cores.
More than 1,200 meters of sediment core samples were recovered from
beneath the seafloor during this 37-day expedition. Once core samples
are brought onto the ship, marine laboratory specialists work quickly
to scan them using various sensors and computers to find the gas
hydrate, which is unstable at the surface.

Most previous research on the Cascadia Continental Margin has focused
on conducting detailed, remote sensing studies to image gas hydrate in
the oceanic sediments. In past research efforts, gas hydrate has been
recovered from the Cascadia Margin area using shallow sediment coring
systems that allowed only the upper few meters of sediment to be
sampled.

Among the discoveries of Expedition 311 was a thick section of gas
hydrate lying near the seafloor surface beneath an active vent site,
known as the 'bull's-eye vent,' where methane gas naturally seeps from
the seafloor. This vent site is one of many similar sites observed
along the Cascadia Margin and scientists are just starting to
understand their role in the overall history of the margin. The
episodic nature of the venting and the potential link to earthquake
activity, as well as the possible impact on gas release into the ocean
and atmosphere, will be researched for many years to come, when future
drill site observatories will be linked with the NEPTUNE cable
observatory system. Scientists first became interested in gas hydrate
in 1982, when it was discovered during a research leg of the Deep Sea
Drilling Project, one of two U.S.-sponsored scientific drilling
programs that predate IODP. The samples were retrieved from the Middle
American Trench region, off the Pacific coast of Guatemala. Since then,
gas hydrate has been the focus of numerous studies.

The Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) is an international marine
research drilling program dedicated to advancing scientific
understanding of the Earth by monitoring and sampling sub-seafloor
environments. This IODP drilling expedition was operated by the Joint
Oceanographic Institutions (JOI) Alliance, comprised of JOI, Texas A &amp;
M University, and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
University. IODP's initial 10-year plan is primarily supported by two
lead agencies, the U.S. National Science Foundation and Japan's
Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology.
Additional support comes from the European Consortium for Ocean
Research Drilling and the People's Republic of China, Ministry of
Science and Technology. Canada is a member of the European consortium.
