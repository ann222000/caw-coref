Aussies Sweep Bush Ally From Power
Prime Minister Howard Suffers Humiliating Defeat; Labor Leader
Promises Iraq Withdrawal

SYDNEY, Australia, Nov. 24, 2007

(AP) Conservative Prime Minister John Howard suffered a humiliating
defeat Saturday at the hands of the left-leaning opposition, whose
leader has promised to immediately sign the Kyoto Protocol on global
warming and withdraw Australia's combat troops from Iraq.

Labor Party head Kevin Rudd's pledges on global warming and Iraq move
Australia sharply away from policies that had made Howard one of
President Bush's staunchest allies.

Rudd has named global warming as his top priority, and his signing of
the Kyoto Protocol will leave the U.S. as the only industrialized
country not to have joined it.

Rudd said he would withdraw Australia's 550 combat troops from Iraq,
leaving twice that number in mostly security roles. Howard had said
all the troops will stay as long as needed.

[ . . . ]

It was an embarrassing end to the career of Howard, Australia's second-
longest serving leader.

As little as a year ago, Howard had appeared almost unassailable. But
on Saturday he was in real danger of becoming only the second sitting
prime minister in 106 years of federal government to lose his own seat
in Parliament.

Howard took full blame for the drubbing handed to his center-right
coalition.

'We love America,' Sarkozy tells Congress

by Philippe Alfroy 10 minutes ago

WASHINGTON (AFP) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy hailed the
friendship between France and the United States and paid tribute to American
sacrifices in World War II, in a rare address Wednesday to the US Congress.

&quot;Since the United States first appeared on the world scene, our two
peoples, the French and the American people, have always been friends,&quot;
Sarkozy said, as he emphatically drew a veil on years of cross-Atlantic
tensions sparked by the Iraq war.

He received lengthy and warm applause as he arrived for a joint
session of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and his address was
met by several standing ovations as he heaped praise on the United States.

How desparate AmeriKKKa must be to use such an example when just 4 years
ago AmeriKKKans were villifying the French state for opposing the AmeriKKKan
war crime in Iraq.

Ahahahahahahah.... Oh ya. I forgot.  Last year the Yank Congressional

#  It also points up the contradiction of trying to have a Welfare State on
a capitalist base.
&quot;Economic Democracy&quot; is valid, up to a point, with State ownership of
various aspects of the economy, mostly the essential services and utilities,
which tend to be natural monopolies.
But the missing ingredient is Industrial Democracy, which in France was
known as Anarcho-Syndicalism, and this Leftwing ideal of the Red &amp; Black is
still a valid option, even if ignored and smothered by neo-conservative
propaganda.
Capitalism is an elitist and obsolete economic system, and to leave most
things to &quot;market forces&quot; when some rational and democratic control is
possible, is absurd in the modern age.
But maybe the French will think it through - after all, street rallies can
only achieve so much.

Capitalism as it is persued in the west is pretty much over.  The only
real hold out is the dying AmeriKKKan state that has been thoroughly
poisoned by the system.

You are beyond hope.

An economic  'system'  depends on INITIATIVE in individuals to build up a
surplus in goods and money so others can benefit in some way as a result of
that initiative.   Taxes are derived from initiative.

There is no direct connection between someone with INITIATIVE and an
economic system...it gets imposed by those without initiative but claiming
power.   A system can only exist when there are surpluses.   Without
surpluses there is only day to day survival.

Your mind is full of socialist rubbish about the DISTRIBUTION of someone
else's surpluses.    You cannot institutionalise,  or systemise initiative.
Without initiative you don't have society at all .    How would you organise
people without initiative.   Go to Africa and find out about obsolete
economic people.

Margaret Thatcher was deaf to abstract ideas outside of accountancy.   Just
