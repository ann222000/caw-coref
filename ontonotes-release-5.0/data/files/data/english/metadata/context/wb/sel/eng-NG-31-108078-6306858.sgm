Folks:

What can I say? I got tired of being president of a
box of track and some plans, so I've started a-
building, occasional water infiltration be damned.
I'll get more work done if I squeeze some RRing
in, anyhow.

The Sparta Railroad has been reorganized as
the Petrolia &amp; Erie, because the former name
was just too limiting.  It sounded like a short
line with no grandiose aspirations.  I may change
the name before rails are down, but we must have
something to call the whole mess in the meantime.

Finished so far are four 4-foot L-girder sections,
1x3 web with 1x2 flange, nailed and glued with
yellow Elmer's.  I plan to connect these L-girders
in a traditional grid structure instead of the
Westcott joist method.  This should help achieve
my objects for this layout:

-Not wobbling like a teetotum
-Using up my metric heap of salvaged 1x3
furring strips (which are fine old Douglas fir,
so very beautiful to see and to work with)
-Being easily portable (hence the grid structure)
-Keeping most fasteners accessible from below

I will post updates as material provides itself.

Cordially yours:
Gerard P.
President, a box of track and now some L-girders.

Why use this outdated method?  Regular 2x4s cost less, are easier to

IMO, the easiest thing to do would be to use different length legs and
put the ones on you need.  18" of adjustment could get to be more trouble
than it's worth.

However, the way to do that much adjustment would probably like some
manufacturers do.  Get a couple sections of pipe that fit nicely in each
other, and drill through the middle of the inner pipe and then drill
through your outer pipe at your desired adjustment intervals.  (You may
find predrilled pipe for drainage systems will work.)  If you want 1/2"
adjustment increments, you'll need to turn the pipe and drill new holes
there.  Use a peg to keep the leg at the right height.

For more adjustability, use some form of leg adjuster (the Ntrak club I'm
in likes eye-bolts.)  As long as your pipe intervals are less than the
adjustment from these adjusters, you've got practically infinate
adjustment range between your min and max.

Pd:

You're probably right about the trouble -- I do want to be able to try
different heights, though.

My original plan was to fabricate hollow legs from two 1x3's and two
1x2's, which would slip on to rigidly fixed 2x2 stubs at the top, and
have telescoping 2x2 sections at the bottom, with traditional teenut
adjusters in the end...but I realized as soon as I cut parts for one
that a nominal 3" width  minus two nominal 1" thicknesses doesn't
quite fit a 2x2 without planing it down, and a 4" width is too much.

I've considered the PVC pipe, but I'm concerned about cost (I've got
heaps of 1x3's) and rigidity - I don't know if I could find a size to
telescope perfectly into another, and if I could, the fit would
probably
be too tight. I was also hoping to use the upper 2x2 stubs as corner
blocks for the grid structure.  I want to be able to bounce this thing
off the walls.

What I'll probably do is make up 3x3 angles from a 1x2 and a
1x3, forget about the slip-fit idea, and use carriage bolts and wing
nuts to assemble the 2x2 stubs to the angle.

Eyebolts as adjusters, interesting.  I assume these go into teenuts,
and the eye provides a handy way to turn the bolt - using a rod
through the eye.  I'll probably end up using carriage bolts.

Think about acquiring a table or radial arm saw and rip the outer leg
box pieces to the desired width.  Used saws turn up frequently on
Craigslist and yard sales in the $50-$75 area.  For a serious bench work
project such a tool makes all the wood cutting easier, faster, and
better looking. Power saws make a straighter and smoother cut than you
and I can do with a handsaw.  Even a small 8 inch model is plenty good
enough for benchwork.

That wasn't me. Check the badly-formatted sig, for one.

And hell yes, handsaws are still being made and sold! Garrett Wade,
Toolcraft, Bridge City Tool Works just to name a few if you want a
really nice one that might even cost more than a chop saw. Or your local
hardware store for the ordinary (Stanley, etc.) stuff.

It sounds like he already has the 1x3s. And if they are old and clear,
probably nicer to use tha contemporary cheap 2x4s.

As a former cabinetmaker, I have to agree with those who have
cautioned against getting a radial arm saw. They were popular back
in the 60s and 70s, but I'm not sure any serious shop uses them now.
Well, maybe they have some specialist use that isn't coming to mind,
but they were sold as pretty much a one-machine woodshop- even
with moulding heads available. Even one of those gawdawful Shopsmiths
would be better :)

Oh- I forgot to mention this- don't use nails when building
benchwork. I guess if they're only there to hold things
together until glue dries, they are OK. But nails will eventually
work their way out again. Screws are much better, and you
don't beat the crap out of everything putting them in. Not to
mention the noise...

Get drywall screws (inexpensive and quick to drive in)
and drill pilot holes if you have trouble with them snapping
off while going in. The latter shouldn't be an issue with fir,
unless it's very hard. Using screws, you can even skip the
glue- making disassembly and reconfiguration much easier
when/ if the time comes.

Probably true, in a purist sense, but we aren't talking about fine

are more than adequate (esp. vs. nails), and cheap enough to

Actually, drywall screws are better than wood screws for almost every
purpose. Their sharp, deep threads hold better in all softwoods,
especially on end grain. For #6, and even #8 in most situations, no
pilot hole is needed.

In fact, the new wood screw designs used for flooring and decking borrow
from the drywall screw: they have sharper, deeper threads than
traditional wood screws. They also come in a variety of coatings for
indoor and outdoor use.

Traditional wood screws are designed for hardwoods, which should be
joined with dovetails and biscuits when used for fine cabinet work. Or
so my woodworking friends tell me. ;-)

I have found in the past that drywall screws tend to break far more
easily than wood screws, when used as a means of joining wood together. Now
that could be because of stress that benchwork wouldn't be subjected to, but
I prefer to build things once &lt;g&gt;.

Thanks for bailing me out on this one, Wolf :) I was a cabinetmaker
for almost 30 years, until my back gave out. Everything from large
way-underbudget kitchens to high-end cabinetry. Of course, for
the latter, I'd use traditional joinery (never have tried those
new-fangled biscuits :) but otherwise I really preferred drywall
screws, especially if you're putting a plug over them anyway. But they
do have the downside of snapping off maybe 5% of the time unless
you at least drill a pilot hole though the first piece to be joined to
make up for the fact that they have a threaded shank. And it's good
insurance against splitting, although I've never had much of a problem
with that with end grain.

I suppose nails have their place. Actually, brads have their place- if
I were to even frame a house these days, I'd use screws over nails :)

Truth be told, I've usually always used wood screws when fastening wood
together. I've watched friends try using drywall screws with next to no
luck, but they are to wood working what I am to golf, just hacks &lt;g&gt;.

I am in Washington State. I have found the square bits (in a set of bits) at
Fred Meyer's. The pack is less than $10.00 there.

I have been using the black drywall screws for years and have never broken
one. I am using 1X4 pine. If the wood is old or very hard, you can run the
screw over a bar of soap to help lubricate it.

&gt; Get drywall screws (inexpensive and quick to drive in)

Dale:

Right, they're just there for clamping the laminated girder,
and they're just small 6d finish nails, so any crap-beating
was minimal at worst.  I prefer to use glue for large-area
joints that are not designed to come apart...like L-girders,
but I definitely do use screws where the joint area or
future disassembly dictates it.

I used ordinary wood screws instead of drywall ones, just
because I had a bunch of them around for my rewiring
project...junction boxes and such are really supposed to
be mounted with plated screws, not black ones, and I
don't really like drywall screws for that job anyway.  For
bench work they're the cat's meow...but I don't use them
in lengths of over 2" if I can help it; I find that those are
REALLY one-way fasteners and tend to break if you try
to say otherwise, especially if a bit rusted.

Radial arm saws...well, maybe the cabinetmakers don't
like 'em, but I know of a few farm shops and general
workshops where they come in handy.

Cordially yours:

Amen  -  I heard once this was related to some old Robertson (Canadian)
screw patents that made the inferior Phillips head screws cheaper.  At
least you can find deck screws fairly commonly with square drive, but
availability and selection is often limited.  Probably not many of the MBAs
in charge of purchasing for Lowes or Home Despot have ever driven a screw.

I should have said Phillips not hex.  Was thinking about a DCC problem
at the time&lt;G&gt;.
Yes I can get ones and twos but I thinking of the boxes of 25 and 50
which the Phillips come in.

A local independent Ace affiliate has some deck screws in bulk; but they're
hard to find at the Home Despot clones.

Ah, the troll Steve Caple back out of the wood work.  I see you
sockpuppet Brad is quiet.
But you are once again filling this board with lies (a sin).  Deck
screws in bulk are available at Home Depot, in many sizes.  Is 50
pounds bulk enough for you?  Or a coil of 5,000 for any of 6 nail
guns?  My prayer continues but it is hard to see the result.
