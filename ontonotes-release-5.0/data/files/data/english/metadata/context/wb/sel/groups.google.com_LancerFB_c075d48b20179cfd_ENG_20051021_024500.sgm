COACH'S CORNER
========================================================================

East Central was a nice win against a tough, grind it out football
team. We never felt like they could win win after we took a 14-0
lead but they sure made it frustrating. Their objective was to use
24 seconds on every snap and make the game as short as possible and
they were successful.

I believe that Purcell Marian will try to do the same thing.
Purcell Marian has a good defense. They haven't scored much this
year but their defense has limited opposition points. If you look at
some of their scores they have played impressive defense.

Our goal this week is to finish the job and move onto week 10 and
eventually the playoffs.

-Coach Grippa
