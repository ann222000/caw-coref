There was a man sitting at a bar, and he looks over at the gentleman
sitting next to him and says, &quot;Hey, you look familiar.
Are you from around here?&quot; The man answers, &quot;Yeah, I live down the
street.&quot;
&quot;No kidding?&quot; says the first man, &quot;Well, so do I. And hey, you look
about my age. Where did you go to high school?&quot;
&quot;Oh I went to Francis Lewis over on Utopia. Graduated in '66.
How 'bout you?&quot;
&quot;Get out. I went to Francis Lewis. And I graduated in '66, too.&quot;
&quot;Where'd you go to college?&quot;
&quot;Beloit, in Wisconsin.&quot;
&quot;No way! I went to Beloit too. What dorm?&quot;
&quot;Kevin Sullivan dorm.&quot;
&quot;Sullivan? You're not going to believe this . . .&quot;
Joe the bartender walks over, and the first guy says, &quot;Joe, you won't
believe it in a million years. This guy went to the same
high school as me, graduated the same year I did, and went to the same
college. We were even in the same dorm. Isn't that amazing?&quot;
Joe looks at them both and says, &quot;Yeah, that's just plain amazing.&quot;
A third man comes in and says, &quot;Hey Joe. What's new?&quot; Joe says, &quot;Not
much. The Johnson twins are drunk again.&quot;

Warmest wishes to our friends at the ACLU!

Please accept with no obligation, implied or implicit, my best wishes
for an environmentally conscious, socially responsible, low-stress,
non-addictive, gender-neutral celebration of the winter solstice
holiday, practiced within the most enjoyable traditions of the
religious persuasion or secular practices of your choice, with respect
for the religious/secular persuasions and/or traditions of others, or
their choice not to practice religious or secular traditions at all;

PLUS

a fiscally successful, personally fulfilling, and medically
uncomplicated recognition of the onset of the generally accepted
calendar year, but not without due respect for the calendars of choice
of other cultures, and without regard to the race, creed, color, age,
physical ability, religious faith, choice of computer platform, or
orientation of the wisher.

(And to the rest of you: Merry Christmas!)

Three engineers and three accountants were traveling by train to a
conference. At the station, the three accountants each bought tickets
and watched as the three engineers bought only one ticket.
&quot;How are three people going to travel on only one ticket?&quot; asked an
accountant.
&quot;Watch and you'll see&quot;, answered an engineer.
They all boarded the train. The accountants took their respective
seats, but the three engineers all crammed into a rest room and closed
the door behind them. Shortly after the train departed, the conductor
came around collecting tickets. He knocked on the restroom door and
said, &quot;Ticket, please&quot;.
The door opened just a crack and a single arm emerged with a ticket in
hand.
The conductor took it and moved on.
The accountants saw this and agreed it was a quite clever idea. So,
after the conference, the accountants decide to copy the engineers on
the return trip and save some money (being clever with money, and all
that). When they got to the station, they bought a single ticket for
the return trip. To their astonishment, the engineers didn't buy a
ticket at all.
&quot;How are you going to ride without a ticket&quot;? said one perplexed
accountant.
&quot;Watch and you'll see&quot;, answered an engineer.
When they boarded the train, the three accountants crammed into a
restroom and the three engineers crammed into another one nearby. The
train departed. Shortly afterward, one of the engineers left his
restroom and walked over to the restroom where the accountants were
hiding. He knocked on the door and said, &quot;Ticket, please.&quot;

Cannibals capture three men. The men are told that they will be skinned
and eaten and then their skin will be used to make canoes. Then they
are each given a final request. The first man asks to be killed as
quickly and painlessly as possible. His request is granted, and they
poison him. The second man asks for paper and a pen so that he can
write a farewell letter to his family. This request is granted, and
after he writes his letter, they kill him saving his skin for their
canoes. Now it is the third man's turn. He asks for a fork. The
cannibals are confused, but it is his final request, so they give him a
fork. As soon as he has the fork he begins stabbing himself all over
and shouts, &quot;To hell with your canoes!&quot;

A guy is swerving down the road and gets pulled over. The cop
says, &quot;You have to take a Breathalyzer test.&quot; The guy says, &quot;I
can't. I have asthma, and it'll start me on a coughing fit.&quot;

The cop says, &quot;Then I have to give you a blood test.&quot; The guy
says, &quot;You can't. I'm a hemophiliac, and if you prick me, I'll
bleed all over the place.&quot;

The cops says, &quot;Then you have to get out of the car and walk a
straight line.&quot; The guy says, &quot;I can't.&quot; The cop says, &quot;Why
not?&quot;

The guy says, &quot;Because I'm drunk you idiot... didn't you see
the way I was driving!&quot;

A local florist just went out of business, but it was his own
fault.

He kept getting his orders mixed up. One woman received flowers
sent by her husband, who was at a business meeting in Florida.
She was perplexed by the message on her card: &quot;Our deepest
sympathy.&quot;

But she was not nearly as surprised as the woman whose husband
had just passed away. Her card read, &quot;Hotter here than I
expected. Too bad you didn't come too.&quot;

Three buddies die in a car crash, and they find themselves at the
pearly gates.

They are all asked, &quot;When you are in your casket and friends and
family are mourning upon you, what would you like to hear them say
about you?

The first guy says, &quot;I would like to hear them say that I was the
greates doctor of my time, and a great family man.&quot;

The second guy says, &quot;I would like to hear that I was a wonderful
husband and school teacher who made a huge difference in our
children of tomorrow.&quot;

The last guy replies,
&quot;I would like to hear them say... LOOK!!! HE'S MOVING!!!!!&quot;
