Are there any good transportation options for getting around the city
without a rental car? (The most remedial response would be appreciated, I'm
not at all up to speed on LA geography.)

Specifically, I'm looking to visit a friend who lives in/near Westwood on
Fri or maybe Sat night. Feel free to e-mail me directly, or respond here if
the info could be of general interest.

Thx,
Pat

Your friend should pick you up if possible.  Maybe a local heading
home can drop you off (hard to count on though).  Other than that,
we'd only have cabs or bus that would get you there. Cabs will likely
be very expensive. I've lived here my whole life and I've only taken a
cab once--and then only when I was drunk and a friend stuffed me into
it.

If you wanted to try the bus, there's a trip planner and other info

He's visually impaired and doesn't drive.
