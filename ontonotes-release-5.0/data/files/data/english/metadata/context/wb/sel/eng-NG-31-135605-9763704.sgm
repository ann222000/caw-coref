I have used them in Clipper extensively, are there are issues with them in
VO, any gotchas, any problems, ect?

Is it still worth using an array rather than seperate variables.

They are being used in a report and I want to store values on a line, so I
know what the previous line was like.

These functions can contain a lot of code and cannot really be done except
in VO.

Martin,

The main advantage of an array is so you can iterate through the values
programmatically.

Martin.

Why use them at all. They are not very OO. Why not set up a class to
carry 'global' information so that you can control their access. If they
are truly local then they are just, well... local! &lt;g&gt;.

Static really just limits visibility. You need to look at the problem
you need to solve by thinking you want to us them. There are generally
better OO alternates.

Hi Martin,

I use statics and arrays still today just as I have done in my Clipper
days, with the exception that these days they are strict typed and not
of type usual anymore.

I do however agree with Geoff that one should consider in the long run
the use of class definitions where applicable because of readibility
and ease of maintenance.  There are however situations where the use
of an array is still applicable without the necessity of the class
overhead. I do suggest as Geoff, you consider the use of a GLOBAL
class keeping all these needed values in one place.  Allthough as in
your case if a certain variable is only applicable to some classes/
functions in one module then it is just STATIC GLOBAL and not GLOBAL
&lt;VBG seeing Geoff going to jump on my case here again&gt;.

HTH,

I don't jump, I climb slowly but inexorably....
Mates don't pounce without an invite.

And in fact I have globals in my app for the same reason VO has them -
convenience. But when someone says they need a 'static' you start to ask
questions about visibility and conflict. The reason is usually to
prevent conflict (eg WED generated defines that would otherwise
collide).

Static functions are used to &quot;hide&quot; functions but again you would have
to ask why. If it is for a published DLL that you don't want to give
away functionality, perhaps. If it is to reduce drop selections clutter,
perhaps. But normally there is just no need. You don't get performance
or size benefits so why complicate your application framework?

So in summary I guess I am only coming from a productivity point of
view.

Regards,

Geoff

Geoff,

I do understand 100% what you saying, its a convenience to use
globals, just as much as using statics is a convenience.

I however see static as a way to encapsulate things that has no scope
out of the context it should be used in.  Just as a class is a
container for related variables and methods static provides a way of
forcing variables/functions not to be used out of context.

As far as I can remember, and somebody like Frans de Wit would be able
to confirm, internally METHOD X() CLASS Z is translated to STATIC
FUNCTION X(SELF AS Z) and SELF:X() to X(SELF) by the compiler.  So
whether you like them or not they are part of your life even if you
don't use them yourself.

Well as you said it yourself, I use them too from a productivity point
of view.

Have a great day and weekend.

Johan

Currently using my old Clipper technique of a GETSET function, the related

well i have removed most statics and most globals.

the use of statics is mainly in functions which are repeatedly called.
so i hold the data from the last call in case its the same data needed
so it can be returned from memory rather than from the database.

one other place we use statics is in treeviews [thansk to adriano who
developed our stuff with a useful cargo for making very complex trees]
- it works fast.

almost all globals have been replaced by getset mechanisms - one for
parameters, one for user settings, and one for category lists for
dropdowns.

all are accessed via sysobject() which is set to the main window

it speeded a typical window up no end.

No. You do that through your published interface.

Don't provide the prototypes to that which you don't want public. But I
would argue that almost everything you produce within the dll should be
available anyhow. Just because you don't think someone should use it
doesn't mean that someone might think differently &lt;g&gt;.

But who are you to decide this? If you write some crazy and useful

Not true. Who cares what VO does internally - it has no bearing on the
syntax we choose to use in an OO environment. Hence they are not part of
my everyday use of VO at all. They are not visible and do not manifest
themselves in my ode base the way globals must.

Yes I know that but the whole design of a C# code base and the way it is
managed in the IDE is quite different. I don't think we can apply the
same arguments the same way.

My question with VO is what is a function and shy is one used?

Well generally a function does something along the lines of a
calculation, conversion or access some non OO resource you need. It
usually passes in parameters and offers a return value. You don't use a
function to access an object, perform actions and then close the object.
You would write a method on the object thus encapsulating the required
functionality. Hence functions are utility in nature and use.

So what does making something static achieve?

Malcolm suggests that it can reduce the complexity of published
frameworks. Well I kind of understand but I think you can control that
better with the prototype libs you offer. I would argue that your
utility functions could very well be of use to others. Just look at
bBrowser and other common tools. They all come with very useful
functions and I would be a tad disappointed if they were all hidden. The
other reason is to avoid naming conflicts. Well then I ask the question
about why you are creating gollops of functions with the same name in
the first place. Isn't this inviting confusions of another kind? What
benefit or reason is there for doing this? And aren't there better
coding models for managing this?

It is an interesting debate on coding design and methodology and I am
not seeing the broader framework requirement for static things in VO.

&gt; managed in the IDE is quite different. I don't think we can apply the same
&gt; arguments the same way.
">

Well I don't know what the IDE has got to do with it.

I agree, that yes the design of C# is quite different (it was after all
designed in this century), and I'm not suggesting that they are the same as
in VO. I just meant that you don't want to write off, the term or key word
Static when you move to C# and .Net and hence I would think Vulcan.

For instance, VO doesn't have the concept of private contructors, like C#
does.

For a simple example, take a look at the .Net Screen class. Note it doesn't
have a public contructor and therefore you can't explicitly create a Screen
object.

Even though it has a public property WorkingArea you can't say

Rectangle rect = Screen.WorkingArea;

because WorkingArea isn't declared as static.

but you can do the following via the public static property PrimaryScreen

Rectangle rect = Screen.PrimaryScreen.WorkingArea;

or you could do the same thing with the overloaded public static method
GetWorkingArea()

Rectangle rect = Screen.GetWorkingArea(this);

In neither case do you have to have code such as the following

Screen screen = new Screen();

before you can use a Screen object. In fact that line wont compile because
the Ctor is private or internal

As you can see Statics are quite different in C#, so when moving to .Net,
they do become very important.

Another useful feature of statics is their use in Constructors. Since Ctors
can be overloaded, there is nothing stopping you using a normal public
constructor, plus an additional static constructor. The static constructor
will always be called once, before the public constructor. That can be
extremely useful.

Anyone contemplating a move to .Net would be well advised to study up on
Statics and how they work in C#.

VB.Net will have something similar, but I'm buggered, if I know what those
guys call 'em.

Yes, it's like an initial initialiser &lt;g&gt; but I think it is horribly
misnamed when it is called a static constructor.

Meanwhile, the discussion was about VO. Sometimes I've seen static
locals used in methods to set like a master default value. I understand
the expedience but I don't like the mechanism.

Unfortunately there are a lot of books that seem to just glide over these
important design fundermentals. That screen class though is a good example
actually - especially if you study its code with Reflector. You know what
you tell them here about studying the VO SDK - well your new .Net matra,
would be look at MS's .Net code with Reflector.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Yes, it's like an initial initialiser &lt;g&gt; but I think it is horribly

No not really - a static constructor is as its name implies - guess what you
can initialize with that type of constructor - static properties of your
class. Static properties can be used (shared) by multiple instances of a
class. Remember a static constructor is only called once, no matter how many
times you instantiate the class.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Meanwhile, the discussion was about VO.

Yes, I think I'll leave that to you guys. I can remember playing with static
methods in VO, but I now can't remember a particular example to discuss.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

In VO, isn't that just so that multiple instances of the same class can
share the value of that static variable?

STATIC GLOBAL is the new VO syntax for a file/module wide STATIC in
Clipper.  Hence its put in a textblock.

Insofar as sports go, yes &lt;g&gt;. Its only followed by about 15% of
Aussies, rugby suffering the spectator split of two rugby codes. Of
course it isn't inconsequential to rugby nuts and all Aussies will go
and watch a good competitive game of anything, including rugby (if
nothing else is on &lt;g&gt;).

But I think both sides of the Tasman down here are smarting a little.
The Kiwis are beating themselves to a pulp over their loss and they take
rugby even more seriously than you guys.

Hot pants? Haven't seen those since the 80's, although for some reason,
a good proportion of players go the full wax treatment... perhaps they
take the Adonis principal a little too far. At least they don't go round
grabbing handfuls of cheek in a leery scrum, sniffing one another butts

Will,

Geoff and I are both Victorians, the original home of real football, which
finished last week with 100,000 odd watching the Grand Final. None of that
other stuff, round or oval ball could even get close from where we look.
Rugby is for those buggers up North, mainly because they wouldn't even get a
kick playing real footy, and real Aussies don't play round ball.

Did you hear that even Warnie wants to stay home next year, rather than play
county, because he wants to take his kids to the footy next winter.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; At least you are unlikely to be beaten at that! ;&gt;) (Good game

Yeh, but it has to better than watching all the cry baby acting when a round
ball player gets hit.

Hi all

The game of RUGBY was started at rugby school as a &quot;yard game&quot; at one
of the boarding houses. The &quot;brothers acton&quot; who started it were
expelled, and their guardian managed to get them in to the then newly
opened &quot;cheltenham college&quot; [another boarding prison for would be
offenders in which i was also incarcerated thrice annually].

they joined the &quot;house&quot; which i was in: christow. after a year as yard
game there, the school adopted it as a way of toughening up the pupils
- in those days 90% went into the army.

on the side of the old chapel - built by a soldier - facing north
south and now the dining hall - a plaque states &quot;rugby brought to
college by the brothers acton in 1842&quot; or something like that.

it was played TWO games to a field at the SAME time, each game playing
at 90degrees to the other with TWENTY players per side. christow won
for many years, as the boards (listing the 20 players in the teram) in
the common room show - spent years loooking at the bloody things
during evening prayers - the prayer being that we would NOT get caught
humping the trainee nurses living across the lane.... must have been
using the wrong god.....

anyway [imho] the english backs are crap compared to the sa lineup.

question is how many were still being exported to oz ?

Well I agree with you on that one (on paper at least). Saturday
(Sunday for some you) all are equal in the final and it will be more
about who has the best discipline and game plan.  SA playing to spread
the ball wide while Eng will probably try and dominate with the
forwards and Wilkinson.  May the best team win.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; question is how many were still being exported to oz ?

Don't know how many still exported to Oz, but for one thing SA is
loosing quite a number of players to play next year in Europe.

Take care and hope you enjoy the Rugby on Saturday.

All of the best also to France and Argentina for their play-off on
Friday.
