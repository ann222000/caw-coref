Well, the vibration in the prop that I mentioned last week has been
rectified. Aparently they fixed it up during the week. No sign of
vibration anymore.

Did 2 circuits with the instructor today, and 5 solo. Was reasonable
happy with my last touch down, but all the rest were a bit sloppy.
Winds were about 12kts, and between 100 and 120 degrees, which really
made it crosswind circuits, as we were using runway 17. I guess this
partly explains why the landings were not to my liking, but not
completely. Most of the approaches were a bit low too, with 1 being low
enough to give me a bit of a scare. Came in too low, and had to give
almost full power to clear the trees. Was happy with my result in that
one though, as I recognised the situation, and tought it out clearly. I
remember being careful not to panic and pull back too hard on the
stick. Otherwise I would have stalled the wings and had a closer look
at the branches. I applied the power, and pushed the nose down a little
to gain speed, then gently pulled back on the stick. She gained speed
and climbed nicely. I'm sure it was nowhere near as close a call as I
thought it was, but it was really the first time I've had to 'take
evasive action'.

Booked in again for next saturday afternoon, and I should knock off the
balance of my solo circuits requirement then, so we can move on to the
next part of the syllabus. Looking forward to that.

The best technique is to have the plane in a nice position at about 500ft on
final, not too far out so as you use minimal power and almost glide down
final. Its not called the "glide path" for nothing. Its so much easier and
safer to let the plane basically fly itself down final. Try it with your
instructor. That is ask him to set you up a bit higher and use less power.
You will find it heaps better.

Nice advise Bernie. Thanks. As I said, most of my approaches were too
low today. Not normally a problem. My instructor usually does a couple
of circuits with me then sets me loose. I might get her to actually fly
the first approach next time. Just as a refresher of how it should be
done. It's all well and good me going around and around practicing
circuits, but if I'm practicing them wrong, there's no point is there!
I guess it's better to come in a bit high and go around if you can't
get down, than come in too low and not make the runway! ;-)

What you'd prefer to see in rec.aviation.piloting is of no concern to
me. I posted a message that 100% relates to this group. It is also of
100% relevance to alt.games.microsoft.flight-sim, as I have many
friends over there too. And before you start, my term 'friends' is
valid as I have personally met several of the posterss in person.
4 newsgroups all with a common theme of flight, is hardly spamming, and
in reference to your quoted guidelines, I would indeed call 4 flight
related groups "a very small number of newsgroups that are related to
the subject at hand".
I 100% guarantee you that if the sim group wasn't in there, you
wouldn't have even commented. Such a shame some real pilots can be so
up themselves.
You know, I started out as a sim pilot. There was discussion about how
the sim pilots and the real pilots didn't get on. Some real pilots
suggested some sim pilots should go and see how different the 2 are.
Well, I DID take the challenge, and am becoming a real pilot. I have
never drawn said simming is in any way the same as really flying. I
post an experience about a real flying lesson and you throw up this
crap.
I respectfuly suggest you blow it out your arse.

Dear Mr Crash

Since it's been decades, not years, since I was signed off as a PP,
things probably have changed, but I remember a lesson dear old CFII J
O'B taught.

He pointed out that if I was to suffer an engine failure at any time
after passing the numbers downwind and not be able to glide to the
runway, if I didn't die in the crash he'd kill me for embarrassing
him! He reserved the right, during dual instruction, to yank the
throttle full back, lean back, and cross his arms. Woe on the student
who couldn't make the numbers comfortably.

The point is this -- don't get too low! You have flaps, you have
slips, all kinds of tools for dumping energy, but there may come a
time when you don't have a way of adding any.

Once you're at pattern altitude you're becoming a superior pilot if
all of your power adjustments are in the downward direction. Pay
attention to CHT, cowl flaps if you have them, things like that, to
keep the engine 'comfortable', but try very hard to not put yourself
in a circumstance where you have to add power.

Now, there's an important point here. Safety is the point. The "I want
to be a superior pilot" ego should not prevent you from adding power
if you have to. Just give yourself a lower grade on that landing, and
go forth and sin no more.

May the wind be gentle on your nose during the flare!

I would make a poor instructor because it has been too long since I learned to fly.  It is not
because I neglect the basics but rather that I do things without, any longer, being conscious of
it, therefore "why"!

I must ask - was the headwind (on final) on the day greater than you had previously experienced?

Wind strength will have an effect on how "close" you should turn base/final thus determining how
"steep" your approach will be.  Under these circumstances, a steep approach is not necessarily
an indication that an approach is 'wrong' as it is a function of airspeed (distance through the
air) and not groundspeed (distance over the ground).

The distinction of approach angle in relation to the difference in headwind on final is not
always immediately recognised - it comes with, firstly, recognising the situation and taking the
appropriate action -then- later, experience will kick in and it will become 'automatic'.

No, the headwind was not stronger than I had experienced before. I
reakon I just had a tough time deciding when it was best to turn base.
Made my downwinds too long. Next time, if the wind is similar, I'm
going to try and turn base sooner, and I'm sure that will make all the
difference.

Hi Tony!
You know what? When we did glide aproaches, I did fine! I'll try and
put that lesson into practice next week and make every approach a glide
approach.
My a/c doesn't have flaps either by the way. It's a little ultralight
Gazelle.

That is also how I used to teach when I was mostly flying Aeroncas and
Cessna 140's. However, most of the instructor community is starting to
change its opinion on the old "you should be able to make the runway w/
o power from abeam". The problem with that technique is that is sets
you up for a less stable approach. Today, there are far more accidents
as a result of unstable setups than engine failure in the pattern.
Many of the pilot type courses (Mooney, Bonanza), etc teach CFIs not
to pull the power abeam specifically to avoid teaching this
technique.
The way I teach now is to let the pilot maintain some power throughout
the pattern but to roll out on final such that everything is set up to
fly "hands off" below 500 feet. In most situations, if you have to do
anything more than small adjustments below 500 feet, you go around.
This technique works *MUCH* better in high performance aircraft (and
retracts) but also is ok in trainers too.
In short, you are more likely (today) to damage something with a non-
stable final than an engine failure in the pattern. When I demo
landings now I set the plane up for landing at 500 feet and cross my
arms so they can see that everything is trimmed and set up for hands
off flight.

Interesting, and makes sense.
I spent many a buck mastering the glide approach as a separate
technique, ie pull the throttle somewhere abeam the numbers and don't
touch it again until you finish with the wings.
Do you still teach this? I mean it's very useful in the case of a
FLWOP don't you think?

&gt; Do you still teach this? I mean it's very useful in the case of a
&gt; FLWOP don't you think?

Really the only time I pull the power in the pattern is before a non-
instrument checkride. I don't pull the power in the pattern in high
performance aircraft at all.
What I generally do is put the pilot under the hood and get him very
involved in some instrument procedures about 3,000 feet over an
airport (not the procedure airport). Then I pull the power and tell
him we just came out of the clouds. It usually takes a few moments to
realize that they are right over an airport.
About 75% of pilots are not able to land at an airport from 3,000 on
top of the field. Usually after 3 attempts they have it down. I
consider this more valuable than pulling the power in the pattern and
probably more real-life.

Why did you need to push the nose down slightly? Were you slow as well
as low, so you needed the extra airspeed? Or were you afraid of
stalling even though you had plenty of airspeed? If you needed to push
the the nose down slightly you were dangerously slow, and if you
didn't need to then you shouldn't have.

&gt; Well, the vibration in the prop that I mentioned last week has been
&gt; rectified. Aparently they fixed it up during the week. No sign of
&gt; vibration anymore.

&gt; Did 2 circuits with the instructor today, and 5 solo. Was reasonable
&gt; happy with my last touch down, but all the rest were a bit sloppy.
&gt; Winds were about 12kts, and between 100 and 120 degrees, which really
&gt; made it crosswind circuits, as we were using runway 17. I guess this
&gt; partly explains why the landings were not to my liking, but not
&gt; completely. Most of the approaches were a bit low too, with 1 being low
&gt; enough to give me a bit of a scare. Came in too low, and had to give
&gt; almost full power to clear the trees. Was happy with my result in that
&gt; one though, as I recognised the situation, and tought it out clearly. I
&gt; remember being careful not to panic and pull back too hard on the
&gt; stick. Otherwise I would have stalled the wings and had a closer look
&gt; at the branches. I applied the power, and pushed the nose down a little
&gt; to gain speed, then gently pulled back on the stick. She gained speed
&gt; and climbed nicely. I'm sure it was nowhere near as close a call as I
&gt; thought it was, but it was really the first time I've had to 'take
&gt; evasive action'.

&gt; Booked in again for next saturday afternoon, and I should knock off the
&gt; balance of my solo circuits requirement then, so we can move on to the
&gt; next part of the syllabus. Looking forward to that.

I reakon I pushed it down (slightly) because I was afraid of stalling. As I
said before, there was probably no danger at all, but I reakon as it was my
worst approach, and I was closer than I had ever been to an obstacle, I
wanted the extra speed and power just in case.
