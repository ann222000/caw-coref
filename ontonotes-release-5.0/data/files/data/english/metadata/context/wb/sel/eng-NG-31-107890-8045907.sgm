Hi all, I've a common problem I'm sure, yet I'm puzzled as to where it
is exactly. I've recently restored the chassis, (replaced  ALL caps,
resistors that have drifted in value and also some of the rubbered
wires). In standard broadcast mode, AM, I can tune in the local
stations from 1600kc on down and the stations a pretty much in line
with the dial indicator. The mechanical tuning capaictor is following
suit. However, about at 800kc on the dial where a station should be, I
find it a little lower, say, 730kc with respect to the dial indicator.
Every other station on down is a little further off as I go. 580 CFRA
no longer registers, I mean, I can't even tune in this very local
station. What gives here?

Sounds like you've only swapped parts, and failed to do the necessary alignment.
With all the replacement values being different from the pieces you've replaced,
there is no way the alignment could be the same.  Have you ever done an alignment
before?

That should have a screw adjustement for the low end . Look for a white
porclain single adjustement mounted by itself on the chassis somewhere .

Use the padder cap to bring the low end down. Ken

Jim, Ken G &amp; Ken, thank you for the info. Yes, I 'swapped' parts for
new ones, ie. .05 @ 400v for a .047 @ 400v, a slight and maybe in this
case, appreciable difference. This padder tunning cap, would it be
part of a gang of these caps or is it all by itself? The reason I ask
is that there is a series of porcelain trimmer caps, (3), together on
this particular chassis that can be tweaked from the outside of the
chassis. I know enough NOT to 'adjust' what may mis-align the whole
set. I've searched this group for the alignment procedure and found a
comprehensive step by step approach. Is this what has to be done?
Any further thoughts? Thank-you

My reference was to the fact that the original capacitors in the set did not have the
same value as their markings.  Yes, .05 &amp; .047 are reasonably close, but the original
.047 you pulled may have been far off it's marked value.  They have drifted, the same
way you've noticed that many of the original the resistors have drifted.  When you
replace 10, 20, 30 components that have all drifted to some degree over time, there
is no way the radio will be in the same alignment as before they were replaced.  A
simple or complete alignment should always be considered when replacing components,
especially in the front end of a radio.

Learning to do an alignment is just as important as replacing off-value components
when restoring a radio to it's original performance.  Swapping the parts got you half
way there.  A full alignment can turn a poorly performing radio to a good one, and
often turn a good performing radio into a great one.  I'd recommend learning on a few
AM only AA5 sets.  Go ahead and mess up the slugs and trimmers with the radio off,
and then plug it in and try to align it from that condition.  Once you master a few
of the easier sets, then move on to more complex ones, like the multi-band sets.
After all, you don't want to be working on the AM band, and accidentally be turning
the slugs for the SW coils.  And there is nothing better than having the correct
alignment instructions for the particular radio, until you have the experience to
tackle one with generic instructions.  You need to know what to adjust, and what you
are trying to accomplish by turning that adjustment.  Adjusting the padder as others
have mentioned will get your dial positioning closer, but is only one step towards an
alignment.  No time like the present to learn to do the whole job, rather than just
part of it.  Learn to do a full alignment, and get the best performance possible out
of that Zenith of yours.

Do you own a Signal Generator?

Do you have the schematic for the chassis?

Do you have the Alignment Instructions for this chassis?

the three in a row are the OSC trimmers each has a frequency it should
be adjusted to.... the big ceramic single one on the back apron is the
600 Khz Padder ... a couple of the ANT trimmers are on top of the tuning
capacitor... one is also on the cardboard box antenna...

In the tops of the two IF cans are pairs of trimmers... they have to
be set to the correct IF frequency....
