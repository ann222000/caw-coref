Hi -- I am running Fedora Core 5 and would like to install an AGP video
card that has DVI output. Could someone recommend an economical card,
with at least 128MB memory, that would work well under Linux FC5?

Thanks.

FC7 is much more mature.

Great links. Thanks.

Anything I need to be aware of specially to enable the DVI interface, or
does it &quot;just happen&quot; if I plug that cable in instead of the VGA cable?

No special steps need even be taken, this is GNU/Linux.  We're talking
competence, here...
I plugged in my DVI and it just worked!  Five months later, still works!
