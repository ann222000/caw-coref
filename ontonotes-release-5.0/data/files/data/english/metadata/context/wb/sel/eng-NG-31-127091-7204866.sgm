GET THE VASECTOMY!    If you think your girlfreind might whine then
don't tell her.  Though you might save yourself some web if you asked
if she might ever want more children.
And the converse is NOT TRUE, it's not about what you want or
whether you feel paternal, it's about saving the universe from
overpopulation and about saving others, including me, from education
and childcare taxes.  You can go ahead a freeze sperm if you want and
if you think your doctoer will give you flack then don't tell him about
it.  Also, I got mine at a full service abortion clinic where they have
their own good reasons for offering vasectomies to anyone who wants
one. Try them if you doctor gets nosy about why or all psycho about how
you feel. Demand the vasectomy with no questions asked and don't take
any psychobabble crap from breeders.

Hi Adam,

I, as well, had a strong suspicion in my early 20s that I would not
develop the desire to have kids, which turned out to be right.
