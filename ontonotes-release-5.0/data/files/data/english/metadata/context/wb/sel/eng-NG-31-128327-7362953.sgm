Many of you know that my husband Mike Gurley and I grow plants for sale
at the Charlotte Regional Farmers Market.  This is our 17th season!
Anyway, we will be happy to donate some plants for the project on April
14th, but also want you all to be on the lookout for the PLANT SALE
TODAY sign that we'll put in the driveway from time to time this
spring.  Hope you'll stop by.  We have lots of stuff that does well in
our neighborhood, plus all kinds of herbs, trees, and hardy ferns.  We
would like to donate some native wildflowers to plant in the greenway
area.  If you have some free time and want to help, let me know and
we'll plop some things in here and there.

> Hi Everyone,   Just wanted to remind you that our Hands On Merry Oaks project is Saturday, April 14th from 9:00am - noon.  We will be meeting at Merry Oaks School to plant flowers and shrubs.  We can use your help anytime between 9-noon.  Wear your gardening clothes and bring your gardening tools.  If you cannot help and are able to donate plants, please drop them off in my driveway (2301 Arnold Dr.) anytime before the 14th of April.     We would love some butterfly and bird attracting plants, such as coneflowers,
> black-eyed susans, small hollies or similar evergreens, bags of soil or other perennial sun-loving and low maintenance plants...thrift, candytuft, salvia (hummingbirds), phlox.  Other items on the wish list are a hose, bird feeders, bird house and bird seed.   So, if you're heading to Home Depot or your favorite nursery, please keep us in mind.  This will be a fun project and I hope to see lots of you there.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.  cate1 ... @yahoo.com    Cate Martin
