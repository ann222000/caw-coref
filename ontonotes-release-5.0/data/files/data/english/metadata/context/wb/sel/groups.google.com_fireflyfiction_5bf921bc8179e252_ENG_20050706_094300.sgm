Kaylee pulled her hand out of the grip and touched River's forehead, running
fingers into rich, brown hair. River bent her head into the touch, curved into
it like a cat.

&quot;I have to.&quot; Kaylee said softly. &quot;For you. It's important.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; River nodded sadly. &quot;I knew. Can't change a mind. I had to try.&quot;

&quot;The sleeping tablets you can give up, Bao Bei, but not the rest of it, not
when you've come so far.&quot;

River thrilled to the name, closed her eyes and was content to bask in the buzz
she was getting from the other woman.

&quot;Are they so bad, the dreams?&quot;

River's eyes snapped open, she was no longer content to be within her own head.

&quot;Not your dreams.&quot; She said and an image made her smile. &quot;Grass and sky and
leaves fly by. You had a tree swing.&quot;

Kaylee's face broke open in a bright smile.

&quot;I'd nearly forgotten that!&quot;

River shook her head.

&quot;Your dreams didn't. You loved that swing and Oh!&quot; River suddenly gave a
mischievous grin. &quot;you were such a flirt there.&quot;

Kaylee blushed a deep red and her smile softened.

&quot;Yeah. I really was.&quot; She saw River stifle a yawn. &quot;But now it's time for you
to try to sleep, or Simon will never forgive me.&quot;

She stood up and watched as River melted into a lying position, stretching her
limbs out to the end of the bed, resting her head on the pillow and pulling the
blanket up. Kaylee turned to look at Simons bed, neat and perfect, sheets
tucked in so tight she could probably bounce jacks off them. She wondered how
he was going in her bunk, not so neat, not so structured.

&quot;It's cold over there.&quot; Came the voice and Kaylee turned to see River watching
her with a smile. &quot;But it's warm here.&quot;

&quot;Oh, is it now?&quot; She arched her brows. &quot;Why, River Tam, I believe you're
flirting.&quot;

&quot;Please?&quot;

She had such a pathetic, pleading puppy dog look that Kaylee just had to smile.

&quot;Okay.&quot; She agreed and gave her a stern look. &quot;But only 'til you fall asleep.&quot;

Rolling onto her back, River smiled at the ceiling, waiting for Kaylee to
change. She could live with that addendum, because she knew Kaylee was a heavy
sleeper and once sleep came she could stay surrounded in Kaylee's happy dreams,
far away from her own with no fear of isolation.

A weight dipped the mattress and River shifted, moved onto her side, back
against the wall. Kaylee lay stiffly in the warmth that she had left behind,
breathing carefully and lost for words. River didn't care, she threw her arm
over Kaylee's shoulder and nestled her face into her neck.

&quot;Goodnight River.&quot;

Kaylee felt awkward, too close, too much heat flowing between them, at their
hips where they met, through their legs which pressed together, at her shoulder
where River's breath blew over her skin. She tried to breathe normally, tried
to find a place for her arms that felt comfortable and settled with drawing her
arm up to cradle River's head, running her hand down River's hair.

River angled her head upwards and lightly touched her lips to Kaylee's,
softness and sizzle, her lips burned. Kaylee gasped, suddenly still and unable
to move. They were both intensely aware of their closeness.

Made bold by the lack of protest, she pressed forward again.

&quot;River?&quot; Kaylee whispered. &quot;What are you...?&quot;

&quot;Want.&quot; Came the simple reply. &quot;And so do you.&quot;

River drew herself up on one elbow, looking straight at Kaylee. Her eyes burned
deep and Kaylee found herself blushing. She couldn't say River was wrong. Her
heart pounded.

&quot;It's okay, Kaylee.&quot; River talked as if soothing a child and, Kaylee realized,
as a lot of people talked to River. &quot;Nothing will happen. Just a kiss.&quot;

&quot;I don't think...&quot; Kaylee closed her eyes and then opened them again. &quot;River,
do you know what you're doing?&quot;

&quot;Mine is a world of nine.&quot; She lifted a hand and placed a finger on Kaylee's
forehead, letting it linger, watching it slip under a strand of hair. &quot;Small
and limited. Mal is a wall. Inara is regret. Jayne is anger. Zoe and Wash are
each other. The preacher is secrets. Simon is my blood.&quot;

Kaylee felt her heart sink and she couldn't keep her eyes open.

&quot;And I'm the only one left?&quot;

Fingers closed on her cheek, drew patterns down her neck, Kaylee felt a face
hover very close to her own. A shiver ran through her, dark disappointment.

&quot;No Bao Bei.&quot; River's breath whispered onto her lips. &quot;You're peace. Green in
red. Tether. Hold me down. Make me free. My first choice.&quot;

As Kaylee opened her eyes, River leaned in again. Their lips met and softness
sparked between them, Kaylee hooked her fingers into the curve of River's
jawbone, drawing her closer, feeling the plushness of her lips.

Long after River fell asleep, nestled against her, Kaylee stared up at the
ceiling.

***

They played jacks in a corner of the cargo bay, comfortable in the bustle
around them. Jayne and Book were lifting weights, Mal and Zoe were shifting
cargo in preparation for the next day. If their hands lingered a little too
long in passing the ball, or their smiles were a little too shy and warm, no
one noticed.

&quot;Hey you two.&quot; Mal appeared before them. &quot;I need everyone in the dining room.
Got a few things to go over regarding Orpheus tomorrow.&quot;

River pulled her legs in under herself and stood up in a single graceful
movement. She gave Mal a disgusted look and curled her lip up at him.

&quot;Latin Mal.&quot;

&quot;Will you...&quot; She didn't stop to listen as she flounced away and Mal found
himself talking to her retreating back. &quot;... stop that?&quot;

Kaylee finished scrambling up.

&quot;Everything ok?&quot; She stuffed the jacks into a pocket of her coveralls.
&quot;Nothing's wrong is it?&quot;

&quot;No. Wash just got the final docking orders for tomorrow and I want to make
sure you both know what the job is.&quot;

And make sure they knew he did, reminding them over and over again that the job
was just to get the prescription and the name of a pharmacist who could provide
it. That was all, no gorram heroics, no getting noticed, nothing to put
themselves in danger. Inara went through the planet expectations, what to do,
where and how to do it, the safe places to shop, eat and live a daily life.
Jayne and Zoe watched, adding their comments when necessary. Zoe was still
hesitant about the plan and wouldn't admit it, but she was more than a little
envious of the time they'd spend planet side, with real baths. It irked her a
little that she couldn't be the one with Wash, but there wasn't anything she
could do about it. Wash and Kaylee were the only ones not associated with
Serenity in any of the cortex bulletins.

Serenity would break atmo early in the morning, when Inara would take Kaylee
and Wash to the house she'd rented in their assumed names, show them the
temporary job she'd arranged for Kaylee and the hospital that Wash would
hopefully be treated at, then she'd move on to a client she had booked. The
rest of the crew would then fly to a neighboring moon and dock there, there'd
be no flying without a pilot or a mechanic. There would be nothing to link
Serenity to the couple staying temporarily on planet. After Kaylee waved them
that the job was complete, Mal was ready with a contact to approach the doctor
that had the meds, even if the heist was investigated there would be nothing to
draw unnecessary attention to Wash and Kaylee.

Half way through the planning, Kaylee felt a hand on her shoulder, she bent her
head back to see River smiling dreamily down at her, she smiled back and then
the hand was gone, River floating away through the rest of the ship. When she
looked back at the table, Mal was watching her with a stony expression on his
face, she blushed and couldn't meet his eyes.

Simon ran through what was expected of Wash, how Kaylee would tell the doctors
he had a history of schizophrenic tendencies, with paranoia, delusions, altered
moods and some violent tendencies, that he had been taking medication, but
they'd been in space a long time without access to fill their prescription.
With any luck, a quick, cursory examination would provide them with what they
needed, but more likely would be that the doctors would want to evaluate him
and he'd be admitted. He showed them the files he had doctored for their false
names, made sure Kaylee was familiar with the details of it so that she could
answer questions.

***

Kaylee lined the cans and packets up on the bench, everything she'd need to
create an edible meal. Not delicious, not drool worthy, not full of fresh foods
and textures and taste. Dried, reconstituted mulch. It had been a while since
they'd restocked and everyone was a little tetchy about it. It was hard work
trying to get River to eat food out of cans.

The name was a thrill that went through her, a warm little secret, a kiss. She
was giddy with the thought of it, but terrified as well. Not for the first
time, she thought about Inara and female clients, the silky glide of skin on
skin, how it intrigued and titillated everyone on the ship. She wasn't fool
enough to believe they'd get the same reaction, her and River, more likely
guilt and blame and recrimination. Women with women were nothing to blink at
all the way out here, but River wasn't any woman and Kaylee should know better.

Distracted, she found herself smiling down at the cans, running a finger along
the rim of one, around and around. The markings caught her eye, a brand, the
ink declaring these foodstuffs brought to the 'Verse by the kindness of the
almighty Blue Sun. Blue. The link caused a flash in her brain, an electric
spasm that almost hurt.

&quot;Jayne?&quot;

He looked up from the table, hand pausing on his gun as he did so, the cloth
hanging limply.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;You remember when River cut you?&quot;

He grimaced.

&quot;Ain't like to forget it, why?&quot;

&quot;What shirt were you wearing?&quot;

&quot;That old Blue Sun one.&quot; He took on a thoughtful look. &quot;That reminds me, didn't
cost much, but the doc still owes me a shirt.&quot;

She met his eyes and showed him the logo on the cans.

&quot;You look better in red.&quot;

***

&quot;Confusion.&quot; River sat up straight, at attention, opening her mouth as Simon
shined his little torch to look inside, keeping her eyes straight as he shone
the torch in them as well, his face hovering close to hers. She was trying,
trying so hard, because he wanted it, because he deserved it. &quot;Disappointment.
You're sad.&quot;

&quot;I'm not sad, Mei Mei.&quot; But his voice was lying.

&quot;Because I'm broken.&quot; He snapped the torch off and began to write in his
clipboard, River's eyes followed his movements, she wished he'd tell her what
he saw, what atoms in her throat might hold the key. &quot;Because you wanted to be
the one to fix me.&quot;

Simon looked up at her, seeing for a moment the sister he knew was in there,
putting aside the patient he tried so hard to turn her into at times so that he
could continue her treatment without weeping. She was watching him, so tuned to
him that he wished he could lie to her and make her feel better, but knew that
was impossible. Her legs swung back and forth under the hem of her dress, bare
feet making arcs under the exam table, the innocence of it caught in his
throat.

&quot;You're frustrated,&quot; she continued. &quot;because you didn't know what the horses
meant, and you think Kaylee would have.&quot;

&quot;I don't...&quot; He bought a hand up to cup her chin. &quot;I wish you could just tell
me.&quot;

She rolled her neck, her head lolling in his hand and her eyes looked up at
him.

&quot;All the king's horses and all the king's men...&quot;

He saw the tears behind her eyes and wished he could cry for her. &quot;...
couldn't put Humpty together again.&quot; He finished for her softly. &quot;Oh, Mei
Mei...&quot;

But he had no more words.

&quot;It's too bright, Simon, and it's too loud and everyone wants a piece. They
want to help, but they keep shattering what's left.&quot; River folded into his arms
as he wrapped them around her. &quot;Kaylee sees a girl. She sees a River as a
River, not as droplets, not pieces.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; He whispered. &quot;I know.&quot;

&quot;Don't be mad, Simon.&quot;

&quot;I'm not mad, River.&quot; And suddenly he found he wasn't. &quot;I just want you to be
happy.&quot;

She bought her hand up and traced an outline on his cheek, she could see her
own hand print there, even though it had faded almost instantly the night
before. A sting that would fade in her head eventually.

&quot;You're a knight in shining armor. High on a steed.&quot; She gave him and saw the
corners of his mouth turn up. &quot;Saved me.&quot;

&quot;Simon?&quot; They both turned to Kaylee's voice. &quot;Can I talk to you a minute?&quot;

He followed Kaylee out of the infirmary, interested in the urgent secrecy in
her voice and at the same time a little annoyed at the interruption. She thrust
a food can in his hand and he glanced at it before looking up at her.

&quot;Kaylee? What...&quot;

&quot;The logo.&quot; She said, pointing at it. &quot;Blue Sun. Jayne was wearing his Blue Sun
shirt when she slashed him.&quot;

A tingle of memory rushed through his brain. River frantically tearing labels
off food cans and smashing packets, he and Book trying to calm her down and the
fear and anger he felt in her violent trembling at the time.

&quot;They're the ones.&quot; He met Kaylee's eyes. &quot;I didn't understand what she said,
when she said it. These are the ones that take you, reaching and doing.&quot;

They both glanced through the window of the infirmary, at River, who was
murmuring words at the ceiling, or possibly counting the tiles, or naming them.

&quot;Blue Sun.&quot; Kaylee pointed out. &quot;Blue Hands.&quot;

Simon's mouth hung open as he kept looking down at the can in his hands, at his
sister, at Kaylee in front of him.

&quot;What...?&quot; He was suddenly lost again, turned upside down. It was simple, too
simple. Why hadn't he seen it? She'd been trying to tell him for so long. &quot;I...
what?&quot;

&quot;There's not much we can do right now.&quot; Kaylee looked sad. &quot;It's not like we
can go raging into the Blue Sun corporation and it's not like we can stop
buying this stuff, we live on it.&quot;

Simon knew she was right, but he suspected they'd all have a little trouble
swallowing the canned food from here on out.

&quot;One more thing.&quot; Kaylee laid a hand on his arm, soft and supporting. Her eyes
were kind and he had a sudden flash that he wouldn't like whatever she had to
say. &quot;I want you to stop the sleeping pills.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;She doesn't like them, they make her lose control.&quot;

&quot;Kaylee.&quot; He was exhausted and beginning to get a little frustrated again. &quot;I
know you mean well, but I give them to her for a reason. You don't... you're
not there when she wakes up screaming, when she can barely breathe because of
the terror.&quot;

&quot;No more, Simon.&quot; Kaylee stared him down. &quot;I mean it. She can sleep in my bunk
if you don't want to deal with it, but she doesn't want them and she can't say
no to you.&quot;

He had to stifle his response to that and take a breath to keep his voice low
and steady. It confused him, five minutes ago he had all but given his blessing
to River and now, in front of Kaylee, who he truly believed he held no grudges
against, all his tension had returned.

&quot;That's easy for you to say.&quot; Cold and professional, he became the doctor
again, his only defense. &quot;You're leaving tomorrow. You're creating a pattern
for her that will be taken away. Have you even considered what that's going to
do to her?&quot;

By the look on her face, Simon knew she hadn't. A cruel streak inside him made
him continue.

&quot;There will be long periods of time when we have no contact with you and no way
of knowing if you're okay. You're walking into the world of the very people who
made her like his. She's going to worry, she's going to feel all our worries on
top of that and she won't be able to stop it or control it.&quot;

&quot;We're doing it for her.&quot; Kaylee managed to whisper. &quot;For her, Simon.&quot;

&quot;I know and I appreciate it.&quot; He backed down, suddenly aware that she was close
to tears and he may have pushed too hard. &quot;As long as she's okay, I'll lay off
the extra medication. But make no mistake, Kaylee, if she can't handle it, if
it's too much for her, I won't hesitate in giving her the sleeping tablets or
stronger.&quot;

She nodded.

&quot;Thank you, Simon.&quot;

He turned back to the infirmary and found River glaring at him.

***

Wash knew Zoe's mood wasn't his fault, not directly, her curt sentences and
quick temper were signs of her worry. He knew it and couldn't really blame her.
Now that the time had come, he was more than a little terrified himself.

&quot;Is it too hard to check your pockets before you put your clothes in the
laundry?&quot; She grumbled at him. &quot;I'm not asking for the world here.&quot;

He walked over to her, putting his arm around her waist and rubbing circles in
the small of her back as he drew her to him.

&quot;I love you, too.&quot;

Emotions flooded her and she couldn't resist the softening, melting into his
touch, she felt the smile on the corners of her mouth.

&quot;Yes. And if you get yourself killed, I will be angry.&quot;

&quot;Inconsolable.&quot; He corrected as he kissed her cheek, her forehead. &quot;A quivering
wreck.&quot;

&quot;On a rampage. Out for blood.&quot; She let him soothe away her tightness, loved
that he tended to her as if she were a precious thing. &quot;I will leave them
bloody.&quot;

&quot;There'll be rending of hair.&quot; He kissed the end of her nose, ran his hands
down her face, neck and shoulders. &quot;Weeping. Sobbing.&quot;

&quot;Be careful, please?&quot; She whispered before kissing him back.

***

River walked the halls, fingers trailing on the metal, she shivered as she
passed Wash and Zoe's bunk. It rolled over her like a wave, passion, anger,
fear, desperate love. Clinging, gasped breaths, a moan, faster, keep up, keep
you with me, hold you under my skin, need you, feel me, breathe me.

It made her stumble.

Goosebumps rising, she slipped into Kaylee's bunk, down the ladder and leaned,
panting hard, against the wall.

&quot;River!&quot; Kaylee was already on her feet. &quot;Are you ok?&quot;

&quot;Emotions.&quot; She whispered. &quot;Ocean emotions. Wash and Zoe.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot; An understanding smile came over Kaylee's face. &quot;Get the full brunt of
it, did ya?&quot;

River swallowed and nodded.

&quot;Yeah, I walked in on 'em, once, in the bridge.&quot; She chuckled. &quot;It was bracing.&quot;

Her breath was taken from her again. River was stunned, her mouth parting in
disbelief. Kaylee had taken her experience and equated it with one of her own
without blinking, made it normal. Made her whole again. It overwhelmed her.

&quot;Kaylee?&quot;

She trembled and Kaylee was there in seconds, wrapping her into her arms.

&quot;Oh, Sweetie, no.&quot; She didn't know what had caused it, didn't know how to fix
it, Kaylee settled for humor. &quot;What? The thought of a married couple isn't that
gross.&quot;

It worked, she felt River give a choked little giggle into her shoulder. Relief
flooded her veins. Simon wasn't far off the mark, Kaylee had never really faced
a bad episode and she was in no rush to change that.

&quot;Not gross.&quot; River corrected, lifting Kaylee's hand and placing it on her
chest, above the raging chasm of her heart. &quot;Exciting.&quot;

Kaylee felt the rapid beat under the pads of her fingertips.

&quot;That too.&quot;

Their eyes met and Kaylee felt a tingle run through her. There was very little
room for mistake in figuring out the look in River's eyes. Images invaded her
head, Simon drunk, men she'd been with, Inara and Councilor, Mal.

&quot;No.&quot; River took Kaylee's head in her hands. &quot;Don't bring them here. Just us.&quot;

&quot;Well, Genius.&quot; Kaylee smiled. &quot;That's the most intelligent thing you've said
all day.&quot;

She pulled River in for a kiss, feeling her lips part under her mouth. River's
hands flowed down from the side of her face to Kaylee's shoulders and down to
her waist. Kaylee gasped as she felt River pull her in, hip to hip, hard.

&quot;Let me.&quot; River said. &quot;My hands don't know.&quot;

Kaylee stood, compliant, as River ran her hands up Kaylee's arms, over her
fingers, stretching the webs between them, behind her shoulders and over the
knobs of her spine, down to the small of her back, around the swells of her
hips to the tops of her thighs and over the roundness of her belly.

She bit her lip, not wanting to intrude on the look of intense concentration
River had assumed. Kaylee wasn't sure how long she could stay still if River
continued exploring, if her hands rose under her shirt and it seemed very
likely that that was what she had planned.

&quot;Too many layers.&quot; River agreed.

River felt the rumble of Kaylee's laugh as she lifted her arms obediently,
allowing River to lift her shirt and toss it aside. Body shapes differ, River
thought, watching the fullness of Kaylee appear before her, comparing it to her
own sleek petite frame. Curiously, she watched the pink skin of her aureoles
pucker and become taut, reaching out to touch one. It made Kaylee shiver.

&quot;You're a tease, River Tam.&quot;

River smiled and laid her hand flat on Kaylee's breast, she leaned in
experimentally and kissed Kaylee on the mouth, on the cheek, along her jawline.
Kaylee was a writhing mass of energy and River felt the buzz flicker between
them, hot and loud, it was a growing crescendo and she wanted it to get so
large and so forceful that it drove everything out of her head. She wanted to
feel nothing but herself, be no one but herself.

Growling slightly, Kaylee could stand it no longer and raised her hands to
River's waist, small and delicate, she ran them up the sides of her breasts and
felt a sigh shudder out of the girl. She flattened her hands on River's back,
between her shoulders, feeling the hard knot at the top of her spine, pressing
her closer, she closed her own lips over River's neck.

&quot;Oh!&quot;

River gasped, shocked and trembling, she felt herself being pulled out of that
one spot, all her nerves drawn through her skin to Kaylee's mouth, the wet
sucking, tongue trailing, and everything in her anchored down by the arms
around her. She wanted to touch, to learn, to be touched. Kaylee's hands began
to bunch her dress, fists at her back, the cloth rising, she lifted her arms,
eyes watching Kaylee, and dipped out of the material, feeling cold air on her
skin.

They looked at each other for a moment, breathing, eyes wide, then they were
touching again. Hands on skin, running, smoothing, friction, heat. Mouths
collecting tastes from other mouths, shoulders, salt and soap. River's hand
strayed low on Kaylee's belly and suddenly her body recoiled.

&quot;Pain.&quot;

Her hand pressed flat against the scar and she saw the images from Kaylee's
head. Pain and confusion, blinding heat searing her abdomen, voices, shouting
and angry. River gasped to see Simon, wanted to shout at him for not helping
Kaylee straight away, she suddenly realized what Simon was bargaining for. The
swirling loss of consciousness, around and around, waking up with more
confusion. The Captain. A girl on the bed across from her, small and fragile.

River smiled in wonder.

&quot;You called me a beauty.&quot;

Kaylee smiled back.

&quot;What choice did I have?&quot;

***

Mal and Inara walked to her shuttle, ready to make the final checks. Wash was
giving Zoe last minute flying instructions and Kaylee was checking the engine
for the billionth time that morning.

They passed the common room to find Jayne, Book and Simon playing a game of
cards and River in the corner next to a table turned on it's side. She was
pouring a glass of water down the length of the surface, watching the small
trickle as it ran down.

&quot;River, what are you doing?&quot; Mal turned to Simon. &quot;Doc? What's your sister
doing?&quot;

River turned and smiled dreamily.

&quot;Rivers flow.&quot; She explained and turned back. &quot;Rivers flow.&quot;

The muscles in Mal's cheek twitched. He felt Inara's hand on his arm.

&quot;Yeah well, ain't that nice?&quot; He managed tightly. &quot;Doc, you see that's the last
glass she gets. We ain't docked safely yet and until we do there's not much
water in the tank to be throwing it on the floor.&quot;

He turned and headed back for the engine room.

&quot;Mal.&quot; Inara followed him. &quot;Don't...&quot;

Simon watched them leave, confused, then turned back to see River lift her hand
and touch the trickle, the water pooling and running over her fingers. She
smiled and laughed.

&quot;Kaylee flows too.&quot; She whispered.

Simon dropped his cards.

***

&quot;Kaylee!&quot; His voice carried through the ship and he didn't care. &quot;Kaylee!&quot;

&quot;Mal, wait.&quot; Inara pleaded with him, but he didn't stop to listen. &quot;You can't
just...&quot;

They reached the hallway in time to see Kaylee sticking her head around the
door. She saw them heading towards her and began to smile, until she saw Mal's
face.

&quot;Cap'n?&quot;

&quot;What the hell do you think you're doing, girl?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; His face was red and it scared Kaylee. &quot;I'm just checking the eng...&quot;

&quot;Don't play innocent with me, Kaylee.&quot;

She knitted her brow in confusion and looked at Inara for answers. What she got
was Inara mouthing the name River at her. Kaylee couldn't stop herself
blushing, she looked to the floor and took a step back.

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Oh.&quot; He glared. &quot;Exactly what do you think you're doing? And don't even
try to smile at me. It won't work. I know what I just saw and that girl is
glowing! I know what that means.&quot;

&quot;But she's happy.&quot; Kaylee breathed in and looked at them. &quot;And so am I.&quot;

&quot;This is a world of hurt waiting to happen.&quot; Mal clenched and unclenched his
hands. &quot;Nobody on this ship can afford complications, Kaylee, least of all the
doc and his sis.&quot;

&quot;They're both grown women.&quot; Inara pointed out, softly. &quot;And it's been happening
for a while, you can't just stop it now.&quot;

&quot;River may be of age, but that don't make her grown.&quot; Mal turned on Inara.
&quot;What do you mean a while?&quot;

Inara just rolled her eyes at him. She folded her arms and looked pointedly at
the engine room behind Kaylee. Mal turned and glanced at the empty room and he
was about to give Inara a puzzled glance when he suddenly stopped. He had just
realized that this was the first time since the big revelation that Kaylee had
been comfortably alone anywhere on Serenity outside of her own bunk. He sighed
and looked away and Inara smiled to herself. It had worked, he had calmed down
a little bit.

&quot;I just don't want to see anyone on my crew get hurt unnecessarily.&quot;

&quot;I ain't gonna hurt her!&quot; Kaylee was offended. &quot;How can you...?&quot;

&quot;She's not the only one that can get hurt.&quot; So many things he wanted her to see
that Mal didn't even know where to start. &quot;There are things about that girl
that nobody knows and she might be dangerous. She's a wanted fugitive. Wanted
by a government that will and have killed to get to her.&quot;

&quot;I know all that.&quot; Kaylee was calm and this time she met Mal's eyes. &quot;She ain't
gonna hurt me, either.&quot;

&quot;Do you really think this is a good idea?&quot; It's not like he really needed to
wait for her answer, Mal was not surprised when she nodded. &quot;Well, I've told
you my thoughts. I don't like it, but I can't stop you. I hope it goes well. I
don't like being the one to say I told you so...&quot;

&quot;Yes you do.&quot; Inara interrupted, smiling. &quot;You love it.&quot;

&quot;Well, yes I do.&quot; He admitted, trying not to smile himself. &quot;But not to my
