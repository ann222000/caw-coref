One of the founders of Algeria's "Armed Islamic Group" revealed in an
interview with Asharq al-Awsat that Usama Bin Laden gave monetary aid to
the Algerian fundamentalists beginning in 1992. That was when the
military government threw out the election results, in which the Islamic
Salvation Front had won a majority in parliament and repressed the
Muslim fundamentalists. Bin Laden wished to help the fundamentalists in
Algeria and hoped for overthrow of its secular-leaning government. He
was in contact with developments there via the "Afghans," returning
Algerian mujahidin who had fought the Soviets. These were called
"Afghans" in Algerian and were famous for actually wearing Afghan
clothing. Bin Laden's support, which took the form of money and weapons,
continued when the Armed Islamic Group hived off from FIS because of
internal differences.

Members of the Armed Islamic Group have been notable members of the
al-Qaida coalition, and some were involved in the Millennium Plot (as
French speakers they tended to congregate in Montreal).
