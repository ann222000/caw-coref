Hola Amigos

So, I survived America and made it out before my VISA expired, but I
cut it pretty close.  Here´s the story:
After the wonderful meal of Crawfish, a southern delicacy I suggest
you try if your ever in Louisiana, Art drove me into Laffeyette where
we found a bike shop, then he drove me to the texas border.  I realize
I cheated here, but worse is yet to come.  I rode a few miles into
Texas then stopped for the night in a yard full of mosquitos.  They
weren´t the smartest bugs though, none of them bit me.

The bike problems continued the next day as I pedalled down HWY 87.  I
got to the end of the road and it disappeared, turning into sand.  I
turned around preparing for a 20 km back track on a dwindling time
frame.  All of a sudden I heard that all too familiar hiss sound of a
flat tire.  I groaned but had no choice but to fix it.  As I was
pumping it up matters got worse.  The tire exploded, leaving me
stranded.  I gave up at this point and stuck out my thumb again.  A
truck already loaded with people, inside and out picked me up and
through my gear in the back, dropping me off at a gas station where a
mexican man drove me a little farther down the road.  He dropped me
off at another gas station where I stayed the night, pitched behind
the building.  I made some money that night as well, playing my drum.
I managed to pull 100$ out of my hat.  I was pretty happy with that.

At this point I had 5 days left on my visa, and at least a 10 day ride
ahead of me, so I was in a hurry.  I am not a religious person, but
what happened next made me think twice.  I was pedalling hard, in the
beating sun, fighting the wind praying;  praying for someone to stop
and help me out.  And someone did.  An RV pulled up in front of me and
a man got out.  He had white hair, a white beard and was dressed in
very plain clothes.  i was sure he was Jesus, and asked if he was.  He
said no, but asked me if I wanted a ride.  It was a miracle.  I
through everything inside the RV and he drove me to Galvaston where I
found some wonderful tubes in the bike shop.  they are very thick and
supposedly prevent flats very well.  So far so good.  I biked till
almost midnight after being dropped off and pitched my tent in a
church yard, far too tired to eat more than a few hand fulls of
peanuts.

I started thumbing rides at 8 AM.  The first ride got me 9 miles, the
second about 200 miles into Corpus Christi.  The man said I had a kind
face, which is why he picked me up.  I got back on the bike after he
took me out for lunch in Corpus and headed down the road.  And I didn
´t stop.  At all.  I biked all night through the desert under the
almost full moon.  trucks roared down the road all night, but most of
the traffic ceased after 11 ish.

I made it to Progresso, Texas, right on the border by the next night
and went to the 3 diamonds hotel.  A little smooth talking and I
managed to get the room for free, which I was thouroughly grateful
for.  I ate a pile of food and crashed.  24 hours on a hard bike seat
will do that to you.

I left the hotel late in the morning of march 1st, bound for
Brownsville, texas, where I stayed in another cheap hotel.  That day I
tried to cross the border at Progresso and Los Indios, but was turned
around both times because I didn´t have my visa forms, which I needed
to get in Brownsville at the Mexican Consulate.  I also met 2 cyclists
that day, snowbirds from up north on a day tour from thier RV camp.
It was neat to bike with someone again.

March 2nd, the day of reckoning, I got to the consulate early, only to
find out that It didn´t open till 9...So i waited 2 hours.  I got my 6
month visa without a hitch and headed to the border and crossed the
Rio Grande for the last time into Matamoros, Mexico just in the nick
of time.  I got myself a hotel room.  80 pesos (8$ USD) a night got me
a faded pink 8X12 room, 1 bed (1 sheet and 1 pillow included), a
table, a sink with brown water, a fan but no plug in, a burnt out
light bulb and just enough room for me and my bike.  I was in heaven.
I sat there, on the bed near the open window in the breeze during the
hottest part of the day, reading a book, surveyor of all that is
mine.  I crashed early that night instead of going out for beer.

The next day was a day off.  I slept in, hung out, had a shower,
walked around town, played my drum for the tourists ate lots of cheap
street food and went to bed early again.  Life was good.

After 2 days of chilling in Matamoros I decided I wanted to head into
Mexico.  I left town and was greeted 20 km in by a checkpoint, at
which I flashed my passport, showed off my visa and was waved through
without even saying a word.  That night I camped off to the side of
the road, hidden in the cactuses.  It got cold enough that night to
freeze my water bottles.

In San Fernando the next day I was flagged down by some students.
They gave me the message that I shouldn´t go south.  they made many
hand signals to me depicting guns and shooting and they ran thier
hands across thier necks several times, but I kept going.

When you can´t speak the language it makes it difficult for things to
happen on the road.  most of my experiences so far have had to do with
meeting people and talking and doing things with them, but so far, I
haven´t met anyone on the road worth noting.  It´s been a very lonely
time biking.  Most of my conversations happen at gas stations when i
buy water or at road side food stands buying fruit.  Im not
complaining by any stretch of the imagination though, this is great.
I am slowly learning a few more spanish words every day and increasing
my vocabulary.  I keep my Spanish-English Dictionary in my pocket all
the time and pull it out at every chance.  the locals think its the
funniest thing when I do, but that´s OK, im glad I can make them
laugh.

I have gotten into a new schedule here in Mexico.  I get up around 630
AM when the sun comes out, make food, pack up and hit the road around
8 or so.  My watch beeps for 10 AM and the wind slaps me in the face,
every day, never failing.  Around 2 or so it is too hot for a northern
Gringo like me bike, so I find a tree and pull off to the side of the
road, have lunch, read, nap, work on things, or do whatever I feel
like until the clouds come out around 3 PM.  Then I bike till 6 and
camp.  It´s very simple.  Life is good.

So anyways, March 7th, around 6 Pm I wandered down a back road trying
to find a spot to camp.  i went through a gate, down a path, down
another path, through a forest and came upon a house.  It was a huge
house randomly placed in the back woods.  It had banana trees growing
in its yard as well as oranges, which I indulged in.  The house itself
was amazing.  set in almost solid marble, it was very beautiful, and
completely abandoned.  I asked a man the next day as he rode his horse
passed if it was for sale and he told me to inquire in Tampico, which
is where I am now.  I would stop biking if I could buy that house for
a cheap proice and fix it.  Im truely in love with that building.
But, alas, I probably wont get it.

So yesterday I made it into Tampico.  I milled around town most of the
day trying to find a hotel and ended up at one for 150 pesos a night.
I´ll be moving to a cheaper one tomorow downtown in the market.  I am
looking forward to the rest of Mexico, and with a 6 month visa in
hand, i´ll be taking my time, so expect many adventures in the coming
months.

In my next update Ill add some final words about the USA, but for now,
i have 1 minute on my time at this computer, so I must go.

A message for Will in Virginia Beach:  You bet your sweet as I am.

Paz y Amores Amigos
