OK, you guys seem to know it all (that's not intended as a slight)
91 Plymouth Laser (I know, dodge truck NG, but it is a chrysler product, and
I do own a dodge truck, and well, you guys know it all).
Constant clear liquid around the battery, especially around the top vents,
very corrosive.  No, the battery does not have a leak
Battery was three years old, exchanged with another three year old battery,
same thing, clear liquid around battery.  Constantly adding water to the
battery.
Removed regulator from the car, set it up on the test bench, regulator turns
on (alternator) at 13.8 volts and turns off (the alternator field winding)
at 14.2 volts (at about 70 degrees F).  Battery voltage measured at the
alternator/regulator, is the same as the voltage measured at the battery.
This vehicle uses a separate wire to measure the battery voltage for the
regulator, tests OK (same voltage at either end of the wire).
With the car running, the measured output voltage of the alternator is 14.2
volts.  Manual says voltage should be between 13.9 and 14.9 volts
Question is, why am I boiling the batteries.  Car runs fine, starts OK, no
other problems.

are you measuring the running-charging-voltage at BOTH battery terminals, or
between positive and engine ground ?

Alright genius, how is that going to make any difference.  At best, the
voltage between the battery positive and the engine ground will be HIGHER
than at both terminals of the battery while the alternator is working.  Do
you need a lesson on the current path during charging too?

You have to take into account that your problem may be intermittent.  Just
because the regulator behaves normally while on the bench or while idling in
the driveway doesn't mean that it or it's wiring is ok.  You will need to
keep a voltmeter connected in the car with you for a while to monitor it.
If it has a peak hold capability, that would be best but otherwise, you will
need to keep it in a place where you can see it without taking you eyes off
of the road any more than you would to look at any other gauge.  Another
thing to think of is that it is not voltage that causes a battery to vent
and spit fluid, it is current and high current can flow on both sides such
as bad turns in the starter.  I would probably look at the sense wire for
the regulator and make sure that it is in-tact and has a good solid
connection to whatever power source it is tapping from.  A bad wire or
connection here can cause your problems for sure.

Good point about that intermittent, a bad sense point for example on the
regulator, say when it heats up, could definitely cause the overcharge
problem.
And for the record, I measured the battery voltage at the positive terminal
of the battery, and at the regulator plug, with reference to chassis ground,
maybe I should have used engine ground, technically they are the same.

The "sense" lead runs through 2 fuses (both good) from the battery.

I'll have to hunt around for a peak hold volt meter
Are you suggesting that an over current drawing, starter motor could also
cause the battery to spit?

Thanks T bone for the helpful comments.

No problem.  Another thing that you might want to look at is if something is
now constantly drawing current from the battery such as a glove compartment
or trunk light that is stuck on and causing the battery to deep cycle.  This
will also cause excessive current flow in the battery while charging that
could cause venting.  A bad starter winding could have a similar effect.
During your tests, put a current meter between the battery and it's positive
connection with everything as you would have it while parked at night and
see how much current is being drawn.  It should be close to if not zero and
if not, you need to find out what is drawing it.

Really? Unless the battery has a dead cell, voltage across the terminals has
every possibility of being higher than battery positive to ground. Typically
(remember that lesson you wanted to hand out?) there will be more resistance
in a circuit that across the terminals themselves.

Gary is simply trying to establish if that possible resistance is causing
the VR to keep charging the battery when it shouldn't.

Maybe you should shut up unless you have something construcive to add.

He's definitely suggesting it, but I think its a real stretch to have that
happen. If a starter drew that many amps and still functioned properly, it
would lead to the conclusion that the battery was far too small. Of course,
you haven't mentioned either the load or the size of the battery, so thats a
possibility from where I sit. However, you seem to have a handle on it, so
thats a question you should have an easy answer for.

&gt;&gt; keep a voltmeter connected in the car with you for a while to monitor it.
&gt;&gt; If it has a peak hold capability, that would be best but otherwise, you
&gt; will
&gt;&gt; need to keep it in a place where you can see it without taking you eyes
&gt; off
&gt;&gt; of the road any more than you would to look at any other gauge.  Another
&gt;&gt; thing to think of is that it is not voltage that causes a battery to vent
&gt;&gt; and spit fluid, it is current and high current can flow on both sides
&gt;&gt; such
&gt;&gt; as bad turns in the starter.  I would probably look at the sense wire for
&gt;&gt; the regulator and make sure that it is in-tact and has a good solid
&gt;&gt; connection to whatever power source it is tapping from.  A bad wire or
&gt;&gt; connection here can cause your problems for sure.

Sure it makes a difference, in one case there is no resistance possible, in
the other you open the possibility to all sorts of resistance. Certainly the
voltage you list is acceptable to the system, thats not the issue. The
question is whether or not the battery was designed with this in mind
(likely it was), whether or not the battery is being accurately monitored by
the VR, and whether the battery is big enough to sustain the draw of the
starter under normal conditions and the charging of the system under normal
conditions. No doubt that the battery voltage "WILL  NEVER BE HIGHER" under
a charging condition, however, we're still open on the issue of whether or
not the VR is seeing the same voltage as what can be found across the
terminals.

Terrific, and since the Alternator is putting out specified voltage, it must
be grounded just fine.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; TO THE BATTERY, not the voltage of the battery itself.  Pay attention for
&gt; a
&gt; change Maxi.
">

Ahh yes, pay attention yourself. How does the charging system determine
output voltage? Thats right, it monitors battery voltage. So while we are
concerned with the voltage being "applied" (charging voltage) we also need
to figure out how that voltage was determined. As such, since the VR seems
to behave properly on a bench test, we must then look at the switching
voltage it sees and determine if that accurately reflects the actual voltage
of the battery. (Funny, if you read it, the OP did EXACTLY this test!!)
THUS.... Gary asks the question, "Are you measuring battery voltage between
the terminals, or from positive to ground?" A perfectly valid question,
since we want to know how accurate the info regarding the battery voltage
is. It matters not what the output voltage of the alternator is, so long as
its in spec, and is switched properly. If the alternator is putting out
14.2v but the VR isn't getting a proper reading of battery voltage and sees
it as too low, then we have a great place to find overcharging.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No he isn't and that makes absolutely no sense at all.  If the VR was

">

Unless of course, that little "intermittant" word (you do remember bringing
it up?) creeps in and blows your whole theory. But lets assume its a
constant..... if the VR never sees 14.2, but does see a constant lower
voltage, say... 14.0v, it'll keep charging that battery at a rate designed
to bring it up just a bit, but never sees it come up.

You can sputter away all you like, the big variables here are the condition
of the wiring, how much voltage the VR sees, and how accurate the readings
taken have been.

1) Having checked the VR sensing wire, I'd check connections and other
details of how it sees battery voltage.
2) I'd also check to be sure battery size is matched to maximum draw, just
to cover your theory on too high a draw by the starter.
3) Anything else that was drawing enough current to heat up the battery has
to be more than a glove box lamp etc. Generally that size draw will drain
the battery long before boiling it.
4) The OP has determined that the VR swiotches properly, but I'd test
installed voltage on the VR to see if its performing the same while in the
vehicle.
5) Given that battery and charging ALT voltage should be the same, I'd check
both the battery (terminal to terminal) and alternator output terminal to
CASE, not block etc. If they are th same, and not over spec, I'd look at the
VR for problems in switching.

I'm betting this is a deal where something in the wiring is giving a false
reading. Which was where Gary was going, and I'll bet you are too.

&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; voltage between the battery positive and the engine ground will be
&gt;&gt; &gt; HIGHER
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than at both terminals of the battery while the alternator is

&gt;&gt; &gt; Do

&gt; &gt; LOL, you really don't have a clue.  If the alternator is CHARGING or

at
&gt; &gt; the battery terminals will NEVER BE HIGHER.  Measuring from the battey
&gt; &gt; positive to ground or the negative terminal makes no difference in this
&gt; &gt; case.  14.2V is acceptable from either location.

&gt; Sure it makes a difference, in one case there is no resistance possible,
in
&gt; the other you open the possibility to all sorts of resistance. Certainly
the
&gt; voltage you list is acceptable to the system, thats not the issue. The
&gt; question is whether or not the battery was designed with this in mind
&gt; (likely it was), whether or not the battery is being accurately monitored
by
&gt; the VR, and whether the battery is big enough to sustain the draw of the
&gt; starter under normal conditions and the charging of the system under
normal
&gt; conditions.
">

LOL, it is fun to watch you spin.  Resistance is not only possible, it is a
guarantee unless you have invented the perfect material to make your
connections and wires out of.  As for the battery being accuratly monitored,
LOL.  If the voltage is within spec, that is all that matters.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; No doubt that the battery voltage &quot;WILL  NEVER BE HIGHER&quot; under
&gt; a charging condition, however, we're still open on the issue of whether or

Who cares what the VR sees across the terminals.  The only thing that
matters is what the voltage actually is.  If it is sitting at 14.2, then the
VR is function properly, despite your spin.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; That is correct but since we are charging, the alternator is the source
of
&gt; &gt; the voltage, not the battery and since the alternator grounds thru its
&gt; &gt; case,
&gt; &gt; the output terminals are the alt output connection (+) and the engine
&gt; &gt; block
&gt; &gt; (-), not the battery.

&gt; Terrific, and since the Alternator is putting out specified voltage, it
must
&gt; be grounded just fine.

Never said otherwise.  Is this more spin???  If so, then you just spun
yourself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; BTW, we are concerned about the voltage being applied
&gt; &gt; TO THE BATTERY, not the voltage of the battery itself.  Pay attention
for
&gt; &gt; a
&gt; &gt; change Maxi.

&gt; Ahh yes, pay attention yourself. How does the charging system determine
&gt; output voltage? Thats right, it monitors battery voltage.
">

Actually, no it doesn't.  It monitors system voltage and could give a rats
ass about the battery.  Once running, the battery does little more than to
act like a giant filter cap to smooth out the mess of crap comming out of
the alternator and to serve as a reserve if and when the current
requirements exceed the alternators capability at a given time, especially
in an older vehicle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; So while we are
&gt; concerned with the voltage being &quot;applied&quot; (charging voltage) we also need
&gt; to figure out how that voltage was determined.
">

LOL, we need do no such thing, at least not as far as what the OP said he is
concerned with.  14.2V is 14.2V regardless of where the measurment is taken,
especially with regard to ground.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As such, since the VR seems
&gt; to behave properly on a bench test, we must then look at the switching
&gt; voltage it sees and determine if that accurately reflects the actual
voltage
&gt; of the battery. (Funny, if you read it, the OP did EXACTLY this test!!)
&gt; THUS.... Gary asks the question, &quot;Are you measuring battery voltage
between
&gt; the terminals, or from positive to ground?&quot; A perfectly valid question,
&gt; since we want to know how accurate the info regarding the battery voltage
&gt; is. It matters not what the output voltage of the alternator is, so long
as
&gt; its in spec, and is switched properly. If the alternator is putting out
&gt; 14.2v but the VR isn't getting a proper reading of battery voltage and
sees
&gt; it as too low, then we have a great place to find overcharging.

Hahahahahahahahaha, you really don't have a clue.  The voltage is 14.2V
BECAUSE the VR set it there.

&gt; &gt; No he isn't and that makes absolutely no sense at all.  If the VR was

&gt; &gt; 14.2 at the alternator output which is ALWAYS the same or higher than
the
&gt; &gt; voltage at the battery terminals under CHARGE conditions.  If the 14.2
&gt; &gt; was
&gt; &gt; measured at the battery terminals themselves, it is still within
accepted

output.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

LOL, you really are kidding, right?!?!?  The purpose of the VR is not now

perhaps you should look into why it is really needed.

Once again, you prove your ignorance.  It is not the current draw from the
battery that boils the fluid or more likely causes venting.  It is the
significantly increased current draw by the battery itself trying to
recharge from a significant discharge state due to that small current draw
over a long time that causes venting and venting can cause it to spit fluid,
especially if the battery is being jostled while it is venting.  This is how
a defective starter can also cause venting beyond the short duration of the

And you've determined this how? I don't recall any specs being published,

The OP is concerned with his battery being cooked. Thus we DO need to know
how the VR is determining system voltage, and what that system voltage is
relative to the battery. Remember, you first claimed that battery voltage
and output voltage had to be the same, then you claimed resistance existed
in any circuit. So, we're back to my original claim, better check ALL
circuits in the charging system and make sure all are intact and functioning
properly.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Hahahahahahahahaha, you really don't have a clue.  The voltage is 14.2V

I do have a clue. I'll repeat myself so you can figure it out. Yes, the VR
sets the voltage, BUT, how it determines the output of the alternator relies
on a circuit that reads system voltage, so..... if that circuit is not
functioning properly, and the output exceeds demand, it'll cook the battery.
I'm not sure whats so hard for you to grasp here. I've repeatedly said that
the VR has to have a good reference voltage, if it does not, it'll call for
more output than is needed. It doesn't get any easier than this. Despite the
OP having checked the reference voltage circuit, I'd bet something is wrong
in that or the VR.

Oh thats right, it means that the VR could jack up the output while no one

As you previously said, the battery acts as a filter. Thus, if that filter

it up. Careful, you are starting to flip flop pretty badly here.

I'm done here, I explained where I thought the problem is, you flip flopped
a bit in trying to prove me wrong, then said exactly what I did using a
different method. Then, you did what I figured you would, and tried to argue
about your insulting manner, despite claiming you wouldn't continue.

As before, the last word is yours. You cannot resist.

I never said that it was.  You really need to stop spinning.  I said that
the voltage between the terminals cannot be higher than the voltage between
the positive terminal and the block because the batteries ground connection
is made at the block by one of those wire that has resistance and the
voltage he measured was 14.2V, within spec.

If it wasn't working, the voltage would either be battery voltage (no

Actually, the measured voltage at the batteries terminals is the same as the
system voltage, while the actual battery voltage is lower, you do know that,
right????  If the system and battery voltage were the same, the battery
would never charge.  Your comment about properly checking battery voltage is
just another example of you not knowing WTF you are talking about.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; LOL, we need do no such thing, at least not as far as what the OP said
he
&gt; &gt; is

&gt; &gt; especially with regard to ground.

&gt; The OP is concerned with his battery being cooked. Thus we DO need to know
&gt; how the VR is determining system voltage, and what that system voltage is

We need do no such thing.  The required voltage needs to be between 13.9 and
14.9 and it was measured to be 14.2, well within spec.  If the battery is
being cooked at that voltage, the problem lies elsewhere.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You just don't get it.  How many circuits do you think exist in the charging

so low as to have no measurable effect.  If the voltage is within spec, it

battery.

LOL, if the output exceeded the demand for whatever reason, then the voltage
would be high, much higher than the 14.2 that he measured.  Like I said, you
really don't have a clue.  You really need to do a little reading and
understanding of simple DC circuits.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm not sure whats so hard for you to grasp here. I've repeatedly said
that

the
&gt; OP having checked the reference voltage circuit, I'd bet something is
wrong

I have to say Max that you really make me laugh.  I really hope that you
have a much better understanding of transmissions.  If the VR called for
more output than is needed, the voltage would rise and rise above the
maximum spec as that is the only way the alternator can put out more power
than is required.  Since the voltage measured is well within the expected
range, the VR is working properly at the time of measure.

&gt; Oh thats right, it means that the VR could jack up the output while no one

random

Yea, it could happen and possibly might.  A bad or temperature sensitive
connection on the voltage sense wire could cause this very thing and has
nothing to do with the 14.2 being a random reading, LOL.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; LOL, you really are kidding, right?!?!?  The purpose of the VR is not
now
&gt; &gt; nor has it ever been to precisely monitor or control the charging of the

&gt; &gt; responding.  Here is a hint.  Although the action of the VR is in its
&gt; &gt; name,
&gt; &gt; perhaps you should look into why it is really needed.

&gt; As you previously said, the battery acts as a filter. Thus, if that filter
&gt; is below its normal level, it will lower system voltage, unless the VR
jacks
&gt; it up. Careful, you are starting to flip flop pretty badly here.
">

There is no flip flopping except for either your imagination, complete lack
of understanding, or a lame attempt at deception.  Since the voltage is
steady ar 14.2 during his test, I would think that the VR did bump the alt
output to bring the system voltage to expected levels.  This is the real
purpose of the VR, to control the output of the alt to deal with a changing
load and output of the alt, not to baby or specifically charge the battery.
The battery is just another load that the alt has to deal with.  BTW, what
exactly are you trying to get at here???

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) Having checked the VR sensing wire, I'd check connections and other
&gt; &gt;&gt; details of how it sees battery voltage.

&gt; &gt; With the exception of the VR sensing wire, the rest of what you said
means
&gt; &gt; nothing, especially since the VR sensing wire IS how it sees the
voltage.

&gt; So now it DOES see battery voltage?  And I'm sure that you somehow KNOW
that
&gt; this VR is not connected in any way to an ECM? Better check those
&gt; details......

It see's battery voltage until the engine starts, then it sees system
voltage as does the battery.  Since this is a 91 Laser, I doubt that the ECM
has a whole lot to do with it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) I'd also check to be sure battery size is matched to maximum draw,
&gt; &gt;&gt; just
&gt; &gt;&gt; to cover your theory on too high a draw by the starter.

&gt; &gt; While that is not a bad idea, a bad starter will have the same effect as
&gt; &gt; too
&gt; &gt; small of a battery and even in a defective state, may still have enough
&gt; &gt; umph
&gt; &gt; to start the car.

&gt; Right, but will it draw current long enough to boil the battery? Seriously
&gt; unlikely, unless there are details we weren't given.

No, but it could hammer the battery down far enough that it will require
added current to recover and the two combined could cause venting.  I didn't
say that is the problem, only that it is a possibility.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; Once again, you prove your ignorance.

Now the only one spinning is you.  These are just possibilities.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; It is not the current draw from the
&gt; &gt; battery that boils the fluid or more likely causes venting.  It is the
&gt; &gt; significantly increased current draw by the battery itself trying to

draw
&gt; &gt; over a long time that causes venting and venting can cause it to spit

&gt; &gt; how
&gt; &gt; a defective starter can also cause venting beyond the short duration of
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; start.

&gt; So now, after seeing that the system voltage was sitting at 14.2, you are

&gt; &gt; we
&gt; &gt; are not talking about percision regulation of voltage or frequency
&gt; &gt; (switching) here.  The average voltage is all that matters and if it is

&gt; &gt; spec, then it is working.

&gt; Is it in spec? Is it ALWAYS in spec? what IS that spec?

No shit, and this is what I was saying all along.  The voltage however, DOES
NOT have to be measured across the terminals in this case because as your
examples have clearly demonstrated, the voltage will not be higher at the
battery than at these other measurement points and we are looking for an
OVER VOLTAGE condition at the battery.  As for the battery being shot, that
possibility has been substantially reduced as the OP indicated that this
condition is occurring with more than one battery so unless both of them are
shot (although still a possibility), the problem seems to lie elsewhere.

What do you think could cause that Gary?  The only thing that can cause over
current thru a good battery at full charge when the alt is operating is
excess VOLTAGE and if you don't know that then you have some studying to do.
Where he took the measurements will have the highest voltage and since it is
within spec, over voltage is not the problem at the time of measurement
because there is no way that the voltage at the battery could be higher than
where he took the measurement.  Now a bad connection in the VR sensing wire
could cause it to spike up the voltage for periods of time while driving
which would cause excessive battery current or it could also be something
sucking power during non-use periods causing the battery to deep cycle which
would also cause excessive current flow during normal charging for a
standard automotive battery but neither one of these conditions are going to
be found by where you take the measurement.  Sorry, but you are still wrong.

LOL, every time I read this from you, it just makes me laugh harder.  How
exactly is the VR going to know if the battery needs charging or that the

Maxi, is that it can't and fortunately, it doesn't have to.  All it needs to
do is keep the voltage with a given set of parameters and the system will
take care of itself, including the battery.

And the ONLY two things that can cause overcurrent through the battery
with the engine running and the battery being charged (which it
obviously is at 14.2 volts) are too high a charging voltage (which it
is not, at 14.2 volts) or a defective battery.

If the voltage was below 12.6, I'd agree you might POSSIBLY have a
load problem - but it would, in my opinion, have to be significantly
lower - like 11 or so.

&gt;&gt; You have to take into account that your problem may be intermittent.
&gt;&gt; Just
&gt;&gt; because the regulator behaves normally while on the bench or while idling
&gt; in
&gt;&gt; the driveway doesn't mean that it or it's wiring is ok.  You will need to
&gt;&gt; keep a voltmeter connected in the car with you for a while to monitor it.
&gt;&gt; If it has a peak hold capability, that would be best but otherwise, you
&gt; will
&gt;&gt; need to keep it in a place where you can see it without taking you eyes
&gt; off
&gt;&gt; of the road any more than you would to look at any other gauge.  Another
&gt;&gt; thing to think of is that it is not voltage that causes a battery to vent
&gt;&gt; and spit fluid, it is current and high current can flow on both sides
&gt;&gt; such
&gt;&gt; as bad turns in the starter.  I would probably look at the sense wire for
&gt;&gt; the regulator and make sure that it is in-tact and has a good solid
&gt;&gt; connection to whatever power source it is tapping from.  A bad wire or
&gt;&gt; connection here can cause your problems for sure.

&gt;&gt; &gt; With the car running, the measured output voltage of the alternator is

Sorry to have caused such grief here at the NG.
My son just called, the car wouldn't start on it's own, but jump started OK.
Tomorrow I'll bring the car home (I'll be putting a new battery in it for
the drive home as the second battery (from my father-in-laws Ram Charger
(360 CID)won't start the car now) and start testing some of your solutions.
I plan on monitoring the 1. battery voltage (across the terminals), and 2.
the "sense" lead voltage (at the alternator, using the alternator ground),
on the trip home, on two different digital volt meters.  It's about a thirty
mile drive, so something should show up.
Anything else I might want to check for on the drive home.
On a passing note, would using the old battery for the drive home be a
better idea, and keep the new one incase I need a jump start.

Thanks

Thats terrific. Unless it doesn't work, like the OP's vehicle. So while you
are busy trying to show off how much you know about how it works, I'm
telling you to find the problem that makes it not work. And its obviously
not working, because its boiling the battery.

Let us know when you come to a conclusion as to what the problem is, because
at least three of us have said to do a better and more thorough check of the
wiring and componants before going any further.

Meanwhile, you've "taught" us how the system works about five times. Thats
great, but this particular system is NOT working properly. So instead of
jabbering about how it SHOULD work, develop a troubleshooting procedure, and
FIX the goddamnned thing.

We'll wait.

Excellent point. One that would be found if the OP disregarded Tbones
insistance that checking across the terminals is unnecessary. 1) A static
check after sitting a while would show a low voltage, thus enhancing Tbones
idea of too much starter draw. 2) A check WHILE charging would confirm
proper voltage to the battery. 3) a check after being charged, and another
an hour later would indicate battery condition. 4) a load test wouldn't
hurt.

All of these depend on checking across the terminals, not to ground and the
positive terminal. But hey, all three of us are full of crap.

&gt; &gt; Good point about that intermittent, a bad sense point for example on the

&gt; &gt; And for the record, I measured the battery voltage at the positive
&gt; &gt; terminal
&gt; &gt; of the battery, and at the regulator plug, with reference to chassis
&gt; &gt; ground,
&gt; &gt; maybe I should have used engine ground, technically they are the same.

&gt; &gt; The &quot;sense&quot; lead runs through 2 fuses (both good) from the battery.

also

&gt; &gt;&gt; You have to take into account that your problem may be intermittent.
&gt; &gt;&gt; Just
&gt; &gt;&gt; because the regulator behaves normally while on the bench or while
idling
&gt; &gt; in
&gt; &gt;&gt; the driveway doesn't mean that it or it's wiring is ok.  You will need
to
&gt; &gt;&gt; keep a voltmeter connected in the car with you for a while to monitor
it.
&gt; &gt;&gt; If it has a peak hold capability, that would be best but otherwise, you
&gt; &gt; will
&gt; &gt;&gt; need to keep it in a place where you can see it without taking you eyes
&gt; &gt; off
&gt; &gt;&gt; of the road any more than you would to look at any other gauge.
Another
&gt; &gt;&gt; thing to think of is that it is not voltage that causes a battery to
vent
&gt; &gt;&gt; and spit fluid, it is current and high current can flow on both sides
&gt; &gt;&gt; such
&gt; &gt;&gt; as bad turns in the starter.  I would probably look at the sense wire
for
&gt; &gt;&gt; the regulator and make sure that it is in-tact and has a good solid
&gt; &gt;&gt; connection to whatever power source it is tapping from.  A bad wire or
&gt; &gt;&gt; connection here can cause your problems for sure.

&gt; &gt;&gt; will give a higher reading than across the battery.

&gt; &gt;No shit, and this is what I was saying all along.  The voltage however,

Don't worry about it, this crap happens all of the time.  You can use the
new battery and have someone closely monitor the voltage on the ride home.
The last thing that you want to do is cook a new battery.

Maybe you should as well. "Reasonably high" isn't a technical term anyone
here recognizes as something specific. I'd say you are waffling, and had. A
battery charging voltage of 14.2 has little or nothing to do with the actual
current flowing in the battery, as you've so eloquently stated time after
time. Thus, I'm not sure why you bothered to use it as a reason for the
battery getting a "reasonably high current". The "huge draw from the
starter" is likewise unmeasured.

You have no idea what the particular starter is drawing, and it seems like
you don't know what an actual starter draws period. Most starters do not
draw near what the battery is rated for on a constant draw. Initial spike
might exceed battery rating, but in a well designed and maintained system,
this too is unlikely. Further, unless the vehicle is particularly hard
starting, starter draw is for short period of time, and will not induce
battery boiling.

Even your claim that recharging after a long draw and then a short "huge
draw" (WTFIT??) is suspect, as the system design takes into account the
battery in that system, and is designed NOT to cook the battery.

So once again, you've discussed things that are irrelevant.

&gt; &gt; Wrong!  If something is pulling a reasonable current from the battery
&gt; &gt; constantly (like 150 to 500 mills), between that and the huge draw from
&gt; &gt; the
&gt; &gt; starter followed by a 14.2 voltage being applied to it, it can send a
&gt; &gt; reasonably high current into the battery for a fairly long period of
time.
&gt; &gt; Perhaps you should learn a little something about batteries.

&gt; Maybe you should as well. &quot;Reasonably high&quot; isn't a technical term anyone
&gt; here recognizes as something specific. I'd say you are waffling, and had.

That is because you are trying to hide from being wrong, as usual.  I am
using relative terms because I don't know the specific values and neither do
you.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; A battery charging voltage of 14.2 has little or nothing to do with the
actual
&gt; current flowing in the battery, as you've so eloquently stated time after

I said no such thing and 14.2 volts has EVERYTHING to do with how much
current is flowing into the battery along with the batteries state of
charge.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Thus, I'm not sure why you bothered to use it as a reason for the
&gt; battery getting a &quot;reasonably high current&quot;.
">

The state of charge determins how much current will flow into the battery at
a given voltage and if the battery is already weakened by an unintended
prolonged current draw from something like an illuminated glove compartment
light, the added pull from the starter will make it worse

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; The &quot;huge draw from the starter&quot; is likewise unmeasured.

LOL, there is no need to specifically measure it as it is only compounding
the problem in this possible cause of the problem.

Gee Max, near ratings and might exceed ratings are not exactly technical
terms anyone here recognizes as something specific either so as is said many
times to you, PKB!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

wrong by showing it to be MUCH lower.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Even your claim that recharging after a long draw and then a short &quot;huge

Yea Max, under normal conditions you would be right but that constant draw
is not a normal condition and unless the person is using a deep cycle
battery, the battery is not designed for that either.

&gt; &gt; What are you talking about here?  A battery voltage of 12.6 or a system
&gt; &gt; voltage of 12.6?

You should be the last person to say this when it is obvious that you don't

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Are you so sure about that?  Depending on the battery type, 12.6 (static
measure) would be from fully charged to 3/4 charged and 11 would be stone
cold dead (again, static measure) in all types so if the battery was a low
maintenance or a cheep battery, 12.6 would be fully charged.

&gt; Because sometimes that is not the case and other times it is a PITA to
&gt; hook
&gt; to the batteries with side mounted terminals.  As for my wifes car, you
&gt; cannot even see the battery as it is hidden in the fender well and has a
&gt; terminal connected to the battery positive for jump starting.

&gt;&gt; Yer done, but feel free to post as much as possible, Gary and I have a

&gt;&gt; riding on this.

&gt; If sticking your head in the sand makes you feel better, go for it but in

Wrong again. State of charge AND age of the battery make a huge difference.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Wrong!  If something is pulling a reasonable current from the battery
&gt;&gt; &gt; constantly (like 150 to 500 mills), between that and the huge draw from
&gt;&gt; &gt; the
&gt;&gt; &gt; starter followed by a 14.2 voltage being applied to it, it can send a
&gt;&gt; &gt; reasonably high current into the battery for a fairly long period of
&gt; time.
&gt;&gt; &gt; Perhaps you should learn a little something about batteries.

&gt;&gt; Maybe you should as well. &quot;Reasonably high&quot; isn't a technical term anyone
&gt;&gt; here recognizes as something specific. I'd say you are waffling, and had.

&gt; That is because you are trying to hide from being wrong, as usual.  I am
&gt; using relative terms because I don't know the specific values and neither
&gt; do
&gt; you.

&gt;&gt; A battery charging voltage of 14.2 has little or nothing to do with the
&gt; actual
&gt;&gt; current flowing in the battery, as you've so eloquently stated time after
&gt;&gt; time.

&gt; I said no such thing and 14.2 volts has EVERYTHING to do with how much
&gt; current is flowing into the battery along with the batteries state of
&gt; charge.

&gt;&gt; Thus, I'm not sure why you bothered to use it as a reason for the
&gt;&gt; battery getting a &quot;reasonably high current&quot;.

&gt; The state of charge determins how much current will flow into the battery
&gt; at
&gt; a given voltage and if the battery is already weakened by an unintended
&gt; prolonged current draw from something like an illuminated glove
&gt; compartment
&gt; light, the added pull from the starter will make it worse

&gt;&gt; The &quot;huge draw from the starter&quot; is likewise unmeasured.

&gt; LOL, there is no need to specifically measure it as it is only compounding
&gt; the problem in this possible cause of the problem.

&gt;&gt; You have no idea what the particular starter is drawing, and it seems
&gt;&gt; like
&gt;&gt; you don't know what an actual starter draws period.

&gt; LOL, I don't see any numbers comming from you.

&gt;&gt; Most starters do not
&gt;&gt; draw near what the battery is rated for on a constant draw. Initial spike
&gt;&gt; might exceed battery rating, but in a well designed and maintained
&gt;&gt; system,
&gt;&gt; this too is unlikely.

&gt; Gee Max, near ratings and might exceed ratings are not exactly technical
&gt; terms anyone here recognizes as something specific either so as is said
&gt; many
&gt; times to you, PKB!

&gt;&gt; Further, unless the vehicle is particularly hard
&gt;&gt; starting, starter draw is for short period of time, and will not induce
&gt;&gt; battery boiling.

&gt; LOL, no matter how low I think your knowlege is, you jump in and prove me
&gt; wrong by showing it to be MUCH lower.

&gt;&gt; Even your claim that recharging after a long draw and then a short &quot;huge
&gt;&gt; draw&quot; (WTFIT??) is suspect, as the system design takes into account the
&gt;&gt; battery in that system, and is designed NOT to cook the battery.

&gt; Yea Max, under normal conditions you would be right but that constant draw
&gt; is not a normal condition and unless the person is using a deep cycle
&gt; battery, the battery is not designed for that either.

&gt;&gt; So once again, you've discussed things that are irrelevant.

&gt; Just because you don't understand it does not make it irrevelant.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If the voltage was below 12.6, I'd agree you might POSSIBLY have a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; load problem - but it would, in my opinion, have to be significantly
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lower - like 11 or so.

&gt;&gt; &gt; What are you talking about here?  A battery voltage of 12.6 or a system
&gt;&gt; &gt; voltage of 12.6?

&gt;&gt; If you don't know, then you shouldn't be part of this discussion.

&gt; You should be the last person to say this when it is obvious that you
&gt; don't
&gt; have a clue about the function of the charging system with your voltage
&gt; means nothing BS and yet, here you are.

&gt;&gt; BTW, he was talking battery voltage.

&gt; Are you so sure about that?  Depending on the battery type, 12.6 (static
&gt; measure) would be from fully charged to 3/4 charged and 11 would be stone
&gt; cold dead (again, static measure) in all types so if the battery was a low
&gt; maintenance or a cheep battery, 12.6 would be fully charged.

voltage, you would be correct.  The problem is that most cheep chargers do
not have the current capability and the battery will pull their voltage DOWN
while charging.  I would think that YOU of all people would know this.  Am I

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Sound familiar?

As to the current, yup, an older battery will take less current, since less
of its plates are able to be used in the chemical reaction. What this means
is directly the opposite of what you claim. It takes less current to charge,
but at the same time, it takes less current to exceed its ability to charge,
thus, it heats up faster, and boils more easily. Thats why some large
battery chargers have timers with age increments on them.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Let's forget all the little biy squabling and answer the OP's

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The voltage MUST be checked across the battery posts - pos to neg. If
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the voltage is within spec (under 14.6 with a fully charged battery)
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and the battery still boils, the battery is shot.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Checking from pos to engine or body ground will GENERALLY give a
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; higher voltage if the ground is bad. If the wire from the alternator
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; output has high resistance, measuring from the alt output t0 ground
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; will give a higher reading than across the battery.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No shit, and this is what I was saying all along.  The voltage however,
&gt;&gt; &gt;DOES
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; NOT have to be measured across the terminals in this case because as
&gt;your
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; examples have clearly demonstrated, the voltage will not be higher at
&gt;the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; battery than at these other measurement points and we are looking for
&gt;an
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; OVER VOLTAGE condition at the battery.

&gt;&gt; &gt;no, numb nuts

&gt;&gt; &gt;we are searching for the cause of over CURRENT thru the battery

&gt;&gt; And the ONLY two things that can cause overcurrent through the battery
&gt;&gt; with the engine running and the battery being charged (which it
&gt;&gt; obviously is at 14.2 volts) are too high a charging voltage (which it
&gt;&gt; is not, at 14.2 volts) or a defective battery.

&gt;Wrong!  If something is pulling a reasonable current from the battery
&gt;constantly (like 150 to 500 mills), between that and the huge draw from the
&gt;starter followed by a 14.2 voltage being applied to it, it can send a
&gt;reasonably high current into the battery for a fairly long period of time.
&gt;Perhaps you should learn a little something about batteries.
">

I know about batteries.
One thing the OP did NOT tell us is what the initial charging voltage
is after a restart, and preferably what the charging current is.
Initial charging voltage on a healthy partly discharged battery will
be significantly below 14.2 volts.
As long as the charging voltage is within parameters, a healthy
battery will not gas excessively even IF the battery state of charge
is down. Now, a battery with basic health issues is a horse of an
entirely different colour.
I'm still voting for 2 sulphated or otherwise worn out 3 year old

Locked armature starter current on a 59 olds was305 amps - and no load

No load current on a 1983 Chrysler 360 was 90 amps, and locked
armature  a mere 180 amps. Most 4 cyl and V6 engines today run closer
to 45 amps no load, and 150 locked armature - with average cranking
current less than 120 amps for less than 5 seconds.
That is LESS THAN  POINT TWO AMP HOURS of battery capacity required to
start the engine on todays vehicle, whereas my old '57 Fargo usually
cranked for 15 seconds at 200 amps - which figures out to POINT EIGHT
amp hours.
If the trunk had a 60 amp generator on it, and charged  at the full
rate, which it would not do, it would charge for about a minute.
At 30 amps, it would charge for about 2 minutes. At 15 amps, 4
minutes. In real world operating conditions the battery would reach a
full state of charge in less than 10 minutes of charging at below 10
amps.

On today's cars, you are dividing that time by 4.

&gt;Are you so sure about that?  Depending on the battery type, 12.6 (static

">

I'll speek for myself.
Battery voltage with the engine running, system charging, and whatever
load applied to the system to reduce charging voltage to 12.6 or less.
12.6 volts with the charging system functioning means the LOAD is
drawing the entire output of the charging system. Any less means the
load is drawing all the system can produce PLUS it is drawing from the
battery.

Not a very likely situation - which is my point.

Also, the ONLY dependable test of battery condition is a battery

An AVR test is simply a load test with the engine running and is used
to check the performance of the charging system on a daily basis by
thousands of mechanics around the world.
However, the BATTERY load test is generally the first test performed
on a starting/charging system if a transconductance tester is not
available.
If the load test (or transconductance test if available) passes  and
the battery is up to proper charge (in case of passing a
transconductance test) the starter draw test is usually next. If
starter current is within range, and the battery cranking voltage does
not drop below spec (usually 9.6 volts on older vehicles)  the battery
voltage recovery is checked (if transconductance test was not done) to
see how quickly the unloaded battery returns to 12 volts.(usually
after leaving headlamps on high beam for a few minutes)
Then the engine is started and the charging system tests performed.
If the battery has failed it's tests, the results of the charging
system tests will be inconclusive.
Then the engine is started and the

Except if you have a poor ground connection, in which case all reslts

&gt;Really???  Got proof on the battery age thing???  It is more the condition
&gt;of the battery than it's age and BTW, an old and / or abused battery builds
&gt;resistance due to sulfation and takes LESS current and a lesser chance of

&gt;just give up?  As you seem to be demonstrating, an infinite number of times,

And a battery that has lost plate material due to age and or abuse
develops a LOW internal resistance, and draws MORE power from the
charging system, resulting in a lower charging voltage at a given
charging current. So does a battery with warped plates and/or damaged
separators.

Also, a sulphated battery WILL offgas during charging more than a good
battery at the same charging current.

Hey, T Boner - I have MANY times found problems with the ground
connection between the engine and the battery that would screw up a
load test and just about any other test you might try to do to a
starting/charging system if you did not FIRST do a battery condition
test, with the test equipment (of your choice - mine is the MidTronics
tester) connected DIRECTLY to the battery.
Once the battery has been given an unconditional clean bill of health,
you can accurately test the rest of the system if you have half a clue
how to go about it in a SYSTEMATIC manner.

IF there is EITHER a load on the system OR a bad battery, the "surface
charge" will dissipate relatively quickly, bringing the voltage down
from the initial 12.6 (nominal) volts within a short time.

ANY change in voltage between about 15 seconds after shutting down the
vehicle and half an hour later means SOMETHING isn't quite right. ANd
checking ANYWHERE BUT ACROSS THE BATTERY can point you in the wrong

You have this ONE point in your favour. IF it is an intermittent

significant variation in either voltmeter or ammeter readings (if the

it - and it passed.He said I had a bad battery connection. Less than

Battery was replaced under Warrranty.No problems since.

&gt; not have the current capability and the battery will pull their voltage DOWN
&gt; while charging.  I would think that YOU of all people would know this.  Am I
&gt; wrong?

Yes, you're wrong.  A dead battery will pull more current than a charged
one.  The charge voltage will be about the same.

No doubt, but stuffing it under the hood of a car where temps hit 200+, its
really no difference if its 200, 250, or 300 under there, all are above the
best temp to store a battery.

&gt;&gt;LOL, no matter how low I think your knowlege is, you jump in and prove me

&gt; Locked armature starter current on a 59 olds was305 amps - and no load
&gt; current was 100 amps. On a 61 olds it was 370 locked armature, and 120
&gt; no load.

&gt; No load current on a 1983 Chrysler 360 was 90 amps, and locked
&gt; armature  a mere 180 amps. Most 4 cyl and V6 engines today run closer
&gt; to 45 amps no load, and 150 locked armature - with average cranking
&gt; current less than 120 amps for less than 5 seconds.
&gt; That is LESS THAN  POINT TWO AMP HOURS of battery capacity required to
&gt; start the engine on todays vehicle, whereas my old '57 Fargo usually
&gt; cranked for 15 seconds at 200 amps - which figures out to POINT EIGHT
&gt; amp hours.
&gt; If the trunk had a 60 amp generator on it, and charged  at the full
&gt; rate, which it would not do, it would charge for about a minute.
&gt; At 30 amps, it would charge for about 2 minutes. At 15 amps, 4
&gt; minutes. In real world operating conditions the battery would reach a
&gt; full state of charge in less than 10 minutes of charging at below 10
&gt; amps.

&gt; On today's cars, you are dividing that time by 4.
&gt; Frankly, I cannot see this being an issue with regards to battery
&gt; water usage.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Even your claim that recharging after a long draw and then a short &quot;huge
&gt;&gt;&gt; draw&quot; (WTFIT??) is suspect, as the system design takes into account the
&gt;&gt;&gt; battery in that system, and is designed NOT to cook the battery.

&gt;&gt;Yea Max, under normal conditions you would be right but that constant draw
&gt;&gt;is not a normal condition and unless the person is using a deep cycle
&gt;&gt;battery, the battery is not designed for that either.

&gt; Many times my van sits with a 200ma draw (2.4 watts) for an entire
&gt; weekend ( say 3 days or 72 hours) and starts with no problem, and the
&gt; battery recharges with no gassing or water loss. Batteries generally
&gt; last me about 3 years or more - my Toyota went 7 years on the
&gt; original, but most are ready (have been) to be retired by the end of 4
&gt; years.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So once again, you've discussed things that are irrelevant.

&gt;&gt;Just because you don't understand it does not make it irrevelant.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If the voltage was below 12.6, I'd agree you might POSSIBLY have a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; load problem - but it would, in my opinion, have to be significantly
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lower - like 11 or so.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; What are you talking about here?  A battery voltage of 12.6 or a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; system
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; voltage of 12.6?

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you don't know, then you shouldn't be part of this discussion.

&gt;&gt;You should be the last person to say this when it is obvious that you
&gt;&gt;don't
&gt;&gt;have a clue about the function of the charging system with your voltage
&gt;&gt;means nothing BS and yet, here you are.

&gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, he was talking battery voltage.

&gt;&gt;Are you so sure about that?  Depending on the battery type, 12.6 (static
&gt;&gt;measure) would be from fully charged to 3/4 charged and 11 would be stone
&gt;&gt;cold dead (again, static measure) in all types so if the battery was a low
&gt;&gt;maintenance or a cheep battery, 12.6 would be fully charged.

&gt; I'll speek for myself.
&gt; Battery voltage with the engine running, system charging, and whatever
&gt; load applied to the system to reduce charging voltage to 12.6 or less.
&gt; 12.6 volts with the charging system functioning means the LOAD is
&gt; drawing the entire output of the charging system. Any less means the
&gt; load is drawing all the system can produce PLUS it is drawing from the
&gt; battery.

&gt; Not a very likely situation - which is my point.

OK guys here's what's current.
Step 1
1. Old battery was a Delco, bought it 2002
2. Second battery, had a Mopar label, but suspect it was Exide, about three
years of life.
Both batteries spewing liquid, much corrosion on car.
Just replaced battery with brand new Exide battery, over rated for this
vehicle, more CCA (525, car requires 430).

What I found on the drive home.
Install of new battery, before cranking engine, voltage is 12.6 volts.
After cranking engine with, engine running, 14.36 volts
2 minutes after starting, battery voltage is 14.19 volts.
With a Fluke DVM connected to the battery, for 27 Km, battery voltage varied
between 14.09 (at a stop light) to 14.21 at 70Km per hour, no load beyond
engine draw.
At idle with full current draw (rear window defog, head lights and blower)
battery voltage was 13.86.
Idle voltage with no current draw (beyond engine and driving lights) was a
battery voltage of 14.09 volts.
Time to recovery from a full load idle was about 1 min.
Air temp was about 25 degrees C.
It should be noted that I was also monitoring the "sense" voltage (on a
second meter) at the alternator (voltage reg input), and that voltage was
about .5 volts lower, but followed the battery voltage, and never changed
beyond always being about ,5 volts less than the battery.
For 27 Km the  monitored battery voltage never exceeded 14.35 volts.

Step 2
Attached a third DVM, to monitor the current output of the alternator (250
amp shunt installed in series with the output).
With the day time running lights and, always on, side markers, disabled
(removed fuses), the current from the alternator was 15 amps (seems high to
me).
Moved the shunt to the battery, current into the battery was 5 amps at start
but was decreasing to 4.16 after about 15 minutes (idle speed).
Battery voltage was now about 13.70 volts.  Manual says when the regulator
operates above 60 degrees C that the reg voltage is 13.4 to 14.6.  The
alternator housing containing the regulator was to hot to hold your hand on.
At no time during any of this testing did the battery voltage exceed 14.5
volts.
And for the record, the "key out of the ignition" current draw was, 125
milliamps.
So, unless I can find some other problem, my best guess for an answer is,
"two bad batteries, with the same fault".
Test instruments tell me that the system is operating normal, the only
variable was the battery.
After about 50Km of driving there is no sign of fluid leakage from the
battery.
At no time did any of the three batteries feel warm to the touch.
The second battery (Mopar) had a specific gravity reading in the "white "
zone between green and red, but this could have been because we had added
water.  The first battery was sealed and un testable.

I hope I haven't caused to much grief in this news group, and thank you
Tbone and all the others for your recommendations and suggestions.
I now know more about batteries and charge systems than I ever wanted to
know.
Now I just need to know how to stop all the battery acid corrosion.  I have
washed everything with baking soda and water, but it still seems to be
corroding.

&gt; &gt; Hahahahahahaha, you really are funny.  While current may be measured in

&gt; &gt; voltage (state of charge), the more current is going to flow into it so
as
&gt; &gt; I

do
&gt; &gt; with it.  Once again, you demonstrate your complete ignorance of even
&gt; &gt; simple
&gt; &gt; DC circuits.

&gt; So now the state of charge is part of it? Well duh, no kidding. But I'm
&gt; still talking about the condition of the battery, not just the state of
&gt; charge. And its interesting that you've argued in the past that volts had
&gt; nothing to do with current, now you claim it has everything to do with it.

&gt; Does that merry go round yer on have a colliape?

&gt; &gt; Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, oh, please,
stop,
&gt; &gt; you are killing me.  Can you really be this dumb?  First of all, if you
&gt; &gt; are
&gt; &gt; talking about current, you cannot measure that across the terminals of
the
&gt; &gt; battery, LOL.

&gt; Um, yeah, ya can. See, load testers have this neat little resistance bank
in
&gt; them, makes a bunch of heat, but generally does a good job of checking
&gt; current output of a battery. Available at any good auto parts place.

&gt; &gt; Second, unless you disconnect at least one of the terminals
&gt; &gt; of the battery from the system to isolate it, the system is still
&gt; &gt; connected
&gt; &gt; and will still influence your readings.

&gt; Right, but I figured that was so elementary, that if you actually knew
what
&gt; you were doing, you'd know to pull the negative terminal.

&gt; &gt; Third, only an idiot would attempt
&gt; &gt; to load test the battery with the engine running

&gt; I never said to load test it with the engine running. Indeed, I never gave
&gt; any specific instructions or conditions under which to test it. You are
&gt; reaching pretty hard there.

&gt; &gt; and again, unless you
&gt; &gt; disconnect the battery, the system will still be there.

&gt; Correct, so pull a terminal clamp and do it right. You know how to pull a
&gt; terminal clamp, right? You've got the right tools?

&gt; &gt; BTW, if the engine
&gt; &gt; is not running, the battery is the only source of power and will be the
&gt; &gt; only
&gt; &gt; thing load tested regardless of where you connect the ground wire, LOL.

&gt; Um, yeah, thats the idea. Load testing a battery is best done by load
&gt; testing the battery. You act as though this is a new discovery of yours,
&gt; been doing some reading in order to catch up?

&gt; &gt; Really???  Got proof on the battery age thing???  It is more the
condition
&gt; &gt; of the battery than it's age and BTW, an old and / or abused battery
&gt; &gt; builds
&gt; &gt; resistance due to sulfation and takes LESS current and a lesser chance
of
&gt; &gt; &quot;boiling&quot; at a given voltage.  How many times can you be wrong before
you
&gt; &gt; just give up?  As you seem to be demonstrating, an infinite number of
&gt; &gt; times,
&gt; &gt; LOL.

&gt; Actually, yes, I do.  Let me dig a bit here......

&gt; &gt; an old and / or abused battery builds resistance due to sulfation

&gt; Sound familiar?

&gt; As to the current, yup, an older battery will take less current, since
less
&gt; of its plates are able to be used in the chemical reaction. What this
means
&gt; is directly the opposite of what you claim. It takes less current to
charge,
&gt; but at the same time, it takes less current to exceed its ability to
charge,
&gt; thus, it heats up faster, and boils more easily. Thats why some large
&gt; battery chargers have timers with age increments on them.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Feel free to post again, we're betting on it.

&gt; &gt; As long as you make it this easy to make you look foolish, you CAN bet
on
&gt; &gt; it.

&gt; You might want to check your facts on who is looking foolish, Mr. &quot;Helium
&gt; has no weight&quot;

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That is because you are trying to hide from being wrong, as usual.  I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; am
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; using relative terms because I don't know the specific values and
&gt; &gt; neither
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Uhoh.... yer wrong there. I can go outside, and get a specific amp draw
&gt; &gt;&gt; reading on any one of my vehicles. Do you even HAVE an ammeter that
will
&gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt;&gt; that?

&gt; &gt; LOL, while you can measure the current draw from the starter in YOUR
&gt; &gt; vehicle
&gt; &gt; (actually, I doubt that you really have the ability), if you think that
&gt; &gt; every starter pulls the same current you are even dumber than I thought
&gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; now you are reaching all new levels of ignorance.  With that in mind,
NO,
&gt; &gt; you do not have the specific values for his vehicle or even yours for
that
&gt; &gt; matter so once again, you are wrong and full of shit as well.  Oh, and
&gt; &gt; BTW,
&gt; &gt; I do have an inductive amp meter that can read current levels that high.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I said no such thing and 14.2 volts has EVERYTHING to do with how
much
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; current is flowing into the battery along with the batteries state of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; charge.

&gt; &gt;&gt; Um, no. Current is measured in amps not volts. So the voltage at which
&gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt;&gt; system is operating doesn't tell a doggone thing about what the battery
&gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt; &gt;&gt; taking in, or putting out.

&gt; &gt; Hahahahahahaha, you really are funny.  While current may be measured in

&gt; &gt;&gt; Thats why a check across the terminals is needed,
&gt; &gt;&gt; it eliminates the system, and checks only the battery. Thats also why
you
&gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt;&gt; a load test FIRST, because that draws a load on ONLY the battery.

&gt; condition
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the battery than it's age and BTW, an old and / or abused battery
&gt; &gt; &gt; builds
&gt; &gt; &gt; resistance due to sulfation and takes LESS current and a lesser chance
&gt; of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;boiling&quot; at a given voltage.  How many times can you be wrong before
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; just give up?  As you seem to be demonstrating, an infinite number of
&gt; &gt; &gt; times,
&gt; &gt; &gt; LOL.

&gt; &gt; Actually, yes, I do.  Let me dig a bit here......

&gt; &gt; &gt; an old and / or abused battery builds resistance due to sulfation

&gt; &gt; Sound familiar?

&gt; &gt; As to the current, yup, an older battery will take less current, since
&gt; less
&gt; &gt; of its plates are able to be used in the chemical reaction. What this
&gt; means
&gt; &gt; is directly the opposite of what you claim. It takes less current to
&gt; charge,
&gt; &gt; but at the same time, it takes less current to exceed its ability to
&gt; charge,
&gt; &gt; thus, it heats up faster, and boils more easily. Thats why some large
&gt; &gt; battery chargers have timers with age increments on them.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Feel free to post again, we're betting on it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; As long as you make it this easy to make you look foolish, you CAN bet
&gt; on
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.

&gt; &gt; You might want to check your facts on who is looking foolish, Mr.
&quot;Helium
&gt; &gt; has no weight&quot;

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; That is because you are trying to hide from being wrong, as usual.
I
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; am
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; using relative terms because I don't know the specific values and
&gt; &gt; &gt; neither
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Uhoh.... yer wrong there. I can go outside, and get a specific amp
draw
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reading on any one of my vehicles. Do you even HAVE an ammeter that
&gt; will
&gt; &gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that?

&gt; &gt; &gt; LOL, while you can measure the current draw from the starter in YOUR
&gt; &gt; &gt; vehicle
&gt; &gt; &gt; (actually, I doubt that you really have the ability), if you think
that
&gt; &gt; &gt; every starter pulls the same current you are even dumber than I
thought
&gt; &gt; &gt; and
&gt; &gt; &gt; now you are reaching all new levels of ignorance.  With that in mind,
&gt; NO,
&gt; &gt; &gt; you do not have the specific values for his vehicle or even yours for
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; matter so once again, you are wrong and full of shit as well.  Oh, and
&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW,
&gt; &gt; &gt; I do have an inductive amp meter that can read current levels that
high.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I said no such thing and 14.2 volts has EVERYTHING to do with how
&gt; much
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; current is flowing into the battery along with the batteries state
of
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; charge.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Um, no. Current is measured in amps not volts. So the voltage at
which
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; system is operating doesn't tell a doggone thing about what the
battery
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; taking in, or putting out.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hahahahahahaha, you really are funny.  While current may be measured
in
&gt; &gt; &gt; amps, voltage is the force that causes current flow and current is
&gt; simply
&gt; &gt; &gt; how much is flowing.  The higher the system voltage is above the
battery
&gt; &gt; &gt; voltage (state of charge), the more current is going to flow into it
so
&gt; as
&gt; &gt; &gt; I
&gt; &gt; &gt; said, both the 14.2 AND the batteries state of charge has everything
to
&gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt; with it.  Once again, you demonstrate your complete ignorance of even
&gt; &gt; &gt; simple
&gt; &gt; &gt; DC circuits.

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Thats why a check across the terminals is needed,
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; it eliminates the system, and checks only the battery. Thats also why
&gt; you
&gt; &gt; &gt; do
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a load test FIRST, because that draws a load on

&gt; I hope I haven't caused to much grief in this news group, and thank you
&gt; Tbone and all the others for your recommendations and suggestions.
&gt; I now know more about batteries and charge systems than I ever wanted to
&gt; know.

Hopefully you've gotten the correct info. Tbone tends to muddy the water,
even when he's got it right.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Now I just need to know how to stop all the battery acid corrosion.  I
&gt; have
&gt; washed everything with baking soda and water, but it still seems to be
&gt; corroding.
">

First step is neutralize acid in the area, which you've done. Next, there is
a product that appears under names such as "Extend", a pinkish fluid that
turns black upon application. This will neutralize the rust, as it
chemically binds (so the label says) to the iron oxide. The metal will then
be black. Spray the box with rubberized undercoating. This should help keep
it free from rust for some time, and is easily reapplied.
