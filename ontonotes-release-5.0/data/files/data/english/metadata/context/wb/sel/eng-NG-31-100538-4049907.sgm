206 clutch problem

Hi guys,

Hope someone can help me.  I have a 22 month old 206 Xsi with just
over 16000 miles, the majority of which has been A road/ motorway
driving.

The clutch biting point has always been high, noticable after driving
other vehicles with a more 'normal' biting position.

Just had the car serviced and asked for the clutch to be adjusted, and
was told this wasn't possible.  They commented that the biting point
was high and kinda suggested it was my driving style.

For the record, my background is in mechanical engineering and I used
to work at Ford, at one point on clutch systems, so I am more than
aware of potential clutch issues and look after it well, in addition
I'm into the old advanced driving thing and can safely say I never
ride the clutch, ever.

So, anyone got any ideas as to known issues etc ... ???

I'm a bit catch 22 - the warranty says that the clutch is covered,
allowing for mileage and driving style - this seems to give Peugeot a
get out clause as they could claim every failed clutch is due to bad
driving!

It's fair to say that the clutch is not, and has not ever slipped -
but due to the fact that the cluch appears to be fully engauged near
the top of the pedal travel this can be only a matter of time as
normal wear occurs.  Problem is, Pug have said that if they take it
apart and find nothing wrong then it's chargeable (about £400).
Unfortunately, just cos they may not find the problem doesn't mean
it's not there as these issues can be very hard to find (the car, and
my previous one has been in many times with issues they say don't
exsist only for them to have to admit that they did, this time however
they have the 'you caused it yourself' excuse).

My own opinion is that a clutch should last &gt;70000 miles if traeted
well (one of my previous cars did), and even in a car that is not
driven that well it should last 25000 + (on average), 16000 is just
plain mad ...

There may be other issues for a high bite point (wrong clutch fitted
could be one, or high spots on the flyweel or pressure plate that have
caused excessive wear another).

Any ideas, thoughts ???

Thanks,

Martin

I've had three Peugeots and in all three cases, as the car has got older
(and hence the clutch has worn) you have to press the pedal further down for
the clutch to disengage. A friend of mine who is a mechanic for Citroen told
me that you know it's time to replace a clutch when you have to press the
pedal right to the floor to disengage it. This also goes along with my Mum's
VW as she always went through clutches quickly. New clutch = high biting
point. Worn clutch = low biting point.

I think you just have it backwards...?
