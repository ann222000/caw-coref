Europe? I have no love for Europe. While I have no desire that Europe
should receive its just punishments at the hands of the islamists, I
would happily receive the news that all of the European continent has
sunk into the sea.

Giorgies
praying our Jewish bretherin in Europe purchase lifeboats before the
continental sinking.

I don't think it's too late for America or Canada, but the Europeans

How sad.  This may have some very unfortunate consequences in the
future, even for the U.S. and other nations in North and South
America.  For example, if some European nations are seen as pro-Arab
now in their dealings in the Mid East or in the United Nations,
imagine how those countries will be 50 or 100 years from now when
their populations are 50% Arab.

You raise a good observation.  However, if would be terrible if the

large power shift with Israel and the US being more and more isolated

Hopefully 50 or 100 years into the future, the Western powers will
have found a clean, safe energy source other than oil and hence, the
oil rich nations will not be so important.

There are things that can be done in the meantime.

The company I work for has started sending people to work in their
homes.  I started doing this nearly six months ago, and my gasoline
expenses are a mere 25% of what they used to be.  I only need to go
into the office once a month for meetings.  My department is now
around 85% working at home!

I think all responsible companies should follow my company's example
and send their work force home to the fullest extent possible.

Then, when other energy sources become available, the transition would
be that much easier.

We already have an alternative source of oil; it is
only more expensive.

The well-known Fischer-Trobsch (sp?) process was used
during WWII by Germany, and during the boycott by
South Africa, to make much of its oil from plentiful
coal.  The major problem is price.

Nuclear energy is also available in large amounts.
I believe France is 60% nuclear, and has lots of
experience in recycling nuclear fuel.  One of the
suggested &quot;disposal procedures&quot; for the transuranics,
the worst part of the current &quot;nuclear ashes&quot;, is
to put them in with the recycled fuel, as their
effect their will be minor, and the reactors are
well-designed for them.

Fortunately, the oil companies aren't the only companies around. They
will have no more success preventing new energy technologies from
appearing than the railroad companies had with airlines. That is, if
they will even try (not likely).

Venture funds invested $2.4 billion in alternative energy start-ups
last year (which would represent roughly a third of the total they may
ultimately invest in just these companies, and there are more in the
pipeline), while the oil majors spent about $1 billion on their own
efforts.

&gt; &gt; &gt; oil rich nations will not be so important

&gt; &gt; There are things that can be done in the meantime.

&gt; &gt; The company I work for has started sending people to work in their
&gt; &gt; homes.  I started doing this nearly six months ago, and my gasoline
&gt; &gt; expenses are a mere 25% of what they used to be.  I only need to go
&gt; &gt; into the office once a month for meetings.  My department is now
&gt; &gt; around 85% working at home!
&gt; That is fabulous. What a great idea.  I am sure it makes many
&gt; employees happy and it cuts down on travel time, expensives, wear and
&gt; tear, etc.
">

It is great.  I work at home on Fridays and get more done per hour than in the office
with constant interuptions.

In addition because it is Fridays I start earlier work at home (not having to commute
to work and can work later on early Shabbos times because I do not have the commute
home.

It is also a day I can have repairman, deliveries etc. show up at home.

Of course if I had a house full of kids at home, I don't know how much I could get
done.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; &gt; I think all responsible companies should follow my company's example
&gt; &gt; and send their work force home to the fullest extent possible.

&gt; &gt; Then, when other energy sources become available, the transition would
&gt; &gt; be that much easier.- -

&gt; &gt;But that will only be if they _look_ for such alternatives. Right
&gt; &gt;now, the oil companies, in the _West_ are quite content as things
&gt; &gt;are. They are raking it in!

&gt; Fortunately, the oil companies aren't the only companies around. They
&gt; will have no more success preventing new energy technologies from
&gt; appearing than the railroad companies had with airlines. That is, if
&gt; they will even try (not likely).

&gt; Venture funds invested $2.4 billion in alternative energy start-ups
&gt; last year (which would represent roughly a third of the total they may
&gt; ultimately invest in just these companies, and there are more in the
&gt; pipeline), while the oil majors spent about $1 billion on their own
&gt; efforts.

I was reading an article in US News this morning about advances in
wind, solar and deep-geothermal power that, if developed, could give
us energy independence in a matter of a decade or two.  We just have
to want it enough to spend the money to develop it.

Well, kind of depends on how you define your terms. When speaking of
blacks and Jews in this context, it always means people who are perceived
to have some &quot;racial&quot; characteristic. Muslim could mean that, but it's
much more of a philosophy than a racial or ethnic characterization.

Would you object to Eliyahu's statement if he'd written, say, ...&quot;will
'revoke' the presence of so many millions of Fascists...&quot; as an example?

I think &quot;Muslim&quot; is overbroad here, but the question of how to deal with
IslamoFascists is a very real one. Revoking their presence wouldn't
necessarily or even incidentally mean physically expelling people, but of
changing viewpoints. Which is a perfectly legitimate goal IMO.

So should England expel all the Normans and Vikings and any other non-

Actually I think everyone is indeed a racist, to one degree or another, I

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a scary article.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Indeed it is.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope the west wakes up before it is too late.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think it's too late for America or Canada, but the Europeans
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may be a lost cause.  Many friends of mine in Europe are totally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disgusted with the events taking place there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How sad.  This may have some very unfortunate consequences in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; future, even for the U.S. and other nations in North and South
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; America.  For example, if some European nations are seen as pro-Arab
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now in their dealings in the Mid East or in the United Nations,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; imagine how those countries will be 50 or 100 years from now when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their populations are 50% Arab

&gt; &gt; &gt; I suspect that in that time we will see a new wave of European
&gt; &gt; &gt; immigrants here in the states, escaping Shariah Law.

&gt; &gt; That's interesting, because we are expecting a wave of American
&gt; &gt; immigrants here in Europe, escaping Patriot Act law.

&gt; Well, if you  have nothing to hide, there is no reason to fear the
&gt; Patriot Act law....
">

Then you wouldn't mind if the police wanted to listen in on your phone
calls, monitor your internet connection, visit your house to look
through your things, or put a videocamera in front of your home to
monitor your activities?  After all, if you have nothing to hide...
The fact is, few of us would want to live in such a State, as the
citizens of North Korea can amply testify. It's not about whether we
have something to hide, but, rather, that we choose to live in a
country where the government has only the powers we've chosen to give
it and not the other way around.

&quot;White mans&quot; culture is a meaningless term, used only by klansmen.

Danish culture consists of specific customs, costumes, folk songs, folk

Ethiopian culture to say the Ugandans or vice versa. Each group is unique
and bring interesting customs and traditions. I learned that a few years
back reading a host of various African novelists. Very interesting. Same
thing goes with various European, Oriental and other cultures. People
naturally want their cultures or identities to survive. Jews are no

Sure they do - you're talking about the &quot;authenticity&quot; of native customs,

I am native to the United States. Therefore, my customs are native US
customs. This idea of &quot;native grounds&quot; is what I'm disputing - there's no
such thing, one of the key features of humans is that we migrate. In fact
I happen to think that this migration is the driver behind human evolution
(e.g., bipedalism, hairlessness, etc.) But this concept of &quot;native ground&quot;
is taking a snapshot at a single point in time and using it to draw some
sort of long-term conclusion -- it has no validity.

&quot;Danish&quot; is just as arbitrary as &quot;white&quot; in this context. Look, I'm not

political or geographic structure that's when you run into trouble. You

As I said above, there's no such thing as a native country. Humans are

Firstly, if there are Europeans up to no good, whether Muslim extremists

I agree with that, what I was trying to express (and perhaps I didn't) was
the distinction between attitudes and the people who hold those attitudes.
That is, to expel Fascism isn't necessarily (or even desirably) to dispel

I don't understand what you're saying. Some large number of non-European

Fair enough, but I don't think that distinction was present in the

Yes, there are Islamic extremists making abroad in Europe. I don't think
they're fascists; their ideology seems to share very little with
fascism. It seems to have more in common with that of home-grown
extremist movements in Europe of the separatist variety, but with vaguer
and less addressable ends.

Calling Islamic extremism &quot;Islamofascism&quot; is a bit like a stroppy
teenager denouncing her parents as fascists because they won't let her
do what she wants. It signals her repudiation of their attitudes, but
it's innacurate and focuses one's attention on the carelessness of her
denunciation. I think it's more important to do something about Islamic
extremism than it is to confuse the issue of what it is by calling it
misleading names.

Whatever you want to call them, there certainly aren't millions of them,
and most Islamic extremists in Europe appear to be European. The ones
responsible for the attacks and attempted attacks in the UK were all
European, though most of those convicted for the 2004 Madrid bombings
were north African.

Hitchens and Prager have recently published some compelling articles about
the use of the term IslamoFascism. One of the key take-aways is that it's
merely descriptive, it's equivalent to Italian Fascism, which I think
everyone takes to refer to a specific political philosophy that was
espoused / employed in Italy, but not a commentary in any way on all
Italians. Imagine, though, if we referred to Mussolini not as an Italian
Fascist, but as an Italian extremist. Now we're saying that it IS inherent
in the &quot;Italian character,&quot; and Mussolini was simply taking it too far.

It's the same thing here -- Islamic extremism *IS*  Islam, by definition.
IslamoFascism, OTOH, isn't necessarily. It implies a merger - that people
are appropriating Islam in order to promulgate a political philosophy
which can be compared to Fascism. I think that's fair.

As Hitchens points out, Fascism is an approximation, since Italian fascism
strongly incorporates state-ism, while Islamofascism has replaced this
with something else. But it's very similiar in most other respects. The
Taliban regime, for example, would seem to have a great deal in common
with a more traditionally understood version of Fascism.

The term &quot;Fascism&quot; isn't just an epithet, it refers to a specific
political philosophy. Contrary to your example with the teenager, I think
the use of the term here helps us differentiate Islam as a religion from
this particular ideological / political movement, which is helpful. It
also helps us understand what these guys are really about.

&gt;&gt; Well, kind of depends on how you define your terms. When speaking of

The &quot;philosophy&quot; of converting, executing, or enslaving all

&gt;Firstly, if there are Europeans up to no good, whether Muslim extremists
&gt;or Danish biker gangs, we don't have an option simply of getting rid of

At this time, no, although many would not be unhappy if their

many were willing to do so.  The problem is to find a place
for them to go; we have too few countries now.

Gangs, even if not philosophical, are far more serious than
it seems most members of this group are willing to consider.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may be a lost cause.  Many friends of mine in Europe are totally
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disgusted with the events taking place there.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How sad.  This may have some very unfortunate consequences in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; future, even for the U.S. and other nations in North and South
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; America.  For example, if some European nations are seen as pro-Arab

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; imagine how those countries will be 50 or 100 years from now when
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their populations are 50% Arab

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I suspect that in that time we will see a new wave of European
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immigrants here in the states, escaping Shariah Law.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That's interesting, because we are expecting a wave of American

The difference is in degree, not possibilities. Many things meant for
one thing are used for other purposes.  School zone enhancements to
drug laws were meant to keep people from selling drugs to kids and
dealing on school grounds. Instead, they're commonly used as a means
of lengthening sentences solely because the person was caught with
drugs within 1000 yards of a school or school bus stop, even if it was
in his own home, late at night, during the summer when school was out.
(Our office is currently defending three such cases.) Forfeiture laws
were sold to us with the idea that they would enable the seizure of
assets from millionaire drug kingpins.  Most forfeitures commonly
involve ten-year-old Fords and Chevys, a few hundred dollars in
currency, and stuff like that, from poor people.  Several years ago,
after the Patriot Act was passed, the US Attorney General sent a
letter to all of the attorneys working for the Justice Department
(Assistant Attorneys General) instructing them that they were to use
the various parts of the Patriot Act to prosecute any and all common
criminals regardless of whether it had anything to do with national
security or terrorism, simply because they were now able to do so.
IOW, it's already being used for things far beyond what was sold to
Congress.

As I've stated before, my biggest concern about our liberties is not
that a foreign power will invade and take them away, but, rather, that
we will give them away in the name of national and personal security,
one word, one phrase, one sentence or one paragraph at a time, all the
while applauding ourselves for having done so, until it's too late to
take them back.

Well, you wouldn't *see* them unless charges were brought. You wouldn't
know if your phone calls were being recorded, your email scanned, your
library reading list examined.  That's much of the problem that many
have with the act in the first place: the expanded power of the
government to scrutinise its own people without the usual oversight,
and without the knowledge of the targets.  It looks like one big
fishing expedition, and several phone companies and ISPs have come
forward to state that they have co-operated in large-scale government
surveillance.  It's not just that this could theoretically happen, but
that it could be happening now and we'd never know.

If it doesn't bother you, would you be OK with someone sitting in
your living room (or bedroom) and listening to your private conversations?

As I understand it, while Judaism holds that we are each responsible for
the other, there are still some strict rules for what is public and what
remains private.  What does Judaism say about laws that permit the
government this sort of power?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, if you  have nothing to hide, there is no reason to fear the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Patriot Act law....

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then you wouldn't mind if the police wanted to listen in on your phone
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calls, monitor your internet connection, visit your house to look
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through your things, or put a videocamera in front of your home to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; monitor your activities?  After all, if you have nothing to hide...
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fact is, few of us would want to live in such a State, as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; citizens of North Korea can amply testify. It's not about whether we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have something to hide, but, rather, that we choose to live in a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; country where the government has only the powers we've chosen to give
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it and not the other way around.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a huge difference between the police state in Eastern Europe (from
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whence I come) and the enforcement of the Patriot Act in the US, meant to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protect us from Islamofascist terrorists.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The intent of the law doesn't matter.  It's the effects that matter.

&gt; &gt; I don't see any effects from it. Nobody I know has seen any effects
&gt; &gt; from it, even the more shadier characters that I know have.... And I
&gt; &gt; unfortunately know a few... But then again, they are not talking to
&gt; &gt; people on lists in Islamabad either.

&gt; Well, you wouldn't *see* them unless charges were brought. You wouldn't
&gt; know if your phone calls were being recorded, your email scanned, your
&gt; library reading list examined.  That's much of the problem that many
&gt; have with the act in the first place: the expanded power of the
&gt; government to scrutinise its own people without the usual oversight,
&gt; and without the knowledge of the targets.  It looks like one big
&gt; fishing expedition, and several phone companies and ISPs have come
&gt; forward to state that they have co-operated in large-scale government
&gt; surveillance.

Where have you seen that? I haven't heard of that. And I would like to

They were.  If I recall correctly, the big telcos were AT&amp;T and
Verizon, but I could be mistaken.  I don't honestly remember
which ISPs were involved at the moment.

The &quot;liberal&quot; media, by the way, can only take things so far if
they're leaned on by government agencies.  I personally know a few
newspaper people who received visits from men in dark suits and earpieces
after printing certain articles, and they were asked to stop.  Smaller,
non-mainstream outlets get less attention (all the way 'round).

I am concerned, because as soon as we start analysing laws based upon
intent rather than (potential) effect we've got a serious problem.

If the latter, remember that Israel's framework of laws and that in
the US are different.

But Don.... if you haven't engaged in activity that would cause the
government to spy on you in any form, why worry about this law?

This law is in effect, but despite that, or perhaps BECAUSE of it (who
knows?) I am free to go about my business, do all the things that I
enjoy, without fear of someone checking out what I am doing, who I am
talking to, or where I am going.

I haven't done anything illegal, I am not plotting the destruction of
my fellow Americans (or anyone else), so why should I fear this
Patriot Act?

Again, there would be no reason for anyone to do that!

This reminds me of Daniel Albert Deswhossits (Tell it like it isn't)
who told me that zionists were following him around after he started
criticizing Israel. I asked him why he didn't act like a man and walk
up to those &quot;zionists&quot;, look them right in the face and ask them what
the heck was their problem.

Seriously,  were those people calling for the deaths of people? Cause
the liberal media have been known to do that.

For real, Bush provides benches for his critiques to sit on.

that is topical, but I will ask elsewhere and see if I can formulate
one for here.

Legal permission. Obviously Israel can do most anything we can do and
in many instances even better.

True, but I am trying to at least keep somewhat in the realm of

&quot;AT&amp;T and Verizon [...] Our world of packet switching and fiber cable
means that the NSA needs access to the telephone company switching
networks to track terrorist plans. When President Bush and the
Attorney General requested such cooperation in late 2001, the
companies responded despite what they must have known was some legal
risk if the public's terrorism fears subsided. And, sure enough, the
companies now find themselves the target of lawsuits for having
cooperated in this surveillance.&quot;
