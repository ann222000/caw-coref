I took pirate to check out his limp, which as I expected, hasnt' changed one
iota since I got him.  My doctor felt him up and referred us to the surgeon,
saying that he THINKS its probably that the ulna and radius grew at
different rates, but he cant' be sure.  He said that the surgeon would want
to do xrays anyway, so I might as well just wait and do that instead.  So
we've got an appointment for next Tuesday.

I was expecting this - I knew when I got the dog something was wrong, but
took him anyway, feeling that he needed to go somewhere where someone would
fix him.  But I guess now that I love him I feel sad that he might have to
face surgery and the crappy recovery rest time that comes with that.

And I guess my dreams of Pirate as agility dog for Monk are out of the
question. Ah well.

That doesn't 100% rule out agility. If you happen to have NADAC in your
area,  there are 8 classes in NADAC and 5 of them have no jumps. Plus,
Corgis get a height exemption; their official jump height is 8&quot;, which means
that in the Junior Handler division or in the Skilled category they only
have to jump 4&quot;. (Veterans, also, but that wouldn't be an option in Pirate's
case.)

Pirate may well be a veteran before we are ready to compete with my life as
it is!

My vet had a pomeranian who he obtained after the owners couldn't afford the
surgery needed to fix the dog.  He and his wife gave teh dog bionic hips.
He was an agility dog when I met him. He was a lovely dog.  But the vets
comment to me that Pirate is probably not a good agility candidate was based
on his experience with Rebel, who suffered a great deal of arthritis etc in
his old age that he felt that he and his wife had made far worse with
agility.

I'll keep my mind on getting the dog healthy and pain free for the moment.

I am very glad he's here and wouldn't have taken him if I didn't think he
needed us, because his breeder was an ass.
I'm curious to see what she says about his leg.
I was herding balls with him in the backyard today and he's getting so FAST
(he did a 20 yard faceplant) that its really hard for me to see him as
terribly sick.  But I do hope they are able to give me a good prognosis.

I'm so sorry beth, to hear about pirates leg.  Please keep us posted as to
his exam on Tuesday.  I will send you positive thoughts for him.  Every time
I see his name posted here, I'm reminded of those big cute ears sticking
straight up.  What a doll he is.  Agility or not, I'm thinkin' he's going to
be best friends to the monk.

I took Pirate from monk and his at lunch and took him to the vet and then
back to work. apparently monk was very upset and cried for pirate when he
woke from his nap.  They are very good buddies.

I'm putting the leg pain together with the grumbling on being pushed in
bed.  It makes sense now.  If Pirate was grumbling because he didn't
like being jostled or because he thought he belonged on the bed while
others didn't, it was a behavior problem.  If he was grumbling because
the movement on the bed was hurting his leg, he was communicating that
something was wrong in the only way he knew.

I don't think thats what the grumbling is.  He runs and jumps and plays
without any indication of pain.  If I moved on the bed, slightly, not
touching him, he bitches. If he can jump off the couch without pain it would
seem weird that moving on the bed slightly (not moving him) would hurt.

I'm still unsure because sometimes he uses it as an excuse to play with me.
He starts wrestling.
He has me perplexed.  So in the meantime he goes on the floor when he puffs.

Sorry to hear about Pirate's problems.  Hubby and I were off visiting his
family in Indiana earlier this month and missed a lot of the back story
here.  (also sorry his breeder's a jerk..) I do hope it's something that can
be cleared up and not effect his long term well being.  Very glad he's found
a wonderful and loving home though.  having had several dogs with medical
issues, (and one that's just insane, but then, she's a JRT...) it can be
hard to watch them struggle, but it is so worth having them in our lives and
knowing that just maybe you're making sure their lives are the better for
it.
