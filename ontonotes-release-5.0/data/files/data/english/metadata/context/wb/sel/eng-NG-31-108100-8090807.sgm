Though I've often been accused of repeating DNC &quot;propaganda&quot;,  I've
only recently seen such &quot;literature&quot;....
I guess some &quot;Democratic Operative&quot; left a copy of &quot;Broadside,  the
voice of SLO Co. Democratic Party&quot; in a local coffee shop?
I picked it up,  and was spellbound!  Thank heavens no right thinking
Republican found it first,  and &quot;removed&quot; it as part of his / her &quot;civic
duty&quot;,  lest the weak minded might become beguiled by such a
publication!
On the cover of this tabloid,  there was a photo of prominent Democrat
&quot;Jack O'Conner&quot;,  State Superintendent of Schools,  and several other
SLO Co Democrats,  who were among the 3,414 Democrats,  giddy from
attending the California Democratic Convention!
They all looked they were having a wonderful time!  HawHawHaw!
The Democratic agenda was written for all to see!
1.  Elect more Democrats!
2.  Find Democratic candidates!
3.  Register Voters

When I read that issue of &quot;Broadside&quot;,  I realized there was something
bigger than myself,  and I wasn't alone any more!  Hallelujah!
HawHawHaw!

Absolutly and always. Then they will have a spokesman from each side of the

You just don't like me,  because I draw attention to your
&quot;shortcomings&quot; as a &quot;know it all fussbudget&quot;,  that what it is,  isn't
it?
I imagine it is sort of embarrassing,  to have others know about the
way you talked poor Mrs Hatch into cleaning outhouses,  so you could be
a &quot;professional yakker&quot; in Yellowstone!
I guess that's where you got to thinking being a &quot;GSA&quot; might give you
the authority ask other posters on RORT,  &quot;May I see you papers,
please!&quot;?
It seems like you'd know better than trying to be a &quot;net nanny&quot;,  after
all these years,  but I guess when you get angry, you don't mind looking
silly?
Why don't you have a vote,  on who the other posters like the best, &quot;
Campground Agent Hatch&quot;,   or &quot;their old pal Don&quot;!  If I knew people
didn't like me,  I might leave,  and never come back!  HawHawHaw!

Bob would rather stay away from contests of &quot;personal magnetism&quot;.
He's well aware most readers of RORT see just exactly &quot;what's really
going on&quot;,  with his wife running around with a mop,  and slop jar,
while Bob is inside,  being a &quot;professional yakker&quot;.  HawHawHaw!
I guess this is an offhanded way to cast your vote for &quot;Kommandant
Hatch&quot;,  the &quot;gatekeeper of Yellowstone&quot;!  So one vote for &quot;Yakker&quot;
Hatch!  Looks like it will be a landslide for Bob!  HawHawHaw!
I can imagine a play,  where Bob &amp; Mary Hatch,  meet up for some
&quot;quality time&quot; after a hard day's work,  of cleaning,  picking up after
slobs,  and standing in the sun,  while Bob is giving his jaw a work
out!  Hardee-Har-Har-Har!
I hope all of you RORT posters are ready for a 1st chapter of &quot;Fun

Problem is that you are once again pulling shit out of your ass without a
clue as to what reality is.

You are, to this group, as worthless as any one of the other trolls. What a
sad pathetic life that a person with no interest in RV's has to hang out on
an RV group to gain some satisfaction in life.

&gt; while Bob is inside,  being a &quot;professional yakker&quot;.  HawHawHaw!

&gt; Hatch&quot;,  the &quot;gatekeeper of Yellowstone&quot;!  So one vote for &quot;Yakker&quot;
&gt; Hatch!  Looks like it will be a landslide for Bob!  HawHawHaw!
&gt;   I can imagine a play,  where Bob &amp; Mary Hatch,  meet up for some

Ya' know Don, I generally enjoy your posts; BUT, I think you're
waaaaaaaaaaaaay off base on this one and need to give it a rest. I went back
and looked at the post you're all on about. With much snippage here are the
relevant parts:

&quot;Fishing Bridge has two positions. GSA and Campground Attendants. I'm a GSA,
Mary is a Campground Attendant.&quot;

&quot;I'm working about 30 hours per week, different shifts, but I'm having fun
with it. Like Kevin said, I'm a Master Yakker, so I enjoy talking with the
folks.&quot;

&quot;Mary's job is a Campground Attendant, and there are 8, counting the &quot;lead&quot;.
She stands in the parking lot and directs incoming traffic into temporary
parking places so they can register. Our front parking lot is so small that
when we get really busy if we didn't have traffic control in the lot, we
would have traffic backed up out onto the road. One of the things they do
when the people pull into the lot, they write down their RV license number
on a small piece of paper, and hand that to them as they walk to the office.
Lots of people in rental rigs and those who use the rig a couple of times a
year. They don't know the license number, and they will need it when they
check in. She also helps clean the showers, and that is done 2 times a day.
She cleans the laundry room, 4 or more times per day, goes out into the RV
park and helps clean the &quot;Comfort Stations&quot;, and other assorted duties. Most
of her time is spent outdoors.

We do have 2 other positions. Cashier and Activities. The cashier collects
for showers, sell misc. sundry items, and makes change for folks when
needed. The Activities person sells tours to the guests. Both are classified
as GSA's.

OK, we both like our jobs, and a major part of that has to do with the
people we work with. All the folks in these positions are retired, RV'ers,
and about 1/2 of them full timers. Some of them have been doing these jobs
for 5 or more years, 2 or 3 couples are in their first season like us, and
we just got a new replacement couple who will start working on Wednesday.&quot;

Several things strike me: 1) It looks like they both had some choice in
the jobs they took, 2) they're only working about 30 hours a week and Mary
is doing a lot more than just cleaning restrooms, 3) She's working
outdoors - a big plus in my book, especially where they're working, 4)
they're both enjoying their jobs, 5) Bob strikes me as a smart enough guy,
so I assume his wife is pretty sharp too. My wife and I sometimes work
together. We make a good team. But, you know what? There are times when it's
nice for both of us to get away from each other for awhile. It sounds like
they have a good deal going. I might do it myself someday, even if I don't
get to be an indoor yakker, and when I get right down to it that might not
be my first choice either. While you're......................?

Thanks for reading the original post. What Don didn't want to take the time
to understand is that Mary was offered 1/2 time as GSA and 1/2 time as
Attendant. Well, if fact both of us were. She spent 1 day in training on the
computer and said that if she had to work inside and take care of a cash
drawer she didn't want the job at all. We both wanted the outside positions,
and the only way that I could make this work was for me to take the GSA
position, that I preferred not to have and give up on any chance of working
outdoors.

Don wouldn't understand something like that. He seems to get a kick out of
insulting her and her job that she wanted, and enjoys. It's who Don is and
what he does.

By the way, Don's started this in the original thread, but took it to a
whole new level because I posted this in response to something Mike Hendrix
posted about him:

&quot;I particularly like his vast knowledge of RV's, the RV lifestyle, and RV
travel. His contributions in these areas have been, well indescribable.&quot;

Perhaps Mrs Hatch really was looking forward to policing up the
campground,  directing traffic out in the elements,  and cleaning
&quot;comfort stations&quot;,  just so you could wear your &quot;Xanterra Hat&quot;,  and
give the old,  &quot;Welcome to Yellowstone Park&quot; speech,  while in the
office,  but I don't think so!
I suspect she did it to please you,  and help you get the job as
&quot;master yakker&quot;.
Could you have just hired on as a single employee,  if she'd just
wanted to sit in the RV and watch TV,  or read a book?
I got the idea that both of you had to be employees,  to get whatever
&quot;perks&quot; RVers get in Yellowstone,   working for Xanterra?  Is that true?
Your whining about me &quot;insulting&quot; Mrs Hatch,  sounds like a cry for
sympathy from other posters,  when it was you who started this squabble!
It sounds like you're getting upset,  just like Mike Hendrix
mentioned!  HawHawHaw!
You ought to be pleased that your &quot;lifestyle&quot; would draw &quot;groupies&quot;,
who vicariously enjoy RVing,  while sitting in their rocking chairs,
and be nice to them,  rather than &quot;insulting&quot;  such &quot;lesser beings&quot;!
I think my suspicions about Mrs Hatch signing on with Xanterra,
cleaning outhouses,  so you can be a &quot;master yakker&quot; hit a nerve!
Why would you imply that I don't belong here?  I've been posting on
RORT for ten years.  Get used to me!  HawHawHaw!

Lon, I know it's hard for you to understand, but not everyone who
disagrees with you does so because she/he has a low IQ.

In fact, in Don's case, I haven't seen any evidence of that at all. I
have no reason to suspect -- from reading his posts and yours, over a
number of years -- that his IQ is substantially different from yours.

Your frequent insults might be more believable if you could pick one
that has some semblance of accuracy to it, rather than the schoolyard
taunts that you toss around here so freely.

I guess it wasn't readily apparent. It wasn't Bob I was trying to do a
favor for. He seems to be handling himself just fine. It was you I was
trying to look out for. You're working on Lon's level of rationality and
shooting for his level of posting. Bob and I have disagreed enough that I
get the distinct impression that I am not one of his favorite posters here.
The way it looks to me you and I have a lot more in common, which is strange
for me considering our very different backgrounds.

What the reseachers tell us about online instant voting is that it
tends to be a matter of mob rule. Bob is contributing interesting stuff to
the discussion of RVing. You're contributing &quot;ankle biting&quot;. If you're
contributing anything it's to discourage others from posting about their
adventures lest they draw some ankle-biter on about who knows what. If I was
going to vote for anything it would be for you to drop this particular line
of BS. You're only making yourself look foolish.

&quot;He started it&quot;, sounds like something Lon or one of the other guys
who's well advanced into &quot;Geezerhood&quot; would say. You *are* insulting Mrs.
Hatch. You're saying she isn't smart enough to make up her own mind or
independent enough to make it stick. It looks like you're wrong on both
counts. If you think you have some reason to go after Bob the least you
could do is go after him directly and leave his wife out of it. My
suggestion would be to leave it alone entirely. You're behind on points and
it doesn't look like you have any way to make it up.

If anything it looks like Bob is the one who hit a nerve. You're
stampeding and it doesn't look like you know when or how to stop. Going
after someone's wife gets on people's nerves, but that's a very different
thing from &quot;hitting&quot; a nerve.

I got to thinking about it when I was making my last post on this
subject. Here lately I've ended up disagreeing with a number of your posts.
The one thing those posts had in common was that they were all pretty
negative. It made me wonder if you needed to take a deep breath, assess
where you're coming from, and maybe do something to get back onto a more
positive outlook. You labeled it OT, but your one good on topic post lately
was that music festival thing. It was after all a potential RV destination,
and for me that is what RORT is about--going places and doing things--the RV
is just a tool to help accomplish that goal.

I don't believe you have the brains to understand it.

Your whining about me &quot;insulting&quot; Mrs Hatch,

No Donny, it's not whining. It's pointing out that for some reason or
another you find it necessary to continue to insult Mary's choices. It's a
cowardly thing to do, but not unexpected of you.

sounds like a

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Well, Donny, that's just one more lie, but that's not unusual for you.

On 8/7 I posted the thread, &quot;Working in Yellowstone, long.&quot;

On 8/9, you posted a reply to that thread, and while you started the post
with a positive statement, you, in typical fashion couldn't leave well
enough alone. You had to take it down hill, in typical fashion for you. The
implication being that Mary could not make her own choices in life, and was
somehow controlled by me. That may be the type of relationship you have, but
it's not ours. So the guy who started it was you. I answered that post, but
you chose to ignore it.

On 8/12 Mike Hendrix posted, in response to my &quot;Don has a goat?&quot; post, that
you had you had &quot;Pet turkeys&quot;

On that same day I posted &quot;Don't you mean &quot;Don is a pet turkey&quot;?&quot;

Now, I'll admit that referring to you as a &quot;Pet turkey&quot; was inappropriate
and an insult to turkeys. Asshole, prick, jerk and several other words would
have been a better description.
HawHawHaw!

Again, on that same day, I posted &quot;I particularly like his vast knowledge of
RV's, the RV lifestyle, and RV
travel. His contributions in these areas have been, well indescribable.&quot;

That statement Donny is a fact, not an insult!

You can do what you want to do with your pathetic life. You still have
nothing of value to offer to an RV group. You can't offer &quot;valid, accurate

water pumps, furnaces, stoves, ovens, RV upkeep and maintenance, RV parks,
RV hookups, boondocking, dry camping or any of the hundreds of other RV

Oh good grief! What sort of conservative are you? Bob has already said
that she has to earn her own hat. A good solid conservative answer. Now you
want him to _give_ her a hat to put *your* mind at ease at no cost to

&gt;the discussion of RVing. You're contributing &quot;ankle biting&quot;. If you're
&gt;contributing anything it's to discourage others from posting about their

Very good assessment.  Lampson is one of my killfile residents that I kinda hated to

Is this the Don that replies in a line-by-line diatribe against an
original poster while peppering his comments with laughter?  If so, my
kill file is still working.

It is surprising how many posters can't put together an original
thought.  They comment against line-by-line or paragraph-by-paragraph
quotations.  They leave nothing of their own behind.

I wonder if they treat their families in that manner?

If you were in Florida, you'd have a point - but umbrellas don't

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sheesh. This ain't rocket science.
&gt;&gt; Ain't rocket science my ass. Now you want me to carry a damned
&gt;&gt; umbrella in lightning country. What the hell have you got against me
&gt;&gt; anyway?

&gt; If you live a few more years, look at the bright side, you'll probably get
&gt; bald, and won't need a hat OR an umbrella :)

Bald? The asshole isn't even gray yet. No compassion for his fellow
geezers. None.
