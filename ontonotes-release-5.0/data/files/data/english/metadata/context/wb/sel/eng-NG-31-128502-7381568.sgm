Hi all,
I've been experimenting with Dreamweaver to make some what I thought
were rather basic changes to a standard Blogger template.  However,
when I try to upload my template and replace the standard Blogger one
I currently have, I get numerous error messages about the strict code
requirements.  All that I've changed of the basic page is some text
and background colors and added two images!  Why is Blogger's system
refusing to let me post with 99% of their own original code still
intact?
Help... are there any tricks that I should know or specifics to pay
attention to?

Thanks in advance,
Julie
