To whom it may concern

I recently found the wonderful research tools Scribe and Zotero. While
it seems that many are migrating from Scribe over to Zotero I would
like to use both of them. This is because I really need Scribes
ability to handle author and event cards in some cases. Zotero on the
other hand is perfect for retrieving references while searching the
Internet. I have tried all the export formats in Zoteros pull down
menu and I can't get any of them imported to Scribe. The only way I
have managed to get a reference from Zotero to Scibe is via EndNote,
but that isn't really efficient. So it would be really helpful if
anybody has any suggestions about how I could solve this.

I hope my English has been understandable.

Greetings from a Norwegian history student.

Try exporting from Zotero in RIS format and importing using &quot;Import
Bibliographic Citation&quot; option. Are you using Mac or PC? Do you need
to import tags and notes also?

Thanks,
Elena

Thank you for the response Elena.

I have tried exporting from Zotero in RIS format and importing using
&quot;Import Bibliographic Citation&quot; option again. This works only
partially though. I have tried some different exports from Zotero
(that is exporting only one item, several items, different items and
so on) and have found some problems:

1. Books that have been imported to Scribe only have the authors last
name (i.e. the first name doesn't import?).
2. Book titles get amputated after comma. So every thing after the
comma is left out.
3. A problem for me using Norwegian references is that the Norwegian
characters æ, ø, å gets scrambled. They work fine i Zotero, but
doesn't get imported well.
4. While importing reference for video recording all the information
except publisher and release disappear(?).

I have also tried importing the same RIS files to EndNote and they
work much better there. The names get correct and even keywords get
imported. So it seems it's Scribes import feature that's not working
properly(?).

If it is possible to fix any of this it would be great. And I would
also like to import tags and notes. It would pretty much be fine to
import as much as possible.

And I'm on a Mac.

Thanks,
Fredrik

Fredrik--
Ok, it seems Zotero uses different RIS tags for export than Endnote.
Thanks for letting me know--I'll fix this shortly. Could you email me
a sample Zotero RIS export file, so I can test the import of
Norwegian characters?
Thanks,
Elena
