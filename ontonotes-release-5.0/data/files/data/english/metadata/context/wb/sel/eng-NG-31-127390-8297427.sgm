It looks like a reasonably balanced article: the objective is indeed
very controversial. My take on it is that it can't be done in any
meaningful fashion.

The other point that jumps out at me is that Ruhlen is talking out of
his field of expertise when he posits a major transition at 50 kya.
The first thing is that it's much too late: the migration from Africa
that's recorded in the mtDNA and Y chromosome is at least 10 ky
earlier, and possibly as much as 30 ky earlier. The 50kya date appears
to be based on European fossils; I beleve there are much earlier ones
in Africa.

However, regardless of whether they achieve their objective (very
doubtful), the freely accessable linguistic data base ought to be
quite useful.

Do you have reason to believe that the neural architecture underlying
chimp calls is evolutionarily akin to the neural architecture
underlying language?

The fact that every human infant everywhere can learn any human
language perfectly tells me that all modern humans possess the _same_
evolved biological support of language. If different language
abilities evolved in different populations, the others didn't survive
(not necessarily because their linguistic ability specifically wasn't
better).

Among people with developmental disabilities one can find mute persons
with rather good intelligence.  These people demonstrate that it is
necessary to add some qualifications to the statement that all
children can learn any language.

But, as Peter points out, no one has ever detected any differences
between target languages. Moreover these people, although mute, often
seem to understand all, or least much, speech spoken around them.

In general I believe linguists have failed to investigate the speech
capabilities of the developmentally disabled.  Some valuable insights
might be being overlooked.

Purl Gurl?

You didn't just claim that every human infant could learn any language as
its first language.  You claimed any language could be learnt perfectly.
That strains my credulity.

Most of us are well aware of idiosyncratic failures to acquire one's first
language perfectly - e.g 'Woy' Jenkins.  In some cases there may be
systematic trends in these imperfections inherent in the language - any work
on that?  Languages in Southern China (and North-Eastern SE Asia) have a
tendency to lisping - what drives that?  On the other hand, I find it hard
to see that the tendency to eliminate /r/ from SE Asian phoneme inventories
is genetic.

Such claims as there are of genetic bases to language differences tend to
assume slowly working effects.  But why should something as recently
developed as language have a uniform genetic basis?  Has the best achievable
already been achieved?

At the simplest, consider the notion of 'universal grammar' with
language-dependent switch settings.  Is there any reason that the
preferences for various settings should not be affected genetically?  It
would be most unlike other human charactersitics if there were no genetic
component.

Good data on language acquisition is likely to be hard to obtain - it would
probably have to be based on interracial adoption of babies.

I think you overstate the case.  Plenty of linguists of various
subspecialisms have studied developmental disorders.  You could find
introductory material in most psycholinguistics text books and there
are plenty of journals in the field (Clinical Linguistics and
Phonetics comes to mind).  A few names off the top of my head Heather

I do not consider &quot;the notion of 'universal grammar' with language-

I think he's mistakenly extrapolating some genetic basis for a
phenomenon that can be explained much more simply: allophony of /s/
and /th/ in many languages.

In Japan there are people with what would be considered a lisp here in
the US, but since /s/ and /th/ are allophonic in Japanese, it's not
recognized as a problem (since it isn't one), and isn't corrected in
school, the way it is here. In fact, a lot of Japanese people can't
even tell that someone is lisping.

I reply to both Peter and Jimbo.

There are many people around who are mute.  I am speaking now, not of
infants, where language acquisition is the matter being discussed, but
of functioning adults. So far as I know, all of these people are
developmentally disabled (who used to be called &quot;retarded&quot; or worse
things).

I don't know of any systematic study of mute adults which extends to
the point of trying to determine just how much brain damage can be
detected. I know of no cases where brain damage was detected by any
medical test.  The brain damage is inferred from the fact that the
person is mute. This is, of course, a circular definition.

The same applies to persons who are verbal, but only in restricted
ways. I know one young man whose normal speech is almost
incomprehensible but who, when he imitates the conversation he has
heard on fire department broadcast bands, speaks perfectly (in the
phonetic sense). Thus we know he can articulate English perfectly,
given the right circumstances, but his normal speech is quite
defective.

So speaking English perfectly is a matter of, infortunately, how you
define &quot;perfectly&quot;. Perhaps a testable definition would be useful.

Jimbo points to a literature of speech therapy, not one of linguistic
analysis.  Most of these articles seem to me to be hard-core Chomskian
trivia which, as Peter points out, is not a valid linguistic construct.

Actually the &quot;testable definition&quot; in much of the literature is to do
with interaction: does someone's performance appear to lead to
_repair_ situations in spoken interaction (one of the many influences

I am surprised that you think this.  Bill Wells is a phonologist who's
work is grounded in ethnomethodology: about as far form a hard-core
Chomskian as you can get.  I suppose that Irenen Tsimpli would count
although iirc she currently works in Optimality and Relevance
Theoretic frameworks.  Heather van der Lely is a psycholinguist who I
think is theoretically probably pretty agnostic on the detail of
syntactic theory but in general closer to Pinker's stance than
Chomsky's.  The literature I mentioned specifically is *linguistic*
and not the literature of speech therapy - although there is
inevitably some overlap when linguists study pathological cases.  I am
disappointed that you appear to me to be both moving the goal posts
(ie language dealing with clinical data is not linguistics but speech
therapy) and dismissing inconvenient data (ie if there appears to be
linguistic research in the field it's Chomskyan trivia and
irrelevant).  Peter has an informed adversarial view of Chomskyan
linguistics - as do many other linguists.  At the same time large
numbers of linguists hold views close to Chomsky's (even one or two
who contribute here occasionally).  Whether you agree with Chomskyan
views or not they are currently perfectly mainstream linguistics.

I responded to your observation with a suggestion that you overstated
the case and I gave some informal evidence that this was so.  You have
made a riposte but I haven't yet seen any evidence for what you say
whether about adult mutes or about research in speech and language
pathology.  Can you perhaps tell us where we can find reports
supporting your assertions?

Thanks in advance,

Jimbo

Maybe we have an issue of someone pretending to be a poet in a

Actually it's a lack of contrast with one of three members being taken as

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In Japan there are people with what would be considered a lisp here in

What's interesting is that in Southern China there seem to be many dialects
(of various language families) for which [s] is not the typical sound.  This
may be an areal phenomenon, and I actually doubt that it this has a genetic
basis.  In some cases there may actually be phonetic motivation, as one can
see in Turkmen, where pronouncing /s/ as [T] increases the contrast with
/S/, and something of this sort presumably happened in Burmese.

I am curious how many developmentally disabled adults you have

Of course, you can explain that that you mean 1 or 2 per thousand of
total human population (I am guessing) by &quot;relatively rare&quot;.
Considering how many people there are, this is a usage of rare that is
dangerously misleading. I suppose that is is possible for a person to
be made mute by throat damage or some such mechanism (even religious
vows) but no examples have ever been offered for my attention.

I consider the probability that it has too small to spend any time on.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I reply to both Peter andJimbo.

&gt; &gt; &gt; There are many people around who are mute.  I am speaking now, not of

&gt; &gt; &gt; of functioning adults. So far as I know, all of these people are
&gt; &gt; &gt; developmentally disabled (who used to be called &quot;retarded&quot; or worse
&gt; &gt; &gt; things).

&gt; &gt; I think we need some clarification.  Not all adult mutes are
&gt; &gt; developmentally disordered/disabled.  Not all developmental disorder
&gt; &gt; leads to mutism.  Mutism as the result of developmental disorder is
&gt; &gt; _relatively_ rare (specific language impairments short of a complete
&gt; &gt; loss of linguistic communication is _far_ more common.)

&gt; I am curious how many developmentally disabled adults you have
&gt; actually become familiar with.

For the record, five years once a week observation at a clinic for
adults with communication disorders; seven years supervising
undergraduate and post graduate research in speech and language
disorder - both developmental and adult.  I didn't become familiar
with all of the adults who had some developmental disorder but I
encountered a hell of a lot.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

It is relatively rare wouldn't - relative (as I intended the context
to imply) to the occurence of language impairement in general.  But
where does the figure come from.  I did a crude google scholar/PubMed

&gt; I suppose that is is possible for a person to

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know of any systematic study of mute adults which extends to
&gt; &gt; &gt; the point of trying to determine just how much brain damage can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; detected. I know of no cases where brain damage was detected by any
&gt; &gt; &gt; medical test.  The brain damage is inferred from the fact that the
&gt; &gt; &gt; person is mute. This is, of course, a circular definition.
&gt; &gt; Well, I haven't looked but I will.  Of course, there's nothing
&gt; &gt; particularly linguistic about such an enterprise.  I have never seen
&gt; &gt; any literature inferring brain damage from muteness but I'll look for
&gt; &gt; that too.  Could you please give some references?

&gt; What Peter said (&quot;Every human infant can acquire any human language

How does this commonplace address the question?  I am beginning to
wonder if you aren't just making this stuff up.  What literature is
there that no medical tests ever detect brain damage in cases of

&gt; &gt; &gt; The same applies to persons who are verbal, but only in restricted

&gt; &gt; &gt; incomprehensible but who, when he imitates the conversation he has
&gt; &gt; &gt; heard on fire department broadcast bands, speaks perfectly (in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; phonetic sense). Thus we know he can articulate English perfectly,
&gt; &gt; &gt; given the right circumstances, but his normal speech is quite
&gt; &gt; &gt; defective.

&gt; &gt; People who stutter (ie have a motor coordination based dysfluency)

&gt; &gt; &gt; So speaking English perfectly is a matter of, infortunately, how you
&gt; &gt; &gt; define &quot;perfectly&quot;. Perhaps a testable definition would be useful.
&gt; &gt; Actually the &quot;testable definition&quot; in much of the literature is to do
&gt; &gt; with interaction: does someone's performance appear to lead to
&gt; &gt; _repair_ situations in spoken interaction (one of the many influences

Roughly a &quot;repair situation&quot; is in the literature of Conversation
Analysis, where the behaviour of the participants in a communicative
situation is interpreted as indicating a problem in speaking, hearing

important topic.

You are using a circular definition of impaired. There are hundreds,
maybe thousands, of people in the United States who show no overt sign
of defects, except what is now called developmental disability, who do
not speak. That these people are in some sense impaired is deduced
from their disability.  I do not know the administrative jargon
elsewhere, but in California you can find them in practically any
level 4I community care home.

There are serious statistical problems with the metrics involved in
measuring developmental disability. The difficulties lie at the low
end of the scale. General principles lead us to expect that any metric
for intelligence that we might use should be in some symmetric around
a norm. But for all the tests for intelligence that I know there is
very poor symmetry between the ends of the scale.

This is usually explained by assuming damage being done at the lower
end and, indeed, considerable damage can be observed to be happening.
But damage is not observable in, I believe, a majority of cases other
than that &quot;intelligence&quot; is reduced. It seems to be perfectly possible
that a human being who is unfortunate enough to fall several sigmas
(metaphorically) to the wrong side of the norm might not be able to
master speech.

I hasten to add that there is, so far as I know, no evidence
supporting this speculation. But neither is there any evidence
precluding it. The noise from trauma events masks the effect I am
talking about - remember something like 5% of all births involve
defects of one kind or another.

Probably we need to restate what I called a commonplace of linguistics
as something like &quot;No human child who develops normally fails to learn
human speech&quot;. This includes an overt recognition that I am assuming
&quot;develops normally&quot; includes speech and is just as circular as the
preceding statement. I observe that Peter has changed his statement
from &quot;damaged&quot; to &quot;impaired&quot;. This is a more in the right direction
but we need to go a little further.

QED, no?

No infant acquires part of a language and stops. If it's taken to a
different environment, it acquires the new language. If it's in a
multi-lingual environment, it acquires multiple languages.

The Nariokotome boy?  The 'entire history of humanity' is too long a period
unless you define language to have preceded humanity.  To your question as
phrased, I suggest 'wolf children' as an obvious if unhelpful example.

I wasn't actually challenging the idealisation that every human infant can
adequately acquire a language.  I was more interested in 'different but
equal' responses to the same stimulus.

We can provide examples of apparently unimpaired individuals who did not
*perfectly* acquire the language of the environment into which they were
born!  Some of the deficiencies are minor - faulty selection of the Canadian
English /ai/ allophones, making them clearly phonemically contrastive in one
idiolect, as opposed to relying on the potential minimal pair of 'writer'
and 'rider'; /tUf/ for 'tooth' in one British idiolect; Japanese /s/
pronounced [T] in many idiolects.  Idiosyncrasies of grammar are more
difficult to confirm, as the grammar of the environment may not be
sufficiently well known, and children are frequently exposed to alternative
grammars.  The phoneme very broadly denoted as /r/ is cross-linguistically
difficult to acquire as one learns one's language, and many people fail.

It's a bit irritating that you all pretend not to understand him, and he
doesn't bother to be more explicit.

The issue was 1) whether human languages all derive from a single
ancestor, and 2) how much of human language is inborn. (1) is implied by
the reasonable degree of similarity between them all, while (2) might
explain said similarity wihtout recourse to (1), but would also make (1)
more likely.

In defense of (2), he pointed out that a child's ability to learn a
given language is per se unrelated to the parents' proficiency in that
language. That is, just because your parents speak Korean, that doesn't
make you any more or less gifted to learn Korean or Swahili. This point
may be debated, but it's plain to see that it has *no relation
whatsoever* to 'imperfect 1st language acquisition' and derived issues.

Stick to the point, damnit. Has the LSDisease become contagious?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; afflicted individuals are not human?
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know what _you're_ talking about.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you have any evidence that, say, a Korean-ancestry child or a Cree-
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ancestry child or a Dyirbal-ancestry child or a Yoruba-ancestry child
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has any difficulty acquiring English as its first language? or vice
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; versa?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Purl Gurl?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You didn't just claim that every human infant could learn any language as
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its first language.  You claimed any language could be learnt perfectly.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That strains my credulity.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Every human infant can acquire any human language perfectly. (There is
&gt; &gt; &gt; always the proviso, Barring severe brain damage. The language faculty
&gt; &gt; &gt; is incredibly robust, and it takes _very_ severe brain abnormality to
&gt; &gt; &gt; interfere with language acquisition.)

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most of us are well aware of idiosyncratic failures to acquire one's first
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; language perfectly - e.g 'Woy' Jenkins.  In some cases there may be
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; systematic trends in these imperfections inherent in the language - any work
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on that?  Languages in Southern China (and North-Eastern SE Asia) have a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendency to lisping - what drives that?  On the other hand, I find it hard
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to see that the tendency to eliminate /r/ from SE Asian phoneme inventories
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is genetic.

&gt; &gt; &gt; ?? Languages lisp?? I can't even imagine what you mean.

&gt; &gt; Well, Turkmen does lisp. His Excellency Saparmurat Niyazov's name is
&gt; &gt; in correct standard Turkmen pronounced as Thaparmurat Niyathov.
&gt; &gt; Turkmen is not even a particularly exotic language - it is closely
&gt; &gt; related to Turkish proper.-

&gt; What does that have to do with &quot;lisping&quot;?
">

Lisping means using [T] instead of [s]. In Turkmen,  [T] is a
recognized variant of [s] - in fact,  [T] is the mainstream allophone
of the [s] phoneme (i.e. the phoneme that is in the neighboring
languages and in dialects realized as [s]). In this particular sense,
Turkmen can be said to &quot;lisp&quot;, especially from the point of view of
the speakers of other Oghuz Turk languages, who AFAIK don't recognize
[T] as a valid standard representation of the [s] phoneme.

Except that he didn't bother saying what the examples were. I don't
see what regional dialectal variation has to do with imperfect
acquisition anyway.

Unless he's mired in the 1964 early generative view of historical
linguistics, which could only envision language change as occurring
during acquisition, with imperfect transmission of &quot;rules&quot; from
generation to generation?

A Penn dissertation (by Daniel Johnson) directed by Labov has just

isogloss -- its historical origin and its transmission to today's
children -- and all 500+ pages of it are downloadable.

vowels of Southeastern New England

Subject Language(s): English (eng)

Dissertation Director(s):
William Labov

Dissertation Abstract:

This dissertation focused on the low vowels in the area between
Boston, MA
and Providence, RI. Today, most speakers in Providence have a low
central
/ah = o/ in FATHER and BOTHER, and a distinct raised back /oh/ in
DAUGHTER.
This configuration of two vowels, also common in western New England
and
elsewhere in the U.S., will be called the Mid-Atlantic / Inland North
system (MAIN). Boston speakers also have two low vowels, but /ah/ is
fronted, with /o = oh/ merged in low back position: this is the unique
Eastern New England system (ENE).

A review of earlier descriptions and recordings of these varieties
(Chapter
2) shows that a system of three distinct low vowels, such as is found
in
England, was original to colonial New England and survived into the
19th
century. Complementary mergers then developed in the two parts of the
territory -- /ah/~/o/ in Providence, /o/~/oh/ in Boston -- but their
patterning in time and space indicate internally-motivated change, not
any
type of diffusion.

The geographic study (Chapter 4) located the resulting boundary
between the
two dialects by interviewing c. 180 senior citizens and young adults
in 40
cities and towns. For the older group, there was a sharp boundary
between
the MAIN and ENE systems, generally matching colonial settlement
patterns
despite the two-vowel systems themselves being much newer. Most young
adults agreed with their senior citizen counterparts. Some were
unclear or
had merged all three categories, but in general, during the twentieth
century, mergers did not 'expand at the expense of distinctions'.

In the family study (Chapter 5), several MAIN communities which had
appeared stable showed sudden /o/~/oh/ merger among children, leading
to a
one-vowel system. Interviews with c. 35 families revealed this
especially
in South Attleboro MA (under 18 merged) and in Seekonk MA (under 10
merged). These age-based changes divided some families between older
(distinct) and younger (merged) siblings, although the youngest
children
were seen to pattern with their (distinct) parents. Children initially
acquire their parents' systems, then reorganize them upon forming peer
groups, but are fairly stable from then on. To explain why the mergers
happened in the order they did, the 'migration hypothesis' proposed
that
when a certain proportion of merged young children enter a peer group,
those from distinct backgrounds abandon their distinction.

The migration hypothesis was supported with data from the U.S. Census
and
the school survey (Chapter 3), which focused on the factors affecting
individuals' acquisition of the low vowels. A simple minimal pair
questionnaire was administered to c. 1500 schoolchildren, and the
results
analyzed by mixed-model logistic regression. The details of subjects'
biographies consistently affected their responses. In ENE, students
who had
moved from MAIN areas -- even years earlier -- marked more /o/~/oh/
pairs
'different' than natives did. And even for 12th graders, parents
played
an important role, if they were from other dialect areas. Mothers had
a
greater effect overall, especially on their daughters, while fathers'
smaller effect was primarily on their sons. These perception-like
patterns
are more intermediate and complex than the production patterns
recorded in
the other studies.

No, LANGUAGES do not lisp. PEOPLE with &quot;speech defects&quot; lisp.

Your claim is no more than that /s/ (not &quot;[s]&quot;) is realized [T] in
this language. That is not a &quot;speech defect&quot; (any more than it is in
some varieties of Spanish).

I was making the point that at some stage in our history we have shifted
from not having language to typically having language.  In the latter case
there will at some stage frequently have been individuals having language
having full siblings who did not have language, which raises the issue of
whether full siblings are either both human or both non-human.  (I gather
that there is a form of baptism for when it is not clear that the creature
being baptised has a soul, so we should not require that a full sibling of a
human being be human.)  Now, I suspect there need not be a clean-cut
distinction between having and not having language - just as there are
useful intermediate stages between having a vertebrate eye and not having
one.  (The vertebrate eye has been claimed as a system that could not have
come into being by evolution because it is useless if any major component is
missing.)  I could be wrong - language, in the wider sense including sign
language, might conceivably be an exaptation of another ability and
requiring just a single change to bring it about.  Becoming capable of
articulating modern human speech does seem to be a complicated matter.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relying on the potential minimal pair of 'writer' and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 'rider'; /tUf/ for 'tooth' in one British idiolect;
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Japanese /s/ pronounced [T] in many idiolects.
&gt;&gt; They certainly look to me like prima facie examples of
&gt;&gt; imperfect acquisition of the surrounding language.
&gt; Except that he didn't bother saying what the examples were. I don't
&gt; see what regional dialectal variation has to do with imperfect
&gt; acquisition anyway.
">

Who suggested it did?

The examples I gave all appear to be individual failures, not dialect
differences.

Canadian English is the background for the example of a fault (or, at the
very least, anomalous) allocation of what are normally regarded as
allophones of Canadian English /ai/.

The key point of /tUf/ is that it was /tUf/ (subsequently modified to /tUT/
when the speaker deliberately acquired the distinction between /f/ and /T/)
rather than /tu:f/ for 'tooth'.  I cannot determine whether the failure to
distinguish /f/ and /T/ was an individual failure in language acquisition or
peer influence.  This merger seems to be spreading through England.

Do people who copy their example lisp?  If so, it seems entirely natural to
also apply the word to languages.

&gt; Your claim is no more than that /s/ (not &quot;[s]&quot;) is realized [T] in
&gt; this language. That is not a &quot;speech defect&quot; (any more than it is in
&gt; some varieties of Spanish).
">

Are there normal varieties of Spanish that have /T/ but not /s/?  In the
context of [s]-like sounds, I can see two useful meanings to the statement
that a lanuage lisps.  One is the diachronic meaning that it has replaced
/s/ by /T/ (e.g. Burmese).  The second is the synchronic statement that it
has [T] (or [s&lt;lat&gt;]) rather than [s] as the only roughly dental fricative.
It seems that both statements apply to Turkmen.

their speakers' genetic make-up, which differs from language to language.

populations intermingle.  The people of one population would mangle or
simply fail to acquire the peculiarities of another population's language,
and they would be lost.  The languages would be homogenised by the
heterogeneity of the language acquistion systems!

I can make a prediction from this model.  Populations showing strong founder
effects should come to have more exotic languages (e.g. grammar and
phonology).  Is there any example of this?  A defect of this model is that
it makes no prediction of how long it should take to develop these exotic

Of which the relevant parts are 'every' and 'any', clearly being used to
convey the opposite of 'some human infants can acquire a certain
language better than they can acquire others'.

Let alone define what is exotic, and anyway such a trend might also come
about without that model, so unfortunately it may be useful only for
disproving it.

Then at least make it clear that the scope of debate has changed (to
something it isn't obvious that all participants are interested in).

I think a slogan like &quot;any unimpaired infant is capable of acquiring

The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA (PNAS) on 30
May 2007 contained the paper 'Linguistic tone is related to the population
frequency of the adaptive haplogroups of two brain size genes, ASPM and
Microcephalin' by Dan Dediu and D. Robert Ladd.  The paper is available
on-line via
http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/~s0340638/tonegenes/tonegenessummary.html .  Some
or all of the data used is available at
http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~s0340638/tonegenes/LingData.pdf (I haven't studied
it myself).

Although some of the discussion of the paper claims it is based on nothing
but correlation there is actually some discussion of a physical mechanism in
the paper itself.  I suspect the evidence that lead to the hypothesis is not
important in its high statistical significance - though a good check would
be to remove the Afroasiatic data (Mediterranean atonality versus
sub-Saharan tonality) and check for the significance of the rest of the
data.

It would be interesting to see how the tonal Indo-European languages fit in.
