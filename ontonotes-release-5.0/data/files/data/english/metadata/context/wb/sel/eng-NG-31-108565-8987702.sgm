Everyone knows that science has been proven wrong time and again, but
why do you think that is?  My opinion is because science works with
assumptions that depend on previous knowledge.  So its easy to build
from the start and get something more complex.  As mathematicians know
though, complexity leads to total chaos.  Say for example you were
working with electronics and found that resisters limited current.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From that knowledge you learned you could actually store a charge with
">

a capacitor.  Then from there someone discovered that electricity
could actually be amplified with a transformer, to create higher
voltages.

Amazing, but then we get so complicated that we forget the source of
the invention is actually a battery, and we have limited supplies of
batteries.  Then after that we come to find out batteries don't even
work correctly without wires, and we find out there is limited
supplies of superconducting gold.  Finally we realize that we can't
transmit the power without an electric grid, stretching across the
whole country.  Then in all the confusion we start to have blackouts
everywhere, when we should have enough energy to supply everyone.

Then later, in just the recent years we find out electricity only
really works with good electrical grounding, and no one yet
understands why.  So if you don't want your equipment damaged you need
surge protectors, because the electrical grid was built without an
understanding of grounding, or ways to prevent surges, and blackouts
during storms.  But maybe one day all of this will be rethought and we
will realize the origonal electrical component invented, the resister,
is actually a way of grounding cables, and that resisters eventually
go bad after a period of time &amp; that's whats causing all of our
electrical problems.  But no one can prove that's happening, and no
one wants to deal with the problem.

That's just an example.  When it comes to studying medicine, the
environment, psychology, early human development, nutrition, genetics,
and life in general, we know almost absolutely nothing.  Everything is
built upon statistics, and studies in laboratories on people that
aren't given any credit.  Some studies have found that women and mens
development happens almost entirely in the womb, and is the product of
the chemicals and nutrition in the mothers body, which often lead to
birth defects.  Other studies have found that children being raised in
one environment will develop completely differently than twins raised
in another area.  The same happens with the sexes, women and men
develop completely different depending on the environmental factors,
what's good for a woman may be bad for a man.  Other studies are
finding that human genes are the mechanism of development, and that
they are carried on through families forever, unless there is some
problem causing a mutation.  Scientists working in one field don't
know all the information in another field, and the popular science
often disagrees with other science.  It happens all the time.

We literally know nothing, and live in a sea of technology no one
understands.

It's part of the scientific process. Every theory is eventually shown
to be incomplete, and is replaced by a more powerful and comprehensive
theory, which is replaced in its turn.

No. We know quite a lot, though not everything, and live in a sea of
technology that quite a few people understand - obviously, not you.
Again, nobody has mastered every human technology, nor even every
aspect of any givien technology, but if you ask nicely, in the right
forum, you can almost always get good advice.

You seem like someone that knows far to little about science. How you
actually take a class(and actually learn something) before you claim to know
all about it.

Sure we might not know much relative to what the universe *may* hold but
science has done far more to advance our understand of the world than
anything else and has been more consistant then anything else.

What do you expect though? As things get more complex it gets harder to
learn about it and takes more memory to store all information.  Do your
really think that its suppose to get easier? If that was the case we would
know everything already.

Fact of the matter is, either we adapt and develop our abilities to
understand more complex things(which we have been doing a pretty good job
IMO... for all the crap that we have do deal with(Seeing that 90% of the
population only cares about fucking and sucking and the other 10% has done
all the work(actually its probably like 99.9% and 0.1%)).

If humanity ever gets to the point where knowledge/understanding is first
over entertainment, money, sex, etc... then I would expect that the rate of
knowledge will increase exponentially from whatever it is now(which might be
exponential so we would have something like e^e^x).

Of course I doubt that will ever happen cause so many people don't give a
shit about any body but themselfs.  Those people, which are essentially all
people, will ruin any chance that humanity has to do anything.  So
unfortunately wether your right or wrong won't really matter.

But believe me, science has proven itself to be the best thing we have...
the issue is not science but those who don't understand it, like yourself.

When the day comes that a scientist gets paid more than an actor we will
know we are on the right track. When people stop worshiping opra, britney,
paris, etc and start opening a book... hell, I guess any book will do...
even if its about those people, as long as they read it, then we've made a
step in the right direction.

Actually, if you look at scientific history, you'll find that attempts
to simplify science have resulted in more failures than by dealing
with the inevitable complexity.  Around 1900, it was scientific dogma
that everything of value had already been discovered and that all
further research would yield only a few more decimal points to the
generally accepted principles.  However, when they did that, the
inconsistencies of those measurements yielded a far more complex
science and previously unknown principles (e.g. Quantum mechanics).

You sound overwhelmed by technology.  Perhaps you should join a back
to nature commune or minimalist lifestyle group and see how much you
enjoy scraping bottom without the complex technology you apparently
detest.  I did something like that when it was fashionable in the
1960's.  It didn't take long to observe that poverty really does suck.

Despite your muddled logic, you also managed to miss an important
point.  It is not necessary to understand how technology works in
order to benefit from it.  There are all too many car drivers that
don't understand a Carnot heat engine or the basic principles of
kinematics.  There are consumers of processed food products that
probably would not want to know what is in and what was done to the
food they're eating.  There are many people who work on products with
no clue what the product does or the basic principles of operation.
Much as I would like to see universal scientific and mathematical
education, I don't think it should be a pre-requisite for benefiting
from the resultant technology.

Science is the quest for those answers.  Yes, we don't know everything,

Right off the bat, you've revealed how little you know about the
subject you're trying to discuss.  Two fundamental problems
in the above:

1. Statement that begin with &quot;everyone knows&quot; almost
always winds up talking about something that &quot;everyone&quot;
MISUNDERSTANDS.  This is a perfect example.

2. &quot;Science&quot; has not been &quot;proven wrong time and time
again,&quot; for the simple reason that science itself is not a body
of knowledge, nor any particular collection of &quot;facts.&quot;
Science is a PROCESS which we use to sort out truth
from a lot of things that we might like to think were so, but
which really aren't.  As that sort of tool, it has a track record
far better than any alternative that mankind has attempted to
use so far.

Certain statements or beliefs held and espoused by those
calling themselves &quot;scientists&quot; (a term which really just means
&quot;someone who does science&quot;) have been shown to be
wrong, either in their entirety or in part, quite often - but that's
the nature of the process, and you would do well to at least
try to understand how that process works before you attempt
to comment on it further.

The rest of your post seems to be citing examples of things that
you yourself do not understand, and claiming that therefore
&quot;no one&quot; understands them.  I would hope the error in such an
argument would be obvious.

Watching TV requires absolutely no effort except to keep your eyelids open.

I would agree there is a problem with the current methods
of unraveling the mysteries of our existence. The primary
problem is in our timeless habit of reducing to parts
as a first step.

People confuse data with wisdom. Just walk into any
university today and ask yourself the following question.
Is it possible for any...one..person to fully digest and
comprehend the totally of all the disciplines and data???

Of course not, no /one/ person has that ability.

Then ask yourself another question. Every day
what happens to the total data and knowledge?
It increases, and with it the disciplines become
more detailed, specialized and numerous.

So, our method of reducing to parts creates a
relationship where the possibility of true wisdom
a 'grand  theory'....decreases...every single day
that goes by.

Or, reducing to parts as a method of understanding
generates data that goes towards infinity over time.

The answer to this problem is rather simple, if
reducing to parts generates an incomprehensible
mound of data, most of it useless to those outside
the narrow specialty. Then the solution is to merely
inverse our method of understanding, we expand
to system behavior first, instead of first reducing
to the part details.

Instead of part details generating our scientific laws.
System behavior should be our first source of
knowledge.

This is essentially what chaos theory, now called
complexity science, is doing.

Self-organizing system faq

Dynamics of Complex Systems

http://necsi.org/publications/dcs/index.html

http://www.calresco.org/concept.htm

It's inversing the classical scientific method in a rigorous way.
Which is why it's so hard for classical thinkers to accept complexity
science as being a true science. As precision gives way to
pattern recognition. Objectivity is replaced with subjective descriptions.
And it's assumed nothing directly maps or ever precisely repeats.

To embrace the new way of understanding nature
one has to ...temporarily...abandon all they have
been taught from day one. One has to forget all
the truths they currently 'know' exist.

You have to be able to start over from scratch, with
NO BELIEFS. Then learn a new way from the ground up.

Something rather wonderful happens when you do that.

As one expands to the whole, the disciplines begin
to merge into one. The laws governing this supra-science
become ever simpler and fewer. In the end you're destined
to converge on a single idea, a single concept and method
for all questions.

All of them.

But you don't have to give up your classical ideas for long.

As complexity science 101 begins just on the other side
of all the classical brick walls.  And, in time, the two
meet up again. And once they do, you'll never see
the world the same way again.

You'll suddenly realize just how completely backwards
science has it right now. The fundamental laws of the
physical universe should be derived from life.

NOT the other way around.

Darwinian evolution, the same concepts we all know and
love, have been placed in abstract mathematical form
by the chaos and complexity sciences. And it is DARWIN
....the system properties displayed by the most ...complex...
the universe has to offer, which defines our universe.

ALL THIS TIME everyone seems to assume the....simplest...
the universe has to offer is the source of fundmemtal law.

That is completely wrong, exacty backwards in fact.
A very simple frame of reference mistake made
centuries ago out of necessity has us still mired
in Dark Age beliefs. We've been assuming we have
to understand oh...quarks to grasp a quasar.

It's the other way around, we have understand the whole
first, then the parts later. Only in this way can we
begin to truly contemplate creating a Grand Unified Theory
that not only merges quantum and classical behavior.
But also includes....life. All three in one idea is now
possible with complexity science. They've already done
it in fact, it's just no one believes it because they don't
understand how they got there.

It's true, try out the ideas of complexity science if you dare.
It's done wonders for me, I'm two inches taller and even
have whiter teeth~

Nothing? Is your reading as mindless as your response?

RIght. But when you run with these concepts it becomes even
more profound a discovery. You first have to understand what
is meant by complexity in this new science. Normally we imagine
a linear scale from zero to infinity to judge how complex or really
how ...complicated some system is.   On one end of this
complexity scale we have Newton, with few variables and
fairly simple deterministic rules. On the opposite end we
have quantum theory, where there are too many variables
and chaotic motion so we use statistical forms
of methods.

Old linear complexity scale

min...............................................&gt;......maximum
simple...........................................&gt;.....complicated
newtonian mechanics......................&gt;....quantum mechanics

But complex now means a system that has too many variables
for a classical solution, but too few for a statistical treatment.
Complex is where neither established mathematics works, it
is  ..between... the two.

So, the new definition of complexity no longer has one minimum
and one maximum.

Non linear complexity scale

min................................&gt;...max....&lt;....................min
simple...........................&gt;...complex...&lt;...............simple
newtonian mechanics......&gt;...thermodynamics...&lt;........quantum mech

In the new definition of complexity, complex now has ...two minimums
and one maximum. And the max resides where neither simple opposite
type of mathematics, newtonian and quantum, can provide a solution.

The above paradigm is more commonly described in attractor
theory as

static........dynamic.......chaotic

But here is the big discovery. A system becomes complex in the new meaning
when it resides at the point where it is the most difficult to precisely
quantify.
Where uncertainty is greatest, is where complexity is greatest.

And where complexity is greatest, spontaneous cyclic order emerges.

As if like magic,  the one place where classical reductionist methods
are at their most futile, is the one place where self organization or
.....evolution...get's it's intitial impetus and driving forces.

Guys, the source of all order is ultimately randomness. The second
law provides this steady source of increasing disorder or randomness.
And this is the food for the Fourth Law of Thermodynamics....
....self organization.....DARWIN.

This is true for the physical universe as it is for the living.

From the fog of maximum system uncertainty comes evolution.
From chaos comes order. The answers to the timeless or
ultimate questions cannot be precisely or objectively known.
Only through subjective methods. All of us have to learn
how to subjectively see the same thing, this is possible
now.

on these ideas....click below. Read about the cyclic universe
from one of the most respected cosmology team to be found.

Perhaps you could provide an example of what you find

&gt; why do you think that is?  My opinion is because science works with
&gt; assumptions that depend on previous knowledge.  So its easy to build
&gt; from the start and get something more complex.  As mathematicians know
&gt; though, complexity leads to total chaos.  Say for example you were
&gt; working with electronics and found that resisters limited current.&gt;From that knowledge you learned you could actually store a charge with

&gt; a capacitor.  Then from there someone discovered that electricity
&gt; could actually be amplified with a transformer, to create higher
&gt; voltages.

&gt;  Amazing, but then we get so complicated that we forget the source of
&gt; the invention is actually a battery, and we have limited supplies of
&gt; batteries.  Then after that we come to find out batteries don't even
&gt; work correctly without wires, and we find out there is limited
&gt; supplies of superconducting gold.  Finally we realize that we can't
&gt; transmit the power without an electric grid, stretching across the
&gt; whole country.  Then in all the confusion we start to have blackouts
&gt; everywhere, when we should have enough energy to supply everyone.

&gt; Then later, in just the recent years we find out electricity only
&gt; really works with good electrical grounding, and no one yet
&gt; understands why.  So if you don't want your equipment damaged you need
&gt; surge protectors, because the electrical grid was built without an
&gt; understanding of grounding, or ways to prevent surges, and blackouts
&gt; during storms.  But maybe one day all of this will be rethought and we
&gt; will realize the origonal electrical component invented, the resister,
&gt; is actually a way of grounding cables, and that resisters eventually
&gt; go bad after a period of time &amp; that's whats causing all of our
&gt; electrical problems.  But no one can prove that's happening, and no
&gt; one wants to deal with the problem.

&gt; That's just an example.  When it comes to studying medicine, the
&gt; environment, psychology, early human development, nutrition, genetics,
&gt; and life in general, we know almost absolutely nothing.  Everything is
&gt; built upon statistics, and studies in laboratories on people that
&gt; aren't given any .  Some studies have found that women and mens
&gt; development happens almost entirely in the womb, and is the product of
&gt; the chemicals and nutrition in the mothers body, which often lead to
&gt; birth defects.  Other studies have found that children being raised in
&gt; one environment will develop completely differently than twins raised
&gt; in another area.  The same happens with the sexes, women and men
&gt; develop completely different depending on the environmental factors,
&gt; what's good for a woman may be bad for a man.  Other studies are
&gt; finding that human genes are the mechanism of development, and that
&gt; they are carried on through families forever, unless there is some
&gt; problem causing a mutation.  Scientists working in one field don't
&gt; know all the information in another field, and the popular science
&gt; often disagrees with other science.  It happens all the time.

&gt; We literally know nothing, and live in a sea of technology no one

I had a little look at that website - there's lots of interesting stuff
there, and it will be worth exploring when I get the time.  But the
cyclic universe theory is nothing more dramatic than an alternative
scientific theory about the long-term history of the universe.  It's not
any sort of &quot;new science&quot; or other such mumbo-jumbo - it's a good, solid
scientific theory formed by looking for explanations for observed facts

anything else than that.

The universe is a complex place, as are many of its sub-systems.  You
can't look at all the small parts and expect to understand the whole as
a result - the organisation is as important as the parts.  But that's
all covered by &quot;old-fashioned&quot; science.  You certainly can't expect to
get anywhere by staring blindly at a complete system from afar, and
hoping for a flash of inspiration!

Great question. In a complexity perspective, the laws
would be derived from system properties, not part details.
In particular those system properties which are emergent.
For instance, a market system has certain emergent
system properties we all recognize. Adaptability, resilience
self tuning feedback mechanisms and so on.

The minute you stop such a system to detail it's components
those emergent system properties /vanish/ into thin air.
They can only be studied while the system is operating
and cannot be discerned from a detailed look at the
system parts.

And it is those 'ethereal' system properties which provide
the overall direction of the universe towards more order
over time. They are the most important properties of all
and they are completely invisible to classical objective
methods. I'm not saying emergence is a new idea, only
that complexity science has managed to create a universal
method of dealing with all emergent properties of any
real world complex dynamic system.

So now we have a single scientific language and set
of rules to apply to any real world system.

Concept
http://www.calresco.org/concept.htm

Every discipline has their own way of dealing with such
emergent system properties. Whether in sociology
or psychology or the business world, weather
forecasting, politics and on and on. Each has their own
unique languages and laws to describe various system
behavior.

Not anymore!

And the astonishing thing that happens once you can
examine such disparate systems with a single science
is that you suddenly realize they all...ALL are essentially
special cases of a ..single ..universal ..system ..behavior.

Everywhere you look, in pretty much any discipline at all
from cosmology to stock trading to religion all find their
...ideal form..or solution from a common system structure.

The complex adaptive system

What are Complex Adaptive Systems?

The most important behaviors or laws in the universe
cannot be revealed by the part details, only by an
intact and operating whole. By reducing to parts
first in order to understand the system, you end
up with countless specialties and an infinite
amount of unique data.

By expanding to system behavior, the output, you converge
on a single pattern of behavior for all real world dynamic
systems. Which pretty much covers everything in the
real live world.

Complexity science, once you understand the core concepts
and have practiced applying it to different fields, can be
applied to just about any discipline at all.

Learn just one science and you learn...them all.

And this science is spreading fast and into everything.
The US govt is one of the first and largest entities
to embrace and apply these concepts.

As to why so few people seem to chat about complexity
science. Well...if you learned something that really worked
well....wouldn't you keep it to yourself and go quietly
about putting it to good personal use?

Don't believe me? Here's a dated list of US govt agencies
using complexity science. The point here is not so much
how many agencies are using it, but how they reach from
one end of the spectrum to the other.

Ok, in the known universe. But life is certaintly complex enough

What emerges from life is the next higher level of complexity.

The point is that their theory is a dynamic solution using attractor
theory as with complexity science. And their theory has many of
the properties of a complex adaptive system. In an evolving
system, for instance, the initial conditions can vary widely
and the whole will still settle into or is attracted to a probable
final state. Solving the cosmic coincidence problem.

The cycle begins with a totally random or boolean network.
A cold flat universe. Which has the property of generating
spontaneous cyclic behavior. Or galaxy forming pertubations.
When the system behavior reaches criticality, or matter domination
its phase transition point, new properties emerge, such as dark
energy, that cannot be discerned from the detailed look at the
components. The new emergent property or energy feed back
and help tune the system towards stable behavior or a recent
second period of acceleration. As with a new market.

But the new force isn't stable, as such highly dynamic systems
are dissipative, requiring constant energy input to continue.
So the whole dissipates into eons of near nothingless.

A totally random boolean network, the exact conditions
needs for self organization or spontaneous order to emerge.

And the cycle starts over, but it starts not at the bang, but
at the death. If that really matters~

As Steinhardt said...

&quot;Hubble's discovery that the universe is expanding taught us
that the universe is evolving, but the notion had been
that the evolution has been steady over the last 15 billion years
with no remarkable changes. We now know that time is
anti-Copernican. We live at a special moment in cosmic history,
the transition between a decelerating, matter-dominated universe
and an accelerating, dark energy dominated universe. The
progressive formation of ever-larger scale structure and
increasing complexity that characterized the matter-dominated
universe has reached an end, and now the universe is headed
towards a period that is ever-emptier and structureless.&quot;

&quot;Quintessence is a dynamical, evolving, spatially inhomogeneous
component with negative pressure (Caldwell et al. 1998). The term
derives from the medieval word for fifth element&quot;; according to some
metaphysicians at the time, the universe consisted of earth, air, fire
water, plus an additional all-pervasive, component that accounted
for the motion of the Moon and planets.) In the current context,
quintessence would be the fifth dynamical component that has in
fluenced the evolution of the universe, in addition to the previously
known baryons, leptons, photons, and dark matter.

But once one understands how so many unique parts and one-off
interactions ...ends up...generating the very same pattern of
behavior across one discipline after another...then the light
switch is turned on like never before.

Don't you see what that relationship is? The more difficult it is to
precisely quantify the components of a system, the more
predictable and stable the system behavior becomes.

Chaos at the component level leads to evolutionary behavior
or increasing order at the system level.

Try to imagine the kind of system that would provide the
biggest difficulties possible to precisely detail the components.
The weather for instance. Or emotions.
It is just that kind of component behavior that generates
the spontaneous cyclic order. The direction of the universe
towards cyclic order.

The big answer is found at the one and only place
objective methods can't see.

Our habit, objective methods, are all about finding certainty
of some kind or another.

But where system ....uncertainty or component chaos is highest
is where self organization or Darwin begins.

So the new way is to search for, and understand, ..uncertainty.
The methods of how to quantify the total system uncertainty
as a means of designing or recognizing the ideal system form.

I mean....the higher the order...the more chaotic are the components.
The universe has a direction and should our methods of
understanding.

Start with the whole in order to understand the parts.
Start with the self tuning properties of a market system
for instance, to see how they guide the behavior and
structure of the parts. You can start off trying to fathom
the universe by counting the number of grapes at the
local market if you like.

But that just seems silly~

Especially when you find out you can't really count
those grapes...exactly.. ala the uncertainty principle.

A principle that is also a HUGE CLUE.

&gt; Great question. In a complexity perspective, the laws

">

Why?  How are you distinguishing &quot;system properties&quot; from
&quot;part details.&quot;

For example, a 747 is a fairly complex system.  One nut
taken from that same 747's gear assembly is clearly a
simple part.  If I drop either the 747 or the nut, I will gain
the data necessary to describe how objects fall within a
gravitational field.  The complexity of the 747 makes no
difference at all here; it would be relevant only if I wanted
to learn something about how the internal workings of
that system behave, as opposed to its gross externally-
visible properties.  Moving up a few levels, I can also
observe/demonstrate the basic principles of aeronautics
through either watching that 747 in operation, watching
a Cessna 172 - although Cessna is undeniably a far simpler
system.

One would think, from considering most examples that
come to mind, that the best way to &quot;derive laws&quot; would
be through the observation of the SIMPLEST system which
provides sufficient data to do so.  Or, in other words, one
should not bring in unnecessary complexity into an
experiment without having a good reason for doing so.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In particular those system properties which are emergent.
">

Precisely; but you do not need the full system to demonstrate
or derive ALL of its properties, only those which might be
considered to be &quot;emergent&quot; at that level of complexity.
For anything less than this, you're better off studying simpler
systems, since they have less potential for generating
irrelevant problems which would complicate the study of
these more basic properties.  For example, if I want again
wished to study the BASIC principles of flight, I may be
better off with a much simpler aircraft than a 747, for the
simple reason that it will be easier to operate, more reliable,
and therefore will more readily get me the necessary data.
I would need to turn to the 747, or something similar, though,
if I specifically wanted to study, say, the behavior of autoland
systems in multiengine jet airliners. The complexity of the
system being studied must be sufficient to provide the
relevant data, but certainly should be no more complex than
that.  So we still have not justified a belief that we should
always seek the most complex system possible for study.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Certainly - and if you wanted to study those, you would

First of all - &quot;most important&quot; in what context?  On
what scale?  As judged by whom?

An example - the behavior of the force of gravity is
clearly a very important aspect of our universe, as
it controls the paths of moons, planets, stars, and even
entire galaxies; it literally shapes the universe.  Yet the
&quot;laws&quot; which describe this behavior are actually rather
simple, and may to a very high degree of accuracy
be derived from observations of much simpler structures
than the universe as a whole.  This, then, would seem to
be at least one example which contradicts the above
assertion.  It may not be the case that ALL &quot;important

On what do you base the assumption of a &quot;fractal&quot;
universe, and how is it relevant to the question at
hand?  If the universe truly were &quot;fractal,&quot; it would
actually be a very strong reason AGAINST the notion
that one would have to study the &quot;entire system&quot; in

a fractal structure means that any part, at any level,
effectively contains the whole.

&gt; &gt; Great question. In a complexity perspective, the laws
&gt; &gt; would be derived from system properties, not part details.

&gt; Why?  How are you distinguishing &quot;system properties&quot; from
&gt; &quot;part details.&quot;

&gt; For example, a 747 is a fairly complex system.
">

Not really. In comparison to real world complex dynamic
systems it's comparatively simple. The definition of the
word complex, as defined by complexity science, still
escapes you. A 747 is a very complicated system
on a linear scale from few to many.

Complex, the new meaning, is neither few or many.
It has too many variables for a Newtonian or classical
solution, but too few variables for a statistical or quantum
like solution. Complex behavior requires ...both...realms
of mathematics at the same time to fully describe the
behavior. That is why a behavior is called complex, since
both opposing realms of math is required. Simple now
becomes defined as that which can be solved with
just ...one or the other... realms of math.

Perhaps the simplest example of a complex system
would be a cloud. Where molecules are randomly
changing from liquid to vapor and back again.
A continuous sequence of step changes.
Even a tiny change in temp or pressure can have
cause the system to dramatically change forms.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  One nut
&gt; taken from that same 747's gear assembly is clearly a
&gt; simple part.  If I drop either the 747 or the nut, I will gain
&gt; the data necessary to describe how objects fall within a
&gt; gravitational field.  The complexity of the 747 makes no
&gt; difference at all here; it would be relevant only if I wanted
&gt; to learn something about how the internal workings of
&gt; that system behave, as opposed to its gross externally-
&gt; visible properties.  Moving up a few levels, I can also
&gt; observe/demonstrate the basic principles of aeronautics
&gt; through either watching that 747 in operation, watching
&gt; a Cessna 172 - although Cessna is undeniably a far simpler
&gt; system.
">

Just the opposite is true with real world systems. Again
this science is about how nature creates. Are the properties
of a forest or a society best displayed by the Congo or
your back yard?  Is public opinion better judged by
large or small samples?

The basic difference between a man-made system and
natural systems which this science is about can be
seen this way. A man made system is one where the
goal or final product is envisioned ahead of time, and
the parts are constructed to fit the goal. Reverse
engineering nature.

A natural system allows the final product to emerge as
it will from the interaction of numerous autonomous agents.
A 747 and a society are opposites of each other.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; One would think, from considering most examples that
&gt; come to mind, that the best way to &quot;derive laws&quot; would
&gt; be through the observation of the SIMPLEST system which
&gt; provides sufficient data to do so.

For man made systems sure, for natural systems not at all.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;  Or, in other words, one
&gt; should not bring in unnecessary complexity into an

In natural systems, the ...complications..are added by
reducing in scale causing a proportional increase in
variables and interactions. You have to properly envision
what complexity now means. Imagine two variables
that are being pulled in opposite directions at all times.
And just so that neither direction wins, but a persistant tie.
The variable behavior becomes complex as it's  future
behavior depends on the most delicate of future
changes. In short, the future of the variable cannot
be determined, in fact complexity is where there's
the least ability to determine the exact state of
an object or behavior.

&gt; Precisely; but you do not need the full system to demonstrate
&gt; or derive ALL of its properties, only those which might be
&gt; considered to be &quot;emergent&quot; at that level of complexity.
&gt; For anything less than this, you're better off studying simpler
&gt; systems, since they have less potential for generating
&gt; irrelevant problems which would complicate the study of
&gt; these more basic properties.  For example, if I want again
&gt; wished to study the BASIC principles of flight, I may be
&gt; better off with a much simpler aircraft than a 747, for the
&gt; simple reason that it will be easier to operate, more reliable,
&gt; and therefore will more readily get me the necessary data.
&gt; I would need to turn to the 747, or something similar, though,
&gt; if I specifically wanted to study, say, the behavior of autoland
&gt; systems in multiengine jet airliners. The complexity of the
&gt; system being studied must be sufficient to provide the
&gt; relevant data, but certainly should be no more complex than
&gt; that.  So we still have not justified a belief that we should
&gt; always seek the most complex system possible for study.

&gt; &gt; For instance, a market system has certain emergent
&gt; &gt; system properties we all recognize. Adaptability, resilience
&gt; &gt; self tuning feedback mechanisms and so on.

&gt; Certainly - and if you wanted to study those, you would
&gt; certainly need to look at a sufficiently complex market.
&gt; If, on the other hand, you merely wanted to study the very
&gt; basics of economic transactions, watching a child's lemonade
&gt; stand doing business may suffice.

markets find a way of increasing efficiency, stability and
creativity. And with Adam Smith like invisible hands
these forces ...emerge...from the interaction of autonomous

Lets compare two entirely different fields/things using
a system approach.  Using the output of the whole

Gravity and biological fitness.

One is a pervasive force for order in the physical
universe, and the other for the living world.

A gravity well vs a fitness landscape.
When systems become complex as described
above, standing persistantly poised at its
phase transition point, fitness peaks then
tend to clump together, and higher fitness
peaks have a larger basin of attraction.

A living system interacting randomly with its environment
is more likely to 'fall' into a region of higher fitness
than lower. Just like objects tend to fall together.

On the....input...side the two are as different as can
be...material vs living. On the output side they follow
essentially the ...same laws of organization.

Using the part details of each system as the first source
of knowledge leads to two entirely different sciences
each so unique such commonalites cannot be seen.

for the system, as you said with gravity. So it is
with biology. Just two vastly different scales of

However, the overall behavior of the cloud can

The properties of a forest are clearly best demonstrated

bearing on whether or not conventional science is valid.
Scientists DO study forests.  As to the &quot;large or small

&quot;statistically significant&quot;?  Obviously, larger samples are
better than small samples - but just as obviously, there comes
a point where increasing the sample size does not result
in a sufficient gain in the quality of the data to be worth the
effort.  If I have a box of 1,000,000 marbles, and I am

It would depend on just what it is about &quot;natural systems&quot;

which is exhibited by &quot;natural systems,&quot; and something which
can be very, very accurately described from the observations
of very simple examples.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

You keep using this term &quot;natural systems&quot; as if there all
&quot;natural systems&quot; were by necessity impossibly complex, when
this clearly is not true, and as though nothing about natural
systems had ever been explained by conventional science -
which also is clearly not true.  What science studies IS
&quot;natural,&quot; and ONLY &quot;natural&quot; - there is no alternative.  You
are correct in noting that man-made systems are designed,
and that this is a key feature of such systems - but they are
designed only through the application of the principles that
we have learned through observation of the natural world.
That these man-made designs function as expected, within this
natural, physical world, is prima facie evidence that our observations
are of value.

If you do not see ALL possible behaviors at a given level

What is MOST responsible for the visible order in the

I'm sorry, but I saw absolutely no real content in anything
you said in this section that would lead one to believe
that there was some principle at work which could ONLY
be detected at the universal scale.  If this isn't what you're
trying to argue for here, then exactly what your point was
supposed to be also eludes me.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; OK, so if this is true - what IS the single unified
&gt;&gt; description of the universe offered by this science?
&gt;&gt; If it is too complicated to outline here, then I would
&gt;&gt; submit that this strongly suggests that it is NOT a
&gt;&gt; fundamental behavior or &quot;law,&quot; but instead is itself
&gt;&gt; derivable from simpler principles.

&gt; All order in the universe, physical or living, is the result
&gt; of a system that's persistantly poised at the phase
&gt; transition of its own opposite extremes in possibiliy.

Nicely-expressed notion.  Why would one believe it?
What value does the above model provide which is not
offered by more conventional views?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; What do you mean by the symbol &quot;god?&quot;

&gt; That which is as far above us, as we are above animals.
">

&quot;Above&quot; in what sense?  How far ARE we &quot;above
animals&quot;?  What is the distinguishing difference, IN KIND,
between humans and animals, since the above statement
clearly implies that you believe there is one?  Unless these
questions can be clearly answered, your statement has no
real meaning whatsoever.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Again, it goes to the meaning of the word complexity.
&gt; The duality of light for instance. Light act as both a particle
&gt; and a wave, so it is a complex system. To objectively
&gt; measure it, it is reduced to ...either.. a particle or a wave.
&gt; It becomes simple when objectively observed.
">

Light may be modelled as either a particle or a wave,
yes; I do not see how this causes it to qualify as a &quot;complex
system.&quot;  And in many measures of light, the wave vs.
particle nature is completely irrelevant.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Not the parts. Whenever you reduce or simplify to allow
&gt; objective measurements, the most important properties
&gt; the emergent properties, cannot be seen.
">

So you continue to assert; unfortunately, you have yet
to show any example where this makes any real
difference - where your supposed &quot;complexity science&quot;
explains something that conventional science cannot, or
at least provides a more accurate model.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I'm stating there is no objective reality.
">

Then, as noted, further discussion is useless.  In the absence
of a shared objective reality, ANY description of whatever
&quot;reality&quot; there might be is utterly dependent on the individual
observer, and therefore useless for ANY purpose to any other.

So what other alternatives do you propose we take on instead. Religion? lol
Seriously yes I know humans dont know anything, we probally only know about

Like measuring &quot;up to half of what makes existence real&quot;?  &quot;Half&quot; is, of
course, a measurement.  So it seems that you would prefer to pull your
claims out of your ass and present them as if they were &quot;measureable stuff&quot;
even though it's really just some shit you made up on the spur of the
moment.

You can &quot;bottle up&quot; the 1812 Overture by recording it.  Then you can let it
out of bottle whenever you like and it will be beautiful music every time.
You can &quot;measure the feeling&quot; by observing the reaction of your brain cells
with precision measuring devices as you listen and correlate them to your
reported experience of listening.

So you're wrong again.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It's true, try out the ideas of complexity science if you dare.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Is &quot;complexity science&quot; yet another method to expel a great deal of
&gt;&gt;&gt; verbiage....and say absolutely nothing?

&gt;&gt; Nothing? Is your reading as mindless as your response?
&gt;&gt; I asserted that the fundamental laws of the universe should
&gt;&gt; be derived from the most complex the universe has to offer.
&gt;&gt; Which are living systems. Instead of the ...simplest...the
&gt;&gt; unverse has to offer as is our habit.

&gt;&gt; And I also explained why we should inverse our current
&gt;&gt; scientific method. I introduced how to do that also.
&gt;&gt; While providing links to established scientific sources
&gt;&gt; to provide credibility and more detailed reading.

You are complaining that scientists don't bother to measure things
that are unmeasurable, and don't try to explain things that are not
causal. That's just awful.

Does listening to music make existance real? Do you think that
scientists don't listen to music?
