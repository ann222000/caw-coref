Dear CACC,

According to this VNExpress article, Intel Product Viet Nam has signed with
the management of the Advanced Industrial Zone of HCMC a memorandum on
business ethics, rules of conduct and &quot;saying 'no' to corruption.&quot;  This is
the first momorandum of this type in Vietnam.  The US General Consul in HCMC
also signed this momorandum.

And I am very a happy that this is a US-based company.  The US is the ONLY
country in the world that has the anti-corruption practices act that
prohibits its citizens to engage in corruption practices overseas.  When I
was in Vietnam, I was solicited into many multi-million-dollar deals with
under-the-table payments required.  I refused all of them (which made some
of my solicitors very upset and kept me poor).  But I told them,
&quot;I am an American lawyer.  My job is to teach my clients to keep the law.
And the US law is very clear: 'No payment under the table, no kickback, no
bribe.'  Sorry, no deal.&quot;

I hope that US companies will happily follow Intel to lift up the American
ethics torch overseas.  And I am very happy to see that the US government is
involved in this ethical effort.

Have a great day!

Hoanh

Intel Việt Nam từ chối hối lộ

Chiều 14/8, Intel Product Việt Nam đã ký với Ban Quản lý Khu công nghệ cao
TP HCM (SHTP) bản ghi nhớ về đạo đức kinh doanh và quy tắc ứng xử, cùng nói
không với tham nhũng. Đây là lần đầu tiên tại Việt Nam, một công ty và cơ
quan nhà nước ký với nhau một văn bản như vậy.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Intel VN nhận giấy phép tăng vốn lên 1 tỷ USD&lt; http://vnexpress.net/Vietnam/Kinh-doanh/2006/11/3B9F042F/ &gt;
">

Tổng giám đốc Intel Việt Nam Rick Howarth, Giám đốc SHTP Nguyễn Đình Mai và
tân Tổng lãnh sự Mỹ tại TP HCM Ken Fairfax, cùng ký trên bản quy tắc gốc của
công ty Intel, để ghi nhớ trách nhiệm xã hội của mình.

Bản quy tắc nội bộ Intel cam kết 5 điểm. Đó là hoạt động kinh doanh với tinh
thần trung thực và chính trực; tuân thủ pháp luật trong mọi tình huống; môi
trường làm việc công bằng và không phân biệt; nhân viên Intel làm việc vì
lợi ích công ty và tránh xung đột; cùng nhau bảo vệ tài sản và danh tiếng
doanh nghiệp.

ty. Ảnh: *P.A.*

Theo đó, Intel và SHTP thỏa thuận, sẽ điều tra và có những hành động thích
hợp để giải quyết những vấn đề liên quan đến quy tắc ứng xử này. Trường hợp
phát sinh những vấn đề liên quan đối tác như đưa và nhận hối lộ, tiền lại
quả, hay bất cứ hình thức nào về việc tham nhũng hay các hành vi sai trái
khác... cũng được Intel và SHTP thông báo cho nhau hoặc báo cho cơ quan chức
năng.

Intel cũng cam kết mở thường xuyên các lớp huấn luyện nhân viên về đạo đức
và pháp luật, gửi bản sao ghi nhớ đến những nhà cung cấp cũng như kiểm tra
việc thực hiện.

Nói không với tham nhũng không dễ

Ông Rick Howarth kể, đã có lần nhân viên Intel được đối tác gợi ý hối lộ để
đạt được một thỏa thuận hợp đồng. Sự việc bị phát hiện, điều tra và nhân
viên vi phạm bị sa thải. &quot;Mục đích chính của bản thỏa thuận ghi nhớ với SHTP
là chúng tôi muốn nâng cao tính minh bạch của môi trường đầu tư tại Khu công
nghệ cao TP HCM&quot;, ông Tổng giám đốc Intel Việt Nam nói.

Giám đốc SHTP Nguyễn Đình Mai cũng khẳng định, sự tự nguyện của Intel đã
khởi xướng việc thúc đẩy một môi trường đầu tư sạch, xóa bỏ những hành vi
tiêu cực như tham nhũng, hối lộ, lạm dụng quyền lực để mưu lợi cá nhân...
Nhân viên Intel cũng nối tiếp theo sếp. Ảnh: *P.A.*

Theo ông Mai, thỏa thuận chống tham nhũng với Intel mang lại giá trị hợp tác
nhiều mặt cho cả 2 bên. Phía Intel cắt giảm được những chi phí không cần
thiết trong quá trình hoạt động, xây dựng thành công mô hình chi phí cạnh
tranh và tăng hiệu quả kinh doanh tại Việt Nam. Còn SHTP cũng được cái lợi
là tạo môi trường thuận lợi cho các nhà đầu tư trong khu công nghệ cao và
tăng tính cạnh tranh về lâu dài.

Theo bạn, việc Intel từ chối hối lộ là:

Đáng hoan nghênh

Chỉ là hình thức, chẳng có tác dụng gì

Công ty khác nên làm như Intel

Trong khi đó, Tổng lãnh sự Mỹ tại TP HCM Ken Fairfax thì nhấn mạnh thông
điệp, ngay cả những công ty cạnh tranh nhất trong ngành công nghiệp cạnh
tranh nhất (công nghệ cao) của thế giới cũng có nhu cầu phải hoạt động công
bằng, lành mạnh; mà ông gọi là văn hóa doanh nghiệp. Trong khi đó phòng
chống tham nhũng đang là mục tiêu quan trọng của chương trình hành động
Chính phủ Việt Nam và cả Mỹ để xây dựng môi trường kinh doanh minh bạch và
hiệu quả.

Ông Hen Fairfax kỳ vọng rằng, bản cam kết của Intel đi tiên phong sẽ trở
thành khuôn mẫu để nhân rộng tại Việt Nam, tạo nên một nền kinh tế và xã hội
năng động, cởi mở, bình đẳng.

Intel đang đầu tư 1 tỷ USD vào Khu công nghệ cao TP HCM để xây dựng nhà máy
lắp ráp và kiểm nghiệm chíp bán dẫn lớn nhất thế giới. Nhà máy đang trong
giai đoạn xây dựng, khi chính thức hoạt động sẽ tạo ra khoảng 4.000 việc làm
và mang về kim ngạch xuất khẩu 5-6 tỷ USD/năm.

Dear Anh Hoanh,

Could you please expand a bit on your statement, &quot;The US is the ONLY country
in the world that has the anti-corruption practices act&quot;, to explain whether
or not this means the US is (a) the only country with anti-corruption laws,
(b) the only country with effective anti-corruption laws, (c) the only
country with one set of laws specifically called the &quot;Anti-Corruption
Practices Act&quot; or (d) some other meaning?  The wording and grammatical
mechanics of that statement seem to invite misinterpretation in the USA's
favour.

I initially wondered about this because i remembered that while living in
Hong Kong over 1990-1994 that territory had already instituted a very
rigorous set of anti-corruption laws complemented by an enforcement
infrastructure that was world-renowned for its effectiveness.  And,
according to Google searches on the American Bar Association, US
anti-corruption laws seem to date from 2000.AD, though i didn't have time to
confirm that conclusively.

Next, i was reminded of the curious naming of the Operation Iraqi Freedom
which avoided the then most prevalent keyword of the Bush Admin's pro-war
propaganda, &quot;liberation&quot;.  It would be just too revealing to call the US
invasion of the sovereign state of Iraq, &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation&quot;
(OIL).  No?

Just joking.  But around the rest of world not dominated by the Fox network
and other pro-US-Bush-Admin media i think it's been pretty obvious from the
beginning of the US invasion of Iraq that that war has always been primarily
about controlling oil supplies and resultant wealth (and pollution).

Often less obvious have been self-serving links between the Bush Admin', Big
Oil and the Bush family's ties to the Saudi regime, Dick Cheney's
Halliburton, which was virtually granted a monopoly on repairing the damage
the Bush Admin' has been causing in Iraq, along with arms dealers like
Carlyle (with its long, well-documented Bush-family ties to the Saudi bin
Laden family).  (Cf
http://www.google.com/search?q=bush+family+arms-dealers+oil-companies , in
particular &quot;'Frauds-R-Us' - The Bush Family Saga&quot;,
http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3308.htm , which has entries
about both Halliburton and Carlyle.  Otherwise, if you're not a rabid
neocon&lt; http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neocon &gt;,
just watch or read Micheal Moore's &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.)

Now, if that's not yet another example of the USA's long history of highly
sophisticated INSTITUTIONALIZED corruption, i don't know what is.

Like the leadership debate, there seems to be yet another glaring gap
between principles and practice when we discuss anti-corruption efforts.

But how do we measure and rank institutionalized corruption?  Because most
accepted international corruption indices (now also &quot;indexes&quot;) are based on
legal definitions of corruption most will have difficulty measuring
corruption based on legal loopholes or institutionally accepted practices
that allow corruption to leak in legally.

Still, just to get an idea of how the US ranks on corruption,
internationally -- without counting the institutionalized corruption
inherent in political campaign contributions, media patronage, etc -- see
for example the &quot;2006 Corruption Perception Index&quot; of Transparency
International wherein the US ranks 22nd, after Chile. [
http://www.transparency.org/content/download/10825/92857/version/1/fi... ]

Also, i did stretch my free time a bit to use the US-dominated World Bank's
Governance data to construct a chart of 20 arbitrarily selected nations'
&quot;Corruption Control&quot; rankings, including the USA and Vietnam.  I'd suggest
it's significantly revealing of the USA's position.  I posted it here:
http://govap-sighgone.blogspot.com/2007/08/twenty-nations-ranked-by-c...

I'd also submit that the VNExpress report (BeLow) on Intel's anti-corruption
role primarily highlights most news media's foci (now also &quot;focuses&quot;) on
news involving what the TV ad-industry calls &quot;Jiggles &amp; Jolts&quot;, ie
representations of sex, money, violence, etc, to attract and hold viewers
attention.  Jiggles &amp; Jolts sell the news just like they sell TV game
shows.  Just as your own anti-corruption efforts went unreported, Anh Hoanh,
i'm sure hundreds of other laudable efforts before Intel's have just not
been judged &quot;news-worthy&quot;.

Last but not least, i'd suggest we should not forget the pervasive impact
bribes still have in the editorial choices of Vietnam Inc's PR Department,
ie, the nation's entire state-owned news media.

Just yet another couple of dong's worth -- for whatever that's worth (max
VND16,198/USD according to Vietcombank, at
http://www.thanhniennews.com/exrates/index.php , but VND16,200/USD at a Go
Vap jewelry shop, yesterday).

With regards,
AD

Dear brother Andi,

The US Foreign Corrup-tion Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits U.S.
companies, their subsidiaries, as well as their officers, directors,
employees, and agents from bribing &quot;foreign officials&quot; (and also requires
U.S. companies that issue debt or equity to maintain internal accounting
controls and to keep books and records that accurately reflect all
transactions).   It means that even if the payment is considered legal in a
foreign country under the law or normal practice of that country (such as
the customary &quot;boi duong&quot; or &quot;gifts&quot; in Vietnam), it is still illegal under
the US law if it violates the FCPA  and the American violator will be
prosecuted in the US court, even if the payment is done in a foreign
country.

As far as I know, only the US reaches its citizens that far.  Other
countries will let its citizens do whatever is considered legal practice in
a foreign country.

I don't understand why we have to talk about Iraq.  I oppose that war
because it is stupid.  But it is not about oil, or at leadt not about oil
only.  (/11 attack on the US is real, and if Bush over-reacted in Iraq, that
would be easy to understand.  :Let's stay with what we can prove by facts.

I am not saying that American companies are not corrupt,  Some of them do,
and I did talk about the Banana Republic often in this forum.  However, many
US companies will not engage in corruption practices overseas because US
companies have many ethical lawyers like me.

Have a great day!

&gt; Dear Anh Hoanh,

&gt; Could you please expand a bit on your statement, &quot;The US is the ONLY
&gt; country in the world that has the anti-corruption practices act&quot;, to explain
&gt; whether or not this means the US is (a) the only country with
&gt; anti-corruption laws, (b) the only country with effective anti-corruption
&gt; laws, (c) the only country with one set of laws specifically called the
&gt; &quot;Anti-Corruption Practices Act&quot; or (d) some other meaning?  The wording and
&gt; grammatical mechanics of that statement seem to invite misinterpretation in
&gt; the USA's favour.

&gt; I initially wondered about this because i remembered that while living in
&gt; Hong Kong over 1990-1994 that territory had already instituted a very
&gt; rigorous set of anti-corruption laws complemented by an enforcement
&gt; infrastructure that was world-renowned for its effectiveness.  And,
&gt; according to Google searches on the American Bar Association, US
&gt; anti-corruption laws seem to date from 2000.AD &lt; http://2000.ad/ &gt;, though i
&gt; didn't have time to confirm that conclusively.

&gt; Next, i was reminded of the curious naming of the Operation Iraqi Freedom
&gt; which avoided the then most prevalent keyword of the Bush Admin's pro-war
&gt; propaganda, &quot;liberation&quot;.  It would be just too revealing to call the US
&gt; invasion of the sovereign state of Iraq, &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation&quot;
&gt; (OIL).  No?

&gt; Just joking.  But around the rest of world not dominated by the Fox
&gt; network and other pro-US-Bush-Admin media i think it's been pretty obvious
&gt; from the beginning of the US invasion of Iraq that that war has always been
&gt; primarily about controlling oil supplies and resultant wealth (and
&gt; pollution).

&gt; Often less obvious have been self-serving links between the Bush Admin',
&gt; Big Oil and the Bush family's ties to the Saudi regime, Dick Cheney's
&gt; Halliburton, which was virtually granted a monopoly on repairing the damage
&gt; the Bush Admin' has been causing in Iraq, along with arms dealers like
&gt; Carlyle (with its long, well-documented Bush-family ties to the Saudi bin
&gt; Laden family).  (Cf
&gt; http://www.google.com/search?q=bush+family+arms-dealers+oil-companies , in
&gt; particular &quot;'Frauds-R-Us' - The Bush Family Saga&quot;,
&gt; http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3308.htm , which has
&gt; entries about both Halliburton and Carlyle.  Otherwise, if you're not a
&gt; rabid neocon &lt; http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neocon &gt;, just
&gt; watch or read Micheal Moore's &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.)

&gt; Now, if that's not yet another example of the USA's long history of highly
&gt; sophisticated INSTITUTIONALIZED corruption, i don't know what is.

&gt; Like the leadership debate, there seems to be yet another glaring gap
&gt; between principles and practice when we discuss anti-corruption efforts.

&gt; But how do we measure and rank institutionalized corruption?  Because most
&gt; accepted international corruption indices (now also &quot;indexes&quot;) are based on
&gt; legal definitions of corruption most will have difficulty measuring
&gt; corruption based on legal loopholes or institutionally accepted practices
&gt; that allow corruption to leak in legally.

&gt; Still, just to get an idea of how the US ranks on corruption,
&gt; internationally -- without counting the institutionalized corruption
&gt; inherent in political campaign contributions, media patronage, etc -- see
&gt; for example the &quot;2006 Corruption Perception Index&quot; of Transparency
&gt; International wherein the US ranks 22nd, after Chile. [
&gt; http://www.transparency.org/content/download/10825/92857/version/1/fi... ]

&gt; Also, i did stretch my free time a bit to use the US-dominated World
&gt; Bank's Governance data to construct a chart of 20 arbitrarily selected
&gt; nations' &quot;Corruption Control&quot; rankings, including the USA and Vietnam.  I'd
&gt; suggest it's significantly revealing of the USA's position.  I posted it
&gt; here:
&gt; http://govap-sighgone.blogspot.com/2007/08/twenty-nations-ranked-by-c...

&gt; I'd also submit that the VNExpress report (BeLow) on Intel's
&gt; anti-corruption role primarily highlights most news media's foci (now also
&gt; &quot;focuses&quot;) on news involving what the TV ad-industry calls &quot;Jiggles &amp;
&gt; Jolts&quot;, ie representations of sex, money, violence, etc, to attract and hold
&gt; viewers attention.  Jiggles &amp; Jolts sell the news just like they sell TV
&gt; game shows.  Just as your own anti-corruption efforts went unreported, Anh
&gt; Hoanh, i'm sure hundreds of other laudable efforts before Intel's have just
&gt; not been judged &quot;news-worthy&quot;.

&gt; Last but not least, i'd suggest we should not forget the pervasive impact
&gt; bribes still have in the editorial choices of Vietnam Inc's PR Department,
&gt; ie, the nation's entire state-owned news media.

&gt; Just yet another couple of dong's worth -- for whatever that's worth (max
&gt; VND16,198/USD according to Vietcombank, at http://www.thanhniennews.com/exrates/index.php
&gt; , but VND16,200/USD at a Go Vap jewelry shop, yesterday).

Anh Hoanh and CACC,

1.      The OECD member countries adopted a Convention on Combating Bribery
of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions in 1997.

2.      Corruption in Vietnam, as elsewhere, is often systematic.  So I
guess that an institutional approach to corruption may help enlighten the
problem.  Having said this, I do not mean to underestimate the fact that
ethical individuals/citizens are jewels in every society.  But as Nam Cao
stated [almost hundred years ago] in the famous Chi Pheo &quot;tao muon lam nguoi
tu te, nhung ai cho tao lam nguoi tu te&quot; (I want to be a good person, but
who allows me to do that???).  Within my limited circle of
friends/acquaintances, I already know MANY public officials in Vietnam who
have relatively high ethical standards and want to be good citizens.  But
it's the fact that they are operating in a system that is known for high
level of corruption.  The system has not been mature enough to facilitate
them to do what they want -- life is a matter of choice, and I can well
understand one's choice of survival before ethical.  If the US has FCPA,
Vietnam has an Anti-corruption Law too.  And I just mentioned, Vietnam seems
not lack ethical officials/professionals either.  There must be something
else, apart from legislation, and individual citizens, that makes the system
the way it is.  An open-ended question, to which I have no answer.

Rgs,

Lien

Dear Sister Bich Lien &amp; CACC,

You pose a wonderful question, sister.  Lucky for the students who have you
as their teacher, Bich :Lien they will learn well!

&quot;There must be something else, a part from legislation and individual
citizens, that make the system the way it did.  An open-ended question, to
which I have no answer.&quot;  That is so true!  Bich Lien, I had that question
when I was 17, and it followed me for several decades, and during that
times, I searched for the answer in every thing under the sun; you name it,
I have searched in it.

I have such a strong urge to share with you my long journey, but to save
everyone's time, let me just share the final observation: The missing thing
that sis. Bich Lien is looking for is &quot;*the standard of conduct that the
majority of the people demand.*&quot;

If the *majority* of people demand the *standard *that their leaders have to
be honest, that bribery is bad, then the country will have honest leaders
and will have less corruption.  If the majority of people think that their
leaders just have to be &quot;effective&quot; (whatever effective means)but don't have
to be honest, and that corruption/bribery is an OK way to live and to do
business, then the country will be marred with lying/cheating leaders and
corruption will fill the scene.

Please note, I say &quot;*majority of people*.&quot; Sister Bich Lien said there are
MANY good officials.  But many is not enough if that many is still the
minority.

And I say &quot;*standard of conduct*,&quot; meaning, the character traits that people
look up to and whoever achieves such characters will be admired by most
people, the character traits that people want their leaders to possess .
Standard is usually a bit idealistic, because standard is for &quot;the
best scenario.&quot;  Say, the standard score for good student is the perfect
10/10.  But few students ever achieve this.  Most good students would get
9/10 or 8/10 only.  However, everything being equal, the school that has
the 10/10 standard will produce much better students than the school that
sets 8/10 as its standard.

Most people in Vietnam think that paying and receiving bribes is OK, it is
just a way to do things.  The majority of the people will not stand up and
say that it is bad and that it must be stopped.  (Since 18 years old in
college in Saigon, I have fought against most of my friends who would
convinced me that corruption and bribery is the way to live and that I am
just naive.  Imagine you hear this from 18 years old kids (who were my
friends)!  Sad but true.  And today many people still tell me that I am too
idealistic, that they don't need honest leaders, that they believe
corruption is an OK or acceptable way to do business, or corruption is just
a matter of semantic.

We will always disagree in many specific circumstances whether a sentence
spoken is honest or not, or a specific gift or payment is indeed a bribe.
Application of a rule to a specific case may raise disagreement among
friends.  That is OK.  But at least, the majority of the people have to
believe in the rule of honesty and the rule of clean business and clean
government.  If we don't have the majority, the minority of good people
won't be enough.

How to get that majority?  Simple, keep talking, keep preaching, keep
teaching, and keep practicing honesty and cleanliness.  It is hard, because
we all are human, and we all, including me, and especially me, fail often
for our weaknesses, and we need to eat and pay bills and feed our children
too.  I know.  But if we have faith in the ultimate victory of goodness,
will stand up after each fall, and continue talking about honesty and clean
governance again and again and again, time after time after time, regardless
of what the negative people may say, then eventually that majority will be
achieved.

Trust me.  Have faith!

Have a great day, sis. Bich Lien and all.

Hoanh

bribes&lt; http://sighgone-ho.blogspot.com/2007/08/more-vnbiz-intel-vietnam-refu... &gt;.
The following is revised.]

Thank you, sincerely, Anh Hoanh, for making that byte a whole lot less
ambiguous.

Of the significance of the purportedly unique international reach of the US
Foreign Corruption Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), with all due respect,
please let's remember that a tree grows and spreads out from its roots, that
the US roots, at home, do not stack up all that well these days against
those of its peers, or others, and please, please, please can we keep the
Yankee-doodle-dandying in either perspective or check?  ;)

The USA is still a great nation with even greater individuals and
communities -- who today are often hanging on the skins of their teeth.
But, today, the USA far from the world's accepted ethical leader in few
places other than the US Bible Belt and in the Media in or from the USofA.

For the convenience of all chis, anhs, et als here, here again are two
previously mentioned, apparently quite authoritative takes on that
perspective above of the USA's level of corruption versus its international
peers, graphically, for those who can receive as much:

As an aside, on your question of the relevance of Iraq and oil, it's just
another US invasion-cum-war directly resulting from the corruption of the
last two Bush Admin's.  I can only extend the [subconscious?] waffle in the
rationale of your response as such: &quot;... it is not about oil, or at leadt
not about oil only,...&quot;, or, maybe, at least not primarily about controlling
oil wealth [which is what i wrote], or maybe not all of it, eh?

[Said and sent with the goodwill of open debate between free and friendly
folks worldwide.  Please pardon a few friendly pokes, here and there.  ;) -

&gt; Dear brother Andi,

&gt; The US Foreign Corrup-tion Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits U.S.
&gt; companies, their subsidiaries, as well as their officers, directors,
&gt; employees, and agents from bribing &quot;foreign officials&quot; (and also requires
&gt; U.S. companies that issue debt or equity to maintain internal accounting
&gt; controls and to keep books and records that accurately reflect all
&gt; transactions).   It means that even if the payment is considered legal in a
&gt; foreign country under the law or normal practice of that country (such as
&gt; the customary &quot;boi duong&quot; or &quot;gifts&quot; in Vietnam), it is still illegal under
&gt; the US law if it violates the FCPA  and the American violator will be
&gt; prosecuted in the US court, even if the payment is done in a foreign
&gt; country.

&gt; As far as I know, only the US reaches its citizens that far.  Other
&gt; countries will let its citizens do whatever is considered legal practice in
&gt; a foreign country.

&gt; I don't understand why we have to talk about Iraq.  I oppose that war
&gt; because it is stupid.  But it is not about oil, or at leadt not about oil
&gt; only.  (/11 attack on the US is real, and if Bush over-reacted in Iraq, that
&gt; would be easy to understand.  :Let's stay with what we can prove by facts.

&gt; I am not saying that American companies are not corrupt,  Some of them do,
&gt; and I did talk about the Banana Republic often in this forum.  However, many
&gt; US companies will not engage in corruption practices overseas because US
&gt; companies have many ethical lawyers like me.

&gt; Have a great day!

&gt; &gt; [ Vietnam Business Forum ]

&gt; &gt; Dear Anh Hoanh,

&gt; &gt; Could you please expand a bit on your statement, &quot;The US is the ONLY
&gt; &gt; country in the world that has the anti-corruption practices act&quot;, to explain
&gt; &gt; whether or not this means the US is (a) the only country with
&gt; &gt; anti-corruption laws, (b) the only country with effective anti-corruption
&gt; &gt; laws, (c) the only country with one set of laws specifically called the
&gt; &gt; &quot;Anti-Corruption Practices Act&quot; or (d) some other meaning?  The wording and
&gt; &gt; grammatical mechanics of that statement seem to invite misinterpretation in
&gt; &gt; the USA's favour.

&gt; &gt; I initially wondered about this because i remembered that while living
&gt; &gt; in Hong Kong over 1990-1994 that territory had already instituted a very
&gt; &gt; rigorous set of anti-corruption laws complemented by an enforcement
&gt; &gt; infrastructure that was world-renowned for its effectiveness.  And,
&gt; &gt; according to Google searches on the American Bar Association, US
&gt; &gt; anti-corruption laws seem to date from 2000.AD &lt; http://2000.ad/ &gt;, though
&gt; &gt; i didn't have time to confirm that conclusively.

&gt; &gt; Next, i was reminded of the curious naming of the Operation Iraqi
&gt; &gt; Freedom which avoided the then most prevalent keyword of the Bush Admin's
&gt; &gt; pro-war propaganda, &quot;liberation&quot;.  It would be just too revealing to call
&gt; &gt; the US invasion of the sovereign state of Iraq, &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation&quot;
&gt; &gt; (OIL).  No?

&gt; &gt; Just joking.  But around the rest of world not dominated by the Fox
&gt; &gt; network and other pro-US-Bush-Admin media i think it's been pretty obvious
&gt; &gt; from the beginning of the US invasion of Iraq that that war has always been
&gt; &gt; primarily about controlling oil supplies and resultant wealth (and
&gt; &gt; pollution).

&gt; &gt; Often less obvious have been self-serving links between the Bush Admin',
&gt; &gt; Big Oil and the Bush family's ties to the Saudi regime, Dick Cheney's
&gt; &gt; Halliburton, which was virtually granted a monopoly on repairing the damage
&gt; &gt; the Bush Admin' has been causing in Iraq, along with arms dealers like
&gt; &gt; Carlyle (with its long, well-documented Bush-family ties to the Saudi bin
&gt; &gt; Laden family).  (Cf
&gt; &gt; http://www.google.com/search?q=bush+family+arms-dealers+oil-companies ,
&gt; &gt; in particular &quot;'Frauds-R-Us' - The Bush Family Saga&quot;, http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3308.htm
&gt; &gt; , which has entries about both Halliburton and Carlyle.  Otherwise, if
&gt; &gt; you're not a rabid neocon
&gt; &gt; &lt; http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neocon &gt;, just watch or
&gt; &gt; read Micheal Moore's &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.)

&gt; &gt; Now, if that's not yet another example of the USA's long history of
&gt; &gt; highly sophisticated INSTITUTIONALIZED corruption, i don't know what is.

&gt; &gt; Like the leadership debate, there seems to be yet another glaring gap
&gt; &gt; between principles and practice when we discuss anti-corruption efforts.

&gt; &gt; But how do we measure and rank institutionalized corruption?  Because
&gt; &gt; most accepted international corruption indices (now also &quot;indexes&quot;) are
&gt; &gt; based on legal definitions of corruption most will have difficulty measuring
&gt; &gt; corruption based on legal loopholes or institutionally accepted practices
&gt; &gt; that allow corruption to leak in legally.

&gt; &gt; Still, just to get an idea of how the US ranks on corruption,
&gt; &gt; internationally -- without counting the institutionalized corruption
&gt; &gt; inherent in political campaign contributions, media patronage, etc -- see
&gt; &gt; for example the &quot;2006 Corruption Perception Index&quot; of Transparency
&gt; &gt; International wherein the US ranks 22nd, after Chile. [ http://www.transparency.org/content/download/10825/92857/version/1/fi...
&gt; &gt; ]

&gt; &gt; Also, i did stretch my free time a bit to use the US-dominated World
&gt; &gt; Bank's Governance data to construct a chart of 20 arbitrarily selected
&gt; &gt; nations' &quot;Corruption Control&quot; rankings, including the USA and Vietnam.  I'd
&gt; &gt; suggest it's significantly revealing of the USA's position.  I posted it
&gt; &gt; here: http://govap-sighgone.blogspot.com/2007/08/twenty-nations-ranked-by-c...

&gt; &gt; I'd also submit that the VNExpress report (BeLow) on Intel's
&gt; &gt; anti-corruption role primarily highlights most news media's foci (now also
&gt; &gt; &quot;focuses&quot;) on news involving what the TV ad-industry calls &quot;Jiggles &amp;
&gt; &gt; Jolts&quot;, ie representations of sex, money, violence, etc, to attract and hold
&gt; &gt; viewers attention.  Jiggles &amp; Jolts sell the news just like they sell TV
&gt; &gt; game shows.  Just as your own anti-corruption efforts went unreported, Anh
&gt; &gt; Hoanh, i'm sure hundreds of other laudable efforts before Intel's have just
&gt; &gt; not been judged &quot;news-worthy&quot;.

&gt; &gt; Last but not least, i'd suggest we should not forget the pervasive
&gt; &gt; impact bribes still have in the editorial choices of Vietnam Inc's PR
&gt; &gt; Department, ie, the nation's entire state-owned news media.

&gt; &gt; Just yet another couple of dong's worth -- for whatever that's worth
&gt; &gt; (max VND16,198/USD according to Vietcombank, at http://www.thanhniennews.com/exrates/index.php
&gt; &gt; , but VND16,200/USD at a Go Vap jewelry shop, yesterday).

&gt; &gt; With regards,

from the VIETNAM NEWS BRIEFS, August 14, 2007 Intel Products Vietnam, an
affiliate of the US-based chip giant and the Saigon Hi-tech Park (SHTP) in
Ho Chi Minh City expect to sign today [August 14] a memorandum of
understanding to jointly fight red tape and corruption, Thanh Nien
newspaper reported

Under the agreement, the two sides would have to comply with business
ethnics and other rules of conduct focusing on honesty and
straightforwardness, head of the SHTP Nguyen Dinh Mai told Thanh Nien
journalist, saying that Intel and SHTP will also cooperate closely to
detect and deal with bribery and other wrongdoings

This is the first time Intel has signed this kind of MoU, Rick Howarth,
CEO of Intel Vietnam said, hoping that the signature will help Vietnamese
government better its fight against corruption, which is considered a
serious threat to the Southeast Asian nation's economic development. In
upcoming time, Howarth noted, Intel would collaborate with agencies at
higher levels, even the government to combat the evil. Anti-corruption
will also be a good way to contribute to projects' success and convince
more foreign investors to Vietnam, the CEO said

In March Intel began construction of a $1 billion computer component
facility in SHTP which is scheduled to begin production in mid 2009. It
will be Intel's largest global chip manufacturing facility.

&gt; Dear Sister Bich Lien &amp; CACC,

&gt; You pose a wonderful question, sister.  Lucky for the students who have
&gt; you as their teacher, Bich :Lien they will learn well!

&gt; &quot;There must be something else, a part from legislation and individual
&gt; citizens, that make the system the way it did.  An open-ended question, to
&gt; which I have no answer.&quot;  That is so true!  Bich Lien, I had that question
&gt; when I was 17, and it followed me for several decades, and during that
&gt; times, I searched for the answer in every thing under the sun; you name it,
&gt; I have searched in it.

&gt; I have such a strong urge to share with you my long journey, but to save
&gt; everyone's time, let me just share the final observation: The missing thing
&gt; that sis. Bich Lien is looking for is &quot;*the standard of conduct that the
&gt; majority of the people demand. *&quot;

&gt; If the *majority* of people demand the *standard *that their leaders have
&gt; to be honest, that bribery is bad, then the country will have honest leaders
&gt; and will have less corruption.  If the majority of people think that their
&gt; leaders just have to be &quot;effective&quot; (whatever effective means)but don't have
&gt; to be honest, and that corruption/bribery is an OK way to live and to do
&gt; business, then the country will be marred with lying/cheating leaders and
&gt; corruption will fill the scene.

&gt; Please note, I say &quot;*majority of people*.&quot; Sister Bich Lien said there are
&gt; MANY good officials.  But many is not enough if that many is still the
&gt; minority.

&gt; And I say &quot;*standard of conduct*,&quot; meaning, the character traits that
&gt; people look up to and whoever achieves such characters will be admired by
&gt; most people, the character traits that people want their leaders to possess
&gt; . Standard is usually a bit idealistic, because standard is for &quot;the
&gt; best scenario.&quot;  Say, the standard score for good student is the perfect
&gt; 10/10.  But few students ever achieve this.  Most good students would get
&gt; 9/10 or 8/10 only.  However, everything being equal, the school that has
&gt; the 10/10 standard will produce much better students than the school that
&gt; sets 8/10 as its standard.

&gt; Most people in Vietnam think that paying and receiving bribes is OK, it is
&gt; just a way to do things.  The majority of the people will not stand up and
&gt; say that it is bad and that it must be stopped.  (Since 18 years old in
&gt; college in Saigon, I have fought against most of my friends who would
&gt; convinced me that corruption and bribery is the way to live and that I am
&gt; just naive.  Imagine you hear this from 18 years old kids (who were my
&gt; friends)!  Sad but true.  And today many people still tell me that I am too
&gt; idealistic, that they don't need honest leaders, that they believe
&gt; corruption is an OK or acceptable way to do business, or corruption is just
&gt; a matter of semantic.

&gt; We will always disagree in many specific circumstances whether a sentence
&gt; spoken is honest or not, or a specific gift or payment is indeed a bribe.
&gt; Application of a rule to a specific case may raise disagreement among
&gt; friends.  That is OK.  But at least, the majority of the people have to
&gt; believe in the rule of honesty and the rule of clean business and clean
&gt; government.  If we don't have the majority, the minority of good people
&gt; won't be enough.

&gt; How to get that majority?  Simple, keep talking, keep preaching, keep
&gt; teaching, and keep practicing honesty and cleanliness.  It is hard, because
&gt; we all are human, and we all, including me, and especially me, fail often
&gt; for our weaknesses, and we need to eat and pay bills and feed our children
&gt; too.  I know.  But if we have faith in the ultimate victory of goodness,
&gt; will stand up after each fall, and continue talking about honesty and clean
&gt; governance again and again and again, time after time after time, regardless
&gt; of what the negative people may say, then eventually that majority will be
&gt; achieved.

&gt; Trust me.  Have faith!

&gt; Have a great day, sis. Bich Lien and all.

&gt; &gt;    1. The OECD member countries adopted a Convention on Combating
&gt; &gt;    Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions
&gt; &gt;    in 1997.

&gt; &gt;    1. Corruption in Vietnam, as elsewhere, is often systematic.  So I
&gt; &gt;    guess that an institutional approach to corruption may help enlighten the
&gt; &gt;    problem.  Having said this, I do not mean to underestimate the fact that
&gt; &gt;    ethical individuals/citizens are jewels in every society.  But as Nam Cao
&gt; &gt;    stated [almost hundred years ago] in the famous Chi Pheo &quot;tao muon lam nguoi
&gt; &gt;    tu te, nhung ai cho tao lam nguoi tu te&quot; (I want to be a good person, but
&gt; &gt;    who allows me to do that???).  Within my limited circle of
&gt; &gt;    friends/acquaintances, I already know MANY public officials in Vietnam who
&gt; &gt;    have relatively high ethical standards and want to be good citizens.  But
&gt; &gt;    it's the fact that they are operating in a system that is known for high
&gt; &gt;    level of corruption.  The system has not been mature enough to facilitate
&gt; &gt;    them to do what they want -- life is a matter of choice, and I can well
&gt; &gt;    understand one's choice of survival before ethical.  If the US has FCPA,
&gt; &gt;    Vietnam has an Anti-corruption Law too.  And I just mentioned, Vietnam seems
&gt; &gt;    not lack ethical officials/professionals either.  There must be something
&gt; &gt;    else, apart from legislation, and individual citizens, that makes the system
&gt; &gt;    the way it is.  An open-ended question, to which I have no answer.

Hello everyone
the interesting point in this article for me is : It highlights the
important role of bussines-organisation/individual and citizen in anti
corruption.  Mostly, i found people usually blame Government officials for
bribe &amp;corruption , and only see Government's role in changing the
situation, but forgot to see that citizen/bussiness organisaion are the main
cause of it.
Like a Hoanh mention, the behavior of &quot;ignorance&quot; of citizen , saying
&quot;bribes is ok, just the way it is...&quot; or &quot;under-table case&quot; of
bussniess-org..I think it makes the corruption worse. It becomes practice.
:-)
Some of my though!

&gt; &gt; the 10/10 standard will produce much better students than the school that
&gt; &gt; sets 8/10 as its standard.

&gt; &gt; Most people in Vietnam think that paying and receiving bribes is OK, it
&gt; &gt; is just a way to do things.  The majority of the people will not stand up
&gt; &gt; and say that it is bad and that it must be stopped.  (Since 18 years old in
&gt; &gt; college in Saigon, I have fought against most of my friends who would
&gt; &gt; convinced me that corruption and bribery is the way to live and that I am
&gt; &gt; just naive.  Imagine you hear this from 18 years old kids (who were my
&gt; &gt; friends)!  Sad but true.  And today many people still tell me that I am too
&gt; &gt; idealistic, that they don't need honest leaders, that they believe
&gt; &gt; corruption is an OK or acceptable way to do business, or corruption is just
&gt; &gt; a matter of semantic.

&gt; &gt; We will always disagree in many specific circumstances whether a
&gt; &gt; sentence spoken is honest or not, or a specific gift or payment is indeed a
&gt; &gt; bribe.  Application of a rule to a specific case may raise disagreement
&gt; &gt; among friends.  That is OK.  But at least, the majority of the people have
&gt; &gt; to believe in the rule of honesty and the rule of clean business and clean
&gt; &gt; government.  If we don't have the majority, the minority of good people
&gt; &gt; won't be enough.

&gt; &gt; How to get that majority?  Simple, keep talking, keep preaching, keep
&gt; &gt; teaching, and keep practicing honesty and cleanliness.  It is hard, because
&gt; &gt; we all are human, and we all, including me, and especially me, fail often
&gt; &gt; for our weaknesses, and we need to eat and pay bills and feed our children
&gt; &gt; too.  I know.  But if we have faith in the ultimate victory of goodness,
&gt; &gt; will stand up after each fall, and continue talking about honesty and clean
&gt; &gt; governance again and again and again, time after time after time, regardless
&gt; &gt; of what the negative people may say, then eventually that majority will be
&gt; &gt; achieved.

&gt; &gt; Trust me.  Have faith!

&gt; &gt; Have a great day, sis. Bich Lien and all.

Perhaps anh Hoanh can show how many times the FCPA have been used in court
since its inception.
Its real value is as a tool for U.S. businesses to sidestep &quot;requests&quot; for
&quot;payments&quot;.
Here's my own practical approach to thinking about corruption in general:
Companies, people will decide whether or not to engage in corruption based
on their own interests.
They will if the benefits outweight the costs and vice versa.

A set of anti-corruption laws must be in place.
A free and independent press plays the most important role in exposing
corruption.
A fair, competent, and independent court is necessary to prosecute
corruption.
Vietnam has the first element in place, the second element is partially in
place but still weak, and the third element still weaker.

In this context, Intel Vietnam's action is smart and logical:  it is
simply immunizing itself against corruption, witnessed by both the USG and
GVN.
This is much easier done for large multinational companies than for small
businessess.

Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

[ Vietnam Business Forum ]

Dear Sister Bich Lien &amp; CACC,

You pose a wonderful question, sister.  Lucky for the students who have
you as their teacher, Bich :Lien they will learn well!

&quot;There must be something else, a part from legislation and individual
citizens, that make the system the way it did.  An open-ended question, to
which I have no answer.&quot;  That is so true!  Bich Lien, I had that question
when I was 17, and it followed me for several decades, and during that
times, I searched for the answer in every thing under the sun; you name
it, I have searched in it.

I have such a strong urge to share with you my long journey, but to save
everyone's time, let me just share the final observation: The missing
thing that sis. Bich Lien is looking for is &quot;the standard of conduct that
the majority of the people demand. &quot;

If the majority of people demand the standard that their leaders have to
be honest, that bribery is bad, then the country will have honest leaders
and will have less corruption.  If the majority of people think that their
leaders just have to be &quot;effective&quot; (whatever effective means)but don't
have to be honest, and that corruption/bribery is an OK way to live and to
do business, then the country will be marred with lying/cheating leaders
and corruption will fill the scene.

Please note, I say &quot;majority of people.&quot; Sister Bich Lien said there are
MANY good officials.  But many is not enough if that many is still the
minority.

And I say &quot;standard of conduct,&quot; meaning, the character traits that people
look up to and whoever achieves such characters will be admired by most
people, the character traits that people want their leaders to possess .
Standard is usually a bit idealistic, because standard is for &quot;the best
scenario.&quot;  Say, the standard score for good student is the perfect 10/10.
But few students ever achieve this.  Most good students would get 9/10 or
8/10 only.  However, everything being equal, the school that has the 10/10
standard will produce much better students than the school that sets 8/10
as its standard.

Most people in Vietnam think that paying and receiving bribes is OK, it is
just a way to do things.  The majority of the people will not stand up and
say that it is bad and that it must be stopped.  (Since 18 years old in

Dear Brother Phong &amp; CACC,

FCPS is not my area of expertise so I can't tell how often it is enforced.
But I have worked on the defense of a FCPS prosecution by the US
government.  Executives of a beer company of the US paid tons of money and
gifts to the generals of a Middle East country to have that country's army
buy their beer.  Later there was a fallout among the US executives and one
of the guys talked to the US government.  A major investigation and
prosecution followed.  I worked on the defense team.

The other thing is that in the US international trade conferences I attended
over the years, US companies usually complain that they cannot compete
overseas because other countries' companies are free to follow &quot;local
customs&quot; (concerning corruption), but US companies cannot do that (But, US
companies also know that the FCPS is supposed to help them compete
internationally by giving them the reputation of clean and ethical business
practices).  So, the FCPS effect on US companies is real.  It is not a
pretext for anything.

Another thing most people don't think about is that US companies rely very
heavily on lawyers in doing business.   And when they have a lawyer around,
the first thing they say when troubles happen is that &quot;Hey, I talked to our
lawyer over that, and he said it was OK.&quot;  So the lawyer is ALWAYS the first
scape goat.  Because of that, most US corporate lawyers are very careful in
advising client.  I was one of them.  We always stay on the safe side and
tell the client clearly what is illegal or illegal and tell them to stay
clearly within the limit of the law, and we always put down our advise in
writing, so that later no one can point the finger at us &quot;Hey, my
lawyer said it was OK.&quot;  So US lawyers operate most of the time as a big
legal break on his client's aggressiveness.

I was in the heavy-dosed corporate world for some years and realized that
most US corporations are much more ethical than people realize.

Have a great day!

Hoanh

Agreed, Thanh: that it can't just be government's problem and it is good to
see the media here getting away from focusing only on gov'.

But i also think another angle comes into this just as sharply: that is,
simple economics.  This is an old issue of passion of mine.  Pardon me if i
spew on a bit too much about it now.

If a cop, customs officer, tax collector or other enforcement agent is paid
to enforce rules (legislative or even unwritten ethical ones) managing
transactions that amounting to dozens of times his or her salary, and he or
she knows, too, that minor shares of those transactions are taken in taxes
that pay for his or her salary, splitting the profit, so to speak, will
almost certainly happen more than it would otherwise.  It's just sort of a
natural market correction of gaps in the artificial markets created by
laws.

And, often, even in Vietnam now, everyone benefits in the short term, at
least while government legal, taxation and enforcement infrastructures are
still inadequately efficient.  Instead of the excess profits being filtered
and documented, and transactions slowed, by legal or fiscal (taxation)
enforcement mechanisms, the actors involved negotiate and trade directly,
each immediately taking whatever shares they will accept (as natural,
&quot;freed&quot; market actors).

It has been several times more than once that i've heard foreign business
folk here in Saigon applauding the superior (if short-term) efficiency of
simply going under-the-table compared to going legal channels back home.
And it was no different in Canada, the US and most of the West less than a
century ago.  And entrepreneurs in the more advanced countries who still
pine for the good old days of less cost-effective government regulation are
still not uncommon.

Laws, regulation and moral minorities are both the creators and impetus of
the grey and black markets.  Markets outside &quot;the Law&quot; have been filling the
gaps between natural human levels of demand and supply and those they try to
impose ever since laws were created.

The illegal sex and drug trades are classic examples.  Both have have
existed and prospered ever since many people tried out and liked the things
they can get in those markets and others more powerful have tried to stop
them.  If enough people want or need some thing (product or service), no
matter what laws or ethics want to curb the supply or demand of that thing,
some people still will buy and sell it, but simply at higher prices -- and
usually higher,
&quot;supernormal&lt; http://www.pinkmonkey.com/studyguides/subjects/eco/chap9/e0909301.asp &gt;&quot;
profits, too, to compensate themselves for higher risks they must take --
than the price or profits that would exist without those social or legal
restrictions.

Both In deed and by definition, artificial laws or ethics that impose
restrictions or prohibition on pervasive demand or attendant supply create
the grey and black markets they must then end up fighting.   That's
something few followers of &quot;common sense&quot; like to know or remember.

Further, they usually provide the impetus for both the growth and
criminality of the illicit markets, and, the funding of those fighting
against them, from the super-normal profits they create and the criminality
they impose on the illicit markets.

If they can get a high enough price to offset their risks, people will
supply other people who want things restricted by laws, like alcohol,
marijuana, extreme sex or whatever.  And, if artificially limited legal
suppliers exist, the illegal suppliers will usually provide either lower
prices and higher volumes or additional volumes at higher prices than any
legal suppliers, if any, are able to provide.  Thus, they'll usually earn
super-normal profits.

And since they are legally classified as outside either the regulation or
protection of &quot;the Law&quot;, they will buy or build their own private, likely
illegal protection services.  And since anything legally restricted can
usually still be bought or built in illegal markets, extremes of related,
unethical or illegal behaviors and business practices will most likely
support the restricted things' markets as well.

At the same time, if the regulators are insufficiently funded relative to
those supernormal profits, corruption most likely increases among their
ranks.  Those wanting to effectively maintain such restrictions must then
compensate and fund their enforcement services relative to the super-normal
profits created or watch their regulatory efforts be undermined by the gaps
between their enforcers' incomes and those they try to restrict.

That's why US Drug-War enforcement organizations are now usually to keep and
use the monies they seize and why lawyers in the advanced nations are so
much better paid than those in nations with less developed or efficient
legal and enforcement systems.

So the end result is both the regulators and suppliers that refuse their
regulation generally get richer than they would without the regulatory
laws.  And, all too often, if not usually, they both get rich enough to buy
or create and maintain or grow their own well-supplied security and
enforcement services, like those of the US Mafia and drug cartels versus the
US DEA, ATF, etc, etc and Army!

And both naturally have a very strong impetus to neither stop nor stop
growing as long as they're profiting more than those in unregulated, often
more competitive markets.

Few major criminal markets have ever been stopped completely by any
prohibitive legal systems.  Prostitution is not called the world's oldest
profession for nothing.  Porn is not the Internet biggest, most technically
sophisticated sector by either chance or exception.  And the Drug Wars the
nations wage on their own peoples only escalate each year with the best
weaponry that can be bought being used on both sides.  Some actors and
organizations get stopped or fade out, by enforcement or their own internal
economic errors, but others always replace them, at least until the
prohibitive laws are abolished.

The US Prohibition of the early 20th century is the classic example today.
The Drug War is not that classic example today simply because its still
being fought and &quot;truth is always the first casualty of war&quot;.

All told, the above, i'd say, is roughly the ultimate argument for keeping
unnaturally restrictive laws to an absolute minimum and using them only when
they will clearly and unequivocally provide net benefits to an overall
market, communal, national or international.

But then that's ultimately an argument for economic efficiency, and even
justice, via libertarianism if not virtual anarchy, a result few of any
population can understand or accept.  And just as few politicians,
legislators or lawyers will promote either one, since neither libertarianism
nor anarchy require as many or as well-paid politicians or bureaucrats as
more regulated markets require -- sort of a lascivious, symbiotic circle of
economic actors, you know?

&gt; Hello everyone
&gt; the interesting point in this article for me is : It highlights the
&gt; important role of bussines-organisation/individual and citizen in anti

&gt; bribe &amp;corruption , and only see Government's role in changing the
&gt; situation, but forgot to see that citizen/bussiness organisaion are the main
&gt; cause of it.
&gt; Like a Hoanh mention, the behavior of &quot;ignorance&quot; of citizen , saying
&gt; &quot;bribes is ok, just the way it is...&quot; or &quot;under-table case&quot; of

&gt; Companies, people will decide whether or not to engage in corruption based
&gt; on their own interests.
&gt; They will if the benefits outweight the costs and vice versa.

&gt; A set of anti-corruption laws must be in place.
&gt; A free and independent press plays the most important role in exposing
&gt; corruption.
&gt; A fair, competent, and independent court is necessary to prosecute
&gt; corruption.
&gt; Vietnam has the first element in place, the second element is partially in
&gt; place but still weak, and the third element still weaker.

&gt; In this context, Intel Vietnam's action is smart and logical:  it is
&gt; simply immunizing itself against corruption, witnessed by both the USG and
&gt; GVN.
&gt; This is much easier done for large multinational companies than for small
&gt; businessess.

&gt; Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

&gt; [ Vietnam Business Forum ]

&gt; Dear Sister Bich Lien &amp; CACC,

&gt; You pose a wonderful question, sister.  Lucky for the students who have
&gt; you as their teacher, Bich :Lien they will learn well!

&gt; &quot;There must be something else, a part from legislation and individual
&gt; citizens, that make the system the way it did.  An open-ended question, to
&gt; which I have no answer.&quot;  That is so true!  Bich Lien, I had that question
&gt; when I was 17, and it followed me for several decades, and during that
&gt; times, I searched for the answer in every thing under the sun; you name it,
&gt; I have searched in it.

&gt; I have such a strong urge to share with you my long journey, but to save
&gt; everyone's time, let me just share the final observation: The missing thing
&gt; that sis. Bich Lien is looking for is &quot;*the standard of conduct that the
&gt; majority of the people demand. *&quot;

&gt; If the *majority* of people demand the *standard *that their leaders have
&gt; to be honest, that bribery is bad, then the country will have honest leaders
&gt; and will have less corruption.  If the majority of people think that their
&gt; leaders just have to be &quot;effective&quot; (whatever effective means)but don't have
&gt; to be honest, and that corruption/bribery is an OK way to live and to do
&gt; business, then the country will be marred with lying/cheating leaders and
&gt; corruption will fill the scene.

&gt; Please note, I say &quot;*majority of people*.&quot; Sister Bich Lien said there are
&gt; MANY good officials.  But many is not enough if that many is still the
&gt; minority.

&gt; And I say &quot;*standard of conduct*,&quot; meaning, the character traits that
&gt; people look up to and whoever achieves such characters will be admired by
&gt; most people, the character traits that people want their leaders to possess
&gt; . Standard is usually a bit idealistic, because standard is for &quot;the best
&gt; scenario.&quot;  Say, the standard score for good student is the perfect 10/10.
&gt;  But few students ever achieve this.  Most good students would get 9/10 or
&gt; 8/10 only.  However, everything being equal, the school that has the 10/10
&gt; standard will produce much better students than the school that sets 8/10 as
&gt; its standard.

&gt; Most people in Vietnam think that paying and receiving bribes is OK, it is
&gt; just a way to do things.  The majority of the people will not stand up and
&gt; say that it is bad and that it must be stopped.  (Since 18 years old in
&gt; college in Saigon, I have fought against most of my friends who would
&gt; convinced me that corruption and bribery is the way to live and that I am
&gt; just naive.  Imagine you hear this from 18 years old kids (who were my
&gt; friends)!  Sad but true.  And today many people still tell me that I am too
&gt; idealistic, that they don't need honest leaders, that they believe
&gt; corruption is an OK or acceptable way to do business, or corruption is just
&gt; a matter of semantic.

&gt; We will always disagree in many specific circumstances whether a sentence
&gt; spoken is honest or not, or a specific gift or payment is indeed a bribe.
&gt;  Application of a rule to a specific case may raise disagreement among
&gt; friends.  That is OK.  But at least, the majority of the people have to
&gt; believe in the rule of honesty and the rule of clean business and clean
&gt; government.  If we don't have the majority, the minority of good people
&gt; won't be enough.

&gt; How to get that majority?  Simple, keep talking, keep preaching, keep
&gt; teaching, and keep practicing honesty and cleanliness.  It is hard, because
&gt; we all are human, and we all, including me, and especially me, fail often
&gt; for our weaknesses, and we need to eat and pay bills and feed our children
&gt; too.  I know.  But if we have faith in the ultimate victory of goodness,
&gt; will stand up after each fall, and continue talking about honesty and clean
&gt; governance again and again and again, time after time after time, regardless
&gt; of what the negative people may say, then eventually that majority will be
&gt; achieved.

&gt; Trust me.  Have faith!

&gt; Have a great day, sis. Bich Lien and all.

Great point about the conflict between peoples' ethics and the economics
they face, Chi Lien -- not only because it supports my own arguments.  ;)

Some related extracts from the Book of Tao, posted earlier to this list:

Fifty-eight
When the country is ruled with a light hand
The people are simple.
When the country is ruled with severity,
The people are cunning.

[And remembering that this was written in a time in China when death was a
common punishment for breaking any laws and all out rebellion was often the
only effective form of popular resistance...]

Seventy-five
...

Why are the people rebellious?
Because the rulers interfere too much.
Therefore they are rebellious.

Why do the people think so little of death?
Because the rulers demand too much of life.
Therefore the people take death lightly.

Having little to live on, one knows better than to value life too much.

&gt; Dear brother Andi,

&gt; The US Foreign Corrup-tion Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits U.S.
&gt; companies, their subsidiaries, as well as their officers, directors,
&gt; employees, and agents from bribing &quot;foreign officials&quot; (and also requires
&gt; U.S. companies that issue debt or equity to maintain internal accounting
&gt; controls and to keep books and records that accurately reflect all
&gt; transactions).   It means that even if the payment is considered legal in a
&gt; foreign country under the law or normal practice of that country (such as
&gt; the customary &quot;boi duong&quot; or &quot;gifts&quot; in Vietnam), it is still illegal under
&gt; the US law if it violates the FCPA  and the American violator will be
&gt; prosecuted in the US court, even if the payment is done in a foreign
&gt; country.

&gt; As far as I know, only the US reaches its citizens that far.  Other
&gt; countries will let its citizens do whatever is considered legal practice in
&gt; a foreign country.

&gt; I don't understand why we have to talk about Iraq.  I oppose that war
&gt; because it is stupid.  But it is not about oil, or at leadt not about oil
&gt; only.  (/11 attack on the US is real, and if Bush over-reacted in Iraq, that
&gt; would be easy to understand.  :Let's stay with what we can prove by facts.

&gt; I am not saying that American companies are not corrupt,  Some of them do,
&gt; and I did talk about the Banana Republic often in this forum.  However, many
&gt; US companies will not engage in corruption practices overseas because US
&gt; companies have many ethical lawyers like me.

&gt; Dear Anh Hoanh,

&gt; Could you please expand a bit on your statement, &quot;The US is the ONLY
&gt; country in the world that has the anti-corruption practices act&quot;, to explain
&gt; whether or not this means the US is (a) the only country with
&gt; anti-corruption laws, (b) the only country with effective anti-corruption
&gt; laws, (c) the only country with one set of laws specifically called the
&gt; &quot;Anti-Corruption Practices Act&quot; or (d) some other meaning?  The wording and
&gt; grammatical mechanics of that statement seem to invite misinterpretation in
&gt; the USA's favour.

&gt; I initially wondered about this because i remembered that while living in
&gt; Hong Kong over 1990-1994 that territory had already instituted a very
&gt; rigorous set of anti-corruption laws complemented by an enforcement
&gt; infrastructure that was world-renowned for its effectiveness.  And,
&gt; according to Google searches on the American Bar Association, US
&gt; anti-corruption laws seem to date from 2000.AD &lt; http://2000.ad/ &gt;, though i
&gt; didn't have time to confirm that conclusively.

&gt; Next, i was reminded of the curious naming of the Operation Iraqi Freedom
&gt; which avoided the then most prevalent keyword of the Bush Admin's pro-war
&gt; propaganda, &quot;liberation&quot;.  It would be just too revealing to call the US
&gt; invasion of the sovereign state of Iraq, &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation&quot;
&gt; (OIL).  No?

&gt; Just joking.  But around the rest of world not dominated by the Fox
&gt; network and other pro-US-Bush-Admin media i think it's been pretty obvious
&gt; from the beginning of the US invasion of Iraq that that war has always been
&gt; primarily about controlling oil supplies and resultant wealth (and
&gt; pollution).

&gt; Often less obvious have been self-serving links between the Bush Admin',
&gt; Big Oil and the Bush family's ties to the Saudi regime, Dick Cheney's
&gt; Halliburton, which was virtually granted a monopoly on repairing the damage
&gt; the Bush Admin' has been causing in Iraq, along with arms dealers like
&gt; Carlyle (with its long, well-documented Bush-family ties to the Saudi bin
&gt; Laden family).  (Cf
&gt; http://www.google.com/search?q=bush+family+arms-dealers+oil-companies , in
&gt; particular &quot;'Frauds-R-Us' - The Bush Family Saga&quot;, http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3308.htm
&gt; , which has entries about both Halliburton and Carlyle.  Otherwise, if
&gt; you're not a rabid neocon
&gt; &lt; http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neocon &gt;, just watch or
&gt; read Micheal Moore's &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.)

&gt; Now, if that's not yet another example of the USA's long history of highly
&gt; sophisticated INSTITUTIONALIZED corruption, i don't know what is.

&gt; Like the leadership debate, there seems to be yet another glaring gap
&gt; between principles and practice when we discuss anti-corruption efforts.

&gt; But how do we measure and rank institutionalized corruption?  Because most
&gt; accepted international corruption indices (now also &quot;indexes&quot;) are based on
&gt; legal definitions of corruption most will have difficulty measuring
&gt; corruption based on legal loopholes or institutionally accepted practices
&gt; that allow corruption to leak in legally.

&gt; Still, just to get an idea of how the US ranks on corruption,
&gt; internationally -- without counting the institutionalized corruption
&gt; inherent in political campaign contributions, media patronage, etc -- see
&gt; for example the &quot;2006 Corruption Perception Index&quot; of Transparency
&gt; International wherein the US ranks 22nd, after Chile. [ http://www.transparency.org/content/download/10825/92857/version/1/fi...
&gt; ]

&gt; Also, i did stretch my free time a bit to use the US-dominated World
&gt; Bank's Governance data to construct a chart of 20 arbitrarily selected
&gt; nations' &quot;Corruption Control&quot; rankings, including the USA and Vietnam.  I'd
&gt; suggest it's significantly revealing of the USA's position.  I posted it
&gt; here: http://govap-sighgone.blogspot.com/2007/08/twenty-nations-ranked-by-c...

&gt; I'd also submit that the VNExpress report (BeLow) on Intel's
&gt; anti-corruption role primarily highlights most news media's foci (now also
&gt; &quot;focuses&quot;) on news involving what the TV ad-industry calls &quot;Jiggles &amp;
&gt; Jolts&quot;, ie representations of sex, money, violence, etc, to attract and hold
&gt; viewers attention.  Jiggles &amp; Jolts sell the news just like they sell TV
&gt; game shows.  Just as your own anti-corruption efforts went unreported, Anh
&gt; Hoanh, i'm sure hundreds of other laudable efforts before Intel's have just
&gt; not been judged &quot;news-worthy&quot;.

&gt; Last but not least, i'd suggest we should not forget the pervasive impact
&gt; bribes still have in the editorial choices of Vietnam Inc's PR Department,
&gt; ie, the nation's entire state-owned news media.

&gt; Just yet another couple of dong's worth -- for whatever that's worth (max
&gt; VND16,198/USD according to Vietcombank, at http://www.thanhniennews.com/exrates/index.php
&gt; , but VND16,200/USD at a Go Vap jewelry shop, yesterday).

Before introducing this further diversion following along the path Chi
Lien's last post takes this thread, i'd like to say that if i'd read the
posts of Chi Lien and Hong-Phong_ ... @ita.doc.gov first, i could have and
would have made my last long post a lot shorter.  ;)

The related issues highlighted by the follow report from the American Bar
Association's Journal online (ABAJournal.com) are:

1. an extension Chi Lien's point, that if even ethical people see that
it is too difficult to stay within the law, they will get used to working
outside it, if only to minimize their contact with &quot;the Law&quot;;
2. supporting my own suggestion that underground economies (hiding
from government) can often be rational grey market solutions to inadequate
legal infrastructures.

The report is entitled &quot;Jail a Risk for Vietnam Investors&quot;:

Posted Aug 14, 2007, 11:10 am CDT
[to the ABAJournal online; Slogan - &quot;Law news now&quot;
at http://www.abajournal.com/news/jail_a_risk_for_vietnam_investors/ -- ADM]
By Debra Cassens Weiss &lt; http://www.abajournal.com/authors/4 &gt;

Investors hoping to make big money in Vietnam face risks, not the least of
which is jail.

That's the lesson learned by American businessman Hoan Nguyen, who sat in a
Hanoi prison for 14 months while police investigated a business dispute with
his government partners, the Wall Street
Journal&lt; http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118702662210596089.html &gt;(sub.
req.) reports.

Nguyen told the newspaper he was allowed to see a lawyer only twice while he
was held without charges. A preliminary police report found there was not
enough evidence to bring charges, but a final decision is still pending.
Meanwhile, the $85,000 his family paid in what was supposed to be bail money
has not been returned.

Businesspeople in Vietnam face risks of jail under the broadly defined crime
of economic mismanagement, said Tony Foster, who heads the Vietnamese
practice at British firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. Business disputes
turn into problems for the criminal justice system because complainants
can't get recourse in the ill-equipped civil justice system.

&gt; &gt; anti-corruption laws, (b) the only country with effective anti-corruption
&gt; &gt; laws, (c) the only country with one set of laws specifically called the
&gt; &gt; &quot;Anti-Corruption Practices Act&quot; or (d) some other meaning?  The wording and
&gt; &gt; grammatical mechanics of that statement seem to invite misinterpretation in
&gt; &gt; the USA's favour.

&gt; &gt; I initially wondered about this because i remembered that while living
&gt; &gt; in Hong Kong over 1990-1994 that territory had already instituted a very
&gt; &gt; rigorous set of anti-corruption laws complemented by an enforcement
&gt; &gt; infrastructure that was world-renowned for its effectiveness.  And,
&gt; &gt; according to Google searches on the American Bar Association, US
&gt; &gt; anti-corruption laws seem to date from 2000.AD &lt; http://2000.ad/ &gt;, though
&gt; &gt; i didn't have time to confirm that conclusively.

&gt; &gt; Next, i was reminded of the curious naming of the Operation Iraqi
&gt; &gt; Freedom which avoided the then most prevalent keyword of the Bush Admin's
&gt; &gt; pro-war propaganda, &quot;liberation&quot;.  It would be just too revealing to call
&gt; &gt; the US invasion of the sovereign state of Iraq, &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation&quot;
&gt; &gt; (OIL).  No?

&gt; &gt; Just joking.  But around the rest of world not dominated by the Fox
&gt; &gt; network and other pro-US-Bush-Admin media i think it's been pretty obvious
&gt; &gt; from the beginning of the US invasion of Iraq that that war has always been
&gt; &gt; primarily about controlling oil supplies and resultant wealth (and
&gt; &gt; pollution).

&gt; &gt; Often less obvious have been self-serving links between the Bush Admin',
&gt; &gt; Big Oil and the Bush family's ties to the Saudi regime, Dick Cheney's
&gt; &gt; Halliburton, which was virtually granted a monopoly on repairing the damage
&gt; &gt; the Bush Admin' has been causing in Iraq, along with arms dealers like
&gt; &gt; Carlyle (with its long, well-documented Bush-family ties to the Saudi bin
&gt; &gt; Laden family).  (Cf
&gt; &gt; http://www.google.com/search?q=bush+family+arms-dealers+oil-companies ,
&gt; &gt; in particular &quot;'Frauds-R-Us' - The Bush Family Saga&quot;, http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3308.htm
&gt; &gt; , which has entries about both Halliburton and Carlyle.  Otherwise, if
&gt; &gt; you're not a rabid neocon
&gt; &gt; &lt; http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neocon &gt;, just watch or
&gt; &gt; read Micheal Moore's &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;.)

&gt; &gt; Now, if that's not yet another example of the USA's long history of
&gt; &gt; highly sophisticated INSTITUTIONALIZED corruption, i don't know what is.

&gt; &gt; Like the leadership debate, there seems to be yet another glaring gap
&gt; &gt; between principles and practice when we discuss anti-corruption efforts.

&gt; &gt; But how do we measure and rank institutionalized corruption?  Because
&gt; &gt; most accepted international corruption indices (now also &quot;indexes&quot;) are
&gt; &gt; based on legal definitions

Dear anh Hoanh,
You can't have it both ways claiming to be a heavy-dosed corporate lawyer
and saying that FCPA is not your expertise.
When a lawyer doesn't know some part of the law, he does research (or get
the paralegal to do it for him).
How many cases were successfully prosecuted?  You may also want to find
out  about FCPA's exceptions.
I am saying that FCPA is not a good law, it is great.  But I think we need
to be careful to match principle with action if we wish to avoid being
perceived as hypocrites.
&quot;Our lawyer told me so or our accountant told me&quot; so are not legal
defense.
Companies' main goal is to maximize profits.  Being careful not to run
afoul of the law does not deviate from that goal if being caught and
prosecuted hurt the bottom line.  Otherwise, if the penalty is light,
companies will make the conscious decision to brake law and pay the fines.
Its ethical when defined as rules and standards, but not moral principles
or values.

Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

[ Vietnam Business Forum ]

Dear Brother Phong &amp; CACC,

FCPS is not my area of expertise so I can't tell how often it is enforced.
But I have worked on the defense of a FCPS prosecution by the US
government.  Executives of a beer company of the US paid tons of money and
gifts to the generals of a Middle East country to have that country's army
buy their beer.  Later there was a fallout among the US executives and one
of the guys talked to the US government.  A major investigation and
prosecution followed.  I worked on the defense team.

The other thing is that in the US international trade conferences I
attended over the years, US companies usually complain that they cannot
compete overseas because other countries' companies are free to follow
&quot;local customs&quot; (concerning corruption), but US companies cannot do that
(But, US companies also know that the FCPS is supposed to help them
compete internationally by giving them the reputation of clean and ethical
business practices).  So, the FCPS effect on US companies is real.  It is
not a pretext for anything.

Another thing most people don't think about is that US companies rely very
heavily on lawyers in doing business.   And when they have a lawyer
around, the first thing they say when troubles happen is that &quot;Hey, I
talked to our lawyer over that, and he said it was OK.&quot;  So the lawyer is
ALWAYS the first scape goat.  Because of that, most US corporate lawyers
are very careful in advising client.  I was one of them.  We always stay
on the safe side and tell the client clearly what is illegal or illegal
and tell them to stay clearly within the limit of the law, and we always
put down our advise in writing, so that later no one can point the finger
at us &quot;Hey, my lawyer said it was OK.&quot;  So US lawyers operate most of the
time as a big legal break on his client's aggressiveness.

I was in the heavy-dosed corporate world for some years and realized that
most US corporations are much more ethical than people realize.

Have a great day!

Hoanh

Subject: Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

Perhaps anh Hoanh can show how many times the FCPA have been used in court
since its inception.
Its real value is as a tool for U.S. businesses to sidestep &quot;requests&quot; for
&quot;payments&quot;.
Here's my own practical approach to thinking about corruption in general:
Companies, people will decide whether or not to engage in corruption based
on their own interests.
They will if the benefits outweight the costs and vice versa.

A set of anti-corruption laws must be in place.
A free and independent press plays the most important role in exposing
corruption.
A fair, competent, and independent court is necessary to prosecute
corruption.
Vietnam has the first element in place, the second element is partially in
place but still weak, and the third element still weaker.

In this context, Intel Vietnam's action is smart and logical:  it is
simply immunizing itself against corruption, witnessed by both the USG and
GVN.
This is much easier done for large multinational companies than for small
businessess.

Dear Brother Hoanh,

For what it's worth, I do think you are (to quote you) too
idealistic when it comes to corruption.  And what is wrong with it,
you might ask??  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!

We need more people like you Brother Hoanh.  Bravo!!

A couple of notable quotes on corruption you might enjoy,

The first sign of corruption in a society that is still alive is
that the end justifies the means. - Georges Bernanos

Among a people generally corrupt liberty cannot long exist. - Edmund
Burke

Thanks for letting me share and have a great day.

&gt; Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

&gt; [ Vietnam Business Forum ]

&gt; Dear Sister Bich Lien &amp; CACC,

&gt; You pose a wonderful question, sister.  Lucky for the students who
have
&gt; you as their teacher, Bich :Lien they will learn well!

&gt; &quot;There must be something else, a part from legislation and
individual
&gt; citizens, that make the system the way it did.  An open-ended
question, to
&gt; which I have no answer.&quot;  That is so true!  Bich Lien, I had that
question
&gt; when I was 17, and it followed me for several decades, and during
that
&gt; times, I searched for the answer in every thing under the sun; you
name
&gt; it, I have searched in it.

&gt; I have such a strong urge to share with you my long journey, but
to save
&gt; everyone's time, let me just share the final observation: The
missing
&gt; thing that sis. Bich Lien is looking for is &quot;the standard of
conduct that
&gt; the majority of the people demand. &quot;

&gt; If the majority of people demand the standard that their leaders
have to
&gt; be honest, that bribery is bad, then the country will have honest
leaders
&gt; and will have less corruption.  If the majority of people think
that their
&gt; leaders just have to be &quot;effective&quot; (whatever effective means)but
don't
&gt; have to be honest, and that corruption/bribery is an OK way to
live and to
&gt; do business, then the country will be marred with lying/cheating
leaders
&gt; and corruption will fill the scene.

&gt; Please note, I say &quot;majority of people.&quot; Sister Bich Lien said
there are
&gt; MANY good officials.  But many is not enough if that many is still
the
&gt; minority.

&gt; And I say &quot;standard of conduct,&quot; meaning, the character traits
that people
&gt; look up to and whoever achieves such characters will be admired by
most
&gt; people, the character traits that people want their leaders to
possess .
&gt; Standard is usually a bit idealistic, because standard is for &quot;the
best
&gt; scenario.&quot;  Say, the standard score for good student is the
perfect 10/10.
&gt;  But few students ever achieve this.  Most good students would get
9/10 or
&gt; 8/10 only.  However, everything being equal, the school that has
the 10/10
&gt; standard will produce much better students than the school that
sets 8/10
&gt; as its standard.

&gt; Most people in Vietnam think that paying and receiving bribes is
OK, it is
&gt; just a way to do things.  The majority of the people will not
stand up and
&gt; say that it is bad and that it must be stopped.  (Since 18 years
old in
&gt; college in Saigon, I have fought against most of my friends who
would
&gt; convinced me that corruption and bribery is the way to live and
that I am
&gt; just naive.  Imagine you hear this from 18 years old kids (who
were my
&gt; friends)!  Sad but true.  And today many people still tell me that
I am
&gt; too idealistic, that they don't need honest leaders, that they
believe
&gt; corruption is an OK or acceptable way to do business, or
corruption is
&gt; just a matter of semantic.

&gt; We will always disagree in many specific circumstances whether a
sentence
&gt; spoken is honest or not, or a specific gift or payment is indeed a
bribe.
&gt; Application of a rule to a specific case may raise disagreement
among
&gt; friends.  That is OK.  But at least, the majority of the people
have to
&gt; believe in the rule of honesty and the rule of clean business and
clean
&gt; government.  If we don't have the majority, the minority of good
people
&gt; won't be enough.

&gt; How to get that majority?  Simple, keep talking, keep preaching,
keep
&gt; teaching, and keep practicing honesty and cleanliness.  It is
hard,
&gt; because we all are human, and we all, including me, and especially
me,
&gt; fail often for our weaknesses, and we need to eat and pay bills
and feed
&gt; our children too.  I know.  But if we have faith in the ultimate
victory
&gt; of goodness, will stand up after each fall, and continue talking
about
&gt; honesty and clean governance again and again and again, time after
time
&gt; after time, regardless of what the negative people may say, then
&gt; eventually that majority will be achieved.

&gt; Trust me.  Have faith!

&gt; Have a great day, sis. Bich Lien and all.

So I

circle of

Vietnam who

citizens.  But
&gt; it's the fact that they are operating in a system that is known
for high
&gt; level of corruption.  The system has not been mature enough to
facilitate

well

FCPA,

Vietnam

be

I have

Dear brother Phong &amp; CACC,

I don't know if there is statistics about FCPA exists.  You can do the
research yourself to find that out.  I know that we lawyers treat it very
seriously.  ALL American international trade lawyers I met, without ONE
single exception, mention FCPA every time we discuss the potential of doing
business with Vietnam.  Many lawyers I know have decided to stay away from
Vietnam and counseled their clients to hold off on Vietnam ventures, citing
corruption and FCPA.  Others, like me, decided to do work in Vietnam while
staying faithful to FCPA regardless whether we could make a deal or not (In
fact, I told ALL my clients before agreeing to represent them on Vietnam
business issues that I do not do corruption and if they don't agree with
that position, I can't represent them).

If that is not serious treatment of the law, then what is?

About brother Phong's recommendation:

A set of anti-corruption laws must be in place.
A free and independent press plays the most important role in exposing
corruption.
A fair, competent, and independent court is necessary to prosecute
corruption

This is a reasonable recommendation, except by itself it won't work.  If the
free and independnet press is corrupt and the independent court is corrupt,
anti-corruption law doesn't help.  And that is precisely the South Vietnam's
pre-1975 experience.  I grew up pondering over that sorry experience every
day of  my college life.  And this is what sis Bich Lien said missing
besides legislation.

The law and the system, regardless of how well it is designed, won't help
much if the people in the system who runs the system is so corrupt.

Brother Andi talks about economic issue, yes it may be correct in some
cases.  But corruption has little to do with not making enough money.  Most
corrupt people have more money than they ever need (in the relative sense,
compared with others around them).  Just look around.

The entire issue has to do with ethics, the voluntary sense of right and
wrong in the people's heart.  A good law and good system doesn't hurt and
actually will help in many instances, but the foundation upon which the law
stands, the ethics, has to be strong.  As long as we don't realize that we
have to work on building a strong ethics foundation in the people, i.e.
making people believe in honesty, social responsibility, etc. then the law
can't do its job well.  (Unfortunately, many among us either disregard
ethics or even go so far as to say that ethics is not necessary in solving
governng issues.  Sad!)

Ethics, while having its own system of reward and punishment, has a lot to
do with voluntary human conduct.  Are we going to recongnize the deep
problem of our conduct or we simply want to work at things on the surface
like law and econ and system?  I am an economic lawyers, specialized in
economic litigation, so I love the law and econ.  But I also know their
limit when it comes to human conduct.  Things that start deep in the human
heart, surface system won't solve.

In that sense, Intel Vietnam's effort plays an incredibly big deal in
setting the ethical tone for Vietnam's business environment.  I predict that
many years from now, Intel Vietnam's memorandum on ethics today will be
mentioned as a milestone in Vietnam's business development in the mopdern
time.  Of course, this memorandum helps Intel do business easier, but that
self-interest doesn't take away its siginificant impact on Vietnam's
environment.

Have a great day!

Dear anh Hoanh,
The pre-75 South Vietnam experience is hardly a model of the rule of law
to spend too much time pondering over.  To the degree that any of the 3
elements I cited are in place (they weren't), they we simply overwhelmed
by the tremendous resources (money) that seemingly fell from the sky. I
don't know if we can say that the people then were more ethical, but the
rewards quickly outweight the risks.
Now consider Singapore.  Are the people there any more ethical than their
regional neighbors?  There are stories of law-abiding Singaporean citizens
going offshore to &quot;blow off steam&quot;.  Same person, different behaviors in
different environments.
Hence the rule of law.  That's how Mr. Lee and his colleague built, almost
overnight, the &quot;ethical foundation&quot; of Singaporean society.
The rule of law (not the same as just having lots of laws) controls those
who are tempted by corruption provides refuge for those who do not wish to
engage in corruption.
Back to Vietnam.
In pre-75 South Vietnam, many American military contractors actively or
indirectly contributed to corruption in a big way while pointing fingers
at the very people helped corrupt.  There were simply too much money
floating around.  And it's war time.  And it was pre FCPA.
I don't know what the lawyers for the chemical companies would have
advised on producing and supplying agent orange and other defoliants to
the U.S. military, knowing that dioxin is highly toxic and a carcinogent.
Perhaps they would say it's not illegal, but is it ethical?  Or perhaps
they just plead ignorance of chemistry!
I respect your idealism in building the &quot;voluntary sense of right and
wrong in people's heart&quot;.  I think it has always been there, albeit
greatly disillusioned.  Many a good communist cadres spent all their
youth, energy, and talent on building lofty ideals, including a society
free of corruption and exploitation.  Their sand castle lacked the
foundation of the rule of law and the protection of checks and balance,
and could not withstand the first challenges of the free market economy.
Best,  HPP

that many years from now, Intel Vietnam's memorandum on ethics today will
be mentioned as a milestone in Vietnam's business development in the
mopdern time.  Of course, this memorandum helps Intel do business easier,
but that self-interest doesn't take away its siginificant impact on
Vietnam's environment.

Have a great day!

Dear anh Hoanh,
You can't have it both ways claiming to be a heavy-dosed corporate lawyer
and saying that FCPA is not your expertise.
When a lawyer doesn't know some part of the law, he does research (or get
the paralegal to do it for him).
How many cases were successfully prosecuted?  You may also want to find
out  about FCPA's exceptions.
I am saying that FCPA is not a good law, it is great.  But I think we need
to be careful to match principle with action if we wish to avoid being
perceived as hypocrites.
&quot;Our lawyer told me so or our accountant told me&quot; so are not legal
defense.
Companies' main goal is to maximize profits.  Being careful not to run
afoul of the law does not deviate from that goal if being caught and
prosecuted hurt the bottom line.  Otherwise, if the penalty is light,
companies will make the conscious decision to brake law and pay the fines.
Its ethical when defined as rules and standards, but not moral principles
or values.

Dear Brother Phong &amp; CACC,

If you look around the world, most corrupt countries have all the elements
of a legal system in place, not just South Vietnam.  About Singapore, why
can't we think that the Singaporeans have a very good sense of ethics?  They
are very ethical to me, the way I observe.

But here is the real question:  I have no problem with building law and the
legal system and the economic system.  I have talked about these issues
since ever in this forum and else where.

But why do we have problem when I talk about ethics?  What is wrong with
being ethical?  In the US and around the world, we have codes of ethics for
lawyers, for doctors, for dentists, accountants, for engineers, for
architects, for real estate agents, for business, for all kinds of
professionals.

Why when talking about building ethics in Vietnam, do I sense such a strong
resistance to ethics.  Some people even have the intelligence to say that
ethics is not necessary. Are we really saying that ethics is not necessary
for a person, for a country?

It isn't law versus ethics.  The way I see it, it is law AND ethics.  What's
wrong with it?  What's wrong with being ethical?

(BTW, although I am idealistic, being ethical is not idealism as brother
Phong said.  It is absolutely practical.  Although I may have lost millions
of dollars by rejecting corrupt deals in Vietnam, I've built my
million-dollar company in the US by, among other things, relying heavily on
ethical practices and training my people to act honestly and ethically).

Have a great day!

&gt; Dear anh Hoanh,
&gt; The pre-75 South Vietnam experience is hardly a model of the rule of law
&gt; to spend too much time pondering over.  To the degree that any of the 3
&gt; elements I cited are in place (they weren't), they we simply overwhelmed by
&gt; the tremendous resources (money) that seemingly fell from the sky. I don't
&gt; know if we can say that the people then were more ethical, but the rewards
&gt; quickly outweight the risks.
&gt; Now consider Singapore.  Are the people there any more ethical than their
&gt; regional neighbors?  There are stories of law-abiding Singaporean citizens
&gt; going offshore to &quot;blow off steam&quot;.  Same person, different behaviors in
&gt; different environments.
&gt; Hence the rule of law.  That's how Mr. Lee and his colleague built, almost
&gt; overnight, the &quot;ethical foundation&quot; of Singaporean society.
&gt; The rule of law (not the same as just having lots of laws) controls those
&gt; who are tempted by corruption provides refuge for those who do not wish to
&gt; engage in corruption.
&gt; Back to Vietnam.
&gt; In pre-75 South Vietnam, many American military contractors actively or
&gt; indirectly contributed to corruption in a big way while pointing fingers at
&gt; the very people helped corrupt.  There were simply too much money floating
&gt; around.  And it's war time.  And it was pre FCPA.
&gt;  I don't know what the lawyers for the chemical companies would have
&gt; advised on producing and supplying agent orange and other defoliants to the
&gt; U.S. military, knowing that dioxin is highly toxic and a carcinogent.
&gt;  Perhaps they would say it's not illegal, but is it ethical?  Or perhaps
&gt; they just plead ignorance of chemistry!
&gt; I respect your idealism in building the &quot;voluntary sense of right and
&gt; wrong in people's heart&quot;.  I think it has always been there, albeit greatly
&gt; disillusioned.  Many a good communist cadres spent all their youth, energy,
&gt; and talent on building lofty ideals, including a society free of corruption
&gt; and exploitation.  Their sand castle lacked the foundation of the rule of
&gt; law and the protection of checks and balance, and could not withstand the
&gt; first challenges of the free market economy.
&gt; Best,  HPP

hóa đơn dịch vụ xe lăn 50 usd = tám trăm lẻ tám ngàn đồng

ÐƠN KIỆN HÃNG HÀNG KHÔNG PACIFIC AIRLINE

Kính gửi: Tòa án nhân dân quận Tân Bình, Tp Hồ Chí Minh.

Tôi tên là: Phạm Văn Tân là chồng của cô Nguyễn Hải Yến, khách hàng của

hãng hàng không Pacific Airline địa chỉ 112 Hồng Hà, P 2, Q Tân Bình, Tp

Hồ Chí Minh. Tôi xin gửi đơn kiện hãng này vì lý do như sau: Ngày 12 tháng

08 năm 2007 vợ và con gái tôi tham gia chuyến bay BL-792 từ Sài Gòn-Hà Nội

của pacific airline với giá vé 1.132.500VN và 210.000 cho con gái hơn 6

tháng tuổi được hãng này cho là giá rẻ. Nhưng khi đến giờ kiểm tra vé để

lên máy bay thì nhân viên hãng đã yêu cầu tôi trả thêm phí 50 đô la mĩ

(tương đương 808.000 đ – tám trăm lẻ tám ngàn đồng) cho dịch vụ xe lăn

(wheelchair) vì vợ tôi là người khuyết tật không tự leo cầu thang để lên

máy bay được. Qúa bất bình vì trước đó khi mua vé, nhân viên bán vé đã

không thông báo gì về điều này và bình thường thì ở hãng hàng không khác

(như Vietnam airline) dịch vụ này hoàn toàn miễn phí. Với khoản phí quá

đắt đó, nhưng tôi cũng đành phải trả phí này vì không còn cách nào khác

không tốn tiền để vợ mình có thể lên máy bay an toàn. Thế nhưng dù đã phải

trả phí cho dịch vụ xe lăn, nhưng vợ tôi chỉ được hưởng dịch vụ này ở cảng

Tân Sơn Nhất còn ở cảng Nội Bài-Hà Nội lại phải tự đi bằng nạng, không có

xe lăn phục vụ. Khi tôi gọi điện thắc mắc với nhân viên Pacific airline

thì chỉ được họ tư vấn về dịch vụ bay giá rẻ và các dịch vụ không được

miễn phí chứ không giải thích tại sao không phục vụ xe lăn như vợ tôi đã

phải thanh toán phí trước đó.

Với tư cách là khách hàng mà không được hưởng dịch vụ giá “cắt cổ” mà mình

đã phải trả. Tôi viết đơn này kính mong Tòa án nhân dân quận Tân Bình xem

xét yêu cầu Pacific Airline hoàn lại khoản tiền dịch vụ mà vợ tôi không

được hưởng, đền bù về mặt tinh thần và những rủi ro mà không được hưởng

dịch vụ đó có thể xảy ra theo đúng quy định của pháp luật.

Tôi xin chân thành cảm ơn quý tòa về sự quan tâm, xem xét giải quyết vụ

việc này!

lẽ ra phải miễn phí hoặc phải được báo trước. Nhưng rồi họ vẫn để tôi phải

chống nạng để đi dù đã phải trả tiền cho dịch vụ đó.

Dear HPP,

Personally, i'd just like to respectfully note, first, before Anh Hoanh
feels any need to reply, that as far as i know or would expect, neither this
list nor any member of it is a client of Anh Hoanh or his firm.  As such,
i'd suggest we cannot expect Anh Hoanh to perform any extra research or
assign any of this staff to perform such research for this list.

Second, IMHO, no lawyer today can be expected to know or remember the
content, histories, applications and exceptions of every law, even those he
or she encounters, and especially not those with which he or she has only
had limited, indirect contact, as Anh Hoanh had said was his experience with
the FCPA(?).

If Anh Hoanh chooses to spend any time at all either commenting on this
thread or doing any extra research to answer people's legal questions here,
it would purely be a sense and act of gracious charity.  He could not be
expected to do so out of any sense of obligation or responsibility to this
list or its members.

I hope that i haven't come across in this response as harsh.  I did not
intend to be.  And please pardon me if i misinterpreted your message below,
but i felt it was somewhat unfairly tried to impose an obligation on Anh
Hoanh that he has no need to feel.

If anything, i'd think anyone gaining any useful legal information from any
lawyer posting to this list should feel quite grateful, if not slightly
indebted to them for their &quot;pro bono&quot; contributions.  Aside from the
economic rationale i proposed earlier for today's high cost of consultative
time from lawyers in advanced nations, ie, to keep too much of that time
from being bought up by the extra-ordinary incomes of illicit economic
actors, obviously the sheer volume of laws and their contexts in advanced
nations will require a modern lawyer's time to be quite costly indeed if
their advice is to be both accurate and relatively comprehensive.

With sincerely warm regards,
Andi

&gt; Dear Brother Phong &amp; CACC,

&gt; FCPS is not my area of expertise so I can't tell how often it is enforced.
&gt;  But I have worked on the defense of a FCPS prosecution by the US
&gt; government.  Executives of a beer company of the US paid tons of money and
&gt; gifts to the generals of a Middle East country to have that country's army
&gt; buy their beer.  Later there was a fallout among the US executives and one
&gt; of the guys talked to the US government.  A major investigation and
&gt; prosecution followed.  I worked on the defense team.

&gt; The other thing is that in the US international trade conferences I
&gt; attended over the years, US companies usually complain that they cannot
&gt; compete overseas because other countries' companies are free to follow
&gt; &quot;local customs&quot; (concerning corruption), but US companies cannot do that
&gt; (But, US companies also know that the FCPS is supposed to help them compete
&gt; internationally by giving them the reputation of clean and ethical business
&gt; practices).  So, the FCPS effect on US companies is real.  It is not a
&gt; pretext for anything.

&gt; Another thing most people don't think about is that US companies rely very
&gt; heavily on lawyers in doing business.   And when they have a lawyer around,
&gt; the first thing they say when troubles happen is that &quot;Hey, I talked to our
&gt; lawyer over that, and he said it was OK.&quot;  So the lawyer is ALWAYS the first
&gt; scape goat.  Because of that, most US corporate lawyers are very careful in
&gt; advising client.  I was one of them.  We always stay on the safe side and
&gt; tell the client clearly what is illegal or illegal and tell them to stay
&gt; clearly within the limit of the law, and we always put down our advise in
&gt; writing, so that later no one can point the finger at us &quot;Hey, my lawyer
&gt; said it was OK.&quot;  So US lawyers operate most of the time as a big legal
&gt; break on his client's aggressiveness.

&gt; I was in the heavy-dosed corporate world for some years and realized that
&gt; most US corporations are much more ethical than people realize.

&gt; Have a great day!

&gt; Perhaps anh Hoanh can show how many times the FCPA have been used in court
&gt; since its inception.
&gt; Its real value is as a tool for U.S. businesses to sidestep &quot;requests&quot; for
&gt; &quot;payments&quot;.
&gt; Here's my own practical approach to thinking about corruption in general:
&gt; Companies, people will decide whether or not to engage in corruption based
&gt; on their own interests.
&gt; They will if the benefits outweight the costs and vice versa.

&gt; A set of anti-corruption laws must be in place.
&gt; A free and independent press plays the most important role in exposing
&gt; corruption.
&gt; A fair, competent, and independent court is necessary to prosecute
&gt; corruption.
&gt; Vietnam has the first element in place, the second element is partially in
&gt; place but still weak, and the third element still weaker.

&gt; In this context, Intel Vietnam's action is smart and logical:  it is
&gt; simply immunizing itself against corruption, witnessed by both the USG and
&gt; GVN.
&gt; This is much easier done for large multinational companies than for small
&gt; businessess.

Having a legal system in place is not the same as having the rule of law.
The rule of law, in short, is my quick answer to chi Lien's question.
The &quot;ultimate victory of goodness&quot; is a lofty goal on the order of the
&quot;from each according to his ability to each according to his needs&quot;, they
are great goals to aspire to but are unlikely to happen on a global scale
at this stage of human evolution.  If any force is poweful enough to try
to impose either, we end up with a theocracy or communism, each with their
attendant problems.
In corrupt countries that have laws, there are those in the ruling class
that consider themselves above the law, hence the is no rule of laws.
You wouldn't have had to argue with your friends if the rule of law was in
place and none one is operating outside or above it.
Singaporean have a good sense of ethics.  The question is where does that
sense of ethics came from.  My contention is the rule of law (that was and
is considered so draconian as to infringe on individual freedom/civil
liberty).  How do you explain the decidedly unethical behavior of some
Singaporeans when removed from Singaporean legal proper?  A sudden heart
replacement operation?  How do you explain ethical American companies
belly-aching  about how the FCPA limits them from being corrupted?
There is nothing wrong with being ethical.
The issue I have is when you discuss building ethics moralistic terms,
even confusing it with professional codes of ethics are being more than
the set of rules that they are.  I don't see that anyone in this forum is
resisting building ethics or contending that it is not important or
necessary.  I would be interested in seeing how you came to that
conclusion.  On the other hand, you had earlier confused the rule of law
with just a bunch of laws.
I am glad we agreed that being ethical in business is practical.
Logically, that means that we may not be/cannot afford to be ethical  in
business anymore when it is no longer practical.  In environments that do
not support being ethical, corruption is easily understood in this
context.  The solution is to fix the environment, ie, institute the rule
of law first.  Training the heart will then be much more practical and
doable because it doesn't conflict with the reality of survival, and can
be accomplished through general education.  Conversely, no amount of heart
training can overcome the forces of corruption when there is no rule of
law or respect for it.

overnight, the &quot;ethical foundation&quot; of Singaporean society.
The rule of law (not the same as just having lots of laws) controls those
who are tempted by corruption provides refuge for those who do not wish to
engage in corruption.
Back to Vietnam.
In pre-75 South Vietnam, many American military contractors actively or
indirectly contributed to corruption in a big way while pointing fingers
at the very people helped corrupt.  There were simply too much money
floating around.  And it's war time.  And it was pre FCPA.
I don't know what the lawyers for the chemical companies would have
advised on producing and supplying agent orange and other defoliants to
the U.S. military, knowing that dioxin is highly toxic and a carcinogent.
Perhaps they would say it's not illegal, but is it ethical?  Or perhaps
they just plead ignorance of chemistry!
I respect your idealism in building the &quot;voluntary sense of right and
wrong in people's heart&quot;.  I think it has always been there, albeit
greatly disillusioned.  Many a good communist cadres spent all their
youth, energy, and talent on building lofty ideals, including a society
free of corruption and exploitation.  Their sand castle lacked the
foundation of the rule of law and the protection of checks and balance,
and could not withstand the first challenges of the free market economy.
Best,  HPP

Dear Ho`a,

Thanks for the quotes.  Partly because i'm an unrepentant if guilt-ridden
Anglophone i'd never heard Georges Bernanos.  Edmund Burke, i'd suspect, is
rather widely known.  In case anyone might be curious of Bernanos'
background, here's a link: http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/bernanos.htm

&gt; &gt; Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

&gt; &gt; [ Vietnam Business Forum ]

&gt; &gt; Dear Sister Bich Lien &amp; CACC,

&gt; &gt; You pose a wonderful question, sister.  Lucky for the students who
&gt; have
&gt; &gt; you as their teacher, Bich :Lien they will learn well!

&gt; &gt; &quot;There must be something else, a part from legislation and
&gt; individual
&gt; &gt; citizens, that make the system the way it did.  An open-ended
&gt; question, to
&gt; &gt; which I have no answer.&quot;  That is so true!  Bich Lien, I had that
&gt; question
&gt; &gt; when I was 17, and it followed me for several decades, and during
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; times, I searched for the answer in every thing under the sun; you
&gt; name
&gt; &gt; it, I have searched in it.

&gt; &gt; I have such a strong urge to share with you my long journey, but
&gt; to save
&gt; &gt; everyone's time, let me just share the final observation: The
&gt; missing
&gt; &gt; thing that sis. Bich Lien is looking for is &quot;the standard of
&gt; conduct that
&gt; &gt; the majority of the people demand. &quot;

&gt; &gt; If the majority of people demand the standard that their leaders
&gt; have to
&gt; &gt; be honest, that bribery is bad, then the country will have honest
&gt; leaders
&gt; &gt; and will have less corruption.  If the majority of people think
&gt; that their
&gt; &gt; leaders just have to be &quot;effective&quot; (whatever effective means)but
&gt; don't
&gt; &gt; have to be honest, and that corruption/bribery is an OK way to
&gt; live and to
&gt; &gt; do business, then the country will be marred with lying/cheating
&gt; leaders
&gt; &gt; and corruption will fill the scene.

&gt; &gt; Please note, I say &quot;majority of people.&quot; Sister Bich Lien said
&gt; there are
&gt; &gt; MANY good officials.  But many is not enough if that many is still
&gt; the
&gt; &gt; minority.

&gt; &gt; And I say &quot;standard of conduct,&quot; meaning, the character traits
&gt; that people
&gt; &gt; look up to and whoever achieves such characters will be admired by
&gt; most
&gt; &gt; people, the character traits that people want their leaders to
&gt; possess .
&gt; &gt; Standard is usually a bit idealistic, because standard is for &quot;the
&gt; best
&gt; &gt; scenario.&quot;  Say, the standard score for good student is the
&gt; perfect 10/10.
&gt; &gt;  But few students ever achieve this.  Most good students would get
&gt; 9/10 or
&gt; &gt; 8/10 only.  However, everything being equal, the school that has
&gt; the 10/10
&gt; &gt; standard will produce much better students than the school that
&gt; sets 8/10
&gt; &gt; as its standard.

&gt; &gt; Most people in Vietnam think that paying and receiving bribes is
&gt; OK, it is
&gt; &gt; just a way to do things.  The majority of the people will not
&gt; stand up and
&gt; &gt; say that it is bad and that it must be stopped.  (Since 18 years
&gt; old in
&gt; &gt; college in Saigon, I have fought against most of my friends who
&gt; would
&gt; &gt; convinced me that corruption and bribery is the way to live and
&gt; that I am
&gt; &gt; just naive.  Imagine you hear this from 18 years old kids (who
&gt; were my
&gt; &gt; friends)!  Sad but true.  And today many people still tell me that
&gt; I am
&gt; &gt; too idealistic, that they don't need honest leaders, that they
&gt; believe
&gt; &gt; corruption is an OK or acceptable way to do business, or
&gt; corruption is
&gt; &gt; just a matter of semantic.

&gt; &gt; We will always disagree in many specific circumstances whether a
&gt; sentence
&gt; &gt; spoken is honest or not, or a specific gift or payment is indeed a
&gt; bribe.
&gt; &gt; Application of a rule to a specific case may raise disagreement
&gt; among
&gt; &gt; friends.  That is OK.  But at least, the majority of the people
&gt; have to
&gt; &gt; believe in the rule of honesty and the rule of clean business and
&gt; clean
&gt; &gt; government.  If we don't have the majority, the minority of good
&gt; people
&gt; &gt; won't be enough.

&gt; &gt; How to get that majority?  Simple, keep talking, keep preaching,
&gt; keep
&gt; &gt; teaching, and keep practicing honesty and cleanliness.  It is
&gt; hard,
&gt; &gt; because we all are human, and we all, including me, and especially
&gt; me,
&gt; &gt; fail often for our weaknesses, and we need to eat and pay bills
&gt; and feed
&gt; &gt; our children too.  I know.  But if we have faith in the ultimate
&gt; victory
&gt; &gt; of goodness, will stand up after each fall, and continue talking
&gt; about
&gt; &gt; honesty and clean governance again and again and again, time after
&gt; time
&gt; &gt; after time, regardless of what the negative people may say, then
&gt; &gt; eventually that majority will be achieved.

&gt; &gt; Trust me.  Have faith!

&gt; &gt; Have a great day, sis. Bich Lien and all.

&gt; &gt; it's the fact that they are operating in a system that is known

&gt; be
&gt; &gt; something else, apart from legislation, and individual citizens,
&gt; that
&gt; &gt; makes the system the way it is.  An open-ended question, to which

Dear brother Phong &amp; CACC,

Let's try to clarify this issue by being practical.

I agree to follow brother Phong's logics:  Our people are so corrupt, we
need ruole of law.  But for the rule of law to operate well, we need
non-corrupt people to operate the law.  So we are in the chicken-and-egg
circle.  Where do you, brother Phong, find non-corrupt people?

My solution is:  We find non-corrupt people thourgh promoting ethics, such
as the Intel Vietnam's memorandum, we need to teach ethics in universities
(for all kinds of professional students, including business students), we
need to promote ethic teaching in families (where parents train children to
be honest and socially responsible) or in churches and temples or mass
organizations like Thanh Doan or Hoi Phu Nu.  We need to bring ethics to the
forefront to produce good people, and good people will start good rule of
law.

Where do you  find non-corrupt people to start your rule of law, brother
Phong, or anyone?  I love to hear an answer.

Have a great day!

Hoanh

&gt; Having a legal system in place is not the same as having the rule of law.
&gt; The rule of law, in short, is my quick answer to chi Lien's question.
&gt; The &quot;ultimate victory of goodness&quot; is a lofty goal on the order of the
&gt; &quot;from each according to his ability to each according to his needs&quot;, they
&gt; are great goals to aspire to but are unlikely to happen on a global scale at
&gt; this stage of human evolution.  If any force is poweful enough to try to
&gt; impose either, we end up with a theocracy or communism, each with their
&gt; attendant problems.
&gt; In corrupt countries that have laws, there are those in the ruling class
&gt; that consider themselves above the law, hence the is no rule of laws.
&gt; You wouldn't have had to argue with your friends if the rule of law was in
&gt; place and none one is operating outside or above it.
&gt; Singaporean have a good sense of ethics.  The question is where does that
&gt; sense of ethics came from.  My contention is the rule of law (that was and
&gt; is considered so draconian as to infringe on individual freedom/civil
&gt; liberty).  How do you explain the decidedly unethical behavior of some
&gt; Singaporeans when removed from Singaporean legal proper?  A sudden heart
&gt; replacement operation?  How do you explain ethical American companies
&gt; belly-aching  about how the FCPA limits them from being corrupted?
&gt; There is nothing wrong with being ethical.
&gt; The issue I have is when you discuss building ethics moralistic terms,
&gt; even confusing it with professional codes of ethics are being more than the
&gt; set of rules that they are.  I don't see that anyone in this forum is
&gt; resisting building ethics or contending that it is not important or
&gt; necessary.  I would be interested in seeing how you came to that conclusion.
&gt;  On the other hand, you had earlier confused the rule of law with just a
&gt; bunch of laws.
&gt; I am glad we agreed that being ethical in business is practical.
&gt;  Logically, that means that we may not be/cannot afford to be ethical  in
&gt; business anymore when it is no longer practical.  In environments that do
&gt; not support being ethical, corruption is easily understood in this context.
&gt;  The solution is to fix the environment, ie, institute the rule of law
&gt; first.  Training the heart will then be much more practical and doable
&gt; because it doesn't conflict with the reality of survival, and can be
&gt; accomplished through general education.  Conversely, no amount of heart
&gt; training can overcome the forces of corruption when there is no rule of law
&gt; or respect for it.

Whew!  I'm obviously having trouble keeping up with this thread.  It seems
several nerves have been touched.  Good sign...  ;)

Anh Hoanh, i'd like to note that i tried to choose my words quite carefully
and talked of what we might practically expect, of tendencies and relative
human responses of majorities to economic stimuli, like (holistic) relative
prices, costs and net benefits (ie, &quot;economic profits&quot;), rather than
specific examples of the isolated actions or motivations of individuals or
fringe groups, good and bad.

With that background set, i'd like to respond that i think that, in
principal, neither ethics nor economics absolutely precedes or rules over
the other.  They go hand in hand together, both influencing and responding
to the other, simultaneously, in real-time, so to speak.

And (as i think it is more accurate to portray chi Lien's post mentioning
ethics) even highly ethical people can all too often be seen being coerced
into submitting to survival tactics they do not particularly approve of, by
their economic situations.  Just as reasonably, the more economically lucky
and ethical among us can be expected to primarily sympathize or empathize
with them yet not follow their ways as models for our own.

One relative wealth or power, versus either others or one's past, doesn't
seem to change common behaviors much, as super-rich exist in both more
ethical and unethical circles and most actors in both still generally seem
to keep seeking even more power or wealth.

Of course, ethics are essential and have primacy.  But they, quite naturally
and necessarily, share those qualities with other influences upon us, not
the least of which are our economic circumstances.  Trade-offs, compromises
should, must and will be rationally or &quot;practically&quot; almost always be made,
almost everywhere.

But i wholeheartedly agree that, where feasible, an ethical solution almost
always provide greater *holistic* net benefits (ie, &quot;economic
profit&lt; http://www.pinkmonkey.com/studyguides/subjects/eco/chap9/e0909301.asp &gt;&quot;
accounting for even &quot;opportunity
costs&lt; http://www.pinkmonkey.com/studyguides/subjects/eco/chap9/e0909301.asp &gt;&quot;)
than an unethical solution will provide.

That said, i'd again like to shift focus back to the context of all this.

Before he went to Heaven early this year ( ;)), Kurt Vonnegut, Jr (who i
know i fall back on too much ;)) wrote, &quot;Susan Sontag and Arthur Miller, In
These Times.  Of Sontag, he said:
News &gt; March 3, 2005By Kurt
Vonnegut&lt; http://www.inthesetimes.com/about/author/86 &gt;

&lt; http://www.newsvine.com/_tools/seed&amp;save;?u=http://www.inthesetimes.co... &gt;

She did get off one sound bite in an interview on television, which was to
me a stunning sermon in and of itself. She was asked what she had learned
from the Holocaust, and she said that 10 percent of any population is cruel,
no matter what, and that 10 percent is merciful, no matter what, and that
the remaining 80 percent could be moved in either direction.
That, in a nutshell, seems to me to be one of the most compelling reasons
why &quot;leaders&quot; exist, are used and are wanted or needed by the vast majority
of peoples, anywhere, anytime.  (But, watch out, that also seems to be both
an observation of and argument for inevitable elitism. ;))

But please note a similarity of those proportions, 10:80:10, to a basic
observation and assumption, and a consequent application of mathematics as
statistics regarding populations in general: ie, the Normal Distribution and
Bell Curve, respectively.

It's seems it might well be quite normal (even rational) that some &quot;80
percent could be moved in either direction&quot; and the good and bad elites(?)
-- the &quot;natural&quot; leaders on average? -- should expect and include that fact
in their strategic designs if they want to attain their social goals, good
or bad.

It even seems, to me, that, yet again, it is much more than coincidental
that these relationships seem to fit together so well:

- Âm | Yin | Passive Negation(?) | Demand | Bad(?)
- Dương | Yang | Active Affirmation(?) | Good(?)
- Đạo | Tao | A Way | A *Dynamical* Instance of a &quot;General
Equilibrium&quot; | Better(?) -- for the moment or circumstances at hand.

So how do ethics fit into these dynamics?  Seems to me they'd be a part with
a higher priority and primacy, a part that would ride on our inherent and
ingrained emotions or inner feelings and impulses about things we meet, and
that they'll largely result in diverse autonomic or reasoned responses both
over time and across peoples.  The autonomic responses likely can be
continually retrained and the reasoned responses will best adapt over time
to the actor's environment and feedback on the ongoing retraining of each
actors' emotional responses.

Can i reasonably agree with your core proposition that, &quot;The entire issue
has to do with ethics&quot;?  Yes.  But it almost equally has to do with economic
circumstances and responses, too.

A population's responses, however, seem to &quot;normally&quot; be distributed quite
consistently over the long run, &quot;by the end of which we're all dead&quot;, to
paraphrase Keynes.

In the shorter, more practical term of here and now (of &quot;disequilibria&quot;
being regularly corrected and recurring) some 80 percent of folks must
accept and respond rationally to their socio-economic circumstances,
including their moral mindset (in the broader Buddhist sense of mind being
both emotions and thoughts) -- &quot;socio-economics&quot; being, notably, a sub-set
of the broader &quot;economics&quot;.  Sometimes ethics can or will and should
prevail.  Too often, that just isn't be feasible.

To me at least, economic conditions, primarily &quot;skewed&quot; distributions of
income, seem to be the most predominant factor impeding most folks wishes to
act according to their ethics.

In parting, in case anyone wonders, here a some quotes i'd choose for this
post from the many more at &quot;Value Quotes - Quotations on value, values,
virtues and ethics - from Socrates to Hsi-Tang, from Genesis 1:1 to The
Dalai Lama, from Warren Buffett to George W. Bush&lt; http://www.valuequotes.net/ &gt;
&quot;:

Treating people with respect will gain one wide acceptance and improve the
business. -- Tao Zhu Gong 500 B.C., Assistant to the Emperor of Yue, 2nd
Business Principle

In making judgments, the Early Kings were perfect, because they made moral
principles the starting point of all their undertakings and the root of
everything that was beneficial. This principle, however, is something that
persons of mediocre intellect never grasp. Not grasping it, they lack
awareness, and lacking awareness, they pursue profit. But while they pursue
profit, it is absolutely impossible for them to be certain of attaining it.
-- Lü Bu-wei 246 B.C., Chinese Prime Minister under Emperor Ying Zheng, The
Annals of Lü Bu-wei, Lu Shi Chun Qiu

Out of 5.8 billion people in the world, the majority of them are certainly
not believers in Buddhism. We can't argue with them, tell them they should
be believers. No! Impossible! And, realistically speaking, if the majority
of humanity remain nonbelievers, it doesn't matter. No problem! The problem
is that the majority have lost, or ignore, the deeper human values -
compassion, a sense of responsibility. That is our big concern. -- The Dalai
Lama in Time, December 1997

[Personally, i usually think i'm lost in the that majority, maybe 80 percent
of my time.  ;)  C'est la vie.  &quot;What, me worry?&quot; ;) -- ADM]

And just for you, Anh Hoanh:

Personal leadership is the process of keeping your vision and values before
you and aligning your life to be congruent with them. -- Stephen Covey,
American leadership consultant and writer

For the newer generations, a predictions i hope have time to come true while
we're still freely Internetworked worldwide -- and before our older
generations finish off our feasible Environment for acting &quot;normally&quot; ;) --
a quote that reminds of a book excerpt recently read about the leadership of
Virgin's Richard Branson, at India's Express Computer Weekly, &quot;Don't lead
sheep, herd cats&quot;&lt; http://www.expresscomputeronline.com/20070813/technologylife02.shtml &gt;:

Executives will have to invest more and more on issues such as culture,
values, ethos and intangibles. Instead of managers, they need to be
cultivators and storytellers to capture minds. -- Leif Edvinsson, pioneer on
Intellectual Capital in Corporate Longitude 2002

And for this post's author's own amusement:

In God we trust, all others bring data. -- Dr. W. Edwards Deming 1900-1993,
American Statistician

Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants. --
Epicurus 341  B.C.-270  B.C., ancient Greek philosopher, father of hedonism

&gt; Dear brother Phong &amp; CACC,

&gt; I don't know if there is statistics about FCPA exists.  You can do the
&gt; research yourself to find that out.  I know that we lawyers treat it very
&gt; seriously.  ALL American international trade lawyers I met, without ONE
&gt; single exception, mention FCPA every time we discuss the potential of doing
&gt; business with Vietnam.  Many lawyers I know have decided to stay away from
&gt; Vietnam and counseled their clients to hold off on Vietnam ventures, citing
&gt; corruption and FCPA.  Others, like me, decided to do work in Vietnam while
&gt; staying faithful to FCPA regardless whether we could make a deal or not (In
&gt; fact, I told ALL my clients before agreeing to represent them on Vietnam
&gt; business issues that I do not do corruption and if they don't agree with
&gt; that position, I can't represent them).

&gt; If that is not serious treatment of the law, then what is?

&gt; About brother Phong's recommendation:

&gt; A set of anti-corruption laws must be in place.
&gt; A free and independent press plays the most important role in exposing
&gt; corruption.

Oops.  Forgot the link to &quot;Susan Sontag and Arthur Miller&quot;, In These Times:
http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/1999/

And, more importantly, i forgot to insert &quot;Supply&quot; into &quot;Dương | Yang |
Active Affirmation(?) | Good(?)&quot; to construct:

- Âm | Yin | Passive Negation(?) | Demand | Bad(?)
- Dương | Yang | Active Affirmation(?) | Supply | Good(?)
- Đạo | Tao | A Way | A *Dynamic* Instance of a &quot;General Equilibrium&quot;
| Better(?) -- for the moment or circumstances at hand.

Just in case anyone noticed... :D

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Whew!  I'm obviously having trouble keeping up with this thread.  It seems
&gt; several nerves have been touched.  Good sign...  ;)

&gt; Anh Hoanh, i'd like to note that i tried to choose my words quite
&gt; carefully and talked of what we might practically expect, of tendencies and
&gt; relative human responses of majorities to economic stimuli, like (holistic)
&gt; relative prices, costs and net benefits (ie, &quot;economic profits&quot;), rather
&gt; than specific examples of the isolated actions or motivations of individuals
&gt; or fringe groups, good and bad.

&gt; With that background set, i'd like to respond that i think that, in
&gt; principal, neither ethics nor economics absolutely precedes or rules over
&gt; the other.  They go hand in hand together, both influencing and responding
&gt; to the other, simultaneously, in real-time, so to speak.

&gt; And (as i think it is more accurate to portray chi Lien's post mentioning
&gt; ethics) even highly ethical people can all too often be seen being coerced
&gt; into submitting to survival tactics they do not particularly approve of, by
&gt; their economic situations.  Just as reasonably, the more economically lucky
&gt; and ethical among us can be expected to primarily sympathize or empathize
&gt; with them yet not follow their ways as models for our own.

&gt; One relative wealth or power, versus either others or one's past, doesn't
&gt; seem to change common behaviors much, as super-rich exist in both more
&gt; ethical and unethical circles and most actors in both still generally seem
&gt; to keep seeking even more power or wealth.

&gt; Of course, ethics are essential and have primacy.  But they, quite
&gt; naturally and necessarily, share those qualities with other influences upon
&gt; us, not the least of which are our economic circumstances.  Trade-offs,
&gt; compromises should, must and will be rationally or &quot;practically&quot; almost
&gt; always be made, almost everywhere.

&gt; But i wholeheartedly agree that, where feasible, an ethical solution
&gt; almost always provide greater *holistic* net benefits (ie, &quot; economic
&gt; profit&lt; http://www.pinkmonkey.com/studyguides/subjects/eco/chap9/e0909301.asp &gt;&quot;
&gt; accounting for even &quot;opportunity costs&lt; http://www.pinkmonkey.com/studyguides/subjects/eco/chap9/e0909301.asp &gt;&quot;)
&gt; than an unethical solution will provide.

&gt; That said, i'd again like to shift focus back to the context of all this.

&gt; Before he went to Heaven early this year ( ;)), Kurt Vonnegut, Jr (who i
&gt; know i fall back on too much ;)) wrote, &quot;Susan Sontag and Arthur Miller, In
&gt; These Times.  Of Sontag, he said:
&gt; News &gt; March 3, 2005By Kurt Vonnegut&lt; http://www.inthesetimes.com/about/author/86 &gt;
&gt;  **

&gt; &lt; http://www.newsvine.com/_tools/seed&amp;save;?u=http://www.inthesetimes.co... &gt;

&gt; She did get off one sound bite in an interview on television, which was to
&gt; me a stunning sermon in and of itself. She was asked what she had learned
&gt; from the Holocaust, and she said that 10 percent of any population is cruel,
&gt; no matter what, and that 10 percent is merciful, no matter what, and that
&gt; the remaining 80 percent could be moved in either direction.
&gt; That, in a nutshell, seems to me to be one of the most compelling reasons
&gt; why &quot;leaders&quot; exist, are used and are wanted or needed by the vast majority
&gt; of peoples, anywhere, anytime.  (But, watch out, that also seems to be both
&gt; an observation of and argument for inevitable elitism. ;))

&gt; But please note a similarity of those proportions, 10:80:10, to a basic
&gt; observation and assumption, and a consequent application of mathematics as
&gt; statistics regarding populations in general: ie, the Normal Distribution and
&gt; Bell Curve, respectively.

&gt; It's seems it might well be quite normal (even rational) that some &quot;80
&gt; percent could be moved in either direction&quot; and the good and bad elites(?)
&gt; -- the &quot;natural&quot; leaders on average? -- should expect and include that fact
&gt; in their strategic designs if they want to attain their social goals, good
&gt; or bad.

&gt; It even seems, to me, that, yet again, it is much more than coincidental
&gt; that these relationships seem to fit together so well:

&gt;    - Âm | Yin | Passive Negation(?) | Demand | Bad(?)
&gt;    - Dương | Yang | Active Affirmation(?) | Good(?)
&gt;    - Đạo | Tao | A Way | A *Dynamical* Instance of a &quot;General
&gt;    Equilibrium&quot; | Better(?) -- for the moment or circumstances at hand.

&gt; So how do ethics fit into these dynamics?  Seems to me they'd be a part
&gt; with a higher priority and primacy, a part that would ride on our inherent
&gt; and ingrained emotions or inner feelings and impulses about things we meet,
&gt; and that they'll largely result in diverse autonomic or reasoned responses
&gt; both over time and across peoples.  The autonomic responses likely can be
&gt; continually retrained and the reasoned responses will best adapt over time
&gt; to the actor's environment and feedback on the ongoing retraining of each
&gt; actors' emotional responses.

&gt; Can i reasonably agree with your core proposition that, &quot;The entire issue
&gt; has to do with ethics&quot;?  Yes.  But it almost equally has to do with economic
&gt; circumstances and responses, too.

&gt; A population's responses, however, seem to &quot;normally&quot; be distributed quite
&gt; consistently over the long run, &quot;by the end of which we're all dead&quot;, to
&gt; paraphrase Keynes.

&gt; In the shorter, more practical term of here and now (of &quot;disequilibria&quot;
&gt; being regularly corrected and recurring) some 80 percent of folks must
&gt; accept and respond rationally to their socio-economic circumstances,
&gt; including their moral mindset (in the broader Buddhist sense of mind being
&gt; both emotions and thoughts) -- &quot;socio-economics&quot; being, notably, a sub-set
&gt; of the broader &quot;economics&quot;.  Sometimes ethics can or will and should
&gt; prevail.  Too often, that just isn't be feasible.

&gt; To me at least, economic conditions, primarily &quot;skewed&quot; distributions of
&gt; income, seem to be the most predominant factor impeding most folks wishes to
&gt; act according to their ethics.

&gt; In parting, in case anyone wonders, here a some quotes i'd choose for this
&gt; post from the many more at &quot; Value Quotes - Quotations on value, values,
&gt; virtues and ethics - from Socrates to Hsi-Tang, from Genesis 1:1 to The
&gt; Dalai Lama, from Warren Buffett to George W. Bush&lt; http://www.valuequotes.net/ &gt;
&gt; &quot;:

&gt; Treating people with respect will gain one wide acceptance and improve the
&gt; business. -- Tao Zhu Gong 500 B.C., Assistant to the Emperor of Yue, 2nd
&gt; Business Principle

&gt; In making judgments, the Early Kings were perfect, because they made moral
&gt; principles the starting point of all their undertakings and the root of
&gt; everything that was beneficial. This principle, however, is something that
&gt; persons of mediocre intellect never grasp. Not grasping it, they lack
&gt; awareness, and lacking awareness, they pursue profit. But while they pursue
&gt; profit, it is absolutely impossible for them to be certain of attaining it.
&gt; -- Lü Bu-wei 246 B.C., Chinese Prime Minister under Emperor Ying Zheng,
&gt; The Annals of Lü Bu-wei, Lu Shi Chun Qiu

&gt; Out of 5.8 billion people in the world, the majority of them are certainly
&gt; not believers in Buddhism. We can't argue with them, tell them they should
&gt; be believers. No! Impossible! And, realistically speaking, if the majority
&gt; of humanity remain nonbelievers, it doesn't matter. No problem! The problem
&gt; is that the majority have lost, or ignore, the deeper human values -
&gt; compassion, a sense of responsibility. That is our big concern. -- The Dalai
&gt; Lama in Time, December 1997

&gt; [Personally, i usually think i'm lost in the that majority, maybe 80
&gt; percent of my time.  ;)  C'est la vie.  &quot;What, me worry?&quot; ;) -- ADM]

&gt; And just for you, Anh Hoanh:

&gt; Personal leadership is the process of keeping your vision and values
&gt; before you and aligning your life to be congruent with them. -- Stephen
&gt; Covey, American leadership consultant and writer

&gt; For the newer generations, a predictions i hope have time to come true
&gt; while we're still freely Internetworked worldwide -- and before our older
&gt; generations finish off our feasible Environment for acting &quot;normally&quot; ;) --
&gt; a quote that reminds of a book excerpt recently read about the leadership of
&gt; Virgin's Richard Branson, at India's Express Computer Weekly, &quot;Don't lead
&gt; sheep, herd cats&quot;&lt; http://www.expresscomputeronline.com/20070813/technologylife02.shtml &gt;:

&gt; Executives will have to invest more and more on issues such as culture,
&gt; values, ethos and intangibles. Instead of managers, they need to be
&gt; cultivators and storytellers to capture minds. -- Leif Edvinsson, pioneer on
&gt; Intellectual Capital in Corporate Longitude 2002

&gt; And for this post's author's own amusement:

&gt; In God we trust, all others bring data. -- Dr. W. Edwards Deming
&gt; 1900-1993, American Statistician

&gt; Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.

Bro' Phong,

Again it seems you anticipated much of what i wrote before i finished it --
and so much more concisely [dang it...]  :D

I'd even agree with you that, given Singapore's pre-colonial, colonial and
post-colonial history, the subject of a Discovery Channel series,
Singaporeans are as much an ethical product of the rules a minority of the
most powerful Singaporeans and others imposed.  Singapore is not much of a
democracy.   The death penalty for many mere vices is not the popular choice
of an ethically extremist population.  And, as is often seen here in
SighGone, Sin-a-pore-ians can sin as well as the both the best and worst of
us.  ;)

But, of the question of &quot;which practically comes first: ethics or laws?&quot;,
i'd have to agree with Brother Hoanh that a legal infrastructure must
generally be built upon a culture's popular ethics at some specific point in
that culture's evolution.  Then, both will evolve hand in hand.

I only add that the economics of that particular point in that culture's
history will almost equally influence the decisions of both legislative
leaders and those who enforce the laws, and, that, again, the relationship
between the three, ethics, economics and the Law, becomes a dynamically
evolving (ie, PROgressing) system of the simultaneously symbiotic,
interdependent &quot;three&quot;, as soon as the first laws are created.

And, now, i'll dare add that, over the long term, this PROgressive evolution
(a redundancy) seems to happen whether we consciously try to achieve it or
not, and, that the net quality of the actions of the actors, good or bad,
and the resulting benefits and costs each enjoys or suffers all end up being
distributed roughly as they &quot;normally&quot; have been throughout our natural
history, something like 10:80:10=good:ambivalent:bad, forever and ever.
And, near the End, most people finally find out they had never had any
choice but to begin and keep up living their lives under such an equation,
&quot;no matter what&quot; -- dang nab it!  ;D

Let the flame wars ensue.  I'm outa here. ;))  Have fun!

Best wishes, later,
AD

&gt; Dear brother Phong &amp; CACC,

&gt; Let's try to clarify this issue by being practical.

&gt; I agree to follow brother Phong's logics:  Our people are so corrupt, we
&gt; need ruole of law.  But for the rule of law to operate well, we need
&gt; non-corrupt people to operate the law.  So we are in the chicken-and-egg
&gt; circle.  Where do you, brother Phong, find non-corrupt people?

&gt; My solution is:  We find non-corrupt people thourgh promoting ethics, such
&gt; as the Intel Vietnam's memorandum, we need to teach ethics in universities
&gt; (for all kinds of professional students, including business students), we
&gt; need to promote ethic teaching in families (where parents train children to
&gt; be honest and socially responsible) or in churches and temples or mass
&gt; organizations like Thanh Doan or Hoi Phu Nu.  We need to bring ethics to the
&gt; forefront to produce good people, and good people will start good rule of
&gt; law.

&gt; Where do you  find non-corrupt people to start your rule of law, brother
&gt; Phong, or anyone?  I love to hear an answer.

&gt; Have a great day!

&gt; &gt; Having a legal system in place is not the same as having the rule of

&gt; &gt; The rule of law, in short, is my quick answer to chi Lien's question.
&gt; &gt; The &quot;ultimate victory of goodness&quot; is a lofty goal on the order of the
&gt; &gt; &quot;from each according to his ability to each according to his needs&quot;, they
&gt; &gt; are great goals to aspire to but are unlikely to happen on a global scale at
&gt; &gt; this stage of human evolution.  If any force is poweful enough to try to
&gt; &gt; impose either, we end up with a theocracy or communism, each with their
&gt; &gt; attendant problems.
&gt; &gt; In corrupt countries that have laws, there are those in the ruling class
&gt; &gt; that consider themselves above the law, hence the is no rule of laws.
&gt; &gt; You wouldn't have had to argue with your friends if the rule of law was
&gt; &gt; in place and none one is operating outside or above it.
&gt; &gt; Singaporean have a good sense of ethics.  The question is where does
&gt; &gt; that sense of ethics came from.  My contention is the rule of law (that was
&gt; &gt; and is considered so draconian as to infringe on individual freedom/civil
&gt; &gt; liberty).  How do you explain the decidedly unethical behavior of some
&gt; &gt; Singaporeans when removed from Singaporean legal proper?  A sudden heart
&gt; &gt; replacement operation?  How do you explain ethical American companies
&gt; &gt; belly-aching  about how the FCPA limits them from being corrupted?
&gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong with being ethical.
&gt; &gt; The issue I have is when you discuss building ethics moralistic terms,
&gt; &gt; even confusing it with professional codes of ethics are being more than the
&gt; &gt; set of rules that they are.  I don't see that anyone in this forum is
&gt; &gt; resisting building ethics or contending that it is not important or
&gt; &gt; necessary.  I would be interested in seeing how you came to that conclusion.
&gt; &gt;  On the other hand, you had earlier confused the rule of law with just a
&gt; &gt; bunch of laws.
&gt; &gt; I am glad we agreed that being ethical in business is practical.
&gt; &gt;  Logically, that means that we may not be/cannot afford to be ethical  in
&gt; &gt; business anymore when it is no longer practical.  In environments that do
&gt; &gt; not support being ethical, corruption is easily understood in this context.
&gt; &gt;  The solution is to fix the environment, ie, institute the rule of law
&gt; &gt; first.  Training the heart will then be much more practical and doable
&gt; &gt; because it doesn't conflict with the reality of survival, and can be
&gt; &gt; accomplished through general education.  Conversely, no amount of heart
&gt; &gt; training can overcome the forces of corruption when there is no rule of law
&gt; &gt; or respect for it.

Last post, for now.  Promise...  ;D

Of yet another extremely coincidental, if not fateful ratio, from
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle:

The *Pareto principle* (also known as the *80-20 rule*, the *law of the
vital few* and the *principle of factor sparsity*) states that, for many
events, 80% of the effects comes from 20% of the causes. Business management
thinker Joseph M.
Juran&lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Joseph_Moses_Juran &gt;suggested
the principle and named it after Italian economist Vilfredo
Pareto &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto &gt;, who observed that 80%
of income in Italy went to 20% of the population. It is a common rule of
thumb &lt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb &gt; in business; e.g., &quot;80%
of your sales comes from 20% of your clients.&quot;

Pls allow some additional thoughts/observations:

1.      Yes, no arguments whatsoever about the essentiality of ethics.  But,
in order to look further into the issue of how ethics work/contribute to
economic/social development of a developing country like Vietnam,
economic/legal perception and analysis would be useful.  Further to Anh
Andi's economic analysis, I'd recommend a book called &quot;Law and Economic in
Developing Countries&quot;, published by the Hoover Institution, that includes
some interesting economic analysis of systematic official corruption.  The
approach taken here, in my view, is very sensible because it attempts to
examine the complex relationship between law, governance, and
economic/social development instead of single out one particular
factor/area.  And more importantly, such relationship is put into the
context of developing countries.

2.      Agree with Anh Phong 's point re. the rule of law.  But a country
like Vietnam will need a long long march towards the rule of law.  To reach
this goal, we all will need to work very hard, and I'd love to see the
system improved before I die. In the current context, Intel move is indeed
smart and deserves to be applauded.  Hopefully, we'll see more examples like
this in the future.  I'm not attempting, however, to judge/categorize
whether Intel's action/intention is practical or ethical - only Intel policy
makers know it.  Anh Hoanh lost a large deal in Vietnam, but was deservedly
compensated other deals IN THE US.  I dearly hope that, the same thing would
happen to an ethical lawyer IN VIETNAM.

3.      As personal experience of being a lawyer to a number of Singaporean
business clients, the common question that I was asked is how to get a deal
done in the legal/bureaucratic environment of Vietnam (that included some
very direct questions).  Again, I have no personal judgment of whether they
are more (or less) ethical than Americans, Europeans, Australians or other
Asians doing business in Vietnam.

4.      Re. legal vs. ethics, the case of chemical companies is a perfect
example.

5.      Teaching ethics to people is a great idea.  Anh Hoanh may be
interested to know that it is in fact mentioned in a Party's resolution on
judicial/legal reform.

Dear brother Phong &amp; CACC,

Let's try to clarify this issue by being practical.

I agree to follow brother Phong's logics:  Our people are so corrupt, we
need ruole of law.  But for the rule of law to operate well, we need
non-corrupt people to operate the law.  So we are in the chicken-and-egg
circle.  Where do you, brother Phong, find non-corrupt people?

My solution is:  We find non-corrupt people thourgh promoting ethics, such
as the Intel Vietnam's memorandum, we need to teach ethics in universities
(for all kinds of professional students, including business students), we
need to promote ethic teaching in families (where parents train children to
be honest and socially responsible) or in churches and temples or mass
organizations like Thanh Doan or Hoi Phu Nu.  We need to bring ethics to the
forefront to produce good people, and good people will start good rule of
law.

Where do you  find non-corrupt people to start your rule of law, brother
Phong, or anyone?  I love to hear an answer.

Have a great day!

Hoanh

Having a legal system in place is not the same as having the rule of law.
The rule of law, in short, is my quick answer to chi Lien's question.
The &quot;ultimate victory of goodness&quot; is a lofty goal on the order of the &quot;from
each according to his ability to each according to his needs&quot;, they are
great goals to aspire to but are unlikely to happen on a global scale at
this stage of human evolution.  If any force is poweful enough to try to
impose either, we end up with a theocracy or communism, each with their
attendant problems.
In corrupt countries that have laws, there are those in the ruling class
that consider themselves above the law, hence the is no rule of laws.
You wouldn't have had to argue with your friends if the rule of law was in
place and none one is operating outside or above it.
Singaporean have a good sense of ethics.  The question is where does that
sense of ethics came from.  My contention is the rule of law (that was and
is considered so draconian as to infringe on individual freedom/civil
liberty).  How do you explain the decidedly unethical behavior of some
Singaporeans when removed from Singaporean legal proper?  A sudden heart
replacement operation?  How do you explain ethical American companies
belly-aching  about how the FCPA limits them from being corrupted?
There is nothing wrong with being ethical.
The issue I have is when you discuss building ethics moralistic terms, even
confusing it with professional codes of ethics are being more than the set
of rules that they are.  I don't see that anyone in this forum is resisting
building ethics or contending that it is not important or necessary.  I
would be interested in seeing how you came to that conclusion.  On the other
hand, you had earlier confused the rule of law with just a bunch of laws.
I am glad we agreed that being ethical in business is practical.  Logically,
that means that we may not be/cannot afford to be ethical  in business
anymore when it is no longer practical.  In environments that do not support
being ethical, corruption is easily understood in this context.  The
solution is to fix the environment, ie, institute the rule of law first.
Training the heart will then be much more practical and doable because it
doesn't conflict with the reality of survival, and can be accomplished
through general education.  Conversely, no amount of heart training can
overcome the forces of corruption when there is no rule of law or respect
for it.

Dear Andi,
Thanks for your note, it is not too harsh.  Thanks also for your
compliments.
It was silly of me to ask anh Hoanh to do extra research.  It's just that
I am not a lawyer so I need to use the lawyer's facility to make the
argument more solid.
On the other hand, the &quot;grease money&quot; exception is fairly well known and
is the FCPA's acceptance of local conditions.

Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

[ Vietnam Business Forum ]

Dear HPP,

Personally, i'd just like to respectfully note, first, before Anh Hoanh
feels any need to reply, that as far as i know or would expect, neither
this list nor any member of it is a client of Anh Hoanh or his firm.  As
such, i'd suggest we cannot expect Anh Hoanh to perform any extra research
or assign any of this staff to perform such research for this list.

Second, IMHO, no lawyer today can be expected to know or remember the
content, histories, applications and exceptions of every law, even those
he or she encounters, and especially not those with which he or she has
only had limited, indirect contact, as Anh Hoanh had said was his
experience with the FCPA(?).

If Anh Hoanh chooses to spend any time at all either commenting on this
thread or doing any extra research to answer people's legal questions
here, it would purely be a sense and act of gracious charity.  He could
not be expected to do so out of any sense of obligation or responsibility
to this list or its members.

I hope that i haven't come across in this response as harsh.  I did not
intend to be.  And please pardon me if i misinterpreted your message
below, but i felt it was somewhat unfairly tried to impose an obligation
on Anh Hoanh that he has no need to feel.

If anything, i'd think anyone gaining any useful legal information from
any lawyer posting to this list should feel quite grateful, if not
slightly indebted to them for their &quot;pro bono&quot; contributions.  Aside from
the economic rationale i proposed earlier for today's high cost of
consultative time from lawyers in advanced nations, ie, to keep too much
of that time from being bought up by the extra-ordinary incomes of illicit
economic actors, obviously the sheer volume of laws and their contexts in
advanced nations will require a modern lawyer's time to be quite costly
indeed if their advice is to be both accurate and relatively
comprehensive.

With sincerely warm regards,
Andi

Dear anh Hoanh,
You can't have it both ways claiming to be a heavy-dosed corporate lawyer
and saying that FCPA is not your expertise.
When a lawyer doesn't know some part of the law, he does research (or get
the paralegal to do it for him).
How many cases were successfully prosecuted?  You may also want to find
out  about FCPA's exceptions.
I am saying that FCPA is not a good law, it is great.  But I think we need
to be careful to match principle with action if we wish to avoid being
perceived as hypocrites.
&quot;Our lawyer told me so or our accountant told me&quot; so are not legal
defense.
Companies' main goal is to maximize profits.  Being careful not to run
afoul of the law does not deviate from that goal if being caught and
prosecuted hurt the bottom line.  Otherwise, if the penalty is light,
companies will make the conscious decision to brake law and pay the fines.
Its ethical when defined as rules and standards, but not moral principles
or values.

Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

[ Vietnam Business Forum ]

Dear Brother Phong &amp; CACC,

FCPS is not my area of expertise so I can't tell how often it is enforced.
But I have worked on the defense of a FCPS prosecution by the US
government.  Executives of a beer company of the US paid tons of money and
gifts to the generals of a Middle East country to have that country's army
buy their beer.  Later there was a fallout among the US executives and one
of the guys talked to the US government.  A major investigation and
prosecution followed.  I worked on the defense team.

The other thing is that in the US international trade conferences I
attended over the years, US companies usually complain that they cannot
compete overseas because other countries' companies are free to follow
&quot;local customs&quot; (concerning corruption), but US companies cannot do that
(But, US companies also know that the FCPS is supposed to help them
compete internationally by giving them the reputation of clean and ethical
business practices).  So, the FCPS effect on US companies is real.  It is
not a pretext for anything.

Another thing most people don't think about is that US companies rely very
heavily on lawyers in doing business.   And when they have a lawyer
around, the first thing they say when troubles happen is that &quot;Hey, I
talked to our lawyer over that, and he said it was OK.&quot;  So the lawyer is
ALWAYS the first scape goat.  Because of that, most US corporate lawyers
are very careful in advising client.  I was one of them.  We always stay
on the safe side and tell the client clearly what is illegal or illegal
and tell them to stay clearly within the limit of the law, and we always
put down our advise in writing, so that later no one can point the finger
at us &quot;Hey, my lawyer said it was OK.&quot;  So US lawyers operate most of the
time as a big legal break on his client's aggressiveness.

I was in the heavy-dosed corporate world for some years and realized that
most US corporations are much more ethical than people realize.

Have a great day!

Hoanh

Subject: Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

Perhaps anh Hoanh can show how many times the FCPA have been used in court
since its inception.
Its real value is as a tool for U.S. businesses to sidestep &quot;requests&quot; for
&quot;payments&quot;.
Here's my own practical approach to thinking about corruption in general:
Companies, people will decide whether or not to engage in corruption based
on their own interests.
They will if the benefits outweight the costs and vice versa.

A set of anti-corruption laws must be in place.
A free and independent press plays the most important role in exposing
corruption.
A fair, competent, and independent court is necessary to prosecute
corruption.
Vietnam has the first element in place, the second element is partially in
place but still weak, and the third element still weaker.

In this context, Intel Vietnam's action is smart and logical:  it is
simply immunizing itself against corruption, witnessed by both the USG and
GVN.
This is much easier done for large multinational companies than for small
businessess.

Hello chi. Lien,
The work on the rule of law has already begun in Vietnam and is proceeding
well.
It has a decidedly economic feel to it because that's where it's the least
controversial/most fast-acting.  Most visible are the changes associated
with implementing the U.S.-Vietnam BTA and WTO accession.  It will take
time, but hopefully not a lifetime.
An example of how quickly it can be established, besides Singapore, is
Japan Post WW2 where even the constitution was imposed.
Obviously, that would not work for Vietnam today because of important
issues such as sovereignty.  That Intel took the lead in establishing
something like the rule of law for itself should be a wake up call for the
government, who should by right be the lead actor here.
Best,  HPP

Dear anh Hoanh,
I would like to restate for clarification:  We need the rule of law so our
people don't have to be corrupt.
The chicken-and-egg circle you proposed is a false assumption.
Where do I find non-corrupt people?
The majority of the people are corrupt or non-corrupt based on the
system/environment they find themselves in.
Few are inherently corrupt or non-corrupt; few are incorruptible.  This is
a variation of the Pareto principle anh Andi mentioned.
They are all the same people.  I earlier mentioned the Singaporean and the
communist cadres as examples.
Given a choice, most would prefer to make their gains ethically and
legally.  It makes for better sleep at night and better looking at
yourself in the mirror experience in the morning.
There is a great thirst for the rule of law in Vietnam, both from those
who seek to protect their new gains, whether ill-gotten or well-gained,
and from those who seek a refuge from the abuse of those with political
power (the dispossessed peasants, for example).  Good governance/corporate
governance seminars are always well attended.
I would not wait to find non-corrupt people to start the rule of law, it's
a non-starter not supported by recent history.  The only examples close to
it date back to the feudal system, where the virtuous ruler is the
critical ingredient to good reign.  But the ruler in such a benevolent
monarchy is still above the law, as we learned in the tragedy of King
Arthur.  People at that stage of human/political evolution must have been
incredibly puzzled and frustrated by their dilemna.  So they searched for
different models and came up with different ideas some of which evolved
into what we think of as democracy today.  At least people don't have to
puzzle about whether the horse or the cart should come first (until they
invented the automobile that can pull a horse trailer :))
BTW, the egg comes before the chicken.
(Either one would be good right now because I had no lunch!)

not support being ethical, corruption is easily understood in this
context.  The solution is to fix the environment, ie, institute the rule
of law first.  Training the heart will then be much more practical and
doable because it doesn't conflict with the reality of survival, and can
be accomplished through general education.  Conversely, no amount of heart
training can overcome the forces of corruption when there is no rule of
law or respect for it.

Dear CACC,

I think I have made my points fairly clear for now.  No need for me to
repeat it.  In this message, I'd just like to synthesize some points made by
various brothers/sisters, hoping that it does reflect some degree of
consensus among us (and maybe some degree of non-consensus as well) and make
things clearer and less confusing for many folks who have followed this
thread, especially the younger students who take a primary place in my
heart.

1.  Obviously we all agree that every thing--law, economics, ethics--works
together in a comprehensive system, nothing should be excluded.  Good!

My problem here is that when we talk about law and economics, the discussion
would go well, but as soon as we talk about ethics, there would inevitably
be opposition from some corner. Why?  I don't understand it.  In fact if we
look around, ethics plays such an important role in raising up good
citizens and building up our society, but ethics teachings is very skimpy.
Other than your parents when you are little and your teachers in primary
school, who is teaching ethics, where?  I am glad that the VCP sees the
importance of teaching ethics, as chi Bich Lien mentions.  But, sorry folks,
that is still lip service.  Where is ethics being taught in Vietnam?  Is
there a course of ethics anywhere?  I have mentioned ethics teaching at
universities for business students for a decade, in this forum and other
places, and do we have one ethics course in Vietnam yet?

2.  Of course, the level of economic well being of the population may have
something to do with ethics.  We Vietnamese says, &quot;Co thuc moi vuc duoc dao&quot;
(You have to eat in order to save ethics).   And in Vietnam's current
development, we often say that as the economy advances, the legal system
will work better and the government will become cleaner and more ethical.
That is generally the evolution process (to use brother  Andi's
terminology) in which everything goes hand in hand toward a higher level.

However, generally I try not to talk about economics when discussing
corruption, because a number of potential issues:

a.  The economy advances very slowly.  We need immediate solutions for
corruption.  For immediate solutions, law and ethics work much faster.

b.  The causal relationship between economic advancement and improvement in
ethics is unclear.  What is the cause and what is the effect?  Does economic
advancement cause ethic improvement, or does ethic improvement cause
economic advancement?  In other words, (1) you are ethical and your ethics
helps you make a lot of money, or (2) you make a lot of money while still
unethical and your money helps you become ethical later?  I think,
intuitively many of us may agree with the first scenario.  My experience in
management is that ethics helps my company makes money.  And I haven't seen
an unethical company becomes ethical after it makes a lot of money.

c.  The statements &quot;As the economy advances, people become more ethical,&quot;
although
accepted by most of us as the truth, may carry with it a racist
and discriminatory tone if we think hard about it.

It basically says that the poorer you are the less ethical you are.  This is
a very condescending attitude that may not have any truth in it.  There is
nothing to say that the farmers in the countryside, who are poorer and in a
less developed area than the city dwellers, are less ethical than city
dwellers. Indeed I think that most farmers are more ethical than city
dwellers.  And there is nothing to prove that people of Vietnam, who are
poorer than the American, are less ethical than the American.

So, when we say &quot;as the economy advances, people become less corrupt (or
more ethical),&quot; we really talk about the standards of business and
government practices SET BY ADVANCED NATIONS.  That's fine, when you are
poorer and work in the same marketplace as the very rich guys, you have to
follow the rich's standards.  That is life.  So &quot;The poorer you are, the
more corrupt you are&quot; is a statement from the rich guy's point of view and
rich guy's standards.  Fine, with me.  As I say, in a market, the poor guy
has to follow the rich guy's standards.  But I don't like that
discriminatory and condescending and potentially racist tone.
If we use Vietnamese ethical standards to measure the advanced nations, then
the advanced nations may not be so ethical either.

d.  Economic advancement may have something to do with the conduct of the
general population, but obviously it has nothing to do with the truly
corrupt people.  Truly corrupt people will engage in all kinds of unethical
conduct regardless of how much power or money they have.

For the above reasons, while I generally agree that economic advancement
does have relationship with ethics, I don't think economics is very
beneficial when discussing a solution for corruption.

I hope this summary helps.  Have a great day, everyone.  Great discussion.

&gt;    to economic/social development of a developing country like Vietnam,
&gt;    economic/legal perception and analysis would be useful.  Further to Anh

&gt;    Developing Countries&quot;, published by the Hoover Institution, that includes
&gt;    some interesting economic analysis of systematic official corruption.  The
&gt;    approach taken here, in my view, is very sensible because it attempts to
&gt;    examine the complex relationship between law, governance, and
&gt;    economic/social development instead of single out one particular
&gt;    factor/area.  And more importantly, such relationship is put into the
&gt;    context of developing countries.

&gt;    1. Agree with Anh Phong 's point re. the rule of law.  But a country
&gt;    like Vietnam will need a long long march towards the rule of law.  To reach
&gt;    this goal, we all will need to work very hard, and I'd love to see the
&gt;    system improved before I die. In the current context, Intel move is indeed
&gt;    smart and deserves to be applauded.  Hopefully, we'll see more examples like
&gt;    this in the future.  I'm not attempting, however, to judge/categorize
&gt;    whether Intel's action/intention is practical or ethical - only Intel policy
&gt;    makers know it.  Anh Hoanh lost a large deal in Vietnam, but was deservedly
&gt;    compensated other deals IN THE US.  I dearly hope that, the same thing would
&gt;    happen to an ethical lawyer IN VIETNAM.

&gt;    1. As personal experience of being a lawyer to a number of
&gt;    Singaporean business clients, the common question that I was asked is how to
&gt;    get a deal done in the legal/bureaucratic environment of Vietnam (that
&gt;    included some very direct questions).  Again, I have no personal judgment of
&gt;    whether they are more (or less) ethical than Americans, Europeans,
&gt;    Australians or other Asians doing business in Vietnam.

&gt;    1. Re. legal vs. ethics, the case of chemical companies is a perfect
&gt;    example.

&gt;    1. Teaching ethics to people is a great idea.  Anh Hoanh may be
&gt;    interested to know that it is in fact mentioned in a Party's resolution on
&gt;    judicial/legal reform.

Dear anh Hoanh, chi. Lien:
1.  Frankly, I am mystified by your insistence that anyone in this forum
is opposed to ethics.  I only saw questioning of your proposition that
ethics has to be the precondition to everything else.
Ethics is being taught in schools everywhere in Vietnam.  &quot;Tien Hoc Le,
Hau Hoc Van&quot; is all the walls of every school.  It is still alive and well
in popular sayings, writtings, radio and television programing.  But it
remains at the theoretical level.  Parents and teachers probably realized
that it is impractical to take it to the applied level given the reality
of the rule of law, or the lack of it.  You have the option of couselling
your client not to operate in an unfavorable/unprotected environment.
People living there don't have that option.  Earlier the C. Party's
approach to maintaining ethics among its members was to prohibit them from
doing business.  It forgot that they were still in the powerful position
of regulating business.  Thus developed the husband-and-wife business
model.  Without a good rule of law in place, teaching business ethics is
like teaching the art of raising orchids in winter in Canada without a
heated greenhouse!
2.a  I don't see how you can discuss corruption with out also talking
about economics.
2.c  I don't see anything racist about the statement.  You forgot about
their separate and different environments when comparing farmers with
urban dwellers.  Take a poor country girl into the city and the chance of
corrupting her increased exponentially.  Take a powerful cadres to the
countryside and the chance of his taking someone else's land for his own
also increased.  Neither places have the rule of law.  On the other hand,
take an average Vietnamese immigrant used to the &quot;freedom&quot; on peeing in
the street with impunity and masterful at dodging taxes and put him in an
environment where he can work hard to grow his business and he will soon
build a big house with more bathrooms than bedrooms that he will not risk
loosing to the IRS (tax department).  Ethically, he is the same man.  &quot;
“tao muon lam nguoi tu te, nhung ai cho tao lam nguoi tu te” (I want to be
a good person, but who allows me to do that?)&quot;  Chi. Lien, we can answer
Nam Cao's question by changing just one word:  not &quot;who&quot; but &quot;what&quot;.  This
will also provide answers to the many honest official and cadres.  We
cannot take this line of logic too far in this forum for it will take us
into areas that can not be discussed here.
2.d  I respectfully disagree.  Just because some people will always be
corrupt is no reason for not linking economics with corruption.
Best,  HPP

All:

Have not really been follwoing the thread too deeply but in pre-industrial
societies, in traditional economies, culture tends to be the basis of each
countries legal system. Culture has been the driving force of each countries
ethical and legal values. As countries advance in participating in the
international trading system then much of their business ethics and legal
system becomes subsumed to (transformed by) the treaties, agreements, and
conventions that facilitate freer trade; each countries laws become altered
by these new agreements which are essentially law themselves. So, where
countries choose to participate in these international institutions, in
theory, they choose to relinquish some sovereignty and to have their values
altered by their participation.  Of course in practice it might be
different, and surely time is required for material changes.

AD, as to the logic with which, in previous threads, you had dispelled the
place the US had played in presenting laws at the international level that
discouraged corrupt business practices I feel that you may have pieced
together a series of disjointed facts that did little but inflame and
nothing to support the case as to your premise.  I say this despite agreeing
with your position re Bush-Iraq-Halliburton. Of course the monetary value of
Iraqui oil, in total reserves, not simply yearly production, is but a small
fraction of the money expended by the US in support of this conflict. I find
it curious that you looked at Transparency International's &quot;perception&quot;
index when they create half a dozen different measures on issues related to
transparency.  I wonder if that might have been purposeful on your part.
Anyway, I tend to think we may share many similar opinions but as always, I
tend to take my own beliefs, as others, with a grain of salt, and am vey
hesitant to call them truth's as similarly in the past with the whole
Gorbachev-Reagon-Clinton debate. I tend to believe in the concept of
Satsang, which means to &quot;be in the company of truth&quot; rather than falsely,
and only mentally, occupying that space.  Too often our dogma becomes our
truth where we fight, from vanity and ego, to assure it remains there; in
both our own minds and in the minds of others with whom we are dialoguing.

Good Day All

&gt; Bro' Phong,

&gt; Again it seems you anticipated much of what i wrote before i finished it
&gt; -- and so much more concisely [dang it...]  :D

&gt; I'd even agree with you that, given Singapore's pre-colonial, colonial and
&gt; post-colonial history, the subject of a Discovery Channel series,
&gt; Singaporeans are as much an ethical product of the rules a minority of the
&gt; most powerful Singaporeans and others imposed.  Singapore is not much of a
&gt; democracy.   The death penalty for many mere vices is not the popular choice
&gt; of an ethically extremist population.  And, as is often seen here in
&gt; SighGone, Sin-a-pore-ians can sin as well as the both the best and worst of
&gt; us.  ;)

&gt; But, of the question of &quot;which practically comes first: ethics or laws?&quot;,
&gt; i'd have to agree with Brother Hoanh that a legal infrastructure must
&gt; generally be built upon a culture's popular ethics at some specific point in
&gt; that culture's evolution.  Then, both will evolve hand in hand.

&gt; I only add that the economics of that particular point in that culture's
&gt; history will almost equally influence the decisions of both legislative
&gt; leaders and those who enforce the laws, and, that, again, the relationship
&gt; between the three, ethics, economics and the Law, becomes a dynamically
&gt; evolving (ie, PROgressing) system of the simultaneously symbiotic,
&gt; interdependent &quot;three&quot;, as soon as the first laws are created.

&gt; And, now, i'll dare add that, over the long term, this PROgressive
&gt; evolution (a redundancy) seems to happen whether we consciously try to
&gt; achieve it or not, and, that the net quality of the actions of the actors,
&gt; good or bad, and the resulting benefits and costs each enjoys or suffers all
&gt; end up being distributed roughly as they &quot;normally&quot; have been throughout our
&gt; natural history, something like 10:80:10=good:ambivalent:bad, forever and
&gt; ever.  And, near the End, most people finally find out they had never had
&gt; any choice but to begin and keep up living their lives under such an
&gt; equation, &quot;no matter what&quot; -- dang nab it!  ;D

&gt; Let the flame wars ensue.  I'm outa here. ;))  Have fun!

&gt; Best wishes, later,

&gt; &gt; Dear brother Phong &amp; CACC,

&gt; &gt; Let's try to clarify this issue by being practical.

&gt; &gt; I agree to follow brother Phong's logics:  Our people are so corrupt, we
&gt; &gt; need ruole of law.  But for the rule of law to operate well, we need
&gt; &gt; non-corrupt people to operate the law.  So we are in the chicken-and-egg
&gt; &gt; circle.  Where do you, brother Phong, find non-corrupt people?

&gt; &gt; My solution is:  We find non-corrupt people thourgh promoting ethics,
&gt; &gt; such as the Intel Vietnam's memorandum, we need to teach ethics in
&gt; &gt; universities (for all kinds of professional students, including business
&gt; &gt; students), we need to promote ethic teaching in families (where parents
&gt; &gt; train children to be honest and socially responsible) or in churches and
&gt; &gt; temples or mass organizations like Thanh Doan or Hoi Phu Nu.  We need to
&gt; &gt; bring ethics to the forefront to produce good people, and good people will
&gt; &gt; start good rule of law.

&gt; &gt; Where do you  find non-corrupt people to start your rule of law, brother
&gt; &gt; Phong, or anyone?  I love to hear an answer.

&gt; &gt; Have a great day!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Having a legal system in place is not the same as having the rule of
&gt; &gt; &gt; law.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The rule of law, in short, is my quick answer to chi Lien's question.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The &quot;ultimate victory of goodness&quot; is a lofty goal on the order of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;from each according to his ability to each according to his needs&quot;, they
&gt; &gt; &gt; are great goals to aspire to but are unlikely to happen on a global scale at
&gt; &gt; &gt; this stage of human evolution.  If any force is poweful enough to try to
&gt; &gt; &gt; impose either, we end up with a theocracy or communism, each with their
&gt; &gt; &gt; attendant problems.
&gt; &gt; &gt; In corrupt countries that have laws, there are those in the ruling
&gt; &gt; &gt; class that consider themselves above the law, hence the is no rule of laws.
&gt; &gt; &gt; You wouldn't have had to argue with your friends if the rule of law
&gt; &gt; &gt; was in place and none one is operating outside or above it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Singaporean have a good sense of ethics.  The question is where does
&gt; &gt; &gt; that sense of ethics came from.  My contention is the rule of law (that was
&gt; &gt; &gt; and is considered so draconian as to infringe on individual freedom/civil
&gt; &gt; &gt; liberty).  How do you explain the decidedly unethical behavior of some
&gt; &gt; &gt; Singaporeans when removed from Singaporean legal proper?  A sudden heart
&gt; &gt; &gt; replacement operation?  How do you explain ethical American companies
&gt; &gt; &gt; belly-aching  about how the FCPA limits them from being corrupted?
&gt; &gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong with being ethical.
&gt; &gt; &gt; The issue I have is when you discuss building ethics moralistic terms,
&gt; &gt; &gt; even confusing it with professional codes of ethics are being more than the
&gt; &gt; &gt; set of rules that they are.  I don't see that anyone in this forum is
&gt; &gt; &gt; resisting building ethics or contending that it is not important or
&gt; &gt; &gt; necessary.  I would be interested in seeing how you came to that conclusion.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  On the other hand, you had earlier confused the rule of law with just a
&gt; &gt; &gt; bunch of laws.
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am glad we agreed that being ethical in business is practical.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Logically, that means that we may not be/cannot afford to be ethical  in
&gt; &gt; &gt; business anymore when it is no longer practical.  In environments that do
&gt; &gt; &gt; not support being ethical, corruption is easily understood in this context.
&gt; &gt; &gt;  The solution is to fix the environment, ie, institute the rule of law
&gt; &gt; &gt; first.  Training the heart will then be much more practical and doable
&gt; &gt; &gt; because it doesn't conflict with the reality of survival, and can be
&gt; &gt; &gt; accomplished through general education.  Conversely, no amount of heart
&gt; &gt; &gt; training can overcome the forces of corruption when there is no rule of law
&gt; &gt; &gt; or respect for it.

1.      Anh Phong: Please do not misinterpret me with the &quot;insistence that
anyone in this forum is opposed to ethics&quot; - that would be the last thing
coming to mind my.   My statement in the previous message was merely a
response/confirmation to A. Hoanh's question of &quot;what's wrong to be
ethical&quot;?  My other arguments are, in fact, an attempt to answer your
modified Nam Cao's question: what allows one [Vietnamese] to become a good
person.

2.      Anh Hoanh: As I said, ethics teaching is designed as one of the
solutions for legal/judicial reform in Vietnam.  The Judicial Academy has
been teaching &quot;dao duc nghe luat&quot; (legal ethics) for future judges, lawyers,
public procurators and other legal professionals. Understandably, it's still
brief, theoretical at the moment.  But they are working to develop a more
comprehensive course on legal ethics with an attempt for practical
application (pls save me from getting into details here).

3.      Anh Phong, I can well understand your position that &quot;Without a good
rule of law in place, teaching business ethics is like teaching the art of
raising orchids in winter in Canada without a heated greenhouse&quot;, but we
cannot wait until a good rule of law exits in Vietnam to teach ethics for
legal professionals.  The teaching might be impractical in the early stage
(when codes of conduct for lawyers/judges have not been properly formed),
but with external assistance/support that could be a channel where the ideas
flow into the system.  You may want to agree with me that there are
different forces that pull/push/ and shape reform.  I'm on your side with
the statement that &quot;the work on the rule of law has already begun in Vietnam
and is proceeding [relatively] well&quot;.  Changes are visible when they are to
serve economic development.   But bearing in mind that the largely imported
commercial legislative framework (WTO/BTA ect) may well focus on reflecting
the interests of elite-business, leaving behind small-scale domestic
entrepreneurs, and other vulnerable groups without being listened. In
addition, a good rule of law system needs an efficient, independent court.
As one of the workers in this business, I'll try to stay optimistic/hopeful
that the development process could take less than a life time.

My last message here.

Great day to all!

Subject: Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

Dear anh Hoanh, chi. Lien:
1.  Frankly, I am mystified by your insistence that anyone in this forum is
opposed to ethics.  I only saw questioning of your proposition that ethics
has to be the precondition to everything else.
Ethics is being taught in schools everywhere in Vietnam.  &quot;Tien Hoc Le, Hau
Hoc Van&quot; is all the walls of every school.  It is still alive and well in
popular sayings, writtings, radio and television programing.  But it remains
at the theoretical level.  Parents and teachers probably realized that it is
impractical to take it to the applied level given the reality of the rule of
law, or the lack of it.  You have the option of couselling your client not
to operate in an unfavorable/unprotected environment.  People living there
don't have that option.  Earlier the C. Party's approach to maintaining
ethics among its members was to prohibit them from doing business.  It
forgot that they were still in the powerful position of regulating business.
Thus developed the husband-and-wife business model.  Without a good rule of
law in place, teaching business ethics is like teaching the art of raising
orchids in winter in Canada without a heated greenhouse!
2.a  I don't see how you can discuss corruption with out also talking about
economics.
2.c  I don't see anything racist about the statement.  You forgot about
their separate and different environments when comparing farmers with urban
dwellers.  Take a poor country girl into the city and the chance of
corrupting her increased exponentially.  Take a powerful cadres to the
countryside and the chance of his taking someone else's land for his own
also increased.  Neither places have the rule of law.  On the other hand,
take an average Vietnamese immigrant used to the &quot;freedom&quot; on peeing in the
street with impunity and masterful at dodging taxes and put him in an
environment where he can work hard to grow his business and he will soon
build a big house with more bathrooms than bedrooms that he will not risk
loosing to the IRS (tax department).  Ethically, he is the same man.  &quot;b tao
muon lam nguoi tu te, nhung ai cho tao lam nguoi tu teb (I want to be a good
person, but who allows me to do that?)&quot;  Chi. Lien, we can answer Nam Cao's
question by changing just one word:  not &quot;who&quot; but &quot;what&quot;.  This will also
provide answers to the many honest official and cadres.  We cannot take this
line of logic too far in this forum for it will take us into areas that can
not be discussed here.
2.d  I respectfully disagree.  Just because some people will always be
corrupt is no reason for not linking economics with corruption.
Best,  HPP

Re: [Vnbiz] Intel Vietnam refuses to pay bribes

[ Vietnam Business Forum ]

Dear CACC,

I think I have made my points fairly clear for now.  No need for me to
repeat it.  In this message, I'd just like to synthesize some points made by
various brothers/sisters, hoping that it does reflect some degree of
consensus among us (and maybe some degree of non-consensus as well) and make
things clearer and less confusing for many folks who have followed this
thread, especially the younger students who take a primary place in my
heart.

1.  Obviously we all agree that every thing--law, economics, ethics--works
together in a comprehensive system, nothing should be excluded.  Good!

My problem here is that when we talk about law and economics, the discussion
would go well, but as soon as we talk about ethics, there would inevitably
be opposition from some corner. Why?  I don't understand it.  In fact if we
look around, ethics plays such an important role in raising up good citizens
and building up our society, but ethics teachings is very skimpy.  Other
than your parents when you are little and your teachers in primary school,
who is teaching ethics, where?  I am glad that the VCP sees the importance
of teaching ethics, as chi Bich Lien mentions.  But, sorry folks, that is
still lip service.  Where is ethics being taught in Vietnam?  Is there a
course of ethics anywhere?  I have mentioned ethics teaching at universities
for business students for a decade, in this forum and other places, and do
we have one ethics course in Vietnam yet?

2.  Of course, the level of economic well being of the population may have
something to do with ethics.  We Vietnamese says, &quot;Co thuc moi vuc duoc dao&quot;
(You have to eat in order to save ethics).   And in Vietnam's current
development, we often say that as the economy advances, the legal system
will work better and the government will become cleaner and more ethical.
That is generally the evolution process (to use brother  Andi's terminology)
in which everything goes hand in hand toward a higher level.

However, generally I try not to talk about economics when discussing
corruption, because a number of potential issues:

a.  The economy advances very slowly.  We need immediate solutions for
corruption.  For immediate solutions, law and ethics work much faster.

b.  The causal relationship between economic advancement and improvement in
ethics is unclear.  What is the cause and what is the effect?  Does economic
advancement cause ethic improvement, or does ethic improvement cause
economic advancement?  In other words, (1) you are ethical and your ethics
helps you make a lot of money, or (2) you make a lot of money while still
unethical and your money helps you become ethical later?  I think,
intuitively many of us may agree with the first scenario.  My experience in
management is that ethics helps my company makes money.  And I haven't seen
an unethical company becomes ethical after it makes a lot of money.

c.  The statements &quot;As the economy advances, people become more ethical,&quot;
although
accepted by most of us as the truth, may carry with it a racist and
discriminatory tone if we think hard about it.

It basically says that the poorer you are the less ethical you are.  This is
a very condescending attitude that may not have any truth in it.  There is
nothing to say that the farmers in the countryside, who are poorer and in a
less developed area than the city dwellers, are less ethical than city
dwellers. Indeed I think that most farmers are more ethical than city
dwellers.  And there is nothing to prove that people of Vietnam, who are
poorer than the American, are less ethical than the American.

So, when we say &quot;as the economy advances, people become less corrupt (or
more ethical),&quot; we really talk about the standards of business and
government practices SET BY ADVANCED NATIONS.  That's fine, when you are
poorer and work in the same marketplace as the very rich guys, you have to
follow the rich's standards.  That is life.  So &quot;The poorer you are, the
more corrupt you are&quot; is a statement from the rich guy's point of view and
rich guy's standards.  Fine, with me.  As I say, in a market, the poor guy
has to follow the rich guy's standards.  But I don't like that
discriminatory and condescending and potentially racist tone.
If we use Vietnamese ethical standards to measure the advanced nations, then
the advanced nations may not be so ethical either.

d.  Economic advancement may have something to do with

Hey Craig,

Nice synopsis of the development process regarding ethics, international
economics and laws.

Yes, i'm certain what i've written here has at times come across as
disjointed, even choplogic&lt; http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/choplogic &gt;.
I've occasionally fretted over the same thing myself.  But, what the hey, if
i took everything that came to or from me by mail too seriously i'd be mad
as a hatter by now -- ok, maybe just madder than normal.

Reconsidering this and the &quot;Leadership&quot; thread, it's even reoccurring to me
that using a mailing list in one's freer time may well be an inappropriate
venue for much of what i've ended up trying to say.  And i, again, did try
to say too much.  Too many personally edutaining digressions kept coming to
mind as i was writing and i often ran out of time to give all that spewed
out either sufficient reconsideration or more considerate re-editing.

If we agree on the Bush-Iraq-Halliburton bit, that's enough for me.  My
original impulse in extending this thread was merely to counter what i felt
was a bit too much Yankee-doodle-dandying, as i put it (still amusingly, for
myself at least ;)).  And you're right to suggest i've got a knee-jerk
reaction against championing the USA as an ethical leader these days.  I'll
admit that's just come from a feeling i've had since Reagan got in -- and
might even have been partly due to withdrawal from &quot;Billy [Carter] Beer&quot;(tm)
when i quixotically refused to go to the States anymore at the time.

Re my use or abuse of the TI Corruption Perception Index, please be assured
i simply chose to use it as a matter of expedience based on TI's apparent
presentation of it as their primary summary stats.  I admittedly noted and
neglected digging into all the other data they offer.  I'd hoped that
supplementing the expectedly more liberal TI charts with what i'd only
expect to be more conservative World Bank data would balance out my
slackness and even let me elude such charges of biased data selection.
(Wrong again!  Yet again.  Dang! ;))

I'll neither deny nor regret vanity and ego play a part in my posts.  I
might not even be bothered if it weren't for those vices.  ;)

Hieu kg?

Best wishes,

&gt; All:

&gt; Have not really been follwoing the thread too deeply but in pre-industrial
&gt; societies, in traditional economies, culture tends to be the basis of each
&gt; countries legal system. Culture has been the driving force of each countries
&gt; ethical and legal values. As countries advance in participating in the
&gt; international trading system then much of their business ethics and legal
&gt; system becomes subsumed to (transformed by) the treaties, agreements, and
&gt; conventions that facilitate freer trade; each countries laws become altered
&gt; by these new agreements which are essentially law themselves. So, where
&gt; countries choose to participate in these international institutions, in
&gt; theory, they choose to relinquish some sovereignty and to have their values
&gt; altered by their participation.  Of course in practice it might be
&gt; different, and surely time is required for material changes.

&gt; AD, as to the logic with which, in previous threads, you had dispelled the
&gt; place the US had played in presenting laws at the international level that
&gt; discouraged corrupt business practices I feel that you may have pieced
&gt; together a series of disjointed facts that did little but inflame and
&gt; nothing to support the case as to your premise.  I say this despite agreeing
&gt; with your position re Bush-Iraq-Halliburton. Of course the monetary value of
&gt; Iraqui oil, in total reserves, not simply yearly production, is but a small
&gt; fraction of the money expended by the US in support of this conflict. I find
&gt; it curious that you looked at Transparency International's &quot;perception&quot;
&gt; index when they create half a dozen different measures on issues related to
&gt; transparency.  I wonder if that might have been purposeful on your part.
&gt; Anyway, I tend to think we may share many similar opinions but as always, I
&gt; tend to take my own beliefs, as others, with a grain of salt, and am vey
&gt; hesitant to call them truth's as similarly in the past with the whole
&gt; Gorbachev-Reagon-Clinton debate. I tend to believe in the concept of
&gt; Satsang, which means to &quot;be in the company of truth&quot; rather than falsely,
&gt; and only mentally, occupying that space.  Too often our dogma becomes our
&gt; truth where we fight, from vanity and ego, to assure it remains there; in
&gt; both our own minds and in the minds of others with whom we are dialoguing.

&gt; &gt; Bro' Phong,

&gt; &gt; Again it seems you anticipated much of what i wrote before i finished it
&gt; &gt; -- and so much more concisely [dang it...]  :D

&gt; &gt; I'd even agree with you that, given Singapore's pre-colonial, colonial
&gt; &gt; and post-colonial history, the subject of a Discovery Channel series,
&gt; &gt; Singaporeans are as much an ethical product of the rules a minority of the
&gt; &gt; most powerful Singaporeans and others imposed.  Singapore is not much of a
&gt; &gt; democracy.   The death penalty for many mere vices is not the popular choice
&gt; &gt; of an ethically extremist population.  And, as is often seen here in
&gt; &gt; SighGone, Sin-a-pore-ians can sin as well as the both the best and worst of
&gt; &gt; us.  ;)

&gt; &gt; But, of the question of &quot;which practically comes first: ethics or
&gt; &gt; laws?&quot;, i'd have to agree with Brother Hoanh that a legal infrastructure
&gt; &gt; must generally be built upon a culture's popular ethics at some specific
&gt; &gt; point in that culture's evolution.  Then, both will evolve hand in hand.

&gt; &gt; I only add that the economics of that particular point in that culture's
&gt; &gt; history will almost equally influence the decisions of both legislative
&gt; &gt; leaders and those who enforce the laws, and, that, again, the relationship
&gt; &gt; between the three, ethics, economics and the Law, becomes a dynamically
&gt; &gt; evolving (ie, PROgressing) system of the simultaneously symbiotic,
&gt; &gt; interdependent &quot;three&quot;, as soon as the first laws are created.

&gt; &gt; And, now, i'll dare add that, over the long term, this PROgressive
&gt; &gt; evolution (a redundancy) seems to happen whether we consciously try to
&gt; &gt; achieve it or not, and, that the net quality of the actions of the actors,
&gt; &gt; good or bad, and the resulting benefits and costs each enjoys or suffers all
&gt; &gt; end up being distributed roughly as they &quot;normally&quot; have been throughout our
&gt; &gt; natural history, something like 10:80:10=good:ambivalent:bad, forever and
&gt; &gt; ever.  And, near the End, most people finally find out they had never had
&gt; &gt; any choice but to begin and keep up living their lives under such an
&gt; &gt; equation, &quot;no matter what&quot; -- dang nab it!  ;D

&gt; &gt; Let the flame wars ensue.  I'm outa here. ;))  Have fun!

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear brother Phong &amp; CACC,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Let's try to clarify this issue by being practical.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree to follow brother Phong's logics:  Our people are so corrupt,
&gt; &gt; &gt; we need ruole of law.  But for the rule of law to operate well, we need
&gt; &gt; &gt; non-corrupt people to operate the law.  So we are in the chicken-and-egg
&gt; &gt; &gt; circle.  Where do you, brother Phong, find non-corrupt people?

&gt; &gt; &gt; My solution is:  We find non-corrupt people thourgh promoting ethics,
&gt; &gt; &gt; such as the Intel Vietnam's memorandum, we need to teach ethics in
&gt; &gt; &gt; universities (for all kinds of professional students, including business
&gt; &gt; &gt; students), we need to promote ethic teaching in families (where parents
&gt; &gt; &gt; train children to be honest and socially responsible) or in churches and
&gt; &gt; &gt; temples or mass organizations like Thanh Doan or Hoi Phu Nu.  We need to
&gt; &gt; &gt; bring ethics to the forefront to produce good people, and good people will
&gt; &gt; &gt; start good rule of law.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Where do you  find non-corrupt people to start your rule of law,
&gt; &gt; &gt; brother Phong, or anyone?  I love to hear an answer.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Have a great day!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Having a legal system in place is not the same as having the rule of

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The rule of law, in short, is my quick answer to chi Lien's
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The &quot;ultimate victory of goodness&quot; is a lofty goal on the order of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;from each according to his ability to each according to his needs&quot;,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are great goals to aspire to but are unlikely to happen on a global

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try to impose either, we end up with a theocracy or communism, each with
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their attendant problems.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In corrupt countries that have laws, there are those in the ruling
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; class that consider themselves above the law, hence the is no rule of laws.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You wouldn't have had to argue with your friends if the rule of law
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was in place and none one is operating outside or above it.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Singaporean have a good sense of ethics.  The question is where does
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that sense of ethics came from.  My contention is the rule of law (that was
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and is considered so draconian as to infringe on individual freedom/civil
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberty).  How do you explain the decidedly unethical behavior of some
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Singaporeans when removed from Singaporean legal proper?  A sudden heart
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; replacement operation?  How do you explain ethical American companies
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; belly-aching  about how the FCPA limits them from being corrupted?

I almost forgot.  GREAT point you made, Craig, about the Iraqi oil reserves
being worth less than the current (if not expected) cost of the occupation.
I'd never seen that pointed out before and i'll somewhat shamefacedly admit
i never even considered it.

But what about the overall expected value of having controlling interests in
both Iraq and Afghanistan, including that expected from being able to better
control pipelines across them?  Personally, i'd be interested in both what
expected net benefits were at invasion time and now that Iraq at least has
become what is apparently a much longer than expected occupation and ongoing
battle against a shifting and/or
shifty&lt; http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shifty &gt;insurgency.

&gt; &gt; Gorbachev-Reagon-Clinton debate. I tend to believe in the concept of
&gt; &gt; Satsang, which means to &quot;be in the company of truth&quot; rather than falsely,
&gt; &gt; and only mentally, occupying that space.  Too often our dogma becomes our
&gt; &gt; truth where we fight, from vanity and ego, to assure it remains there; in
&gt; &gt; both our own minds and in the minds of others with whom we are dialoguing.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Bro' Phong,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Again it seems you anticipated much of what i wrote before i finished
&gt; &gt; &gt; it -- and so much more concisely [dang it...]  :D

&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd even agree with you that, given Singapore's pre-colonial, colonial
&gt; &gt; &gt; and post-colonial history, the subject of a Discovery Channel series,
&gt; &gt; &gt; Singaporeans are as much an ethical product of the rules a minority of the
&gt; &gt; &gt; most powerful Singaporeans and others imposed.  Singapore is not much of a
&gt; &gt; &gt; democracy.   The death penalty for many mere vices is not the popular choice
&gt; &gt; &gt; of an ethically extremist population.  And, as is often seen here in
&gt; &gt; &gt; SighGone, Sin-a-pore-ians can sin as well as the both the best and worst of
&gt; &gt; &gt; us.  ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt; But, of the question of &quot;which practically comes first: ethics or
&gt; &gt; &gt; laws?&quot;, i'd have to agree with Brother Hoanh that a legal infrastructure
&gt; &gt; &gt; must generally be built upon a culture's popular ethics at some specific
&gt; &gt; &gt; point in that culture's evolution.  Then, both will evolve hand in hand.

&gt; &gt; &gt; I only add that the economics of that particular point in that
&gt; &gt; &gt; culture's history will almost equally influence the decisions of both
&gt; &gt; &gt; legislative leaders and those who enforce the laws, and, that, again, the
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship between the three, ethics, economics and the Law, becomes a
&gt; &gt; &gt; dynamically evolving (ie, PROgressing) system of the simultaneously
&gt; &gt; &gt; symbiotic, interdependent &quot;three&quot;, as soon as the first laws are created.

&gt; &gt; &gt; And, now, i'll dare add that, over the long term, this PROgressive
&gt; &gt; &gt; evolution (a redundancy) seems to happen whether we consciously try to
&gt; &gt; &gt; achieve it or not, and, that the net quality of the actions of the actors,
&gt; &gt; &gt; good or bad, and the resulting benefits and costs each enjoys or suffers all
&gt; &gt; &gt; end up being distributed roughly as they &quot;normally&quot; have been throughout our
&gt; &gt; &gt; natural history, something like 10:80:10=good:ambivalent:bad, forever and
&gt; &gt; &gt; ever.  And, near the End, most people finally find out they had never had
&gt; &gt; &gt; any choice but to begin and keep up living their lives under such an
&gt; &gt; &gt; equation, &quot;no matter what&quot; -- dang nab it!  ;D

&gt; &gt; &gt; Let the flame wars ensue.  I'm outa here. ;))  Have fun!

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear brother Phong &amp; CACC,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let's try to clarify this issue by being practical.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I agree to follow brother Phong's logics:  Our people are so
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; corrupt, we need ruole of law.  But for the rule of law to operate well, we
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need non-corrupt people to operate the law.  So we are in the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chicken-and-egg circle.  Where do you, brother Phong, find non-corrupt
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My solution is:  We find non-corrupt people thourgh promoting
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ethics, such as the Intel Vietnam's memorandum, we need to teach ethics in
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universities (for all kinds of professional students, including business
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; students), we need to promote ethic teaching in families (where parents
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; train children to be honest and socially responsible) or in churches and
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temples or mass organizations like Thanh Doan or Hoi Phu Nu.  We need to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bring ethics to the forefront to produce good people, and good people will
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start good rule of law.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Where do you  find non-corrupt people to start your rule of law,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brother Phong, or anyone?  I love to hear an answer.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have a great day!

Dear CACC,

Just so you know that I have decided to leave my job for a whilst to restart
my academic life in the University of Cambridge. I am now already in the
Hong Kong Airport waiting to board the next flight to London.

If some of you happen to cross by Cambridge, please do let me know, we might
have a small vnbiz gathering there :-)!

All the best,

Thanh AN

Dear sis. Thanh An &amp; CACC,

Thanks for the note, Thanh An.  I've been waiting for that.  The day has
come finally.

For everyone, chi Thanh An is going to Cambridge for a master in public
policy under the Chevening Scholarship, the most prestigious scholarship to
study in England.  Thanh An is very talented, with high leadership skill.  I
am happy that Thanh An has decided to take some time to further her academic
endeavor.

Good luck and have fun, sister.  Send to note to the forum once in a while.
Don't let the books smother you.

Hoanh

BTW, you last name has been changed in this message (below) :-)

Um.  Further thoughts, further thoughts, forever further thoughts, on
dubiously relevant subjects.  But i'll try to put an end to them being
posted here at least in as fair a manner as i can now imagine.

Craig, at least for the purposes of posting here, please forget i asked
about the net oil-related benefits of the choice to have the USA invade
Iraq.  This list is about Vietnam business not Iraq or the USA's wars or
their motivations.  They came up as side issues.

However, I will add that I agree Iraq is obviously about more than oil, but,
that i still believe direct and indirect control of both Middle Eastern oil
supplies and the USA's economy and public by oil-industry interests were
originally primary, if not the primary motives for having the USA invade
Iraq.  Providing a rigorous argument for as much is well beyond the scope of
any mailing list post, much less one about Vietnam business.

Why?  Simply for examples of a couple more complex hypotheses that would
have be tested to either identify or measure the net benefits to the USA's
current Bush Admin and its oil-industry family and associates from invading
Iraq, we would have to ask, &quot;Wasn't Iraq's invasion partly, yet
significantly (1) planned as a diversion from the need to provide more
difficult domestic solutions for the USA while (2) providing more political
and economic power to the USA's tightly interdependent military complex and
oil industry?&quot;  Being heavily invested in the oil and arms industries. the
Bush family and its closest associates would benefit from both, no?

Yet how could we even start to measure the benefits of either (1) or (2),
above?  And, even if we could, why would we compare them to any current or
expected level of the USA's direct expenditure on Iraq's invasion,
occupation and reconstruction?  While those expenditures are being made by
the USA's taxpayers, among the most significant beneficiaries are most
likely a private clique, that of the Bush family and its associates in the
oil and arms industries.  Further, those private benefits are most likely to
accrue most significantly for long after Bush Jr leaves office.

If that's the case, there is little relevance in simply comparing of the
USA's expenditures on invading, occupying and rebuilding Iraq to its
Public's gains from as much.  Those who chose to undertake the Iraq Invasion
project didn't have to bear the vast majority of its costs, even though they
stand to benefit astronomically for it, during and after either its
execution or retirement.   Quite an incentive, if you're primarily into
financial incentives, no?

If you do have anything you'd like to add, you can be assured i'll do
nothing to keep your words from being the last here on this specific topic.
My own desire to stand with that closest to contemporary truth is satisfied
about what i've said or not said here about this topic.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I almost forgot.  GREAT point you made, Craig, about the Iraqi oil
&gt; reserves being worth less than the current (if not expected) cost of the
&gt; occupation.  I'd never seen that pointed out before and i'll somewhat
&gt; shamefacedly admit i never even considered it.

&gt; But what about the overall expected value of having controlling interests
&gt; in both Iraq and Afghanistan, including that expected from being able to
&gt; better control pipelines across them?  Personally, i'd be interested in both
&gt; what expected net benefits were at invasion time and now that Iraq at least
&gt; has become what is apparently a much longer than expected occupation and
&gt; ongoing battle against a shifting and/or shifty&lt; http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shifty &gt;insurgency.

&gt; &gt; Hey Craig,

&gt; &gt; Nice synopsis of the development process regarding ethics, international
&gt; &gt; economics and laws.

&gt; &gt; Yes, i'm certain what i've written here has at times come across as
&gt; &gt; disjointed, even choplogic&lt; http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/choplogic &gt;.
&gt; &gt; I've occasionally fretted over the same thing myself.  But, what the hey, if
&gt; &gt; i took everything that came to or from me by mail too seriously i'd be mad
&gt; &gt; as a hatter by now -- ok, maybe just madder than normal.

&gt; &gt; Reconsidering this and the &quot;Leadership&quot; thread, it's even reoccurring to
&gt; &gt; me that using a mailing list in one's freer time may well be an
&gt; &gt; inappropriate venue for much of what i've ended up trying to say.  And i,
&gt; &gt; again, did try to say too much.  Too many personally edutaining digressions
&gt; &gt; kept coming to mind as i was writing and i often ran out of time to give all
&gt; &gt; that spewed out either sufficient reconsideration or more considerate
&gt; &gt; re-editing.

&gt; &gt; If we agree on the Bush-Iraq-Halliburton bit, that's enough for me.  My
&gt; &gt; original impulse in extending this thread was merely to counter what i felt
&gt; &gt; was a bit too much Yankee-doodle-dandying, as i put it (still amusingly, for
&gt; &gt; myself at least ;)).  And you're right to suggest i've got a knee-jerk
&gt; &gt; reaction against championing the USA as an ethical leader these days.  I'll
&gt; &gt; admit that's just come from a feeling i've had since Reagan got in -- and
&gt; &gt; might even have been partly due to withdrawal from &quot;Billy [Carter] Beer&quot;(tm)
&gt; &gt; when i quixotically refused to go to the States anymore at the time.

&gt; &gt; Re my use or abuse of the TI Corruption Perception Index, please be
&gt; &gt; assured i simply chose to use it as a matter of expedience based on TI's
&gt; &gt; apparent presentation of it as their primary summary stats.  I admittedly
&gt; &gt; noted and neglected digging into all the other data they offer.  I'd hoped
&gt; &gt; that supplementing the expectedly more liberal TI charts with what i'd only
&gt; &gt; expect to be more conservative World Bank data would balance out my
&gt; &gt; slackness and even let me elude such charges of biased data selection.
&gt; &gt; (Wrong again!  Yet again.  Dang! ;))

&gt; &gt; I'll neither deny nor regret vanity and ego play a part in my posts.  I
&gt; &gt; might not even be bothered if it weren't for those vices.  ;)

&gt; &gt; &gt; All:

&gt; &gt; &gt; Have not really been follwoing the thread too deeply but in
&gt; &gt; &gt; pre-industrial societies, in traditional economies, culture tends to be the
&gt; &gt; &gt; basis of each countries legal system. Culture has been the driving force of
&gt; &gt; &gt; each countries ethical and legal values. As countries advance in
&gt; &gt; &gt; participating in the international trading system then much of their
&gt; &gt; &gt; business ethics and legal system becomes subsumed to (transformed by) the
&gt; &gt; &gt; treaties, agreements, and conventions that facilitate freer trade; each
&gt; &gt; &gt; countries laws become altered by these new agreements which are essentially
&gt; &gt; &gt; law themselves. So, where countries choose to participate in these
&gt; &gt; &gt; international institutions, in theory, they choose to relinquish some
&gt; &gt; &gt; sovereignty and to have their values altered by their participation.  Of
&gt; &gt; &gt; course in practice it might be different, and surely time is required for
&gt; &gt; &gt; material changes.

&gt; &gt; &gt; AD, as to the logic with which, in previous threads, you had dispelled
&gt; &gt; &gt; the place the US had played in presenting laws at the international level
&gt; &gt; &gt; that discouraged corrupt business practices I feel that you may have pieced
&gt; &gt; &gt; together a series of disjointed facts that did little but inflame and
&gt; &gt; &gt; nothing to support the case as to your premise.  I say this despite agreeing
&gt; &gt; &gt; with your position re Bush-Iraq-Halliburton. Of course the monetary value of
&gt; &gt; &gt; Iraqui oil, in total reserves, not simply yearly production, is but a small
&gt; &gt; &gt; fraction of the money expended by the US in support of this conflict. I find
&gt; &gt; &gt; it curious that you looked at Transparency International's &quot;perception&quot;
&gt; &gt; &gt; index when they create half a dozen different measures on issues related to
&gt; &gt; &gt; transparency.  I wonder if that might have been purposeful on your part.
&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, I tend to think we may share many similar opinions but as always, I
&gt; &gt; &gt; tend to take my own beliefs, as others, with a grain of salt, and am vey
&gt; &gt; &gt; hesitant to call them truth's as similarly in the past with the whole

Congratulations, Thanh An. I have heard recently that Cambridge is ranked
above Oxford now. Wish a good success with your study there and please share
with me if there is something new in policy making practice that you learn
from your program (I studied Public Policy also long time ago in Singapore,
where I happened to know anh Hoanh). you have such a courage to go to study
while two your children are still small. How courageous VN women are!!

All the best to you, dear sister.

&gt; &gt; am happy that Thanh An has decided to take some time to further her academic
&gt; &gt; endeavor.

&gt; &gt; Good luck and have fun, sister.  Send to note to the forum once in a
&gt; &gt; while.  Don't let the books smother you.

&gt; &gt; &gt;  Dear CACC,

&gt; &gt; &gt; Just so you know that I have decided to leave my job for a whilst to
&gt; &gt; &gt; restart my academic life in the University of Cambridge. I am now already in
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Hong Kong Airport waiting to board the next flight to London.

&gt; &gt; &gt; If some of you happen to cross by Cambridge, please do let me know, we
&gt; &gt; &gt; might have a small vnbiz gathering there J !

&gt; &gt; &gt; All the best,

&gt; Dear Thanh An,

&gt; Congratulations, Thanh An. I have heard recently that Cambridge is ranked
&gt; above Oxford now. Wish a good success with your study there and please share
&gt; with me if there is something new in policy making practice that you learn
&gt; from your program (I studied Public Policy also long time ago in Singapore,
&gt; where I happened to know anh Hoanh). you have such a courage to go to study
&gt; while two your children are still small. How courageous VN women are!!

&gt; All the best to you, dear sister.
