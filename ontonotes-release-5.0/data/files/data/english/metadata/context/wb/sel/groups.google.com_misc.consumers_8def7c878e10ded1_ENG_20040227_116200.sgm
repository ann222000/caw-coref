A co-worker told me that Little Caesar's sells $5 pizzas? Is that
true?

I had Little Caesars Yesterday.. it is basically Tomato sauce with bread and
cheese. you can pick up packets of seasoning to make it taste better but I
did not know about it till I was all done. The pizza costs $5.99 for a
large 1 topping. I would have much rather had Pizza Hut.

"/> That's odd. Where I live, there are several really GOOD independent
pizza/sub shops, but the local Little Ceasars's had better pizza for a
better price. In fact, the Little Ceasar's pizza was the best in several
towns until we got our first Papa John's. I suspect this might be a
franchise problem. That is, maybe Little Ceasar's really sucks in some
areas. Unfortunately, our Little Ceasar's didn't stay in business for more
than about 18 months. I could speculate that maybe since they were making
such good pizza, they weren't making a profit? Or to look at it another way
. . . maybe in the areas where you can make a profit with a Little Ceasar's,
you have to seriously skimp on ingredients to do so? -Dave

"/> I actually use to like Little Caesars until their pizzas got really
greasy. I mean, literally, the middle of the box was dripping and it
was made of cardboard! They also got rid of the &quot;small&quot; size pizza and
everytime I said I wanted a &quot;small pizza&quot; they would say there was no
&quot;small pizza&quot;, but the &quot;smallest size&quot; was a &quot;medium pizza&quot;! It seems
pretty dumb to start playing word games with your customers. I was
also somewhat of a regular and the lady behind the counter was
bellowing how great the last customer was for giving her a tip while I
was waiting for my pizza in a loud tone, as if to indicate I was
suppose to tip her for making such a great pizza! Also, when I ordered
&quot;crazy bread&quot; with a container of pizza sauce, they filled it half
full.

Pizza Hut is not bad, but very expensive. The last time I went there
and ordered a medium pepperoni lover's it was like $16 with a coke!

Papa John's is usually where I go, but they too have gone down hill.
They use to place the pepperoni underneath the cheese which kept the
grease down, but now they put it on top. I'm guessing so that this is
so they can use less cheese. They also put expiration dates on their
coupons within the last two months and raised the price of the &quot;nifty-
nine-fifty&quot; to &quot;nifty-ten-fifty!&quot;. It ain't so nifty anymore!

There's a nice little local pub that has pretty good pizza, so the
chains can keep their nifty pizzas!

Have you ever tried Pap Murphy's? It's a &quot;take &amp; bake&quot; place, so they tend to be
a bit cheaper than the fully cooked places.

They have an excellent &quot;Deeper Dish&quot; for $10. Something like 3 pounds of
ingredients that could feed 4 hungry college students . Reminds me of a pizza
place on the north side of Chicago near Lincoln Park.

Alright, fuck all of you fuckheads.

1) Pizza! Pizza! is decent but not good. It's do-able espcially
considering the price. I also thought they went out of business but
recently saw they weren't.

2) Old Dominos ruled back in the day but now ALL chain pizza is shit.

buffet deal for something like $6.99. I can tolerate mediocre
pizza for that price. Especially for lunch, which I consider
a utilitarian meal anyway. I'll save quality for dinnertime.

&gt;&gt; That's odd. Where I live, there are several really GOOD independent
&gt;&gt; pizza/sub shops, but the local Little Ceasars's had better pizza for a
&gt;&gt; better price.
&gt;Hmm... you must live far from NY. Here all chain pizza is blown away by
&gt;ANY local pizza joint.

"/> I would never say ALL local places are good,
but MOST are better than the chains.
I live in NJ and just enjoyed lunch at the local pizzeria.
Even Penn Station NY has a local deli and pizzeria
(Don Pepe) that are always busy.
But pizza shops near colleges tend to be AWFUL since they
have guaranteed business regardless of quality :-(

Perhaps the variations in local pizzerias is a good thing
since people have different preferences.

I friend insisted that we have dinner at Pizza Hut
for their veggie pizza.
The entire staff was lazy, slow and barely did their jobs.
No local place would tolerate that.

"/> Most Pizza Huts don't tolerate it either. And no, I'm not defending the
home of the mega-grease pizza either. That new 4 in 1 pizza they have is
one of the biggest ripoffs I have ever seen, and the taste, well, I say I'd
rather taste the toppings than taste the grease!

&gt; 1) Pizza! Pizza! is decent but not good. It's do-able espcially
&gt; considering the price. I also thought they went out of business but
&gt; recently saw they weren't.

&gt; 2) Old Dominos ruled back in the day but now ALL chain pizza is shit.

"/> Getting a pizza at a chain is like getting a burger at McD's. You
know what you're getting, but it is generally mediocre at best. Pizza
Hut is very overpriced. The Little Caesars here closed years ago, and
with good reason. Don't think we've ever had a Dominos around here.
You might as well buy a ready-to-bake one at the supermarket.

This is not to say all local pizza places are good either...there are
some really dreadful ones as well as some that rock. Pizza is so easy
to make, how come there are so many bad pizza places?

"/> s/Unless/Even if/

Another viable option for many people is (don't laugh) frozen pizza.
/Consumer Reports/ last year rated the rising-crust type of frozen
pizza as quite acceptable, and that's been my experience too.
Freschetta is pretty tasty -- not equal to really good local pizza,
but still a cut above Pizza Hut. It goes on sale every few weeks,
but even at regular price it's cheaper than takeout, not to mention
being faster from freezer to table. I add some oil-cured olives and
either sliced pepperoni or cubed leftover chicken when popping it in
the oven.

Something I'd like to see a lot more of is the take-and-bake
concept. My sister lives out in the country, and in town there's a
shop where they make the pizza and put it in a box but you bake it
as soon as you get it home. Then it's fresh from the oven, without
growing soggy and cold in a 30-minute car trip.

"/> Agreed. As I mentioned in a previous post, Papa Murphys has some excellent take
&amp; bake pizzas. Their &quot;Deeper Dish&quot;, gourmet and double crust pizzas are
particularly good.
