Ok, I give up, I downloaded the RT2500 drivers, chewed my
way through the command line to set them up.

Now, damnit YAST has the card and sets it up, but the card
will not associate with the access point.

Can someone tell me what G card is set up without a battle?
PCI card that is.

Hi
Is it s 64-bit machine? I use an access bridge WET54G on
this one. I did try some 64bit rt2500 drivers but couldn't get WPA to
work.

If not my Toshiba runs an intel card which uses the ipw2200 driver and
works fine. Else atheros chip and madwifi is probably the way to go.

Thanks Malcolm, no it is a 32 bit machine the card is set up
in YAST but when using KwifiManager it can see the access point
but it gives a message, invalid wep key specification.

Wep is turned off in both the access point and the card.

Other than the wireless SLED is great, got all my programs
VLC etc loaded .

What about  iwlist &lt;interface&gt; list do you see your access point. Have
you tried to enter the commands held by the config with iwconfig eg

iwconfig &lt;interface&gt; essid your_ap_name

Have a look at man iwconfig and of course any log messages.

Oops, that should be iwlist &lt;interface&gt; scan. I have about 3 other
wireless networks around here, so also ensure your at least 2 channels
away from any that may be in your area.

Thanks Malcolm, I will get my head down reading the wireless
