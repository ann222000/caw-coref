I did pray to God whether I should pursue the gift of celibacy
when I did not find anyone special. In my opinion, I do not have
such gift. I am not happy with my loneliness.

Before you cast the first stone (John 8:7), I ask you for some
charity by praying for me. I was ill last Sunday, and I was very
alone when I do not have the strength to go to church.

I know some brothers and sisters in Christ, who have the gift of
celibacy. They will tell me that I wanted to sin through marriage.
Some interrogated my loneliness and told me that God should
be sufficient for my loneliness. Well, in my opinion, loneliness is
not a sin. Loneliness is a sin when sinful man chooses to be
alone by not seeking fellowship with God and with His church.
Loneliness is not a sin when sinful man wants to get married.
Adam was lonely too before he met Eve and before the Fall.
Adam was not sinning even though he also was lonely. Adam
was alone in Genesis 2:18. The Fall happened in Genesis
Chapter 3.

If you can pray for me, then please pray for me that I will find my
Eve. Please pray that she will be a strong Christian and that I
find her beautiful.

In Christ,
Joseph Yosuk Lee
Church Member
Sarang Community Church at Seoul, South Korea

Prayer Requests:

1. Please pray for my mother, father, and younger brother
Richard that they will worship our Jesus as their Savior and
Lord.

2. Please also pray that they will also realize both money
invested and time invested building relationships with
people for God's glory is eternal.

3. Please pray that my father will not have any serious heart
problems after he had his heart attack on September 1, 2001.

4. Please pray for my Christian grandmother that she will be
strong enough to come to my younger brother's wedding on
the month of December of this year.

5. Please pray that I will tame my foolish tongue in terms of
arguing with my father, mother, and younger brother related to
the Bible, church, God, finances, and other issues of pride.

Messages in this topic (1) 2. The necklace Posted by: &quot;Sandy Griggs&quot; georgiesgal2@yahoo.com georgiesgal2 Mon Dec 3, 2007 4:04 am (PST)

The necklace

The
cheerful little girl with bouncy golden curls was almost five. Waiting
with her mother at the checkout stand, she saw them, a circle of
glistening white pearls in a pink foil box.

&quot;Oh mommy please, Mommy. Can I have them? Please, Mommy, please?&quot;

Quickly
the mother checked the back of the little foil box and then looked back
into the pleading blue eyes of her little girl's upturned face.

&quot;A
dollar ninety-five. That's almost $2.00. If you really want them, I'll
think of some extra chores for you and in no time you can save enough
money to buy them for yourself. Your birthday's only a week away and
you might get another crisp dollar bill from Grandma.&quot;

As soon
as Jenny got home, she emptied her penny bank and counted out 17
pennies. After dinner, she did more than her share of chores and she
went to the neighbor and asked Mrs. McJames if she could pick
dandelions for ten cents. On her birthday, Grandma did give her another
new dollar bill and at last she had enough money to buy the necklace.

Jenny
loved her pearls. They made her feel dressed up and grown up. She wore
them everywhere, Sunday school, kindergarten, even to bed. The only
time she took them off was when she went swimming or had a bubble bath. Mother said if they got wet, they might turn her neck green.

Jenny
had a very loving daddy and every night when she was ready for bed, he
would stop whatever he was doing and come upstairs to read her a story.
One night as he finished the story, he asked Jenny, &quot;Do you love me?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, daddy. You know that I love you.&quot;

&quot;Then give me your pearls.&quot;
&quot;Oh,
daddy, not my pearls. But you can have Princess, the white horse from
my collection, the one with the pink tail. Remember, daddy? The one you
gave me. She's my very favorite.&quot;

&quot;That's okay, Honey, daddy loves you. Good night.&quot; And he brushed her cheek with a kiss.

About a week later, after the story time, Jenny's daddy asked again, &quot;Do you love me?&quot;

&quot;Daddy, you know I love you.&quot;

&quot;Then give me your pearls.&quot;
&quot;Oh Daddy, not my pearls. But you can have my baby doll. The brand new one I got for my birthday. She is beautiful and you can have the yellow blanket that matches her sleeper.&quot;

&quot;That's okay. Sleep well. God bless you, little one. Daddy loves you.&quot;

And as always, he brushed her cheek with a gentle kiss.

A few nights later when her daddy came in, Jenny was sitting on her bed with her legs crossed Indian style.

As he came close, he noticed her chin was trembling and one silent tear rolled down her cheek.
&quot;What is it, Jenny? What's the matter?&quot;

Jenny didn't say anything but lifted her little hand up to her daddy. And when she opened it, there was her little pearl necklace. With a little quiver, she finally said, &quot;Here, daddy; this is for you.&quot;

With
tears gathering in his own eyes, Jenny's daddy reached out with one
hand to take the dime store necklace, and with the other hand he
reached into his pocket and pulled out a blue velvet case with a strand
of genuine pearls and gave them to Jenny.

He had them all the
time He was just waiting for her to give up the dime-store stuff so he
could give her the genuine treasure. So it is, with our Heavenly
Father. He is waiting for us to give up the cheap things in our lives
so that he can give us beautiful treasures.

God will never take away something without giving you something better in its place.

You can do two things with this story:
A Pass it on and let others be touched by its message;
B. Throw it away and not let it touch your heart.
The greatest gifts happen when you share love and touch others

JESUS IS THE REASON FOR THE SEASON

YSICJ, Sandy

Subject: Where is your treasure? - by: G. Craige Lewis

The EX Daily Word for December 3, 2007

Where is your treasure?

Luke 12:34 It’s obvious, isn’t it? The place where your treasure is, is the
place you
will most want to be, and end up being. -The Message Bible

The one thing I never really bought into was Santa Claus. As a child, other
kids would
talk about Santa around Christmas time, but I just wasn't really buying it.
I just felt like,
my father worked so hard to get me and my sisters stuff for Christmas, why
in the world
would I give that credit to some chimney sweeper? My daddy was the gift
giver in my
house and I was proud of that. But there was a lesson even in that. I later
learned that
the only reason God gave me a father was to illustrate his relationship to
men as a heavenly
father. That being learned, I saw how he can really give good gifts to us
because of his love
for us. But so many times, we lose sight of where the gifts and blessings we
have are coming from. So many times we get so caught up in our workplaces or
our abilities that we forget it's the love of God that blesses us and not
some paycheck or fleshly ability that we have.

God put gifts in you to cause you to prosper. And when you ask him for an
avenue to use your gift, he will cause your gift to prosper you and sustain
your income. It's not the JOB and it's not &quot;THE MAN&quot; that is sustaining you,
but it is God's gift in you. Keep your treasure out of your own hands and
let God keep it. If you keep your treasure in heaven, then you are not
responsible for it and it will always be there. Let me put it like this. If
you trust in your job or your salary to sustain you, then when it's gone,
what are you gonna do? If you trust in man to promote you and take care of
you, then when they get fleshly and decide to let you go, what are you gonna
do? Who you put your confidence in is who owns you! That's how people become
workaholics, slaves to work and to their bosses, and they have no life. They
have no time for family, friends, or most importantly, God's work! They just
work and then when they get old, they regret! But you must realize that God
wants you happy, and he wants you to spend time with the family he has
blessed you with. Once you realize that his yoke is easy and his burdens are
light and if you keep your treasure in him, you will not be a slave to your
gift, but your gift will operate in obedience to him. Trust God and his
ability to use your gift and abilities. Don't just work a job for money, but
allow God to place you where you work so you can prosper according to his
will for you. That way, your confidence and treasure will always belong to
God.

( JOHN 14:21 *NKJV )

Dear Sharoon,
When we lovingly obey God's Commandments, and study
His Word we begin to experience a more intimate knowledge
of our Heavenly Father. It is through that knowledge that we
become closer to Him as well, for it is written that if you: DRAW
NEAR TO GOD AND HE WILL DRAW NEAR TO YOU.
( JAMES 4:8 )

Now isn't is a pity that so many in this World today feel
unloved and alone, when all they have to do is reach out
to God? For it is also written: GOD IS LOVE. (1 JOHN 4:8)
Why not pray for them tonight, and always tell God how
much you love Him when you pray. For God has said:
&quot;I LOVE THOSE WHO LOVE ME, AND THOSE WHO SEEK
ME DILIGENTLY WILL FIND ME.&quot;
( PROVERBS 8:17 )

So Sharoon, LOVE THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART,
WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.
( MATTHEW 22:37 ) AND HE WILL LOVE YOU AND BLESS
YOU in return. ( DEUTERONOMY 7:13 ) He will also fill you
with His Great Love, a love that the World does not know.

Have a wonderful day Sharoon, and may God's Blessings
be with you always! Amen.

In HIS Love &amp; Service,
Pastor Allen

Doubt and Faith Cannot Co-Exist
by Dr. Larry Ollison

Have you ever prayed and stayed “in faith” for something and it seemed like nothing happened?

When Jesus spoke, things happened instantly. But why did Jesus’ faith work instantly, but sometimes it seems like ours doesn’t?

Often we fail to take the time necessary to get the revelation knowledge needed to obtain a word from God. We must have the Word of God living in our hearts in order to accomplish our desires and needs.

Jesus put a great emphasis on words. Every time He did something, He spoke. So what’s the big difference between Jesus and us?

Granted, Jesus was, is, and always will be the Son of God. However, when Jesus was here on earth, He operated with the same power that you and I have access to. He operated under the power and the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Jesus made it very clear: “The same works that I do, you will do and even greater ones” (John 14:12).

Jesus had the living rhema word inside of Him. Jesus said He never said anything unless the Father spoke it first and He said He didn’t do anything unless the Father first spoke it to Him. Jesus said, “My words are spirit and they are life.”

When we hear the Word of God it must become established in our heart. Logos is the written Word of God and rhema is the living, spoken Word of God. The Word changes from logos to rhema in your heart, not your mind.

To read and know about the Word is logos. But when that scripture suddenly comes alive to you and you know it beyond any shadow of doubt, then it becomes rhema. When it becomes rhema, then you have faith. Then, the words you speak will not be empty words, but they will be words of faith and will accomplish the thing they are sent to do. Romans 10:17 tells us that faith comes from rhema word.

God does not respond to an echo. God does not respond to a parakeet. God and His angels respond to the spoken Word of God that’s alive, coming out of your mouth. God responds to faith, not intellect.

One reason we have problems making the Word come alive in our mouth is familiarity. We become so familiar with a scripture that we assume we know it when actually we don’t.

We must speak the rhema Word of God from our heart and act on it in faith in order to have the Word of God produce results.

Let me give you an example of the difference between believing and being in faith. Years ago there was a man who crossed over a great waterfall on a cable that was attached to the bank on each side. To make it interesting, he pushed a wheelbarrow ahead of him on the cable. Belief would say, “He can do it!” Faith would get in the wheelbarrow.

We may mentally believe the Word of God and speak the Word of God but when it comes time to really rely on it we must get in that wheelbarrow.

Doubt and faith cannot co-exist. Doubt will keep you from putting action to your belief and hinder your faith.

Remember, when the Word of God becomes rhema word in your heart, then it will accomplish what you send it to do!

For indeed the gospel was preached to us as well as to them; but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard it. Hebrews 4:2

Father God I lift my prayer in humble adoration and love for you, teach me
to pray O Lord and to accept Your truth. Father I give thanks, for all the
blessings you have bestowed upon me and mine and I thank You for meeting all
my daily needs. I trust You Father for great has been Your faithfulness to
me. Father teach me to be a true Christ Jesus follower. Teach me to be
obedient even when rejected for standing on Your word and my good is evilly
spoken of, as I stay focused on Christ Jesus and He is Lord over my life, my
mind, my body, my will, my emotions and spirit. Father I choose to forgive
the attacks whether silent or written. I choose to bless and curse not and
ask You Lord to forgive me and them for our parts.
Father I lift each prayer request needs before You and ask that Your will be
done in the earth as it is in heaven. Father I am going to pray the way You
have taught me, and ask You to help other discern Your word is what I pray.
Father I come boldly to Your throne of grace too obtain mercy and grace in
each prayer request need according to Heb 4:16. Father You have said that
You long to be near and to intervene in our circumstances and illnesses but
we must have faith and believe that You will do what You say for us and I do
believe. Father Jesus said He always did Your will and if we know Him we
know the Father. Father Jesus came preaching and teaching about You and He
healed all who came to Him. Father You said if we have faith in God, like
that of a mustard seed we can ask anything and You will do it for us, help
our unbelief and hear our prayer an attend unto our prayer. Father heal the
diseased, the wounded hearts, the emotions and free Your people for whom the
Son of God makes free is free indeed.
Father God teach us to walk in Your healing and Your word for Your word is
truth (John 17:17). Teach us to die to self so that You may increase in us,
for us and through us. Deliver us from evil and keep us centered in Your
will. Write your word upon our hearts and minds so we will not sin against
You. Teach us to fear You again O Lord so we will truly reverence You.
Father forgive us for being a me person, who forgets it is not about us but
about You. Father teach us to truly exalt the name of Jesus and never forget
the sacrifice that He has done so we can have salvation and right
relationship with You. Father teach us not too be offended by Your truth and
to humble our hearts before You so we can grow spiritually and be of service
to others.
Abba Father walk with each person today and show them Your way as they seek
You. Father God help us through the Holy Spirit to guard our minds and
hearts from letting offence in and bitterness destroying our witness. Teach
us not to reject the messengers who walk in Your truth, but Lord God
Almighty spare Your people for we perish for lack of knowledge (Hosea 6:6).
Father God in Proverbs 29:18 (NLT) When people do not accept divine guidance
they run wild. But whoever obeys the law is happy. Father teach us to walk
in Your commands for then we will prosper and be a success in You. Father we
perish because we have no knowledge except man given and not spiritually
given as the word says the Holy Spirit will teach us. Father today I stand
in the gap and I bind the lying, heavy and tormenting spirits and
principalities that keep us from seeking your truth based on Luke 10:19.
Father I ask that the scales fall off our eyes and that the god of self be
put down, our hearts humbled and cleanse in You. Father You said if we
confess, repent turning from our sins, You would cleanse us. Father I pray
You will help each heart to discern that my prayer is not an attack on
individuals but a direct attack on the enemy of God who blinds us to the
truth. I pray You will open hearts to receive Your truth and offence comes
from pride and You did say the word cuts like a knife and the word is your
truth. It does not matter Lord what I want to believe and what feels good to
me, but it is important that I follow Your word and cast down my false
images of You. Father I am not concerned about the needs, because You said
You will provide (Phil 4:19) and I trust you to do so, but I am concerned
about our spiritual heart conditions and our denial of that heart condition.
Father open our hearts, give us new hearts and minds in You. In Jesus I pray

Amen

Messages in this topic (2) 11. Lack of knowledge and Vision Posted by: &quot;Marcella&quot; moderator@livingwatersdisciples.com wwjd_hisword Mon Dec 3, 2007 6:19 am (PST)

Proverbs 29:18 (KJV) Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he
that keepeth the law, happy is he.

Proverbs 29:18 (NLT) When people do not accept divine guidance, they run
wild. But whoever obeys the law is happy.

&quot;Revelation&quot; refers to words from God received by prophets. Where there is
ignorance of God, crime and sin run wild. Public morality depends on the
knowledge of God, but it also depends on keeping God’s laws. In order for
both nations and individuals to function well, people must know God’s ways
and keep his rules.
Today we have Revelation in God's word, but in the early Church day the
Torah was kept at the synagogues and to study them you had to go there.
Today we have a Book of the Bible, but then it was scrolls. We truly have no
excuse for lack of knowledge today except rebellion against god and placing
ourselves above the most high God. We have the Prophets words here neatly
composed in the Bible. The choice is ours whether we chose to find the words
of life and obey them or to reject the message.
Making the same mistake over and over is an invitation to disaster.
Eventually people have to face the consequences of refusing to learn. If
their mistake is refusing God’s invitations or rejecting his commands, the
consequences will be especially serious. In the end, God may have to turn
them away. Make sure you are not stiff-necked.
Hosea 4:6 (KJV) My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because
thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no
priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also
forget thy children.
Hosea 4:6 (NLT) My people are being destroyed because they don't know me.
It is all your fault, you priests, for you yourselves refuse to know me. Now
I refuse to recognize you as my priests. Since you have forgotten the laws
of your God, I will forget to bless your children.
Hosea leveled his charges against the religious leaders. Who were these
religious leaders? When Jeroboam I rebelled against Solomon’s son Rehoboam
and set up a rival kingdom in the north, he also set up his own religious
system (see 1 Kings 12:25-33). God accused the religious leaders of keeping
the people from knowing him (&quot;destroyed from lack of knowledge&quot;). They were
supposed to be spiritual leaders, but they had become leaders in wrongdoing.
The people may have said to one another, &quot;It must be OK if the priests do it
&quot; Spiritual leadership is a heavy responsibility. Whether you teach a church
school class, hold a church office, or lead a Bible study, do not take your
leadership responsibilities lightly. Be a leader who leads others to God.
But even more so important is the responsibility for believers who can read
and hear to truly study to show themselves approved and rightly dividing the
word of truth. We will be judged by the word of God. If we are going to take
a test or examine, we study to learn the information so we can get it right
on the exam right? It is even more important that we know God for who His
word reveals, so we will not be led astary. It is time we stand up and take
accountability for our relationship with the Lord Jesus. He is always
beckoning us to Come and learn of Him. Will you come today and learn who He
is, not who some man or woman says He is?

Father God is the only one who can move mountains and the prayer of faith is
the only thing that moves Father God. Sis Marcella
Have you believed the lie of Satan (keep him little)? I have good news to
share, the good news is that every lie can be countered by God’s Word.
I want to encourage you today to listen to the truth of God’s Word. Dwell on
the truth, believe it, and act on it.
&quot;Sha-alu Shalom Yerushalayim&quot;

Pray for the Peace of Jerusalem
&quot;The One who came in the Father's name still comes and the One who spoke
still speaks&quot;
True Christian teachings (doctrines) are based on Bible and study; not on
man’s thoughts, ideas, traditions or denominational influences. The Word of
God will confirm the TRUTH!

URGENT PRAYER REQUEST-Entry for November 30, 2007
PLEASE PRAY FOR MY STEP-FATHER ( SMOKEY), HE HAS BEEN SENT HOME FROM THE
HOSPITAL THIS EVENING TO DIE. THE DOCTORS SAID HE HAS A MASS IN HIS LIVER,
AND THEY GAVE HIM 6 MONTHS OR LESS TO LIVE..

THIS MAN HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL HUSBAND TO MY MOTHER, AND A FANTASTIC
FATHER AND GRANDFATHER TO MY BROTHERS, ME AND MY KIDS.. HE HAS BEEN BETTER
TO ME THAN MY OWN FATHER WAS.. I LOVE HIM DEARLY..

LIFT MY MOTHER UP, SHE NEEDS TO BE STRENGTHENED IN EVERY AREA. SHE HAS
NEVER LOST A HUSBAND, SHE DIVORCED A FEW BUT NEVER HAD TO GO THRU THIS..

ALSO I ASK THAT EVERYONE PRAY A SPECIAL PRAYER TO KEEP AWAY CERTAIN
PEOPLE FOR HANGING AROUND MY PARENTS HOME, THAT WILL UPSET THEM, AND TO BIND
ALL POWERS OF DARKNESS FROM EVEN SHOWING UP THERE..

YOU KNOW EVERYBODY KNOWS SOMEBODY WHO NEVER SHOWS UP UNTIL &quot;DEATH&quot; SHOWS
UP, AND THEY SAY ALL THE WRONG THINGS THE WHOLE TIME THEY ARE THERE, AND
THEY NEVER KNOW WHEN TO SHUT-UP. WE KNOW SEVERAL PEOPLE LIKE THIS, AND WANT
GOD TO JUST KEEP THEM AWAY..

ALSO, IF MY DAD NEEDS TO GET ANYTHING I ORDER BEFORE HE MEETS GOD, THAT
GOD REVEAL IT TO HIM WHILE HE IS STILL IN HIS RIGHT MIND.. AND HE SEND THE
RIGHT MINISTER TO HIM WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR IT.

THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY, OUR HEARTS ARE HEAVY. BUT NEVERTHELESS, WE
CAN STILL REJOICE IN THE FACT THAT HE KNOWS THE LORD AS HIS PERSONAL LORD
AND SAVIOR..AMEN.

PLEASE PASS THIS REQUEST ON TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW.

Subject: The Fisherman

Jeremiah 17:10 KJV I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to
give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his
doings.

The first time I met Mr. Costello it was the summer of 1985. My husband had
died in a construction accident the year before and left me with four
children to feed and care for. We lived in a two story house that sat
directly across the street from the entrance to the cancer wing of the
hospital. We lived on the bottom floor and rented the upstairs rooms to
patients who came to receive treatment at the cancer center.

I was preparing dinner for the children and the four renters who lived
upstairs when I heard the doorbell ring. As I opened the door I saw this
very short old man standing there.

&quot;Good afternoon Ma'am,&quot; he said. I couldn't tell if he was smiling or not.
His face looked lopsided because it was swollen and red. He said, &quot;I have
been looking for a place to stay the night till my bus leaves first thing
tomorrow morning. Would you have room for me? I wouldn't mind just sleeping
on this rocking chair here on the porch. I live on the coast and am just
here for today getting treatment for my skin cancer, I won't be any bother
to you.&quot;

As I stood looking at this little stooped over shriveled old man wondering
what to say because all my rooms were full, my heart went out to him.

&quot;I have been looking for the last three hours,&quot; he said, &quot;I guess it's my
face, I know how terrible it looks.&quot;

I said, &quot;If you can wait awhile, after dinner I'll put up a cot in the
children's room for you.&quot;

He let out a sigh of relief and as he thanked me he said, &quot;I'll just sit out
here on the porch for now then.&quot;

I left him on the porch and went back to preparing dinner. When it was ready
I invited him to eat with us but he just held up a wrinkled brown bag and
said, &quot;I've got plenty here I brought with me.&quot;

After cleaning up from dinner and sending the kids off to do their homework
I went out to the porch to talk with Mr. Costello. It was then I learned
what a big heart resided in that tiny body. He said he had been a fisherman
all his life, he said it supported him, his daughter, her five children and
her husband who was disabled from a back injury he sustained at the local
factory which had left him hopelessly crippled. While telling me this, the
smile (I think it was a smile) never left his face. He told me how richly he
had been blessed all his life and how grateful he was there was no pain with
the skin cancer.

He said &quot;I have gotten used to people staring at me and avoiding being
around me.&quot; I apologized for not being able to give him a room for the night
but he just shrugged it off and said, &quot;The cot will be fine and the children
will keep me company, they don't seem to mind how my face looks, the
innocence of children don't look at the outside of people, they are like God
they see what is on the inside of a person.&quot;

The renters came out to the porch for their usual gathering after dinner and
slowly warmed up to Mr. Costello after all they were all in the same
condition, suffering from cancer and of course their treatments usually left
them feeling sick. When they asked Mr. Costello about his treatments and why
he did not suffer or have pain he proceeded to give a very moving testimony
of how he had come to know Jesus twenty years ago and since that time how
Jesus had provided for him and his family.

Twenty years ago he said, &quot;While out fishing I was trying to bring in the
net which was quite heavy with fish and I tripped on some rope lying on the
deck and fell overboard. Being a small man even back then and not a very
good swimmer I figured when I couldn't reach anything on the boat to pull
myself up that since there was no one around to help me I was a goner. I
called out to God to save me.&quot;

He stopped talking for a minute until Mr. Johnson one of the renters asked
him, &quot;What happened then?&quot;

&quot;The side of the boat started tipping towards me and I felt myself being
lifted up till I could reach the side of the boat. I knew without a doubt
that it was the hand of God that had saved me and I have given my life to
him ever since. Though I have suffered many trials since that day I have
learned to be content in all circumstances since I have also received many
blessings. God has always provided all of my needs and I have learned there
is a blessing in every trial. We just have to learn how to endure through
the trials and give thanks to God for everything that happens to us in this
life for I have learned that the only thing we can take with us into the
next life is the love we share and give to others God puts in our path as we
make our way thru our trials.&quot;

Mr. Johnson's wife Nellie spoke up and asked,&quot;Mr. Costello, why do you think
God allows terrible things like cancer to ravage our bodies and cause us
such pain?&quot;

&quot;Ms. Nellie,&quot; he said, &quot;every farmer knows that it is in the valley that
things grow the best and it is on the mountain top that things do not grow
well. If all our experiences in life were mountain top experiences we would
never grow and learn the lessons in life we need to know. Because of man's
pride and arrogance there are many who will not come to God unless he is
brought to his knees and to the understanding that God is the only one who
can save him.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; said Nellie. &quot;Now if you don't mind my asking, why do you
think God put someone with such a big heart like yourself in such a small
body?&quot;

Mr. Costello laughed lightly and said, &quot;Do you know the children's story of
the ugly duckling? I believe God knew I wouldn't mind starting off in life,
in fact needed to start off my life in this small body to become what I
shall be when He takes me home.&quot;

Now whenever I see a beautiful swan I think of Mr. Costello and how tall and
beautiful he must look as he stands around the throne of God. I believe Mr.
Costello planted many seeds in his life and there were many souls who came
to know Jesus because of his testimony.

Messages in this topic (1) 15. Aid for Sidr Victims! Posted by: &quot;shankar sikder&quot; shankarsikder@yahoo.com Mon Dec 3, 2007 8:48 am (PST) Humanitarian Aid for SIDR Victims – Bangladesh!

It was the evening of 15 November 2007, a terrible moment, Cyclone Sidr hit Bangladesh. As of 30 November, the Government of Bangladesh (GoB) official reports indicated that more than 8.5 million people were affected by Cyclone Sidr, with a death toll of 3,268 people, with a further 872 missing and 39,773 injured. Material damage is severe, with over 563,877 houses destroyed and a further 885,280 houses were partially damaged. The GoB estimates more than 2 million acres of crops are damaged. Over 1,252,344 livestock are confirmed killed, which represents loss of critical household assets, with an associated loss to wealth and income, as well as a loss in milk production for own consumption. Extensive damage to roads and public buildings was also reported, including 2,287 educational institutions destroyed and another 12,343 partially damaged. The twelve most affected areas include Bagerhat, Barguna, Barisal, Bhola, Gopalgonj, Jhalkhati, Khulna,
Mandaripur, Patuakhali, Pirojpur, Satkhira and Shariatpur districts.

It is assumed that the actual calculation of dead, destruction and damages may be much more than the above which rises with every passing hour. Of the total lives lost to Sidr, 40 percent are believed to be children. Many of the children that have survived are now orphans. Children under five, pregnant women, new mothers and the elderly are the people most seriously affected. Thousands of people living under the open sky are still suffering from food, clothes, shelter, medicine, household kits, blankets, soap, kitchen equipment, construction materials, drinking water etc.

Blessings For Humanity (BFH) is now on the ground to stay beside the affected people with the blessings of God. You may survive at least one and may be more. This is high time to reach God’s blessings to the distress people. A little contribution from you may save lots of suffering lives - especially for children and women!
