This part sounds wonderful.  I'm hoping it can all work out.

Baxter was head-shy when I first got him.  I don't think he was ever
truly beaten, but I do think he was roughly handled.  I still remember
how he'd flinch when I'd reach near his head.

You and Homer are in our thoughts.

and Baxter

I'm sure it's stressful for both of you.  I agree agression is not to be
tolerated but not knowing where he comes from and what he's been through
it's to be expected that there may be some bumpy roads for a while.

Take a big deep breath and relax you'll do ok it's just going to take some
time is all.

I went through a lot of the same stuff when Buddy came into the house.  We
had no idea what his previous life was like but we knew he was abused.  I've
never seen a dog so scared of a raised hand like he was.  There's been some
scuffles with Lady, some growling at the cats and Buddys had a few attitude
adjustments in the process.  Nothing severe as a beating like he'd recieved
in the past but some really strong scoldings and a quick whack on the nose
one time he growled at me.

Now I still don't trust him with strangers and I never will you can just see
the fear in him anytime someone strange comes around.  He's to apt to bite
so the first thing I tell everyone is don't touch the dog.  With us he's a
big baby now but it's take a year of working to gain his trust.  I even got
to cut one of his nails last week and he didn't so much as give me a growl.
In the end it's all worked out and he's a wonderful dog it's just takes some
work is all.

&gt; i'm really disappointed in myself, because i wigged out on him for it,
&gt; but i just have NO tolerence for human-aggression in my dogs, and i
&gt; don't care if he's new or if he's old.

&gt; he was not in a situation that was especially overwhelming. i took him
&gt; by the collar to lead him to his crate, and he whipped around and put
&gt; teeth on my arm. he didn't break skin, but damn he's ugly when he
&gt; bares his teeth and snarls.

&gt; i put him in his crate until i calmed down enough to not do anything
&gt; else stupid.

&gt; i think he's either got neck pain or some serious bad history with
&gt; having his collar grabbed. which makes me feel really bad about how i
&gt; reacted (with lots of shock and anger).

&gt; i got him out then and felt him all over and couldn't elicit a pain
&gt; response, but that doesn't mean it's not there. i put mushroom's
&gt; harness on him, and i'll see if that makes any kind of difference. if
&gt; it does, i'll buy him a decent, comfortable harness and put his tags
&gt; on that so nobody grabs his collar.

&gt; i feel like i failed him bigtime tonight.

&gt; (he's doing great with the dogs though, and they're doing well with
&gt; him. he even went up to luce and playbowed this afternoon. and he's
&gt; figured out the deck steps.)

I'm not sure you should be.  Maybe it's because I'm used to dogs that'll
keep pushing barriers just to find the limits (if any), but the bottom line
is that Homer did something completely unacceptable (for whatever good and
justified reason) and discovered that, yes, there is an upper boundary
beyond which his new human gets a bit testy.  That's a good thing for a dog
of any age to learn.

Well, see, you learned something valuable.  Homer learned something
valuable.  It's all good.  Neither of you will need to repeat this
particular lesson.  I hope so, anyway.

Have I mentioned that I recently met THE most adorable cow dog pup at the
dog park.  I've never found the adult version to be particularly attractive,
but this little turkey is adorable.  And feisty.  Fearless too, which is a
good thing, 'cause his big sister is a Pit mix (with flying nun ears), and
she looks and sounds utterly scary when playing.

That's a valid concern, but you've done all you can to mitigate the
consequences of what was, after all, a simple error.  Dogs are pretty
resilient and forgiving, for the most part.  You're going to be beating
yourself up about this long after Homer's put it out of his mind.
