Sigmund Freud changed our perception permanently when he suggested and
made valid the idea that perhaps all of our behavior was not the direct
effect of conscious mind functioning. But he came to these conclusions
with the conscious mind, and like all pioneers he misinterpreted a few
aspects of the system and origin of this focused consciousness. He set
into motion the idea that the id was responsible for some of our more
negative or animalistic drives and desires, and that these desires
sprang from the unconscious. But the id or animalistic drives are the
effect of the preoccupation with ego and physical material focus and
the discounting of the spiritual or higher self (Neptune). The effect
then is the idea that the physical self is all there is or at least, is
the "real" self, where personality and identity spring from. The idea
of an individual identity is in itself an archetype and produces
conscious awareness as the effect of specificity and focus. This
bi-product or persona (meaning mask or false face) is an artificial
construct designed as an interface to manifest the entire self in
physicality, and is an aspect or facet of the oversoul or higher self,
not arising from animalistic "Id" drives.
I redirected this idea in my text on self-empowerment with a positive
reversal of the consciousness triangle:

http://www.astroconsulting.com/FAQs/marsand.htm

As we move in from the Oort cloud at the outer reaches of the solar
system, planets become more defined and crystallized. Focus becomes
more prominent, and identity takes on the idea of separateness from
the "ALL". The vast expanse of the universe is ignored for the sake of
specific expression. There is now us and others, time and space, the
world of polarity pairs (Aries through Gemini).

Through the natural zodiac, astrology reveals that Mars, Aries and the
natural first house are the effect of time and space. A distinct point
in time and space establishes conscious awareness at any given moment.
The birth of any idea into physical reality establishes consciousness
and awareness singularity and the drive to manifest whatever ideas are
inherent in the "birth". When time and space(1) are "divided up" (the
solstice and equinox) in such a manner the illusion of separateness
creates an identity which must manifest its specific conceptual
expression. This is known as the ego.

Mars, Aries and the first house reflect this need and belief to prove,
validate, and manifest the idea that you are. Self-empowerment and
integrity is the recognition that you are as powerful as you need to
be to manifest the idea you are, without having to hurt yourself or
anyone else in order to manifest it. And that the you you are is not
really all you are (Neptune). This is the positive expression of Mars.
Action as the conviction of belief. Action is taken as the effect of a
recognition of integrity and that the "ALL" knows what it is doing by
focusing on this singular idea through you. An idea manifesting in
integrity is moved to action by unifying, inspirational, constructive
and expansive energy in recognition of its connection with all else.
Negative expression or dis-empowered behavior re-acts to perceived
threats and to the validity of the idea you are being at any given
moment. Action is taken in defense against the "external" and is
segregating, separative, limiting and constrictive. Fear (Saturn) is
the motivating factor. The belief in thwartation by another idea, and
experiencing the negative effects of some other reality, are the signs
of the dis-eased Mars and unhealthy ego.

It is easy to see from the above definitions that Natural aggression
would be the product of simply acting on what you are capable of
acting upon that it inspires you to do with integrity (self-empowered
behavior). Unnatural aggression is the effect of fear, doubt,
insecurity, repression and NOT acting with integrity and conviction on
your beliefs (powerless behavior).

The first consideration in ego health is Mars' sign placement and
motion. Next is aspect networks, and finally, house placement,
dipositorship and elevation. This psychological health will always be
tied to the early environment and parental structure as shown by the
first, fourth, seventh and tenth houses and their rulers. A retrograde
Mars is a sure indicator of an early environment of repression,
restriction and disbelief in the natural assertion of the self without
guilt. This has been hypothesized as a carryover of guilt from past
life actions. The belief in protection and manipulation may also be
evident. This almost inevitably leads to temperamentally based actions
that cause trouble at some time in the life, with regard to sign and
house placement of the Mars in question. At 0 degrees of a sign, Mars
so placed will reflect hesitation, insecurity and procrastination. At
29 degrees of a sign, temperament may be out of control and needs
immediate attention. Either way the ego is in an acute and precarious
status from the belief the identity is out of control.

A general guide to sign placement is as follows;

ARIES or 1st house Mars is at home and exhibits its most free flowing
natural aggression. Unless aspects are complicated, expression is
spontaneous. The need to prove the self is ardent and unrepressed.
Regardless, the ego is vital and spirited. If the aspects are
developmentally tense, there can be accidents. Without strategy and
control there is recklessness and belligerence.

TAURUS or 2nd house Mars in Taurus may have some inertia. The need to
prove the self ideally can come through values promotion. However, it
usually comes through possessions. There is a tendency to try to force
obstacles or situations into submission. The ego moves slowly and
deliberately out of a need to maintain the status quo. Self
orientation because of unsureness resists objective evaluations. The
need to prove self worth.

GEMINI or 3rd house The need to prove the intelligence and agility
inclines toward movement both physically and mentally. Sense
perceptions are acute and active. Whether they are accurate or not can
be determined by aspect networks. Generally if the temperament takes
over, defensiveness is expressed through unnecessary argument. If
positive the application of the intellect can be powerful. Too much
diversion is the danger.

CANCER or 4th house Mars is in its fall in Cancer. Emotional security
needs trip application up. There is the desire to know outcomes before
action is taken. Defensiveness is worn on the sleeve. This is one of
the positions that indicates extreme difficulty in healthy ego
formation. Being powerless is anticipated. The early environment
taught the individual to not trust the self. Mountains are made of
molehills and a false bravado fools no one but the self. The need to
prove that the identity is secure and can handle things-- something
most take for granted. Threats are seen where none exist.(2)

LEO or 5th house The need to prove the self dramatically and
forcefully inclines toward self centered energy application. The ego
is healthy if aspects are moderate, but arrogance is a sure sign of
insecurity. The identity will feel best when creating and performing.
When positive the higher ground is taken. There is enormous potential
for creative prowess.

VIRGO or 6th house Virgo does not incline toward spontaneity. This
position has a negative possibility of judgment complicating action,
or positively, heightening analytical accuracy. Details-- it is
believed-- can trip the identity up. The rest of the chart, especially
the Sun/Moon blend, must be considered carefully.

LIBRA or 7th house Mars is in its detriment in Libra, and for good
reason. The ego's health and need to prove the self are based on
social acceptance. I'll be whatever you like. There is so much
distrust in the self that a stand of opinion may be non-existent. No
one can be all things to all people. Thoroughness of exploration and
application can be diluted when others have control over the idea that
you are. Distinction comes not through mediocrity.

SCORPIO or 8th house Water signs bring much emotion to assertion which
does not lend itself to unencumbered natural aggression. Defensiveness
can arise out of the fear of being taken advantage of. Other's worth
is a threat. The intensity in Scorpio stems from a need to feel
emotionally significant and impactual and obsessiveness is not a sign
of a feeling of empowerment. However, if the rest of the chart shows
more objectivity and ease, this energy could be applied to passive
power and self control. The two most difficult aspects to master in
self-empowerment.

SAGITTARIUS or 9th house Mars in Fire signs (and to a lesser extent
Air signs) is an automatic reflection of a closer alignment with
natural aggression. The need to prove the self though the acceptance
of its ideas and opinions by others however lends itself to placing
the power outside the self. The condition of Mars and the rest of the
chart must be inspected carefully. There might be a blurring and
exaggeration effect as the mind and ego seek to have the overwhelming
final word and opinion. There is more strategy and less zeal needed.

CAPRICORN or 10th house Here we find the ego that has little internal
battle going on. Mars is exalted in Capricorn. Capricorn is a cardinal
sign so action is not sacrificed. It is the element Earth so utility
is important. The need to prove and apply the self is through diligent
application. Just the thing that will be effective in manifesting to
the fullest extent the idea that you are. Every idea has the right to
strategically and effectively express itself just because it exists.

AQUARIUS or 11th house This ego is searching for validity by being
different or unique. Health

Edmond could plead stupidity, but the courts would probably take a
very dim view of such a waste of their time.
