K-WHAT? Unbuilt Maui TV station lands questionable call letters

THE call letters KUNT have landed at a yet-unbuilt low-power digital
television station in Wailuku, Maui.

Alarmingly similar to a word the dictionary says is obscene, the call
letters were among a 15-page list of new call letters issued by the
Federal Communications Commission and released this week.

The same station owner also received KWTF for a station in Arizona.

From Skokie, Ill., comes a sincere apology &quot;to anyone that was
offended,&quot; said Kevin Bae, vice president of KM Communications Inc., who
requested and received KUNT and KWTF. It is &quot;extremely embarrassing for
me and my company and we will file to change those call letters
immediately.&quot;

He thanked your columnist for bringing the matter to his attention and
pledged to, &quot;make sure I don't fall asleep on the job when selecting
call signs again.&quot;

One might understand how Bae's eyes could glaze over during selection,
as KM has some 80 sets of call letters and alpha-numeric callsigns for
TV and radio stations in several states.

No KM station is yet on the air in Hawaii but its mainland TV stations
carry programming from America One Network, My Network TV and the CW.

The call letter snafu was a source of great mirth for Bae's attorney.

&quot;I can't tell you how long he laughed at me when he learned of my
gaffe,&quot; Bae said.

Broadcasters for generations have joked among themselves about call
letters resembling off-color words or acronyms knowing the FCC would
never approve their assignment -- but that was before computerization.

KCUF-FM near Aspen, Colo. got its F-word-in-reverse call letters in
August of 2005 and has been on the air since December, &quot;Keeping Colorado
Uniquely Free,&quot; its Web site says. Uh, yeah.

Station officials could not be reached, but the automated pop-music
slinger has been written about twice in the Aspen Daily News. The paper
said radio regulators &quot;blessed the call letters.&quot;

However, assignment of call letters actually is an automated process,
according to Mary Diamond of the FCC's Office of Media Relations.
Broadcasters use the FCC Web site to request and receive call letters
with no oversight from Beavis, his partner, or any FCC regulator.

Dude, seriously. Even after years of concerns over broadcast indecency
and the debate about fines for fleeting profanities that hit the air.

The Code of Federal Regulations allows applicants to request call
letters of their choice as long as the combination is available.
Further, &quot;objections to the assignment of requested call signs will not
be entertained at the FCC,&quot; it states.

So, perhaps this legend that has been around forever is not true. Allegedly,
The University of Nebraska had once applied for a TV license, and, being
west of the Mississippi, were denied call letters that would represent
&quot;University of Nebraska Television&quot;...

What sort of hole in the ground is Wailuku? Someone's put themselves
into a box, and it's probably a pretty tight fit.

I used to work for a radio station in Los Angeles.  They called themselves
