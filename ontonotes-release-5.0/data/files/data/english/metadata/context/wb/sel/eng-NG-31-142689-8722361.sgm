War and the &quot;New World Order&quot;

by Mahdi Darius Nazemroaya

Global Research,
August 29, 2007

&quot;We are now at the year 1908, which was the year that the Carnegie
Foundation began operations.  And, in that year, the trustees meeting, for
the first time, raised a specific question, which they discussed throughout
the balance of the year, in a very learned fashion.  And the question is
this:  Is there any means known more effective than war, assuming you wish
to alter the life of an entire people?  And they conclude that, no more
effective means to that end is known to humanity, than war.  So then, in
1909, they raise the second question, and discuss it, namely, how do we
involve the United States in a war?&quot;

-Norman Dobbs, U.S. Congressional Special Committee for the Investigate of
Tax-Exempt Foundations (1982)

War is the ultimate means of attempting to change societies and reshape
nations. It is through war that national economies and political structures
can be forcibly restructured. War is, potentially, the ultimate economic
shock therapy. The wars in the Middle East are stepping stones towards
establishing a vision of global order that has been in the hearts and minds
of the Anglo-American establishment for years. That vision is global
ascendancy.

Towards the &quot;New International Order&quot; through the &quot;Global War on Terror&quot;

&quot;There is a chance for the President of the United States [George W. Bush
Jr.] to use this disaster [meaning the attacks of September 11, 2001] to
carry out what his father.a phrase his father [George H. Bush Sr.] used I
think only once, and it hasn't been used since . and that is a new world
order. Think about this. We already have the support of NATO in a remarkable
historic departure.&quot;

-Gary Hart, National Security in the 21st Century: Findings of the
Hart-Rudman Commission (September 14, 2007)

On January 18, 2005 Henry Kissinger appeared on Charlie Rose, a television
program on PBS, and talked about a &quot;New International Order&quot; being created
by George W. Bush Jr. and his administration. [1] Henry Kissinger stated
that within the next few years that humanity will see the emergence of the
beginning of a &quot;New International Order.&quot; Kissinger also stated that the
Bush Jr. Administration could bring about this state; &quot;and it could well be
this president, [meaning President Bush Jr.] that is so reviled by
intellectuals, will emerge as one of the seminal presidents of .of this.of
this period.of American modern history.&quot; [2]

When asked what George W. Bush Jr. has to do to bring about this &quot;New
International Order&quot; by his interviewer Kissinger paused and gave a vague
answer that avoided mentioning the criminality of war. &quot;He has to do some
certain things and he has to have some luck,&quot; Kissinger answered followed by
&quot;Luck is the residue of design.&quot; [3] It should be noted that if luck is a
residue of design then it is no longer chance, but a calculation of intent.

Briefly the role of the American public was talked about by Charlie Rose
with Kissinger who paused to pick his words carefully. Kissinger told his
interviewer, Rose, that the United States is a nation whose public has no
clue about American foreign policy. [4] In regards to the American public,
the war agenda cannot move forward if the U.S. maintains its multi-cultural
characteristics. It was this multi-cultural characteristic that initially
presented the U.S. a problem in declaring war on Germany in both World Wars
until the sinking of the RMS Lusitania and the Japanese attack on Pearl
Harbour. [5]

Thus, an end to a liberal North American immigration regime that ensures a
multi-cultural environment in North America is a prerequisite to expanded
American war(s). Zbigniew Brzezinski has written that &quot;as America becomes an
increasingly multi-cultural society, it may find it more difficult to
fashion a consensus on foreign policy issues [amongst the American people],
except in the circumstance of a truly massive and widely perceived direct
external threat.&quot; [6] The E.U. is also beginning to follow suit. This
premise by Brzezinski, an individual from within the ruling establishment of
America, can be used to explain the demonization of Muslims and several
national and ethno-cultural groups such as Arabs, Turks, and Iranians.

It is also worth noting that Gary Hart, a former U.S. senator from Colorado,
implied on September 14 of 2001 that the &quot;Global War on Terror&quot; sponsored by
the Bush Jr. Administration was a pretext for establishing the so-called
&quot;New World Order.&quot; [7] Gary Hart also implicated NATO's role in shaping this
&quot;New World Order.&quot; [8] The project is to be implemented by military might.

A Unipolar World: Pax Americana?

&quot;However, what is a unipolar world? However one might embellish this term,
at the end of the day it refers to one type of situation, namely one centre
of authority, one centre of force, one centre of decision-making.&quot;

-Vladimir Putin at the Munich Conference on Security Policy in Germany
(February 11, 2007)

During his interview, with Charlie Rose, Henry Kissinger had referred to
what George H. Bush Sr. identified as the &quot;New World Order.&quot; This was a term
frequently used by the former American president that became famous during
the Gulf War. With the end of the Cold War and the defeat of Iraq in the
Gulf War, Georgia H. Bush Sr. said that humanity in 1991 was witness to the
emergence of a &quot;New World Order&quot; that would be led by America. [9] The Gulf
War was merely the beginning of this &quot;New World Order.&quot; The seeds had been
planted in the Middle East for future wars and Eurasian expansion.

The Trilateral Commission, an organization founded in 1973 and consisting of
the wealthiest and most powerful elites from the U.S., the E.U., and Japan,
originally created the term that George H. Bush Sr. drew on. Their word was
&quot;New International Economic Order.&quot; The Trilateral Commission's terminology
lays bare the economic fabric of this program. Military might is merely the
enforcer of foreign policy, and foreign policy is based on economic
interests.

An agenda of perpetual warfare and violence has been fueling the march
towards global domination through economic means. In essence this war agenda
has been an unbroken process watched over by the different presidential
administrations of the United States.

Stepping forth from behind the Curtains: NATO's Role in the Eurasian Roadmap

&quot;The policies of the U.S., since the end of the Cold War are complicated and
vast. They involve an intent to dominate and the use of international
organizations to advance U.S. economic and geopolitical interests. They also
include the conversion of NATO into a surrogate military police force for
globalization and U.S. world economic domination.&quot;

-Ramsey Clark, 66th United States Attorney-General (October 6, 2000)

NATO has started replicating long-term American war tactics and strategy.
NATO is creating a rapid response force, which involves a significant German
role. The force is modeled on the U.S. Rapid Response Force, the forerunner
of CENTCOM, and has a global reach. The transformation of the U.S. Rapid
Deployment Force into CENTCOM was part of long-term Anglo-American war
plans. The NATO force is projected to be able to deploy to any region in the
world within five days and planned to be capable of self-sufficient,
detached operations for approximately one month. The force will also have
land, sea, and air components, including an aircraft carrier. [10]

It is apparent that control over Iraq was planned during the culmination of
the Cold War by Anglo-American policy makers.  The series of wars that have
occurred since the Iraq-Iran War are debatably the products of a historical
Anglo-American project in the Middle East- a project that was once a solely
British project that predated the Cold War. The project to reshape and
control the Middle East is part of the greater project to control Eurasia.
Just as how this grand project was embraced by the U.S., as the inheritor of
British strategy, the project has been embraced by the Franco-German entente
and NATO. Zbigniew Brzezinski argued in 1997 that &quot;Europe is America's
essential geopolitical bridgehead in Eurasia,&quot; or an entry point towards
dominating Eurasia. [11]

From the statements and goals of U.S. officials going back to the 1990s NATO
was projected to expand across the Eurasian landmass and set to embrace
Japan, South Korea, and Australia in what Zbigniew Brzezinski identifies as
the &quot;trans-Eurasian security system.&quot; [12] The characteristics of
prospective conflicts seem to be slated to become dominated by NATO as
France and Germany expand their roles in the &quot;long war.&quot; NATO's role in the
Eastern Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, Lebanon, and
Afghanistan, along with NATO's thrust into the post-Soviet niche and inner
Eurasia, are all precarious indications of this.

Making Europe the Partner of America in the &quot;Long War:&quot; Enter the
Franco-German Entente

&quot;The victory over Iraq [in the Gulf War] was not waged as 'a war to end all
wars.' Even the 'New World Order' cannot guarantee an era of perpetual
peace.&quot;

-George H. Bush Sr., 41st President of the United States (March 6, 1991)

Brzezinski explained that although Japan was important to American
geo-strategy, Europe as a geopolitical entity (via the E.U. and NATO)
constitutes America's bridgehead into Eurasia. [13] &quot;Unlike America's links
with Japan, NATO entrenches American political influence and military power
on the Eurasian mainland,&quot; and that &quot;the allied European nations [were]
still highly dependent on U.S. protection, any expansion of Europe's
political scope is automatically an expansion of U.S. influence,&quot; Brzezinski
explained in regards to Europe and Japan. [14] Brzezinski was paying

For those who don't know, Chertoff is a Zionist Jew from New Jersey home of
the Israeli spy ring.
http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/12/18/224826.shtml
That same network was spying the on the patsies before 9/11
http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2002/05/07/students/index_np....

Did Chertoff lie to Congress about Guantánamo?

by Mark Benjamin

Global Research, August 29, 2007

He told the Senate that Pentagon interrogation methods were &quot;plain vanilla,&quot;
but e-mails reveal his top staff met weekly with FBI officials who said they
were torture.
Aug. 28, 2007 | Attorney General Alberto Gonzales will leave office Sept. 17
with a reputation for being untruthful. During his repeated appearances
before Congress earlier this year to explain the firing of eight U.S.
attorneys, Gonzales answered &quot;I don't recall&quot; or some variation as many as
70 times at a sitting. When his replacement comes to Capitol Hill for
confirmation, lawmakers hope they will hear nothing but the truth.

But one of the men most often mentioned as his replacement may have some of
the same trouble with the truth. Since rumors of Gonzales' departure
surfaced last week, speculation about his successor has centered on Michael
Chertoff, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Just as
Gonzales, under oath before Congress, failed to recall whether there was
dissension within the Bush administration over a controversial
war-on-terror-related policy, so Michael Chertoff seems to have suffered a
similar lapse of memory while under oath before Congress when pressed on a
different terror-related policy. Gonzales pleaded ignorance of a rift within
the administration over warrantless wiretapping; Chertoff has denied
knowledge of interrogation techniques that are tantamount to torture,
despite regular attendance by his top aides at meetings on the subject.

&quot;If Mr. Chertoff is nominated, the Senate needs to ask him some very tough
questions about what he knew about the abuses at Guantánamo,&quot; said Hina
Shamsi from Human Rights First.

When Chertoff appeared before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs on Feb. 2, 2005, the subject was not interrogations.
The panel was weighing Chertoff's nomination to his current post as
secretary of homeland security. He was promptly confronted on the topic,
however, by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. Levin's staff had dug up copies of
curious FBI e-mail traffic about interrogations at the Guantánamo prison in
2002 and 2003, when Chertoff was head of the criminal division at the
Department of Justice.

That was a pivotal year at the military prison. The Pentagon was
institutionalizing a brutal interrogation program approved by then-Secretary
of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Interrogation teams at the prison employed
forced nudity, sleep deprivation, isolation and sexual humiliation, among
other tactics. During that time, for example, a detainee named Mohammed
al-Kahtani was forced to stand naked in front of a female interrogator, to
wear women's underwear, and to perform &quot;dog tricks&quot; on a leash. He was
interrogated for 18 to 20 hours on 48 out of 54 consecutive days.

FBI interrogators assigned to Guantánamo had balked at the methods employed
by the DOD. Given its long institutional knowledge about legal and effective
interrogations, the FBI thought the military interrogations were extremely
problematic. E-mail strings documenting the FBI's objections have been well
publicized.

At the February 2005 hearing, Levin questioned Chertoff about an e-mail
obtained by Levin's staff: a May 10, 2004, communication from one FBI
official, with the name redacted, to another FBI official, T.J. Harrington.
The e-mail rehashes the FBI objections to the military interrogations at
Guantánamo back in 2002.

That FBI e-mail discusses the bureau's concerns at some length. It also
divulges weekly meetings with officials from the Justice Department's
criminal division, in which &quot;we often discussed DOD techniques and how they
were not effective or producing intel that was reliable.&quot; Chertoff was the
head of the DOJ's criminal division from 2001 until the spring of 2003. The
e-mail says that four people from the department's criminal division
attended those meetings and that those attendees &quot;all agreed DOD tactics
were going to be an issue&quot; if the government tried to prosecute Guantánamo
prisoners. In the copy of the e-mail obtained by Levin, the names of those
four criminal division officials had been redacted.

Under questioning from Levin that day in 2005, Chertoff disavowed any
knowledge of abusive interrogation techniques being employed at Guantánamo
and said he was unaware of those meetings. &quot;I was not aware during my tenure
at the Department of Justice that there were practices at Guantánamo, if
there were practices at Guantánamo, that would be torture or anything even
approaching torture,&quot; Chertoff told Levin. He told the committee he was
unaware of &quot;any use of techniques in Guantánamo that were anything other
than what I would describe as kind of plain vanilla ... I do not know what
the meetings being referred to are, what the techniques are being referred
to, and who the people are.&quot;

Chertoff was sworn in to the Homeland Security post on Feb. 15, 2005, two
weeks after the back-and-forth with Levin.

A month later, after pressuring the Justice Department, Levin obtained
another version of the same FBI e-mail describing meetings about torture. It
still contained redactions, but it does list the names of the DOJ criminal
division officials who attended the meetings with the FBI. One of them was
Alice Fisher, Chertoff's top deputy. Chertoff's counsel, David Nahmias, also
attended, as did two other senior criminal division officials, Bruce Swartz
and Laura Parsky. Swartz, the e-mail showed, had relayed the FBI's concerns
to the Defense Department's Office of the General Counsel. (The e-mail is
reproduced on page 2 of this article.)

If some of Chertoff's top staff were involved in weekly meetings in which
&quot;the DOD techniques&quot; were discussed, it remains unclear how he could be
totally unaware of any of those discussions. &quot;The secretary always testifies
truthfully,&quot; said Laura Keehner, a DHS spokeswoman.

Other close observers of these developments are not so sure. &quot;Either he lied
to Congress or he is a very out-of-the-loop manager of the division,&quot; said
Caroline Fredrickson, legislative director of the ACLU. &quot;It smacks of
Alberto Gonzales saying he did not know anything about these U.S. attorney
firings.&quot;

And if Chertoff is nominated, it is also unclear how much this questionable
history will matter when he faces another Senate hearing. &quot;This is
unresolved,&quot; Fredrickson said, &quot;which means Congress needs to resolve it.&quot;
