It has always been very clear "what it is", you even participated in it.
It is an agenda to stop me from having business, suceeding with my work

Yes, that is all fine and dandy, and I must say she has more courage
than the cowards that hide in aam, and she has been faithful to helping
those interested in astrology. Now, that having been said, and me not
afraid to tell the truth like some of you here, she also contributes to
trying to stop me and my companies from rightfully participating here,
and tells newbies they "should" go to aam where they will get better
answers. She purposely violates the charter of the moderated group just
to try to punish and limit me as well. This is not in integrity and my
answers are just as good if not better than any you will ever find in

I have far out"patienced Keera" especially since none of these assholes
ever attack her for her views, which are NOT seasoned or wise very
often. I on the other hand have even had to put up with you whining to
spinics to put up websites to denigrate me and my companies, which I
will never forget. There was another alternative to this 9 years of
bullshit, ya know, and that was for real astrologers to pull themselves
up by the boostraps, send complaints in unison and CRUSH the fucking
abusers, but they chose to abandon ship instead--all because they "can't
handle the truth!"
Now all of these past 9 years would have been a harmless "flame war" as
you call instead of pitting me against all the abusers... except for one
small factor:
These stalking freaks did not count on me being the most determined and
persistant person on the planet.
And I will completely crush them off this group if its the last thing I
ever do.

Yes - you could have simply killfiled people and not drawn a whole lot
of attention to the group with your great sci.skepitc cross post wars so

&gt; Ooh, bashing someone using astrology! How spiritual of you.

&gt;&gt;No guts.

&gt; Oh, I have guts. My IBS tells me so.

&gt;&gt;Misery and stupidity love company.

&gt; We know, dear. That's why you can't leave alt.astrology. You need the
&gt; company.

&gt;&gt;Very simple. Why you all can't see your OWN mindlessness and
&gt;&gt;lack of practicing what you preach (preaching about &quot;kindness&quot;,
&gt;&gt;courtesy, etc. whilst harassing persons for years on end) should be of
&gt;&gt;more concern to you.

&gt; I never preach about &quot;kindness&quot;. I prefer to preach about parties.

&gt;&gt;Never mind all that, this is the primary reason why I don't care to
&gt;&gt;even TRY to talk to you idiots

&gt; But you will type long replies to us.

&gt;&gt;and will forever just post my articles
&gt;&gt;without interacting with any of you,

&gt; Dang, another irony meter busted.

&gt;&gt;because I do, NOT prefer it, do
&gt;&gt;NOT have time or the inclination for this endless tit for tat shit that
&gt;&gt;goes on for eternity.

&gt; Good thing my irony meter was already busted. You're on a roll! Mars in
&gt; Capricorn doing you good, huh.

&gt;&gt;If you don't like me, DON'T READ MY POSTS OR DEAL WITH ME. That will be
&gt;&gt;exactly why I ignore you.

&gt; Look, irony meter's busted, OK, so you can stop now.

&gt;&gt;I gave everyone here the benefit of the doubt, now there is NO doubt of
&gt;&gt;your irrelevance to me and my life.

&gt; Sorry, what'd you say? I was busy fixing my irony meter.

That's a rather pathetic goal. Your life goal is to "crush" people who make

&gt;&gt; &gt; You own nothing on Usenet.  No one posting to Usenet can lay claim to a

&gt;&gt; &gt; [...]

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I am not going to killfile legally actionable information and just act
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;like it is not there.  I am documenting all of it for a time that will
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;surely come.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Yada, yada, yada, yada....

&gt;&gt; &gt; You won't file any suits, Edmo -- ever: you do not have the case, the
&gt;&gt; &gt; 'evidence', enough cash to retain an attorney (and none will take
&gt;&gt; &gt; something
&gt;&gt; &gt; so speculative on a contingency basis) or the balls to try.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Which reminds me...

&gt;&gt; &gt; What happened to that torte claim against SDSU?

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Yes, that is all fine and dandy, and I must say she has more courage
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;than the cowards that hide in aam,

&gt;&gt; &gt; Jealousy that you cannot post to aamod, inspite of your many attempts,
&gt;&gt; &gt; noted.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;and she has been faithful to helping those interested in astrology.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Now, that having been said, and me not afraid to tell the truth like
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;some of you here, she also contributes to trying to stop me and my
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;companies from rightfully participating here, and tells newbies they
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;should&quot; go to aam where they will get better answers.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I admire her candor and honesty.  Newbies certainly need to be warned
&gt;&gt; &gt; against you and your antics.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;She purposely violates the charter of the moderated group just
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;to try to punish and limit me as well.

&gt;&gt; &gt; So you must have agreed to be punished and limited on some level.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;This is not in integrity and my answers are just as good if not better
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;than any you will ever find in aam.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Your integrity is nonexistent and your answers are a load of self-
&gt;&gt; &gt; aggrandizing sewage.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I have far out&quot;patienced Keera&quot; especially since none of these assholes
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ever attack her for her views,

&gt;&gt; &gt; That might be that Keera is very pleasant person.  She's kind,
&gt;&gt; &gt; respectful,
&gt;&gt; &gt; witty, modest yet not timid -- you, on the other hand, are nasty,
&gt;&gt; &gt; condescending, humourless and arrogant.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;which are NOT seasoned or wise very often.

&gt;&gt; &gt; ...and she knows more of astrology than you do.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;I on the other hand have even had to put up with you whining to
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;spinics to put up websites to denigrate me and my companies, which I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;will never forget.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Oh yeah?  You will never do anything about it, though.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;There was another alternative to this 9 years of bullshit, ya know,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;and that was for real astrologers to pull themselves up by the
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;boostraps, send complaints in unison and CRUSH the fucking abusers,
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;but they chose to abandon ship instead--all because they &quot;can't handle
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;the truth!&quot;

&gt;&gt; &gt; I think a better explanation is that other astrologers saw what a
&gt;&gt; &gt; petty,
&gt;&gt; &gt; bullshit asshole you are and decided, to their credit, not to get
&gt;&gt; &gt; involved
&gt;&gt; &gt; with you.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Now all of these past 9 years would have been a harmless &quot;flame war&quot; as
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;you call instead of pitting me against all the abusers... except for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;one
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;small factor:
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;These stalking freaks did not count on me being the most determined and
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;persistant person on the planet.
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;And I will completely crush them off this group if its the last thing I
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;ever do.

&gt;&gt; &gt; What a mission in life!  Yup, Edmo, Mother Theresa had nothing on you
&gt;&gt; &gt; for
&gt;&gt; &gt; the nobility of her cause.  Gandhi's goals were so small in contrast!
&gt;&gt; &gt; What
&gt;&gt; &gt; was the civil rights movement compared to 'cleaning up' a handful of
&gt;&gt; &gt; alt
&gt;&gt; &gt; groups?

&gt;&gt; &gt; Edmo, 9 years ago it was pretty obvious you were an asshole and an
&gt;&gt; &gt; asshole
&gt;&gt; &gt; you remain.

Pam, get real, I never even knew HOW to yank an account until these
abusers tried to yank my earthlink account--sheri ... @demon.net (A Male
named Tony Sidaway) tried to yank my earthlink account, and many others
did as well, because the admins there TOLD me. I THEN started sending
complaints because I would be damned if an astrologer was going to be
bullied off of an astrology group for voicing discontent at abuse of
this group. I became very good at it, like I am at most things, they
then banded together and yanked my Aznet account, the assholes there
bought everything they told them hook line and sinker. Earthlink then
told me they saw what was happening and were not going to yank my
account--I have been stable there ever since. Because I was
UNDEFEATABLE or bullyable--OR unable to be defeated in argument, they
believed that if they just abused me and the groups enough that the
flood of abuse would send me packing--which I almost did several times
as they note. But when I left I saw that the abuse did not cease and

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I don't know what to call the thing most people call a &quot;flame war&quot;

&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to call it, but I'll use that term for convenience and lack of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; inventiveness this time of night.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;It has always been very clear &quot;what it is&quot;, you even participated in
&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I've never been clear on what it is.  It seems to have taken on a
&gt;&gt; life
&gt;&gt; &gt; of its own and almost become a living entity!

&gt;&gt; Pam, get real, I never even knew HOW to yank an account until these
&gt;&gt; abusers tried to yank my earthlink account--sheri ... @demon.net (A Male
&gt;&gt; named Tony Sidaway) tried to yank my earthlink account, and many others
&gt;&gt; did as well, because the admins there TOLD me. I THEN started sending
&gt;&gt; complaints because I would be damned if an astrologer was going to be
&gt;&gt; bullied off of an astrology group for voicing discontent at abuse of
&gt;&gt; this group.

&gt;So, you lower yourself to the level of your opponents by using their
&gt;tactics.  Is that the embodiment of integrity in your reality?

&gt;&gt; I became very good at it, like I am at most things,

&gt;108 ignored complaints towards yours truly and counting.  You suck at it.

&gt;&gt; they then banded together and yanked my Aznet account, the assholes there
&gt;&gt; bought everything they told them hook line and sinker. Earthlink then
&gt;&gt; told me they saw what was happening and were not going to yank my
&gt;&gt; account--I have been stable there ever since.

&gt;So why is this being posted from Yahoo?

&gt;&gt; Because I was
&gt;&gt; UNDEFEATABLE or bullyable--OR unable to be defeated in argument, they
&gt;&gt; believed that if they just abused me and the groups enough that the
&gt;&gt; flood of abuse would send me packing--which I almost did several times
&gt;&gt; as they note. But when I left I saw that the abuse did not cease and
&gt;&gt; they simply claimed triumph and did it to others as well, so I returned
&gt;&gt; NEVER to back down again.

&gt;You back down all the time, Eddy.  You just conveniently claim you are
&gt;&quot;above&quot; responding when you're cornered.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I've had my clashes with you in the past and taken exception to
&gt;&gt; things
&gt;&gt; &gt; you have said or done...as I have with other flame war participants.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't support posting private email without permission, or trying
&gt;&gt; to

&gt;&gt; I would have never posted Susan's email or Lilis if they had been
&gt;&gt; honest about what happened, the mail was to prove them liars.

&gt;&lt;snarf&gt; Like we have anything beyond your say-so that it's even
&gt;authentic...

&gt;&gt; I have TONS of very explicit email from many women, they do not get posted
&gt;&gt; because they do not threaten me and come on usenet lying about our
&gt;&gt; relationship when and if it goes bad.

&gt;Sure you do, Eddy.  Why are you the only male around here who brags
&gt;about bagging so many women?

&gt;&gt; &gt; get anyone's accounts nuked (including yours), or lawsuits based on

&gt;&gt; Then you can understand why I started nuking accounts! Because they did
&gt;&gt; it FIRST and if I had not retailiated they would probably STILL be
&gt;&gt; doing it.

&gt;So...you're continuing to yank accounts even though the threat has
&gt;abated?  I'd say that was censorship, if you had actually yanked
&gt;anything other than your flaccid member.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Usenet flames, OR &quot;abundance&quot; (email bombing), or tracking down

&gt;&gt; Cujo and spamster bomb my mail all the time--I have since been able to
&gt;&gt; nuke their accounts when it happens, so they turned to listing me on
&gt;&gt; websites etc. but most have safeguards against that now and I have
&gt;&gt; little problem in that regard. In case you have forgotten little miss
&gt;&gt; goody two shoes,

&gt;Ed Hominem.

&gt;&gt; I  got email bombed from these assholes with up to
&gt;&gt; 10,000 mails an hour at one point because I nuked accounts.

&gt;No, you get mailbombed because you keep dragging noncombatants into this.

&gt;&gt; You can
&gt;&gt; post your mushy shit all you want, if someone attacks me, they'll get
&gt;&gt; tenfold what I get.

&gt;So...you admit to stooping yourself to such supposedly reprehensible
&gt;denial of service attacks, only ten times the magnitude?  What does that
&gt;make you, Eddy?  A vengeful hothead who in seeking &quot;justice&quot; does many
&gt;times worse than those who harmed him?

&gt;&gt; If they loeave me alone the'll get nothing, and
&gt;&gt; others have gotten kind and thoughtful advice over long periods of time
&gt;&gt; for free--what you put in you get back, remember?

&gt;Funny, I didn't think you thought I was entertaining, though I'm
&gt;certainly getting entertainment back from you.

&gt;&gt; &gt; people's Beemers and doing anything to them.    But I feel now I've
&gt;&gt; &gt; made my position on those things known and don't need to repeat them
&gt;&gt; &gt; over and over again.  I also don't expect anyone to necessarily alter
&gt;&gt; &gt; their behaviors based on my opinion ;)

&gt;&gt; I don't &quot;believe&quot; in certain things either, and I came here with sound,
&gt;&gt; kind, wise and free advice and got flamed, attacked, lied about, people
&gt;&gt; calling SDSU and all kinds of crap--now DON&quot;T TELL ME that doesn't call
&gt;&gt; for SOME sort of action.

&gt;Making a fool of yourself certainly is a unique course of action.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;It is an agenda to stop me from having business, suceeding with my
&gt;&gt; work
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;and/or expressing my views which are quite different thant what the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;astrological community wishes I would be. And until the defamation
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;KOOK shit cease, I will stay here and own this group.

&gt;&gt; &gt; IF (a big if, as I am not convinced this is the case) anyone is
&gt;&gt; &gt; seriously trying to interfere with your real-life business or you
&gt;&gt; &gt; pursuing a different astrological path from the mainstream, I would
&gt;&gt; &gt; certainly call that wrong.  It really does seem to me that people are
&gt;&gt; &gt; just in a long-standing flame war with you.

&gt;&gt; Are you really that dull?

&gt;Ed Hominem.

&gt;&gt; Or do you not get that defaming a person and
&gt;&gt; calling them a criminal when people who have never seen them or talked
&gt;&gt; to them are going to read that is bad for business? And why did you not
&gt;&gt; make it clear that calling my deceased mother (by ano ... @pacbell.net
&gt;&gt; AKA Rick Lazzarini)

&gt;Call for ABUNDANCE noted.

&gt;&gt; a &quot;pubic hair munching whore&quot; was not such a nice
&gt;&gt; thing to say and a bit off topic? Huh? Are you brain dead?

&gt; http://www.petitmorte.net/phoenix/wollmann.html

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I think the participants of it must be getting something out of
&gt;&gt; it, or
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they would just killfile each other.  So, if everyone is having a
&gt;&gt; good
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; time, who am I to pass judgement?

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;I am not going to killfile legally actionable information and just
&gt;&gt; act
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;like it is not there.  I am documenting all of it for a time that
&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;surely come.

&gt;&gt; &gt; If I were you I would just have a huge killfile and post my astrology
&gt;&gt; &gt; :)  I think eventually those who are flaming you would then seek
&gt;&gt; other
&gt;&gt; &gt; pastures where they would continue to be entertained by responses.

&gt;&gt; WRONG!!, I have left here for very long periods, and even while I am
&gt;&gt; gone the shit about me continues. I have heard that crap before it JUST
&gt;&gt; AINT TRUE.

&gt;You've never left for a long period of time.  You're desperate for
&gt;validation, and WE AIN'T GIVIN' IT!

&gt;&gt; &gt; But, I am not you, and I know you will do what you think best.

&gt;&gt; You can't even stand up for yourself, how could you stand up for a
&gt;&gt; truth?

&gt;Very potent of you, trying to flog Beep instead of engaging in rational
&gt;discussion with your detractors.  You're really good at wasting time,
&gt;aren't you?

&gt;Where has Beep encouraged anyone to put up a site on your stupid antics?
">

My guess is that it's the smbtech site he is referring to.  But it's
not "my" site.   I have zero control over it, and have had nothing
whatsoever to do with it for years.  The contact person for that site,
AFAIK, is Steve Burnett...if it's not Steve any more, then I don't
know who it is.  I also don't have current contact info for Steve.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't know what to call the thing most people call a &quot;flame war&quot;

&gt; in

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;here...this group could probably easily have a disagreement over

&gt; what

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to call it, but I'll use that term for convenience and lack of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;inventiveness this time of night.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It has always been very clear &quot;what it is&quot;, you even participated in

&gt; it.

&gt;&gt;I've never been clear on what it is.  It seems to have taken on a

&gt; life

&gt;&gt;of its own and almost become a living entity!

&gt; Pam, get real, I never even knew HOW to yank an account until these
&gt; abusers tried to yank my earthlink account--sheri ... @demon.net (A Male
&gt; named Tony Sidaway) tried to yank my earthlink account, and many others
&gt; did as well, because the admins there TOLD me. I THEN started sending
&gt; complaints because I would be damned if an astrologer was going to be
&gt; bullied off of an astrology group for voicing discontent at abuse of
&gt; this group. I became very good at it, like I am at most things, they
&gt; then banded together and yanked my Aznet account, the assholes there
&gt; bought everything they told them hook line and sinker. Earthlink then
&gt; told me they saw what was happening and were not going to yank my
&gt; account--I have been stable there ever since. Because I was
&gt; UNDEFEATABLE or bullyable--OR unable to be defeated in argument, they
&gt; believed that if they just abused me and the groups enough that the
&gt; flood of abuse would send me packing--which I almost did several times
&gt; as they note. But when I left I saw that the abuse did not cease and
&gt; they simply claimed triumph and did it to others as well, so I returned
&gt; NEVER to back down again.

&gt;&gt;I've had my clashes with you in the past and taken exception to

&gt; things

&gt;&gt;you have said or done...as I have with other flame war participants.
&gt;&gt;I don't support posting private email without permission, or trying

&gt; to

&gt; I would have never posted Susan's email or Lilis if they had been
&gt; honest about what happened, the mail was to prove them liars. I have
&gt; TONS of very explicit email from many women, they do not get posted
&gt; because they do not threaten me and come on usenet lying about our
&gt; relationship when and if it goes bad.

&gt;&gt;get anyone's accounts nuked (including yours), or lawsuits based on

&gt; Then you can understand why I started nuking accounts! Because they did
&gt; it FIRST and if I had not retailiated they would probably STILL be
&gt; doing it.

&gt;&gt;Usenet flames, OR &quot;abundance&quot; (email bombing), or tracking down

&gt; Cujo and spamster bomb my mail all the time--I have since been able to
&gt; nuke their accounts when it happens, so they turned to listing me on
&gt; websites etc. but most have safeguards against that now and I have
&gt; little problem in that regard. In case you have forgotten little miss
&gt; goody two shoes, _I_ got email bombed from these assholes with up to
&gt; 10,000 mails an hour at one point because I nuked accounts. You can
&gt; post your mushy shit all you want, if someone attacks me, they'll get
&gt; tenfold what I get. If they loeave me alone the'll get nothing, and
&gt; others have gotten kind and thoughtful advice over long periods of time
&gt; for free--what you put in you get back, remember?

&gt;&gt;people's Beemers and doing anything to them.    But I feel now I've
&gt;&gt;made my position on those things known and don't need to repeat them
&gt;&gt;over and over again.  I also don't expect anyone to necessarily alter
&gt;&gt;their behaviors based on my opinion ;)

&gt; I don't &quot;believe&quot; in certain things either, and I came here with sound,
&gt; kind, wise and free advice and got flamed, attacked, lied about, people
&gt; calling SDSU and all kinds of crap--now DON&quot;T TELL ME that doesn't call
&gt; for SOME sort of action.

&gt;&gt;&gt;It is an agenda to stop me from having business, suceeding with my

&gt; work

&gt;&gt;&gt;and/or expressing my views which are quite different thant what the
&gt;&gt;&gt;astrological community wishes I would be. And until the defamation

&gt; and

&gt;&gt;&gt;KOOK shit cease, I will stay here and own this group.

&gt;&gt;IF (a big if, as I am not convinced this is the case) anyone is
&gt;&gt;seriously trying to interfere with your real-life business or you
&gt;&gt;pursuing a different astrological path from the mainstream, I would
&gt;&gt;certainly call that wrong.  It really does seem to me that people are
&gt;&gt;just in a long-standing flame war with you.

&gt; Are you really that dull? Or do you not get that defaming a person and
&gt; calling them a criminal when people who have never seen them or talked
&gt; to them are going to read that is bad for business? And why did you not
&gt; make it clear that calling my deceased mother (by ano ... @pacbell.net
&gt; AKA Rick Lazzarini) a &quot;pubic hair munching whore&quot; was not such a nice
&gt; thing to say and a bit off topic? Huh? Are you brain dead?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think the participants of it must be getting something out of

&gt; it, or

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they would just killfile each other.  So, if everyone is having a

&gt; good

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;time, who am I to pass judgement?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am not going to killfile legally actionable information and just

&gt; act

&gt;&gt;&gt;like it is not there.  I am documenting all of it for a time that

&gt; will

&gt;&gt;&gt;surely come.

&gt;&gt;If I were you I would just have a huge killfile and post my astrology
&gt;&gt;:)  I think eventually those who are flaming you would then seek

&gt; other

&gt;&gt;pastures where they would continue to be entertained by responses.

&gt; WRONG!!, I have left here for very long periods, and even while I am
&gt; gone the shit about me continues. I have heard that crap before it JUST
&gt; AINT TRUE.

&gt;&gt;But, I am not you, and I know you will do what you think best.

&gt; You can't even stand up for yourself, how could you stand up for a
&gt; truth?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But I do feel badly when newbies to this group come here to

&gt; discuss

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;astrology and get caught in the vortex.  I've noticed Keera does a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;really good job of letting them know that there is more discussion

&gt; of

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;astrology here than just the validity topic, good astrologers

&gt; remain

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;here, and that it can be rewarding staying here as this group has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;formed a community of friendship, but that there are also other

&gt; places

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to go to discuss astrology.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, that is all fine and dandy, and I must say she has more courage
&gt;&gt;&gt;than the cowards that hide in aam, and she has been faithful to

&gt; helping

&gt;&gt;&gt;those interested in astrology.

&gt;&gt;Yes, and that is what I am thanking her for.  People come here based
&gt;&gt;on the name of the group, and don't find much astrology, and

&gt; naturally

&gt;&gt;get confused.

&gt; And yet you have criticised me in the past and encouraged others to put
&gt; up sites denigrating me, but never criticise the PROBLEM, which is the
&gt; abusers.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Now, that having been said, and me not
&gt;&gt;&gt;afraid to tell the truth like some of you here, she also contributes

&gt; to

&gt;&gt;&gt;trying to stop me and my companies from rightfully participating

&gt; here,

&gt;&gt;This surprises me...I haven't seen Keera try to stop you from

&gt; posting.

&gt; She has censored me in violation of the AAM charter just to block my
&gt; posts.

&gt;&gt;&gt;and tells newbies they &quot;should&quot; go to aam where they will get better
&gt;&gt;&gt;answers. She purposely violates the charter of the moderated group

&gt; just

&gt;&gt;&gt;to try to punish and limit me as well. This is not in integrity and

&gt; my

&gt;&gt;&gt;answers are just as good if not better than any you will ever find

&gt; in

&gt;&gt;&gt;aam.

&gt;&gt;I thought you were permitted to post in aam...is that no longer the
&gt;&gt;case?

&gt; I am permitted to, but I choose not to because they have people there
&gt; with the freedom to post all kinds of crap off topic and they don't
&gt; even look at their posts and yet hold me to a higher standard--they are
&gt; simply unfair and I won't be bothered with it. Their loss.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It takes a lot of patience and dedication to follow up on these

&gt; posts

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so I want to thank Keera for doing an often thankless job :)

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have far out&quot;patienced Keera&quot; especially since none of these

&gt; assholes

&gt;&gt;&gt;ever attack her for her views, which are NOT seasoned or wise very
&gt;&gt;&gt;often.

&gt;&gt;I agree that no one has the staying power here that you do :)  But
&gt;&gt;since you are busy with the flame war, someone else (like Keera) is
&gt;&gt;truly needed to discuss astrology with the newbies.

&gt; BULLSHIT, I am NOT &quot;busy with a flame war&quot;, I answer VERY few of these
&gt; posts of the abusers, you see this is what I mean, you are as blind as
&gt; a bat, and just a false face if I ever saw one. Why don't you criticise
&gt; the ABUSERS instead of me, coward???

&gt;&gt;&gt;I on the other hand have even had to put up with you whining to
&gt;&gt;&gt;spinics to put up websites to denigrate me and my companies, which I
&gt;&gt;&gt;will never forget.

&gt;&gt;I think you are referring to one website, which I have stated
&gt;&gt;repeatedly I am unable to alter or remove since I do not have it up

&gt; on

&gt;&gt;any of my domains.  I also would not approve of denigration of you or
&gt;&gt;your companies.

&gt; But you encourage a site instead of encouraging the abusers to post ON
&gt; TOPIC in an astrology group and stop harassing posters here? You
&gt; encourage REAL criminals and abusive imbeciles to ABUSE an astrologer
&gt; for trying to defend an astrology group--what part of that escapes your
&gt; perception as being complete bullshit?

&gt;&gt;&gt;There was another alternative to this 9 years of
&gt;&gt;&gt;bullshit, ya know, and that was for real astrologers to pull

&gt; themselves

&gt;&gt;&gt;up by the boostraps, send complaints in unison and CRUSH the fucking

&gt; &gt;&gt;No guts.

&gt; &gt; Oh, I have guts. My IBS tells me so.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Misery and stupidity love company.

&gt; &gt; We know, dear. That's why you can't leave alt.astrology. You need the

&gt; &gt;&gt;Very simple. Why you all can't see your OWN mindlessness and
&gt; &gt;&gt;lack of practicing what you preach (preaching about &quot;kindness&quot;,
&gt; &gt;&gt;courtesy, etc. whilst harassing persons for years on end) should be of
&gt; &gt;&gt;more concern to you.

&gt; &gt; I never preach about &quot;kindness&quot;. I prefer to preach about parties.

&gt; &gt;&gt;Never mind all that, this is the primary reason why I don't care to
&gt; &gt;&gt;even TRY to talk to you idiots

&gt; &gt; But you will type long replies to us.

&gt; &gt;&gt;and will forever just post my articles
&gt; &gt;&gt;without interacting with any of you,

&gt; &gt; Dang, another irony meter busted.

&gt; &gt;&gt;because I do, NOT prefer it, do
&gt; &gt;&gt;NOT have time or the inclination for this endless tit for tat shit that
&gt; &gt;&gt;goes on for eternity.

&gt; &gt; Good thing my irony meter was already busted. You're on a roll! Mars in

&gt; &gt;&gt;If you don't like me, DON'T READ MY POSTS OR DEAL WITH ME. That will be

&gt; &gt; Look, irony meter's busted, OK, so you can stop now.

&gt; &gt;&gt;I gave everyone here the benefit of the doubt, now there is NO doubt of
&gt; &gt;&gt;your irrelevance to me and my life.

&gt; &gt; Sorry, what'd you say? I was busy fixing my irony meter.

&gt;&gt;&gt; :)  I think eventually those who are flaming you would then seek
&gt;&gt; other
&gt;&gt;&gt; pastures where they would continue to be entertained by responses.

&gt;&gt; WRONG!!, I have left here for very long periods, and even while I am
&gt;&gt; gone the shit about me continues. I have heard that crap before it
&gt;&gt; JUST AINT TRUE.

&gt; That's because you're the bestest kook on Usenet and you created that
&gt; reality, dumbfuck!

&gt;&gt;&gt; But, I am not you, and I know you will do what you think best.

&gt;&gt; You can't even stand up for yourself, how could you stand up for a
&gt;&gt; truth?

&gt; I truly hope the next book you get Auntie to publish is on how to win
&gt; friends.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But I do feel badly when newbies to this group come here to
&gt;&gt; discuss
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; astrology and get caught in the vortex.  I've noticed Keera does a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; really good job of letting them know that there is more discussion
&gt;&gt; of
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; astrology here than just the validity topic, good astrologers
&gt;&gt; remain
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; here, and that it can be rewarding staying here as this group has
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; formed a community of friendship, but that there are also other
&gt;&gt; places
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to go to discuss astrology.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Yes, that is all fine and dandy, and I must say she has more courage
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;than the cowards that hide in aam, and she has been faithful to
&gt;&gt; helping
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;those interested in astrology.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, and that is what I am thanking her for.  People come here based
&gt;&gt;&gt; on the name of the group, and don't find much astrology, and
&gt;&gt; naturally
&gt;&gt;&gt; get confused.

&gt;&gt; And yet you have criticised me in the past and encouraged others to
&gt;&gt; put up sites denigrating me, but never criticise the PROBLEM, which is
&gt;&gt; the abusers.

&gt; Ed, you're the abuser. You and the rest of your buddies trying to censor
&gt; and intimidate.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Now, that having been said, and me not
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;afraid to tell the truth like some of you here, she also contributes
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;trying to stop me and my companies from rightfully participating
&gt;&gt; here,

&gt;&gt;&gt; This surprises me...I haven't seen Keera try to stop you from
&gt;&gt; posting.

&gt;&gt; She has censored me in violation of the AAM charter just to block my
&gt;&gt; posts.

&gt; You were asked to remove a commercial sig. Tough shit. Check out my posts
&gt; there, I took out my sig even though it wasn't commercial.

&gt; You're too much of a whining crybaby to do that, you'd rather blame
&gt; others.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;and tells newbies they &quot;should&quot; go to aam where they will get better
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;answers. She purposely violates the charter of the moderated group
&gt;&gt; just
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;to try to punish and limit me as well. This is not in integrity and
&gt;&gt; my
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;answers are just as good if not better than any you will ever find
&gt;&gt; in
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;aam.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I thought you were permitted to post in aam...is that no longer the
&gt;&gt;&gt; case?

&gt;&gt; I am permitted to, but I choose not to

&gt;&gt; what
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to call it, but I'll use that term for convenience and lack of
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; inventiveness this time of night.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;It has always been very clear &quot;what it is&quot;, you even participated in
&gt;&gt; it.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I've never been clear on what it is.  It seems to have taken on a
&gt;&gt; life
&gt;&gt; &gt; of its own and almost become a living entity!

&gt;&gt; Pam, get real, I never even knew HOW to yank an account until these
&gt;&gt; abusers tried to yank my earthlink account--sheri ... @demon.net (A Male
&gt;&gt; named Tony Sidaway) tried to yank my earthlink account, and many others
&gt;&gt; did as well, because the admins there TOLD me. I THEN started sending
&gt;&gt; complaints because I would be damned if an astrologer was going to be
&gt;&gt; bullied off of an astrology group for voicing discontent at abuse of
&gt;&gt; this group.

&gt; So, you lower yourself to the level of your opponents by using their
&gt; tactics.  Is that the embodiment of integrity in your reality?

&gt;&gt; I became very good at it, like I am at most things,

&gt; 108 ignored complaints towards yours truly and counting.  You suck at it.

&gt;&gt; they then banded together and yanked my Aznet account, the assholes there
&gt;&gt; bought everything they told them hook line and sinker. Earthlink then
&gt;&gt; told me they saw what was happening and were not going to yank my
&gt;&gt; account--I have been stable there ever since.

&gt; So why is this being posted from Yahoo?

&gt;&gt; Because I was
&gt;&gt; UNDEFEATABLE or bullyable--OR unable to be defeated in argument, they
&gt;&gt; believed that if they just abused me and the groups enough that the
&gt;&gt; flood of abuse would send me packing--which I almost did several times
&gt;&gt; as they note. But when I left I saw that the abuse did not cease and
&gt;&gt; they simply claimed triumph and did it to others as well, so I returned
&gt;&gt; NEVER to back down again.

&gt; You back down all the time, Eddy.  You just conveniently claim you are
&gt; &quot;above&quot; responding when you're cornered.

&gt;&gt; &gt; I've had my clashes with you in the past and taken exception to
&gt;&gt; things
&gt;&gt; &gt; you have said or done...as I have with other flame war participants.
&gt;&gt; &gt; I don't support posting private email without permission, or trying
&gt;&gt; to

&gt;&gt; I would have never posted Susan's email or Lilis if they had been
&gt;&gt; honest about what happened, the mail was to prove them liars.

&gt; &lt;snarf&gt; Like we have anything beyond your say-so that it's even
&gt; authentic...

&gt;&gt; I have TONS of very explicit email from many women, they do not get posted
&gt;&gt; because they do not threaten me and come on usenet lying about our
&gt;&gt; relationship when and if it goes bad.

&gt; Sure you do, Eddy.  Why are you the only male around here who brags
&gt; about bagging so many women?

&gt;&gt; &gt; get anyone's accounts nuked (including yours), or lawsuits based on

&gt;&gt; Then you can understand why I started nuking accounts! Because they did
&gt;&gt; it FIRST and if I had not retailiated they would probably STILL be
&gt;&gt; doing it.

&gt; So...you're continuing to yank accounts even though the threat has
&gt; abated?  I'd say that was censorship, if you had actually yanked
&gt; anything other than your flaccid member.

&gt;&gt; &gt; Usenet flames, OR &quot;abundance&quot; (email bombing), or tracking down

&gt;&gt; Cujo and spamster bomb my mail all the time--I have since been able to
&gt;&gt; nuke their accounts when it happens, so they turned to listing me on
&gt;&gt; websites etc. but most have safeguards against that now and I have
&gt;&gt; little problem in that regard. In case you have forgotten little miss
&gt;&gt; goody two shoes,

&gt; Ed Hominem.

&gt;&gt; I  got email bombed from these assholes with up to
&gt;&gt; 10,000 mails an hour at one point because I nuked accounts.

&gt; No, you get mailbombed because you keep dragging noncombatants into this.

&gt;&gt; You can
&gt;&gt; post your mushy shit all you want, if someone attacks me, they'll get
&gt;&gt; tenfold what I get.

&gt; So...you admit to stooping yourself to such supposedly reprehensible
&gt; denial of service attacks, only ten times the magnitude?  What does that
&gt; make you, Eddy?  A vengeful hothead who in seeking &quot;justice&quot; does many
&gt; times worse than those who harmed him?

&gt;&gt; If they loeave me alone the'll get nothing, and
&gt;&gt; others have gotten kind and thoughtful advice over long periods of time
&gt;&gt; for free--what you put in you get back, remember?

&gt; Funny, I didn't think you thought I was entertaining, though I'm
&gt; certainly getting entertainment back from you.

&gt;&gt; &gt; people's Beemers and doing anything to them.    But I feel now I've
&gt;&gt; &gt; made my position on those things known and don't need to repeat them
&gt;&gt; &gt; over and over again.  I also don't expect anyone to necessarily alter
&gt;&gt; &gt; their behaviors based on my opinion ;)

&gt;&gt; I don't &quot;believe&quot; in certain things either, and I came here with sound,
&gt;&gt; kind, wise and free advice and got flamed, attacked, lied about, people
&gt;&gt; calling SDSU and all kinds of crap--now DON&quot;T TELL ME that doesn't call
&gt;&gt; for SOME sort of action.

&gt; Making a fool of yourself certainly is a unique course of action.

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;It is an agenda to stop me from having business, suceeding with my
&gt;&gt; work
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;and/or expressing my views which are quite different thant what the
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;astrological community wishes I would be. And until the defamation
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;KOOK shit cease, I will stay here and own this group.

&gt;&gt; &gt; IF (a big if, as I am not convinced this is the case) anyone is
&gt;&gt; &gt; seriously trying to interfere with your real-life business or you
&gt;&gt; &gt; pursuing a different astrological path from the mainstream, I would
&gt;&gt; &gt; certainly call that wrong.  It really does seem to me that people are
&gt;&gt; &gt; just in a long-standing flame war with you.

&gt;&gt; Are you really that dull?

&gt; Ed Hominem.

&gt;&gt; Or do you not get that defaming a person and
&gt;&gt; calling them a criminal when people who have never seen them or talked
&gt;&gt; to them are going to read that is bad for business? And why did you not
&gt;&gt; make it clear that calling my deceased mother (by ano ... @pacbell.net
&gt;&gt; AKA Rick Lazzarini)

&gt; Call for ABUNDANCE noted.

&gt;&gt; a &quot;pubic hair munching whore&quot; was not such a nice
&gt;&gt; thing to say and a bit off topic? Huh? Are you brain dead?

&gt; http://www.petitmorte.net/phoenix/wollmann.html

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I think the participants of it must be getting something out of
&gt;&gt; it, or
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they would just killfile each other.  So, if everyone is having a
&gt;&gt; good
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; time, who am I to pass judgement?

&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;I am not going to killfile legally actionable information and just
&gt;&gt; act
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;like it is not there.  I am documenting all of it for a time that
&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;surely come.

&gt;&gt; &gt; If I were you I would just have a huge killfile and post my astrology

&gt;&gt; &gt; But, I am not you, and I know you will do what you think best.

&gt;&gt; You can't even stand up for yourself, how could you stand up for a
&gt;&gt; truth?

&gt; Very potent of you, trying to flog Beep instead of engaging in rational
&gt; discussion with your detractors.  You're really good at wasting time,

Wrong again, Mr. l ... @astroconsulting.com. &lt;snicker&gt;

It may be that the judge finds that you're equally at fault. Another
finding is that you've claimed you're not damaged (unaffected) by this.

There's more options but you've got your hands full proving that you
haven't defamed yourself worse.

How? Once the judge takes a look at all the numerous lies you've told,
he's going to laugh you out of court. I can't wait to see his face once
he's informed that you have a castle, observatory and airstrip and have
claimed you're the richest and most successful person on the planet.

If you're not lying about that, then you really have no grounds to sue.

To get astrological, I've found that the bosses who have given me

with Saturn conj Mars in Cancer. So our Marses connect, and his Sun is
between my Saturn and Venus. We sometimes misunderstand each other (even

Oh yeah, there is. It's the law of supply and demand. That's why no

Why did you leave out yourself and all your sockpuppets, Mr. Dishonest?

And so what if other people post here more than others. It's an
umoderated newsgroup. You don't own it.

No, I don't. It would be a forgery if you owned that email addy. You
don't. You LOST it when you SPAMMED voluminously from AOL.

That's like robbing a bank in your Beemer and saying it's still your car
when it gets repossessed and sold at auction.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WRONG!!, I have left here for very long periods, and even while I am
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gone the shit about me continues. I have heard that crap before it

&gt;&gt;JUST

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;AINT TRUE.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If you did decide to ignore the flames, it would take a lot of time
&gt;&gt;&gt;until your Fan Club found other &quot;kooks&quot; to entertain them.  But I do
&gt;&gt;&gt;think eventually that would happen.

&gt;&gt;You see? You are CONTINUING to perpetrate a LIE. Are you a lawyer? No,
&gt;&gt;I don't think so. There is a HUGE difference in calling someone names
&gt;&gt;(even the pubic munching whore bullshit is not actionable) and calling
&gt;&gt;a PUBLISHER a plagiarizer or felon, comprende? One is a flame and one
&gt;&gt;is an actionable lawsuit in court for damages. And NO the abusers DO
&gt;&gt;NOT CEASE, you just are FLAT wrong, thbey do not cease NO MATTER WHAT,
&gt;&gt;the ONLY thing that has relieved much of my difficulty WAS complaint
&gt;&gt;and FORCE. That's the only thing these idiots understand. And I WILL
&gt;&gt;prevail.

&gt;&gt;&gt;If there has been any violation of the charter in dealing with your
&gt;&gt;&gt;posts, you should send mail to the aamod board.

&gt;&gt;I did, they told me to resubmit a post that was more on topic and did
&gt;&gt;not need rewriting compared to the way off topic bullcrap of others
&gt;&gt;they just give free reign to post, no I am NOT going to fight them, its
&gt;&gt;their stupid biased group, if they don't care to be fair that's their
&gt;&gt;problem and will come back on them. It is different than here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BULLSHIT, I am NOT &quot;busy with a flame war&quot;, I answer VERY few of

&gt;&gt;these

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;posts of the abusers, you see this is what I mean, you are as blind

&gt;&gt;as

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a bat, and just a false face if I ever saw one. Why don't you

&gt;&gt;criticise

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the ABUSERS instead of me, coward???

&gt;&gt;&gt;I did not mean the above as criticism; why did you take it as such?

&gt;&gt;I

&gt;&gt;&gt;simply observed that you probably have more posts to read in here

&gt;&gt;than

&gt;&gt;&gt;most, since an awful lot of them are addressed to you.

&gt;&gt;Because it is JUST FLAT WRONG. I do NOT preoccupy myself with these
&gt;&gt;idiots. I try very hard to wade through the 10,000 wollmanizer posts to
&gt;&gt;see if there is anything to reply to and your statement is just flat
&gt;&gt;wrong. I do NOT answer even 1/100th of the flames about me. Why can't
&gt;&gt;YOU post one complaint about the CLEAR spamming of the wollmanizer
&gt;&gt;posts? IT IS SPAM, it should get yanked.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Why blow up at me?

&gt;&gt;I am not blowing up, I am pointing out your obvious bias.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I've learned one thing.  Natal grand crosses generate all kinds
&gt;&gt;&gt;of energies.  You and I both posted quite a bit in here in the past

&gt;&gt;24

"The ONLY defense in court for the abuse that these imbeciles heap on me

&gt;&gt;WRONG!!

&gt;&gt;BULLSHIT,

&gt;&gt;you are as blind as a bat, and just a false face if I ever saw one.

&gt; ...

&gt;&gt;coward

&gt; ...

&gt;&gt;You encourage REAL criminals and abusive imbeciles

&gt; ...

&gt;&gt;what part of that escapes your perception as being complete bullshit?

&gt; ...

&gt;&gt;Duh, gee, perhaps because you buddy up with the assholes and attack the
&gt;&gt;astrologer?

&gt; ...

&gt; Nothing to add, really. You've done a fantastic job showing your true

&gt;&gt;If you did decide to ignore the flames, it would take a lot of time

&gt; You see? You are CONTINUING to perpetrate a LIE. Are you a lawyer? No,
&gt; I don't think so. There is a HUGE difference in calling someone names
&gt; (even the pubic munching whore bullshit is not actionable) and calling

&gt; is an actionable lawsuit in court for damages. And NO the abusers DO
&gt; NOT CEASE, you just are FLAT wrong, thbey do not cease NO MATTER WHAT,
&gt; the ONLY thing that has relieved much of my difficulty WAS complaint
&gt; and FORCE. That's the only thing these idiots understand. And I WILL
&gt; prevail.

&gt;&gt;If there has been any violation of the charter in dealing with your
&gt;&gt;posts, you should send mail to the aamod board.

&gt; I did, they told me to resubmit a post that was more on topic and did

&gt; they just give free reign to post, no I am NOT going to fight them, its
&gt; their stupid biased group, if they don't care to be fair that's their
&gt; problem and will come back on them. It is different than here.

&gt;&gt;&gt;BULLSHIT, I am NOT &quot;busy with a flame war&quot;, I answer VERY few of

&gt; these

&gt;&gt;&gt;posts of the abusers, you see this is what I mean, you are as blind

&gt; as

&gt;&gt;&gt;a bat, and just a false face if I ever saw one. Why don't you

&gt; criticise

&gt;&gt;&gt;the ABUSERS instead of me, coward???

&gt;&gt;I did not mean the above as criticism; why did you take it as such?

&gt; I

&gt;&gt;simply observed that you probably have more posts to read in here

&gt; than

&gt;&gt;most, since an awful lot of them are addressed to you.

&gt; Because it is JUST FLAT WRONG. I do NOT preoccupy myself with these
&gt; idiots. I try very hard to wade through the 10,000 wollmanizer posts to
&gt; see if there is anything to reply to and your statement is just flat
&gt; wrong. I do NOT answer even 1/100th of the flames about me. Why can't
&gt; YOU post one complaint about the CLEAR spamming of the wollmanizer
&gt; posts? IT IS SPAM, it should get yanked.

&gt;&gt;Why blow up at me?

&gt; I am not blowing up, I am pointing out your obvious bias.

&gt;&gt;Well, I've learned one thing.  Natal grand crosses generate all kinds
&gt;&gt;of energies.  You and I both posted quite a bit in here in the past

&gt; 24

&gt;&gt;hours and now the total post count is way up!

Actually, I think you have a point there.  I've noticed sometimes
people get away with off-topic posts, but others generate a

My opinion is that as long as you react in a way the "wollmanizer"
posters find entertaining, those posts will continue...if not from one
source, then another.  They will pop up like weeds or mushrooms or
something as long as you react to them, because your reaction is what

No, he just wants money. That's why he whines about his "businesses" and
"companies" being "denigrated" and "defamed". He knows that his main
focus for coming to Usenet to troll for clients brings in shit coin so
he figures he's gonna strike it RICH by suing anyone who points out what
a failure he is.

&gt;&gt;a PUBLISHER a plagiarizer or felon, comprende? One is a flame and one
&gt;&gt;is an actionable lawsuit in court for damages.

&gt; Why are the flames actionable because you are a publisher?
">

They aren't. He just wishes they were. He's got some cockamamie idea
that because he's self-published an incoherent, awful, and
poorly-selling book that this gives him some sort of extra protection
whenever someone points out his plagiarism in other areas.

He's disingenuously trying to tie someone calling him on his plagiarism
of Professor Ron Pine's work to some claim that his whole book is
olagiarized. It doesn't wash, but Edmo will use whatever unethical
threatening tactics he can to (attempt to) silence or censor his critics.

&gt; Actually, I think you have a point there.  I've noticed sometimes

Bingo. Humans. Can't live with 'em, can't post to a moderated board
without their bias creeping in at some point, since humans aren't perfect.

Of course, the group is run far fairer and intelligently than it would
if Ed were the moderator.

&gt;&gt;I

&gt;&gt;&gt;simply observed that you probably have more posts to read in here

&gt;&gt;&gt;most, since an awful lot of them are addressed to you.

&gt;&gt;Because it is JUST FLAT WRONG. I do NOT preoccupy myself with these
&gt;&gt;idiots. I try very hard to wade through the 10,000 wollmanizer posts to
&gt;&gt;see if there is anything to reply to and your statement is just flat
&gt;&gt;wrong. I do NOT answer even 1/100th of the flames about me. Why can't
&gt;&gt;YOU post one complaint about the CLEAR spamming of the wollmanizer
&gt;&gt;posts? IT IS SPAM, it should get yanked.

&gt; My opinion is that as long as you react in a way the &quot;wollmanizer&quot;
&gt; posters find entertaining, those posts will continue...if not from one
&gt; source, then another.  They will pop up like weeds or mushrooms or

Oh please Ms Fake liar:
Defamation= Injuring someone's character or reputation by making false
and malicious statements about him to other people. The law recognizes
a difference between defamation and mere criticism of an individual.
Criticism deals only with matters that legitimately invite public
attention or call for public comment. In contrast, defamation usually
involves a person's private life and domestic affairs. Calling a woman
a prostitute or a banker an embezzler, or an astrologer or consultant a
fraud on a television, radio or usenet public forum are examples of
defamation. The term defamation includes both libel and slander.

Black's law dictionary-Defamation="The offense of injuring a person's
character, fame or reputation by false and malicious statements."
The "offense" is in the publication of the matter, so you are not
"covered" just because you read it somewhere else first. You are safe
ONLY if the statement is true. The best advice is to never say anything
nasty about anyone.

Flaming

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

(Redirected from Flame war)
This article is about the Internet meaning of the word "flaming". For
other meanings, and meanings of the word "flame", see Flame.
Flaming is the performance "art" of posting messages that are
deliberately hostile and insulting in the social context of a
discussion board (usually on the Internet). Such messages are called
flames, and are often posted in response to flamebait. Flaming is one
of a class of economic problems known as The Tragedy of the Commons,
when a group holds a resource (in this case, communal attention), but
each of the individual members has an incentive to overuse it.

Although face to face flaming is as old as time itself, flaming on the
Internet started in the Usenet hierarchies. A flame may have elements
of a normal message, but is distinguished by its intent. A flame is
never intended to be constructive, to further clarify a discussion, or
to persuade other people. The motive for flaming is never dialectic,
but rather social or psychological. Flamers are attempting to assert
their authority, or establish a position of superiority. Occasionally,
flamers merely wish to upset and offend other members of the forum, in
which case they are trolls.

Similarly, a normal, non-flame message may have elements of a flame -
it may be hostile, for example - but it is not a flame if it is
seriously intended to advance the discussion.

&gt;&gt;Well, I am not a lawyer, so I wouldn't know if you could get damages

&gt; Oh please Ms Fake liar:
&gt; Defamation= Injuring someone's character or reputation by making false
&gt; and malicious statements about him to other people. The law recognizes
&gt; a difference between defamation and mere criticism of an individual.
&gt; Criticism deals only with matters that legitimately invite public
&gt; attention or call for public comment. In contrast, defamation usually
&gt; involves a person's private life and domestic affairs. Calling a woman
&gt; a prostitute or a banker an embezzler, or an astrologer or consultant a
&gt; fraud on a television, radio or usenet public forum are examples of
&gt; defamation. The term defamation includes both libel and slander.

&gt; Black's law dictionary-Defamation=&quot;The offense of injuring a person's
&gt; character, fame or reputation by false and malicious statements.&quot;
&gt; The &quot;offense&quot; is in the publication of the matter, so you are not
&gt; &quot;covered&quot; just because you read it somewhere else first. You are safe
&gt; ONLY if the statement is true. The best advice is to never say anything
&gt; nasty about anyone.

&gt;&gt;or not.  And I didn't realize you were after money...

&gt; Oh please Ms &quot;get all the abusers to defend her off topic rant trying
&gt; to make Edmond the problem&quot; abuser.

&gt;&gt;I just thought
&gt;&gt;you wanted the flame war to stop.

&gt; Let me state this the last time, and this WILL be the last time I post
&gt; to you because you are a lying fraud who is STILL trying to twist this
&gt; as having something to do with me, when it doesn't I am not the problem
&gt; and I am not &quot;IN&quot; a flame war:

&gt; Flaming
&gt;&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
&gt; (Redirected from Flame war)
&gt; This article is about the Internet meaning of the word &quot;flaming&quot;. For
&gt; other meanings, and meanings of the word &quot;flame&quot;, see Flame.
&gt; Flaming is the performance &quot;art&quot; of posting messages that are
&gt; deliberately hostile and insulting in the social context of a
&gt; discussion board (usually on the Internet). Such messages are called
&gt; flames, and are often posted in response to flamebait. Flaming is one
&gt; of a class of economic problems known as The Tragedy of the Commons,
&gt; when a group holds a resource (in this case, communal attention), but
&gt; each of the individual members has an incentive to overuse it.

&gt; Although face to face flaming is as old as time itself, flaming on the
&gt; Internet started in the Usenet hierarchies. A flame may have elements
&gt; of a normal message, but is distinguished by its intent. A flame is
&gt; never intended to be constructive, to further clarify a discussion, or
&gt; to persuade other people. The motive for flaming is never dialectic,
&gt; but rather social or psychological. Flamers are attempting to assert
&gt; their authority, or establish a position of superiority. Occasionally,
&gt; flamers merely wish to upset and offend other members of the forum, in
&gt; which case they are trolls.

&gt; Similarly, a normal, non-flame message may have elements of a flame -
&gt; it may be hostile, for example - but it is not a flame if it is
&gt; seriously intended to advance the discussion.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WRONG!!, I have left here for very long periods, and even while I

&gt; am

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;gone the shit about me continues. I have heard that crap before

&gt; it

&gt;&gt;&gt;JUST

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;AINT TRUE.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you did decide to ignore the flames, it would take a lot of

&gt; time

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;until your Fan Club found other &quot;kooks&quot; to entertain them.  But I

&gt; do

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;think eventually that would happen.

&gt;&gt;&gt;You see? You are CONTINUING to perpetrate a LIE. Are you a lawyer?

&gt; No,

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't think so.

&gt;&gt;No, I'm not a lawyer.  But it's not a LIE.  &quot;Lie&quot; means there is
&gt;&gt;intent and I am speaking what I consider to be the truth.

&gt; You are lying to yourself then or you are a complete idiot. It's easy
&gt; for anyone with half a brain to see that I post one post and 30 frickin
&gt; flames post to it and I answer none.

&gt;&gt;&gt;There is a HUGE difference in calling someone names
&gt;&gt;&gt;(even the pubic munching whore bullshit is not actionable) and

&gt; calling

&gt;&gt;&gt;a PUBLISHER a plagiarizer or felon, comprende? One is a flame and

&gt; one

&gt;&gt;&gt;is an actionable lawsuit in court for damages.

&gt;&gt;Why are the flames actionable because you are a publisher?

&gt; FLAMES are not actionable spinic, defamation IS.
&gt; Stay on the topic--and why are you snipping all the facts and answering
&gt; all the spinics swo that the group is FULL of spam??

&gt;&gt;&gt;And NO the abusers DO
&gt;&gt;&gt;NOT CEASE, you just are FLAT wrong, thbey do not cease NO MATTER

&gt; WHAT,

&gt;&gt;&gt;the ONLY thing that has relieved much of my difficulty WAS complaint
&gt;&gt;&gt;and FORCE. That's the only thing these idiots understand. And I WILL
&gt;&gt;&gt;prevail.

&gt;&gt;You don't think they would eventually give up if they had nothing to
&gt;&gt;do in here but read astrology?

&gt; You must be frickin kidding, are you high or something? Or blind???
&gt; What do you see over the last two days here? I posted 2 posts in reply
&gt; to your reply and initial post and we now have an off topic array of
&gt; flaming me, abuse, and even YOU are talking about kids and crap. Now
&gt; HOW is YOUR ABUSE --me?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If there has been any violation of the charter in dealing with

&gt; your

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;posts, you should send mail to the aamod board.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I did, they told me to resubmit a post that was more on topic and

&gt; did

&gt;&gt;&gt;not need rewriting compared to the way off topic bullcrap of others
&gt;&gt;&gt;they just give free reign to post, no I am NOT going to fight them,

&gt; its

&gt;&gt;&gt;their stupid biased group, if they don't care to be fair that's

&gt; their

&gt;&gt;&gt;problem and will come back on them. It is different than here.

&gt;&gt;Actually, I think you have a point there.  I've noticed sometimes
&gt;&gt;people get away with off-topic posts, but others generate a
&gt;&gt;moderator's comment.  I'm not sure if it's different for different
&gt;&gt;posters, different moderators, or just that humans can't always keep
&gt;&gt;up with every off-topic post.

&gt; Yes, they are biased and bigoted there, and Keera participates in it an
&gt; abuses her power to do so out of pettiness, not unlike all the abusers
&gt; here. And then uses this &quot;kindeness&quot; bullshit, just like you are doing
&gt; with the spinics here, to abuse me even more. You all should be ashamed
&gt; for even thinking you can pass it off.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BULLSHIT, I am NOT &quot;busy with a flame war&quot;, I answer VERY few of

&gt;&gt;&gt;these

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;posts of the abusers, you see this is what I mean, you are as

&gt; blind

&gt;&gt;&gt;as

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a bat, and just a false face if I ever saw one. Why don't you

&gt;&gt;&gt;criticise

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the ABUSERS instead of me, coward???

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I did not mean the above as criticism; why did you take it as

&gt; such?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;simply observed that you probably have more posts to read in here

&gt;&gt;&gt;than

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;most, since an awful lot of them are addressed to you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Because it is JUST FLAT WRONG. I do NOT preoccupy myself with these
&gt;&gt;&gt;idiots. I try very hard to wade through the 10,000 wollmanizer posts

&gt; to

&gt;&gt;&gt;see if there is anything to reply to and your statement is just flat
&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong. I do NOT answer even 1/100th of the flames about me. Why

&gt; can't

&gt;&gt;&gt;YOU post one complaint about the CLEAR spamming of the wollmanizer
&gt;&gt;&gt;posts? IT IS SPAM, it should get yanked.

&gt;&gt;My opinion is that as long as you react in a way the &quot;wollmanizer&quot;
&gt;&gt;posters find entertaining, those posts will continue...if not from

&gt; one

&gt;&gt;source, then another.  They will pop up like weeds or mushrooms or
&gt;&gt;something as long as you react to them, because your reaction is what
&gt;&gt;they want.

&gt; What part of &quot;flat wrong&quot; is escaping your superficial perceptions?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why blow up at me?

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am not blowing up, I am pointing out your obvious bias.

&gt;&gt;Well, I've been accused of bias from the &quot;other side&quot; also (not as
&gt;&gt;much in Usenet but in private mediums), bias in YOUR favor, so I
&gt;&gt;assume catching it from both sides of the flame war means  I'm being
&gt;&gt;pretty neutral ;)

&gt; Bullshit again, you are being a typical two faced cowardly Libra. Do
&gt; you even have a clue what facts are? You snipped them off the bottom of
&gt; this post where I PROVED that the abusers are the ones flooding this
&gt; group OVER 9 YEARS with spam and you snip it and ignore it. What
&gt; fantasy planet you on anyway?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I've learned one thing.  Natal grand crosses generate all

&gt; kinds

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of energies.  You and I both posted quite a bit in here in the

&gt; past

&gt;&gt;&gt;24

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hours and now the total post count is way up!

&gt;&gt;&gt;WRONG again, here is the true abuser count:

&gt;&gt;I meant that what we post generates a lot of posts from others.

&gt; Yes, and yet you STILL point the blame at me even though a 5 year can
&gt; see I am not even answering them!

&gt;&gt;Ok, I've got

&gt;&gt;&gt; crap. Now HOW is YOUR ABUSE --me?

&gt;&gt;[...]

&gt;&gt;&gt; Bullshit again, you are being a typical two faced cowardly Libra. Do
&gt;&gt;&gt; you even have a clue what facts are? You snipped them off the bottom
&gt;&gt;&gt; of this post where I PROVED that the abusers are the ones flooding
&gt;&gt;&gt; this group OVER 9 YEARS with spam and you snip it and ignore it.
&gt;&gt;&gt; What fantasy planet you on anyway?

&gt;&gt;[...]

&gt;&gt;Wow, what a surprise. Ed turns nasty (again) on the only poster to
&gt;&gt;a.a. who is nice to him.

&gt;&gt;&lt;unrelated groups snecked&gt;

&gt; You'll notice it was Beep, a woman. Eddieeeeeee, the Cowardly Asshole
&gt; didn't take on any of the real men who post in A.A. It's a target rich
&gt; evironmment: Bob Officer, Ken Kizer, Tom Kerr, Pheonix, SpAmster,
&gt; me, and whichever entity anonym is currently using.

One wonders why he persists in thinking of the women as weaker targets,
anyway, since we seem to kick his ass on a regular basis.

Of course Beep, sweet as she is, is an exception to that rule, and he
knows it. He was probably a bully in school, too.

&gt;Defamation= Injuring someone's character or reputation by making false
&gt;and malicious statements about him to other people. The law recognizes
&gt;a difference between defamation and mere criticism of an individual.
&gt;Criticism deals only with matters that legitimately invite public
&gt;attention or call for public comment. In contrast, defamation usually
&gt;involves a person's private life and domestic affairs. Calling a woman
&gt;a prostitute or a banker an embezzler, or an astrologer or consultant a
&gt;fraud on a television, radio or usenet public forum are examples of
&gt;defamation. The term defamation includes both libel and slander.

&gt;Black's law dictionary-Defamation=&quot;The offense of injuring a person's
&gt;character, fame or reputation by false and malicious statements.&quot;
&gt;The &quot;offense&quot; is in the publication of the matter, so you are not

&gt;Flaming
&gt;&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
&gt;(Redirected from Flame war)
&gt;This article is about the Internet meaning of the word &quot;flaming&quot;. For
&gt;other meanings, and meanings of the word &quot;flame&quot;, see Flame.
&gt;Flaming is the performance &quot;art&quot; of posting messages that are
&gt;deliberately hostile and insulting in the social context of a
&gt;discussion board (usually on the Internet). Such messages are called
&gt;flames, and are often posted in response to flamebait. Flaming is one
&gt;of a class of economic problems known as The Tragedy of the Commons,
&gt;when a group holds a resource (in this case, communal attention), but
&gt;each of the individual members has an incentive to overuse it.

&gt;Although face to face flaming is as old as time itself, flaming on the
&gt;Internet started in the Usenet hierarchies. A flame may have elements
&gt;of a normal message, but is distinguished by its intent. A flame is
&gt;never intended to be constructive, to further clarify a discussion, or
&gt;to persuade other people. The motive for flaming is never dialectic,
&gt;but rather social or psychological. Flamers are attempting to assert
&gt;their authority, or establish a position of superiority. Occasionally,
&gt;flamers merely wish to upset and offend other members of the forum, in
&gt;which case they are trolls.

&gt;Similarly, a normal, non-flame message may have elements of a flame -
&gt;it may be hostile, for example - but it is not a flame if it is
&gt;seriously intended to advance the discussion.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;WRONG!!, I have left here for very long periods, and even while I
&gt;am
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;gone the shit about me continues. I have heard that crap before
&gt;it
&gt;&gt; &gt;JUST
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;AINT TRUE.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you did decide to ignore the flames, it would take a lot of
&gt;time
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; until your Fan Club found other &quot;kooks&quot; to entertain them.  But I
&gt;do
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; think eventually that would happen.

&gt;&gt; &gt;You see? You are CONTINUING to perpetrate a LIE. Are you a lawyer?
&gt;No,
&gt;&gt; &gt;I don't think so.

&gt;&gt; No, I'm not a lawyer.  But it's not a LIE.  &quot;Lie&quot; means there is
&gt;&gt; intent and I am speaking what I consider to be the truth.

&gt;You are lying to yourself then or you are a complete idiot. It's easy
&gt;for anyone with half a brain to see that I post one post and 30 frickin
&gt;flames post to it and I answer none.

you give them what they want they will continue following you around.
Again, you disagree with me, and that is your right.  We both agree
there is a problem and we disagree on the best solution.  That is a
very common thing in the discussion of problems, as I'm sure you know,

do what you think is best and I hope it works for you.

The only way you could do that is if your point was Wollmann's.
Since you are too smart to go for that there is no way to avoid
pissing him off without just remaining silent.

Wollmann wants censorship of all opinions that are not his own
in order to get "clients" to bilk. Anything that interferes with
his rube hunting is "abuse" and the "abuser" has to be a spinic.
The entire point of his lawsuit threats is censorship; Wollmann
needs to control the discussion because his lies cannot hold up

&gt;No, but to Edmo you are because you aren't kissing his ass.

&gt;&gt;&gt;who is STILL trying to twist this as having something to do ith
&gt;&gt;&gt;wme,

&gt;&gt;I don't think off-topic posts per se are the problem in here that
&gt;&gt;drives astrology away, though.  I think the flame war is a problem (I
&gt;&gt;know you don't want me to call it a flame war, but I don't know what
&gt;&gt;else to call it that is short and easy to read).

&gt;In other words it is Wollmann that is that problem. I know that
&gt;*I* wouldn't be here if he hadn't gone looking for support in
&gt;nanau and I'm sure many others wouldn't be either.

&gt;Wollmann wants to preach here without the criticism of his
&gt;obvious faults. That just isn't going to happen and the whining
&gt;from him just makes the criticism intensify.

&gt;&gt;I asked a question; this does not make me high or blind.

&gt;Edmo doesn't like to be questioned; he is to be worshiped
&gt;by all that aren't &quot;spinics&quot;.

&gt;&gt;You know, very few people are going to have the patience to wade
&gt;&gt;through the insults to get to the sense of your posts!

&gt;Sense?

&gt;&gt;You are in error if you seriously think my intent is to abuse
&gt;&gt;you. If I were going to abuse you, it would look a lot different
&gt;&gt;than this.

&gt;Believe me, Edmo. If Pam wanted to flame you, nothing would stop
&gt;the hurt.
">

Unfortunately, in astrology, Scorpio rising with Mars in Leo can go
with a temper.

So can Italian heritage, I'm told ;)

Mine is usually not too bad UNLESS I am in a lot of physical pain but
then all bets are off.  I often don't take my pain meds cos my legally
blind roommate and a lot of other people I know need a driver...

The worst is when I'm waiting in some line while my feet are screaming
NO MORE and someone at the counter is doing something like chatting to
friends instead of ringing me up and letting me go home...or when I
need to take migraine meds and the waiter is flirting with the blonde
at the next table instead of getting me some water to swallow the
pills with.  I worry sometimes I have stored up a lot of bad karma and
will have to wait on tables 24/7 in the next life!

&gt;For some people, it's the fact you got your point across that pisses
&gt;them off.  Eddy is one of those.  There is nothing to be gained in
&gt;trying to figure out where you might be going wrong because there is no
&gt;evidence that you are, and there's no sense wasting energy trying to
&gt;remedy a fault that does not exist.  If someone can't keep themselves
&gt;from being pissed when you are being perfectly reasonable and civil, it
&gt;is their problem, not yours.

&gt;Try something more fun with your time, like seeing what happens with
&gt;your little Leo rising when you suggest that eyes that can't close might
&gt;be broken and need replacing.  :-)

Heh!

This little one might believe me though; he was born with cataracts
and is no stranger to eye operations.

I can just see him saying ok, let's go to the eye doctor and have ice
cream on the way there.

Not when it comes from a pay phone! (or so I am told!)

Oh, we all know how much good that does! Say, how are those charges you

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I am not a lawyer, so I wouldn't know if you could get damages

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh please Ms Fake liar:

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't call you names; why do you do that to me?  I'm not fake or a
&gt;&gt;&gt;liar btw!

&gt;&gt;Then why the blatant ignoring of the truth? I do NOT answer the
&gt;&gt;so-called flamers, I DO NOT &quot;cause&quot; their abuse, I AM being defamed,
&gt;&gt;they ARE abusing the group, you DID ask that websites be put up to stop
&gt;&gt;me from stopping them, the astrologers WERE cowards for running, Keera

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Defamation= Injuring someone's character or reputation by making false
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and malicious statements about him to other people. The law recognizes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a difference between defamation and mere criticism of an individual.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Criticism deals only with matters that legitimately invite public
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;attention or call for public comment. In contrast, defamation usually
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;involves a person's private life and domestic affairs. Calling a woman
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a prostitute or a banker an embezzler, or an astrologer or consultant a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fraud on a television, radio or usenet public forum are examples of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;defamation. The term defamation includes both libel and slander.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh please Ms &quot;get all the abusers to defend her off topic rant trying

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am NOT &quot;trying to make Edmond the problem&quot;.

&gt;&gt;If you are not AGAINST the abuse and act like it, you are a part of the

&gt;&gt;Until you get this it is pointless to discuss this with you--it is

Yes, and he also cancelled many posts of people just to censor them:

http://www.smbtech.com/ed/edcancels.html

Ed Wollmann has never owned up to  his own censorious activities. In
July of 1997, he issued a  rash of over 50 illegitimate third-party
cancels for Usenet  posts with which he apparently had some issue with.
Many of  the posts he attempted to cancel made it to DejaNews, so that
it can be seen that posters were sometimes merely  criticising him.
Wollman's outrageous "Netcopping" behavior  is grevious Net Abuse. These
cancel posts were made  primarily from Wollmann's now-defunct Aznet
account  (cancelled due to multiple, seemingly endless complaints about
his abusive behavior in  Usenet.)

Wollmann complains often about his  critics "censoring" him despite
failing to ever show  evidence of cancels by anyone but the notorious
"HipCrime"  crew; a not-too-surprising result of Wollmann's off-topic
whining on nanau.In fact, many times, posts that Wollmann complains
about being cancelled are offered up to him as  viable from any number
of posters and servers. Indeed, he  has on one occasion been tripped up
trying to "frame" a  cancellation of his post on others, only to have
the cancel  message turn out to be authored by Wolmann himself.

The cancel messages below turned up  in a Dejanews search, and only
apply to third party cancels  issued by Wollmann; however the list is
not all-inclusive  and it does not include cancels made for his own  posts

Not interested in yours or Keeras comments, you have no credibility of
any kind to even challenge me.

Thank you for your response. It seems that there is an inability to stay
focused on, or to deal with, the issues at hand. I am not really
interested nor inclined to attempt to resolve personal intonations
implicate in these responses. Astrology is the alt.group hierarchy topic
for this group.

If my posts serve you use them-if they don't, don't.
I do not ask anyone to believe ANYTHING I say simply on the basis that I
said it.

One must take responsibility for their psychological reactions in
interactions with others that are not conducive to logical resolutions,
nurturing insight, or inspired conversation-and reframe them. I would
really rather discuss issues rather than personalities (which is
fallacious) and wish you the best in your pursuits. It is my sincere
hope that you can rid yourself of this negativity and pettyness. I have
faith that you can, regardless of how miserable you insist on being.

Although healthy competition is always a catalyst, I feel that this
component is out of control and is interfering in this case. I find it
unproductive and would rather not waste time in sarcasm and or blaming.
Time is very important to me and I enjoy personal development and
spirited conversation. I post on usenet with the intention of learning
and/or sharing what I know.
If in the future we can refrain from personal defenses and innuendo I
would be glad to resume with the issues at hand.
Thank you for understanding if I choose not to respond any further in
any other way than this until then.

"And in the morning of my life and in the evening of my day, I will try
to understand in what you say. Through all that life can give to you,
only true love will see you through and we'll stand beside you now in
what you say." The Moody Blues "Every Good Boy Deserves Favor"

Yes, you do. Not to mention your constantly off-topic complaints in

No, you just let yourself get involved, which perpetuates it.

No one's blaming you for their abuse. They're blaming you for your
abuse.

So, you think you deserve respect and defense just because you're a
professional? Does anything about your behavior figure into this
equation?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have said I would stop the flame war if I could.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Then tell them DIRECTLY to stop.

Stop responding to them; stop sending complaints about them; stop
provoking people. Basically stop being an asshole.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have told you what I think would help.  You disagree with me on what
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;IT _IS_ A FACT, nothing *I* do will or can stop them except others
&gt;&gt;joining me against THEM--comprende folks??? There is NO FALSE CHICKEN
&gt;&gt;WAY OUT--you must create the reality YOU PREFER--by ACTING like it.

I prefer not to defend someone who's tried repeatedly to have my
accounts terminated.

YOU, on the other hand, simply CANNOT ignore the trolls.

I dare you.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be the best tactic, which is your right.  But that doesn't make
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; me an "abuser".
&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;If you are not AGAINST the abuse and act like it, you are a part of the
&gt;&gt;problem not the solution. If you are CONVINCINGLY VOCAL against it, you
&gt;&gt;add to the momentum to STOP it. Thney have NO REASON TO STOP! Because
&gt;&gt;all of you join them in abusing me, or NOT defending me--that pits ME
&gt;&gt;against everyone else--all by myself-- and they know it. What motivation
&gt;&gt;do they have to stop if no one criticises them and everyone criticises
&gt;&gt;me????????????????????????????? Even IF I do nothing wrong?????

You think you're innocent?

&gt;&gt;Until you get this it is pointless to discuss this with you--it is
&gt;&gt;SIMPLE PSYCHOLOGY, and they have stupified and controlled ALL of you
&gt;&gt;so-called astrologers or those interested in astrology WITH IT.

No, Ed, you're blinded by the brilliance of your own ego, and
basically impervious to feedback from the astrologers here.

You also refuse to acknowledge that your inability to ignore the
baiting has reduced this group to rubble.

&gt;&gt;Where on Earth in Real Life would these idiots be able to do this and
&gt;&gt;get away with it EXCEPT here???? Can you see tham at an astrology
&gt;&gt;conference doing this??
&gt;&gt;No.
&gt;&gt;At a coffee shop?
&gt;&gt;No!
&gt;&gt;Outside my door of my residence??
&gt;&gt;No!
&gt;&gt;NOWHERE in the real world would these idiots escape punishment for what
&gt;&gt;they have done EXCEPT here.

That's probably true for you, too.

Can you imagine you calling Columbia U 300 times in one day? What do
you think would happen to you?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The ONLY defense in court for the abuse that these imbeciles heap on

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;there

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;are NUMEROUS counts that I can and will be able to prove are FALSE.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, I am not a lawyer, so I wouldn't know if you could get damages

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh please Ms Fake liar:

&gt;&gt;&gt;I don't call you names; why do you do that to me?  I'm not fake or a
&gt;&gt;&gt;liar btw!

&gt;&gt;Then why the blatant ignoring of the truth? I do NOT answer the
&gt;&gt;so-called flamers,

&gt; 3 complaints in NANAU today alone, Eddy.

&gt;&gt;I DO NOT &quot;cause&quot; their abuse,

&gt; Nope, you just make a fool out of yourself.

&gt;&gt;I AM being defamed,

&gt; How do you tarnish a rusted blade?

&gt;&gt;they ARE abusing the group,

&gt; Moi??

&gt;&gt;you DID ask that websites be put up to stop me from stopping them,

&gt; I've asked you 4 times to provide evidence and you have failed to do so.
&gt; Where's the evidence, liar?

&gt;&gt;the astrologers WERE cowards for running,

&gt; No, they just wanted peace and quiet.

&gt;&gt;Keera
&gt;&gt;DOES abuse the aam charter, and the persecution of me for 9 years IS and
&gt;&gt;was uncalled for.

&gt; Are you somehow under the impression to doing emphasis in caps is going
&gt; to make it any more true, Eddy?  You sound like a brat who thinks saying
&gt; it louder is going to get him his way, or something.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Defamation= Injuring someone's character or reputation by making false
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and malicious statements about him to other people. The law recognizes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a difference between defamation and mere criticism of an individual.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Criticism deals only with matters that legitimately invite public
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;attention or call for public comment. In contrast, defamation usually
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;involves a person's private life and domestic affairs. Calling a woman
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;a prostitute or a banker an embezzler, or an astrologer or consultant a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fraud on a television, radio or usenet public forum are examples of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;defamation. The term defamation includes both libel and slander.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Black's law dictionary-Defamation=&quot;The offense of injuring a person's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;character, fame or reputation by false and malicious statements.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The &quot;offense&quot; is in the publication of the matter, so you are not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;covered&quot; just because you read it somewhere else first. You are safe
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;ONLY if the statement is true. The best advice is to never say anything
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;nasty about anyone.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or not.  And I didn't realize you were after money...

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Oh please Ms &quot;get all the abusers to defend her off topic rant trying
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;to make Edmond the problem&quot; abuser.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I am NOT &quot;trying to make Edmond the problem&quot;.

&gt;&gt;The stand up and tell the abusers--of which there are many in this
&gt;&gt;thread to STOP blaming me for THEIR abuse! I am a PROFESSIONAL
&gt;&gt;astrologer, in an ASTROLOGY group, POSTING astrology for 9 years--and I
&gt;&gt;DESERVE respect and defense.

&gt; I piss on your bald dome again, Eddy the Eddyiot.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have said I would stop the flame war if I could.

&gt;&gt;Then tell them DIRECTLY to stop.

&gt; Beep is not a mindless droid you order around, Eddy.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I have told you what I think would help.  You disagree with me on what

&gt;&gt;IT _IS_ A FACT, nothing *I* do will or can stop them except others
&gt;&gt;joining me against THEM--comprende folks???

&gt; Admission of powerless futility, of impotent inability to defeat your
&gt; opponents on your own, NOTED! LOGGED! And LAUGHED AT!

&gt;&gt;There is NO FALSE CHICKEN
&gt;&gt;WAY OUT--you must create the reality YOU PREFER--by ACTING like it.

&gt; Stamp your feet much harder, Eddy, and you'll wear a hole through the
&gt; floor.

&gt;&gt;&gt;would be the best tactic, which is your right.  But that doesn't make
&gt;&gt;&gt;me an &quot;abuser&quot;.

&gt;&gt;If you are not AGAINST the abuse and act like it, you are a part of the
&gt;&gt;problem not the solution.

&gt; Then you agree with Dubya's philosophy, if you're not for us you're
&gt; against us, right?

&gt;&gt;If you are CONVINCINGLY VOCAL against it, you
&gt;&gt;add to the momentum to STOP it. Thney have NO REASON TO STOP!

&gt; Why should we?  YOU KEEP POSTING!  Good lord Bob why should we stop
&gt; laughing when you are still entertaining.  You really crack me up, Eddy.

&gt;&gt;Because
&gt;&gt;all of you join them in abusing me, or NOT defending me--that pits ME
&gt;&gt;against everyone else--all by myself-- and they know it.

&gt; It's what's commonly referred to as &quot;Custer's Last Stand&quot;.  It's cute, I
&gt; think I like it.

&gt;&gt;What motivation
&gt;&gt;do they have to stop if no one criticises them and everyone criticises
&gt;&gt;me????????????????????????????? Even IF I do nothing wrong?????

&gt; Criticizing me isn't going to get me to stop laughing at pointing at
&gt; you, Eddy.  Only fundamental behavioral change on your part to becoming
&gt; a respectable human being can do that.

&gt;&gt;Until you get this it is pointless to discuss this with you--it is
&gt;&gt;SIMPLE PSYCHOLOGY, and they have stupified and controlled ALL of you
&gt;&gt;so-called astrologers or those interested in astrology WITH IT.
&gt;&gt;Where on Earth in Real Life would these idiots be able to do this and

&gt;&gt;No.
&gt;&gt;At a coffee shop?
&gt;&gt;No!

&gt; Um, well, actually I'd ring up Anna on that one...

&gt;&gt;Outside my door of my residence??
&gt;&gt;No!

&gt; Gimme a break, Eddy.  It's not worth traveling to San Diego just to
&gt; heckle you at your apartment.  It's much cheaper and easier to do it
&gt; here.

&gt;&gt;NOWHERE in the real world would these idiots escape punishment for what
&gt;&gt;they have done EXCEPT here.

&gt; Quit martyring yourself, Eddy.  You're getting blood all over the floor.

&gt; Saturn Rx Op his Sun?
&gt; Saturn Rx Squ his Asc?
">

Mars conjunct South Node? 12th house Uranus and Jupiter being his
undoing? We've talked about that pair before, since they oppose his Moon
and are part of a grand cross.

If someone with this chart were to ask me why people don't see them the
way they do, I'd say it was that 1st house Pluto with square to Sun and
quincunx to Moon. That configuration is a major learning triangle. This
means that these are the planets that are constantly triggered, this is
where the native has to keep learning. Since Sun and Moon and 1st house
and 10th house are involved, it's always going to be very personal and
very intense and perhaps a bit too much too handle at times, possibly a
frustration at always having the same issues pop up.

There are "teaching aids", like Pluto's sextile to Mars and Libra, trine
to Venus, and the Sun's sextile to the 12th house pair. No one gets
challenges without also getting the means to meet them. But the Sun in
this chart is definitely in high focus, for several reasons, so identity
and recognition are the prime issue.

Knowing Ed's expression of all this here on a.a., I'd say he stopped
growing. He managed to overcome any insecurities, and gain some
self-confidence, but has yet to achieve peace of mind and perhaps even
self-respect.

Well, it looks like Ed Wollmann created his own reality, once again. He
must have chosen, on some level, for people to call and threaten him and
use foul language. Maybe he was born into it. Maybe it's a reflection of
him resisting his own growth.

Or maybe he's completely lying about it.

It's an either-or type of aspect and it can be hard to sort out the
energies (planets) involved; it's an astrological soup. With strong
conjunctions, the sign becomes prominent, so it's worth looking at the
shadow side of the sign to avoid getting tripped up by the conjunction,
but instead turn it into a solid strength. The planets involved will
matter. It _is_ easier to work with Venus and Jupiter than with Saturn
and Mars. It can feel confusing working with a pair like Jupiter/Saturn
or Venus/Mars because the planets are opposite each other. OTOH, you
have incredible strength and flexibility with such pairs.

Interesting.

I have a good friend who has Mars/Saturn in 2.  He has a good job, but
never stops worrying about money.

Taurus sun and Cancer moon and Cancer rising all accentuate that!

Well, he doesn't mind my giving out some details of his chart :)  Like
most of my friends, he regards my interest in astrology as some kind
of bizarre anomaly in my personality which can be tolerated but never
understood...my babblings about my Uranus at the top of my own natal
chart and in a grand cross notwithstanding ;)

His Mars conjunct Saturn in 2 in Cancer is square his Chiron in Aries
in 11...

k00kologist Kimberly Kay Barnard (Bachelor of Science, Psychology &amp;
longtime support group troll) tells an alt.support.depression.medication
poster what the alt.usenet.kooks awards are all about:

From: Kali &lt;K ... @lart.meow&gt;
Newsgroups: alt.support.depression.medication,alt.usenet.kooks
Subject: Linda Gore's Speech, was: Re: WINNERS! Usenet Kook Awards,
December 2004
Message-ID: &lt;MPG.1c4aeaa156adca398ae1f@news.east.earthlink.net&gt;

The awards granted by alt.usenet.kooks are the official Usenet kook
awards, Linda. They were not created for the purpose of devaluing acts
of kindness. They were created, and are maintained, for the purpose of
recognizing abusive posters. Your fellow nominees are liars, bigots,
frauds, forgers, defamers, screed spammers, people who falsely accuse
others of stalking when they themselves are the stalkers, etc. You get
the picture. If you don't, return to the above link and read.

Not just anyone can be nominated; there are standards that must be
upheld. No one may be nominated for purposes of revenge or a joke. Not
all nominations are accepted. There must be evidence of abuse. You have
generated a lot of it. You are an abuser.

k00kologist Kimberly Kay Barnard (Bachelor of Science, Psychology &amp;
longtime support group troll) tells an alt.support.depression.medication
poster what the alt.usenet.kooks awards are all about:

From: Kali &lt;K ... @lart.meow&gt;
Newsgroups: alt.support.depression.medication,alt.usenet.kooks
Subject: Linda Gore's Speech, was: Re: WINNERS! Usenet Kook Awards,
December 2004
Message-ID: &lt;MPG.1c4aeaa156adca398ae1f@news.east.earthlink.net&gt;

The awards granted by alt.usenet.kooks are the official Usenet kook
awards, Linda. They were not created for the purpose of devaluing acts
of kindness. They were created, and are maintained, for the purpose of
recognizing abusive posters. Your fellow nominees are liars, bigots,
frauds, forgers, defamers, screed spammers, people who falsely accuse
others of stalking when they themselves are the stalkers, etc. You get
the picture. If you don't, return to the above link and read.

Not just anyone can be nominated; there are standards that must be
upheld. No one may be nominated for purposes of revenge or a joke. Not
all nominations are accepted. There must be evidence of abuse. You have
generated a lot of it. You are an abuser.

There was a time when the joke was getting old and people questioned
whether to plow ahead. That's totally different from the complaints of
on-line harassment and stalking that came later on, after you had the
reigns for a while.

I remember your "Goodbye, AUK" post from a few years ago, you went over
these very issues, so I know that you're aware of AUK-abuse and have
somewhat a conscience concerning this.

The big problem is you came back, changed your mind and got the
fomaing-at-the-month stAukers back in gear. It's time for you to own-up
to your mistakes - be part of the solution and not the problem.

If you *really* wanted to honor Russ, that's what you would do, instead
of *awarding* him yet another meaningless AUK award.
