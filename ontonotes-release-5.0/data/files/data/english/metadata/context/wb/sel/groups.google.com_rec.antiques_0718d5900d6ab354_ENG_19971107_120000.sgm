If any dealers or collectors out there have any piano rolls for sale in
quanity, I would appreciate an e-mail.

Thanks, Les

Every once in awhile I hit an estate sale that has
gazillions of them, in the factory boxes.
What is the going rate for 'quanity', meaning I do not
want to get stuck with any of them should I plunk
down my money on your behalf in the future?

This is a serious inquiry Les. But also, share with the group.
