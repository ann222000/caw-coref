Abizaid raps U.S.'s extremism fight

Retired general says buildup has not succeeded
in solving Iraq's problems

The Associated Press

ADELPHI, Md. - It will take three to five years before Iraqbs
government is stable enough to operate on its own, according to the
former commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, who said the surge
of American forces has not succeeded in solving the countrybs broader
problems.

In an interview with The Associated Press, retired Army Gen. John
Abizaid also said that beyond attacking the global threat of terrorism
with military strength, the United States has done a poor job of
applying the economic, political and diplomatic means to fight Islamic
extremism in Iraq and elsewhere.

bI donbt blame it on any people,b Abizaid said Tuesday. bI just blame
it on a bureaucratic system that has been unresponsive thus far to the
challenges of the 21st century. We need to change that as a matter of
national priority.b

Abizaid retired in May after nearly four years as the top officer at
U.S. Central Command, the war-fighting organization based in Tampa,
Fla. that oversees military operations in a region stretching from the
Central Asia to the Horn of Africa. He was in Maryland to speak at a
conference on military logistics.

The United States needs to draw down forces in Iraq so the Iraqis can
take control of their own affairs, Abizaid said.

bI think in terms of time, Iraq stabilizes in the next three to five
years,b Abizaid said. bThat means we need to adjust our presence
according to the security situation.b

Abizaid opposed to 'surge'

Abizaid would not assess Army Gen. David Petraeusb handling of the war
in Iraq, saying that as a former commander he never appreciated being
critiqued on the decisions he made.

bThe fact the Iraqis want us to go, we want to go, is one that none of
us should ever lose sight of,b he said. bWebre trying to work ourselves
out of a job. But we canbt do it in a way that destabilizes the country
and allows precisely the worst thing to happen, which is the country
becomes an even greater safe haven for extremist groups such as
al-Qaida.b

While in uniform, Abizaid had been opposed to a bsurgeb of U.S. forces
in Iraq because he believed that simply building up military strength
wouldnbt solve the more deeply embedded problems.

bIt was clear that putting additional troops in would gain temporary
security,b he said. bWhat was not clear to me was what we were going to
do diplomatically, economically, politically and informationally to
make sure that we moved forward in a way that just wasnbt temporary.b

bAnd it appears to me, that those aspects, all designed to build better
governments, havenbt necessarily achieved the effect that people would
have hoped for,b he added.

Advice for next president

Abizaid said that none of the candidates hoping to replace President
Bush can responsibly call for an immediate or complete withdrawal of
American forces from Iraq and other trouble spots around the globe.

Too many other related issues are involved, he said, including the rise
of Islamic extremism, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, and the need to preserve the flow of oil
from the Middle East. Abizaid called these major and pressing issues to
be addressed.

bAny presidential candidate has got to face those facts as a matter of
reality,b Abizaid said. bThe United States is the most powerful nation
on Earth and it just canbt walk away from the Middle East and central
Asia and the Horn of Africa.b

In 2009, when therebs a new president, Abizaid said there will be an
bopportunity to rebuild some of that international strengthb thatbs
been lost since the war in Iraq began in March 2003.

But he declined to say how that global unity was lost.

bIbll just say that over time, especially with regard to Iraq, itbs
been very, very difficult to build an international consensus that was
one that people could agree on,b Abizaid said.

Asked if any of the presidential candidates have sought his advice, he
said he is bnot a political guyb and doesnbt intend to become one. He
did say, however, that he plans to speak frequently about the need to
reform the U.S. government so itbs better able to deal with global
challenges.

The 'Long War'

While at Central Command, Abizaid coined the phrase the bLong War,b a
term intended to convey the lengthy struggle the United States is
waging against Islamic extremism. But his replacement, Navy Adm.
William Fallon, ditched the phrase shortly after taking over because he
thought it suggested the United States would maintain a military
significant presence in the Middle East indefinitely.

Well regarded for his knowledge of the region, Abizaid was considered a
straight shooter during his time as Centcom chief. In July 2003, he was
the first high-ranking officer to say publicly the war in Iraq had
become a guerrilla war b a development that then-Defense Secretary
Donald H. Rumsfeld and others had refused to acknowledge.

Since retiring, Abizaid was named a distinguished visiting fellow at
the Stanford Universitybs Hoover Institution in California. He also has
formed JPA Partners, a consulting company.
