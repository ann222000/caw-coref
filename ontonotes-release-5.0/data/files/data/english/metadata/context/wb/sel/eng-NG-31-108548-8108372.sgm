Hi
I am trying to pressurize a closed tubing system using a chemical
reaction.  My goal is to pressurize a 381 cubic inch tube [969.5 cm^3]
to around 150 psi.  I was wondering if there was a chemical
combination that would produce this effect made from (preferably)
household materials, that also resulted in a non-toxic (at least not
severely toxic) gas.  I would appreciate any help in this endeavor,
thanks.

What is the &quot;tubing system&quot; rated for?  Gas compressed this much
is a safety hazard.

Water and heat.
Air and heat.
Fill the tube with diet soda and add mentos. (Does the entire
volume need to be gas?)

Combusting lighter fluid plus air makes CO2 and H2O, more or less. I think
they exploit this property in some gadget called an &quot;internal combustion
engine&quot;.

the entire systems weakest part is a 225 psi diagram valve.  Also, in
the &quot;reaction chamber&quot;, there is a 150 psi safety valve which limits
the systems pressure

there are two primary components in the system, a tank (~381 cu. in.)
and a much smaller &quot;reaction chamber&quot; (size to be determined).  The
idea is to create a chemical reaction from two separate liquids
(dispensed via quick disconnect tubes) in the reaction chamber, which
is connected to the main tank.  however, creating heat in this system
will be a problem as the idea is to make it as mobile as possible.  If
electrical heat of some sort can be used, that might be an option.
Thank You

basically, yes, only one based on a pressure release from a tank (or
expansion chamber), not on combustion

Pack the system with dry ice pellets, and
wait for them to sublimate.  Heat them,
if you're in a hurry.

On the off chance that your chosen solution (whatever it ends up
being) entails calculations based on the volume in cm^3, it might be
worth noting that 381 in^3 is actually a little over 6243 cm^3.

Nothing performs well compared to fuel/air combustion or black powder
deflagration.

A friend once sealed dry ice in a glass tube to watch it liquefy,
which takes a lot of psi's.

It liquified.

It exploded in his hand.

For six months, they tried to save his eye before giving up.

Go to Youtube.com and search on 'beer cannon montage', and follow the
links in the  associated videos to the web site where these guys built
their cannon, which used air compressed by an ordinary compressor.
They fired sand-filled beer cans from it.

The videos are pretty cool, too.
