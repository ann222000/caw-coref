With heavy rain and strong winds spreading into South West England during today, Monday 24 October, and then into the Midlands and Central South region tomorrow, Tuesday 25 October, the Highways Agency reminds drivers to take extra care on the roads.

The Highways Agency is urging drivers, especially of high-sided vehicles or those on two wheels, to take extra care during very wet and windy conditions forecast by the Met Office. The Agency will be working with the police to ensure that disruption from any accidents and incidents is minimised and traffic kept moving.

Heavy rain and spray are likely to lead to reduced visibility. Drivers should slow down and keep well back from the vehicle travelling in front because it takes longer to slow down and stop in wet weather. After driving through floods, test your brakes before you continue driving at higher speed.

Anyone driving high-sided vehicles or towing caravans should take extra care when strong winds are forecast.

Drivers are advised to check the latest information on weather and road conditions before they set off, and during their journey.

For weather conditions:
The Met Office website -  www.metoffice.com Local radio broadcasts and for road conditions:
HA website -  www.highways.gov.uk Highways Agency Information Line 0845 7504030 During severe weather, the Agency and its contractors will work with police forces and local authorities to ensure the impact on road users is minimised.

Stay safe on the roads this winter

Winter weather makes driving dangerous - but you can stay safer by following six important messages from the Highways Agency and the Department for Transport's Think road safety campaign:

1. In winter, our weather can change quickly. If there is severe weather don't travel unless your journey is essential. If you must drive, always be prepared for bad weather.

2. Plan your journey before you go. Check your route for delays and check the weather forecast. While you are driving listen to travel news on the radio. Information about current road conditions is on the Highways Agency's website  http://www.highways.gov.uk/trafficinfo .

3. In case you get stuck, keep these things in your car:
Warm clothes Food and water Boots De-icer Torch Spade 4. Take care around gritters and vehicles that clear snow. Only overtake them if you can do so safely and without going on to uncleared snow.

5. It can take ten times longer to stop when it is icy, so allow more room to slow down and stop.

6. To avoid losing control of your car because of wheel spin, use the highest gear that you can. Avoid sudden braking, acceleration and sharp turns.

Remember that tiredness kills. Take regular breaks from driving
