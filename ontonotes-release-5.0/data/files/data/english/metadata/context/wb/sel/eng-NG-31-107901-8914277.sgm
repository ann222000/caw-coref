Recently, I found a great old amplifier.  It was made in Britain and
imported into the US by British Radio Electronics, Ltd.  Here are
pictures of it and ads about it.

http://public.fotki.com/farleybob/williamson/

It has two chassis and when I first saw them from a distance, I
thought they were a pair of QUAD II's.  Then I thought they just
knocked off the QUAD look, but the amp was released in Sept. 1952,
which I think predates the QUAD.  The ads claim that the amp was
actually planned and authorized by DTN Williamson.

Does anyone else pot transformers in this fashion, except QUAD?  I
know that Williamson was had just authored a paper with Peter Walker
on the QUAD II circuit in response to the Ultralinear circuit, and
that they were working together on the ESL.  Is it possible that
Acoustical mfg.  did a run of amps under a different for Williamson?
The preamp shipped with the amp was a rebranded QC II.  Again, I'd say
it's strictly a copy of QUAD's trade dress, except that it appears
that this amp was introduced first.

If anyone recognizes this amp or who knows who manufactured it, I'd be
glad to hear.  Thanks

Yes, I got some tiny pictures of the amp.

I would pay $2 for it, but not the freight.

But probably some old giza will want to own that small part of history
and pay a few grand. One man's trash is another man's treasure....

It does lead to an interesting question though, about the casework
chronology and provenance. We all know that casework is tiresome,
timeconsuming and expensive, and no less so for manufacturers than for
DIYers. Considering the connection between Walker and Williamson, and
the fact that Acoustical was rooted in contract work, it seems to me
exceedingly likely that this amp was built for the distributor by
Acoustical in Huntingdon. (Acoustical was Peter Walker's company; it
was not called QUAD then; QUAD was the Quality Unit Audio, not a
suitable company name!).

In the QUAD (that is, first series, after the QUAD.12 and before the
QUAD II) promo/operating booklet, it is categorically stated that
Acoustical did &quot;all metal work, finishing&quot; etc in-house under the
supervision of the AID department (whatever that may be). In Britain
at this time, and well beyond the Quad II period, any manufacturer who
didn't want to lose his reputation took very great care of metal
preparation. (For instance, one of the bugbears of Rolls-Royce and
Bentley of this period is mu-metal pitting on door handles and other
brightwork one handles, ugly --and rough on fine pigskin gloves -- and
not capable of refinishing to the standard required for successful
rechroming.)

The question then arises,

a) was the Williamson designed first and found good and adapted for
the QUAD II?

OR

b) was the QUAD II designed and ready to go, and the design adapted to
the Williamson, perhaps with QUAD II bent metalwork blanks just taken
off the shelf and punched in different places?

I have no difficulty in believing that Walker would put off the launch
of his own product to produce the Williamson first. There was then
detailed bureaucratic allocation of materials, the government
deliberately gave manufacturers of exports preference in materials
allocation (you couldn't even buy the Rolls mentioned above in England
until into the 1950s -- they were all for export). Thus the
Williamson, clearly an export order, would have taken precedence, and
may well have been the mechanism which allowed Walker to launch the
QUAD II at all, perhaps with a little materials &quot;siphoning&quot; between
the projects.

The Q22, as badge-engineered for the Williamson, was already a
standing product at this time, having progressed in recognizable form
from the earlier models of QUAD amps listed above. I don't know at
what precise date the Q22 acquired the row of selector buttons along
the bottom; perhaps the Williamson was their first appearance.

***

Those of you who aren't as fascinated by QUAD II as those of us with
more culture should keep quiet either now or when we stick the pins in
your wax doll. Being fascinated by QUAD is at least better than being
obsessed by Madonna (I'm not; I left my literary publishers when they
greedily published her book of self-pornography) -- and a hundred
times better than being obsessed with Kylie, even for an Australian
(1).

I was looking for the words from which the acronym was formed in my
archive of QUAD materials. I now wonder if they ever announced what it
stands for. The word &quot;unit&quot; is repeatedly used in the literature,
admittedly more often in the combination &quot;control unit&quot;. I have seen
&quot;Quality Unit Amplifier Domestic&quot; but cannot now remember where.
&quot;Unit&quot; in this use may be what modern manufacturers more pompously
call &quot;modular&quot;; the QUAD was from the beginning intended to be part of
a *system*.

The exact name hardly matters: the two important points are that the
QUAD brought BBC *quality* into the *domestic* setting.

That even in an acronynym, however it may be derived, Walker should
honour the conventions of English, U after Q, once more demonstrates
his punctillio in everything, not only audio engineering.

Are you pulling my leg, Phil?

&quot;In-house&quot; is surely an anachronism. Besides, it sounds a bit self-
conscious to me for an Englishman of the time and place, especially
considering that Acoustical grew out of a design consultancy, where
&quot;in-house design&quot; was so axiomatic as hardly to rate a mention (and
would be offensive to customers like the BBC as implying that they
were so incompetent they couldn't do the job in their own house(1)). I
wondered whether it might mean &quot;Assurance and Inspection Department&quot;
or even more bluntly &quot;Adjustment and Inspection Department&quot;.

Wait a minute, at the time of Quad II, rich Australian graziers
were making fortunes in beef and wheat and wool sales before the prices
slumped,
and they spent huge outrageous sums of money on Quad and Leak
on sale at emporiums of distinction. The the rest of us poor battlers
could only dream, and perhaps build our own amps using 807 sold in
wartime surplus stores, and buy awful OPT from Fergesson in Chatswood,
NSW.
And instead of the Jaguars these few rich folks had, we had to buy
Morris Minors and Oxfords
and all manner of crap.
We were lumbered with the perfect crumminess of Bwitish Engweeneerwing.

The Bwitish cars rusted while you watched them, but then nearly all cars
did, because they never bothered to
paint the metal on the inside of doors and body work.

Workmanship was plain SHODDY, and it applied to nearly everything you
bought.

Designs like Quad22 and Leak all were watered down to a lowest common
denominator.

We can build far better amps right now, except due to Chinese
competition, the trend
for famous brandnames is now toward international crappiness......

I do not value Quad-II amps very highly because I know just what they
are, old junk,
and nice old junk, but still junk, like an old Morris Major.

Still, the Willys Jeep Stationwagon my dad had was a strange wonder from
the USA; maybe a lot of WW2 jeep
parts lurked under the snazzy body work.... and finally
mum got a VW beetle in '63, the Germams were pardonned. It was far more
reliable than the Morris Oxford we had.
We sure never had a German Radio, or hi-fi set, until we got a made in
Oz Kreisler stereo gram with two 5 watt
channels, and bloody awful, but then it was at least 20dB cheaper than
anything by Quad
costing a fortune.

Actually the comments were about the BBC where the accountants and bean
counters are running the place, with the usual results:(.

Quite right about some of the above it did take the UK a long while to
find out how to make cars as they ought, but then again some of the QUAD
gear is still around and in active service, where a lot of other stuff
has long been junked.....

&gt; In the QUAD (that is, first series, after the QUAD.12 and before the

If one can afford to restore a Rolls to RR standards one can afford
to restore it better-which means having those parts  filled and molds
made to make steel investment castings of them. In fact I think there
is a place selling a kit of them already done fairly reasonably.

Another substantial upgrade is the use of Oldsmobile valves in the RR

Mechanically the Jaguar, Rolls and Aston were good, but they used the
Lucas garbage electrics. Aston was David Brown and had a good
transmission: Jaguar used a US Borg Warner slushbox (mediocre)  or the
horrid Moss POS manual. Rollers had US GM transmissions, the best.

If only Jaguar had used a better transmission, better rustproofing,
and better electrics. Actually what would have been even more useful
is had they offered the Gardner 4LK engine as an alternative as Mr.
Gardner tried to tell them.

The Jaguar engine is stout but heavy. With three Webers and an
American distributor or a Scintilla Vertex mag they are pretty
reliable.

have been squeezed out of European aerospace reorganisation by the

a three speed plus torque convertor not that different from the Model 8 or

Dunno where you get the idea Lucas distributors are not reliable. Or
indeed the need to change from SU carbs. Six chokes worth of Webers will
increase the maximum power but loose the tractability. Three SUs are a

The gear ratios. And the change quality. To get sensible gear ratios you

Might have been ok in '49, but Rolls were still using it 20 years later.
Really as a hangover from their earlier vehicles where they'd modified it
to drive the mechanical brake servo for the drum brakes - and this was
still needed on the Phantoms made at the same time as the Shadows which
had discs.

Depends on how they're used. Modern multi ratio epicyclic autos only use
the TC for starting off and to cushion gear changes. Otherwise it's mostly
locked out.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;horrid Moss POS manual. Rollers had US GM transmissions, the best.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If only Jaguar had used a better transmission, better rustproofing,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;and better electrics. Actually what would have been even more useful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;is had they offered the Gardner 4LK engine as an alternative as Mr.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Gardner tried to tell them.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Jaguar engine is stout but heavy. With three Webers and an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;American distributor or a Scintilla Vertex mag they are pretty
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reliable.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Wot about the dreaded &quot;Tin Worm&quot; that used to infest British cars
&gt;&gt;&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt; too long!...

&gt;&gt;It moved into the millions of steel lintels that have been used in the
&gt;&gt;construction industry for the last few decades - the *ultimately
&gt;&gt;unavoidable* replacement of which (because people drilled lots of
&gt;&gt;holes
&gt;&gt;in them) is going to be a nice little earner for a few companies in

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; was not called QUAD then; QUAD was the Quality Unit Audio, not a

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; **  I read  &quot; QUAD &quot;  was short for  &quot;  QUality  Amplifier  Domestic &quot;  ?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was looking for the words from which the acronym was formed in my
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; archive of QUAD materials. I now wonder if they ever announced what it
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stands for. The word &quot;unit&quot; is repeatedly used in the literature,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; admittedly more often in the combination &quot;control unit&quot;. I have seen
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Quality Unit Amplifier Domestic&quot; but cannot now remember where.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Unit&quot; in this use may be what modern manufacturers more pompously
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; call &quot;modular&quot;; the QUAD was from the beginning intended to be part of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a *system*.

&gt; &gt; &gt; **  Another explanation I read  ( in an interview with Peter Walker,
&gt; &gt; &gt; IIRC  ) was that Acoustical dubbed their
&gt; &gt; &gt; first hi-fi amplifier the  &quot; QADU &quot;  for  &quot; Quality Amplifier Domestic Unit
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;.

&gt; &gt; &gt; When genteel folk rang Acoustical wishing to order one of same,  they
&gt; &gt; &gt; regularly failed to get the awkward acronym right  -  instead coming out
&gt; &gt; &gt; with all manner of weird variations.  One such folk ( possibly a tad
&gt; &gt; &gt; dyslexic) explained that he wished to purchase a &quot; Quad &quot; amplifier.

&gt; &gt; &gt; When told the correct acronym, he was clear the letters spelled QUAD.

&gt; &gt; &gt; That neat variation was seen buy management to have merit,  was adopted as
&gt; &gt; &gt; the product name and later the trademark of Acoustical.

&gt; &gt; Now this has the bizarre, somewhat edgy sound of truth!

No, the valve that fits the RR V8 is a big block Olds valve. You

Leakage past the piston of an SU isn't a problem unless it changes.
You just calibrate the spring and needle to get the right mixture
curve, and choose the damping oil carefully. Too thin and it will
hiccup when you put your foot down, too thick and initial acceleration
is compromised.

It is, in my view an utterly brilliant piece of design, in which
everything seems to do about ten different jobs, unlike the Weber
where you have to change jets for every aspect of the power curve.

And as you say, the longer piston travel of the SU makes all of that
hugely easy compared to the Stromberg.

The snag with the DCOE Webers and similar designs is the poor atomisation
at low flow rates - ie low engine speeds. It can also be near impossible
to get smooth progression. The SU alters the venturie size to keep
relative airflow speed high to aid atomisation. The downside of this is
you can't make such a clear flow path at maximum power. But for road cars
it's a good compromise. Other ways of course are twin choke designs with a
small and large venturie - but these aren't known for long reliable
service life. Other thing with fixed jet carb is there is no compensation
for the inevitable wear - an SU unless bodged or neglected can be adjusted
as needed.

Of course BL cars used SU because they owned the company. Same as GM and
Delco or Ford and Mallory. But Rolls Royce continued with SU until they
changed to injection - and cost etc can't have been a factor.

The main problem with DCOE Webers is getting the progression from the idle
jets correct. Means enlarging holes in the body or drilling one in the
butterfly. Of course not a problem if only used for racing - but a real

I used to have a pair of twin 45s on my mkI escort rally car (BDA
engine). I had it on a rolling road four or five times trying to get
that progression right. as you say, flat out was not a problem apart
from in long one-way bends when the levels in the emulsion tubes could
drop (or climb if going the other way) and the mixture wasn't right.

90% of carbs on the US road anymore, if not 95% are four barrel
Holleys with progressive operation, two small and two large. Most are
on 60s-80s V8s. But where people were converting 80s cars with TBI to
carb ten years ago, now we are seeing EFI on everything from old
Beetles to flathead Ford V8s. You have to realize that at least in
these parts the easy availablity of credit and $100/hr shop charges
have denuded the US roads of cars older than ten or fifteen years.
Last time I was in England the numbers of old cars I saw vastly
exceeded what I have seen anywhere in the US, except for a couple of
college towns and parts of Los Angeles.

Of course, we are going to see a massive credit implosion.....but
that's another matter.

My experience with the Unilite is that the sensor gets dusty and it
quits frequently, but in England maybe the damper weather keeps dust
down.  Mallory has made Unilites for decades. Drag racers like them,
and drag racers are 90% of the business.  I would be much happier if
they made one using the Chrysler system, which unlike HEI will fit the
diameter of the normal distributor and is electrically and
mechanically a lot more reliable than Unilite or the awful Ford
systems.

&gt; &gt;  Oh, they'd last longer than you wanted them. The coils would fail,
&gt; &gt; the points would shift and lose time-Mallory did a land office
&gt; &gt; business in aftermarket ones for all BL products that took Ford parts
&gt; &gt; as I recall.

&gt; All points 'shift'. If they didn't there'd be no adjustment provided.
&gt; As regards Mallory I recently fitted a Unilite to my Rover V-8 to replace
&gt; the high mileage DLM8 Lucas having been assured I'd notice a vast
&gt; improvement. And there was none. Of course if you have a modified engine
&gt; the ability to easily alter the advance curve would be useful. But mine is
&gt; standard.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or indeed the need to change from SU carbs.
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  he SU isn't that bad but needs constant maintenance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Because they are adjustable and most carbs ain't plenty felt the need
&gt; &gt; &gt; to fiddle with them. Usually while not having clue as to how to set
&gt; &gt; &gt; them correctly. The only maintenance they needed was topping up the
&gt; &gt; &gt; piston damper at engine oil change times.

&gt; &gt;  The SU is quite expensive over here, probably over there now too,

&gt; As is the Mallory. I imported direct and got it for half the UK price.
&gt; Fact of life with some imports.

&gt; &gt; and they never really had any aftermarket support over here-right or
&gt; &gt; wrong, the trend was to get away from them.

&gt; All spares were and are readily available in the UK. Burlen Fuel Systems
&gt; now make them (and fuel pumps) and have good stocks even for older models.
&gt; Of course not cheap being no longer mass produced.

&gt; &gt; I suppose they aren't all
&gt; &gt; that bad. But Webers if correctly sized and set up are the best carb
&gt; &gt; anywhere for most anything.  Eduaardo Weber SpA had the carb thing
&gt; &gt; down.  The best US one was usually a Holley: I loathed and hated
&gt; &gt; Rochesters.

&gt; The snag with the DCOE Webers and similar designs is the poor atomisation
&gt; at low flow rates - ie low engine speeds. It can also be near impossible
&gt; to get smooth progression. The SU alters the venturie size to keep
&gt; relative airflow speed high to aid atomisation. The downside of this is
&gt; you can't make such a clear flow path at maximum power. But for road cars
&gt; it's a good compromise. Other ways of course are twin choke designs with a
&gt; small and large venturie - but these aren't known for long reliable
&gt; service life. Other thing with fixed jet carb is there is no compensation
&gt; for the inevitable wear - an SU unless bodged or neglected can be adjusted
&gt; as needed.
">

90% of carbs on the US road anymore, if not 95% are four barrel
Holleys with progressive operation, two small and two large. Most are
on 60s-80s V8s. But where people were converting 80s cars with TBI to
carb ten years ago, now we are seeing EFI on everything from old
Beetles to flathead Ford V8s. You have to realize that at least in
these parts the easy availablity of credit and $100/hr shop charges
have denuded the US roads of cars older than ten or fifteen years.
Last time I was in England the numbers of old cars I saw vastly
exceeded what I have seen anywhere in the US, except for a couple of
college towns and parts of Los Angeles.

Of course, we are going to see a massive credit implosion.....but
that's another matter.

Can't remember how the provenance between the two companies worked,
but the Dell'Orto version of the Weber side draft carb seemed to do a
better job of low speed pickup.

I remember following some mods I found in Cars and Car Conversions on
an SU carb, and it really could be made to flow very well with some
strategic use of a small grinder. You just had to be careful not to
mess with the flat part of the venturi bridge, or the calibration was
screwed for good and all. A friend of mine had an Imp Sport with an
SU, and that worked best with no spring - just gravity. I suspect it
was hitting full throttle at very low airflow and actually not working
well at all; entirely inappropriate setup.

BTW, venturi doesn't have an &quot;e&quot; on the end.

90% Holleys, that seems far fetched, do you have any hard evidence to

Does that mean my twelve year old car will soon be on the scrap heap and

Interesting point was that just about the only US V-8 that ended up being

I hope it doesn't end up being as bad as some fear. It will hit the

in the UK too. But so far it hasn't happened.

The particular aluminium engines that came from Buick to Rover were
marine engines, if that gives a clue to their carburettors and tune.
If you're right and they picked up so many horses on being fitted with
SUs, they couldn't have put out more than about 110-120hp in US trim.
We had one out of a Rover Coupe on the dyno in the middle 60s and it
was good for less than a four and a quarter Bentley engine, which was
pretty choked and good only for a smidgin under 130bhp. (I seem to
remember people often spoke of 135 horses for that engine in the Mk
Vi.) We were looking at the Rover V8 because back then it was the only
engine we knew with any power that two guys could pick up between
them, a wonderful thing. It wasn't much chop though; a very unreliable
engine if you breathed on it even lightly. Still, a decade later it
made the SD1 into one of the greatest cars BL ever built; such a pit
they didn't see fit to carry forward the second-best thing about the
P8, the De Dion rear axle, a beautiful thing of 300B-like purely
linear motion..

Just as a mattter of historical evidence, Ford apparently between the
wars made their flathead V8 in England, possibly in a tax-friendly
smaller size as well. I spoke to someone only at the beginning of the
summer who had once owned such a British Ford V8; he said it was the
only one he ever saw at the shows he went to; it is probably logical
that the British preferred the lower-tax fours.

This basic engine block was sold in the US by both Buick and Oldsmobile,
but equipped with radically different head designs.  On other engines
the Oldsmobile heads had bigger valves and could flow more air than the
Buick heads which due to their somewhat odd design couldn't accommodate
valves as large as the Oldsmobile heads, I assume the same rule held on
this engine.  Also the Oldsmobile version of the engine was sold in two
different states of tune, one with a 2V carburetor and the other with a
4V carburetor and a different cam.  I can't remember if Buick offered a
version in a higher state of tune like the Oldsmobile.

I don't know if it has any relation to the engine you are speaking of,
but Ford also had a smaller flathead V8 that was sold for a few years in
the US, also &quot;between the wars&quot; IIRC.  A friend and I shoehorned one of
these into an MG-TC.

Surely they have French, German and Italian cars over there-they did
