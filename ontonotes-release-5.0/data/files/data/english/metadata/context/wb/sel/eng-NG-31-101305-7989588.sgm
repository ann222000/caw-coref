All the airlines have checked baggage dimension restrictions that top out at
80 inches (length + width + height), but I'm not seeing any (non-folding)
bicycle container that's 80 inches or less.

What's the deal?  I guess the odds are pretty small that they'll reject my
bike when nobody else on earth is complying, but it's a little unsettling to
think that they could arbitrarily enforce this restriction at any time.

I was confused by the wording.  Re-reading it, it looks like a bicycle isn't
generally subject to the 80-inch restriction (nor the weight restriction).
I'm expecting a $50 charge each way, though. (Southwest one way, Jetblue the
other)

The limt on AA is 110 inches, unless you have their bike box, which is
118 inches.

I am paying $100 each way to get to and from France on my bike.

I guess airlines are now charging for bikes on international flights.  They
didn't use to.  Coming back from Italy in June, a USAir representative
checked to see when we made our flight reservations, because if we had
made them after some certain date, they would have charged us to bring
our bikes back with us.

Bummer.

I surmised that it was because the size of Jim's bike is over the limit even
for the international flight exception.

Yes.  Likely to require a military airlift on a C-130 Hercules.  Jim,
good luck in PBP and please let us know of your adventure when you
return.

Wes

Hi,

First of all, Jim, good luck to you on PBP! That is an awesome adventure.
Have fun with it, too.

Also, for the rest of you, don't forget that if you buy an annual license
from USA Cycling, for $60, you get two airline vouchers to fly your bike for
free on United Airlines. I think they normally charge $80 each way. These
vouchers work for my tandem as well!

Cheers,

Ron

I believe that the USAC / United Airlines voucher program ended last year
(if not before).  Here's a list of current USAC membership benefits:

Thanks for the tip, but I'm with AA.  In fact I booked this trip to
France on frequent flier miles, for the princely sum of $68.  Given
that, the $100 for the bike transportation does not bother me.  And my
bike box fits within the limits.  It just costs $100 each way to fly
the bike international.
