There were over 25  people who were unwittingly exposed to my singing
voice (Hell, they wanted everybody to sing).
Afterwards, we played a couple of board games which I had never played
before. Fun though I really sucked at one and made a really stupid
error that I can't even blame on the booze.

I went to Joann's this morning at 6 AM. What a zoo that place was - and
forget the stories about shoppers clobbering each other over the head at
Best Buy for a Wii - you ought to see these old ladies when you fuck with
their 99 cents a yard flannel. They'll think nothing of slapping you in the
face with a bolt of fleece.

We didn't do turkey, we did ham.  Today we're doing turkey at my sister's
mother-in-law's house, with my sister's in-laws.  I am so not looking
forward to this.

I woke up for some reason at 3am, and went to get a glass of water.  On the
way back to my room, I stubbed my toe on the vacuum cleaner, which Daddy had
helpfully left out to &quot;remind&quot; me to vacuum.  Because, you know, simply
asking me to vacuumn doesn't have the subtlety of leaving the vacuum cleaner
out.  I woke them up with my thrashing and swearing.  Serves them right.

For revenge, I'm folding all of Daddy's undwear wrong-side out.  I may also
mis-match his socks.

Well, the turkey turned out quite well, with very moist white meat and
there are plenty of leftovers for the kids to eat today while The Hub
and I take off for Atlantic City to throw away money. The kids will
likely to with friends all day and there is plenty left to feed the
crowds. We'll be back mid evening to clean up.

And the lemon meringue made with Splenda and an almond crust was quite
nice - certainly not a &quot;classic&quot; LM pie, but very good in its own
right.

Twin B hated the mashed made with blue potatoes...and it went so well
with the table cloth and china.

No family affairs that I was aware of. The folks were invited
somewhere miles away. I was invited to but I opted to work yesterday
and today and then take a day off where it's something I actually want
to do next month.

Ate frozen pizza, salad and Habanero Doritos. Went for a walk on the
eerily silent streets around 8:00 to return something to the library.
Could actually hear the streetlight buzzing which is rare. Also walked
by a closed Dominoes Pizza and could hear the phone ringing inside.

I had a dream about the long dead family cat. On Thanksgiving she
would hide in the closet and I would sneak her turkey.

I had the motorhome serviced a couple of weeks ago: new shocks, new
brakes, and some minor maintenance.

We left Thursday morning to go up to Sacramento, to my brother's.
About a third of the way there, the serpentine belt slipped and then
came off, broken.  We called AAA and had it towed to the nearest
repair place, which was, of course, closed.  We left the keys and a
note in the drop-off box, called my brother to say what had happened,
and called a taxi.  It cost $100 to get home.

The we went to Carrows -- most other places were fully reserved, and
we didn't want any hassle.  Mi esposa had their turkey dinner combo,
whch she said was much better than any home-cooked turkey she could
remember.  I had their Carne Asada, which was delicious, and much
better than any turkey I've ever tasted.

This morning, I got a call from the repair place, asking what the
truck was there for.  (It was very thoroughly explained on the key
envelope, in the drop-of box, but...)  They'll call back later with
the estimate.

Some time next week, I'll take up the issue with the shop that did
the original maintenance and installed the serpentine belt.  I think
they should eat the repair costs and the taxi fare.

The wife and I usually go to her parents, who live about a half hour
away.  This year, with the wife liable to pop out a child at any
moment, her parents instead did up a full Thanksgiving dinner and
transported it to our house, along with two of her brothers and paper
plates.  The idea was that this arrangement was flexible in case of
sudden changes in plans, but since their house is actually closer to
the hospital than is ours, the logic was not entirely clear to me.
But Thanksgiving dinner delivered has something to be said for it, and
a good time was had by all other than the afternoon football game
being a snoozer.

Otherwise, though, all is reasonably well.  My sister and her
boyfriend brought over their dog yesterday, so it took a while for the
cats to come out of hiding, but they've emerged again.  The younger
cat, who has never found anything so interesting as whatever it is she

Very pleasant.  Simple turkey dinner with green beans and rolls and
stuffing and apple pie.  There was a little too much carpet cleaning,
since one cat was throwing up and the dog had an accident, but at least
we were home with plenty of time.

Then we watched &quot;Hollywood After Dark&quot; with commentary by The Film Crew,
which is three of the MST3K guys doing essentially the MST3K schtick.
Rue McClanahan as a stripper.  The other actors in the film pretty much
literally never worked again.  All the strippers, including McClanahan,
were the most lumpy, average-looking women you can imagine.  Weren't
there any cute girls in 1965?  Were all the cute 1965 girls so classy
that they wouldn't appear in dreck like this?  Because I'm betting you
could round up better-looking women at the Denny's in Culver City and
they'd agree to play strippers in a grade-Z movie.

We watched it using the Netflix &quot;Watch Instantly&quot; option.  I will need
to hook the computer up to the TV next time because both of us craning
our necks to watch the laptop didn't work all that well.  Wonder what
cables I'll need.

Well, the repair place called -- apparently, the air-conditioner

I wonder what this says about the modern idea of one &quot;serpentine&quot; belt
weaving among many power drops versus the old idea of several belts in
parallel running one or two of fan, alternator, water pump, air
conditioner etc.  If your air conditioning seized, you didn't lose the
water pump or alternator.

(dropping the fan from the fan belt made sense when engines were
turned sideways.  I'm surprised that my current car uses electric
power steering, but I don't understand the internals of power steering
anyhow.)

My last three laptops have come with an &quot;S-Video&quot; socket.  One of

figure 206 on the page below shows a close-up of the S-vid jack

If your laptop doesn't have that jack, then you probably need an
expensive NTSC video card in the PCMCIA or USB connection.

I cooked my first Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks to all who weighed in
with suggestions.

The turkey took longer than it was supposed to, but came out moist. I
mostly followed Boron's directions. But an online guide suggested
lifting up the skin and slathering melted butter underneath it rather
than on the outside. So I did that. I think I should've done it on
the outside too, though, just to get a more golden brown look.

In addition to turkey, I made:

- Creamed spinach
- Sweet Potato Casserole
- Mashed potatoes and Turkey gravy made from the drippings
- Stove Top stuffing. (Sorry. It was a one-man show. I had to cut
corners.)
- Cranberry sauce from a can, both lumpy and smooth kinds. (No
apologies. I like this stuff.)
- Brown and serve rolls from the store. (Thanks to whoever reminded
me about rolls. I would've forgotten.)
- Cream cheese salad dessert (I added twice the amount of water I was
supposed to, but it turned out well anyway. It set up and was light
and fluffy rather than dense.)
- Pecan and Pumpkin pie (again, store bought).

All in all, it was a good combination of homemade and store bought
that wasn't too exhausting to prepare. I was done preparing
everything I could with the turkey still needing another two hours.
So I took the opportunity to clean up the whole kitchen and run a
load of dishes. That helped considerably. When the meal was over and
it was time to clean up, I didn't already have a counter full of
dirty dishes. Everything fit in a single dishwasher load.

Mrs. Penguin, who has been working awfully hard and is exhausted, got
to sleep in and relax for the whole day. I was very glad for that.

In the evening we re-watched _Serenity_ (TMNTE). I found it quite
entertaining. My previous objections still stand. But I think I was
able to enjoy the positive aspects more this time around. I still
think the final battle scenes--both with the group and between mal
and the Operative--were junky and more confusing than climactic. But
overall, I think our biggest mistake in seeing the movie the first
time was this: We re-watched the whole series immediately prior.
_Serenity_ was a good movie, but it just can't live up to that. It
was better to see the movie this way, when we hadn't seen the series
for a while, and we were delighted to see the old gang again.

Also very quiet and normal.  I got another repeat done on the lace

We had 23 people over (of which only three were related by blood, my
husband and his parents) and enough food for at least three times that
many. The dude and I made:

1 roasted turkey
1 smoked turkey (this was voted the favorite)
Ham glazed with a Steen syrup, white wine, ground clove mix
Fresh green beans
Corn maque chou
Mashed potatoes
Crawfish dressing
Cranberry sauce
Roasted poblano salad

His mom made pumpkin pie, cornbread dressing, and the gravy

Other people brought:
Sausage dressing
Sweet potato pie
Green bean casserole
Squash casserole
Butternut squash soup
Macaroni &amp; cheese
Spinach &amp; artichoke dip
Pecan pie
Chocolate pecan pie
Pumpkin cheesecake
Homemade ice cream
Fresh rolls

I may have forgot something.  Today I am brain dead and my body feels

We had to take our turkey and other comestibles and go make dinner at my
brother's house because our kitchen is still without water or a stove.
However, I have it on good authority (from my husband, who is doing the
remodeling) that we'll have water today and maybe even a dishwasher.

The sink looks wicked cool, it's black granite.  And I have never, ever

I slept till about noon.
Then I got up.

I tried to get ahold of my brothers to see if they were doing anything,
one's phone has been disconnected, and the other had a turkey in the oven,
but didn't sound excited about me going over there, so I decided to stay
where I am. The people at the place I am staying had a fairly traditional
turkey dinner, with a roast bird, some brown and serve rolls, mashed
potatoes (they let me do the mashing) salad, dressing, and pumpkin pie for
laters. Well, the ingredients were fairly traditional, but they don't tend
to eat together, and last night was no exception. I offered to do the
dishes, but was told not to worry about them. There was also some
sparkling grape juice that caused the young boys (5 and 7) of the house to
go around pretending to be drunk.

&gt;The wife and I usually go to her parents, who live about a half hour
&gt;away.  This year, with the wife liable to pop out a child at any
&gt;moment, her parents instead did up a full Thanksgiving dinner and
&gt;transported it to our house, along with two of her brothers and paper
&gt;plates.  The idea was that this arrangement was flexible in case of
&gt;sudden changes in plans, but since their house is actually closer to
&gt;the hospital than is ours, the logic was not entirely clear to me.
&gt;But Thanksgiving dinner delivered has something to be said for it, and
&gt;a good time was had by all other than the afternoon football game
&gt;being a snoozer.

&gt;Pointer?
">

Filling recipe as I ditzed with it (the original is on the Splenda
site)

Makes a 9&quot; pie

1 1/2 cups Splenda
1/3 cup cornstarch
1 3/4 cups water
4 egg yolks, lightly beaten
3 tablespoons butter
3/4 cup fresh lemon juice
1 1/2  tablespoon grated lemon peel

Whisk together 1 1/2 cups Splenda, 1/4 cup cornstarch, 1 3/4 cups
water and egg yolks in a non-aluminum heavy saucepan. Cook over medium
heat, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens and comes to a boil.
Boil 1 minute, whisking constantly. Remove from heat. Whisk in butter,
lemon juice and lemon peel. Pour into pastry shell.

The meringue I simply improvised, beating the egg whites with a tad of
cream of tartar, about a quarter cup of Splenda and a teaspoon of
vanilla. I piped it on the pie and baked it at 400 degrees until it
browned.  It gets crunchy on top, unlike sugar based meringue. Rather
tasty

The crust I found at another site, but I do not recall where.

INGREDIENTS:
&quot;  1 and 1/2 cups almond meal or almond flour
&quot;  3 tablespoons melted butter
&quot;   3 tablespoons Splenda

PREPARATION:
Melt the butter (if the pie pan is microwave safe, melt the butter in
it) and mix the ingredients up in the pan and pat into place with your
fingertips. (this is a breeze to do, BTW)

I docked it and blind-baked it at 350 degrees for about 15-20 minutes.
Keep an eye on the it, though. The measures are for a 9&quot; pie &amp; I made
a 10&quot; deep dish, so my timing on it being done may be off a bit. Do
not let it get as dark brown as a regular pastry crust.

I always make a lot of extra meringue, as I drop spoons of it onto a
baking sheet and make cookies for nibbling before dinner.  The Splenda
ones were actually better than the sugar based one. We call these
meringues &quot;Angel Turds.&quot;

If you don't really care about &quot;styling&quot; or &quot;proving your masculinity
with your vehicle&quot;, then you should be price driven.  That could in
turn be interpreted as minimizing your ongoing fuel costs, or
minimizing the repairs needed over time, or maximizing the resale
costs if you resell it in three or five or fifteen years.  Or by just
minimizing the purchase price.

When I was looking for my most recent car a year ago, I came up with
three &quot;finalists&quot;.  One was worth $27K, but makes a political
statement and halves the gas outlay per year.  Another cost somewhere
between $17K and $25K depending on styling choices.  The third was
under $12K for reliable basic transportation.  If the average car
price is indeed over $30K now, a new car for $12K gives you an awesome
head start on spending the money elsewhere.

From what you describe, my third finalist, the Suzuki Swift Plus,
negotiable down below $12K if you borrow the money elsewhere and pay
cash, is probably a contender.  Looking at cheap, reliable used cars
didn't seem to provide many choices I would consider reliable much
below $8K and the difference between that and the $12K didn't seem to
be worth going used.

(I ended up going with a used version of my first choice, the
&quot;political&quot; gas miser.)

Not necessarily. It's possible to expect performance or comfort or size
without caring about styling and masculinity.

Given certain minimum requirements in those areas, I am price and

factor. I'm not so much worried about being stranded as about having to

&gt;True.  I should have mentioned comfort.  Or maybe even performance.

The &quot;Swift Plus&quot; carries the name from a previous generation of
Swifts.  Those earlier ones lasted longer than equivalent Nissans and
such and vastly longer than anything equivalent from Detroit.  Up
close to the Toys and Hondae.

Mine from that previous generation lasted 130,000 miles and 14 years
so far, and is still willing to start, unheated, in the depths of a
-35 degree Calgary winter.

I'm not sure how much the current &quot;swift plus&quot; has in common with the
previous swift that was also sold as the Geo Metro, Pontiac Firefly,
Chev Sprint.  But it's no Lada, Yugo or Chevette.

Turkey and the standard sides at my in-laws', very nice dinner with
the entertaining side show of The Girl turning purple trying not to go
off on one of her cousins who was blithely nannering on about how neat
it is to work at one of those fake-abortion places that pretend to be
abortion providers until they get the women in and then sit on them
and pray for a few days.  That was funny.  Apparently I married the
whacky liberal of the family.  Oh, and there was a scathing review of
the 'liberal media' which included FOx, which I found interesting.  I
recommended the BBC and The Economist, neither of which the parties
had listened to or read, so that should turn out well.

But then Friday sucked, I had some medals on order for a fencing
tournament Saturday, to have been ready Wednesday, on which date I
discovered the bastards were already closed up for Thanksgiving.  My
faint hopes they might open Friday were dashed.  So Friday morning I
ran to WalMart and bought a set of bamboo coasters, got The Girl to
draw a turkey with an epee in its hand, went home to my comforting
shop and its several gallons of epoxy which in my experience cures all
ills, and turned out these:

http://tinyurl.com/25qf9c

which were not perfect, you can see the glue under the cardstock kept
the epoxy from penetrating and made the thing a bit splotchy, but I
was happy with them for having a day to get them done, they're a
crafty-er sort of thing than I usually attempt and everyone seemed to
like them.

And then I actually fenced in the tournament, it was most amusing.  In
the final I was like a trip down memory lane, trying to figure out
what part of my now-fifteen year out of practice game I still had at
some sort of speed, as I got further and further behind.  Ha!  So
funny.  Cripes I'm old.

So anyway, Thanksgiving was good.  Thanks for asking.

The first quoted statement says that unless you care about styling or
masculinity, you should be price driven. I pointed out that there are
other things to consider besides styling and masculinity that may
lead to not buying the cheapest car available. I don't think you're
disagreeing. But I'm not sure what you're saying.

How about the common situation where someone wants something cool but
that desire has nothing to do with masculinity proving?
