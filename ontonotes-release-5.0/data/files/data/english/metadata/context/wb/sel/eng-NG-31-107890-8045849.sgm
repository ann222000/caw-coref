I'm looking for unusual Broadcast Reception letters from the 30s and
40s.  These were sent as the verification that some listener heard a
particular broadcast station at a given time and may have had an EKKO
stamp attached..

Kinda like QSLs, only for broadcast listeners.

But of course, they were QSLs, just not cards.

They didn't bother printing them up because they got few such reports.
Or maybe it even predates the notion of QSL cards, I don't know when
they started to appear.  But the reception reports were sent in,
and the QSLs verified their correctness.  It means nothing that they
were individually written letters rather than QSL cards.

Stations that got a lot of attention would have had cards printed up,
just like more modern SW stations have actual QSL cards, because they
know they'll be getting reception reporst.
