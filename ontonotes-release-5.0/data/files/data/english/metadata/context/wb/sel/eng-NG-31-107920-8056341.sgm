I think I'm in the minority here, but I think Alonso drove a great race.

He passed Heidfeld and Fisichella, was almost perpetually in the dirty air
of another driver and yet continued to harass and try just about anything
to get past - though never to the point of 'binning' the car. We all know
how hard it is to pass, but Alonso made it look like it was always a
possibility.

Considering the penalty of starting 10th, he was 26 seconds behind Hamilton
after the last stop (and stuck behind Fisichella). I don't think McLaren's
pit strategy was quite what it should have been for him either.

His gutsy pass of Heidfeld reminded me of a Montoya move: let me past or we
both wreck.

He did drive a good race.

Now to really fan some flames.  I sure would like to see Scott Speed in a
REAL car.  He has driven well in a few races with his barge.  I would really
like to see what he could do in a better car.

Yeah, eventually. And after screwing up other oppertunities.

I am (was?) an Alonso fan, but this year his driving stinks. He was
awful at passing (in what was a much faster car). Trying to overtake
Fissi (IIRC) on the outside (when Hamilton had already shown how to pass
at the same corner on the INSIDE, was embarrassing.
I can't believe any of the front three couldn't have passed Heidfeld
with ease.

Surprised that no one mentions his two &quot;off road&quot; at the beginning of
his 3rd stint. Definitely cost him P6 as Fisi rejoined maybe 1 sec in
front of him, and possibly even P5.

Note that I certainly enjoyed his &quot;flat out&quot; style but at the end of
the day, and once again, he can only blame himself for lost points.

Nothing I'd like better than seeing all 4 of the leading drivers (not
to mention the rest of the field) driving to the best of their ability.

I don't think we are seeing this from Alonso. At least I hope not.

I did wonder at some points during the race that if Alonso couldn't
come up with a better plan he may as well let NH get on with it and
stop slowing them both down by half a second a lap.

GF was only a couple of seconds up the road. Catching him would
possibly  have opened up some opportunities.

McLaren screwed up yesterday. Fortunately other than having to tangle
with Kubica Hamilton was unaffected. Alonso should have been 4th or
5th. His ballsy or desperate pass on Heidfeld was too little too late.

McLaren have often been a let down where strategy is concerned. I think
both Alonso and McLaren should be capable of upping their game.

The difference between gutsy and reckless can be subtle indeed, a matter of
the very finest of timing and track positioning, and the driver's
historical success rate for similar manoeuvres.

Off the top of my head I can't remember a failed Alonso move that took out
the other driver..?

You are right about Alonso in this case (proving once and for all that a
broken clock is right twice a day).

Alonso drove a great race.
As for his constant move to the outside, brilliant.  If you can't pass
someone at least try to hassle them into a mistake.

Alonso is a great driver caught up in a team, and sport, obsessed with
his team mate.  Poor fucker

&gt; Nothing I'd like better than seeing all 4 of the leading drivers (not
&gt; to mention the rest of the field) driving to the best of their ability.

&gt; I don't think we are seeing this from Alonso. At least I hope not.

&gt; I did wonder at some points during the race that if Alonso couldn't
&gt; come up with a better plan he may as well let NH get on with it and
&gt; stop slowing them both down by half a second a lap.

&gt; GF was only a couple of seconds up the road. Catching him would
&gt; possibly  have opened up some opportunities.

&gt; McLaren screwed up yesterday. Fortunately other than having to tangle
&gt; with Kubica Hamilton was unaffected. Alonso should have been 4th or
&gt; 5th. His ballsy or desperate pass on Heidfeld was too little too late.

&gt; McLaren have often been a let down where strategy is concerned. I think
&gt; both Alonso and McLaren should be capable of upping their game.
">

It is a blurry line between overdriving and being aggressive. I expect
Fred is probably just on the wrong side of aggressive but at the same
time definitely not in the pass-or-crash mode that I often thought JPM
was. He gets away with (many?) slight mistakes and so there's obviously a
degree of control there.

It's hard to know if he's at his best and feels the need to do this or is
a little rattled. Schu didn't seem to rattle him (maybe a little) but
inside your team and when you're so far behind the psychology is very
different, isn't it?

But the only reason there is such an interest in his team mate is
because his team mate has proven to be a better driver even though it is
only his first year. There is no doubt that at the beginning of the
year, if McLaren wanted to put more resources behind a driver, it would
have been Alonso as he would have been who they were pinning their hopes
on in terms of winning the world championship.

Mclaren failed Alonso int he race.

Alonso did pass Rosberg and heidfield on the track but due to  poor
strategy he foun dhimself behind them again.
Alonso also showed that F1 is boring and regulations need to be
changed.
Even with a faster car Alonso had to be very aggressive to be able to
pass I believe Rosberg.

Within reason Webs, within reason.

Have to bring MotoGP into this, but look at those guys. It's the
riders who make it hard to pass each other, but there is plenty of
room provided to try and there is minimal effect of being in one's
dirty air.
In F1, as you close up, you lose up to a third of your downforce and
find that even if you could still make the pass, there is no frigging
space to do so, given that your options are cut short by the loss of
grip.
That loss of downforce is not due to driver skill. It is part of the
carefully designed aero package, made to make the air behind as dirty
as possible. It was said on an F1 show that around 20% of aero work
goes into the envelope that will be coming off the back of the car.
Fair ? I don't think so. Your passing another car should be your skill
and equipment against the driver's in front. With natural, *not
induced* loss of traction making it a bit harder.

Gets away is the operative. JPM got away with a few too but i'd guess
that his pass count would be favorable to that of Alonso's, at least
while with Williams..
I think JPM's problem was that there was not many fair racers, like
Heidfeld, Kubica and Alonso to race against and passing was just as
hard back then.
The pass that Alonso made on Nick, think about it, do you think
Schumacher would have accepted that he was out done and driven over
the green stuff to allow him room ? Hell no, Alonso would have been
forced wide onto the grass. Ask Nick about Australia 3-4 years ago in
a similar situation against MS.

It is and i think Alonso shines when at the front, from where he can
control the race as well as any previous hot shot. MS included.
But here, he has a great car and if it wasn't for that little newbie
and bastard Ron, he could have his third title.. So IMO, he is rattled
and trying a bit too hard. He needs to calm down and do his own thing.

Within reason, of course. As I wrote, passing shouldn't be *too* easy.
It should be a bit easier though. As for MotoGP, to me it is too easy
there. The driver behind gets too big an advantage slipstreaming the
bike in front. A slower bike can overtake a faster one. This has lead
to a situation, where positions at the front are irrelevant before the
last few laps (assuming nobody's pulled away). It's actually more
advantageous not be in front, which is kind of warped.

Naturally there's more room to try, since bikes are narrower than
cars.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; and equipment against the driver's in front. With natural, *not

I agree on that. It should be about skill, not about the help you get
from slipstream. The rules concerning the back end of a F1 car should
be changed. But it would still be &quot;induced&quot; help of slipstreaming,
since the rules dictate it. &quot;Natural&quot; is a word I find hard to connect
with something so strictly controlled.

But there's another problem: dirt. With one optimal line, it's very
hard to overtake even without the loss of downforce in faster corners.
I don't think this problem is as bad with bikes. I also think there's
very little to be done about it.

Banzai move?  Bit of an exaggeration. Classic end-of-straight outbraking
manoeuvre, as seen in hundreds of races. Alonso's pass at the chicane
was a banzai move, but not Lewis's on Kubica. Kubica didn't even defend!

Indeed. Alonso was dealing with a much smarter defensive driver than
Lewis. Kubica didn't defend properly, and really should've received a
bollocking for such sloppy driving. Fisi has been publically humiliated
for less.

I think you can be 150% sure that if he'd even had a peep down the
inside of Heidfeld, Alonso would've gone for it. Have you forgotten 2005
and 2006 so soon?
