It could have been 10 times longer, covering more countries, and it
could have included other main factors behind many historical events.
They say in this movie that this is not the only factor behind
historical events, but a very important side of what has happened in
world history, and I agree.

Do you think killing a hundred million human beings during the 20th
century alone, is something some really good people would have done?

Which populations are you thinking about?

I don't think you have actually seen the movie, because it mentions no
population which has gained more than it has lost from the
manipulations of these "money masters".

You don't have to be especially gifted to play an economic game, you
just need to know how it works.
.
Watch the movie and you will understand how it works too.

To understand the world history you need to have watched this movie.
In addition to that information you need to understand the role of
religion, real practical religion, not the ideology the religious
people hide behind.
Social traditions, gender roles, bullying, violence, male honor,
manipulative women, etc..

You need to understand that religion was seriously challenged
theoretically around the year 1500, when new ideas like humanism
versus theism, secularism versus religion, democracy versus religious
dictatorship gained strength enough to break the rule of the pope.

Since then we live in the era of enlightenment, spreading these new
ideas and struggling against reactionary ideas which try to stop the
advancement of the new ideas, secularism, equality, democracy, and
individual freedom.

Democracy lead to socialism, when the workers joined the class
struggle with worker's unions, worker's education, and millions of
poor people outvoted a few rich.
.
The pope saw this as a big problem, because with democracy and
socialism came secularism and individual freedom.

We are still in the process of abolishing religion and the rule of the
rich.
Watch this movie, and read my articles in alt.society.futures, and you
will know everything you need to know about the world history, and
what we can do about it.

Yes, to treat the point. In print form it could be a set of books - 10

This topic is not new. This film re-addresses the same issue that has been
addressed since the founding of the United States. It reached it's first
major peak during Andrew Jackson's time. Also, true conservatives AND true
liberals (YIKES!!) have kept this issue alive since then in their own
different ways.

However, this still needs tending to. Even though it is an old issue, the
horrors that come from it are as new as tomorrows headlines as this film
illustrates.

The generation that pulls the plug on this will be the greatest
generation that ever lived on this earth. This is not an exaggeration.
The best thing about this battle is that the weight of time is against
them.

Once we all come out of our gadget stupors, this jig will be up.

The most important issue to spread is the question;
How do you want the society to work?

When enough people have agreed on a vision of the future society we
can win the election and start realizing that vision.

The main hinder is that people are filled with anger, and want to get
an outlet for that anger. They want to find somebody to hate and
somebody to attack.

They do not realize that they are doing exactly what the enemy wants
them to do, go out on the streets and fight with the police.
That doesn't lead anywhere.

What we really should do is to create a vision, discuss and spread
that vision peacefully, so we can start political parties with that
vision as program, and vote for a better society.

Help people concentrate on the most important issue, how do you want
the society to work?

Do you want a lot of individual freedom?
Do you want material equality?
Do you want an open democratic system or do you want a few rich people
deciding the important issues about our world secretly?

Write down your own vision, and compare it with others, develop your
vision when you get new ideas or when people make you realize that
something in your vision is not such a good idea.

Have both an advanced vision and a program for today.

My advanced vision is a moneyless society where all work is voluntary
and everybody have the same amount of personal property. But today I
vote for the socialists in general elections in my country, because
they are closer to my future goals than the conservatives, the
religious rightwing parties.

When more people support the idea of a moneyless society and
individual freedom we can work together to make that vision known and
more accepted.

The socialists in my country want to abolish capitalism and the
kingdom, but they say that doing that today would not be good for the
swedish people.
We would be economically and politically isolated like Cuba.

The governments in many countries have a similar standpoint, Russia,
China, India, Canada, Latin America, Europe. As long as capitalism is
strong and the money system is backed up by USA and the strongest
military power in the world we need to continue with this compromise,
a little capitalism and a little socialism.

We are all waiting for the american people to become intelligent
enough to take control of their own government and military forces.

Sorry, Roger, but people may not choose the kind of society in which they
live, except by moving to a different one if they don't like their present
one, or by withdrawing from it altogether.

The reason for that is that a society is nothing but people, and "realizing a
vision of a furture society" would involve choosing who those people shall be
and how they live their lives. Since no person may make those choices for
even one other person, they may not choose the kind of society in which they
live, except as noted above.

I know you do not like democracy, but fact is that we live in a
democracy, and when enough people want to change it we can change it.
Democracy = the people rules itself.

That is an option for you, who do not like democracy.

http://wikihost.org/wikis/program/wiki/start

Program

This is a simple and practical political program most people can
support.

Private property
Everybody can register the same amount of private property, like cars,
houses, apartments, boats, etc..
Special rules for children of different ages, they get a part of a
grownup's
amount of property to be handled by the parents.
When this program is implemented the ones who have less than the
average
can register more private property for free until they reach the
common limit,
the average. Those who have too much can only register the same amount
as
everybody else so they must give the rest to the society.

Consumption
Everybody has the same right to consumption of consumption stuff,
like food, clothes, etc..
Most simple consumption stuff is not checked in any way, just get it
for free at the supermarket. A few things like airplane travelling,
russian caviar,
must be divided fairly among all people, using a personal consumption
card.

Individual freedom
Everybody can choose for themselves what to do.
There is no money system, all work is voluntary.

We simply assume that enough people will work in the production of
food
to satisfy the needs for everybody. This needs less than 2% of the
people and
the food production is being further rationalized with time.

The rest of the production depends on what people want to produce, it
is up
to each person to contribute in any way he likes to the society.

He or she can also choose to do nothing if he likes. Freedom of the
individual
is more important than production results, and we are still convinced
that enough
people will contribute with things that are useful for us all.

Look at the open source and freeware software production, for example.
Millions of software writers are already today producing
software without getting paid for it.
A lot of people like to do things that are useful, or which generate
happiness,
like musicians, for example.

Laws
We must have some laws, like you must drive on the right side of the
road,
you may not steal other's property, you may not hurt anyone or
threaten
anyone. No laws against drug use, it is up to the individual.

Enterprise
Anybody can start a new company for production or other activities.
Apart from your own private resources you can ask for extra resources
from
the democratic institutions, like the town hall, the national
government, etc..
You can ask for help from other people to achieve more than you can
alone.
The company must be run democratically if more than one person is
involved.
And, of course, you cannot make any profit, there is no money system,
but
you can produce something you think is good for people.

Democracy
The society is run democratically, and the common resources are
ultimately
managed by the democratic institutions, which can delegate the running
of things
to single persons or companies, as suitable in each case.

Copyright
There are no laws about copyright and patents. Everything published is
the
property of all of us, it belongs to the human race. This means you
are free to
copy and distribute computer programs, music, movies, etc as you like.
The authors have no need for compensation as they are guaranteed
material equality as everybody else.

How-to implement this program
Start a new party in your country with this program.
When you have a majority you can implement it.
We have democracy already in most countries in the world,
so this can be done peacefully and legally.
Violence or illegal struggle for this program is useless, we need
the majority of the people behind this program before it can be
implemented.

Explanations
This program is intended to be a program for any and all countries,
and ideally for the whole world, in the post-capitalist era.
This program does not suffer from a lot of problems in the capitalist
system, like
problems with interest rates, inflation, wages, mortgages, insurance
companies, etc..

Discussions about this program are held in the newsgroup
alt.society.futures
available to everybody who has internet via google groups.

Program name
This program could be called anything but we recommend the name
Utopia,
because this program is in line with utopian thinkers through the

Actually, that would not be an option. It was not an option for Soviet

Cuba tried it, and everyone with talent left the country, leaving Cuba with a

Those you call "productive people" are probably the rich, investment

game.

They will be allowed to move to a deserted island with all their
dollar bills, if they like. It would be fun to watch how these
"productive people" would try to make others wash their clothes, and
make food for them, and build houses for them.
They will all be very rich, so they will all refuse to do any
practical work.

They will probably become so desperate that they try to eat dollar

Well, Roger, your "program" is self-contradictory. If everyone is "maximally
free," then they will not have equal property, simply because people are not
equally productive or equally ambitious. So to maintain equality you'll have
to take some property from the more productive and give it to the less
productive, by force. Then the more productive are no longer free.

At that point they will either leave your "program" (as did the productive
Cubans or East Germans) or just stop producing (as did the productive
Soviets). Then there will be very little food and clothes to distribute.

We're going to try to evaluate both of your claims, i.e., that your
system allows both "maximum possible liberty" and "maximum personal
property." We'll take up the "property" claim after we analyze the
"liberty" claim. OK?

You appear to be conceding that property will be taken from the more
productive by force. Is that correct?

You also seem to agree that to the extent a person is subject to force, he
is not free. Is that also correct?

Your argument then seems to be that some force is necessary in any system,
and that it is employed in "capitalism" also. Is that also correct?

You then argue that, while all systems require some force, your
egalitarian regime will require less force, or that force will be more
equally applied and will thus be less severe for any one person.

Thus your conclusion is that your system allows the "maximum possible
liberty," though not perfect liberty, to every person.

Do I have it right so far?

Let me hear your answers to those questions, and we can proceed from
there.

Yes, today millions and billions of people are not free to choose for

Capitalism creates a need for a very big police force and military
force which is needed to uphold the incredibly big in-equalities of

The capitalist system also creates a lot of anger and desperation for

In a better world, where everybody already have the same material

And many crimes which are common today will be impossible or
meaningless. If there are no banks and no money it is impossible to
rob a bank or to rob somebody walking down the street.

The most important issue to spread is the question;
How do you want the society to work?

When enough people have agreed on a vision of the future society we
can win the election and start realizing that vision.

The main hinder is that people are filled with anger, and want to get
an outlet for that anger. They want to find somebody to hate and
somebody to attack.

They do not realize that they are doing exactly what the enemy wants
them to do, go out on the streets and fight with the police.
That doesn't lead anywhere.

What we really should do is to create a vision, discuss and spread
that vision peacefully, so we can start political parties with that
vision as program, and vote for a better society.

Help people concentrate on the most important issue, how do you want
the society to work?

Do you want a lot of individual freedom?
Do you want material equality?
Do you want an open democratic system or do you want a few rich people
deciding the important issues about our world secretly?

Write down your own vision, and compare it with others, develop your
vision when you get new ideas or when people make you realize that
something in your vision is not such a good idea.

Have both an advanced vision and a program for today.

My advanced vision is a moneyless society where all work is voluntary
and everybody have the same amount of personal property. But today I
vote for the socialists in general elections in my country, because
they are closer to my future goals than the conservatives, the
religious rightwing parties.

When more people support the idea of a moneyless society and
individual freedom we can work together to make that vision known and
more accepted.

The socialists in my country want to abolish capitalism and the
kingdom, but they say that doing that today would not be good for the
swedish people.
We would be economically and politically isolated like Cuba.

The governments in many countries have a similar standpoint, Russia,
China, India, Canada, Latin America, Europe. As long as capitalism is
strong and the money system is backed up by USA and the strongest
military power in the world we need to continue with this compromise,
a little capitalism and a little socialism.

We are all waiting for the american people to become intelligent
enough to take control of their own government and military forces.

Well, you didn't *completely* answer the question. You say, "No," that
property will not be taken from the more productive by force. If not, then
you'll have to explain how the workers who pick fruit, etc., "will get more
property." (1) Where will they get it? (2) Where will it come from?

But since you say "No," property will not be taken by force, then may I

to read, and I offer copies of my novel to anyone who will pay me $20, then
I may keep anything paid to me? (3) Nothing will be taken from me by force?

You think stockholders, bankers, and owners of industry are unproductive?
(4) Where would the industry get the money to make its product, if not from
stockholders, bankers, and owners?

But let's consider the stockholder. A stockholder is a person who has
invested some money in a business enterprise. Why, under your system, would
their incomes be lower, unless property is taken from them by force? Or will
you just forbid them to invest in the enterprise of their choice in the
first place? (5) Isn't that also a violation of their liberty? How does that

Well, we need to clarify what is meant by "free" and "force." You seem to
agree that a person is not free if he is subject to force. But not being
free to choose when to work and what work to do does not mean a person is
subject to force. I may not be free to choose to work as a doctor, because I
don't have the proper training, but there is no force involved. I may not be
free to work as a novelist because no one wants to read my novels. But that
lack of freedom is not due to any force exerted upon me. I may wish to work
as a fruit picker and earn $100/hour, and discover that no one will pay me
$100/hour. But no one is forcing me. If I demand $100/hour they will just
not do business with me. (6) How am I forced? (7) Who is forcing me?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Your argument then seems to be that some force is necessary in any

Yes, free economies do allow great inequalities, and free societies do try
to protect each person in the enjoyment of his property, no matter how
unequal, as long as that property has not been acquired by force. They do
resort to force to resist force. That is, force may be deployed against
persons who have themselves used force, but not against anyone who has not.

Apparently in your system force is allowed to insure equality. That
contradicts your answer to the first question, above. (8) Can you explain
that contradiction?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Why would crimes becomes impossible? Suppose we have equal property, but I
want *more* than my "equal share" of certain property. (9) Why is it

"Perfect liberty" would be a system where no one ever initiates force. But
everyone may respond to force with force.

And of course in such a system no one would have a right to control other
people, i.e., to use force against them. But if I refuse to hire you to do
some work for me, or refuse to pay you more than your work is worth to me, I
have not applied any force to you. (10) Merely not doing business with you
is not forcing you, is it?

There are 10 questions numbered above. Can you answer those and clarify
these issues?

You cannot register more property than everybody else, so if you steal
a car you cannot become the legal owner of it. It will be reported as
stolen,  and you will get caught very quickly because the police will
find that car very quickly.

And why would you want to steal a car, when you can get one for free,
as long as your personal property does not amount to more than the
maximum limit, the same limit everybody else must respect.
As we produce more cars, houses, apartments and boats the maximum
level will be raised accordingly.
..........

If you own a lot of money you have a lot of power over other people.
All monetary power stems from power achieved through violence.

To give every individual a maximum of freedom we cannot allow some
people to take control of other people, or take control of the
production and transport system. So you cannot hire people or boss
people or push people around with the help of a money system or any
other means.

Workplaces are ruled democratically by those who volunteer to work
there.

OK. Let's assume there is no money. Instead of $20, I demand that those who

must read it on the premises (since there are no copyright laws I distribute
no copies). I supply a comfortable reading room with a complimentary glass of
ice tea. Suppose the same number of people wish to read my book (many
millions), and they are lined up at the job site to put in their hour. Do I
get to keep the house when it is finished? Or will it be taken from me by

No doubt they do. But why would they hand over their designs to your

Roger, I suggest you take a poll. Go to an auto factory, and during a shift
change, ask the workers leaving for the day whether they would come to work
there every day if they did not need the money and were not being paid ---
whether, if all of their "needs" were taken care of, they would work there
anyway, just because they liked the work. It might be an eye opener for

Well, you have to explain in what sense industry "controls" anyone, other
than those who have agreed to work for someone else, at their direction,
for 8 hours per day. You mean I can't agree to work for someone else, and
do what he asks of me, if I think it is in my interest to do so? You are
going to interfere in that agreement by force?

I should think the experience of the USSR would have taught you a lesson.
The Soviets were never able to produce enough cars, houses, food, or
anything else. The motto of the Soviet worker was, "They pretend to pay us,
and we pretend to work." As a result almost nothing was produced.
Housewives had to stand in line for hours when their local market finally
received a shipment of sugar, after being out for weeks. Auto assembly
lines shut down for days because the factory could not get a certain bolt.

As for your auto designers being willing to work for nothing, the USSR and
other socialist economies supply a lesson there too. Think about this:

*No socialist state has ever produced a product, of any kind, which was
marketable outside its own borders*. That is, that anyone would buy who had
a choice. There has never been a "brand name" good produced in any
socialist state --- no Sony, no CocaCola, no Volvo, no BMW, no Nikon, no
Microsoft Word, no Panasonic, no Boeing 747. Soviet-made cars, appliances,
food products, electronic products would be considered junk anywhere in the
West. That is what you get from designers in socialist states.

Please answer all the questions above regarding force, and explain why you
feel entitled to exercise force against persons who have not used force
against anyone else. And then explain how that reconciles with your claim
that your system guarantees "maximum liberty."

Roger,

You know I have one disagreement with you so I will not mention it.
But I will point out that you will never convince some people on this
particular point because they are ok with paradoxical thinking---you
would call it religious thinking I guess.

Now, you and I understand that people will do something because they
like doing it. But Publius will say that it is only for money that
they do things. Then, if you ask him if that is the case for him, he
will go on a long discourse full of self-contradiction and
equivocation in trying to dodge the question. This is exactly what we
see in religions, when they try to explain things that are irrational.

He will block out from his mind that *we are doing exactly what you,
Roger,  describe*!!  Because we have sufficient food and shelter and
security, we sit here and write and write even though we are not
getting paid, we have no copyright, and we will not publish and sell
our work.

So of course if your system were real, people would come and design
cars because otherwise they would be bored with just eating and
sleeping. And the additional reward they would get for their work,
beyond the pleasure of doing it,  would be that people pick their
designs, just as we are rewarded when people answer our posts.

Don't you know anything about the real world?

My father worked for a company called ASEA which developed industrial
robots a long time ago. Today they have merged with a swiss company
and they are called ASEA Brown Bovery (ABB), and they are making
millions of industrial robots every month. There are Japanese and
Korean companies who are also producing industrial robots.

In our swedish car industry cars are made to 97% by robots, and 3 %
manual work. They are in the process of automating the last 3% too,
and then we can produce cars 24 hours a day seven days a week using
practically no manual labor at all.

look up "industrial robots car industry" on google and read about how
all kinds of industry is becoming increasingly automated.

size of a person can easily carry a load over one hundred pounds and
move it very quickly with a repeatability of +/-0.006 inches.
Furthermore these robots can do that 24 hours a day for years on end
with no failures whatsoever. Though they are reprogrammable, in many
applications (particularly those in the auto industry) they are
programmed once and then repeat that exact same task for years.

Yes. And remember that the rich people today have used force to get

just used to the situation where the force is on their side.

That the force could be on the people's side, through democratic
decisions, is what is new for them. And they have sacrificed millions
of lives to stop democracy from taking over the power from the rich
and the church.

Look up the word Fascism in wikipedia and read about the pope who in
1891 wrote that the democracy and labor unions was a big threat, and
the pope suggested a new strategy to stop the class struggle, and read
about how this strategy developed into fascism.

Look up "hitler henry ford wall street" on the web and read about how
the rich in USA and Britain helped hitler to come to power. This is
also mentioned in the movie we talked about in the beginning of this

The rich and the church did everything they could to crush democracy,
labor unions and socialism. The first people who were sent to the

If the maximum limit is 10 000 PP a big house can be valued to 5000

PP.
A small apartment 500 PP, an old and used car 500 PP, etc..

Next year we have produced more houses and more cars so the maximum

You do not have to do anything to earn PP, these property points is
the constitutional right of every citizen. It gives us material

We might imagine that car designs become as ubiqiutous as public domain
software. Most of them would never be produced, because (unlike the software)
a design that appealed to 12 people would not justify tooling up the factory.
A few designs would indeed be "picked." Those designers would then tell the
factory committee, "If you want another design from me, it will cost you."
And if they declined to pay, someone else would.

Unless the upstart designer (having been tried and convicted of "thwarting

Yes, Roger, I'm aware of those. That was not the question. Modern auto
factories, and most other factories, are highly automated. Nonetheless, they
still require hundreds or thousands of human workers per plant. Auto
manufacturers in the US (including US, Japanese, Korean, and German-owned
factories) are as automated in any in the world, yet they still employ over
200,000 hourly workers. If you imagine all those people will show up for

Well, no, Roger. The engineer cannot show up whenever he likes. Nor can any
other worker. Each machine must have all of its operators in place to
operate. That means each worker must have a schedule and follow that
schedule. The plant will rarely be running if it relies on chance for its
staffing.

Nor is it sufficient merely for some engineer to be "present." Every
particular worker has information about his particular machine or his
particular job that others do not have. That is why new employees must be
trained. Workers cannot just "drop in," work for a few hours, and be
replaced the next day by someone else.

Have you ever worked in a factory, or at any kind of skilled trade, Roger?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Yes. Some might wish to amuse themselves that way for a few days. While they
were learning the ropes the factory would be down. They'd have fun getting
their machine running, but then they would get bored. Just like playing a
video game --- once you beat the game, you look for a new one. Then a new
dilettante arrives and the machine is down for another week. Since all these
machines --- of which there are thousands in the factory --- must all be
running at once, and optimally, the factory is down virtually all of the
time.

Many jobs have a "fun phase" --- the learning phase, where there is a
challenge of acquiring mastery. Once you'd acquired that mastery, the fun
turns into work. At that point the guy who now has mastery gets bored, and
looks for new challenges, unless he has another reason to stay. And the
factory goes down, because everyone who actually knows how to operate it is
seeking new amusements.

Most factories also use job rotation, so all workers learn all manual
jobs, to make it more interesting for the workers, and it makes it
easy to move workers to the station where they are needed.

A close relative is an engineer at the Volvo factory, and we have

I am also very well educated myself, especially in the field of
industrial electronics and automation.
I also have it in my family. My father was process electrician in the
most modern paper mill in the world in the 60ies, and later he kept a
sawmill working day and night. He could be called any time so he often
had to rush down to the factory in the middle of the night to find out
what the fault was and how to fix the problem.

When I visited him on his workplace he sat in a room full of relays
and watched all of them at once. Now and then he changed a relay or
changed some switches.
He ran the whole factory from that room.

Because modern farmers use machines which makes it easy to produce a

Because he realizes that other people have made the shoes and clothes

make his machines and his computer, other people teach his children in
schools, other people take care of him and his family if he becomes
ill. Then it is just natural that he helps others by producing food,
or transport food, or process food, or put it on the shelves in the
supermarket where everybody can go and take what they need.

A lot of people would like to live in the country with their children,
and in this system they can do so, without all the worries and hard
work many farmers today are suffering from. If 4 families live on a
farm and help running it they can afford to take a vacation now and
then, and they have no economic issues to handle. That will be very
easy work compared to what farmers have to put up with under
capitalism today.

The society works if at least some of us participate and produce what
we think is needed.

If some people do things we do not think is productive we should not
judge them or force them, they probably have good reasons to  do what
they are doing.

Think about Jimi Hendrix. Who could have guessed that he would produce
something which still makes people happy, 30 years after his death?

If somebody just stays in bed all day for weeks he probably need it,
it is not up to us to judge other people's behavior.

Yup. And if he did not show up that factory was down. BTW, you might ask him

hundreds of vessels and valves for controlling temperatures and flows.

All those relays and switches your father monitored represented devices,
machines, and processes going on in those devices. He didn't become
proficient at it by showing up one or twice a month, "for the fun of it."

No comment on the "maximum personal liberty," then? I take it you withdraw

You can believe what you want, but Volvo is the only car factory in
this country, so we know very much about it, and they use job-
rotation. In addition to the reasons I have already given they also
say that it keeps the workers healthier, because doing the same
movements all the time wears out the body faster than if the workers
do different jobs on a rotation basis.

Note that we are talking about two very different types of jobs in a
car factory.
The engineers, who program the robots and control the whole process,
and the workers who mount details which have not yet become robotized.

These workers are the ones who are on job rotation.

The engineers are like my father, they have the overall
responsibility and they have interesting jobs.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There aren't any machines of that type in a modern car factory. The
workers are mounting cables and car seats, and they don't need any
machines for that, only a pneumatic screwdriver, typically. There are
no machines which need 3 workers to control them.

The first part of building a car is done by robots. The robots weld,
galvanize and paint the chassi and mount the front and back windows.

Manual work is only used at the end of the production, mounting seats
and doors for example. But they are working on automation of the whole
process.
Fewer and fewer manual workers are needed.

It takes many years of training to become a good doctor, or process-

interested in such fields and they become very good at it.

I have studied a lot about electronics and process-control myself,
just because I liked the field. But I have had a more important task
in my life, solving an old problem with social traditions, a cultural
pattern which has caused a lot of violence, slavery, social and
economic inequality, wars, torture, bullying, child abuse, serial
killers, alcoholics, fanaticism, terrorism, etc..

My political program is the solution for all these problems, because
it gives the individual freedom, and this old cultural pattern cannot
exist if people are free.

The money system is one of the main tools these traditionalists are
using to control people and force them to become violent and
supernaturally strong in social life.

It is a cultural pattern which is based on creation.
They create men out of boys, they create ego-based and strong willed
women out of little girls. They create the eternal love and the holy
matrimony.
They create a dualistic society, divided into heaven and hell, bullies
and the victims of bullies, masters and slaves, superhumans and common
people, gods and mere mortals.

here is one model i consider likely:
-+-

we all have many drives

these exist as things that are tied to observation

we can map neural activity
through mRNA expression
we can trace isotopic glucose consumption
with NMR (MRI !)
we can measure current in muscular twitch

this system of drives
has a complicated and still somewhat poorly misunderstood
negotiation process
to manage control over which action schemas we take

many have drives to stay alive
whether an innate primal calculation
going all the way back to our
sessile arm-feeding cilliary filter-feeding chordatic beginnings
or more well-elaborated hungers
like the beauty in our experience

health and fitness measure the ability to stay alive
using predictions based upon best models and other learning algorithms

so for symbologically-influenced drives to live
( those affected by exchanges of language )
health metrics are an important tool

however
if someone does not possess such a drive
which i understand can happen
when the weight of one's suffering becomes high
and when the elaborate is meaningless

i would not presume to make such an important decision for them

##$$**&amp;&amp;

i am not proposing that one must desire life

if one does have such a drive
health metrics are our scientific foundation for prediction

all of our actions should be informed by health

every moment we are alive
we can do what our desires negotiate
or at least we can try

if you cherish your moments
health can maximise this ability

..

this plays an even more important role in agreements

health metrics can be defined over agreements
which measure forms of "collective" health

this is part of a large mereological chain of subcollections
of physical systems which admit metrics of health

including the cellular level
with its differentiations and structural systematics

up to the entire planet and beyond

we are all a part of this process of life

agreements
collaborations
colonialisation
industrialisation

all processes of some physical collection
with their own health metrics

choosing to enter into
only those agreements that are healthy in appropriate metrics
is a good prescription for mutualist benefit

that is all

i have strong suspicions this simple prescription
gives a more elegant explanation of
"natural" forms of collective governance
than rights based explanations
and still gives many classically well-observed relationships
found in formal political science and economics

The most famous christian pastor in my country was interviewed on tv
last night.
The reporter asked him if he still encouraged parents to beat
children.
He first denied that he ever had said that, but the reported played
two recordings in which he clearly encouraged parents to beat their
children.

Obviously he follows the old saying "spare the rod and you will spoil
the child".

A few weeks ago, in a discussion about child care on tv a woman said:
"I think we must give children a trauma, to make them strong enough
for life."

If she had encouraged people to mistreat jews or homosexuals so they
will suffer from a lifelong trauma she would have been arrested,  but
children do not have the protection which other groups of people have,
obviously.

People who had left the chistian church said that they did not like to
become very hard and tough people, so they left the church of that
famous christian pastor.

When I was younger I thought that christian people were very soft and
nice people. But since then I have been in close contact with
christian people, and now I know that they are very tough people.

They are creating a very tough social environment so people are forced
to become members of the christian community or live a very hard life
outside that community. That is the reason why serial killers exist,
why people become criminals or alcoholics, why people use drugs or
sleeping pills, why there is so much violence, in the society and in
media.

They want to create super-humans, who rule the social life with mental
and physical power, and economic power too. They have invented
property rights and the money system to control other people, so they
can force them to become members of the christian community or die.

I'm jumping in again because this is one of my favorite fundatarian
paradoxes. When I argue that we would be better off with fewer people,
these Religio-Capitalist types always say that then we will only have
stone tools. But they obviously don't understand their own economic
theories; of course if people are not available to do jobs we will
automate them.

Also, we will build better cars that will last longer---consider how
50 years ago US cars would rust out in 3 years and now we are used to
cars that last 150-200 thousand miles, with far longer intervals
between regular service like oil changes and tuneups. If we build pure
electric and series-hybrid cars, they can last at least 50 years---if
people want to change the style, they can have kits to build a new
shell to fit on the functional frame.

These people are so attached to the authoritarian paradigm that they
can't see the real world at all---they talk about freedom and
flexibility in the free market, but are terrified if you show how it
can actually work.

Well, that is delightfully obscure. I'm sure it's true that they are "tied"
to observation in some sense, but the details of the "tie" need to be
spelled out.

I think it's safe to say that a drive which cannot be coupled to an action
schema would be redundant (and probably undetectable), and that action
schemas depend upon information re: the state of the environment, i.e.,
observation. But drives do not necessarily *originate* in observation. Some
may, but some may not.

BTW, I like the term "values" better than "drives." They are the same,
behaviorally speaking, but the two terms have somewhat different
implications, and the former is more at home in moral philosophy.

Agree. Drives (values) form a dynamic hierarchy. When one is (temporarily)
satisifed, it moves down the hierarchy, others move up. Each drive (value)
has a satisfaction cycle with its own clock. So drives are constantly
rearranging themselves in the hierarchy, depending upon their satisfaction
state and their individual clock rates.

And your "negotiation" is a good word. The system constantly scans the
environment for *opportunities* to satisfy all the drives in the hierarchy.
When an opportunity is discerned the system calculates the *opportunity
cost* to satisfy that drive at that time. It does not necessarily act on the
drive currently uppermost in the hierarchy; it acts on the uppermost drive
which is currently actionable, and whose opportunity cost does not exceed
the current rank of that drive in the hierarchy. It has to solve a set of
simultaneous equations.

Hm. Are you suggesting that seeking beauty, like seeking food, are primal
drives? That both are to be subsumed under the drive for self-preservation?

I think those are quite different. Some drives indeed appear to be innate (a
claim based entirely on empirical grounds). For humans, however, most appear
to be acquired. The latter category includes both the drive for beauty and
the drive for self-preservation. But I don't think the latter two have any
other relationship (though they may co-vary for a given person).

Yes. If self-preservation is a value in the hierarchy, then the system will
learn what means serve that end, calculate the relative costs of those
means, and adopt the means with the lowest costs. Which means are chosen
depends on the outcome of those calculations and the current rank of that

It is not usually a matter of possessing or not possessing that drive. Only
a few people do not possess that drive at all. But its rank in the hierarchy
varies considerably, especially between persons, but even for a given person

In an earlier post (can't recall to whom) I outlined the difference between
"personal morality" and "public morality." Personal morality involves the
rational scrutiny of ones own values, with a view toward understanding their
relationships --- especially dependencies and conflicts among them. It may
lead to "harmonizing" one's values, i.e., recognizing their "base rank"
(eigenstate?) in the hierarchy, removing or reconciling conflicts, and
ordering dependencies. This is the stuff that fills the self-help shelves in
bookstores.

Public morality, on the other hand, is a much different undertaking. It is
the search for *rules for interactions* among agents within a "moral
field" --- a setting where interactions among them may occur. It posits a
number of agents, each of whom has a value hierarchy of the sort described
above. It's aim is to find that set of rules which allow all agents to
maximize satisfaction of the drives in their own hierarchies, whatever those
may be. The rules are chosen to maximize synergistic interactions and
minimize destructive ones.

Unlike personal moralities, however, it makes no inquiries into the contents
of any of those value hierarchies, *except* to determine whether any of them
contain drives (values) not compatible, *prima facie*, with the "fundamental
principle" of public morality, namely, concurrent maximization of all
agents' drives.

So I think your advice above is sound for private moralities, but not
relevant for public ones.

Health metrics can be *defined* over a collection of marbles in a bag. But
any definition over a collection of humans will be meaningful (and relevant)
only if it is defined in terms of the various metrics adopted by each member
of the collection. Any global metric not derived from those individual
metrics will be arbitrary and irrelevant to any individual agent.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; this is part of a large mereological chain of subcollections

">

There are different types of collections, or systems, namely organisms and
adaptive systems. Organisms have critical interdependencies; adaptive
systems don't. As a result a health metric for an organism applies to all
cells. For an adaptive system, on the other hand, each agent has only its
own metric, and any relevant global metric will have to be some derivative
of those.

BTW, there is reason to think no global metric (of the right kind) is
possible. E.g., Arrow's Theorem.

">

The heart of rights-based moralities is the rigid insistence on the
plurality of agents and the distinctness and independence of their value
hierarchies. Theories which propose a common hierarchy or global values
ignore the empirical situation.

The reader is probably wondering what you talking about.
I feel compelled to help the readers to understand that "Publius" is
an academic thinker and he escapes into the academic ivory tower
whenever he needs to hide behind a lot of technical terms.

This is an example of the kind of academic gibberish some people think
is valuble. I leave it to the reader to judge for himself what kind of
crap this is.

"     Arrow's Theorem and Buridan's Ass.

Arrow's theorem: Suppose we have a voting system to rank 3 or more
voting options. Suppose that system respects unanimity and the
independence of independent alternatives. Then there must be a
dictator for the voting system.

A dictator means here that in spite of having a large number of voters
ranking the alternatives, there is just one whose ranking matches the
final ranking implemented, using any fair (according to the hypotheses
of the theorem) voting system whatsoever. see Nielsen's post for the
reasons we conclude this.

And it occurred to me that this can account for the supposed paradox
of Buridan's Ass. You recall that this says that an ass equidistant
from two bales of hay will starve to death because (Being a robotic
zombie in Jean Buridan's philosophy) it has no sufficient reason to
prefer going to one rather than the other.

But the ass actually has three choices; it can go to bale A, or to
bale B, or it can ignore both bales. Suppose now that the ass's
robotic brane is built on the basis of Dennet's Conscieusness
Explained (surely even dualists will grant me this in the case of a
zombie). This theory features competing agents each with an agenda to
sell to their collectivity - in other words a voting scheme, and in
this case each agenda is a preference ranking of the three choices,
and Arrow's theorem should apply. So not alll agents are equal and
one, just one, of them determines the action of the collectivity in
spite of their independence. So there is no effective vote, but rather
a single dictatorial agenda - whatever it is - is implemented. The ass
survives."

What can we say about this?

People who cannot speak in clear language cannot think clearly.

The overcomplicated mind easily fools itself.

There is no real Nobel prize in economics, and it is not given by the
Nobel prize committee.

The prize in economics is awarded by the money masters who rule this
world, and they have so much power that they can invent an award, a so
called "Nobel prize" in economics, which is not a proper Nobel prize.

Game theory in a game like Monopoly is only interesting for the people
who like to play the monetary game for maximum profit, and they don't
give a damn about the real people they use and abuse in the process.

So after a long discussion which started with a very revealing movie
about the money masters we are back to the subject we started with.

See the movie, and throw out these parasites who play a game with
people and their lives. It is time for a new system, built by the
people for the people, and we have no need for game theory in the
field of economics.

People should not be treated like pawns in a chess game.

http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/nobel.htm

"In 1896, Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of
dynamite, bequeathed his fortune to a foundation to create an annual
prize for person "who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred
the greatest benefit on mankind."   Nobel's will specified prizes in
physics, chemistry, physiology/medicine, literature and peace.  These
were first awarded in 1901.

In 1969, the Swedish central bank (Sveriges Riskbank) established a
prize known as the "Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in
Memory of Alfred Nobel", which is commonly shortened to the Nobel
Memorial Prize.   The Nobel Memorial Prize has a similar procedure of
award selection (by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) as the
original Nobel prizes.  It also disburses the same monetary amounts
and shares in the formal ceremony.

The Nobel Memorial Prize has been quite controversial since its
inception and numerous objections have been raised against it.  The
first objection is that economics is either not "scientific" enough or
does not contribute to "human advancement" enough to merit the
prestige of an award with the Nobel name.  The sentiment, often echoed
in wider intellectual circles and the popular press, is shared by many
economists themselves.  Indeed, Gunnar Myrdal, after having helped the
Riksbank set it up in 1968 and receiving the award himself in 1974,
eventually came to publicly admit this.

The second objection, is that the Bank of Sweden's decision to use the
prestigious "Nobel" name has thrust economics into a kind of medal
race, pitting nations, universities and individual economists against
each other.  All this leads to a lot of unnecessary acrimony that
distracts and disrupts serious economics research."

"A corollary to this is that the Bank of Sweden is occasionally
criticized is for failing to choose the most popular candidates.  Some
of the choices it made have been openly criticized by professional
economists.  There are a number of perennial candidates so universally
liked and recommended, always leading straw polls year after year,
whom nonetheless received no award.  So, even if one disagrees
violently with its choices or gets frustrated by the fact that one's
favorite candidate keeps missing out, perhaps one ought to continue to
admire the Bank of Sweden's bravery.

However, it is precisely because of the erratic and disproportionate
"impact" the Bank of Sweden's choice has upon the profession and the
shape of subsequent economics research that many  have called for an
end to the Nobel Memorial Prize. "

In the week before this year's Nobel laureates are annonunced, the
great great nephew of Alfred Nobel has reiterated his criticism of the
Nobel Economics Prize, which he says is "a PR coup by economists to
improve their reputation".

A fierce advocate of refugees' rights, Peter Nobel, 73, says he has
always wanted to help people, in much the same way his great great
uncle Alfred Nobel, who died more than a hundred years ago..

Nobel despised people who cared more about profits than society's well-
being, Peter says, reiterating his vehement criticism of the Nobel
Economics Prize which he says Alfred Nobel would never have created.

Unlike the Nobel Prizes for Medicine, Chemistry, Physics, Literature
and Peace, which were created by Nobel in his 1896 will and first
awarded in 1901, the Economics Prize was conceived by Sweden's central
bank in 1968 to mark its tricentenary and first awarded a year later.

"There is nothing to indicate that he would have wanted such a prize."

The Economics Prize has over the years been criticized as not being a
"real" Nobel, and a newspaper article Peter Nobel wrote in 2001
refuelled the debate.

"It's most often awarded to stock market speculators", which does not
reflect Alfred Nobel's spirit of improving the human condition, he
fumes.

"The Economics Prize has nestled itself in and is awarded as if it
were a Nobel Prize. But it's a PR coup by economists to improve their
reputation," he bristles."

Heh. Of course. Economics is closely related to politics. So everyone who
espouses unscientific economic theories in order to bolster their political
fantasies will object to scientific economics, and therefore to the prize.

If there were a prize for biological sciences all the fundamentalists would
be objecting to it, for the same reason.

"The vast majority of economic prizes have gone to people who reflect
the dominating western view of the world. It's doubtful whether this
really is of benefit to all mankind," says Peter Nobel.
The economics prize has long been controversial, not least because the
theories of many prize-winners have been found wanting in practice. In
1997, Robert Merton and Myron Scholes were feted for their work on
options pricing. A year later, Long Term Capital Management, the US
hedge fund where they were partners, crashed. The Riksbank has taken
the latest criticism in its stride. Robert Sparve, the bank's general
counsel, insists: "The economics prize is not a Nobel prize.
It's not mentioned in the will." But he accepts that it is awarded in
"memory of Alfred Nobel".
Asked if the Riksbank would be happy to clear up the ambiguity and
drop the Nobel name, Mr Sparve said: "No, we see no reason to change
it." Peter Nobel and his cousins have no direct involvement in the
Nobel Foundation, which administers the prizes and runs the finances.
Do they think their campaign can succeed? "This is a long-term battle.
If we keep up the criticism, they may be more careful about who they
choose for their awards," says Mr Nobel.
The attack may discomfort the prize ceremony organisers. Some 225
former laureates are about to descend on Stockholm and Oslo for
celebrations to mark the centenary which climax on December 10, the
anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death, when this year's prizes - worth
SKr10m ($940,000) per discipline - are awarded. True to form, the
winners of this year's economics prize - George Akerlof, Michael
Spence and Joseph Stiglitz - are all from the US."

"No one has actually won a Nobel Prize in economics since there are
none! The prize is "The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences
in Memory of Alfred Nobel" and is not part of the official prizes
awarded every year since 1901 for achievements in physics, chemistry,
physiology or medicine, literature and for peace."

Hazel Henderson, 2004

"The widely-touted, so-called "Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics"
isn't a proper Nobel Prize at all. For many years, I and others have
sought to correct this widespread error by reminding people of its
actual name: The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Science in Memory of
Alfred Nobel. The Bank set up this $1 million prize in 1969, as I have
held, in order to legitimize the economics profession as a science."

Heh. That's what I said, i.e., that the critics complain about the prize for
political reasons.

You may have noticed that the majority of prizes in physics, chemistry, *et
al* have also gone to scientists who "reflect the dominating Western view" in
those fields. Peddlers of crackpot theories don't get them. Neither do
peddlers of crackpot economic theories, such as Marxism.

Fortunately, the economic prize is not awarded based on Mr. Nobel's misguided
political views, or his uninformed notions of what is "really of benefit to
all mankind." He is not qualified to judge what is "of benefit to all
mankind." It is awarded based on the soundness of the reasoning and
empirically verifiable results.

As I said, Roger, if you wish to be rid of Arrow's Theorem you'll have to
disprove it. *Ad hominems* work in politics, but they don't count in
economics.

You talk about the monetary system, a game which the money masters are

Well, no Roger. You have already admitted that in the dystopia you envision
