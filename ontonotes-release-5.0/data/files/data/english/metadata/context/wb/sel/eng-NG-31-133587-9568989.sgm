the  scariest words your gonna hear.......&quot;We are the government and we

As traders and investors, the government(s) are actually our  friend(s).

You know that whenever they do something, there is an economic  reaction.
The &quot;trick&quot; is to know when to profit from it ...

So, rather than complain or blame the government for what it's doing, we
should be smart enough to be able to profit from their &quot;helping&quot;, right?

By suggesting a &quot;economic stimulus&quot; they are really saying &quot;we are playing
politics&quot; because this is a Presidential election year. .
Conditions may or may not be really that bad ... or are  they?

Whatever happens, don't expect a &quot;V&quot; bottom like we've had ... instead, I
would guess that there will be one or more short term &quot;tradeable&quot; (whipsaw)
rallys, capitulation, then the &quot;sustainable&quot; rally. This may take  months.
That's when the real money is made!

yes... as traders we have to saddle up right next to them.

I see in the last while the Fed has been active...... but a meagre $3.5
b once in awhile is not going to start a rally..... right now they are
doing housekeeping.  In fact I kind of read this as this down move is
being supported by the Fed.   When they kick in $ 15-30 b in whatever
form.... that will give us a better signal.

I worked with a guy who invested in Real Estate who used events....
something like those California fires ..... just go down there and buy
some property.... keep it till values came up and sold.   Used the
Government as an indicator as to how bad it was.... the more serious
..the more he was interested.  Mind you he didn't steal the real
estate....he bought cheaply at the market price.

Danny.... here is the extreme........ this is on Allan
Greenspan..........friends in high places

Five Simple Steps to Becoming a Billionaire: The Greenspan Method
&lt; http://longorshortcapital.com/five-simple-steps-to-becoming-a-billion... &gt;

by Johnny Debacle

1. Become Fed Chairman
2. Lower interest rates until you create an asset bubble. Hold them
low until stagflation is in the air and a real estate bubble is
floating
3. Stop being Fed Chairman and release a book on how you didn’t do
anything wrong and have no regrets. If possible, time it perfectly
with the worst real estate market in generations
4. Join the hedge fund
&lt; http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120036783112890507.html?mod=hpp_us_wh... &gt;
which has profited more in % and dollar terms than anyone else has
from your mess (which you didn’t create)
5. Build a platinum statue of your muse, Ayn Rand, and sleep with it
every night

It also helps if you are mostly unethical.

*Addendum:* Look at this quote from Greenspan from the WSJ’s Real Time
Economics
&lt; http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/01/15/greenspan-subprime-sales-ma... &gt;:

“Q: All three of your clients — Pimco, Deutsche Bank and now Paulson
— were bearish early on housing and mortgages. Is there a connection?
A: I hadn’t [noticed] until you just raised the issue.”
