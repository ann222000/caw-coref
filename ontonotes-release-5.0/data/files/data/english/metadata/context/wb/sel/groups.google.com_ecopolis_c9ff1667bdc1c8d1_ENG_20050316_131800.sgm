State aid: Commission endorses €18.5 million of aid to reduce mercury
emissions in Italy
The European Commission has authorised, under EU state aid rules,
subsidies to two chlorine producers in Italy to set up new plants
allowing for mercury-free chlorine production. Solvay Rosignano is due
to receive €13.5 million aid to promote a €48 million investment,
and Altair Chimica is due to receive about €5 million for a planned
€13.5 million investment. The companies will end production based on
mercury technology and introduce so-called membrane technology for
which no mercury is needed. The Commission concluded that the aid was
not likely to cause undue distortion of competition within the Single
Market and was therefore compatible with EC Treaty state aid rules
(Article 87).

Commissioner Kroes explained: &quot;These measures support the
sustainability goal of the Lisbon strategy by avoiding future
environmental costs, and are fully in line with the proposed Community
strategy to reduce mercury pollution of January 2005. Environmental aid
has an important role in encouraging companies to behave in a more
environmentally-friendly way&quot;.

The €13.5 million aid for Solvay Rosignano, to promote a €48
million investment, and about €5 million for Altair Chimica, which
plans a €13.5 million investment, represent 30 % of the eligible
investment cost, plus an additional 10% of the eligible cost in the
case of Altair as it is a medium-sized enterprise.

The beneficiaries will set up new plants not exceeding their respective
current capacities and clean up the old installations. As a result, no
mercury will be emitted into the air or water as from 2007. The
de-commissioning of the old plants will eliminate the risk of mercury
leaking from the old installations, which contain a total of 270 tons
of mercury for both companies. The new technology will also lead to
other environmental benefits, such as substantial energy savings.

The approval was made subject to a commitment by the Italian
authorities to carefully monitor the de-commissioning of the old plants
and to report to the Commission regularly. If the cleaning up is not
performed in full compliance with the environmental rules, Italy might
be requested to recover the aid.
