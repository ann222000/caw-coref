Birds of a Feather: The Budgies by any other name?

Hi all:
I have posted on this group in the past; but I consider myself a
novice. One will see this when they read my questions:
When I initially purchased my budgie, which, according to the
proprietor, was called a 'rare parakeet,' although I couldn't
understand the reason for this title, as it was not only the most
common there, but also the least expensive. In any event, the
salesperson informed me that it would be best to have it wings
clipped; well, I did and now I seem to regret doing so. The only
reason for this is that I purchased another one (to facilitate a
friendship) and totally forgot all about the wing-clipping and he
didn't mention it.

Now that I have one with its wing's clipped and one without, am I
misinformed to think that these feathers grow back to their original
configuration, enabling the first bird to, once again, fly? It is able
to make the 'swoop' down to the floor, but once there, it does not
have the ability to fly up more than a few inches from the floor.
Seeing this, it seems sad to me in a way; it's almost as if I allowed
someone to remove a part of the bird that makes the bird, well, a
bird.

The other parakeet, the one without its wings clipped, is able to do
things the first one cannot. I can only assume that each bird is but
aware of each of its own limitations, and this only makes the
situation worse, from my standpoint.

I am disabled myself; I suffer from a great deal of back pain and I
cannot ambulate without some sort of assistive device, at least not in
any distance. I live alone; I live in a RV; and the birds actually
love their existence, I think. When I consider my own limitations, I
cannot but think of my bird's own limitations with respect to its
ability to fly. And this is why I ask the question.

Behavior of the birds is actually quite amazing. There are times when
one of them seems to &quot;bark&quot; with a loud and distinctive voice, and
then I think that there is trouble between the two, because I think
that one is trying to use his begotton role as the dominant bird. But,
when I look at them, there is no fighting; only a passive
communication amongst the birds, one that I am not sure with respect
to its meaning. Is this a sign of being angry? When I make the
reference to a &quot;bark,&quot; I am being a little over-dramatic. It's more
like a high-pitched sing-song of sorts, but, in of itself, yet,
peculiar. I have read at least four different books about these lovely
creatures, but I have found no reference to this.

But, I regress. My main point in posting this message is the reference
to the feathers. Is this a permanent 'fixture,' one that will be lost
forever; or can I assume that feathers will, in time, grow out in
their place to accomodate flight?

Thanks for the time,

Mark

They will regrow.  If they were mine, I'd trim the other one's wings as
well.  There are many here who may feel differently.

My reasons are:

1.  To equalize the two so they are at the same dis/advantage.
2.  To limit their range so you have more control over their perching.  They
really need to be on their cage or a play stand while out of their cage; not
on a drapery rod, etc.  Birds can get into big trouble when there are no
limitations and you said you have difficulties which sounds like retrieving
them from various high perches may be difficult to impossible for you.
3.  Unless they are confined to a room without exterior doors, there is a
risk of losing a flighted bird to the outside accidentally.

After their wings regrow, which will occur a few at a time twice a year,
they may be ready to be flighted in their new home with their newly acquired
manners.

Joanne

The feathers will grow back fully in under a year.   That relatively
short period of being  clipping after a bird has learned to fly won't
have much effect on it's flying skills after the feathers grow back.
The question is whether the bird learned flight skills when it was
young.  If not it may never learn to fly, at least not well.

In my opinion the best way to help your clipped bird return to normal
is to make the house safe for the bird  and let it try to fly
frequently.  It needs to exercise it's wings.

I agree wholeheartedly, Joanne.  Considering the physical disabilities
of the OP (Mea505), I think having clipped birds is a good idea.

Mea505, you empathize with your birds because their mobility is also
limited without wings. But when you come right down to it, they don't
HAVE to fly.  They can be happy on a playstand, in their cage, on a
table.  They can also be safe in that condition.  You, on the other
hand, pretty much need to be able to walk and get around and get out
of the RV in order to have a healthy, normal life.   If you have a
free flying bird, and it takes you awhile to get out the door of your
RV because of your limitations, how do you keep that bird from
accidentally flying out the open door?  It can happen more quickly
than you can imagine.  I'm a home health nurse, so I understand where
you're coming from.  You're not a 'bad birdie dad' if you keep your
birds lightly clipped.

As for the &quot;bark&quot;, it's a means of communication, usually warning
about something that is &quot;out of the ordinary&quot;.  One of them may have
noticed a different sound, or saw something outside the window that
startled him/her.  One of my budgies goes through that &quot;bark&quot; each
evening when she thinks the other budgies should be flying to their
perspective cages and turning in for the night.  Budgies also squabble
over all kinds of little things.  That doesn't mean they're fighting.
As long as the cage is large enough and there are enough perches so
they can get away from each other when needed, they should be fine.

Just out of curiosity, does anyone have any thoughts (or links to online
guides) on the relative merits of different clipping styles?

When we got our cockatiel, she was clipped by the pet store in
asymmetric configuration (all feathers on one wing clipped, half of the
tail on the same side clipped).  I didn't feel this worked well for our
bird, because she would try to fly, and just plummet to the floor.  She
ended up breaking the flesh on her breastbone twice because of this.  It
was a superficial wound, and one easily remedied without expense, but
it's still something i'd rather avoid.

When i explained this to the pet store owner (who is a bird lover and an
experienced bird keeper), he said they do it because statistically,
birds are less likely to get injured and lost that way.  He said that
since it didn't work for our bird, we should let her two flying feathers
grow and clip all the other wing feathers.  I've done this for the past
few months, and it's not really working either, for two reasons:

1.  She can fly a little too well, and gets herself stuck in bad places,
like behind furniture, with no floor-level exits.

2.  The absence of minor feathers seems to expose the flying feathers,
making them more susceptible to damage.  While clipped like this, she's
lost at least two flying feathers before they developed fully, usually
with accompanying bleeding.

So i'm wondering what other techniques there are, or whether there are
ways to mitigate the negative aspects of the two clipping techniques
we've tried.  One i've seen used on a cockatiel is to clip *only* the
two flying feathers (on both sides) and not anything else.  Would that
be more appropriate for our bird?  She's mostly out of the cage (mostly
she prefers sitting on the top) in a living/dining room with plenty of
exterior door access.

Thanks,
Paul

Only clip the primary flight feathers.  Never clip asymmetrically.  Never
clip any other feathers such as tail, secondary flight or coverlets.  Do not
leave the first couple of feathers long for aesthetics.  They will have no
support from the trimmed ones and may break.

The goal is to have your bird balanced and able to glide to the floor
gracefully but not get lift.  If the feathers are trimmed too short, the
bird will fly like a rock.  He may never attempt to fly again.

Begin by taking less length than you think you need to.  Follow the natural
curve of the coverlet feathers.  Test to see if the bird can fly up.  If so,
remove another small amount.  You can continue to trim but too much removed
can't be put back.

Feathers eventually fall out and are replaced.  They do not continue to grow
length unless they are not fully grown when trimmed.

The lighter the bird (budgies, small conures) the more length will need to
be trimmed.  Heavier birds may do well with a small amount of trim.

I strongly recommend that someone who knows what they are doing show you how
to trim.  Holding the bird and being careful not to trim unwanted parts like
toes, etc. is important to learn correctly.  We no longer trim but when we
did it ourselves, it took two of us to do it well.  Even the professional
groomer always brought an assistant.  I would suggest a professional avian
groomer or an avian vet.  As you have learned, pet stores may not be the
best place for truly educated information.
