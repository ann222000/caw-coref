The title says it all, really. I had initially interpreted the
antisymmetry in the connection coefficients to imply that the metric
is /not/ symmetric. However, I realized that all the antisymmetry
could be effectively stuffed into the co-torsion tensor [the part of
the connection which related to torsion] which would allow the metric
to remain symmetric but allow the requisite parts to remain a/anti-
symmetric.

I'm trying to learn the Einstein-Cartan theory of gravitation because
I have found the idea that GR /can't/ handle spin-orbit coupling to be
rather interesting. However, the resources I have found are good for
explaining the big and small picture, but leave out some important
details. Like if the metric remains symmetric...

My instinct is that it must remain symmetric because if I zero out the
spin tensor, the co-torsion tensor goes away and I am left with
classical GR. This is all motivated by trying to obtain a spherically
symmetric vacuum solution, which left me thinking about what kind of
metric anzatz I am allowed to use...

It is ONLY a definition that usually the Christoffel symbols of the
second
kind (your mentioned connection coefficients) are symmetric in the
Gauss
equations. If you use the torsion tensor which defined as

T_kl^p = C_kl^p - C_lk^p, (C_kl^p = Christoffel symbols of second
kind),

you get something more general that the Gauss equations and the
Weingarten equations and the compatibility equations
which all are basics in the theory of surfaces in R^3 (these
are generalized to manifolds (= &quot;many fold surfaces&quot;) in R^n).
In usual surfaces this generalization is not needed due torsion
tensor is thenm zero.

If you have paid more attention to the derivation of the Riemann
curvature tensor, there are at least two ways to gather all the terms
together.  One was discovered by Ricci in which it is the following.

R^n_ikj = @Y^n_ij/@q^k - @Y^n_ik/@q^j + Y^n_kl Y^l_jk - Y^n_jl Y^l_ik

Where

**  Y = Christoffel symbols of the 2nd kind
**  g = The metric
**  q = Choice of coordinate system

However, there is another rearrangement of coefficients that would
yield the following equally valid but never discovered by Ricci or
anyone else besides yours truly.

R^n_ikj = @Y^n_ij/@q^ - @Y^n_ik/@q^j + Y^n_jl Y^l_ik - Y^n_jl Y^l_ik

Perhaps, this will indulge yourself in the mathematical nonsense of GR
foliaging into other Neo-GR hypotheses such as the Einstein-Cartan
theory of gravity as you are so taunted by.  Or perhaps, you can go
back further in the development of GR by looking at other
presentations of the same geodesic equations.  The physicists only
know of one version that was the one ever so symmetrically presented
by Christoffel below.

Y^n_ij = g^nk (@g_ik/@q^j + @g_jk/@q^i - @g_ij/@q^k) / 2

Writing out the entire geodesic equation presenting in two different
formats, we have the following.

d^2q^n/ds^2 = - g^nk (@g_ik/@q^j + @g_jk/@q^i - @g_ij/@q^k) @q^i/@s
@q^j/@s / 2 = - g^nk (@g_ik/@q^j - @g_ij/@q^k / 2) @q^i/@s @q^j/@s

If Ricci were to handcraft his covariant derivative based on the
following less symmetrical connection coefficients instead of the good
old very symmetrical Christoffel symbols of the 2nd kind, you will get
a very different Riemann curvature tensor.

Z^n_ij = g^nk @g_ik/@q^j - @g_ij/@q^k / 2

Perhaps, the resulted less symmetric Ricci curvature tensor will bring
you closer to a closure from the Holy Grail of Einstein-Cartan theory
of gravity.  &lt;shrug&gt;

The 3 axioms are:
(1) There's a metric, as usual, with the signature (+,+,+,-) or (-,-,-,
+), depending on whose convention you use.
(2) There's a connection, not necessarily the Levi-Civita connection
associated with the metric.
(3) The covariant derivative of the metric with respect to the
connection is, however, still 0.

On account of (1), one can define orthonormal tetrads with the given
signature.
With respect to such a basis (e_a) the metric is just g_{ab} = g(e_a,
e_b) = eta_{ab}, the Minkowski metric. With respect to the dual basis
(e^a) the dual metric is g^{ab} = g^{-1}(e^a, e^b) = eta^{ab}, the
dual Minkowski metric.

On account of (3), the connection 1-form Gamma^a_b = (Gamma^a_{cb}
e^c) can be written as Gamma_{ab} = eta_{ac} Gamma^c_b, and is anti-
symmetric:
Gamma_{ab} + Gamma_{ba} = dg_{ab} = d(eta_{ab}) = 0.
Likewise, the curvature 2-form
R^a_b = R^a_{bcd} e^c ^ e^d
becomes anti-symmetric
R_{ab} + R_{ba} = d^2 g_{ab} = 0,
when the index is lowered R_{ab} = eta_{ac} R^c_b.

This general framework, given by (1) and (2), is that of a metric
affine theory -- one with a metric and a (generally independent)
affine connection. Assumption (3) reduces the connection, in effect,
further to a gauge 1-form associated with the Lorentz group. So the
gauge field would be
A = 1/2 Gamma_{ab} J^{ab}
where (J^{ab}) are the generators of the Lorentz group. The field
strength
F = dA + 1/2 [A,A] = 1/2 R_{ab} J^{ab}
is associated with the curvature.

The frame and torsion are frequently added into this picture by
relating them to the generators (P_{a}) associated with translation
(hence, making the total field a gauge field for the Poincare' group).
The total gauge field can be defined that has connection &amp; frames as
gauge potentials and curvature &amp; torsion as field strengths. However,
the Lagrangian for gravity does not fit the mould of a Poincare' gauge
field theory.

When thought of as a Lorentz gauge theory, the most general gauge-
invariant Lagrangian will be one whose functional dependence on the
frame fields and connections and their derivatives and other field
quantities is restricted in the following ways:
(1) All dependence on field derivatives is through the Lorentz gauge
covariant derivatives (which means, here, the covariant-with-respect-
to-the-connection derivatives)
(2) All dependence on the frames' derivatives is likewise through
their covariant derivatives; i.e. the torsion
(3) All dependence on the connections' derivatives is through the
curvature 2-forms
(4) No other explicit dependence on the connection exists

Denoting gauge-covariant derivatives by D, denoting field quantities
by q, denoting the torsion 2-form by T^a, the Lagrangian for gravity +
field theory then has the form
L = L(R, e, T, q, Dq).
For pure gravity, it is only a function L = L(R, e, T).i

The only combinations you can cobble 4-forms out of from R, e, T are
those of the forms:
1. epsilon_{abcd} R^{ab} ^ R^{cd}
2. R^{ab} ^ R_{ab}
3. T^a ^ T_a
4. R_{ab} ^ e^a ^ e^b
5. epsilon_{abcd} R^{ab} ^ e^c ^ e^d
6. epsilon_{abcd} e^a ^ e^b ^ e^c ^ e^d

The terms 1, 2 and 3 can be partially integrated out in the action
integral or otherwise eliminated in favor of terms 4, 5 and 6.

Term 4 gives you the curvature scalar, term 6 gives you the
cosmological constant. Term 5 gives you a parity-violating term that
drops out for pure gravity but stays in when gravity is combined with
matter. Einstein-Cartan is generally only defined with 4 and maybe 6.
Experimental tests for coupling with a term like 5 are underway. Uncle
Al talks frequently about parity-violating gravity here and elsewhere,
for instance.

That's partly why I'm interested in it. I found the idea that GR can't
do spin-orbit coupling to be curious. Plus GR bores me now - all the
stuff I can do by hand is of the most simplistic fashion and doesn't
contain any cool insights anymore. The more interesting stuff required
serious computing power and programming knowledge - neither of which I
have. I think it merits some &quot;thinking about&quot; time because the idea of
spin-orbit coupling isn't that foreign.

Since it hasn't been developed at all, I'm having to build stuff by
hand. For example, I want to see what the E-C version of Schwarzschild
would look like - with no assumptions on the spin tensor other than it
being constant - and I'm STILL NOT DONE YET. Tossing symmetry of the
connection ruined my shit - I found 31 non-zero connection components
and I still need to go over it again to make sure I didn't screw
something up because I was littering my math with sign errors because
of the way I wrote down some of the definitions.

The Riemann curvature tensor doesn't have a hope in hell of ever being
written down by me anytime soon. I skipped to the Ricci tensor, which
is the quantity I wanted. Sixteen components and I can't assume
anything other than it being equal to zero. I'm still not done writing
it down yet. R_tt occupies a large fraction of a 8.5x11&quot; piece of
paper! I don't even know if I'll be able to analytically solve the
equations. Given that I average an algebra error per page of written
math - more if it is math I don't use on a regular basis - this is
going to take forever to get to a point where I'm comfortable with it.

I was worried I'd have to build up the linearized theory by myself. Un/
fortunately someone beat me to it.

Plus I'm having a hell of a time with interpreting the spin tensor.
The only physical example I have is the product of the four-velocity
with the angular momentum tensor. I think know how to interpret that,
but I'm not exactly sure if that's what I want. I think I'll take that
and run with it, because a static object has only the time component
in its' four velocity, so I would have a spin tensor of S^t_ij. I'd
like to see more examples, but all I have seen is the Weyseenhof
fluid.

Relativistic spin orbit coupling is all but impossible to measure for
its vanishingly small amplitude and unobtainable (with one exception,
below) acceptable test cases.  That it is forbidden in GR by symmetry
is a lethal flaw nevertheless.  Who bells the cat?  How?

GOOD STUFF!  Postulating isotropic space and the Equivalence Principle
marvelously simplifies the maths.  It empirically works, too, except
for angular momentum - physical spin, quantum spin (particle and
orbital; magnets), spin-orbit coupling... and starting in 1999,
geometric parity.  Chirality is shown to arise from moments of inertia
by Petitjean.  Mass sector only.  The massless sector cannot be
configured.  Chirality requires a minimum of 4 non-coplanar points.
Calculated perfect parity divergence appears at 13 points (possibly
fewer?).  Point group T would do it (not Th or Td), four points again,
but auxiliary points are needed to lift reflection symmetries if the
points are indistinguishable (gravitation is blind to observables) and
all moments of inertia of the final construct must be identical.
(Regular dodecahedron as carbon atoms, add a carbon at its center,
inverted bond it to four surface atoms with best fit, add eight
hydrogens to cap free valences, minimize energy to give point group T,
strip hydrogens.  CHI=1 exactly.)

We can calculate or estimate divergence amplitude in GR-contradictory
cases.  *No* composition EP test has a chance for detectable anomaly.
Properties' mass-equivalents are way too small - the fraction of
active mass in total test mass is vanishingly small.  Matter is matter
and only the net difference of a small increment counts.
(epsilon_a)(epsilon_b) = hopeless.

Binary pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B with relativistic spinning masses (20%
of lightspeed at equator and tight orbit) could show GR-flasification
over 20 years observation.

Parity EP tests contrast the geometry of opposite parity mass
distributions fitting into or falling within isotropic (metric) or
chiral (non-metric) vacuum.  100% of the nuclear mass defines
geometric parity divergence by its relative positions in space one
parity of test mass vs. the other, left and right shoes on a left foot
of vacuum.  Ignoring electrons entirely gives a minimum 400X boost to
an EP parity signal compared to the best possible EP composition
tests.

But why look at (mass_inertial - mass_gravitational)?  It is the
differential *energy* of fit that is interesting, both static
(insertion into vacuum) and dynamic (falling through vacuum).  Left
and right shoes fit with different energies onto a left foot.  Melt
them into identical achiral socks while fitted and the two energies of
transition to a common state must be different.  Put on two left shoes
and try walking a straight line.  E=mc^2.  That is a 9x10^16 boost in
signal, MKS.

A very slow, expensive, and difficult parity Eotvos experiment in
single crystal quartz seeking 10^(-13) mass/mass EP divergence becomes
a fast, cheap, and easy calorimetric experiment in single crystal
benzil.  The static insertion parity differential is a constant
background.  The EP contribution is 24-hr modulated by the angle
between the Earth's spin and orbit accelerations.

The vacuum may not be chiral.  The vacuum may not be detectably
chiral.  We do know that if the vacuum shows a 10^(-13) parity Eotvos
experiment net signal it also shows an 8% parity calorimetry signal in
apparatus with 0.1% precision that can be trivially calibrated with
racemic powdered benzil.  80X signal above measurement noise is one
Hell of an experiment!  8X signal/noise is wholly credible if
reproducible.

Academic discovery is crushed by risk-minimized funding - even for an

The metric for a stationary spherically symmetric field is already
mostly determined by the requirement that it be stationary (i.e. that
it has a time-like Killing field) and spherically symmetric (that is,
that it is acted on by 3 Killing fields that represent SO(3) but
locally have dimension 2, generating the spherical shells).

The requirements reduce the metric to the form
ds^2 = e^{2A} dr^2 + e^{2B} (d(theta)^2 + (sin(theta) d(phi))^2) -
e^{2C} dt^2
where A, B and C are functions only of r. A coordinate gauge condition
can reduce the 3 functions {A,B,C} to 2. For Schwarzschild
coordinates, r is defined as 1/(4 pi) times the square root of the
area of the sphere of symmetry, so that B = log(r). But it's best to
just leave A, B and C alone and keep them in all the way through the
calculations.

All of this is independent of what the connection may be. The
connection will be Levi-Civita + contorsion, as you noted. The
contorsion is effectively a set of independent field variables.

The equations for the free field with the Lagrangian I spelled out
will be identical to those for ordinary GR. That's because one of the
equations derived from the Lagrangian will be (torsion = 0). Einstein-
Cartan and General Relativity are identical in the absence of matter
-- even with the addition of the parity-violating term to the
Lagrangian. You need matter to make a difference.

Since contorsion can be reduced to torsion, and since the difference
between the curvature associated with the native connection and the
curvature associated with the Levi-Civita connection involves only the
contorsion, then there is an expression for the (Levi-Civita) Einstein
tensor entirely written in terms of the native connection and torsion.
This gives you the GR-equivalent expression for the matter field.

If that's all there was to it, then Einstein-Cartan would be nothing
more than GR + field theory for torsion. However, the effective stress
tensor associated with the GR-equivalent Einstein tensor need not
satisfy the usual energy conditions imposed on GR. That's because spin
has an anti-gravity centrifugal effect.

Einstein-Cartan cosmological models exist that differ from those in GR
in that the centrifugal effect dominates in the earliest phases,
thereby offsetting the initial Big-Bang singularity and leading to a
bouncing solution. Trautman's paper on Einstein-Cartan, which I assume
someone else here mentioned, is a quasi-standard reference. It
mentioned such solutions along with providing references.

Lately, I've approached the whole enterprise from a different
standpoint that might ultimately shed some light on matters here.

The simplest way to write down the kinematic and dynamic field laws is
to express the connection part of the field as a Lorentz gauge field,
as I mentioned before:
A = 1/2 Gamma^{ab} J_{ab}.
Then express the Lie bracket for the Lorentz gauge generators in
algebraic form as commutators:
[J_{ab}, J_{cd}] = J_{ab} J_{cd} - J_{cd} J_{ab}.
Combine this algebra with that for the differential forms
Gamma^{ab} = eta^{bc} Gamma^a_{dc} e^d.
So the product of A with itself will be
A^2 = 1/4 Gamma^{ab} J_{ab} Gamma^{cd} J_{cd}
= 1/4 Gamma^{ab} ^ Gamma^{cd} (J_{ab} J_{cd}).
Since the wedge product is anti-symmetric, then this may be
equivalently written as
A^2 = 1/8 (Gamma^{ab} ^ Gamma^{cd}) (J_{ab} J_{cd} - J_{cd} J_{ab})
= 1/8 (Gamma^{ab} ^ Gamma^{cd}) [J_{ab}, J_{cd}].

The Lie bracket for the Lorentz group is
[J_{ab}, J_{cd}] = eta_{bc} J_{ad} - eta_{bd} J_{ac} - eta_{ac}
J_{bd} + eta_{ad} J_{bc}.
So, as a result, this gives you the correct form for the quadratic
terms which, when combined with dA, gives you the curvature as the
corresponding field strength:
F = dA + A^2 = 1/2 R^{ab} J_{ab}.

The frame field and matter fields can be treated in the same way,
together. So, suppose you have a matter field expressed as a m-form
field,
q = (1/m!) q^{A}_{n1 ... nm} E_{A} e^{n1} ^ ... e^{nm}.
Here the matter field is assumed to have a field index A identifying
components with respect to some linear space whose basis is E_{A}.

The frame field is subsumed under this as a 1-form field
e = e^a p_a
where the &quot;basis&quot; p_a is sometimes likened to as the translation
generators of a Poincare' gauge field.

Assume the algebraic representation is extended so that the Lorentz
gauge generators act on the left. Thus, for the frame field, one has
J_{ab} (p_c) = eta_{bc} p_a - eta_{ac} p_b.
For a matter field, what you get will depend on what kind of index A
is. If it's a tensor index, then A is actually a composite consisting
of a number of space-time indices in the upper position and a number
in the lower position. For a scalar m-form valued field, A will reduce
to an empty slot and there will be no indices there.

With these items in mind, the torsion and covariant derivatives can be
written in algebraic form as
T = de + Ae, v = dq + Aq.
The covariant derivatives of &quot;q&quot; give you the gauge-covariant
&quot;velocities&quot; v associated with the field.

Thus, you have a set of equations relating field-strengths (and
&quot;velocities&quot;) to gauge-potentials (and field components):
F = dA + A^2, T = de + Ae, v = dq + Aq. (1)

differential forms. Thus,
d(A^2) = (dA) A - A (dA), d(Ae) = (dA) e - A (de); d(Aq) = (dA)q -
A(dq);
while
d(dA) = 0, d(de) = 0, d(dq) = 0.
Thus, you find that
dF = (dA) A - A (dA) = (F - A^2) A - A (F - A^2) = FA - AF
dT = (dA) e - A (de) = (F - A^2) e - A (T - Ae) = Fe - AT
dv = (dA) q - A (dq) = (F - A^2) q - A (v - Aq) = Fq - Av.
Putting these together, you get the Bianchi identities and the
&quot;homogeneous&quot; field equations for the field q:
dF + AF - FA = 0, dT + AT = Fe, dv + Av = Fq. (2)
The Bianchi identity (dT + AT = Fe) is the one that gives you R_{abcd}
+ R_{acdb} + R_{adbc} = 0 when the torsion is absent.

To determine the dynamics, assume the Lagrangian is a function of only
the potentials and covariant derivatives:
L = L(A, e, q, F, T, v).
This here is the Lagrangian 4-form. So, written in terms of the
Lagrangian density *L, it would be:
L = *L e^1 ^ e^2 ^ e^3 ^ e^4.
But it's best to work with the 4-form, instead of with the density.

As per the previous discussion, there will be no explicit dependence
on A, but it'll be kept in for now. The total variational in the
Lagrangian (using D as ASCII for &quot;delta&quot;) will then factor out to
something of the form:
DL = DA . S + De . P + Dq . f - DF . U - DT . X + (-1)^m Dv . p.

Here, the indices attached to e and q (e^a, q^A) will be complemented
by indices attached to P and f (P_a, f_A). Similarly for the other
terms. Therefore, it is assumed that the expression above involves a
contraction on these indices. Thus, for instance,
De . P = De^a ^ P_a, Dq . f = Dq^A ^ f_A.

This introduces the dynamic fields S, P, f, U, X and p. The fields S,
P are 3-form currents (for spin and momentum). The field f is (4-m)
form valued. The fields U, X are 2-forms and function as
&quot;superpotentials&quot; for S and P. The field X will ultimately be involved
in giving you the extra &quot;orbital&quot; contribution to the spin current 3-
form J. The field p is a (3-m) form.

To define covariant derivatives for these fields, the action of the
Lorentz group has to be defined for the corresponding bases. Thus, the
fields written out fully are:
S = 1/2 S_{ab} j^{ab}, U = 1/2 U_{ab} j^{ab}
P = P_a p^a, X = X_a p^a
f = f_A E^A, p = p_A E^A,
where j^{ab} is the dual to the Lie basis J_{ab}, p^a and E^A are
duals to p_a and E_A.

It is assumed that the algebraic representation is defined in such a
way that the contractions satisfy the same cyclicity is satisfied that
would be satisfied for the trace. Thus, for instance,
p_c . p^d J_{ab}
= J_{ab} p_c . p^d
= (eta_{bc} p_a - eta_{ac} p_b) . p^d
= eta_{bc} delta^d_a - eta_{ac} delta^d_b,
so that
p^d J_{ab} = (eta_{bc} p^c) delta^d_a - (eta_{ac} p^c) delta^d_b.

When differential forms are involved, the cyclicity condition has to
account for transposing the terms involved in the various wedge
products. Thus, one has
A q . p = - q . p A,
since the 1-form A passes over the m-form q and (3-m) form p, for a
total of 3 transpositions.

For pure gravity with any of the Lagrangian terms I previously
described, L = L(e, F), so the only non-zero terms are P and U. The 3-
form P is the Einstein tensor(!), up to sign. The Euler-Lagrange
equation for the 2-form U involve the spin tensor, which will be
derived from U. It will lead to 0 for the torsion.

With the Lagrangians I previously described, the components U_{ab} of
the 2-form U = 1/2 U_{ab} J^{ab} will more or less just be the 2-forms
constructed from the frame, itself. So, the plane elements play the
role as the superpotential U.

The variation satisfies the ordinary Leibnitz rule, so for instance
D(A^2) = DA A + A DA.

The variationals can thus be worked out explicitly and partially
integrated:
DF . U = D(dA + A^2) . U = d(DA).U + (DA A.U + A DA.U).

Noting that
d(DA.U) = d(DA).U - DA.dU,
partial integration yields
D(dA).U = d(DA).U = d(DA.U) + DA.dU.
Thus,
DF.U = d(DA.U) + DA.dU + DA A.U + A DA.U
= d(DA.U) + DA.(dU + AU - UA).

Similarly, we obtain
DT.X = D(de + Ae).X
= d(De.X) + De.dX + DA.eX - De.X A
= d(De.X) + De.(dX - XA) + DA.(eX).
and
Dv.p = D(dq + Aq).p
= d(Dq.p) - (-1)^m Dq.dp + DA.q p - Dq. p A
= d(Dq.p) + DA.(qp) + Dq.(-pA - (-1)^m dp).

Combining these results, we get:
DL = d(-DA.U - De.X + (-1)^m Dq.p)
+ DA.(S - dU - AU + UA - eX - (-1)^m qp)
+ De.(p - dX + XA)
+ Dq.(f - dp - (-1)^m pA).

The boundary term gives you the canonical 1-form for the field theory
theta = -DA.U - De.X + (-1)^m Dq.p
out of which all the conservation laws (and ultimately, even the
Poisson-brackets and quantization) would proceed.

The remaining terms give you, as Euler-Lagrange equations, the dynamic
laws:
dU + AU - UA = J, dX - XA = P, dp + (-1)^m pA = f. (3)
where
J = S + eX + (-1)^m qp.
The decomposition
J -&gt; S + eX
excluding the matter field, is the spin-orbit decomposition.

Since the Lagrangian (as per the previous discussion) has no explicit
dependence on A, S would be 0. The only contribution to the intrinsic
spin, therefore, would be from the matter field,
S* = (-1)^m qp.
Thus, the spin-orbit decomposition would be:
J = S* + eX.

Differentiating these equations leads to the conservation laws,
dJ + AJ - JA = FU - UF, dP + PA = -XF, df - (-1)^m fA = -pF. (4)
The first equation involving S would give you something more complex
which ultimately yields the equation for the anti-symmetric part of
the matter stress tensor.

I haven't quite yet linked this to the spin tensor, but the spin
tensor should be involved somewhere when you write out the first
equation replacing the angular momentum 3-form J by the spin 3-form
S*.

For pure gravity, equations (3) and (4) reduce to:
dU + AU - UA = 0, P = 0
and
FU - UF = 0,
with J = S = 0 and X = 0.

Do you have any good explanations/examples/references for the spin 3-
form? I'm finding physical explanations and examples to be hard to
come by. Then again, I have found less than a half dozen /good/
references in the topic so I'm not too surprised that things are hard
to find.

It is my understanding that angular momentum generalizes to a rank 2
tensor. The only physical example I have seen is provided by the
Weyssenhoff fluid in which the spin 3-form is the product of the four-
velocity and the angular momentum tensor. Since I'm eyeing the
Schwarzschild [analog] solution, I'm trying to imagine how that would
work.

Then I remembered that the four-velocity is your velocity though space-
time rather than just three-space, and that a static object can have a
four-velocity! The only nonzero component would be the time component
which I could define through the four-velocity normalization condition
[I'm not sure if thats the best idea, but I think it'd work], which
would leave me stuff which I can actually think about in a useful
sense.

No surprises here. I sat for awhile reading proofs of Birkhoff's

&gt; All of this is independent of what the connection may be. The

I'll be honest - I don't understand the Lagrangian formalism of this
yet. It is one of my weak spots that I'm going to correct.

It has been shown that you can decompose the torsion tensor into a two
parts, one of which is traceless. Apparently the traceless part of the
torsion tensor goes away in vacuum. I have no physical explanation for
why - it is apparently a condition that holds in vacuum as shown here:
http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9309027 .

What also holds is that the trace of the spin tensor exerts influence.
So far, I have found that to be the case. I have pages of stuff
riddled with s and s^2 trace terms.

You can also look at the weak field version of E-C theory and see
contributions from spin. Spin has no coupling to matter that I have to
respect. If the Kerr solution can have rotating vacuum, why can't I
have the same thing here?

BTW, I have it as a thought in my head that I might be able to get the
Kerr solution by assuming a specific form of spin. But that's another
project for another time, Kerr sounds to be a nightmare to derive. I
need to get the mathematical machinery working right before I do
something like /that/.

&gt; Since contorsion can be reduced to torsion, and since the difference

Trautman's paper is good, but it leaves a few things out. Like the

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein-Cartan_theory
No relativistic spin-orbit momentum exchange in metric gravitation

Geometric parity anomalies arising from Einstein-Cartan broken
symmetry allowing relativistic spin-orbit coupling do *not* contradict
prior theory or observation.  Covariance with respect to reflection in
space and time is not required by the Poincaré group of Special
Relativity or the Einstein group of General Relativity.

A chiral vacuum background is anisotropic space.  Noether's theorem
would not require conservation of angular momentum (for opposite
parity mass distributions).  Quantum field theories (QFT) with
hermitian hamiltonians are invariant under the Poincaré group
containing spatial reflections.  Parity is a spatial reflection and
parity is not a QFT symmetry!  QFT are invariant under the identity
component of the Poincaré group - the subgroup consisting of elements
that can be continuous path joined to the Poincaré group identity;
only orthochronous Poincaré group representations.  This subgroup
excludes parity and time reversal.  All hermitian hamiltonians will
contain a symmetry and an observable with the properties of parity,
even though the Hamiltonian will not be symmetric under space
reflection.  QFT with non-hermitian Hamiltonians can have real and
positive energy spectra with PT invariance, but do not contain parity
invariance alone.

Electromagnetism (no atomic nuclei) does not include opposite parity
configurations.  Chemical chirality is primarily composition chirality
detected electromagnetically (circular dichroism, optical rotatory
dispersion, other chiroptical methods).  Gravitation is blind to
physical observables.  In vacuum free fall all bodies are anonymous
unit masses.  Only chirality derived from mass configuration could be
active.

There are 230 unique ways to periodically order points in space, the
crystallographic space groups.  65 Sohncke space groups are chiral.
11 pairs within those are opposite parity space groups.  Opposite
parity space groups P3(1)21 and P3(2)21 *always* calculate to maximum
geometric parity divergence with increasing radius: alpha-quartz,
berlinite and (Al, Ga, Fe, Bi)(P, As)O4 overall, grey selenium,
tellurium, cinnabar, and benzil.  Those are candidate opposite parity
test masses for falsifying isotropic vacuum.

None of those are chiral isolated formula units by composition
configuration or geometric configuration.  Chirality strictly arises
from crystal lattice distortion of conformation.  Melting,
dissolution, sublimation, or combustion (where appropriate) destroys
chirality and parity divergence (*not* racemization).  One can
therefore probe both dynamic (Equivalence Principle parity violation
in an Eotvos balance) and static (differential vacuum insertion energy
via enthalpy of fusion calorimetry, and EP vs. time) parity anomalies.

Why hasn't anybody looked?  Ab initio calculated geometric parity
divergence appeared in 1999.  Gravitation physics doesn't know beans
about stereochemistry or crystallography.  The inquiry is wickedly
interdisciplinary (unfundable).
