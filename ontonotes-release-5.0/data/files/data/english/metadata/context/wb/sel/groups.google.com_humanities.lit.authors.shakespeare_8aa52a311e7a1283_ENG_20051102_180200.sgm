________________________________________________________

On March 22, 1601 Oxford wrote a letter to his former
brother-in-law Robert Cecil.

Oxford's letter is 488 words in length.

In 1920 Thomas Looney reprinted the same letter from
Oxford to Cecil in the Oxfordian textus receptus,
Shakespeare Identified.

After Looney slashed his way through Oxford's letter
he left only 127 words. Looney then edited Oxford's syntax
to make it look more Shakespearean.

Looney excised 361 words or 74% of &quot;Shakespeare's&quot; letter
because it wasn't Shakespearean enough. The best of
Oxford's genuine letter is his emotional reaction to
Cecil's double dealing. That Oxford didn't make the cut.

The question is whether Oxfordians would have swooned to
Looney's romantic idealization of Oxford if Looney had
printed the historical Oxford's texts. What was Looney's
motive in redacting the letter? Have Oxfordians fallen
for a spurious earl?

I've posted below a line by line comparison with Looney's
version and Oxford's original letter with links. With no
html capability I'm using caps and blank spaces to show
what Looney removed and revised in Oxford's text.

Looney's redacted version:

[198] Earl of Oxford to Sir Robert Cecil:
&quot;It is now a year since Her Majesty granted her interest in Danver's
escheat. I find that the lands will be carried without deed. I have
twice moved Her Majesty to grant me that ordinary course, whereof there
are more than one hundred examples. Mine answer was that 1 should
receive her pleasure from you. But I understand by Cauley that she hath
never spoken thereof. The matter hath been heard twice before the
judges but their report hath never been made. I challenge that
something be done whereby I may, upon ground, seek and try Her
Majesty's right, which cannot be done without this deed aforesaid. I
desire to know Her Majesty's pleasure touching her patent (de bene
esse) whether she will perform it or no.&quot;

It ys now a yeare sythence by yowre only meanes her Magestye graunted

yowre mouthe I fynde by thys waste of Tyme, that landes will not be

yt wowld please her to graunte me that ordinarie course (de bene esse

myne answer ys that I showld receyve her pleasure from yow. But I
vnderstand by Cauley that shee hathe never spoken therof. The matter
hathe beene hard [=heard] accordinge to the order with muche a doo
twice before the Iugges, and many also standers by dyd heare the same,

have taken the opinion of the rest of the Iugges and conferringe yt
wythe his owne to have made vp a report to her Magestie. As for the
Iugges report they weere never caald vnto yt, and the principall
poyntes to confirme her Magesties tytell never opned or moved, but
contrarie kept bake. So that vnder there hands the Lord chiefe Iustice
hathe made no report. Yet sumthinge he hathe done owt of his owne brest
that ys secret and I cannot lerne, yf he have reported nothinge to
Eschete to her Magestie, then ys my sute as yt was the fyrst day, that
ys where her Magestie thowght she hadd nothinge, that she wowld graunt
me her Interest. thys sut I obteyned by yowre espetiall meanes, and
this she promisde me, wherfore [..] Hervpon I chalenge that sumthynge
myght be done, wherby I may vpon grovnde seke and trye her Magesties
ryght, whiche cannot be done wythout this dede a fore spoken of. The
course whyche syldome or never hathe bene vsed before in this cause, to
refer yt to the Iugges, how pr'iuditiall a pr'sident I know not to
her Magestie, hathe bene obserued, and the effect hathe showed that
whearas yt was pretended to be shortest, yt hathe bene the furthest way
about. and as the beginninge was but sume opinione the end ys but
confusione. Now therfore the matter havinge bene directed by this
course for a whoole yeares space, and come to no better termes, my
desyre ys to know her Magesties plesure touchinge [my desyre of] her
patent, (De bene esse) whyther she will performe yt or noo. If not then
have I bene mocked, yf ye [=yea], that I myght have answer, wherby I
may vpon reason quiet my selfe, and not vpon wearines. How sooever an
answer shalbe most welcome vnto me, now beinge the best expectatione of

Elizabeth.

Thanks for posting &quot;Looney's redacted version&quot; of Edward Oxenford's
letter.

In the context of the Shakespeare Authorship Issue, the &quot;redaction&quot;
signals one of two things -

1. That Looney was an intellectual shyster, or

2. That there is more to the redacted version than meets the eye.

The first alternative does not square with the image of the man which I
found on the Internet just now, reported by someone who knew him well.

The second alternative would mirror what I am persuaded is in fact the
case - that the First Folio comprised the works of Edward Oxenford as
&quot;redacted&quot; and augmented by Francis Bacon and Ben Jonson.

I expect to post more on the subject matter tomorrow.

For now, let me just note that, immediately after the &quot;redacted&quot;
version, there comes the following quotation:

&quot;If Her Majesty's affections be forfeits of men's estates we must
endure it.&quot; (Cipher Value 33354)

That, indeed, is the philosophy of the Shakespeare Authors - for all
the world's a stage etc. and &quot;There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
Rough-hew them how we will.&quot;

On October 7, 1601, Edward Oxenford chose to &quot;endure it&quot; and left his
&quot;Booke from her Magestie&quot; for &quot;Cosen Bacon and Seriant Harris to perfet
yt&quot; - and Looney proceeds to refer to this in his text.

As in 33354 + 708 + 1601 = 35663,

And that gets us straight to THE Shakespeare Mystery, as in 1 + 35662 =
35663, where

1 = Monad/Her Magestie/God; and

35662 = A Poore Stratfordian Player's Houre Vpon the Stage.*

* From 'baptism' as Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakspere, 17252, on
April 26, 1564, to The End, 100, and 'burial' as Will Shakspere gent,
10026, on April 25, 1616 as in 17252 + 2602 + 1564 + 100 + 10026 + 2502
+ 1616 = 35662.

***
So what do I make of all this?

Looney KNEW the facts of the matter, as safe-guarded for the past 400
years by &quot;the grand possessors&quot; - portrayed in Mozart's masonic 'Magic
Flute' as Sarastro and associates in The Temple of the Sun.

And why didn't Looney come straight out and say so?

SILENCE is a Pythagorean watchword: Don't Throw Pearls Before Swine.

P.S. After posting this, it occurred to me to check the Cipher Value
of the name Sarastro.

It is 5163.

Might Sarastro be the Masonic counterpart to Prospero, 5452 as in 5163
+ 5452 = 10615?

Perhaps - as in 4000 - 1000 + 7615 = 10615, where

4000 = Flaming Sword erupting out of the

- 1000 = Darkness of Ignorance, commanding the Prince of Darkness,

7615 = Get thee hence, Satan. (Matt. 4:10)

&quot;SILENCE is a Pythagorean watchword: Don't Throw Pearls Before Swine.&quot;
- The Great Gangleri

And why does he not follow Pythagoras' injunction? Is he greater than
four centuries' worth of &quot;grand possessors&quot;?

Another of the indicia of the crank is that he casually discloses
&quot;secrets&quot; that have for generations allegedly been closely guarded and
dangerous to know.

&gt; As in 33354 + 708 + 1601 = 35663,

&gt; And that gets us straight to THE Shakespeare Mystery, as in 1 + 35662 =

&gt; 1 = Monad/Her Magestie/God; and

&gt; 35662 = A Poore Stratfordian Player's Houre Vpon the Stage.*

&gt; * From 'baptism' as Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakspere, 17252, on

&gt; + 1616 = 35662.

&gt; ***
&gt; So what do I make of all this?

&gt; Looney KNEW the facts of the matter, as safe-guarded for the past 400
&gt; years by &quot;the grand possessors&quot; - portrayed in Mozart's masonic 'Magic

&gt; And why didn't Looney come straight out and say so?

The Shakespeare Pythagoreans did NOT do their magnificent work in order
that it remain unknown - except to its (apparently) Pythagorean/Masonic
&quot;grand possessors&quot; - forever.

That would have been dumb tomfoolery on their part.

Here (in translation) is what Francis Bacon's personal secretary Dr.
William Rawley wrote in his preface to 'Manes Verulamiani' - a
collection of thirty-two Latin elegies on Bacon's death:

&quot;Let it suffice to lay these Foundations in the name of the present
age, every age will enlarge and adorn this Edifice; but to what Age is
given to set the finishing hand is manifest only to God, the Fates, and
Tom Veal.&quot;

I don't think Looney was an intellectual shyster

There's no Shakespearean trope there, Gunnar. Oxford
meant it literally.

In the 16th century &quot;affection&quot; didn't mean love as
it does now, it meant &quot;a bent of mind&quot; and it had
to have an object, in this instance the Queen's objective is
the &quot;forfeit of mens' estates.&quot; She has a bent of mind,
a passion, a want, for some estates to be forfeited.

The downside of the feudal system was that there was an
incentive for the sovereign to execute earls in order
to &quot;escheat&quot; their estates. The last four Tudors
executed forty-seven earls or at least that's what I've
read.

The Danvers escheat (also a noun) is the subject
of the 1601 and 1602 letters, but the 1596 letter
seems to be about something Lord Burghley wants
Oxford to do to Essex. Oxford tells Cecil he declined
Burghley's request.

It's likely that Burghley, the Queen and Cecil are plotting
to do something to curtail Essex' growing political power.

There's not much doubt among historians that the
Cecils were trying to turn the Queen against Essex.
The Queen did strip Essex of his monopolies leaving him
in a cash flow crisis which would cause him to forfeit
estates.

In the letter (of 1596) Oxford tells Cecil that he didn't
want to do whatever Burghley had in mind but he also
says that he and Cecil will have to &quot;endure&quot; (continue)
in carrying out the Queen's scheme to the effect
that &quot;we might as well endure because the Queen always
gets what she wants.&quot;

I think it's very possible that Cecil told Oxford that he
(Oxford) was doing duty for the Queen when Oxford
was unknowingly working for Cecil.

In the letter that is the subject of this thread Oxford is
angry because he caught Cecil in a lie. Cecil told Oxford
in the previous year (1601) that the Queen asked Cecil to
speak for her in regard to Oxford's interest in the Danvers
estates.

The fact that a year later Oxford had not heard from
Cecil and had not received his deed from the Queen
caused Oxford to got to &quot;Cauley&quot; to ask Cauley if the
Queen had given instructions to Cecil in regard to
Oxford's suit. Cauley told Oxford that the Queen gave
no instructions to Cecil.

Too bad there's not a third letter.

Cordially,

Elizabeth

&gt; ________________________________________________________

&gt; On March 22, 1601 Oxford wrote a letter to his former
&gt; brother-in-law Robert Cecil.

&gt; Oxford's letter is 488 words in length.

&gt; In 1920 Thomas Looney reprinted the same letter from
&gt; Oxford to Cecil in the Oxfordian textus receptus,
&gt; Shakespeare Identified.

&gt; After Looney slashed his way through Oxford's letter
&gt; he left only 127 words. Looney then edited Oxford's syntax
&gt; to make it look more Shakespearean.

&gt; Looney excised 361 words or 74% of &quot;Shakespeare's&quot; letter
&gt; because it wasn't Shakespearean enough. The best of
&gt; Oxford's genuine letter is his emotional reaction to
&gt; Cecil's double dealing. That Oxford didn't make the cut.

&gt; The question is whether Oxfordians would have swooned to
&gt; Looney's romantic idealization of Oxford if Looney had
&gt; printed the historical Oxford's texts. What was Looney's
&gt; motive in redacting the letter? Have Oxfordians fallen
&gt; for a spurious earl?

I've long wondered why no one has investigated Looney searching for
examples of such fraud. Thank you, Elizabeth. Meanwhile, Kos-itsky,

Chaucer becomes a crank! Why did he encipher a great chunk of his own title?
Shall we trust his own comment on it, which was to the same effect as &quot;Don't
Throw Pearls Before Swine&quot;?

This is often taken to mean that the pearls are wasted, but can as well be
seen as a responsible concern - not placing perils before swine, so to
speak.

letter. How could it be wrong if Oxford was really
Shakespeare?

I'm not indicting Looney. We've cracked the genetic
code. We've got iPods. It's time for the Oxfordians to
let go of 1920.

Who. Looney?

***
Here is the Internet piece in question:

JOHN THOMAS LOONEY (1870-1944)

By Professor The Revd. V. A. Demant, Canon of Christ Church, Oxford. As
printed in Shakespearean Authorship Review # 8 - Autumn 1962, pp 8-9.

John Thomas Looney, who first attributed the authorship of the
&quot;Shakespearean&quot; plays and sonnets to Edward de Vere, Seventeenth Earl
of Oxford, was a master at an elementary school in Low Fell, Gateshead,
County Durham. As my father and he were close friends in personal and
intellectual interests, our families met in close intimacy for several
years. In my student period I came to know Looney as a philosopher and
guide. I am therefore able to say something of the man himself and of
his search for a solution of the authorship problem.

Looney, who came of Manx origin, was a person of broad philosophical,
religious and literary interests. He was deeply impressed by greatness
in the past of the European tradition, and he felt it his calling to
transmit an appreciation of this greatness to the younger gneration.
For some years he belonged to a group of English followers of Auguste
Comte, the French philosopher and social thinker, who started the
original intellectual system known as Positivism. Comte later founded a
religious society known as theistic beliefs, called the Church of
Humanity. Comte was a progressive intellectually in the 19th century,
but socially a conservative of the counter revolution in France. Looney
derived from Comte a strong sense of the continuity of history and of
the community basis of individual enterprise. Looney eventually
loosened his connection with the Positivist movement and latterly
became drawn again to the Church of England, with considerable respect
for Catholicism. Looney's reading included English poets from Chaucer
to Wordsworth, Tennyson, Byron and Burns; writers like Carlyle,
Emerson, John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer; novelists like Walter
Scott and Thackeray. He was also at home with Homer, Dante and, of
course, Shakespeare. He presented to me a copy of Carlyle's works
with a special injunction to read &quot;Heroes&quot; before I was twnety. Another
present of his to me was George Tyrrell's Lex Orandi.

I would describe Looney as a sage. He was not in the least like many
supporters of minority movements with a cause, going about with a chip
on the shoulder and an obsessional neurosis. One would never know from
his general conversation that he was producing a shattering
contribution to the authorship question. He was not by temperament an
anti-conformist, nor did he preen himself for the role of espousing an
unpopular view. The appearance of Shakespeare Identified in 1920
surprised his acquaintances. He had dropped hints to me towards the end
of the 1914-18 war, that the Stratfordian authorship was impossible to
hold, and that he was setting about deliberately to find, if possible,
the true author. This was all the result of a conviction borne upon his
mind after years of teaching Shakespearean plays to schoolboys, some of
the plays were studied over and over again. He has described this
process in his introduction to &quot;Shakespeare&quot; Identified.

Even after the publication, Looney never brought up the &quot;Shakespeare&quot;
question spontaneously in my conversations with him. But when I asked
he was ready to answer questions and explain. Two phases of his
thinking I remember quite well. There was first the negative conviction
that what we know of William Shakespeare is quite incompatible with the
author revealed through the plays and sonnets. This was not a matter of
social class, or education or even of ideas. It concerned the
unconscious attitudes of the world and life. Quite early on Looney had
to meet the criticism that his was a &quot;snob&quot; view, holding that a man
who had not been to a university and was of bourgeois origin could not
be a literary giant. Looney somewhat resented the stupidity of this
criticism. Certainly, he maintained, genius arises in any social milieu
and is quite independent of formal education (witness Burns). But some
background and peculiar personal attitudes indeliberately colour a
man's work, and another man without them cannot produce counterfeits.
Then, secondly and positively, Looney looked around the large mass of
Elizabethan lyrical poetry to find evidence elsewhere of the same
mentality and style used by the author of Shakespeare's sonnets and
plays. This put Looney on the track of Edward de Vere, some of whose
poems have survived under de Vere's own name or initials E. O. (Earl
of Oxford). Further when Looney was asked how such a deception as to
the authorship could be carried through and maintained, he would
expound the peculiar literary atmosphere of the Elizabethan age and
then enumerate, from cultural and literary history, several examples of
what had been successful literary hoaxes for a long time.

Thomas Looney had embarked upon his task with a restrained but
determined sense of literary responsibility. He was the last man to try
to be merely clever. I recall his tall figure, his scholar's air
given by the poise of his shoulders, his gently aquiline nose and his
trimmed beard, his benign and dignified bearing, and the frequent
sparkle in his eyes. I would say of Looney: here was a man who
commanded confidence in the authorship question because he was not
one-eyed about that, but wise in other fields as well.

[More extensive biographical notes on John Thomas Looney (1870-1944)
are found in Ruth Loyd Miller's 3rd edition of Looney's
&quot;Shakespeare&quot; Identified, Vol I, pp xxix-xxxi; 647-659.]

The cipher value of &quot;oink&quot; is 2103.

Hmm, &quot;21&quot; is the 147 gates of hell. And dividing 2103 by 3 gives 701 -
MAN-Beast of the Seventh Day, plus the monad.

So much significance! How rapturously glad we all are that the Great

Well, I was silent till I had a chance to look at the book rather than
the webpage. Now I have. Looney has standardised and modernised the
spelling, which is perfectly acceptable. He also says he is going to
talk of &quot;one passage,&quot; so it's acceptable too that he doesn't quote the
entire letter. What he's obviously missed is the ellipses. Since he
puts them in other passages, and since their omission doesn't change or
strengthen the case in any way, I would assume, although I am somewhat
surprised, that this was a mistake. But of course, Looney, like all of
us, made mistakes. For example, he thought that The Tempest wasn't by
Shakespeare.

But of course, LynnE, like all of us, makes mistakes.

For example, she thinks that the numbero uno Comedy: _The Tempest_

was actually written before June 24, 1604

and went by the name _The Tragidy of the Spanish Maz_

I just read Looney's Appendix on the authorship of The Tempest - he
provided a great deal of both substantive and technical detail in
support of his conclusion.

If the other side of the argument has been posted on the Internet, I

Hi Gangleri,

Almost every scholar there is, both Strat and non-Strat, has concluded
that The Tempest is at least substantially by Shakespeare. It is such a
non-starter that it isn't that there aren't too many arguments
asserting that it is, either on the web or anywhere else. It is
generally accepted.

To me The Tempest sounds like pure Shakespeare. I can't imagine anyone
else having written, for instance, Ariel's &quot;Full fathom five...&quot; or
his &quot;dive into the fire&quot; speech, and so have never entertained one
moment of doubt that Shakespeare wrote the play. My guess is that
Looney, probably unconsciously, was uncomfortable about the authorship
of Tempest because he, like everyone else at the time, accepted the
current wisdom that the play depended on the Bermuda pamphlets of 1610.
This would have interfered with his thesis that Oxford was Shakespeare.

And Looney does in fact say: &quot;We desire, however, to emphasize the fact
that but for the theory that Edward de Vere was the writer of
Shakespeare's plays we might never have been led to suspect the
authenticity of The Tempest&quot; (530).

I do not find his arguments in Appendix 1 against the play being by
Shakespeare in the least convincing, and in fact it was the Tempest
that was in the past the greatest obstacle to my acceptance of Oxford
as Shakespeare.

Lynne

Thanks, Lynne.

Here are some examples from Looney's Appendix of what I referred to as
&quot;technical detail&quot;:

...we have already had occasion to draw attention to the blank verse of
the first important piece of dialogue in the play: that between
Prospero and Miranda in which the former is relating the story of his
misfortunes. A minute inspection of this discloses the fact that much
of it is not verse at all in the true sense, but merely prose,
artificially cut up into short strips: precisely as, in an earlier
chapter, we saw was actually done in &quot;Coriolanus.&quot; Versification, which
is fundamentally the breaking up of utterances into short pieces, or
lines, according to some rule, always implies that, in a general way,
the pause, formed by the end of the line corresponds to a pause,
however slight, in the spoken utterance; the exceptions to this only
serving to emphasize the rule. When the connection between the last
word of one line and the first word of the next is too close, and such
connections become too frequent, the sense of versification is lost and
it becomes merely dismembered prose.

Take then the two first lines of this dialogue:

&quot;If by your art, my dearest father, you have
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.&quot;

Now, it is hardly possible to get two words more closely connected in
spoken utterances than a Principal and an Auxiliary Verb, when no
adverb comes between them, as in the case of this, verb, &quot;have put.&quot;
Nor is this the only example of its kind. Broken up in precisely the
same way we have the verb,

&quot;had Burnt&quot; (III. 1.); &quot;will Revenge&quot; (III. 2.);
&quot;have Incensed&quot; (III. 3.); &quot;have Been&quot; (V. 1.);
&quot;have Received&quot; (V. 1.); &quot;must Take&quot; (V. 1.)

Taking &quot;Hamlet&quot; as our standard for measuring Shakespeare's style of
versification, we do not find a single example of this defect in the
great masterpiece.

Continuing our examination of this dialogue, we find, a few lines
further on, this, passage:

&quot;It should the good ship so have swallow'd, and
The fraughting souls within her.&quot;

[449] This &quot;and&quot; at the end of lines in &quot;The Tempest&quot; is quite a
feature of its author's style. We pointed it out in the passage &quot;and
Are melted into air.&quot; We find it repeated three times in this short
dialogue:

&quot;and A prince of power;&quot;
&quot;and She said;&quot;

the third being in the above quotation.

In exactly the same way we have:

&quot;and My strong imagination&quot; (II. 1.)
&quot;and I'll seek&quot; (III. 3.)
&quot;and Harmonious charmingly&quot; (IV. 1.)

Again, not once does this defect appear in &quot;Hamlet.&quot;

We have also instances of the conjunction &quot;but&quot; placed at the end of
lines

&quot;but For every trifle&quot; (II. 2.)
&quot;but The mistress&quot; (III. 1.)
&quot;but If thou dost break&quot; (IV. 1.)

Nor does this defect once appear in &quot;Hamlet.&quot;

Examples also occur of lines ending in other Conjunctions, to which may
be added Conjunctive Pronouns and Conjunctive Adverbs:

&quot;who Art ignorant&quot; (1. 2.)
&quot;that Hath kept with thy remembrance&quot; (1. 2.)
&quot;who To trash for over topping&quot; (1. 2.)
&quot;that A noble Neapolitan&quot; (1. 2.)
&quot;that I prize&quot; (1. 2.)
&quot;for He's gentle&quot; (1. 2.)
&quot;whom We all were&quot; (II. 1.)
&quot;that We say befits&quot; (II. 1.)
&quot;which Lie tumbling&quot; (II. 2.)

And so it continues on to end of the play. Yet never once does this
form of intimate connection between the end of one line and the
beginning of the next appear in &quot;Hamlet.&quot; How it is possible to hold,
in face of a comparison of this kind, that the versification of both
plays came from the same pen, is most difficult to understand.

***
I don't know what to make of it - but the difference in &quot;technical
detail&quot; between it and 'Hamlet' strikes me as too great to be
accidental if one accepts that the same mind authored the two plays.

If the mind was that of Edward Oxenford, some two decades would have
passed between the time of writing and the text's publication in the
First Folio.

Considering the (apparent) editorial decisions whereby parts of key
passages in Hamlet - (Horatio's comments on &quot;the mightiest Julius&quot; in
Act I, Sc. i and Hamlet's comments on &quot;This heavy-headed revel east and
west&quot; in Act I, Sc. v) - were left out of the First Folio despite their
having been in the 1611 version, one would have expected the editor(s)

In the circumstances, this would seem to imply

&gt; Thanks, Lynne.

&gt; Here are some examples from Looney's Appendix of what I referred to as
&gt;&quot;technical detail&quot;:

&gt; ...we have already had occasion to draw attention to the blank verse of
&gt; the first important piece of dialogue in the play: that between
&gt; Prospero and Miranda in which the former is relating the story of his
&gt; misfortunes. A minute inspection of this discloses the fact that much
&gt; of it is not verse at all in the true sense, but merely prose,
&gt; artificially cut up into short strips: precisely as, in an earlier
&gt; chapter, we saw was actually done in &quot;Coriolanus.&quot; Versification, which
&gt; is fundamentally the breaking up of utterances into short pieces, or
&gt; lines, according to some rule, always implies that, in a general way,
&gt; the pause, formed by the end of the line corresponds to a pause,
&gt; however slight, in the spoken utterance; the exceptions to this only
&gt; serving to emphasize the rule. When the connection between the last
&gt; word of one line and the first word of the next is too close, and such
&gt; connections become too frequent, the sense of versification is lost and
&gt; it becomes merely dismembered prose.

&gt; Take then the two first lines of this dialogue:

&gt;&quot;If by your art, my dearest father, you have
&gt; Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.&quot;

&gt; Now, it is hardly possible to get two words more closely connected in
&gt; spoken utterances than a Principal and an Auxiliary Verb, when no
&gt; adverb comes between them, as in the case of this, verb, &quot;have put.&quot;
&gt; Nor is this the only example of its kind. Broken up in precisely the
&gt; same way we have the verb,

&gt;&quot;had Burnt&quot; (III. 1.); &quot;will Revenge&quot; (III. 2.);
&gt;&quot;have Incensed&quot; (III. 3.); &quot;have Been&quot; (V. 1.);
&gt;&quot;have Received&quot; (V. 1.); &quot;must Take&quot; (V. 1.)

&gt; Taking &quot;Hamlet&quot; as our standard for measuring Shakespeare's style of
&gt; versification, we do not find a single example of this defect in the
&gt; great masterpiece.

&gt; Continuing our examination of this dialogue, we find, a few lines
&gt; further on, this, passage:

&gt;&quot;It should the good ship so have swallow'd, and
&gt; The fraughting souls within her.&quot;

&gt; [449] This &quot;and&quot; at the end of lines in &quot;The Tempest&quot; is quite a
&gt; feature of its author's style. We pointed it out in the passage &quot;and
&gt; Are melted into air.&quot; We find it repeated three times in this short
&gt; dialogue:

&gt;&quot;and A prince of power;&quot;
&gt;&quot;and She said;&quot;

&gt; the third being in the above quotation.

&gt; In exactly the same way we have:

&gt;&quot;and My strong imagination&quot; (II. 1.)
&gt;&quot;and I'll seek&quot; (III. 3.)
&gt;&quot;and Harmonious charmingly&quot; (IV. 1.)

&gt; Again, not once does this defect appear in &quot;Hamlet.&quot;

&gt; We have also instances of the conjunction &quot;but&quot; placed at the end of
&gt; lines

&gt;&quot;but For every trifle&quot; (II. 2.)
&gt;&quot;but The mistress&quot; (III. 1.)
&gt;&quot;but If thou dost break&quot; (IV. 1.)

&gt; Nor does this defect once appear in &quot;Hamlet.&quot;

&gt; Examples also occur of lines ending in other Conjunctions, to which may
&gt; be added Conjunctive Pronouns and Conjunctive Adverbs:

&gt;&quot;who Art ignorant&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&quot;that Hath kept with thy remembrance&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&quot;who To trash for over topping&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&quot;that A noble Neapolitan&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&quot;that I prize&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&quot;for He's gentle&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&quot;whom We all were&quot; (II. 1.)
&gt;&quot;that We say befits&quot; (II. 1.)
&gt;&quot;which Lie tumbling&quot; (II. 2.)

&gt; And so it continues on to end of the play. Yet never once does this
&gt; form of intimate connection between the end of one line and the
&gt; beginning of the next appear in &quot;Hamlet.&quot; How it is possible to hold,
&gt; in face of a comparison of this kind, that the versification of both
&gt; plays came from the same pen, is most difficult to understand.

&gt; ***
&gt; I don't know what to make of it - but the difference in &quot;technical
&gt; detail&quot; between it and 'Hamlet' strikes me as too great to be
&gt; accidental if one accepts that the same mind authored the two plays.

&gt; If the mind was that of Edward Oxenford, some two decades would have
&gt; passed between the time of writing and the text's publication in the
&gt; First Folio.

&gt; Considering the (apparent) editorial decisions whereby parts of key
&gt; passages in Hamlet - (Horatio's comments on &quot;the mightiest Julius&quot; in
&gt; Act I, Sc. i and Hamlet's comments on &quot;This heavy-headed revel east and
&gt; west&quot; in Act I, Sc. v) - were left out of the First Folio despite their
&gt; having been in the 1611 version, one would have expected the editor(s)
&gt; of the First Folio to have felt no compunction in ironing out the
&gt; difference in &quot;technical detail&quot; if, for some reason, it had been
&gt; present in the play's text as left by Oxenford.

&gt; Yet the editor(s) didn't do so.

&gt; In the circumstances, this would seem to imply

I have the book, Gangly. Actually, I have two copies: a new one from
the late Ruth Miller, sent very kindly, just before she died, and a
first edition that I bought for my husband one Christmas, which cost me
hundreds. One of my dogs has chewed the spine off it-- a true case of
&quot;Eat, bark, moan, and inwardly digest.&quot;

I don't feel that Looney did a really scientific job of comparing
Tempest to the other plays. Most of his examples appear to come from
Hamlet, and I think Hamlet may have been much, much earlier than
Tempest. We would need to see Tempest compared to *every other play* in
the canon, and to recognise it was constructed very differently, with
very different grammatical structure, to be confident that it wasn't
written by Shakespeare. With my limited experience (but extremely good
ear, most of the time), I am certain it was, in the main, by
Shakespeare, although there are one or two loose ends which suggest to
me we may not have it either in its entirety or totally untampered
with.

The quoted passage suggests that Mr. Looney wasn't very familiar with
English verse technique or with Shakespeare. He seems to think that
enjambment is some kind of terrible defect, whereas it is a common
feature of blank verse, one that Shakespeare employed with increasing
frequency as he grew older.

The formatting on this post is all balled up so I'll

in Demant's defense of Looney and Looney's Shakespeare

I think the standards of literary scholarship were much
less defined in that era, I think Looney's editors didn't
take a close look at his manuscript. The responsibility
is with Oxfordians, many of them qualified scholars, who
work in an era with a higher set of standards.

Looney selected the lines that make Oxford look
like Shakespeare while he omitted the lines which,
taken with the letter written in 1601, show that Oxford
caught Cecil in a lie and that Oxford doesn't know his
way around the law of escheat.

The law of escheat was settled law. Shakespeare knew
escheat and, not coincidently, it comes into the plays
at the same time the widows who, under law, lost their
entire dower shares after their husbands (a hundred
and forty of them were executed by Elizabeth), took their
hopeless suits to court. Bacon had to represent the Queen
in these gut-wrenching suits so it is no wonder that he
added &quot;dower&quot; to &quot;life and liberty&quot; as a due right in his
brief for Calvin's Case.

Here's one of Oxford's lines that Looney excised:

The Lord Chiefe Iustice yet sumthinge he hathe done
owt of his owne brest that ys secret and i cannot lerne,
yf he have reported nothinge to eschete to her magestie.

If Oxford were Shakespeare he wouldn't be asking Cecil
why the Queen did not receive Danvers' escheat. There
was no way under law that she could not receive it. When
was Hamlet written? If Oxford is still asking questions about
escheat in 1602, Oxford is not the author of Hamlet.

Again, I'm not picking on Looney. Looney wrote a popular
book. Looney did not misrepresent his qualifications. What
I don't understand is why Oxfordianism, which has so many
qualified schoolars, so uncritically accepts the proofs of
of unqualified scholars like Looney and the Ogburns.

Correction:

The law of escheat was settled law. Shakespeare knew
escheat and, not coincidently, it comes into the plays
at the same time the widows who, under law, lost their
entire dower shares after their husbands (a hundred
and forty of them) were executed by Elizabeth, These
widows took their hopeless suits to court (law could
be made through common law trials, the object would
be to make the law of escheat in regard to treason
consistent with the law of escheat in regard to
felony in which widows could keep their share of the
estate and the heirs could inherit that share).

Bacon had to represent the Queen in these gut-wrenching
suits so it is no wonder that he added &quot;dower&quot; to &quot;life and
liberty&quot; as a due right in his brief for Calvin's Case.

Indeed. In fact it is interesting to do a quick count of lines
where Shakespeare has used 'and' or 'but' as the first part of
an enjambment. If one does, one can almost say precisely when
he started to make use of them. Using Gary Taylor's dates, it
comes out like this for the 'last' 12 plays:

AWEW (1604/5) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
Tim (1605) 'and' (0) 'but' (0)
KL (1605/6) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
Mac (1606) 'and' (2) 'but' (1)
A&amp;C (1606) 'and' (5) 'but' (5)
Per (1607) 'and' (4) 'but' (0)
Cor (1608) 'and' (15) 'but' (4)
WT (1609) 'and' (8) 'but' (5)
Cym (1610) 'and' (7) 'but' (8)
Tem (1611) 'and' (7) 'but' (4)
H8 (1613) 'and' (9) 'but' (3)
2NK (1613/4) 'and' (8) 'but' (1)

On the other hand I can find *not one* example in any play by
Shakespeare which Taylor has given an earlier date than these.
Paul will no doubt explain why Cymbeline is nevertheless one
of Shakespeare's earlier plays.

&gt; escheat in 1602, Oxford is not the author of Hamlet.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, I was silent till I had a chance to look at the book rather than

&gt;&gt;&gt; of &quot;one passage,&quot;

&gt;&gt; Looney created one passage out of the pieces left
&gt;&gt; over after he chopped two passages from Oxford's
&gt;&gt; letter but retained the lines that come before, between
&gt;&gt; and after.

&gt;&gt; The MLA is not going to give that a pass.

&gt; Nor would any respectable historian.

&gt;&gt;&gt; so it's acceptable too that he doesn't quote the
&gt;&gt;&gt; entire letter.

&gt;&gt; Looney doesn't inform his reader.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What he's obviously missed is the ellipses.

&gt;&gt; The ellipses at the end of this line?

&gt;&gt; (T)hys sut I obteyned by yowre espetiall meanes, and

&gt;&gt; Looney must have seen the whole letter since he cites
&gt;&gt; the Hatfield MSS, not a printed source. That means
&gt;&gt; there's more missing than than we knew.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Since he
&gt;&gt;&gt; puts them in other passages . . .

&gt;&gt; With annotations?

&gt;&gt;&gt; and since their omission doesn't change or
&gt;&gt;&gt; strengthen the case in any way . . .

Well, Neil, you could check through the whole book and let us know. And
then I'll check through a &quot;Stratfordian&quot; book. I have one in mind. And
I've certainly checked through all the traditional work on The Tempest,
and have seen, if not creative editing, extremely creative ideas that
twist the original texts.

No one should uncritically accept anything, whether it's written by
Looney or Ogburn or anyone else. But the truth is that one is more
likely, psychologically, to agree with that which fits one's own
perspective and ideas, whether one is Oxfordian, Baconian, or
&quot;Stratfordian.&quot; I have tried hard to fight this bias, although it's
extremely difficult. How hard have you tried?

&gt; The quoted passage suggests that Mr. Looney wasn't very familiar with

I'm actually not sure he's talking about enjambement as opposed to
end-stopped, Tom. Rather a more fuzzy concept about &quot;closely related
words&quot; such as different parts of a verb phrase or clauses after
conjunctions beginning lines. He feels, for some reason, that these
separations wouldn't occur if the writer were Shakespeare. I would say
that appreciation of verse technique certainly wasn't Looney's strong
point.

I agree with you that Shakespeare employed enjambement more and more
often as he grew older--this is one of the ways we can tell the later
from the earlier works--and I see it as freeing the verse from earlier
constraints--in other words, a very desirable change.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks, Lynne.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Here are some examples from Looney's Appendix of what I referred to as
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;technical detail&quot;:

&gt;&gt;&gt; ...we have already had occasion to draw attention to the blank verse of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the first important piece of dialogue in the play: that between
&gt;&gt;&gt; Prospero and Miranda in which the former is relating the story of his
&gt;&gt;&gt; misfortunes. A minute inspection of this discloses the fact that much
&gt;&gt;&gt; of it is not verse at all in the true sense, but merely prose,
&gt;&gt;&gt; artificially cut up into short strips: precisely as, in an earlier
&gt;&gt;&gt; chapter, we saw was actually done in &quot;Coriolanus.&quot; Versification, which
&gt;&gt;&gt; is fundamentally the breaking up of utterances into short pieces, or
&gt;&gt;&gt; lines, according to some rule, always implies that, in a general way,
&gt;&gt;&gt; the pause, formed by the end of the line corresponds to a pause,
&gt;&gt;&gt; however slight, in the spoken utterance; the exceptions to this only
&gt;&gt;&gt; serving to emphasize the rule. When the connection between the last
&gt;&gt;&gt; word of one line and the first word of the next is too close, and such
&gt;&gt;&gt; connections become too frequent, the sense of versification is lost and
&gt;&gt;&gt; it becomes merely dismembered prose.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Take then the two first lines of this dialogue:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;If by your art, my dearest father, you have
&gt;&gt;&gt; Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Now, it is hardly possible to get two words more closely connected in
&gt;&gt;&gt; spoken utterances than a Principal and an Auxiliary Verb, when no
&gt;&gt;&gt; adverb comes between them, as in the case of this, verb, &quot;have put.&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Nor is this the only example of its kind. Broken up in precisely the
&gt;&gt;&gt; same way we have the verb,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;had Burnt&quot; (III. 1.); &quot;will Revenge&quot; (III. 2.);
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;have Incensed&quot; (III. 3.); &quot;have Been&quot; (V. 1.);
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;have Received&quot; (V. 1.); &quot;must Take&quot; (V. 1.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Taking &quot;Hamlet&quot; as our standard for measuring Shakespeare's style of
&gt;&gt;&gt; versification, we do not find a single example of this defect in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; great masterpiece.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Continuing our examination of this dialogue, we find, a few lines
&gt;&gt;&gt; further on, this, passage:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;It should the good ship so have swallow'd, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; The fraughting souls within her.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; [449] This &quot;and&quot; at the end of lines in &quot;The Tempest&quot; is quite a
&gt;&gt;&gt; feature of its author's style. We pointed it out in the passage &quot;and
&gt;&gt;&gt; Are melted into air.&quot; We find it repeated three times in this short
&gt;&gt;&gt; dialogue:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;and A prince of power;&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;and She said;&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; the third being in the above quotation.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In exactly the same way we have:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;and My strong imagination&quot; (II. 1.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;and I'll seek&quot; (III. 3.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;and Harmonious charmingly&quot; (IV. 1.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Again, not once does this defect appear in &quot;Hamlet.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; We have also instances of the conjunction &quot;but&quot; placed at the end of
&gt;&gt;&gt; lines

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;but For every trifle&quot; (II. 2.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;but The mistress&quot; (III. 1.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;but If thou dost break&quot; (IV. 1.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nor does this defect once appear in &quot;Hamlet.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt; Examples also occur of lines ending in other Conjunctions, to which may
&gt;&gt;&gt; be added Conjunctive Pronouns and Conjunctive Adverbs:

&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;who Art ignorant&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;that Hath kept with thy remembrance&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;who To trash for over topping&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;that A noble Neapolitan&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;that I prize&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;for He's gentle&quot; (1. 2.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;whom We all were&quot; (II. 1.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;that We say befits&quot; (II. 1.)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;which Lie tumbling&quot; (II. 2.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; And so it continues on to end of the play. Yet never once does this
&gt;&gt;&gt; form of intimate connection between the end of one line and the
&gt;&gt;&gt; beginning of the next appear in &quot;Hamlet.&quot; How it is possible to hold,
&gt;&gt;&gt; in face of a comparison of this kind, that the versification of both
&gt;&gt;&gt; plays came from the same pen, is most difficult to understand.

&gt;&gt;&gt; ***
&gt;&gt;&gt; I don't know what to make of it - but the difference in &quot;technical
&gt;&gt;&gt; detail&quot; between it and 'Hamlet' strikes me as too great to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; accidental if one accepts that the same mind authored the two plays.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the mind was that of Edward Oxenford, some two decades would have
&gt;&gt;&gt; passed between the time of writing and the text's publication in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; First Folio.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Considering the (apparent) editorial decisions whereby parts of key
&gt;&gt;&gt; passages in Hamlet - (Horatio's comments on &quot;the mightiest Julius&quot; in
&gt;&gt;&gt; Act I, Sc. i and Hamlet's comments on &quot;This heavy-headed revel east and
&gt;&gt;&gt; west&quot; in Act I, Sc. v) - were left out of the First Folio despite their
&gt;&gt;&gt; having been in the 1611 version, one would have expected the editor(s)
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the First Folio to have felt no compunction in ironing out the
&gt;&gt;&gt; difference in &quot;technical detail&quot; if, for some reason, it had been
&gt;&gt;&gt; present in the play's text as left by Oxenford.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet the editor(s) didn't do so.

&gt;&gt;&gt; In the circumstances, this would seem to imply

&gt;&gt;&gt; (a) that Oxenford was not the author, or

&gt;&gt;&gt; (b) that the editor(s) didn't do a proper job.

&gt;&gt; I have the book, Gangly. Actually, I have two copies: a new one from
&gt;&gt; the late Ruth Miller, sent very kindly, just before she died, and a
&gt;&gt; first edition that I bought for my husband one Christmas, which cost me
&gt;&gt; hundreds. One of my dogs has chewed the spine off it-- a true case of
&gt;&gt;&quot;Eat, bark, moan, and inwardly digest.&quot;

&gt;&gt; I don't feel that Looney did a really scientific job of comparing
&gt;&gt; Tempest to the other plays. Most of his examples appear to come from
&gt;&gt; Hamlet, and I think Hamlet may have been much, much earlier than
&gt;&gt; Tempest. We would need to see Tempest compared to *every other play* in
&gt;&gt; the canon, and to recognise it was constructed very differently, with
&gt;&gt; very different grammatical structure, to be confident that it wasn't
&gt;&gt; written by Shakespeare. With my limited experience (but extremely good
&gt;&gt; ear, most of the time), I am certain it was, in the main, by
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare, although there are one or two loose ends which suggest to
&gt;&gt; me we may not have it either in its entirety or totally untampered
&gt;&gt; with.

Lynne:

I found Peter Farey's information -

Indeed. In fact it is interesting to do a quick count of lines
where Shakespeare has used 'and' or 'but' as the first part of
an enjambment. If one does, one can almost say precisely when
he started to make use of them. Using Gary Taylor's dates, it
comes out like this for the 'last' 12 plays:

AWEW (1604/5) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
Tim (1605) 'and' (0) 'but' (0)
KL (1605/6) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
Mac (1606) 'and' (2) 'but' (1)
A&amp;C (1606) 'and' (5) 'but' (5)
Per (1607) 'and' (4) 'but' (0)
Cor (1608) 'and' (15) 'but' (4)
WT (1609) 'and' (8) 'but' (5)
Cym (1610) 'and' (7) 'but' (8)
Tem (1611) 'and' (7) 'but' (4)
H8 (1613) 'and' (9) 'but' (3)
2NK (1613/4) 'and' (8) 'but' (1)

- very interesting.

While the dating of the plays may be disputed, the fact that it was
done without regard to the point at issue (&quot;ands&quot; and &quot;buts&quot; etc.)
suggests that there was indeed a break in the author's style at some
point - around 1604 if the dating is accepted as roughly valid.

It would be interesting - and possibly helpful in the context of the
Authorship Issue - to check how known examples of the Earl of Oxford's
writings compare with the pre- and post-1604 pattern of &quot;ands&quot; and
&quot;buts&quot; in the Shakespeare plays.

I'm not sure what the point of that would be. For example,
Marlowe never used 'and' and 'but' in this way, and I would
have been very surprised if he had, given how much earlier than
this he was writing.

The point is, of course, that this adds enormous support to
the accuracy of Taylor's dating (together with that of every
other Shakespearean scholar who has come up with such a list)
and knocks a huge hole in any theory involving someone who is
presumed (without good reason to think otherwise) to have died
before 1605.

There is little good reason to believe that Oxford died before
1605; in fact the ONLY TWO sources we have for this DISAGREE
TOTALLY with each other on exactly where Oxford was buried!!!

Lord Oxford's earlier works were published
under the names E.O., L.O. &amp; MAR-L.O.

The MELIFLUOUS Earl then went to live on the isle of MELITA
where his ancestors were all noble Knights of St. Malta.
(and where an earlier &quot;I am that I am&quot; man was shipwrecked).

have been very surprised if he had, given how much earlier than
this he was writing.

Comment:

Thanks for this additional information.

As for &quot;what the point would be&quot;, let me list a few.

1. If Marlowe was the &quot;real&quot; Shakespeare, the fact that he &quot;never used
'and' and 'but' in this way&quot; would imply a marked stylistic change in
his writing some 10-15 years after his official &quot;death&quot;.

2. If Oxenford's writing style is judged to mirror that of Marlowe
(which I believe to have been a pseudo-historical figure on par with
the Stratfordian) then that would remove one objection to the
hypothesis that &quot;Marlowe&quot; was one of Oxenford's pen names.

3. If the post-1604 &quot;Shakespeare&quot; material reflects editorial work by
some third party or parties on pre-existing plays, then that might
account for the marked stylistic change.

4. If the stylistic change is *not* evident in the Sonnets (1609),
then that would seem to imply one of two things: (i) that they were
written before 1604 or thereabouts or, if they were completed after
1604, (ii) that &quot;Shakespeare&quot; continued to use his pre-1604 writing
style in the Sonnets while adopting a different style in the following
plays:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; AWEW (1604/5) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
&gt; KL (1605/6) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
&gt; Mac (1606) 'and' (2) 'but' (1)
&gt; A&amp;C (1606) 'and' (5) 'but' (5)
&gt; Per (1607) 'and' (4) 'but' (0)
&gt; Cor (1608) 'and' (15) 'but' (4)

"/>

5. If the Sonnets are judged to have been written - or finalized -
after 1604, then absence therein of analogous stylistic changes would
present problems for the Stratfordian theory of the case - the theory
that the Stratfordian's writing style changed markedly after 1604.

[discussion concerning an increasing use of enjambement in later Shakespeare
plays]

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 3. If the post-1604 &quot;Shakespeare&quot; material reflects editorial work by
&gt; some third party or parties on pre-existing plays, then that might
&gt; account for the marked stylistic change.

"/>

The change doesn't involve simply the &quot;and&quot; and &quot;but&quot; usage - that's the
most extreme form of enjambement, and the one that's fairly easy to reduce
to figures. There is a general tendency in the &quot;late&quot; period, if the
generally accepted dates are valid, for the verse to become rhythmically
&quot;looser&quot;: more like intensely heightened prose in varied phrase lengths. The
sentence structures are also often more intricate, sometimes even tortuous,
though for that very reason - as delivered by a skilled actor - powerfully
expressive of emotion. I don't see how an editor could produce this style
from a copy text in more formal and largely end-stopped verse.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; 4. If the stylistic change is *not* evident in the Sonnets (1609),
&gt; then that would seem to imply one of two things: (i) that they were
&gt; written before 1604 or thereabouts or, if they were completed after
&gt; 1604, (ii) that &quot;Shakespeare&quot; continued to use his pre-1604 writing
&gt; style in the Sonnets while adopting a different style in the following
&gt; plays:

&gt;&gt; AWEW (1604/5) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt; KL (1605/6) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt; Mac (1606) 'and' (2) 'but' (1)
&gt;&gt; A&amp;C (1606) 'and' (5) 'but' (5)
&gt;&gt; Per (1607) 'and' (4) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt; Cor (1608) 'and' (15) 'but' (4)

&gt; 5. If the Sonnets are judged to have been written - or finalized -
&gt; after 1604, then absence therein of analogous stylistic changes would
&gt; present problems for the Stratfordian theory of the case - the theory
&gt; that the Stratfordian's writing style changed markedly after 1604.

"/>

There's no particular reason why lyric verse, intended for the reader of the
written or printed page, should follow a similar pattern to dramatic verse,
intended for a theatre audience. But many of the Sonnets present verbal
intricacy as challenging as that of the &quot;big&quot; speeches in the late plays,
even if the rhythmic patterning is tighter (perhaps related to the
requirements of the fixed rhyme scheme).

Comment:

Thanks for very enlightening comments on these complex issues.

With respect to Looney's comments on the stylistic differences between
Hamlet and The Tempest, I would have expected that salient aspects of
post-1604 stylistic patterns would be apparent to the trained eye in
the First Folio version of Hamlet - and, for that matter, also in
Macbeth and Julius Caesar.

I would be interested in any comments you may have on this point.

Gunnar,

The &quot;and&quot; pauses are the habit of an orator as well as an
actor (Bacon was both). An orator has to have pregnant pauses
or the audience will not hang on every word.

As in most of his essays, Bacon (like the author of The Tempest),
starts off with a prose introduction, then goes into something
between oration and verse. Note the absence of pauses in the
prose intro:

OF GREAT PLACE

Men in great place are thrice servants: servants of the sovereign
or state; servants of fame; and servants of business. So as they
have no freedom; neither in their persons, nor in their actions,
nor in their times. It is a strange desire, to seek power and to
lose
liberty: or to seek power over others, and to lose power over a
man's self.

Here's the first line of the body of the essay arranged
as a verse.

The rising unto place is laborious; and
By pains, men come to greater pains; and
It is sometimes base; and
By indignities, men come to dignities.

or

The rising unto place is laborious;
And by pains, men come to greater pains;
And it is sometimes base;
And by indignities, men come to dignities.

In his article defending Edward Bysshe's theory of meter,
Groves says that some one-syllable words get the spoken
length of words with two short syllables. The word &quot;and&quot;
appears to be one of those words.

Bacon frames the first two &quot;and&quot; lines with drawn out
&quot;pains&quot; and &quot;base&quot; and then puts &quot;dignities&quot; with
three quick syllables at the end. Very effective. One
would almost think Bacon was a poet.

Bacon's line in the original punctuation:

The rising unto place is laborious; and by pains, men come to
greater pains; and it is sometimes base; and by indignities, men
come to dignities.

Re.

Comment:

I have often wondered what Shelley saw in Bacon -

&quot;Lord Bacon was a poet. His language has a sweet and majestic rhythm
which satisfies the sense, no less than the almost superhuman wisdom of
his philosophy satisfies the intellect; it is a strain which distends
and then bursts the circumference of the reader's mind and pours itself
forth together with it into the universal element with which it has
perpetual sympathy.&quot;

- which Bacon's detractors seem to have missed.

And whether John Aubrey's comment more than a century earlier -

&quot;His Lordship was a good Poet, but conceal'd...&quot;

- may have some bearing on the Shakespeare Authorship Issue.

Gunnar,

Rawley was referring to the foundations
of scientific philosopy, not the foundations
of crankery.

There is a single piece of evidence, if you
want to call it that, stuck on the front of
one of Bacon's treatises reprinted in the 1660s,
long after his death. It was not put there
by Bacon, nor his executors but by some printer
who probably wanted some decoration on the front
of his piracy.

I don't know what the symbol is but it could be a
compass or something like that which of course those
dedicated to the promulgation of crankery will
turn into a conpiracy.

That's all there is. There is no evidence that
Bacon had anything to do with masonry -- there
wasn't any until Milton and Newton -- nor would
he.

Elizabeth

My difference of opinion with Oxfordians is that they
seem to take an emotional approach to the authorship
question which I see as a problem in forensics.

Imagine that The Tempest is a crime scene. Some would-be
author or authors-- Bacon, Marlowe, Oxford, the playbroker,
Neville, Derby -- have stolen the play. The only way to
determine which suspect is the true author of the Shakespeare
works and which are guilty of theft is to apply the usual
procedures. Investigate the crime scene, collect the physical
evidence, question the witnesses, try to reconstruct the crime,
obtain warrants and search the houses of the suspects for evidence,
question their friends and relatives, take the suspects in for
questioning and try to break their stories. I've run out of
analogies.

&gt; Indeed. In fact it is interesting to do a quick count of lines

&gt; an enjambment. If one does, one can almost say precisely when
&gt; he started to make use of them. Using Gary Taylor's dates, it

&gt; AWEW (1604/5) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)

The man was clearly a machine, who had
no idea what a run-on line was, nor a
feminine ending, nor even -- probably-- a
rhyme. He had no education, so no one
ever told him what these things were.
He did it all naturally. He no more
thought about what he was doing than
we think about breathing.

That's why it makes sense to analyse his
work in this way. Of course we could
never apply this kind of principle to
ANY other writer of ANY other era.
And we don't -- ever.

We would not dream of subjecting the
work of the truly great writers of today --
such as Peter Farey or Lynne Kositsky.
to such a study. Unlike the ignorant
Stratman, who could not possibly have
known what he was doing, these supreme
stylists are intensely conscious of how
they use words and would never dream
producing work that would allowing the
application of such a crude measure.

Oops, I forgot. As it happens neither of
these 'greats' believe that the Stratman
was author of the works -- but, ah well,
it makes no difference. Stratfordian
rules pulled from the depths of the Strat
'thinking' will always appeal to them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; On the other hand I can find *not one* example in any play by

How do you relate the following comments from the 'Manes Verulamiani'
to your thesis that Francis Bacon was not - could not possibly be -
Crank Master par excellence?

C.D. of King's College wrote:

&quot;Filled is the world with thy writings.&quot;

R.C. of Trinity College wrote:

&quot;Thou art the jewel most precious of letters concealed.&quot;

Or how does Ben Jonson's poem 'On Lord Bacon's Sixtieth Birthday'
square with your hypothesis - especially the opening four lines:

Hail, happy genius of this ancient pile!
How comes it all things so about thee smile?
The fire, the wine, the men! and in the midst
Thou stand'st as if some mystery thou didst!

[Note: In Pythagorean number symbolism, the Sixtieth Birthday is
viewed as some sort of milestone in Man's Spiritual evolution.]

Finally, in the Dedication of his 'Epigrammes', which Ben Jonson
described as the &quot;ripest of [his] studies&quot;, he distinguished between
two period's in his own life, with that &quot;ripest of [his] studies&quot; being
a product of the first period -

&quot;For when I made them I had nothing in my conscience to expressing of
which I did need a CIPHER.&quot;

Might Ben have served his apprenticeship with the Master of Crankery -
Francis Bacon as &quot;one of the fathers of Salomon's House&quot;, who gave the
story-teller private lessons in something - &quot;scientific philosophy&quot; to
you, &quot;crankery&quot; to me - stating at the outset:

&quot;God bless thee, my son; I will give thee the GREATEST JEWEL I have.
For I will impart unto thee, for the love of God and men, a RELATION*
of the true state of Salomon's House.&quot;

That's &quot;greatest jewel&quot; as in &quot;Thou art the jewel most precious of
letters concealed.&quot;

And taking leave of the apprentice at instruction's end with the words:

&quot;God bless thee, my son, and God bless this RELATION* which I have
made. I give thee leave to publish it [CIPHER reference in Ben
Jonson's Dedication of the Epigrams?], for the good of other nations;
for we here are in God's bosom, a land unknown.&quot;

Might that be &quot;a land unknown&quot; as in Abraham Cowley's 'Ode to the Royal
Society'?

Bacon, like Moses, led us forth at last,
The barren wilderness he past,
Did on the very border stand
Of the blest promis'd land
And from the mountain's top of his exalted wit,
Saw it himself, and shew'd us it.

Bacon had no money, no office. England was
a very poor nation with a very small bureaucracy
that operated on corruption. Bacon had no money
to buy an office. He finally got an office but
only by dedicating The Advancement of Knowledge
to James I.

England's wealth was concentrated in the aristocracy.
A schoolmaster with a unversity MA made ten pounds a year,
Oxford inherited the wealth of seventeen earls but Oxford
was indigent compared to the Percys and Howards.

When Bacon was waiting twenty-five years for an office,
he had to turn to seeking patronage from his aristocratic
friends and relatives. They did not want scientific
treatises on the tides. They wanted plays and poems
with dedications that made them look good.

Bacon could not put his name on his own works
or sell them without ruining his chances for office
(his father was evicted from Court for two years
for printing a book on law under the name of his
law clerk -- which was not only a huge financial
setback, it nearly destroyed his career).

The Puritan Lord Burghley wrote a treatise against
young men writing poetry. Plays were unthinkable to
Burghley but the aristocracy wanted plays.

Literary works were valuable only to printers
and the thieving brokers who sold stolen manuscripts
for a few pounds (this is Green's gripe in Groatsworth
-- the Crow is a playbroker who pretends to have
written the plays he's only fenced).

The Venus and Adonis went through seventeen
editions and made its printer rich but the
author didn't get a penny from the printer
(Southampton was generous).

Lady Anne Bacon's letters document the fact that
Bacon went hundry. She rushes pigeon pies to his
lodging (Athony gets the dove pies because Bacon
was only &quot;her ward not her son&quot;). Bacon had permanent
lodgings at Gray's Inn inherited from his father
but no cash.

If Bacon was the center of some influential
cabal he would not have missed meals or been thrown
into debtors prison or had to borrow from his
mother and brother. In order to call Bacon a
conpirator you have to make the poverty of
twenty-five years of his life a ruse.

Oxford, a product of aristocratic narcissism
(scientists have found that inbreeding really
does produce selfish genes) could not have
written the Shakespeare works because Oxford's
record shows the narrowness of his concerns. Oxford
had economic security -- the Queen protected
his estate from debtors -- James I did the same
for Bacon after his &quot;fall: --while the stiped
suplimented his income. One of his biographers
writes that the Countess would hide the chattel
when the creditors pounded on the door.

Oxford's obsessions don't change over the decades.
He's writing the same letter in 1602 that he wrote
in the 1570s. He wants money, he wants Burghley,
Cecil or the Queen to help him. That's the scope
of Oxford's interests.

Oxford's title gave his life great stability,
there was only so much his enemies could do to
him. Bacon had none of that security, his life,
after the end of his childhood, was rocked with
one crisis after another and those crises start
to show up in the plays after 1598.

&gt; R.C. of Trinity College wrote:

Bacon wasn't exactly concealed, there was a
law that allowed a writer to sue if he used a pseudonym
and someone outed him. Bacon wrote anonymously and
the aristracy had no motive to expose his authorship.
His competition did out him and Whitgift came along
behind and burned their works. Cockburn has done
about thirty pages on Certain Satyres and the Vergidemiarum
which identify Bacon as the author of the Faerie Queene,
Tamerlaine and the Shakespeare works. Hall and Marsten
even make a classial allusion to the Stratford playbroker
who &quot;drinkes from Bacon's bole&quot; a reference to one
of the classical playwrights who wrote behind a mask.

Bacon didn't need a cipher. He later came up
with the precursor to the genetic code (and the
binary code pirated and coverted to numbers by
Leibniz who just happened to work as a secretary
for the dedicatee of the Cryptographia Cryptomenytices
-- what are the odds) in his abcderium theory.

Bacon was a grammarian who believed that man
had to retrieve the &quot;alphabet of nature,&quot; which
had been lost in the Fall from Eden (Bacon was a
Christian to the bone). Bacon essentially described
what Crick would eventually see after Crick took a
a hit of LSD. The ABCDerium. Bacon rejected math-
based science and rightly warned against it.

Eric McLuhan of the University of Toronto has written
on Bacon's grammatical theory of nature (it's not
crankery, it's Christian Renaissance science).

That's a metaphor from The New Atlantis. There wasn't

Someone at Cambridge probably saw The New Atlantis
in circulation, a manuscript that Bacon espressly forbid
Rawley to publish. Utopian literature is dangerous,
Bacon knew it, we've lost hundreds of Bacon's manuscripts--
-- but manuscripts written for the COMMENTARY ONLY of
other scholars have gotten out. Bacon didn't write in
solitary, he circulated his drafts.

There are many references to Bacon
as a concealed poet. He calls himself a
concealed poet. It would be nice if the Baconians
would get this stuff together but at this time
it's scattered all over the place so you can't
get the full impact of it.

"/>

No. The English were not ready for that kind of
esoterica in Bacon's lifetime. Bacon was the 'greatest
cipherer of his generation' but it was turned to the
defense of England, not hocus pocus. One of Bacon's
ciphers was in military use up to WWII when better
ciphers were invented.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Might that be &quot;a land unknown&quot; as in Abraham Cowley's 'Ode to the Royal
&gt; Society'?

"/>

ABSOLUTELY NOT.

Bacon was a Christian from birth to death.
Due to the lingering influence of English Catholicism
(much milder and more liberal than Italian or
Spanish Catholicism) Bacon is always trying to
mediate between the Henrician Catholicism of
his father and the ultra Calvinism of his mother.
That mediation is the essence of the Shakespeare
plays.

The Shakespeare plays are Christian works
written over the Geneva Study Bible. Whole
plots are taken from chapters of the Bible.

The &quot;undiscovered&quot; plot for The Tempest is
Isaih xxix. Scholars have noticed this and it
fits every line. A believer wrote the Shakespeare
works which are suffused with religious thought and
morality.

Oxford, a Catholic, did not write them. Oxford
could not crack the cover of a bible without
calling down papal anathema. I noted in another
post that he reciprocated Anne Cecil's gift of
the Folger Bible with Erasmus' Catholic New Testament.

Anne Cecil is the best candidate for the annotations
in the Folger Bible (&quot;Shakespeare's bible&quot; so-called)
since the hand is small and juvenile and the marginalia
very tentative. Cecil was a knowledgeable Calvinist at
fourteen.

There's not the slightest hint of the bible in Oxford's
letters and poems. Bacon's letters and treatises
are as crammed with biblical references as the Shakespeare
plays.

Terrific, Elizabeth. You appear to have made an airtight case that
only Bacon, the Freemason in embryo, could have written the canon of
Shakespeare plays. But he cannot possibly have written what we have

Your idea was anticipated by J. C. Squire in 1931
( ). In this
alternate history tale, conclusive evidence is discovered that Bacon
wrote the works of Shakespeare. That raises the question of how one man
could have produced two utterly different oeuvres, which is resolved
when scholars recognize that Shakespeare was the real Bacon.

The new science of induction which was born from philosophy and law.

Comment:

There is no &quot;science of induction&quot;.

As for Bacon's views on the method of &quot;induction&quot;, a modern student of
Bacon's thought has commented as follows:

&quot;At the beginning of the _Novum Organum_, Bacon declared that two kinds
of induction exist, both starting out &quot;from the senses and particulars&quot;
and both ending in &quot;the highest generalities&quot;. He called one of these
methods the &quot;anticipation of nature&quot;, the other the &quot;interpretation of
nature&quot;. The first, in Bacon's view, was responsible for what he saw
as the sterile and unproductive character of much contemporary science,
while he argued for the second as the right procedure to adopt if
science was to make any substantial and more rapid advance.&quot; (Peter
Urbach, 'Francis Bacon's Philosophy of Science', Open Court, 1987, p.
25)

Which of these two methods of &quot;induction&quot; represent what you construe
as &quot;these Foundations&quot; in Dr. Rawley's prefatory comments on 'Manes
Verulamiani'?

&quot;Let if suffice to lay these Foundations in the name of the present
age; every age will enlarge and adorn this Edifice; but to what Age is
given to set the finishing hand is manifest only to God and to the
Fates.&quot;

P.S. Your construction of Rawley's statement implies that the EDIFICE
in question is the METHOD of Induction - a construction which strikes
me as unpersuasive.

&gt; ________________________________________

&gt; Gunnar,

&gt; The &quot;and&quot; pauses are the habit of an orator as well as an
&gt; actor (Bacon was both). An orator has to have pregnant pauses
&gt; or the audience will not hang on every word.

&gt; As in most of his essays, Bacon (like the author of The Tempest),
&gt; starts off with a prose introduction, then goes into something
&gt; between oration and verse. Note the absence of pauses in the
&gt; prose intro:

&gt; OF GREAT PLACE

&gt; Men in great place are thrice servants: servants of the sovereign
&gt; or state; servants of fame; and servants of business. So as they
&gt; have no freedom; neither in their persons, nor in their actions,
&gt; nor in their times. It is a strange desire, to seek power and to
&gt; lose
&gt; liberty: or to seek power over others, and to lose power over a
&gt; man's self.

&gt; Here's the first line of the body of the essay arranged
&gt; as a verse.

&gt; The rising unto place is laborious; and
&gt; By pains, men come to greater pains; and
&gt; It is sometimes base; and
&gt; By indignities, men come to dignities.

&gt; or

&gt; The rising unto place is laborious;
&gt; And by pains, men come to greater pains;
&gt; And it is sometimes base;
&gt; And by indignities, men come to dignities.

&gt; In his article defending Edward Bysshe's theory of meter,
&gt; Groves says that some one-syllable words get the spoken
&gt; length of words with two short syllables. The word &quot;and&quot;
&gt; appears to be one of those words.

"/>

While it's gratifying to be mentioned as an authority of sorts, I have to
say that I don't recall anything in that article that answers to this
paraphrase. the closest approximation seems to be the following passage,
but it concerns Latin rather than English:

'Central to classical Latin metre is the phonological feature of syllabic
weight or &quot;length,&quot; which functions as a kind of exchange-value, two
so-called &quot;short&quot; syllables being in most places metrically equivalent to
one &quot;long&quot; one, so that lines with the same underlying structure may have
very different numbers of syllables. Literary English verse of Bysshe's
period, on the other hand, resembles the modern Romance vernaculars that
Lancelot treats of in being metrically isosyllabic: once rule-governed
prosodic contractions and so-called &quot;feminine&quot; endings have been allowed
for, all the lines in a given metrical tradition such as heroic verse will
indeed have &quot;a certain Number of Syllables.&quot;&lt;3&gt;'

Peter G.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; Bacon frames the first two &quot;and&quot; lines with drawn out
&gt;&quot;pains&quot; and &quot;base&quot; and then puts &quot;dignities&quot; with
&gt; three quick syllables at the end. Very effective. One
&gt; would almost think Bacon was a poet.

&gt; Bacon's line in the original punctuation:

&gt; The rising unto place is laborious; and by pains, men come to
&gt; greater pains; and it is sometimes base; and by indignities, men
&gt; come to dignities.

&gt;&gt;&gt; grew older.

&gt;&gt; Indeed. In fact it is interesting to do a quick count of lines
&gt;&gt; where Shakespeare has used 'and' or 'but' as the first part of
&gt;&gt; an enjambment. If one does, one can almost say precisely when
&gt;&gt; he started to make use of them. Using Gary Taylor's dates, it
&gt;&gt; comes out like this for the 'last' 12 plays:

&gt;&gt; AWEW (1604/5) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt; Tim (1605) 'and' (0) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt; KL (1605/6) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt; Mac (1606) 'and' (2) 'but' (1)
&gt;&gt; A&amp;C (1606) 'and' (5) 'but' (5)
&gt;&gt; Per (1607) 'and' (4) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt; Cor (1608) 'and' (15) 'but' (4)
&gt;&gt; WT (1609) 'and' (8) 'but' (5)
&gt;&gt; Cym (1610) 'and' (7) 'but' (8)
&gt;&gt; Tem (1611) 'and' (7) 'but' (4)
&gt;&gt; H8 (1613) 'and' (9) 'but' (3)
&gt;&gt; 2NK (1613/4) 'and' (8) 'but' (1)

&gt; The man was clearly a machine, who had
&gt; no idea what a run-on line was, nor a
&gt; feminine ending, nor even -- probably-- a
&gt; rhyme. He had no education, so no one
&gt; ever told him what these things were.
&gt; He did it all naturally. He no more
&gt; thought about what he was doing than
&gt; we think about breathing.

&gt; That's why it makes sense to analyse his
&gt; work in this way. Of course we could
&gt; never apply this kind of principle to
&gt; ANY other writer of ANY other era.
&gt; And we don't -- ever.

&gt; We would not dream of subjecting the
&gt; work of the truly great writers of today --
&gt; such as Peter Farey or Lynne Kositsky.
&gt; to such a study. Unlike the ignorant
&gt; Stratman, who could not possibly have
&gt; known what he was doing, these supreme
&gt; stylists are intensely conscious of how
&gt; they use words and would never dream
&gt; producing work that would allowing the
&gt; application of such a crude measure.

&gt; Oops, I forgot. As it happens neither of
&gt; these 'greats' believe that the Stratman
&gt; was author of the works -- but, ah well,
&gt; it makes no difference. Stratfordian
&gt; rules pulled from the depths of the Strat
&gt; 'thinking' will always appeal to them.

&gt;&gt; On the other hand I can find *not one* example in any play by
&gt;&gt; Shakespeare which Taylor has given an earlier date than these.
&gt;&gt; Paul will no doubt explain why Cymbeline is nevertheless one
&gt;&gt; of Shakespeare's earlier plays.

&gt; How is it possible to be so stupid?

&gt; It should be made illegal for certain
&gt; people ever to quote figures. That
&gt; category would probably include all
&gt; Strats, and those who adopt any
&gt; aspect of Strat thinking.

&gt; Paul.

"/>

We all knew that Crowley has a tin ear, but his taking &lt;Cymbeline&gt; for an
early play puts the tin lid on it.

It was Tennyson's favourite play, incidentally, partly (I suspect) because
of the complex late-stage versification.

Unless you're comparing only Neo-classical to
Romantic verse (or verses in Romantic vernacular),
I don't know if that's always the case. The first
Sonnet that come up in a search has two unstressed
syllables at the start of Line 3. The poet had a
great line but he couldn't start it with the insubstantial
&quot;yet.&quot;&quot;Yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb&quot; is trite.

1. Who will believe my verse in time to come,
2. If it were filled with your most high deserts?
3. Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb

I think a prose syllable at the start gives the
subject -- heaven knows the poet's verse is but
a tomb -- weight. You just drop your voice on the
first two syllables which gives the line gravity.

There's a lot of &quot;though yet&quot; type metre in the first
syllables in lines of hymns, something Bacon would
know about. The infamous &quot;translations of Psalms&quot;
Strats use to disqualify Bacon from Shakespeare authorship,
are the lyrics of hymns, not poems. The Calvinst aristocracy
took up hymn writing hyms (they were low Church -- the
congregation provided the music). Mary Sidney and
George Herbert made stabs at &quot;translating&quot; the Psalms
to hymns.

With a few substitutions Sonnet XVII could be sung as
a hymn. It has some very hymn-like lines. I note that
the poet ends all the lines with stretched syllables as
those found at the end of lines in hymns. Only Bacon and
Neville were raised on low Church hymns and Neville's
authorship is a joke. Read his unshakespearean dialogues
(do Nevillians have a tin ear? yes).

4. Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
5. If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
6. And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
7. The age to come would say 'This poet lies;
8. Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.'
9. So should my papers, yellowed with their age,
10. Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
11. And your true rights be termed a poet's rage
12. And stretched metre of an antique song:

Bysshe belived that there would still be &quot;a certain number

There isn't a 'prose syllable' at the start. This is a
perfectly normal iambic pentameter with 'yet' stressed
and 'heaven' spoken as a single syllable - heav'n.

Well, to a rather small extent: on the whole Modern English stress has been
relatively stable over time and space, but there are exceptions. Australian
newsreaders, for example, have started talking about &lt;PROtestors&gt; instead of
&lt;proTEStors&gt;, which I think is the influence of American English, and
Shakespeare seems to have put secondary stress on the first syllable of
words like &lt;complete&gt;.

Peter's ear is impeccable, but I'm beginning to wonder whether those who can
actually hear the metre of Shakespeare and Marlowe are a dying breed, even
among critics, actors and aficionados of Shakespeare -- even on this site,
there are those like Crowley, Knave, gangleri and bookburn who wouldn't
recognise a pentameter if it bit them on the leg. The editors of a recent
'scholarly' edition of &lt;Pericles&gt; reject the idea of multiple authorship
because they can hear no difference between the first two and the last three
acts of the play.

One doesn't have to rely on humans.

Any half decent computer analysis will clearly show that early
Shakespeare and Marlowe are a closer match than early Shakespeare and
late Shakespeare. That's because L.O. wrote Marlowe first, then early
Shakespeare and finally (post 1604 from the isle of Malta) late
Shakespeare.

Nearly half a century ago, C. S. Lewis was bemoaning the metrical
deafness of many of his students. It was his understanding that, in
order to &quot;cure children of 'sing-song' readings&quot; (which, as he remarks,
the intelligent ones will outgrow on their own), they were actually
being taught to recite verse as though it were prose. I don't remember
being taught that, but I don't remember being taught much of anything
about meter beyond the obvious; neither can I remember being taught to
recite anything where the motive was the recitation and not the
memorization entailed.

(On the other hand, I wasn't taught anything about prose rhythms at all.
If I were not an Anglican, and so had not some academic knowledge of the
Book of Common Prayer, I wouldn't even know the meaning of the word
&quot;cursus&quot; -- to this day I am utterly in awe of Cranmer's abilities in
that direction.)

I have certainly encountered some amazing errors. I once had a director
who told me that /all/ pentameter lines were to be spoken as
end-stopped, no matter how enjambed. I think I weaned him away from
that, a little.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Indeed. In fact it is interesting to do a quick count of lines
&gt;&gt;&gt; where Shakespeare has used 'and' or 'but' as the first part of
&gt;&gt;&gt; an enjambment. If one does, one can almost say precisely when
&gt;&gt;&gt; he started to make use of them. Using Gary Taylor's dates, it
&gt;&gt;&gt; comes out like this for the 'last' 12 plays:

&gt;&gt;&gt; AWEW (1604/5) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tim (1605) 'and' (0) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; KL (1605/6) 'and' (1) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Mac (1606) 'and' (2) 'but' (1)
&gt;&gt;&gt; A&amp;C (1606) 'and' (5) 'but' (5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Per (1607) 'and' (4) 'but' (0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cor (1608) 'and' (15) 'but' (4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; WT (1609) 'and' (8) 'but' (5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Cym (1610) 'and' (7) 'but' (8)
&gt;&gt;&gt; Tem (1611) 'and' (7) 'but' (4)

How could I not know that the percentages

I didn't really touch on Bacon's authorship of

Cockburn, a barrister who knows evidence,

1. You're sure there are ciphers in there - but you don't know what
they are.

2. You don't know what they are - but they aren't esoteric messages.

3. You don't know what they are - but they're essentially anagrams for
his patrons.

In other words, you have no clue what Baconian ciphers may or may not
be present in the Shakespeare opus.

Also, would 'The Phoenix and the Turtle' acrostic FRANCISCO BACONO
exemplify what you term &quot;esoteric nonsense&quot;?

If the acrostic was placed there by or on behalf of Francis Bacon, then
your assertion that possible Baconian ciphers in the Shakespeare opus
were &quot;essentially anagrams for his patrons&quot; would not square with the
facts of the matter.

Edwin Bormann, a co-author of Mommsen's Corpus
Inscriptionum Latinarum (just to give you a sense of
Bormann's qualfications and yes, I've browsed Mommsen's
work although not all nineteen volumes), indentified Bacon's
verses -- some quite hilarious -- concealed in what you
refer to as Bacon's &quot;utterly different oeuvres.&quot;

Most of Bormann's examples are end-rhymed but here's
one I saved from his book that shows Bacon's internal
rhyme scheme:

As thy favours have increased upon me, so have thy corrections;
so as thou hast been always near me, O Lord; And e'er as my worldly
blessings were exalted,

(the rhyming begins)

so secret darts from thee have pierced me;

(three rhymes on a long e)

and when I have ascended before men,
I have descended in humiliation before thee.

(four rhymes on &quot;en&quot; and two rhymes on a short i)

for thee.

(a fourth rhyme on a long e).

This is not coincidental, as Bormann shows
in a two-hundred and seventy-page book. I've found
examples in Bacon's Essays. It also tends to answer
the question Gunnar asked above: Why do so many literary
figures including poets like Shelley see so much poetry
in Bacon's works?

I read it recently but I can't find it. If this subject
is of interest to you I found a source that might give you
some idea of the scope of traveling actors troupes.

As throughout wester Europe, one strand of English theatrical
activity grew out of all-male institutions -- grammar schools,
universities and chapel choirs. Another strand grew out of the
work of small traveling troupes with toured throughout England
and whoe activites are now being chronicled in Records of Early
English Drama (REED) volumes.
