Folks,

I am trying to export =&gt; import a trac postgres database ...

tried ....

export ====      pg_dump --data-only --format=c trac &gt; tracdata

import ====     pg_restore --data-only --format=c /home/lprgo1/tracdata

If you do a table by table  ...  select * from tablename;      the data
looks good ...  but it does not apear to map in the trac instance ... ????

Any clues anyone on what the problem may be or suggestions for a better
way to dump the data from the one postgres  and restoring (importing)
the data to the other trac postgres database ?

Appreciate any help. Thanks !!

Best Regards,

Joe

What errors do you get, or what are the problems in the target database after the restore command? Trac has such a
nice simple database schema that I doubt the problem is anything Trac-specific. A postgres expert would probably
want to know what version of postgres you're in, what's in the target database before the restore, and that kind of
thing.
