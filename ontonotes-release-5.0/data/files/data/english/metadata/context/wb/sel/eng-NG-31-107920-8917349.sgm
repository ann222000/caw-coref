You can go on and on about the Hamilton myth... but the fact of the
matter is that he acted like a total chump, a spoiled brat who didn´t
win the WDC even after being unfairingly favoured by Eccleston,
Dennis, Mosley, and the whole Brit circus around this sport. C´mon,
the guy even has a stage dad, for christssake.

There is poetic justice...

The tifosi Ecclestone and Mosely favoured him?

I doubt that fining McLaren (Hamilton's team if you didn't know) $100M
is going to be very helpful.  If they'' really wanted to help him
they'' have excluded those cars that finished ahead of Hamilton at
Brazil that were found to be in breach of the regulations.

Or they could have taken Kimis points away after he won in Australia
with an illegal car.

Bernie and Max are just motivated by money, so while Hamilton will be
a good cash cow for years to come, Ferrari is where the really big
bucks are and that's why they historically favour the red cars.  It's
also why you'll see that chump Hamilton being number 1 driver for
Ferrari at some stage in the next few seasons.

They simply don't get it with the red-coloured specs. Anything Ferrari spins
them is swallowed whole and then regurgitated. Think: Ferrari Fan = dimwit.
I concede that McLaren lost it and Ferrari got yet another gift - won
nothing. However, had F1 been consistent, then Ferrari for brazenly cheating
in Australia would not have been in a position to win the WDC. Take the10
points away from KR, as they should have been, and you have KR 100, LH 109
and FA 109 but LH pips FA so is WDC. That aside form the fuel temp fiasco
which the FIA is attempting to twist so Ferrari keeps the WDC. RD made plain
that the managers had had two meetings about fuel temps and all agreed a
procedure. Seems the FIA now wants to break that. I wonder why...

Mind with TV companies reporting their biggest F1 audiences, the FIA and BE
can only be thinking more of the same. :( It's become a soap opera. No
racing, just dramas. The state of F1 reflects those who run it. Drama queens
both.

Yhis is just silly... you people keep reiterating the same things
since months ago... it is senseless.. I think thatd denying McLaren
had a lenient treatment for its behaviour is just stupid.

Also, the Fuel decision was made by stewards, not Mosley and
Ecclestone (who do not make those decisions), and is based on reasons
infinitelly more sensible than the ones given at the original McLaren
hearing.

think it is.

Do you see the problem. If you want it to get quieter you need to STFU
too.

Hamilton wasn't fined $100Million, Hamilton doesn't get constructor's
points, and if not taking Hamilton's driver's points for driving a
cheat car isn't favoritism what is, fuckwit?

Not excluding Ferrari for designing and using illegal parts with the
intention of circumventing tests to ensure compliance? No?

Perhaps freezing engine development when you best mate tells you they
are happy their engine is the best in the field?

Perhaps saying this team are our favourites.
