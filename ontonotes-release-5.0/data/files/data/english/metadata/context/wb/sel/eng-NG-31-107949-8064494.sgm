You can't hitch yourself onto a passing truck, really, is what that means
to say.  I can see that, logically, if the bicycle is a vehicle on the
roadway, then yes, you could argue that being clipped-in would violate the
statute.

Interesting.  Ontario's highway traffic act says pretty much the same
thing (section 178 (1)), and the OP's interpretation never occurred to
me, but it does seem like it could be taken to mean that.

The next subsection is also interesting for what it DOESN'T say:
--------
Bicycle passengers

(2)  No  person  riding  on a bicycle designed for carrying one
person  only  shall  carry  any  other  person  thereon.  R.S.O. 1990,
c. H.8, s. 178 (2).
--------
But if you have a bicycle designed for carrying two people, there's no
legal restriction on how many people you can (try to) carry on it.

It doesn't say you can't attach your bike to your body. It says while on a
bike/skates etc, you can't be towed by another vehicle being operated upon a
roadway. Your interpretation would make seat belts illegal.

Okay, I figured there was a reasonable and well-defined explanation
(but that's not always the case).  There's an artful definition of
&quot;vehicle&quot; in that same article of the law that doesn't include
bicycles:

§ 159. Vehicle.    Every  device  in,  upon, or by which any person or
property is or may be  transported  or  drawn  upon  a  highway,
except devices  moved  by human power or used exclusively upon
stationary rails or tracks.

So you can legally grab onto a light rail car from your bicycle.

Ontario doesn't have that, so clipless pedals are illegal here if the
OP's reading is correct:

From the definitions in section 1(1):
--------
vehicle  includes  a  motor  vehicle,  trailer,  traction engine, farm
tractor,   road-building  machine,  bicycle  and  any  vehicle  drawn,
propelled  or  driven  by any kind of power, including muscular power,
but  does  not  include  a  motorized  snow  vehicle  or a street car;
(véhicule)
--------

Section 178(1), which I referred to but didn't quote in a previous reply
to this thread:
--------
Bicycle riders, etc., clinging to vehicles

178.  (1)  A  person  riding  upon  a motor assisted bicycle, a
bicycle,  a  coaster, roller skates, skis, a toboggan, a sled or a toy
vehicle  shall not attach it, them, himself or herself to a vehicle or
street car on a roadway.  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 178 (1).
--------

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

They've covered that one here, though.

I don't think motorized snow vehicles can legally be driven on the road,
but if I'm wrong about that the winter cyclists can still get a tow
from them.

Back in the long-ago days of my youth we used to call
that &quot;bumper shining&quot;.  If one had good rapport with
the coal/sawdust, bread, or milk delivery truck driver,
one could hitch up to the left side of the truck and
be recognizable in their outside mirror, and get a
boost back to school after lunch if running late --
as long as we didn't overly exploit the favour, or
act goofy while doing so.

In British Columbia it is also unlawful to ride no-hands.

It's also unlawful to ride double.  Some of my earliest
childhood, pre-school memories involve being ridden
home at night from my grandmother's place, double on
my older brother's bike.  That was when I learned to
love the &quot;feel&quot; of being on a bicycle, and also became
enamoured with astronomy -- how I enjoyed looking up in
wonder at the stars during those homebound rides!  I'm
sure it was much better than being cooped up in some
stoopid trailer.

At first I'd sit right on the handlebar.  Then I got bigger,
and sat sidesaddle on the top tube.  Then I got my own bike
and was free to get myself around.

I think the great ease with which I learned to ride boils down
to my having ridden double as a passenger on my older brother's
bike -- the experience taught me about balance, and not fearing
bicycles.

I still enjoy starry night rides.  Except I've got my own bike.
No passengers (usually).

cheers,
Tom

I'm not a lawyer, but I think I know this much.  If a citation were ever
issued for this &quot;violation,&quot; the court would take into account the obvious
intent of the law--which is that you are not permitted to hold onto another
vehicle and be towed.  Judges don't like people wasting their time with dumb
cases.  I can only imagine what they would say to the officer for writing
such a ticket.

I'm a lawyer and you're correct that a court normally would (or should) take
the intent of the law into account. In Texas, and probably many other
states, the legislature has enacted laws on how its laws should be
construed. Go to this link http://tlo2.tlc.state.tx.us/statutes/gv.toc.htm
and look at sections 311.021 and 311.023 for some examples.

When you get on a bike and close your hands around the grips, you're
attached. Obviously, that's not illegal.

Skates attach to the person wearing them.  That's not illegal.

Obviously, the statement implies being attached to another vehicle.

&gt; Sorry, but I don't know where you're reading.  What I posted clearly
&gt; says &quot;attach&quot; and doesn't specifically restrict it to towing.  Yes, it
&gt; seems to me that a seat belt on a bicycle actually would be illegal
&gt; according to this law.

&gt; The second paragraph of this same section 1233 seems to reinforce the
&gt; attached-pedal prohibition:

&gt;   2.  No  person  shall  ride on or attach himself to the outside of
&gt; any vehicle being operated upon a roadway.

&gt; Here are the laws online:

&gt; http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS

&gt; Select &quot;VAT Vehicle &amp; Traffic&quot; on that page, then &quot;Article 34 - (1230
&gt; - 1241) OPERATION OF BICYCLES AND PLAY DEVICES&quot; on the next page.
">

I don't think bicycles are &quot;vehicles&quot; under New York law (they are
&quot;wheeled non-motorized means of conveyance&quot;), so the restriction on
attaching yourself to a vehicle doesn't say anything about attaching
yourself to a bicycle.

Only if the seat belts and car seats are used by somebody &quot;riding upon
any bicycle, coaster, in-line skates, roller skates, skate board, sled,
or toy vehicle&quot; to attach him/her/itself to a vehicle (which excludes
almost everything (or everything, depending on the jurisdiction) on

Forget the clips (or clipless). By attaching themselve&quot; the law meand
you cannot hold onto the handlebars, sit astride the saddle, push the
pedals...

IOW, you cannot ride your bike. You have to walk alongside it moving it
via telekinesis. Because to touch it in any way would mean you would be
attached to the moving vehicle..

&gt;Okay, I figured there was a reasonable
&gt;and well-defined explanation (but that's
&gt;not always the case). There's an artful
&gt;definition of &quot;vehicle&quot; in that same article
&gt;of the law that doesn't include bicycles:

&gt;§ 159. Vehicle.   Every device in, upon,
&gt;or by which any person or property is or
&gt;may be transported or drawn upon a
&gt;highway, except devices moved by
&gt;human power or used exclusively upon
&gt;stationary rails or tracks.
&gt;So you can legally grab onto a light rail
&gt;car from your bicycle.

Hey, I think we've found a way around AMTRAK's bicycle regulations here!

A bicycle IS a vehicle, at least in some jurisdictions.
(It apparently isn't in the OP's, but it is here, and we have similar
wording in the Highway Traffic Act.)

Nice try, but AMTRAK is heavy (standard-gauge) rail.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I KNEW this thread was going to turn out useful.  As a law-abiding citizen I
am putting my six bikes up for sale.  Well, I guess I can keep my mountain
bikes as long as I stay off-road.  e-mail me for descriptions and prices.
NO--WAIT!  Am I allowed to sell things that are illegal to use?

&gt; (i.e. you can't attach your bike to your body)

(i.e., by holding onto the handlebars)

(The normal way to skitch a ride is by &quot;clinging&quot; to the other vehicle
by holding onto it.  So according to the OP's interpretation you can't
hold onto your bike, either.)

&gt; I don't think bicycles are &quot;vehicles&quot; under New York law (they are
&gt; &quot;wheeled non-motorized means of conveyance&quot;), so the restriction on
&gt; attaching yourself to a vehicle doesn't say anything about attaching
&gt; yourself to a bicycle.

Bicycles *are* classified as vehicles in NY. So are animal drawn carts
and carriages. Bicyclists are bound to obey all parts of the vehicle
code that can be applied to bicycles.
