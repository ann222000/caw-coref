Truly, Madly, Deeply Relaxed: Stillwater Spa

Article Description:
====================

Spa vacations can last an hour or a week. Within an hour, it's
the attention to details at Stillwater that lets the cumulative
weight of the work week in my shoulders begin to drift, as water
and hands gentle my back. And the relentlessly reassuring sound
of the Vichy water, sprayed from the nozzles above, shoos my
tangled worries away as if they were tumbleweeds.

Truly, Madly, Deeply Relaxed: Stillwater Spa

Spa vacations can last an hour or a week. Within an hour, it's
the attention to details at Stillwater that lets the cumulative
weight of the work week in my shoulders begin to drift, as water
and hands gentle my back. And the relentlessly reassuring sound
of the Vichy water, sprayed from the nozzles above, shoos my
tangled worries away as if they were tumbleweeds.

If only I'd known that to be brushed, rubbed with Brazilian sea
salts, slathered in mud, tucked in a cocoon, scrubbed with a
Canadian Maple concoction and scalp massaged until my head
tingled would result in my new, enlightened understanding of the
word 'serenity'.

I would have tried it sooner, rather than rushing afterwards to
schedule these treatments at Stillwater (at the Hyatt Regency
Calgary) as a gift for my wife. I mean, every guy likes to score
some points, and this is a sure-fire winner.

But that's the only rushing that arose from my spa vacation
(over the course of a morning) spent at Stillwater Spa. I live in
Calgary, but for business and leisure travellers, this oasis of
calm should be a welcome respite from the hurly burly of getting
things done daily – whether you're passing through the city
toward a Canadian Rocky Mountains holiday or preparing for a
summer event like the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede (July 7-16
this year).

Alberta's international gateway cities of Calgary (gateway to
the Canadian Rocky Mountains) and Edmonton (gateway to the North)
are each home to world class urban spas that provide swift access
to unruffled peace. Here's a look at some urban spa options when
you're visiting Calgary or Edmonton. Please check website
resources at the bottom of this story for pricing.

Treatments Spotlight: Stillwater (Hyatt Regency Calgary)

Cool water garnished with a thin wedge of grapefruit; the fluffy
white robe and blue massaging sandals; the treatment room, with
its inspired and peaceful bowl arrangement, set out and then
rolled up in a bamboo mat. All set the tone for a superb spa
experience beneath dimmed lights.

I started the morning at the Hyatt with a signature breakfast
dish, a new addition to the Hyatt hotel menus that provides
selections which reflect regional tastes and traditions. It gives
you a way into local flavours that you might not find otherwise.
And you'll find that there are regional slants in the spa
treatments as well.

Stillwater Assistant Spa Director Jennifer Cooke designed the
Canadian Maple Body Scrub, a regional specialty. Stillwater is
the spa brand for the Hyatt and you'll find each location has
certain signatures, including scents.

Jennifer began my spa vacation with a full body loofah
exfoliation. A combination of Brazilian (okay, not Canadian) sea
salts, essential oils and fragrances is enhanced with the
Canadian Maple scrub, which carries a fairly light scent that
echoes Canadian Maple syrup (though this scent is more likely to
transport you to sweet memories of the forest, rather than the
breakfast table).

Once you're thoroughly exfoliated, you can enjoy the therapeutic
Vichy shower aimed at each and every tender area, including those
sometimes achy, precise points on your back and legs.

Urban Renewal Body Masque

Another treatment that works well for the urban traveller is the
Urban Renewal Body Masque. This one is designed to detoxify and
hydrate the city dweller's skin, and given Calgary's dry winds,
it's a good one. You can customize your mud with a variety of
blends. I chose Green Tea and Lime Leaf, which had a slightly
invigorating scent, though there are citruses and floral options
available, among others.

The treatment began with me lying on my stomach, while Jennifer
applied a full body dry brush application. This step prepares the
skin for the Baltic Black mud, by removing old and dry skin
cells, so that the skin can absorb the mud's benefits. Organic
colloidal improves skin texture and the mixture enhances cell
turnover, while deeply hydrating.

Once it was applied, I was comforted by the warmth of an electric
blanket. And while the mud worked its magic, I enjoyed a relaxing
face and scalp massage. The scalp treatment is rich in alpha
hydroxyl acids and a stimulating assortment of mint essential
oils. It was during this 20 minute period that I was truly,
deeply, madly relaxed.

Next, I was released from the cocoon (not that I wanted to be)
and enjoyed a warm shower to rid myself of the mud during this
morning spa vacation. At the end, I was lathered in deep moisture
with the same scent (Green Tea and Lime Leaf) that I chose when I
customized the mud.

During these treatments (usually 60 minutes each), there is a
gentle layering and un-layering of towels, like a magician's
trick. It's almost as if your body is being lightly shuffled in
a deck of cards. Pure magic, easily accessed. And if you want,
you can choose from in-house products (I purchased  the Green Tea
and Lime Leaf Body Butter – okay, not very manly, but I wanted to
relive the experience) and the mint revitalizer conditioner for
my too-full-of-things-to-do skull.

Other Urban Spa Choices

At Ripley Ridge Retreat in Calgary, you can actually take a tour
of the wild flowers that grow at the nestled-in-the-forest
facility and choose items that will go into a personalized
treatment, such as the Wild Rose that is indigenous to Alberta.
At Institute de Santé, which combines medicine and wellness with
spa experiences, there is a Wild Rose Body Wrap and Rose Seed
Scrub treatment that I've thoroughly enjoyed. At RNR Wellness in
Calgary, men will find a great menu of treatments designed
specifically for guys, aside from the menu for women and couples.
And at Eveline Charles (in both Edmonton and Calgary), skin balms
such as Calming Orange can help you relieve tension and soothe
your skin.
