“Meanwhile, life is business as usual for the settlers. While everyone is making noise about the &quot;illegal outposts,&quot; the land thieves are turning to dealing quietly with the &quot;legal&quot; settlements. The Civil Administration has told Haaretz that even houses in a veteran settlement like Ofra, where settler leaders live, are built on private Palestinian land.” [Akiva Eldar, below in Demolition Fast Track]

Hi All,

Well, if in addition to the growing number of bds moves lately, also Jewish leaders are worried about Israel being delegitimized, then there’s hope,  maybe, that things are moving in the right direction.   We have to think about how to get Palestine back on the maps—not just the Palestine that should be on the paper maps and on websites, but instead has been omitted.  We need to continue to work to bring back the real Palestine, where Jews, Muslims, Christians, and seculars can live in peace and harmony.

Yes, I do believe.  It can happen. We have to make it happen.

Below are 3 items.  The first is about the worries of Jewish leaders.  The other 2 are reports by Akiva Eldar.  The quote above gives you a hint of what to expect.  They are about what is happening, about the situation, now.

All the best,

Dorothy

Growing trend to delegitimize Israel worries Jewish leaders
http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/880081.html

By Amiram Barkat

The trend toward delegitimizing Israel's existence as a Jewish state is growing not only in Europe, but also in the United States, according to Jewish-American academics and community leaders.

Anti-Israel attacks are even beginning to affect Jewish supporters of Israel, who have been accused of trying to silence public debate, they said.

This trend toward delegitimization will be one of the topics discussed at a conference on the future of the Jewish people that opens in Jerusalem this morning. The conference, which will be attended by researchers, heads of Jewish organizations and senior Israeli politicians, was organized by the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute.

Avinoam Bar-Yosef, JPPPI's director general, said that anti-Israel attacks in the U.S. constitute a &quot;long-term threat&quot; to Israel's standing, American Jewish organizations and the pro-Israel lobby.

&quot;Public attention is currently focused on Europe, due to initiatives like the British academic boycott,&quot; he said. &quot;In the U.S., the problem is still under the radar. But as a planning institute, we believe that it is necessary to formulate policy on this issue now.&quot;

Brandeis University President Jehuda Reinharz told Haaretz that American academics are at the forefront of those denying Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. Veteran advocates of this position, such as Tony Judt and Noam Chomsky, were joined last year by Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer, both from reputable academic institutions, who charged that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) dictates American foreign policy. Their article, which generated shock waves, is being turned into a book, which is slated to be published in September. The fact that a respected publisher paid Walt and Mearsheimer an advance that is thought to have totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars attests to how hot the publisher thinks this issue is, Reinharz said.

&quot;My feeling - and that of many people - following Walt and Mearsheimer and other publications is that we are at the start of a new era with regard to attitudes toward Israel in the U.S.,&quot; he added.

Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, believes that Jimmy Carter's book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, which was published last November, had a much greater impact than did other publications.

&quot;In the past, people who said that Jewish supporters of Israel control the media and politics belonged to the margins,&quot; he said. &quot;But after former president Carter said it, it gained legitimacy in the mainstream. Today, the debate is already on questions such as to what extent the Jews dominate.&quot;

Foxman said that Jews who challenge anti-Israel attacks find themselves accused of undermining freedom of expression.

&quot;I received letters from professors who claimed that when I accuse someone of anti-Semitism, I am trying to silence public debate,&quot; he said. &quot;When the president of Harvard University said that the delegitimization of Israel helps anti-Semites, he was accused of silencing public debate. No one would have dared accuse him of this had he been talking about racism or xenophobia.&quot;

Reinharz said that he is worried by the lack of effective response to anti-Israel publications.

&quot;I see no combined effort to fight this by the Jewish organizations, and in truth, I myself don't know how this could be done,&quot; he said.

The demolition fast track
[about 2/3 of the article]

By Akiva Eldar

Judea and Samaria Division officers and Civil Administration heads will have to sign on to the standing army for many years to learn what Labor Party Chairman Ehud Barak has forgotten about the outpost theory. Barak completed his preparatory course as GOC Central Command; he finished his internship as chief of staff; he received his doctorate as prime minister and defense minister. He knows that uprooting an existing outpost hurts more than pulling a tooth, and it is therefore worth investing in preventative treatment.

The day after he entered the Defense Ministry, Barak gave the order that structures, mobile homes and shipping containers erected in the West Bank without permits not be permitted to see the light of day. He said he would not allow the existence of &quot;disputed buildings,&quot; like the Jewish settlers' compound in Hebron that was established and populated right under the nose of the Israel Defense Forces. The ignorance, whether intentional or the result of negligence, of the new enterprise dragged the security establishment and attorney general into legal proceedings, whose outcome is unknown. The military appeals commission has not yet found the time to deliberate the settlers' appeals, whereas the High Court of Justice will hear the Palestinians' petition tomorrow.

According to a source close to Barak, ministerial permission will no longer be required to dismantle new structures. However, Barak's new order is just a tiny plug in one of the many holes Talia Sasson?s outpost report proposed closing two years ago. Sasson pointed to the construction of entire outposts on Palestinian-owned land. As published here, the Sasson committee last convened during (Kadima MK) Haim Ramon's brief stint as justice minister. Kadima MK Meir Sheetrit and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni left this hot potato to the next in line.

Justice Minister Daniel Friedmann is stubbornly refusing to implement the government's decision that places him at the head of the committee. A communique from the Prime Minister's Bureau on June 11 stated &quot;we are aware of the problems that have emerged in this context. It is our intention to act to resolve the matter in the very near future in coordination with the Labor Party chairman-elect and the defense minister, whoever they may be.&quot;

Meanwhile, life is business as usual for the settlers. While everyone is making noise about the &quot;illegal outposts,&quot; the land thieves are turning to dealing quietly with the &quot;legal&quot; settlements. The Civil Administration has told Haaretz that even houses in a veteran settlement like Ofra, where settler leaders live, are built on private Palestinian land. Civil Administration spokesman Captain Tzidki Maman told Haaretz that &quot;in addition to the expropriated territory that constitutes a considerable part of the area of the settlement, there are a number of plots purchased by the Himnuta Company and registered in the Land Registry in its name. However, it should be noted that throughout the years, some of the construction in the settlement deviated from the area of the expropriated lands.&quot; He noted that &quot;some of the buildings in Ofra were erected on private lands&quot; (meaning legally registered in the Land Registry in the names of Palestinian owners). The Civil Administration spokesman cited &quot;various reasons&quot; in refusing to relate to the number of buildings or to provide details about the owners of the lands.

However, a document prepared by the Civil Administration at the end of 2006, the main points of which were published on June 5 by Uri Blau, reveals what is hiding behind &quot;some of the buildings.&quot; The reference is to no less than 179 out of about 600 households in the settlement (nearly every third home).

The Civil Administration also refused to tell Dror Etkes, who until Sunday was the head of Peace Now's Settlement Watch, whether a confiscation order for the lands on which Ofra sits had been issued or to provide a copy of that order and a detailed map of its boundaries.

&quot;Regarding anywhere else within the State of Israel,&quot; says Etkes, &quot;the Land Registry is open for public viewing. Only in the territories of the West Bank is it defined as a state secret. The claim of land ownership anonymity is a means the state and its settler agents have created to limit the public and legal oversight of the phenomenon of land theft. This is an attempt to conceal conduct that can only be defined as a mafia state.&quot;

Labor MK Amir Peretz proved that even a defense minister who was a graduate of Peace Now was incapable of bothering settler leader Ze'ev Hever and his pals. It would be interesting to know what Barak promised his fervent supporter Yariv Oppenheimer, the secretary general and spokesman of Peace Now, and how far the new defense minister is prepared to go in the struggle to enforce the law in the territories, which are his responsibility, and against the prime minister.

The victory in the war to release the transcripts of the Winograd Committee testimonies reminded Meretz MK Zahava Gal-On that the transcripts of the Cohen Commission, which investigated the events of the first Lebanon War, were still classified. The Meretz faction leader decided that the time had come to embark on a campaign to reveal the full truth about the events of Sabra and Chatila.

The first arrow was fired in the direction of Attorney General Menachem Mazuz. If Mazuz doesn't take action, as in the case of Winograd, Gal-On will drag him to the Supreme Court. &quot;On the Winograd Committee matter, the High Court of Justice emphasized the public's right to know as a basic right that has high status,&quot; Gal-On wrote Mazuz. &quot;Obviously this precedent applies to an affair that occurred a quarter of a century ago. Had the requested material been available before the outbreak of the Second Lebanon War, it is possible this might have helped prevent mistakes and blunders that were made during the course of that war.&quot;

Gal-On relies here on Supreme Court Justice Ayala Procaccia's remarks in the Winograd report ruling: &quot;In case of a conflict between the principle of public scrutiny and contrary interests, the principal of the public nature of discussion retains the primary status of a supreme right ... The rule is openness to the public; the exception to it is state security or another recognized exception that reflects a weighty public interest.&quot;

This is not the first time Gal-On has addressed the transcripts and testimonies of the Cohen Commission. In January 2001, on the eve of the prime ministerial elections, she asked then prime minister and defense minister Ehud Barak to act to release the transcripts. She also asked then attorney general Elyakim Rubinstein to clarify his position on the question of lifting immunity, considering that the report dealt with events concerning Ariel Sharon, the Likud candidate for prime minister. When she received no reply, Gal-On petitioned the High Court of Justice. The petition was rejected after the state said that a panel of experts would be established for purpose of formulating an opinion. However, the court noted, &quot;the way is open for the petitioner to apply to this court again on this matter, should the need arise.&quot;

In June 2002, the government decided to adopt the panel's recommendation to maintain the Cohen Commission's position not to publish the transcripts of their meetings, which were held in camera and comprised Appendix II to the commission?s report. It also adopted the panel's recommendation to review the issue in five years. The five-year period ended last week.

Gal-On says it is not her intention to attack Sharon, and that the transcripts she seeks deal not only with Sharon but also with all of the first Lebanon War.

Border Control / Who told them to give birth at night?
http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/880094.html

The small village of Azun Athma is located in the southeastern part of the West Bank, not far from Qalqilyah and too close to Israel and the Jewish settlements of Etz Efraim, Elkanah, Sha'are Tikva and Oranit, which surround it in all directions. To ensure the security of the residents of Israel and for the sake of the settlers' convenience, the Palestinian village has been encircled by a fence and has become an enclave closed on all sides. In order to partake of essential services in the West Bank, the inhabitants of Azun Athma pass through a gate controlled by the Israel Defense Forces. They undergo physical searches each time they exit and enter. At 10 P.M. the soldiers close the gate and only open it again the next morning at 6 A.M.

It is common knowledge that the Palestinians suffer from a serious lack of discipline, which starts in their mother's womb. There are fetuses that insist on coming into this world right at the time when the Israeli soldiers go to sleep. What is to be done with these babies when Azun Athma only has a clinic providing the most basic services for two hours, twice a week? To make sure they will receive proper medical care during the birth, pregnant women (in an average year about 50 babies are born in the village) tend to leave their homes and move in with relatives, who reside in places where one can obtain accessible and good medical services. Thus, of the 33 babies that were born to inhabitants of the village between January of this year and the beginning of June, 20 were born outside the village. The others were born in their mothers' homes without the aid of a doctor or a qualified midwife.

According to a report published yesterday by the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the publication of which coincided with the third anniversary of the ruling by the International Court of Justice in The Hague concerning the security fence, the 10 Palestinian communities surrounded by the fence have no access to 24-hour emergency services. The authors of the report estimate that when construction of the fence is completed along the planned route, about 50,000 people will find themselves in a similar situation.

Their examination of 57 Palestinian communities also shows that the ruling of the International Court of Justice has not resulted in a dramatic change in the situation: of the 61 passages in the fence, only 26 are open all year round for the use of Palestinian farmers, while less than half the farmers enjoy direct and regular access to their lands; the gates are open only 64 percent of the planned and declared time; in 72 percent of the communities there have been complaints about routine humiliation and verbal harassment on the part of the soldiers; 24 percent of the communities complained of damage caused to produce as a result of being refused entry to agricultural areas; and 85 percent of traditional roads have been ruined and cut off by the fence.

If the report by the UN institutions casts doubt on the justice of the fence with regard to the Palestinian side, the new Brodet Committee report on the defense budget casts equal doubt on the wisdom of the fence with regard to the Israeli side. &quot;The manner of constructing the fence is another example of wasteful thought and conduct. The committee was not convinced that the process of building the fence is being implemented with the necessary consideration and in taking into account all the security and economic considerations.&quot;

When reading this sentence, it is highly recommended to contemplate the hue and cry surrounding the cut in the defense budget. &quot;According to information transmitted to the committee, the cost of the fence amounts to NIS 13 to 15 billion. This large expenditure was not considered as an important element to security, nor was its budgetary significance given due attention. The army sees itself as a subcontractor carrying out instructions to build a fence, without clarifying for itself the significance of this expenditure and the price for its maintenance, which will amount to hundreds of millions of shekels a year.&quot;

Colonel (res.) Shaul Arieli, who represents the Council for Peace and Security in petitions against the fence route, has repeatedly presented the High Court of Justice with alternative routes that would save the state coffers hundreds of millions of shekels. He notes that it was the High Court of Justice that rejected the opinion of the International Court of Justice in The Hague on the grounds that its decision had been made on the basis of incomplete and mistaken data. According to Arieli, the fact that the government and the security establishment are ignoring a number of High Court rulings constitutes contempt of the court and the rule of law in the eyes of the world. In addition, this attitude is delaying completion of the fence and has already sent more than a billion shekels down the drain.

The head of the Palestinian negotiating team, Saeb Erekat, has also not forgotten the anniversary of The Hague ruling. In a letter he sent to American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the other heads of the Middle East Quartet, Erekat has demanded that they ensure that Israel stop construction of the fence and fulfill its commitment, undertaken in the road map, to freeze all construction in the Jewish settlements in the West Bank. If the Palestinian Authority, at least the one in Ramallah, is once again a partner for agreements, then someone might well take those demands seriously. Or not.

If it did not deal with human beings, including infants, the latest report published over the weekend by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), in the occupied territories, on the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip would be one of the funniest documents ever published here.

The report, which relates to the period between June 28 and July 5, reveals that the situation is anything but pleasant. It is estimated that 75 percent of the workshops in the Gaza Strip are not operating at all or are operating at less than 20 percent their usual activity due to a lack of raw materials. However, the report states that the situation is not all that terrible. &quot;Humanitarian imports into Gaza between June 25 - July 1 through Kerem Shalom, Sufa and Karni have met 70 percent of the minimum food needs of the Gazan population.&quot;

Basing himself on UN World Food program (WFP) figures, the coordinator notes that this is &quot;a significant increase from the prior week, where only 21 percent of the food needs were met.&quot; The authors of the report do not confine themselves to general data. They append a table that details daily local consumption in the Gaza Strip alongside the level of imports and the local supply. Not only in metric tons; someone went to the trouble of calculating the percentages for them. And there is also a total of the two.

The report's implication is that if there is no flour, let them eat animal feed. If there is no rice, drink oil. If there is no hummus, lick sugar. What is important is that the total amount of essential foodstuffs reaches 70 percent. Behind these dry numbers lurks a juicy story about the tense relations among the UN organizations operating in the territories. It turns out that at OCHA's Jerusalem offices they are quite ashamed of this document, which bears their organization's name. The instruction to publish it came from the office of Kevin Kennedy, the humanitarian coordinator in the office of Michael Williams, the UN secretary-general's special envoy to the territories.

In this branch of the UN they are trying to curry favor with the Israelis and the Egyptians, who, as everyone knows, are not going out of their way to enable Hamas to maintain orderly life in Gaza. The envoy's office stands firmly behind the Israeli position, which insists on operating the Kerem Shalom crossing point in particular, despite strong objections by the Palestinian side. The office also supports Egypt's objections to opening the Rafah crossing point without European inspectors. Members of the Meretz Knesset faction, who returned yesterday from a visit to Cairo, were told in the Egyptian capital that &quot;it is necessary to prevent a humanitarian crisis in Gaza,&quot; but &quot;it mustn't become too good there.&quot; Faction head MK Zahava Gal-On said that to the best of her knowledge an economic boycott has not resulted in strengthening the moderates.

Kennedy's office has responded that there is no significance to the calculation of the average supply of various foodstuffs and hence to the ostensible improvement in the humanitarian situation. It was promised that this would be fixed and would not be repeated in future reports.

The State Attorneys' Office has good news for the inhabitants of the territories. Good? Terrific. In an official document signed by attorney Orit Koren, the director of the department of petitions to the High Court of Justice, the State of Israel announces that its presence in the West Bank, also known by the name &quot;Judea and Samaria,&quot; is only temporary. This according to a written statement sent by the Prosecutor's Office to the High Court of Justice, in the wake of a petition launched by Attorney Michael Sfard, who represents the inhabitants of the village of Bil'in and Peace Now. The petition concerns construction of the new neighborhood of the Modi'in Illit settlement, known as East Matityahu, without an approved master plan.

At first the Prosecutor's Office argued that with respect to a small settlement, Jordanian law allows the authorities to dispense with a master plan. But what should be done about the fact that Modi'in Illit is the largest settlement in the territories (its inhabitants number 40, 000, more than the population of Ramallah)? - The answer: Invent a new excuse. Now the state is claiming that, &quot;When it is a matter of regional or master planning that can determine and perpetuate the development of a given area in the long term, special caution is necessary in creating the balance between the principle of the temporariness of the belligerent seizure (the usual definition of an occupation) and the need to act on planning arrangements that take the future into account.&quot;

&quot;With this in mind,&quot; explains Koren, &quot;the regional authorities have consciously refrained from comprehensive and long-term planning of the region's territory in its entirety.&quot; It is not clear why the regional authorities have discriminated against Modi'in Illit's little sisters, among them Ma'aleh Adumim, Ariel and Betar Illit, and have required them to submit master plans. It is not clear how the excuse of the &quot;temporary nature&quot; of the occupation fits in with the state's position in petitions concerning the route of the fence, including in the area of the settlement of Tsofin, which claim that the planners took into account the master plan that expects expansion of the settlement.
