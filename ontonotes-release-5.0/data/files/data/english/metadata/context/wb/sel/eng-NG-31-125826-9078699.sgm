The global warming scare could turn out to be the greatest collective
flight from reality that history has ever recorded, say Christopher
Booker and Richard North.

An interesting article, from that it would appear that a great many people
failed to read the detail and took the &quot;Summary for Policymakers&quot; as being
the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

I think this paragraph sets the scene very nicely:-

&quot;Inevitably, many people have been bemused by this somewhat one-sided
debate, imagining that if so many experts are agreed, then there must be
something in it. But if we set the story of how this fear was promoted in
the context of other scares before it, the parallels which emerge might
leave any honest believer in global warming feeling uncomfortable.&quot;

Everyone knows that the Earth has gone through periods of hot and cold with
fluctuations within those periods, the only argument seems to be man's
influence since 1709 (the start of the Industrial Revolution). I'm not yet
convinced than man's activities are responsible. But having said that, it
seems to me that the less crap we pump into the environment in general the
better off we'll all be.

I agree with reducing emission, especially as fossil fuels will run
out in the next few decades.  What annoys me is people who tell me
that there is conclusive evidence that climate change is caused by
human activity, without questioning this at all.  When I point out the
holes in the evidence, they express amazement.

It IS caused by human activity, but by the shamefull way pirates have
been treated leading to fewer people taking up pirating as a career,
not by the emiisions caused when fossil fuel is used.

For starters, the oceans of the world either absorb or give off much
more CO2 than any human activity depending on temperature.   Given the
increased solar activity leading to increased temperatures, it follows
that more CO2 is also being liberated by the oceans.   Just because of a
possible correlation between temperature and CO2, there is no proved
causal link, either way.

It is indeed a &quot;puff&quot;. But it does contain some useful info indicating where
all the present fuss stems from and why.

From my reading of the article, the current situation has arisen from the
fact that the scientist caveats, reservations etc contained in the body of
the IPCC reports were excluded from the summaries. Politicians and others
didn't read beyond the summary and so that became &quot;Gospel&quot;. Thus we now have
Global Warming whereas some thirty years ago we had Global Cooling. I'm not
a climatologist, but AFAIK the Earth's climate doesn't change that quickly.

Youthful idealists don't usually have a memory of events before they were
born, so they won't know about the Global Cooling scare and have picked up
on the current panic. Give it a few years and something else will come along
to feed people's paranoia.

Quite a few IPCC members quit over that (considering it's a rather lucrative
position that says something) the problem being that in doing so they help to
polarise the view of the IPCC. The same thing happened in the '80's when a
lot of us left Greenpeace due to the way it was being taken.

So you honestly believe the &lt;1% of CO2 that is man made is what is driving
climate change over the &gt;99% that isn't? There isn't even the strong evidence
that was presented that CO2 increases are followed by a rise in temperature
not the other way round. The truth is a lot of the facts used by the green
doom mongers don't stack up with thorough scientific scrutiny, much like the
theory of &quot;Intelligent Design&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I agree with reducing emission, especially as fossil fuels will run

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; human activity, without questioning this at all.  When I point out
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the holes in the evidence, they express amazement.

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; OK, what are the holes?

&gt; &gt;&gt; Have you read the article linked to in the OP?

&gt; &gt; Yup, seems like a &quot;puff&quot; to sell a book which just happens to be on
&gt; &gt; sale in the Telegraph online bookshop.

&gt; It is indeed a &quot;puff&quot;. But it does contain some useful info indicating where
&gt; all the present fuss stems from and why.

&gt; From my reading of the article, the current situation has arisen from the
&gt; fact that the scientist caveats, reservations etc contained in the body of
&gt; the IPCC reports were excluded from the summaries. Politicians and others
&gt; didn't read beyond the summary and so that became &quot;Gospel&quot;. Thus we now haveGlobalWarming whereas some thirty years ago we hadGlobalCooling. I'm not
&gt; a climatologist, but AFAIK the Earth's climate doesn't change that quickly.

&gt; Youthful idealists don't usually have a memory of events before they were
&gt; born, so they won't know about theGlobalCoolingscare and have picked up
&gt; on the current panic. Give it a few years and something else will come along
&gt; to feed people's paranoia.

Harry Jackson on the Dangers of Getting Science from the Popular
Media
In an interesting article about anthropocentric global warming (AGW),
science in the popular media, and the implications of Al Gore winning
the Nobel Prize, Harry Jackson stumbled upon the interesting truth
about one of the favorite AGW denialist lines: the supposed
scientific
consensus concerning future global cooling leading us into another
ice
age.

&quot;In my discussions with scientists, I have once again discovered a
difference between the words of the scientific community and the
alarmist rhetoric of writers and activists. In fact, scientific
journals of the 1970s were saying that there would likely be warming
because of greenhouse effects, sooner than the return of an ice age.
Unfortunately, the complexity of the real scientific story was not
easily reduced to a thirty second sound bite or a catchy headline.&quot;

Indeed. The ice age theory was nowhere near as scientifically
supported as AGW is now, being represented in only a few popular
magazine articles instead of thousands of papers in the scientific
literature. But portraying it as if it was fuels the fire both for
the
mass media now, and the AGW deniers. This is something to be cautious
of with all media, and all scientific topics.

Most media outlets like TV news and radio programs are very limited
(self-limited, but limited nonetheless) with their time, and are
therefore unable to discuss scientific matters in sufficient detail.
It is inevitable that if one bases one's views of scientific matters
on such content, they will be seriously flawed. The mass media is
forced to broadbrush the topics, leaving off necessary qualifiers to
any statement they make, and ovesimplifying for a nontechnical
audience, even when they are otherwise perfectly accurate and
objective. Oh, they could do the job right if they were motivated to,
but as Jackson explains, they aren't.

&quot;Telling the full story with all of its scientific nuances, would
have
not produced headlines. For this reason the science was compromised,
conclusions were framed in a sensationalistic manner, and the public
was entertained - not informed.&quot;

Exactly. No one ever sold newspapers with the headline &quot;Everything is
Fine&quot;. Sensationalism sells, good science bores (the masses anyway).
Also, no one ever sold newspapers with debates where one side was
declared the absolute winner. Controversy too sells, so it plays to
the media's advantage to play up whatever controversies exist.

The lesson remains, if you want to know what people are talking
about,
read popular magazines and watch local news. If you want to know what
scientists really believe, what positions are debated, how much, and
by whom, read the scientific literature.
