***********************************************************

God uses us to help others find the way to Him.

Don't pray to change things, pray to change yourself.

Putting the Lord first, seeking Him first in all things, is the only
real way to ever be seeking what is best for us.

I believe there is nothing lovelier, deeper, more sympathetic, and more
perfect than the Savior; there is in the world only one figure of
absolute beauty: Christ.  --Fyodor Dostoevsky

The simplest meaning of Easter is that we are living in a world in which
God has the last word.  --Unknown

We can do whatever He calls us to do through Christ who strengthens us.
--Turning Point

The same God who guides the stars in their courses, who directs the
earth in its orbit, who feeds the burning furnace of the sun, and keeps
the stars perpetually burning with their fires--the same God has
promised to supply thy strength.  --Charles Spurgeon

***********************************************************

Once upon a time there was a rich King who had four wives.
He loved the 4th wife the most and adorned her with rich robes and
treated her to the finest of delicacies He gave her nothing but
the best.
He also loved the 3rd wife very much and was always showing her off to
neighboring kingdoms.  However, he feared that one day she would leave
Him for another.
He also loved his 2nd wife.  She was his confidant and was always kind,
considerate and patient with him.  Whenever the King faced a problem, he
could confide in her, and she would help him get through the difficult
times.
The King's 1st wife was a very loyal partner and had made great
contributions in maintaining his wealth and kingdom.  However, he
did not love the first wife.  Although she loved him deeply, he hardly
took notice of her!
One day, the King fell ill and he knew his time was short.  He thought
of His luxurious life and wondered, I now have four wives with me, but
when I die, I'll be all alone."
Thus, he asked the 4th wife, "I loved you the most, endowed you with the
finest clothing and showered great care over you.  Now
that I'm dying, will you follow me and keep me company?" "No way!
replied the 4th wife, and she walked away without another word. Her
answer cut like a sharp knife right into his heart.
The sad King then asked the 3rd wife, "I loved you all my life. Now that
I'm dying; will you follow me and keep me company?" "No!  replied the
3rd wife.  "Life is too good!  When you die, I'm going to remarry!" His
heart sank and turned cold.
He then asked the 2nd wife, "I have always turned to you for help and
you've always been there for me. When I die, will you follow me and keep
me company?" "I'm sorry, I can't help you out this time!  replied the
2nd wife. "At the very most, I can only walk with you to your grave."
Her answer struck him like a bolt of lightning, and the King was devastated.
Then a voice called out: "I'll go with you.  I'll follow you no matter
Where you go." The King looked up, and there was his first wife.  She
was very skinny as she suffered from malnutrition and neglect.  Greatly
grieved, the King said, "I should have taken much better care of you
when I had the chance!"
In truth, we all have the 4 wives in our lives:  Our 4th wife is our
body.  No matter how much time and effort we lavish in making it look
good, it will leave us when we die.
Our 3rd wife is our possessions, status and wealth.  When we die, it
will all go to others .
Our 2nd wife is our family and friends.  No matter how much they have
been there for us, the furthest they can stay by us is up to
the grave.
And our 1st wife is our Soul.  Often neglected in pursuit of wealth,
power and pleasures of the world.  However, our Soul is the only thing
that will follow us where ever we go.
Cultivate, strengthen and cherish it now, for it is the only part of us
that will follow us to the throne of God and continue with us throughout
eternity.  --Author Unknown

Stopping to Recharge
I held out for a long time getting a cell phone. But as much as I have
to communicate from the road, my cell phone has become a friend in many
situations. It's battery operated, which means, of course, that it will
not run indefinitely. And it's no fun to be in a situation where you
really need to communicate, and your cell phone is dead. So I need to
put that little guy down sometimes and plug him in to recharge, so he's
good to go again.
A cell phone needs some down time to recharge so it can serve again, and
so do you. In fact, God created you that way. That is the Sabbath
principle that He built into our creation, and He does not intend for us
to work all the time. He made us so we would take regular rest.
It may be that you're running down fast. You're stressed, you're
fatigued, you're more impatient, you're more irritable, and you're
addicted to your own adrenaline. If you keep driving at this speed,
you're going to go over the edge - or the people around you are. It's
time for the stress-reduction prescription in our word for today from
the Word of God. It's in Psalm 23 beginning in verse 1. Familiar words,
"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want. He makes me lie down
in green pastures, He leads me beside quiet waters, He restores my
soul." Where do you get restored? By quiet waters where your Shepherd
may be trying to lead you right now. But you haven't allowed any time
lately for quiet waters, have you? You're saying, "I'm too busy to take
a timeout." You're too busy not to.
It's the down time that recharges the battery of my cell phone. And it's
not wasted time. If I don't give it that recovery time, it eventually
won't work at all! It's down time that recharges your battery. And it's
not wasted time. If you don't allow that recovery time, eventually you
won't work at all!
I know how a make-it-happen, conscientious, goal-oriented, driven person
can fill up their life until there are just no margins. I am that kind
of person. I've done it. But it costs way too much. It costs you in
personal peace, in your close relationships, even in your performance
and your creativity. God created us in such a way that when we take time
out to rest and restore, we actually get a lot more done in a lot less time!
You may very well need some "quiet waters" time. And it won't happen
unless you make a non-negotiable commitment to it - put it in your
calendar. And then you need to stand back, re-examine your priorities,
and literally schedule regular times to recharge; to put some margins
back into your life, like setting a firm quitting time, getting to bed
earlier, or time off to balance extended time on. Without those
balancing mechanisms, you literally begin to burn out. And if you don't
get your Sabbaths, the Bible seems to indicate that one day your
Sabbaths will come to get you all at once.
The alternative is just continuing to run down, like you have been. Your
physical and emotional battery cannot run indefinitely. You have to stop
to recharge. And when you do, you'll be able to run again at full
strength.  --Ron Hutchcraft

In Perfect Sync
"Your Life And Everything In It. In Perfect Sync."
I'm ready! Sign me up. Now!
Needless to say I was a little disappointed when I realized the ad was
for a program on my computer that will keep all my calendar events,
contacts, etc., together in a way that allows me to access it on any
computer, anywhere, anytime. As much as I enjoy my computer and all the
things it allows me to do at a mind-boggling speed, I would be more
pleased to have my life and everything in it in perfect sync.
What would life be like if everything was in perfect sync?
There would be no stress, because the things that produce stress would
not exist.
There would be no worries, because the things that cause us to be
worried would have been taken care of.
There would be no sadness, because everything would be in perfect order
and thus no reason for sadness.
There would be no regrets because everything would have gotten done in
good order and at just the right time.
There would be no reason to be depressed or discouraged because the
events and people that produce depression and cause discouragement would
have been done away with, or compensated for by the new found ability to
put things in order.
There would be no rushing. There would be no catching up. There would be
no searching for things that have been misplaces. There would be no
repairing what has been messed up by inefficiency. There would be no
waste. There would be no missed appointments. There would be no rushing
to make appointments. There would be no arguments with your spouse or
your children or your parents or coworkers. Everything would be in
perfect sync.
After this brief bit of daydreaming, there is good news and bad news.
The bad news: there is no computer software program that will put my
life in perfect sync (not even a Mac).
The good news: One day everything will be in perfect.
Consider these words:  Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an
inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade --- kept in heaven for
you, who through faith are shielded by God's power until the coming of
the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. In this you
greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to
suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that your faith
--- of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by
fire --- may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor
when Jesus Christ is revealed. Though you have not seen him, you love
him; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are
filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the
goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls. (1 Peter 1:3-9, NIV)
Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. I saw the
Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,
prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.  And I heard a
loud voice from the throne saying, "Now the dwelling of God is with men,
and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself
will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their
eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the
old order of things has passed away."
He who was seated on the throne said, "I am making everything new!" Then
he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."
(Revelation 21:1-5, NIV)
My life will never be in perfect sync in this. But one God will make all
things new and perfect. I'm ready. Sign me up!  -- Tom

***********************************************************

BUILDING YOUR LIFE
My wife and her brother recently built a new deck on the back of our
house. It really looks fantastic, and one of the reasons for this is
probably because I had nothing to do with it. The truth is that while I
have gotten better at fixing things over the years I am still far more
skilled at breaking them than putting them back together. It is a
running joke here that my wife is both the better cook and the better
handyman in this house.
As little as I know about building things with nails, screws, and
lumber, however, I am happy to say that I know far more about building a
life. While I still make mistakes in that area too, I think that I am
becoming more skilled as I get older at knowing how to construct and
live a life full of love, joy, goodness, and giving.
I have come to know for instance that a great way to start the day is
with a joyous: "Good morning God. Thank you for my life." I have come to
know that few things feel better than giving a warm hug and few things
sound quite so Heavenly as saying, "I love you." I have come to know
that few things are as peaceful as a walk in the woods and that few
things are as inspiring as watching a sunset. I have come to know that
petting a dog or a cat is not only good for your health, but also good
for your soul. I have come to know that any joy you get from your work
or your life will be in direct proportion to the joy that you bring to
them. I have come to know that it is the good things you do for your
community, the kind acts you do for your friends, the compassion you
show for strangers, and the love you give this world that bring meaning
and richness to life. I have come to know most of all though, that it is
with every choice we make that we build our lives, create our joy, share
our love, and grow in our oneness with God.
May you build your own life well then. And may God always smile upon
your handiwork.  --Joseph J. Mazzella

THANK GOD INSTEAD
"If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with every
one."  (Romans 12:18, Amp)
When I was a new Christian, it was almost impossible for me to live at
peace with anyone! Almost every time I opened my mouth, I said something
ugly. I was constantly hurting the people I was close to. In fact, I
spoke more harshly to them than to anyone else.
I criticized Gloria's driving so much that she nearly refused to drive
while I was with her. I criticized my children so much that they began
to avoid me. I didn't want to be so insensitive, but I couldn't help it.
I had a well-developed habit of speaking harshly and didn't know how to
change it.
Then I found Ephesians 5:4. It said, "[Let there be] no coarse, stupid,
or flippant talk; these things are out of place; you should rather be
thanking God" (New English Bible). When I read that, I realized I needed
to replace the words I was used to saying with words of thanksgiving.
That would solve my problem. After all, I couldn't speak harshly and
thank God at the same time. I couldn't criticize those around me if I
had a thankful attitude about them.
I immediately decided to put this principle to work in my life. Rushing
into my son's room one day ready to lambaste him about something he had
done, I recognized my old behavior pattern. I just stopped and said to
myself, "The Word says this kind of behavior is out of place, so I am
going to stop and thank God." I wasn't nearly as angry after I spent a
few minutes praising and thanking the Lord.
If you've developed the habit of speaking harshly, start changing that
habit today. When someone crosses you on the job, at school, or
wherever, and you're tempted to  tear into them with cruel words, stop!
Then take a few moments to give thanks and praise to God. Once you begin
thinking about how good God is, more often than not, those harsh, angry
words will just slip away unspoken.
Instead of using your tongue to tear people down, train it to lift God's
praises up. Then living at peace with others will come easily to you!

SMALL STRAWS IN A SOFT WIND by Marsha Burns
Look up, beloved, for I tell you truly that the clouds of confusion are
going to part and and you will step into the clear light of day. You are
about to see with great clarity. The issues that have caused to you
wonder what to do next will become crystal clear, and you will know
exactly what your next step must be. Answers to your questions will come
suddenly, but might not be what you expected. Get ready to receive, says
the Lord.
1 Peter 2:9 But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy
nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him
who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.

Ask, and I will give you the answers to your dilemmas. If you will only
believe, I will pour out wisdom and revelation to extricate you from
every predicament. I will show you the way through the most mystifying
complexities. There is nothing that is impossible with Me, says the
Lord. I will prepare and empower you to overcome the obstacles that
hinder your progression. Trust Me.
Mark 10:27 But Jesus looked at them and said, "With men it is
impossible, but not with God; for with God all things are possible."

Be on the alert and watch for drains on your energy level. You will need
to replenish often by coming into My presence for a refreshing. The more
energy you expend, the more restoration is required. Come, I say, and
bathe yourself in spiritual life and be rejuvenated, says the Lord. Come
and be renewed.
Isaiah 40:31 But those who wait on the LORD shall renew their strength;
they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be
weary, they shall walk and not faint.

Easter Story Cookies  --Thomas W Henderson
(To be made the evening before Easter)
You will need the following ingredients:
1 cup whole pecans
1 teaspoon vinegar
3 egg whites
A pinch salt
1 cup sugar
A Ziplock baggie
A wooden spoon
Tape
Bible
Your children

Preheat oven to 300 F.
Place pecans in zipper baggie and let children beat them with the wooden
spoon to break into small pieces. Explain that after Jesus was arrested
He was beaten by the Roman soldiers. Read John 19:1-3.
Let each child smell the vinegar. Put 1 teaspoon of vinegar into mixing
bowl. Explain that when Jesus was thirsty on the cross, He was given
vinegar to drink. Read John 19:28-30.
Add egg whites to vinegar. Eggs represent life. Explain that Jesus gave
His life to give us life. Read John 10:10-11.
Sprinkle a little salt into each child's hand. Let them taste it and
brush the rest into the bowl. Explain that this represents the salty
tears shed by Jesus' followers, and the bitterness of our own sin. Read
Luke 23:27.
So far the ingredients are not very appetizing. Add 1 cup sugar. Explain
that the sweetest part of the story is that Jesus died because He loves
us. He wants us to know and belong to Him. Read Psalms 34:8 and John 3:16.
Beat with a mixer on high speed for 12 to 15 minutes until stiff peaks
are formed. Explain that the color white represents the purity in God's
eyes of those whose sins have been cleansed by Jesus. Read Isaiah 1:18
and John 3:1-3.
Fold in broken nuts. Drop by teaspoons onto wax paper covered cookie
sheet. Explain that each mound represents the rocky tomb where Jesus'
body was laid. Read Matthew 27:57-60.
Put the cookie sheet in the oven, close the door and turn the oven OFF.
Give each child a piece of tape and seal the oven door. Explain that
Jesus' tomb was sealed. Read Matthew 27:65-66.
GO TO BED! Explain that they may feel sad to leave the cookies in the
oven overnight. Jesus' followers were in despair when the tomb was
sealed. Read John 16:20 and 22.
On Easter morning, open the oven and give everyone a cookie. Notice the
cracked surface and take a bite. The cookies are hollow! On the first
Easter Jesus' followers were amazed to find the tomb open and empty.
Read Matthew 28:1-9.
HE HAS RISEN!!!!

For Those Tears He Died!
Jason, my 18-year-old son, has the entertaining ability to cry on
command and will perform for any audience at any time. "Two-year-old"
hilarious bawls and squalls on and off at will! But he's not alone! Walk
in the garden--any garden--and if you've got allergies, you can be sure
you will cry too--the tears will flow! Not the kind of tears I'm talking
about...
You see, Easter morning was here--and almost gone. Mary was in the
garden, crying....not to entertain an audience, not because of pollen in
the air, but because her precious Lord had been taken away. Where had
they laid Him? Real tears flowed freely...and then she heard Someone
call her name, "Mary!"
Who could it be? The keeper of the garden? No, it was the keeper of her
soul who had come on the scene. It was as if He said, "Mary, I know. I
understand. For those tears I died...I am here, your Risen Lord, to wipe
them away." The tears stopped, the voice was familiar...she would know
it anywhere! "Master!" she called as she knelt at the feet of her risen
Lord. Tears of sorrow became tears of joy...for He knew; He understood;
He had called her by name--He was alive!
Easter morning is "here and gone" for you too...and perhaps it was not
the joyous celebration you had anticipated. Hurts, hassles, happenings
inside and outside the family--whatever has caused those tears--is not
unknown to Him. He's there today in the garden of your heart--to call
your name, to wipe away the tears...and He can do it--for He's not just
the gardener; He's your Risen Lord. He knows your name, why the tears
are falling, and what you're going through.
Listen--hear Him call YOUR name today....let HIM quiet your heart, mind
and soul...it was for YOUR tears and MINE that He died--AND He lives!
Now believe it, let Him wipe away those tears, and bring joy to your
heart this day--and you will have a wonderful day!  --Peggie Bohanon

EASTER MEMORIES
Throughout my life, I have heard many profound interpretations of the
Easter story in drama, in song, in written form, and in the words of
great speakers.
However, my personal experience was the most profound. It was when God
taught me to have patience and to trust Him, with the help of loving
people and, of course, His gentle creatures.
I was seven years old and recovering from the chicken pox. My maternal
grandfather (mom's dad) was a patient in the cancer ward of Decatur
Memorial Hospital. Grandma was dividing her time, helping to care for me
and visiting her husband. Mom was working full time, along with helping
to care for me and visiting her dad.
That Easter Sunday morning found the three of us -- mom, grandma, and me
-- in the car traveling to the hospital. I was very sad, because I was
not yet well enough to be allowed to see my grandpa, the hero of my
childhood.
For as long as I had known him, he had been severely crippled by
rheumatoid arthritis, confined to a chair and at this point, completely
bedridden. He was slowly dying from cancer of the esophagus. Grandpa had
learned Braille so he could help me learn to read. He taught me the
basics of everything from music to life in general, and told me
countless stories, reading aloud from titles that ranged from "The Holy
Bible" to "The Adventures Of Alice In Wonderland".
I couldn't imagine not being with this special man on Easter Sunday.
But, the rules had to be kept and I would have to sit in the downstairs
lobby while grandma and mom took turns visiting grandpa and sitting with me.
As the three of us crossed the hospital parking lot, mom and grandma
noticed a little wren which had apparently been hit by a car. The bird
was still alive, though unconscious. Mom lifted the wren from the ground
and handed it to me, instructing me to cradle it in my hands until we
could find a paper cup, punch an air hole in the lid, and give the
little bird a place to try to revive.
In the lobby waiting room, mom and I sat holding the sleeping bird in
its container while grandma visited grandpa. Then, mom took her turn
while grandma sat with me.
As grandma and I were sitting there, who should happen through, but the
Easter Bunny!
He had been to the children's ward and was accompanied by a very sweet
African-American lady who said to my grandmother, "Oh! Let this little
girl see the Easter Bunny!"
A very tall, very discerning bunny knelt in front of me as I stood,
allowing me to touch his furry ears, nose, and whiskers. When I reached
his hand, I found a small sack of candy, which he gave to me. I gave him
a hug, and before they left, the lady gave me a dollar and wished me a
Happy Easter.
Mom returned shortly thereafter, and we walked outside. The little wren
had begun to move around in the paper container, and as we gingerly
lifted the lid, the bird flew away with a renewed sense of purpose.
This took place just one month prior to my grandfather's death, and
continues to be a treasured memory.
I hold very dear the mother and grandmother who respected life down to
the smallest of beings, the grandfather who put aside his own pain and
suffering in order to make my life better, and the grownups (Bunny
included) who put aside issues of "disability" and "skin color" so that
I -- a little girl -- could be reminded that God loved me.  -- Laurel Jean

The Perfect Gift
I have some sweet friends who never mention their birthdays. They
graciously and humbly let birthdays come and go, never wanting anyone to
make a fuss. But, hey, they get really piddley presents. I love and
admire those friends. They are wonderfully noble and unselfish. I have
very little in common with them, however. So, please mark my birthday on
your calendar. March 20th--Rhonda Rhea's birthday--big letters. You
might want to also make a significant sized note next to it to remind
yourself to buy a nice gift. I've been known to send out gift lists and
make selections at the major department stores. At your request, I can
also give you the precise number of shopping days left.
Don't worry if you happen to miss the exact date (Did I mention it's the
twentieth?). In recent years, I've found it difficult to fit all the
partying into one day, so I no longer have a mere birthday. I've
designated March as my "birthmonth." The celebration begins on the first
and I don't let go of it until the 31st, although I've been known to
still have some residual partying going on through April. I'm wondering
if I should make it a "birthquarter."
I told one of my friends the other day that one of my spiritual gifts is
the gift of "receiving." I don't think you'll find it listed in
scripture, but there are hints. After all, if it weren't for people like
me, what would those with the spiritual gift of giving do? See? I have a
purpose.
While we're on the topic of gifts, would you believe that the greatest,
most expensive gift ever purchased is often not accepted? If you're one
like me who has the gift of receiving, it's almost unimaginable, isn't it!
Jesus Christ set aside His rights as God and put on human skin to live a
sinless life and to die to pay for our sin. He bought our salvation with
His life. That's an expensive gift--the life of the holy Son of God! And
the gift is offered to all. Yet still there are those who are so wrapped
up in the temporary things of this world and consumed with controlling
their own worldly lives, that they refuse to accept the gift. Sad, isn't it?
There's something I'd like for you to remember--even more than I want
you to remember my birthday. And that is that there are those who need
to be reminded of the gift and of their need to accept it. Some have
never even heard. We have the awesome privilege of sharing the good news
of His gift.
"Every good and perfect gift comes down from above from the Father of
Lights." Praise be to the Father of Lights for the Perfect Gift. He
fills our lives with meaning, grants us undeserved grace and love,
infuses us with joy, and gives us each at least one birthday every year
(mine is March 20th).  --Rhonda Rhea

MY SHEPHERD WILL CARRY ME
The Lord is my Shepherd...and I am His lamb,
He loves me in spite of the way that I am.
He sees something in me that other folks miss,
And I sometimes think maybe...because of this...
I've never felt better...unloved or alone,
Though sometimes I grieve for my loved ones now gone.
I have always believed in The Words He has said,
The spirit lives on...though the body be dead.
I feel closer to Him...because of His care,
And I know when I call Him...He will be there.
I fear not the shadows...so dark and so dim,
My Shepherd will carry me safely through them.
--Sylvia

'Twas the Night Before Easter!
'Twas the night before Easter on Internet Lane;
>From New York, to Russia, spring Holidaze reigned!
Computers were linking from Disney to space;
And folks were resolving the Easter Egg case!
The kids were entranced by a techno-theme,
While visions of dinos appeared on the screen!
And Mom dyed the eggs, while I searched the Net,
For flowers to send her--or in trouble I'd get!!
When swiftly, my Mac began such a clatter,
The mouse shrieked in horror, "Netscape!--what's the matter!"
Away to my window, I jumped with great speed;
A break for sore eyes, I surely did need!
I saw flowers of spring beginning to bloom,
I welcomed the view from my computer room!
When what to my wondering eyes, did I see,
But a Stranger stooped low, on bended knee.
With a quick glance I knew 'twas a backflash of time,
I envisioned the form of my Savior Divine.
More rapid than eagles, my memory raced,
To another time and another place.
Where Christ, Lord of all, called each one by name--
"Follow Me," was His Word, and they willingly came.
They watched Him perform deeds of wondrous love;
They knew His power came from God above.
Yet we (you and me, folks!) just led him to die;
In the dark of a tomb our Savior did lie.
But then in another flash of great power,
I saw Him arise--death conquered that hour!
He was robed all in white, with radiant glow;
He stood in great splendor, this Savior I know.
His eyes with loving compassion shown,
I knew in that moment I need ne'er be alone.
His hands were outstretched as this One bid me come;
The work of redemption forever done.
I stood there in silence, in humble awe,
As the Reason of Easter I now clearly saw.
Then quickly as the scenes had appeared,
They faded--I felt not one moment of fear.
I bowed low in worship; earth's sight now so dim;
I had seen Easter's meaning; I had been there with Him.
As I saw Him, with faith's eyes, lifted above,
The night before Easter was filled with pure love.
And I heard him exclaim as He rose out of sight,
"A Blessed Easter to all! I have conquered your night!"

"Every Day Is Easter!"
"Easter comes but once a year,"
So many people say,
But, to a person saved from sin,
It's Easter every day!
A man, when saved or "born again"
His life, to Christ, will give,
And, as a new-born babe in Christ,
He's just begun to live.
"I am the resurrection, life,"
The Savior, one day, said;
'And he, believing in my word,
Shall live, though he be dead."
And that well known Apostle,
Paul, in Philippi made plain;
"For me to live is Jesus Christ,
For me to die is gain."
So when the Blood of Christ,
our Lord, Redeems a soul from sin;
Every day is Easter,
For Jesus lives within!
THE GREATEST BLESSINGS AND NEWS THE WORLD EVER RECEIVED CAME FROM A
GRAVE YARD NEAR JERUSALEM!

Jesus Before Pilate
Very early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the
teachers of the law and the whole Sanhedrin, reached a decision. They
bound Jesus, led him away and handed him over to Pilate.  "Are you the
king of the Jews?" asked Pilate. "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied.
The chief priests accused him of many things. So again Pilate asked him,
"Aren't you going to answer? See how many things they are accusing you
of." But Jesus still made no reply, and Pilate was amazed. Now it was
the custom at the Feast to release a prisoner whom the people
requested.  A man called Barabbas was in prison with the
insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising.  The crowd
came up and asked Pilate to do for them what he usually did. "Do you
want me to release to you the king of the Jews?" asked Pilate, knowing
it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have Pilate release
Barabbas instead. "What shall I do, then, with the one you call the king
of the Jews?" Pilate asked them. "Crucify him!" they shouted. "Why? What
crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder,
"Crucify him!" Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to
them. He had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
The Soldiers Mock Jesus
The soldiers led Jesus away into the palace (that is, the Praetorium)
and called together the whole company of soldiers. They put a purple
robe on him, then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him.
And they began to call out to him, "Hail, king of the Jews!"  Again and
again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Falling
on their knees, they paid homage to him. And when they had mocked him,
they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they
led him out to crucify him.
The Crucifixion
A certain man from Cyrene, Simon, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was
passing by on his way in from the country, and they forced him to carry
the cross. They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means
The Place of the Skull).  Then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh,
but he did not take it.  And they crucified him. Dividing up his
clothes, they cast lots to see what each would get. It was the third
hour when they crucified him.  The written notice of the charge against
him read:  THE KING OF THE JEWS. They crucified two robbers with him,
one on his right and one on his left. Those who passed by hurled insults
at him, shaking their heads and saying, "So! You who are going to
destroy the temple and build it in three days,  come down from the cross
and save yourself!" In the same way the chief priests and the teachers
of the law mocked him among themselves. "He saved others," they said,
"but he can't save himself!  Let this Christ, this King of Israel, come
down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those crucified
with him also heaped insults on him.
The Death of Jesus
At the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth
hour.  And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "Eloi,
Eloi, lama sabachthani?"--which means, "My God, my God, why have you
forsaken me?" When some of those standing near heard this, they said,
"Listen, he's calling Elijah." One man ran, filled a sponge with wine
vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink. "Now leave
him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down," he said. With a
loud cry, Jesus breathed his last. The curtain of the temple was torn in
two from top to bottom.  And when the centurion, who stood there in
front of Jesus, heard his cry and saw how he died, he said, "Surely this
man was the Son of God!"  Some women were watching from a distance.
Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and
of Joses, and Salome. In Galilee these women had followed him and cared
for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem
were also there.
The Burial of Jesus
It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as
evening approached, Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the
Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to
Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. Pilate was surprised to hear that he
was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had
already died.  When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he
gave the body to Joseph.  So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down
the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of
rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.  Mary
Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.  Mark 15

Easter: The story of Edith Burns
DO YOU BELIEVE IN EASTER?
Edith Burns was a wonderful Christian who lived in San Antonio, Texas.
She was the patient of a doctor by the name of Will Phillips. Dr.
Phillips was a gentle doctor who saw patients as people. His favorite
patient was Edith Burns.
One morning he went to his office with a heavy heart and it was because
of Edith Burns. When he walked into that waiting room, there sat Edith
with her big black Bible in her lap earnestly talking to a young mother
sitting beside her.
Edith had a habit of introducing herself in this way: "Hello, my name is
Edith Burns. Do you believe in Easter?" Then she would explain the
meaning of Easter, and many times people would be saved.
Dr. Phillips walked into that office and there he saw the head nurse,
Beverly. Beverly had first met Edith when she was taking her blood
pressure. Edith began by saying, "My name is Edith Burns. Do you believe
in Easter?"
Beverly said, "Why yes I do."
Edith said, "Well, what do you believe about Easter?"
Beverly said, "Well, it's all about egg hunts, going to church, and
dressing up." Edith kept pressing her about the real meaning of Easter,
and finally led her to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ.
Dr. Phillips said, "Beverly, don't call Edith into the office quite yet.
I believe there is another delivery taking place in the waiting room.
After being called back in the doctor's office, Edith sat down and when
she took a look at the doctor she said, "Dr. Will, why are you so sad?
Are you reading your Bible? Are you praying?"
Dr. Phillips said gently, "Edith, I'm the doctor and you're the
patient." With a heavy heart he said, "Your lab report came back and it
says you have cancer, and Edith, you're not going to live very long."
Edith said, "Why Will Phillips, shame on you. Why are you so sad? Do you
think God makes mistakes? You have just told me I'm going to see my
precious Lord Jesus, my husband, and my friends. You have just told me
that I am going to celebrate Easter Forever, and here you are having
difficulty giving me my ticket!"
Dr. Phillips thought to himself, "What a magnificent woman this Edith
Burns is!" Edith continued coming to Dr. Phillips. Christmas came and
the office was closed through January 3rd. On the day the office opened,
Edith did not show up. Later that afternoon, Edith called Dr. Phillips
and said she would have to be moving her story to the hospital and said,
"Will, I'm very near home, so would you make sure that they put women in
here next to me in my room who need to know about Easter."
Well, they did just that and women began to come in and share that room
with Edith. Many women were saved. Everybody on that floor from staff to
patients were so excited about Edith, that they started calling her
Edith Easter; that is everyone except Phyllis Cross, the head nurse.
Phyllis made it plain that she wanted nothing to do with Edith because
she was a "religious nut." She had been a nurse in an army hospital. She
had seen it all and heard it all. She was the original GI Jane. She had
been married three times. She was hard, cold, and did everything by the
book.
One morning the two nurses who were to attend to Edith were sick. Edith
had the flu and Phyllis Cross had to go in and give her a shot. When she
walked in, Edith had a big smile on her face and said, "Phyllis, God
loves you and I love you, and I have been praying for you."
Phyllis Cross said, "Well, you can quit praying for me. It won't work.
I'm not interested."
Edith said, "Well, I will pray and I have asked God not to let me go
home until you come into the family."
Phyllis Cross said, "Then you will never die because that will never
happen," and curtly walked out of the room.
Every day Phyllis Cross would walk into the room and Edith would say,
"God loves you, Phyllis, and I love you, and I'm praying for you."
One day Phyllis Cross said she was literally drawn to Edith's room like
a magnet would draw iron. She sat down on the bed and Edith said, "I'm
so glad you have come, because God told me that today is your special day."
Phyllis said, "Edith, you have asked everybody here the question, 'Do
you believe in Easter?' but you have never asked me."
Edith said, "Phyllis, I wanted to many times, but God told me to wait
until you asked, and now that you have asked."
Edith took her Bible and shared with Phyllis the Easter Story of the
death, burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Edith said, "Phyllis, do
you believe in Easter? Do you believe that Jesus Christ is alive and He
wants to live in your heart?"
Phyllis said, "Oh I want to believe that with all of my heart, and I do
want Jesus in my life." Right there, Phyllis Cross prayed and invited
Jesus Christ into her heart. For the first time Phyllis did not walk out
of a hospital room, she was carried out on the wings of angels.
Two days later, Phyllis came in and Edith said, "Do you know what day it
is?" Phyllis said, "Why Edith, it's Good Friday."
Edith said, "Oh, no, for you every day is Easter. Happy Easter, Phyllis!"
Two days later, on Easter Sunday, Phyllis Cross came into work, did some
of her duties and then went down to the flower shop and got some Easter
lilies because she wanted to go up to see Edith and give her some Easter
lilies and wish her a Happy Easter.
When she walked into Edith's room, Edith was in bed. That big black
Bible was on her lap. Her hands were in that Bible. There was a sweet
smile on her face. When Phyllis went to pick up Edith's hand, she
realized Edith was dead. Her left hand was on John 14:2 "In my Father's
house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you, I will come
again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be
also." Her right hand was on Revelation 21:4, "And God will wipe away
every tear from their eyes, there shall be no more death nor sorrow, nor
crying; and there shall be no more pain, for the former things have
passed away."
Phyllis took one look at that dead body, and then lifted her face toward
heaven, and with tears streaming down here cheeks, said, "Happy Easter,
Edith - Happy Easter!"
Phyllis left Edith's body, walked out of the room, and over to a table
where two student nurses were sitting. She said, "My name is Phyllis
Cross. Do you believe in Easter?"  --Thomas W Henderson

The Resurrection
When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and
Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus' body. Very
early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on
their way to the tomb and they asked each other, "Who will roll the
stone away from the entrance of the tomb?" But when they looked up, they
saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. As they
entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting
on the right side, and they were alarmed.  "Don't be alarmed," he said.
"You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has
risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. But go, tell
his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There
you will see him, just as he told you.' " Trembling and bewildered, the
women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone,
because they were afraid. ((The most reliable early manuscripts and
other ancient witnesses do not have Mark 16:9-20.)) When Jesus rose
early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene,
out of whom he had driven seven demons. She went and told those who had
been with him and who were mourning and weeping. When they heard that
Jesus was alive and that she had seen him, they did not believe it.
Afterward Jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they
were walking in the country. These returned and reported it to the rest;
but they did not believe them either. Later Jesus appeared to the Eleven
as they were eating; he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their
stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen.
He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the good news to all
creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever
does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those
who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in
new tongues; they will pick up snakes with th eir hands; and when they
drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their
hands on sick people, and they will get well." After the Lord Jesus had
spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand
of God. Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the
Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that
accompanied it.  Mark 16

Loving God, your grace is amazing, that Jesus would go to the cross for
us. Amen

The Jelly Bean Prayer
Red is for the blood He gave,
Green is for the grass He made,
Yellow is for the sun so bright,
Orange is for the edge of night.
Black is for the sins that were made
White is for the grace He gave,
Purple is for the hour of sorrow,
Pink is for the new tomorrow.
Give a bag of jelly beans, colorful and sweet,
Tell them it's a Prayer...It's a Promise...It's an Easter Treat !
