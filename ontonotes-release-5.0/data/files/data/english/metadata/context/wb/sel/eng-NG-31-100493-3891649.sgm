I have an 04 1500 Ram 4x4 5.7 hemi quad with swb. The gears are 3.53. I
bought this without knowing anything about towing and at the time only
intended on towing a pop-up trailer which we never felt behind us. We
upgraded to a 25 foot camper approx 5,000.lbs. When in the hilly areas we
noticed that we really have to work to get up some of the hills. We  have
only modified the truck with a K&amp;N air intake kit so far. What should  we do
to give this truck a higher towing capacity?  I have heard changing the rear
gears would help?  How much would something like this cost?  Would my fuel
mileage suffer? I have 12,000 miles on the truck now and would get screwed
over by trading it for a 2500 ram.  Thanks Howard

Changing rear gears is certainly the best bang for the buck.  3.92 should be
fine, but if you live where speeds are rarely &gt;65mph'ish, you might even consider 4.11.
As to cost, that can vary.  To simply change the gears, you're probably talking
about $200-300 per axle.  The front axle is usually a little more, because it's
tougher to get to.   If you don't already have LSD, you might consider that.
Dodge trucks with the corporate 9.5" rear are pretty famous for lunching the
carrier bearings at 60-80K miles.  If you take it to a shop for a gear change, have
them put some quality bearings in there.  Then you never have to worry about it.

.boB,thanks,but besides being the acronym for a drug what is LSD?  Also you
mean even though I might never tow in 4x4 mode I would need to change gears
in front also?  What would changing gears up to 3.92 due to my mileage?
Also by changing the gears does this mean that the engine won't need to
"race up" as much to get up the hills. With the K&amp;N intake my wife and I can
barely talk to each other when I rev up for the hills.  Sorry I ask so many

At 5000 lbs you are actually the maximum towing capcity of 4900 lbs unless
you have the tow package then max capcity is 8300 lbs.

Limited Slip Differential....

Lower gears give you more "grunt" and will get the load moving faster... they
will also make the truck run at higher RPM, so your hiway mileage will
decrease... Some folks say that lower gears raise the MPG in town, because the
truck doesn't have to work as hard to get moving???

IMHO, the K&amp;N is doing what it does best, making noise, and what it does even
better, letting more dirt into the engine.. other than that, it's worthless..

On the other hand, I have to wonder if you're towing up grades in OD??
We have a 99 ram quad cab, 2wd, auto, 5.9 gas, 3.55 rear end... we haul a travel
that's 5,000# dry, probably close to 6,500# loaded with all our crap, and it
takes a major grade to slow us down a lot... you have more horsepower and more
torque with the hemi, so you should out tow us by a big margin..
Does your Ram have tow-haul mode?
Are you using it?

A General rule of thumb is that if the truck is "hunting", or up and down
shifting a lot, you should have OD locked out...
We always tow without OD, figuring that you can't hurt it to lock out OD, and
our MPG is the same or better with it locked out... YMMV

You'd to want to change the front as well. Why make a 2wd out of a 4wd.
Changing to 3:90 or 4:10's will cut into you fuel economy. Throw out the K$N
and put the stock filter back, that way you can hear your wife while she's
telling you that you bought the wrong truck.&lt;G&gt;
What do you mean by "race up"? You might want to see just how bad things
would go if you were to trade up to a 2500 with the Cummins. You are going
to be tossing a grand anyway at this one and then you probably won't be
totally happy with it. Right now there are some decent deals around.

I have a 04 Durango Hemi and pull about 5,000lbs loaded.  It pulls it

Ok,that seems to be the general consensus.  It isn't hunting for gears and I
do use the tow/haul mode. I just seem to really have to put my foot in it to
get up the roads in our White Mts.  (NH) Maybe the K&amp;N air intake is just
making it more noticeable to me now.  On the flat stuff it does great.
Thanks everyone.

The front and rear gear ratios need to match.  Otherwise, when in 4x4, one set of
wheels will try to turn faster than other.  Does strange things to the handling.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; What would changing gears up to 3.92 due to my mileage?
">

Depends on the type of driving you do.  If most of your driving is 65 mph or
less, it may actually improve it by keeping the engine closer to it's power peak.  I
would expect your towing mileage to improve or stay the same, because you won't need
as much throttle opening to do the same job.    OTOH, if you live in Montana, and
routinely cruise along at 85 mph, changing gears will probably decrease mileage.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also by changing the gears does this mean that the engine won't need to
&gt; &quot;race up&quot; as much to get up the hills.

Depends.  Many times the rpm's climb dramatically because you've downshifted in
to 2nd to make the hills.  With better gearing, you'll only be down in to 3rd.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Over the years, a lot of testing has been done on Dodge engine to see what makes
more power, and what doesn't.  A good open element air cleaner was one of the few
items that did (although not very much).  I wouldn't get rid of it, but I would
figure out a way to shroud it to prevent the noise intrusion into the cab.  I have
one on my truck, and although I can hear it, it certainly isn't intrusive.  Are you
sure the noise is from the air cleaner?  Try putting the stock parts back on and run
the same route.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Sorry I ask so many
&gt; questions ,but I know very little about trucks,engines,running gear.

That's OK.  We all gotta learn some time.

For reference, here's a little chart to compare speed and rpm's in different gear ratios:

Gear    FDR     Speed
1st     2.4     8.52    27.9
2nd     1.47    5.2185  45.6
3rd     1       3.55    67
4th     0.82    2.911   81.7

Rear    3.55
Tire    32
RPM     2500

------------------------------------

Gear    FDR     Speed
1st     2.4     9.408   25.2
2nd     1.47    5.7624  41.3
3rd     1       3.92    60.7
4th     0.82    3.2144  74

Rear    3.92
Tire    32
RPM     2500

If you want the spreadsheet, let me know.

I've got an 04 Durango Hemi also, 2WD, 5 speed auto.  With the tow/haul
engaged should it be shifting into fifth gear?  The manual says it will
stay out of overdrive but is OD different than fifth?  I tried using the
cruise control while towing, at seventy mph it wouldn't stay in any gear
longer than a few seconds (kept shifting up/down).  I'm probably towing
close to 6000 lbs., mostly tow on level terrain to slightly rolling.
I'd like to be able to control the shift points, maybe keep it out of
fifth altogether.

When in tow/haul mode it locks out 5th gear.  I believe 4th is still OD
and 3rd is 1:1.  On flat terrain mine will sometimes shift to 4th but
often stays in 3rd.  It does not shift back and forth.  4th can pull my
trailer at 65mph.  Any slower and it's bogged down and struggles.  It
really needs to stay in 3rd when towing unless very flat and over 60mph.
Up steep hills it will shift back and forth between 3rd and 2nd so I
manually shift to 2nd on the steep grades.

A lot of what you're feeling, ("I just seem to really have to put my foot in it

get used to it..
When we were towing a little tent trailer, we'd zoom up grades... but when we
switched to a 6,000 pound (loaded) trailer, we pretty much doubled the weight of
the truck and added 4 wheels... you're not going to pull hills the same towing
as you do not towing, unless you have 2 or 3 times the power that the truck need
to move itself..

We went to the coast for the weekend, and that involves pulling 3 or 4 small
(1,500 foot or so) hills... one is a 3 mile, 7% grade... we did about 40 mph up
it at about 3,500 rpm... no big thing, we made a lot of noise going slow for a
few miles, the engine and tranny temp stayed ok, and we went down the other side
at the legal limit..
My guess is that if we had a K&amp;N (or just NO filter) we would sound like we were
doing about 6,000 rpm.. lol

The thing that helped us the most wasn't mechanical, it was mental:
We had to get into the mind set that this was a Recreational Ve chicle, so we
should relax and enjoy the trip... if we're in a hurry, we leave the trailer
home and stay in motels.. YMMV

&gt;&gt;&gt; A General rule of thumb is that if the truck is &quot;hunting&quot;, or up and down
&gt;&gt;&gt; shifting a lot, you should have OD locked out...
&gt;&gt;&gt; We always tow without OD, figuring that you can't hurt it to lock out OD,
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; our MPG is the same or better with it locked out... YMMV

&gt;&gt; this statement is probably the best bet in my opinion if you look at most
&gt;&gt; owners manuals it will say something to the effect that if you tow or haul
&gt;&gt; anything over a certain weight (practically any trailer or anything with
&gt;&gt; any
&gt;&gt; size in the back) that they recomend you use tow/haul or o/d off.
&gt;&gt; now as far as your truck having the power to pull 5,000 lbs?? id think you

Even a 3.92 is not likely to be enough for you needs (nor a 4.10) You
have a few problems here. The biggest one is the engine itself which
is GREATLY over rated for truck duty. The HP ratings look inpressive
on paper but most towing and trucking is done below 3500 RPM where the
Hemi is kinda gutless and no intake filte change or exhaust change is
going to fix this. Chysler should have modified the cam timing and
ports for less peak HP above 4000 RPM and more usable HP and torque at
lower RPM’s where you need it in a truck. It also lacks displacement
which mean torque too. (even the old 360 has more grunt below 3500 RPM
in the seat of the pants than the Hemi does)  How do you fix this?
GEARS!!! Get the engine RPM up under load so that it can make more
power because nothing you can do short of super charging is going to
make it deliver more low torque at lower RPM’s so forget trying that.
When you consider gear ratio you must factor tires size and the loads
you plan to haul. A 4.10  would be bare minimum here with a 4.56 a
better choice if you have some serious towing to do. These ratios are
not as high as they sound with 32 inch tires and OD and I doubt the
mileage will change much with a 4.56 because the engine will be
cruising at a more efficent RPM and with a 4.10 it might even improve
a bit when not towing and the 4.56 should improve towing MPG a
noticable amount. A engine uses the less amout of fuel per HP hour
producted when it is operating near it torque peak (which is also were
peek VE occurs) and seen the Hemis is at about 4000 RPM you never
realy get there ever in daily driving and going through gear getting
moving with a 3.54.  With a 4.56 you should be able to tow 8 to 10,000
lbs without too much fuss, even in hilly terrain and still cruise
nicely in OD.

These "rated" towing ratings are not based on any real science
because some of them are overly generous. THey do not factor in wind
drag (because a 8k low profile load on a flat bed will tow easier that
a 6k high profile travel trailer) and whether ground is hilly or flat
is a factor too Also if a vehicial can tow 5k well, 6k will not break
the bank.  Personally I do not care what any factory tow guide says
because a hemi in a big SUV with 32 inch tires and a 3.54 axle ratio
will have a tuff time with a 5k travel trailer especaily if there is
hills. Tires have gotten bigger and trucks heavier but axle ratios
have generally stayed the same. To me a good tow vehical for the
weight being towed can tow the load up just about any hill on you will
see on the interstate without downshifting below drive and not have to
be floorboarded either. If you are reaching for the floor and/or
second gear a lot you have exceeded your capacity. WHen you gear axle
lower/deeper it does two things, it increases the amount of wheel
torque put down to ground in any selected gear and it allows the
engine to crank up a little more and to be closer to its torque peak
when climbing a hill in drive at speed which gives you maximum pulling
power.

A very general and unfounded statement. new 1/2 tons are usually
geared to squeak that last 1/4 mpg out on the rigged EPA MPG dyno
test.  I half ton truck with 31 ot 32’s tire on a heavy extended or
crew cab with 3.42 (GM) or 3.54 (Ford/Chysler) makes a poor towing
platform for a 5000lb travel trailer. I recently drove a new chevy Z71
extendend cab with a 310hp rated aluminum V8 and 3.42 gears. It was
very strong above 3000RPM  if you wound it out in 1st and second but
it was lacking in drive and a flat out snail in 4th/OD. I shudder to
think how poorly it would tow a 5k travel trailer than it is rated to
tow. A Hemi in a CC dodge truck with 3.54 gears would be about the
same or maybe just a tiny bit better. I do not care if it is rated at
345hp or so above 5000RPM as you do not tow at 5000 RPM and it is
seriously lacking below 3000 RPM too. Dodge has really screwed some
truck owners with that combo. It would be more managible if they would
increase the Hemi’s displacement in the truck by 30 or 40 cubic inches
but I do not see that happening. It is like they are forcing your hand
into a profitable (for them) $6 or7k option Cummins if you want to tow
anything of any real weight  while you add an extra 600 lbs to front
end of truck too. They could offer more axle ratio option for the gas
engine but then that might take away Cummins sales. There is a crew
cab 1 ton dualie at a dealr near her with a Hemi in it and it has been
sitting there for about 8 months now. We drove it for grins when my
freind was looking at Cummins power trucks and it was a bit of a slug
and would be a joke with a big trailer on it too. When Dodge replaced
the V10 with the Hemi in a truck they really screwd up because the V10
might have used a bit more gas but it would pull very strongly too,
much better than the higher HP rated hemi that replaced it.

THis is a great misconseption. People tend to operate that big 4x4SUV
need tall gears for good gas mileage. It dependend on engine type and
its power curve and size and truck type and configuration as to the
best gearing. A oil burner that reaches peak VE at a very low RPM will
do better with taller gears (to a point) than a small gas engine will
(and yes the 5.7 Hemi is a small engine with little low speed torque)
A big gass engine with a lower RPM power a torque peak might do better
MPG wise too (again to a point) but a engine that does not see its
torque peak until 4000 RPM and its power peak beyond 5000rpm will not
do better with tall gears in a SUV in the real world.  Optimum overall
MPG with the truck in question will be between 4.10 and 4.56 with OD
in use (with OD a 4.10 will be about a 3 to 1 and a 4.56 will be about
a 3.36 effect ratio wise) which is better for a truck that size,
especailly the later with 32 inch tires. The logic that applies to a
streamlined car in drive ratios does not apply to a truck

A K&amp;N’s (like dual exhausts) is more a state on mind on a modern well

You just need a truck prperly geared that all because if it was it
would not be floor boarded and done shifting with only a 6k trailer
which is kinda light for the properly configured fullsized SUV. 20
years ago I used to tow a 4 horse trailer a LOT with a old (then
fairly new) 79 J20 jeep. A trailer like that can weight 8 to 9K loaded
depending on animal size and tack. I NEVER had problems hould speed on
hills with it lowly rated 175hp AMC 360. That motor had goobs of
torque for its size at low to mid RPMs and pulled extremely will with
its 3.73 gears and 30 inch tires and no OD. I got 11 to 12 towing too.
I have hauled a full sized pickup on a car hauler behind my 89 4x4
burb a few times and it would easily do hiway speeds and hold it on
hills without floor boarding either. It has 29’s with 3.73 gears (see
a pattern yet)  Gearing matched to engines power curve is EVERYTHING
when towing or you can dismiss its importance and keep floorboarding
it and getting passed while watching the gas gauge drop and blame the
tranny as being junk on day with it starts acting up because it
certainly could not be anything else causing it. I would be imbarrased
to drive a fancy SUV that cannot get out of its own way towing because
it is nt properly equiped for the task.

The reason it easily bogs is because it is geared to tall for load. I
can remember some family sedan in the  60’s and early 70’s that had
more towing power than some of these new "trucks". I get and have
trucks for towing power not a "car" in a trucks clothing with tall
gears. Reprogramming the tranny will not "fix" anything because it
is the torque load on it relative to effective gear ratios to
control/develop proper towing power for the load in question. There is
nothing more imbarassing than have a big fancy SUV that is marginal
towing when taking the time to properly regear for the load it can
make it into a very nice towing platform. And the funny part about
this is that 20 to 30 years ago we had to use 4.10 and 4.56 gears with
29 or 30 inch tires too for really big trailers, we did not have a OD
to mitigate it when cruising and now today people think they need a
3.54 or a 3.73 AND OD with 32 inch tires and wonder why the towing is
lacking. If I was going to tow any serious weight with a Hemi (which
really is a poor tow engine because of it power curve) in a SUV like a
CC truck, I would have 4.56 gear put in and and be done with it. This
would yeild about 3100 RPM in drive at 65 for pretty good power on a
steep hill (closer to engine power band) and 2300 RPM or so in OD for
flat land towing or not towing at all.  It would "play" pretty will
with that engine power curve and give you a SUV that actually can get
out of its own way with or without a trailer in tow. Least not forget
to the HP is basically torque x RPM and that at 3100RPM on a hill or
2300 in OD you will have a LOT more HP availble at the wheels than you
will at 2700 and 1900 with 3.92’s and will not even comment on the
what 3.54’s are like because it shoud have never been it truck to
begin with as it should have shipped with at least 3.92’s as standard
because 3.54 are a joke in that setup and vehical with that engine.

ok if thats your feeling then dont buy one to pull your 5,000 lb trailer..if
you want to put a tire 3 inches taller than the factory desighned and rated
its towing figures at then that's up to you. but dont complain because the
gearing isnt right when you change the final gear by changing tire
size/height. keep in mind a taller tire takes away from the rear gear thats
just simple math!

ive owned several 1/2 tons and been very pleased with the towing
capabilities with them infact one of the best towing vehicles was a chevy
s10 with the 4.3 and auto trans. the owners manual rated the truck at 6k
with the low gear whitch mine had. i pulled a 24 foot camper (not ultra lite
model either mind you) a 25 foot macgreggor sail boat with the lead swing
keel, and my tractor behind that truck. with all of these regular loads it
performed to expectations. was it always fast? No. but if you were pulling
well more than your own weight you wouldnt be either.

now on the other end of the scale was a 86 d100 slant 6 3speed auto. it seen
the tractor and 24 foot pontoon boat on a regular basis. needless to say the
poor ole truck was having to grunt but it did the job. and i knew what i
had. i knew the take offs were slow and the top speed was low.
and i mean low but hey it was what i had at the time. but truth be told i
was asking the truck to do way more than it was ever desighned to do. i have
no idea what the ratings on that truck was, and am scared to ask.

so you see im not saying that all 1/2 tons are suited for that sort of load
but a properly equiped one should handle it very well, also you should note
that im also saying with ANY tow vehicle you should know your rig and load
and drive the combonation appropriately (yes i know i cant spell).

I recently drove a new chevy Z71

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; extendend cab with a 310hp rated aluminum V8 and 3.42 gears. It was
&gt; very strong above 3000RPM  if you wound it out in 1st and second but
&gt; it was lacking in drive and a flat out snail in 4th/OD. I shudder to
&gt; think how poorly it would tow a 5k travel trailer than it is rated to
&gt; tow.

What? you want it to perform like a sports car while pulling to near full
capacity on oversized tires????

A Hemi in a CC dodge truck with 3.54 gears would be about the

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; same or maybe just a tiny bit better. I do not care if it is rated at
&gt; 345hp or so above 5000RPM as you do not tow at 5000 RPM and it is
&gt; seriously lacking below 3000 RPM too. Dodge has really screwed some
&gt; truck owners with that combo. It would be more managible if they would
&gt; increase the Hemi's displacement in the truck by 30 or 40 cubic inches
&gt; but I do not see that happening.

if that's your feeling then you dont have to buy the HEMI.....dont worry it
wont break my heart

It is like they are forcing your hand

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; into a profitable (for them) $6 or7k option Cummins if you want to tow
&gt; anything of any real weight  while you add an extra 600 lbs to front
&gt; end of truck too. They could offer more axle ratio option for the gas
&gt; engine but then that might take away Cummins sales. There is a crew
&gt; cab 1 ton dualie at a dealr near her with a Hemi in it and it has been
&gt; sitting there for about 8 months now. We drove it for grins when my
&gt; freind was looking at Cummins power trucks and it was a bit of a slug
&gt; and would be a joke with a big trailer on it too. When Dodge replaced
&gt; the V10 with the Hemi in a truck they really screwd up because the V10
&gt; might have used a bit more gas but it would pull very strongly too,
&gt; much better than the higher HP rated hemi that replaced it.
">

if you dont like the extra wieght on the front axle you dont have to buy the
comings either.

now weither you like what ive said or not....its really no skin off my nose.
thats the way i see it take it or leave it
read the information provided by the manufactures ect for your self and make
your own decisions as to what's the choices for you.

&gt;&gt;If you live in Montana, and routinely cruise along at 85 mph,

&gt; Guess you have never lived there, I have and the faster you go the
&gt; more power it takes though some think otherwise. Drag is not constant
&gt; and it climbs A LOT after 70 MPH or so AND most of Montana is about
&gt; 4000 to 6000 feet above sea level (except for eastern plain and the
&gt; high line) and your engine loses power as you go up in altitude
&gt; (approx 3% per 1000 ft)  and no tweaking will make up for the loss
&gt; either. Also the higher you go and the thinner the air the more you
&gt; need gears to haul the load especailly on hills. You REALLY feel it
&gt; above 8000 feet or so when you suddenly realize that you have been
&gt; floor boarded on a long hard climb but did not know it because the
&gt; engine does not sound floorboarded because it is down on power so
&gt; much. At time like this you want all the gears you can get sometimes
&gt; and OD would be totally useless above 5000 feet or so in a 4x4 unless
&gt; you are geared pretty deep to begin with. In the old day (from about
&gt; the 50's through mid 70's or so) trucks that used to ship to higher
&gt; elevations from factory came with deeper gears to offset power loss
&gt; but as emmission and MPG rating tightened they phased it out to ease
&gt; certification.
">

ok... Replace Montana with Texas/New Mexico or Kansas.

As for gearing, My truck has no trouble doing 70-80. if I changed from 3.55
to 3.92, the RPMs would increase by 20% But Im pretty sure I will not gain
20 more power, so I will just be spinning the engine faster and burning more
gas.
If I was pulling a lot, then I would go to the 3.92s in a heart beat if I
couldn't get a bigger truck. Given I hardly drive the truck as it is, I
could get the 3.92s installed and not see much of a hit in my annual fuel
consumption anyways.

I used to cruise 80 and 85 with 4.10’s and no OD for years!!! I pulled
the engine after 150K to build it up some and found no real cyclinder
wear and bearing were great. You may spin it faster but it it carring
less load to cruise truck because it has to develope less cylinder
pressure to cruise at a higher RPM to cruise witch means less bearing
and piston ring pressure too. Goinf from a 3.55 to a 3.91 is about 11%
not 20 % and truck will cruise eaiser and OD will work better and MPG
will likel improve too if it is a heavy truck. A 3.55 was a compromise
gear in a 4x4 when ther was no OD but it is a waste on a big 4x4 with
OD unless you place very low standards on performance. MY k3500 has
4.10 with 30’s and it turns about 2500 at 70mph and will cruise nicely
at any speed you choose to without complaint and pulls OD fairly well
too even on hills with AC on (it never doneshifts unless you have a
really big load on a steep hiway hill. I can bury the speedo without
using OD to with 4.10’s. You must remeber that if you have one of
those hemi’s its power peak is past 5000 RPM and it torque peak is
around 4000 rpm and if you are stuck on 2000 to 2400 RPM cruises at 70
to 85 mph, you are only developing about maybe 100HP or so at the rear
wheel at those speed and that RPM of you are lucky and this is why
towing can really suck. Even the old 360 had more torque below 3000
rpm where you spend most of your time than the new Hemi. People look
at the HP rating but they do not factor how it all come it to play and
how much of it is usable towing as they think 345 HP is 345 hp all the
time not when it is wound to the max. That kind of power curve would
be nice in a sleek car but not of much use in a heavy truck that needs
strong low and mid range toque so performance and MPG can suffer.  Man
a old 300 HP V10 truck engine would badly wipe the floor with hemi
towing big time and so would even a GM6.0 because its power peaks
about 1000 RPM sooner and it deleivers more towing power though it is
rated lower HP wise than the hemi. THings are not that cut and dried
in the HP game.

That would be why I don't like the lil Hondas... I don't like winding out
the engine to make power. I like it nice and low. just like the big rigs...
they only have 200, 300, 400 HP, but have 700-2000 ft-lb of torque! that
will make anyone smile!!!

I just went out yesterday to retrive a fullsized 4x4 on a car hauler
and haul it 50 miles in 93 degrees heat on interstate hills. (it could
have been 250 miles with the same outcome) The combine towed weight
was around 7500 lbs. My truck never got one needle width above normal
the whole time (never hit 200 by my gauge) and we were "chillin" big
time too and I was not using recirculate either for A/C and it was
cold the way I like it on a hot day.  My tow vehical was a 2000 chevy
K3500 with a 255hp rated 350 with a factory aux tranny cooler, engine
oil cooler, a factory HD engine cooling with a 10 bladed clutch fan
and 4.10 gears. We did the legal limit and then some towing and never
left OD except for one very long steep hill and then I was able to
easilly hold speed with very limited throttle in drive.  At no time at
all was I anywhere near floor boarded. The reason I post this is not
to compare GM to Dodge but to compare gearing and engine power curves
and setups when towing. My engines torque peak is rated at about 3000
RPM and when running 70 MPH in OD it is turning about 2500RPM and has
good torque because it is close to its peak. If I drop out of OD to
drive at 70 it shows about 3100 or so on tach and it is right in the
engines sweet spot and it will pull there hard there smoothly and all
day if need be without much fuss or running any warmer. To tow well
you have to match the engines power curve to the load with proper
gearing. If you have a engine with a 4000 RPM torque peak and a power
peak above 5000 RPM, you are not going to have good towing performace
or MPG while towing with tall gears and lower RPM’s. I will not own a
truck that will not tow well and keep its cool no matter how hard I
pull it because that is what I buy trucks for.

This all means that is the truck is properly geared for the load towed
the is will do well and that a 255hp rated truck tow much better than
a 345HP rated truck that is not geared for the load. It is a poor
shoice by the manufacture to "sell" a truck as powerfull with a big
HP rating when its power cuvre is such that its rated power is no
where near usable towing. Towing with a Hemi at 2500 RPM or less you
are luck if you are putting much over 100HP at the wheels at 2500 RPM
because since the engines rated torque peak is a 4200 and power peak a
5400 it will be making  considerably less torque and HP below 3000rpm
where 99% of the towing takes place. If you have a big load to haul
with one, you want to be geared so that your RPM’s are above above
3000 RPM at 65 to 70 in drive (not OD) if you want reasonable pulling
power on a long hill. If you are turning less, you are losing towing
power and MPG under a load because engine is operating well below its
peak  VE RPM which means power output will be low and fuel consumption
will be higher too.
