This morning I received an invitation from Fujitsu to attend the Oracle
OpenWorld 07 event in San Francisco next month.

I would go, but I'm far too busy at the moment.

Nevertheless, it was interesting to see how Fujitsu are moving to SOA in
partnership with Oracle and most of what's going on there is SOA oriented.

As I looked through the agenda the following caught my eye...

&quot;Fujitsu is eco-friendly too!
Fujitsu premieres the world's first laptop housing made from cornstarch
(bio-based plastic). Come see it and our space-and energy-efficient
PRIMERGY® TX120 tower server in the Eco-Friendly section of the Inside
Innovation area at Oracle OpenWorld. &quot;

The latest notebook I have (Vaio AR250G - I call it Bigblack) is made from
kevlar.

Now, I don't know about you folks, but if I have a choice between cornstarch
or kevlar, I think I'd prefer to have something that can stop a bullet for
me, should the need arise... :-)

Is this politically correct eco thing just getting silly, or have Fujitsu
tapped into something that is really serious and important?

Comments?

Pete.

Isn't that a redundant question?

Actually, I'd say, no, it isn't &quot;just getting&quot; silly, it's *been* silly
for a long time.  But, the durability may not be a big deal to some
people - I've known of at least 4 people who have laptops, and hardly
ever (if that) take them out of the docking station.

Think of the biodegradable laptop - better not spill any water on it!  :)

Thank you :-)

(Funny thing... I accidentally dropped it about 3 feet onto a coffee table
tonight...  turned it on with fear and trepidation, having visions of months
of work disappearing (yes, I normally back up current projects to DVD every
week or so, But I've been ill lately so it is a few weeks since a
backup....) it is functioning perfectly (and the first thing I did was back
up the current project :-)). Don't know if it was the kevlar or if I was
just lucky, but I guess it says something for SONY build quality... Betcha
cornstarch would've shattered...popcorn!)

I doubt if the laptop casing, being made of a cornstarch polymer, is
any more politically correct than the kevlar one that you own. Based
on a position of total ignorance, my suspicion is that cornstarch
polymers are no more bio-degradable than any other plastic.

However, you can rest easy knowing that the source of the cornstarch
is actively depleting the increased CO2 levels although the freight-
miles would negate that gain and make it negligible in the overall
equation.

Your suspicion is wrong, cornstarch 'plastic' IS biodegradable. The polymer is not
synthesized from cornstarch. Starches (along with proteins and DNA) are natural polymers.
Picture a starch molecule as several thousand paper clips hooked together, where each
paper clip represents a glucose molecule.

Freight is a minor 10% of the energy equation -- 6,000 BTU per bushel containing 30 lbs of

Paper is not biodegradable. In old landfills, one can pull out a fifty year old phone
books that are easily readable. Cellulose is like starch in that both are long chain
polymers of glucose. They differ in that cellulose is not water soluble. If it were, trees
would droop and fall over, wooden ships would sink, cotton clothes would dissolve in the
wash.  What makes a chemical water soluble is free polarized sites for hydrogen bonds and
internal bonds weak enough to achieve a lower entropy state. This isn't a an appropriate
forum for technical chemistry/physics. Grazing animals, termites and decaying wood break
down cellulose with enzymes produced by microbes which are generally not found in
landfills.

Cornstarch 'plastic' would not work for Coke bottles, but IS used for milk bottles which
have a one week shelf life. It is commonly used for bags.

Chromium is an ESSENTIAL micronutrient. Without it, you wouldn't be able to metabolize
sugar.

No one has reliable body counts on either. Lead doesn't kill, it causes nerve and
developmental defects in children. The bad form of chromium does kill via lung cancer when
inhaled; when not inhaled, it causes blindness when rubbed in the eyes and contact
dermatitis when it gets on skin.

The greatest chromium risk outside the workplace is from welding or cutting stainless
steel. When heated to high temperatures (way above cooking), 'good' chromium in stainless
steel is turned into the 'bad' (6) form.

&gt;&gt; chrome yellow, which is lead chromate. The environmental danger there
&gt;&gt; is from lead, not chromium. Chromium has two isomers, one good and
&gt;&gt; the other bad. The bad one, called hexavalent chromium, was seen in
&gt;&gt; Erin Brockovich. The good one is found in chrome yellow and chromium
&gt;&gt; picolinate pills sold as a diet supplement.

&gt; More people have died from contact with chrome than ever got bothered by
&gt; lead.

Especially chrome moving at a high rate of speed.

For comparison, there are two trillion barrels of crude oil in Colorado's oil shale, and
one trillion in Canada's oil sands. That's six times total reserves in the Middle East.
The US consumes seven billion barrels per year. We have a 400 year supply.

The other variable getting too little publicity is the amount of fuel
used to create nitrate fertilizer to grow the biomass.

One of the solutions to the CO2 problem is to plow biomass under after
harvest.   Of course that means those stalks aren't used to create

It does get a mention this side of the pond.

&gt; One of the solutions to the CO2 problem is to plow biomass under after

Not a solution merely a short-term delay loop. The CO2 will come out
of the ground again.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;However, you can rest easy knowing that the source of the cornstarch

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;equation.

&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Freight is a minor 10% of the energy equation -- 6,000 BTU per bushel containing 30 lbs of
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; starch. Fertilizer is the greatest energy consumer. If we were smart, we'd make ethanol
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and plastic from grass and wood. We don't because there's no grass lobby clamoring for
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; support.

&gt;Added to which there is a possibility that trucking biomass around to
&gt;synthesizer plants may consume more fuel than it generates. There was
&gt;a recent (in the last two years) Scientific American podcast going
&gt;into detail about the economics of biofuels. It made for gloomy
&gt;listening.

Most studies on energy and environment are BIASED by:

.. Commercial self-interest
.. Anti-commercial sentiment in academia, idealism
.. Culture, nationalism
.. Competing scientific/engineering specialties

Compounding the problem is lack of information about petroleum. We don't know how much is
down there nor how it was formed. If you think it was formed by biomass, read this
impartial article about alternative hypotheses:

Porphyrins are a class of molecules found in both biological and non-biological carbon
systems. Chlorophyll is the principal form in plants; heme is the principal form in
animals. The difference between the two is that chlorophyll has an atom of magnesium in
the middle while heme has an atom of iron. Changing one atom would turn you into a plant.
The porphyrins in petroleum have an atom of vanadium or nickel in the middle. Both metals
are toxic to large plants and animals. The only life form using them are archaea, a
pre-bacteria living mostly near the Earth's mantle. Archaea create methane. The same
porphyrins have been found in the cores of more than a hundred meteorites, which are
obviously? created by geology rather than biology.

&gt;&gt; &gt;Every percentage point counts. After all: look after the pennies and

&gt;&gt; &gt;There is little to feel good about but I think that the worlsd is
&gt;&gt; &gt;coming around to the view that we can use straw and cellulose to
&gt;&gt; &gt;produce ethanol and electricity. Amazing that it has taken them so
&gt;&gt; &gt;long.

&gt;&gt; As an outside figure, if ALL grassland and suitable woodland in the US produced cellulose
&gt;&gt; for ethanol, the 1 billion tons of biomass would displace 30% of US petroleum consumption. http://www.ethanolrfa.org/resource/cellulosic/

&gt;I take it that this refers to currently unused resources?

Yes.

Sounds like scaremongering from the petro industry. Wheat is a high protein grain. Using
it for fuel is like burning furniture for heat.

When computer tapes were first made, by IBM in the early '50s, the substrate was cellulose
acetate. There certainly ARE microbes that can break the bonds in cellulose and eat the
sugar components.

In the mid '50s, DuPont invented Mylar, which is a petrochemical polyester. IBM switched
computer tapes to Mylar in the late '50s. If memory serves, I could be wrong, consumer
grade audio tapes did not switch to Mylar until the late '60s. Microbes cannot eat the
polyester monomer ( polyethylene terephthalate) because it doesn't have  any glycosidic
bonds.

The author of that novel mistakenly ASSumed computer tapes were made from the same stuff
as audio tapes.

The theory about a non-biotic origin for oils in the crust is not new.
Nor is it accepted as the origin of the petroleum. It would, if true,
allow us to create endless quantities of petroleum if we could inject
methane (a greenhouse gas) into the crust. That sounds something like
a perpetual motion machine to me (something for nothing).

The scientist concerned was not scaremongering but merely questioning
the mathematics of the biofuel lobbyists. I agree with your simile.
Far better to grow long-stemmed wheats and use the wheat straw (mostly
cellulose) to generate ethanol.
