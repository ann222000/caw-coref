Ingredients:

1 prepared, baked pie shell
1 (8 oz.) pkg. cream cheese, room temperature
2/3 c. sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
2 eggs, separated, room temperature

until creamy. Add yolks and beat until smooth. Mix in melted chocolate

peaks form.

3. Gently fold 1/4 of whites into chocolate mixture; fold in rest of
whites.

4. Whip 1 cup cream to firm peaks. Fold cream and nuts into chocolate.
