Just acquired my nice dead MDD dual 1.25...  and after a few things
thought I'd bounce it off the list members...
Ok, here goes:
Before powering up, replaced pram battery and reset PMU just for
kicks. Then, after 10 minutes or so, tried to boot up. What I got was
a nice startup chime, fans running at low speed, cpu heats up warm,
Disk drive spins (pretty sure) but nothing on the screen.. nice and
black.. then I shut down and proceeded to R&amp;R all the modules along
with a bit of cleaning. There is 1280mb of ram and I figured since I
got no &quot;beeps&quot; at startup, the processor and ram are ok (i hope) At
this point, I'm leaning towards video card or logic board. what do ya
think? Jeff

Maybe you have tried already, but R&amp;R the G4 itself (carefully, of
course), re-apply some 'thermal paste' between the G4 &amp; Heat Sink.

When you have the G4 out, examine closely for discolored pins (may be
an indication of 'oxidization' problems. Not likely, because of the
pins being 'Gold' plated, but at this point you are looking for he
'unlikely'.
