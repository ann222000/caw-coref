Got up to 3k to spend but thinking of insurance and tax want to the engine
size down, Was thinking of a Megane or a Xsara but would appreciate advice
on what to look for faultwise in these two or should I be looking at
something else?

You should definitely be looking at something else.

A 1.4 family hatch will be fairly sluggish. If you regularly actually travel
with a family, or live somewhere hilly, a bigger engine would be better.

Do you have problems with a poor insurance record? If not, why don't you get
a few quotes from somewhere like confused.com for identical cars with
different engine sizes. The cost difference may be less than you would
think.

The difference in cost of a road fund licence between cars is not really
significant over the course of a year; it certainly wouldn't influence me
to drive something I didn't really like!

If you can consider upping your engine size limitation a bit, my vote would
go for a 1.6 Focus.

Okay - nice idea in theory, but in practice, it'll make very little
difference whatsoever to running costs.  Depreciation will hurt a lot more,
and entry level hatchbacks are not a popular used buy.  As Chris says,
something more mid-range (1.6) is usually a better bet.

This all said, not all 1.4s in the range are all that sluggish in the
context of their peers, if you see what I mean.  A 1.4 Corolla is pokey for
a 1.4 small family car, whereas a 1.4 Focus is tepid.  Plus for most buyers,
performance is largely academic: if performance were an issue you'd be
having the 2.0+ turbo, right? :-p

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There are stacks of smaller engined hatches and all share the same traits as
their greater engined cousins.  The Focus is a favourite, but is better (in
my opinion) as a Zetec with air conditioning.  There are 1.4 Zetecs about,
there are also 1.4s with air conditioning, but they're rare.

Also have a look at the previous generation Astra, which is in my opinion
9/10th the car of the Focus for about 6/10th the price.

Some people may think the Golf is a sensible option.  Not me: if you want
VAG technology, the Leon is a better option to the Golf.  The Octavia better
still.

If you can find one, a 1.4 Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic are solid, boring,
reliable option.

Finally - cars from the next size up (Mondeo class) are usually better value
for a relatively small increase in running costs.

MK4  Astra 1.4 16v.  Excellent car, cheap insurance, £140 tax and
economical.  Faster than the 1.6 8v and the 1.7TDi.  You will get a 4 year
old with hardly any miles on it for nearer £2k.
The 1.6 16v even goes for £2.5k at 3 years old, so get shopping about.
Parts are really cheap and if you know anyone working for Vauxhall you get a
30% discount at the dealership for parts if you DIY.

Late model Rover 414 / MG ZS. Probably the quickest of the bunch and nice to
drive, should be well toyed up as they were almost giving them away. Just
remember to check oil and coolant regularly and thrash it all the time.

You clueless cunt.

Fabia is based on Polo mechanicals. You've had this pointed out
elsewhere.

FWIW, I've been pricing up Skodas this weekend and found them to be just
about the same price as an equivalent VW these days.

Get the 1.9 Diesel Xsara rather than the 1.4. It's a ZX based car and if the
engines are the same, the power output is identical but I'd go for the
diesel everytime. IME with piffly little engines the diesel always seems
better to drive.

Should have given a few more details. Vehicle is unlikely to venture far,
probably 80 mile round trip at most on A roads. Just me and a friend going
fishing/walking. Under 4k miles a year I guess. Likely to keep for many
years so looking for a low mileage or older car with cam belt already
replaced. Other than that don`t mind getting my hands dirty on easy to
medium rated jobs. Thanks for all comments so far. Certainly opened my eyes

Bargain if a cambelt hasn't been changed - plus many cars have chain cams

And having driven the Fabia, Golf and Leon as hire cars last year.....  I'd
vote for the Golf or Leon.  All are pretty much 'the same car' except I

Look for a 1.6 SXi, that way you get the nice seats. Important if you're

If cambelt changes are a problem, note that the interval for the 1.6 Focus I
suggested is 100,000 miles, or 10 years. Some of its competitors will be
almost due for their third one by this time...

Hmm based on what your requirement are, I'd personally go for a Citroen
ZX 1.9 Diesel, you can get them for about £500, or a 306 which will cost
you a bit more. Believe it or not, you can still see a low mileage ten
year old 306 turbodiesels for £2k which is a bit extreme though, I reckon.

Check to see if it's got the Bosch inline fuel pump (not the Lucas
rotory one) and you could run it on veg oil/diesel blend too, if that
tickles your fancy.

Like my old company Astra. When I got it the timing belt interval was
quoted at 80k miles. Then suddenly Vauxhall decided it should be 40k
miles, when I'd done about 55k. So my belt was suddenly 15k overdue...

&gt; Get the 1.9 Diesel Xsara rather than the 1.4. It's a ZX based car and
&gt; if the engines are the same, the power output is identical but I'd go
&gt; for the diesel everytime.

They were, in the earlier 1.9D/TD Xsara - later ones used the HDi. Three
grand should easily see an HDi.

A 1.9D (non-turbo) Xsara is a total slug. It was bad enough in the ZX, but
the Xsara's much heavier. I prefer the ZX, tbh, and three grand should buy
several very nice ZXs.

That's because they kept breaking before 80k miles.

&gt; &gt; OR a Skoda Fabia - the intelligent man's Golf!  Why pay more for a VW badge?

&gt; Except that the Octavia is based on the Golf, not the Fabia... And the
&gt; interior design is horrible on the Skodas, the Fabia gear stick is
&gt; horrible, for example.
">

I've just bought one on an 04.

I will now of course stand up and defend it to the ends of the earth,
just to reassure myself I've made the right choice. ;-)

Interior wise, it's actually quite nicely finished - the gearknob...
if you're that bothered, can be changed for something else, and is
hardly a mission to do.

Personally, mine works and isn't exactly horrid to the touch, so it
can stay.

The steering wheel also seems a bit cheap, but then it's a small hatch
- they do tend to be built down to a price.

The middle dash vents seem a bit low on output - I believe this is a
Fabia failing, and due to some of the air ducting flaps under the dash
not working as they should do.

Seems to be a common fault if you look on the Briskoda webshite,
anyway.

The dash itself is fine - the instrument pod appears to be the same as
what was found in the Mk4 Golf, albeit with different graphics and
green back lighting.

The stereo / speakers are fine for the class as well - bass units and
separate tweeters front and back.

One of the other cars I was considering when I bought this was a new
shape Fiesta - I reckon they're a better looking car on the outside,
but inside they're a lot more plasticky, and not in a good way; the
door cards look especially nasty.

&gt; You should definitely be looking at something else.

&gt; A 1.4 family hatch will be fairly sluggish. If you regularly actually

I'd agree- I've just gone from a grp9 to grp15 car, and it made about 60

The Fabia is a group 4 and is £400 cheaper a year than the Vectra it
replaced, which was group 10 and with 50% NCB in place on both.

The Vectra, which was a 1.9 CDTI 120 was group 10... and £200 a year
more than a group 11 Pug 406 HDI with the same insurance company.

They obviously don't like Vectras methinks... and nor do I,
actually. :-)
