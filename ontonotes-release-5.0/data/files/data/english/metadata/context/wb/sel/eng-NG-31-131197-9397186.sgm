Wednesday, 10/10/07.  I went to Arline's class in Largo, Florida last  night
and we learned Rebel Amor/Verdonk-Bos/B-I.  This one has gotten quite  a bit
of attention here and there.  It is 64 counts but quite easy and  Arline said
the music reminded her of music when she was growing up in  Panama.  I think
almost any high beg/low int class could do it and there's  no tags or restarts.
We also reviewed Guardian Angel (I just love this  dance), Nacho Daddy, Ain't
Got No Money, Do It, Sail Away Cha and a bunch of  others we are doing to
prepare for the Tampa event.  If you're going to  Tampa and live close enough,
you will enjoy Arline's Tuesday class and be  prepared to dance a bunch of the
dances we will be doing.
I'm going to  finish a job I have to finish this morning and will spend this
afternoon writing  the report from Windy City.  I'll send it out in a separate
e-mail.  I  sent info below on how to order the DVD and Step Sheet CD from
the  event.   There were 91 dances taught that are on the DVD.

Subject: TOPIC FOR DISCUSSION (changing a line  dance to a partner dance)
Well, I have been guilty of such several times. We  teach mainly partner
dances and have other instructors teach the line at the  various places we work
but we always try to keep a partner and line on the floor  at all times. To make
this happen, on occasion we have adapted a line dance for  the partner. I try
to keep the flavor of the line dance while making it  interesting for the
partner – not just take the line and repeat the steps for  the partner. What I
always do, however is get in touch with the original line  dance choreographer,
send a prelim copy of the adapted partner and ask  permission if it is ok to
put the partner version out there. To date, have not  been denied permission -
it also gets additional exposure for their line  dance.
Back in the early/mid 90’s, we choreographed companion partner/line to  keep
both on the floor but as dancing evolved and more and more line dances were
choreographed, we shifted to mainly partner choreography to give the many
partner dancers the opportunity to do a greater variety of dances to do
throughout the night.

SUBJECT: CHANGING A LINE DANCE TO A PARTNER DANCE
FROM: WANDA  F IN ALA (_ADA ... @AOL.COM_ (mailto:ADA ... @AOL.COM)
I belong to a club that does a lot of patterned partner  dances. I don't have
a partner and wait out 3 or 4 dances on any given evening.  If they alter a
line dance then I get to dance the original choreography.  Personally, I feel
that choreographing a dance is much like giving birth to a  child. You send it
out into the world hoping it won't change too much.  Eventually, if you are
lucky, dancers accept it as theirs and you have a legacy.  I don't think a
choreographer can own the step pattern to the point one would  have to ask
permission. The best one can hope for is that they are acknowledged  as the creator of
the line dance that the couples variation came from.

_joha ... @dancewhatyoufeel.com_ (mailto:joha ... @dancewhatyoufeel.com)
Mark, Eve, Glen and their Windy City Line Dance Mania Staff get an A++! The
hotel's a/c system got a D- but that was out of their control as well as the
unseasonably hot weather in Chicago for this time of year! Louis and Jill each
get an A+ for playing all of our requests in both rooms, and for making it
fun  to dance all the new stuff we'd learned, the dances we have in our general
arsenal, and some great classics that we weren't sure we still knew how to
do!  For example, Saturday night in Jill's room we danced Shattered,
Infatuation  (love my CA ladies that still love that dance and make me do it every
time!),  Swingin R's, and Suds in the Bucket. In Louis' ballroom, just before
making us  go to bed @ 5:30am, we danced selections like, Am 2 Pm, Cha Cha Tonight,
Sex  Machine, Stop It, Speechless, S.X.E., and Party 'Til Dawn. I noticed
lots of  floor sharing to certain songs, and up to 4 dances were being done
simultaneously! So many great dances were taught, and there was ample  opportunity
for review and dancing them. I love that Blue Finger Lou is making a
come-back! There was a general mix of all styles, rythms and difficulty. This  was
demonstrated in the choreography competition as well. Congrats to all who
participated, and I suggest taking a look at Evelyn Haling's dance, Turnip  Greens.
I was able to catch her teach during the competition, and the country  track
&quot;Good Directions&quot; by Billy Currington, paired with a really unique and
learnabe dance (complete with a U-Turn), is definitely one to look at! I thought  my
dinner was perfectly prepared and tasty, and it was nice to have it served
instead of a buffet. Registration seemed to go smoothly and I love that
everyone  has a name badge stating where they're from as well. It's great to be able
to  sneak a peak at that info to jog the memory and it's also a great
conversation  starter! The floors were great, H2O and cups never seemed to run out,
and  everything seemed to run on time. The show was hilarious, entertaining, and
memorable for sure! Doug Miranda hosted his Toy Collection (really, they
were  all brilliant! - Spider Man (Guyton), G.I. Joey, and Ken &amp; Barbie
(Amato's),  Brian Barakauskas continues to make me proud to be a line dance competitor
from  the U.S., and Rachael McEnaney blew me away with her new routine. There
is  something about this event, that makes it tops on my list of &quot;must attend&quot;
if at  all possible. Maybe it's the set-up of all workshop and ballrooms in
one  hallway, or the smoothness and organization with which the event runs, or
maybe  it's the energy that somehow these event directors attract to Chicago.
It's  evident in the the Thursday night dance with a packed house. They
definitely  'make the grade'!

Subject: Changing a line dance to a pattern dance
From: Pat  Pallas, Sauble Beach, On

A number of years ago my  husband and I were asked to teach a couple's
pattern dance at an event. At the  time Swing Your Chains was a very popular line
dance and so we adapted it to a  pattern dance that could travel around the line
of dance. However, prior to  using it or submitting it on Kickit, I emailed
the choreographers, letting them  know and asking it they would be Okay with
it. They responded very positively  and asked for a copy. When we wrote up the
step sheet we acknowledged John and  Dee as the original choreographers.
Hope this helps others avoid any  problems,

SUBJECT:   TOPIC OF DISCUSSION
FROM:  _McKittric ... @aol.com_ (mailto:McKittric ... @aol.com)
Many years ago when I  first started teaching the understanding was if you
changed
a dance, added  steps or readjusted them, you should give the dance a new
name.
However, if  it is just an adaptation with no extra steps added or detracted
they might
contact the choeographer if possible. The step sheet they are changing
belongs to
the choreographer/choreographers, therefore, they should be  contacted,
common
courtesy.
I have turned a four wall dance into a two  wall dance, by merely not doing a
quarter
turn at the end of the dance. I  only did this for my beginner Senior class.
I teach
it as a four wall for  all other classes. I am sure they will never do the
dance anywhere
else.

FROM:  JILL BABINEC
WINDY CITY  THANKS:
What a wonderful turnout again this year. We had a  blast dancing and hamming
it up in ballroom 1 both Friday and Saturday night.  Although the ballroom
was a bit warmer than last year, that didn't seem to stop  us. I want to thank
all those dancers and instructors that joined me and danced  their tootsies
off. We ROCKED the ROOM. It's like a family in there and I love  to get to mingle
with ya'll.
Thanks to Junior and Don for delivering the  couch for my posse (hehe). Have
to look out for them !!
The choreography  competition was held in my room and let me say that there
was some stiff  competition. All the dances were great. Congrats to both Will
Craig (Clothes  Off) and Scott Shrank (More Than Life) for going head to head
in the finals.
A finally a big thanks to Mark, Glenn, and Eve for such an organized event
and allowing me to join you again.
Can't wait till next year !!!

NOTE FROM ME:  Jill and Louie both did a great job as DJ this  past weekend.
We did everything from God Blessed Texas to  Fuego!!

( http://www.spreadyourwingsanddance.com )
Before this year, I had not been to Chicago for the Windy City event
although I heard from so many friends how wonderful it was. They were right!  Even
though we decided to go pretty much at the last minute, everyone was so  very
helpful and accomodating. A tremendous variety of dances of all levels and
styles were presented and there had to be something for everybody who was there!
We were amazed at how many instructors from all over the US and the UK were
there to teach. Lots of floor space and a nice hotel too. Great job, Eve, Mark
&amp; Glenn! We loved it! I could not believe how many friends I ran into there,
and how many new ones I made!
We held the first Mid-West regional meeting of  the BNS and inducted several
new members. We are proud to announce that Carol  Craven is now an official
card-carrying member and will be recognized world-wide  by the official
&quot;handshake&quot;. Congrats also to the rest of you inductees--you  know who you are!!
Thanks to our &quot;officers&quot;, Bryan, Junior &amp; John, who  called the meetings to order
and provided toasts and songs! Rachael just might  get elected to the board
pretty soon, too. The Southwest Florida chapter expects  to meet in Tampa.
Some of the dances taught we had seen on our recent trip  to the UK. Scott
Blevins taught his POISON PARADISE which started out under a  couple of other
names, but this one seems to fit nicely. Not too hard, and a  classic Scott
sound to the music. Guyton also presented the Double Dutch Bus  song for his GET
ON THE BUS. This is a nifty, novelty piece of music that is  really fun. Scott
also imported Dan McInerney's dance LET'S GET SAVED from the  UK where is it
spreading like wild fire. Neville taught his AIN'T GOT NO MONEY.  This is a 32
count dance that just about everyone can do to &quot;The Way I Are&quot;. We  also got a
second chance at FUEGO and our first shot at GYRATE. Rachael taught  both of
these with her amazing style and skill, and we had a fun and  entertaining
experience in both of these classes. She also revived FADED which I  was happy to
see as I miss it the first time around and I really enjoyed the  dance.
We liked several other dances that we learned and will probably  schedule to
teach in class. We met Robert Lindsay from Scotland who has the most  amazing
shoes in the entire world--we think they were made by elves! He taught  his
peppy dance called FIRECRACKER. It goes to a Helena Paparizou song, &quot;You Set  My
Heart on Fire&quot;. Bryan McWherter did a great job teaching Patrick Fleming's
WORLD ON A STRING to a nice Michael Buble track. Frank Cooper taught a dance
called WILL YOU STILL BELIEVE by Liz Bogan and Ed White that we liked, but at
the end of that teach, we got a bonus! Frank has a new dance that he just
finished over the weekend and he shared it with us. We loved the dance which
goes to a very upbeat Michael Buble track, &quot;Baby, I'm Comin Home&quot;. I think Frank
was calling it NO PLACE LIKE HOME, but he has not finished the stepsheet. We
are  waiting anxiously for that to arrive in our emails. Keep an eye on that
one!
One of my personal favorites from the weekend was presented by Barry &amp;
DariAnne Amato. They have written a nice cha-cha called DREAMIN to a really  great
song &quot;Tell Me What You Dream&quot; by Restless Heart. WeI will be teaching both
DREAMIN and FIRECRACKER at our class this week. In addition we will be doing
reviews on some of the the classic dances we saw in Chicago that we expect to
see again in Tampa in a couple of weeks.
Central Florida Dancers: Mark your  calendars for the monthly Workshop and
Social to be held on October 27 and 28  respectively. This month our weekend
will fall just before the great big event  in Tampa so I expect that we will have
a lot of folks making requests for dances  that they will want to brush up on
for the event. Do come out and join us. Look  on my website for more details.
More Later!

SUBJECT: Windy  City Line Dance Mania
Well this event certainly had a lot  packed into it - but before I get into
that, Carol, I am sorry that your luggage  got lost, The Airline lost mine on
the way there. I had to make three added  trips to the airport to see if it was
on the next flight in. Mine was lost on a  non-stop flight.
Since I was wrapped up in the Choreography Competition, I  did not get the
chance to do many of the offered dances. One I did select was  Bryan McWherter's
&quot;Phloor Philla&quot;. It was good to see an older dance redone at  the event.
Sometimes we all need a little refresher. Again, I know there will be  dozens of
reviews about all the dances, so mine isn't needed.
The  Choreography Competition at this event is run very well. I like the fact
that  you are given time to not only show you dance, but to teach it as well.
In most  cases, this is the only way others see our dances, so thank you
Mark, Glen &amp;  Eve. I also want to commend all the judges who give of their time to
not only  review the dances in the competition, but learn them as well. Some
of these  dances were quite complex. It was also great to see the number of
folks who did  come in to learn our dances during the competition. It means a
lot to us to see  other faces besides the judges in the room. I was very
rewarding to see that my  dance &quot;More Than Life&quot; was so well received. The music was
recorded by Dan  Gardner, a friend of mine here in Atlanta. He has one of the
most amazing voices  I have ever heard. He won a contest on the Today Show
several years ago, and the  prize was the recording contract to do this song. I
was very honored to write  the dance for it. If you are coming to Vegas next
month for the Dance Explosion,  I will be teaching it at Doug &amp; Jackie's event.
Here's hoping to see  more of you next year at this great event,

NOTE FROM  ME:  And you should definitely take a look at Scott's dance.  I am
glad I wasn't a judge for that one.  I would have voted for both of them to
be first.  LOL

FROM:   RathrBeDncin
Has anyone taught the dance Bubblegum? It's  really a fun dance, but I can't
seem to understand the tag information. The  second tag wall seems to be
written incorrect? Any experiences with this? I'd  love to get some feedback. Many
thanks.

SUBJECT:  DUDLEY NEWLINE DANCES IN UK
FROM:   RYAN

Last week I taught The Mizery Business - a challenging dance on the
improver/easy intermediate border. A fairly fast dance with 3 tags: one 8, one  16 and
the final being 8 counts (Now they're having a taste of line dancing!!!).  As
a result, there was no new teach tonight just recaps. The music is Paramore -
Misery Business which is a Rock/Pop upbeat song which the dance goes well to
(32C, 2 Wall). An addictive little dance that I have enjoyed doing.
Other  popular dances include D.H.S.S. (an oldie from Gaye Teather), Big
Girls Boogie  (new improver, Mika dance by Mavis Broom) and Alfie (fun dance to
Lily Allen by  Cato Larsen). On the funky side, we are enjoying Dawn Parker's
fast 'n' furious  Rock This Party a circle dance with plenty of arms and
whatever else you can get  in, Sound Of Freedom - intermediate and again fast and
funky and also Sing Sing  Sing by Rafel Corbi. Plenty of hip action in this Jivey
one.
Older class  favourites include Ayaka Momoko's Helter Skelter - I love this
dance as an  intermediate dancer. Flows great - remix of the old song Dreams.
Also, The  Sailor's Hornpipe which we still have fun with warming up.
That's  all,
Ryan
