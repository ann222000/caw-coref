Woolworths placed on notice over sale of suspect diet pills
Kelly Burke Consumer Affairs Reporter
October 29, 2007

MOST are largely unproven, untested and - as far as adverse
side-effects go - unknown. But Woolworths is standing by its
decision to sell a growing number of suspect herbal
weight-loss powders and pills, arguing that it is not its
responsibility to test the safety and efficacy of the
products it sells.

Now, after a volley of correspondence between the giant
retailer and St Vincent's Hospital, the director of the
hospital's Diabetes Centre, Lesley Campbell, has placed
Woolies on notice: Should anyone suffer an adverse effect or
die, the hospital will use its record of correspondence to
prove the retailer continued to sell the discredited
products despite knowing they were ineffective and possibly
dangerous.

The campaign to pressure Woolworths to withdraw the products
from sale began last June, when a Queensland-based science
graduate, Loretta Marron, forwarded a report to the chief
executive of Woolworths, Michael Luscombe. It included
details of 11 clinical trials and information from the
international journal Obesity Management warning that
weight-loss products making claims which could not be
supported by scientific evidence financially exploited
vulnerable individuals and created unrealistic expectations
for safe weight loss.

The following month Professor Campbell wrote to Mr Luscombe,
outlining her concerns over what appeared to be a growing
number of patients turning to a &quot;huge armamentarium of
useless, often 'natural' products, which may in fact be
harmful&quot;.

Both women demanded Woolworths justify its decision to
continue selling the weight-loss pill Xantrax, the
distributor of which was banned in February by the
Therapeutic Goods Administration's advertising watchdog from
making appetite-suppressant and weight-loss claims and yet
continued to do so.

Woolworths responded by arguing that the sale of unproven
and possibly harmful weight-loss remedies was no different
to selling alcohol and tobacco, which had proven health
problems.

&quot;Our customers may or may not be aware of the health risks
associated with the use of such products. However, we do not
consider that we should refuse to meet the legitimate
customer demands for them,&quot; it said.

When contacted by the Herald, a Woolworths spokesman said
the company had no further comment.

Ms Marron, who has described the company's defence as
woefully inadequate, said Woolworths was breaking its own
Corporate Social Responsibility Charter by knowingly selling
ineffective and possibly harmful products. The charter
includes a pledge to &quot;always be truthful in what we
advertise and how we promote the products we sell&quot;.

Aka &quot;Safeway&quot; in Victoria.

Interesting; I wasn't aware of this, the name is Woolworth's
as a dare:

http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/aboutus/ourhistory/index.asp
&quot;Woolworths opened its first store, the Woolworths
Stupendous Bargain Basement in the old Imperial Arcade in
Pitt Street, Sydney on December 5, 1924. Our nominal capital
was just 25,000 pounds (approximately 70,000 Australian
dollars today) and the initial share offer attracted 34
people, including our 5 founders - Percy Christmas, Stanley
Edward Chatterton, Cecil Scott Waine, George William
Percival Creed and Ernest Robert Williams.

Woolworths' first Queensland store was in
the Shaws Building, and opened on 8 August 1927.
The Woolworths Name

The name on the draft prospectus drawn up by Cecil Scott
Waine was &quot;Wallworths Bazaar&quot; - a play on the FW Woolworth
name (the owner of the Woolworths chain in the US and UK).
However, according to Ernest Robert Williams, Percy
Christmas dared him to register the name Woolworths instead,
which he succeeded in doing after finding out the name was
available for use in NSW.&quot;

I would imagine they have. After all it's been a very long time since
I saw a dime store that actually sold a lot of items for only a dime.
Ours had one of the best soda fountains around. Their malts were
topped with genuine whipped cream, a vanilla wafer cookie and a
maraschino cherry and it was huge. They also had an in the store
bakery where they baked cakes, pies, cookies and kolaches. We had a
pretty large Czech population at that time so the kolaches not only
came in the usual apricot, blueberry and prune, but also in cottage
cheese and poppy seed. Then on top of the filling they sprinkled
powdered sugar. I wouldn't say they were a diabetic's dream. They also
had a large selection of sandwiches, luncheon special and about the
best hot beef sandwiches anywhere.

I know that Kresgies (unsure of the spelling) evolved into K-Mart, but
did Woolworth's evolve into a similar store?

for. It's this very large grocery chain with red and green livery ...

&gt;&gt;Where do you live that still has Woolworth stores? We haven't seen one
&gt;&gt;of those in the last 35 years or so.

&gt; Woolworths and Coles are the two biggest supermarket chains

&gt; &gt;They're all over here. Here being the South &amp; Southeast. They've changed
&gt; &gt;quite a bit, though.

&gt; Totally unrelated company which just happens to have a similar name.

Ohhhhh. &lt;G&gt; Okay. Never mind.

And, besides, I reconsidered since posting this &amp; driving through 2 states &amp;
realized that the last of them here have, indeed, all been closed. Now we
have Walgreens, Rite-Aid, Eckerd, CVS and ... that's all I can think of
barring the big 'uns like Target and Wal-Mart, etc. So, I was doubly wrong &amp;
I beg your pardon. &lt;G&gt;
