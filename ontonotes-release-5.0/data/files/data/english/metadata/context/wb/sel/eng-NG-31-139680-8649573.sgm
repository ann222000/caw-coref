I know Vanilla is Vanilla, and long may it stay that way -- however....

One of the big things I love about certain other variants, is the ability to
have randarts _as well_ as the main artifacts. In reality, to me at least, the
standard artifacts get very boring after a while - the RNG is one of the joys of
the game anyway.

So, two questions, the first being somewhat overoptimistic I suspect:

1) Can the &quot;Randomize artifacts&quot; option allow extra artifacts instead of
reseeding existing ones, else can the option be added (I have no idea what sort
of extra work this is)?
2) Is the option as it stands still broken? From what I remember, the randart
code seeded the randomised artifacts from &quot;scores&quot; of the original artifacts,
but there was a rounding down process each time it happened, and the subsequent
seedings were based on the new scoreset each time, instead of the original. As a
result, the overall quality of the artifacts got steadily weaker, and this put
me off using it (I guess my laziness overcomes the &quot;generate game with original,
quit and change to randart&quot; option).

Maybe.  I'm currently rethinking weapon generation in general, and one
idea is to use something akin to randarts for &quot;boosted&quot; egos, e.g.
something with both slay demon and firebrand, without actually creating
an ego-item definition for every kind of combination.  Not really got
very far with that thought yet, though.

But yes, randarts, or something close to them, will probably turn up at
some point.  That's about the only promise I can give right now.

In the sense you describe it, yes.

Good enough for me, thanks :)

Yes, perhaps overly pejorative, sorry :)

Great to see you so active on V development though, it feels like it's getting a
well-needed dusting down!

If anything, there are already too many artifacts. Adding more is just
begging to increase TMJ. If any sort of randart or &quot;boosted ego&quot; random
weapons (same thing, different name) are to be added, then pull out all
of the weaker weapon artifacts at the same time.

If you updated the Chris &amp; Chris code, you'd have a better randart code
and the replacement method is just right for those who are &quot;bored&quot; of
the standard artifacts.

Holy Avenger should be a Paladin title,
not an ego item.
