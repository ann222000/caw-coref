I'm new around here and I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Matt
Browne and I'm a computer scientist and a science fiction writer. My
special interests include:

extinction level events, supervolcanoes, interstellar travel, androids
and the technological singularity, nanotechnology, biotechnology,
cryopreservation of embryos, natural language processing.

This looks like a very interesting forum.

I've sometimes wondered which human language is easier for AI to understand
and manipulate; and whether that would have any effect on language use in
the real world.  Would people learn to speak &quot;exampleese&quot; if the
&quot;examplians&quot; created useful hardware/software that was limited to a talky
interface?

I've learnt lots from some of the people here over the years.

Thanks for the welcome. Well, I think 2 strong AI entities would not
use human language to communicate with each other. But they would when
they speak with biological humans. Every contributor will change
language over time. Strong AIs included...

Have you ever read any of the Guild of Xenolinguists stuff by
Sheila Finch? She posits that language is affected by perception,
and perception, in turn, is affected by language. In other words,
our perception of the universe is limited by the language we have
developed to describe it. Which makes communicating with alien
species problematic, in that we may now have enough in common in
how we view the universe to be able to develop a common language.

Perhaps one of the obstacles to developing a true AI will be that
an AI is not capable of the same senses with which to perceive the
world around them as we are. We could develop an AI and not be able
to communicate with it, or even realize we have.
