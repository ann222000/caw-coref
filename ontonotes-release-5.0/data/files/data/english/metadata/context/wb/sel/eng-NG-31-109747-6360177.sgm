SLIM: SMART BIZ BEATS CHARITY
By PAUL THARP - New York Post

March 14, 2007 -- Carlos Slim, the Mexican tycoon just a hair from
being the world's richest man, scoffed yesterday at Bill Gates and
Warren Buffett for "playing Santa Claus" to cure poverty's ills.

Slim climbed on his meanie soapbox just days after his $49 billion
fortune was ranked by Forbes as the third-richest behind that No. 1
Gates and No. 2 Buffett - only a few billion shy from eclipsing them
both.

"Poverty isn't solved with donations," he said at the unveiling of his
own health care initiative. Slim continued that building good
businesses do more for society than "going around like Santa Claus."

Slim wants to build huge hospitals in northern Mexico where the U.S.
can ship tens of thousands of Medicare patients for health care that
can be delivered at much cheaper costs.

Slim was unimpressed at how Buffett and Gates vowed late last year to
combine their entire fortunes into the world's largest foundation to
do good works.

"Our concept is more to accomplish and solve things, rather than
giving," Slim said.

Slim, 67, has expanded his empire of telecom and energy assets faster
than any of the other top billionaires of the world, growing at 64
percent last year.

What a guy! Maybe he will give some businessmen something to think
about and stop being apologetic about their success and hard work.
Although I don't think he will be a favorite of advocates of
socialized medicine for targeting medicare patients in US. If he
succeeds even partially it has the potential to cause a serious dent
in their ideology. But with a 49 billion dollar war chest it will be
quite a battle.
