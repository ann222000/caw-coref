There was a malfunction. It could not be assessed properly. When a
mechanical assembly fails, it is possible for a chain of events to occur,
and the seemingly impossible result, is possible. They say that they shut
down the engine due to overheating. So the engine is down, but did any
other damage occur from the overheat situation? They didn't know at the
time.
They Gambled.

|Flying faulty jumbo across Atlantic saves BA £100,000
|By Ben Webster

A little while ago I posted a story on rta about an Alitalia 747 that
had an engine fire warning and landed in Canberra in the late '70s.

One of the points that occurred then was that, after the pilots shut
down the engine in flight, visual and instrument monitoring showed no
problems apart from the overheat signal. They assumed a faulty
fire-wire or equivalent. However, they were still concerned enough to
land at Canberra, a smaller airport only suitable in emergencies, even
though Sydney or Melbourne (their destination) weren't more than
another forty minutes flight time away.

When they landed, it was found that the alloy gearbox had ground to a
powder because of the windmill effect on the engine, even though it
was unpowered. It erupted in flame as soon as the nacelle cowls were
dropped, but we extinguished it with ground extinguishers. Later
investigation indicated that this could have occurred in flight if
they had not landed immediately.

It's not always a matter of whether the aircraft can continue without
that engine. Safety decisions have to take all possibilities into
account including the possibility of unknown collateral damage.

The BA pilot's decision horrifies me.

Hi Bertie

I note your nick. Are you from Oz? You know the legends of the bunyip?

You may find the dictionary definitions interesting, particularly
number 2:

http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bunyip

bun·yip Audio pronunciation of &quot;bunyip&quot; ( P ) Pronunciation Key
(bnyp)
n. Australian

1. An imaginary monster inhabiting swamps and lagoons.
2. An imposter; a fake.

&gt;&gt; whats the problem, they still had another 3 engines.

&gt;&gt; the worst part was being stuck in manchester.

&gt;The airliner was crippled . . . so much so that it never reached proper
&gt;cruising altitude. Plus, starting the voyage with 3 engines meant that only
&gt;ONE MORE ENGINE could fail before the plane would drop like a rock right out
&gt;of the sky.

"/>  Not quite...

Planes can glide and land with no engine power at all. Although a
landing with no engine power is rougher than normal and gives no chance to
retry if approaching the runway wrong or ending up low/short. Bad news is
if there is no ground smooth enough to make such a landing on.
I have even heard of commercial flights having to take paths favoring
availability of places to make emergency landings and only planes of
type/age that are less likely to need to make an emergency landing are
allowed to fly out of gliding range of places they can land.

But planes don't fall like rocks if all engines fail.

For that matter, helicopters can be landed without power. The procedure
is called &quot;autorotation&quot;. The rotor blades, if pitched properly for this,
will spin the way a falling mapleseed does. The craft also rotates to
some extent and the landing is harder than usual, but a helicopter with
engine failure is at least usually not doomed to falling like a rock.

Oh, and planes flown by anyone that rightfully made it out of training
can recover from a stall (even with no engine power at all). The plane
drops anywhere from less than 100 feet (for smaller, slower planes) to I
would guess a couple thousand feet for a jetliner. So a jetliner that
stalls at 29,000 feet drops to 27,000 or maybe 26,000 feet...
Then again, I would think a jetliner pilot can easily avoid a stall if
engine failure or additional engine failure occurs. If the plane is
nosed-down before it slows to below stall speed, it will lose less
altitude and do so more gently than if it stalls.

"/> Fuel emergency doesn't mean out of fuel,
They wouldn't have started out across the ocean if there was a problem with
fuel. the problem evidentally was that consumption was high enough to
trigger a diversion they could have diverted earlier if needed.

One hopes that there was a rolling back up to the flight plan, pass Chicago
clear to X pass X to Y. The drama of the fire engines is a part of the
process. I recall a US air force flight that I was on not declaring a fuel
emergency just so he could avoid the show and the resulting explanations to
his superiors, we had enough fuel unless they closed the field on us. Oh I
don't like to think about that ;-) and the look on his crew chiefs face
when they checked the fuel levels was quite priceless along with his quip
that we seemed to use a lot of fuel taxiing in.

But one must also realize that multi engine aircraft can and do fly on less
than all engines it is part of the design. I think flying on 3 of 4 would
be a hell of a lot less scary than 1 of 2 which is a possibility in ETOPS
flights of 767 and the like.

"/> Dufus Dave...

Heres the three scenarios we plan for all the time, in a TWO motor aeroplane:

1) Fly to Hawaii, lose and engine, have to descend to a lower altitude
(single-engine service ceiling, called drift-down).

2) Fly to Hawaii, lose an engine AND pressurization, have to descend to
10,000(no cabin pressure) and,

3) Fly to Hawaii, lose nothing but pressurization, have to descend to 10,000
return or continue on...

Each one of these is planned for, but which burns the most gas?

&quot;Tune in tomorrow when the villian finds out the answer.... &quot;

Answer 3) Two engines burn LOTS more gas at a non-optimum altitude than
one.
If you dont like the answer, take the train.

"/> You make it sound like the crew had no idea what their fuel burn rate
was before crossing the ocean. Nothing could be farther from reality.
They would have been over the NA continent for six hours before starting
across the ocean, and had a real good idea of how much fuel they needed.
They knew they would make Ireland or Scotland, and probably thought they
had enough to land at Heathrow. If there were any problems along the
way, there are airports that can handle 747s in Northern Canada,
Greenland, the Azores, and Iceland, in other words, at worst no more
than an hour away.

I suspect they found that the winds weren't as favorable as they had
hoped, and had to settle for Manchester, rather than London. That was
the only uncertainty, but it wasn't unsafe.

&gt;&gt; Pilot error by pilots unqualified to fly a jetliner, and preferably not

&gt;&gt; Oh, and planes flown by anyone that rightfully made it out of training
&gt;&gt; can recover from a stall (even with no engine power at all). The plane

&gt; If everything does go wrong however a 747 has a pretty good glide

&gt; What a load of crap. There was no gambling with people's lives,

&gt; I would bet that they were planning a Manchester landing from the time

&gt;&gt;OK, how would YOU describe it when (not if) both wings stall due to
&gt;&gt;all engines starved for fuel?

&gt; Pilot error by pilots unqualified to fly a jetliner, and preferably
&gt; not
&gt; yet out of flight school.
&gt; Oh, and planes flown by anyone that rightfully made it out of
&gt; training
&gt; can recover from a stall (even with no engine power at all). The
&gt; plane drops anywhere from less than 100 feet (for smaller, slower
&gt; planes) to I would guess a couple thousand feet for a jetliner. So a
&gt; jetliner that stalls at 29,000 feet drops to 27,000 or maybe 26,000
&gt; feet...
&gt; Then again, I would think a jetliner pilot can easily avoid a stall
&gt; if
&gt; engine failure or additional engine failure occurs. If the plane is
&gt; nosed-down before it slows to below stall speed, it will lose less
&gt; altitude and do so more gently than if it stalls.

&gt;&gt; At that point, an airliner pretty much flies as
&gt;&gt;well as a rock. That's not particularly funny to me, but I guess some
&gt;&gt;people might see it as humorous. -Dave

&gt; Even basic pilot training is recovering from stalls and landing with
&gt; no
&gt; engine power at all.

"/> Full stall with no power recovery in a large jet only eats up a few hundred
feet. If you do it smoothly in a lightplane you can do it in less than a
hundred, easily.

problem with it, the BAC 1-11. However, the Brits think that anything
configured like that has the same problem, so any 727 reg'd in the UK

"/> Exactly. The 1-11 had an additional problem in that the engine intakes were
blanketed by the wing at high alpha. To prevent them from self destructing
in a flurry of nasty surges, they introduced several very crude fuel
control devices which were activated be the angle of attack sensors. these
limited the fuel to the engine (in the coarsest possible way) to ensure you
didn't blow them up trying to get the thing flying again. BAC very kindly
gave this info to Douglas who managed to avoid the problem n the 9. The 727
never had it anyway.

&gt;&gt; whats the problem, they still had another 3 engines.

&gt;&gt; the worst part was being stuck in manchester.

&gt; The airliner was crippled . . . so much so that it never reached proper

&gt; only
&gt; ONE MORE ENGINE could fail before the plane would drop like a rock right

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Also, with one engine doing the work of two, it was then more
&gt; likely that the plane would experience further engine failure(s).

"/> That is not a logical assumption. The maximum power requirement is at
take-off and an airliner has to be designed so that it can lose one engine
without affecting its ability to complete take-off. After that stage of
flight, the engines are throttled back and, while three engines would be
working harder than four, they would not have been working at levels that
would overstress them.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Plus, the
&gt; plane did not have enough fuel to reach it's destination with three
&gt; engines.
&gt; So it was forced to divert to Manchester, ASSUMING it could make it THAT
&gt; FAR, which was not guaranteed.

"/> If fuel had been as short as you suggest, then the aircraft would have
landed at Prestwick, or possibly Shannon. If I recall the plates correctly,
Manchester is the start point for one of the Heathrow approaches. Landing
there only means that the pilot would not have had enough fuel for a safe
diversion had he flown on to Heathrow and then been prevented from landing
there.

Nice to see an intelligent response.

As a newby here It's taken me a little while to realise that this ng
has just as many kids pretending to be experts as any other. *sigh*

I'm no expert, just an oldie with a flaky memory. But I worked on
BAC-111 avionics in the RAAF in the '70s. It wasn't called
&quot;superstall&quot;; it was &quot;Deep Stall&quot;. IIRC a test pilot died discovering
it, effectively flying backwards into the deck. Once the deep stall
was entered, it was unrecoverable.

To counter it, the aircraft had external sensor vanes, a stick shaker
to alert pilots and an over-ride hydraulic system to force the stick
fully forward when a stall angle was exceeded. From memory, shaking
occurred at 28 degrees and the ram thrust came in at 34 degrees.

It was certainly no joke, even less so when we had a failure of the
system caused by faulty design and the ram operated once shortly after
take-off. There were footrests on the dash for just such an emergency,
and the pilots in that instance needed them, and every ounce of
strength their adrenalin gave them. That led to modifications limiting
the vane motion. They had reversed 180 as the aircraft taxied to the
end of the strip and stayed reversed (ping-pong ball effect) when the
aircraft turned into the wind. The stall sensor operated as soon as it
was armed by the oleos retracting. To the actual pilots here, think
about that timing:-)

I'm not a pilot (or someone pretending to be one) and I didn't work on
other T-tail aircraft, but I believe a similar system was used on
DC-9s, 727s and similar aircraft. It's probably in use today, but I
haven't worked on a plane for 25 years.

Do some googling. I just found this one, I'm sure you'll find other
references.

&gt;&gt;&gt; whats the problem, they still had another 3 engines.

&gt;&gt;&gt; the worst part was being stuck in manchester.

&gt;&gt; The airliner was crippled . . . so much so that it never reached
&gt;&gt; proper cruising altitude. Plus, starting the voyage with 3 engines
&gt;&gt; meant that only
&gt;&gt; ONE MORE ENGINE could fail before the plane would drop like a rock
&gt;&gt; right out
&gt;&gt; of the sky.

&gt; Total rubbish. The aircraft would be able to hold altitude on two
&gt; engines and even if all four failed, the aircraft will glide.

&gt; http://homepage.ntlworld.com/m68ccg/gimli/&gt;
&gt;&gt; Also, with one engine doing the work of two, it was then more
&gt;&gt; likely that the plane would experience further engine failure(s).

&gt; That is not a logical assumption. The maximum power requirement is at
&gt; take-off and an airliner has to be designed so that it can lose one
&gt; engine without affecting its ability to complete take-off. After that
&gt; stage of flight, the engines are throttled back and, while three
&gt; engines would be working harder than four, they would not have been
&gt; working at levels that would overstress them.

&gt;&gt; Plus, the
&gt;&gt; plane did not have enough fuel to reach it's destination with three
&gt;&gt; engines.
&gt;&gt; So it was forced to divert to Manchester, ASSUMING it could make it
&gt;&gt; THAT FAR, which was not guaranteed.

&gt; If fuel had been as short as you suggest, then the aircraft would have
&gt; landed at Prestwick, or possibly Shannon.

"/> Wel, exactly, or even Keflavik or Stornaway. Le's not cnfuse the kooks with
the facts, though.

So there was absolutely no chance of something like this:

Something people tend to forget is that jet engines still windmill
after the fuel is cut off. So mechanical parts, gearboxes etc keep
turning. And, if there is FOD or something broken in there, damage can
continue.

I would have believed it of Aeroflot, or Grace L Ferguson's Airline
and Storm Door Company, but I'm saddened to see it from BA.

&gt; What is a superstall?

"/> When certain aircraft (such as 727s, with a T-type tail and engines near
the tail) enters a stall, the turbulence from the stall produces a stall
of the control surfaces in the tail as well, along with a flameout of
the engines (which are also in the turbulence). This produces a much
more serious stall from which there is often no recovery. It is so
dangerous that special precautions were installed early on such aircraft
to help avoid stalls at all costs.

&gt;&gt; You make it sound like the crew had no idea what their fuel burn rate
&gt;&gt; was before crossing the ocean. Nothing could be farther from reality.

&gt; And you are insinuating that it's OK to fly an airliner with hundreds of
&gt; passengers and NO MARGIN FOR ERROR.

"/> You seem to be missing a basic concept. First, the amount of fuel the
aircraft will use with an engine shut down is programmed into the
on-board flight management system. It is very predictable. The pilot
will know very quickly how far he can fly, and can then determine if he
will be able to make it to his original destination, or have to divert.
Second, he will further have to abide by rules laid out by both the
British regulator and his company for the amount of reserve fuel he will
need. He will have sufficient fuel

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That is, even if they &quot;thought&quot; they'd make Heathrow, they
&gt; shouldn't have flown if they weren't sure that they'd
&gt; land at Heathrow with a few hours of extra fuel.

"/> They never carry that amount of additional fuel. I can be corrected, but
the reserves are only about 45 minutes, plus what is needed to get to an
alternate airport. Any flight will only carry that minimum amount of
fuel, since it costs too much to carry any extra. They don't &quot;fill 'er
up&quot; with fuel.

When the pilot chose to fly across the Atlantic, he would have applied
exactly the same rules to whatever airport he selected as his
destination. In short, teh FMS would tell him where he was likely to
land right after leaving LA, and would have sufficient reserves to make
a normal landing at that destination, with plenty of margin.

"/> Why do you cling to this misconception that the aircraft would suddenly

The amount of fuel the plane needs to fly with three engines is very
predictable, and the pilot would have known how far he could fly before
he left the LA area. That calculation would include the necessary
minimums as required by regulations. He would not plan on arriving with
only &quot;fumes&quot; in the fuel tanks. He would have had exactly the same
reserves as an aircraft leaving on a normal, uneventful flight.

In this case, BA said that they aircraft could have made it to Heathrow,
but wouldn't have had the necessary reserves, in case they had to hold,
so they diverted to Manchester. I have been on flights with fully
functioning engines where we had to divert to add fuel because of
stronger than normal headwinds. No big deal.

To further verify that things are working as they should, the crew will
make regular checks of the amount of fuel in the tanks, versus what they
predict should be used, and if there is a significant variation, will
divert to an airport enroute for a check. The checks are made even if
the aircraft has all engines working properly.

Given that the aircraft was over land for the first 6 or 7 hours, they
had plenty of time to determine if the fuel rate was as predicted, and
decide whether to continue the flight or land.

A large part of that will be due to the excellent safety and reliability of
modern aircraft but clearly they're also doing something else right.

I'm sure plenty of thought was given to the safety issues - though I have to
admit I might have felt a teensy weeny bit uncomfortable. It's nice to know
that *all* the engines are working.

OTOH - would you prefer a long delay whilst a replacement a/c is arranged or
simply prefer to get to your destination ? I seem to recall anecdotally a
sort of similar case where a captain actually offered his pax the option -
and the pax decided to continue the flight !

OK. So, have we seen any reports yet on what they found when they
opened this engine up?

My logic was that, as they discovered the problem immediately after
takeoff, then that extra six hours was an unnecessary hazard to their
passengers.

&quot;The fault occurred on take-off from Los Angeles but the pilot
declined all opportunities to land in the US and instead continued on
three engines for 5,000 miles to Britain.&quot;
&lt;snip&gt;
&quot;Air traffic controllers at Los Angeles spotted streams of sparks
shooting from the engine and immediately radioed the pilot. He
attempted to throttle the engine back but was forced to shut it down
after it continued to overheat. The plane then began circling over the
Pacific while the pilot contacted BA’s control centre in London to
discuss what to do. They decided the flight should continue to London
even though it would burn more fuel on just three engines.&quot;

The fact that they landed safely, albeit at the wrong airport under
hazardous circumstances, does not excuse the initial poor decision.
There was absolutely no need to create that hazard. Economic
exigencies are never a valid over-ride for air safety.

How were they to know what caused the sparks - FOD, airstrike,
whatever? And thus, how were they to know that a compressor blade or
something similar wasn't about to come hurtling through the fuselage -
or worse - through the fuel tanks?

All this discussion about gliding (yeah, like a brick - read the
&quot;Gimli Glider story; it doesn't actually fill one with confidence) or
fuel shortages are irrelevant. They should have landed at the nearest
available appropriate strip. I hope the relevant authorities take that
view and descend on all concerned like a ton of bricks.

Cheers, Alan

&gt; My logic was that, as they discovered the problem immediately after

"/> You fail to take into account the possibility that the problem was
diagnosed as something benign (in the sense that it may have taken out
the engine but was not likely to get worse during the flight) before
the pilots decided to continue the flight.

We have not been told that such a diagnosis did happen, but that is a
lousy reason for believing that it in fact didn't.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How were they to know what caused the sparks - FOD, airstrike,

"/> Aircraft are generally packed full of diagnostic instrumentation, and
many failure modes of their engines are well known and understood. If
what one could observe while in-flight points unambiously to a failure
mode which, by experience, is known not to endanger the flight, then
assuming that the flight is indeed not in danger is grounded just as
solidly as the assumption that a _normally_ performing engine is not a
hazard.

NO they did not know they had enough fuel. The only reason for not
returning to LAX was they could make it to LHR without ANY stop. ANY
stop would have negated the reason for continuing from LAX (or any of
the other enroute airfields prior to feet wet). The intent all along was
to terminate at LHR ONLY. The fact they did not make it to LHR is
prima facia evidence that thier planning was faulty. At least their
failure didn't result in the loss of aircraft, crew, and passengers. It
shouls result in loss of jobs. At BA if the crew were directed to
continue, or the flight crew if they used thier own faulty judgement.

&gt; Right, but what makes you think they will have a problem where that will

&gt; fuel will take them with proper reserves, know that the aircraft is

As I've had it explained to me, it results from a failure to recover from a

The aircraft gets into a bizarre attitude and can ( IIRC ) totally lose any

Remove those 'external' factors and the timeline and BA has never had an

I also have to say that whilst I wil happilly call BA 'boring airline' - they get

they were planning to to be able to set it down whenever they determine they
couldnt make it all the way to their destination? You can count on Manchester
being one of their alternates. Look at the stinkin map. Is Manchester RIGHT on
the water? Are waves lapping at the runways edge? Its more inland that you
think. There were about 80 airports along the way that they were always looking
at to go to. You just dont get that.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just as a sidenote. Since BA was formed by amalgamating BEA and

&gt;&gt; Let's see. The companies were brought under one management board in
&gt;&gt; 1972. They were formally combined as BA in 1974. Therefore, here
&gt;&gt; are some candidates:

&gt;&gt; Jan 1973 - Vickers Viscount hit mountain on a test flight. (Yes is
&gt;&gt; was a BEA plane, but the companies were combined at that point.

&gt; Since that aircraft wasn't 'technically' BA at that point - I'll argue
&gt; the point.

&gt;&gt; Sep 1976 - BA Trident collided with JAT plane over Yugoslavia

&gt; I'm recall that one - strange that it didn't turn up in the info I'm
&gt; aware of. I ought to look into that further

&gt; Controller was jailed as a result of that IIRC.

&gt;&gt; Aug 1985 - British Airtours at Manchester. (It really was part of BA
&gt;&gt; then)

&gt; Uhuh. Wasn't flying as BA though ! Yeah I know it's a technical point
&gt; if you want to pursue it. More to the point is that a P&amp;W engine 'blew
&gt; up'. Combustion can failed. As I understand it - even great
&gt; maintenance wouldn't have spotted it.

"/> Yes, it would have fjukwit.

They ignored 4 PW service bulletins about burner cans and the crews(BA
crews) were not using the correct stabilisation procedure at the start of
take off roll.

Airlines don't like to have working for them pilots who:

* won't declare a fuel emergency when low enough on fuel to be unable to
be certain to be able to make at least a couple more loops through the
pattern and land with engine power

* Can't land a plane from anywhere in a holding pattern onto the runway
without engine power (although may require landing in the wrong
direction and forcing other traffic to evade the powerless plane if the
plane lost engine power only a few thousand feet above the ground)

If the plane loses engine power, the pilot merely has to radio &quot;Mayday&quot;
and then is in not much worse trouble for cutting in 1000 feet behind a
plane of similar speed and putting down, and turning onto the grass on one
side of the runway if necessary to avoid rear-ending the plane ahead of
it - or doing whatever else is necessary to land the plane.
Yes, I know of trailing vortices - and enough about them to believe that
airlines can easily enough have their pilots aware of those and know
where and how they form and how to avoid them (in addition to normally
staying a couple miles or whatever behind the plane ahead of them because
of these vortices).

Most airliner crashes that I remember have to do with oddball mechanical
failures, inadequate de-icing in heavy snow, playing &quot;damn the torpedoes&quot;
when a thunderstorm or gusty rain shower is in progress or likely to be
about to occur in a location that would have a bad scheduling problem from
delaying flights around landing through such things, or rare pilot error.
Maybe after that inadequate or cut-rate maintenance and combinations of
landing in fog or heavy snow or especially heavy rain combined with
probably usually at least a couple other things going wrong. (Not counting
terrorist passenger actions.)

Hint: Don't pick flights that land at busy airports in mid or late
afternoon in spring or summer in much of the USA east of the Rockies, and
in Florida or Gulf Coast areas extend this into early fall. Maybe also in
locations prone to lake effect snow squalls in times of day and year prone
to those (mostly mid or late November to early February and midday to
early evening).
Reason: Thunderstorms and gusty rain/snow showers are all too common
then. And they get numerous enough for it to be a nightmare to have every
flight avoid every single one of such storm cells. I remember a crash
from a flight deciding a convective rain shower was a non-threatening one
and a downburst occurred with no warning while the plane was almost over
the runway.

If the airport is not busy or for other reasons there is less pressure
to keep a schedule, then pilots are more willing to loop through the
pattern to avoid the all too numerous convective showers of low but
nonzero threat.

Once again, my point is that they should not have continued once those
sparks were seen and the overheat occurred. The fact that nothing
further happened is irrelevant.

The fact that they had no idea what had happened to that engine, or
what might still be happening, was the only relevant factor.

concerns should never even be a factor in the decision.

that most of the fuel will evaporate before hitting the ground. The
minimum recommended altitudes are around 5000 or 6000 feet. The FAA
allows controllers to route aircraft as low as 2000 feet above the
highest point when they are dumping.

When aircraft are close to the minimum altitude, it is estimated that
about 10 percent of the fuel released will hit the ground. However, it
will be spread around so much, that it will be undetectable with normal
instruments. The amount will vary depending on winds, temperature, and
humidity.

The aircraft was held for 1 hour 15 minutes, not a &quot;few hours&quot;. By
then, the aircraft could no longer make it to the alternate airport,
(Boston) which was their first major mistake. They should have diverted
sooner.

It wasn't a case of the crew making a &quot;mistake&quot; of not declaring an
emergency, it turned out that the captain hardly spoke English at all,
and the first officer, who was handling the communications, probably
didn't know the proper English word. As such, the air traffic controller
never knew they had a problem.

The flight was given clearance to land, but was taken in turn along a 15
mile pattern to the runway. Had the crew told the controller they had a
fuel emergency, their landing would have been expedited.

The plane made a landing attempt, but had to execute a missed approach.
By then, they had insufficient fuel to make a second attempt.

Why you think this incident has any relationship to the BA flight is
beyond me. The BA crew landed safely at the alternate airport, with
adequate margins, like they were trained to. Had the Avianca crew done
the same, there never would have been an accident.

&gt; Once again, my point is that they should not have continued once those

&gt; further happened is irrelevant.

&gt; The fact that they had no idea what had happened to that engine, or
&gt; what might still be happening, was the only relevant factor.

&gt; When dealing with the lives of several hundred people, economic
&gt; concerns should never even be a factor in the decision.

&gt; Cheers, Alan

"/> HARHARHARHARHAR.. never be an economic concern? What world are you living

&gt; The dumping areas have minimum altitudes, which are supposed to ensure
&gt; that most of the fuel will evaporate before hitting the ground. The
&gt; minimum recommended altitudes are around 5000 or 6000 feet. The FAA
&gt; allows controllers to route aircraft as low as 2000 feet above the
&gt; highest point when they are dumping.

"/> So where does an over 200,000 pound fuel dump eventually wind up? Just

Probably very little would stay permanently suspended in the atmosphere,
and most would wind up on the ground or water. Would the cloud of fuel
in the atmosphere be dense enough to be flammable?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; When aircraft are close to the minimum altitude, it is estimated that
&gt; about 10 percent of the fuel released will hit the ground. However, it
&gt; will be spread around so much, that it will be undetectable with normal
&gt; instruments. The amount will vary depending on winds, temperature, and
&gt; humidity.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If they aren't undergoing an emergency, there are designated dumping areas.

&gt;&gt; Where they are sure that there is no marine traffic when they need to
&gt;&gt; dump?

&gt; The dumping areas are located where there is no permanent settlement, or
&gt; any particularly sensitive environmental areas.

"/> A bunch of years ago('85), a Delta 727 lost an engine out of DCA. They flew
right over my neighborhood(I grew up really close to DCA) at low alt.(approx
2000') streaming fuel outta the wingtips trying to to get down to landing
weight. The entire neighborhood smelled of kerosene for hours. Seen it
happen. This was long before EPA said you couldnt dump over populated areas...
was impressive.. Now with most newer a/c dumping fuel to get down to landing
weight isnt an issue.. my 757 can take off at 240,000 and land at 198,000 and
doesnt HAVE a fuel dump system. Landing overweight isnt a problem anymore as an
overweight landing inspection isnt a big deal.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there a standard procedure for dumping aircraft fuel over a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; section of ocean that has been cleared of all marine traffic?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In theory, they dump it from an altitude where it evaporates
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; before it hits the ground (or ocean).

&gt;&gt;&gt; In practice, do you think that over 200,000 pounds of fuel wouldn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; come down as a &quot;rain&quot;, even from a high altitude? I'm not judging
&gt;&gt;&gt; either way; just interested.

&gt;&gt; The dumping areas have minimum altitudes, which are supposed to
&gt;&gt; ensure that most of the fuel will evaporate before hitting the
&gt;&gt; ground. The minimum recommended altitudes are around 5000 or 6000
&gt;&gt; feet. The FAA allows controllers to route aircraft as low as 2000
&gt;&gt; feet above the highest point when they are dumping.

&gt; So where does an over 200,000 pound fuel dump eventually wind up?
&gt; Just because most of it &quot;evaporates&quot; doesn't mean that it just
&gt; disappears. Probably very little would stay permanently suspended in
&gt; the atmosphere, and most would wind up on the ground or water. Would
&gt; the cloud of fuel in the atmosphere be dense enough to be flammable?

&gt;&gt; When aircraft are close to the minimum altitude, it is estimated that
&gt;&gt; about 10 percent of the fuel released will hit the ground. However,
&gt;&gt; it will be spread around so much, that it will be undetectable with
&gt;&gt; normal instruments. The amount will vary depending on winds,
&gt;&gt; temperature, and humidity.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If they aren't undergoing an emergency, there are designated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dumping areas.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Where they are sure that there is no marine traffic when they need
&gt;&gt;&gt; to dump?

&gt;&gt; The dumping areas are located where there is no permanent settlement,
&gt;&gt; or any particularly sensitive environmental areas.

&gt; The whole ocean is environmentally sensitive.

"/>&quot;Evaporates&quot; = &quot;enters its gaseous state.&quot; It is not at that point

"/> Obviously, but not for long. It would disperse.

Equally obviously, dumping fuel is not something you do just for
the hell of it; it is not without environmental impact, not to mention
the economic impact. But there are most certainly those times when
it IS the best option.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

&gt; The whole ocean is environmentally sensitive.

"/> Of course. Now, given the statement that 10% of the dump will
reach the surface, presumably still in liquid form, please figure
the impact of a 20,000 pound (roughly 3,500 gallons, give or take)
dump of jet fuel (basically kerosene) reaching what would be at
least several square miles of ocean. Keeping in mind, of course,
that kerosene is practically insoluble in water, will float, and will
continue to evaporate from the surface of the ocean.

aviation was actually in progress), I can't speak from personal
experience about what the glide ratio of, say, a 747 would happen
to be. But I would think that from six or seven miles up, you would
have a reasonable distance to travel before you'd absolutely HAVE
to think about making contact with Mother Earth again, and that
assumes that ALL sources of motive power decided to suddenly

Hi

I didn't say that. Incidentally, drop the &quot;u&quot;. It's an acronym for
Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Service, so it's QANTAS.

There is an incident in 1989 noted in
http://www.flightsafe.co.uk/qfa.html#safety  which I wasn't aware of;
someone else may know about that. They had an undercarriage incident
in Rome IIRC back in 2000, and overshot the Bangkok runway a few
months before that. And, as far as serious incidents go, I think
that's it since 1951. However, if you find others I'll stand
corrected. These are the stats on
http://www.planecrashinfo.com/Airline/AL%20Q-R.htm  (nothing shows
since these dates):

24 Mar 1927 Tambo, Qld, Australia de Havilland DH-9C
15 Nov 1934 Near Longreach, NSW, Australia de Havilland DH-86
20 Feb 1942 (WWII) Brisbane, Australia deHavilland DH-86
22 Apr 1943 (WWII) Off Port Moresby, New Guinea Short S-23
26 Nov 1943 (WWII) Port Moresby, New Guinea Lockheed L-18-56 Lodestar
11 Oct 1944 (WWII) Sydney, Australia Short S-23 (flying boat)
16 Jul 1951 Near Lae, New Guinea de Havilland Drover II

So, while you might dispute how &quot;major&quot; they are based on flights
(although not on miles), it's hard to find any other airline in
continuous operation since 1920 with a record like that. I don't know
if the 1951 crash in the jungle had fatalities, but even if it did
that was 54 years ago.

Actually, it would be hard to find many, if any, other airlines in
continuous operation since 1920. Or even 1951. Period.

So, if I want to be sure of getting there alive and undamaged, they're
my airline of choice.

Of course, I'm only slightly biased as an Aussie:-)

&gt;&gt; And if the windmilling had exacerbated an internal, unseen, engine

&gt; That depends on the reason the engine was shut down, and been defined on
&gt; BA's checklists. Once the aircraft had flown for six hours without any

&gt;&gt; So there was absolutely no chance of something like this:

&gt; That incident was because of poor engine inspection procedures by the

&gt; then the failure wouldn't have occurred. Therefore, with BA
&gt; maintenance, no, there was no chance of a similar problem.

failure with suspected/known structural damage will be headed for the

The example cited above occurred during run up prior to T/O roll. The A/C
shut down &amp; was evacuated on the Ry. The A/C in the example cited burned out
on the Ry.

&gt;&gt; OK. So, have we seen any reports yet on what they found when they
&gt;&gt; opened this engine up?

&gt; No, and we have not seen any reports on what they found out even while
&gt; circling outside LAX.

&gt;&gt; My logic was that, as they discovered the problem immediately after
&gt;&gt; takeoff, then that extra six hours was an unnecessary hazard to their
&gt;&gt; passengers.

&gt; You fail to take into account the possibility that the problem was
&gt; diagnosed as something benign (in the sense that it may have taken out
&gt; the engine but was not likely to get worse during the flight) before
&gt; the pilots decided to continue the flight.

&gt; We have not been told that such a diagnosis did happen, but that is a
&gt; lousy reason for believing that it in fact didn't.

&gt;&gt; How were they to know what caused the sparks - FOD, airstrike,
&gt;&gt; whatever?

&gt; Aircraft are generally packed full of diagnostic instrumentation, and
&gt; many failure modes of their engines are well known and understood. If
&gt; what one could observe while in-flight points unambiously to a failure
&gt; mode which, by experience, is known not to endanger the flight, then
&gt; assuming that the flight is indeed not in danger is grounded just as
&gt; solidly as the assumption that a _normally_ performing engine is not a
&gt; hazard.

"/> Another issue that would be considered when deciding where to land during
such a situation is fuel load. If the engine presented no immediate danger
it would be better off to proceed. This would allow the A/C to reach a home
maint station while burning off the fuel load that would have to be dumped
to have made an emergency landing at LAX. Even if an emergency landing was
necessary sometimes A/C proceed to another landing site burning off fuel in
the process.

Unless you are privy to all the details associated with the decision process
leading up to the action taken in this incident don't second guess the crew
&amp; maint people making the decision.

&gt;&gt; * Can't land a plane from anywhere in a holding pattern onto the runway
&gt;&gt; without engine power (although may require landing in the wrong

&gt;&gt; plane lost engine power only a few thousand feet above the ground)

&gt;avoid the powerless plane? HARHARHARHARHARHARHAR

"/>  This specific point is not on avoiding the powerless plane but on
landing a plane that loses power in the pattern. Easily enough done, and
in addition easily enough avoided by declaring a fuel emergency.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If the plane loses engine power, the pilot merely has to radio &quot;Mayday&quot;
&gt;&gt; and then is in not much worse trouble for cutting in 1000 feet behind a
&gt;&gt; plane of similar speed and putting down, and turning onto the grass on one
&gt;&gt; side of the runway if necessary to avoid rear-ending the plane ahead of
&gt;&gt; it - or doing whatever else is necessary to land the plane.

&gt;Damn, funniest thing I've read since Dave C said a 747-400 will fall like a
&gt;rock... ...running into the grass to avoid rear-ending another plane? Are you
&gt;serious? Have you even been to an airport? can you even recognize an airplane
&gt;two time outta three?

"/>  Sure I can with no training at all! Running into grass is only a
serious emergency maneuver in a seriously bad situation with the most
likely cause being not advised to do the obviously advisable course of
action to zig-zag around the main path of the pattern in order to fall
back. I also know that activating flaps earlier than usual in a descent
path to landing will make a plane fall back in the pattern. This I
learned merely by being a boyfriend of a licensed pilot who is not so much
as instrument-rated but often rents planes to fly, and only in VFR
conditions.

Yes, I can recognize an airplane, top of a scyscraper, top of a radio
antenna towwer, top of a construction crane, or the main nighttime light
of an airport or even the 12-story-high heliport at a semi-downtown major
hospital in a big city that I reside just outside of, and can tell them
apart!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Yes, I know of trailing vortices - and enough about them to believe that
&gt;&gt; airlines can easily enough have their pilots aware of those and know
&gt;&gt; where and how they form and how to avoid them (in addition to normally
&gt;&gt; staying a couple miles or whatever behind the plane ahead of them because
&gt;&gt; of these vortices).

&gt;&gt; Most airliner crashes that I remember have to do with oddball mechanical

&gt;&gt; when a thunderstorm or gusty rain shower is in progress or likely to be
&gt;&gt; about to occur in a location that would have a bad scheduling problem from
&gt;&gt; delaying flights around landing through such things, or rare pilot error.
&gt;&gt; Maybe after that inadequate or cut-rate maintenance and combinations of
&gt;&gt; landing in fog or heavy snow or especially heavy rain combined with
&gt;&gt; probably usually at least a couple other things going wrong. (Not counting
&gt;&gt; terrorist passenger actions.)

&gt;Names, places, dates

"/>  As for more oddball problems: How about the Lockerbie disaster caused
by obvious terrorist action, the ValuJet crash in Florida caused by
hazardous cargo, a flight having takeoff problems in Washington DC
crashing into a bridge over the Potomac River due to de-icing not keeping
up with an especially bad brief period of heavy snowfall, another crash I
believe in Florida where the plane attempted to land through an
&quot;innocent-enough&quot; (my words, not likely to show up in a Google search)
rain shower where someone in the flight crew got caught recorded with
words including &quot;felt good&quot; or maybe &quot;feels good&quot; or something of the
like in obvious reference to a convective rauin shower.
As far as I remember, the convective rain shower that was &quot;felt good&quot; or
whatever by the pilot occurred in a location, at a time of year and at a
time of day when true problems from such things are common and false
alarms from such things are even more common.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Hint: Don't pick flights that land at busy airports in mid or late
&gt;&gt; afternoon in spring or summer in much of the USA east of the Rockies, and
&gt;&gt; in Florida or Gulf Coast areas extend this into early fall. Maybe also in
&gt;&gt; locations prone to lake effect snow squalls in times of day and year prone
&gt;&gt; to those (mostly mid or late November to early February and midday to
&gt;&gt; early evening).

&gt;Or when the sun is above the horizon, or after it sets(its too dark to see the
&gt;ground) HARHARHARHARHARHARHAR

"/>  So you want to force me to choose a half of the day to be worse?

In response I surely mention that the problem that I mentioned is
mostly midday to early evening with additional &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; times
being varying with time of day and also with time of year ans also varying
with location and also with bad exceptions mostly making weather reports
on the news, or mainly in areas that get the brunt of &quot;such turns for the
worse&quot;.

In any case, commercial jetliners fly well above all parts of &quot;Boulder
Winds&quot; unless having to land in such conditions which only occur in a
small area of the USA...

Surely every airline that wants to stay in business knows or learns
quickly about such things!

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; Reason: Thunderstorms and gusty rain/snow showers are all too common
&gt;&gt; then. And they get numerous enough for it to be a nightmare to have every
&gt;&gt; flight avoid every single one of such storm cells. I remember a crash
&gt;&gt; from a flight deciding a convective rain shower was a non-threatening one
&gt;&gt; and a downburst occurred with no warning while the plane was almost over
&gt;&gt; the runway.

&gt;Names, places, dates.. you said it yourself.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; If the airport is not busy or for other reasons there is less pressure

&gt;nope, just the more we go around in circles, the more we get paid.

"/>  I have been under the impression that major airline piots were salaried
rather than hourly... Surely they would work an extra 5-10 minutes in
an especially bad week or even a few extra hours in a really especially
bad case, and especially if necessary to survive something going wrong
that can be survived by merely keeping working if the plane is still
moving or airborne when it should have been parked or whatever thay call
that...

&gt;&gt; highest point when they are dumping.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If they aren't undergoing an emergency, there are designated

&gt;&gt;&gt; Where they are sure that there is no marine traffic when they need to

live with a 1 in 10 million or whatever chance of getting lightly rained

Please note that kerosene at sea level atmospheric pressure has maximum

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank You!!! Finally, a voice of reason. The only logical thing to
&gt;&gt;&gt; do
&gt;&gt;was
&gt;&gt;&gt; to land the plane immediately at the same airport from which it had
&gt;&gt;&gt; just departed and LEAVE IT ON THE GROUND until the engine was
&gt;&gt;&gt; repaired. Any other plan of action was insanely irresponsible,
&gt;&gt;&gt; regardless of motive. If money was part of the motive, then it was
&gt;&gt;&gt; also criminally rresponsible. -Dave

&gt;&gt;Consider the A/C had just departed on an international flight. Do you
&gt;&gt;have any clue as to the &quot;Safe landing Weight vs T/O weight&quot; of the A/C
&gt;&gt;involved. To land the A/C immediately, without burning off/dumping
&gt;&gt;fuel to get the A/C to/below maximum landing weight, unless absolutely
&gt;&gt;necessary would be asking for catastrophic consequences.

&gt; Yep, like a lengthy inspection!

"/> Paperwork!

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Holding time is unpredictable . . . it could be hours. I remember
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;reading one report of a plane (wish I could remember the flight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;number) where the flight was directed into a holding pattern at
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it's destination, was up there for a few hours, ran low on fuel,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;captain reported it to ATC, but made the mistake of ****not
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;declaring an emergency****. So the flight which was running on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fumes was not given clearance to land, and the result was a crash
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in which all aboard died. It was a pilot error for sure, but some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;extra fuel would have helped. -DAve

&gt;&gt;&gt; If I were you, I would find out that flight number, airport,
&gt;&gt;&gt; airline,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and date.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Airlines don't like to have working for them pilots who:

&gt;&gt;&gt; * won't declare a fuel emergency when low enough on fuel to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; unable to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be certain to be able to make at least a couple more loops
&gt;&gt;&gt; through the pattern and land with engine power

&gt;&gt;&gt; * Can't land a plane from anywhere in a holding pattern onto the
&gt;&gt;&gt; runway
&gt;&gt;&gt; without engine power (although may require landing in the wrong
&gt;&gt;&gt; direction and forcing other traffic to evade the powerless plane
&gt;&gt;&gt; if the plane lost engine power only a few thousand feet above the
&gt;&gt;&gt; ground)

&gt;&gt;avoid the powerless plane? HARHARHARHARHARHARHAR

&gt; This specific point is not on avoiding the powerless plane but on
&gt; landing a plane that loses power in the pattern. Easily enough done,
&gt; and in addition easily enough avoided by declaring a fuel emergency.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the plane loses engine power, the pilot merely has to radio
&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Mayday&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; and then is in not much worse trouble for cutting in 1000 feet
&gt;&gt;&gt; behind a plane of similar speed and putting down, and turning onto
&gt;&gt;&gt; the grass on one side of the runway if necessary to avoid
&gt;&gt;&gt; rear-ending the plane ahead of it - or doing whatever else is
&gt;&gt;&gt; necessary to land the plane.

&gt;&gt;Damn, funniest thing I've read since Dave C said a 747-400 will fall
&gt;&gt;like a rock... ...running into the grass to avoid rear-ending another
&gt;&gt;plane? Are you serious? Have you even been to an airport? can you
&gt;&gt;even recognize an airplane two time outta three?

&gt; Sure I can with no training at all! Running into grass is only a
&gt; serious emergency maneuver in a seriously bad situation with the most
&gt; likely cause being not advised to do the obviously advisable course of
&gt; action to zig-zag around the main path of the pattern in order to fall
&gt; back. I also know that activating flaps earlier than usual in a
&gt; descent path to landing will make a plane fall back in the pattern.
&gt; This I learned merely by being a boyfriend of a licensed pilot who is
&gt; not so much as instrument-rated but often rents planes to fly, and
&gt; only in VFR conditions.

&gt; Yes, I can recognize an airplane, top of a scyscraper, top of a
&gt; radio
&gt; antenna towwer, top of a construction crane, or the main nighttime
&gt; light of an airport or even the 12-story-high heliport at a
&gt; semi-downtown major hospital in a big city that I reside just outside
&gt; of, and can tell them apart!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I know of trailing vortices - and enough about them to
&gt;&gt;&gt; believe that
&gt;&gt;&gt; airlines can easily enough have their pilots aware of those and know
&gt;&gt;&gt; where and how they form and how to avoid them (in addition to
&gt;&gt;&gt; normally staying a couple miles or whatever behind the plane ahead
&gt;&gt;&gt; of them because of these vortices).

&gt;&gt;It astounds us that know how much those who dont know dont know

&gt; Surely professional pilots whose jobs are flying jetliners for
&gt; airlines
&gt; would know about these!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Most airliner crashes that I remember have to do with oddball
&gt;&gt;&gt; mechanical
&gt;&gt;&gt; failures, inadequate de-icing in heavy snow, playing &quot;damn the
&gt;&gt;&gt; torpedoes&quot; when a thunderstorm or gusty rain shower is in progress
&gt;&gt;&gt; or likely to be about to occur in a location that would have a bad
&gt;&gt;&gt; scheduling problem from delaying flights around landing through such
&gt;&gt;&gt; things, or rare pilot error. Maybe after that inadequate or cut-rate
&gt;&gt;&gt; maintenance and combinations of landing in fog or heavy snow or
&gt;&gt;&gt; especially heavy rain combined with probably usually at least a
&gt;&gt;&gt; couple other things going wrong. (Not counting terrorist passenger
&gt;&gt;&gt; actions.)

&gt;&gt;Names, places, dates

&gt; As for more oddball problems: How about the Lockerbie disaster
&gt; caused
&gt; by obvious terrorist action, the ValuJet crash in Florida caused by
&gt; hazardous cargo, a flight having takeoff problems in Washington DC
&gt; crashing into a bridge over the Potomac River due to de-icing not
&gt; keeping up with an especially bad brief period of heavy snowfall,
&gt; another crash I believe in Florida where the plane attempted to land
&gt; through an &quot;innocent-enough&quot; (my words, not likely to show up in a
&gt; Google search) rain shower where someone in the flight crew got caught
&gt; recorded with words including &quot;felt good&quot; or maybe &quot;feels good&quot; or
&gt; something of the like in obvious reference to a convective rauin
&gt; shower.
&gt; As far as I remember, the convective rain shower that was &quot;felt
&gt; good&quot; or
&gt; whatever by the pilot occurred in a location, at a time of year and at
&gt; a time of day when true problems from such things are common and false
&gt; alarms from such things are even more common.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Hint: Don't pick flights that land at busy airports in mid or
&gt;&gt;&gt; late
&gt;&gt;&gt; afternoon in spring or summer in much of the USA east of the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Rockies, and in Florida or Gulf Coast areas extend this into early
&gt;&gt;&gt; fall. Maybe also in locations prone to lake effect snow squalls in
&gt;&gt;&gt; times of day and year prone to those (mostly mid or late November to
&gt;&gt;&gt; early February and midday to early evening).

&gt;&gt;Or when the sun is above the horizon, or after it sets(its too dark to
&gt;&gt;see the ground) HARHARHARHARHARHARHAR

&gt; So you want to force me to choose a half of the day to be worse?

&gt; In response I surely mention that the problem that I mentioned is
&gt; mostly midday to early evening with additional &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; times
&gt; being varying with time of day and also with time of year ans also
&gt; varying with location and also with bad exceptions mostly making
&gt; weather reports on the news, or mainly in areas that get the brunt of
&gt;&quot;such turns for the worse&quot;.

&gt; In any case, commercial jetliners fly well above all parts of
&gt;&quot;Boulder
&gt; Winds&quot; unless having to land in such conditions which only occur in a
&gt; small area of the USA...

&gt; Surely every airline that wants to stay in business knows or learns
&gt; quickly about such things!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Reason: Thunderstorms and gusty rain/snow showers are all too
&gt;&gt;&gt; common
&gt;&gt;&gt; then. And they get numerous enough for it to be a nightmare to have
&gt;&gt;&gt; every flight avoid every single one of such storm cells. I remember
&gt;&gt;&gt; a crash from a flight deciding a convective rain shower was a
&gt;&gt;&gt; non-threatening one and a downburst occurred with no warning while
&gt;&gt;&gt; the plane was almost over the runway.

&gt;&gt;Names, places, dates.. you said it yourself.

&gt; That I said myself previoisly but without you mentioning any names,
&gt; places, dates nor flight numbers. I was able to mention a name or two
&gt; and at least a couple places.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the airport is not busy or for other reasons there is less
&gt;&gt;&gt; pressure
&gt;&gt;&gt; to keep a schedule, then pilots are more willing to loop through the
&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern to avoid the all too numerous convective showers of low but
&gt;&gt;&gt; nonzero threat.

&gt;&gt;nope, just the more we go around in circles, the more we get paid.

&gt; I have been under the impression that major airline piots were
&gt; salaried
&gt; rather than hourly... Surely they would work an extra 5-10 minutes
&gt; in an especially bad week or even a few extra hours in a really
&gt; especially bad case, and especially if necessary to survive something
&gt; going wrong that can be survived by merely keeping working if the
&gt; plane is still moving or airborne when it should have been parked or
&gt; whatever thay call that...

"/> Depends on the airline, but most give you a bit extra for flying hours or
duy hours or sectors, whatever.

&gt;&gt; A few *hours* of extra fuel ?

&gt;&gt; You have to be kidding.

&gt; No, that's normal. The alternate airport may be a few
&gt; hours away, there may be delays en route, and the
&gt; aicraft may be put in one or more holding patterns.

&gt; A few hours of reserve fuel is normal. The exact amount
&gt; will depend on the route, the distance from the destination
&gt; to the alternate destination, and the forecast weather at
&gt; the destination(s).

"/> You need to check the rules re alternate destinations. Over water routes
require an alternate within 3 hours max deviation from scheduled route. This
generally has no effect on fuel load.

The rules re alternate destinations take holds &amp; forecasted weather into
consideration.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just as a sidenote. Since BA was formed by amalgamating BEA and BOAC it
&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt; not had single fatal aircraft accident.

&gt;&gt; Let's see. The companies were brought under one management board in
&gt;&gt; 1972. They were formally combined as BA in 1974. Therefore, here are
&gt;&gt; some candidates:

&gt;&gt; Jan 1973 - Vickers Viscount hit mountain on a test flight. (Yes is was a
&gt;&gt; BEA plane, but the companies were combined at that point.

&gt; Since that aircraft wasn't 'technically' BA at that point - I'll argue the
&gt; point.

&gt;&gt; Sep 1976 - BA Trident collided with JAT plane over Yugoslavia

&gt; I'm recall that one - strange that it didn't turn up in the info I'm aware
&gt; of. I
&gt; ought to look into that further

&gt; Controller was jailed as a result of that IIRC.

&gt;&gt; Aug 1985 - British Airtours at Manchester. (It really was part of BA
&gt;&gt; then)

&gt; Uhuh. Wasn't flying as BA though ! Yeah I know it's a technical point if
&gt; you want
&gt; to pursue it. More to the point is that a P&amp;W engine 'blew up'. Combustion
&gt; can
&gt; failed. As I understand it - even great maintenance wouldn't have spotted
&gt; it.

&gt; Remove those 'external' factors and the timeline and BA has never had an
&gt; accident. Ever. Certainly its accident record for a large airline is
&gt; unsurpassable.

&gt; I also have to say that whilst I wil happilly call BA 'boring airline' -
&gt; they get
&gt; you there safely and with a certain panache that is possibly due to the
&gt; fact that
&gt; they don't fire FAs for being over 30 yrs old !

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The dumping areas have minimum altitudes, which are supposed to

&gt;&gt;&gt; So where does an over 200,000 pound fuel dump eventually wind up?
Just
&gt;&gt;&gt; because most of it &quot;evaporates&quot; doesn't mean that it just disappears.

&gt;&gt; The same as any evaporated hydrocarbon, such as oil-based paint,
&gt;&gt; barbecue lighter fluid, or gasoline vapors. Probably chemically combines
&gt;&gt; with other things in the air to add to pollution. I'm sure the EPA has
&gt;&gt; some discussion of the effects of volatile organics. Taking a quick
&gt;&gt; look at their site, 100 tons is about what a city the size of Charlotte,
&gt;&gt; NC, releases in a typical day.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Probably very little would stay permanently suspended in the
atmosphere,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and most would wind up on the ground or water.

&gt;&gt; Or combine with something else in the air under the influence of the
&gt;&gt; sun.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Would the cloud of fuel in the atmosphere be dense enough to be
flammable?

&gt;&gt; It certainly could be. I good practice would be: don't fly under an
&gt;&gt; aircraft dumping fuel.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The dumping areas are located where there is no permanent
settlement, or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; any particularly sensitive environmental areas.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The whole ocean is environmentally sensitive.

&gt;&gt; Not enough to sway the FAA.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Otherwise, no general precautions are taken regarding
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; people who might temporarily be in the area.

&gt;&gt;&gt; So marine traffic is ignored?

&gt;&gt; Most dumping areas are over land. Other than trying to pick areas where
&gt;&gt; there is little human activity, they don't apply any other restrictions.

&gt; A bunch of years ago('85), a Delta 727 lost an engine out of DCA. They
flew
&gt; right over my neighborhood(I grew up really close to DCA) at low
alt.(approx
&gt; 2000') streaming fuel outta the wingtips trying to to get down to landing
&gt; weight. The entire neighborhood smelled of kerosene for hours. Seen it
&gt; happen. This was long before EPA said you couldnt dump over populated
areas...
&gt; was impressive.. Now with most newer a/c dumping fuel to get down to
landing
&gt; weight isnt an issue.. my 757 can take off at 240,000 and land at 198,000
and
&gt; doesnt HAVE a fuel dump system. Landing overweight isnt a problem anymore
as an
&gt; overweight landing inspection isnt a big deal.

&gt; -------------------------------------------------------
&gt; The beatings will continue until morale improves.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;for a few hours, ran low on fuel, captain reported it to ATC, but made the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;mistake of ****not declaring an emergency****. So the flight which was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;running on fumes was not given clearance to land, and the result was a crash
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in which all aboard died. It was a pilot error for sure, but some extra
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fuel would have helped. -DAve

&gt;&gt;&gt; If I were you, I would find out that flight number, airport, airline,
&gt;&gt;&gt; and date.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Airlines don't like to have working for them pilots who:

&gt;&gt;&gt; * won't declare a fuel emergency when low enough on fuel to be unable to
&gt;&gt;&gt; be certain to be able to make at least a couple more loops through the
&gt;&gt;&gt; pattern and land with engine power

&gt;&gt;&gt; * Can't land a plane from anywhere in a holding pattern onto the runway
&gt;&gt;&gt; without engine power (although may require landing in the wrong
&gt;&gt;&gt; direction and forcing other traffic to evade the powerless plane if the
&gt;&gt;&gt; plane lost engine power only a few thousand feet above the ground)

&gt;&gt;avoid the powerless plane? HARHARHARHARHARHARHAR

&gt; This specific point is not on avoiding the powerless plane but on
&gt; landing a plane that loses power in the pattern. Easily enough done, and
&gt; in addition easily enough avoided by declaring a fuel emergency.

"/> Nope, thats not what you wrote, you specifically said the other planes have to
avoid the powerless plane.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; If the plane loses engine power, the pilot merely has to radio &quot;Mayday&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; and then is in not much worse trouble for cutting in 1000 feet behind a
&gt;&gt;&gt; plane of similar speed and putting down, and turning onto the grass on one
&gt;&gt;&gt; side of the runway if necessary to avoid rear-ending the plane ahead of
&gt;&gt;&gt; it - or doing whatever else is necessary to land the plane.

&gt;&gt;Damn, funniest thing I've read since Dave C said a 747-400 will fall like a
&gt;&gt;rock... ...running into the grass to avoid rear-ending another plane? Are you
&gt;&gt;serious? Have you even been to an airport? can you even recognize an airplane
&gt;&gt;two time outta three?

&gt; Sure I can with no training at all! Running into grass is only a
&gt; serious emergency maneuver in a seriously bad situation with the most
&gt; likely cause being not advised to do the obviously advisable course of
&gt; action to zig-zag around the main path of the pattern in order to fall
&gt; back. I also know that activating flaps earlier than usual in a descent
&gt; path to landing will make a plane fall back in the pattern. This I
&gt; learned merely by being a boyfriend of a licensed pilot who is not so much
&gt; as instrument-rated but often rents planes to fly, and only in VFR
&gt; conditions.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yes, I know of trailing vortices - and enough about them to believe that

&gt;&gt;&gt; where and how they form and how to avoid them (in addition to normally
&gt;&gt;&gt; staying a couple miles or whatever behind the plane ahead of them because
&gt;&gt;&gt; of these vortices).

&gt;&gt;It astounds us that know how much those who dont know dont know

&gt; Surely professional pilots whose jobs are flying jetliners for airlines

&gt;&gt;&gt; Most airliner crashes that I remember have to do with oddball mechanical

&gt;&gt;&gt; when a thunderstorm or gusty rain shower is in progress or likely to be
&gt;&gt;&gt; about to occur in a location that would have a bad scheduling problem from
&gt;&gt;&gt; delaying flights around landing through such things, or rare pilot error.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Maybe after that inadequate or cut-rate maintenance and combinations of
&gt;&gt;&gt; landing in fog or heavy snow or especially heavy rain combined with
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably usually at least a couple other things going wrong. (Not counting
&gt;&gt;&gt; terrorist passenger actions.)

&gt;&gt;Names, places, dates

&gt; As for more oddball problems: How about the Lockerbie disaster caused
&gt; by obvious terrorist action, the ValuJet crash in Florida caused by
&gt; hazardous cargo, a flight having takeoff problems in Washington DC
&gt; crashing into a bridge over the Potomac River due to de-icing not keeping
&gt; up with an especially bad brief period of heavy snowfall,

"/> No, actually it wasnt. It was failure of the crew to use ENGINE anti-ice and
setting the correct engine thrust. De-icing and snowfall had nothing to do with
it.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; another crash I
&gt; believe in Florida where the plane attempted to land through an
&gt;&quot;innocent-enough&quot; (my words, not likely to show up in a Google search)
&gt; rain shower where someone in the flight crew got caught recorded with
&gt; words including &quot;felt good&quot; or maybe &quot;feels good&quot; or something of the
&gt; like in obvious reference to a convective rauin shower.

"/> Nope, was a L1011 in Dallas. the one who said that was in a Lear that landed
before the 1011.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; As far as I remember, the convective rain shower that was &quot;felt good&quot; or

&gt; time of day when true problems from such things are common and false
&gt; alarms from such things are even more common.

"/> Nope

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hint: Don't pick flights that land at busy airports in mid or late
&gt;&gt;&gt; afternoon in spring or summer in much of the USA east of the Rockies, and
&gt;&gt;&gt; in Florida or Gulf Coast areas extend this into early fall. Maybe also in
&gt;&gt;&gt; locations prone to lake effect snow squalls in times of day and year prone
&gt;&gt;&gt; to those (mostly mid or late November to early February and midday to
&gt;&gt;&gt; early evening).

&gt;&gt;Or when the sun is above the horizon, or after it sets(its too dark to see the
&gt;&gt;ground) HARHARHARHARHARHARHAR

&gt; So you want to force me to choose a half of the day to be worse?

"/> Pick a time or pick a season or location, YOU said it... again a loon

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In response I surely mention that the problem that I mentioned is
&gt; mostly midday to early evening with additional &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; times
&gt; being varying with time of day and also with time of year ans also varying
&gt; with location and also with bad exceptions mostly making weather reports
&gt; on the news, or mainly in areas that get the brunt of &quot;such turns for the
&gt; worse&quot;.

&gt; In any case, commercial jetliners fly well above all parts of &quot;Boulder
&gt; Winds&quot; unless having to land in such conditions which only occur in a
&gt; small area of the USA...

"/> What area would that be?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Surely every airline that wants to stay in business knows or learns
&gt; quickly about such things!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Reason: Thunderstorms and gusty rain/snow showers are all too common
&gt;&gt;&gt; then. And they get numerous enough for it to be a nightmare to have every
&gt;&gt;&gt; flight avoid every single one of such storm cells. I remember a crash
&gt;&gt;&gt; from a flight deciding a convective rain shower was a non-threatening one
&gt;&gt;&gt; and a downburst occurred with no warning while the plane was almost over
&gt;&gt;&gt; the runway.

&gt;&gt;Names, places, dates.. you said it yourself.

&gt; That I said myself previoisly but without you mentioning any names,
&gt; places, dates nor flight numbers. I was able to mention a name or two and
&gt; at least a couple places.

"/> all incorrect tho... minor point

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt;&gt; If the airport is not busy or for other reasons there is less pressure
&gt;&gt;&gt; to keep a schedule, then pilots are more willing to loop through the

&gt;&gt; A few *hours* of extra fuel ?

&gt;&gt; You have to be kidding.

&gt;&gt; Let's see how much you like it when ticket prices go up to reflect
&gt; carrying all
&gt;&gt; those extra unecessary tons of fuel.

&gt;&gt; Aircraft carry enough 'additional' fuel to allow for diversion in the
&gt;&gt; case
&gt; that
&gt;&gt; the destination airport is closed and additionally some more in the event
&gt; of
&gt;&gt; holding time.

&gt;&gt; Graham

&gt; Holding time is unpredictable . . . it could be hours. I remember reading
&gt; one report of a plane (wish I could remember the flight number) where the
&gt; flight was directed into a holding pattern at it's destination, was up
&gt; there
&gt; for a few hours, ran low on fuel, captain reported it to ATC, but made the
&gt; mistake of ****not declaring an emergency****. So the flight which was
&gt; running on fumes was not given clearance to land, and the result was a
&gt; crash
&gt; in which all aboard died. It was a pilot error for sure, but some extra
&gt; fuel would have helped. -DAve

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Gimli Glider story; it doesn't actually fill one with confidence) or

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank You!!! Finally, a voice of reason. The only logical thing to do
&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt; to land the plane immediately at the same airport from which it had

&gt;&gt; I already mentioned the allowance for holding.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A few hours of reserve fuel is normal. The exact amount
&gt;&gt;&gt; will depend on the route, the distance from the destination

"/> Right. What everyone EXPECTS, of course, based on
those icons of scientific educational film-making, is that the
aircraft will immediately drop out from underneath you, at
something like 10,000 FPM, and somehow will leave you
sitting there in mid-air, looking rather silly, until the reality of
the situation becomes clear in your mind - at which point
you, too, drop straight down leaving only a cloud of dust
(and just where did THAT come from?) and possibly a
small sign reading &quot;OOOPS!&quot; in your place....:-)

I am told, at least, that should you manage to get the wings to
actually come off, the results are both a bit more exciting and
considerably less recoverable, but for some reason my CFI
did not see fit to demonstrate that particular scenario.

"/> As a pilot with many hours in types that can dump fuel, I can assure you that
this is absolutely false. During fuel dumps, the fuel evaporates almost
instantly. There is no chance of it hitting the ground unless the aircraft
was at a very low altitude, like sitting on the apron. There is NO chance
of it being solid either, even if it was poured onto the ground in Siberia.

Jet-A is much more volatile then water, so your comparison is void. In
addition it is dumped into slipstream of several hundred knots. That doesn't
mean it is not bad for the environment though. Raw VOCs cause smog and other
problems, it is much better to burn the fuel then to dump it.

I'm curious where you obtain such false information.

1.) There was never any question about whether the aircraft would land at a
suitable airport.
2.) The crew had planned to land at Manchester, but was hoping for favorable
winds that would permit London.
3.) Almost all aircraft flying non stop over the Atlantic are dispatched not to
their destination but to an intermediary point, such as an airport in Iceland.
As soon as it is confirmed that winds are favorable for the final destination,
the flight is redispatched. All of this happens in the background.
4.) Although the flight under discussion could have continued to London, the
crew elected to go to Manchester to ensure more fuel reserves upon landing.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Funniest thing I've heard in days!

&gt;&gt;&gt;OK, how would YOU describe it when (not if) both wings stall due to all
&gt;&gt;&gt;engines starved for fuel?

&gt;&gt; Pilot error by pilots unqualified to fly a jetliner, and preferably not
&gt;&gt; yet out of flight school.
&gt;&gt; Oh, and planes flown by anyone that rightfully made it out of training
&gt;&gt; can recover from a stall (even with no engine power at all). The plane
&gt;&gt; drops anywhere from less than 100 feet (for smaller, slower planes) to I
&gt;&gt; would guess a couple thousand feet for a jetliner. So a jetliner that
&gt;&gt; stalls at 29,000 feet drops to 27,000 or maybe 26,000 feet...
&gt;&gt; Then again, I would think a jetliner pilot can easily avoid a stall if
&gt;&gt; engine failure or additional engine failure occurs. If the plane is
&gt;&gt; nosed-down before it slows to below stall speed, it will lose less
&gt;&gt; altitude and do so more gently than if it stalls.

&gt; OK, you run out of fuel in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, hundreds of
&gt; miles from the nearest runway. DO EVERYTHING RIGHT and see how far you get
&gt; before you are piloting a submarine. -Dave

"/> That's been done, and no submarine existed.

&gt;&gt; Not to mention plain wrong

&gt;&gt; There's little possibility of this happening, even if a second engine had
&gt;&gt; failed
&gt;&gt; in mid atlantic there are diversion options in Newfoundland, Greenland,
&gt;&gt; Iceland and Ireland.

&gt;&gt; If everything does go wrong however a 747 has a pretty good glide ratio
&gt;&gt; of around 25 to 1. There's a rather famous example of a canadian
&gt;&gt; 767 making a succesful unpowered landing after running out of fuel

&gt;&gt; http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/tracks/gimli.html

&gt; More engine failures wasn't the only possibility that the pilots had to
&gt; account for. The more immediate danger was running out of fuel somewhere in
&gt; the middle of the ocean. The pilots gambled that they would have enough
&gt; fuel, and they darn near killed hundreds of people because their
&gt; calculations were a little off. Again, they barely made dry land. What if
&gt; their range (which they'd already fucked up in estimating) had been a couple
&gt; hundred miles shorter? This was a huge gamble that the pilots took. At the
&gt; very least, they should lose their pilots licenses PERMANENTLY. -Dave

"/> Your fear is caused by a lack of knowledge here. There was no danger of runing
out of fuel, immediate or otherwise. There was no gamble. Even if there had
been a loss of two more engines, they could have easily landed at any number of
alternates along the way. Aircraft are rarely more then 2 hours away from
alternates over the north atlantic.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Surely professional pilots whose jobs are flying jetliners for
&gt;&gt;&gt; airlines
&gt;&gt;&gt; would know about these!

&gt;&gt; You'd think, but apparently (based on the opinions of many of
&gt;&gt; the &quot;experts&quot; in this forum) the airlines are simply grabbing people
&gt;&gt; at random and putting them in the cockpit. I can at least hope that
&gt;&gt; they'd start drawing names from the passenger manifest on any
&gt;&gt; given flight, since (as long as they're letting anyone fly these
&gt;&gt; things anyway) that would give me a fair shot. I'd sure love to get
&gt;&gt; MY turn at flying a 747, for instance, especially as it seems that
&gt;&gt; you don't need any experience or training to do this. Or, again,
&gt;&gt; so sayeth the pundits.

&gt;&gt; I can see it now: &quot;Mr. Myers, your upgrade has gone through -
&gt;&gt; would you like First Class, or Left Front?&quot; Presumably they would
&gt;&gt; then hand me the 747 User's Manual (A Microsoft Flight Simulator
&gt;&gt; Product), the keys, and a professional-looking cap, and send me
&gt;&gt; on my merry way.

&gt; You're not up for it.....if you'd read yer MS 'User's Manual' you'd
&gt; know you don't need keys to start a 747.

"/> that's right, you can easily hotwire them or even just ust the winshield

Thankfully it's not something that troubles modern transport a/c.

I have posted elsewhere in this thread that the UK term 'superstall' is
equivalent to the US term 'deep stall' - meaning an uncorrected stall.

It is regularly fatal in a/c that have a configuration that can't ( easily )
recover from such a situation and I know someone who has lost a family member (
test flight crew ) who falls into that category.

&gt;&gt; There's only a limited amount of evaporation in a large fuel dump. Some
&gt;&gt; of it will hit the ground as a liquid or solid. The same is true for
&gt;&gt; other fluids dumped from the aircraft, as a recent case of a frozen
&gt;&gt; block of sewage landing on the ground demonstrated.

&gt; As a pilot with many hours in types that can dump fuel, I can assure you
&gt; that
&gt; this is absolutely false. During fuel dumps, the fuel evaporates almost
&gt; instantly. There is no chance of it hitting the ground unless the
&gt; aircraft
&gt; was at a very low altitude, like sitting on the apron. There is NO
&gt; chance
&gt; of it being solid either, even if it was poured onto the ground in
&gt; Siberia.

&gt; Jet-A is much more volatile then water, so your comparison is void. In
&gt; addition it is dumped into slipstream of several hundred knots. That
&gt; doesn't
&gt; mean it is not bad for the environment though. Raw VOCs cause smog and
&gt; other

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank You!!! Finally, a voice of reason. The only logical thing to do
&gt;&gt;was
&gt;&gt;&gt; to land the plane immediately at the same airport from which it had
just
&gt;&gt;&gt; departed and LEAVE IT ON THE GROUND until the engine was repaired. Any
&gt;&gt;&gt; other plan of action was insanely irresponsible, regardless of motive.
If
&gt;&gt;&gt; money was part of the motive, then it was also criminally
&gt;&gt;&gt; rresponsible. -Dave

&gt;&gt;Consider the A/C had just departed on an international flight. Do you
have
&gt;&gt;any clue as to the &quot;Safe landing Weight vs T/O weight&quot; of the A/C
involved.
&gt;&gt;To land the A/C immediately, without burning off/dumping fuel to get the
A/C
&gt;&gt;to/below maximum landing weight, unless absolutely necessary would be
asking
&gt;&gt;for catastrophic consequences.

&gt; Yep, like a lengthy inspection!

&gt;&gt; And note that _both_ engines failed, thanks to a common point of

&gt;&gt; engines failing is greatly increased.

"/> This statement is mostly nonsensical. There is no sudden increase
in the likelihood of the remaining engines failing just because one
engine has failed; the engines do not &quot;know anything&quot; about each
others' conditions. The only place where you do get any sort of
such commonality would be in the case of shared systems, such as
the aforementioned fuel - and if you're out of gas, you're out of gas.
It makes no difference if you had four engines, or one, or twelve
drinking from the same tank once that tank is empty. The same
applies to other such &quot;common points&quot; - if it truly is common, things
go to hell all across the board, very quickly. But a broken
primary gonkulator bearing on Engine #1 doesn't automatically
mean that Engines #2, #3, and #4 are at higher risk for the same
thing.

Further, do you not think that in the case of any failure, the crew
is very likely going to be immediately checking said common
systems for an indication of trouble? Do you think that if
engine #1, say, fails, then the crew just ignores it, bumps up
the other three throttles a bit, and goes on their merry way without
checking ANYTHING further?

Your statement might have some merit, in terms of the overall
population of a given engine design, IF you were in the early days
of the history of that engine; in such cases, any failure adds to the
base of knowledge from which you will generate the statistics that
apply to that population. But once you're far enough into the design's
life to have some understanding of the weak points and their
likelihood of failure, the NEXT such failure affects those statistics
only very slightly, and again only with respect to the population as
a whole; there is nothing magical about the effect of that failure on
the other engines that happen to be attached to the same aircraft,
in the vast majority of cases.

As I remember the anecdotes from British Aerospace tech reps when I
worked on the BAC 111 in the '70s, one of the outstanding human
stories was the professionalism of the chief test pilot. He
apparently continued to broadcast every detail he could of what was
happening, to assist investigation, until the moment when the plane
hit the ground.

http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/Concept2Reality/deep_stall.html

&quot;In the early 1960s, four new T-tail jet transports (the de Havilland
Trident, the Boeing 727, the BAC 111, and the McDonnell Douglas DC-9)
emerged within the highly competitive transport market. These aircraft
shared many common configuration features in addition to the T-tail
arrangement: aft-fuselage-mounted engines and all-moving
(variable-incidence) horizontal tails, for instance. In Britain, the
de Havilland Aircraft Company, Ltd. (who later merged with Hawker
Siddeley Aviation, Ltd.), developed the Trident transport, which first
flew on January 9, 1962. In the United States, Boeing brought forth
its new model, the 727, which first flew on February 9, 1963. The BAC
111 first flew later that year on August 20, 1963. The Douglas DC-9
provided additional competition with a first flight that occurred a
few years later, in February 1965.

The BAC 111 suffered a major setback during early flight testing of
the prototype on October 22, 1963; the aircraft was destroyed and crew
members lost their lives in a fatal accident during tests to evaluate
the stall characteristics of the configuration. The accident
investigation board conducted an exhaustive investigation of the
aerodynamic, stability, and control characteristics of the BAC 111 and
concluded that the cause of the accident was an unrecoverable
deep-stall phenomenon, which was precipitated by the geometric and
aerodynamic characteristics of the configuration. In particular,
wind-tunnel tests indicated that at high angles of attack near and
above those associated with wing stall, the low-energy wakes of the
stalled wing and fuselage-mounted engine nacelles impinged on the
horizontal tail and significantly reduced its stabilizing effect.
Also, the low-energy wakes severely reduced the effectiveness of the
horizontal tail as a longitudinal control. These characteristics
manifest themselves as an insidious poststall condition in which the
angle of attack of the aircraft would increase to very large values
(in excess of 40?) in response to the loss of stability, and the pilot
would be unable to recover from the condition because of the loss of
horizontal tail control effectiveness. During this entire sequence,
the attitude of the aircraft fuselage would vary over a relatively
small angular range, and the uncontrollable aircraft would descend
steeply in an almost horizontal, wings-level attitude with a high rate
of descent to an unsurvivable crash.

The BAC 111 design was subsequently modified to incorporate a stick
pusher, modified leading-edge camber, and powered elevator controls to
prevent the aircraft from entering high-angle-of-attack conditions.&quot;

Also:

http://www.airliners.net/info/stats.main?id=54

&quot;British United Airways placed a launch order for 10 of the new jets,
then known as the BAC-111, in May 1961. The new aircraft took to the
skies for the first time on August 20 1963, while the first production
Series 200 first flew on December 19 1963. Certification was
eventually awarded on April 6 1965, following a troubled flight test
program, during which one prototype crashed with the loss of its crew,
the cause attributed to deep stall from the rear engine and the T-tail
configuration. With the deep stall issue resolved, the BAC-111 entered
service on April 6 1965.&quot;

&gt; Pilots aren't generally qualified to decide whether an engine failure is
&gt; acceptable for continuing or not. They are constrained to make the
&gt; decision, but that doesn't mean that their decision is always right.
&gt; The smart pilot will land as soon as possible and let an expert take a
&gt; look at the engine to see what's going on.

"/> However, the pilots in this case did not, independently,
make the particular
decision you mentioned. There
are operating procedures and guidelines, information and
recommendations provided by both the aircraft manufacturer
and presumably the airline, which assisted in that decision.
The failed engine was already failed; it could not get worse,
once it was confirmed to be safely shut down. The only
decision to be made then is with respect to the health of the
other three engines, and that's exactly what a pilot IS charged
with monitoring throughout the flight anyway - so no additional
responsibility comes in there. The aircraft was considered, both
by the pilots operating it and per the standard procedures of
the airline (and based on the recommendations of the
manufacturer), as safe to continue on the intended route with
three good engines. Were this not the case, you might have
a point; as it is, there was no need to &quot;land as soon as possible&quot;;
the failed engine was not going to get any worse, and there
was no good reason to expect trouble with any of the remaining
three (any more than there had been when all were operating).

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;&gt; In the case at hand, it doesn't take too long to be REASONABLY
&gt;&gt; sure that the fuel system, etc., is behaving itself and that it
&gt;&gt; still contains enough go-juice to feed the remaining engines.

&gt; Reasonably sure wouldn't be enough for me in a transatlantic crossing,
&gt; but perhaps some pilots like to live dangerously.

"/>&quot;Reasonably sure&quot; is, in reality, all you ever have. It is not
a question of living dangerously, but rather making decisions
based on established guidelines and the training and experience
of the personnel in question. Exactly how many hours of 747
time do YOU have, and/or when did you get your A&amp;P ticket?

&gt;&gt; This statement is mostly nonsensical. There is no sudden increase
&gt;&gt; in the likelihood of the remaining engines failing just because one
&gt;&gt; engine has failed; the engines do not &quot;know anything&quot; about each
&gt;&gt; others' conditions.

&gt; That depends on the cause of the engine failure. A common cause may
&gt; affect all engines at some point. And to be absolutely sure of the
&gt; cause, you have to land and have the plane inspected.

"/> Of course; but then, to be &quot;absolutely sure,&quot; the plane should
be given a complete inspection (preferably including at least
a partial engine tear-down) by a team of qualified mechanics

not?

&gt;&gt; The only place where you do get any sort of
&gt;&gt; such commonality would be in the case of shared systems, such as

&gt; True ... except that it doesn't always happen very quickly. If you
&gt; continue flying, it may happen in the middle of nowhere.

"/> As has already been pointed out, &quot;the middle of nowhere&quot; isn't
a particularly meaningful phrase here. The concern is how far,
at any given moment, a suitable landing field is from the present
position of the aircraft. What do you believe the maximum value
of that figure is during a typical trans-Atlantic crossing? How
many engines on a typically-loaded 747 have to be operating
to safely cover that distance and land from a typical cruise
altitude? Do you know? If not, how can you possibly claim to
be making any sort of reasoned commentary re this situation?

parachute as a recovery mechanism let the manufacturer explore
the limits of the aircraft's performance without imposing undue

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; There's nothing absurd or extreme about that.

"/> There could very well be. A given aircraft will require a certain
amount of power (thrust) to safely get into the air at a given
weight and under a given set of ambient conditions; that same
aircraft will require considerably less power to maintain flight, or
even climb at a reasonable rate, once in cruise. It clearly requires
far less than that, even, to land. Therefore, it is perfectly reasonable
to assert that a given design may require all engines functional for
a safe takeoff, but may not require them all functional for continued
safe operation once aloft. (In fact, there have been a number of
examples of aircraft designs in which shutting down a powerplant
after takeoff was normal procedure, as there was no real need
to have all the engines gulping fuel. No, there were not mainstream
commerical-transport designs - but it IS definitely possible.)

VERY STRONGLY suggests that the risk of similar failures
occuring in the remaining engines is insignificant; in fact, I would go
so far as to defy you to identify even a single flight in which the
failure of one engine was followed by a similar failure in another on
the same aircraft, and yet these were NOT due to a catastrophic
failure of a common system which affected all simultaneously
(e.g., fuel exhaustion, the intake of foreign material as in the
famous &quot;ash cloud&quot; incident, etc.) or where the second failure
was not the result of immediately obvious damage resulting
from the first (i.e., uncontained release of engine parts striking
or being ingested by an adjacent engine).

How many of the &quot;pilots&quot; arguing here are actually major airline
multi-engine pilots? Not very many if you base it on the maturity
level of the comments. Or, to put it another way, god (any god!) help
us if they are.

I don't pretend to be a current mender or bender. I am an ex-avionics
engineer twenty years out of date and fully aware of that fact. But I
didn't lose my intelligence as I lost my currency.

I'm also a current passenger who would be terrified to fly in any
aircraft commanded by some of the &quot;pilots&quot; posting here, particularly
considering some of their comments on aircraft safety.

It's a scary feeling at times knowing what those odd noises and bumps
mean that you shouldn't be hearing and feeling at that moment during
the trip, sitting back there in steerage 10,000m up and 2000km from
the nearest landfall.

That's when you sincerely hope that the guys up the front are much
more mature than those jocks you knew back in your military days -
possibly a forlorn hope reading the posts here. But then, I wouldn't
have thought that many major airline pilots would have the time or the
inclination to spend the hours that these guys appear to on usenet.

"/> It is common practice to use the T-Handle to shut down an engine having
problems. Pulling the T-Handle not only shuts down the engine in question
but also isolates it for all practical purposes. By isolating I mean
shutting off fuel flow, hydraulics, &amp; electrical to/from the engine.

A/C jet engines are designed so oil is constantly fed to the bearings when
the engine is wind milling, so the bearings will not seize causing the
engine to seize.

Once the engine was secured a visual inspection would tell if there were
residual problems such as damage from an uncontained failure if such
occurred or continuing fire. If there is no visual indication of uncontained
failure or residual fire the only potential remaining problem is the
possibility of loss of engine oil allowing the engine to seize. If the
engine does seize, it is a relatively slow process. A engine seizing under
these circumstances only adds additional drag which can be easily
compensated for.

Once the engine is initially shut down, if there is no residual fire or
structural damage if shut down was necessitated by an uncontained failure.
the engine presents very little if any further hazard.

&gt;&gt; That depends on the cause of the engine failure. A common cause may

"/> From the standpoint of safety, however, that knowledge

somehow producing less thrust, for the same reason that it's
really hard to fall down off the floor, nor is the drag it's now
causing somehow going to magically increase. Assuming it
is windmilling (a fair assumption), yes, it could in fact be doing
things to itself that will turn out to be very expensive - although
the likelihood is that if it IS damaging itself in that manner, it will
get through the vast majority of such damage before the plane
could possibly be landed and shut down anyway. The engine
is presumably not receiving fuel at this point (and that is
something that should be apparent to the crew), and since it
is no longer generating power it is extremely unlikely to be
shedding any parts at a speed or in a direction which will
be a safety concern. But where's the added safety risk come
in?

&gt;&gt;&gt; And note that _both_ engines failed, thanks to a common point of
&gt;&gt;&gt; failure. Whenever one engine fails, there's always the chance that
&gt;&gt;&gt; such
&gt;&gt;&gt; a common point of failure is a fault, in which case the chance of other
&gt;&gt;&gt; engines failing is greatly increased.

&gt; This statement is mostly nonsensical. There is no sudden increase
&gt; in the likelihood of the remaining engines failing just because one
&gt; engine has failed; the engines do not &quot;know anything&quot; about each
&gt; others' conditions. The only place where you do get any sort of
&gt; such commonality would be in the case of shared systems, such as
&gt; the aforementioned fuel - and if you're out of gas, you're out of gas.
&gt; It makes no difference if you had four engines, or one, or twelve
&gt; drinking from the same tank once that tank is empty. The same
&gt; applies to other such &quot;common points&quot; - if it truly is common, things
&gt; go to hell all across the board, very quickly. But a broken
&gt; primary gonkulator bearing on Engine #1 doesn't automatically
&gt; mean that Engines #2, #3, and #4 are at higher risk for the same
&gt; thing.

&gt; Further, do you not think that in the case of any failure, the crew
&gt; is very likely going to be immediately checking said common
&gt; systems for an indication of trouble? Do you think that if
&gt; engine #1, say, fails, then the crew just ignores it, bumps up
&gt; the other three throttles a bit, and goes on their merry way without
&gt; checking ANYTHING further?

&gt; Your statement might have some merit, in terms of the overall
&gt; population of a given engine design, IF you were in the early days
&gt; of the history of that engine; in such cases, any failure adds to the
&gt; base of knowledge from which you will generate the statistics that
&gt; apply to that population. But once you're far enough into the design's
&gt; life to have some understanding of the weak points and their
&gt; likelihood of failure, the NEXT such failure affects those statistics
&gt; only very slightly, and again only with respect to the population as
&gt; a whole; there is nothing magical about the effect of that failure on
&gt; the other engines that happen to be attached to the same aircraft,

&gt;&gt; Bob Myers writes:

&gt;&gt;&gt; This statement is mostly nonsensical. There is no sudden increase
&gt;&gt;&gt; in the likelihood of the remaining engines failing just because one
&gt;&gt;&gt; engine has failed; the engines do not &quot;know anything&quot; about each
&gt;&gt;&gt; others' conditions.

&gt;&gt; That depends on the cause of the engine failure. A common cause may
&gt;&gt; affect all engines at some point. And to be absolutely sure of the
&gt;&gt; cause, you have to land and have the plane inspected.

&gt; Of course; but then, to be &quot;absolutely sure,&quot; the plane should
&gt; be given a complete inspection (preferably including at least
&gt; a partial engine tear-down) by a team of qualified mechanics
&gt; prior to each and every flight. Are you suggesting that this should
&gt; be adopted as a standard operating procedure? Why or why
&gt; not?

&gt;&gt;&gt; The only place where you do get any sort of
&gt;&gt;&gt; such commonality would be in the case of shared systems, such as
&gt;&gt;&gt; the aforementioned fuel - and if you're out of gas, you're out of gas.

&gt;&gt; There's more to common systems than just running out of gas.

&gt; Please demonstrate your understanding of the systems of
&gt; a 747, and name, say, three that are both shared across all
&gt; engines and without redundancy.

&gt;&gt;&gt; The same
&gt;&gt;&gt; applies to other such &quot;common points&quot; - if it truly is common, things
&gt;&gt;&gt; go to hell all across the board, very quickly.

&gt;&gt; True ... except that it doesn't always happen very quickly. If you
&gt;&gt; continue flying, it may happen in the middle of nowhere.

&gt; As has already been pointed out, &quot;the middle of nowhere&quot; isn't
&gt; a particularly meaningful phrase here. The concern is how far,
&gt; at any given moment, a suitable landing field is from the present
&gt; position of the aircraft. What do you believe the maximum value
&gt; of that figure is during a typical trans-Atlantic crossing? How
&gt; many engines on a typically-loaded 747 have to be operating
&gt; to safely cover that distance and land from a typical cruise
&gt; altitude? Do you know? If not, how can you possibly claim to
&gt; be making any sort of reasoned commentary re this situation?

&gt;&gt;&gt; But a broken
&gt;&gt;&gt; primary gonkulator bearing on Engine #1 doesn't automatically
&gt;&gt;&gt; mean that Engines #2, #3, and #4 are at higher risk for the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.

&gt;&gt; But unless you're a mechanic, you don't really know.

&gt; You seem to be under the impression that the pilots have
&gt; effectively zero knowledge of the functional characteristics of
&gt; their aircraft's systems. On what do you base that belief?

"/> His own lack of knowledge.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers, Alan

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank You!!! Finally, a voice of reason. The only logical thing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to land the plane immediately at the same airport from which it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; had just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; departed and LEAVE IT ON THE GROUND until the engine was repaired.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Any other plan of action was insanely irresponsible, regardless
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; of motive.
&gt;&gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; money was part of the motive, then it was also criminally

&gt;&gt; Flying faulty jumbo across Atlantic saves BA £100,000
&gt;&gt; By Ben Webster

&gt; From the LA Times story a little clarification on fuel situation in
&gt; Manchester

&gt; On Flight 268, these fuel-consumption problems were exacerbated by tail
&gt; winds weaker than anticipated. It eventually became clear that the plane
&gt; could not make it to Heathrow.

&gt;&quot;There were several alternative landing fields,&quot; Hayes said. &quot;The pilot
&gt; chose Manchester&quot; — 163 miles from London.

&gt; He said the pilot made a routine landing with enough fuel on board to
&gt; satisfy international safety regulations.

"/> fine, no problem then..
and he had a very large number of fields to choose from on the way to Manch
as well.

&gt; There are lots of things common to all engines.

"/> Right. They tend to be made of metal, not cardboard. (This
would argue that a trained metallurgist should be required in
the flight crew, right?) Jet aircraft engines tend to be roughly
cylindrical objects with lots of little hoses and fittings hidden
by the cowling (OK, now we need to add a topologist and
a plumber). They've got a lot of individual parts (we should
probably add an accountant to make sure we're keeping track
of them). Oh, darn, we're running out of space for the
passengers...

Of course, this neglects the fact that the &quot;lots of things which
are common to all engines&quot; are exactly the sort of basic,
COMMON facts that we might reasonably expect our
Dauntless Aviators to already be familiar with, right? In short,
both Rolls-Royce and P&amp;W build engines around the same
set of physical laws - so once you learn how, say, a jet
engine (or even a flush toilet) fundamentally works, you
DON'T need to completely relearn those fundamentals
just because you're faced with a different manufacturer's
product, any more than you need to start driver's training
all over again just because you bought a Buick to replace
your Honda.

&gt;&gt; You seem to be under the impression that the pilots have
&gt;&gt; effectively zero knowledge of the functional characteristics of
&gt;&gt; their aircraft's systems.

&gt; No, I have the certainty that many of them know far less than they
&gt; believe. They are still the primary cause of air accidents.

"/> Finally, something I can agree with, in part. Pilot error continues
to be the major cause of accidents, as far as I know, in essentially
every category of aircraft and operation (outside of the military,
where such factors as &quot;getting shot at&quot; also enter into the
picture). However, in saying that we have to also acknowledge
that the reason for this is not that pilot skill is on average
unacceptably bad, but rather that the mechanical reliability of the
aircraft they are now flying is amazingly good. Things just DO NOT
break all that often, or at least not in such a way that poses a clear
and immediate threat to the continued safety of the flight. That
goes to the heart of what's being argued here. The failure of an
engine (or at least the malfunctioning of an engine to the point where
its shutdown is the best course of action) is clearly an extremely
rare event in modern-day commercial aviation. This, coupled with
the fact that the aircraft in question is perfectly capable of proceeding
with and completing its flight with three operating engines, and still
have ample safety margin with respect to its flight performance,
says that the pilots in this case did nothing wrong at all. In short,
it could be stated with a high degree of confidence that the aircraft,
when assumed to have four functional engines, had a 99.9999...whatever
percent chance of completing its flight without incident. The loss of
one engine, after takeoff, surely does reduce that number - but
unless you can show a valid reason for claiming that the reduction
is visible at a level higher than several places to the right of the
decimal point, I will maintain that you are doing nothing more here
than entertaining an irrational fear.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Then why would you believe that the functional fourth engine

&gt;&gt; I have high standards for safety. Apparently, not everyone maintains
&gt;&gt; standards this high. British Airways obviously does not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Without knowing the exact cause, you cannot KNOW
&gt;&gt;&gt; whether or not the failure in question indicates that the rest of
&gt;&gt;&gt; the fleet is in immediate danger; the reasonable course of action,
&gt;&gt;&gt; then, would be to immediately ground all 747s upon the engine
&gt;&gt;&gt; failure of this one, until we KNOW...right?

&gt;&gt; No. You ground the 747 with the problem and examine it as soon as
&gt;&gt; possible. You certainly do the fleet no favors by staying in the air.

&gt; You land &amp; examine/repair the A/C with a problem in a prudent manner.

&gt; You obviously are clueless re maint &amp; failure tracking protocols for A/C
&gt; components. Detailed records are kept fleet wide on component wear/failure
&gt; based on a common denominator. Specified components are changed on a
regular
&gt; schedule. These schedules are adjusted based on operational experience.

"/> He obviously has no clue about the steps he would take *if*
he was an aircraft mechanic. First thing he would do after
replacing some part would be to do an idle run or take the
A/C to a safe area and do a power run. And how would he
evaluate the success of his wrenching?
By observing the very same instruments that the the flight
crew watches all day!

Aah, for the good old days when the computers and the
EEC first arrived on the scene. After jotting down some
obscure codes stored in the EEC memory, one would
go back to the shack and check for a chart on one roll
of microfilm that would refer you to another roll or rolls
that would give instructions for the required test or fix.
Finally you knew what needed to be repaired.
Now, instead of cross-referencing a bunch of codes
all you need to do is sit in the Captain's seat and
bring up the correct page on the CRT and read it
in plain old english! Similar to the way the crew learned
of the problem to begin with!

&gt;&gt; By this argument, it is impossible for a failure to ever
&gt;&gt; occur, assuming that the component or device in question
&gt;&gt; has been the subject of a &quot;thorough inspection&quot; by those
&gt;&gt; who &quot;truly know&quot; their subject. Are you sure you want
&gt;&gt; to be saying that?

&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Finally, something I can agree with, in part. Pilot error continues
&gt;&gt; to be the major cause of accidents, as far as I know, in essentially
&gt;&gt; every category of aircraft and operation (outside of the military,
&gt;&gt; where such factors as &quot;getting shot at&quot; also enter into the
&gt;&gt; picture). However, in saying that we have to also acknowledge
&gt;&gt; that the reason for this is not that pilot skill is on average
&gt;&gt; unacceptably bad, but rather that the mechanical reliability of the
&gt;&gt; aircraft they are now flying is amazingly good.

&gt; How do you know that it is the latter, and not the former?

&gt; Why are pilots less reliable than their aircraft?

&gt;&gt; Things just DO NOT
&gt;&gt; break all that often, or at least not in such a way that poses a clear
&gt;&gt; and immediate threat to the continued safety of the flight.

&gt; Yes, and that makes pilots complacent. Sure, one engine stops, but
&gt; engines hardly ever break down, so let's just keep flying.

&gt;&gt; In short,
&gt;&gt; it could be stated with a high degree of confidence that the aircraft,
&gt;&gt; when assumed to have four functional engines, had a 99.9999...whatever
&gt;&gt; percent chance of completing its flight without incident.

&gt;&quot;Whatever&quot;?

&gt;&gt; The loss of one engine, after takeoff, surely does reduce
&gt;&gt; that number ...

&gt; By how much? Weren't you asking for quantification a while ago?

&lt;snip&gt;

I did post on the incident that causes me to feel this way; it was an
Alitalia 747 (I still remember the name on the nose - &quot;Carlo del
Prete&quot;) which had an emergency landing at Canberra in the late '70s.
The internal mag-alloy gearbox had ground to a powder, which, apart
from some faint smoke had no external indications. When the aircraft
stopped and the nacelle cowl was dropped, it erupted in whitish flames
and billowing smoke. The heat was incredibly intense, but it was
extinguished before it spread up to the wing (from memory, CO2 had no
effect, and in fact seemed to feed the fire, I think we had to use BCF
eventually in the panic).

So, all external appearances were OK, but in this case the pilots did
the right thing after shutting down the engine and landed. Later
investigation indicated that the fire would most likely have occurred
at some time in flight if the flight had continued. I am no expert on
engines, that was advice back through the reporting system to us.

From memory, the engine was Pratt and Whitney.

I have attempted to find a report on it, but it appears to be too old
or just wasn't listed. Somewhere I have some b&amp;w photos of it taken by
a RAAF photographer.

&gt; I did post on the incident that causes me to feel this way; it was an
&gt; Alitalia 747 (I still remember the name on the nose - &quot;Carlo del
&gt; Prete&quot;) which had an emergency landing at Canberra in the late '70s.
&gt; The internal mag-alloy gearbox had ground to a powder, which, apart
&gt; from some faint smoke had no external indications. When the aircraft
&gt; stopped and the nacelle cowl was dropped, it erupted in whitish flames
&gt; and billowing smoke. The heat was incredibly intense, but it was
&gt; extinguished before it spread up to the wing (from memory, CO2 had no
&gt; effect, and in fact seemed to feed the fire, I think we had to use BCF
&gt; eventually in the panic).

&gt; So, all external appearances were OK, but in this case the pilots did
&gt; the right thing after shutting down the engine and landed. Later
&gt; investigation indicated that the fire would most likely have occurred
&gt; at some time in flight if the flight had continued. I am no expert on
&gt; engines, that was advice back through the reporting system to us.

&gt; From memory, the engine was Pratt and Whitney.

&gt; I have attempted to find a report on it, but it appears to be too old
&gt; or just wasn't listed. Somewhere I have some b&amp;w photos of it taken by
&gt; a RAAF photographer.

"/> so, by this logic, no airplane should fly anywhere because somewhere during

This is a complete no-brainer, you gear-heads. Read:

------------------

A JUMBO jet captain was forced to make an emergency landing after running low
on fuel following the mid-air failure of one of its four engines.

The British Airways flight 268, which had 351 passengers on board, was met by
a fleet of fire engines on Manchester Airport's runway 2 after the captain
made a mayday call to the control tower yesterday afternoon.

The captain first noticed a problem an hour after take-off when engine number
two on the port side of his aircraft experienced a power surge. The pilot
switched off the broken engine and continued his journey across America with
the three remaining engines.

Although he had calculated that the plane could safely make its destination,
the plane encountered some unexpected headwind over the Atlantic Ocean, which
depleted its fuel reserves further.

The pilot decided not to risk flying to Heathrow and made a mayday call asking
to land at Manchester without wasting any more fuel by waiting in the skies.

---------------------

How far is Manchester from Heathrow anyway?? If they couldn't make it even
that little bit extra overthere, I'd say they &quot;fjucked&quot; up.

And you be (*&amp;#$(*&amp;#$ sure this will affect my decision to fly BA or not, and
I would hope many other customers would feel the same.

Say I drive a car and I get a flat tyre and replace it with my (one) spare. Or
I lose my left front light, or anything else relatively minor. Am I still
safe? Sure. Would I drive across a desert without getting repairs first? No
way. And while being responsible for passengers? That's where it really
becomes a no-brainer.

Anyone who doesn't understand that should stick to flying himself in a single
seater, or, preferably, Microsoft FS.

&gt;&gt; That is the crux of the matter. There was no way to tell what was
&gt;&gt; going on inside there while it still windmilled. The fact that nothing
&gt;&gt; did happen is not adequate to prove that nothing might have. That
&gt;&gt; uncertainty is the key to the safety decision to continue or not.

&gt;&gt; Cheers, Alan

&gt; It is common practice to use the T-Handle to shut down an engine having
&gt; problems. Pulling the T-Handle not only shuts down the engine in question
&gt; but also isolates it for all practical purposes. By isolating I mean
&gt; shutting off fuel flow, hydraulics, &amp; electrical to/from the engine.

&gt; A/C jet engines are designed so oil is constantly fed to the bearings when
&gt; the engine is wind milling, so the bearings will not seize causing the
&gt; engine to seize.

&gt; Once the engine was secured a visual inspection would tell if there were
&gt; residual problems such as damage from an uncontained failure if such
&gt; occurred or continuing fire. If there is no visual indication of
&gt; uncontained
&gt; failure or residual fire the only potential remaining problem is the
&gt; possibility of loss of engine oil allowing the engine to seize. If the
&gt; engine does seize, it is a relatively slow process. A engine seizing under
&gt; these circumstances only adds additional drag which can be easily
&gt; compensated for.

&gt; Once the engine is initially shut down, if there is no residual fire or
&gt; structural damage if shut down was necessitated by an uncontained failure.
&gt; the engine presents very little if any further hazard.

that and you're likely to cause a meltdown.

&gt;&gt; There's no way to conduct an inspection like that in the air.

&gt; Flames shooting out of the engine cowling, smoke, sparks,
&gt; nasty-looking little metal bits sticking out the sides, incorrect
&gt; temperatures at various stages in the engine, variations in fuel
&gt; flow figures, oil and hydraulic fluid pressures, etc., are all
&gt; somewhat relevant indicators that can be checked by the standard

&gt; I did post on the incident that causes me to feel this way; it was an
&gt; Alitalia 747 (I still remember the name on the nose - &quot;Carlo del
&gt; Prete&quot;) which had an emergency landing at Canberra in the late '70s.
&gt; The internal mag-alloy gearbox had ground to a powder, which, apart
&gt; from some faint smoke had no external indications. When the aircraft
&gt; stopped and the nacelle cowl was dropped, it erupted in whitish flames
&gt; and billowing smoke. The heat was incredibly intense, but it was
&gt; extinguished before it spread up to the wing (from memory, CO2 had no
&gt; effect, and in fact seemed to feed the fire, I think we had to use BCF
&gt; eventually in the panic).

&gt; So, all external appearances were OK, but in this case the pilots did
&gt; the right thing after shutting down the engine and landed. Later
&gt; investigation indicated that the fire would most likely have occurred
&gt; at some time in flight if the flight had continued. I am no expert on
&gt; engines, that was advice back through the reporting system to us.

&gt; From memory, the engine was Pratt and Whitney.

&gt; I have attempted to find a report on it, but it appears to be too old
&gt; or just wasn't listed. Somewhere I have some b&amp;w photos of it taken by
&gt; a RAAF photographer.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to land the plane immediately at the same airport from which it had

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; departed and LEAVE IT ON THE GROUND until the engine was repaired.

and to decide whether or not to proceed. What's been
nicely ignored throughout this discussion as well is the fact
that they DID have a &quot;journey across America&quot; (i.e., several
hours' worth of flight time, with a goodly number of possible
landing sites all along the route) to continue to monitor the
remaining engines, plus the failed one, to be that much more
assured that there was little chance of a problem in crossing
the Atlantic. Or were you thinking that the decision to fly
on, made near LAX, irrevocably committed the plane to
Heathrow with no other options?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Although he had calculated that the plane could safely make its
destination,
&gt; the plane encountered some unexpected headwind over the Atlantic Ocean,
which
&gt; depleted its fuel reserves further.

&gt; The pilot decided not to risk flying to Heathrow and made a mayday call
asking
&gt; to land at Manchester without wasting any more fuel by waiting in the

"/> skies.

Which is exactly what should have happened, in light of
this further development.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; How far is Manchester from Heathrow anyway?? If they couldn't make it
even
&gt; that little bit extra overthere, I'd say they &quot;fjucked&quot; up.

"/> About 160 miles - but the question is whether or not you
are assured of &quot;making it&quot; with safe/legal fuel reserves. If not,
they simply say, &quot;well, we gave it a good try&quot; and put down
at the alternate - exactly what happened.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Say I drive a car and I get a flat tyre and replace it with my (one)
spare. Or
&gt; I lose my left front light, or anything else relatively minor. Am I still
&gt; safe? Sure. Would I drive across a desert without getting repairs first?
No
&gt; way. And while being responsible for passengers? That's where it really
&gt; becomes a no-brainer.

"/> Assuming you had yet another spare tire or light bulb in the
car, though, changes that story, doesn't it? The 747 in question
was not in danger of falling out of the sky, even in the very
unlikely event that a second engine had been lost along the way
(esp. once it got to the east coast of the U.S., as it was at that
point down considerably from its takeoff weight). Had that
second engine in fact been lost, they then would no doubt have
immediately diverted to the nearest acceptable landing site, and
made a safe landing there.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Anyone who doesn't understand that should stick to flying himself in a
single
&gt; seater, or, preferably, Microsoft FS.

"/> And is said FS where you have all of your flight experience?

&quot;Injury Factsr compares four modes of transportation: scheduled airlines,
railroad passenger trains (including Amtrak and commutation), buses, and
passenger automobiles (excluding vans and pickup trucks). In general, buses,
trains, and airlines have much lower death rates than automobiles when the risk
is expressed as passenger deaths per passenger mile of travel. (Automobile
drivers are considered passengers but operators and crew of planes, trains,
and buses are not.) In 2000, the passenger death rate in automobiles was 0.80
per 100 million passenger-miles. The rates for buses, trains, and airlines were
0.05, 0.03, and 0.02, respectively.&quot;

&gt;&gt; The captain first noticed a problem an hour after take-off when engine
&gt; number
&gt;&gt; two on the port side of his aircraft experienced a power surge. The pilot
&gt;&gt; switched off the broken engine and continued his journey across America
&gt; with
&gt;&gt; the three remaining engines.

&gt; After circling a bit in the area of LAX to evaluate the problem
&gt; and to decide whether or not to proceed. What's been
&gt; nicely ignored throughout this discussion as well is the fact
&gt; that they DID have a &quot;journey across America&quot; (i.e., several
&gt; hours' worth of flight time, with a goodly number of possible
&gt; landing sites all along the route) to continue to monitor the
&gt; remaining engines, plus the failed one, to be that much more
&gt; assured that there was little chance of a problem in crossing
&gt; the Atlantic. Or were you thinking that the decision to fly
&gt; on, made near LAX, irrevocably committed the plane to
&gt; Heathrow with no other options?

&gt;&gt; Although he had calculated that the plane could safely make its
&gt; destination,
&gt;&gt; the plane encountered some unexpected headwind over the Atlantic Ocean,
&gt; which
&gt;&gt; depleted its fuel reserves further.

&gt;&gt; The pilot decided not to risk flying to Heathrow and made a mayday call
&gt; asking
&gt;&gt; to land at Manchester without wasting any more fuel by waiting in the
&gt; skies.

&gt; Which is exactly what should have happened, in light of
&gt; this further development.

&gt;&gt; How far is Manchester from Heathrow anyway?? If they couldn't make it
&gt; even
&gt;&gt; that little bit extra overthere, I'd say they &quot;fjucked&quot; up.

&gt; About 160 miles - but the question is whether or not you
&gt; are assured of &quot;making it&quot; with safe/legal fuel reserves. If not,
&gt; they simply say, &quot;well, we gave it a good try&quot; and put down
&gt; at the alternate - exactly what happened.

&gt;&gt; Say I drive a car and I get a flat tyre and replace it with my (one)
&gt; spare. Or
&gt;&gt; I lose my left front light, or anything else relatively minor. Am I still
&gt;&gt; safe? Sure. Would I drive across a desert without getting repairs first?
&gt; No
&gt;&gt; way. And while being responsible for passengers? That's where it really
&gt;&gt; becomes a no-brainer.

&gt; Assuming you had yet another spare tire or light bulb in the
&gt; car, though, changes that story, doesn't it? The 747 in question
&gt; was not in danger of falling out of the sky, even in the very
&gt; unlikely event that a second engine had been lost along the way
&gt; (esp. once it got to the east coast of the U.S., as it was at that
&gt; point down considerably from its takeoff weight). Had that
&gt; second engine in fact been lost, they then would no doubt have
&gt; immediately diverted to the nearest acceptable landing site, and
&gt; made a safe landing there.

&gt;&gt; Anyone who doesn't understand that should stick to flying himself in a
&gt; single
&gt;&gt; seater, or, preferably, Microsoft FS.

&gt; And is said FS where you have all of your flight experience?

&gt;&gt; By this argument, it is impossible for a failure to ever

&gt;&gt; who &quot;truly know&quot; their subject. Are you sure you want
&gt;&gt; to be saying that?

&gt; Yes.

&gt;&gt; Finally, something I can agree with, in part. Pilot error continues
&gt;&gt; to be the major cause of accidents, as far as I know, in essentially
&gt;&gt; every category of aircraft and operation (outside of the military,
&gt;&gt; where such factors as &quot;getting shot at&quot; also enter into the
&gt;&gt; picture). However, in saying that we have to also acknowledge
&gt;&gt; that the reason for this is not that pilot skill is on average
&gt;&gt; unacceptably bad, but rather that the mechanical reliability of the
&gt;&gt; aircraft they are now flying is amazingly good.

&gt; How do you know that it is the latter, and not the former?

&gt; Why are pilots less reliable than their aircraft?

&gt;&gt; Things just DO NOT
&gt;&gt; break all that often, or at least not in such a way that poses a clear
&gt;&gt; and immediate threat to the continued safety of the flight.

&gt; Yes, and that makes pilots complacent. Sure, one engine stops, but
&gt; engines hardly ever break down, so let's just keep flying.

&gt;&gt; In short,
&gt;&gt; it could be stated with a high degree of confidence that the aircraft,
&gt;&gt; when assumed to have four functional engines, had a 99.9999...whatever
&gt;&gt; percent chance of completing its flight without incident.

&gt;&quot;Whatever&quot;?

&gt;&gt; The loss of one engine, after takeoff, surely does reduce
&gt;&gt; that number ...

&gt; By how much? Weren't you asking for quantification a while ago?

"/> Let's say you have five different systems aboard, each of which can fail
in five different ways. That gives you 5^5 different possible failure
scenarios, or 3,125 scenarios that you must go through on a simulator.
If each one takes 15 minutes, that's 781 hours of simulator time to go
through them all.

In real life, it's more like 100 systems on board, each of which has
perhaps 30 different failure modes (and I'm being conservative here).
The total number of failure scenarios is now roughly 5 followed by 147
zeros. Even if we reduce this by a trillion trillion to allow for
correlations, there are still 123 zeros to go. In other words, there's
no hope of ever covering them all.

A simulator can only cover a microscopically-small fraction of all
possible failure scenarios. One must concentrate on those one believes
empirically to be the most likely. But new failure scenarios can be
encountered in real life without warning, and pilots will be completely
untrained for those.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Without knowing the exact cause, you cannot KNOW
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; whether or not the failure in question indicates that the rest of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the fleet is in immediate danger; the reasonable course of action,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; then, would be to immediately ground all 747s upon the engine
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; failure of this one, until we KNOW...right?

&gt;&gt;&gt; No. You ground the 747 with the problem and examine it as soon as
&gt;&gt;&gt; possible. You certainly do the fleet no favors by staying in the air.

&gt;&gt; You land &amp; examine/repair the A/C with a problem in a prudent manner.

&gt;&gt; You obviously are clueless re maint &amp; failure tracking protocols for A/C
&gt;&gt; components. Detailed records are kept fleet wide on component
wear/failure
&gt;&gt; based on a common denominator. Specified components are changed on a

&gt; A/C to a safe area and do a power run. And how would he
&gt; evaluate the success of his wrenching?
&gt; By observing the very same instruments that the the flight
&gt; crew watches all day!

&gt; Aah, for the good old days when the computers and the

&gt; that would give instructions for the required test or fix.
&gt; Finally you knew what needed to be repaired.
&gt; Now, instead of cross-referencing a bunch of codes
&gt; all you need to do is sit in the Captain's seat and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; However, the pilots in this case did not, independently,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; make the particular
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decision you mentioned.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Nobody else could really make that decision, either, without looking at
&gt;&gt;&gt; the plane.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; are operating procedures and guidelines, information and
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; recommendations provided by both the aircraft manufacturer
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and presumably the airline, which assisted in that decision.

&gt;&gt;&gt; And the guiding principle here was obviously &quot;go for the money.&quot;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The failed engine was already failed; it could not get worse,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; once it was confirmed to be safely shut down.

&gt;&gt;&gt; But another engine could fail.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The only
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; decision to be made then is with respect to the health of the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; other three engines, and that's exactly what a pilot IS charged
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; with monitoring throughout the flight anyway - so no additional
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; responsibility comes in there.

&gt;&gt;&gt; If the pilot were truly able to do that, he would have known that the
&gt;&gt;&gt; first engine was going to fail, and he never would have left the
&gt;&gt;&gt; airport.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Exactly how many hours of 747 time do YOU have, and/or when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did you get your A&amp;P ticket?

&gt;&gt;&gt; Time on a 747 wouldn't help me judge the status of an engine. That's a
&gt;&gt;&gt; different specialty.

&gt;&gt;Pilots are intimately familar with the performance criterion of engines
on
&gt;&gt;the A/C they fly. As an engine ages it's performance gradually decreases.
&gt;&gt;The condition of any given engine is readily obvious by

&gt; Not entirely true. An engine which has degraded to near the limtations can
&gt; appear normal on cockpit indications, while it may be a subject for
&gt; scheduled removal based on trend monitoring. Basically there are two
&gt; options for engine maintenance used in aviation nowadays (with subtle
&gt; variations or combinations of the two); on-condition with trend-monitoring
&gt; or borescope montitoring, and hard-time (or scheduled overhauls, or
&gt; sub-overhauls where different modules of the engine are overhauled
&gt; independently). The trend-monitoring programs used by most carriers today
&gt; would catch most &quot;gradual decreases in performance&quot; before they would be
&gt; apparent to the crew. This is especially true for FADEC-controlled engines
&gt; where indications are sometimes synthesized or conditioned to compensate
&gt; for other variables. ITT trimmers &amp; FADEC channel comparators, for
&gt; instance. These types of devices are generally geared toward producing a
&gt;&quot;married-up&quot; set of engine indications vs what might require hours of
&gt; tedious rigging on an older 'analog' multi-engine aircraft.

&gt; Trend-monitoring programs typically take many things into account before a
&gt; service action is recommended, such as rate of degradation (loss of
&gt; margin), the amount of margin initially avialble when new or overhauled,
&gt; etc. The margin refferred to could be one of several parameters, such as
&gt; N1, N2, ITT, oil pressure, etc. The method of colection these days is
&gt; generally all electronic, but older modern aircraft may require the crew
&gt; to fill out a trend data sheet on each flight (or first flight).

&gt; While what you state is basically true in the sense that cockpit
&gt; indications will show an acute problem with the engine, usually a gradual
&gt; decrease in performance is dealt with before it becomes an indication
&gt; limitations issue (or even noticaeble on the indications in most cases).
&gt; It's interesting to look at some of the trend plots and see how
&gt; predictable the normal life of an engine can be, or what a failed
&gt; component looks like in terms of engine performance (such as a CBV for
&gt; instance).

Windshear has always existed. It existed before it was discovered, but
pilots were not trained for it, because nobody knew of its existence.
No amount of simulator hardware can compensate for this. You cannot
train for situations of which you are unaware. And of those you can
conceive, by passing through all possible permutations, you can only
simulate a small fraction, due to time limitations. If you fail to
simulate a scenario that actually occurs at some point, that occurrence
may result in lives lost. There is no way around this.

&gt; No amount of simulator hardware can compensate for this. You cannot

&gt;&gt; I did post on the incident that causes me to feel this way; it was an
&gt;&gt; Alitalia 747 (I still remember the name on the nose - &quot;Carlo del
&gt;&gt; Prete&quot;) which had an emergency landing at Canberra in the late '70s.
&gt;&gt; The internal mag-alloy gearbox had ground to a powder, which, apart
&gt;&gt; from some faint smoke had no external indications. When the aircraft
&gt;&gt; stopped and the nacelle cowl was dropped, it erupted in whitish flames
&gt;&gt; and billowing smoke. The heat was incredibly intense, but it was
&gt;&gt; extinguished before it spread up to the wing (from memory, CO2 had no
&gt;&gt; effect, and in fact seemed to feed the fire, I think we had to use BCF
&gt;&gt; eventually in the panic).

&gt;&gt; So, all external appearances were OK, but in this case the pilots did
&gt;&gt; the right thing after shutting down the engine and landed. Later
&gt;&gt; investigation indicated that the fire would most likely have occurred
&gt;&gt; at some time in flight if the flight had continued. I am no expert on
&gt;&gt; engines, that was advice back through the reporting system to us.

&gt;&gt; From memory, the engine was Pratt and Whitney.

&gt;&gt; I have attempted to find a report on it, but it appears to be too old
&gt;&gt; or just wasn't listed. Somewhere I have some b&amp;w photos of it taken by
&gt;&gt; a RAAF photographer.

&gt; More likely that kind of fire would start on the ground than in the air at
&gt; 500kts+.

about the fuel used in making a couple of circles above LA? that fuel
alone could have made the difference for this flight.

&gt; Let's say you have five different systems aboard, each of which can fail

&gt; If each one takes 15 minutes, that's 781 hours of simulator time to go

&gt; In real life, it's more like 100 systems on board, each of which has
&gt; perhaps 30 different failure modes (and I'm being conservative here).
&gt; The total number of failure scenarios is now roughly 5 followed by 147
&gt; zeros. Even if we reduce this by a trillion trillion to allow for
&gt; correlations, there are still 123 zeros to go. In other words, there's
&gt; no hope of ever covering them all.

&gt; A simulator can only cover a microscopically-small fraction of all

&gt;&gt;&gt; did happen is not adequate to prove that nothing might have. That
&gt;&gt;&gt; uncertainty is the key to the safety decision to continue or not.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers, Alan

&gt;&gt; It is common practice to use the T-Handle to shut down an engine having
&gt;&gt; problems. Pulling the T-Handle not only shuts down the engine in
question
&gt;&gt; but also isolates it for all practical purposes. By isolating I mean
&gt;&gt; shutting off fuel flow, hydraulics, &amp; electrical to/from the engine.

&gt;&gt; A/C jet engines are designed so oil is constantly fed to the bearings
when
&gt;&gt; the engine is wind milling, so the bearings will not seize causing the
&gt;&gt; engine to seize.

&gt;&gt; Once the engine was secured a visual inspection would tell if there were
&gt;&gt; residual problems such as damage from an uncontained failure if such
&gt;&gt; occurred or continuing fire. If there is no visual indication of
&gt;&gt; uncontained
&gt;&gt; failure or residual fire the only potential remaining problem is the
&gt;&gt; possibility of loss of engine oil allowing the engine to seize. If the
&gt;&gt; engine does seize, it is a relatively slow process. A engine seizing
under
&gt;&gt; these circumstances only adds additional drag which can be easily
&gt;&gt; compensated for.

&gt;&gt; Once the engine is initially shut down, if there is no residual fire or
&gt;&gt; structural damage if shut down was necessitated by an uncontained
failure.
&gt;&gt; the engine presents very little if any further hazard.

&gt; Now, now Ralph. You go feedfing these idiots with actual information like
&gt; that and you're likely to cause a meltdown.

&gt; It has nothing to do with psychic powers. It's simple arithmetic and

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; EVERY SINGLE windshear accident is a simulator scenario.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How often were windshear scenarios simulated before windshear was
&gt;&gt;&gt; discovered?

&gt;&gt; Igit

&gt; You haven't answered my question. How often were windshear scenarios
&gt; simulated before windshear was discovered?

&gt; Windshear has always existed. It existed before it was discovered, but
&gt; pilots were not trained for it, because nobody knew of its existence.
&gt; No amount of simulator hardware can compensate for this. You cannot
&gt; train for situations of which you are unaware. And of those you can
&gt; conceive, by passing through all possible permutations, you can only
&gt; simulate a small fraction, due to time limitations. If you fail to
&gt; simulate a scenario that actually occurs at some point, that occurrence
&gt; may result in lives lost. There is no way around this.

"/> OK, math aside. Do you think that a pilot fresh out of the sim can only
react correctly to the incidents he just practised? or dya think he might
just be up to speed enough to figger out what combination of shit just
happened.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I did post on the incident that causes me to feel this way; it was an
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Alitalia 747 (I still remember the name on the nose - &quot;Carlo del
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Prete&quot;) which had an emergency landing at Canberra in the late '70s.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The internal mag-alloy gearbox had ground to a powder, which, apart
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; from some faint smoke had no external indications. When the aircraft
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; stopped and the nacelle cowl was dropped, it erupted in whitish
flames
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and billowing smoke. The heat was incredibly intense, but it was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; extinguished before it spread up to the wing (from memory, CO2 had no
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; effect, and in fact seemed to feed the fire, I think we had to use
BCF
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; eventually in the panic).

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So, all external appearances were OK, but in this case the pilots did
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the right thing after shutting down the engine and landed. Later
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; investigation indicated that the fire would most likely have occurred
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; at some time in flight if the flight had continued. I am no expert on
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; engines, that was advice back through the reporting system to us.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; From memory, the engine was Pratt and Whitney.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have attempted to find a report on it, but it appears to be too old
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or just wasn't listed. Somewhere I have some b&amp;w photos of it taken
by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; a RAAF photographer.

&gt;&gt;&gt; More likely that kind of fire would start on the ground than in the air
&gt;&gt;&gt; at
&gt;&gt;&gt; 500kts+.
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'll bow to Ralph's better knowledge if he has input.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Limey.

&gt;&gt; You are correct. Jet engines are air cooled. For mag to ignite requires
a
&gt;&gt; temp of &gt;1,900 degrees F. It is not likely this temp will be achieved in
&gt;&gt; the
&gt;&gt; air stream. When you stop is when the temp can reach mag ignition temps.

&gt; Well, there's a surprise. Alan is wrong again.

&gt; Limey.

"/> IRC Alan posted something to the effect of the fire flaring up once the A/C
was on the ground &amp; the cowling was opened. This would be possible but
highly unlikely.

Mag is a relatively soft metal. Most gears are made of some type of steel or
titanium. Titanium will also burn starting around 2,500 degrees F. In most
instances fires involving titanium are secondary to another fire.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, as my grade-school teachers of &quot;simple arithmetic&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used to say, please show your work. Otherwise, it's just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet Another unsupported claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's say you have five different systems aboard, each of which can
fail
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in five different ways. That gives you 5^5 different possible
failure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scenarios, or 3,125 scenarios that you must go through on a
simulator.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If each one takes 15 minutes, that's 781 hours of simulator time to
go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through them all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In real life, it's more like 100 systems on board, each of which has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps 30 different failure modes (and I'm being conservative
here).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The total number of failure scenarios is now roughly 5 followed by
147
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; zeros. Even if we reduce this by a trillion trillion to allow for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlations, there are still 123 zeros to go. In other words,
there's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no hope of ever covering them all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A simulator can only cover a microscopically-small fraction of all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible failure scenarios. One must concentrate on those one
believes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; empirically to be the most likely.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Flameout, fire, rollback.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But new failure scenarios can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; encountered in real life without warning, and pilots will be
completely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; untrained for those.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We train for everything. Instructors stay nights thinking of shit
that
&gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt;&gt; happen. I give a fwd cargo door opening after takeoff, FOD's out the
&gt;&gt; right
&gt;&gt;&gt; engine, takes out the right slat, jams the stab. Why, because it
happened
&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; United over the Pacific.

&gt;&gt; Reality tends to make scenarios dreamed up by the sim people seem
mundane.

&gt;&gt; We had a Southern Airways DC 9 land on a Hy 7 miles short after both
engines
&gt;&gt; flamed out due injesting hail &amp; rain in a T'Storm. Just to make the Hy
&gt;&gt; landing interesting the hail took out the wind shields.

&gt;&gt; Try putting an A/C down on a Hy dead stick with the wind shields broken
out.

To add to the shock factor, upon arriving on scene 2 school bus were

Dealing with a major A/C incident is one thing, dealing with collateral

My response was only trying to point out that following the original
flight plan and allowing for mo change in operational conditions, Yes
the aircraft would have flown to Heathrow; however, you ignore in your
question the fact that many things have changed as a result of actions
following the engine failure. Those factors resulted in shortened
flight, but there were more variables than just the lack of one engine.

You also seem to think that there is usually a lot of fuel left over
after a transatlantic flight. I have been on board when it was announced
that if we are unable to land in the fog we will have to continue to
Frankfurt (instead of Paris) as there would be insufficient fuel to
safely try a second approach. Note that insufficient fuel includes
reserves for safety. The BA flight to Manchester according to the
stories I have read in the news reports did have reserves but felt
prudent to land early and called the emergency in order to get priority
at the airport.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; |the failed engine was not going to get any worse,

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; How on earth did they know that?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; That is the crux of the matter. There was no way to tell what was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; going on inside there while it still windmilled. The fact that nothing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; did happen is not adequate to prove that nothing might have. That
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; uncertainty is the key to the safety decision to continue or not.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Cheers, Alan

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is common practice to use the T-Handle to shut down an engine having
&gt;&gt;&gt; problems. Pulling the T-Handle not only shuts down the engine in
&gt; question
&gt;&gt;&gt; but also isolates it for all practical purposes. By isolating I mean
&gt;&gt;&gt; shutting off fuel flow, hydraulics, &amp; electrical to/from the engine.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A/C jet engines are designed so oil is constantly fed to the bearings
&gt; when
&gt;&gt;&gt; the engine is wind milling, so the bearings will not seize causing the
&gt;&gt;&gt; engine to seize.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Once the engine was secured a visual inspection would tell if there
&gt;&gt;&gt; were
&gt;&gt;&gt; residual problems such as damage from an uncontained failure if such
&gt;&gt;&gt; occurred or continuing fire. If there is no visual indication of
&gt;&gt;&gt; uncontained
&gt;&gt;&gt; failure or residual fire the only potential remaining problem is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; possibility of loss of engine oil allowing the engine to seize. If the
&gt;&gt;&gt; engine does seize, it is a relatively slow process. A engine seizing
&gt; under
&gt;&gt;&gt; these circumstances only adds additional drag which can be easily
&gt;&gt;&gt; compensated for.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Once the engine is initially shut down, if there is no residual fire or
&gt;&gt;&gt; structural damage if shut down was necessitated by an uncontained
&gt; failure.
&gt;&gt;&gt; the engine presents very little if any further hazard.

&gt;&gt; Now, now Ralph. You go feedfing these idiots with actual information like
&gt;&gt; that and you're likely to cause a meltdown.

&gt;&gt; Limey.

&gt; Well Boo Hoo. If they can't deal with reality that's tough. Besides how

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet Another unsupported claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's say you have five different systems aboard, each of which can
&gt; fail
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in five different ways. That gives you 5^5 different possible
&gt; failure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scenarios, or 3,125 scenarios that you must go through on a
&gt; simulator.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If each one takes 15 minutes, that's 781 hours of simulator time to
&gt; go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through them all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In real life, it's more like 100 systems on board, each of which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps 30 different failure modes (and I'm being conservative
&gt; here).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The total number of failure scenarios is now roughly 5 followed by
&gt; 147
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; zeros. Even if we reduce this by a trillion trillion to allow for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlations, there are still 123 zeros to go. In other words,
&gt; there's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no hope of ever covering them all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A simulator can only cover a microscopically-small fraction of all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible failure scenarios. One must concentrate on those one
&gt; believes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; empirically to be the most likely.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Flameout, fire, rollback.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But new failure scenarios can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; encountered in real life without warning, and pilots will be
&gt; completely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; untrained for those.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We train for everything. Instructors stay nights thinking of shit
&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen. I give a fwd cargo door opening after takeoff, FOD's out the
&gt;&gt;&gt; right
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; engine, takes out the right slat, jams the stab. Why, because it
&gt; happened
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; United over the Pacific.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Reality tends to make scenarios dreamed up by the sim people seem
&gt; mundane.

&gt;&gt;&gt; We had a Southern Airways DC 9 land on a Hy 7 miles short after both
&gt; engines
&gt;&gt;&gt; flamed out due injesting hail &amp; rain in a T'Storm. Just to make the Hy
&gt;&gt;&gt; landing interesting the hail took out the wind shields.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Try putting an A/C down on a Hy dead stick with the wind shields broken

30+ million, Level D sim(wrap-around visuals) about $45M.. That's JUST the

for computer to run the hydraulics and graphics. Once the initial purchase and
setup is done, costs drop as the only thing required is board, servo, or hyd.
jack replacement.

737/757/767 a/c cost, $40-80M per(depending on config). Ongoing costs? Fuel,
maint, parts. No one does real a/c training anymore UNLESS the pilot has NEVER
flown a turbine-powered a/c before. In that case, after the checkride, the
pilot MUST do three takeoff and landings with no passengers in the actual a/c.
Most pilots can do ALL their training in the Sim and the first real flight is an
a/c full of passengers.

But then, you're a mo-ron so you'd never know this, nor be expected to remember
any of it.

&gt;&gt;&gt; How far is Manchester from Heathrow anyway?? If they couldn't make
&gt;&gt;&gt; it even
&gt;&gt;&gt; that little bit extra overthere, I'd say they &quot;fjucked&quot; up.

&gt; The pilot made an emergency landing in Manchester, England, about 160
&gt; miles short of London, because the Boeing 747 ran low on fuel after
&gt; facing headwinds that were stronger than expected, the Federal
&gt; Aviation Administration said.

"/> Actually, that wouldn't be an emergency landing, Ralph. He just landed
there because fuel woudl have been tighter than he would have liked getting
to LHR. At least that;s how it appears.

&gt; What? between a sim and a/c? A Level C sim(4 TV's in the windows)
&gt; starts at 30+ million, Level D sim(wrap-around visuals) about $45M..
&gt; That's JUST the box(cockpit). Add in another 3-10M for 6point axis
&gt; and another ...oooh... 5M for computer to run the hydraulics and
&gt; graphics. Once the initial purchase and setup is done, costs drop as
&gt; the only thing required is board, servo, or hyd. jack replacement.

&gt; 737/757/767 a/c cost, $40-80M per(depending on config). Ongoing
&gt; costs? Fuel, maint, parts. No one does real a/c training anymore
&gt; UNLESS the pilot has NEVER flown a turbine-powered a/c before.

"/> Ahem. We do. I had to do a couple of cruch 'n goes in the 757 before OJT

I still haven't done a zero time conversion yet.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; In real life, it's more like 100 systems on board, each of which has
&gt; perhaps 30 different failure modes (and I'm being conservative here).
&gt; The total number of failure scenarios is now roughly 5 followed by 147
&gt; zeros. Even if we reduce this by a trillion trillion to allow for
&gt; correlations, there are still 123 zeros to go. In other words, there's
&gt; no hope of ever covering them all.

"/> As I suspected, an overly-simplistic analysis. This resembles the
sort of lunacy that creationists use to &quot;disprove&quot; evolution on the
grounds of statistical improbability.

The flaw with the analysis, of course, is that from the standpoint
of scenarios which require simulation, not all of the systems nor
all of their failure modes are independent. If a given failure mode
results in a virtually identical problem (in terms of what the pilot
is required to do in response) as another, then it is of no practical
difference in terms of training. Were this not so, then we would
expect that each and every thing that EVER goes wrong with any
complex system (including aircraft) would be completely new and
unknown territory. This is clearly not the case. You do not
care if system X failed for this reason vs. that, unless they require
distinctly different responses. In fact, per an analysis like yours,
it is impossible to train anyone to do anything, since the realm of
possible circumstances is always essentially &quot;infinitely&quot; larger than
the set of learnable responses.

To put it in other terms, there are no doubt many different things
that could go wrong to stop fuel from reaching the engines.
Some of these are so incredibly unlikely as to be safely
ignorable; they simply are not going to happen within the
life of the aircraft or the pilot. Others may differ in terms of
what actually goes wrong, but result in the same effect - a
simple stoppage of fuel, with no other secondary effects. In
this manner, your trillions upon trillions of scenarious gets
rapidly reduced to a few &quot;buckets&quot; of like problems.

Hell, if this were not so, the aircraft could not possibly be
designed in the first place, since it would be impossible to
adequately examine all of the possible variables that would
go into the design. And this clearly is not true either.
The wonderful thing about mathematical hand-waving is how
quickly it falls apart in the face of a contradictory reality.

&gt;&gt; I disagree. Windshears are foreseeable circumstances when T'Storms are
in
&gt;&gt; the area. Whether an A/C can survive a windshear encounter is a matter
of
&gt;&gt; speed, altitude, &amp; A/C configuration at the time of encounter.

&gt; Ralph, you don't really think our Mr. Manic knows what
&gt;&quot;windshear&quot; IS, do you? It's just another word he's picked
&gt; up on somewhere as a Bad Thing.

If you look at accident reports, you'll see that a great many accidents
involve incidents that are never simulated (or at least never were until

permutation of circumstances, and the likelihood of these circumstances
having been covered in a simulator is very small (which is one reason

The total number of possible scenarios is very large--so large, in fact,
that it is impossible to ever simulate any significant fraction of them.
In practice, then, the scenarios simulated are those that are known from
experience, or those that seem obvious and worthy of simulation. All
the rest remain unsimulated, and accidents tend to occur among these
unsimulated scenarios. There's no way to change this. A pilot can only
hope that, if something happens, it will be something for which he has
already trained, or something sufficiently close to a scenario that he
has already covered that he'll be able to adapt and make correct choices
in the heat of the moment.

equates to saying that the set of all possible scenarios or emergencies

technically correct from a purely mathematical basis, but which is
of no practical consequence whatsoever.

But if the argument IS both correct and meaningful in a practical

you can't possibly train for even a small fraction of those situations
you will encounter. Since practical experience says that training is
most definitely NOT a waste of time, the argument must be flawed.

It does _not_ prevent accidents in many other scenarios (unless they are

scenarios are so common and well understood that it makes sense to train

Nevertheless, training for these scenarios helps guarantee that real

The problem is that there is no way of assessing the likelihood of the

The fact that a given scenario has not occurred or has not been imagined
does not guarantee that it is unlikely, and the fact that it _has_
occurred does not guarantee that it is likely (although it does
establish that its probability is greater than zero). It is
statistically probable that real-world scenarios will mostly be likely
scenarios, but that is not guaranteed. Accidents happen when a scenario

life.

the basis of this belief is putting himself and his passengers at risk.

unfamiliar situation arises.

those for which the pilots are or could be trained.

Please make up your mind.

Further, in now introducing the new weasel-phrase
&quot;exactly matched training scenarios,&quot; you imply that the only
successful training scenarios ARE those which EXACTLY match
what is later encountered in the &quot;real world&quot; - that in effect, the
pilot's ability to creatively think and to apply past experience

&gt; Correct.

&gt; The problem is that there is no way of assessing the likelihood of the
&gt; untrained-for scenarios.

"/> And therefore, one is perfectly well justified in assuming that
the likelihood of the untrained-for, &quot;infinitely large&quot; pool of
such scenarios is at least as great as those you can train for.
Hence, you again effectively argue that meaningful traing, to
any real degree of confidence, is simply not possible.

However, I propose that the above assertion is wrong; in the
vast majority of examples of the &quot;untrained-for&quot; scenarios,
their likelihood CAN be assessed, and in fact has been and has
been judged to be extremely low (so low as to be safely ignorable)
by those who are intimately familiar with the aircraft, its systems,
and the flight environment. Either that, or the scenario is
question is one which is not survivable through any action that
can be trained.

An example of the former: no one trains for an attack by telepathic
ETs who take over the minds of the flight crew (but can do so
only to one member only, leaving the other pilot free to take
action). This scenario is possible, at least until you can conclusively
rule out the existence of such beings, but I believe could safely be
judged to be of inconsequential likelihood. For the latter: no one
trains for the event of both wings simultaneously coming off
the aircraft; that event is also POSSIBLE, but there's no sense
training for it (other than, perhaps, to review those steps you
might be able to take in order to leave a nicer-looking
corpse).

"/> Of course; but only very, very infrequently, and this is
by no means unique to aviation. Unless the above observation
can result in some meaningful change to training practices, it
is in any practical sense useless and irrelevant. You simply are
pointing out the way the universe works, and can rightly expect
to receive a response along the lines of &quot;well, DUH...&quot;

level of confidence (and therefore one done in the timely manner,
without a lot of unnecessary fretting about &quot;what to do? what
to do?&quot; that characterizes the novice, is ALWAYS preferable
to the alternative, unless the unconfident newbie gets very, very
lucky.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well, as my grade-school teachers of &quot;simple arithmetic&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; used to say, please show your work. Otherwise, it's just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yet Another unsupported claim.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Let's say you have five different systems aboard, each of which
&gt; can
&gt;&gt;&gt; fail
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in five different ways. That gives you 5^5 different possible
&gt;&gt;&gt; failure
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scenarios, or 3,125 scenarios that you must go through on a
&gt;&gt;&gt; simulator.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If each one takes 15 minutes, that's 781 hours of simulator time
&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; through them all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In real life, it's more like 100 systems on board, each of which
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; has
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; perhaps 30 different failure modes (and I'm being conservative
&gt;&gt;&gt; here).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The total number of failure scenarios is now roughly 5 followed
&gt; by
&gt;&gt;&gt; 147
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; zeros. Even if we reduce this by a trillion trillion to allow
&gt; for
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; correlations, there are still 123 zeros to go. In other words,
&gt;&gt;&gt; there's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; no hope of ever covering them all.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A simulator can only cover a microscopically-small fraction of
&gt; all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possible failure scenarios. One must concentrate on those one
&gt;&gt;&gt; believes
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; empirically to be the most likely.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Flameout, fire, rollback.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But new failure scenarios can be
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; encountered in real life without warning, and pilots will be
&gt;&gt;&gt; completely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; untrained for those.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We train for everything. Instructors stay nights thinking of shit
&gt;&gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; happen. I give a fwd cargo door opening after takeoff, FOD's out
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; right
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; engine, takes out the right slat, jams the stab. Why, because it
&gt;&gt;&gt; happened
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; United over the Pacific.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Reality tends to make scenarios dreamed up by the sim people seem
&gt;&gt;&gt; mundane.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; We had a Southern Airways DC 9 land on a Hy 7 miles short after both
&gt;&gt;&gt; engines
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; flamed out due injesting hail &amp; rain in a T'Storm. Just to make the
&gt; Hy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; landing interesting the hail took out the wind shields.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Try putting an A/C down on a Hy dead stick with the wind shields
&gt; broken
&gt;&gt;&gt; out.

&gt;&gt;&gt; A bad day at the office for the crew much less our group.

&gt;&gt;&gt; To add to the shock factor, upon arriving on scene 2 school bus were
&gt;&gt;&gt; involved. Thankfully they were empty. The drivers had parked them near
&gt; the
&gt;&gt;&gt; road in the store parking lot while they were in the store prior to
&gt; going
&gt;&gt;&gt; to
&gt;&gt;&gt; load for their afternoon runs.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Dealing with a major A/C incident is one thing, dealing with collateral
&gt;&gt;&gt; damage on the ground is another, school buses being involved in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; collateral damage is mind boggling upon first sight.

&gt;&gt; Is that the one where they were on a ridge, on the way in?

&gt;&gt; Limey.

&gt; Yes. The A/C put down on a Hy at a country cross roads store. The cross
&gt; road
&gt; runs along the ridge.

&gt; Doubt they would have made the field. The cross roads is 7 miles from the
&gt; field. There is a ~ 700' elevation difference from the ridge to the field.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What about the things that haven't happened yet?

&gt;&gt; Right, Bill. Don't forget that THAT incident with
&gt;&gt; United happened because rivet #6,427 came out
&gt;&gt; from the starboard inboard Jeffries tube dump valve
&gt;&gt; prozapulator vane; had it been rivet 6,428, instead,
&gt;&gt; why, clearly, that would be completely DIFFERENT...

&gt; That reminds me of when Splappy was making claims about a specific

manufacturers, operators, and regulators have extensive data on the
historical probability of various single point failures; the
combinations of single point failures used in simulator training are
based on that data so that the more significant combinations are more
likely to be used in training. The only assumption is that future
probability of such failures can be predicted from the historical data
base, but the combinatorial statistics are sound. The assumption is
not that the number of &quot;unsimulated&quot; scenarios is small; it is that
their collective probability is small. I suspect that the reason some
posters may have given less than satisfactory answers is that it's a
bit hard to summarize an entire professional discipline in a Usenet
post.

These data are also used to develop regulations, which is why flying a
747 on 3 out of 4 engines from LAX to England is permitted whereas the
same flight in a 767 on 1 out of 2 engines would be prohibited under
the regulations, as several posters have already noted. To those aware
of the regulations and the basis behind them, the hundreds of posts
arguing that the pilots should be fired, etc., are arguments from
ignorance.

There is no reason for a lay person _not_ to question the professional
pilots about this. However, when all the pilots are explaining that
the lay perception is wrong regarding a question of aviation safety,
perhaps a bit of humility might be in order; the pilots might know
something that the lay person does not.

I originally wrote:
&gt;&gt; There is no reason for a lay person _not_ to question the professional
&gt;&gt; pilots about this. However, when all the pilots are explaining that
&gt;&gt; the lay perception is wrong regarding a question of aviation safety,
&gt;&gt; perhaps a bit of humility might be in order; the pilots might know
&gt;&gt; something that the lay person does not.
&gt;Those who know will explain what they know.

"/> I would agree (I'm an ex-academic, so that's certainly my
inclination), but with the caveat that this is an unrealistic
expectation when applied to Usenet. I'm perfectly willing to civilly
explain a point to the first or second or even the third Usenet poster
who is ignorant about a particular point in my field. Unfortunately,
by the time the tenth or twentieth poster appears making the same
ignorant assertion, maintaining such civility is difficult in the
extreme. This thread is a superb example of the phenomenon; there have
been numerous posters who have joined in to condemn the stupid venal
cowboy BA pilots who conducted the LAX-MAN flight with an engine out,
citing the grave danger of the flight, not realizing that aviation
professionals have thought through the relative risks of such flights
and concluded that the risk was not significant. They also ignore that
safety regulations were enacted reflecting those considerations, and
that, as far as is publicly known, the BA pilots followed both
standard procedures and the applicable safety regulations. Even
knowledgable posters who may have initially cited chapter and verse of
the regulation the first time they responded will be sorely tempted to
reply &quot;Idiot&quot; by now; that's just human nature.

&gt; Those who don't will rant
&gt;and rave like teenage boys, but will not persuade.

"/> I agree that such responses don't persuade, but neither do they
validate the assertions of their opponents. The argument that &quot;if all
you can do is rant and rave I must be correct&quot; is equally
unpersuasive.
