Crispy Scallion-Potato Pancakes

Serve these as an appetizer: Make silver dollar-sized pancakes by using a
teaspoon, and then top them with a dab of creme fraîche and your favorite
caviar or smoked salmon. Or, top with dollops of salsa and sour cream.  Or
serve alongside scrambled eggs or your favorite omelet.

1 onion
2 large eggs
4 potatoes, peeled and shredded
1 or 2 yams, peeled and shredded
salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
2 tablespoons flour
oil for frying
sour cream or creme fraiche for serving

In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs together until smooth and fluffy.  Grate
potatoes, yam and onion. Squeeze as much liquid as possible from the
mixture.  Combine the mixture with beaten eggs; add flour, salt and
pepper. Divide into four equal parts.  In a large non-stick skillet, heat
oil over medium-high heat. Pour 1 tablespoon batter into the skillet to
test the oil. If it is hot enough, the pancake will begin to sizzle and
brown. Spoon the batter into the skillet, about 1 or 2 tablespoon per
pancake, leaving a little room between each one.  Flatten them with the
back of a spoon and use the spatula to round the sides, if necessary. Fry
the pancakes for 2 to 3 minutes, or until they are golden brown on the
bottom, then turn them and brown the other side, about 2 more minutes.
