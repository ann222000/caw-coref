I could use some input on this subject. A while ago I used infared
led's hooked up to a 555 to flash at a certain speed, I can't remember
what speed it was but I then had some special little divice that when
it saw an infared flashing at one specific givin speed it would either
close a switch completing the circuit, I can't quite remember how I
wired it but any way I'd like to do the same with a radio. What I want
it to do is turn on and led first than move on to turning on ovens,
unlocking cars etc...
I have a good idea how to do it, just take a transmiter and pulse it
at a certain speed with a 555 but how do I get my reciever to only
regonize that certain speed, a filter, a tone detector? I could really
use some input or websites to look at.

Make it up from scratch again, just like you did the first time, as you
seem to indicate[1]; and this time, if you're too drunk or zoned to
remember, take notes. For that matter, take notes anyway.

And always remember the first tenet of "State-Dependent Learning":
"If you can't learn it while you're high, you can't learn it."

And, just because I'm feeling frisky at this moment in spacetime, I
feel like ripping off one of Uncle Jimbo's lines: "Kids, there's a
time and a place for everything, and that's College!"

Have Fun!

Only problem is that the I don't know what was causing the device to
only respond to a certaing rate of speed from the flashing led. It was
all pre manufactured into a little sugur cube sized box.
