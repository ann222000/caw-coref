The Bush propagandists are hard at work trying to draw a
comparison between Nazi Germany and Iran.

There are a few major problems with their fairy tale.

For example:

1. Modern Iran has no history of military aggression

Fact: Iran has never invaded or attacked another country
in the Middle East or elsewhere.

In contrast, the US has savaged Iraq causing the death
of over 600,000 civilians since 2003 alone.

In the summer of 2006, Israel bombarded Lebanon in a
&quot;search for terrorists&quot; killing over 1,000 civilians and causing
billions of dollars in damage to the country's infrastructure
(airport, ports, roadways, housing, and factories.)

In 1980, the US encouraged its ally Saddam Hussein
to attack Iran and he did with terrible consequences
for the Iranian people.

2. Who has nukes?

Facts:

a. Iran has no nuclear weapons
b. Iran lacks the ability to create nuclear weapons
c. Iran is permitted by international treaty to develop
a nuclear energy program.

In contrast, the US has the largest nuclear weapons stockpile
on earth and has stated, under the Bush administration,
its &quot;right&quot; to use them &quot;pre-emptively&quot; at President
Bush's discretion.  The US continues to develop new
and &quot;improved&quot; nuclear weapons.

Israel has a well developed nuclear weapons program
and is the only nuclear power in the Middle East.

3. The US attacked Iran in the 1980s using Iraq as a surrogate

Saddam Hussein, who was put in power by the US, was supported
in his invasion of Iran with billions of dollars in US weapons
shipped to him by Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr. and coordinated
by people including Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney.

Over 300,000 Iranians were killed in this US-funded war and
over 500,000 were wounded.

It was during the US supported-Iraq attack on Iran that the
US transferred chemical and biological weapons technology
to Iraq.  There is evidence that the Bush family commercially
profited from these arms exports.

4. The US installed and maintained a tyranny in Iran
that operated from 1953 to 1979.

In 1953, the US and CIA with help from the UK engineered a violent
overthrow  of the country's democratically elected government and
then supported  a brutal, anti-democratic dictator in Iran  - the
so called &quot;Shah of Iran&quot; - who jailed thousands of dissidents and
engaged in vicious torture.

*** Military considerations

1. Iran is the 18th largest country in the world by size - the area
of the UK, France and German combined.

2. Iran has over 70 million people - three times the population of
Iraq

3. The Iranian military

Unlike Iraq, which lost a war with the US in 1990 and was
militarily attacked non-stop up to the US invasion in 2003,
Iran has had approximately 20 uninterrupted years to
build and refine it defense capacity

4.  Iranians are as patriotic about their country as
Americans are about theirs and will stand and fight
as they proved when attacked by Iraq in 1980.

When fighting Iraq, Iran used every human and
material recourse it had including &quot;human waves&quot;
of poorly armed and equipped suicide troops
who overcame the Iraqis with their sheer numbers.

We have 160,000 troops in the region. The Iranians
have 70,000,000 people and they will be fighting
on their home turf for their homeland.

5. Invaders are always at a disadvantage no
matter how technologically advanced.

Invaders who have a supply line many thousands of
miles long are at an extreme disadvantage.

6. Iranian tactics and operations are up-to-date
and formidable.

Iranian-trained militias in Lebanon were able
to counter an all out attack on Lebanon by the
US-equipped Israel army and air force and compel
the Israelis to retreat and agree to a cease-fire.

7. Potential Iranian responses to a US attack

Iran in a counterattack has the option of:

a. closing the Straits of Hormuz (through which over 20%
of the world's oil passes),
b. attacking Israel, and/or
c. attacking US military installations in Iraq

None of these operations would be difficult or expensive to
carry out.

However, the financial and human consequences could
be extreme.

Oil, already at $80 a barrel could, according to Wall Street
analysts, hit $200 per barrel - or more - with a doubling of
current gasoline prices.

Thousands of civilians and military personnel could be
killed and wounded in a matter of days.

*** Is war with Iran possible?

Yes.

1. Bush has the legal authority

Bush secured the legal authority to attack any country
any time for any reason post 9/11 and pre-Iraq invasion.
Congress has never taken this power back from him.
They need to do it. NOW.

2.  The troops, weapons and plans needed are already in place

The so called &quot;surge&quot; has put many extra thousands
of US troops and equipment into the region.  (For the
geographically challenged Iran is right next to Iraq.)

3.  The propaganda war has already started

A very well funded and well organized propaganda
operation - Freedom's Watch -  staffed by former
Bush administration officials has set up in Washington DC
with a multi-million dollar budget to &quot;sell&quot; war with
Iran to the American people.

Sadly, they are doing an excellent job and few
Americans are aware of how they are being conned
(again.)

*** Who benefits from attacking Iran?

The people who will benefit from an attack on Iran
are very same people who benefited - and continue
to benefit - from the invasion of Iraq:

1. Oil companies - the price of their product will
skyrocket

2. Weapons makers - including the Carlyle Group,
which the Bush family owns a major stake in.

3. Virulent Anti-Muslim and Arab zealots in Israel and elsewhere
- and the idiots in America who support them

4. Insiders with the financial resources place &quot;bets&quot; on the
war: buy gold, buy oil, short the US dollar etc.

5. Anti-democratic forces in the United States

About this last point...

Starting with the Reagan administration and continuing
unabated through the Clinton administration and
accelerating after 9/11, the executive branch of the United
States government has methodically been:

1. Destroying traditional rights and protections guaranteed
to US citizens by the Constitution

2. Creating a police state apparatus designed to silence
and suppress dissent with maximum force.

Simply by declaring you an &quot;enemy combatant&quot; or
someone who &quot;supports&quot; a declared enemy, you can be
arrested and held without charge indefinitely and without
the right to counsel.

This means that should the Bush administration engage
in a war of naked aggression against Iran openly killing
thousands of innocent Iranian civilians with bombardment,
including nuclear attacks, the very act of speaking out about
the immorality of such an attack could land you in jail
for the rest of your life or until such time the President
of the United States decides to release you.

Does this sound improbable?

It's not.

Imagine this possible scenario.

The US attacks Iran.

Iran counterattacks hitting Israel and US troops
in Iraq.

Underestimating the capacity of the Iranians to
defend themselves, the US finds its troops pinned
down in Iraq by a military that is capable of killing
them by the thousands.

What would the US do if, in yet another Bush
blunder, Bush put thousands of US troops at
the immediate risk of being killed?

How would the average uneducated American,
coming late to the story, react to the news that
hundreds of US servicemen and women were
being killed daily?

Would this give Bush the green light for what
his administration has been creating the
military doctrine for: a unilateral, first strike
nuclear attack?

You bet it would and in the perverse world of
the Bush family and its allies, it's possible they
may welcome the chance to finally let that
particular genie out of the bottle.

Bottom line:

Once a military attack against Iran gets started,
there is no imaginable positive outcome and potential
negative outcomes are worse than anything any
of us have seen in our lifetime.

For example:

* The reputation and moral standing of the US, which has
already been smeared by the blatant criminality of the Bush
administration, will be ruined, perhaps beyond repair

* Thousands of civilians and troops - perhaps tens
or even hundred of thousands - could be killed or
wounded. There could be casualties in ONE DAY that
dwarf all the casualties in Iraq since the invasion.

* The world economy will be thrown into a tailspin
and the US economy, the world's most dependent
on oil, will be hit especially hard.

* Underlying financial instability caused by a culture
of corruption and fraud (Enron, WorldCom, sub-prime
mortgages etc.) will be further strained perhaps
to the breaking point.

* China and Russian, two very formidable potential
enemies with human, natural and technological
resources equivalent to the US, may decide (if
they already haven't) that they need to join forces
to &quot;check&quot; US power and may begin to do so in
an aggressive way.

Again, this is all great news for the oil companies,
the weapons makers, the anti-Muslim and Arab zealots,
the opponents of civil rights and the Constitution.
and plugged in Wall Street operators.

It will be a disaster for American citizens.

Disasters for average Americans is what the Bush family
has been about for four generations now:

1. The great grandfather *Samuel Bush* was Woodrow Wilson's
liaison to the weapon's industry and profited mightily in that
role. He was one of a handful of architects &quot;present at creation&quot;
of the modern military-industrial complex which has
steadily bled the US financially and morally for private
profit for decades.

2. The grandfather *Prescott Bush* was US banker to the
Nazis, helping them before, during, and after World
War II with their financial operations.

3. Bush Sr.  was behind the Iran-Contra operation
which illegally sent arms to Iran and siphoned
the profits for personal gain and to fund terrorist
operations in Central America.  He also worked
with the Bin Laden family and others to fund the
so called Afghani resistance which

Easy solution. Give U.S. regime the &quot;world rights&quot; to hydrogen..:-), and let
then spend their war chest on pefecting hydrogen cells, and the associated
chemistry.

Only leaves one problem. The Christian 'devil' delusion.

Now where was I....oh yes, counting the ants in the Aust. outback.

Very good post. Gives me a feeling of what life was like in the cold
world when I was a kid with wars and threats everywhere. Maybe Bush is
trying to actually bring back the good ole days of trials and
tribulations in order to slide his agenda through the door unoticed.
Probably just a symbolic &quot;retro-party&quot; costumes, Baptist attitudes and
all. If you don't have a world threat, make up one. If you need a
Macarthy type communist scare and can't get the rest of the government
to go along, legislate the witch hunt by security proxys, etc...
etc... till the 60s revolt starts all over again and we run the bums
out of Washington and create political correctness and hedonistic
extremes. Goods thing the republicans don't have much of a chance or
it could be a transition like Reagan to Bush sr who sustained the
problem last time.

The electorial college creates a situation where in states where it is
easy to tell which way the majority will vote, become more ignored
while all the billions of dollars spent campaigning is spent on
convincing people in small obscure states who then decide everything
in a disproportional way. Advertisers have an easy time understanding
since they spend billions on research in persuasion and actually seel
products by that persuasion. Its a bill of goods well advertised.

The point is to keep it that way.

&quot;Modern&quot; Afghanistan - prior to the Taliban - had no history of

It's so, so revealing to observe the left - which has virtually no
more communist dictatorships to defend and apologize for - scurrying
to the defense of Islamic fascists, countries where women are treated
as chattel and stoned to death for supposed sexual indiscretions.

As if we needed any more evidence - piled onto all the prior evidence
- that the left is totally and utterly intellectually bankrupt.

Fact: They gave fair warning they would attack if those in the Jewish
leadership went forward and unilaterally declared the State of Israel in the
form it was declared without the full agreement of the people who already
lived in that territory, it's neighbours, the UN, and nations of the World.

Not one Nation in the world at the time supported Israel's imminent
creation, in it's then proposed form, nor the method in which it was
unilaterally created. Not one.

The Arab Nations had openly and clearly stipulated 'due cause' ahead of
time, they didn't do a Japan on Pearl Harbour. Those that went ahead and did
it anyway, knew exactly what they were heading into. It was no surprise, no
trickery involved, and the consequences of that single act are still
unfolding 60 years on.

And they declared War on a Nation State [ not an indiscriminate group of
people ]  That was, and still is, their right to do so.

If it wasn't for the USA breaching the then Internationally accepted weapons
embargo on the Palestine Mandate Territories during that war, and
subsequently, then the situation today would be very different indeed.

Today, it may well be seen and promoted in the media as Arab nations taking
a heroic stand against a known and proven group of terrorists! How ironic is
that?

So I imagine that if Iran is backed up to the wall, who knows what might
happen. They just might defend themselves and their own National Interests
and their population, anyway they can,  like any nation is entitled to do.

And drop a nuke - or two?

Thank you for making my point.

It's important to note that this Iran whose &quot;National Interests&quot; you
are so eagerly defending is a totalitarian dictatorship. And that of
course was precisely the same justification used by the Nazis and
Japanese - and then by the Soviets. Afterall, it was said, don't they
have the right to defend their &quot;National Interests&quot;. Aren't they
&quot;entitled&quot; to it &quot;like any nation&quot;?

No, they don't. They have no rights. There is no right of
dictatorship.

In fact, it is *our right* to destroy them - just as we did the Nazis
and the Japanese. If we had done so *prior* to their building
themselves up to being major military powers, millions upon millions
of lives would have been saved.

If we had done it to the Soviets we could have avoided the long drawn
out &quot;Cold War&quot;, the enslavement of half of Europe, and the nuclear
terror which they directed toward the world for 30 years.

As for Iran, the same blood-thirstiness which the Iranian gov't and
its ruling mullahs direct to their own people, especially women and
political dissidents, is precisely the same bloodthirstiness we can
expect from them if they ever gain a nuclear capability. At the very
least it will give them the means to engage in nuclear blackmail -
just as did the Soviets and the Red Chinese.

We cannot permit that to happen - not if we are dedicated to defending
*our* national interests.

Tiptoeing around Our Problems
By Dr. William Pierce

&quot;We've been talking about the very dangerous situation in the Middle
East recently, just because so much is happening there, and
undoubtedly we'll be talking about it much more in the future. For
that reason I want to make very clear what my motives and sympathies
are, lest I lead anyone astray and be thought a hypocrite for doing
so. First, regarding Palestine: although my sympathies definitely lie
with the Palestinians rather than with the Jews, it is not horror at
what the Jews are doing to the Palestinians that motivates me. What
motivates me is horror that my country is being used by the Jews in
their war against the Palestinians. If America were not involved at
all in the Middle East I still would sympathize with the Palestinians
and I would wish that they could be successful in driving the Jews
into the sea and annihilating the abomination that is Israel, but that
conflict between Jews and Palestinians would not be a major concern
for me. At least, my
concern there would be dwarfed by my concern for problems more
directly involving my own people in America and in Europe and in
southern Africa.

Even now, with money and weapons being supplied by America and used to
slaughter Palestinians, my concern is much less with monsters like
Ariel Sharon who are doing the slaughtering than it is with the filthy
creatures among my own people in America who are collaborating with
Jews here to keep the weapons and money flowing to Sharon -- and are
ready to do whatever else the Jews require of them here or abroad.

So when I tell you about Jews in occupied Palestine shooting
Palestinian children, and disapproval and anger are evident in my
voice, what I really am angry about is that the American people, my
people, are being used for this murderous activity. I am angry that
America's whole foreign policy has been perverted to serve Jewish
interests at the expense of American interests. I am angry that
America's political system has been perverted to ensure that we always
have so-called &quot;leaders,&quot; whether Democrat or Republican, who are
dependent on the Jewish media or Jewish money or both for their
election and consequently will do the bidding of the Jews. I am angry
that our whole government is riddled with Jews -- Jews in our Defense
Department, Jews in our State
Department, Jews in our Immigration and Naturalization Service, Jews
in our Justice Department, Jews in the President's speech-writing
staff - who really set the policies of our government behind the
scenes, while the politicians are out front in the spotlight making
speeches and kissing babies - and doing as they're told by the Jews
behind the
scenes.

Did you know that it was a Jewish speechwriter, David Frum, who put
the phrase &quot;axis of evil&quot; in George Bush's mouth to justify America's
ongoing war against Israel's enemies? Did you know that a clique of
Jews in the Defense Department and among George Bush's foreign policy
advisers are the people actually running the so-called &quot;war on terror&quot;
in Afghanistan: a war that they intend to expand to Iraq and any other
Middle Eastern country that gets uppity, in order to make that part of
the world safe for Israel at American expense? Secretary of Defense
Donald Rumsfeld is a front man for his nominal subordinates, Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Deputy Undersecretary of
Defense for Policy Douglas Feith; and George Bush's official foreign
policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, helps him meet his Black quota for
the Cabinet, but it is the Jew Richard Perle, chairman of Bush's
Defense Policy Board, who gives him his foreign policy directives.

As I've said on more than one occasion, George Bush is a feckless
nincompoop who couldn't come up with a defense policy or a foreign
policy on his own if he had to -- which is why he's President. The
real policymakers behind the scenes certainly don't want a man in the
White House who has ideas of his own, because those ideas might
conflict with theirs.

And it is nothing but empty sophistry to make a distinction between
Jews in Israel, such as Ariel Sharon and Simon Peres, and the Jews in
Mr. Bush's administration formulating his policies or the Jews
controlling our mass media. They all are Jews, and that's what really
matters.

There are many knowledgeable Americans besides me who think that it's
not a good thing to have Jews using America to advance Israel's
interests at the expense of America's interests. They know how the
system works: how the Jews exert their control through money and media
and a well-entrenched network of Jewish operatives, such as Wolfowitz
and Feith and Perle. And many of these knowledgeable Americans also
understand how Jewish subterfuge and deceit work: they understand that
the Jews throw up a lot of smoke to conceal their control and make it
appear that they have much less influence than they actually do.

Despite this degree of understanding that many knowledgeable Americans
have, there seem to be very few who are willing or able to draw the
necessary conclusions. What I keep seeing are comments about the need
to get the so-called &quot;peace process&quot; going again in the Middle East,
and how there are hardline supporters of Israel who are obstructing
the &quot;peace process&quot; because they think that it will give too much to
the Palestinians or will compromise Israel's security, or whatever.
These knowledgeable Americans seem to believe that if we could just
get around the Jewish hardliners somehow -- if we could just
neutralize Jews such as Wolfowitz and Feith and Perle; if Ariel Sharon
could be replaced by a &quot;moderate&quot; Jewish prime minister -- then the
&quot;peace process&quot; could proceed, America could gradually reduce its
involvement in helping the Jews keep the Palestinians repressed, and
eventually Israel no longer would be using America, and everything
would be rosy. And so these knowledgeable Americans expend all of
their wit and energy in these trivial pursuits.

Listen! Do you know what the most hopeful aspect of the conflict
between Jews and Palestinians is now? It is the ongoing radicalization
of the Muslim masses throughout the whole Middle East. The
collaborator governments in Pakistan, in Egypt, in Saudi Arabia are
terrified of the reaction they see among their own people to what
Ariel Sharon is doing to the Palestinians. When Sharon's Jewish troops
shoot Palestinian children, Muslim mobs riot, and governments that now
collaborate with the United States quake. Ariel Sharon is the best
thing that has happened in the Middle East in the last 54 years.

The Palestinian tactic of suicide bombing is being denounced by every
politician and every media spokesman over here now. It's nothing but
terrorism, they all say. There's no justification at all for suicide
bombing, they tell us. Of course, whenever you hear that sort of
unanimity from the politicians and the media people you should be
suspicious. In fact, suicide bombing is the best tactic for the
Palestinians to use now, because it provokes the Jews to step up
reprisals. And the reprisals radicalize the masses in every country in
the Middle East. If just one of the collaborator governments falls,
the spines of all the rest will be stiffened, and the Bush government
will be far less likely to find collaborators for building its
so-called &quot;coalition&quot; to do the will of the Jews in the Middle East.

Suicide bombers now hardly put a dent in the population of five
million Jews in occupied Palestine, and Sharon's bloody reprisals
hardly put a dent in the overall Palestinian population. But if
conflict of this sort continues until just one collaborator government
is overthrown, that ultimately will be worth more than ten thousand
successful suicide
bombings in which only 20 or so Jews are killed each time. In the long
run there can be no real peace in the Middle East and no end to
America's shameful role there -- and no future for the Palestinian
people -- as long as there is an Israel. There seems to be a better
understanding of these things among knowledgeable Palestinians than
among knowledgeable Americans.

Shallow thinking and the pursuit of trivial goals is even worse among
knowledgeable Americans when it comes to domestic problems. They
really do not want to grasp these problems with both hands and deal
with them in a forthright way. Look, for example, at what uncontrolled
immigration has done and is doing to America. And what do
knowledgeable Americans propose to do about that? Very little, really.
They make much of the fact that several of the al-Qaeda hijackers who
carried out the September 11 attack were in the United States only
because of very lax immigration policies, and so that's a good reason
for tightening up the policies.

How about simply rounding up all illegal aliens immediately -- all 12
million of them -- and booting them and all of their offspring out of
the country without further ado?

Oh, no, no, no! We can't do that! Why not? Well, the media never would
stand for it. The media would be all over anyone who even proposed a
mass expulsion of illegal aliens. They would denounce any political
leader who tried to do that as a &quot;racist&quot; and a &quot;neo-Nazi.&quot; And so
knowledgeable Americans, who understand the immigration disaster quite
well, continue tiptoeing around it, afraid to do or even say anything
really significant about it: terrified even to think about really
radical solutions that might actually end the problem. And it's the
same with the rest of our domestic problems. Lots of people understand
these problems and are worried about them, but they won't tackle them
in any
significant way. They let the Jews -- the Jewish media and Jewish
money and the entrenched Jewish network -- have their way, for all
practical purposes.

Why? Why are the Jews permitted to get away with all of their
destructive policies and activities without being challenged or
opposed in any significant way? Part of the reason is that the Jews
are very

&quot;With thousands of years of recorded history, and due to an unchanging
geographic (and subsequently geopolitical) condition , Iran
(previously known as Persia in the West until 1935) has had a long,
varied, and checkered military culture and history, ranging from
triumphant and unchallenged ancient military supremacy affording
effective superpower status in its day, to a series of near
catastrophic defeats (beginning with the destruction of Elam) at the
hand of previously subdued peripheral nations (including Greece,
Arabia, and the Asiatic nomadic tribes at the Eastern boundary of the
lands traditionally home to the Iranian people).

In its time, Iran has rapidly dispatched ancient powers such as
Babylon; its kings have sat enthroned as Pharaoh in Egypt; repeatedly
held off, sometimes defeated, the otherwise successful armies of Rome
(most memorably recording the submissive demeanor of a captured Roman
Caesar); and apparently affected even a presumably hostile Greek
historian to dedicate an entire book considering in detail the pseudo-
military culture of the ancient Persians of Shahanshah [Dariush the
great].

Iranian military actions and martial culture have also left Iran with
a rich legacy of contributions to military arts, weapons, tactics,
strategy, and conduct of the mankind. The word navy is a term derived
from Persian Naavs (ships) of Achaemenid military expeditions against
ancient Greece. Those very same expeditions entailed crossings of
entire armies from Asia to Europe over military bridges constructed by
extending a floating platform of ships from the Asian land mass to
Europe.

One of the earliest and most effective manifestations of light cavalry
equipped with stand-off weapons were the bow and arrow equipped
Parthian Cavalry.

The first Knights (in the sense of Warrior-Priests,) complete with
shinning armor and plumed helmets were Sasaanid Iranian nobles, and
European heraldry is directly traceable to the Iranian Knights and
overall culture of (lone) heroes and mythic figures such as Rostam,
Zaal, Bahram Chubin, etc.

And it was the sovereign head of the Iranian Army that marched un-
opposed into Babylon that decreed the first codec of the rights of
conquered people and nations.

And this is the same country that suffered completely unexpected and
decisive defeats at the hands of Alexander, and later Muslim Arabs,
seemingly at the height of its might. And later on felt the full force
of the brutally violent and destructive West-ward Mongol tribes.

Thus this topic requires a consideration of the mythical, cultural,
technological, operational, tactical, strategic, and ultimately
****socio-psychological*** dimensions of the military history of
Iran.&quot;

">

&quot;In 1979, the year of the Shah's departure and the revolution, the
Iranian military experienced a 60% desertion from its ranks. Following
the ideological principles of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the new
revolutionary government sought to strengthen its domestic situation
by conducting a purge of all military personnel associated with the
Pahlavi Dynasty.

Iranian soldiers landing from a CH-47 Chinook helicopter in the
northern front of the Iran-Iraq war.It is still unclear how many were
killed, but numbers go into the tens-of-thousands. The purge resulted
in tempting the dictator of Iraq, Saddam Hussein to view Iran as
disorganised and weak causing the Iran-Iraq War. The indecisive eight
year war wreaked havoc on the region and the Iranian military, only
coming to an end in 1988 after it expanded into the Persian Gulf and
led to clashes between the United States Navy and Iranian military
forces between 1987-1988. Following the Iran-Iraq War an ambitious
military rebuilding program was set into motion with the intention to
create a fully fledged military industry.

Regionally, since the Islamic Revolution, Iran has sought to exert its
influence by supporting various groups (militarily and politically).
It openly supports Hizbullah in Lebanon and in order to influence
Lebanon. Various Kurdish groups are also supported as needed in order
to maintain control of its Kurdish regions. In neighbouring
Afghanistan, Iran supported the Northern Alliance for over a decade
against the Taliban, and nearly went to war against the Taliban in
1998.&quot;

Israel does not uphold freedom except for Jews - that makes it a

Oh, I thought that's what you lefties do when a Republican takes the

As for Iran being a democracy. It's once again merely &quot;All that

&quot;Iran's reform movement peaked in the late 1990s after reformist
Mohammad Khatami was elected president and his supporters swept
parliament. But their efforts to ease social and political
restrictions were stymied by hard-liners who control the judiciary,
security forces and powerful unelected bodies in the government....

In recent months, dissenters have witnessed an increasing crackdown,
with hundreds detained on accusations of threatening the Iranian
system. Numerous pro-reform newspapers have been shut down and those
that remain have muted their criticism.&quot;
