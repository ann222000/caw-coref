Maybe you should try limiting your posts to only ONE every three
seconds.

There is ZERO chance that that spammer will see your post.
He has been doing this over a decade, changing providers monthly.
It is done with a bot.

If you want to vent, look at the headers
(for Google Groupers that's **More options** Â **Show original**)
and report him to his provider.

...and doing *anything* MORE THAN 24 HOURS after the spew,
is a completely impotent act on your part.
