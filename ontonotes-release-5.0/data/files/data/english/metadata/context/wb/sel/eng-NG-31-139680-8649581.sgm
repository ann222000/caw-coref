Yep, that is &quot;YACD&quot;, not &quot;YASD&quot;.

I knew the level was going to be interesting as soon as I saw &quot;You sense
a horde of monsters. You sense something dangerous 33 times.&quot; My initial
guess was &quot;Troll pit,&quot; but it wasn't ... fortunately, as it turns out.

I quaffed a !Enlightenment I had on me for use the next time I got an
interesting level. It revealed a level whose lower right corner
contained a suspiciously troll-pit-shaped room but containing a couple
of weapons or armors. I didn't see any other pit-like rooms anywhere,
though there were several oddly-shaped ones, including a big room
flooded with water with some trees and a central &quot;castle&quot; in the middle
of this &quot;moat&quot;.

Naturally, I started by exploring away from the suspected pit heading to
the top left corner, then left and down and right. In the top left area
I got a bunch of red messages about premonitions of death, and was
afflicted with the fear status ailment! At first I thought it was some
unnoticed monster attacking with a scary and unfamiliar spell, and I
checked my HP first -- normal -- and then the map nearby -- unoccupied
except for one lonely creature with the symbol '@'. Then I saw that the
depth &quot;Lev 44&quot; in the bottom right corner was dark red.

That was the *level feeling message*?! Vanilla never did anything like
that. Even Zangband gave a &quot;bad feeling&quot; sometimes, but never like that...

I proceed very, very cautiously to kick the can of everything I find in
the parts of the level that look relatively normal. Next is the
moat-room, where a sharpshooter does a bit of damage before falling to a
barrage of Doom Bolt (whose fail is now low enough to use as a workhorse
damage-dealer when mana conservation is unimportant). That's the worst
thing there and the only unfamiliar thing, and it's not actually out of
depth.

From this room I can creep far enough right to image the suspected pit
with temp ESP ... and it's swarming with &amp;s which I hadn't seen all game
(or indeed, in Angband ever). Turns out the &amp;s are Erinyes, though, a
familiar and relatively tame monster from Angband tradition, despite the
new symbol.

I risk a closer approach and there's only a handful of anything else in
there -- Vrocks, which I know will strip my hide if I let them get
within melee range, but are otherwise harmless to a fella with resist
blindness.

There is a large empty room some distance from the pit, such that I can
rest in it without attracting demons but I can also go to one corner and
lure some of them to approach through various corridors.

It takes a lot of dispel evils, and resting. The odd Erinyes summon of a
Bodak or Lamia slows things not at all due to the power of m2c to affect
everything evil in sight. Soon, I need to move closer to the pit to lure
out what's left. A dragon, some stone trolls, and one or two other
random monsters interrupt and fall to Doom Bolt if they aren't dispelled
by Dispel Evil. Once or twice low mana and plenty of monsters still
nearby leads me to use acid bolt rods and blinking; once or twice I feel
the need to teleport and regroup.

When all is said and done, the floor is littered with junk in the room I
used as the killing field and in the surrounding corridors. There's a
ton of weapons and armor none of which are worth keeping -- even the
excellent ones. A convenient Staff of Perception dropped and I used it
to ID the excellent items, and what were they but really heavy armor of
resist acid (*yawn* already got artifact body armor at 1/20 the weight)
and a shield of resist cold or some such. There's no fewer than six new
item types -- two potion types, two rod types, a mushroom type, and
scroll type. Needless to say I test these only when there's no enemy
left nearby. Mushroom is for berserking; useless for a caster so I dump
the remaining one. Two rods of polymorph and one of sense surroundings.
Both look worth trying to sell but not use; sense surroundings is
something I already have via a perception skill talent. One potion is
restore wisdom; the other is strength -- not restore strength, just
plain strength. And there are two of them.

Statgain time! Indeed, potions of int and wis dropped as well, and two
of charisma. An amulet of int +4 dropped, replacing my +3 one. A ring of
sustain body. Amulet of wis +4 I have no use for.

The items in the pit (odd, for there to be floor items in a pit) prove
to be relatively uninteresting.

When all is said and done, I've had a tiny bit of XP drain (a summoned
Lamia got close) and my stats are intact (the Sustain Body dropped
earlier in the level and I wore it during the entire pit wiping, so the
Erinyes couldn't drain my strength).

Oh, and did I mention I racked up nearly 55,000 experience points?
Enough to use a pittance to remove the drain and a ton more to get
almost everything up to 70%. That gives me Mists of Death and, from the
look, every town book spell.

I've seen deep books now -- both times priestly books. One was dropped
by one of today's Erinyes, of all the things to be carrying such a book.
It got sold for a nice chunk of change.

My score is nearly 800 now thanks to the Vrocks, and I have the sense
charges talent apparently from raising magical devices. Sense charges
doesn't seem to work exactly like learn magic; I can't seem to use it on
rings or amulets with unknown pluses, for example.

Most of my important spells have low fails now, and the shadow warping
type spells are coming down in fail. Str is now 14, which should help
with burden slowing a lot. Every important ability is green or better,
and all but Saving Throw blue or better...

Thanks. Most of the stuff you've labeled &quot;sell&quot; are things I actually do
intend to sell. With the armor and weapons that are not keepers, the
store won't offer full value until the shopkeeper rotates. The magical
devices and rings and such are waiting until the magic shop stops
claiming to be &quot;full&quot; for whatever reason. I'd rather they tell you if
they buy something you won't be able to buy it back than just say
they're &quot;full&quot;.

when the shop is full, i'd say the shopkeeper should destroy the lowest
value item he has if he the item sold to him has more value... with an
option to buy that lowest priced item from him before he destroys it

shop is full
you sell an excellent item to shopkeeper
shopkeeper tells you he has to get rid of xxxxxx to make room
shopkeeper offers to sell you his lowest priced item (reduced price)
any unsold stock of xxxxxx is destroyed by shopkeeper
excellent item added to shopkeeper's inventory (shop still full)

after all... isn't that what many adventurers do to maximize their income?
shopkeepers should do the same

It's almost pointless in a game where money is so irrelevant so soon.
In S, you could simply allow the store to take the weapon as an
investment equal to its value - ie. they don't pay you for it, because
they've got no room to stock it, but you can give it to them and be
credited with an investment for that amount.

&gt; &gt; &gt; when the shop is full, i'd say the shopkeeper should destroy the lowest
&gt; &gt; &gt; value item he has if he the item sold to him has more value... with an
&gt; &gt; &gt; option to buy that lowest priced item from him before he destroys it

&gt; &gt; &gt; shop is full
&gt; &gt; &gt; you sell an excellent item to shopkeeper
&gt; &gt; &gt; shopkeeper tells you he has to get rid of xxxxxx to make room
&gt; &gt; &gt; shopkeeper offers to sell you his lowest priced item (reduced price)
&gt; &gt; &gt; any unsold stock of xxxxxx is destroyed by shopkeeper
&gt; &gt; &gt; excellent item added to shopkeeper's inventory (shop still full)

&gt; &gt; &gt; after all... isn't that what many adventurers do to maximize their income?
&gt; &gt; &gt; shopkeepers should do the same

&gt; &gt; Kind of surprised no one else responded to this one -- I think this is a great
&gt; &gt; idea ... normally I just buy the cheapest thing, sell what I want to sell, and
&gt; &gt; destroy what I bought -- streamlining this process would be really helpful!

&gt; It's almost pointless in a game where money is so irrelevant so soon.
&gt; In S, you could simply allow the store to take the weapon as an
&gt; investment equal to its value - ie. they don't pay you for it, because
&gt; they've got no room to stock it, but you can give it to them and be
&gt; credited with an investment for that amount.
">

Yes, this would be fine also -- what I find mildly frustrating is having
shopkeepers go &quot;I have no room&quot; -- anything to get around that would be a mild
blessing :)

the shopkeeper always tries to make a set profit on the inventory he brings
in and would/should always want to have the higher selling items to make
more profit...

50% profit on a single $5 item is $2.50 profit
50% profit on a stack of $5 items (qty 20) is $50.00
50% profit on a single $100 item is $50.00

(well,... actually, he/she would really want the items that will sell
faster, so he can buy food for his family that day... but who's going to
code in a supply/demand system for shopkeeper pricing?)

so if he can afford to lose the amount he invested in a low cost item, he
would want that higher priced item to sell off for a greater profit
(assuming fixed percentage profit system like most (all?) roguelike games)

This is one of those realism / gameplay balancing things.

He doesn't need motivation, he is game code. It makes things more pleasant for
the player as it shortcuts certain situations that take longer than they were
ideally designed to do.

Technically, a shopkeeper isn't really going to be that limited for space that
they cannot make a purchase for an item they want -- If we are looking at
realism, is the shopkeeper really going to say &quot;I don't have room&quot; when looking
at buying a ring of speed (+12) for 30k? Doesn't have room for a ring?

This is just a game smoothing thing as far as I can see, and I would certainly
welcome something along these lines.

Haha -- If I wanted to _buy_ the kit for my character, the shop wouldn't be full
now would it? :)

I just have some kind of obsessive compulsive order with stocking up on loads of
things to lug back and sell, and I find it frustrating that the shopkeeper
doesn't want to buy my wonderful spoils -- how can an adventurer make a

The game really is better if you cannot sell anything at all.

Boost the value of money drops by [at least] a factor of 3, stop shopkeepers
from buying anything, and after 2 or 3 games you will hate to go back.

Yes, you are quite right here, and it goes back to your comments on the
squelching issues a little while back.

Perhaps the (initially drastic) way to deal with this is to drop the shops. Have
a temple selling restore stat &quot;service&quot; (at some unreasonable price like 5,000),
Magic shop sells useful scrolls (read WoR and Teleport only here, at about 500
and 300 respectively). Dump the alchemy shop. On the note of price, make Restore
Life Levels another &quot;service&quot;, at perhaps 3,000 or so, and CCW potions not for
sale. CSW sold at 500 or so, and CLW at 50 - this way they are useful to begin
with, and the upgrade is smoother. Stops munchkin-stocking of CCW potions.

Weapon and Armour can be combined to a &quot;adventurers shop&quot;, and contains less
quality items - smaller weapons, nothing above +0,+0, no longbows, katanas, no
armour over [6,+0], no iron helms, large leather shields, gauntlets, hard
leather boots.

Dump the black market, fun that it is the temptation to scum it is unreasonable
(was better when shops were 1-6 only, but I'd miss the home).

Leaves only food, light and tool shop (1), adventurers shop (2), temple (3),
Magic Shop (4), and home (5).

Make sure nothing will accept items bought from the dungeon except for maybe the
adventurers taking artifacts.

This will probably help the TMJ issue IMHO. As only useful drops are worth
investigating, it will be much more immediately obvious what drops tend to be
generally junk.

I think you are reading way too much into what I wrote.

All I meant to suggest is that rather than gain gold by selling items, the
player should gain gold by collecting gold.  Be an adventurer, not a merchant!
You feel liberated when you ignore junk rather than lugging it back to town.

With a scaling factor of only 3, gold is sufficient to survive, but in fairly
short supply for a noticeable amount of time.  Perhaps a factor of 6 or so
would give people about the amount of money they are used to having.  I guess
you can tell deep down I agree with you, but that wasn't my actual point
above.

I needed that sling desperately. (I needed the spear too--I was
getting two lousy blows with the Katana.)  Killing Scatha and Itangast
with a Sling(+7,+9) was a real pain.

And then all they coughed up was the Phial and a bunch of Armor of

Not if he solves the problem of TMJ as effectively as it is in
Steamband.  You don't have to buy much equipment in the stores, but
you don't have to slaughter infinite monsters for loot either.  Rather
the contrary: almost all gear comes from the floor, vaults and
uniques, until you get really deep.

&gt; &gt; with, and the upgrade is smoother. Stops munchkin-stocking of CCW potions.

&gt; &gt; Weapon and Armour can be combined to a &quot;adventurers shop&quot;, and contains less
&gt; &gt; quality items - smaller weapons, nothing above +0,+0, no longbows, katanas, no
&gt; &gt; armour over [6,+0], no iron helms, large leather shields, gauntlets, hard
&gt; &gt; leather boots.

&gt; &gt; Dump the black market, fun that it is the temptation to scum it is unreasonable
&gt; &gt; (was better when shops were 1-6 only, but I'd miss the home).

&gt; &gt; Leaves only food, light and tool shop (1), adventurers shop (2), temple (3),
&gt; &gt; Magic Shop (4), and home (5).

&gt; I suppose you think Pete's dump of a brigand that bought a sling of extra
&gt; shots is out of line. :)

&gt; Your suggestions would make the game a lot harder.

&gt; Do you think the game is currently too easy, or do you have other suggestions

I think the game is too orientated towards a tiny proportion of items being
useful. scrolls of Teleport and potions of CCW are the staples that, with a
Staff of teleportation later on (barring rBlind and rConf and 0% failure anyway)
are used be everyone.

When's the last time you bought a scroll of light, object detection or trap
detection from the shops, or potions of boldness?

Or for that matter wands of, for example, sleep monster?

It seems the &quot;formulae&quot; for winning Vanilla are incredibly restrictive - now I'm
not endorsing the &quot;every item has a crazy hidden benefit&quot; that NetHack seems to
enjoy, but it would be nice that the core items could be made a fair bit more
expensive. Later on, 500 a pop for !CCW is nothing -- earlier on you have to
balance it, perhaps actually giving !CLW a buyer for the first time.

Ranger - Get arrows, enchant bow, get !CCW, !speed, ?Phase, ?Tele, and the first
two books, and waltz to 1000' without any big hassles -- You can dump most of
the rest of the items you find without any real loss.

What I'd _really_ like to see is item acid damage being temporary and
&quot;repairable&quot;, and not actually have the ability to enchant weapons or armour. It
seems so munchkinlike to grab any old weapon and scum it up to +9,+9 -- that's
supposed to be a really _good_ magical item, not a shop bought stock knife and a
few scrolls.

I think part of the TMJ problem is that such a high proportion of items are junk
from the very beginning. I reckon 80% of dungeon drops at 50' and 100' are
simply a waste of temporary memory space, and I would like to see that addressed
at some stage.

Besides which, my characters die primarily from boredom (or, in the latest
escapade with Andrew Doull's rebalanced monster patch, something new and
surprising such as the much changed Bullroarer) - the game is not actually very
difficult for people with the time and patience to slog their way through,
running whenever the chance of being in serious trouble rises above a fraction
of a percent, and happily taking 7 to 8 encounters to kill any of the serious
uniques. It is lack of patience that kills, and that seems to be a sad primary
cause of death for a game IMHO.

This is the nature of limited slots.  If you wany players to use lots of
items, you need to increase the number of slots.  I recently tossed a staff of
power due to too few slots.  If a staff of power can be junk, pretty much any
consumable can be junk.

I try to buy every single ?dObj until I have clairvoyance or some other source
of object detection.  I occasionally buy light and trap detection.  They can
be useful to a diver without the appropriate rods.  Boldness is a junk item,
and in fact Remove Fear is a junk spell.  Anything that causes fear does so
often enough to outlast your supply of fear removal.  You need timed fear
immunity for it to be useful.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Or for that matter wands of, for example, sleep monster?
">

I use those only in games where I cannot sell them, perhaps one charge every 2
games.  Some recent thread had a couple people discussing the importance of
using sleep monster when clearing an orcpit, so some people find them useful.

This is one of the reasons I am such a big proponent of squelch.
Some people use sleep, we don't.  I use ?dObj, you don't.  Different strokes.

I don't see the point.  CLW is junk, unless you have a stack or the ability to
cast the spell repeatedly.  That's all there is to it.  Changing prices
doesn't change that fundamental truth.

The larger question is whether there should be an unlimited town supply of
!CCW.  IMO the temple should start with a fixed number, and never restock.
I do not remember a single voice agreeing the last time I proposed this.

That's because missile weapons are ridiculously overpowered.
Ranger is a munchkin class.  There is no point in complaining about it.

I agree with removing player enchantment of items entirely.
If Calris comes with -20 to hit, that's the way it should remain.

I'd just remove the &quot;acid damage weakens armor&quot; entirely.  It's not worth the
effort.  Losing scrolls etc from the pack is disincentive enough.  The idea
that a weapon in the pack can melt, but the one doing the fighting is immune,
is so contrary to immersion in the game I'd like to see that removed too.

The game is too linear at the start.  I think chars should start at a
reasonable cLevel, say 10, and the dungeon can start at 500'.  Then you can
dump all the bogus items that are only useful to complete wimps.

Lots of people disagree, and this isn't going to happen, so I probably should
not have mentioned it, but once you see the underlying problem, you can
understand why the symptoms appear.

I have a cure for that.  Try playing with hard turncount limits.
3000' with fewer than 400 hp is rarely boring. :)

I would agree with you, except I keep reading notes by people who have played
for years without winning.  That makes me think the game must be fairly hard.

I agree with this.  However, it is fundamental to *bands.  In many games,
people think nothing of savefile scumming.  I doubt you can find a Civ player
who hasn't savescummed a dozen times.  Yet in *bands, it is considered
cheating.  This sort of attitude is a considered opinion that patience is
of primary importance.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I just have some kind of obsessive compulsive order with stocking up on loads of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things to lug back and sell, and I find it frustrating that the shopkeeper
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't want to buy my wonderful spoils -- how can an adventurer make a
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reputation for himself with rejectable loot?

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The game really is better if you cannot sell anything at all.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boost the value of money drops by [at least] a factor of 3, stop shopkeepers
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from buying anything, and after 2 or 3 games you will hate to go back.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you are quite right here, and it goes back to your comments on the
&gt; &gt; &gt; squelching issues a little while back.

&gt; &gt; I think you are reading way too much into what I wrote.

&gt; &gt; All I meant to suggest is that rather than gain gold by selling items, the
&gt; &gt; player should gain gold by collecting gold.  Be an adventurer, not a merchant!
&gt; &gt; You feel liberated when you ignore junk rather than lugging it back to town.

&gt; &gt; With a scaling factor of only 3, gold is sufficient to survive, but in fairly
&gt; &gt; short supply for a noticeable amount of time.  Perhaps a factor of 6 or so
&gt; &gt; would give people about the amount of money they are used to having.  I guess
&gt; &gt; you can tell deep down I agree with you, but that wasn't my actual point
&gt; &gt; above.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps the (initially drastic) way to deal with this is to drop the shops. Have
&gt; &gt; &gt; a temple selling restore stat &quot;service&quot; (at some unreasonable price like 5,000),
&gt; &gt; &gt; Magic shop sells useful scrolls (read WoR and Teleport only here, at about 500
&gt; &gt; &gt; and 300 respectively). Dump the alchemy shop. On the note of price, make Restore
&gt; &gt; &gt; Life Levels another &quot;service&quot;, at perhaps 3,000 or so, and CCW potions not for
&gt; &gt; &gt; sale. CSW sold at 500 or so, and CLW at 50 - this way they are useful to begin
&gt; &gt; &gt; with, and the upgrade is smoother. Stops munchkin-stocking of CCW potions.

I buy ?DTraps pretty often, if I'm playing a non-spellcaster. They are
cheaper than the staffs, and if I don't get luck with a rod early,
it's better than nothing.  (Most recent game, I was using Staffs and
Scrolls to ~1800')

I buy ?DObj regularly as well, if not enough staffs show up in the
dungeon.  Object detection is a fairly late spell for all classes
except for Rogues.
