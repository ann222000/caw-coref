We have some great off-topic discussions that stem from an on-topic
thread , but it is important that the headings change as the topic does.
Lately the headings have remained unchanged through several changes of
topics, making it tedious when trying to find some antique discussion
among the recipes:~))

"/> I just wrote a huge reply on this and then the PC locked up!!

Anyway...I use &quot;OT&quot; in my headers so that anyone can killfile these
messages and never see them. FWIW I have posted over 50 referenced
antique pictures to my site since January and mostly get little or no
response in the group.

IMHO I think that the recent OT threads have at least kept *some*
conversation going and are as valid as discussions on non-antique
collecibles...oe even dross like depression glass.

I wish someone different from the usual few would try to start a
really good **antique** thread!! The WMF thing was good....and in the
past, the tin/pewter thread...but these are thin on the ground.

Even John Bly asked a basic question to US members the other day in
his first mail, and I have not seen a reply yet?

How about looking at HIS stock on his site and asking him something
like how he gets to a figure of 137,000 ukp for one of the
pieces...why not 50,000 or 500,000??

I'll try and answer any antique related thread to the best of my
ability and past trading knowledge...but until then clearly marked OT
topicslike crayfish, Cyn's lovelife and Scotch-Irish will just have to
do...

"/> Hi Jon, my post is in no way a criticism of your posts and input and I
have replied to John Bly's post, my point being that some of these
threads tend to have headings that are in no way related to the original
content. When I can only scrape 1/2 hour to maybe an hour at best a day
to participate here at RA I find it difficult to keep track of what's
going on, time I post the Ungodly and help put out potential flame wars
there's even less time. I'II discuss anything with anybody ( I can cook
with the best of them) but it would help people like myself who want to
participate , but have very limited time, if the headings changed with
the topic.

ever get the link to my own updated gallery? If so, it was ignored or
not responded to, or I never saw the posts.

Go ahead and ask me a question about anything pictured there. If

Also, thanks to Michele for trying to help with my plate. I'm

"/> Molly, do you collect these as well as sell them? or maybe ya don't sell

The one thing I can't sell is bed linen or bed clothing, or tea cloths
and the like. Can just about manage the odd quilt or two, even quilts are
slow with me, so most times I end up keeping the quilts. Maybe it just
me, although, I don't know many dealers around my area that can sell much
bed-linen or the like. During the summer time, if I get a few American
tourist through the door they will buy small pieces of bed-linen, pillow
cases, tea cloths and the like. But they never give me much for them.

Most of my bed-linen and table and tea linens come via house clearances
of large job lots, how the hell do ya bid someone on a pair of pillow
cases or a single doily ... I usually shy away.

Anyways, those &quot;shams&quot; are very pretty. Out of curiosity what would one
expect to pay for pair of these, on average. And why are they called
shams?

Maybe I should sell all my bed linen etc on ebay, easy shipping and we
have obviously tons of it about in my neck of the woods. :)

Mike,
I think we have to be careful about assuming that someone who asks a very
basic question about an area of antiques suffers from lack of overview. I
have been at &amp; about this business for (oh, Lordy, can it be true?) well
over 40 years and have worked at learning as well as earning because that is
where the fun of it is, but I certainly have big, big holes in the fabric of
my knowledge. Sometimes we just don't happen to have run across enough items
of certain kinds that would form a basis for beginning to gain a real
understanding of that field. e.g.. painted country furniture here in Florida
or, for that matter, in Indiana from whence I migrated many years ago.
Sometimes a specific field, such as carnival glass, just does not interest
enough to worry about it. Then when circumstances or taste changes, it is
time to learn about it....entry level or not.....and I think there are those
who (having spent years researching companies, patterns, &amp; processes) would
question your definition of carnival glass as an entry level collectible.
In fact I find the whole question of entry level antiques versus secondary?
professional? respectable? informed? higher? elevated? cultured? couther?
what-ever-the-heck-comes-next? level of collecting an interesting one.
Unless one has the luxury of collecting historically important pieces(by
provenance or design), or pieces exemplifying the craftsmanship of the
period, I would suspect that we tend to expand our collecting by deepening
our knowledge of our field and/or we deepen our collecting by expanding its
scope to related things. e.g.. a rug to drape across the table that
originally boasted one, and then another because the first was so
interesting.
I enjoy this group and have learned much by hanging around. I really
appreciate the fact that you, Mike, do so much to keep this group on an even
keel, so the information and camaraderie can continue to flow.

Well, I can answer for a large group of us. We don't answer the
questions because we have NO idea of an answer. Yes, despite all appearances
many of us are clueless. Nope, not even able to guess.
But if we keep reading some wonderful folks will come up with replies
and we get to learn. Learn SO much. It's the whole reason to hang around
here. Just sitting and soaking up knowledge. It's a gift.
Yeh, it would be cool if more people spoke up, but we are out there and
we are paying attention. Some of us try to participate when we can...but I'm
sure there are others who just lurk, but appreciate the learning too.
Please know that you regular posters and brave souls who rise to the
challenge are appreciated.

doke....now I've had some time to think about the subject. As is sometimes
the case...I have come up with more words. And btw don't you think
somethink like D R O O L !!!!! should be against the rules, too?
But then...we can make allowances for Mensa members, I suppose.
Okey, about the linens. It seems to me that linens are a uniquely
feminine thing. And I am one of those people who *hates* making that
distinction. But lets admit it...there are some things that men gravitate
towards and some things that women gravitate towards. This is not exclusively
so....but generally so.
The dealers I know who are interested in very fine linens are women.
Perhaps this is because much of the hand work done on antique linens was done
by women (sort of a retrospective empathy?). I know, I know....many fine
tailors and designers were/are men. But still....
I sell linens....they usually require a great deal of washing, ironing,
and sometimes repair. They are steady sellers and I make good profit on them.
I have a hard time imagining you or T. or Filthy Rich spending many hours in
your day ironing and washing linens. Again, I am stereotyping and would be
happy for someone to point out my error.
Every table deserves an exquisite tablecloth to set off the silver and
china and glass that has been so carefully collected. Every lovely bed
deserves handpicked pillow shams, embroidered sheets, lace trims....don't you
think?
Maybe it is too fussy for men to deal with....but it contributes the extra
special touch to a home that is sometimes overlooked.
That is my opinion.
Cancel the box idea. Ebay is a much better solution. Best wishes!

Hey, Mike, you'd better have thick skin with an appraisal like that.
A lot of us (collectors, not necessarily r.a.-ers) think carnival
glass is the bee's knees. And if I catch you around any of mine with
a hammer, WATCH OUT, SUCKAH!!!! Interesting, too, that you label it
&quot;entry-level collecting&quot; and call it inexpensive. Carnival is quite a
complex thing to learn -- and many of the pieces sell in the thousands
of dollars.

"/> I don't disagree with a word of it, Little Fairy. But the fact remains I
can't really sell the most of it. I can sell L A R G E table cloths in
damask, old ones of fine quality, 'cos they are hard to come by and folk
do buy them. Quilts, yes, but to a special type of customer, seems many
folk these days buy either new hand-crafted ones (btw my cousin is a
quilter, has her own studio/workshop) or the Far-Eastern imported
rubbish. Well, that's the story from little old me. So after all that, ya
don't really want the old Irish linen that I can't sell? .. Okey doke!

Now, our bedroom (me and the missus that is) the bed, has always nice
'old' clean white linen sheets, under pillows are usually plain white
linen as well, top pillows are for ever changing, with various pretty
embroidery ones or someother type of needle working. The top throw over
bed covering is always a patchwork quilt, which is also forever changing
as well, we have loads of quilts about the place, all Irish ones dating
late 1870s to around the turn of the century. One have even been featured
in a book on Irish patch working. So all in all I don't mind a wee bit of
twee, just as long as it's in the appropriate place. :)

can still pick up the more common pieces quite cheaply to start a
collection and work your way up to the expensive pieces if you can
afford it. I've collected a lot of things in my life that had no great
value at the time, I started with bottle caps at six, then comic books
at eight, old trunks at ten and on it went, so I can't sneer at what
anyone here collects ,but I will tease you all a little if it gets some

pics,
&gt;and here's another thank you to all who post pictures.) Did
everyone
&gt;ever get the link to my own updated gallery? If so, it was ignored
or

Ronnie,

I come from Holland and I do know that they (&gt;nicely embroided &quot;antique&quot; bed
linen etc - not the plain stuff) do sell well here. There are people/dealers
here who specialize in this (and they get a lot of it from eastern Europe). A
pillow costs about NLG 15,00 (about 5 GBP?) a piece. (i think in holland we
have a culture for the &quot;worn&quot;...)
I do think it is important to &quot;help&quot; buyers see how nice it is - for example
by placing a lot of them (of the same colour) in a beautifull opened cubboard
- sets tied with a ribbon, sachets of Lavender inside so the smell
wonderfully and not at all old... my idea is that it is probably women who by
these kind of items and a lot of us like nice smells, ribbons etc.
What also might be an idea for you is sowing embroided ones on plain-ones,
and thus creating &quot;dekbedovertrekken&quot; (don't know the English word, the cover
for the blanket with feathers...)

greetings,

patricia

&gt;many of us are clueless. Nope, not even able to guess.

&gt;and we get to learn. Learn SO much. It's the whole reason to hang around

"/> I can view the number of hits anyone of the images receive that I load up

just two extremes.

Recently, I put up four scanned pages of the WMF marks, this was an
update to the L O N G drawn out discussion that a number of us had on
the WMF subject ... the scans received 12 visits, well only 12 to the
first image then reduced down to 5 for the rest of the pages, guess folk
couldn't be arsed in letting the images download, or had no interest in
the subject. Contrasting this, with a couple of pictures I put up during
the various discussions on &quot;this is my crap&quot; ... those images received
63 hits with only one or two not viewing all the images. On average, the
pictures I put up receive between 27-33 hits, most times I am not really
asking information like dating or what is this, and never asking a value,
merely for personal comments or views from the group. Seems the more
focused or specialist the subject and images the less hits they receive,
one would have assumed such images would receive more hits, but on the
whole this is not the case.

On average, with the images I put up, there's only really about 6-8
people than join in with serious input and attempt to widen the
discussion, and it's always the same 6-8 people each time, whether it's a
rubbish piece of a fine museum example, it's the same folk that input, at
least they are consistent.

I was totally amazed that the recent American objects I put up received
little or no discussion at all and not that many hits to the images, the
beautiful longcased American clock only received a handful of hits. I was
amazed because this ng has obviously a majority American readership, so
one would have assumed that American antiques (real antiques) may have
generated a few more comments from other folk rather than depending on
the usual suspects. It seems the best way to get discussion going is to
put &quot;crap&quot; in the title, post images of crap, or simply to talk or talk
about crap, or ask someone to look up their Godden's.

As another member remarked to me recently in an email .. 'one doesn't
actually have own the stuff in order to discuss it' which of course I
fully agree with. And one really doesn't have to know much or anything
about the subject or any of the answers to join in with some input, even
if the input is rather obvious to some of the rest of us, at least it
starts the ball rolling, and the old saying, if you don't ask you'll
never know.

I sincerely thank those handful of consistent contributors for their
input, comments and attempts at widening the discussion, and for the
images that they upload to the group in return. For without, these
handful of people, there wouldn't be much point at all and we would have
to simply depend on someone posting an ebay image of some piece of boring
old crockery to get our days fix.

Just observing. :)

&gt;wonderfully and not at all old.

"/> I agree with you Patricia. In my last shop which was much more geared
towards &quot;retail&quot; or at least towards the casual buyer, all the old linen
(after being cleaned and pressed) that I turned up was used in a
&quot;dressing&quot; manner throughout my shop. All arranged and displayed
tastefully by my wife ... but I still couldn't sell the stuff, or make
any real money out of it. In fact, sometimes (most times) it became a
real pain in the bum. My wife maybe spending half an evening dressing and
displaying a load of old linens that I may have bought in. Sure as hell,
the next day a couple of old hags would come, spend about half an hour
riffling through it all, leaving the place in a bloody mess and upsetting
all the nice display and at the end of it all, picking out some tea-cloth
with a £2.50 price tag on it and saying ... &quot;what's your best on this.&quot;

Maybe it's a case of coal to Newcastle (or hash or Amsterdam) :) One of
the major industries here (NI) from mid Victorian times right into the
early 1970s was flax and linen making, so it has always been reasonably
plentiful. Perhaps, when it starts disappearing or becoming harder to get
then the case may be different, right now, I personally can't be annoyed
trying to sell the stuff. I must admit, any good pieces I come by my wife
usually imprisons it for her (our) own use around the house. :)

Mike, You're right about me ,at least,
I know nothing about antiques but I do enjoy all the different pictures
that everyone shows. I collect(as Ronnie would say) shite. I love this
spelling
of a word that I use often. I can't
put any pictures up of my favorite
collection Indian artifacts that we find
on our farm but they are as beautiful
as the furniture,glass,quilts etc. that
are shared by all of you. For the time I'll have to keep all this beauty
to my self and the locals that come to see and touch them. I think this
is within the rules,none
are less than 50 yrs. old.
Thanks to all who post with or with out pictures and I do agree about
the off topics , but since I don't contibute I
shouldn't complain about those who do.
Thanks again. Doris

Snip of Ronnie's post:

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;I was totally amazed that the recent American objects I put up received
&gt;little or no discussion at all and not that many hits to the images, the
&gt;beautiful longcased American clock only received a handful of hits. I was
&gt;amazed because this ng has obviously a majority American
&gt;readership, so
&gt;one would have assumed that American antiques (real antiques) may have
&gt;generated a few more comments from other folk rather than depending on
&gt;he usual suspects. It seems the best way to get discussion going is to
&gt;put &quot;crap&quot; in the title, post images of crap, or simply to talk or talk
&gt;about crap, or ask someone to look up their Godden's.

"/> I, like Mike in Canada, do not have time to read everything in R.A. I would
be most grateful if we could come up with some codes for the title's like this:
PFD (photo for discussion) CYN (self explanitory) KAT (self explanitory
again)......you know...stuff like that. I'm afraid I missed most of these
pictures because I skimmed through and did not see a title that grabbed my
interest. Sometimes when I see about 30 posts I say AHA! a discussion!
And then read a bunch of one-liners that lead nowhere. Ah well.
So what do you think? PFD?
Thanks!

&gt;Oh right, sham ... seems so obvious now. The term &quot;redwork&quot; does that get
&gt;it's name just from the colour of the embroidery threads?? or what?

&gt;Ronnie
&gt;=====

"/> Here's more info than you asked for:

Outline work made an appearance (in America) about 1880. At this time
it was possible to purchase &quot;commenced goods&quot; which were embroideries
that had been designed and started by institutions such as the Royal
School and the Decorative Art Society. If left unfinished these would
resemble the later outline work. Such work was easy to master, and
the beauty of the finished article depended more on the design than
the worker's needlework skills. The designs of Kate Greenaway (a
British book illustrator) were very popular.

In the US, small blocks were given as premiums with some goods (such
as oatmeal, I think.) These would include patterns for days of the
week, months, dogs &amp; animals, flowers, birds, and of course
Greenaway's illustrations. These blocks most often were made into a
quilt. I have in my own collection (buried upstairs somewhere) a pile
of these blocks. Should I dig them out so you all can have a look?

Outline work also adorned other articles. Splashers (to be hung on
the wall behind your bowl and pitcher) would have scenes with water.
A carving tray mat will have a carving knife and fork. Hanky and
glove holders, napkin(serviette) holders, fork, knife and spoon
holders, would all be decorated according to their use. Towels would
have images of glass, china or silver, depending on which you were to
clean.

I don't know how or why the red became so all-popular. But someone
started it and it became *The Thing to Do*. Perhaps it had to do with
the improvements in dyes, and red became available and was an
immediate hit. Perhaps some manufacturer had an immense surplus of
red thread and created the fad. Outline work done in red is also
frequently called &quot;turkey work&quot; because the color was known as &quot;turkey
red.&quot; The one sham I have that is yellow rather than red is indeed a
rarity (at least in my area.) Imagine the Victorian woman who dared
to think outside the box and decide for herself that she didn't like
red, and wanted her sham yellow. It's a shame that one didn't
photograph well. The redwork craze lasted perhaps up to the 1920's,
with it's peak from about 1890-1910.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Go ahead and ask me a question about anything pictured there. If
&gt;&gt;&gt;there's any interest whatsoever.

&gt;&gt; Molly, do you collect these as well as sell them? or maybe ya don't
sell
&gt;&gt; them?

&gt;&gt; The one thing I can't sell is bed linen or bed clothing, or tea
cloths
&gt;&gt; and the like. Can just about manage the odd quilt or two, even
quilts are
&gt;&gt; slow with me, so most times I end up keeping the quilts. Maybe it
just
&gt;&gt; me, although, I don't know many dealers around my area that can sell
much
&gt;&gt; bed-linen or the like. During the summer time, if I get a few
American
&gt;&gt; tourist through the door they will buy small pieces of bed-linen,
pillow
&gt;&gt; cases, tea cloths and the like. But they never give me much for
them.

&gt;&gt; Most of my bed-linen and table and tea linens come via house
clearances
&gt;&gt; of large job lots, how the hell do ya bid someone on a pair of
pillow
&gt;&gt; cases or a single doily ... I usually shy away.

&gt;&gt; Anyways, those &quot;shams&quot; are very pretty. Out of curiosity what would
one
&gt;&gt; expect to pay for pair of these, on average. And why are they called
&gt;&gt; shams?

&gt;&gt; Maybe I should sell all my bed linen etc on ebay, easy shipping and
we
&gt;&gt; have obviously tons of it about in my neck of the woods. :)

I am not very familiar with Sylvac, but after seeing this example I
don't think I want to be either. The only piece I remember seeing was a
St. Bernard figurine (my collecting weakness), and it was a very poor
example of a Saint. The head made it look like it was crossed with a
collie. The ebay poster stated that it was not Beswick. No kidding.
From other Beswick examples I have seen, I don't think anyone would mix
up the two.
The dish you cited would not get much more than half a dollar at a
garage sale, IMO, and yet someone paid over $15 USD and shipping
besides. Takes all kinds.

I can't recall ever hearing a nursery rhyme about ants. The picture
looks more like a cartoon or one segment of a cartoon, sans captions.
The name looks like &quot;Mills&quot; or maybe &quot;hills&quot;.
btw I have looked at the picture two times, and will probably go back a
third time, so I hope this doesn't throw off your record keeping. :-).

Alrighty, I have fished up this photo from a very old book of French Fables.
Titled &quot;The cicada and the Ant&quot;. The fable is all about how the cicada was
busy singing all summer and when the northwind came along she ran to the ant
and asked for her to share with her so that she might make it through the
winter. The book is all in French and from what I can gather the ant didn't
have much sympathy for the cicada. This book is cool....and this is a
test of my camera's abilities....since the picture is only about 2 1/2 by 3
inches. But I noticed that the ant and cicada were clothed somewhat like your
watercolor ones.
Could it be French?

Also, note that all of the creatures are six-limbed. I thought at first
they were bees, but I'm convinced now they're ants. Whatever they are
the watercolor is just pleasant to look at, IMO.

"/> Mike,
Here's one of my favorite sites on antique tractors and gas engines:

http://members.tripod.com/Rumelypull/Rumely.html

It's got some fantastic links to more antique engine and tractors
than I've found to date, so far.
Be sure and take a look at the 1910 40-80 Minneaopolis tractor and the
2hp side shaft engine, which is pretty unique.
The weight of some of the Rumely's on the spec page are incredible.
I'ts no wonder these things are still intact and still operating!

&gt;&gt;Hi Terri, I looked at a 1920's walk behind type cultivator this week,
&gt;&gt;with a twin cylinder gas engine and steel wheels, runs like a top to. I
&gt;&gt;don't have the specs at this time or the manufacturer but I can get
&gt;&gt;them.

&gt; Now you guys are talkin'! Screw the fine wood and carnival glass --

Well, I don't know that I'd go so far as to do away with fine wood
as I love the stuff!
But I gave Mike a link on antique tractors and old gas engines
that's pretty interesting.

We have an annual antique tractor pull in a little town about
20 miles from us, called Greenleaf. They've got an incredible
collection of perfectly running steam, kerosene and gas tractors,
water wagons and plows. All sorts of antique implements from
all the over the area show up and are put on display, too.
We go every year. I am always impressed with the workmanship
that went into these old machines back then!

When I first met my husband, he had an old flywheel tractor
that was &quot;interesting&quot; to start.
(The hydraulic hose broke once, wrapped around the cowling
and almost took his leg off once, too).

I never have learned the knack of driving the D4.
It's all levers and pedals for steering and I'm afraid
I'd take out the house or orchard someday.
:)
I stick to the Kubota. That_, I can handle. And even if
I did hit the house, it's small enough that I'd just dent
it and not make a new entrance.

&gt; Mike,
&gt; Here's one of my favorite sites on antique tractors and gas engines:

&gt; http://members.tripod.com/Rumelypull/Rumely.html

&gt; It's got some fantastic links to more antique engine and tractors
&gt; than I've found to date, so far.
&gt; Be sure and take a look at the 1910 40-80 Minneaopolis tractor and the
&gt; 2hp side shaft engine, which is pretty unique.
&gt; The weight of some of the Rumely's on the spec page are incredible.
&gt; I'ts no wonder these things are still intact and still operating!
&gt; Terri

"/> Thanks for the Url Terri, my buddy who owns the cultivator has been
looking for some sites, but he just got on line this week for the first
time and needs all the help he can get.

Well, I'm excited, because one of the things I got with the new house
that we bought in Pennsylvania is a very old ... something-or-other.
It's in the barn, and it looks to be from maybe 1915, and it is at
first glance a car. But then it looks, too, like a car that somebody
once made into a tractor. Really hard to tell, because I've only
caught a glimpse of it in the dark and under a lot of bat guano (ugh).
I'll talk about it more when I have a chance to find out what it
really is.

Mike, don't know if this is the one you mean, but I thought it was
cool the first time I saw the picture (from a big red and gold book --
sure to be a best-seller -- called &quot;150 Years of International
Harvester&quot;). The book doesn't say, but I believe the year was c.1930.

Go to:

http://www.mindspring.com/~carguy323/tractor.jpg

But whatever it is over there in my new 100-year-old barn doesn't have
a cab. My son and our friend, Christoph, were going to investigate on
their way home from the big automotive flea market in Hershey. I'll
know more tonight.

Okay, gang. For those who are hanging on every word and dying to know
what is in the barn, it is .... (sound of drums here) .... a 1917
Chevrolet. Unfortunately, it was not made into a tractor; it was
converted to a stationary powerplant, and whoever did it removed the
rear end and cut the frame. Arghhh!!!!!!

So what I have is sort of half a car, although the engine and
transmission appear to be just fine, and there are the four wheels and
windshield and dashboard and original wooden steering wheel.
Obviously, this is going to take a whale of a lot of work and money to
make whole, should I decide to do it. But it's pretty exciting
anyway. First time I ever actually found an ancient car in a barn!

"/> Marshall,

Ah the old car /powerplant conversion, my uncle's inlaw's had a Model A
in the shed hooked up to a generator. They used this powerplant for over
thirty years until hydro finally ran lines back their way in the 1960's.
By the way,
you'll have to be careful now Marshall, you're no longer a virgin (
found your first car in the barn)and now fair game for Cyn ;~))

&gt;&gt;Good day Marshall, there was a company in the US that made a Tractor/car
&gt;&gt;(late twenties early 30's), it had a cab that was totally enclosed, full
&gt;&gt;fenders and the whole bit, a sort of a tractor you could drive to town.
&gt;&gt;I saw it when looking about the web under the search heading &quot; Antique
&gt;&gt;Tractors&quot;, but I didn't book mark the site.

&gt;Marshall,

&gt;Ah the old car /powerplant conversion, my uncle's inlaw's had a Model A

&gt;&gt;Go ahead and ask me a question about anything pictured there. If
&gt;&gt;there's any interest whatsoever.

&gt;Molly, do you collect these as well as sell them? or maybe ya don't sell
&gt;them?

&gt;The one thing I can't sell is bed linen or bed clothing, or tea cloths
&gt;and the like. Can just about manage the odd quilt or two, even quilts are
&gt;slow with me, so most times I end up keeping the quilts. Maybe it just
&gt;me, although, I don't know many dealers around my area that can sell much
&gt;bed-linen or the like. During the summer time, if I get a few American
&gt;tourist through the door they will buy small pieces of bed-linen, pillow
&gt;cases, tea cloths and the like. But they never give me much for them.

&gt;Most of my bed-linen and table and tea linens come via house clearances
&gt;of large job lots, how the hell do ya bid someone on a pair of pillow
&gt;cases or a single doily ... I usually shy away.

&gt;Anyways, those &quot;shams&quot; are very pretty. Out of curiosity what would one
&gt;expect to pay for pair of these, on average. And why are they called
&gt;shams?

&gt;Maybe I should sell all my bed linen etc on ebay, easy shipping and we
&gt;have obviously tons of it about in my neck of the woods. :)

Fayette,

I agree with you. On the other hand, there are things that only men are
interested in. Monday at the flea market I attend I saw half a dozen men
crowded around a table as the dealer was setting up. When I was able to inch
my way up to see what was generating all the excitement I saw all manner of old
tools. &quot;Testosterone stuff&quot; I call it and I went on my merry way. Had it been
linens, I would have gotten excited.

Ashley

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;As is sometimes
&gt;the case...I have come up with more words. And btw don't you think
&gt;somethink like D R O O L !!!!! should be against the rules, too?

&gt;But then...we can make allowances for Mensa members, I suppose.
&gt; Okey, about the linens. It seems to me that linens are a uniquely
&gt;feminine thing. And I am one of those people who *hates* making that
&gt;distinction. But lets admit it...there are some things that men gravitate
&gt;towards and some things that women gravitate towards. This is not
&gt;exclusively
&gt;so....but generally so.
&gt; The dealers I know who are interested in very fine linens are women.
&gt;Perhaps this is because much of the hand work done on antique linens was done
&gt;by women (sort of a retrospective empathy?). I know, I know....many fine
&gt;tailors and designers were/are men. But still....
&gt; I sell linens....they usually require a great deal of washing, ironing,
&gt;and sometimes repair. They are steady sellers and I make good profit on
&gt;them.
&gt; I have a hard time imagining you or T. or Filthy Rich spending many hours in
&gt;your day ironing and washing linens. Again, I am stereotyping and would be
&gt;happy for someone to point out my error.
&gt; Every table deserves an exquisite tablecloth to set off the silver and
&gt;china and glass that has been so carefully collected. Every lovely bed
&gt;deserves handpicked pillow shams, embroidered sheets, lace trims....don't you
&gt;think?
&gt;Maybe it is too fussy for men to deal with....but it contributes the extra
&gt;special touch to a home that is sometimes overlooked.
&gt; That is my opinion.

I once pissed off some lady who overheard me talking in
an antique mall. You know, I was just shooting my mouth off
and that I have an opinion about every goddam thing,
even things I don't know anything about. ;)
What I said was that you could tell the difference between
the booths that were owned by men and the booths that
were owned by women.
Of course, I was wrong, you can't tell all the time.
But you can tell often enough for it not to have been
a completely stupid thing to say.
A booth full of lace and ladies old hats and jewelry?
Could be some guy who has a bad fetish for that stuff,
but the odds are it's a lady.
But there is a lady I see at all the sales who collects
fishing stuff. So, who knows?

So, I am willing to concede that there are some men who like textiles and some
women who like tools. But for the most part, T is right and you can generally
tell the sex of the booth by what you find in it. And I do admire you ladies
who know what to do with a wood chisel. As for me, I love to paint but
anything that can't be fixed with the heel of a shoe or a butter knife gets
replaced.

I inspect the car when it makes funny noises AND I kill the bugs. I'm
the senior systems analyst, I reconfigure the stereo systems and fix the

sealed a leaky gasket on our garbage disposal. Oh, and I've dismantled

S.O. cooks dinner. Well, actually, we take turns. He mats and frames our
artwork, and even hangs them. He cleans the kitchen and organizes our

don't do electricity or ladders).

Are we weird or what?

"/> Lorena dear,
Whilst your solution was....ahem.....cutting edge, I must bemoan the fact
that you are from the &quot;throw it away&quot; generation. Certainly if you had
listened more closely to your Grandmother, you would have learned that
preserving &quot;pickles&quot; in vinegar, makes the little dickens &quot;last&quot; far
longer.....plus you have the pride of accomplishment when you sit that
trophy jar of &quot;preserves&quot; upon your mantle...

p.s. I have ginsu knives and I ain't afraid to use em'
