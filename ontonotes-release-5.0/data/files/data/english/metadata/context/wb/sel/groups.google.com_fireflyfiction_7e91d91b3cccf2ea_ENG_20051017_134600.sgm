The Snake in the Apple Tree by belasera A vague disclaimer is nobody's friend:
All recognizable characters, etc. belong not to me, but to Joss Whedon, Mutant
Enemy, and Fox, and no money is being made here. The story, however, is mine. A
sequel to the Apples series, Kaylee knows...something. A post-coital story of
tension told from the wrong point of view, with a dirty little twist near the
end... PG-13

Kaylee saw. She didn't know what she saw, but she saw it alright.

The strangeness started with breakfast. Wasn't nothin' she'd ever thought of
much, but Jayne was always in the dining room before anyone, makin' a racket
along with his breakfast.

&quot;Man food,&quot; he always said, lots of protein, lots of whatever he could get his
hands on. Kaylee found him there before her, most every morn, bein' an early
riser her own self gave the two of them a chance to be affable, `out anyone
else around tensin' things up. She always figured he woke up real hungry, but
the more she got to know more she thought he liked havin' a little space to
himself, first thing in the day. Jayne took up a lot of space, but he always
made room for Kaylee. Always seemed to shrink a bit when the others showed up,
sleepy eyed and hungry, bringin' in noise and warmth, and everything that made
Serenity home. The others would find Jayne and Kaylee half way to done, and
coffee ready and not near all drunk. It was good to have Jayne there with her,
stretching his legs under the table and eating off her plate when she'd let
him, his company lettin' her pretend she wasn't waitin' there for Simon.

So she tried not to take it personal when he stopped bein' there. Or rather,
when he started bein' there earlier and earlier. There'd be nothin' but a damp
ring on the table left by his cup those days. Kaylee couldn't help but think
maybe it was her, maybe he got up earlier now to be by his lonesome. T'was a
man's right, of course, to eat breakfast alone if he wanted, but it made her
mornings less cheery somehow, waiting for Simon there on her own felt a lot
more like waiting for somethin' that wasn't gonna come.

But it didn't stop with breakfast, and even though his mornin' company was
missing, Jayne still came and sat with her now and again in the engine room,
fiddlin' and teasing in his crass way that she hardly ever minded. Maybe it
wasn't her so much, then. He started eating quicker at dinner, trading chores
with Shepard Book to get out of dishes, stomping off to his bunk while the
others were still taking seconds. Cap'n threw him a glare or two, but Jayne'd
never brought much that was good to the dinner table anyway, so no one seemed
sorry to see him go. Simon in particular seemed relieved, more than was normal,
like someone just lifted an anvil of his chest and he could breathe and talk
again, every time Jayne walked out the room.

Kaylee saw, she wasn't sure what she was seein', but she saw alright.

Then Simon told everyone that River was in need of more quiet, that they'd take
their meals in their rooms for a spell, and Kaylee saw that River rolled her
eyes at that. They stopped comin' to meals and it was about that time that
Jayne started coming back. Somethin' wasn't right, and it was Kaylees's
favorite thing goin' wrong, mealtime, together time. She didn't ever say it but
she considered it family time. And Jayne had done something bad to it, made it
all odd.

The oddity had been goin' on `bout two weeks when Jayne came to Kaylee in the
engine room, a roll of bandages in his bleeding hand. Asked her to help him
patch up, didn't look her in the eye when he did.

&quot;Jayne, I don't mind none but you should have Simon do this for you.&quot;

&quot;Its nothin' but a cut, I just can't get the bandage on right is all.&quot;

&quot;But it could be...&quot;

&quot;Damn it, girl, you gonna help me or we gonna wag tongues about the humpin' doc
all day?&quot;

She'd wound his hand up with an impatient scowl, only glancing briefly at his
face, lookin' away again when she saw the pink flush creepin' up his throat.

Kaylee saw. She didn't like what she saw, but she saw alright.

Maybe they'd fought, it seemed most likely but it wasn't that thought that
twisted a knife in her belly. Maybe it was nothin' though, maybe she was goin'
all addlepated bein' on the ship for weeks without nothin' new. No one else
seemed bothered, wasn't no rule `bout them all eatin' together, after all. But
then it was more than just that, when they finally did get off the boat Jayne
got himself shot right quick in a bar and Cap'n went hollarin about Jayne's
head bein' ten moons away from the job. Simon stitched him up with a closed
expression and Jayne didn't look once at him. Kaylee knew this because she
watched. Under pretense of kind concern, she held Jayne's hand while that
bullet got dug out of his shoulder, and he didn't seem to mind her hand too
much, even surprised her by squeezing a bit. So she knew.

It was somethin' hard to see, it hurt to see it, but there it was. It was as if
she'd known the sky was blue her whole life without ever seein' what blue was.
And when she did see it, it couldn't be denied. Jayne and Simon were blue,
Jayne and Simon were blue sparks every time the other was near. Kaylee saw it
for sure, there in the infirmary. That tension she'd felt for weeks wasn't
`bout her in any way and it wasn't about no fight. It was `bout sex. She felt
stupid as a damn cow when she saw it there, watchin' Simon stitch him up,
feelin' Jayne squeeze her hand probably out of frustration more'n pain, felt
like she'd had pie for eyes when she thought `bout how she'd been with Simon,
how she'd thought she had with him what she saw in that room.

Must've gone bad, though. Well, how could it not, two o' them? Simon livin'
life like a block of ice, and Jayne...it wasn't to be believed, that he would
be anything near human `bout sex. Kaylee found it easy to think of them with no
little meanness. She left the infirmary not carin' how Jayne's shoulder healed,
not carin' `bout anything bad he might have done to Simon. She nearly made it
to her hammock before she started to cry, before she started nearly hating them
both. It ached to know Simon might want Jayne over her, and there was even
enough ache left over for the thought that Jayne might want Simon over her,
too.

Kaylee couldn't believe no one saw it, not even Inara. She would of thought
she'd gone `round the bend, weren't they so obvious about things. For a while
after the gunfight things were the same, one'd walk into a room and the other'd
walk out. Then it got to be something more, when they settled back into both
eating at the same table. They glared secret, gazed even more so. Simon seemed
to fold in on himself and Jayne twitched near constantly. It was absurd. One
night, out o' the blue, Jayne slammed back his chair and snarled at the doctor
to &quot;Cut it the hell out.&quot; Simon held his own, looked back at Jayne like steel
while the others gaped.

&quot;There a problem here?&quot;

Mal asked in his law-layin Captain voice, but Simon and Jayne answered in
unison. &quot;No.&quot;

Kaylee was relieved to no longer be the only one knowin' something was wrong,
but she dreaded the others knowing just what it was. S'long as it was only her
that knowed, wasn't quite a fact yet, but it was getting harder and harder to
convince herself she might even be wrong `bout the two o' them. Then it was
damn near impossible.

She'd gone to see Simon, still couldn't resist bein' near him some o' the time,
but then she saw that maybe she wasn't the only one. She saw them before they
could see her, Jayne standing in front of Simon, she could only see his back
but he was leaning in, saying something close to Simon's ear and Simon was
looking at him in a way he'd never looked at Kaylee, like a man who might be
dyin' of hunger. He moved his head and seemed to disappear into Jayne's body as
Jayne pulled him close, one arm around Simon's waist as Jayne buried his face
in Simon's neck...

Kaylee had the sense to go, to just turn around before they saw her. She didn't
want to hear Simon's stuttering aplology, nor see Jayne smirk at her like he'd
won some gorramn game. She crossed paths with Mal going down the stairs as she
went up and she hurried past him with a strained &quot;Cap'n,&quot; hoping like hell he'd
catch them groping like teenagers in the infirmary. Jayne surely heard him
coming though, Kaylee heard their voices as she moved away and the Cap'n didn't
sound near peeved enough.

No one was gonna get spaced then. Kaylee sighed fitfully, tweaking Serenity's
engine hours later. She would be pretty content, she thought, to never leave
this room, no reason to. She had a hammock, and sure Shepard Book would bring
her some food and company. Maybe even Inara would come visit her. It could be
like a nunnery, maybe she'd even get somethin' to hide most her face. The Cap'n
might have words, though. Anyway, wasn't Book or `Nara she wanted to converse
with at this particular time. Kaylee threw down her wrench and gulped. Set her
face smooth best she could and walked out of the engine room, right to crew
quarters. Not to her own bunk, not yet.

His bunk was locked, but it was no trouble to override it and punch the hatch
open. She moved down the ladder before her floppin' stomach had time to follow
and punched the hatch shut again even as Jayne sat up in bed, gave a half shout
at her.

&quot;Hey! Ya wanna be knockin?&quot;

She didn't answer him, just barreled on ahead.

&quot;Jayne, I'm needin' to talk to you.&quot;

&quot;Now?&quot;

He was nervous, she could tell. It nearly choked her, the realization that he
knew why she was here. He got up out of his bed, stood up to face her and she
had to bite back tears as her anger was joined with the shame of feelin'
tricked, betrayed.

&quot;You knew how bad I wanted him.&quot;

He twisted his lips, but didn't answer.

&quot;Didn't you? You knew I wasn't just playin?&quot;

He nodded then, looked down at her and moved a bit closer.

&quot;I knew, but you never woulda got him, Kaylee&quot;

He moved a bit closer, like maybe he meant to give her a hug or some fung loh
shit. She stared at him hard a moment, and then his bunk was filled with the
crack of her hand on his face.

&quot;Gorramnit, Kaylee, I didn't do nothin' to you!&quot;

She was crying now, and ready for this ill notion of a fight to be over, but
words came pouring out her mouth unstoppable like the turnin' of a world.

&quot;Oh, you surely did somethin', Jayne Cobb, even knowin' how I felt for him.&quot;

Her voice wobbled but she didn't stop, just croaked out real small,

&quot;What did you do to him?&quot;

Jayne pushed at her, pushed her rough against his ladder and held her at arms
length, like she might go for him again. He spoke low, not angry just
tense,

&quot;You don't want to know nothin' about that, Kaylee.&quot;

She looked at him, horrified, knowin' his meaning, and it wasn't nothin' like
what she'd meant, but now he'd said it....her face was flushed and it matched
his, his eyes were tight on her and he looked...pained, somehow. She nodded,
spite came up from her belly horribly unfamiliar and left her chin at an angry
tilt.

&quot;I do, Jayne.&quot;

His breath left his mouth in a tight little huff as he shook his head at her.
Shook his head, but pressed into her, his body a clear threat.

&quot;You wanna know?&quot;

She didn't answer, though the answer was no, she didn't want...His voice was a
rasp, and more, it was edged with a honey she'd never heard from him as he
spoke in her ear.

&quot;You wanna know...was me started it, that what you want to know?&quot;

His hand was gripping one of her hips now, and she knew he wanted to tell her
things she didn't want to hear. Had his own reasons for doin' so, like maybe he
needed to hear it his owns self.

&quot;He kissed me, I let him kiss me, you wanna hear that?&quot;

She didn't of course, she choked on a sob when he said it but there was no
stopping now. Jayne pressed his cheek right against hers, his voice filled her
ear and she thought for a flash how Simon had looked in the infirmary. Thought
she probably looked something the same.

&quot;I gave him a hand job, like a two bit whore, and he came right away, like he
was dyin' of it.&quot;

Jayne was talking fast, his body pressing against hers for no sensible reason,
and wuo de ma! He was makin' the room spin as his fingers rubbed circles at her
hip.

&quot;I, we...&quot;

He drew breathe hard, she felt it against her face and she knew without it him
sayin' the rest, sweet Buddha she didn't need to hear it. He didn't say it,
just stilled, her tears drying on her face and his as he wrapped both arms
around her, and she thought of him and Simon, wrapped together in the infirmary
like two drowning men.

When Jayne moved a bit she thought she might breathe again, but before she
could hardly think to get out of his arms his mouth was crashing down on hers.
She gasped in surprise and he snaked his tongue into her mouth, the force of
his kiss pressing her head against the ladder until it hurt. She couldn't think
one single thought, and then one came to her.

(He kisses Simon like this. Just like this)

That little thought was like a live wire in her brain, it sent heat and lust
straight to her belly and she pulled Jayne closer, ran one knee up his thigh
and gasped when he ground his hips against her. He was hard and she was dizzy
from it.

(Just like this)

His lips were trailing down her neck, it took a moment for her to realize that
he wasn't kissing her there, that he was whispering against her skin.

&quot;Sorry. I'm sorry.&quot;

The room slipped back into focus, Kaylee looked down at his dark hair as his
shoulders heaved against her. She pushed him back gently, her arms shaking as
she did.

&quot;No, no, don't do this Jayne.&quot;

He yanked away from her fully, looked down at her and she couldn't help but
thinking he looked lost when he was only an inch's distance from her.

&quot;I'm sorry Kaylee, you never could have had him, but I didn't mean it to be
this way. I sure knew you wanted him, but I didn't know I...&quot;

He stopped, he couldn't say it, and Kaylee couldn't hate him for it, not when
they was both bangin' up enough on themselves without her addin' to it. She
could never take what Jayne was tryin' to offer her, even if she wanted it, she
didn't want it as payment for Simon.

&quot;Jayne, you don't owe me nothin' for it, and I won't hate you for him wanting
you back when he didn't want me. I don't know, and I don't want to,&quot; she
stressed, &quot;But you `d better straighten this out with him before you start
makin' other people offers o' sexin.&quot;

Jayne seemed to slump, but he smiled a bit at her words.

&quot;Aw, Kaylee, you're the sweetest little thing.&quot;

&quot;Not another word, Jayne, I'm skedaddlin' the hell out o' your bunk before we
make a mess of this whole damn ship.&quot;

She was true to her word, went up his ladder and ignored his hand on her hip,
shut herself tight in her bunk before she could remember the feel of Jayne's
mouth and change her mind. They hadn't meant to hurt her, neither of them, and
she wasn't one for revenge anyhow. And she didn't hardly envy the two of them
nohow, they had a ways to go before figuring out how to get what they wanted.
It would be interesting to watch, and maybe even a bit easier, not to be always
waitin' on Simon. Kaylee stripped off her overalls before opening the little
fridge she kept in her bunk. This thing wouldn't keep her down for long, and
she never was one for the nunnery. She grinned and pulled out one of Jayne's
apples she'd stolen weeks ago, kept hidden in the cyro chamber until today.
She'd meant to share them with Simon as a treat, but looking at the red perfect
fruit she was glad after all to have them all to herself.
