How much of a risk is it to buy used condenser mics over the internet,
for example off eBay? I'd be getting them for myself, as a learning
tool and hobby, not as a tool to make money, so I could be somewhat
tolerant of bad luck.

Any good alternatives to eBay? I guess I'd prefer something more
reliable, like what KEH does for photography equipment (the company
itself assesses item condition and handles the transactions).

Any thoughts/feelings appreciated.

There are a lot of mics that come through this group all the time. You might
want to list which mics you're looking for and see if someone here has it at
the price you're willing to pay for it. If you have doubts about any seller
on this group, you can make a separate posting and inquire about their
standing in the group and other people's experience with them. I also use
the PARIS newsgroup and there are always good mics passing through there
from very respectable sellers.

Every eBay transaction is a potential disaster, but a surprising
number work out OK. Of course there's always the advice to not buy
from anyone without a stellar feedback rating, but that's become
pretty insignificant these days. I'd get a commitment from the seller
that you can return it for a full refund (shipping at your expense of
course) if for any reason you're dissatisfied with it. Don't bid on
anything where the seller won't give you that concession. It means you
might pass up some great deals, but you won't get stuck either.

I'd look in the classified ads in your local newspaper, Craig's List,
local arts/music newspaper, ask at your local music store. Find a live
person who's selling the mic, pay him or her a visit, and try out the
mic. There are a lot of things that can be wrong with a mic andyou
won't know about them until you listen to it - and if you're not
familiar with the type of mic, you may not know there's something
wrong with it immediately anyway.

Since you're looking for something to learn on, I'd suggest that you
buy one or two brand new mics from a legitimate dealer. There are a
lot of decent mics that don't cost very much and you won't have to
worry about the seller or the product. eBay is a place where you can
find mics that you can't buy elsewhere (older models, discontinued
products, and so on) but you have to know what you're buying. In your
situation, I just don't see the point of taking a chance.

I've bought and sold a lot on ebay, and have had good success.  I do a
lot of research and ask the seller questions first.  The
recommendations above are all good.

When doing my research, I've often found that the difference in cost
between a new-vs-used mic is marginal (all things considered.  For
example, I'd rather pay $250 for a new mic versus $175 for a used one
that comes complete with a lot of empty promises and half-truths).
Used mics are the ticket, really, when you're looking for one that's
no longer made or the price is just too good to pass up and the seller
is reliable (that does happen from time to time).

The price of a decent, new condenser, however, is comparatively low
these days.  Take a look at mojo pie.  There are some useful reviews
there.  I started with a new AT3035, which cost me about $175 with a
well-made shock mount and it sounds pretty good.  I have a good
selection of decent mics now, and still use that AT3035 (mostly to mic
the beater side of my kick drum).  It's got a 10db pad on it and a
bass roll-off.

I even bought a MXL lg diaphragm condenser for $50 new, recapped it
with quality components (~$10 in WIMA caps and Nichicon electrolytics,
and about an half-hour's worth of work/soldering), and it sounds
pretty damn good (remarkably good, in fact).  I was just experimenting
based on some post in gearslutz or somewhere, and ended up with a mic
that's as good as any of my $500-$600 mics.  I was stunned, to say the
least.  Makes me want to try changing the transistors....

Even David Royer modified (heavily) an MXL mic and was pleased with
the result; so much so that (I was told) it became the basis for his
Mohave line of tube mics.  I recently saw that Telefunken released
some new mics with Chinese capsules, ones that have gotten very
positive reviews.  I think many of the lg. diaphragm Chinese capsules
are pretty decent rip off of old Neumann ones.  The way I look at it,
for a little money, some reading time and a little soldering, you
really can't go wrong.

Back to used mics: I've had bad luck with used MD421's.  I bought
three in a row that didn't have anywhere near the low-end response
they should have had.  Apparently, this is common to these mics.  I
saw somewhere that the diaphragm goes away over time (and abuse). I
don't know if that is true.  But, no matter, that has been my
experience.  And it has cost me.

I did buy a used ATM-25 for $6 that works perfectly.  And I bought a
couple of used AT4033's for about $300 that are also perfect.  You
never know.  At the end of the day, it's a crap shoot.

Good luck.

Steve

It depends what it is, and what you're paying.

For a $100 mike, I'd be willing to take a lot of chances that I wouldn't
take on a $10,000 mike.

There are plenty of brokers out there, like Mercenary Audio and Funky
Junk.  Not as many as there used to be, but they are there.

KEH is good folks.  I was really pissed off when they shut down their
counter operations and went to mail order only, because they always had
weird stuff to pick over in the store.

That's sounds like the great deal on a hammer that I got from
Home Depot.  I bought it for $6.00, then just replaced the head
and the handle with better quality parts, and the thing works
as well as a $30 hammer now. :)

Yes!  That's exactly what it's like.

I presume that the hammer you're referring to is the same one you've

My &quot;feelings&quot; are that it's a bad idea to buy a used mike.  If it's popular,
it's probably overpriced.  Buy a brand new, fully warranteed mike that's
well within your budget.

Definately a mixed bag.

My first eBay mic purchase some years back involved 3 MXL 603s. 2 of the 3
were dradfully noisy.  A trip back to MXL made them whole, and at no cost to
me other than for mailing them in. It's pretty obvious what happened - MXL
was in their infancy and having QC problems. The eBay sellers were getting
rid of their defective stock.

A year later I bought another pair of MXL 603 and they were just fine.

Later on I bought about 8 CAD 95s from various sellers, and 7 were just
fine. The 8th had an immense case of bar breath. Not too hard to deal with.

Later on I bought a number of Audix OM5s and OM6s. All but one were perfect.
In fact they mostly looked like NOS.  The odd one had quite a bit of
cosmetic damage, but refinished up fine.  I later found out that often Rat
Sound often sells these mics for prices that are well under eBay seller
prices.

Being tolerant and willing to take risks is a good state of mind to be in
when you're buying on eBay. But, thats often true no matter where you buy.

For example as bad as eBay is, my local Guitar Center has treated me at
least as badly. I've bought two items with missing or defective external
power supplies.  One I didn't discover until months after the purchase
because the item in question was bought to replace a unit that I use
infrequently. I had sold mine to a customer with an immediate need. I just
picked up a new one and put it into storage without inspecting it. My bad.

My latest Guitar Center folly related to some M-Audio Microtracks. The price
I negotiated at GC was very good, and my buddy did as well after I pointed
my good fortune out to him. But, both of the Microtracks we bought had way
downlevel firmware. The missing updates related to compatibility with
various brands and models of CF memory cards which quickly presented itself
as a go, no-go issue when we bought CF cards  from varous Local sources. The
upgrade was free, but it was not all that new.

Was GC cycling their old stock to avoid having to do the updates
theirselves? Do they even work at this level of technical competence and
customer care?  &quot;Never presume malevolence when a diagnosis of simple
incompetence will suffice.&quot;

As far as new items sold on eBay, it is not uncommon to be able to search
around and find the same product, sometimes from the same supplier, even
cheaper. One case of this that comes to mind is Bulbs America and their
various aliases. Not a bad retailer, BTW.  Also see my previous comment
about Rat Sound.

It makes sense to simply do your homework and search around before spending
your money. Then, you're still rolling the dice unless you have a really
good retailer who cares. I'll bet he's not the lowest cost source, unless
you count all the costs.

I sold my Pearl mics to someone in this group several years ago. One had
intermittent noise that I thought had gone away * -- and I _had_ checked
them before the sale -- but the buyer said one was noisy. Fortunately, he
wasn't _too_ upset (_I_ was probably more upset, because I don't want to
misrepresent what I sell, and I saw the sale evaporating), and we split the
repair costs.

I'd assume _any_ used condenser mic could have problems.

* Believe it or not, it was Jon Dahlquist who noted the noise when I loaned
him my mics ca. 1980. They were returned to Sweden for a checkout, and the
head of Pearl (now Milab) said there was nothing wrong with them. I'd never
gotten recordings _I_ considered noisy.

There was a warning on the Sennheiser site recently, and some posts here
I think, about counterfeit products on eBay. I tried to find the link to
the Sennheiser note but couldn't.
