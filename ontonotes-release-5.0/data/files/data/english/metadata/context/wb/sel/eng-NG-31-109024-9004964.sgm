What is 'sacred' - what is 'profane'.

Stale bread and cheap red wine are simply stale bread and cheap red wine,
boringly profane, until they are offered on the altar as the body &amp; blood of
Christ, and then they become sacred.

Tap water is tap water, until a priest waves his hands over it and says the
Right Words, and then its Holy Water. However, it would still slake the
thirst of someone who drank it, would still freeze at approximatley 0C and
boil at approximately 100C, and otherwise hasn't changed in any way.

The animal in that field is merely an organic milk factory to me, but is
considered sacred to Hindu.

A scroll with squiggles on it makes good kindling to nomad, and yet to
another it is the greatest archeological discovery in the Dead Sea area.

What is sacred, what is profane?

Context, that is what seperates the sacred from the profane, it is the
context in which we as individuals view the 'thing' in question, whether
that be an object, a ritual or even an idea. One person will see the 'thing'
as sacred, others will not, all depending on their own person view of the
world, and indeed, their own personal views about what is sacred andwhat is
profane.

I read carefully your opinion.

First, I note that you do not challenge my excerpt as Christian
Origins.
Why is that?  Do you perhaps agree that the excerpt is a true
explanation?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------

Because I am a Platonist, because the Essenes had a Platonic Theory,
because Jesus Christ was and is at least a symbolic priest for all
Christians - I propose an opinion that is contrary to yours.

I propose that sacred and profane are absolutes.  With all my heart
and strength I say the sacred is to be separated from the profane.

Peace out,
Dave

Dear Martin,

You never should have rushed into print on this point.

The ridiculous and the sublime
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/qumran_origin/message/5231

&quot;M. Hengel, J.H. Charlesworth and D. Mendels have made
the convincing point that the chapter on kingship
(11QT 56.12-59.21) contains polemic against an actual
Jewish king... [please read argument  to the end]&quot;

Géza Vermes, a noted authority on the Dead Sea Scrolls and other
ancient works in Aramaic has summed up the academic reaction to
Thiering's work in the following:

&quot;Professor Barbara Thiering's reinterpretation of the New Testament,
in which the married, divorced, and remarried Jesus, father of four,
becomes the &quot;Wicked Priest&quot; of the Dead Sea Scrolls, has made no
impact on learned opinion. Scroll scholars and New Testament experts
alike have found the basis of the new theory, Thiering's use of the so-
called &quot;pesher technique,&quot; without substance.&quot;

I would love to engage with NGers other than Yowie on why
modern Christians are not free to restore the Holy of Holies

&gt;&gt; Sure, seperate what *you* think is sacred and profane in *your* life but
&gt;&gt; don't expect other people to agree with your disticntions of 'sacred' and
&gt;&gt; 'profane' or even your choice to seperate or even how to seperate.

&gt; Not my problem because I am not doing any expecting --- this is a sign
&gt; of someone trained in Eastern Religion.

&gt; In addition, more and more my world is one of jazz and jazz lyrics,
&gt; that
&gt; someday I may perform on the piano like Diana Krall...

Face it: you'll never play alto like Charlie Parker on &quot;Autumn in New York&quot;.

&gt; &gt;&gt; There isn't any depth.  They are not uninteresting as an example of the

&gt; &gt; Dear Martin,

&gt; &gt; You never should have rushed into print on this point.

&gt; &gt; The ridiculous and the sublime
&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/qumran_origin/message/5231

&gt; &gt; &quot;M. Hengel, J.H. Charlesworth and D. Mendels have made
&gt; &gt; the convincing point that the chapter on kingship
&gt; &gt; (11QT 56.12-59.21) contains polemic against an actual
&gt; &gt; Jewish king... [please read argument  to the end]&quot;

&gt; &gt; Yours truly,
&gt; &gt; Dave

&gt; Interestingly, Eisenman thinks that the &quot;Paean to King Jonathan&quot; is
&gt; actually /to/ Alexander Jannaeus.  This one may be around for some time
&gt; yet.  Thanks for the link: I'm always up for this kind of stuff.

Dr. Thiering agrees with Dr. Eisenman -

For or against King Jonathan?
