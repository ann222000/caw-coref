The doctors were wrong.  Now they believe it has gone to his liver.  Also
mets in the other lung.  They are testing these to see if it's the same kind
of cancer that's in the other lung.  Surgery is no option.  We are
devastated.  There are no words to describe what we feel.  I can't let
myself think of his death.  I just can't....Love, Chris

I am sooo sorry to hear this. I pray he is able to see his dog and to enjoy
what time he has left.

I'm sorry, Chris.
It's hard to accept; hard for the news to sink in, I know .

Are more tests (results) outstanding?
I would want to know if it's gone to his brain and/or bones, as well.
(I haven't heard anything from you that indicates that it has gone to the
brain).

Has he asked about being seen by a radiation oncologist?
A radiation oncologist can help with bone pain.
Maybe shrink some lymph nodes or whatever might be pressing on a nerve causing
the trouble swallowing and talking; maybe even help with the breathing, by
shrinking some of the tumor or lymph nodes.  Someone would have to be there to
help him discuss what can be safely done (in the thoracic area) with RT.

See if anything can be done to help him in the interim, OK?
Hugs from me,
J

Thanks for the hugs.  I sure need them.  The scans are coming up next.
Today all Robert did was sleep.  But he has to sleep sitting up.  With that
roommate making so much noise, they got him a private room.  I couldn't go
today.  I didn't want to break down in front of him.  They are offering
chemo, but I believe it's only to relieve some of the painful symptoms.  All
of his family are here now.  This is just hell for us.  I will keep you
updated on what's going on with him.  I don't understand him sleeping so
much.  Is this a sign of dying?  When he first went into the hospital 11
days ago he slept normally.  Now it's all the time.  I guess if he has to
leave us I'd rather him do it in his sleep.  I don't want to watch him
suffer.  I certainly don't want to see him not being able to breathe.  His
biggest fear is smothering.  My heart is just broken today.  Love, Chris

Hello Chris,
We've been told by Mike R that morphine helps with what's called &quot;Air hunger&quot;,
by some.
(gasping for air)

I was preparing a longer (or different) reply, but after thinking about it all
and a walk, decided that if all his family's there, it's likely they've been
told he could imminently die.
Yes, advanced lung cancer patients sleep a lot; more so during the last few
weeks and then days.
The hearing continues, but may not respond at all times, due to being busy with
coming to terms, the processes going on in his body, hunger, memories, dreams,
hallucinations...the &quot;work of dying&quot;, but if you go, speak to him, close to his
ear. Hold his hand/fingers lightly. There might be a response to your voice,
like a raised eyebrow, opening his eyes, a finger or hand movement.  If so, tell
him what a good friend he's been for you; stay calm, say peaceful things, you'll
see him in a better place where there's no sadness or pain.  If you get choked
up and/or cry too much, excuse yourself and say &quot;I'll be back in a bit&quot;.

It's hard to know what's happening now; whether his family's discussing options
and whether they'll try chemo, or whether he'll be transferred to hospice care
or whether they'll decide to take him home to be with his fur-buddy (dog).
If you decide to go visit, call first, in case he's gone home or passed away.
&lt;or maybe you've received a text message from him&gt;   If he's still there, plan
on staying just a few minutes, then take your cues from the family members as to
how long to stay or whether they want alone time with him or some might want to
speak with you, outside his room (you being a pastor) and if you aren't capable,
without breaking down in tears, I'm sure they'll understand.

I'm sorry I can't help more.
We're just bystanders to what's happening; you and he and the family are on the
front lines.
My thoughts will be with you all.
J

Dear J,
The scans are finished with.  All we do now is wait.  He will text me every
now and then, but not much.  With the whole family here, from North Carolina
to Florida, that really worries me.  But I know I must accept whatever will
be.  All I want is for him to be with his dog when he leaves us.  He's
afraid of leaving the dog.  But we will all make sure the doggie is taken
care of.  Thanks so much for your care and concern...With love, Chris

&gt;&gt; &gt; front lines.
&gt;&gt; &gt; My thoughts will be with you all.
&gt;&gt; &gt; J

&gt;&gt; Dear J,
&gt;&gt; The scans are finished with.  All we do now is wait.  He will text me
&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt; now and then, but not much.  With the whole family here, from North
&gt;&gt; Carolina
&gt;&gt; to Florida, that really worries me.  But I know I must accept whatever
&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt; be.  All I want is for him to be with his dog when he leaves us.  He's
&gt;&gt; afraid of leaving the dog.  But we will all make sure the doggie is taken
&gt;&gt; care of.  Thanks so much for your care and concern...With love, Chris

&gt; It is a long weekend and the family just got bad news, that is
&gt; probably why the family is there. I hope you friend gets to go home an
&gt; spend some time with his dog, Alex
">

Thanks Alex, that's exactly what I want to happen.  He talks or whispers
about his dog constantly.  It's a large schnauzer dog.  If he were small I'd
hide him in my purse.  My husband went to visit him tonight and said he kept
falling asleep while he was talking to him.  I know that is a bad sign.  Can
anyone tell me why they are collecting his spit in a bottle?  They say they
want to test it.  I've never heard of this before.  This has taken a toll on
me, with this and my father.  Please know I'm not complaining at all.  I
just have some swollen glands in my neck that are very painful, and I have a
fever now.  I know I've been pushing myself too hard.  But I'd rather me go
down than him or my dad.  My dad's next treatment is around the 20th I
believe.  Then comes his scan to see if the chemo has done anything.  My dad
lost his little dog and it still bothers him.  I just wish I could do more!
I have to think of my girls.  I can't get sick because of them.  I have to
go to the doctor on the 10th.  I'm going to ask him for something to help me
sleep.  At night all I do is lay awake and think.  I just feel so physically
awful today.  I couldn't even preach today.  I hate letting people down.
But you know I want to look back on all of this with no regrets.  I truly
appreciate the support I get here.  You guys hold me up in the worst of
times.  I just want to say thank you and G-d bless you all.......Love, Chris

Hello Chris,
The sputum's evaluated at a lab for blood, infections, cancer cells, so I don't
know if they're searching to find out if he has 2 types of lung cancer or
looking for infection.
I know you're not complaining. It feels like the wheels are moving so slowly.
Do you usually get fever and lymph nodes swelling when tired or stressed?
I used to get a feeling of fever and sore throat.  I don't anymore.
I turn it all off and go to bed and that's what I did yesterday after a busy day
outdoors.
I couldn't keep my eyes open long enough to answer even one post.
I wish you could do that, chris, have a relaxing bath, a bite to eat, then &quot;turn
it all off&quot; and sleep.
Some people use melatonin for sleep; others a hot toddy. I think I've had some
of those as well.
It's Labor Day. Could your sister take over while you &quot;crash&quot; and sleep?
J

Hi Chris,

Reading your last post where you mentioned you could't sleep, had swollen
glands, and mentioned the many responsibilities in the current crises you
have to father, friend, daughters ...

I feel more concerned about your state and health.

I know that it may be part of your &quot;religious vocation&quot; to serve selflessly,
but I feel saying to you : &quot;please, take care of yourself, don't let
yourself get worn down by trying to do much for too many people.&quot;

I feel a bit uncomfortable saying this; maybe it will feel &quot;patronizing&quot; to
you :  I hope not.

It's just my way of expressing my concern for you.

best, Uncle Sally

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; next.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Today all Robert did was sleep.  But he has to sleep sitting up.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; With
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; roommate making so much noise, they got him a private room.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; couldn't
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; go
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; today.  I didn't want to break down in front of him.  They are
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; offering
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; chemo, but I believe it's only to relieve some of the painful
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; symptoms.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; All
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of his family are here now.  This is just hell for us.  I will keep
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; updated on what's going on with him.  I don't understand him sleeping
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; so
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; much.  Is this a sign of dying?  When he first went into the hospital
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; 11
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; days ago he slept normally.  Now it's all the time.  I guess if he
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leave us I'd rather him do it in his sleep.  I don't want to watch
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; him
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suffer.  I certainly don't want to see him not being able to breathe.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; His
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; biggest fear is smothering.  My heart is just broken today.  Love,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Chris

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello Chris,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We've been told by Mike R that morphine helps with what's called &quot;Air
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hunger&quot;,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; by some.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (gasping for air)

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I was preparing a longer (or different) reply, but after thinking
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; about it
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; all
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and a walk, decided that if all his family's there, it's likely
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; they've
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; been
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; told he could imminently die.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, advanced lung cancer patients sleep a lot; more so during the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; last
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; few
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; weeks and then days.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The hearing continues, but may not respond at all times, due to being
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; busy
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; coming to terms, the processes going on in his body, hunger, memories,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; dreams,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hallucinations...the &quot;work of dying&quot;, but if you go, speak to him,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; close
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to his
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ear. Hold his hand/fingers lightly. There might be a response to your
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; voice,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; like a raised eyebrow, opening his eyes, a finger or hand movement.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; so, tell
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; him what a good friend he's been for you; stay calm, say peaceful
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; things,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; you'll
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; see him in a better place where there's no sadness or pain.  If you
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; get
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; choked
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; up and/or cry too much, excuse yourself and say &quot;I'll be back in a
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; bit&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It's hard to know what's happening now; whether his family's
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; discussing
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; options
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and whether they'll try chemo, or whether he'll be transferred to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hospice
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; care
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; or whether they'll decide to take him home to be with his fur-buddy
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (dog).
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If you decide to go visit, call first, in case he's gone home or
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; passed
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; away.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;or maybe you've received a text message from him&gt;   If he's still
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; there,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; plan
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; on staying just a few minutes, then take your cues from the family
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; members
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; as to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; how long to stay or whether they want alone time with him or some
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; might
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; want to
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; speak with you, outside his room (you being a pastor) and if you
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; aren't
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; capable,
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; without breaking down in tears, I'm sure they'll understand.

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm sorry I can't help more.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We're just bystanders to what's happening; you and he and the family
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; on the
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; front lines.
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; My thoughts will be with you all.

Don't you worry about anything.  I'm never insulted by anything you write.
I draw strength from you.  I know you care about me.  I'm very sick today.
I just have to stop for a while.  I'm too sick to see my friend who is on
chemo.  If I have a virus, I can't take the chance of being around him and
him getting sick.  I'm confined to the bed.  My oldest daughter is taking
care of me.  She's loaded the dishwasher, and fixed her dad some soup.  She
brings me orange juice and takes my temperature.  To my complete delight,
she also wants to be a minister.  I told her she would have to earn a degree
in college first, so she has something to fall back on.  She will do fine.
Thanks Uncle, for your well wishes and your concern.  You mean the world to
me!   Love, Chris

thing I want to do for him.  Thanks Alex, for being here for me.  Love,

&gt; some
&gt; of those as well.
&gt; It's Labor Day. Could your sister take over while you &quot;crash&quot; and sleep?
&gt; J

All I can think of is WOW you really do know your stuff!  His brother called
this morning and the nurse told him they were checking his saliva to see if
it's 2 different kinds of cancers.  All I could think of is how wise you
are.  You are a tremendous help to me and others.  Robert does have a
picture of his dog next to his bed.  Sometimes I will catch him looking at
it and crying.  He thinks he won't ever leave the hospital.  I texted him
today, and got no reply.  I can't go see him, because I am so sick.  I don't
know when I've ever felt so bad.  Yes my throat is very sore.  The glands
are so painful.  I'm taking ibuprofen for the pain.  I found that I have a
new gland that's swollen today.  It's right under my chin, and boy does it
hurt.  My husband will take over staying with Robert during the day.  I have
to stay in bed.  If I get up, I feel really sick.  Plus I have a fever, and
the air conditioning on here is killing me.  I'm stacked up with blankets
trying to keep warm.
And yes I do get my glands swollen and painful when I've done too much.  But
I have to be well for my dad.  He's already into chemo now, and I can't be
sick around him.  If I am, my sister will have to take him to his next
treatment.  So I'm laying in bed, reading my Bible and hoping the fever will
break.
Thanks again J, you're the greatest!   Love, Chris

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks for the hugs.  I sure need them.  The scans are coming up
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; next.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Today all Robert did was sleep.  But he has to sleep sitting up.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; With
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; roommate making so much noise, they got him a private room.  I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; couldn't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; go
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; today.  I didn't want to break down in front of him.  They are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; offering
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; chemo, but I believe it's only to relieve some of the painful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; symptoms.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; All
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of his family are here now.  This is just hell for us.  I will keep
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; updated on what's going on with him.  I don't understand him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sleeping so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; much.  Is this a sign of dying?  When he first went into the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hospital 11
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; days ago he slept normally.  Now it's all the time.  I guess if he
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leave us I'd rather him do it in his sleep.  I don't want to watch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; him
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suffer.  I certainly don't want to see him not being able to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; breathe.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; His
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; biggest fear is smothering.  My heart is just broken today.  Love,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Chris

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello Chris,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We've been told by Mike R that morphine helps with what's called &quot;Air
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hunger&quot;,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; by some.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (gasping for air)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I was preparing a longer (or different) reply, but after thinking
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; about it
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; all
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and a walk, decided that if all his family's there, it's likely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; they've
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; been
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; told he could imminently die.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, advanced lung cancer patients sleep a lot; more so during the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; last
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; few
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; weeks and then days.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The hearing continues, but may not respond at all times, due to being
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; busy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; with
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; coming to terms, the processes going on in his body, hunger,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; memories,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; dreams,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hallucinations...the &quot;work of dying&quot;, but if you go, speak to him,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; close
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to his
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ear. Hold his hand/fingers lightly. There might be a response to your
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; voice,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; like a raised eyebrow, opening his eyes, a finger or hand movement.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; so, tell
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; him what a good friend he's been for you; stay calm, say peaceful
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; things,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; you'll
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; see him in a better place where there's no sadness or pain.  If you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; get
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; choked
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; up and/or cry too much, excuse yourself and say &quot;I'll be back in a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; bit&quot;.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; It's hard to know what's happening now; whether his family's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; discussing
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; options
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and whether they'll try chemo, or whether he'll be transferred to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; hospice
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; care
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; or whether they'll decide to take him home to be with his fur-buddy
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (dog).
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If you decide to go visit, call first, in case he's gone home or
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; passed
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; away.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;or maybe you've received a text message from him&gt;   If he's still
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; there,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; plan
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; on staying just a few minutes, then take your cues from the family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; members
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; as to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; how long to stay or whether they want alone time with him or some
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; might
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; want to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; speak with you, outside his room (you being a pastor) and if you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; aren't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; capable,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; without breaking down in tears, I'm sure they'll understand.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm sorry I can't help more.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; We're just bystanders to what's happening; you and he and the family
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; are
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; front lines.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; My thoughts will be with you all.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; J

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear J,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The scans are finished with.  All we do now is wait.  He will text me
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; every
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; now and then, but not much.  With the whole family here, from North
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Carolina
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to Florida, that really worries me.  But I know I must accept whatever
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be.  All I want is for him to be with his dog when he leaves us.  He's
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; afraid of leaving the dog.  But we will all make sure the doggie is
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; taken
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; care of.  Thanks so much for your care and concern...With love, Chris

&gt;&gt;&gt; It is a long weekend and the family just got bad news, that is
&gt;&gt;&gt; probably why the family is there. I hope you friend gets to go home an
&gt;&gt;&gt; spend some time with his dog, Alex

&gt;&gt; Thanks Alex, that's exactly what I want to happen.  He talks or whispers
&gt;&gt; about his dog constantly.  It's a large schnauzer dog.  If he were small
&gt;&gt; I'd hide him in my purse.  My husband went to visit him tonight and said
&gt;&gt; he kept falling asleep while he was talking to him.  I know that is a bad
&gt;&gt; sign.  Can anyone tell me why they are collecting his spit in a bottle?
&gt;&gt; They say they want to test it.  I've never heard of this before.  This
&gt;&gt; has taken a toll on me, with this and my father.  Please know I'm not
&gt;&gt; complaining at all.  I just have some swollen glands in my neck that are
&gt;&gt; very painful, and I have a fever now.  I know I've been pushing myself
&gt;&gt; too hard.  But I'd rather me go down than him or my dad.  My dad's next
&gt;&gt; treatment is around the 20th I believe.  Then comes his scan to see if
&gt;&gt; the chemo has done anything.  My dad lost his little dog and it still
&gt;&gt; bothers him.  I just wish I could do more! I have to think of my girls.
&gt;&gt; I can't get sick because of them.  I have to go to the doctor on the
&gt;&gt; 10th.  I'm going to ask him for something to help me sleep.  At night all
&gt;&gt; I do is lay awake and think.  I just feel so physically awful today.  I
&gt;&gt; couldn't even preach today.  I hate letting people down. But you know I
&gt;&gt; want to look back on all of this with no regrets.  I truly appreciate the
&gt;&gt; support I get here.  You guys hold me up in the worst of times.  I just
&gt;&gt; want to say thank you and G-d bless you all.......Love, Chris
">

Thank you Gail.  I know you're pulling for me and that means so much!  Thank
you so much for thinking of me.  I hope to write more about my condition as
it happens, and also keep everyone informed about Robert.  Love to you,
Chris

&gt;&gt;&gt; The doctors were wrong.  Now they believe it has gone to his liver.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Also
&gt;&gt;&gt; mets in the other lung.  They are testing these to see if it's the same
&gt;&gt;&gt; kind
&gt;&gt;&gt; of cancer that's in the other lung.  Surgery is no option.  We are
&gt;&gt;&gt; devastated.  There are no words to describe what we feel.  I can't let
&gt;&gt;&gt; myself think of his death.  I just can't....Love, Chris

&gt; Leave me the hell alone.
