Hey all! I am a new member to the group. I am working on doing some
home recording for an album, but the room I record in is very small
and I get a boxy sound every time I record. Any suggestions on some
cheap soundproofing methods? I have looked at soundproof foam, but
that is pretty expensive. Someone suggested egg cartons to me. Does
anyone else have any suggestions? I appreciate any input!

So why record in *that* room?  Try some other rooms in your
place (even hallways, etc.) and see if any of them sound better.

Sound treatment is frequently discussed here. You could
look up &quot;acoustic&quot; and similar keywords in Google Groups
and have enough reading to keep you busy for a month.
Don't be surprised to find others recommending using other
rooms rather than trying to &quot;fix&quot; a small, boxy room.

First, let's get the terms straight: &quot;soundproofing&quot; means the process of
(or materials for) keeping sound from traveling through the walls of a room,
either inbound (interfering street noises) or outbound (bothering the
neighbors). What you're after is &quot;sound treatment&quot; -- &quot;absorption&quot; or
&quot;diffusion&quot; -- to try to ameliorate the bad sound of the room.

Second, egg cartons don't work. There's an urban legend that they do,
because they visually resemble real acoustic foam, but they have little or
no effect on sound.

Third, probably the cheapest practical sound absorbing material is 6&quot; (R19)
fiberglass. It's nasty to work with, but it can help -- sometimes.

Okay, those prelims out of the way, let's do some real stuff. What are the
dimensions of your small room -- height, width and length? And what
instruments are you recording?

Peace,
Paul

Yeah, I realized once I said sound proofing and actually did some
research on it that what I really meant was reducing the echo, thanks
for that. I know that the room I'm in isn't ideal, but I don't have a
lot of choice when it comes to location. I am just doing some basic,
single instrument with vocal recordings, usually guitar. I am using an
Mbox, so I can record two inputs at once. I've been trying a DI and
mic set up with the guitar recording, which is where I'm getting the
boxy sound from. The room I'm in is probably about 10x10 and 8 or 9
feet tall. I've heard that you shouldn't touch fiberglass, that it can
cut your or something. Where could I even buy that?

Firstly, tell the person who suggested egg cartons that they have
recommended one of the biggest bottles of snake oil going.  Egg cartons
bordering on the useless.
Secondly, &quot;soundproofing&quot; is the name that describes lowering the
transmission of sound through a boundary (e.g. walls or ceiling etc).
The word you're looking for is &quot;sound treatment&quot;.  Any sound that
remains in your room will (sooner or later) end up in a microphone.
This is what affects the quality of your recording.

OK, that's the pedantic stuff out of the way, now the questions:

1) How big is your room? (The closer the dimensions are to a cube, the
nastier the room will sound even if you have treated it)
2) Could you record in some other room that has better/different
acoustic qualities?
3) Can this room become dedicated to recording, or does it need to be
multi-function (i.e. your bedroom)?
4) What instruments are you wanting to record - acoustic or electronic?

The bottom line with sound treatment is first to create a diffuse
environment, then add absorption as required to tinker with the room's
reverberation time.

I don't know how big your room is and I don't know how much
time/effort/money you want to throw at the project, so further
recommendations will depend on what you want to achieve.

You could check out my Control Room Calculator spreadsheet that allows
you to enter the dimensions of your room, and then you can noodle around
with different wall/floor/ceiling materials to get an idea of how those
materials will change the room's acoustic properties.

You should indeed use rubber gloves and wear a simple mask; the glass fibers
are nasty. You can buy the mask and fiberglass at a building supply store.
Depending where you are, someplace like Home Depot would work. Rubber gloves
you can get at the grocery store. You can make simple absorbers from a sheet
of 1/8&quot; chipboard, a hunk of fiberglass and some thin cloth to hold the
fiberglass in place. Don't lean or brush against them, once built.

Okay, the room. Please take some exact measurements and let us know what
they are. If the room is truly square, it's an acoustical nightmare, and you
should seriously consider working in a different space. And if the height
divides simply into the other dimensions (like an 8x10x10 room) the problem
will be worse.

Finally, if you're using both a DI and a microphone, there will be issues
even in the best room. The sound takes a certain amount of time to reach the
microphone, so that signal will be delayed with reference to the pickup/DI
setup. The best cure is usually to either ditch the DI or slide the
microphone signal backwards in a DAW until it's time-aligned with the pickup
signal.

Paul

So is it empty?  Any furniture?  Windows? Curtains/drapes?
Bookshelves, etc. etc.  All help &quot;break-up&quot; the slap-echoes
from parallel, opposite walls, and the &quot;organ pipe&quot; resonance
of the square room.  Have you tried moving yourself and/or
your instrument and./or the microphone around the room to
see if there are better spots than others?  Have you &quot;listened&quot;
to the room to see if there are slap-echoes or flutter-echoes,
reflections, etc?  What is on the floor?  the ceiling?

Fiberglass of the kind used for insulation won't &quot;cut&quot; you,
but the fibers will make you itchy if you don't use gloves, etc.
The fibers are much larger than asbestos fibres and don't
pose the health threat that asbestos does.  But not clear
whether it is appropriate for your situation, anyway. (For
lack of details.)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Where could I even buy that?
">

Any home improvement store (&quot;Home Depot&quot;, et.al.) sells
at least a few different kinds of fiberglass insulation, typically
compressed into rolls that you can transport easily.  It is
commonly tinted pink and was advertised on TV using the
&quot;Pink Panther&quot; etc.  Some people hang it from their walls
and cover it with some kind of cloth (burlap, that cheap
doubleknit polyester, etc.) to control any escaping fibers.

Have you visited http://www.realtraps.com ? There's a lot of good
information there, and they have some pre-fab material that you can
just hang on the wall in the right places (there's some guidance on
the web site) and the room will sound better.

You're setting yourself up for some problems here when combining the

It won't cut you, but the fibers can poke into your skin and make you
itch. And it doesn't do much for your lungs to breathe the fibers
either. But a dust mask, gloves, and long sleeves and pants will
protect you.

The standard do-it-yourself absorber is made from two to four inch
rigid Fiberglas insulation. Some home stores (Home Depot, Lowes) carry
it, but not all. It's mostly a contractor material and the easiest way
to find it is to call Corning and ask who in your area carries 703 or
705 material. Anyway, you get some of that, wrap it in a thin cloth to
keep the loose fibers from floating away, and hang it on the wall. You
can make it fancy, you can make a frame for it, but you'll get some
ideas from the RealTraps site. Or you can just by some RealTraps.

I can hear the groaning from this group even before I post this
reply.

Any sound deadening material is better than none.  The most obvious
reflections are the high frequency ones, and they are pretty easy to
cut back.  Thick blankets (packing blankets for instance) work pretty
well, as do simple acoustic tile, rugs etc.  It's best if you can hang
them a few inches from the walls.

These cheapo solutions aren't as good as you would like (try the rigid
fiberglass for better but more expensive treatment), but they will
help a good bit.  They don't absorb bass or even midrange - and that's
the stuff that will really wreak havoc with your recordings.

If you're handy, Ethan Winer has really great, simply built, and
inexpensive designs for real bass traps.  Search this site for his

I have a small bathroom that I use as a soundbooth.  Since it is all tiled,
it can sound really live and reverberant.  If I don't want so much of that
kind of sound, I start hanging comforters overthe shower door and stacking
pillows on the counter and deaden the heck out of it.  There are some great
deadening stuff usually around the house....blankets, comforters, pillows,
persian rugs, mattresses.  Just the fact that you can HEAR that there's a
problem is a huge benefit.  You might be able to do something about it.

More half assed solutions to a bad sounding room:

Try to randomize the surfaces of your walls, ceiling and floor.  Hang
&quot;clouds&quot; at an angle from your ceiling- wood or absorbent materials
hung from wires.  Hang shit on your walls - almost anything - shelves
with books are quite good and very useful.  The deeper (and denser)
the sound absorbent materials, the lower the frequency it will absorb.

I've always thought about getting a table saw and sawing 2 x 3's
lengthwise at an angle (45 degrees or more) and then paneling the
walls with angled wood.

I have a couple of walls with 6&quot; fiberglass hung (just nailed to the
walls), and then covered with cotton dropcloths I got at the paint
store.  This works quite well with high and mid frequencies (but
probably doesn't touch the bass).  Get the fiberglass that is enclosed
in a paper wrapper - it cuts down on the handling of the glass (and
definitely wear gloves, long sleeves and a mask).  I don't know if
it's dangerous, but if you breath this stuff in, it's makes for a few
days of scratchy uncomfortable breathing.  The little bits of glass
will embed themselves into your skin making for an itchy couple of
days.

Put down a rug with pad.

I have been trash picking for years and hanging the shit on my studio
walls.  Office cubicle panels (stacked so that they're 8 - 12&quot; deep)
work pretty well, especially when angled from the walls.  I tiled my
ceiling with layered, angled acoustic tile, sitting at progressively
farther distance from the sheetrock (using different depths of wood to
nail them to).  This works pretty good.

If you're successful in this you can make your nice room look like a
trash heap (as I did), and in the process improve the sound quality.

Then close mic instruments (see how close you need to be to cut out
room reverb, but still have enough distance from your instrument to
have a natural sound).

If you record your tracks somewhat &quot;dead&quot; (not so much ambient reverb)
you can add a longer digital reverb - making your recordings sound a
little confused, but definitely better than an overpowering tiny room.

When I think about all the work I did to make my rooms sound half way
decent I wonder why I didn't make nice bass traps, buy some ridged
fiberglass and do it right?  (answer 25 years ago when I did this they
didn't make ridged fiberglass, and I couldn't afford almost any decent
materials - and not having the internet, Ethan Winer or other
references, I was flying blind).

Simplest thing to try is using a good wind screen and getting very
close to the microphone, then using a suitable amount of compression
and low end roll -off EQ. If you have an omni mic with a good pop
filter, you can generally get very close and it will still sound
relatively natural.

Lots of furnishings and carpet help, so maybe try another room and not
the kitchen or the bathroom.

Acoustic treatment could be as simple as propping a few foam
mattresses up against the wall or throwing down a few rugs if you are
okay will killing the reflections a bit. Small rooms need lots of
random reflections or diffusion if you want the room to sound live,
but not too boxy. Pile in lots of furniture and stuff, at crazy
angles, keep the door open if isolation from outside noise or vise-
versa isn't a problem. Experiment!

To add diffusion and remove boxiness without killing the reverb is
always the difficult trick with a small room. See if there is a shop
that sells carpet near you. The decent stuff comes on very heavy gauge
cardboard rolls a bit less than a foot in diameter, and you can
generally get old ones either free or very cheap. Cut some of these so
they will just stand upright in the room. Paint them some cool colour
and dot them around wherever you have space - you can always move them
later. They will do wonders for breaking up the room modes without
killing the space.

If you cut them a foot or so shorter than the room and put some
absorbent padding inside, they will also do some bass trapping for
you, which might just be a bonus. Stand them in the corners for this.

Wow, thanks for all of the great advice, everyone. So I went home and
measured the room I was in, and it turns out it is in fact 10x10x8.5.
If my room is actually an acoustic hell hole as suggested, would it
even be worth trying to change the sound treatment? Or should I try to
find a new room to record in? I am in a house, but other people live
there as well, and it's kind of hard to move around. I don't want to
just plop all of my recording equipment down in the middle of the
living room. Any suggestions? And if I really do need to move rooms,
any suggestions on ideal dimensions?

The kit can be wherever you need it to be. Just have some mic leads
long enough to stretch around the place, and use whatever room takes
your fancy for recording in. Don't forget that John Bonham was a big
fan of stairways for recording his best drum sounds.

That room you have is probably the worst starting point for a
recording space you could imagine. About the only way to make it worse
still would be to make it ten feet tall as well.

This is about the worst possible configuration, because you have two big
room modes at the same frequency, and then another room mode that is right
near it.

You can take any room and eliminate room reflections.  The lower the
frequencies the reflections exist at, the harder and more expensive it is.
BUT, you can't take it and make the reflections sound good, and what you
really want is a room that sounds good in the first place.

I would look for a more rectangular room.  Golden mean is nice to have
although by no means essential.  Then I would sit down in the room,
clap your hands, and listen.  If you hear lots of individual discrete
reflections coming back, this is bad, and you need diffusion to break
those reflections up.  Bookcases and piles of old broken radio gear
makes for pretty good diffusion.  If you hear a lot of high frequency
slap coming back, you need high frequency absorption.  Sofas, carpets,
and stuffed animals will deal with that.

If you're stuck in the room that you are in, change the room dimensions
by putting stuff in the room.  Deep bookcases on the side walls are a
good start, and room dividers and partitions can help too.  Your goal is
to break standing waves at low frequencies up, and to have enough diffusion
that high frequencies decay slowly rather than as a much of discrete
echoes, and enough absorption that there isn't more high frequency room
sound than low frequency room sound.

The various commercial acoustical control products can do this effectively
without looking silly.  If you don't mind the room looking silly, you can
deal with a lot of the problems in less expensive ways.  However, it may
result in losing a lot more working space in the room.

A room that is cube-like will resonate very strongly at the frequency
that corresponds to the room's width (which is also happens to be its
length and height).  In your case, for a 10x10x8.5 room, you'll hear
boominess in a two octave range centred roughly on the A an octave below
middle C.  The notes that appear to boom the most will be A's (or there
abouts).

The trick to improving the acoustics in a room is first to use
diffusion, and then to apply absorption.  Diffusion scatters the sound
and helps break up strong echoes and makes the room feel like it is
filled with sound.  As Don suggested, the easiest way to do this is to
go down to your nearest carpet dealer, and ask for the old cardboard
tubes around which the carpet is wrapped. Get as many as you can and if
you can get a variety of diameters, so much the better.

Then simply lean them against the walls every 2' or so and try another
recording.  You'll notice that when you sing, you will feel far more
surrounded by sound, which in turn will help you sing better (this
effect is known as &quot;listener envelopement&quot; - even though you're the
performer).  If the room is still too live (or echoey), then try hanging
some heavy curtains to act as absorbers.

If this room can be dedicated to recording, then it would be worth
cutting the tubes in half down their length, and fixing them more
permanently to the walls.  That way they won't fall over if you bump
into them.  You could even try hanging the curtains in front of the tubes.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Depends if the proposed solution is acceptable to you or not and whether
or not you have another room available to you.

Fair enough.  However, if you don't mind moving your equipment around,
and the other people don't mind if the living room is temporarily
hi-jacked, then you might find that a workable solution.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

">

If you are able to construct your own room, then choose dimensions that
have no common divisor.  E.G. 9' x 14' x 17' (HxWxL)

May I suggest that you go to a good public library and find a book by F.
Alton Everest? He's written several on how to build small, low-budget
studios and make them sound good. Don't start with the Master Handbook of
Acoustics, but with one of the less intimidating books, and work you way up.

If your library doesn't have his books, ask the librarian about
Inter-Library Loan. Or go buy one.

And yes, 10x10x8.5 is a horrible shape for a room.

Peace,
Paul

And what's worse, if you try to shorten one wall to make it less square
horizontally, you'll have to shorten it quite a bit to avoid making it
square vertically.

Sure. Indeed, if that's what you have, then treatment is your ONLY viable
option. See my Acoustics FAQ here:

In the FAQ linked above there's a Mode Calculator program you can download
for free. The program is Windows only, but if you have a Mac you can still
aim for one of the eight recommended ratios shown in the program screen

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I realized once I said sound proofing and actually did some
&gt;&gt; research on it that what I really meant was reducing the echo, thanks
&gt;&gt; for that. I know that the room I'm in isn't ideal, but I don't have a
&gt;&gt; lot of choice when it comes to location. I am just doing some basic,
&gt;&gt; single instrument with vocal recordings, usually guitar. I am using an
&gt;&gt; Mbox, so I can record two inputs at once. I've been trying a DI and
&gt;&gt; mic set up with the guitar recording, which is where I'm getting the
&gt;&gt; boxy sound from. The room I'm in is probably about 10x10 and 8 or 9
&gt;&gt; feet tall. I've heard that you shouldn't touch fiberglass, that it can
&gt;&gt; cut your or something. Where could I even buy that?

&gt; You should indeed use rubber gloves and wear a simple mask; the glass
&gt; fibers
&gt; are nasty. You can buy the mask and fiberglass at a building supply store.
&gt; Depending where you are, someplace like Home Depot would work. Rubber
&gt; gloves
&gt; you can get at the grocery store. You can make simple absorbers from a
&gt; sheet
&gt; of 1/8&quot; chipboard, a hunk of fiberglass and some thin cloth to hold the
&gt; fiberglass in place. Don't lean or brush against them, once built.

&gt; Okay, the room. Please take some exact measurements and let us know what
&gt; they are. If the room is truly square, it's an acoustical nightmare, and
&gt; you
&gt; should seriously consider working in a different space. And if the height
&gt; divides simply into the other dimensions (like an 8x10x10 room) the
&gt; problem
&gt; will be worse.

&gt; Finally, if you're using both a DI and a microphone, there will be issues
&gt; even in the best room. The sound takes a certain amount of time to reach
&gt; the
&gt; microphone, so that signal will be delayed with reference to the pickup/DI
&gt; setup. The best cure is usually to either ditch the DI or slide the
&gt; microphone signal backwards in a DAW until it's time-aligned with the
&gt; pickup
&gt; signal.

&gt; Peace,
&gt; Paul

Paul I know you think the egg carton trick is an urban myth but let me
describe what I have done.
I have a very small house in a rural town. Most houses around here were
built pre 1940. Good solid structures but small with very small rooms. In
the northern tier so keeping the warmth in was the priority.
On the main floor I have a room that is 7'X10'. I lined the walls with the
paper formed egg catrons, blew an absorbant coating made from latex paint
and a fibre'd support medium with one of those textured material air hoppers
that they use on stucco houses. I positioned bass traps in the cornors and
am currently considering installing a softer overhead.
The room filters out the street noise (one vehical an hour tops till 7pm
then silent) plus keeps the sound of a recording session inside.
On the two windows in the room I have a roll each fashioned to the window
top that is thick padded quilt material.
To say that egg crates are a myth is irresponsible. It has a great deal to
do with how the installation is preformed and what properties you are taking
advantage of. For instance my set up has the egg cup section mounted onto
the crate top section, doubling the cardboard. Then the textured coating
that is applied on top of that has it's own abosorbant and diffusive
properties.
I have been considering draping a sheet of black cloth over it as well, but
as long as the drunks stay off the walls it functions like a dream fo my
recording.
