______
In 2003, psychology professor and sex researcher J. Michael Bailey
published a book entitled The Man Who Would Be Queen: The Science of
Gender-Bending and Transsexualism. The book's portrayal of
male-to-female (MTF) transsexualism, based on a theory developed by
sexologist Ray Blanchard, outraged some transgender activists. They
believed the book to be typical of much of the biomedical literature
on transsexuality-oppressive in both tone and claims, insulting to
their senses of self, and damaging to their public identities. Some
saw the book as especially dangerous because it claimed to be based
on rigorous science, was published by an imprint of the National
Academies of Science, and argued that MTF sex changes are motivated
primarily by erotic interests and not by the problem of having the
gender identity common to one sex in the body of the other.
Dissatisfied with the option of merely criticizing the book, a small
number of transwomen (particularly Lynn Conway, Andrea James, and
Deirdre McCloskey) worked to try to ruin Bailey. Using published and
unpublished sources as well as original interviews, this essay
traces the history of the backlash against Bailey and his book. It
also provides a thorough exegesis of the book's treatment of
transsexuality and includes a comprehensive investigation of the
merits of the charges made against Bailey that he had behaved
unethically, immorally, and illegally in the production of his book.
The essay closes with an epilogue that explores what has happened
since 2003 to the central ideas and major players in the
controversy.

&quot;[T]he job of the gay community is not to deal with extremists who
would castigate us or put us on an island and drop an H-bomb on us.
The fact of the matter is that there is a small percentage of people
in America who understand the true nature of the homosexual
community. There is another small percentage who will never
understand us. Our job is not to get those people who dislike us to
love us. Nor was our aim in the civil rights movement to get
prejudiced white people to love us. Our aim was to try to create the
kind of America, legislatively, morally, and psychologically, such
that even though some whites continued to hate us, they could not
openly manifest that hate. That's our job today: to control the
extent to which people can publicly manifest antigay sentiment.&quot;
