Hope Renewed
A Lakeland, Fla., church provides companionship for senior adults living alone.
by Andrea Bailey
from Outreach magazine, July/August 2007

At 5 p.m.. on a Thursday evening, the all-purpose room at First Baptist Church at the Mall (FBC) in Lakeland, Fla., is transformed into a five-star restaurant. Round tables are decked with white tablecloths and sparkling silverware. Laughter echoes off the walls as more than 100 senior adults chat over a meal of steak and baked potatoes. Attentive volunteer &quot;waiters&quot; in blue aprons clear plates and refill water glasses.
As the musicians tune up for the night's entertainment, 92-year-old Maxine grabs the hand of Gene Wells, FBC's senior adults pastor. &quot;This is the finest steak I've had in a long time,&quot; she whispers. &quot;Do you have a doggie bag? I'd like to have me a steak sandwich tomorrow.&quot;
Welcome to FBC's Hope for the Heart, a ministry for adults 60 and older who live alone.. Each first and third Thursday of the month, both churched and unchurched seniors tired of sitting at home, with nowhere to go and no one to talk to, flock to the church for an evening of free food, fun and fellowship.
&quot;We treat them like kings and queens,&quot; says Wells, a longtime church member who co-founded Hope for the Heart in July 2006. &quot;If seniors have been alone too long and aren't encouraged to get out around other people, they become despondent.&quot;
The ministry was birthed from Wells' own battle with loneliness when, after 56 years of marriage, his wife was placed in a medical care unit. The retiree faced an empty house and intense feelings of isolation.
&quot;It was a major adjustment for me,&quot; he recalls. &quot;I started wondering how many people at my church over the age of 60 were having the same struggles.&quot;
Just weeks later, a leader from FBC's senior adults Sunday school class approached Wells and Mary Lou Helm, another senior adult, concerned about several men in the class struggling with loneliness. Wells and Helm proposed gathering those who lived alone for a catered meal and entertainment by local musicians. The men—and several ladies as well—eagerly agreed to attend.
&quot;That first night, some came into the church with canes, others with walkers and portable oxygen tanks,&quot; Wells says. &quot;Still others had full physical capabilities. &quot;
Today, the ministry attracts 110 seniors from the church and community for biweekly socializing, fine dining and live entertainment from singers, guitarists and Christian illusionists —thanks to funding from FBC. Wells ends the gatherings with a closing word of encouragement, including a scripture verse and an opportunity to accept Jesus, and members make it home before dark.
&quot;Hope for the Heart members seem so pleased because they're doing something other than watching TV,&quot; says Helm, who serves as Wells' assistant. &quot;They get to laugh with their friends..&quot;
While food and fellowship are important, Wells believes helping others is the best salve for a lonely heart. The ministry reaches out to the thousands of unchurched seniors in the Central Florida county by passing out invite cards in mobile home communities, delivering home-cooked meals to shut-ins, visiting lonely residents in the 10 local nursing homes and assisting the church's Compassion House ministry that provides food and clothes to the needy. In a new service segment, Hope for the Heart members perform minor home repairs, yard work and tree trimming for other seniors with physical or financial limitations. Wells' latest endeavor is a community-wide Alzheimer's support group.
&quot;Hope for the Heart is meeting the needs of those in our church who live alone, as well as those outside our church,&quot; says Dave McClamma, FBC's associate pastor of adults ministries. &quot;It gives those who live alone a feeling that someone cares about them and their needs, as well as the adjustments they have to make living alone.&quot;
And the community is responding to this simple act of caring. Neil, a local senior, recently telephoned Wells and said, &quot;I never go out to a restaurant and never go out with other people. I am just so tired of eating alone.&quot; Wells invited him to Hope for the Heart, and since August 2006, Neil hasn't missed a single gathering.
&quot;Just last week, we had one person come forward and say he wanted to get his baptism in order,&quot; says Helm. &quot;He was saved and baptized as a child, but he wanted to renew his commitment.&quot;
As seniors find hope and spiritual solace in the company of other seniors, the church body seeks to give back to its ministry veterans, some who've been serving the church for 40 or 50 years. Every year, FBC's deacons each adopt one widow or widower to provide tangible help, prayer and a listening ear. The church's young adults group serves as volunteer waiters at ministry dinners, and recently took time over spring break to perform yard and house work for seniors. And PrimeTimers, FBC's quarterly ministry program for seniors, also serves meals at Hope for the Heart.
&quot;I teach a senior adults Sunday School class with Mary Lou,&quot; Wells says. &quot;I tell class members, 'It's time to put aprons of service on, so these people can come in and feel like they're in a fine restaurant.' That way, they get to do something for the people who are part of their class..&quot;
The congregational service excites Wells, but appreciation from Hope for the Heart members keeps him especially motivated. At last week's meeting, a woman he has known for almost 40 years, a recent divorcee, approached him after dinner.
&quot;I knew she wanted to say something, but she was hanging back,&quot; Wells says.
At last his old friend spoke. &quot;I want to thank you for doing this for us, Pastor,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;because we really need the encouragement. &quot;
Pastor's Notes: Principles for Senior Adults Ministry
by Dave McClamma

Find a caring leader. &quot;What makes Hope for the Heart work so well is the leadership, heart and passion of Pastor Wells. Find someone who has a caring spirit for those who are living alone, a leader who will be intentional about each senior receiving a personal touch.&quot;
Meet felt needs.. &quot;It's been said that people don't care how much you know until they know how much you care. Before you share the Gospel, make sure to show seniors God's love with tangible actions. They need a sense of belonging, acceptance, a renewed purpose for life. Fill those needs first.&quot;
Emphasize service. &quot;The most exciting thing is seeing many senior adults who live alone and have not been involved in service for a period of time, find hope again in getting out and interacting with and serving others. Each week, FBC has 473 seniors who volunteer and serve in various capacities, and many are from Hope for the Heart. In our church's Compassion House ministry, which provides food and clothing to those in need in our community, we have 73 senior adults serving three days a week. This truly brings meaning and purpose to their lives.&quot;
Dave McClamma has served as associate pastor of adult ministries at First Baptist Church of the Mall in Lakeland, Fla., for nine years. In addition to pastoral care, he leads the PrimeTimers quarterly seniors ministry and the Faith Riders Motorcycle Ministry Sunday school class.
