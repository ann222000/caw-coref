I don't think that is built in behaviour, but could possibly be done.
However, I am wondering why you need to do this?

that's a low level routine which i would guess is handled by the operating
system.

I would also assume an absolute and relative position could be given.

in the old days the mouse position was given relative to the upper left hand
corner.

in as much as computing is math oriented i am certain that the number(s)
given could be shifted, rotated and expanded (among other operations) at
will.

Happy programming.

So. I want to make html editor and I want to make listbox with html
tags which can apeard when something is wriiting. This listbox should
be next to the coursor so I need to localize this point.
