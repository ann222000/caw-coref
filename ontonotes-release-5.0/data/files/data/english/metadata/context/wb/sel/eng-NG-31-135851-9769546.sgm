Hi all,

For Plone 3.1, I'm working on a PLIP (184) which is about the inclusion
of new standard portlets. I'd like some opinions on what you'd like to
see in them.

On the table now are:

1. A &quot;static text&quot; portlet. This has a title (required), a body text
field using the Kupu editor (required), a footer (optional) and a URL
(optional), which if set will turn the header and footer into links.

2. A &quot;collection&quot; portlet. This allows the administrator to find a
Collection (Topic/Smart Folder) and show its contents. You can limit how
many items are displayed, and there'll be a &quot;more...&quot; link in the footer
that links to the underlying collection itself, which you can turn off
with a checkbox.

Now - are there other options you'd like to see for these two portlets?
If so, please justify with some realistic use cases.

Also, if there are other portlets (or modifications to existing
portlets) you miss and feel are a good candidate for inclusion in the
Plone core, please say so. Again, please justify with some real-world
use cases.

I can't promise anything, but consider this your chance to give input! :)

For the static portlet it would be very useful if you could have
multiple ones on a site with different styling.
So a unique css style(s) would be auto-generated for each new static
portlet you added like the main sections now have auto-generated styles
(section-front-page, section-services, etc.)
Thanks for asking!

I thought so, but I'm not sure how to do it right.

One option is to have a &quot;borderless&quot; tickbox, which basically just
renders the text without any portlet styling around it. Then you can
just use the HTML in the portlet itself to do whatever styling you need.

The problem with an auto-generated CSS class is that it's hard to
predict. If I have five static text portlets, what do I call each of
them? How can the CSS author be sure that the generated classes won't
change if the site admin moves portlets around?

Perhaps there could be some kind of registry of outer CSS classes and a
drop-down box, but I'm not sure where such a registry would be
maintained. I don't want to create too much infrastructure just for this
one portlet.

I like the borderless tickbox idea.  That should take care of all use
cases I can think of.

I suspect it's a minority use case that isn't worth complicating the

I'm not so sure it's that much of a minority use case, but that's the
purpose of this thread - to solicit opinions. I've spoken to a few
people who've said that being able to style static text portlets
independently is important. I guess that blurs the difference between
site theme, structure and content, but also fills a void.

This use case doesn't seem much different from providing custom
styling for enduser-edited *content* so I'm leaning in favor of
consistency and have the static portlet work the same way, along with
the option to strip the border.

Although... last I checked, kupu had issues with styling a container
div.  Isn't this still the case?

It's not too late to make changes, but here's what I've done for now:

- The static text portlet has an &quot;omit border&quot; tickbox. When checked,
*only* the text of the portlet is rendered (inside a div). The header,
footer, details URL and standard portlet border/formatting is not included.

- Whether &quot;omit border&quot; is selected or not, a CSS class is generated
from the header text (which is still mandatory).

For example, if a static text portlet has the header &quot;Welcome message&quot;,
with &quot;omit border&quot; turned on and the text &quot;Hello /world/&quot; (entered with
Kupu, the last word in italics), the output would be:

&lt;div class=&quot;portletStaticText portlet-static-welcome-message&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

If omit-border were false (the default), it would include the standard
portlet &lt;dl&gt; structure:

&lt;dl class=&quot;portlet portletStaticText portlet-static-welcome-message&quot;&gt;
&lt;dt class=&quot;portletHeader&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;portletTopLeft&quot;/&gt;
&lt;span&gt; Welcome message &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;portletTopRight&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class=&quot;portletItem odd&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello &lt;em&gt;world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;portletBottomLeft&quot;/&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;portletBottomRight&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

There's also the option to provide a portlet footer and an optional
&quot;details&quot; link in the case with omit border is off.

This feels minimally clunky and should cover a range of use cases.
Opinions welcome!

For a customer of Zest Software we (well, Balasz Ree mostly I think)
made a banner portlet: give it a url for an image to display and a url
for where clicking that image should take you.  Probably entering a
path works as well.  The client can use it on the home page (or
anywhere else) to draw attention to some content on this site or on
another site.

Would this be general enough to add in plone.app.portlets?  Do other
people think this is useful?

If you have a branch for this plip I could add some code this or next
week.

I think it would be a useful third party product. The collective is

Right, exactly.

I don't want any more portlets in plone.app.portlets itself, since that
should be about infrastructure. For Plone 3.1, we'll ship two additional
packages: plone.portlet.static and plone.portlet.collection.

One of the goals of the new portlets infrastructure was to make it
easier to distribute re-usable, configurable portlets. Make an egg,
stick it in the Cheese Shop and plone.org/products, and people can just
install it.

I am all for independent styling.
Though, so far the only independent styling I have wanted to do, is to get
rid of the border ;)

Awesome.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; For the static portlet it would be very useful if you could have
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; multiple ones on a site with different styling.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I thought so, but I'm not sure how to do it right.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One option is to have a &quot;borderless&quot; tickbox, which basically just
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; renders the text without any portlet styling around it. Then you can
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just use the HTML in the portlet itself to do whatever styling you
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; need.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What makes the static portlet useful for my end users is the use of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Kupu
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for the body text field. They don't know HTML so any HTML styling would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; need to be hidden from them.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Kupu has the option to define custom CSS classes that you can apply to
&gt;&gt;&gt; content in the editable area, though.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; So a unique css style(s) would be auto-generated for each new static
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; portlet you added like the main sections now have auto-generated
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; styles
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (section-front-page, section-services, etc.)

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem with an auto-generated CSS class is that it's hard to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; predict. If I have five static text portlets, what do I call each of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; them? How can the CSS author be sure that the generated classes won't
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; change if the site admin moves portlets around?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would it be possible to add an additional field to the schema that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; be the id, perhaps generated from the portlet header field like short
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; names are generated from page titles?
&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course. It just feels rather clunky.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What do others think?

&gt;&gt; I suspect it's a minority use case that isn't worth complicating the
&gt;&gt; default UI for.

&gt; I'm not so sure it's that much of a minority use case, but that's the
&gt; purpose of this thread - to solicit opinions. I've spoken to a few
&gt; people who've said that being able to style static text portlets
&gt; independently is important. I guess that blurs the difference between
&gt; site theme, structure and content, but also fills a void.

Hello,
How about a portlet that manages the criteria for a collection?  It could
appear next to a collection and allow a user to quickly change the criteria
for a collection without going to the criteria tab of the collection.

I would like to work on such a portlet because it would be very useful for
what I do, but I would probably need help to get started in the right
direction.

&gt; Hi all,

&gt; For Plone 3.1, I'm working on a PLIP (184) which is about the inclusion
&gt; of new standard portlets. I'd like some opinions on what you'd like to
&gt; see in them.

&gt; On the table now are:

&gt;   1. A &quot;static text&quot; portlet. This has a title (required), a body text
&gt; field using the Kupu editor (required), a footer (optional) and a URL
&gt; (optional), which if set will turn the header and footer into links.

&gt;   2. A &quot;collection&quot; portlet. This allows the administrator to find a
&gt; Collection (Topic/Smart Folder) and show its contents. You can limit how
&gt; many items are displayed, and there'll be a &quot;more...&quot; link in the footer
&gt; that links to the underlying collection itself, which you can turn off
&gt; with a checkbox.

&gt; Now - are there other options you'd like to see for these two portlets?
&gt; If so, please justify with some realistic use cases.

&gt; Also, if there are other portlets (or modifications to existing
&gt; portlets) you miss and feel are a good candidate for inclusion in the
&gt; Plone core, please say so. Again, please justify with some real-world
&gt; use cases.

&gt; I can't promise anything, but consider this your chance to give input! :)

Hi Martin,

We've been brainstorming around the office about possible portlets. Here are
their comments, albeit a bit muddled:

I would propose:
- hide/show Collection's Description (default: show)
- hide/show Collection's rich Body (default: hide)
- hide/show listings' Descriptions (default: hide)

The use cases for the first two are the following:
- limit to 1 (maybe 2) items in the listing; include a verbose description
(ie show description; hide rich body)
- limit to 1 (maybe 2) items in the listing; include a verbose *rich*
description (ie hide description; show rich body)
- show a bunch of items in the listing; hide both description and body

Random content portlet: I was thinking the portlet would have a dropdown to
select a particular
content type.  Perhaps also a setting for how many to show.

Random image portlet, a subset of the random content portlet.

Recent comments portlet: So that you can easily what content on the site has
recently generated
discussion.  Jon Stahl has mentioned this one, so may have a clearer use
case in mind.

Media Portlet – This ideas are probably best combined but here are two
subideas of this.
o       Slideshow Portlet - Grabs slide show by flickr or other online photo
gallery id and/or tags and/or sets and allows you to configure things like
(how many slides, show titles (y/n))
o       Video Portlet – Same Idea
o       Podcast Portlet – Same Idea

Editable Portlet – Connects to a page that you edit.

News Clipping portlet – you can connect the portlet to one or many RSS
feeds.  When you are logged in it allows you to see news items from the
feed. You can click items that you like and add comments and decide if you
want to write your own into to the content or leave it as is.

Google Analytics Portlet – This portlet connects with Google Analytics and
shows you page relevant results.  What is the rank of the page you are on.
How many visitors has it has.  What is the top link on the page. Bounce
rate, top keyword.

Cheers,

- Veda
