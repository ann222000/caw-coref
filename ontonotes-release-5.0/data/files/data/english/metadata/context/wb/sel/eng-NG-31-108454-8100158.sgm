THE CORRIDORS OF POWER

Raja Petra Kamarudin

Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi left the country
quietly and in a hurry early on the night of 16 July 2007. He is due
back on 27 July 2007; or so they say. Where he went and why he went
there was never explained and no one is being told why the Prime
Minister needs to sneak out of the country and stay away for ten
days. The mainstream media imposed a total news blackout on the
matter and only a few would have known had Malaysia Today not written
about it. What was puzzling is the fact that the Prime Minister of
New Zealand was still in the country and Pak Lah was scheduled to
meet her the day she was supposed to leave for home. Needless to say,
Pak Lah stood her up. Other engagements Pak Lah was supposed to
attend or officiate had to suffer the disappointment of not being
able to witness the spectacle of our Prime Minister fast asleep the
entire duration of the event. They were just told by telephone that
Pak Lah would not be able to attend without any explanation as to why.

It makes one wonder when Pak Lah leaves the country every time there
is a tragedy and lives are lost. Remember the Johor floods late last
year? Now it is the Nuri helicopter crash. By the way, the government
will be using these Nuris for another three years but will install
beacons in them to enable the authorities to find them faster when
all the balance crash. The pilots in fact call them flying coffins.
Sheesh! What kind of insensitive and irresponsible government do we
have anyway?

Anyway, that is not the most perplexing part of this whole issue. The
day Pak Lah left, his most trusted secretary resigned in a huff. He
just threw his resignation onto the table and flew off to London, not
wanting to have anything more to do with his boss who has been most
difficult of late. If there was one man who the late Endon liked and
trusted very much it is this man. And this man is now gone.

But no, that is still not yet the most perplexing part of this whole
issue. The next day, the IGP, Musa Hassan, the Director of the
Special Branch, and according to some reports, the Sabah Chief
Minister, Musa Aman, flew to Australia to meet Pak Lah. (Others,
however, say Musa Aman went earlier and missed Pak Lah while even
others say he actually went to Singapore and not to Australia --
without Pak Lah's knowledge and permission of course).

Now, there are many theories as to why they all suddenly joined Pak
Lah in Australia. One theory is that Pak Lah wanted their feedback on
whether he can call for a general election in August. The boys on the
‘Fourth Floor’ led by his son-in-law, Khairy Jamaluddin, want the
elections over and done with by the third week of August so that the
50th Anniversary of Merdeka on the night of 30 August 2007 can also
be a celebration of Pak Lah’s landslide victory, a repeat of the 2004
General Elections of sorts. Of course, the Elections Commission (SPR)
has announced that they will only be ready for an election by
September so the August theory may not be correct. On the other hand,
the SPR announcement could be a Red Herring to fool the opposition
into thinking that the elections cannot be called before September,
and then suddenly, in August, they call for an election and catch the
opposition with its pants down.

I, however, would discount this first theory because such a
discussion can easily be held in Putrajaya or Kuala Lumpur and the
entire top guns need not fly to Australia just to discuss this.
Furthermore, Khairy was not in the discussion so certainly Pak Lah
would not want to discuss the matter of the general election without
his son-in-law being present -- unless he now wants to exclude Khairy
from the equation like he is telling some people whom he is trying to
persuade to swing over to his side.

The second theory -- and this is what the people in the intelligence
community tell me -- is that Musa Aman and Musa Hassan wanted to
discuss Malaysia Today, plus get Pak Lah’s blessing and permission to
close Malaysia Today down and arrest me. The reason the Director of
the Special Branch was asked to tag along is so that he can brief Pak
Lah on the intelligence reports they have obtained as to the damage
Malaysia Today has inflicted on the image of Sabah, the Royal
Malaysian Police, and Pak Lah personally.

Musa Aman recently announced that Barisan Nasional Sabah is confident
of sweeping all the 60 state seats and all the 25 parliament seats in
Sabah and in that same process will wipe the opposition off the face
of Sabah. But he is not really sure that this can be done as Malaysia
Today is quite popular and is widely read in many parts of Sabah,
even in some of the rural areas. Musa Aman feels that Malaysia Today
needs to be silenced as fast as possible if they want to realise
their dream of pembangkang sifar (zero opposition) in Sabah.

Other theorists say that Musa Aman did not really go to Australia to
meet Pak Lah but instead just used this as an excuse to go visit his
mistress, Jennifer Marcos, who they say lives in Perth not far from
Pak Lah’s house. I personally don’t buy this theory of course as I
don’t think Musa Aman would be so rash as to squeeze some sex in on
the side with our most righteous and most virtuous Prime Minister in
town. Surely Pak Lah would not tolerate such pussy-footing from one
of his ministers. I mean, would Pak Lah allow one of his ministers to
do what he would never do himself? No, I don’t think so.

Musa Hassan, in turn, say my Deep Throats, wanted to cry on Pak Lah’s
shoulder about the second ‘Black Eye’ the Royal Malaysian Police is
suffering after the first one on 20 September 1998, the night that
the then IGP beat up Anwar Ibrahim to a pulp. The Police Force is
rapidly losing its credibility and they are worried that with five
more Statutory Declarations of police officers that Malaysia Today
has promised to reveal, the damage to the Royal Malaysian Police may
be beyond repair. Musa Hassan too feels that Malaysia Today must be
silenced, and as fast as possible.

The police is now looking into how it can silence Malaysia Today. One
possibility would be to arrest me and charge me for sedition. The
other would be to get the ISPs to block Malaysia Today like they did
recently with the get-rich-quick websites. But blocking Malaysia
Today may not work as there are always ways around this ‘road-block’.
Furthermore, Malaysia Today is not located in Malaysia so the long
arm of the Malaysian law cannot reach beyond our shores. The fast-
track and sure-fire way would be to arrest me and charge me for
sedition. And they are now studying the articles I wrote plus the
comments from readers and bloggers to see what seditious laws we have
broken and use this to come get me. (So expect me to start deleting
your ‘offensive’ postings and maybe even bar you at the same time if
you don’t behave).

Well, let them try. They will certainly be very surprised. It is not
that easy to pin down an Anak Raja Bugis. Not even the mighty Dutch
could do that and in the end they were forced to make a treaty with
the Bugis and share everything they plundered in the Straits of
Malacca 50:50. Anyhow, I doubt this was the purpose of Musa Aman’s,
Musa Hassan’s, and the Director of Special Branch’s trip to Australia
to meet Pak Lah. That is if we go by what the third theorists tell me.

As I said earlier, Pak Lah made this sudden and unplanned trip to
Australia while dropping all his appointments in the process,
including the meeting with the Prime Minister of New Zealand who was
left hanging in her hotel room. This is not only unbecoming of a
Prime Minister but highly unusual as well. Now, according to some
other Deep Throats, Pak Lah was advised to leave the country and to
take his family with him for his own good. It seems, according to
what I have been told, if Pak Lah does not leave, then he may suffer
arrest. And the reason he summoned the two topmost policemen to
Australia is so that they could brief him about the security
situation and whether it is true that there are moves to arrest him.

Now, what is not clear is: why should Pak Lah be arrested and who
would be the one who will arrest him? After all, Pak Lah is clean and
has committed no crime -- well, other than the Scomi government
contracts, the ECM Libra insider trading, the Oil-for-Food scam, the
RM600 million bribe to 191 Umno divisions, sabotaging Tun Dr Mahathir
Mohamad in Kubang Pasu, mismanagement of the RM1 billion a year
Terengganu Oil Royalty, etc., etc., etc. This, I cannot comprehend,
and unless this is made clear then I find this theory difficult to
accept as well.

There is another theory which I find even more far-fetched, although
some of my Deep Throats swear on their mothers’ graves they are
telling me the truth (they never told me whether their mothers are
dead or still alive though). According to these people, Pak Lah’s
wife, Jeanne Danker, was actually married a second time after her
divorce from Endon’s brother and that Pak Lah is actually the third
husband. However, say my Deep Throats, with an extremely strong
conviction to boot, Jeanne is not yet divorced from the second
husband. My Deep Throats further testify that Pak Lah’s people are
now looking for this second husband somewhere on planet earth to get
him to testify that he has in fact verbally divorced Jeanne although
there are no documents to this affect. Have you heard the saying that
a verbal agreement is not worth the paper it is written on?

No, this theory is even more difficult to fathom. Even if this is
true, which, as I said, I am inclined to believe is not, why did the
entire family have to leave Malaysia in a hurry, and unplanned on top
of that? Are they telling me that his matter of Jeanne’s second,
missing husband cannot be settled in Malaysia but can in Australia?
Can you see how this does not make sense? I know they say that
Jeanne’s second husband is a foreigner but surely he couldn’t have
been an Aborigine!

Anyway, let us forget about all these theories and let us instead
speculate on what might be the real reason. But this is mere
speculation mind you. And speculation is just that, speculation.
Okay, Pak Lah and his family left Malaysia in a hurry, just like the
previous Thai Prime Minister. Was Pak Lah; just like the previous
Thai Prime Minister; under extreme pressure and that is why he left
the country? Hmm.....interesting.....wasn’t the previous Thai Prime
Minister ousted. Nah, it can’t be, not in Malaysia.

Well, Pak Lah is due back on 27 July 2007. I am sure he will return
all safe and sound; and as sleepy as usual. And I am sure that was
what Malaysia’s two topmost policemen went to Australia for; to
assure Pak Lah that all is honky-dory and peachy-rosy back in
Malaysia. In the meantime, I will half-believe the theory that the
purpose the IGP, the Sabah Chief Minister, and the Director of the
Special Branch went to meet Pak Lah in Australia was to discuss how
to close down Malaysia Today. And, since I half-believe that, I am
going to fire another shot at Musa Aman and Musa Hassan; you know, a
sort of cat and mouse game.

I am going to recap what I previously wrote about the raping of
Sabah’s forest reserves and how Musa Aman is going to make RM4.8
billion from this scam. This time, however, I am supporting my
allegation with documents in the form of Agreements. Please read what
I previously wrote as follows (click the headings to access the full
articles):

Raping of Sabah's forests
How to make RM4.8 billion in just a couple of years

Monday, July 31, 2006

The Ulu Segama Reserve (203,080ha), Malua Forest Reserve (33,969ha)
and Ulu Kalumpang Forest Reserve (51,118ha) cover an area the size of
Rhode Island or four times the size of Singapore.

Based on government valuation, the value of these three forest
reserves is RM4.8 billion. The open market price would of course be
many, many times that.

Large-scale timber harvesting would end by 2007 and will be replaced
with sustainable forest management practices. To beat this deadline,
the Sabah government is allowing fast-track logging in these forest
reserves so that they can clear the area of trees within the next
year or so.

This is genocide of the highest degree.

The pictures can be viewed here

PROPOSAL FOR TAKE-OVER OF TIMBER EXTRACTION &amp; SALE OF TIMBER OF SABAH
FOUNDATION TIMBER CONCESSION AREA IN SABAH

1. Background of the concession

i. Locality : Gunung Rara, Kalabakan, Tawau, Sabah bordering to
Maliau Basin.

ii. Coupe No. : YT 3/04 (NFM)

iii. Acreage : 61,217 acres (24,774 hactares)

v. Ownership : Yayasan Sabah conession area managed by a wholly-owned
subsidiary company of Sabah Foundation.

2. Current Status

i. Approval : The said concession has been approved for assignment by
the Board of Directors of Innoprise Corporation Sdn. Bhd.

ii. Value of concession : The inventory report estimates that the
proceed from the sales of timber amounts to RM400 million.

The total destruction of Sabah's rainforests: genocide of alarming
proportions

In 1800, there were 2.9 billion hectares of tropical forests
worldwide. However, over these last 200 years since 1800, mankind has
been rapidly destroying this valuable forest area that took thousands
of years to develop. Since 1950 alone, half of all tropical
rainforests have disappeared, leaving just 2.5 million square miles
(647 million hectares) of forests remaining and, every year, we
continue to lose an estimated 93,000 square miles more.

The RM11 billion silap mata (sleight of hand)

On a conservative calculation of RM42,000 per hectare, the market
value of 250,000 hectares of virgin rainforest is roughly 11 billion
Ringgit. Yes, that’s right, RM11,000,000,000; more than you can count
in your lifetime. The perplexing part about this whole deal is,
logging started as far back as the 1990s though the project was only
supposed to kick off in 2005. This means they started extracting the
logs almost ten years before the commencement of the paper mill --
starting from Yong Teck Lee’s tenure as Chief Minister, right through
to Bernard Dompok, Osu Sukam, Chong Kah Kiat and now Musa Aman.

Musa Aman’s hidden hand

For almost ten years now, Benta Wawasan Sdn Bhd, a subsidiary of
Innoprise Corporation Sdn Bhd, which is in turn owned by the Sabah
Foundation (Yayasan Sabah), has been reaping, or should I instead say
raping, Sabah’s rich forest resources. They did this under the
pretext of servicing their pulp and paper mill project, which
actually never took off. In fact, it appears like there was no
intention to embark on the project in the first place. They just
wanted the RM11 billion worth of logs.

Sabah's Malua and Ulu Segama forest reserves about to be plundered

Two Sabah forest reserves, to be bequeathed as Malaysia’s
biodiversity gift to the world by the end of 2007, are set to be
logged in a month or two – endangering countless species of plants
and wildlife. A race against time is underway to log the Malua and
Ulu Segama forest reserves, covering a total of 236,825ha, which is
three times the size of Singapore, before the deadline. The state-
owned Yayasan Sabah holds logging rights in the forest reserves and
recently appointed at least three companies to log in the area.

EIA sought over logging plan

Show us the EIA report. This is the call by environmentalists
concerned over the proposed logging in the Malua and Ulu Segama
forest reserves covering 236,825ha in east Sabah. An environmental
impact assessment (EIA) report, they said, was necessary for such a
massive project and should be put to public scrutiny if it existed.

Logging at Sabah reserves to go ahead

Sabah will go ahead to log at two forest reserves bequeathed as
Malaysia’s biodiversity gift to the world once the Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) report is approved. The EIA report for
logging at the Malua and Ulu Segama forest reserves in the state’s
east coast has been completed. Whether it would be made public will
depend on the Department of Environment (DOE).

State Govt unlikely to back down on Malua, Ulu Segama

It is very unlikely that the State Government will withdraw its plan
to allow logging in the Malua and Ulu Segama forest reserves, home to
various endangered species, including wild orang-utans. Chief
Minister Datuk Seri Musa Aman also continued to insist that felling
of timber in the two areas would not damage the environment.

Okay, that takes care of Musa Aman. And this is only a fraction of
what I have written over the last three years mind you. If I compile
everything I have written thus far, I can fill the pages upon pages
of an entire book. Anyway, for more details, please see the
Chronology, Notes and Addendums in the section below. Now, for Musa
Hassan, I will just reveal some brief excerpts of what I have in my
possession. Trust me; this is also a mere fraction of the whole thing
and I am keeping the rest for when they come for me.

AKUAN BERKANUN DEEP THROAT TWO

2. Pada Mac 2005 jam 0030, saya bersama PPKG C/Insp. Mohd Shah Bin
Kamaluddin dan anggota telah melaksanakan tangkapan WTT terhadap Ah
Chai. Ketika itu saya nampak Ah Chai menelefon seseorang (panggilan
Dato’) dan bercakap dalam keadaan gelisah. Kemudian saya telah
menyemak nombor telefon orang yang bergelar Dato’ tersebut dan saya
dapati nombor telefon tersebut adalah kepunyaan YDH Tan Sri Ketua
Polis Negara yang ketika itu adalah Timbalan Ketua Polis Negara.

3. Pada Mac 2005 jam 0200, ketika sedang menguruskan tangkapan
terhadap Ah Chai di pejabat D7, IPD Kluang PPKG, C/Insp. Mohd Shah
ada beritahu kepada saya bahawa seorang pegawai dari IPK Johor, DSP
Tukiman ada menelefonnya dan mengatakan YDH Timbalan KPN meminta
supaya Ah Chai dibebaskan pada malam itu juga dan meminta pendapat
saya. Saya memberitahu kepada PPKG bahawa kita tidak boleh berbuat
demikian kerana repot tangkapan telah dibuat. Semasa dalam perjalanan
untuk menghantar Ah Chai ke penjara Air Molek, Ah Chai ada beritahu
kepada saya yang beliau hanya akan menjalani sekatan selama 6 bulan
sahaja. Saya dapati Ah Chai kelihatan tidak puas hati dengan saya
kerana membuka kes fail keatasnya.

4. Pada 08/03/2006, saya menyertai pasukan serbuan terhadap premis
bersama ASP Md. Yusof dan anggota dan telah berjaya menangkap 4 orang
termasuk isteri kedua Ah Chai nama Than Lee Poey dan merampas
peralatan perjudian ekor haram.

5. Pada 30/03/2007 jam 0100, Ah Chai bersama isteri keduanya serta PR
nama Ah Chin telah ditangkap dibawah Sek 3(1) Ordinan Darurat oleh
pegawai D7 IPK Johor, ASP Mior Fahim Bin Ahmad dan dibawa balik ke
IPK Johor untuk ditahan di sama selama 60 hari bagi meneruskan siasatan.

6. Pada 08/04/2007, saya dihubungi oleh sumber memberitahu Ah Chai
terlalu marah pada saya dengan menuduh saya membuka kes fail
keatasnya. Sumber memberitahu bahawa group Ah Chai akan menukarkan
saya ketempat lain.

7. Pada 07/05/2007, saya mendapat tahu melalui E-siar yang saya
ditukarkan ke Bahagian D4, JSJ Bukit Aman.

AKUAN BERKANUN DEEP THROAT THREE

2. Diantara Ogos dan September 2004, saya terima arahan dari KPP D7,
Bukit Aman melalui semboyan mengarahkan supaya kes fail AKT terhadap
salah seorang penganjur judi ekor haram di Kluang bernama Chai Ngew
atau nama panggilan Ah Chai. Saya arahkan D/Sjn Yassin untuk membawa
kes fail tersebut ke D7, Bukit Aman untuk tatapan YDH KPP D7, Bukit
Aman. YDH KPP D7 mengarahkan supaya kes fail tersebut dikemaskini
dengan segera.

3. Pada Mac 2005, Waran Tangkap dan Tahanan (WTT) terhadap Ah Chai
dikeluarkan oleh KKDN. WTT telah disempurnakan oleh PPKG Kluang, C/
Insp. Mohd. Shah Bin Kamaluddin dan Ah Chai kemudian dikenakan
tindakan buang daerah selama satu tahun setengah di bandaran Nilai,
Negeri Sembilan. Selepas 6 bulan dalam buangan, Ah Chai kemudian
telah dibebaskan setelah memenangi kes habeas corpus.

4. Pada September 2005, setelah dibebaskan Ah Chai dapati masih
meneruskan aktivitinya sebagai penganjur perjudian ekor haram di
kawasan Kluang. Pada 08/03/2006, hasil maklumat yang diberikan oleh
YDH Timbalan Ketua Polis Negara pada masa itu Dato’ Musa bin Hassan,
saya bersama sepasukan anggota D7, IPD Kluang telah menyerbu sebuah
‘Counting Center’ kepunyaan Ah Chai dan berjaya menangkap 4 orang
termasuk isteri kepada Ah Chai serta merampas peralatan penganjuran
judi ekor haram. Kemudian pada 18/03/2006, satu serbuan lagi telah
dibuat oleh D7, IPK Johor terhadap sebuah lagi ‘Counting Center’ juga
kepunyaan Ah Chai dan berjaya menangkap 5 orang pekerja dan merampas
peralatan judi ekor haram. Intelligent statement 9 tangkapan tersebut
telah diambil oleh PPKG dan anggota D7 saya dan kesemuanya menjurus
kepada aktiviti yang dijalankan oleh Ah Chai.

5. Pada 30/03/2007 jam 0100, Ah Chai bersama isteri keduanya serta PR
nama Ah Chin telah ditangkap dibawah Sek 3(1) Ordinan Darurat oleh
pegawai D7 IPK Johor, ASP Mior Fahim Bin Ahmad dan dibawa balik ke
IPK Johor untuk ditahan di sana selama 60 hari bagi meneruskan
siasatan (soal siasat). Saya berasa hairan kerana pihak JSJ, IPD
Kluang belum membuka kes fail yang baru terhadap sabjek yang
ditangkap dan percakapan risikan yang ada hanya berdasarkan 2 serbuan
terhadap counting center. Pihak D7, IPK Johor juga ada meminta
kersemua percakapan risikan sabjek yang dirakam oleh IPD Kluang
supaya dihantar ke D7, IPK Johor pada bulan Feb 2007. Saya juga
berasa hairan kenapa masih ada lagi tindakan terhadap Ah Chai
sedangkan dia baru saja dibebaskan dari sekatan di bawah AKT.

6. Pada 07/04/2007, saya terima panggilan telefon dari D7 Johor, DSP
Ng Fook Long bertanyakan kepada saya adakah Ah Chai, isterinya dan Ah
Chin dari group MIMI (salah satu penganjur judi ekor haram di kawasan
Kluang). Saya beritahu kepada DSP Ng, mereka bukan dari group MIMI
tetapi group Ah Chai sendiri.

7. Pada 08/04/2007, sehari selepas mereka dibebaskan saya telah
berjumpa Ah Chai di bandar Kluang dan telah berbual berkaitan
pembebasannya. Ah Chai berkata kepada saya yang dia tidak berpuas
hati terhadap saya kerana telah menganiayakannya. Saya bertanya
kepadanya bagaimana dia boleh bebas. Ah Chai beritahu ada seorang
kawannya (nama tidak diberitahu) baik dengan IGP sekarang. Saya
bertanya lagi kepada Ah Chai, adakah orang itu bernama Tengku, Ah
Chai hanya tersenyum sahaja. Sejak dari itu, saya merasakan bahawa
group Ah Chai mungkin bernaung dibawah group Tengku.

8. Pada Mei 2006, saya dipanggil oleh Supt. Navamany untuk berjumpa
beliau dan membawa 2 Kertas Siasatan berkaitan serbuan tersebut,
statistik serbuan dan kes fail. Dalam temuduga, soalan yang diajukan
kepada saya menjurus kepada percakapan risikan keatas sabjek-sabjek
yang ditangkap keatas 2 serbuan tersebut serta 3 kes fail terhadap Ah
Chai, isterinya dah Ah Chin. Saya merasakan persoalan yang diajukan
kepada saya mempertikaikan kesahihan percakapan risikan yang telah
diambil. Semasa itu, saya telah diarahkan bertukar ke IPD Kajang,
Selangor Sebagai KBLD. Pertukaran ini adalah merupakan sesuatu yang
tidak adil bagi saya kerana saya tidak pernah melakukan kesalahan
tatatertib mahupun prestasi tugas berdasarkan kejayaan-kejayaan yang
telah saya capai sepanjang tempoh saya bertugas sebagai KBSJD Kluang
dan saya rasa saya masih lagi berupaya dan mampu menyumbangkan tenaga
saya dalam JSJ. Dengan pertukaran saya ke bahagian Logistik saya
tidak dapat memberi kesinambungan dalam tugas saya untuk memerangi
jenayah.

MORE ON THE MUSA AMAN STORY

CHRONOLOGY

1) On 22 December 1994, Raykat Berjaya Sdn Bhd signed Re-logging
Agreements with four companies -- Kemudi Teguh Sdn Bhd, Nisbah Yakin
Sdn Bhd, Kurnia Pulangan Sdn Bhd and Perwira Harmoni (M) Sdn Bhd --
giving each company 17,000 hectares of logging concession (17,000
hectares X 4 companies) in the Gunung Rara/Kalabakan/Ulu Segama
Forest Reserve at a way below market price of RM50.00 per cubic meter
of logs extracted (See items ‘1’ to ‘4’ in the ADDENDUMS below).

Cancellation of Agreements with the same four companies -- Kemudi
Teguh Sdn Bhd, Nisbah Yakin Sdn Bhd, Kurnia Pulangan Sdn Bhd and
Perwira Harmoni (M) Sdn Bhd (See items ‘5’ and ‘6’ in the ADDENDUMS
below).

3) That same day, 15 February 1999, Sabah Softwoods Sdn Bhd signed a

1994. Therefore, the first Agreements were signed in a hurry just
five (5) days before his term of office expired.

2) Tun Sri Bernard Dompok was the Sabah Chief Minister until 14 March
1999 so the cancellation of the Agreements and the new Agreements
were signed one month before his term of office expired.

3) Musa Aman, the present Sabah Chief Minister, was the Director of
the Sabah Foundation, Treasurer of Umno Sabah, and later Minister in
charge of the Sabah Foundation.
