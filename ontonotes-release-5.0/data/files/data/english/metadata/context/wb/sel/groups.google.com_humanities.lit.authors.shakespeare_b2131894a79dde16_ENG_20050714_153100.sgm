Romeo and Juliet Act 4, Scene 4

CAPULET: Look to the BAKED MEATS, good Angelica:
Spare not for the cost.
------------------------------­­---------------------------
Hamlet (1603 Q1) Act 1, Scene 2

Ham.: Thrift, thrift, Horatio,
the funerall BAK'T MEATES
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables,
Would I had met my deerest foe in heauen
Ere EUER I had seene that day Horatio;
===============================================
Sing a song of SIXPENCE a pocket full of rye
[FOUR AND TWENTY] blackbirds Baked in a PIE
When the PIE was opened the birds began to sing
Was that not a DAINTY dish to set before a king?

The King was in his COUNTing house COUNTing out his money
The Queen was in the parlor eating bread and honey
The Maid was in the garden hanging out the clothes
When down came a blackbird and snapped off her nose!

&lt;&lt;This rhyme may be related to Henry VIII &amp; his 24 monasteries
away from the Monks of the Catholic Church after the reformation.

The Monks are the &quot;black birds&quot; and THE DEEDS TO THE MONASTERIES
WERE SUPPOSEDLY PLACED INSIDE A PIE AND GIVEN TO KING HENRY -

COOKS COULD TELL IF A PIE WAS DONE BY ITS SOUNDS OF
CRACKLING AND SINGING--MUCH LIKE THAT OF A BLACK BIRD.&gt;&gt;
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Winter's Tale Act 4, Scene 3
Clown: I cannot do't without COUNTers. Let me see; what
am I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
on. She hath made me [FOUR AND TWENTY] nose-gays for
the shearers, THREE-MAN-song-men all, and VERy good
ones; but they are most of them means and bases;
but one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
PIES; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger,
but that I may beg; four pound of prunes,
and as many of raisins o' the sun.

For glorious puddings &amp; immortal PIES.

LINES ON THE MERMAID TAVERN by John Keats

[H]ave ye tippled drink more fine

THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR Act 1, Scene 1

gentlemen, I hope we shall drink down all unkindness.

Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS

SLENDER: I had rather than forty shillings
I had my Book of Songs and Sonnets here.

How now, Simple! where have you been?
I must wait on myself, must I?
You have not the Book of Riddles about you, have you?

Titus Andronicus Act 5, Scene 3

TITUS ANDRONICUS:
Why, there they are both, baked in that PIE;
Whereof their mother DAINTily hath fed,
Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
'Tis TRUE, 'tis TRUE; witness my knife's sharp point.

Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. 1898. CAP-a-PIE.
The general etymology is the French CAP à PIEd,
but the French phrase is de PIEd en CAP.

&quot;Armed at all points exactly CAP-a-PIE.&quot; Hamlet, i. 2.
&quot;I am courtier, CAP-a-pe.&quot; Winter's Tale, iv. 3.

&amp; since We are told that CAP à PIE is Old French, but it would be
desirable to give a quotation from some old French author to verify
this assertion. I have hunted in vain for the purpose. Again, is PIE
Old French for PIEd? This is not a usual change. The usual change
would be PIEd into PIE. The Latin might be De CAPte and pedem.
------------------------------­------------------------------
The Taming of the Shrew Act 4, Scene 3

PETRUCHIO: Why, thou say'st TRUE; it is a paltry CAP,
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken PIE:

_Shakespeare In Fact_ by Irvin Matus p.49

&lt;&lt;Jonson's reference to his papers

&quot;Condemn'd. . .to the OVENs with the PIES;&quot;

is an allusion to the custom of putting paper under the bottom
of PIES during baking. In _Naps Upon Parnassus_(1658), a collection of
&quot;voluntary and jovial verses [by] some of the wits of universities,&quot;
its editor related his pains in reclaiming them from the keeper of
an alehouse where an author had left them: &quot;MUCH ADO I had to recoVER
them out of the good woman's hands, who left the bottoms of her
PIES in VERy great jeopardy for want of them: yet at last
I did get them, as many as you see there are of them.&quot;

John Warburton, the 18th-century Somerset Herald of the College
of Arms, claims to have entrusted the manuscripts of more than fifty
Renaissance plays to his cook, the notorious &quot;Betsy Baker.&quot;&gt;&gt;
------------------------------­------------------------------­-----------
&lt;&lt;The Least Successful Collector Betsy Baker played a central role in
the history of collecting. She was employed as a servant in the house
of John Warburton (1682-1759) who had amassed a fine collection of 58
1st edition plays, including most of the works of Shakespeare. One day
Warburton returned home to find 55 of them charred beyond legibility.
Betsy had either burned them or used them as PIE bottoms. The remaining
three folios are now in the British Museum. The only comparable literary
figure was the maid who in 1835 burned the manuscript of the first
volume of Thomas Carlyle's &quot;The History of the French Revolution&quot;,
thinking it was wastepaper.&gt;&gt; -- Stephen PI(l)E

[Some 60 manuscripts of plays of this period eventually come
into the hands of a collector named John Warburton* (1682-1759).
Many are the only surviving coPIES of plays that had never been
printed. Unfortunately Warburton* was careless with them and
his servant, Betsy Baker*, made use of them to light her stove
and line the bottom of PIES. In the end only three survived.
The surviving plays are the work of Dekker, Ford and Massinger.]

JAMES I: 46th REX DEUS/PRIORY of SION generation
/index.htm#s46b
------------------------------­------------------------------­---
In Psalm 46 (of the KING James &amp; only the KING James version):

&quot;shake&quot; is the 46th word from the beginning,
and &quot;spear&quot; is the 46th word from the end.
------------------------------­-----------------------------
Psalms 46

3.Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though
the mountains SHAKE with the swelling thereof. (Selah)

9. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth;
he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the SPEAR in sunder;
he BURNETH the CHARIOT in the FIRE.
------------------------------­------------------------------­-------

&lt;&lt;Look at some of the symbolic elements in the Waite *CHARIOT* Card?

What about that canopy thing with the stars? Now, what's
actually being represented by this canopy is what the Freemasons
called the 'Covering of the LODGE', otherwise known as
the 'clouded' or 'celestial' canopy. The stone and the
8-pointed star on the CHARIOTeer's head refer to the same idea?

the cube is 2 'cubed' or 8 = and that is the number of C-HETH,

the kabbalistic number of this card but also refers to
the Masonic 'ashlar' or the 'perfect ashlar'.

In Speculative Masonry an 'ashlar' is freestone as it comes out of
the quarry. A 'rough ashlar' is a stone in its 'rude &amp; unpolished'
condition =&gt; that is: ignorant, uncultivated &amp; vicious man.

But after one is 'smoothed &amp; polished' by education and one learns
to restrain (or 'temper') ones passions, he is represented
by the 'Perfect Ashlar', the smoothed &amp; squared stone,
fitted into its place in the TEMPLE or in the CHARIOT.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;MagPIE: A contraction of magotPIE, or magata-PIE.

&quot;Mag&quot; is generally thought to be a contraction of Margaret;
thus we have Robin red-breast, Tom-tit, Philip- i.e. a sparrow, etc.

MagPIEs. To see nine magPIEs is most unlucky.

Here is an old Scotch rhyme:

Five's a christening, six a death
Seven's heaven, eight is hell,

To signify thou camest to bite the world:
And, if the rest be TRUE which I have heard,

Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable. 1898. Cock and PIE.

We meet with cock's bones, cock's wounds, cock's mother, cock's
body, cock's passion, etc., where we can have no doubt that the word
is a minced oath, and stands for the sacred name which should never
be taken in vain. The PIE is the table or rule in the old Roman
offices, showing how to find out the service for each day,
called by the Greeks pi'nax (an index)

The latter part of the oath is equivalent to &quot;the Mass book.&quot;

&quot;By cock and PIE, sir, you shall not away tonight.&quot;

Wuthering Heights - Emily Bronte ** ( CHAPTER XXXI )

&lt;&lt;'No books!' I exclaimed. 'How do you contrive to live here
without them? if I may take the liberty to inquire. Though
provided with a large library, I'm frequently very dull at
the Grange; take my books away, and I should be desperate!'

'I was always reading, when I had them,' said Catherine; 'and
Mr. Heathcliff never reads; so he took it into his head to
destroy my books. I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks.
Only once, I searched through Joseph's store of theology,
to his great irritation; and once, Hareton, I came upon
a SECRET stock in your room - some Latin and Greek,
and some tales and poetry: all old friends.
I brought the last here - and you gathered them, as a magPIE
gathers silver spoons, for the mere love of stealing!
They are of no use to you; or else you concealed them in the
bad spirit that, as you cannot enjoy them, nobody else shall.
Perhaps YOUR envy counselled Mr. Heathcliff to rob me of
my treasures? But I've most of them written on my brain and
printed in my heart, and you cannot deprive me of those!'&gt;&gt;

Three Musketeers - Dumas

&lt;&lt;One day, when the king had HALTED to fly the magPIE, and the four
friends, according to their custom, instead of following the sport had
stopped at a cabaret on the high road, a man coming from la Rochelle on
horseback pulled up at the door to drink a glass of wine, and darted a
searching glance into the room where the four Musketeers were sitting.&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;The king, however, who sought distraction, while traveling as fast
as possible--for he was anxious to be in Paris by the twenty-third-
-stopped from time to time to fly the magPIE, a pastime for which
the taste had been formerly inspired in him by De Luynes,
and for which he had always preserved a great predilection.&gt;&gt;

THE WATER-LILY.

&lt;&lt;Having promised this, he joyfully returned home, and
as he was riding through the forest he could perfectly
understand all that the birds said. He heard a thrush say
to a magPIE: &quot;How stupid men are! they cannot understand
the simplest thing. It is now quite a year since the
maiden was transformed into a water-lily, and, though
she sings so sadly that anyone going over the bridge
must hear her, yet no one comes to her aid. Her former
bridegroom rode over it a few days ago and heard her
singing, but was no wiser than the rest.&quot;

&quot;And he is to blame for all her misfortunes,&quot; added
the magPIE. &quot;If he heeds only the words of men she will
remain a flower for ever. She were soon delivered were
the matter only laid before the old WIZARD of Finland.&quot;&gt;&gt;

all the magPIEs except one who had broken a leg and a wing.
The old woman sent after it at once, and when she questioned
the magPIEs the crippled one was the only one who knew where
the three bulrushes were.

Then the prince started off with the LAME magPIE.
They went on and on till they reached a great stone wall,
many, many feet high. 'Now, prince,' said the magPIE,
'the three bulrushes are behind that wall.'&gt;&gt;

Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll

Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her
pet: 'Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for catching
mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the
birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'
This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some
of the birds hurried off at once: one old MagPIE began wrapping
itself up very carefully, remarking, 'I really must be getting
home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!'
------------------------------­------------------------------­------
THE SIX HUNGRY BEASTS

Now the fox was particularly fond of young magPIEs, and he set
about making a plan by which he could have one for dinner.
At last he hit upon something which he thought would do, and
accordingly he sat down near the tree and began to stare hard at it.
'What are you looking at, Michael?' asked the magPIE,
who was watching him from a bough.
'I'm looking at this tree. It has just struck me what a good tree it
would be to cut my new snow-shoes out of.' But at this answer the
magPIE screeched loudly, and exclaimed: 'Oh, not this tree, dear
brother, I implore you! I have built my nest on it, and my young
ones are not yet old enough to fly.'
'It will not be easy to find another tree that would make such good
snow-shoes,' answered the fox, cocking his head on one side, and
gazing at the tree thoughtfully; 'but I do not like to be
ill-natured, so if you will give me one of your young ones
I will seek my snow-shoes elsewhere.'
Not knowing what to do the poor magPIE had to agree, and flying
back, with a heavy heart, he threw one of his young ones out of the
nest. The fox seized it in his mouth and ran off in triumph, while
the magPIE, though deeply grieved for the loss of his little one,
found some comfort in the thought that only a bird of extraordinary
wisdom would have dreamed of saving the rest by the sacrifice of
the one. But what do you think happened? Why, a few days later,
Michael the fox might have been seen sitting under the very same
tree, and a dreadful pang shot through the heart of the magPIE
as he peeped at him from a hole in the nest.
'What are you looking at?' he asked in a trembling voice.
'At this tree. I was just thinking what good snowshoes
it would make,' answered the fox in an absent voice,
as if he was not thinking of what he was saying.
'Oh, my brother, my dear little brother, don't do that,' cried
the magPIE, hopping about in his anguish. 'You know you promised
only a few days ago that you would get your snow-shoes elsewhere.'
'So I did; but though I have searched through the whole forest,
there is not a single tree that is as good as this. I am very sorry to
put you out, but really it is not my fault. The only thing I can do
for you is to offer to give up my snow-shoes altogether if you will
throw me down one of your young ones in exchange.'
And the poor magPIE, in spite of his wisdom, was obliged to throw
another of his little ones out of the nest; and this time he was
not able to console himself with the thought that
he had been much cleverer than other people.
He sat on the edge of his nest, his head drooping and his feathers
all ruffled, looking the picture of misery. Indeed he was so
different from the gay, jaunty magPIE whom every creature in the
forest knew, that a crow who was flying past, stopped to inquire
what was the matter. 'Where are the two young ones
who are not in the nest?' asked he.
'I had to give them to the fox,' replied the magPIE in a
quivering voice; 'he has been here twice in the last week,
and wanted to cut down my tree for the purpose of making
snow-shoes out of it, and the only way I could buy him off
was by giving him two of my young ones.'
Oh, you fool,' cried the crow, 'the fox was only trying to frighten
you. He could not have cut down the tree, for he has neither axe
nor knife. Dear me, to think that you have sacrificed your young
ones for nothing! Dear, dear! how could you be so very foolish!'
And the crow flew away, leaving the magPIE overcome with shame
and sorrow.
The next morning the fox came to his usual place in front of the
tree, for he was hungry, and a nice young magPIE would have suited
him very well for dinner. But this time there was no cowering,
timid magPIE to do his bidding, but a bird with his head erect
and a determined voice.
'My good fox,' said the magPIE putting his head on one side and
looking very wise--'my good fox, if you take my advice, you will
go home as fast as you can. There is no use your talking about
making snow-shoes out of this tree, when you have neither knife
nor axe to cut it down with!'
'Who has been teaching you wisdom?' asked the fox, forgetting
his manners in his surprise at this new turn of affairs.
'The crow, who paid me a visit yesterday,' answered the magPIE.
'The crow was it?' said the fox, 'well, the crow had better not
meet me for the future, or it may be the worse for him.'
