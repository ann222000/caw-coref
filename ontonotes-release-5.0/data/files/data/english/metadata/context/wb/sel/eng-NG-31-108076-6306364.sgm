I've been reading a lot of posts from some people defending Kung Fu
and others attacking it.
Besides being confused as why someone often posts links to videos that
show no kung fu practitioners while (I think?) trying to defend Kung
Fu , I am intrigued by comments something like "some bjj action...no
kung fu to speak of". So now I ask, amid all these home made movies
that are labeled by someone as being something like ,Ice Dragon style
versus Mantis lotus flower bjj, but look like they've been filmed by
someone using a 1998 cell phone, what would I look for in a video that
would make people jump up and say "Look there...right there ...Kung
Fu!"

I question this because often statements are made to the effect of "I
see some karate there..but no kung fu" while discussing the vids.

It's pretty simple. Let's say that kung fu is like a Ford Model T.

The Ford Model T was the first (mass-produced) car. All other cars
that are on the road today look somewhat similar to the Model T.
Therefore they are the same.

Even though most people realise that modern day cars are technically
better in virtually every aspect and more efficient to produce there
are still some people believing that the original Model T was
superior.

You might have to pay a huge amount if you want to buy a Model T
today, but its value would be based on historical or sentimental
value, and not on its value as a means of transport.

Conclusion: to some people every car is a Model T. Other people see
the difference between a modern day Porsche and an old timer.

First you have to understand that kung fu does not only refer to a
"style" of fighting but also refers to ways of training the body and
the skills accquired from doing so. For example, if you see a guy
walking down the street and his hands have callouses all over the
knuckles, you can bet he hits makiwara. If you by chance meet a friend
on the street, does he always see you first? Those could be signs that
he has some level of training. So, much of kung fu doesen't look like
much of anything.

Beyond this, there are many styles in kung fu, each one having many
katas or forms which they might practice. It mainly looks like
everything else as yumyum said, since it's all inter-related. As a
matter of fact many arts have the exact same training forms in them.
You also get he occasional art which is the exact same as something
else but with a different name, or with the exact same name but looks
completely different.

It often takes more than a few years of experience before you can look
at a random performance and say "he does x".

If there's not much to see then what you're seeing is more likely to be real
Kung Fu. Â You'd most likely see one of them fall down, perhaps inexplicably,
very likely put down to a "lucky" shot.

Ok...calluses on hands...beyond that what you've told me is that only
a practitioner of Kung Fu can tell when someone else is a practitioner
of Kung Fu.

Seriously. Is that all that can be said? I can watch fights and often
know what the background of each fighter is. Knee and elbow
strikes...often muay thai...good sprawl and avoiding
takedowns...wrestler, knowledge of the guard and submissions...jiu
jitsu, punches and barely any kicking...boxing, standing at the end of
a fight with hands held in the air in victory...Mixed martial Arts.

Aren't you just adding to the claims that it is all just mysticism
when nothing concrete can be listed?

Lots of concrete things can be listed, but giving you a list would be
meaningless. For example, you mention knee and elbow strikes. However
a knee strike is one of the first martial arts applications you learn
in Tai Chi too, nevermind muay thai. Every martial art system I ever
studied taught knee strikes. So if I told you that an elbow strike
might mean he did any of 14 different arts, what point would that
serve?

If you are interested in knowing what kung fu looks like, you should
check out some kung fu schools in your area and see if you like what
you see. If not, then it wasn't meant to be :)

This is all getting pretty damn ridiculous. Apparently, Kung Fu is
*only* those listed techniques combined with Explosive Power (tm).

Where is the recorded history of the dreaded Kung Fu practictioners
using all of their dreaded techniques? Where is even any anecdotal

Any time a Kung fu guy loses, he wasn't a Kung Â Fu guy.

If you don't read Chinese, or enjoy Chinese friends, you could read
something like 'Asian Fighting Arts' by Donn Draeger. Unless you're prepared
to assert that everybody is lying, hypnotized, part of some secret oriental
conspiracy or gullible damnedfools, he's well attributed/footnoted. That's
just one of the general survey sources- you can get as authoritative as
you're willing to research.

I would want to see something resembling the structure they use when
training forms or applications, and quite frankly, I never see it -
well, the one exception being CLF guys who throw those big John Wayne
hooks, but that's about it.

I don't care what techniques they use - plenty of reasons why they
might not EMFG or anything like that - but I *do* want to see some of
their training come through.

Unfortunately, what I see is really poor-quality kickboxing. Â The
style does not survive exposure to pressure.

I'll go to bat and say I'm more than capable of recognize linguistic

Not sure why you go to so much effort and use so many words to
basically call me stupid and ignorant.
So let me question your response. Where do you find fault with my
linguistic capabilities? As to being paustic, well I've looked that
up, and while I do not feign to have YOUR years of experience, paucit
is hardly the proper word to describe me.

So you're hurt...or something...or old...or young...or whatever. Â I
don't really care. I'd not disrespect you like you did me. You don't
know anything about me.

Back to what you wrote.

"Particularly with as flaccid a definition as you people cobble up. "

Ok. Give me your definition.

Please use , in your own words, " intellectual rigor, there are a
string of words that more
specifically define the practice. "

To me it seems that you make an extended effort to patronize and
dismiss, while, with your high level of intelligence you could simply
inform.

How about lighting a candle instead of cursing the darkness?

Why do you make statements that seem to have the intention of solely
attributing a point of view to someone, when no such link is
warranted? Specifically, another person posted a comment about people
making a simple subject complicated, and you respond "Remind me of the
'simplicity' of the Chinese culture, say; over the last
4,000 years or so."

I don't recall him, or anyone else for that matter, saying that the
chinese culture was simple.

So, looking at your responses, here is apparently what I should look
for when considering if a person is a Kung Fu stylist.
1. dreaded emfg
2. groin strikes
3. trachea-crush,
4. entrances through the throat, armpit, groin, anus
5. headbutts
6. small-bone manipulations
7. bladder attacks
8. rabbit-punches

I have so much paucity of experience, or perhaps paucity of
intelligence Â that I do not know what the "dreaded emfg" is.
Could you please inform me?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;From that list it seems to me kung fu is a realistic, real world, self
">

defense at any cost type of technique. I am not sure what is meant by
"entrances through the armpit". Â With your hand? How does one practice
this?

Since we're talking about Kung Fu, I was watching it on t.v. last
night. Â Still strikes me as funny how every time someone Â meets
Carradine they always say something to the effect "Hey chinaman, get
away from there." Â He looks SOO chinese.

While I'm here, Renli...please give me your list. You say "Lots of
concrete things can be listed, but giving you a list would be
meaningless."

I don't think so. Â I'd like to know. Since lots of concrete things CAN
be listed, please do so.

It shouldn't be meaningless. As an example let me give you a list of
thing I look for when I am trying to determine If a food Â choice is
"mexican". And by mexican I mean the mexican food that Americans eat.
Here is the list...
1. Hot peppers, often jalepenos.
2. Meat products are typically beef,pork, or chicken.
3. Flatbreads typically known as tortillas are used, either flour or
corn are often used to contain other foods.
4. Cheese, generally from cows.
5. Rice in these dishes is typically the "spanish" variety.

Now, china also has spicy foods, and they use wraps. But using the
above list, I could probably determine if a food was either mexican or
chinese. And more importantly I could also dismiss a pierogi, for
example, as not being a mexican food. The list, as individual
entities, is meaningless. Together they help define what mexican is.

So...give me a list of what to look for when determining if a fighter
is a Kung Fu practitioner.

Ignorance on MY part? I ask what Kung Fu is and I am deemed ignorant
as a label?
My God is this newsgroup just full of people who are intolerant of
people asking a simple question?
I see a huge chain of posts discussing what whether this fighter or
that fighter is a kung fu practitioner
and I ask what defines one art as Kung Fu, what aspects of fighting do
they incorporate and/or encompass and I get labeled as ignorant.
Well...better to be ignorant than as "enlightened" as you. Â Do you
actually study any martial arts? I find it hard to believe ANY martial
art school would encourage such an attitude. Well, perhaps you belong
to Cobra Kai school from the first Karate Kid.
I see that you and others make the effort to insult people, but never
any effort to answer a question.
Let me ask again. What defines Kung fu as a style? What tell tale
things could I see in a fighter that would identify him as a Kung Fu
stylist.
Hoping to get a better answer than, Kung fu is kung fu.

I don't see where all this contention about all the "various" Kung
Fu's is meant to convey.

Certainly everyone understands, at the very least in a general sort of
way, what a person is referring to when they use the term Kung Fu. I
thing everyone here has used the term loosely Â many many times before,
and likewise will use it in the future.

The term is currently part of our vernacular. Certainly it might be
appropriate to define it in that respect. If you would like to state
that the term is used in a generic way, a generic definition should be
applicable as well.

If specific subcategories are preferred, than those subcategories
would be defineable as well.

&gt; Fu , I am intrigued by comments something like &quot;some bjj action...no

I agree that these posts are confusing... And I am by no means
defending them.

Like I said China has a long history, and it is a vast country so what
is in kung fu is proportionally so I would assume.

I've trained in various MA over time and have seen many things that
are not on video, Â I trained some in chinese MA and have definitely
cross trained with people who had some kung fu backgrounds..

Since there is a book called chin-na in groundfighting I would imagine
that there is somewhere in china or their history some groundfighting
techniques. Â I know for sure that some kung fu schools spar, and have
had standing grappling defenses prior to any UFC-attrocities, or judo
globalization -and have had simple ground defenses against say for
instances mount or schoolboy pin and other simple stuff like that. -
It's called wrestling. Â Mongolian wrestling for instance is still
chinese and probably could have influenced or challenged kung fu ...
Judo's main throwing influence kito-ryu claims its origins to be
chinese. Â I have seen various single leg takedown's in taijiquan just
with different emphasis on what aspect of the throw is being used than
say in judo... Â So I guess that to define kung fu itself it would be
inclusive for everything that called itself that in china.

Because there is so much that is likely in kung fu a kung fu stylist
would Ideally be omniscient in all the styles of kung fu or more
likely be proficient in a verifyable style of kung fu...

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;So now I ask, amid all these home made movies

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

People who usually define themselves as "BJJ/MMA" practioners(who may
not study ma in realife at all) have posted bogus clips of people who
would best be defined as typical foreignized karate and called it kung
fu.

And often the people posting these clips tend to be acting more like
stealth marketers...

The "aikido vs MMA" clip is entirely bogus too. Â Or at least both of
them are MMA guys since both practitioners have mixed backgrounds and
since neither are black or red belts in mainline aikido.

This is one of the reasons that I (personally) have really been trying
to shy away from using the term. Recently I've used it sort of to
parody what other people are saying or to try to explain the lack of
logic behind using the term.

But you're exactly right. My own personal aversion of the term stems
from feeling the need to start a discussion on the history of chinese
martial arts as a whole every time someone mis-lables something as
"kung fu", in a spastic attempt at "kung fu apologetics". I think the
only way to escape such discussions is to get people to understand
that "kung fu" is a useless term, and it's dangerous even to re-define
it "in english" to mean "chinese martial arts".

2. kung fu is not a useful term.

Use something else. If you mean wing chun, then say wing chun kuen -

Ok. Interesting. You are the author who was using the term kung fu all
over the place. I'll stop using it (perhaps you should?). I now
understand it is a nonsense term. Since I don't practice Kung fu I
apparently don't have the right to use it, even when asking others to
define it.If I see a school advertising itself as such i'll be sure to
tell them as well. Hmm...what to do about the magazines I saw at the
bookstore. Â Hmm...the word China encompasses a lot of cultures,
dialects, and dynasties. Probably need to be real specific when using
that term. If for example I refer to Chinese history, I might mean
actually before the Chin dynasty. Well THAT certainly can't be
acceptable! Â Oh wait, people who know about chinese history aren't as
sensitive and outlandishly insulting as these people. When I, in my
foolish past, used the term "Kung Fu" what I thought I was meaning was
something akin to, any of the fighting arts or styles originating in
the part of the world commonly known,to english speaking people, as
China.

Stop using it ill-advisedly; it means what it means.
It has been used as a generic term for 'Chinese martial arts' by the
shallowly informed- mostly by the influence of the tv show of the name.
It is completely 'non-specific' to the hundreds of martial systems practiced
in China or elsewhere. The only attribute they have in-common is their

That's what folks have told you all along-
kung fu can describe a 'chuan fa', a 'wu shu', a 'wu kung'- and any number
of other disciplines, both of martial art and of other endeavors.
A discription of martial art as 'kung fu' conveys little or no information
at all.

After some thought.... The defenition you can use is a contextual one
based upon the style in question. Therefore while it is safe to say
that someone practising wing chun kuen might have wing chun kung fu,
or that someone practising tai chi might have tai chi kung fu, it is
incorrect to say that they are practising kung fu.

However - schools and magazines have to make money, and kung fu has
become something of a banner which is used in friendly and nonfriendly
ways depending on what martial arts community you're a part of. Yes I
realise this sounds very similar to a certain other "community" but
it's all just a form of social dynamics or linguistics or semantics or
whatever.

Let me give you an example. And mind you this was fifteen years ago. I
asked my sifu (and he was a white guy) if he had any more copies of
inside kung fu magazine that I could borrow or read. I asked because I
saw a couple copies on the coffee table in the foyer of our school. He
told me that the magazines were crap and that he had canceled his
subscriptions years ago, that they never contained any useful
information for someone who really did martial arts.

I've never quite found the need to completely agree with him on that,
but you could postulate that he was right quite easily :)

What does Kung Fu look like?

First off, you would have to know a certain style of
KungFu to ascertain that.

For example, Wing Chun looks and functions very differently
from Hung Gar. Â Each may have some simular techniques in
it, but thier whole delievery, rulesets, and more may
be different. Â Also, the very type of training per
technique may varry.

When people see a Practitioner that says he is
using Wing Chun... and when you view thier fight, and
see little to no Wing Chun movements in his fighting,
then you know something isnt right. Â  This is one
reason you get "Wheres the KungFu?".

Now, its not just a lack of techniques seen... but
also improperly done techniques. Â Such as a fighter
who has no 'Rooting'. Â They are easily spotted by
the people who practice the art, because its a
very basic thing.

Many clues show experience in a fighter. Â But will
you be able to spot and tell the difference between
poor KungFu and Great KungFu? Â Not unless you have
studied its movments and principles of the styles.

KungFu can look just like any other art in some
cases. Â It can even look like typical boxing
"IF" the rules of it are applied correctly,
and if its limited in its scope of types of
attacks and defenses limited.

Punches still are punches. Kicks are still
kicks. Â The main differeces may be in the training
of these - for superior results. Â Or it could be
a small varience in weight, angles, start position, end
postion, rules on when to use it, when not to
use it... and more. Â  Some of these are visible to the
naked eye.. but many are not easily seen as differnt
by the unknowing.

A lot of the differences in some KungFu styles
are in fact the actual blocking systems. Â Using
much more complex ways to deflect incomming strikes...
as well as the complex methods of training this
system. Â  Not to mention, the rules and principles
of it all... which are based on pure science.

Anyway, unless you do your homework, you arent
really going to understand to any real degree
what Real KungFu is... let alone, any other art
other than what you currently study.

So you're comparing against styles that are already derided as 'diluted'?
That doesn't seem fair.
One of the major differences between our silat and that of some modern-day
practitioners in Java is that my teachers were trained before WWII, and left
Indonesia right after the war. Sukarno came to power and virtually outlawed
the traditional art because they had been the source of the Resistance
against the Japanese, hence a threat to the despot.
When I cite the capabilities of an art/system, I tend to cite the best, not

That clip was a joke. Â Dont know where they found that those clowns,

have at least knocked that one guy down. Â Psooibly causing some ankle
injury. Â  The next guy was ridiculs. Â  The 3rd guy, they didnt show
enough to make a real comparison. Â Ive seen clips of it where the
3rd guy fights a bit longer, and starts to catch the timing of the
karate guy... but just as it starts to get interesting, they
stop the fight. Â  The show is a japanese show, and they surely

I found the Handi Challenge.
(my news program isnt retaining for some odd reason)

Look spretty solid Â "If" followed to exact detail.

I have concern about one thing you said. Â The wood thickness
and dimensions should be ok.. but with it being settled on
a giving surface, you may lose a bit of effect.

I believe this is a little more than just hand conditoning,
as when you strike, your entire wrist, and arm bones..etc. are
going to take major energy. Â  To strengthen them, will require
good solid hits. Â  My thinking is that he recomended bag
work for this very fact.

A warning about bag work... Â  for a canvas bag, it will tear
your knuckles to sh*t. Â Your hands will bleed, and crack, and
be really aten up... Â especially if the bag spins when youve
struck. Â If you keep at it, you will eventually get to a point
where they wont bleed much if at all... but, that process is
a but brutal, and will take 3 weeks to a month I believe. Â It
might also hamper progress, because you may need healing time.

If possible, pick up canvas sand bag at your local martial
arts store, such as this:

http://www.wle.com//products/m0811.html

Over-Fill (buldging) with typical beach sand (make
sure to filter it so that there arnt any forign
pieces of wood and things in there... or, get some
sand from the Hardware/Home shops.)

Such a thing mounted vertically to a solid wall,
wont spin when you hit it, so you can do much more
without tearing everything up.

Also, you wont have to wait for a swing-rebond, meaning,
faster progress. Â Plus, you will build up a more
solid connection on each strike. Â This will help
condition and strenghten your internal structure.

I recomend at very LEAST 5 minutes a day on the
sandbag with your single hand (in addition
to the other stuff). You could probably do this
every other day, and increase the durration just a
few minutes.

You might also grab some "Dit Da Jow" to use
as a topical before you start.

IMOP, Â I recomned limmited distance strikes from
no further than the body side. Â From chest to
target should suffice.. Â but you can also add
shoulder and hip turn in there to really add
Ummphh once youve progressed far enough.
Start the strikes very loose, fast, then tighten
the body,arm,fist very hard when deep impact occurs.

Sure, you could Â remain tight the entire time.. but
learning to be loose beforehand will gain faster
acceleraion as well as not using as much energy.

Have fun,
Steve

&gt; Â A warning about bag work... Â  for a canvas bag, it will tear

&gt; be really aten up... Â especially if the bag spins when youve
&gt; struck. Â If you keep at it, you will eventually get to a point
&gt; where they wont bleed much if at all... but, that process is
&gt; a but brutal, and will take 3 weeks to a month I believe. Â It
&gt; might also hamper progress, because you may need healing time.

I thank you for the time and energy you spent in giving me that
additional information, but again, I want to try to see results from a
minimal program. I don't have the time available right now for a
larger regimen.

The biggest problem I have is that I did so many varried things
to attain the results that I got personally. Â Its hard to nail
it down to just a few things. Â Still, I believe his instructions
have good merrit to at least get you to a certain level. Â Probably
the level you will feel fine with... in accordance with your
time limitations.

Smacking is good...but you also need the punches too Imop.
In fact, if you read carfully:

**Start by punching the palm of one hand with the fist of the other.**

He wants solid heavy (as you progress) punches from each hand to the
opposite target hand. Â (Ugg, I just realized you cant do that, else
you jeapordize the control :P Â  This is a problem, because you need
that additional type of drill. Â Maybe you could use another Person
as a control? Â I cant come up with anything else.. except maybe a
pipe with some foam insulation arround it. Â Not sure it will have
that same 'blunt force' effect)

Then, he adds:

***Using a nearby hard surface, stiffly rap your knuckles about 100
times.

So that part is the Rapping part. Â Completely seperate from the
strike part. Â Each works a certain aspect to the training, and
gives different results. Â The sum total of both, is what you are
after.

He adds:

**as you progress, work on making your fist denser, harder, the blows
more solid- cultivate a "heavy hand" in this training. **

At this point, it says "fist", so one I dont think he is
refering to the rapping there. Â So, either hes talking
more about when you hit your own hands... or, hes meaning: to
punch the solid object, instead of rappping it.

The rapping is usually just to get started. Usually, you start
Punching when you no longer really feel the rapping, or barely feel it.

The punches are basically like rapping at first. Â Just light and
hitting squarely. Â Later, increase power and intensity.

Once you get to a certain level of hitting your own hands,
you may reach a plateu. (when theres not really much pain at all)
Then you move on to just hitting other things. Â Such as doing a
hard open palm strike to a solid wall or flat surface as hard
as you can stand it.

lol! Â  I didnt even go that far Â heh. Â Always thought that was
a bit too extreme for my needs. Â  :)

Yeah, it will be fine without it. Â Ive heard that it helps to
reduce injuries and help heal things up faster. Â I rarely used it
myself actually. Â Only twords the end when I started to hit the
bag with metal bbs, did I really start to use it heavily.

Ohh, I forgot to mention diet. Â May want to drink a bit
more milk if you do not already. Â Or maybe cheese or
anything else with good calcium levels. Â Cut the soda, as I hear
it weakens bones. Â And no drinking alchol either :P Â  As that
may also have a negative effect on your progress levels, in
such a short timeframe.

Breath out on the strikes.
Breathing sync will help circulation, and add to the effects. Â As it
will swell the areas will blood, and higher oxegen content. Â There are
probably many other effects from this.. but are surely beyond my
understanding.

You may notice, before an Irom Palm guy breaks something.. he
will do an Isometric like movement with his arms, while
doing intense deep breaths. Â You could possibly swap that out for
something else that gets the heart pumping.. such as squats or jumping
up/down a few times in a row.

No prob. Â Hope that helps.

Happy Hitting
:)
