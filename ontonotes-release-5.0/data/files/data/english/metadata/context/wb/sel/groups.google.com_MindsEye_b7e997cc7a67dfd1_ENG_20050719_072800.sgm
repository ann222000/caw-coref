The following are excerpts taken from the first chapter of
Kierkegaard's book &quot;Works of Love.&quot; I've chosen to quote him directly
instead of paraphrasing him because he says it so much better than I,
or anyone else can. I did not quote the best quotes, I choose quotes
that summed up what he was saying and were short, if you really want to
get the jest of what he's saying you need to read the whole chapter.
The guy is a genius. But I'll see how this goes and if it sparks a lot
of conversation and you guys like this stuff, I'll do this for each
chapter in the book. Enjoy!

I. Love's Hidden Life and Its Recognizability by Its Fruits

Luke 6:44. Every tree is known by its own fruit, for figs are not
gathered from thorns, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush.

&quot;If it were so...that we should believe nothing that we cannot see with
our physical eyes, then we first and foremost ought to give up
believing in love.&quot;

&quot;We can be decieved by believing what is untrue, but we certainly are
also decieved by not believing what is true.&quot;

&quot;To defraud oneself of love is the most terrible, is an eternal loss,
for which there is no compensation either in time or eternity.&quot;

&quot;the self-decieved person thinks that he is able to console
himself...That he 'has ceased to sorrow' we shall not deny, but of what
benefit is that when it would be to his salvation to begin in earnest
to sorrow over himself!&quot;

&quot;What perishes blossoms, and what blossoms perishes, but something that
'is' cannot be sung about--it must be believed and it must be lived.&quot;

&quot;The life of the plant is hidden; the fruit is the manifestation. The
life of thought is hidden; the expression of it is the manifestation.&quot;

&quot;The suffering is always most painful when the physician is compelled
to cut and penetrate into the more vital and therefore the hidden parts
of the body; likewise suffering is also the most painful and also the
most pernicious when someone, instead of being gladdened by love in its
manifestations, wants to take delight in fathoming it, that is, in
disturbing it.&quot;

&quot;Even if a particular, specific manifestation of love, even a main
shoot, were out of love pressed back into painful concealment, the same
life of love will find another expression for itself and still be
recognizable by its fruits...And perhaps these very fruits, the ones
matured by the quiet fire of a hidden pain, become the most precious.&quot;

&quot;Your friend, your beloved, your child, or whoever is an object of your
love has claim of an expression of it also in words if it actually
moves you inwardly. The emotion is not your possession but belongs to
the other; the expression is your debt to him, since in the emotion you
indeed belong to him who moves you and you become aware that you belong
to him.&quot;

&quot;By words and platitudes as the sole fruit of love, it is known that a
person has prematurely torn off the leaves and thust he gets no fruit,
not to mention something more terrible, that sometimes the deceiver is
known by his very words and platitudes. Thus immature and deceitful
love is known by this, that words and platitudes are its only fruit.&quot;

&quot;There is no word in human language, not one single one, not the most
sacred one, about which we are able to say: If a person uses this word,
it is unconditionally demonstrated that there is love in that
person...There is no work, not one single one, not even the best, about
which we can unconditionally say: The one who does this unconditionally
demonstrates love by it.&quot;

&quot;Yet it remains firm that love is to be known by its fruits. But those
sacred words of that text are not said to encourage us to get busy
judging one another; they are rather spoken admonishingly to the single
individual, to you, my listener, and to me, to encourage him not to
allow his love to become unfruitful but to work so that it 'could' be
known by its fruits, whether or not these come to be known by others.&quot;

&quot;If mistrust can actually see something as less than it is, then love
also can see something as greater than it is.&quot;

&quot;Like is known only by like; only someone who abides in love can know
love, and in the same way his love is to be known.&quot;

You've picked another beauty, Kierkecraig. I'd definitely be
interested in seeing more!

&quot;The life of the plant is hidden; the fruit is the manifestation. The
life of thought is hidden; the expression of it is the manifestation.&quot;

Love that. There is a phrase in my husband's &quot;Chumash&quot; that I love
that this reminds me of, from a Sabbath song: &quot;L'chah Dodi&quot;
&quot;the end of deed is first in thought.&quot;

Thanks for posting that Kierkegaard, Craig. Of course, to put it into
context, I will have to bring in some of his influences; namely Plato,
Socrates, and Aristotle. I will also bring in Nietzsche, since he
disagrees almost entirely with the lot of them! I will touch upon Jack
Kerouac and also The Magnetic Fields (the band), as they also have
interesting things to say on the subject of love too.

Love, as it was practiced by the ancient Greeks, was &quot;Eros&quot;; a sexual,
pagan, love. This is different from, but complimented by, &quot;Agape&quot;; a
form of spiritual love. Nietzsche, however, believed that sexuality
pervaded all spirituality--even at the highest level. He celebrates
Eros and thinks all philosophy has its erotic touch. In the
'Symposium', Socrates tells us that Eros is really a kind of longing.
For Plato and Socrates this was a longing for truth and beauty itself;
the reaching out for something beyond ones self.

In ancient Greece, Eros and Agape were originally complimentary
terms--much like the Apollonian and Dionysian were (although more in
the earlier Greece of Homer). Back on topic... St. Paul and the early
Christian church managed to vulgarize Eros. It became nothing but
sexual desire. It became selfish and grasping. Meanwhile, Agape was
spiritualized, etherealized, and turned into something that had
nothing to do with sex or longing (Eros) at all. Agape got transformed
into pure generosity; pure love. Ultimately, it often became something
only of God.

As I said, the distinction was never so sharp to the Greeks.

Plato's 'Symposium', probably the greatest work ever written on love,
tells us quite a lot about Eros and how important it was. It had a
social structure and some domesticity. It was of marriage and family.
It was romantic love (although that is not what the Greeks would have
called it that). Plato, through Socrates, starts to de-sexualize love
through Eros. Friendship is considered to be the highest form of love.
This is something Aristotle later picked up on in his treatise on
ethics; in fact it's probably the single longest section of the book.
He called it &quot;philia&quot; if you want to Google it.

Christian love, by contrast to Eros, doesn't emphasize
friendship—though sometimes it emphasises a more abstract notion of
&quot;brotherhood&quot;—and the worst thing is it this tends to be completely
devoid of flesh and blood tangibles. I'll get to this layer of
abstraction in a minute.

Plato gives a number of other views on love in the 'Symposium'.

One part mocks the playwright Aristophanes (a bit of revenge for his
mate Socrates, who was earlier mocked in the play 'The Clouds' by
Aristophanes). Plato, as well as giving him a bout of the hiccups, has
him recount a ludicrous mystical tale about the origin of love. The
story goes something like this:

In pre-historic times humans were more perfect. They were bigger,
stronger, had twice the number of arms, legs, and also two heads.
Because humans were so perfect their arrogance angered Zeus, who then
split them all into two parts; making them run around for the rest of
their lives looking for their other half. From here we have the notion
that love completes us or makes us whole--it gives us this notion of
reunification. Love is nothing less than the metaphysical desire to
complete ourselves as human-beings.

Nietzsche rejects this. He finds much to criticize in the merging or
fusion between two persons. He objects to the idea that we cannot be
complete within ourselves. He also objects to the submerging of one
person into another and the loss identity. Even if you have a more
egalitarian view of things there is this sense that this view of life
robs a person of their most important quality; their identity. D.H.
Lawrence, who was hugely inspired by Nietzsche, has a slightly
different take on this: in 'Women In Love' he describes two people in
love as pole stars; two stars that have their Independence, but are
inextricably tied together. The Popguns wrote, though never released,
a song entitled 'Two Stars' and wonder if that was a reference to
Lawrence? That a nice poetic idea, but it's ultimately nonsense I
think. I digress...

The second view Plato offers in the 'Symposium' is from Socrates:

Socrates says that when we are young and immature and fall in love for
the first time, what strikes us most is the beauty of another person.
There are many facets, but, in particular, the beauty of another
person's body is what most attracts us. As we mature we start to
desire their beauty as a person; body and soul. Even so, this is also
immature. As we go through life and have various relationships and
crushes we--if we have philosophical wisdom--realise it is not a
specific person's beauty that attracts us; rather it is beauty itself.
Therefore, when you fall in love, what you really long for is the form
of &quot;beauty as such&quot;. Socrates, cheeky chap that he is, says that the
ideal lover must therefore be the philosopher! &quot;Philosopher&quot;, to take
its Pythagorean origin, means the love of wisdom, and so this has to
be considered a form of erotic love (Eros).

Nietzsche rejects this also (surprise!). He does so because Socrates
has set up an ethrealization of love. Socrates, he says, has removed
love from being a relationship between two flesh and blood
human-beings to something more abstract and more distant. And it's
only a short step, as Nietzsche loves to point out, from this view of
platonic love and the Christian view of God. Why? Because one might
say, as Socrates does, that one may only love another by way of an
intermediary; beauty as such and good itself. So too in Christianity
one loves another person only as an intermediary to get to God. In the
middle-ages this gets an name and, not too surprisingly, it is
&quot;platonic love&quot;. This does not merely mean a friendship without sex,
it means something much more profound: one can love another person as
a way of loving God. A dangerously false precedent, if you ask me;
though Nietzsche leaves that one hanging. Nietzsche, I believe,
rejects any notion of the otherworldly and finds the idea that we do
love another person directly, but rather a spiritualized, abstract,
concept, to be disgusting and false.

Love, I think, can be many things to many people. One of my favourite
bands, The Magnetics Fields, released an album in 1999 called '69 Love
Songs' that perfectly demonstrates this. It's a 3 CD box set with
(surprise!) 69 love songs, covering love as: giddy lust ('Let's
Pretend We're Bunny Rabbits'), romantic longing ('Come Back from San
Francisco'), sleazy leering ('Underwear'), resignation and despair
('No One Will Ever Love You') and the lonely and lovelorn ('100,000
Fireflies') which has the classic line &quot;I have a mandolin / I play it
all night long / It makes me want to kill myself&quot;.

And, to close, a quote from my beloved Jack Kerouac: &quot;We turned at a
dozen paces, for love is a duel, and looked up at each other for the
last time.&quot;

Ian,
Very interesting contrast with Nietzsche. I don't think we'll find a
contrast quite as stark as we will between Nietzsche and Kierkegaard.
Both existentialists, and yet as different as night and day.
Kierkegaard, as you may already be noticing, is going to be defending a
more Christian notion of love, but he may suprise you as how he defines
love. It will take the whole book to do so, but it's not so cut and
dry as Nietzsche may like it to be. But Nietzsche and Kierkegaard
never met, actually never even heard each others names.

Okay, Ian, that was facinating too - lots to ponder - but out of
curiosity what was Nietzsche's definition of love? I have never read
his work so does he simply state what he rejects as love or does he
offer what I must assume to be a more rational explanation of it all?

I looked up the 69 love songs. Wow! Never saw so many 5 star reviews!
Is it only a great one time listener or can it hold up to background
music?

"/> Nietzsche believed in the importance of friendship (&quot;philia&quot;) and said
love, especially in marriage, should should be like an &quot;extended
conversation between friends&quot;. Something real and tangible and direct;
not at all like the Christian concept of love. Eros was obviously
important to Nietzsche as well.

To make an ad hominen point, Nietzsche's love life was famously barren.

Umm very interesting, no doubt there are many facets to this thing that
we call love. Case in point:

Next week my wife and myself celebrate our 15th wedding aniversiry, now
the love that I feel for her is perhaps what can be called the selfish
kind, because before I met her I was defiantly on the fast track to
self destruction. Amongst other things what I get from our
relationship is stability in my life, she sorts me out no end, and
brings me back down to the reality that is living, for which I shall be
forever greatfull. Heh what she gets from me, I truley have no idea,
but she seems to be as happy with us as I am.

Now having made this admision, the question I ask is; Is one kind of
love more valid than another?

Cheers,

Lee.

I think it depends on what love you are talking about. Kierkegaard is
not talking about the love between a husband and a wife only. He is
talking about the love one should have for all men, though not in some
general way. In one part of the book he talks about how your neighbor
is the first person you see when step out your door in the morning. It
is each and every person you see, it's on an individual level. So this
same love should be had with your wife as well, though that does not
mean you cannot have a more intimate type of love as well, but if you
truely love her you will love her with the eternal love that
Kierkegaard speaks of, which is non-preferential.

I was unaware of the &quot;complimentary&quot; issue with the ancient Greeks, but I do see Eros and Agape as two sides of the same coin.

Eros........desire........getting

Agape......benevolence.......giving.

That is probably why Paul frowned upon Eros. ie....&quot;I'm going to 'get me some'......at the expense of giving. And in that respect, eros is unbalanced.

Craig,

I'm not a philosopher, and have have only read snippets of stuff, but I understand (or have heard) that an &quot;Existentialists&quot; can be defined as a group of philosophers and authors who believe that there is no Spirit underlying Matter.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I read &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; a looooong time ago, and I can't equate K. with that. Where, What or Why am I screwed up on this. Is it the definitionion of Existentialism, or have I misunderstood who K. is?

Pottsie,
It's OK, many people misunderstand what existentialism is. Many equate
existentialism with atheism, or materialism, but that's not the case.
The term existentialism, is almost as ambiguous as philosophy.
Existentialists question existence, and the meaning of existence.
That's about as much as I can pin down what existentialism means. Hope
it helps.

Thanks for that redux, Ian. ;)
Existentialism has been one of my favorite philosophies for a long time,
but not in the lettered way that Kierkecraig approaches it. I learned most
of my existentialism from Vonnegut and Tom Robbins :). Existentialism posits
that perception is reality, so what I believe to be real is real, if only
for me. Most sci-fi or fantasy movies wherein reality is twisted, and
perception screwed with, brushes across existentialist topics.

Another thought I had after reading Chris' response: So is Existentialism a philosophy or a question? In other words, does it answer anything, or does it just ask questions?

When you say, &quot;Existentialists question existence...&quot;, I want to say, &quot;Gee, I'm sorry. I have all the proof I need.&quot; When you add, &quot;and the meaning of existence.&quot;, I want to inquire if they've found any answers.

The meaning of existence, to me, is what It is all about. &quot;Meaning&quot;, &quot;Significance&quot;, &quot;Import&quot;, &quot;Purpose&quot;. It is hard to put into words......because the Significance and Meaning ARE the Word.....The Logos. The Universe &quot;says&quot; something. It is the Transmitter....the Subject. I am the receiver. It takes a Receiver AND a Transmitter to make a Radio. But both would be &quot;meaningless&quot; without a message. The Message IS the Meaning. (Marshall McCluan had only part of it) To him it was all Media and Message. To me, it is the meaning behind the message, and the message is &quot;I love you&quot; or &quot;We are One&quot;

Sorry, if I got off on a &quot;spiritual&quot; tangent there, but I guess I was an &quot;Existentialist&quot; for soooooo long in that I was only asking questions, without receiving any answers.......mainly, because I wasn't listening! lol

You sound so much like an existentialist. :)

That's what I always thought up until someone told me that the majority of existentialists believed that Matter existed devoid of Spirit.......and I just don't buy that. Spirit, IMHO, is the Ground of Being.....the BASIS of what IS.

I wish I could remember where I picked that up. I guess it just goes to show you that one needs to verify and re-verify!

Namaste

I hate to revive such an old topic, but I missed this the first time
around and I think I might be able to help.

Existentialism states simply that existence precedes essence. I.e. it
more or less asserts the primacy of individual experience over the
universal, what K. might refer to as the ethical. Kierkegaard is
considered the father of existentialism because of his work on 'the
self', which he thought stood perpendicular to the rank Hegelianism
that had infiltrated the Danish church.

It's important to recognize the emphasis of existentialism on
&quot;existence as doing.&quot; Human existence is always a matter of living
through time; it represents a fluid continuity of a person's
&quot;becoming.&quot; Therefore, any attempt to construct a concept of existence
will fail, because it makes what is necessarily fluid and temporal
rigid and eternal. Thus, K. would say, we can't &quot;know&quot; anything
(objective) about existence. This is why to him faith is so
incomprehensible (think back to &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;). A God who is
eternal *becomes* man -- he takes on &quot;existence.&quot; This is offensive to
reason, and we have two choices: believe it by virtue of the absurd or
take offense. This leads us into his Theology, which is not important
to this discussion, but it's not hard to see how Kierkegaard's thought,
when removed from God, leads the way to Existentialism.
