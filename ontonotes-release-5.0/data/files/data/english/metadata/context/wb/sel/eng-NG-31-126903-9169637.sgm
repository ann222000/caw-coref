18 Weeks into the Golden Jubilee Year

Reflections for your Golden Jubilee Journal: Nov 3 - 10

&quot;Quality education at all levels is, and has been, critically important for all societies at all times. In the developing world, education offers the poor opportunities for new futures; women higher status and new roles in their families and communities; migrants an asset that is portable; and refugees an asset that is both portable and secure.&quot;

Extract from Speech by Mawlana Hazar Imam at the Centenary Celebration meeting of the Association of American Universities
Washington, D.C., April 22, 2001

a.. Reflection: Read the entire speech on the AKDN website.What position did he play on the freshman soccer team?  What put him on the &quot;list in the Dean's office&quot; vs &quot;on the Dean's list&quot;?   In this speech, while Mawlana Hazar Imam stresses that quality education at all levels is critical for societies, he focuses on higher education as it can &quot;make by developing new models and standards for other institutions in society, and by inculcating in its students the skills of critical thinking, analysis and problem solving, under-pinned by a strong grasp of moral reasoning, ethics and respect for others.&quot;  Mawlana Hazar Imam emphasizes three key roles universities have to play:  ensuring quality and relevance of education, the increased use of technology and communications in especially remote education, and in building capacity for moral judgments in complex settings.  As you read the speech, how do the two specific examples cited demonstrate the effective use of the internet in education?

Jubilee Journeys: Jubilee Journeys: A Look at Major Projects

In this week's Journal Reflections, Mawlana Hazar Imam makes reference to ArchNet, as an example of harnessing the power of the internet in education.  The online community comprises of architects, planners, educators, and students, all interested in the built environment in the Muslim world.

[Dome of al-Hafiz, Al-Azhar Mosque, ArchNet]

ArchNet, amongst other areas, provides members with space &quot;to exhibit their own work, to communicate with other ArchNet members, and participate in informal discussions of topics of their choice that are relevant to the overall purpose of the project, and to participate in organised discussions, including collaborative design studios. Equally important, schools and departments of architecture with interests in the Islamic world can establish sections on the Website to present their programmes, activities, and collections of visual and textual materials.&quot; (Mawlana Hazar Imam, AAU Speech)

[The Mihrab, Great Mosque of Gedi, Kenya, ArchNet]

ArchNet will provide an extensive, high-quality, globally accessible, intellectual resource focused on architecture and planning issues and would include restoration, conservation, housing, landscape, and related concerns.  ArchNet is free to anyone with internet access, and is a &quot;bottom-up&quot; system, i.e. information will flow from the users themselves.  ArchNet members also post contemporary images.  [Aitika Mosque, Kashi, China, ArchNet]

Visit the ArchNet site to explore how the internet has been harnessed to provide an instant repository of information and a forum for knowledge sharing amongst students of Muslim architecture.

IIS Collects over 800 volumes of Khojki Manuscripts

The Institute of Ismaili Studies has a collection of over 800 volumes of Khojki and Gujarati manuscripts. Khojki, or Khwajah Sindhi, is the term applied to the special script that was used by the followers of the Nizari Ismaili Muslim tradition in the Indian subcontinent to record their religious literature.  According to Ismaili tradition, the da'i Pir Sadruddin was responsible for devising the Khojki script as a vehicle for preserving the community's sacred literature.

The Khojki materials that have survived are considerable, consisting of several hundred manuscripts, the vast majority of which contain ginan literature (the term ginan is believed to derive from the Sanskrit jnan or 'knowledge').  Read more about the Collection on the IIS website.

Golden Jubilee Memorabilia - Tasbihs

Council for Canada

The Council for Canada is pleased to inform the Jamat that the Golden Jubilee international memorabilia tasbihs have arrived and will be on sale starting Friday, November 9, 2007 at ITREB Literature Counters across the country.

A collection of 24 different tasbihs at three price points have been designed for the Golden Jubilee. Each tasbih consists of 33 semi-precious stones and a top stem that is a miniature adaptation of a 16th century alam, or Persian standard. This design is adorned with the invocations. &quot;O Allah! O Muhammad! O Ali!&quot;, in the center as mirror images, so as to ensure legibility on both sides amidst a floral scroll decoration. The five chains attached to the top stem of the tasbih reflect the symbolism associated with the number five in Muslim traditions. In many Shia traditions, that number is often associated with the Panjtan Pak.

Information about additional memorabilia items will be made available as the items become available.

Annual Ramadan Food Drive a Success
By Samia Hirani

Ramadan is a special time for the Muslim community. As the most blessed month of the year, it is a time for reflection, prayer and renewal of faith.

The Ramadan Food drive has been a tradition in our Jamat for almost a decade.  This year was no exception, as the Jamat's generosity culminated in over 35 boxes of non-perishable food items, amounting to a donation of approximately $3500 for the Paroisses Catholiques Romaines (Ottawa). This year's campaign started on September 13, and ran until the end of the month of Ramadan. Photos by:  CPMLTF Ottawa, Almin Surani  Click here for more photos.

Ramadan- more than a month of fasting for Muslims- is also a time for sharing, and giving generously to those in need.  As one of the ethical principles of our faith, charity is built into our community, and is one of the ways in which we reach out to other communities no matter their race or religion.

Volunteers were on site at the Nativity Centre on Saturday, October 20th, to deliver the packages to Sister Louise.  Just like an assembly line, one box after another filled the storage room in the basement of the Nativity Centre.

&quot;It's a gift every year&quot;, states Sister Louise.  &quot;Over 130 families will benefit from this donation.and we look forward to the generosity of your group every year.&quot;

AKDN and Emerging Careers Campaign

Aga Khan Education Board for Canada

The Aga Khan Education Board for Canada presents the AKDN and Emerging Careers Campaign. The campaign kicks off by profiling &quot;Careers in Education&quot;.

&quot;Teaching is one of the most valued professions because it opens minds to greater self-awareness as well as to the knowledge that gives learners greater
control over their destinies.&quot;

Excerpt from speech by Mowlana Hazar Imam on October 19, 2000, at the Inauguration of The Professional Development Centre, Northern Areas, Pakistan.

Teaching

Teachers can work within public or private education systems in Canada as well as abroad. There are many specializations within the teaching profession including special education or English as a Second Language.  After several years of school teaching experience, teachers can also work as curriculum developers, assessment specialists, and diagnostic and/or evaluation experts at the School Board and/or Ministry of Education level.  In addition, teachers can work as teacher educators in programs that require additional qualifications offered by the professional body regulating the teaching profession in their province.

The Sacred Foundations of Justice in Islam:  The Teachings of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib

M. Ali Lakhani, Editor

An anthology of essays on Imam 'Ali, titled The Sacred Foundations of Justice in Islam: The Teachings of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib is now available for sale through the Jamati Literature Counters. The book contains three essays on Imam 'Ali, and is, according to Dr. Seyyed Hossein Nasr's Introduction to the book, the first &quot;thorough and in-depth study&quot; in any European language devoted to Imam 'Ali's understanding of justice, and is &quot;a very welcome addition to the field of Islamic studies, having been written with authenticity and in a scholarly manner from within the Islamic tradition by three authors with somewhat different perspectives&quot;.

The essay titled &quot;The Metaphysics of Human Governance: Imam 'Ali, Truth and Justice&quot;, written by M. Ali Lakhani, the editor of the anthology, was awarded the first prize for the best English paper at the International Congress on Imam 'Ali held in Tehran in 2001. The essay titled &quot;A Sacred Conception of Justice: Imam 'Ali's Letter to Malik al-Ashtar&quot;, written by Reza Shah-Kazemi of the Institute of Ismaili Studies, was awarded the second prize. Dr. Nasr writes in his Introduction that &quot;The first two essays of this book are among the best writings on this extraordinary figure in Western languages and are obligatory reading for anyone interested in 'Ali but not familiar with Islamic languages.&quot; The essay titled &quot;'Ali ibn Abi Talib's Ethics of Mercy in the Mirror of the Persian Sufi Tradition&quot; is by Leonard Lewisohn, an expert in the Persian Sufi tradition, formerly a Faculty Member of the Institute of Ismaili Studies and currently a Professor at the University of Exeter.

Health Tip - Diabetes

Health Board for Ottawa

Diabetes is a leading cause of death in Canada. The rate of diabetes in the Indo-Canadian and South Asian community is 20% higher than in the general population!

There are 3 types of diabetes:

·        Type 1 - pancreas makes little or no insulin. The body needs insulin to use sugar for energy.

·        Type 2 - insulin not used effectively by the body.

·        Gestational diabetes - during pregnancy, insulin not used effectively by the body.

If left untreated, diabetes can result in complications including: heart disease, kidney disease, blindness, nerve damage, reduced blood supply to limbs.

The good news is that by making simple lifestyle changes, you can lower your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

·        Have at least 3 out of the 4 key food groups at each meal: grain products, vegetables and fruits, milk products, meat and alternatives.

·        Include high fibre foods such as whole grain breads, rice, pasta and cereals, fresh fruits, vegetables and legumes.

·        Make lower fat choices: use skim milk, trim the fat from meat and reduce or eliminate added fat such as oil or salad dressings.

·        Be physically active. Start slowly and gradually increase the amount of effort.

If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, following the above suggestions and regular check-ups with your diabetes health care team (doctor, dietician, eye doctor, foot doctor, etc.) can help you manage the disease and prevent complications.

Live healthy. Be healthy. Stay healthy.

Muslim Civilizations

Did You Know.

In the 9th century, Music was categorized as one of the mathematical sciences?

One of the earliest events which shaped the development of music in the Muslim world was the introduction of scholars of the Islam to ancient Greek treatises, many of which had probably been influenced previously by the legacies of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.

This contact was initiated during the ninth century under the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun. This ruler established Bayt al-Hikmah, literally &quot;the House of Wisdom,&quot; a scholarly institution responsible for translating into Arabic a vast number of Greek classics, including musical treatises by major Pythagorean scholars and works by Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus.

The outcome of this exposure to the classical past was profound and enduring. The Arabic language was enriched and expanded by a wealth of treatises and commentaries on music written by prominent philosophers, scientists, and physicians. Music emerged as a speculative discipline and as one of &quot;the mathematical sciences,&quot; which paralleled the Quatrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) in the Latin West.
