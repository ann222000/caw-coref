Well, shit. I guess those Honda engineers are worth what they're getting
paid, aren't they?

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; I need to get new shocks but I know little in the way of the shock. My
&gt; car is super bouncy and bottoms out all the time. I want a good shock
&gt; that will work with my adjustable coilovers and isn't $$$$.

Yo d00d. Plenty of Web-boards to handle the RiCe-b0i shit, dawg. Go ask
there.

&gt; What should I buy? and how can I stop myself from hitting the roof on

Place a piece of foam rubber on your head.

It bottoms out because the car is LOWERED.
That's less suspension travel,the manner by which the car was lowered.
