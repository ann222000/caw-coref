After a lot of deliberation, we have decided to deviate from the theme a
little.

Rather than having people's BGA's resolve over email, we are going to freeze
time and have the next game take place about 1-2 weeks after the last game.
We will be resolving the effects of the BGA AT this game.  So do not be
surprised if you do not get results by email.  We have every intention of
making sure they happen, we just think they will be more fun if they happen
AT game, rather than by some arbitrary measure between games.

So, what does that mean for all of you?  One action backed night, filled
with death, intrigue, backstabbing and oh yeah, did I mention, death?

We look forward to seeing you all at College Park, Church of the Nazarene!

Does that mean that there are no diplomacy moves before the next game?

Well, the one move that has been submitted we will keep.

We will not be submitting the second round though.

Yes, taking place at Riverrun.  Yes, still with the whole guest right thing, unless you're not covered anymore like certain teleporting folks. :)

Hmph.  Maybe.

Caemon is getting tired of all these people on my lawn.  Maybe he'll get out his shotgun and start cleaning house...

Ok, sorry.  Ancient Times.  His &quot;Boomstick&quot;!
