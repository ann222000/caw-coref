He should have let Feliciano pitch to more than one batter

He should have let Humber pitch the 8th so Heilman could be available in the
9th

I agree. The decision to pull Feliciano after one batter simple
boggles the mind. With Wagner down, Feliciano is our closer. Think
about it. Have you ever really seen Feliciano get rocked? Sosa often
gets rocked several times per week. And its not like Sosa doesnt have
a history of throwing games away. He singlehandedly destroyed the
Braves hopes for this year with his work for them the first half of
this season. Feliciano is a SUPERSTAR compared to Sosa. so Willie
pulls his superstar after one batter, to bring in a train wreck
waiting to happen. And then he refuses to pull his train wreck of a
pitcher no matter how badly he gets touched up. Willie gets these gut
feelings and this affection for certain players and he wont stop
playing them until they run the entire team into the ground. Like I
have said in all my posts, I like Willie. He's a good guy, but his
managerial decisions are often incredibly poor and totally
unexplainable and indefensible. I am really starting to think that he
is either in way over his head, has some sort of mental problem, or
just doesnt have the maturity to stop being so stubborn when
confronted with someone (like millions of Mets fans, the media, the
broadcasters, etc) trying to give him some good advice.

The guy can't handle a pitching staff ...he's just in over his head. This
staff is deeply flawed and it would take
an unusually astute manager to get something positive out of it...Willie is
not that guy. (Still can't believe Feliciano faces one batter only).

Yawn.   And if Humber had gotten rocked, you'd be ripping Willie for
having him in there in the first place.

Ah, but he was playing the percentages, wasn't he?   Going for the
righty-righty matchup?    Weren't you the fellow singing the praises
of so-called &quot;conventional&quot; managers the other day?    Well, Willie
did the conventional thing and guess what?   He got burned.

Feliciano is more in the mold of a LOOGY-type pitcher than Sosa, a
former starter who can give a team more than one inning if needed.
Since they're not really used the same way, I don't think it's a fair
comparison.

If you're going to rag on the guy, at least do it for a legitimate
reason.    Sosa hasn't pitched for the Braves at all since the middle
of 2006; he bears no responsibility for whatever happens to them this
season.

:Feliciano is a SUPERSTAR compared to Sosa. so Willie

I'm not sure where you're getting this idea that Feliciano has been
pitching so much better than Sosa, but it certainly hasn't been the
case recently.    Prior to this game, Sosa's ERA since August 1 had
been an even 4.00.   Feliciano's ERA since August 1, however,
was an even less impressive 4.22.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;And then he refuses to pull his train wreck of a

And put in whom?    Outside of bringing in a starter and risking
screwing up his rotation, he was out of viable options at that point.

I've never believed that Willie was all that brilliant a strategist,
but then, neither are most managers.     His biggest problem this year
has been that he just doesn't have that much to work with in this
bullpen.    You can rip on how he uses people like Sosa and Mota all
night long, but the fact is, nobody is going to look very smart when
that's what they've got to rely on.

A typically dopey, knee-jerk response, but as wrong-headed as always.
Outside of Aaron Sele, who had been brutal against the Nationals,
Willie's only other options were Dave Williams, who gave up 8 runs in
his only appearance this season, Collazo and Humber, who have
practically no major league experience between them, or bringing in a
starter, which could jeopardize next week's rotation.    None of these
could reasonably be considered better choices for that ninth inning
than Sosa, who had at least done some passable work out of the bullpen
over the past few weeks.
