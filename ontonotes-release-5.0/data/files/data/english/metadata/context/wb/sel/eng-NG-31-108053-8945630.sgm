Megatouch Maxx upgrading questions

I just got a Merit Megatouch Maxx Emerald. I am looking for some info
on the software progression and what my upgrade options are.

Also, on the hardware side, I'd like to upgrade this as well. I've
pulled the motherboard and it is an ENDAT-5701 and it looks like it
has a 200mhz pentium mmx cpu and 32mb pc100 sdram.

I've plugged in a couple 64mb pc133 sticks I had lying around and it
boots, but I can't tell if it is any faster.

I am looking at grabbing 2x 256mb pc100 sticks. Do these have to be
high density or low density, or does it matter? What is the max ram
the software can take advantage of?

What about upgrading the cpu? The heatsink is pretty well glued onto
the chip, so I can't see much. I think it is a p200mmx at 2.8 volts
which would make it the P55C 80503 with a 66mhz FSB, 0.28µm process.
There is another model, the &quot;Tillamook&quot; that is a 0.25µm process,
running at 1.8 volts and up to 300mhz. Anyway, if the software can't
take advantage or the motherboard can't handle the cpu, it isn't worth
it to even look.

Any other HW mods I could do to make things run smoother / cooler? I'm
going to replace the 3 fans with quieter, more efficient ones.

Thanks for any and all input!

The original ram was:

Samsung PC100-322-620
M366S0924CTS-C1L
64MB Non-ECC

I wouldn't bother with those CPU upgrades. My MAXX has never slowed or
locked up. I would like to find quieter fans for the cab though please
post source if you find quiet ones.

The 3 fans on my Megatouch are SUNON KDE1208PTB3-6 DC12V 1.4W, 80mm x
25mm thick

It runs at 2500 rpm and moves 30 CFM @ 28.5 dBA

This is the exact image: http://www.meditronik.com.pl/doc/mini/usb02012.jpg

They are using a different plug than a normal pc, but I think this fan
OEM comes with just wires and no plug.

You could buy any PC fan with similar specs and just splice the wires
yourself, simple job.

Basically just look for the same or higher CFM (air movement, cubic
feet per minute) at a lower noise level. You can also get checp
silicone &quot;fan dampening&quot; kits to reduce vibration and therefore noise.

PS - I've read somewhere that these machines don't benefit from more
than 64MB ram. Is this true?

Also, about the CPU, I want to replace it for something that takes
less power and possibly uses a smaller process so it produces less
heat. There are a few chips out there that will do this, and have a
faster clock speed.

Just wondering if anyone has swapped theirs out?

The unicorn board 3701 looks like it can take any Socket 7 / Super 7
CPU so something like an amd K6-III+ would be at 180nm and 2.0v
instead of the Rise MP6 that comes with it at 250nm and 2.8v, and
severely underpowered.
