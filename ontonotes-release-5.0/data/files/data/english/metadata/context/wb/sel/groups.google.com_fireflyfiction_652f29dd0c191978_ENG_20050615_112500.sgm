***

Kaylee climbs into her hammock, nearly upending it when she can't control her
trembling limbs. She's safe here in the engine room, her queendom. No one
around to insist that she realize that the eyes that so often gazed at her
could coolly look at a man and judge how best to end his life, that the hands
that have been all over and in her are instruments of death. She's shuddering
more violently now, not quite crying, as she remembers the angle of Jayne's
knife, the brightness of the blade, the sweeping motion of his powerfully
muscled arm. She dreams it again and again until he's bending over her and the
knife begins its dark descent, slashing across her own throat.

***

Everything is different when Jayne finally wakes up. He wishes the light
overhead were a bit brighter, as the skin on his chest feels uncomfortably
taut, and he needs to see the damage those bastards wrought. He blinks and
then realizes that the light isn't dim; it's just that Zoe's standing next to
his bed, her head shielding his eyes from the light. She opens her mouth but
doesn't say anything, and he's surprised to discover he understands her
silence. Her eyes are offering him an apology; she wants him to forgive her
for tending Mal first. He knows quite well that in healing the captain first,
she was really ensuring the survival of two: Mal and herself. And self-
preservation is an instinct he's well acquainted with. He nods as best he can
while still lying down and she relaxes. He motions a bit with his chin and she
moves to help him sit up. It's worse that way; his skin pulls even tighter and
it hurts to breathe. He slides back down and looks at his chest. &quot;Hell, Zoe,&quot;
he says as he takes in her handiwork of small, neat gauze patches, &quot;I look like
a ruttin' chessboard.&quot;

&quot;You do, somewhat,&quot; she concedes with a quick smile. &quot;Do you know what they
had on their blades?&quot;

&quot;Naw. Where we goin'?&quot;

&quot;Wash and the captain figured something out. Want some food?&quot;

He shakes his head. &quot;Mal good?&quot; he asks when he sees the bed across the way is
empty.

Zoe's got the tin of medicine in her hand as she stands in front of the
infirmary com. &quot;Sir? Jayne's awake.&quot; She turns back to the bed, holding up
the tin. &quot;I need to put this stuff on again,&quot; she says as he sighs. She's
peeling off the first white square of gauze when she hears Mal's step in the
hallway. A moment later, she's shouldered aside.

&quot;Let me,&quot; says Mal. &quot;You go up and convince that crazy pilot that we don't
need to be stopping on any Alliance planet.&quot; He doesn't bother to watch her
out the door, trusting that she will obey. He looks down at Jayne's prone body
and peels away the gauze. Every wound is staring up at him, and it's hard to
believe that they could have looked any worse. But their original blistering
red has faded to a painful pink, and the swelling has reduced a little. He
unscrews the lid of the ointment tin, forgetting to keep it as far from his
face as possible; the acrid odor makes his eyes well and his throat close. He
jams the lid back on and waits for his eyes to clear. Once they do, he dips a
clean finger in the tin and starts applying the unguent to Jayne's wounds.
Over and over, he finds a wound, scoops out some ointment, and applies it, his
finger making careful circles. He keeps his mind closed against the horrific
injuries, knowing that they might well have been on Zoe's body had he allowed
her to accompany him. This could easily be Zoe writhing wretchedly under his
insufficient ministrations; this could easily be Zoe scarred and weakened. He
owes Jayne everything.

***

&quot;How is he?&quot; Wash asks before she's even stepped fully into the room.

&quot;Not good,&quot; Zoe replies evenly. &quot;Not yet. But there's nothing Alliance
doctors could do for him that we can't.&quot;

&quot;Alliance?&quot; he asks, his face crinkling up in a puzzled frown.

&quot;Captain said you were looking to land on an Alliance planet,&quot; she says.

His face clears. &quot;Yeah. Bolus. Where I'm from. My mother's a healer; not a
doctor, but knows natural remedies. It's less than half a day from here.&quot;

It's a good idea, and she knows it, but there's one thing she needs to get
straight before she persuades Mal. &quot;Did you fight against the
Independents?&quot;

&quot;Didn't fight at all.&quot;

She nods and pushes the com to connect to the infirmary.

***

Mal nearly runs her over because she's moving about without looking where she's
going. His hands curl familiarly over her shoulders and she's vaguely aware of
their grip and his crimson shirt. Only Mal and Zoe wear this red, the color of
deserts and dry, dusty battlegrounds where your lips would crack because your
canteen was empty; she remembers her uncle's letters. It's red like blood,
life spilling on the ground. She squirms a bit under his touch, trying half-
heartedly to avoid the dull buzzing sounds in her ears. When he shakes her a
bit, she realizes he's been talking to her.

&quot;What's the problem, Kaylee?&quot; he asks, not quite sure if he's amused or
troubled by her inattention. But she doesn't answer, looks like she can't even
process his question. Truth to tell, she's like a nervous animal, the ones his
mama taught him to gentle so's they wouldn't break. He runs his hands up and
down her arms, keeping his voice soothing. &quot;Kaylee?&quot; He follows her gaze to a
huge, bloody handprint wrapped around the jamb of the common room arch.
Jayne's handprint, from when he stumbled onto *Serenity* after the Pixley job.
He swings her around so her back is to the doorway and makes sure he's got her
full attention before he asks, &quot;Want to get rid of it?&quot; At her nod, he smiles.
&quot;We're hittin' a likely-looking planet today. Pick up some paint. For your
room too if you'd like.&quot;

&quot;shiong-muh duh kuang-ren&quot; = &quot;violent lunatic&quot;

[Bolus]

Her hazel eyes don't shift from Jayne's face, but she knows precisely where her
son is at every moment. She can't believe she's got him back, at least for a
little while, until she heals this man he's suddenly calling a friend. She
tears a large, thick leaf in half, allowing a heavy green syrup to ooze out,
and collects it in a small bowl. This will help more than the ointment they've
been smearing all over him, and smell better too. She applies it with strong,
steady fingers, but Jayne remains asleep. The fragrance of it is still hanging
in the air when Zoe walks in. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she says, stopping uncertainly at the
doorway. &quot;May I come in?&quot;

Esme only nods, watching Zoe look down at Jayne. There's a little bit of guilt
there, though she can't figure out what for, and there's a lot of relief; she's
sure Zoe's had to look at fallen comrades before, but most of them probably
wouldn't have still been breathing. She knows that any moment now, Zoe will
catch her eye. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Zoe says before walking out again. Behind her,
she hears her son sigh, and she finally realizes why he's been so
uncharacteristically silent.

She finishes tending to Jayne and turns to face her son. &quot;In love?&quot; she asks,
smiling a little at how absurd it is that her baby boy thinks he's grown up
enough for this.

She sobers up quickly at the longing on his face. &quot;I want to marry her.&quot; For
certain he's grown up. She would have more likely bet her money on the little
one, the girl who nods knowingly when he speaks of the ship. But it's not for
her to say who he should love. Not when he's the only boy she's got left.

She smiles brightly at him and changes the subject. &quot;Hungry?&quot; His nod is so
eager that she laughs. &quot;Who does the cooking when you're up there?&quot; she asks,
curious about how he lives everyday life.

&quot;We take turns. Jayne there's the only one who's any good at it.&quot;

&quot;You let the only decent cook get cut up and poisoned?&quot; she asks, cuffing him
affectionately. &quot;I knew I should never have dropped you on your head when you
were a baby.&quot;

&quot;Did it seem like a good idea at the time?&quot; he asks, straightfaced, and she
follows him out of the room, laughing, reminded of why she loves him so.

[Orlo]

He must be a heavy sleeper if he missed this. He wonders if he snores too.

Somehow, he can't quite fathom how, there's an exercise bench and a full set of
weights in the big common area where he and Zoe and Mal sometimes spar. Mal's
beaming like an idiot and rubbing his hands together gleefully. &quot;Wanna try it
out?&quot;

Jayne looks over at Zoe, and she nods, confirming that he's fully healed. He
can't quite keep from grinning a little as he lies on the bench and pulls the
weighted bar off the rack. He's become unused to this kind of exertion, and
his arms are soon screaming, but it feels good to know he's useful again. He
looks up at Mal, who's been spotting him, and tries to smile his thanks. But
the storm of emotions on the captain's face stops him; maybe he got it wrong,
though, and Mal's eyes weren't shining with guilt and grief, he thinks later.
After all, he'd been looking at him upside down.

***

Kaylee's keeping an eye on the radar, and the others are having dinner and
discussing where best to try to sell the goods from the Pixley job. &quot;Orlo's
the kind of world where they'd appreciate all that fancy kind of foodstuff,&quot;
Wash argues.

&quot;Yeah, but they're also likely to already have more than they need, so they
won't pay as well,&quot; Mal counters. &quot;We need to find a place where these things
aren't readily available but the folk have enough money to spend fair for it.&quot;
A lull descends as Jayne continues to shovel food into his mouth and Zoe is
absentmindedly pushing a slice of tomato around her plate. &quot;Zoe?&quot; Mal
ventures.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; she responds, still not paying attention.

&quot;Hey, you should eat that,&quot; Wash says; &quot;it came from my mother's garden.&quot; He's
unprepared for the way her eyes snap up to meet his, studying him intently even
as she takes a bite.

&quot;Zoe?&quot; Mal says again, a little impatient.

&quot;Small, Alliance-friendly planet's our best bet,&quot; she says, shifting her gaze
to Mal. &quot;Goods are legal, and we should take advantage of that rarity.&quot; She
finishes her meal and takes her plate to the sink. She waits for the others to
follow suit, as it's her turn to clean. Each man comes up beside her and puts
his empty plate in the sink, and she sees only their hands: Jayne's big and
callused, Mal's wide and veined, Wash's strong and square. She turns on the
water, trying at the same time to turn off her thoughts. He's got his mother's
hands, healer's hands. He won't hurt her. He's got a good heart; he brought
Jayne to his family. Maybe he meant what he said. She's not used to men
thinking of her as a woman; to most, she's too good a soldier to be desirable.
Maybe she should give him a chance.

***

If ever Zoe could look mutinous, Mal thinks, it's at moments like these, which
have become all too frequent. She knows what's coming before he even opens his
mouth. It's a skill he appreciated in battle. Right now, though, he'd prefer
the cool courtesy she'd give a stranger. &quot;All right, people, let's get
*Serenity* lookin' shiny. Got another person maybe interested in renting
shuttle one comin' onboard.&quot; There's vague grumbling at the work this will
entail when they've all got plenty to do already, but there's hope too that
this will be the last time they have to go through this whole thing.

But Mal doesn't like the man from the minute he steps onto *Serenity*. He's a
rich kid not quite as grown-up as he thinks, looking to thumb his nose against
parental restrictions. He's willing to pay handsomely, and to give a little
extra if Kaylee and Zoe wait on him. He's not attentive enough to see Mal's
face closing against him, but the others are and know that their two months of
such visits have just been extended yet again.

***

He can't tell what she's up to. Kaylee's not been after him once since he got
hurt on Pixley. Maybe she's worried he's still healing and doesn't want to
aggravate his injuries. Maybe. But she hasn't looked up at him with that
shyly knowing look either, that darkens her eyes and stretches her smile, the
one that's enough to get him hard. Could be she needs him to make the first
move. Jayne leaves his bunk and heads for the engine room. But it's empty, so
he heads to the kitchen to find some grub.

He comes upon her unexpectedly, a small paintbrush in her hand as she decorates
the inside of the archway. She's already covered the lowest section with a
meandering design of vines, leaves, and poppy blossoms, and is arching her back
slightly as she examines the area above her head. Seeing her in that pose, her
throat long and fluid, her hair falling down her back, he remembers the last
time he saw her like that, when she was on top of him, rising up over him as a
flush pinked her skin and her breath started to come sharp and fast and
shuddering. He stands there trapped by his desire for her. He can't move even
when her eyes lock abruptly onto him. And he still can't move when she gives
no sign of recognition or emotion and turns back to face the doorway.

***

&quot;Goods are legal, shouldn't need lot of muscle for this job. Jayne, you've
earned a day off, so . . .&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Jayne cuts off Mal. &quot;Anybody's gonna be backing you up, it's gonna be
me.&quot; He's not about to be left alone on the boat with Kaylee, who's acting
like she's never met him before, let alone moaned his name in a hundred of
*Serenity*'s shadowy nooks. He's finally figured it was the blood on Pixley
that's causing her to avert her eyes, but what the hell did she expect? She
couldn't have thought his entire job was to stand behind Mal and look mean.
She'd seen him clean his guns, teased him about the polish he lavished on his
knives. Wasn't like he ever shied away when she was covered from ass to
eyebrows with engine grease. &quot;Guns okay this time around?&quot; He waits to see
her flinch a little before he asks, &quot;Or is it knives only again?&quot;

***

This is not something Zoe wants to get used to, being left behind while Jayne
is sticking to the captain like a burr caught in a saddle blanket. It's always
been her job to guard his back, during the war, but especially now. To try to
save him a little bit everyday, the way he saved her as they buried Nikhil.

All of her weapons are in perfect working condition, since she cleaned them
last night, thinking she'd be accompanying Mal onto Orlo. There are no jobs
for her to do. She heads to the kitchen and peers into her cabinet. She
doesn't hear Wash come up behind her until he opens the door to his own
cabinet.

&quot;Hungry?&quot; he smiles politely. She can't decide between a nod and a shrug, so
she simply smiles back. He swallows, then clears his throat. &quot;Well, I've got
plenty of food from Bolus. Didn't know if there was a common cabinet, but it's
meant for all of us. Why don't I fix you something?&quot;

She's charmed by the offer, but wary of accepting it. She has to be sure
before she takes this any further. &quot;I'll make my own. What are you having?&quot;
He pulls out handful after handful of fresh food, laying it all on the table.
She fetches two plates and some utensils and sits, waiting for him to join her.
Placing a piece of flatbread on her plate, she reaches for the jar of coriander
spread.

&quot;Careful,&quot; he warns; &quot;that's homemade, and my mother likes things spicy.&quot; She
spoons it on liberally and hands him the jar. Soon they're passing jars and
cans of his mother's food back and forth, constantly having to clear space on
the crowded table. There seems to be a story behind every dish, and she finds
herself remembering and even sharing some of her father's recipes. Little
things she'd thought she'd forgotten are coming back to her now, and her eyes
are shining with a mournful peace. Wash is more in love than ever.

***

&quot;Nice tidy profit,&quot; Mal announced; &quot;looks like Orlo was a fine idea.&quot; He nods
amicably at Wash and sees Zoe smile at the acknowledgment. &quot;And we got
ourselves another job. Seems a few folks from Orlo - indentured servants,
mostly, who've earned their freedom - decided to settle on a planet the next
system over. They're in need of iron goods. We're to pick those up on Lowry
and then meet them on Visick for the delivery.&quot; He sees the question on Wash's
face. &quot;And I picked up fuel cells for a journey three times as long. Sky's
ours.&quot;

***

[Lowry]

&quot;You're here!&quot; Kaylee says, a little startled. Her face is shiny with sweat
and she's beaming happily. She holds up for Mal's puzzled approval the parts
she's found in the salvage yard. &quot;These'll come in mighty handy,&quot; she assures
him. &quot;Let's see what you got.&quot;

He grins and reaches into the sack he's carrying, setting it gently down. Out
comes his hand with a horseshoe, and he waves it around a bit. Behind him, he
hears Jayne let out a disgusted grunt and unceremoniously drop the two sacks
he's been hauling around.

&quot;You know parts and metalwork,&quot; Mal says. He holds it out to her and she takes
it. Kaylee examines the shoe and hands it back. &quot;Shiny, Cap'n,&quot; she says
cheerfully, marching past the men with an armful of parts.

&quot;Mal,&quot; Jayne says once she's out of earshot, &quot;these shoes and supplies are no
good.&quot;

&quot;I know they're heavy, Jayne,&quot; the captain responds, taking the mercenary's
words as a complaint.

Jayne gives him a look, then takes the horseshoe out of Mal's hand. With some
effort, he snaps it in half. &quot;They're no good,&quot; he says again, emphasizing
each word.

Mal's jaw has dropped. &quot;How did you . . .&quot;

&quot;Saw it from the minute you started flashin' that thing 'round at her. Bad
metal, bad work.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but how did you . . .&quot;

&quot;My pop was a blacksmith. He's the one showed me how to make gun oil.&quot;

Mal sighs, considering their options. &quot;None of it's any good? What about the
folk headin' over to Visick? They already paid for this fei-oo.&quot;

&quot;Ain't my call.&quot;

***

&quot;That was not a fun time,&quot; Mal says, rubbing at his face tiredly with one hand
and turning off the video feed with the other. It'd been a chore trying to
convince the people leaving for Visick the wares they'd bought would be of no
use to them. Better to leave your horses unshod than put such uneven shoes on
them, he'd said; don't want to strain their muscles. He'd had to hold one of
the broken shoes up to the cortex monitor before they'd believed him. He
swivels around in Wash's chair and sees Kaylee holding another of the defective
horseshoes.

&quot;Cain't believe I let you down, that I didn't see it,&quot; she says, looking up at
him regretfully.

&quot;Whoa, whoa. No lettin' down happened here. Your job ain't to inspect
ironwork. Quit frownin' lines into that pretty face,&quot; he orders.

&quot;How'd you know?&quot; she wonders as she examines the shoe once more.

&quot;Jayne.&quot; He can tell by the way her head whips back up that he's surprised
her. &quot;Said somethin' after you took off.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; she says, trying to guess what the mercenary was thinking. If there was
ever one person whose thought processes she thought she could figure without
strain, it was Jayne. But now he's gone and thrown her for a loop.

***

Zoe must be workin' through an idea of her own, or else she'd be with him right
now, trying to figure what to do next. The 'verse is theirs; they've got fuel
cells, credits, and the sweetest ride in space. He wonders if there's anyplace
she's always wanted to go.

He wouldn't be surprised to find her in the bridge with Wash. Since the Orlo
job, he's seen that she's been making an effort to get along better with the
pilot. Practical woman, Zoe is, and a damn fine second; she knows that a
friendly word now and then will keep *Serenity* flying. But when Mal reaches
the bridge, he doesn't see her making polite conversation. Instead, she's
failing to keep a straight face as she and Wash play a game of chess. She's on
her feet the minute she spots Mal. &quot;Sir?&quot; she asks. &quot;Something come up on the
cortex?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; he admits, leaning against the nearest wall. &quot;Just wanted to know if you
had any ideas about where we could be headin'.&quot;

&quot;No one in this corner of the 'verse I'm inclined to say hello to,&quot; she
responds, sinking back down to her seat. She feigns absent-mindedness,
pretending to consider the possibilities while she maneuvers her queen into
striking position. She knows Mal sees through her; she also knows he won't
give her away to Wash.

But Wash is too focused on Zoe to miss any of her moves. His reply is quick,
keeping his king out of danger. Mal nods approvingly, then examines the pilot
more closely. &quot;How about you, Wash? Any leads on a job or likely world for
work?&quot;

&quot;No, I don't know this area too well. Don't even know the hub planet,&quot; he
says, groaning as Zoe's knight knocks out one of his rooks. &quot;Can't talk now,
Sir, she's storming my castle.&quot;

***

The dinner that Jayne made keeps them too busy stuffing food in their mouths to
talk much about where they're headed. And Mal recognizes the rare sense of
relaxation, and decides to let the issue wait until morning. He's enjoying the
camaraderie, and proposes a game of hoopball after the kitchen's left clean,
Zoe and Jayne to be captains.

Kaylee watches as Jayne wins the toss. Her heart sinks a little when his eyes
pass right over her and he chooses Wash. Every time he's been captain before,
he's chosen her, and at some point in the game, gotten her up on his shoulders
to score a few easy points. Before she can say anything, Zoe's chosen Mal, and
she's left to wait on the sidelines as a substitute. The game starts off slow,
even a little clumsy. She finds herself watching Jayne all the time, as he
maneuvers and passes and shoots and positions himself. She hears his voice
calling for the ball, whooping encouragement, mocking as he blocks shots. She
sees how easy he is with his body, how sure of himself he is physically. There
is a reason he's still alive at thirty-seven, having been a mercenary for so
many years. She still doesn't like his job, but he's good at it, and he's
necessary. She realizes now they'd all be dead - Captain and Wash right there
on Pixley, she and Zoe as they tried to return to *Serenity* - if Jayne hadn't
been so capable. She sees Jayne call for a time-out and Wash head to the
sidelines; when she comes onto the court, she tries to smile at Jayne. He
ignores the hopeful look on her face and passes her the ball.

***

*Serenity*'s been floating carefree for weeks, in no particular rush to get
anywhere. Mal's worked out with Jayne for the last week, and once, when the
muscle strain got to be too much, he'd chased Kaylee out of the engine room
where she'd been holing herself up by taunting her for not knowing how to play
Tall Card. It's kind of silly to have only two players, but Jayne said he
needed to exercise his legs, and he'd seen Wash heading to Zoe's quarters with
the mapbook tucked under his arm.

&quot;Do you get it now?&quot; he asks, smiling as he sees her bite her lip in
concentration.

&quot;No,&quot; she admits cheerfully. &quot;Where we headed?&quot;

&quot;No plans as of yet. Why?&quot;

&quot;Just curious. It's nice, seeing the worlds like this,&quot; she says, smiling
around at the warmth of the common room, unaware that she's tilted her cards so
that he can read them.

&quot;Now, see, if you'd put these two cards down, you'd've won,&quot; he informs her.

&quot;Really? I won?&quot; she asks, beaming like a child, raising her arms for a
victory pose.

&quot;Not exactly -&quot; he begins, but is cut off when she jumps up and hugs him from
behind. &quot;Yes, mei-mei,&quot; he amends; &quot;you've won.&quot;

***

It's been an odd kind of day, he thinks as he lies on his bed, his feet still
on the floor. One of his hands is resting idly on his chest, and he can feel
his heartbeat. The rhythm is picked up in a faint thrumming at the door.
That's Zoe, doing her fingertips-only knock; it means she wants to talk. &quot;Come
in, Zoe,&quot; he calls, and sits up.

&quot;Sir,&quot; she acknowledges as she peeks around the door. Her face is grave and
her eyes are shining, and he's not sure what to make of it. He waits for her
to have her say. &quot;Mal, I'm getting married,&quot; she nearly whispers.

He tries to stave off the panic that overwhelms him. He can't think, but he
must. Where could she have met anyone? They haven't been on land long enough
for her to do much more than nod professionally at men whose eyes were trained
on her gun instead of her face or form. It occurs to him, suddenly, in a wave
of despair that renders his panic trivial, that she hasn't asked if he'd be
willing to bring her husband aboard; she's leaving. Leaving him, leaving
*Serenity*. &quot;When?&quot; he finally asks. He needs to know the worst right now,
needs to know how long he's got until she takes off with his will to live.

&quot;Don't know. I haven't asked him yet,&quot; she says, her forehead knotting as she
takes in how defeated he suddenly looks.

&quot;What? Don't joke,&quot; he pleads. He still can't figure who she intends to wed.
&quot;Give me a time.&quot;

&quot;I haven't talked it over with him yet. I wanted to come to you first,&quot; she
says, gesturing almost helplessly, as if she wants to reach out to him but
isn't sure her touch would be welcome.

He wishes she would touch him. He needs an anchor to reality right now.
&quot;Goin' about this a bit backward, ain't you?&quot; he asks, his heart crumpling as
her hesitance with him proves that she means what she says. She really is
going to marry and leave. She's really found someone who can fill the holes in
her heart and not just show her the holes in his.

&quot;Mal, please,&quot; she begs. &quot;I want this, but I want you . . .&quot; she trails off,
unsure if she can put into words what he means to her, what she needs from him.

&quot;To give you my blessing?&quot; he finishes, torn between sorrow and rage. &quot;How can
I do that, Zoe, when he's taking you away?&quot; The rage might be winning.

She sees now that he's on the wrong tack. She hastens to reassure him. &quot;Wash
and I won't be leaving *Serenity*, Sir.&quot;

&quot;*Wash?!?*&quot; his disbelief is total, and so, in turn, is hers. Who else did he
think she was spending time with and falling in love with? At her nod, his
face hardens a bit. The rage is definitely winning, but at least he's not
repeating all of her complaints about the pilot.

She sees that he's clamped his mouth shut, his lips turning white from
pressure, in an effort not to say anything hurtful. In the silence, she finds
her own words. &quot;Yes. Wash. I love him. I know we have next to nothing in
common, but that little is enough. I trust him. I love him.&quot; She glances at
him, but his face is still angled down and slightly away from her; she'd have
to stoop to catch his eye. She steps close instead, laying one hand on his
chest. Her fingertips drum out the rhythm of his heartbeat automatically.
He's startled into looking up and they both straighten their spines. Eyes
level with his, she continues. &quot;But I could never leave you. You are a part
of me, Mal, the best part. You're so deep inside me that I can't be me without
you.&quot;

He'll take it. It might not be eloquent, but he knows she means it. He knows
because that's all he could say to her in return. You are me, Zoe, and without
you I'm lost. He cups her cheek tenderly, and then she's in his arms, and he
has to be careful not to crush her to him. Instead, they stand there, warm in
each other's embrace, and there's no need for anything else.

***

&quot;Monty? Really?&quot; Mal asks.

Zoe nods. &quot;Makes sense, Sir. He's been on Thalia long enough that he's got
some say in how things there are run, and we can be there in a few days.&quot;

&quot;And you got business to take care of,&quot; Mal finishes. &quot;Would be good to see
the old walrus again,&quot; he muses, &quot;and mayhap he'll have work for us. All
right.&quot;

She squeezes his arm as she slips by him, heading for the bridge. &quot;Thalia,&quot;
she says low in Wash's ear, and he plugs in the coordinates before swiveling
around to face her.

When he sees her smile, he's startled. &quot;*That's* where we're getting married?&quot;
he blurts out. &quot;Don't you want to go somewhere nice, someplace shiny, where
you won't be the only woman who's not marrying her cousin?&quot;

She laughs and explains, &quot;It's the closest decent world from here. And as long
as Mal is there, the rest doesn't matter to me.&quot;

His face darkens. &quot;As long as *Mal* is there?&quot; he repeats.

&quot;Yes,&quot; she says staunchly. &quot;He belongs there. I'm not getting married without
him.&quot;

He's hurt by her insistence. &quot;Does the groom matter at all? Would you marry
Jayne on Thalia if Mal was there?&quot; He'd envisioned it being just the two of
them, lost in each other; he wasn't bargaining on this sort of menage a trois.

&quot;Of course you matter,&quot; she says plainly. She searches for a way to make this
right, and the sight of his face bathed in starlight inspires her. &quot;Look,&quot;
she says, gesturing to all the worlds visible from *Serenity*'s bridge. &quot;Tell
me what you see.&quot;

He's confused, but knows she's trying to explain herself. He plays along. &quot;I
see . . . planets. Stars. New worlds to build lives on.&quot; She stays silent,
so he figures he owes her more. &quot;And . . . there's a balance, an order . . .
it's beautiful.&quot;

She nods. &quot;And when it's just you up on the bridge, just seeing this view
makes you sure your life has meaning, a purpose maybe even you haven't figured
out yet?&quot; He's dumbfounded by the way she's seen into him, and seeing his
astonished face, she explains, &quot;What the stars do for you - that's what Mal
does for me.&quot;

&quot;fei-oo&quot; = &quot;junk&quot;

[Thalia]

Squinting in the dim, dusty light, Zoe finally spots him and indicates her
success with a hand on Mal's arm, over the scar he acquired on Pixley. They
stride over and wait for Monty to raise his gaze from his drink. When he does,
the riotously shaggy beard parts to let them see his broad, surprised smile.
&quot;Mal and Zoe,&quot; he crows, clapping them each hard on the back, &quot;what in the good
gorram are you doin' here?&quot;

&quot;Hoped you might help us out,&quot; Mal says as he slides onto the barstool next to
Monty's.

&quot;With what exactly? What are you up to?&quot; he asks Zoe, knowing that any
straightforward answer would come from her.

&quot;Gettin' married,&quot; she smiles.

Monty's jaw drops as he swivels jerkily to face one and then the other. &quot;But
you . . . no . . . that ain't . . .&quot;

&quot;I ain't the lucky man, Monty,&quot; Mal breaks in before his old friend dizzies
himself further. &quot;But Zoe's tellin' you true. She's gettin' hitched. Can we
do it here?&quot;

Monty holds up a finger and quaffs his drink in one long gulp. He shakes his
head like a wet dog and looks back up at the two of them. &quot;Certainly!&quot; he says
in his normal voice. &quot;Fact, the Thalia ceremony's kinda cute.&quot;

&quot;Cute?&quot; Mal asks as Zoe looks perturbed.

&quot;You know . . . quaint. But nice and short. No fuss.&quot;

&quot;Sounds good.&quot; Mal stands to go, offering Monty his hand. &quot;Would you like to
meet the man? Come back to the ship with us.&quot;

&quot;Not today, but I'll be by to talk business with you soon.&quot;

***

Thalia weddings, at least those between a man and a woman, Mal is surprised to
find, require four participants. As he waits for Zoe, he wonders what the
procedure is when two men, or two women, wed. Jayne's been teasing him all day
about his role as &quot;Bride's Best,&quot; and he wonders if there's an alternate title.
He tugs a bit on the leather bands that Zoe had stripped from her own throat
and wound about his. &quot;Doesn't seem bridal, Sir,&quot; she'd said, her voice teasing
and her eyes glowing, &quot;but I'd hate to think that if somebody got shot at my
wedding, we wouldn't be able to fashion a damn good tourniquet.&quot;

&quot;Don't get sentimental on me now, Zoe,&quot; he'd joked half-heartedly, but the
laughter turned real when they saw Jayne bearing his wedding gift.

&quot;Last of my pop's gun oil,&quot; he bragged as he set the small bottle down before
Zoe.

&quot;Speaking of sentiment . . .&quot; Zoe smiled, halfway between tears and mockery.

Jayne flushed a bit. &quot;Figured you could always use it,&quot; he mumbled, and his
hand gestures grew more vigorous and vague, &quot;and . . . I thought . . . I want . .
. your marriage to be as happy as his,&quot; he finished quickly, the last words
coming out in a tangled rush.

Zoe's eyes brimmed, and Mal was surprised to find himself brushing away some
moisture from his own. She smiled sweetly at Jayne and reached out a gentle
hand to pat his abdomen over long-healed scratches and they flashed a
conspiratorial glance at each other. &quot;I'm givin' Wash some soothing cream,
since I know what those nails of yours can do,&quot; Jayne smirked as he wrapped a
careless, fraternal arm about Zoe's neck. He allowed Zoe to shoo him out of
the room, but at the last minute he turned. He met Mal's eye briefly and
nodded like a comrade in arms before vanishing.

The sound of Monty clomping toward him brings Mal back to the present moment.
He's in no mood to be greeted so cheerfully by someone who'd tossed out the
innocent word &quot;cute&quot; without explaining it. &quot;Monty,&quot; he says, as he advances
as threateningly as he can, &quot;what *exactly* does being `Bride's Best'
entail?&quot;

Monty reddens a bit and kicks the dusty ground. &quot;Shoot, Mal, it's an honor.
Know how many brides never actually became wives because folks lookin' to be
Bride's Best got a little too competitive?&quot;

&quot;What are you saying? People have died and killed for this job?&quot;

&quot;Well, not killed exactly. More like . . . temporarily put out of commission.
More'n a few times, there was no one left standing to be Bride's Best and the
couple had to wait until injuries had healed.&quot;

&quot;That's crazy!&quot; Mal starts, about to begin a fine long rant, when he realizes
that Monty's nodding his head mournfully as if he's in complete agreement even
as he tries to sidle away. Mal reaches out and collars him, none too gently.
&quot;If you don't tell me what I'm going to have to do, I'll hold you down and
shave off that beard of yours with my dullest knife.&quot;

Monty sputters a bit. &quot;You've got to be the one who knows Zoe the best.&quot; Mal
nods. &quot;And you've got to be the one she can always turn to.&quot; Another nod.
&quot;And you've got to love her.&quot; Relieved grin; this isn't so bad. &quot;And you've
got to publicly declare your love for her and officially state that you support
the union into which she is entering.&quot;

***

Monty had been right; the ceremony was quite short. Nevertheless, he'd felt
dazed throughout, as if he were half a step behind everyone else. Jayne's
striped shirt was too loose on him, and Zoe's leather bands were too tight
around his throat. Monty had neglected to mention that Bride's Best actually
functioned as Bride's Seat for the duration, and he'd had Zoe's warm, pliant
weight on his lap as he struggled to find words fitting for the occasion. He
heard little of Wash's words, spoken in a voice excitement had raised an octave
and a half. He felt Zoe's words as a vibration. And then it was his turn to
speak, to bare the heart Zoe had sheltered for so long. He spoke the words
she'd pledged to him on *Serenity*, and Zoe nestled back against his chest and
his lips found the spot just under her ear as he breathed her name. Then she
stood, leaving him shivering from the sudden cold, and let Monty guide her hand
to Wash's and the three of them spoke in unison and smiled.

***

She can hear the captain coming, unfocused energy evident in his quick and
heavy steps. Before he can finish bellowing out her name, Kaylee steps into
the hallway with a smile. He doesn't miss a beat. &quot;Saw the job you did on
shuttle two for Zoe an' Wash.&quot; She can't catch his eye, dancing here, there,
everywhere; can't tell if he's pleased or pissed. &quot;Looks mighty nice,&quot; he
continues, talking a mile a minute. &quot;Could you do more of the same for shuttle
number one? No need for leaving around bottles of engine-brewed wine and
flowers everywhere, but it could stand to be spruced up.&quot; She nods willingly.
&quot;Good,&quot; he says, deliberately not letting her get a word in. &quot;I'm gonna stay
with Monty for a few days. Says he's got a fair few ideas about who might want
to rent our shuttle,&quot; he finishes with a brittle grin.

She watches him scurry off the ship and makes her way up the stairs. Halfway
up, it strikes her. She's alone on the boat with Jayne; she can't tell if the
shudder that runs through her is evidence of fear or desire. She turns and
heads for his quarters.

Turns out it's easier than that. He's got a mat spread near his weight-bench,
and he's lying on it doing sit-ups. His movements are extraordinarily smooth,
fluid rather than quick, so that her eye can barely capture one image - the
roundness of his shoulder, the tautness of his stomach - before the next
confronts her. &quot;Jayne,&quot; she finally says, closing her eyes and opening her
mouth. Her eyes flutter open and she sees him sit up one last time, ending his
routine so abruptly it seems as if he's lunged at her. His eyes are boring
into her. At her silence, he flips over and begins his push-ups. Now she's
watching him snap into place each time his elbows lock, and she feels like
she's being hypnotized. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she ventures.

&quot;Sorry what? Sorry I play with knives?&quot;

&quot;Just sorry.&quot;

&quot;No, you ain't.&quot; It's a statement, devoid of emotion.

&quot;Truly, I swear,&quot; she avows, carefully hedging around any specifics.

And he's on his feet, towering over her, and she takes a step backward. He
grins and advances. &quot;You still think I might hurt you.&quot; She can smell his
sweat, and her body betrays her again. He takes in her parting lips and
darkening eyes. &quot;Say it,&quot; he demands.

&quot;I still want you,&quot; she says instead, capitulating, and reaches for him.

He steps back. &quot;My way.&quot; She stills, uncertain of what that might mean. His
eyes are giving away nothing. Finally, she nods. &quot;No talking,&quot; he says as he
pulls her top over her head. He's bending down to unfasten her pants when she
stoops to kiss him. He gets her lower lip between his teeth and tugs her mouth
open for the kiss that comes after he releases her. He uses the sides of his
feet to strip her pants off her, the underwear tangling around her ankles. She
breaks the kiss, stumbling away to rid herself of clothes entirely, and he
takes the opportunity to do the same. He turns back to her, twisting at the
waist, his arm raised and bent at the elbow. She stiffens, a cold sweat
suddenly drenching her as she reacts to the knife he's got in his hand. It's
her dream all over again. But she doesn't feel a blade shen he drags the backs
of his fingers heavily across her breasts and the nightmare begins to dissolve.
Her mind seems to shut down entirely when he brushes the rough pad of one long
finger insistently over her clit. She's barely standing, but she has just
enough wherewithal to reach down and lace her fingers through his, pulling
first that hand and then the other away. Joined only by their clasped hands,
she walks backward until she can sense one of *Serenity*'s smooth, welcoming
walls behind her. She lets go of his hands then, and he's on her, teeth,
fingers, tongues, palms. Her back is skidding up and down the wall as he
pushes into her, not seeming to tire.

Every time one of her moans is cut short by the hitching of her breath, Jayne
knows he can't let this be over anytime soon. She's afraid of his hands and
the weapons they carry. But at this moment, his fingers are slick with her
wetness. She sees him as an animal; he delicately grasps her shoulder with his
teeth, teasing the flesh with his tongue, and she responds with hard little
biting nips along his jawline. And all the while, he's thrusting insistently
into her, and the thick brushed-metal wall behind her is getting hot. He
comes, finally, and afterwards, in the stillness before he lets her slide down
and out of his arms, he sees the tears leaking from her eyes; she bit her lower
lip to shreds trying not to speak. &quot;Kaylee,&quot; he says gently, cupping her
cheek; he didn't mean for her to be so slavishly obedient.

She looks up to meet his eyes. &quot;Jayne,&quot; she says, leaning forward to wind her
arms around him once more.

***

He opens his mouth to ask Barak what it felt like to lose a limb, then decides
he's not drunk enough to ask the question innocently. He knows Barak wouldn't
be offended - he'd been the one to keep the rest of Barak intact - but he knows
too that Monty and, hell, maybe even Barak and Riddler and Jenny, would know
what he really meant was that he felt lost without Zoe.

Well, fine. God lets you down; Zoe never will. There's no shame in putting
all your faith in her. But he never thought he'd feel this wide open, cracked
crookedly from side to side, just because she wasn't standing beside him.

He gets up, a little unsteady on his feet, and waves off Monty's fuzzy offer to
put him up for the night. Back to *Serenity*, where Zoe loves him, where Zoe
will return. He hears Barak saying something in a tone befitting a nagging
wife and he nods noncommittally, raising his glass in a last salute before he
turns and heads home.
