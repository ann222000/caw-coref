Last thanksgiving.  I finally got the turkey right, moist and well
seasoned, and the gravy wasn't burnt!

Jill's Stuffed Flounder

4 flounder fillets, about 1-1/2 lbs. of like size
1/4 c. minced onion
1/4 c. minced celery
2 cloves garlic, minced
1-1/2 Tbs. mayonnaise
dash Tabasco sauce
dash cayenne pepper
dash salt
4 Tbs. butter
1/2 c. dried breadcrumbs
1/4 tsp. dry mustard
1 Tbs. lemon juice
6 oz. flaked crabmeat
2 oz. diced shrimp (or use canned baby shrimp)
2-3 Tbs. melted butter
Sweet ground paprika for colour
1/2 c. milk
vegetable cooking spray

Preheat oven to 350F.  Saute onion, celery and garlic in 4 Tbs. butter until
translucent.  Transfer to a mixing bowl and combine with breadcrumbs,
mayonnaise, dry mustard.  Add crabmeat and shrimp, Tabasco, cayenne,
lemonjuice, salt, pepper.  Blend well to make stuffing.  Spray a 13X9 inch
baking dish with vegetable cooking spray.  Place 2 flounder fillets in the
dish.  Spoon the crabmeat stuffing onto the center of the fillets, mounding
it up in the center.  Split the remaining fillets in half lengthwise. Wrap
each of the two halves around the stuffing on top of the stuffed fillet,
covering the sides but leaving the stuffing visible in the center.  Secure
overlapping ends with toothpicks if needed. Brush all over with melted
butter.  Sprinkle with paprika. Pour the milk around the fish (this keeps
the fish moist during baking).  Bake for 20-25 minutes until fish flakes
easily with a fork, brushing with melted butter about halfway through
cooking. Serves 2.

NOTE:  I've also stuffed tilapia fillets in a similar manner since when I
came up with this dish flounder wasn't nearly as expensive as it is now and
tilapia continues to be the most inexpensive fillets I can buy.  Any light
tasting white fish fillets will do.

I've impressed Presidents and other dignitaries with specially customized
[classified: SECRET] ham, Monterey jack cheese and spinach omelettes, for the
brief moment in time when I wore a chef's hat.

My green death tuna salad sandwiches AND my Mexcellent cheeseburgers always
get accolades.

For myself, it's hands down the Thai chicken satay with peanut dipping sauce

Surprisingly, on hidden camera, most begged for cheese on Ritz crackers.

What do they know that I don't? &lt;g&gt;

Somehow I don't think your looking for this one. I like it immensely, and my
parents loved it too when they were visiting. There was no point of them
begging for more, because what was served was all there was. Kids, on the
otherhand, would running from the room screaming if I had ever served it to
them. I knew better than to try, plus it would be too much work for larger
numbers of people.

It's fresh shucked oysters poached in some of their own liquor and butter,
with white wine, a touch of Tabasco and a touch of Angostora added. The
vegetable was wilted spinach with raisins, a small amount of garlic, and a
much bigger touch of Angostura added. And rice as the starch. Unfortunately,
there is no recipe for either... I eyeball it as I go, depending on the
amount I'm making. The balance of flavors in both the oysters and the
spinach is critical, using that odd combination of ingredients.

The hard part is shucking the oysters. Even though I'm quite proficient
doing it, I'm not about to do it and have someone turn their noses up
because they don't like shellfish.

Talk about turning a kid's stomach... RAW oysters! ;-) I love them though.

You must come from a difference region than me. Maybe I'd like a Rheingold
instead. I don't know Dixie but maybe you know Rheingold, at least from
their catchy jingle sung to Emile Waldteufel's Estudiantina waltz:

My beer is Rheingold the dry beer.
Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer.
It's not bitter, not sweet, it's the extra dry treat
Won't you try extra dry Rheingold beer?

The tune is immediately recognizable if you were exposed to it.

I think the best I ever did was Beouf en Croute, serving size Beef
Wellingtons. My wife found the recipe in a french cook book and claimed to
have done all the shopping for ingredients, then left me to prepare it
while she went out.  The basics were simple enough, roast a chunk of beef
tenrdeloin, cover it with pate wrap it in pastry, bake it and serve it with
a sauce. The problem was that it called for bits of other recipes, like
brown sauce, mushroom flavouring, see page such and such,  There turned out
to be about a half down other recipes I had to use to make up the
ingredients for the dish I was cooking. I ended up faking a lot of those,
including using regular pie dough, which I had on hand, instead of puff
pastry. It was delicious.

A close second would be the braised lamb shanks with caramelized onions.

Unfortunately, Miss Rheingold was a little before my time. I only caught the
tail end of the Rheingold era after I became legal age.

There's a selection of old Miss Rheingold posters on the revival Rheingold

There's even one that is food related:

Personally, I think most of the "picky eater" thing is brought on by the
parents. Once my brother was visiting with his family. My brother, nephew
and I ate steamed blue crabs (cooked by me). I knew my sister-in-law and my
twin nieces were not going to eat that. So I suggested some other kind of
seafood they might like at the big seafood market we were at. I thought
everyone eats shrimp. My sister-in-law said "I don't eat seafood".
Immediately afterwards I hear an echo as the twins chime in in unison: "We
don't eat seafood". Gee, I wonder where they got that from? ;-)

I'm sorry I can't be more specific, but both of those things (the oysters
and the spinach) I made up by myself, and I don't measure, I just eyeball
it. For the oysters, after poaching them, I take them out and reduce the
sauce a bit. I made that recipe up all on my own. For the spinach, it was
roughly inspired by a tapas selection I ate at a local restaurant (Jaleo, in
the Penn Quarter, DC). It was years ago (shortly after it opened in the
early 1990s). I just looked at their web site, and the closest thing on the
menu now (I'm not sure it's the same item) is called "Espinacas a la
Catalana" and the description of it says "Spinach sautéed with pine nuts,
raisins and apples". Their web site is at www.jaleo.com .

For me, it's simple shrimp saute'.

I just take fresh, peeled shrimp and put aside.
In the skillet, I mix butter and olive oil (about 2 parts oil to one
part butter), and single clove of pressed garlic.

Get that nice and sizzling and add the shrimp. Quickly sprinkle on some
salt free lemon pepper and dried dill weed.

Toss the shrimps around gently with a spatula until they are just pink
overall. Only takes a minute or two.

Serve as is, or with some steamed veggies, or over rice cooked in stock.

I like to eat them by themselves, or let them cool and add to a salad.
Dad will snarf all of these I can serve and so will guests!

Also makes a good item to add to Omelets with a bit of Jack cheese.

My favorite "The One" meal is Creole-style stuff eggplant with shrimp,
crabmeat, ham, bread cubes, etc., etc., that I found in The Frugal

carrots braised with garlic, ginger and dill weed make it a pretty

I agree, oysters and spinach are a great combination. I do a different
version, but the spirit is there. I briefly saute fresh spinach in
olive oil and garlic, grind in a little fresh nutmeg along with pepper
flakes and S&amp;P, put the oysters on top, and broil the whole thing.

A stuffed pork loin.  I've posted links to my preparation with pictures on
the Kamado forum.

Once, I was smoking some for a family party.  Unknown to me, one of the
guests was a vegetarian.  The smell must have gotten to him, because he came
outside to "help" me, asked all sorts of questions about the stuffing,
preparation, cooking times, et cetera.
Next thing we knew, he had a finished one serving, and was back for seconds.
So much for his vegetarianism. ;-)

&gt; twins chime in in unison: &quot;We don't eat seafood&quot;. Gee, I wonder where
&gt; they got that from? ;-)
">

Yup. I think you have a point there. DH and I have our likes and
dislikes, but we encourage her to try *all* the stuff we each like, if
you know what I mean?. For instance, DH is not big on cheese; I like it,
so I buy it, doesn't bother him. If I want to make something "cheesy"
now and again, I do, he will have something else...  but she has decided
she likes cheese too. If she really doesn't like something we don't make
a big issue of it, but so far that hasn't been much ;) However, I have
been warned by a few that she might "go off" stuff she likes now once
she goes to school - because it boils down to the same thing: peer
pressure. If Little Johnny tells her he doesn't like crab (or whatever)
she may change her mind. I sincerely hope not ;)

&gt; I'm sorry I can't be more specific, but both of those things (the
&gt; oysters and the spinach) I made up by myself, and I don't measure, I
&gt; just eyeball it. For the oysters, after poaching them, I take them out
&gt; and reduce the sauce a bit. I made that recipe up all on my own. For the
&gt; spinach, it was roughly inspired by a tapas selection I ate at a local
&gt; restaurant (Jaleo, in the Penn Quarter, DC). It was years ago (shortly
&gt; after it opened in the early 1990s). I just looked at their web site,
&gt; and the closest thing on the menu now (I'm not sure it's the same item)
&gt; is called &quot;Espinacas a la Catalana&quot; and the description of it says
&gt; &quot;Spinach sautéed with pine nuts, raisins and apples&quot;. Their web site is
&gt; at www.jaleo.com .

Thanks for the ideas anyway - and the link. I have gleaned a fairly good
idea where to start, so I'll "experiment". Hey, that's all part of the
fun isn't it?

The best single dish may have been the lamb chops stuffed with
oysters and topped with anchovy butter.

I love shrimp. It is versatile and always delicious.

I have made some really good meals at home with shrimp, but the all time
best restaurant meal I ever had was a shrimp dish. IIRC it was called
Shrimp Barcelona. It was sautéed red pepper, green onion, tomato, shrimp,
lots of garlic, and cilantro wit a bit of wine.  I drove my wife crazy. I
had oohing and awing with every mouthful in the restaurant, all the way
home and all evening.

I always enjoy BBQ shrimp. I soak them in a marinade of olive oil, lime
juice, lots of salt, some pepper, hot sauce, Worcestershire Sauce, parsley
and hot sauce.  I prefer to marinate and cook them in the shell. It is
messier to eat, but they taste so much better.

&gt; It's fresh shucked oysters poached in some of their own liquor and butter,
&gt; with white wine, a touch of Tabasco and a touch of Angostora added.
">

I vote for this one.  My best also includes fresh shucked oysters under the
broiler on the half shell with a topping. i. e. Bienville, or Rockefeller
or just some butter and the Tabasco shot.  The customers will line up for
'em.

Porterhouse on the grill, patio potatoes (potatoes, peppers, garlic
and onions grilled in packets),  fresh asparagus and fresh homemade
garlic bread.  Bass Ale in bottles.  (The first time I cooked for
DH.)  Haven't been able to cook a steak as well since!

Hm. Guess I will really have to try that some time...
To date, I always peel shrimp before cooking it.

Hot and fast seems to be the key to the perfect shrimp, just like the
perfect steak. :-)

I've not made one in years...

I kinda got ruined by dad's veggie/meatloafs and mom's onion meat loafs!
More onions than meat. :-P And the onions were still crunchy and
undercooked (sorry mom!).

It just kinda ruined me for the entire concept, but I'm always willing
to re-learn. ;-)

I'd have to be REALLY drunk to try raw oysters. &lt;shudder&gt;
Granted, I DO like sashimi, but there is just something really gross
about raw Oysters, and I can eat and enjoy raw eggs.

Hypocritical maybe, but them's the breaks. &lt;G&gt;
