sodomize women in my family, has said, repeatedly, that advocates for
choice had vandalized churches.

Excessively fat women look ugly. It is impractical to try and have sex when
she's 100lbs overweight and the weight is all fat - but most women ain't
that big.

You of course do know what a lot of Asian women prefer, right? Besides,
after fucking a cute asian chick, experience tells me it isn't all that
except that she looks good on your arm. In bed it ain't much at all. If the
lights go out, any guy whose hormones are more fixed on performance than
looks, is going to go to sleep right there and then.

Why so much hate ?

What about noisy kids and parents who will ask you to switch seat with them
so they can be close to their kids ? We could go on and on about things we
do not like to tolerate. But the fact is we live in a world where people
are different. Some are fat, some are thin. Some are nice, some are
annoying. Some are respectful of others, some are intolerant. That's a
fact of life.

----------------------------------------------------
I will not even attempt to explain my love of lesbianism
and boar semen. My friends know that lesbian boar sex is
a beautiful thing and my enemies will never believe that
the love between a fat lesbian and a hot rutting boar is
the highest expression of feminism. I do not give a damn
about my enemies.
They can rot in Hell.
--------------------------------------------------
The real Lady Veteran just loves anonymous
remailers. If you read something that looks
like it is from Lady Veteran and the originator
isn't an anonymous remailer-it is a FORGERY by
certain diseases called heterosexuals.
The REAL Lady Veteran has nothing to hide about
her lesbianism and love of creamy boar sex and
is not ashamed to stand up and be counted for her
beliefs as a lesbian, boar loving and smelly woman.

&gt; Marty the owner of this group has made me horny then
&gt; turned down my offers to join in bristly boar orgies.
&gt; He will be brought up on charges any minute now. He
&gt; is being warned. At any moment he will be charged.
&gt; I am warning him. Right now. At this time. Because he
&gt; will be warned. This is a warning. A final warning.
&gt; I warn him. That was the last warning. Marty I warn you.
&gt; That is the only warning he will get. Marty you better
&gt; watch out. I am giving you this only final last warning.
&gt; I mean it this time. Better watch out. For the rest
&gt; of your life you will be looking over your shoulder
&gt; wondering if I am warning you for the last time...and
&gt; I shall be busy drowning my sorrows in boar semen.

&gt; Robin King lives her fantasies involving sex with big fat stinky boars.
&gt; She can't have my sticky goodness of boar semen. It is all mine.
&gt; ----------------------------------------------------
&gt; I will not even attempt to explain my love of lesbianism
&gt; and boar semen. My friends know that lesbian boar sex is
&gt; a beautiful thing and my enemies will never believe that
&gt; the love between a fat lesbian and a hot rutting boar is
&gt; the highest expression of feminism. I do not give a damn
&gt; about my enemies.
&gt; They can rot in Hell.

&gt; The real Lady Veteran just loves anonymous
&gt; remailers. If you read something that looks
&gt; like it is from Lady Veteran and the originator
&gt; isn't an anonymous remailer-it is a FORGERY by
&gt; certain diseases called heterosexuals.
&gt; The REAL Lady Veteran has nothing to hide about
&gt; her lesbianism and love of creamy boar sex and
&gt; is not ashamed to stand up and be counted for her
&gt; beliefs as a lesbian, boar loving and smelly woman.
