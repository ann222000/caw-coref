Who is they?  I think it is the same people who you are trying to get
to sign the petition.  Auto mfgs are not sure enough people will buy
electric cars to make it worth their while to pay the development non-
recurring costs.

You would be surprised how much effort these companies put into
determining what customers want.  People are afraid Ecars will leave
them stranded or inconvenienced with the state-of-the-art of current
battery cars.

Hybrids are something else, but again most customers these days are
into more performance, so MOST of the new hybrids use the technology
to increase performance, not cut down on fuel usage or emissions.

Until you can convince the buying public that current cars have more
than enough performance, you won't get anywhere. Cars are more than
transportation, and symbolic of POWER.  People want more POWER.  Find
a way to change the buying public on that issue and you will be doing
a worthwhile thing.

Forcing mfgs to produce things the consumer will not buy risks
damaging our economy.

Personally my ten year old car has MORE than enough performance but I
know so many friends just have to have more POWER/PERFORMANCE!

Precisely who are the &quot;they&quot; that are keeping the electric car from
us.

Since the EV1 was leased and not sold you never owned it so there is
nothing to return to you.  GM was under no obligation to sell your car
to you.  I can understand why GM would not want to shoulder the
ongoing maintenance of a car they had no intention of selling in the
long term.

Do you really believe nonsense like:  &quot;Once it appeared that it was
going to be a success, GM recalled all of the vehicles, and then
shredded all of them.&quot;  Do you really believe a company like GM with
all of their financial troubles would invest the billions of dollars
to tool up a new car only to kill it because it was successful?

It's the government done it.  See, since the government was taken over
by the General Motors division of Sony, they have been pressuring everyone
to use more and more gasoline.  For example, the Texaco Division of Sony
(formerly owned by the Vatican Division of the International Communist
Conspiracy) has been showing record profits in the last couple of years.
This is because the Federal Trade Commission (now a division of Sony)
has been encouraging advertising of larger and larger vehicles to get
the American Population to use larger gasoline.  That's why every car
manufacturer from Toyota (which is secretly controlled by the John Birch
Society Division of Sony) on up to BMW (actually a division of the Bavarian
Illuminati and Hanseatic League divisions of Sony) are producing huge SUVs.

ALL of this is the result of the Anti-Catholic League.  See, the
Anti-Catholic league division of Sony wants to encourage the use of
birth control.  Higher gas prices, combined with much larger average
car sizes, means teenagers are much more apt to go out on parking dates
where birth control is used, rather than taking dates on long drives.

&gt; Electric conversion is about 90% efficient.

That's certainly true for electric input to an electric motor compared
to mechanical power out. But batteries throw a big SNAFU in the mix.

Battery CHARGING efficiency is relatively poor, meaning that a pretty
big chunk of the power that comes out of the wall plug is never going to
get to the wheels of the car. I don't remember the latest efficiencies
for different battery technologies, but charging efficiency is not all
that far off from the peak efficiency of a  good internal-combustion
engine, particularly a constant speed turbo-diesel. You can easily prove
this- feel your laptop battery or your cell phone battery after it's
been charging for a while- they get hot because not all the input power
gets stored, a lot is lost to heat.

IMO, and I could be wrong but I don't think I am, the overall most
efficient vehicle package would be a hybrid electric vehicle with a
small constant-speed (or two-speed ala Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive)
common-rail injected turbo diesel. And this still neglects manufacturing
energy- when you factor THAT in, a direct-to-wheels (ie conventional!)
small diesel or gas engine probably wins when you look at the total raw
material-to-the-crusher energy budget of a vehicle.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; Gas engines are way less.
&gt; All other things being equal, a full electric should be more efficient

Charging efficiency depends a lot on the speed of charging.  If you are
willing to put up with a slow trickle charge for a couple days, you can
get nice high efficiencies even with lead-acid cells.  If you want to
charge quickly, and everyone does, you will have to put up with badly
reduced charging efficiency.

Ultracapacitors (which are secretly batteries in disguise) help this
situation a bit, but not miraculously.

The thing about gasoline is the energy density is so damn high.  With
a pure electric vehicle, you lose so much energy just lugging the batteries
around wherever you go.  It's getting better, though.

When you strip everything else away, that is indeed the crux. NOTHING is
better than hydrocarbons at packing huge amounts of energy into a tiny
volume and light weight, and doing so rather safely. In fact, diesel has
more energy density than gasoline and you can practially put out a fire
with a bucket of #2 diesel (OK, thats an exaggeration, but its not

Well, that's the advantage of the whole hydrogen car thing.  You take your
electricity, use it to produce hydrogen which is easier to store and
ligher than comparably-powered batteries, and use that.  Of course, hydrogen
isn't half as easy to store as gasoline... but it took auto manufacturers
a long time to figure out how to store gasoline safely as it is.

HOT AIR.The Article about the compressed-air car (''Driving on Thin
Air,'' June '07) was so amazing and revoluntionary that I can't believe
that you didn't feature it on your cover.A car with a range of 125
miles, up to 68 miles per hour, using nothing but air as it's on-board
fuel source? If true, the implicatins for gasoline and pollution
reduction, not to mention the national security and economic
ramifications, are earth-shattering.Don Koplen Boulder,Colorado.

That's very true, and would be even more so if you had a plug-in station
at BOTH ENDS of your commute. That way, the car's battery pack could be
even smaller and lighter and less energy would be wasted in hauling
around battery instead of payload.

I don't like paying those prices either, but I blame American drivers
more than the automakers.  As the price of gas has been going up, so
has the consumption!

No one is even TRYING to use less gas. No one is slowing down, no one
is avoiding heavy braking, or doing any coasting.  When I drive a few
mph slower, or coast when a light way ahead turns red, all I get is
tailgating and nasty looks!

One doesn't need to stop driving (a sour grapes statement). You don't
even need to drive fewer miles.  Just use less gas when you do drive
by driving in economy mode.

When you coast, yours is the only car on the road that coasts at that
speed. That means every single person behind you has to work at riding
their brakes for as long as you are having fun coasting.

If you're driving a few MPH slower than traffic, and you're in the right
lane, then those who are hassling you are bozos. If you're going slower
in any but the right lane, you're basically going out of your way to
be rude and obnoxious, and in some states you're breaking the law as
well.

Kudos to you for trying to conserve. But remember that the traffic lights
alone in many places will waste more gasoline than just about anything else.
