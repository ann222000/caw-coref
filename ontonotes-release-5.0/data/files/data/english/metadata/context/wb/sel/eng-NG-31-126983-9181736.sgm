'A Nightmare With No End in Sight'
Former Top U.S. Commander Rips Bush Administration's Effort in Iraq

WASHINGTON (Oct. 13) - In a sweeping indictment of the four-year
effort in Iraq , the former top American commander called the Bush
administration's handling of the war incompetent and warned that the
United States was &quot;living a nightmare with no end in sight.&quot;

In one of his first major public speeches since leaving the Army in
late 2006, retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez blamed the
administration for a &quot;catastrophically flawed, unrealistically
optimistic war plan&quot; and denounced the current &quot;surge&quot; strategy as a
&quot;desperate&quot; move that will not achieve long-term stability.

&quot;After more than fours years of fighting, America continues its
desperate struggle in Iraq without any concerted effort to devise a
strategy that will achieve victory in that war-torn country or in the
greater conflict against extremism,&quot; Mr. Sanchez said, at a gathering
here of military reporters and editors.

General Sanchez is the most senior in a string of retired generals to
harshly criticize the administration's conduct of the war. Asked
following his remarks why he waited nearly a year after his retirement
to outline his views, he responded that that it was not the place of
active duty officers to challenge lawful orders from civilian
authorities. General Sanchez, who is said to be considering a book,
promised further public statements criticizing officials by name.

&quot;There was been a glaring and unfortunate display of incompetent
strategic leadership within our national leaders,&quot; he said, adding
later in his remarks that civilian officials have been &quot;derelict in
their duties&quot; and guilty of a &quot;lust for power.&quot;

The White House had no initial comment.

But his role as commander in Iraq during the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse
scandal leaves General Sanchez vulnerable to criticism that that he is
shifting the blame from himself and exacting revenge against an
administration that replaced him as the top commander in the aftermath
of the scandal and declined to nominate him for a fourth star, forcing
his retirement.

Though he was cleared of wrongdoing in the abuse matter by an Army
investigation, he nonetheless became a symbol, along with officials
like L. Paul Bremer III , the chief administrator in Iraq, of the
ineffective American leadership early in the occupation.

Questioned by reporters after his speech, he included the military and
himself among those who made mistakes in Iraq, citing the failure to
insist on a better post-invasion stabilization plan.

But his main criticism was leveled at the Bush administration, which
he said he said has failed to mobilize the entire United States
government, other than the military, to contribute meaningfully to
reconstructing and stabilizing Iraq.

Asked after his remarks what strategy he favored, General Sanchez
ticked off a series of steps - from promoting reconciliation among
Iraq's warring sectarian factions to building effective Iraqi army and
police units - that closely paralleled the list of tasks frequently
cited by the Bush administration.

But he said that the administration had failed crafted a detailed
strategy for achieving those steps that went beyond the use of
military force.

&quot;The administration, Congress  and the entire inter-agency, especially
the State Department, must shoulder responsibility for the
catastrophic failure, and the American people must hold them
accountable,&quot; General Sanchez said.

The liberals had a field day bashing Sanchez over the head with Abu Ghraib.
Now he's their poster boy.  ROTPLOL

I saw this report about Sanchez on cnn this morning.  They said that he was
up for promotion, and when he was passed over he then decided to retire.  So
if I understand the implication, if he got the promotion he would still be
on the &quot;team&quot; so to speak.  Interesting.

Speaking of the media in that speech he also said:

&quot;The death knell of your ethics has been enabled by your parent
organizations who have chosen to align themselves with political agendas.
What is clear to me is that you are perpetuating the corrosive partisan
politics that is destroying our country and killing out servicemenvers (sic)
who are at war.
My assessment is that your profession, to some extent, has strayed from
these ethical standards and allowed extrenal agendas to manipulate what the
American public sees on TV, what they read in our newspapers and what they
see on the web. For some of you, just like some politicians, the truth is of
little to no value if it does not fit your preconceived notions, baises and
agendas.&quot;

&quot;There has been a glaring, unfortunate, display of incompetent strategic
leadership within our national leaders. As a Japanese proverb says, &quot;Action
without vision is a nightmare.&quot; There is no question that America is living
a nightmare with no end in sight.
Since 2003, the politics of war have been characterized by partisanship as
the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington.
National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have
prevented us from decising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At
times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that
endangered the lives of our sons and daughters on the battlefield. The
unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than
our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure is the
first step toward acheiving victory in Iraq - without bipartisan cooperation
we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going on in Washington that would
give us hope.&quot;

Some of the wounds he suffers are self inflcited, but some are not.  It
doesn't matter as he has become a rather bitter individual.

No doubt that some matter of revenge is in the works here along with
plenty of other reasons for him to voice his opinions including some
monitary and celebrity benifits. However, that does not mean that what
he is saying is not true. Often times, telling the truth is the best
revenge you can get.

He did get the drubbing he deserved from that liberals over Abu Ghraib
so he surley feels he owes us nothing. Thad does not mean the we
cannot laud his attempts so shed some light on the evil of the current
administration.

It may be unlikely that we can take anyone at their word about the
situation in Iraq. But it sure looks bad when pretty much every top
Military person who has served in Iraq and eventually retired has come
out against the Bush Administration's handling of the so called War on
Terror. The cumulitive effect sure seems to tell us that the Liberals
are correct about Bush and his incompetent or even evil minions.

Sanchez is like the war criminal Robert McNamara, though he seems to
have come to his senses a bit earlier.  And he probably won't
understand why he's not being forgiven --and he's not-- by either the
right or the left.

October 17, 2007

Pig notions

Retired Army Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, who was commander of
coalition forces in Iraq for one year until 2004, made headlines in
recent days with his sharp critique of the Bush administration's
&quot;catastrophically flawed, unrealistically optimistic war plan&quot; and
&quot;unfortunate display of incompetent strategic leadership.&quot;

What barely got reported, however, were the general's choice words for
members of the press, particularly the &quot;snippets&quot; coverage of the
Iraqi war by often-&quot;biased&quot; TV news networks.

&quot;The death knell of your ethics has been enabled by your parent
organizations, who have chosen to align themselves with political
agendas,&quot; Gen. Sanchez charged in his luncheon remarks Friday to
reporters and editors who cover the U.S. military. &quot;What is clear to
me is that you are perpetuating the corrosive partisan politics that
is destroying our country and killing our service members who are at
war.

&quot;My assessment is that your profession, to some extent, has strayed
from these ethical standards and allowed external agendas to
manipulate what the American public sees on TV, what they read in our
newspapers and what they see on the Web. For some of you, just like
some of our politicians, the truth is of little or no value if it does
not fit your own preconceived notions, biases and agenda.&quot;

Gen. Sanchez said one highly respected reporter once confided in him
that &quot;there are some amongst you who 'feed from a pig's trough.' If
that is who I am dealing with, then I will never respond; otherwise,
we will both get dirty and the pig will love it. This does not mean
that your story is accurate.&quot;

I've talked first-hand to people who've been to Iraq, and every single
one has told me that despite what you read in the press, a lot of
progress has been made there, and the progress continues.  With
America's help, the Iraqis are building schools and hospitals.
Infrastructures like electrical service and running water have been
restored to many Iraqi people.  Economies are improving.  One woman (a
civilian lawyer on loan to the State Department) I talked to said she
spent six months in Iraq helping to write securities and stock trading
laws.  If they have to worry about stock trading, things must be
looking up.  She also said she spent her six months living in the
Green Zone, and felt no more in danger than you would in any other big
city.

Sorry, but I refuse to believe everything going on over there is all
bad.

Sure, I can believe that some things are going right in certain small
areas of the country. But what you refuse to believe is that things
are going band in most of it.

You don't have a monopoly on talking to people who have a first hand
account of what is going on in Iraq. Contrary to the rosie picture you
paint, every single person I have talked to that has been there paints
a very different story.

Evenmy sister who, before going over there, was a super patriot, super
Jew hating Christian. Now she is quite bitter about our government and
how screwed up things are over there.

So, If I take my sister's view, combine it with SOME reports from the
news and add to that the opinions of pretty much every retired U.S.
General that has led our troops in Iraq, I think we can come up with a
pretty accurate view of what is going on over there.

BTW, what is the war costing us in good ole U,S. dollars? About 9
Billion a Week? How long do you think we can last as a country with
that kind of expenditure? Maybe Enron can give us a loan.

&quot;Spent six months living in the green zone' is some qualification on the
general security.

We're told there are 'only' 30 or so car bombs a month and that an
improvement bragging point.

Any where else in the world and that would be a crisis of massive
proportions.

As to the folk you've talked to first hand.  I, too, have talked to a lot
and not one, even hard core guho Bush supporters, have given me any
impression that even some of the goings on are positive.  Most use words

C'mon CB, don't you know by now that the political center is wherever ER
stands.

At least he's consistent, you gotta give him that... consistently wrong.

All that being said, for the most part, when reading through the posts in
AppyLand, the most intolerant and racist comments come from the lefties.
It's not hard to see that if the political left were to win the legislative

&gt; &gt; The liberals had a field day bashingSanchezover the head with Abu
&gt; &gt; Ghraib.
&gt; &gt; Now he's their poster boy. ROTPLOL

&gt; &gt; I saw this report aboutSanchezon cnn this morning. They said that he was
&gt; &gt; up for promotion, and when he was passed over he then decided to retire.
&gt; &gt; So
&gt; &gt; if I understand the implication, if he got the promotion he would still
&gt; &gt; be
&gt; &gt; on the &quot;team&quot; so to speak. Interesting.

&gt; Here's what else Sanchez had to say, which was not printed in the
&gt; Leftist media, natch.

&gt; Inside the Beltway
&gt; John McCaslin
&gt; October 17, 2007

&gt; Pig notions

&gt; Retired Army Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, who was commander of
&gt; coalition forces in Iraq for one year until 2004, made headlines in
&gt; recent days with his sharp critique of the Bush administration's
&gt; &quot;catastrophically flawed, unrealistically optimistic war plan&quot; and
&gt; &quot;unfortunate display of incompetent strategic leadership.&quot;

&gt; What barely got reported, however, were the general's choice words for
&gt; members of the press, particularly the &quot;snippets&quot; coverage of the
&gt; Iraqi war by often-&quot;biased&quot; TV news networks.

&gt; &quot;The death knell of your ethics has been enabled by your parent
&gt; organizations, who have chosen to align themselves with political
&gt; agendas,&quot; Gen. Sanchez charged in his luncheon remarks Friday to
&gt; reporters and editors who cover the U.S. military. &quot;What is clear to
&gt; me is that you are perpetuating the corrosive partisan politics that
&gt; is destroying our country and killing our service members who are at
&gt; war.

&gt; &quot;My assessment is that your profession, to some extent, has strayed
&gt; from these ethical standards and allowed external agendas to
&gt; manipulate what the American public sees on TV, what they read in our
&gt; newspapers and what they see on the Web. For some of you, just like
&gt; some of our politicians, the truth is of little or no value if it does
&gt; not fit your own preconceived notions, biases and agenda.&quot;

&gt; Gen. Sanchez said one highly respected reporter once confided in him
&gt; that &quot;there are some amongst you who 'feed from a pig's trough.' If
&gt; that is who I am dealing with, then I will never respond; otherwise,
&gt; we will both get dirty and the pig will love it. This does not mean
&gt; that your story is accurate.&quot;

&gt; -CB
&gt; &quot;I hate newspapermen. They come into camp and pick up their camp
&gt; rumors and print them as facts. I regard them as spies, which, in
&gt; truth, they are. If I killed them all there would be news from Hell
&gt; before breakfast.&quot;
&gt; -William Tecumseh Sherman
">

It is common for Governments and Military people to be nasty to the
press when are doing something nasty, illegal or, like Sherman, that
they are not very proud of.

When a war is going one direction and you want people back home to
believe it is going another direction, the last thing you want it a
free press. Especially if you are Dick and W.

Well, Mr. Top Poster. What I wrote may have been intolerant against
intolerance and racists, but it was hardly racist. I am curious about
how you think my description of the &quot;good Christians&quot; I went to church
with was racist since every one of them was just as white as me.

Methinks you are just trying to play the racist card.

Another empty statement.  How do you see that?  Where do you see
that?  What are you basing this vision of on?

We're living in a fascist state, Idiot, and that's the real threat to
&quot;freedom as we have come to know it.&quot;

But what the hell: fascism's something an Idiot isn't likely to know
anything about.

Getting back to the topic which provoked your silliness, the myth that
there's a leftist media in this country is comforting to Idiots, but
completely lacking in truth.

Media is owned by three or four corporations, run by boards and
directors which range from very conservative to reactionary to out-and-
out fascists.

Shrub's globalism, his oil-based war, his Patriot Act, all of it's
gotten a free and uncritical pass from the media.

How you find a liberal bias in that is one of those things that
passeth all understanding.

Except this: you clearly don't know what &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;leftist&quot; mean,
except as defined by Faux News types.

--
Now, in order to be considered a &quot;liberal,&quot;
only one thing is required   a failure to
pledge blind loyalty to George W. Bush.
Whether one is a &quot;liberal&quot; -- or, for that
matter, a &quot;conservative&quot; -- is now no longer
a function of one's actual political views, but
is a function purely of one's personal loyalty
to George Bush.&quot;

The WALL OF HEROS to people who hate fascism (reason in brackets)

Stalin (promotes workers paradise)
Walter Duranty (NYT Pulitzer Prize Winner)
Mao (cultural revolution)
Hitler (Kills Jews)
Pol Pot (population control in Cambodia)
Saddam Hussein (hates America)
Castro (workers Caribbean vacation paradise)
Kim Il Sung (emulates Stalin)

How many people did these heroes of the left kill to prove they were right?

HONORABLE MENTION

Adminijad (same as Hussein)
Kim Jong Il (enjoys pornography, hence free speech)
Chavez (the next Castro)
Carter (Hates Republican presidents and meddles)
FDR (interns Americans)
Clinton (American interns)
