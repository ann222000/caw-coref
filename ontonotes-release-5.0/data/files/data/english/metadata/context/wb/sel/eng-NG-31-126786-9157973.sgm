1 Mass action

1.1 SA vehicle industry workers to down tools today

SABC, 12 September 2007

Workers in the vehicle industry are set to down tools today after wage negotiations failed. Employers have been served with a strike action notice by metalworkers' union, the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (Numsa).

The sector includes component manufacturers, car body builders, auto engineering workshops and car dealers. It does not include car manufacturers and filling stations, which concluded a wage deal recently.

Numsa spokesperson Irvin Jim says employers are sticking to an 8% increase offer, while workers are demand a 9% increase.

1.2 Irate unions, SAA to meet over job cuts

Khulu Phasiwe, Trade and Industry Correspondent, Business Day, 11 September 2007

UNIONS representing cabin crew and ground staff at national carrier South African Airways (SAA) are in a belligerent mood, and will use today's meeting with the airline to vent their anger at its proposal to retrench more than 2000 workers.

The meeting, which will be chaired by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA), comes after SAA told the unions of its plan to retrench staff &quot;due to operational requirements&quot;.

By law the airline has two months to negotiate an amicable settlement with the unions.

SAA said the retrenchment of at least 711 employees and the renegotiation of onerous conditions of employment would result in a cost saving of R638m. A further R110m would be saved by laying off 223 senior managers.

The cost-cutting measures form part of the national carrier's restructuring programme which aims to return the airline to profitability by 2009.

But the South African Transport and Allied Workers' Union (Satawu) and the United Association of SA (Uasa) have vowed to protect their members against forced retrenchments.

&quot;Satawu has always rejected forced retrenchments as a fundamental strategy to give effect to the necessary turnaround process,&quot; said the union's general secretary, Randall Howard.

&quot;Before workers and particularly our members are subjected to forced retrenchment, we will fight for a comprehensive process which unearths inefficiencies and corrects them in the context of cost saving strategies.&quot;

Satawu said although it supported SAA's restructuring programme, it was frustrated by the airline's tendency not to involve unions through &quot;meaningful engagement&quot; in the turnaround process.

The Congress of South African Trade Unions-affiliated union said it was shocked to learn through the media last week that SAA planned to retrench 2232 workers without any consultation with the unions about how it had arrived at that figure.

Satawu said the announcement had resulted in the staff being demoralised, traumatised and unproductive.

&quot;As a result of their anti-labour behaviour, which we have warned them against since the inception of the restructuring process, management has now lost a real opportunity of managing the process in a responsible, mature and joint manner,&quot; Howard said.

SAA GM for human resources, Bhabhalazi Bulunga, said the airline had engaged the unions throughout the development of the restructuring process, and would &quot;work hard at consulting and negotiating with labour in the hope of making some headway on this critical issue&quot;.

Besides retrenchments, SAA's other major objective was to renegotiate the conditions of employment to not only ensure fairness and uniformity for employees, but also to reduce SAA's fixed cost base in the future.

Key among the agreements that SAA wanted to change were the six months of sick leave that some employees enjoyed, the lack of salary caps, and an agreement which stipulated that the airline had to negotiate at all unionised levels if it needed to employ temporary workers.

&quot;If these agreements cannot be altered through negotiations, the R638m saving needed to fully achieve the turnaround will have to be sourced elsewhere,&quot; he said.

&quot;Given that SAA has looked at every aspect of the business and done all it can to reduce costs and grow revenue, the only alternative will be retrenchments.

&quot;The current estimate is that if no savings are achieved in negotiations with labour on employment conditions, a total of 2232 employees will have to be retrenched.&quot;

SAA CEO Khaya Ngqula said other cost-cutting measures included reviewing contracts with suppliers, grounding costly aircraft and eliminating unprofitable routes.

In addition, SAA would be separated into seven business units, each with its own board and CEO.
Ngqula said the rationale for the corporatisation of SAA, expected to be completed in December next year, was also to eliminate inefficiencies and allow management to better understand the costs associated with each subsidiary.

&quot;Going forward, we will focus on our strengths and explore the myriad opportunities for growth, especially in the African market,&quot; said Ngqula.

SAA says its restructuring programme has already begun to bear fruit, with R39m having been saved since the programme was launched in June. The carrier had saved about R18m by cutting discretionary spending and limiting staff duty travel and cellphone usage.

Further savings were expected once ground handling contracts with the Dakar-based Senegal Handling Service and local baggage handler Optima had been renegotiated.

Ngqula said other contracts being renegotiated included the ground handling contract for SAA's operation in Hong Kong and the contract with telephony service provider Transtel.

&quot;If progress made thus far is anything to go by, w e are confident we will achieve the intended benefits of our restructuring process within our 18-month deadline,&quot; Ngqula said.

1.3 KZN rail strike ends

IOL, 12 September 2007

An agreement has been reached with striking train drivers and the United Transport and Allied Trade Union (Utatu) in KwaZulu-Natal, Transnet Freight (formerly Spoornet) said on Tuesday.

Transnet Freight spokesperson Molotwane Likhethe said the union and management had &quot;agreed on a course of action&quot; that would see the strike suspended at midnight on Tuesday.

Likhethe said he could not provide details on what had been agreed with the unions or on what impact the strike was having.

Earlier in the day a small band of about 100 train drivers protested outside Transnet Freight's Durban offices.

Utatu secretary general Chris de Vos said both management and the unions had agreed to the appointment of an independent labour arbitrator.

Once appointed the arbitrator would have to make his recommendations within 14 days and the recommendations would be binding. The arbitrator has yet to be appointed.

Declining to say that the strike was over, De Vos said: &quot;We have put it (the strike) on ice for now.&quot;

Should management not adhere to the findings of the arbitrators, the workers could down tools again, he said.

Utatu deputy general secretary Louis Brocket said on Friday that its members in Durban and Pietermaritzburg had called the strike in response to an &quot;arrogant attitude displayed to the workers&quot; by two leading figures of Transnet Freight's KwaZulu-Natal management.

On Monday De Vos said he believed that at least 50 percent of the freight train operations at three depots - Wentworth and Umbilo in Durban and the Pietermaritzburg depot - had been affected.

Utatu announced the strike on Friday.

Brocket said the union and the national operator were locked in court action over management's decision to unilaterally change the way that hours worked were calculated.

It was not clear whether port operations had been affected. Most of the containers arriving at the Durban Container Terminal are transported by road.

Metrorail operations in Durban were not affected. - Sapa

1.4 Refuse strike turns messy

IOL, 11 September 2007

Three people were injured and 22 striking refuse workers were arrested for intimidation and public disturbance in Pretoria on Tuesday, the City of Tshwane said.

Member of the mayoral committee Gabriel Thwala said the workers were throwing rubbish into the streets and were intimidating non-striking workers, of which three were injured.

He said the police had been called in to contain the situation which had stalled aspects of the clean up process and resulted in not all of the trucks operating.

&quot;Such actions do not at all advance their interests,&quot; he said.

The 1268 workers employed by Milnex went on strike last Monday. They wanted to be directly employed by the municipality rather than through labour brokerage companies contracted to the council.

Thwala said Milnex and its striking employees, who were also SA Municipal Workers' Union (Samwu) members were negotiating in bad faith.

He was speaking after meeting both Milnex and Samwu on Tuesday.

&quot;We have offered to mediate, not because we are obliged to do so, but because we are an affected party.

&quot;It is our services and our ability to serve our residents and institutions that have been affected. We have an obligation to offer services,&quot; said Thwala.

He said the City had obtained a court interdict last Wednesday ordering the workers to go back to work.

The City had deliberately avoided enforcing the order in the hope that the dispute would be resolved.

He said the City also took into account that on average each worker financially supported five other people.

&quot;This means that 6340 people would easily go hungry instantaneously. Terminating the services of these companies easily means that you terminate the employment of these workers,&quot; he said.

Samwu was not immediately available for comment. - Sapa

1.5 Statement updating on the refuse strike

City of  Tshwane, 12 September 2007

The City of Tshwane has expressed frustration at how the parties to the dispute that has led to the refuse strike conduct themselves. After obtaining a court interdict last week Wednesday ordering the workers to go back to work the City has deliberately avoided enforcing the order. This was done with the hope that the parties will ensure that the dispute is resolved.

Speaking on Tuesday afternoon the Member of the Mayoral Committee responsible for Corporate and Shared Services, Mr. Gabriel Thwala, expressed frustration that the parties are negotiating in bad faith. Thwala was speaking after meeting both Milnex and SAMWU, after the two parties requested him to mediate between them.

We have offered to mediate, not because we are obliged to do so, but because we are an affected party. It is our services and our ability to serve our residents and institutions that have been affected. We have an obligation to offer services,  said Thwala.

Asked why the City has not enforced the court order, which effectively terminated the services of service provider companies Thwala indicated the dilemma that the City finds itself.  We can easily do that. We have however taken into account that you are dealing here with 1268 workers. On average a worker supports five people. This means that 6340 people would easily go hungry instantaneously. Terminating the services of these companies easily mean that you terminate the employment of these workers,  said Thwala.

On Tuesday striking workers started to intimidate those who are not on strike. They thrashed rubbish on the streets. The City had to call in the SAPS and Metro Police to contain the situation. Three people were injured by the striking workers. Twenty-two people were arrested for intimidation and public disturbance.

The actions of the striking workers have stalled some aspects of the clean-up process. This after trucks went out this morning with the permanent drivers and temporary workers. However, as soon as they left some of the capacity workers were grabbed by the strikers. As a result not all the trucks as anticipated could go out.

The City condemns the actions of the striking workers. Their actions do not help the situation at all. Instead, they might harden attitudes. Surely, such actions do not at all advance their interests.

1.6 Salary cuts irk workers

Sowetan, 11 September 2007

About 300 support staff at Limpopo schools have complained that money is being deducted from their salaries unlawfully despite not having taken part in the public service strike in June.

This was revealed by the Public Servants Association (PSA) yesterday.

The association said support staff, including secretaries and groundsmen, had their July and August salaries cut though they reported for duty.

The PSA said money amounting to another 11 days would be deducted from their September salaries.

Limpopo Education Department's Ndo Mangala said the problem was being addressed.

Mangala said some of the affected workers had already been refunded. - Sapa

2 Tripartite Alliance

2.1 Cosatu puts pact proposals on table

Xolani Xundu, The Times, 12 September 2007

Cosatu has compiled its proposals for an electoral pact with the ANC - but has not said what it will do if its proposals are not accepted by its alliance partner.

But the union federation emphasised that it would continue to support the ANC and that pulling out of the pact would weaken the alliance and the ANC.

The union said: &quot;The mandate emerging is a tough one, signalling an end to open-ended debate about the nature of the alliance and its minimum programme .&quot;

The federation said in a paper titled The Leadership Challenge that its congress last year had resolved that Cosatu would adopt a hands-on approach in the ANC succession debate.

The document will be discussed at Cosatu's central committee meeting next week .

&quot;This ... marks a departure from Cosatu's historical position that it would not get involved in internal ANC leadership questions.&quot;

The federation will release a list of its preferred candidates for the leadership of the ANC next week.

It is well known that the federation backs ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma's candidacy for the ANC's top job.

Cosatu will not have voting rights at the December national conference of the ANC in Limpopo, but its delegates will attend as observers.

Cosatu has also developed &quot;a set of policy objectives against which to measure the extent to which the ANC is able to shift to represent the interests of the working class&quot;.

Sapa reported yesterday that Cosatu president Willie Madisha said the ANC was &quot;eating itself alive&quot; in its leadership struggle.

Earlier, ANC chairman Mosiuoa Lekota said the continued existence of the tripartite alliance was the only way South Africa could become a socialist country.

2.2 Union hopes to influence ANC with 'wish list'

Boyd Webb, The Star, 12 September 2007

In an unprecedented move by an alliance partner, the Congress of South African Trade Unions said on Tuesday that it would present the ANC with a list of names, which it felt were pro-worker and should form part of its new leadership.

Cosatu General Secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said, while it recognised the labour union federation had no right to nominate candidates, it hoped to influence the process.

ANC nominations open next month.

&quot;We want to actively influence that decision. We have a class interest in who becomes that leadership, we will no longer leave things to chance - we have paid dearly for that (in the past),&quot; he said at a media briefing.

He said the trade union federation had not yet decided how many names it would suggest, but that the list would be presented after a thorough debate at Cosatu's central committee meeting to be held in Kempton Park next week.

Cosatu in KwaZulu-Natal has been the only structure so far that has publicly made its list known, predictably suggesting Jacob Zuma for president, in a list of 20 names for the national executive committee.

Last week, the ANC Youth League, made its top six list public, including Zuma for president, current secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe for deputy president and South African Communist Party chairperson Gwede Mantashe for ANC secretary-general.

The Youth League has mooted Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma as chairperson, Mathews Phosa as treasurer-general and Baleka Mbete as deputy secretary-general.

It is speculated that the Cosatu list could be similar to the ANCYL's one.

Vavi said Cosatu no longer wished to be just an &quot;instrument&quot; in the ANC election machinery but a member of the alliance with its own requirements.

He said Cosatu would start demanding certain policy concessions that supported workers in return for its allegiance to the alliance.

While he made it clear that Cosatu deeply loved the tripartite alliance and fully supported all efforts to unify it, he said the ANC would have to start taking its demands seriously.

&quot;We don't want to feel like we are just election machinery, we don't want to feel like we are just signing a blank cheque for someone to fill in the figures later,&quot; he said.

Vavi said Cosatu had its own &quot;figures&quot; it wanted to written on to that cheque and those were contained in the union's discussion document for next week's meeting. The &quot;extraordinary steps&quot; which Cosatu had taken to suggest a list of names was one of the key points in the discussion document.

He said it highlighted a number of qualities Cosatu sought in future ANC leaders, including a &quot;commitment to a radical national democratic revolution&quot; and a commitment to a &quot;thorough fundamental transformation of our society.&quot;

&quot;Not just some changing of shares,&quot; he said in an apparent swipe at the ANC's leadership remaining potentially in pro-business hands, such as those of presidential hopeful Tokyo Sexwale. &quot;Real change that is going to lead to fundamental restructuring of every aspect of our lives as workers,&quot; he said.

2.3 Cosatu's bold plan to force views on ANC

Karima Brown and Amy Musgrave, Business Day, 12 September 2007

IN AN unprecedented move, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has decided not only to name who it wants to lead the African National Congress (ANC), but has also linked the outcome of the ANC's succession battle to whether it will continue to support the ruling party in the 2009 elections.

This means that the federation can now publicly endorse ANC deputy president Jacob Zuma in his bid for power.

In an audacious plan, Cosatu proposes a new &quot;development pact&quot; - a set of radical suggestions on economic and foreign policy - as the future basis for a reconfigured tripartite alliance, which will be discussed at the federation's central committee meeting next week.

The pact includes a demand to include Cosatu and the South African Communist Party (SACP) in the deployment of members of the alliance to government.

The pact is Cosatu's attempt to measure the implementation of decisions of the alliance, given its marginalisation from the policy formulation process under President Thabo Mbeki.

Addressing the media yesterday, Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said while the federation realised it could not nominate candidates for the ANC's leadership, it would lobby Cosatu members who were also members of the ANC.

&quot;We have a class interest in the leadership and we will no longer leave things to chance. We will pay dearly if we do,&quot; he said.

The ANC Youth League last week made public its preferred candidates for the top six in the ruling party. They include Zuma, SACP chairman Gwede Mantashe and ANC secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe - all three have close relations with the trade union movement and are likely to be endorsed by the central committee .

Cosatu has linked the outcome of the succession race to its class interests, saying nothing short of an overhaul of economic policy is what they will campaig for when the ANC finalises its economic policy in Polokwane. &quot;We have raised the bar on what you (the media) keep on calling the succession debate. It's a class struggle,&quot; said Cosatu first deputy president Sdumo Dlamini.

Cosatu's radical economic proposals are raising the temperature in the alliance, with former SACP members such as Deputy Finance Minister Jabu Moleketi and Public Enterprises Minister Alec Erwin weighing in with critical assessments on the role of Cosatu in transforming society.

&quot;I don't want to point fingers but former SACP leaders have become the worst critics of the SACP. You can't be a capitalist in your outlook, then seek to lecture us on searching for alternatives,&quot; said Vavi.

Cosatu will engage the alliance on its proposed developmental pact after the central committee meeting. Vavi acknowledged that Cosatu might not be able to persuade the ANC on its plan to overhaul the alliance and change the economic trajectory of the country.

The federation would assess progress after the ANC's elective conference in December. Cosatu's central committee would meet next year to chart the way forward.

&quot;We hope the alliance will appreciate the concrete suggestions that have been made. A lot of people might not like it, but we have to implement the resolutions of our congress,&quot; said Cosatu deputy general secretary Bheki Nsthalintshali.

2.4 Cosatu to name its choice for ANC leadership

Louis Oelofse, Sowetan, 11 September 2007

The SA Congress of Trade Unions (Cosatu) will next week decide on the names of candidates it will support during the African National Congress (ANC) leadership election in December.

Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said while the trade union federation had no right to nominate people for the leadership election, it wanted to guide its members who also belong to the ANC on who the right leadership would be.

&quot;What we want to do is to say we'll back these people if they are nominated by the ANC structures, we would be happy with these people if they are elected,&quot; Vavi said.

He said the names of those candidates Cosatu would support would be decided on during next week's central committee meeting of the federation taking place in Esselen Park, outside Johannesburg.

Vavi also released draft policy documents entitled to be discussed at the committee meeting.

They are the ANC leadership challenge, a framework for alliance governance and an elections pact, and the national democratic revolution and socialism.

In them Cosatu warn that the ANC leadership contest can make or break the tripartite alliance.

&quot;Before emotions take their toll on all of us and before we get trapped into pro-this and anti-that caucus, we must agree on the framework and criteria for electing leadership,&quot; the documents state.

&quot;Without doubt we know that leadership contests can either place an organisation on a higher growth path or lead to paralysis and disintegration. For that reason, as we approach the ANC conference we need to exercise maximum caution not to destroy the movement due to narrow factionalist positions,&quot; the documents read.

Cosatu wanted leaders who &quot;must ensure there is no mass demobilization of the revolutionary forces, so that the masses become spectators, called upon only during national elections and to celebrate national
days.&quot;

Cosatu said it was working towards making the ANC more representative, more progressive and pro-working class. Sapa

2.5 Cosatu leaders slam divided ANC

The Times, 12 September 2007

Two leaders of trade union federation Cosatu have slammed the African National Congress (ANC) over its divisive internal squabbles.

&quot;These problems are to me very serious problems... Why are we failing to lead? The ANC has the kind of squabbles that do not take us forward,&quot; Cosatu president Willie Madisha told a Food and Allied Workers
Union (Fawu) conference in Randburg.

Speaking at the same venue, the union federation's general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said: &quot;The ANC of today is undoubtedly the most divided ANC in the entire history of the organisation. Never ever have we seen the organisation at the point of devouring its own children as we are now witnessing.&quot;

Both leaders made calls for unity within the ruling party. Vavi said the biggest need was for someone who could unite the ANC and the liberation movement.

Madisha said the ANC should &quot;stop disappointing us&quot;. He called for unity in the ruling party and its alliance partners - the SA Communist Party and Cosatu.

Madisha said: &quot;The ANC is not leading here, the Communist Party is not leading, Cosatu is not leading.&quot;

2.6 Leadership squabbles damaging SA working class

SABC, 11 September 2007

Leadership squabbles are allowing the working class movement in South Africa to eat itself alive, Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) president, Willie Madisha, said today.

&quot;The ANC has the kind of squabbles that do not take us forward,&quot; he told a Food and Allied Workers Union (Fawu) conference in Randburg. &quot;The way many are conducting themselves is not proper.&quot;

Madisha said the same applied to the SA Communist Party and Cosatu. &quot;The veterans are still alive. Why do they allow this movement to eat itself alive?&quot;

Earlier, ANC chairperson, Mosiuoa Lekota, said the continued existence of the tripartite alliance was the only way South Africa would ever become a socialist country. He said at the moment the conditions did not exist that could make socialism a reality. - Sapa

2.7 SACP concludes investigation into missing funds

SABC, 11 September 2007

SA Communist Party (SACP) chairperson, Gwede Mantashe, says an internal investigation into the missing R500 000 donation has been concluded.

At the beginning of August, Pretoria businessman, Charles Modise, accused SACP general-secretary, Blade Nzimande, of embezzling his cash donation to the SACP five years ago. Modise is currently facing fraud charges, involving millions of rands, in Kimberley.

Congress of SA Trade Unions president, Willie Madisha, has admitted to receiving and giving the money to Nzimande. Nzimande has denied any knowledge of the donation. Mantashe says the SACP's investigating team will give him its report on Saturday.

Mantashe says: &quot;If that donation was made, the reality of the matter is that we should be calling for the arrest of people who used it. It's our money, we need it - we need it more than anybody... If it was donated to the party and didn't reach the party, I can tell you that I will lead the campaign that they must be arrested.&quot;

3 Worker issues

3.1 Retirement industry needs a 'revolution'

Business Day, 11 September 2007

THE government has come under fire from Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) for the slow pace of retirement industry reform.

Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi said yesterday it seemed likely workers would see the World Cup before they saw the new Retirement Funds Act.

Addressing the Institute of Retirement Funds conference in Cape Town, Vavi said: &quot;We have been engaged in that process for the past six years, and at the slow and fragmented pace we are going it will take us several years more before we get there.&quot;

Vavi said anybody who had witnessed the behaviour of some retirement industry institutions over the past year could not doubt what the industry required.

&quot;We need a revolution in our thinking on how we want to treat workers' savings ... in how we deal with workers' dependants and beneficiaries ... (and) how workers' savings can be invested to improve their lives.

&quot;The changes we need are fundamental, necessary and urgent,&quot; he said.

Vavi said it was Cosatu's view that reforming social security and retirement policy and law should be better co-ordinated within the government - especially if the government was serious about engaging widely and constructively with all stakeholders.

&quot;It does not enable us, as a federation with 1,8-million members, to engage with the law reform process if we get policy papers in bits and pieces - months and even years apart - from different departments.

&quot;Government should move speedily to consolidate its departmental inputs and to produce one comprehensive, holistic policy with which we can engage.

&quot;We were promised this detailed comprehensive document in March , then by September. It is now September 10, and we have not heard anything.&quot;

Vavi said his federation favoured a completely restructured and integrated social security and retirement funds policy and law reform process. &quot;Cosatu also supports proposals for preservation of funds - but this support is for conditional preservation.

&quot;The federation cannot support blanket preservation in an environment with close to 40% unemployment and the continuing destruction of secure, better- paying jobs, which are being replaced by insecure, poorly paying jobs that offer no benefits.

&quot;We support the compulsory provision. We support proposals for a low entry level. Some of our affiliates want this to be for anyone earning R12500 a year. There is no support in Cosatu for proposals of a limit of R60000. There must be no limit.

&quot;Everyone who earns must save. Compulsory provision must apply to all except those who earn below the minimum entry level.

&quot;And we will establish the minimum through a national debate. We fully support the view that people cannot save for tomorrow when they are starving today. Nobody with an empty stomach can plan for a second life in retirement,&quot; he said.

Cosatu also supported the establishment of a low-cost national retirement fund, &quot;but will never support privatisation of its fund administration&quot;. Sapa

3.2 Sasol BEE deal meets mixed reactions

Sherilee Bridge, I-Net Bridge, The Times, 12 September 2007

Petrochemical giant Sasol's (SOL) announcement that it planned to transfer 10% of its issued share capital, worth close on 18 billion rand, into black hands has inspired mixed reactions from trade unions.

While the deal was greeted with a &quot;thumbs up&quot; from Solidarity, the Chemical Energy Paper Printing Wood and Allied Workers Union (CEPPWAWU), &quot;cautiously welcomed&quot; the news.

South Africa's third largest company, Sasol said as part of its black economic empowerment (BEE) deal a 4% stake would go to its employees, which was expected to benefit about 27,000 employees.

The company also said 1.5% of the 10% stake would be put into the Sasol Foundation, a still-to-be-established vehicle that would contribute to growing South Africa's skills, particularly in science and technology.

With employees set to obtain shares worth more than seven billion rand, Sasol's employee share ownership scheme is the largest announced by the private sector to date.

The largest previous plan was Anglo Platinum's 3.3 billion rand employee share ownership scheme, followed by Impala Platinum, whose employee share ownership scheme is valued at 1.7 billion rand.

AngloGold Ashanti's scheme is worth 1.1 billion rand while plans by Kumba Resources' plan is worth 500 million rand.

CEPPWAWU said in a statement that any empowerment deal must incorporate the key broad-based principles that would benefit black employees and new broad-based empowerment entrants.

Planning to discuss the proposed BEE deal in greater detail at its coming National Executive Committee meeting this weekend, CEPPWAWU said it would be looking for a commitment from Sasol that 75% of the benefits provided by the employee share ownership scheme must accrue to black employees.

&quot;Any benefit that fundamentally ignores this principle may jeopardize Sasol claiming broad-based BEE (BBBEE) points,&quot; it said.

An affiliate of Cosatu, CEPPWAWU said it wanted more details about Sasol's plans to acquire skills and its intentions pertaining to the transfer of skills to black employees.

The union said it wanted a reassurance from Sasol that its BBBEE procurement - which totaled 4.2 billion rand in the year to end June 2007 - focused on new and genuine broad-based entrants that include cooperatives and other forms of BBBEE ownership.

&quot;We would discourage ownership by the &quot;usual&quot; empowerment suspects,&quot; the union said.

Solidarity, on the other hand, said Sasol' announcement was a positive example of truly broad-based empowerment.

&quot;Apart form the fact that employees form the group who will derive most benefit from the deal, it is also seen as a positive aspect that poor black communities will be able to obtain shares and that a small wealthy black elite will not be able to grab all the shares,&quot; said Dirk Hermann, deputy general secretary of Solidarity.

The employees' shares will be managed by a trust. The composition and control of the trust will next be negotiated with the employees.

Hermann said that the plan comes at a perfect time, considering the great skills shortage in South Africa and in Sasol.

3.3 'The drug dealers are the enemy'

Murray Williams and Leila Samodien, Pretoria News, 12 September 2007

Cosatu has added its voice to the row that has erupted over the arrest of Cape Town mayor Helen ZIlle, which has seen ANC heavyweights at odds with their provincial officials over the action taken against her.

As a defiant Zille made a brief appearance in court on Tuesday, vowing to continue to lead a street battle against suspected drug dealers at a meeting planned for Atlantis this Sunday, regional Cosatu general secretary Tony Ehrenreich &quot;condemned&quot; her arrest as part of the &quot;political battles&quot; between the city and the provincial government.

&quot;It could be seen as part of the ongoing gimmick of governments to politicise everything whilst our people are suffering,&quot; he said.

&quot;The circus between the provincial government and the City of Cape Town is exacerbated by the arrest of the mayor for not co-operating and should be condemned as it uses state resources to settle political battles,&quot; Ehrenreich said.

&quot;The drug dealers are the enemy and we should all be working together to deal with that scourge.&quot;

This follows ANC secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe's statements in Pretoria on Tuesday in which he described ZIlle's arrest as &quot;unfortunate&quot;.

He said that she should have been treated with respect and dignity to protect the image of South Africa.

&quot;We would have thought, without changing the principle that all shall be equal before the law, that all uphold the law and that the rule of law be applied without fear or favour, that a person holding such high public office should have been treated with a modicum of respect.

&quot;The correct thing would have been for Zille to be treated with the dignity her office called for,&quot; Motlanthe said.

But Community Safety MEC Leonard Ramatlakane lambasted Zille's anti-drug protest and praised the police action. On Tuseday, he said Zille's actions smacked of &quot;cheap politicking&quot;, &quot;hypocrisy&quot; and &quot;grossly abusing her power as mayor and DA leader&quot;, instead of taking practical action in the fight against crime and drugs.

Ramatlakane said that if she, or anyone in the community, wanted to march against drug dealers, they should do so lawfully.

&quot;When the city police marched and blocked the N2, they were armed and in full uniform.

&quot;She asked the police to intervene because they were contravening the law.

&quot;When she does the exact same thing, she wants everyone to close their eyes to it. It shows hypocrisy and double standards on her part,&quot; he said.

Zille was arrested after demanding that the police explain the arrest of Moulana Armien Maker earlier, as he and Zille sought entry at the gates of homes suspected to be used in the drug trade.

And she has vowed to file counter-charges against the police alleging wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution.

&quot;I will be pleading not guilty because I know I did nothing wrong and because I know what motives lie behind my arrest.

But Ramatlakane said: &quot;If she wants to sue the police, she should go ahead and do so and the police would have to defend their actions. But (at the time of the march) the police took what action they needed to.&quot;

Ramatlakane said Zille had been warned by police that her protest was illegal when she marched in the area in July, but she had again taken to the streets, &quot;knowingly and willingly contravening the law&quot;.

&quot;Crime requires everyone to fight against it, political parties should stop politicking for cheap political short-term gains when we should all put our shoulders to the wheel in this matter.&quot;

Zille made a brief appearance before Magistrate Valencia Mphlanganiso in the Mitchels Plain magistrate's court on Tuesday, but she will have to wait until October 26 to hear whether she will face criminal charges.

Zille was officially titled &quot;Accused 11&quot; along with 10 other alleged transgressors Yumna Daniels ,57, Adiela Daniels ,18, Nizaan Daniels ,29, Tuariek Latief, 18, Uzair Ryklief ,18, Rushaad van Reen ,18, Nadeemah Vermeulen ,42, Adiel Fakier ,44, Jeffrey Daniels ,43, and Clarence Peters ,27, represented by Attorney Kader Kajee.

Prosecutor Rochelle Haremse told the court that the case was being postponed &quot;for further investigations and a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions.&quot;

Representing Zille, Frank Raymond told the court he did not even know what charges his client faced, other than for &quot;knocking on somebody's door&quot; - prompting laughter from the gallery.

Raymond said outside the court: &quot;It's amazing that these people were arrested. It's ridiculous.&quot;

He suggested that the case against Zille had strong &quot;political undertones&quot; - but did not wish to elaborate.

Raymond said it was extraordinary for a prosecutor to ask for a decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions - as this was usually a request made by Defence Counsel.

&quot;I don't know what they're doing this for,&quot; he said.

Zille sat in the dock looking relaxed throughout and smiled as she left the court.

3.4 COSATU - condemns 'police brutality'

Rhode Marshall, Bush Radio, 11 September 2007

The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) says they condemn the 'police brutality' against the residence of the Joe Slovo informal settlement.

&quot;People have been raising legitimate concerns against the government housing policy which has in the main not responded to their needs,&quot; says COSATU secretary general, Tony Ehrenreich.

He says the protest was a demonstration of a desperate situation that needs urgent action from the government.

&quot;This lack of delivery is again related to the lack of cooperation between the various levels of government.

The government must now start delivering on the promise of the freedom charter of houses, security and comfort,&quot; says Ehrenreich.

4.1 Affirmative action here to stay - Busa

IOL, 11 September 2007

The policy of affirmative action in South Africa will remain, despite calls from some labour unions to end it, the chief executive of Business Unity SA (Busa) told Parliament on Tuesday.

Since the end of apartheid in 1994, the government has deliberately targeted blacks, women and the disabled for preferential treatment when it came to jobs which they previously had no access to.

Companies in South Africa are required to have a certain number of black people at the management and senior level, which is representative of the country's demographics.

But some labour unions representing mainly white people have said the South African work force is already transformed and have called for a sunset clause on affirmative action.

&quot;We are hearing voices that are saying maybe we should talk about an end date for affirmative action,&quot; said Busa chief executive Jerry Vilakazi during a presentation to Parliament's labour committee.

&quot;This matter was deliberated at council level at Busa and a decision was taken that, that question doesn't arise at this stage at all,&quot; he said.

&quot;We are at a stage where all of us should be focussing on ensuring that affirmative action is implemented across the board, and that is the position we have as Busa,&quot; Vilakazi said.

Busa represents a large number of employers associations and professional bodies, including chambers of commerce.

Vilakazi said the number of black executives in top management jumped to 22,7 percent in 2006, from 12,7 percent in 2000, but it was not &quot;satisfactory&quot; that blacks made up 26,9 percent of senior managers, from 18,5 percent in 2000.

He said Busa would also seek ways of improving the number of women executives in the private sector. The private sector lags state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by 21 percent in its promotion of women into senior positions.

&quot;Although women representatives on boards of JSE-listed companies increased by 1,1 percent to 10,3 percent, SOEs continue to outperform their private sector counterparts... with 31,3 percent of all director positions held by women,&quot; he said. - Reuters

4.2 Fewer women are working, says Solidarity

Slindile Khanyile,  Business Report, 11 September 2007

The number of women in South African workplaces decreased between 2000 and 2006, Dirk Hermann, the deputy general secretary of labour union Solidarity, said yesterday.

Today Solidarity will release a report aimed at showing that South Africa has made progress with affirmative action.

&quot;The only shocking figure was gender related, because it showed that the percentage of women in the workplace declined in the past six years,&quot; said Hermann.

&quot;White women dropped by 24 percent, African women by 2.7 percent, Indian women by 15.3 percent but coloured women increased by 2.6 percent. We are really concerned about the progress of women in South Africa.&quot; For the same period, white men in the workplace dropped by 16.1 percent and Indian men by 14.8 percent. But African men rose by 2.6 percent and coloured men by 18.6 percent.

The 60-page report, The Truth About Affirmative Action in South Africa, aims to show flaws in the scientific basis and comparisons on affirmative action used by the Employment Equity Commission.

Hermann said the commission underestimated the progress of affirmative action and had sent the nation on an unnecessary debate.

&quot;We used different databases, the black diamonds survey, different households from Statistics SA and the database of directors within the JSE companies to determine the progress of affirmative action. There is much more movement than generally accepted,&quot; said Hermann.

Jimmy Manyi, chairman of the commission, recently said the government needed to strengthen its stick to ensure the demographic make-up of South Africans was reflected in the private sector.

Manyi said of the Solidarity report: &quot;We agree that there is movement but it is painfully slow. The only people that have had a meteoric rise are white women.

&quot;We are saying if corporate SA could adopt the same attitude it has used to white women for everyone, we would soon chuck the Employment Equity Act, because by its very nature it is a temporary intervention.&quot;

Hermann said that the commission's scientific method was fragile and posed a threat to the country.

Manyi said: &quot;I am surprised that they are waking up now, because we have been using that method for the past 10 years.

&quot;Where were they all this time? It does not make sense.&quot;

4.3 More black top managers than white, says Solidarity

Slindile Khanyile and Ronnie Morris, 12 September 2007

Black senior managers now outnumbered white senior managers in the country, labour union Solidarity said yesterday when releasing its report: The Truth about Employment Equity in South Africa.

The report sourced its information from the labour department, general household surveys, the SA Advertising Research Foundation, the All Media and Products Survey, the Black Diamonds On the Move survey, public service commission reports, Statistics SA and McGregor BFA.

It found that between 1997 and 2006, the number of senior black managers grew from 8 766 to 28 658, while the number of white top managers declined from 30 876 to 22 758.

According to Dirk Hermann, deputy general secretary at Solidarity, the report aims to show that progress has been made with affirmative action.

The union decided to do its own study after reports that Jimmy Manyi, chairman of the Employment Equity Commission (EEC) said white women should no longer benefit from employment equity and President Thabo Mbeki's complaint in his online newsletter that &quot;we were not singing from the same hymn sheet''.

The JSE lists a 24 percent increase in black directors to 4 311, says the report. In the past 13 months members of the black middle class grew by 30 percent to 2.6 million.

There were more &quot;black diamonds&quot; - black people whose economic status is middle class or better - than working whites, and the buying power of black diamonds amounted to R180 billion, or 28 percent of South Africa's buying power.

Hermann said another document would be released today about white women and affirmative action at the hearings of the portfolio committee.

&quot;We're recording a lot of emotion at this stage and the question is: can the EEC's reports be used as the basis for a national policy?&quot;

The commission ruled earlier that 3 835 reports did not meet the minimum requirements for inclusion in its sample. This may distort any interpretation about representation of the designated group in the workforce.

The EEC's report, released in May, said the department of labour had received 6 502 reports, but only 4 394 were analysed because many still had data in tables that did not tally. It said 2 482 reports were discarded because of poor quality.

Numerous anomalies were identified in graphs and in some years there were spurious achievers or decliners for which no explanation could be found. Coincidentally, the representation of white women last year was one such anomaly.

&quot;There is something wrong with the 2006 report,&quot; said Hermann. &quot;That's why we had this spike, because the data is wrong and now the EEC is on that spike, which is most probably based on wrong statistics.''

In 2005, says the employment equity report, 25 municipalities, nine provincial departments, nine national departments and firms such as Transnet, SABC and the directorate of public prosecutions did not submit employment equity figures.

&quot;Non-submissions by these institutions can have a major effect on figures in the reports. Municipalities have achieved between 70 percent and 80 percent black representation,&quot; says the employment equity report.

John Dludlu of Transnet said: &quot;Transnet submitted all the statutory reports, including the one in question, to the department of labour. This was clarified in our presentation to parliament last October. Our opinions were never canvassed for this research. We're concerned that inaccurate information is employed to advance the union's position.&quot;

Manyi said: &quot;My final response is that [the Solidarity report] is not worth a response.&quot;

4.4 Analysts put doubt on the reliability of Busa figures

Donwald Pressly, Business Report, 12 September 2007

Analysts have questioned figures presented to parliament by Business Unity SA (Busa) indicating that black people employed in the local economy dropped from 78 percent in 2005 to 73 percent last year.

T-Sec chief economist Mike Schussler said the statistics produced by Busa chief operations officer Vic van Vuuren and chief executive Jerry Vilikazi at the labour portfolio committee yesterday were &quot;not reliable&quot; and the focus should be on using people with skills.

Busa, headed by businessman Patrice Motsepe, reported to MPs that between 2000 and 2006 the representation of blacks in middle management dropped from 44.1 percent to 36.5 percent.

But Schussler questioned these figures. He said his reading of the Statistics SA labour force survey was that blacks made up nearly 70 percent of those working for someone else - not for themselves, in other words. &quot;Black males were the biggest beneficiaries of affirmative action by far,&quot; Schussler said. &quot;Black males represented 35.2 percent of those in 2002 and this rose to 40 percent in September last year.&quot;

Meanwhile, Van Vuuren, during hearings on workplace discrimination before the labour portfolio committee, reported there were inadequate monitoring systems in place for transformation at all levels, from government sectors to companies.

&quot;This is a serious flaw, as it allows for too many players to fly undetected below the radar screen,&quot; van Vuuren told MPs.

Sapa reports that Vilakazi noted that the organisation did not believe there were enough skills among the country's black population.

&quot;Our view as Busa is that the country has a shortage of skills and that this was more pronounced among the blacks,&quot; Sapa quoted Vilakazi as saying.

This appeared to contradict previous evidence from Employment Equity Commission chairman Jimmy Manyi that disputes the notion that some firms appointed more white people in top management positions because of a shortage of black candidates with the required skills.

Econometrix economist Tony Twine said statistics on workplace transformation should be taken with a degree of circumspection.

&quot;Every piece of research will produce its own figures,&quot; said Twine. &quot;The same piece of research doubtless produces different figures if conducted at different times.&quot;

Schussler noted that there were nearly 1.1 million jobs vacant in provincial and national government offices, including 204 400 high-skilled jobs, 578 800 skilled jobs and 231 900 semi-skilled jobs.

On top of that, he said, there were 57 010 more jobs vacant at municipal level.

&quot;There is a huge skills shortage but we are arguing about the colour of people,&quot; said Schussler. &quot;It is time we moved beyond the race debate on to [the need for] skills.&quot;

4.5 Both sides of labour equity debate dig for gold, but find dross

Quentin Wray, Business Report, 12 September 2007

Solidarity, the predominantly white trade union, released a report yesterday that purported to tell the &quot;truth about employment equity in South Africa&quot;.

This report raises some interesting methodological points and claims that, contrary to the view of employment equity commission chairman Jimmy Manyi, workplace transformation is well advanced.

In fact, Solidarity says, &quot;affirmative action measures [are needed] to render whites, coloureds and Indians representative&quot; in more than half the provincial government departments.

Further muddying the waters, Business Unity SA, which represents the formal business sector, told parliament yesterday that the number of black middle managers had fallen. This would imply that efforts to date have been inadequate and that Manyi is, in fact, right about affirmative action being in a parlous state.

Clearly, both sides of the debate are indulging in what economists call gold digging - sifting through data until some are found to back up one's own hypothesis.

Your view of who is right will depend on a number of factors, including race, place of employment and peer experiences. But the reality is that all the reports on the subject to date have had major methodological flaws and cannot be relied on by policy makers.

What is needed is credible and independently collected survey data that can stand up to scrutiny by all sides of the ideological divide.

The increasingly toothless department of labour has proven it is incapable of collecting data, analysing reports or properly enforcing laws.

Accurate workplace demographics would allow the executive to identify where transformation was lacking and allow it to tweak, rewrite or chuck out existing policies to remedy the situation.

However, it will take a long time to get such a survey off the ground.

In the meantime, employers should comply with the laws as they stand and fill in the requisite department of labour reports.

Unless they do this timeously and accurately, they cannot complain when the results of the incomplete surveys are used against them by people such as Jimmy Manyi, who have a political axe to grind.

4.6 Brush the cobwebs off original equity intentions

Neva Makgetla, Business Day, 12 September 2007

THE current debates about employment equity form part of the fundamental contest over the core challenges facing the country.

Above all, should the government prioritise efforts to deal with inequalities based on race, on gender or on class?

In the event, movement toward representivity among the rich and powerful has been painfully slow. But it has been faster than progress toward greater overall equality. Employment equity originally had two core aims: to end discrimination in the workplace based on race, gender or disability; and to expand promotion opportunities for those who had historically suffered discrimination.

That would require basic changes in the systems of education, training, hiring and promotion entrenched under apartheid. Historically, the vast majority of black workers were labelled as unskilled and, no matter how well they worked or how long, they could never hope to move up.

Originally, employment equity sought to encourage companies to address these systemic obstacles to representivity, rather than just play a numbers game around high-level positions. But over the years this shifted. And thus the black economic empowerment codes give greater weight to representivity at the top than to expanding opportunities for the majority of workers. In part, the shift in the debate reflects growing frustration over the failure to promote even qualified black people. In part, it arises out of growing inequalities within the black population, which underpins different views over the relative importance of race and class.

Certainly, representivity in management remains a distant goal. In September 2005, according to the Labour Force Survey, almost three quarters of managers in large private organisations - with more than 50 employees - were white. A fifth of these white managers were women. They lagged behind white men, but were better represented than black women and black men.

White men were over-represented fourfold in management across the economy, and white women twofold. In contrast, there were about a third as many African men in management in larger private organisations as representivity would require, and about a fifth as many African women.

The unemployment data also suggest employment equity still has a long way to go, since they demonstrate that white people, women and men still have easier access to jobs. The unemployment rate for whites was 5% in September 2005. For African men, in contrast, it was 26%; for African women, 37%. Even for Africans with university degrees it was more than 5%.

Income surveys suggest greater progress toward racial equity.

But most also suggest that overall income inequality remains virtually unchanged since the mid-1990s.

The question remains why employment equity has progressed so slowly. Two obvious explanations emerge. First, the Employment Equity Act notoriously has very little teeth. As long as a company files a report, there are virtually no sanctions to ensure they move toward representivity. The act essentially assumed that workers and society would ensure action.

Second, the industries that used to provide stable, well-paid, skilled work on a large scale have fallen behind on employment. The public service has shrunk since 1994. Even in the past five years, with the relatively strong economic upswing, employment in financial services has expanded about 2,8% a year, while manufacturing has grown at 2% a year. But where employment is growing only slowly, promoting anyone, including historically excluded groups, becomes difficult.

The bigger question, of course, is how much society should emphasise greater representivity at the top compared with securing broader equality across the board. Measures to promote shared growth will generally encourage greater representivity in higher-level positions, but the reverse is not necessarily the case. After all, shared growth requires fundamental shifts in the economy to open more opportunities for employment and smaller enterprise. That needs far more extensive and broad-based interventions than employment equity.

5.1 'Gross distortion of the truth' - TAC

IOL, 11 September 2007

Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang's statement concerning dual therapy HIV treatment was a &quot;gross distortion of the truth&quot;, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC) said on Tuesday.

The TAC also welcomed the health department's announcement at Monday's meeting of the SA National Aids Council that dual therapy as a minimum treatment for preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission was due for &quot;imminent approval&quot;.

According to Tshabalala-Msimang a 2001 Constitutional Court judgment limited her department to implementing only monotherapy nevirapine to HIV-positive pregnant mothers.

Beeld reported the minister as saying at Monday's meeting that were it not for the TAC's 2001 court case, pregnant mothers would already have had access to dual therapy treatment. She also claimed that nevirapine monotherapy did not work.

&quot;This is a gross distortion of the truth,&quot; said the TAC in a statement.

&quot;The decision to use single-dose nevirapine as opposed to AZT or other, more effective regimens, was taken by the Department of Health when it initiated 18 PMTCT (preventing mother-to-child transmission) pilot sites before the case.

&quot;But it refused to extend the programme beyond these pilot sites. Single-dose nevirapine was the cheapest regimen available and this probably informed the state's decision.&quot;

At one stage during Monday's meeting the TAC's Mark Heywood sat shaking his head while Tshabalala-Msimang spoke about the ineffectiveness of nevirapine in preventing mother-to-child transmission, reported Beeld.

According to the TAC's statement a number of public health facilities were ready to roll out PMTCT but were prevented from doing so by the health department, giving rise to the TAC's court case.

Currently only the Western Cape was implementing dual therapy treatment. This had reduced the mother-to-child HIV infection rate to around eight percent, said the TAC.

In a speech in the National Assembly in 1999, Tshabalala-Msimang quoted from a study during which 308 women took AZT and 310 nevirapine. The latter was found to be &quot;markedly more effective&quot;, safer, less expensive and more practical than AZT or any other drug tested so far, in preventing mother-to-child transmission, she said.

Nevirapine was also considerably cheaper that ATZ, at R30 per mother and child as opposed to R400. - Sapa

5.2 Selection process tipped to pick Qunta

Linda Ensor, Political Correspondent, Business Day, 12 September 2007

Opposition parties have expressed concern that President Thabo Mbeki will likely use his power to appoint lawyer Christine Qunta as chairman of the SABC's next board after she made it onto the final shortlist of 12 names recommended by the National Assembly's communications committee.

The National Assembly will debate and approve the list tomorrow after which it will be sent for presidential endorsement.

Qunta, who was deputy chairman in the outgoing board, has been widely tipped to take over from Eddie Funde, who withdrew his nomination shortly before he was due to be interviewed at the end of last month.

Her short-listing was apparently vehemently opposed by the South African Communist Party and the Congress of South African Trade Unions.

Parliament's communications portfolio committee yesterday approved the shortlist of 12 names from a list of 37 (drawn from 143 nominations) after an extensive period of interviews with each candidate.

Six current members of the SABC board, including Qunta, have been selected again, despite accusations that the board has been ineffective in maintaining the political independence and integrity of the public broadcaster. The others are Alison Gilwald, Andile Mbeki, Fadila Lagadien, Khanyisile Mkhonza and Ashwin Trikamjee.

The other six recommended by the communications committee are Nadia Bulbulia, Desmond Golding, advertising executive Peter Vundla, Bheki Khumalo, Gloria Serobe, and Pansy Tlakula of the Independent Electoral Commission.

Democratic Alliance (DA) communications spokeswoman Dene Smuts and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) communications spokeswoman Suzanne Vos said the hand of Mbeki supporters on the committee was clear in the choice of some candidates.

&quot;This is a politically-partisan, pro-Mbeki board,&quot; Vos said.

Smuts opposed the selection of &quot;Mbeki-supporting&quot; Qunta on the grounds of her controversial views on freedom of expression and her interests in the Comforters Healing Gift company which promoted medicinal cures for HIV/AIDS.

Vos said that as head of the board's human resources committee Qunta had overseen 80 resignations during her tenure.

The ANC controversially did not propose ANC national executive committee member and former speaker of the national assembly Frene Ginwala.

The ANC and DA agreed on eight of the names, with the IFP approving seven of these and abstaining on the eighth, namely former presidential spokesman Bheki Khumalo.

5.3 ANC snubs Ginwala, backs Qunta for SABC board

Siyabonga Mkhwanazi, Pretoria News, 12 September 2007

Former National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala's ANC comrades have spurned her for appointment to the new SABC board, citing concerns about her leadership post in the ruling party.

Instead, the committee opted to stick with another strong and outspoken candidate, Christine Qunta, widely tipped to become the new SABC board chairperson.

Ginwala, a former journalist and ANC national executive committee member, was not among those favoured by the ANC-dominated National Assembly communications committee for appointment to the public broadcaster's 12-member board when it met on Tuesday.

ANC MP and outgoing acting committee chairperson Godfrey Oliphant said there was nothing untoward about Ginwala's exclusion. The ruling party had merely considered concerns raised during the public interview process about Ginwala serving on the NEC, the ANC's top leadership structure.

The new SABC board takes office in January, after the ANC's December leadership election in Polokwane. It is not clear why Ginwala was passed over, given that there is no guarantee she will be re-elected to the NEC.

Said Oliphant: &quot;There is no specific reason she was left out. We do not want the issue of political office to be a problem.&quot;

Ginwala, who was at a conference in Addis Ababa, said she did not have a problem with her exclusion. She declined further comment.

During her interview last week, Ginwala told MPs that she saw no conflict between serving on the board and being an ANC NEC member.

During interviews Ginwala said she was a strong advocate of freedom of expression.

Ginwala originally also had the backing of the Democratic Alliance, but yesterday DA MP Dene Smuts made a U-turn saying her party was withdrawing it support, because the former speaker was an ANC NEC member.

The DA did not want to risk supporting someone who might be re-elected in December and would therefore still be holding political office when the new board takes over in January.

Smuts and IFP MP Suzanne Vos also raised strong objections about the inclusion of businesswoman Gloria Serobe and the re-appointment of Qunta. The two MPs said there was a clear conflict of interest with Serobe being on the SABC board because she was a shareholder in Elephant consortium which has a 3 percent stake in Telkom.

Telkom's subsidiary company Telkom Media is competing with the SABC for a satellite licence.

Serobe had told the committee that she saw no conflict of interest because she held a minority stake at Telkom and does not serve in a strategic position at Telkom.

Opposition MPs said they were against the re-appointment of Qunta because she was part of the SABC board during several controversies at the broadcaster.

&quot;The ANC is importing back to the board certain persons, in particular Miss Qunta and Mr (Andile) Mbeki, who appear to be part of the problem and not the solution,&quot; said Vos. The National Assembly will endorse the list on Thursday before the names are forwarded to President Thabo Mbeki for appointment.

5.4 Tariffs intended to boost jobs are actually tying them down

Nick Steen, Business Report, 11 September 2007

The government and labour unions have rightly been concerned about the significant loss of jobs in the textile industry, caused by the opening of world markets after the demise of apartheid.

The apartheid era's response to competition was to a large extent driven by one of the major textile manufacturers and based on the imposition of import tariffs.

The current government has continued to use tariff structures to protect local industry. Thus, for example, imported cloth carries a 22 percent tariff and fully manufactured articles a 30 percent tariff.

However, prices in the East are significantly below those quoted by South African manufacturers. This means that even with tariffs barriers in place, there has been more procurement of finished product from Asia, with the accompanying loss of jobs in the local industry.

The government's most recent response was to attempt to stem the tide in the manner of King Canute - who, according to legend, tried to command the waves to stop coming onto the shore. In similar style, the South African state imposed a two-year quota on imports of ready-made products (in particular clothing) and a wide range of cotton or cotton-rich fabrics from China.

This move, while well intentioned, showed a lack of understanding of the true dynamics of the industry. It has subsequently had to be modified and at least partially neutralised.

For example, heavily restrictive quotas were applied to 100 percent cotton fabrics for bed linen, which is not even manufactured in this country. There was no quota or restriction (other than the tariffs) on imports of fully made up products from China in the same fabric.

So Sheraton Textiles, one of South Africa's largest household textiles manufacturers, was forced to either switch its procurement of percale cloth from China to Pakistan, where it was more expensive, or have products manufactured in China.

Due to the stringent quality control standards of local retailers and the resultant need to ensure continuous colour matching, the only available solution was to have the products made in China.

As a result, Chinese labour substituted South African labour - supported by the very legislation that was supposed to protect local jobs.

The whole approach is flawed. Instead of a quota driven approach, attention must be given to the tariff structure. Currently that structure supports the very few manufacturers that actually make cloth in this country. In most of these cases, their equipment is not competitive with the modern weaving mills in China, Pakistan and India.

More pertinently, the majority of employment in the textile industry occurs downstream, in the cut make and trim operations that make the garments and bedding. Attention should be given to promoting these job creators.

Protecting weaving plants, with their low labour intensity and non-competitive machinery, serves the narrow interests of a few and does nothing to increase employment of the majority in the industry.

It could be argued that unless the local weaving operations commit themselves to substantial capital expenditure to ensure that their plants are competitive worldwide, they should forgo this protection.

These operations, in general, made excessive profits during the apartheid years, and very little if any was channelled back into upgrades. Yet they now look to the government for protection.

To increase employment, the focus should rather be on the labour intensive cut, make and trim operations.

These manufacturers tend to import fabric - either because it is not manufactured in this country or because local manufacturers fail to meet quality standards or delivery times or are simply too expensive. They pay a 22 percent duty on the cloth they use to manufacture clothing or bedding.

This product then has to compete with ready-made products made by foreign labour on which the duty is, at best, 8 percent more.

Perhaps of greater concern is the fact that the tariffs on fabric means that an illicit importer can import fully made up goods at prices below the legal importer's &quot;fabric only&quot; cost. (A comparison of export and import figures indicates that as much as R1 of every R3 worth of textiles exported from China enters South Africa illegally.)

The solution to the labour crisis lies in reducing or eliminating the tariffs paid by &quot;qualified manufacturers&quot; (local manufacturers that commit to using local labour). This would make it more attractive for retailers to buy locally made products. It would also slash the incentive for importing product illegally.

Reducing the argument to a mathematical equation may seem overtly simplistic. For the textile industry, a reduction in raw material and fabric tariffs equals increased employment.

5.5 Patients pay price in ailing health system

Isaac Mangena, Mail &amp; Guardian, 12 September 2007

Samson Mashaba struggles to retain his sense of humour as he waits to see his doctor. &quot;If you're unlucky, you'll die standing here,&quot; says the 69-year-old as he surveys the queue ahead of him at a rural hospital in Mpumalanga.

While South Africa may boast some of the finest hospitals on the continent in cities like Johannesburg and Cape Town, rural healthcare is dogged by a lack of cash, personnel and facilities to cover the vast areas.

In Mpumalanga, a north-eastern province which covers an area of around 80 000 square kilometres and is home to about 3,5-million people, there are a mere 550 doctors -- a ratio of around 6 000 patients per doctor.

Given only 44 of them are specialists, medics often have no choice but to refer patients hundreds of kilometres away to hospitals in Gauteng.

The referrals have grown so frequent Mpumalanga now owes Gauteng R44-million for treating its patients.

According to Selby Maphophe, chief executive of the Rural Doctors Association of South Africa executive, many of his organisation's members have either headed to the city or gone into private practice after becoming disillusioned about pay and conditions.

&quot;We are facing serious challenges like accommodation, late payment of salaries, and support both in terms of equipment and emotional [support].

&quot;It's frustrating to deal with patients' problems without proper support. We end up playing trial and error with people's lives,&quot; added Mphophe, who works in a rural hospital in neighbouring Limpopo province.

Maphophe said he had been forced to turn away patients on a number of occasions because of a lack of equipment.

&quot;One time I had to send back a sugar diabetic patient because we had no facilities to test the blood sugar level on her. It was pretty bad but there was nothing we could do but refer her to the much-equipped hospital&quot;.

Mashaba knows all too well how patients can end up being shuffled from pillar to post as he waited to see his podiatrist at Tintswalo hospital.

&quot;I've been turned away three times because there was no doctor to examine me, until I was advised to go to Mankweng&quot;, a hospital around 250km away in Polokwane, he said.

&quot;Coming here you will either be turned back because there is no equipment to check you or there is no specialist.&quot;

A fellow elderly patient chimed in that travelling long distances to other health centres was a real hardship.

&quot;Some of us are pensioners struggling and have no money to travel long distances to get medical help,&quot; he said on condition of anonymity.

The government is particularly sensitive about criticism of the health service and South African President Thabo Mbeki reacted furiously to a recent exposé of conditions at a hospital in East London.

A doctor who did go public about the situation there has been suspended and none of the medics approached at Tintswalo would speak on the record.

A nursing sister however said the squeeze meant colleagues were having to carry out duties beyond their remit.

&quot;We really are operating on a thin staff proportion and this puts pressure on us as it forces us to leave our duties to do what doctors should be doing. It is very bad,&quot; she said on condition her name not be used.

&quot;The situation is without doubt putting strain on the limited doctors in the public service,&quot; acknowledged Mpho Gabashane, spokesperson for the province's health department.

&quot;It is not an ideal situation, but one we are working hard to overcome.&quot;

The government has even begun recruiting doctors from Cuba, Tunisia and Iran to cover the shortfall and has introduced incentives such as a rural allowance.

&quot;We also have a pool of doctors available every year to do community service in rural areas as a policy and we are planning to include nurses as from next year,&quot; said health ministry spokesperson Sibani Mngadi. - Sapa-AFP

6.1 Harare threatens to crush worker protests

Sebastian Nyamhangambiri, ZimOnline, 11 September 2007
Zimbabwe's government on Monday angrily reacted to calls by labour leaders for fresh protests by workers, threatening to deal with union officials it accused of seeking to plunge the country into chaos.
Home Affairs Minister Kembo Mohadi said he and other security officials would most likely discuss today a Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU)-led work stoppage planned for September 19 and 20.
The government, which has in the past arrested ZCTU leaders and sent armed police and soldiers onto the streets to crush worker protests, said it was not going to &quot;sit and watch&quot; the union cripple Zimbabwe with job strikes, according to Mohadi.
&quot;We are likely to discuss the issue tomorrow with the security ministry,&quot; said Mohadi, who is in charge of the police.
&quot;The government will deal with the ZCTU leaders if they want to cause chaos to this country. We cannot sit and watch them while they do what they want,&quot; he said.
Zimbabwe's labour movement at the weekend said it was calling the job stayaway to pressure the government to lift a ban on salary increases announced by President Robert Mugabe last week that union officials have described as &quot;satanic' and meant to reduce workers to paupers.
Mugabe used powers granted him under the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act to order a freeze price and salary increases, which he said was necessary to halt galloping inflation.
Inflation, labelled Zimbabwe's number one enemy by Mugabe, is more than 7 600 percent and the highest in the world.
The ZCTU, which before the salary and price freeze had called on the government and business to link salaries to inflation, says the freeze is illegal because it violates the rights of worker's to negotiate and bargain for better remuneration.
ZCTU president Lovemore Matombo was not immediately available to respond to threats by the government to thwart protests by workers.
Inflation is the most visible sign of Zimbabwe's deep recession that has left more than 80 percent of workers without jobs while those lucky to still hold a formal job are unable to feed their families because of ever-rising prices.
The Harare administration last June ordered business to reduce prices of all goods by 50 percent, in a desperate attempt to halt inflation that has however had damaging consequences with most basic goods no longer available in shops because factories cannot produce at a loss.

6.2 Zimbabwe: CIO Intimidate Striking Teachers

Lance Guma, SW Radio Africa, 11 September 2007

Over 80 percent of teachers under the 12 000 strong Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) have heeded a call to down tools this week to press demands for a 500 percent salary hike.

According to the union's Harare Province Chairperson Jacob Rukweza, teachers in Hatcliffe, Chitungwiza, Dzivarasekwa, Mabvuku, Epworth and all the other western suburbs like Warren Park, are clocking in at work but refusing to teach. But the PTUZ say state security agents under the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) are moving around schools using government vehicles and trying to intimidate them.

The visits are being disguised as assessment trips meant to gauge the impact of the strike. Rukweza however says by interviewing leaders from both the PTUZ and the bigger ZIMTA union, the agents are in fact trying to intimidate their officials. Asked how the strike was proceeding countrywide, Rukweza says the response has been huge. In Bulawayo the PTUZ coordinator Enock Paradzai says teachers in the city actually stopped teaching last week when the others were still on a go-slow. In the Midlands, coordinator Wilbert Muringani also reports a significant response. By late Tuesday he was said to be headed to Gokwe, where they have a large membership, to assess the response to the strike.

Other cities where the strike is ongoing include Mutare and Masvingo. The PTUZ called on its representatives to ignore the CIO's who are moving around interviewing them adding they were just as poor and struggling to make ends meet as the teachers. This week the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) added pressure on government by calling for a general strike on the 19th and 20th September. They are protesting a wage freeze imposed by Mugabe at the end of August. The teacher's strike will run until the 17th of the month 2 days before the ZCTU strike, officials said.
