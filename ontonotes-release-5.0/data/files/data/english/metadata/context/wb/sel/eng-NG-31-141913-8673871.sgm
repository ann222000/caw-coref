Democrats Fall Short in Vote on Home Leave for Troops

By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

WASHINGTON, Sept. 19 b Senate Democrats fell short late this afternoon
in what was seen as their best chance to shift the course of the war in
Iraq, in a vote on a measure to require that troops get as much time at
home as they spend overseas before being redeployed.

The vote on the measure, offered by Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of
Virginia, was 56 to 44 in favor b four less than the supporters needed
to prevent a filibuster. The outcome was almost the same as that in a
vote on the measure in July, when 56 senators voted in favor and 41
against.

Senator Webb and Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, made an
aggressive last-ditch push today for the proposal, but to no avail.

bWar is hell, but politicians shouldnbt make it any worse,b Senator
Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said in urging support for the
Webb measure.

But Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, argued that it would
hobble the president. bWe have one commander in chief, and one only,b
Mr. McCain said. The senator said the message he is getting from the
troops in Iraq is simple: bLet us win.b

All the Democrats plus the independent Bernard Sanders of Vermont voted
for the Webb proposal and were joined by six Republican senators: Chuck
Hagel of Nebraska, John E. Sununu of New Hampshire, Norm Coleman of
Minnesota, Gordon Smith of Oregon and Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe,
both of Maine. And Senator Tim Johnson, the South Dakota Democrat who
was ill and absent in July, voted for the Webb measure today.

But Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, who voted for the
measure in July, voted against it today, as did Senators David Vitter
of Louisiana and Sam Brownback of Kansas, both Republicans, who did not
vote in July. Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut,
also voted against the measure.

Mr. Webb said before the vote that he believed he had ba very good
shotb of winning over enough Republicans, even if he lost the support
of Senator Warner, one of the Republican Partybs most respected voices
on military affairs. Without Mr. Warnerbs vote, the Democrats had to
win over at least four Republicans who voted against the measure in
July.

Shortly after 1 p.m. Eastern time today, in a speech on the Senate
floor, Mr. Warner heaped praise on Mr. Webb, but then delivered a sharp
blow. bI endorsed itb in July, when it last came up for a vote, Mr.
Warner said of the Webb proposal, but bnow I intend to cast a vote
against it.b

In explaining his decision, Mr. Warner said he had been persuaded, at a
meeting earlier in the day with senior military officials, that the
Webb plan could not be carried out without causing havoc for the armed
forces, potentially lengthening soldiersb tours in Iraq.

bIt is a change of vote for me, I recognize that,b he said. bI changed
that vote only after lot of very careful and analytical work with the
uniformed side of the Department of Defense.b

The meeting with Mr. Warner and senior Pentagon officials was also
attended by other Republican senators whose support Mr. Webb had been
seeking, including Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Lisa Murkowski of
Alaska.

After the Webb proposal fell short, the Senate voted on a plan offered
by Mr. McCain that would have made the bequal timeb specified in Mr.
Webbbs measure a goal, rather than mandatory. The McCain measure fell
five short of the 60 needed.

Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates had strongly opposed the Webb plan,
saying it would interfere with complex troop deployment schedules.

At a news conference this morning meant to bolster Republican support
for the measure, and later in speeches on the Senate floor, Mr. Webb
and Mr. Hagel, both of whom are Vietnam veterans, warned that the
lengthy deployments of American troops in Iraq and insufficient time at
home between deployments were wearing down the military so badly that
it would take decades to rebuild.

bWe are destroying our force structure,b Mr. Hagel said.

Mr. Webb, who served as an assistant secretary of defense and secretary
of the Navy under President Reagan, said he believed that there was
substantial disagreement between the White House and senior military
leaders at the Pentagon over deployment issues, and that it was time
for Congress to act to protect the troops.

bThis is a point where we need to step in and referee the situation,b
he said.

Mr. Webb said he responded to concerns raised by Mr. Gates by delaying
the effective date of his measure by four months to allow Pentagon
planners time to adjust to its requirements, and by exempting special
forces units because of the unpredictable nature of their work.

Mr. Webb dismissed assertions in recent days by Mr. Gates and other
Bush administration officials that his legislation would actually
result in longer troop deployments and require that more National Guard
and reserve units be called up.

bMy view is, this is a political issue not a military issue,b Mr. Webb
said. bAnd there is an attempt by this administration to paint a dark
picture with respect to troop welfare in order to try to diminish what
we are attempting to do on behalf of the troops.b
