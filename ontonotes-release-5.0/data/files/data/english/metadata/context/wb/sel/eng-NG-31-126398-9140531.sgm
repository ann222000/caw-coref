Running ClarisDraw

I used to use the subject drawing application, Version 1.0v1, a lot at
work on an old G3 running OS 8.6.  I really liked, and still like,
ClarisDraw.  I have a lot of drawings I did using it (stored on Zip
disks).  That old G3 is likely to be retired soon.  I would like to
buy a Mac for home use that will run ClarisDraw.  The first thing I
did was look in eBay for similar old G3's -- there were only a handful
of them that don't even seem to run.  I don't know much about Macs
(please don't boo-hiss me but I'm primarily a PC user but I do use a
G4 at work) so I would like to know what's a good, reasonably priced
(i.e., cheap) Mac that I should/could get that will run ClarisDraw.
BTW, I picked up a copy of ClarisDraw, Version 1.0v2 (ca. 1994
vintage) on 3-1/2-inch floppy disks, on eBay a few years ago waiting
for an opportunity to use someday.  So whatever Mac I buy needs to
accept floppy and Zip disks.  Many thanks for your help.

I use ClarisDraw all the time.  It will run quite nicely on a Quadra so
don't get hung up on a G3.

There are two current programs (at least) that will read in ClarisDraw
documents and that run natively under OS X, Intaglio and EazyDraw.  Both
can be located via www.versiontracker.com .

Of the two Intaglio seems the better program.  I don't have either but I
am on the verge of purchasing Intaglio.

Any PowerMac G4 up to and included the MDD 1,25ghz with Firewire 400 is
able to boot and work in Os 9.2.x. Any of these models are able to run
ClarisDraw under Os 9.x. Any of these models are also capable of running
OS X 10.4.10 wich OS 9.2.2 as either 'Classic' (Os 9.2.2 installed to OS
X) or 'Classic Mode' (OS 9.2.2 installed on a seperate disk or partition.

I have and still use ClarisDraw myself on both a Beige G3 AV (upgraded
to 1133mhz) and a Quicksilver Dual 1ghz G4 with both OS X and Os 9.2.x
as bootable systems, - and also running OS 9.2.2 as 'classic Mode' mode
under OS X 10.4.10, - and ClarisDraw is still usable, and it is also
possible to print from ClarisDraw within classic mode.

Hm, some of the older G4 models - Sawtooth, gigabitEthernet and
DigitalAudio were delievered with a built-in 100mb zip drive.

If you can't find such one, you can buy both USB floppydrives and 250mb
USB zip drives that can be used on both Os 9.x and OS X. I too have lots
of zips and floppies, so I bought external floppy and zip drives - a
250mb Iomega zip drive and a LaCie floppy drive also for USB. Both
drives need drivers if used from a booted OS 9.x but are fully
recognized in OS X without extra drivers.

HTH, cheers, Erik Richard

Note however that a USB floppy drive (or any derivative such as the
Superdisk) will not be able to access 400KB or 800KB double density
floppy disks (800K was the standard Mac format for double density). It
will work fine with high density (1.44MB) or with 720KB double density.

I doubt that ClarisDraw is old enough to have been supplied on an 800K
floppy. High density drives became standard in 1988, and were included
on all but one model that supports a colour display (and was an upgrade
option for that model, the original Mac II).

If you have any double density floppy disks you were already using (with
only one rectangular hole in the corner, for the write protect switch)
then they will probably be 800K format.

One of the reasons my G4 is still running OS 9.2.2, even though the new
laptop uses 10.4.10 is that I didn't want to give up my old software, CW
4.0 included.  It also reads(and writes to) Zip and CD as well as, with
an external floppy drive, floppies dating back several computers.  Even
Appleworks 6 can open older versions of ClarisWorks.  But to accept
those floppies you may need an external drive.  I don't think anything
since my original Mac LCII has accepted floppies directly.

The LaCie floppy dirve that I have do indeed support 800k floppies. - It
is explictly written that it support these formats:
800k SSDD = Singlesided Double Density
800k DSDD = Doublesided Double Density
800k DSHD = Doublesided High Density
1,4mb DSDD = soublesided Double Density

I suggest any old G3 iMac running 8.6 which is IME the most compatible
classic MacOS. You won't need much RAM for ClarisDraw, but if you run
multiple apps at once you'll find anything less than 64MB RAM will fill
up real fast.

Have a look at &lt; http://www.lowendmac.com &gt; for great info on running
older Macs.

The key point is the physical format used on the disk, not the file
system.

On the Mac, there are two possible physical formats for a double density
3.5&quot; disk.

An 800K disk (using GCR formatting, Apple specific) requires a special
drive and controller which can handle the sector encoding and has either
a variable rotation speed or hardware and software compensation for the
variable bit widths that will be produced if a fixed speed drive is
used.

A 720K disk (using MFM formatting, industry standard) should work in any
USB floppy drive (unless it is restricted to only supporting high
density floppies).

An HFS (Mac) double density 3.5&quot; floppy can be in either of these
physical formats. (A 720K HFS disk will only work on a Mac with a high
density &quot;SuperDrive&quot; floppy drive, not on older models like the Mac
Plus, which have the 800K drive.)

A FAT (MS-DOS) double density 3.5&quot; floppy will only be in MFM format.

(There are also single sided variants of both of the above, but they are
rare in the MS-DOS realm and very old for the Mac - 400K, using MFS
instead of HFS, and MFS is not supported by Mac OS from about Mac OS 8.0
onwards.)

So, the question is whether your VST drive is really able to read
HFS/800K/GCR double density floppies, or are you actually using
HFS/720K/MFM?

For completeness: a high density 3.5&quot; disk for the Mac will always be in
MFM format (1440K). It might be using HFS or FAT as its file system.

(Footnote: there is also a 1600K GCR 3.5&quot; format, used on the Apple II
with a high density 3.5&quot; drive that was made by Applied Engineering. It
works with the built-in drive controller on the Apple IIgs. This format
was never used by Apple or supported on their drives.)

Many thanks for the replies I got.  I'm reporting back to say that I
bought a used iMac G3/400 with 128mb memory running OS 9.2.2 on eBay.
I also got a new external floppy disk drive, new 512mb memory (two
256mb cards), and a good used Mac Pro optical mouse (the original
round iMac mouse was very frustrating) .  I took the iMac out of the
box, plugged it in, plugged in the floppy drive, installed ClarisDraw,
and was fully up and running in less than ten minutes!  Very nice.  I
was able to transfer my ClarisDraw files on Zip disks to CD so I'm
good to go at it again.  Thanks again.

Cool to hear that it worked out for you! :-) I rather liked the original
puck mouse, and would still use them if only they were optical. I found
them very comfy to use with only my fingertips moving the mouse. Anyway,
each to their own. IMHO the MS Intellimouse is the best low-cost optical
mouse around. Funny how MS make some shite software, but always seem to
get it right with the hardware... unless you count the Xboxes dying en
masse... :-D Oh well, just disproved my own point! Heh.
