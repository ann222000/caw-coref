Return specialist Josh Cribbs could have an interesting day - if not a
frustrating one - Sunday in Oakland.

Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski leads the NFL with seven touchbacks
on kickoffs after two games.

Cribbs is second in the NFL with a 31.2-yard kickoff return average. But
he is under orders not to run if he catches the ball in the end zone.

&quot;The odds of running the ball out of the end zone are not in your
favor, so [Cribbs is told to] take the ball at the 20,&quot; coach Romeo
Crennel said.

Two weeks ago, Ellis Hobbs of the Patriots ran a kick back from 8 yards
deep in the end zone. It resulted in an NFL-record 108-yard kickoff
return for a touchdown.

Would Cribbs be scolded if he violated the team rule and ran back a
kickoff 108 yards?

&quot;No, I'd high-five him,&quot; Crennel said.

As the team's new punt returner, Cribbs has yet to get untracked. He
only has two returns for 11 yards. And in that specialty, he'll face
Oakland punter Shane Lechler, who leads the NFL in gross average (49
yards) and net (45.3).

Incidentally, Janikowski's big leg didn't faze Cribbs in the meeting in
Oakland last year. Cribbs had kickoff returns of 65 and 53 yards to
jumpstart an 18-point comeback win for the Browns.

Oakland's special teams coach was Ted Daisher, who holds the same job
with the Browns this season.

More special teams:

It's sounding as if Scott Player will be the Browns' third punter - and
placement holder - in as many games.

Regular punter Dave Zastudil said Thursday that rest is helping his
strained oblique muscle to heal, but &quot;I'm trying to be smart, knowing
that it's a long season. I want to be 100 percent instead of 70 or 80
percent.&quot;

Zastudil said he was less than 50 percent when he made a critical punt
with a minute to go in the Cincinnati game. Zastudil couldn't punt
through the ball, but benefited from &quot;an unbelievably lucky bounce&quot; that
pinned the Bengals at their own 9-yard line.

After that near-disaster, the Browns signed Player to replace Paul
Ernster, the Game 1 goat, as a longer-term replacement for Zastudil.

Sapp on Warren:

When the Raiders acquired ex-Browns tackle Gerard Warren in a trade with
Denver during preseason, Warren Sapp predicted that he wouldn't make the
team's final roster. Now he's best buddies with the former No. 1 draft
choice known as Big Money in Cleveland.

&quot;The thing about it is, he came in after we'd been in camp three weeks,&quot;
Sapp said on a conference call. &quot;You build a camaraderie with guys. It
was going to be tough, but the guy put his nose to the ground and we
found a spot for him.&quot;

Sapp added, &quot;He'll be starting Sunday.&quot;

Warren nixed a scheduled conference call with Cleveland media on Wednesday.

Warren is godfather to one of Browns linebacker Andra Davis' children.

&quot;The day he got traded, he called me to let me know,&quot; Davis said.
&quot;Money's still the same Money. He's going to be excited to play against
us. He loved it here. He feels he has some unfinished business. At the
same time, he's in Oakland now and he's trying to be acclimated to their
scheme. He'll be ready to play.&quot;

Injuries:

Browns safety Brodney Pool (concussion) did not practice for the second
day in a row, but backup Mike Adams (wrist and shoulder) did some
limited work. . . . Raiders defensive end Derrick Burgess (hamstring)
did not participate in practice for the second day in a row.

Honors:

QB Derek Anderson and RB Jamal Lewis were named FedEx Air and Ground
Players of the Week, as voted by fans on NFL.com.

No, that's asking for the reach-around.
