&quot;Our IDF&quot;

I want to return here to the issue of soldiers who refused to
participate in evicting Hevron residents from the marketplace, Mitzpe
Shalhevet.

The story as it was widely presented, was that 30 soldiers
refused, but when they were threatened with disciplinary action, some
20 relented.  Those who remained adamant in their refusal were very
swiftly disciplined -- they were jailed for 28 days and removed from
their combat units.  (Arutz Sheva says the numbers were much higher
and that many were quietly reassigned to duty such as washing dishes and
kept out of the eye of the media.)

Following the incident, a rash of op-eds appeared
that criticized the soldiers and lamented the break-down
of essential discipline in the IDF:  orders are orders and orders
must be obeyed.  If these soldiers can refuse orders here, went the
thinking, other soldiers who don't want to participate in other actions
-- don't want to serve in Judea and Samaria or go on forays into
Gaza, whatever, will be inspired to similarly refuse and then
everything will fall apart.

But there is an essential fallacy in this thinking and another side to
this story.  The issue here is whether Jewish soldiers in the Israeli
army should be enlisted to enforce a political decision that
requires taking action against other Jews.  The IDF is the &quot;Israel
defense force.&quot; Its role is to DEFEND Jews, and it should be asked
only to act against our enemies.  Involving the IDF in any
other sort of action is illegitimate. Whether or not what was done
in Hebron was itself either legal or moral, the sort of political
operation that took place there should have been executed only by
police.

~~~~~~~~~~

The soldiers who refused were almost all religious.  There is a
tremendous irony in that. For religious boys opt for combat units in
greater proportions than other segments of our society. They make the
best soldiers, in the main, because they are fiercely dedicated to the
land and what they are defending. There is nothing slipshod or
lackadaisical about their attitude towards being soldiers; statistics
show them to be among the bravest and most competent.  But what was
being asked of these boys here went against the grain of their ideology:
they were more than ready to defend Israel at any cost but not to
evict Jews from their homes (or, I would add, to destroy or
dismantle synagogues or religious houses of study).

For the powers that be to persist in this approach is to demoralize
some of the best soldiers we have.  And that is downright stupid.
There were, among the boys ordered to participate, some who live
in Judea or Samaria. They know their families might be next.  How can
you ask them to participate without doing damage to their spirit?  I
understand there was even one soldier whose family had been evicted from
Gush Katif.  Where was the thinking, that he should have been ordered
to help do this to others?

I lay the blame here on the political leaders, beginning with Ariel
Sharon.  He set a precedent with the use of the IDF for the
&quot;disengagement.&quot; This tore the nation apart and had a tremendously
negative effect on some of the soldiers who participated.  I have
placed on my website photos of soldiers crying -- in one case, an
officer sobbing -- over what they were told to do in Gush Katif.

Please, take a minute to look at these photos:

Then ask yourself if -- aside from it being inhumane  -- a policy that
promotes this response is a smart policy when we are a beleaguered
nation and must have a strong, motivated and invigorated defense force
at the ready.

I understand that our weak performance in Lebanon last summer was
partly because of how the soldiers had been used in Gush Katif. There
was the factor of demoralization, but also a lack of preparation
because soldiers had been trained for evacuation of Jews instead of
defense.  The situation was so egregious that money was dedicated to
such things as special new uniforms for some of the forces going into
Gush Katif, but supplies were lacking a year later for those going into
Lebanon to defend the nation.  The people in charge who set up this
scenario had lost their way, their vision of what we are
about.  Painfully, painfully is this so.

For the dimwits that are in charge now to continue this policy, when
it's clear that we face difficult days ahead, is indefensible (excuse
the pun).  I applaud those who had the courage to say &quot;no.&quot;

It's time for us to recall who we are and what we are about, before it's
too late.

Still more to follow on this and related subjects after Shabbat.
