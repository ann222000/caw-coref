Salmon and Vegetables En Papillote

4 salmon fillets, 1 inch thick
3 Tbsps. unsalted butter
1/2 lb. shiitake or portobello mushrooms, cut julienne
3 shallots, peeled, sliced
1 tsp. coarse salt
1/2 tsp. black pepper, finely ground
1 small chayote, seeded, cut julienne
1/4 cup dry white wine
3 sprigs epasote, leaves roughly chopped
1/2 lemon, juiced

Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Cut out 4 heart shapes
from parchment or foil, each 14 inches wide by 9
inches long. Lightly butter foil, if using. Place
seasoned salmon on 1 side of parchment or foil. Heat
medium skillet on
medium high heat. Add butter and melt. Add mushrooms
and saute until
slightly golden. Add shallots, salt and pepper. Cook 2
minutes. Add chayote and wine. Cook until almost dry.
Add epasote and lemon juice. Cool. Divide mixture
between salmon fillets, mounding slightly. Fold second
half of parchment over salmon, enclosing completely.
Fold edges over to secure tightly. Place parchment
packages on baking sheet. Bake until packets are
puffed and salmon is cooked through, about 10 minutes.
Makes 4 servings.
