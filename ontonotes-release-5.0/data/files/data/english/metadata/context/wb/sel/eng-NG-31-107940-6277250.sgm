Hi all,

Two airports in our area are under "attack" by groups that would rather
not have air traffic in their new developments built beside the existing
airport or the airport taking up space in the downtown lakefront area.
While I can see many reasons why this is short-term thinking that would
not serve the best interests of the region, I realize that as a GA pilot,
I am biased. A similar situation existed in Chicago at the time Meigs was
closed that might shed some light on the reality of our situation.

Where did the GA planes relocate, and has this had any impact on the
owners' access to or use of their planes?

Has there been any impact on the business travel to Chicago?

Is all of the traffic handled adequately by O'Hare and Midway?

Is there any record of positive or negative economic impact?

Neil

That's going to be tough to answer, Neil.   While you can certainly
quantify the federal fines Chicago has absorbed due to Daley's
Midnight Raid, and you can add up the lost income from fuel sales and
landing fees, it's going to be nearly impossible to accurately gauge
the financial cost of NOT having an airport there, as opposed to the
possible income from having a new park in its place.

It's like trying to quantify marketing efforts in business, by asking
"How many extra suites did we rent because of 'x' radio commercial?"
The answer will be subjective and opinionated hearsay.

If you surveyed folks in downtown Chicago, you might get all sorts of
folks saying "We came to the Chicago lakefront today because it's so
nice not to hear those noisy jets every five minutes" -- but you WON'T
hear from the folks who used to come to the lakefront specifically
because they liked to watch the planes.  They're simply not there to
ask.

And you certainly won't get any answers from the folks who aren't
visiting Chicago because there is no long any easy airport access.

As a data point of one, however, I know for certain that we have *not*
spent thousands of dollars in Chicago since Meigs closed, specifically
because there is no longer any easy access to downtown.

You have to ask if closing Meigs ADDED anyone who, conversely, spent
those thousands, or more?  I've heard they have concerts out on that
peninsula now -- can anyone verify that?

I live in a condo that overlooks the former Meigs field (broke my
heart when they closed it).

The city has installed a perimeter bike path around the field so I
rode around it last fall.  The field is mostly grass and weeds, with a
few small trees.  There is a concert stage, but it's a temporary
setup.  In the case of Meigs, I would make the following comments.

1.  Noise - aircraft noise was no worse than the cigarette boats
cruising down the lakefront at 50mph, or the Motorcycles on Lake Shore
Drive.  And aircraft noise is quickly gone and is primarily noticeable
on takeoff.  Music from downtown festivals in Grant Park is far more
intrusive, and sometimes runs for hours on end.
2.  Local aircraft - Meigs wasn't a good place to tie down on a long
term basis.  Tiedown charges were around $300 per month, and the
proximity to the lake created messes from seagulls.  I kept the Arrow
at Midway, which was much less expensive (at least initially).  I
don't know where the other aircraft went - I assume Midway, Palwaukee,
DuPage, Lansing, Gary,  -- lots of reliever airports.  No t-hangars
were available, nor were there any repair facilities that I know of.
It was a very limited airport.  No ILS despite frequent fog from the
lake.
3.  Alternate use - none, really.  A couple of rock concerts used the
field because it was a place they could make all the noise they wanted
without generating complaints (ironic, to me) and it was empty space.
4.  I'd guess most of the jet traffic went to Midway, which has become
noticeably busier, but the demise of ATA has helped Midway keep up.

My final conclusion is that it was an underdeveloped airport that
should (and could) have been enhanced to make it something special,
but the opposite path was taken.

Chicago, despite being a good place to live and work, is not a city of
vision, but few cities are.

Where do you live?

When I was in California, the Division of Aeronautics conducted (at the
prodding of CA Pilots' Assn.) economic surveys of GA airports to
determine economic benefits. At that time (1980s) the average benefit
was around $100K per based airplane! Some airports (Palm Springs, for
instance) were much higher, while some very small airports were less.

The opponents (mostly developers and eco-Nazis) did not like to hear
this news, so they lobbied against further studies.

I'm sure that both airports receive FAA grant money. As the destruction of
Meigs has shown, that makes little difference to the outcome. I'm just

Thanks for your response, Paul. From the above, it would seem that the GA
population didn't suffer much. I had presumed that Meigs would have been
more similar to one of our airports (Burke Lakefront in Cleveland, OH).
However, Burke does have an ILS, and quite a few GA planes &amp; helicopters
are based there year-round. I would say that, today, the airport is
under-utilized and may seem vulnerable because of that. However, its loss
would be felt by the GA community since the remaining options can't easily
absorb the resident aircraft.

thousands" would be required before it became an issue worthy of note.

While it might not have stopped Chicago, some cities and more particularly
the politicians in the cities might be a little less apt to go head to head
with the federal government.

If you are looking for ways to save an airport don't piss away any possible
allies, especially those with checkbooks and guns.

The original post only adressed the issue of consequences, and I believe
that any possibility of a major city losing an event of Olympic proportions
might have an effect on decisions in other cities.

I am not a Chicago native, nor a frequent visitor, and only visited Meigs on
one occasion many years ago.  However, I always tended to thing of it in
terns of transient corporate aviation--rather than any basing of light
aircraft--and corporate aviation appears to be for more sensitive to
convenience and timeliness than to price.  Therefore, since the closure had
must have inconvenienced a lot of "high rollers", and must continue to do
so, almost anything could gain some momentum.

In any case, I will be satisfied whether other municipalities view local
airports as assets or view airport closures as liabilities.  Anything more
would be an unexpected, but most welcome, bonus.

Given that the vandal was just reelected, perhaps a sandstorm that buries
the entire city so it never bothers us again would be a fair consequence.
On the other hand, that's probably how many outside the US feel about the
US after the 2004 federal election.

More seriously, years of financial hardship would be nice.  It may not
bring back Meigs, but it could serve as a deterrent to other locales
tempted to vandalize federal infrastructure.

On the other hand, perhaps we'd best give Chicago the pain it deserves by
helping the Olympics to be there.  This hasn't done too well for several
recent host cities.  And as someone that lives near NYC, I'm quite glad to
see the Olympics *not* in NYC.  One little political convention was enough
nonsense; we don't need the hassles the Olympics would bring.

And I can always just avoid the place.  I'd feel sorrow for NYC-dwellers
should they have to suffer this.  Chicago though, gets no sympathy,

With regard to the Kawasaki, the police did not try to apprehend him
while he was doing 160.  They waited for him to reach the end of
LakeShore Drive where there is a 90 degree turn and nailed him there.
He went to jail and they took away the bike.  When he was interviewed
he said the rush was worth it!  He did it at around 2am and the police
tried to block off entrances to the drive to keep what little traffic
there was out of his way until they could nab him.

Chicago should pay landing fees for all aircraft that land at the new
Meigs, and fuel them up for free, as compensation for the vandalism.
See, punative damages can come in handy.

&gt; That's going to be tough to answer, Neil.   While you can certainly
&gt; quantify the federal fines Chicago has absorbed due to Daley's
&gt; Midnight Raid, and you can add up the lost income from fuel sales and
&gt; landing fees, it's going to be nearly impossible toaccurately gauge
&gt; the financial cost of NOT having an airport there, as opposed to the
&gt; possible income from having a new park in its place.

&gt; It's like trying to quantify marketing efforts in business, by asking
&gt; &quot;How many extra suites did we rent because of 'x' radio commercial?&quot;
&gt; The answer will be subjective and opinionated hearsay.

&gt; If you surveyed folks in downtown Chicago, you might get all sorts of
&gt; folks saying &quot;We came to the Chicago lakefront today because it's so
&gt; nice not to hear those noisy jets every five minutes&quot; -- but you WON'T
&gt; hear from the folks who used to come to the lakefront specifically
&gt; because they liked to watch the planes.  They're simply not there to
&gt; ask.

&gt; And you certainly won't get any answers from the folks who aren't
&gt; visiting Chicago because there is no long any easy airport access.

&gt; As a data point of one, however, I know for certain that we have *not*
&gt; spent thousands of dollars in Chicago sinceMeigsclosed, specifically
&gt; because there is no longer any easy access to downtown.

&gt; You have to ask if closingMeigsADDED anyone who, conversely, spent
&gt; those thousands, or more?  I've heard they have concerts out on that
&gt; peninsula now -- can anyone verify that?
