*How do I stop my negative thoughts?&quot; - is a question that I have been asked
many times. If you have ever asked this question then you will feel such
enormous relief in knowing the answer, because it is so simple. How do you
stop negative thoughts?

You plant good thoughts!

When you try to stop negative thoughts, you are focusing on what you don't
want - negative thoughts - and you will attract an abundance of them. They
can never disappear if you are focused on them. The &quot;stop&quot; part is
irrelevant - the negative thoughts are your focus.

It doesn't matter if you are trying to stop negative thoughts or control
them or push them away, the result is the same. Your focus is on negative
thoughts, and by the law of attraction you are inviting more of them to you.

The truth is always simple and it is always easy. To stop negative thoughts,
just plant good thoughts! Deliberately plant good thoughts! You plant good
thoughts by making it a daily practice t appreciate all the things in your
day. Appreciate your health, your car, your home, your family, your job,
your friends, your surroundings, your meals, your pets, and the magnificent
beauty of the day.

Compliment, praise, and give thanks to all things. Every time you say &quot;Thank
you&quot; it is a good thought! As you plant more and more good thoughts, the
negative thoughts will be wiped out.

Why? Because your focus is on good thoughts, and what you focus on you
attract. So don't give any attention to negative thoughts.

Don't worry about them. If any come, make light of them, shrug them off, and
let them be your reminder to deliberately think more good thoughts now.

The more good thoughts you can plant in a day, the faster your life will be
utterly transformed into all good. If you spend only one day speaking of
good things and saying &quot;Thank you&quot; at every single opportunity, you will not
believe your tomorrow.

Deliberately thinking good thoughts i exactly like planting seeds. As you
think good thoughts you are planting good seeds inside you, and the Universe
will transform those seeds into a garden of paradise. How will the garden of
paradise appear? As your life!*
