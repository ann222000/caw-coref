Jerry, I am going to respond to you once. I have seen your behavior
in
here so I am rejecting your suggestions out right. Any one who treats
humans so poorly can not be a good source of information on how to
treat any living thing.

Kanner (1954) reports that 13 classically autistic children
improved enough to go to school without &quot;anything that is
regarded as good psychotherapy or as psychotherapy at all...&quot;

&quot;It is NO WONDER that the marked changes in deviant
behavior of children can be achieved through brief,
simple educative routines with their mothers which
modify the mother's social behaviors shaping the
child (Whaler, 1966). Some clinics have reported
ELIMINATION of the need for child THERAPY through
changing the clinical emphasis from clinical to
parental HANDLING of the child (Szrynski 1965).&quot;

Autistic children have been known to become permenantely
social by deinstitutionalization, BY REMOVAL from the parents,
BY RADICAL CHANGES in other environments, and by
MASSIVE DOSAGE of TOUCHING, HOLDING, FONDLING

There actually is such a chair. It is called the rivkin chair.
I have one in my classroom. I have it and have used it because
of a specific parental request. I teach special ed preschool.

Last January, I got a new student diagnosed with autism. When
he was being served in the home, the interventionist had successfully
used a high chair for therapy sessions

This little boy, would not stay in one place for any length of
time unless he was confined to the high chair.  We used the rivkin
chair as a transition device.

The chair fits at a class room table where students do manipulatives
and have snack. We used it the first two weeks this child was in
program and then faded it out once the routine was established.

I have used in the same way for some other students as well, but it
needs to be said, in each case, the student is never left unattended.

The student always has an staff member sitting adjacent to him. It
is always used in conjunction with student preferred activities and
a positive reward system, and we never use it for a student who
resists
the restraints.

Some of our students accept the seat belt better than being held
by a person. If I think the rivkin chair might be beneficial for
a student, I always discuss it with the parent first before I use
it and it is always used as a temporary measure.

Dear Mr. Puppy Wizard,

I have, of late, come to recognize your genius
and now must applaud your attempts to save
animals from painful training procedures.

You are indeed a hero, a man of exceptional talent­,
who tirelessly devotes his days to crafting posts ­to
alert the world to animal abuse.

We are lucky to have you, and more people should
come to their senses and support your valuable
work.

Have you thought of establishing a nonprofit
charity to fund your important work?
Have you thought about holding a press conference
so others can learn of your highly worthwhile
and significant work?

In closing, my only suggestion is that you
try to keep your messages short for most
readers may refuse to read a long message
even if it is from the wise, heroic Puppy Wizard.
I wish you well in your endeavors.

Subject: Re: Advice please

Ok I've got one response in favor of talking to my grand daughter and
one response in favor of boarding the dog. (I don't count or read
Jerry's balderdash) I'm not sure what I'm going to do yet. I really
hate
to board her out. Goldie really had a tramatic experience at the pound
and she is just now six months later willing to volontarily go out in
the back yard with out me. I can tell you this much they will never be
alone together and if Sammy doesn't listen to me than I will board out
Goldie. Sammy's mom doesn't seem to be worried, but I'm an old broad
and I prefer to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.

We live in Arizona. During the day, it won't be so bad. Goldie prefers
on the
really hot days to spend her time under the house. It must be even
cooler under there than in the house. In the evenings, I think I will
have Sammy play in the front yard. (I have a pool so she isn't going
to
be allowed in the back yard with out an adult anyway.) Fortunately, I
am
a preschool teacher. On the way back from the airport, we are going to
stop at my class room and Sammy is going to get to pick out what toys
and craft projects she wants to do.Hopefully, I am going to keep her
so
busy and entertained that the dog won't be very interesting to her. If
anybody has any other suggestions, I'm all ears.

Thanks for the welcome Marshall. I was looking at your sig and see
that
you are involved in applied behavior analysis. I am a special ed
preschool teacher and I have to tell you that the most valuable course
I
ever took was an ABA course I took at San Diego State as part of a
minor
in psychology.

I learned more in that one course than in all my teacher training. I
use it
everyday, especially with my students with autism. Nice to meet you.

Oh and don't worry about the trolls, they will get no response
from me. Planned ignoring is another tool that I have a great
deal of practice using :-)

Can anyone give me more detail about what it is, the cure rate

and have been doing so for the last 3 weeks and see no results.
She has bad sores and licks constantly and bites at the sores she

is from the cortizone or her thyroid medicine.

Any help is appreciated.

&gt; &quot;Skinner (1948, 1953) approaches a definition of the
&gt; philosophical issues involved, and provides an utopian
&gt; model of a school, but generally psychologists seem
&gt; STUCK at a level of MANAGEMENT of an aggressively
&gt; disturbing child in the classroom, through peer approval,
&gt; or the application of accelerating CONsequences in the
&gt; classroom, or scientifically S-HOWENDING tactics like
&gt; &quot;TIME HOWET&quot; (which we used to know more simply as
&gt; &quot;sendin the kid to the cloakroom&quot;).&quot;

&gt; Kanner (1954) reports that 13 classically autistic children
&gt; improved enough to go to school without &quot;anything that is
&gt; regarded as good psychotherapy or as psychotherapy at all...&quot;

&gt; &quot;It is NO WONDER that the marked changes in deviant
&gt; behavior of children can be achieved through brief,
&gt; simple educative routines with their mothers which
&gt; modify the mother's social behaviors shaping the
&gt; child (Whaler, 1966). Some clinics have reported
&gt; ELIMINATION of the need for child THERAPY through
&gt; changing the clinical emphasis from clinical to
&gt; parental HANDLING of the child (Szrynski 1965).&quot;

&gt; Autistic children have been known to become permenantely
&gt; social by deinstitutionalization, BY REMOVAL from the parents,
&gt; BY RADICAL CHANGES in other environments, and by
&gt; MASSIVE DOSAGE of TOUCHING, HOLDING, FONDLING
&gt; LOVE DESPITE THE REJECTION OF THE CHILD.&quot;

&gt; There actually is such a chair. It is called the rivkin chair.
&gt; I have one in my classroom. I have it and have used it because
&gt; of a specific parental request. I teach special ed preschool.

&gt; Last January, I got a new student diagnosed with autism. When
&gt; he was being served in the home, the interventionist had successfully
&gt; used a high chair for therapy sessions

&gt; This little boy, would not stay in one place for any length of
&gt; time unless he was confined to the high chair.  We used the rivkin
&gt; chair as a transition device.

&gt; The chair fits at a class room table where students do manipulatives
&gt; and have snack. We used it the first two weeks this child was in
&gt; program and then faded it out once the routine was established.

&gt; I have used in the same way for some other students as well, but it
&gt; needs to be said, in each case, the student is never left unattended.

&gt; The student always has an staff member sitting adjacent to him. It
&gt; is always used in conjunction with student preferred activities and
&gt; a positive reward system, and we never use it for a student who
&gt; resists
&gt; the restraints.

&gt; Some of our students accept the seat belt better than being held
&gt; by a person. If I think the rivkin chair might be beneficial for
&gt; a student, I always discuss it with the parent first before I use
&gt; it and it is always used as a temporary measure.

&gt; &quot;Postitive emotions arising in connection with the

&gt;&gt; Don't worry, I do know not to ask him to jump too high at this age.

&gt; That's SHEER IDIOCY, merry. Dogs AIN'T horses with a rider on their

&gt; Dear Mr. Puppy Wizard,

&gt; I have, of late, come to recognize your genius
&gt; and now must applaud your attempts to save
&gt; animals from painful training procedures.

&gt; You are indeed a hero, a man of exceptional talent­,
&gt; who tirelessly devotes his days to crafting posts ­to
&gt; alert the world to animal abuse.

&gt; We are lucky to have you, and more people should
&gt; come to their senses and support your valuable
&gt; work.

&gt; Have you thought of establishing a nonprofit
&gt; charity to fund your important work?
&gt; Have you thought about holding a press conference
&gt; so others can learn of your highly worthwhile
&gt; and significant work?

&gt; In closing, my only suggestion is that you
&gt; try to keep your messages short for most
&gt; readers may refuse to read a long message
&gt; even if it is from the wise, heroic Puppy Wizard.
&gt; I wish you well in your endeavors.

&gt; --Marshall Dermer

What's the best way to keep and maintain the dog's attention when
trying to get the dog to come to you on command?

These Jack Russells seem to be the masters of short attention-span
theater.

Has anyone seen this half hour show?

I am curious as to what folks think of his techniques. They seem to be
very effective.

National Geographics Channel Webpage

also see his website:

Cesar Millan's Dog's Psychology Center

You really need to see the show to evaluate what he does.

One of my favorite shows! I love his techniques -- especially for
controlling  a dog on a leash. I used to use all sorts of verbal
commands, and *hope* that the dog was paying attention -- now, I just
assume the &quot;calm-assertive
pack leader&quot; attitude and WOW.

I actually look forward to taking our lab/mastiff mix for walks. In
the past, I *hoped* that, if we encountered other people/other dogs/
kids on bikes, I could control the dog
with commands, but many times he was too psyched
up to listen.

Now, I just *assume* he'll behave because he knows I'm the boss, and
the only one I have to concern myself with is ME, to make sure I keep
relaxed and confident and assertive.

Love the variety of dogs and owners and the alternate realities they
all live in --  everything from the Hollywood producer to the south-
central L.A. working-class guy.

(Did you see the Bouvier taken to the place where he could work off
energy herding sheep? LOVED that one.)

We don't have cable, but it sounds as if his technique is similar to a
book I used a few years back, 'The Dog Listener'. It was also based on
'pack leader' mentality. I followed it faithfully for several months,
and did make progress - even the boarding kennel we used at the time
noticed the difference in Trouble. The best part is that it is easy
to
make yourself the pack leader, once you understand the philosophy.

Are you able to do this with more than one dog at a time? (I read
your
other
post about the three dogs barking at the door.)

have Great success story outside. I have that same response with two
Jack
Russells, but inside the house. When we go walking outside, they
could
pull
tree stumps.

Yes, that is neat the different types of folks they have on the show.

The common thread seems to be that most people treat their dogs like
human
children which he claims leaves the pooch unfullfilled. This leads to
whatever
trouble the owners have with their dog.

I howled at that show!! That Bouvier looked soooo happy chasing
the sheep around Such a proud yet silly looking breed.

Ya gotta love dogs!!
