G's,

I'll start off with club business again.

1. I am extremely happy to announce that our website is up and
running. Designed by, yours truly, and programmed by Mike Vang, the
site is not complete but there are enough pages loaded for all to
navigate through. This, of course, is a biased opinion but the site
really kicks a**. I have gone to a lot of cycling club websites all
over the country and I must say that ours is above all the rest.

Anyway, the url is  . I know, I know. Some of you
are thinking, &quot;But the web address on our jersey's is
northraleighcyclists.org!&quot; Well, we've got that covered. That will
automatically roll over to  . So no need to worry.
Please make it a point to give out the web address to everyone
interested in knowing more about the Gyros. Now, between the jersey's
and the website, our identity is complete.

Our google site is also loaded on the &quot;Forum&quot; page. We are still
working on the Locations, Gallery and Links pages so please bear with us.

2. I will not be riding this weekend but I WILL be stopping by before
the ride to collect any money for the social ride on October 15th. So,
please bring $5/each to the ride, even if you are not riding. I still
need a head count if you haven't let me know already.
Thank you, KV, Kristen, Paul, Nicole, Nancy and Patrick for donating $5
last week to the cause.

BTW, it seems that the club is forever growing larger. I deeply
appreciate the help that some of you have offered in leading the
groups. Anyone who would like to be a regular/alternative in helping to
be a ride leader, please let me know. It is a tough job having to
commit every weekend. The more volunteers to lead the easier it will be
for all.

3. I have attached pdf files of the century and the metric century that
we will be doing on the 15th of October. I have put these together
based on roads I have taken and logged already BUT there are also roads
that I am not familiar with so the mileage might be off slightly. I
know some of you will probably look at these cue sheets with scrutiny
and will let me know where I went wrong. Go ahead and tell me I'm off
by 2/10's of a mile. I think they are both close enough.

4. I would recommend that anyone who hasn't joined the google site yet,
please do so. That's why we started the google site so everyone can be
made aware of club business and rides. That is how we communicate!

5. Hope someone will volunteer to lead the groups on Saturday. On that
note, the ride is as follows and don't forget that there is a Road Dog
Rally at 8:30am so it will be pretty crowded at PUE. Maybe some of you
are doing that ride instead.

Thanks and see you Saturday! Tony

Tomy,
Either I am doing something wrong, or the site won't come up. Maybe it's
getting hit on so much ( nationwide ) that it shut itself down.

Gyros,

I'll be happy to lead one of the Gyros groups this Saturday.

The Road Dogs are also leaving from PUE this Saturday, but at 8:30AM. I
guarantee their ride will be a fast paced event (19-20++). Remember their
motto is &quot;we only drop our friends.&quot; I can tell you form experience
everyone is their &quot;friend.&quot; In the infamous words of Martin Dvorak: &quot;Hamma,
hamma, hamma und hamma some more.&quot; I am sure some of our Gyros Hammerheads
are up for it.

Start time for the Gyros ride will be 8:00 AM. Distance and pace TBD based
on the interest and attendance. We can break into two groups if needed with
paces of 18-19 and 16-17 respectively. I'll need a volunteer for the second
group if we do split up.

Choose wisely.

Gary

Since I am not up for the Road Dogs ride I would be happy to lead the B
group ride. We can either do the same route as the A group just at a
slower pace or we can do our own thing. I will leave up to the rest of
the group wishing to ride at the slower pace. See you there.

I'm going to try to be there for the &quot;B&quot; ride on Saturday morning. I'm
coming off some serious knee surgery, so I don't dare try the &quot;A&quot;
ride...and I'm certainly not going anywhere near the Road Dogs ride!
