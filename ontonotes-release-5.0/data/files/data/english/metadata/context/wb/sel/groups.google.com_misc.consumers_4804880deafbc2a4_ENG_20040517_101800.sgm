Adipose Nation
It’s Time to Tax the Fat

You’ve maybe noticed that many commercial airplanes still have razor blade
disposals built into their bathroom modules–a legacy of more innocent days
when the most insidious motives of air passengers was assumed to be
mile-high coitus or a quick wank. America was not prepared for the
terrorists, and airplanes are not prepared for Americans, is what I’m
thinking as the passenger beside me on this full flight from Houston to New
York shuffles sideways up the aisle to claim his seat.

I am enduring the midget leg room of economy class when I glance up to
observe a set of gigantic buttocks backing into my row without even the
flashing lights or warning beeps of a wide-load truck, and then descending
like a wrecking ball to obliterate the innocent seat cushion. He is in his
40s and wearing bright yellow shorts–pale, heavy legs like beech trunks and
what appears to be a good-size honeydew melon smuggled in the general area
of his crotch. He is apologetic as he squeezes into his seat, and I try not
toshow my dismay when a portion of his quivering belly sneaks amoeba-like
beneath our shared armrest. It is not intentional contact, I try to remind
myself each time I turn the page of a magazine and my forearm brushes
lightly against his pendulous apron of flab. &quot;Damn seats getting smaller
and smaller,&quot; he grunts, but I sense he knows better–I assume it is his way
of apologizing for making my uncomfortable economy class air voyage even
less comfortable. I poke my head up, casually searching front and back for
a less encumbered seat, but the plane is ram-a-jam full. And so I just
smile a tight public-transportation smile of violated boundaries and shrug
to indicate what I cannot bring myself to say, which is–Hey, what are you
going to do? I cannot bring myself to say that because, if I did, I would
feel compelled to answer my own query. Viz: what our fat friend could do is
eat less, exercise a bit and try to be more sensitive to the small red
flags of warning that life sometimes flies for our benefit–such as barely
being able to squeeze your ass into a commercial airplane seat–as an
indication that all is not well.

But that would be cruel, would it not? It would surely hurt his feelings.
And what purpose would it serve to have an irate fat man beside me for the
duration of the voyage, his pseudopods of blubber radiating hot indignation
as they probe my personal space? And perhaps corrective action is not as
simple as it seems. Maybe he has been prescribed medication–antidepressants
or steroids, for example–that have transformed him into a human balloon. Or
he could be brain-damaged, a once-lithe marathoner whose hunger-regulating
hypothalamus was lost through the windshield of a car in a freak accident.
And even if he suffers from a standard case of eating too much, then surely
he has always been obese and was taunted cruelly as a child, robbed of
self-esteem and the opportunity to develop normal social skills. He likely
found solace in the pleasure of food and now must contend on a daily basis
with the intolerance of people he inconveniences with his girth, as well as
the unveiled disgust of those who are repelled by the sight of so much
shivering lard adorning the human frame.

There are people who harbor a strong hatred for the fatties of the
world–weightists? body fascists?–the way some hate Jews or German tourists.
I am not one of them, however. And so I just shrug and smile my tight smile
at this Person of Size (Person of High Adiposity?) and focus on my
magazine, gyrating as much as possible toward the little oval window so as
to avoid unintentionally caressing his expansive gut.

Emergency exits are indicated, headphones distributed, the drink cart goes
up and down the aisle–water for me; a coke and a beer for my seatmate. Then
the boiled garbage aroma of an elementary school cafeteria announces the
arrival of the food trolley. There is beef or pasta–I take the pasta; he
takes the beef. The foil cover of the entree is pulled back; molded plastic
utensils emerge from their sanitary condom; the salad is revealed in its
sterile terrarium. More water for me; another coke with a beer chaser for
my friend. He eats quickly–gobbling, scarfing, packing his face. He
demolishes his medallion of beef in two bites and then sops up the gravy.
His anemic salad is dispatched after being marinated in
nuclear-sunset-colored French dressing squeezed from an airtight tube. All
that remains is dessert–a three-layer cake with white frosting topped by
shavings of dark chocolate. The nasty confection of refined sugar and
animal suet is raised a few inches from his lips and suctioned mercilessly
from its plastic well, disappearing in a flea’s breath down that
well-traveled gorge to the soundtrack of a juicy swallow.

Then comes the clatter of meal trays being collected by the zombie army of
air stewardesses. I am reading a London paper that a visitor left at my
house the day before, and now I sense the fat man’s eyes on me. The
rattle-stacking approaches and I feel him growing tense with expectation. I
think I know what he wants, but I don’t look up. The trolley is just behind
us now and he can wait no longer–Excuse me, he says, are you going to eat
that? He is pointing at my dessert, which still sleeps an innocent chemical
sleep inside its tiny transparent sarcophagus. Perhaps it is because I had
just moments before read some news that I’m sure you’ve also heard
about–about a morbidly obese man who’s hired a lawyer to bring suit against
four major fast-food restaurants for negligence (Daily Mail, 7/26: &quot;I’m
McSuing You&quot;). Perhaps it is because the older I get the more certain I am
that quid pro quo makes the world go round. What I tell the fat man is:
&quot;Okay, but only if you agree to answer five questions as truthfully and
with as little emotional response as possible.&quot;

He seems to know what line of questioning to expect and does not seem keen
on it. He hesitates. But our sky waitress has already removed his ravaged
food tray and is robotically extending her hand toward mine. &quot;Okay,&quot; he
says, reaching for his prize. I slap that big old hand away and deposit the
cake in escrow on top of the armrest between us. The conversation that
follows is more or less this:

Ready?

I could make that your first question, but I won’t.

Oh, right. Thanks. Okay, first question–why are you so fat?

I’m big–I’ve always been big. Even as a baby I was big. My parents were
big. My sisters are big.

But you eat a lot and very quickly. I honestly have never seen anyone eat
so fast. I bet that doesn’t help.

Is that your second question?

No, come on, a bet isn’t a question and you haven’t really answered my
first one.

Okay–I like to eat. I’m always hungry. It’s genetic. I guess I don’t feel
full like other people.

Question number two–do you exercise?

No–it’s too hard for me to exercise and I’ve never been good at sports.

But clearly it’s a vicious circle–you don’t exercise because you are fat
and you are fat because you don’t exercise.

Is that your third question?

No, here it comes–what if I kidnapped you and forced you to lose weight
through a regime of diet and exercise? Maybe some liposuction.

I would have you arrested. Kidnapping is against the law even if your
intentions are good.

But you would lose weight and later you would thank me for it, right? You
would be thin and grateful. You’d be too happy to press charges.

Is that your fourth question?

Which?

Whether I would thank you?

No, this is–Are you aware that you are more likely to die an early death
because of your obesity?

Yes, but you could die crossing the street. You could get run over by a
bus. This plane could crash. Terrorists could hijack it. Think about all
the people on diets who were killed on Sept. 11. Deprivation–and for what?
You have to enjoy life because you don’t know when it will end. I enjoy
eating and I don’t enjoy exercising and I don’t mind being as big as I am
and that’s all there is to it. I used to feel bad about it, especially when
I was younger, but now I realize that it is not my problem–it’s other
people’s problem. If you don’t like the way I look then it’s your problem.

What if there was a law that made being so fat illegal–what would you do
then?

I would move somewhere else–I wouldn’t want to live in a country that had
laws like that.

You’re right–neither would I. Thanks for playing along. Enjoy your cake.

We did not speak again. I thought of some more questions during the
in-flight movie, but I didn’t have any more food to trade. It was a square
deal–he bolted his second piece of cake and I started chewing on this idea.

Walt Whitman is the poet of the Great America, the one he knew during his
lifetime (he was born in 1819), as opposed to the Fat America that has
materialized during the 30-odd years of my existence. Whitman sang about
the strong and striving America–about himself as an embodiment of a
bustling society of hearty, free individuals. If Whitman were alive today,
I doubt he would be as thrilled to embody the soft and complacent nation
that the U.S. has become just over a century after his death–this adipose
nation where immense mothers of giant toddlers defend their infants’
obscene girth on scream-to-win television talk shows whose studio audience
is similarly bloated and porcine; where the question in that old Special K
cereal advertisement that chimed &quot;can’t pinch an inch on you&quot; has become
dissonant when applied to most Americans (a more relevant slogan today
might be: &quot;Can you not reach around to clean your own fundament?&quot;); where
men exist who eat so much so rapidly for so long that it takes half a dozen
firemen to remove them by crane through the window of a bedroom they have
not left in years.

And what was that you said that you were no longer at Cisco?

IP address: 171.71.79.66
Host name: mvoight-w2k02-1.cisco.com

KOOK.

About rogue Cisco employee and netkook/troll/usenet flooder
Michael Voight, alias &quot;mrtravel&quot;, &quot;mrtravelkay&quot;, etc.

&quot;mrtavelkay&quot; is the latest usenet handle of a brainless troll whose real name is
Michael Voight, e-mail &lt;mvoi ... @cisco.com&gt;.

Michael D. Voight
111 Bean Creek Rd, No. 118
Scotts Valley, CA 95066-4148
(831) 438-2485

He is better known by his previous stupid handle, &quot;mrtravel&quot;.

The idiot works for Cisco in their Scotts Valley, California
Technical Assistance Center (TAC) and apparently they don't
keep him busy enough so he has to troll usenet newsgroups all day long from
work.

***WARNING: THIS IDIOT HAS BEEN CAUGHT FORGING PEOPLE'S IDENTITIES ON USENET
AND CANCELLING THEIR POSTS.***

If you are one of his victims, or are simply fed up with his trolling/newsgroup
flooding, forward his posts to a ... @cisco.com .

He works in technical support, so forward them to t ... @cisco.com too.

See further below for more Cisco contact information.

He often posts through sbcglobal and prodigy, so forward them to
a ... @prodigy.net and a ... @sbcglobal.net as well.

His main hangout is alt.visa.us.marriage-based, a sleazy newsgroup where
foreigners wanting to immigrate to the US hook up with losers like Voight who
are willing to marry them for money so they can get their green card. Voight is
a pro at this, handing out daily advice on how to be a sleazoid like him and
sell green cards.

When he isn't giving out advice on how to commit federal crimes on
alt.visa.us.marriage-based he is usually on rec.travel.air flooding that
newsgroup with trolls and harassing posters and picking retarded fights with the
regular posters there.

He also tends to post a lot in the personals and penpals newsgroups as well as
the support groups for fat people, lonely folks, and for depression. Obviously
after his Russian Internet brides get their green cards they flee, leaving him
lonely and desperate for company. Maybe that's why he keeps a P.O. Box at the
post office, so he can get his personals mail there:

Voight, Michael
P.O. Box 67016,
Scotts Valley, CA 95067
(408) 461-8707

He also seems to frequent the teenage newsgroups. Creepy.....

The idiot is a two-time high school dropout and had to join the Marines because
even the Army rejected him!

He's got a daughter in Orange County that one of his ex-wives had the
intelligence to take away from him. Lord only knows what could have
happened to her if she had continued to live with the kook. The other kids he
has belong to his previous Russian sleazy brides, and since they come and go so
do the kids. It wouldn't hurt to let Cisco know what kind of deviant sexual
pervert they have working for them.

Many people have wondered how Cisco ever hired such a psycho. It cheapens their
image and credibility in the corporate world after all. Well, they didn't hire
him directly, he came as baggage when they acquired the company he used to work
for, TGV Software. His e-mail address there used to be &lt;mvoi ... @tgv.com&gt;.

All intelligent members of the usenet community have killfiled him, so he takes
great pains to get past their killfiles by rubbing his only two cerebral neurons
together and coming up with gems like: mrtrav &lt;mrt ... @mtr.mrt.trm&gt;, mrtrav3
&lt;m ... @aa.aa&gt;, mrraveltay &lt;mrravel ... @me.igpay.atinlay&gt;, and mrtravelkay
&lt;mrtravel ... @a.aa&gt;, and mtravelkay &lt;a ... @aaa.aaa&gt; and &lt;&quot;&quot;a.a\&quot;@a,a,a&gt;.

Some of his other trolling aliases are Network Guy,
&lt;starrystarryni ... @sbcglobal.net&gt;, sleepydoc &lt;sleep ... @verizon.net&gt;, jlhunt
&lt;jlh ... @huntbros.com&gt;, and Lost 5 of 8 &lt;s ... @loveme.fun&gt;, mrt &lt;m ... @mrt.com&gt;,

&lt;dtanner1 ... @dtanner.org&gt;, Jeff Davies &lt;t ... @test.test&gt;, BobTheBuilder
&lt;n ... @build.me.an.ark&gt;. The lastest product of his brain diarrhea is Bill
Clarkj &lt;b ... @billclarkpresents.com&gt;.

It would be a good idea to call Cisco at 1-800-553-2447 and ask to speak with a
supervisor and explain that you are EXTREMELY unhappy that this idiot spends his
whole day at work playing on the internet on company time. THEY WILL NOT LIKE
THAT.

Then write to corporate headquarters explaining what this idiot is doing and
telling them HOW BAD IT IS FOR THEIR COMPANY IMAGE. They will LOVE that you
brought this to their attention:

Cisco Systems, Inc.
170 West Tasman Dr.
San Jose, CA 95134
USA

Then also call them. You should always follow up email or letters with phone
calls. Always ask for supervisors or managers. Try to get as far up as
possible.

(408)526-4000
(800)553-NETS or
(800)553-6387

Contact Investor Relations and tell them you are interested in investing in
their company but won't do so until they get rid of this asshole who is wasting
company resources:

Cisco Systems, Inc.
Investor Relations Department
170 West Tasman Drive
San Jose, CA 95134-1706
Phone: (408) 526-8890
Fax: (408) 526-4545
Email: investor-relati ... @cisco.com

Might as well contact customer service too, they LOVE to hear about this type of
stuff:

USA 1 800 553 6387

ic-support ... @cisco.com
cs-support ... @cisco.com

Then finally, send letters with copies of his nasty posts addressed
personally to each one of the OFFICERS of the company using the
headquarters address. Believe me, they READ your complaints and are VERY
INTERESTED in them, especially if it's about one of their employees. They will
take a PERSONAL interest in rooting this ASSHOLE out of their company:

John Morgridge, Chairman
John Chambers, President, CEO
Donald Valentine, Vice Chairman
Larry Carter, CFO, Sr. VP-Fin. and Admin., Sec., Director
Richard Justice, Sr. VP, Worldwide Field Operations

Have fun!

For a coward who hides out in cyberspace you are certainly pushy.
However you should note that I've never said that I ram my knees into
folks backs. It is rather that they try to crush my knees with their
seat backs. Twerp still appears appropriate.

Contact Investor Relations and tell them you are interested in investing in
their company but won't do so until they get rid of this asshole who is wasting
company resources:

Cisco Systems, Inc.
Investor Relations Department
170 West Tasman Drive
San Jose, CA 95134-1706
Phone: (408) 526-8890
Fax: (408) 526-4545
Email: investor-relati ... @cisco.com

Might as well contact customer service too, they LOVE to hear about this type of
stuff:

ic-support ... @cisco.com
cs-support ... @cisco.com

Then finally, send letters with copies of his nasty posts addressed
personally to each one of the OFFICERS of the company using the
headquarters address. Believe me, they READ your complaints and are VERY
INTERESTED in them, especially if it's about one of their employees. They will
take a PERSONAL interest in rooting this ASSHOLE out of their company:

John Morgridge, Chairman
John Chambers, President, CEO
Donald Valentine, Vice Chairman
Larry Carter, CFO, Sr. VP-Fin. and Admin., Sec., Director
Richard Justice, Sr. VP, Worldwide Field Operations

Have fun!
