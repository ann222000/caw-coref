Hmm...I'm not knocking any of these products because I haven't tried any of them
myself but I did read an articly that made a lot of sense a little while back. It
stated that if these oil additives could effectively bond with high friction areas such
as cyliner walls, camshafts, etc. then it could certainly bond with metal hoses,
inside of the oil sender unit, oil filter, etc. where there was no friction at all. The
article said that in this case it just gummed up the whole works of the system and
caused much more harm than good. Made sense to me. I guess if I ever need to drain all
the oil out my car and go somewhere I'd like to have some because after all that's all
I've seen this stuff do well. :)

This info (and some other fun stuff) is @

the best thing for your engine is to change the oil and filter frequently
with a good quality oil (I prefer Castrol), and filter (I use AC-Delco).
However, what is Fram doing offering a line of filter with Teflon added?

"/> My Honda mechanic told me (when I still had my Honda) that Teflon based
additives could damage your engine in many ways. One was way involved
the filtration of the oil and a buildup of teflon in many oil filters.
The most serious was in reference to heat. He said that the teflon does
get into all the little nooks and crannys of the engine, however at high
temperature teflon begins to expand. At higher temperatures this can
cause serious damage.
Unfortunately I had put in Dura-Lube at 40k miles in my '89 Civic. Sure
most give some type of 50k mile warranty in their ad gimmick. Well, at
101k miles (figures, right after I sold it to my sister) the engine needs
to be rebuilt. VERY uncharacteristic for a Honda! Teflon based junk -
never again!
After a good break-in time on my '95 Z28 I switched to synthetic oil
(staying away from any teflon Slick-50 types). My mileage has increased
a good 1.5 to 2 points. I'd suggest using synthetic oils instead of
teflon additives.

"/> Teflon is not bad it just has some real problems. For instance, since
it's so stinking slick, how to you expect it to stick to cylinder walls
like the ads claim. It is true that race car drivers have sent their
engines in to be teflon-coated, but I'm sure they don't use stuff like
slick 50.

I think the major problem with additives like slick 50 is not the
teflon, but the carrier. From what I've heard, the carrier gets stuck
to the sides of various oil ports, and restricts the flow.

As far as Teflon grease, gaskets, etc are concerned, I don't think I've
heard any complaints. Teflon is extremely durable, and IS one of the
slickest substances known to man. I use Teflon grease on my bicycle
(currently worth twice the value of my car) However, I think unless
they find some way to carry the PTFE particles better, you should avoid
Teflon motor oils like the plague!

"/> About a year ago I attended a conference (Rocky Mountain Fleet Managers
Association), one of the seminars that stick in my mind was done by a rep from
Ford. He was talking about various things, but the line I remember best is
when he told us:

&quot;Never use oil additives in our engines, but if you must use
an oil additive, here's a Ford part number for one we make, but like I
said...Never use oil additives.&quot;

Another point that the reps from Ford and Chevrolet both made was that there
was no advantage to using a higher octane fuel in their vehicles than was
recomended. And that if (for example) they (Ford or Chevy) recommended an 87
octane unleaded....use of a higher octane gasoline could actually be harmful.

Teflon (A DuPont trademark for Polytetrafluoroethylene) can be applied in
in ovens to engine parts much like it's applied to tools and frypans.
This is often in powder or paint form, and can help special cases.

When added to the oil, PFTE doesn't adhere much to the metal. Worse, it
often finds it's way to the combustion chamber, piston crown or other
really hot parts. There it will decompose, and evolve some hydrogen
fluoride (HF), AKA Hydrofluoric acid, the stuff that etches glass. The
HF can attack the soft metal of bearings, or cause other corrosion.

Good motor oil has basicity additives to combat acid gas corrosion from
SOx and CO2 from combustion blowbye. But why tax the additive?

Not recommended.

coating on it. The more smooth the surface, the better the bond.
Now, how long it would stay attached to the surface was in
question..... But it seemed to stay there for 60K+ ...... It seemed
to work for me, however, the oil pressure dropped after I put it in
slightly, but stayed higher even though the motor was hot. Cold
cranking oil pressure was higher too.

This is, however, with a GASOLINE engine. I am un-familiar with

&gt;&gt;&gt;imagine a piston going 6000 RPM!!!

&gt;&gt;What only 6000 RPM? I've had a lawnmower at 11000! No teflon either.

&gt; It was a number I made up just to emphasize my point as most
&gt; automotive engines redlie at about 6000 rpm on average.

i found the best oil for my car is castrol gtx .... i have an '89 probe gt ... posted pix of it here before too .... i disagree on teflon bad .... just use it as wax like i do &lt;wink&gt;
bird crap flies right off

and to answer any questions i would recomend a probe to anyone
mine has 127k miles runs and looks like new ... and i just got home from a trip from seatle WA and i live in detroit
this is the 4th cross country trip its been on

"/> Teflon begins to soften and distort at about 400 F.
It could never survive the heat inside the
combustion chamber. It also has the charming side effect of forming phosgene
(WW 1 nerve gas) when it burns.
The only thing I've ever had make a noticable difference
in lubrication/consumption is synthetic oil (Pennzoil Syntec, sp?). My truck
('93 Ranger STX, 4.0L, 5sp) does not consume it at all between oil changes
(every 4500 miles). Regular oil can be consumed at about 1 qt between
changes if I have hauled a lot or wound the engine in the higher
revs.

Article or not, I will stick to my own experience with Teflon additives. I have
always used synthetic oil in my motorcycle and kept track of mileage. Four
summers ago I planned a trip to the east coast (I lived in Ill.) and put in a
quart of Slick 50. My highway mileage increased about 5 miles per gallon. I
couldn't believe it. After I drained the oil my mileage continued to stay high
and tapered off eventually until I added another quart about a year later.

Teflon may break down at temperatures above 400 deg. F., but my engine runs at
about 180 deg. F. and very little oil ever makes it into the combustion
chamber, otherwise my engines would burn oil - none of them do. If you believe
everything you read, consumer reports just came out with an article that you
don't need to change your oil every 3000 miles and that synthetics offer the
same performance as conventional oils. The only way to know is to try it
yourself. I don't have lab equipment or dynos to do testing, I just know that
less friction = more hp, better mileage and ultimately - less engine wear.

I put Slick 50, Mobil 1 and I use Split Fire plugs in my 1993 Probe GT. My
manufacturer's rated highway mileage is rated at a best of 27 MPG. I drive 80+
MPH on the highway and get 30 MPG. Imagine if I did 55...
