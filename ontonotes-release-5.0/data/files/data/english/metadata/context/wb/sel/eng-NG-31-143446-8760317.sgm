DEBKAfile Exclusive: High  alert at American Sinai monitors HQ, Egyptian
security forces and Israel for  Hamas mass rally Sept 1 to smash through Rafah
terminal  -  _ www.debka.com_ ( http://www.debka.com/ )
Hamas plans to use 100,000 protesters against  the hardships in Gaza, which
are blamed on Egypt’s closure of the Rafah outlet,  as a battering ram to break
through the crossing Saturday and link up with  fellow Palestinians in
Egyptian N. Sinai. Hamas will then seize both sides of  the border including a part
of Sinai. Cairo has cautioned Gaza’s Hamas rulers  that beefed-up Egyptian
units are under orders to shoot the first Palestinian  trespasser crossing
through.
Egypt, which closed the Rafah gateway after  the Hamas takeover of Gaza two
months ago, has set up a two-line deployment  between Rafah and El Arish to
halt the Palestinian influx. Some units are armed  with gear for crowd dispersal.
The US National Guard unit manning the  Multinational Force Organization’s Al
Gorah headquarters in el Arish has  declared a high alert and pulled in
reinforcements from Sharm el-Sheikh after  receiving intelligence of a plan to
attack them under cover of the Gaza  demonstration. Their commander was warned by
Egyptian officials that “events  highly dangerous to the region are expected
Saturday.”
Israel has also built up strength at the Kerem  Shalom crossing to Gaza and
Egypt opposite the Philadelphi border strip.
Fears of extreme violence overtaking Gaza  Saturday have been fanned by a
Fatah decision, revealed here by DEBKAfile’s  military sources, to take advantage
of Hamas’ preoccupation with crashing the  Rafah crossing to recover
positions grabbed by Hamas two months ago. Fatah is  organizing its own rallies in the
Gaza Strip Saturday for two purposes: One, to  divert demonstrators from the
Hamas rally and, two, to show defiance to the  Hamas government’s ban on
unlicensed Fatah demonstrations and threat to fire on  such rallies. Fatah will not
ask a government it does not recognize for any such  permit. Therefore, Gaza
may face a new flare-up of gun battles.
Wednesday, DEBKAfile reported:
Conditions in Gaza are so desperate that Hamas  leaders believe they have
nothing to lose by extreme measures to break the siege  – even at the risk of
heavy casualties from Egyptian fire. To avoid a bloodbath  Saturday, Cairo would
be forced to resume contacts with Hamas leaders. This  would create a breach
in the international boycott against them.
For some weeks, Gaza Palestinian groups have  targeted the crossings into
Israel with terrorist tactics as well as missile and  mortar fire. Israeli
authorities are waiting to see how Cairo resolves the  dilemma between smashing the
Hamas protest by force or renewed dialogue. Hamas  will only talk if
concessions to ease its isolated state are offered, but this  would have a plus side
for Israel: Cairo could pick up its mediation effort on  behalf of the Israeli
soldier Gilead Shalit, who has been held in Gaza for more  than 14 months.
Since that effort was dropped, there has been no progress for  his release.
