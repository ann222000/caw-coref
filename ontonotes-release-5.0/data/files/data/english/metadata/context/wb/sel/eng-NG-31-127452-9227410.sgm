Maung Than Shwe and his cronies in the so-called State Peace [really Peace?]
and Development [what kind of Development?] Council [is it a Council or a
one-man show by Maung Than Shwe?] have never been sincere. They are liars
and deceivers. They follow in the footsteps of one Adolf Hitler, who said
&quot;Tell lies fully and confidently.&quot;

NEW YORK: United Nations envoy Ibrahim Gambari has critcised Myanmar's
military regime for closing down a monastery used as a hospice for HIV/AIDS
patients.

&quot;Any action that runs counter to the spirit of national reconciliation in an
all-inclusive manner, any action that will inflame passions, any actions
that will undermine the dialogue between the Government and those who
disagree with the policies of the Government should be avoided, &quot; Gambari
said.

Last Thursday, Myanmar security forces sealed Maggin Monastery in Yangon and
forced two monks and six novices vacate the premises.

The monastery also provided housing for HIV/AIDS patients, who came to
Yangon seeking treatment.

Gambari, the Secretary-General's Special Advisor, underscored that the UN
has repeatedly called for the release of detained pro-democracy leader Aung
San Suu Kyi.
