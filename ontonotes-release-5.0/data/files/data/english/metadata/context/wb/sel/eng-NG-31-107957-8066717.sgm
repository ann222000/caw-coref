&gt;Hi folks, this is my first post to this esteemed group. I'm
&gt;hoping that there's a few Australian participants besides
&gt;myself who might be able to cast some light on this enquiry...

&gt;I've recently stumbled across a couple of web sites with designs
&gt;for tiny one-sheet or one-and-a-half-sheet boats, and I thought
&gt;I might have a go at making one. There are a couple of gaps in
&gt;my knowledge though:

&gt;First, can someone suggest what I might expect to pay for an
&gt;appropriate sheet of circa 2440mm x 1220mm plywood in Sydney
&gt;Australia, along with suggestions as to a source. I looked
&gt;yesterday at my local 'Bunnings' (not really expecting to
&gt;find anything appropriate) and found that I could have any
&gt;sort of ply I wanted, so long as I wanted 600mm x 1200mm
&gt;sheets :-/ Locations from the city to the north-east are
&gt;most accessible to me. (Some indicative pricings from other
&gt;parts of the planet would be equally welcome)

&gt;Second, is there some sort of finish that I might apply to a
&gt;plywood boat that would provide the necessary waterproofing
&gt;whilst at the same time being clear, so the grain of the
&gt;wood remains visible?

&gt;Third, what type of plywood should I be looking for? Am I
&gt;correct in assuming that I must use 'marine ply' for this
&gt;light-use application in a small one-person boat, or are
&gt;there alternatives that I should consider? Price is more
&gt;of a consideration than durability, since my interest is
&gt;more in the building than the using!

&gt; Thanks in advance,

I can't give you much advise about plywood size other then to say that
a 4&quot; X 8&quot; sheet is standard (1220 X 2440mm) and you should have no
problems locating plywood of that size.

You want to use either &quot;marine grade&quot; or &quot;exterior grade&quot; plywood.
They both use waterproof glue and the main difference is the allowable
voids in the cores. If you can find a yard that will let you pick
through a stack of exterior grade and select the one that doesn't show
any voids in the core then it will work perfectly well. If you just
have to take the sheet they give you then I would probably take the
marine grade, although it will be more expensive.

I'm not sure how you plan on building this boat but for a small dinghy
I'd use the &quot;stitch and glue&quot; method where you cut the various panels
to size and tie them together with wire, cable ties, strong string,
whatever, and then smear glue in the joints.

Once the glue has hardened you then fair the joints, using epoxy
filler, to a nice smooth radius and lastly tape over the joints with 4
inch fiberglass tape.

While initially this sounds like a lot of messing about it ends up
being easier then setting up a mold, cutting frames and building a
boat the traditional way. The stitch and glue boat will also be
lighter.

You can use anything to build a boat. BUT is it isn't waterproof it
won;t last long. If you build it out of proper materials you can
always sell it and get a little money back but something that is
splintering and de laminating will be a little hard to get rid of.

If you are interested in a really good small dinghy do a web search
for a &quot;D4&quot; dinghy. The plans are free and the guy's web site has a
wealth of information on building boats.

Hi
To answer a couple of your queries

The fibreglass taped join is far superior to a glued stringer-
Not overkill as it's not as strong.
Much easier to tape the chine.

To clear finish the best method is epoxy coating and then a clear UV
filtering varnish or polyurethane.
Having said that, if you are not going to store it in the sun for long
periods or keep it in wet conditions, eg if in a garage, then any cheap
varnish equivalent will do.

Actually a properly made &quot;stitch and glue&quot; joint is probably stronger
then using a batten to screw to. Remember that there is a epoxy filler
fillet, usually about a half by half inch at each place the plywood
joins, which is then covered with a 4 inch fiberglass tape. I tape my
joints both inside and outside, which may be over kill,  and while I
have never actually tested one to destruction I am willing to bet that
the joint is stronger then the parent plywood.

Of course it is your boat and you should build it the way you think
best but do take into consideration that literally thousands of stitch
and glue boats and if the method wasn't effective certainly there
would be comments all over the net.

Have a look around your local Marinas. There are umpteen boat builders

Get &quot;exterior grade&quot; plywood available from Mr Plywood. It is basically the
same spec as marine ply without the high quality veneered face, therefore
cheeper.

For ecconomical clear finish apply 4-5 coats marine gloss varnish, thin the
first coat 50% with turps.

For my input I will suggest it is better to spend the extra dollars on
good marine plywood (preferably BS 1088). I have had instances when
bending standard ply, especially for smaller boats with tight curves,
it cracks or splits. If you crack a side putting it on, you will end
up spending as much as marine anyway;)

Not to mention, better ply will bend fair, making it easy to keep nice
lines on the boat, which also leaves you with a lot less fairing and
sanding too. Of course, it will stand up a lot longer than standard
ply, years longer with similar care, and will in the end, generally be
much lighter. Using BS 1088 Occoume can save you 25% on the weight of
the hull, even compared to standard marine ply. A standard sheet of
1220x2440 with a thickness of 6mm (appx. 1/4&quot; for us yanks) is about
10kilo or 22lbs... for the yanks.

I actually just gave up on using standard plywood years ago, in the
long run, it's just not worth it.

Epoxy.  Which must in turn be covered with an UV inhibiting finish
because UV breaks down epoxy rather rapidly.

It is both overkill and a nuisance.  A nuisance because it creates
more surfaces to sand and finish but primarily because those surfaces
also catch and hold water (and dirt) and water encourages rot.

It doesn't take that much more work and would be very little more
difficult if you made it for rowing only.  The author of the one you
linked made a good point about a single lengthwise seat; it would need
more than one position for oarlocks.

Regardless of which you make, if you use &quot;glue and stitch&quot; practice
making the thickened epoxy fillets so that you can make them neatly
and uniformly - you'll save a ton of sanding.  IMO, the easiest tool
to apply them is a sphere...possibly a rubber ball.  Foam cylinders
work well too...I bought one of the foam pool toys...a cylinder about
2 1/2&quot; in diameter and maybe four feet long.  Cut off a piece about 2&quot;
wide, apply/fair epoxy putty, throw away.

Also, do the gunnels well...they really stiffen everything up.

You do *NOT* want CD.  A decent (AB or BB) exterior would be usable
but not CD.  Even with the better face plies you'd need to look for
sheets without obvious interior voids.  Considering the cost of epoxy,
I wouldn't skimp on the cost of the ply it is to cover.  Not to
mention time.

Nice to see a kindred spirit in the newsgroup.

Look for Herb McLoed's one sheet skiff, Gavin Atkin's  Mouse, and
Prizm by a guy in Finalnd, all one sheeters. Also look in
www.ncf.ca/~ag384/Boats.htm for the small boats I've designed and
built for myself.

The plywood of choice if underlayment. It's nailed to floors to go
under vinyl and other flooring, hence it's name. There are three
kinds. Luan and meranti are essentially the same, some king of Asian
cedar. The meranti I've seen has better surfaces and frwer voids than
the lauan. They weigh about one  pound per sq ft, the same as okume
marine plywood. Virola, the other kind is from Brazil, weighs half as
much as lauan and meranti, bends a lot easier, but resists water like
tissue paper. I've build two boats out of it and have to keep sealing
surface splits and gluing pieces of surface ply back on. All three are
very cheap. Look along each edge and pick sheets with no gaps &quot;voids&quot;
in the edge. If voids are unavoidable they can be filled by drilling
holes and forcing in caulk or glue with a caulking gun. These boats
last longer if stored inside, for example in a garage or carport.

I use screw and glue construction with chine battens cut from cedar
2x4's and then cut in half to make 3/4&quot;x3/4&quot; battens. The glue is
LePages' Bull Dog brand PL Premium polyurehtan construction adhesive
in the caluking tube. Very cheap. The outside seams are rounded with a
sander and sealed with a dab of polyester resin spread with a
toothpick. The finish is semi-gloos latex acrylic house paint below
the water and linseed oil everywhere else.  The way to reinforce the
thin plywood bottom is with a keal or skids on the outside and if
nececessary bits of plywood glued to the bottom on the inside.

I don't know why Google groups doen't have a spell checker...  :(

1. Paint

In both cases, the amine blush has to be washed off the epoxy

Well, if you are going to use Luan or Meranti (I have used both too)
feel it before you buy. If you &quot;pet&quot; the panel all over with a flat
hand, many times you can &quot;hear&quot; differences in density in this type of
thin, usually pretty dry, plywood. Also look for a sticker on the
sheets that say &quot;TYPE III&quot;. It will at least be made with water
resistant adhesive. If you are going to use other than marine, this
stuff, in my opinion, and as available in my area, is much better than
pine or fur for boats. I actually have a couple of sheets put away for
a special project that came with a wild grain and was probably some
other &quot;filler&quot; wood that was used in manufacture. Maybe an end sheet
or something, but it is beautiful. I may make a small kayak or skiff
out of it, the kayak would show off the grain better.

I should add a reference to a more complex one sheeter recently
described at
www.duckworksmagazine.com . Scroll down to the two articles on &quot;Baby
Canoe&quot;. I think there's enough detail for construction. It's more like
building a bigger boat than any one sheeter I've seen so far.

Also, it's a good idea to make a cardboard model or two before
beginning to build a small boat full size.

Well, take a look at this dinghy: www.customware.nl/boats
It is entirely glued together. Not a singe screw and even the skeg (20mm)
wide is simply glued to the keel.

I once did a test: everone keeps telling me that oak doesn't glue well with
epoxy so this was a good starting point for my experiment. I sanded the oak
with grit 40 across the grain, applied some epoxy and let it cure without
clamping.

Next day I drove a 3/16&quot; nail straight through the seam, trying to break the
epoxy. It didn't. the wood around the nail gave up eventually.

&gt;&gt; Of course it is your boat and you should build it the way you think

&gt;&gt; would be comments all over the net.

&gt; I agree. I'm not questioning the method so much as questioning
&gt;my own knowledge of what works and what doesn't. I grew up in an
&gt;environment where tradesmen were never called, we figured out and
&gt;fixed /everything/ ourselves, be it plumbing, home extensions,

&gt; On PVA type glues, I'm very much aware (and continually

&gt; Thanks, I appreciate your comments.

Try the epoxy before you ignore it.

Make a 90 degree butt joint with 1/4 inch plywood and glue it with
epoxy. Mix up some epoxy and some sort of filler, sanding dust from
the same kind of wood you are glueing works fine, and form a fillet
approximately 1/2 inch wide on the inside of the 90 degree joint, Then
wet out a 4 inch wide piece of glass tape with epoxy and place that
over the fillet. Roll out any bubbles and let it harden for 48 hours
and then try to break it. Twist it, pry it, whatever you want, and
you'll find that the plywood fails long before you can break the joint
itself.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm not sure how you plan on building this boat but for a small
&gt;&gt;&gt; dinghy I'd use the &quot;stitch and glue&quot; method where you cut the
&gt;&gt;&gt; various panels to size and tie them together with wire, cable
&gt;&gt;&gt; ties, strong string, whatever, and then smear glue in the joints.

&gt;&gt;  I'd looked at similar approaches used on various web pages and
&gt;&gt; was concerned that the method didn't look nearly strong enough.
&gt;&gt; The design I had in mind was flat bottomed, (see the url below)
&gt;&gt; and I had planned on perhaps going beyond the reccomended jointing
&gt;&gt; methods screwing the bottom and sides to a piece of wood of
&gt;&gt; about 1in x 1in for the length of each join. Is that overkill?

&gt;It is both overkill and a nuisance.  A nuisance because it creates
&gt;more surfaces to sand and finish but primarily because those surfaces
&gt;also catch and hold water (and dirt) and water encourages rot.
&gt;____________________

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are interested in a really good small dinghy do a web search
&gt;&gt;&gt; for a &quot;D4&quot; dinghy. The plans are free and the guy's web site has a
&gt;&gt;&gt; wealth of information on building boats.

&gt;&gt;  That D4 does look like a very nice little boat. A bit more advanced
&gt;&gt; than what I had in mind though. Something like this:

&gt;It doesn't take that much more work and would be very little more
&gt;difficult if you made it for rowing only.  The author of the one you
&gt;linked made a good point about a single lengthwise seat; it would need
&gt;more than one position for oarlocks.

&gt;Regardless of which you make, if you use &quot;glue and stitch&quot; practice
&gt;making the thickened epoxy fillets so that you can make them neatly
&gt;and uniformly - you'll save a ton of sanding.  IMO, the easiest tool
&gt;to apply them is a sphere...possibly a rubber ball.  Foam cylinders
&gt;work well too...I bought one of the foam pool toys...a cylinder about
&gt;2 1/2&quot; in diameter and maybe four feet long.  Cut off a piece about 2&quot;
&gt;wide, apply/fair epoxy putty, throw away.

&gt;Also, do the gunnels well...they really stiffen everything up.
">

A trick I learned from a guy who does it every day is to grind a
radius on one corner of a putty-knife. He had several in different
sizes and radius. With the metal blade he could pretty well scrape all
the excess filler off the panels leaving only the fillet and then,
before the filler had hardened he taped over the fillet and rolled it
out. It takes a bit of practice but cuts out all the sanding of the
fillets.

Bruce, you've been most helpful, so I'll add a tip of my own.

I've learned to mask off the area to be taped.

Make the area a touch larger than the width of the glass tape to be
used.  You don't want the glass laying over teh mask!
Duct tape works fine as epoxy will not stick to it.

Then lay in the filet and glass tape and epoxy.

This makes for very neat seams with little clean up required.

Well, it works for me, anyway!

Most guys in the business do exactly the same thing anytime they are
using something that can make a mess. If you are putting in ports with
sikaflex, for example, Mask around the area the sika will contact,
maybe leave a very tiny gap. Then after you set the port and the seka
just starts to harden you strip off the tape and you are left with
almost no clean-up at all.
Great stuff, masking tape.

Forgive this if it is a repost, I have had some posting problems
lately so I am trying again.

For spreading and shaping resin, find some old leather. I have an old
piece of striking leather from the cotton mill down Huntsville Ala,
during my travelin' days;) Anyway, the stuff is about 1/4 inch thick
and smooth on one side, very stiff. I cut squares and two or three
different radius on the corners, one at a nice 90. I use them to
spread, and smooth glass and resin.

Another way to make taping seams easier is to put 80% of the resin for
a seam down before the cloth. Lay down your wet cloth, and use the
rest of the pot to lay on top. It is much easier to push cloth into
wet resin than to push resin into dry (white) cloth. In most cases,
putting wet cloth, onto wet surface will make your life much easier;)

For tighter work or where you need to pass through limbers and such,
or where I want no or little run off, I have a piece of formica
counter top I use to pre-soak the cloth, squeegee it to taste, fold it
up, and lay it out wet on wet. Formica cleans up easy with a rag and
thinner. If you don't have a chunk of formica you can also lay out and
tape or staple down wax paper.
