'Yakety Sax' Man Boots Randolph Dies
Biggest Hit Used on 'Benny Hill Show'; Played With Presley, Orbison
By JOE EDWARDS, AP

NASHVILLE (July 3) - Boots Randolph, a saxophone player best known for
the 1963 hit &quot;Yakety Sax,&quot; died Tuesday. He was 80.

Randolph suffered a cerebral hemorrhage June 25 and had been
hospitalized in a coma. He was taken off a respirator earlier Tuesday,
said Betty Hofer, a publicist and spokeswoman for the family.

Randolph played regularly in Nashville nightclubs for 30 years, becoming
a tourist draw for the city much like Wayne Newton in Las Vegas and Pete
Fountain in New Orleans.

AP Boots Randolph, July 3: The respected saxophone session man, whose
frantic hit 'Yakety Sax' became the theme song for Benny Hill's TV show,
died after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. The Kentucky native was 80.
&lt; Previous 1 of 20 Next &gt;
He recorded more than 40 albums and spent 15 years touring with the
Festival of Music, teaming with fellow instrumentalists Chet Atkins and
Floyd Cramer.

As a session musician, he played on Elvis Presley's &quot;Return to Sender,&quot;
Roy Orbison's &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman,&quot; Brenda Lee's &quot;Rockin' Round the
Christmas Tree&quot; and &quot;I'm Sorry,&quot; REO Speedwagon's &quot;Little Queenie,&quot; Al
Hirt's &quot;Java&quot; and other songs including ones by Buddy Holly and Johnny Cash.

He had his biggest solo hit with &quot;Yakety Sax,&quot; which he wrote.

&quot;'Yakety Sax' will be my trademark,&quot; Randolph said in a 1990 interview
with The Associated Press. &quot;I'll hang my hat on it. It's kept me alive.
Every sax player in the world has tried to play it. Some are good, some
are awful.&quot;

&quot;Yakety Sax&quot; was used on the TV program &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; more than
two decades after the tune was on the charts.

&quot;It rejuvenated the song,&quot; Randolph said in 1990. &quot;So many people know
it from the show.&quot;

He also was part of the Million Dollar Band on the TV show &quot;Hee Haw.&quot;

Randolph was born Homer Louis Randolph in Paducah, Ky., and grew up in
the rural community of Cadiz, Ky., where he learned to play music with
his family's band.

He said he didn't know where or why he got the nickname &quot;Boots,&quot;
although his Web site at the time of his death suggested it was to avoid
confusion because he and his father shared the same first name.

Randolph began playing the ukulele and then the trombone, but switched
to the tenor sax when his father unexpectedly brought one home.

He graduated from high school in Evansville, Ind., then joined the Army
and became a member of the Army Band.

After his discharge, he played primarily jazz at nightclubs for $60 a
week. He finally landed a recording contract with RCA in Nashville in
1958 and also was hired as a musician for recording sessions.

Randolph had his own nightclub in Nashville's Printer's Alley for 17
years, closing it in 1994 because of declining business and to spend
more time with his family.

He played regularly at other nightclubs before and after that. He had
lived in Nashville since 1961.

Randolph charted 13 albums on the pop charts from 1963 to 1972. His
other single hits included &quot;Hey, Mr. Sax Man&quot; in 1964 and &quot;Temptation&quot;
in 1967.

&quot;Every time I pick the horn up, it's more intriguing to me,&quot; he said in
1990. &quot;It satisfies my desire to do whatever I do.&quot;

&quot;I think I probably get better because I work so much,&quot; he said at the
time. &quot;You get to a point where you can be lackadaisical or nonchalant.
But I'm not like that. I worry if I play a tune bad or my horn is not
working right.&quot;

Survivors include his wife, a son, a daughter and four grandchildren.
