I have always used Hafler DH-500's for all my live audio needs and love them
to death.  I have been looking at the Hafler P7000 amps and was wondering if
anyone has any feedback on them that they would like to share.  They will be
used to power my Cerwin Vega speakers models B-36A subs, V-37D tops and G-15
tops.

They are excellent, but they do have a different sound; dry, analytical, but
without bipolar harshness. They use the Transnova circuit designed by Jim
Strickland. I have XL series Hafler amps, and I'm very fond of them as well.

I prefer the Transnova type amps, such as the P7000, for speakers with
soft-dome tweeters. For hard dome speakers, I prefer the DH/XL series.

They are fairly clean sounding amplifiers, and are pretty solid.  They're
certainly far better than the Cerwin Vegas deserve.  I don't think you will
do better at the price unless you're willing to forgo stuff like balanced
inputs.

If you drive the left and right channels off a differential balanced output
from a loudspeaker manager/crossover, the DH-500 becomes a balanced, bridge
mono amplifier. That's how I run mine, for driving midrange/tweets.

Now when you do that, do you only use the positive terminals of the speaker
connections?
