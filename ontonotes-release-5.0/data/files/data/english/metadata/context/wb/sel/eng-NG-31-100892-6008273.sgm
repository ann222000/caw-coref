when it began as a process has always been unclear

the idea of a transfer economy
abstracted to value as a decoupling
allowing new purchase arrangments
seems to require a certain velocity of trade

trade-barter only loses its advantage (simplicity)
when the possession of abstracted value
has real benefit to the entity

choice is one benefit
allowing more options optimises benefit

and having a choice of what to purchase
requires enough velocity of trade to supply those options

an analysis of this leads
to the cognitive linguistic origins of value

-+-+-

economic process transcends death

value is not only individual
it is a process of material transfer that provides value to individuals
but may exist for hundreds of years in standing forms

forms are our sense of value
they are the abstraction calculus of our benefits

the forms of value are various yet generally partial-orders
food to provide our energy
and benefit our health
tools to allow our completion of goals
and benefit our satisfaction
medicine to cure our real or invented ailments
and benefit our hedonism
..

cognitive symbols of value

*******^..

can money be decoupled from peano arithmetic?

as long as it has a fundamental unit
any ring would provide the manipulations we regularly perform
and multiplication probably does not explicitly need a specification

all transaction are basic exchanges of value
and the abelian addition (/subtraction) still account

a very simple model of value
can constructively form many complex evolutionary symbols

is it possible to have inconvertible forms of value?
" 25 medicine tokens and only 7 food? "
abstract units
" a^2 b^3 soylents or b^7 c^2 ( = a^9 d ) mazdas? "

..^*******

many modern theories of value accept
the marginal utility measure of benefit

the diamondWater paradox of value
is that water is more health-providing to one than diamonds

health is form
it is complexity and information
in the dynamics of our local thermodynamic cascade

i saw this piece of propaganda the other day
(gasoline foetus salvation 2007):

" There is revolution in the air, tonight.  A restlessness
in the body politic that things may have passed a trigger
point.  Everyone knows there are trigger points.  We see
them all the time in third-world countries.  America
itself is a consequence of such a trigger point.

Last year showed a definite swing of disfavor.
Republicans have turned against their own systems in
disgust.  Elections illuminated a change in public
favor quite dramatic for a government that feels it
has justification for its actions.

Where has the justification gone in public sentiment?
A series of revelations between 2004 and 2006 challenged
public notions of righteous governance.  Domestic spying,
extraordinary renditions, activities that sickened a
country that is strongly desirous of being on the
'right team'.

Among the indications that the point were Americans
believe the system is too corrupt to be maintained and
must be changed in a meaningful way, there is the
surprising rise in popularity of the Antiamerican party.
Originally a core of anarchists from southern Nevada,
the Antiamerican party has found resonance in spontaneous
college collectives.  At Dartmouth recently, a group
of twelve Antiamerican demonstrators were passing out
buttons with the slogan "Fundamentalism Kills" over
a backdrop of the world trade center with the first
tower collapsing.

The Antiamerican movement has grown tremendously since
the publication of their "Antiamerican Manifesto" where
they laid out the planks of their political movement.
Although the Antiamericans have been credited by some
for parts of the strength of the national turn last year,
it should be pointed out that their manifesto was not
published until after the elections and before that
their movement mostly isolated to Nevada.

Other revolutionary movements have also been making
some prominent moves in the national body politic.
The Malachite Nation is a Green oriented revolutionary
front from Montana that is asking for a redesign of
national law around the notion of a healthy environment.
Ebony Liberation is Northern Washington group with
similar positions and have been particularly forceful in
the cause of deforestation.

But a real analysis I think will show these groups are
more a symptom than a cause of the swing in public
opinion.  The cause for the swing in public opinion
are the actions of the current american government, and
if they cannot rectify the damage currently perceived,
the revolutionary movements will likely continue to
grow. "

the integration of the subjective theory of value
with modern theories of cognition
show the discursive origin of linguistic symbology

the computational ability to grow structures
of value production in the economy
feeding the energy transport structures of modern society
the materials and services

are the fundamental units of business theory

poor richard once said:
" He that spends a groat a day idly spends idly
above six pounds a year, which is the price for
the use of one hundred pounds. "

idle spending is waste

the customer theory of business value
is foundational to all lean business process models
and a consequence of the subjective theory of value

taiichi ohno formalised the many wisdoms of economy
and formalised the lean principles of waste control

but the principles have been guiding business evolution for years
these are the thermodynamic origins of the industrial revolution
the transportation revolution
the information revolution
the optimisation revolution

the revolution is now

I might be misunderstanding you here.

It seems to me that cost can be, and most often is, derived from value.

Example:  Long lasting relief is a valuable quality for a pain
medication to have. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that a pain
medication with long long lasting relief formula should be more costly
than short lasting relief formula of the same brand.

It can usually be said that something cost more because it is (or is
proposed to be) more valuable.
What else would cost be derived from?

Also, value can be derived from cost. In fact, some people tend to
value things based on cost alone.

Example: 'Look at my shoes. Aren't they nice? They cost me $300.00'

Smoking doesn't produce pleasure. Dying from asphyxia because
regardless of how deeply you inhale you can't get oxygen through your
now dead alveoli, is not pleasure. In fact, its pretty much the
opposite of pleasure. The people you are refering to are not making a
decision of pleasure over death anyhow, they are addicted. Pure and

First, there are two senses of "cost" involved here. The sense you seem to
have in mind is "price." The price of the long-lasting pill is a function of
its relative value to the consumer (vs. the short-term pill), its production
cost (the second sense), and the competitive enviroment (how many other
manufacturers of that product are competing for the consumer's dollar). The
pill will not be produced unless at least some consumers value it highly
enough to cover the production costs of the quantity those consumers demand.
But if the market is competitive, the consumers will get a bargain: they will
pay less for it than they would be willing to pay. On the other hand, if the
subjective value is much higher than production costs, and there is no
competition, the manufacturer will reap large profits. He will charge "what
the traffic will bear."

There is also a third sense of "cost": opportunity cost, or subjective cost.
The consumer who buys the pill thereby gives up various other things he might
have bought with that money. The value of the most valuable thing he would be
willing to give up to obtain the pill is the opportunity cost (subjective
cost) for that consumer.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

Subjective value is part of the equation, but so are manufacturing costs and
the competitive environment. Those are the other variables I mentioned.

Wrong. I smoked two packs a day for 14 years and I loved every minute of
it. But the fear of death made me stop. And yes, I know perfectly well
what the physical effects were. My guess is that you never smoked so you
don't know what a pleasure it is.

Smoking and "dying from asphyxia" are not equivalent. The claim was that
*smoking* yields pleasure, not that "dying of asphyxia" does. Smoking entails
some *risk* of dying from asphyxia, just as driving an automobile entails
some risk of being decapitated. But we weigh the expected benefits against
the expected costs (risks).

And your claim that "smoking doesn't produce pleasure" is misguided for two
reasons. First, what is and is not pleasurable is a purely subjective matter.
So if a given person claims that smoking gives him pleasure, and acts as
though it does (devotes time and other resources to that pursuit), then it
*does* give him pleasure. He can't be contradicted or second-guessed.

Secondly, there is a good biological explanation for the appeal of smoking.
Cells of neural and even muscle tissue contain *nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors* --- sites on the cell membrane which respond to the
neurotransmitter acetylcholine. The nicotinic receptors are potentiated, or
activiated, by nicotine, among other compounds. That means that in the
presence of nicotine those receptors work more efficiently. Nicotine is a
kind of "brain lubricant." Smokers will tell you that smoking helps them
think more clearly, or focus. The evidence indicates they're right.

Iv'e smoked most of my life, and like you, quit. Only difference is
that I quit because it made me feel like shit and was expensive. I say
there is no pleasure in it because even though I crave cigarrettes to
this day, I am aware that I really do not want them or I would not have
quit in the first place. The feeling of craving is addiction, which
attempts to contradict my reasoning that I arrived at through sound
deliberation. To succumb to that craving would be the equivalent of
scratching an itch.

I suppose that scratching an itch can be considered pleasurable, but
you simply wouldn't do it if there was a high probability that
scratching the itch would end your life. You'd be more likely to ignore
it and let it go away, even though this would be less immediately
gratifying.

I agree with you here. Pleasure is subjective. In fact, addictive
things can be pleasurable things. But pleasure can not be the sole

&gt; Secondly, there is a good biological explanation for the appeal of smoking.
&gt; Cells of neural and even muscle tissue contain *nicotinic acetylcholine

&gt; activiated, by nicotine, among other compounds.

Its a great biological explanation, one that cigarette manufacturers
exploit daily. It is also the reason a person has such a hard time
quitting smoking. Literally every single cell in your body becomes
addicted. Its quite amazing.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; That means that in the

Sure can. It is an understatement because Smoking does not entail
'some' risk of emphysema, it entails a complete 'risk' of emphysema. If

the driving. In this sense driving a car in absence of all other
factors will never cause decapitation. Smoking can, in absence of all
other factors cause emphysema.

That is true. Nicotine (or substitutes with the same subjective effects)

I'm not sure you understand risk. Risk is the product of the probability of
a certain event, times the subjective cost of that event. It is a numerical
magnitude. I have no idea what you mean by "complete risk," unless that 100%
of smokers will develop fatal emphysema. And of course that is false. About
10% of smokers develop emphysema, and most of those are non-fatal. Other

I'm not sure I follow this. Define 'means goods' in this context.

Please explain this in more depth. Breathing is necessary to life
regardless of weather or not you value it. If you don't breath, you
die. Without breathing, a human being cannot live. The same cannot be
said for smoking. A human being can, in fact, live without smoking.

An addiction is a chronic disorder. It is characterized by repeated use
of a substance despite the fact that the substance is bad for you. Not
bad in a subjective way, but bad in a clinical way.

It is pretty clear that breathing is not, in any way, an addiction.

you have asked elsewhere for models of meaning

theories of the meaning of money

take just this form

Not true. There are people who smoke and do not get emphysema. And there
are people who get emphysema and do not smoke. There is no definite

Here is a general epistemological point: Cause effect relations are
rarely one to one. It usually requires several conditions to hold to

Well, it's worse than that. For some people, smoking does *not* cause
emphysema - at least the debilitating type. And decapitation is 100%
fatal - a severed spinal cord is equivalent to decapitation
for purposes of this discussion.

And this:

http://www.straightdope.com/columns/060421.html

does not place the Peto studies in very good stead. The state
of the art is differential cancer rates - which do not prove
what people want them to prove.

And I quote: "...smoking-death projections are inherently soft and won't
ever be confirmed in a rigorous way."

SO much for facts being useful in this discussion. They

The bottom line is that it is common knowledge that smoking *can* kill
you from heart disease, cancer and emphysema. In addition, it costs an
arm and a leg. Anyone who weighs the cost of smoking, both physically
and monitarilly, and chooses to smoke anyhow is making a bad decision.
Most smokers will admit this.

Lets look at some facts shall we:

-People start smoking between 13-18 years old, virtually no one starts
smoking after age 20.
-The most common reasons for starting to smoke are image projection,
peer acceptance, it makes   you feel like an adult and rebellion.
-People continue to smoke past 20, even though they would have never
started smoking as an adult, because they become addicted.
-Half of long term smokers will die from tobacco use, and smoking is
the most preventable cause of premature death
-3/4 of the worlds bronchitis and 1/4 of all deaths from heart disease
are from smoking

And then I ask, what do you get from smoking? Pleasure? Please. Your an
addict, and as soon as your honest with yourself about this, you'll
quit because there is no good reason to smoke. We can argue about the
subjective nature of pleasure or be empiricaly skeptical of statistics
and cause and effect all day long, but when all is said and done, its
pretty common knowledge that smoking is dumb.

Human's do dumb things some times even though they know they are dumb.
It is part of being a person. Doing *dumb* things once in a while does
not, incidentally, make you dumb. What makes you dumb is the inability
to recognize that what your doing is dumb.

No it isn't. It is smoking plus something(s) else.

If the predicted effect does no occur, the hypothesis concerning the

Yes. It is true that with some people smoking will lead to ill health.
But it is NOT true that will ALL people smoking will lead to ill health.
Conclusion: smoking is not a sufficient cause for illness such as lung
cancer and emphysema. This is clearly indicated in the case of people
who get emphysema and who never smoked or were exposed to tobacco smoke.
Emphysema was a disease noted by the ancient Greeks (hence the greek
name for the disease). The Greeks never had smoking or tobacco. Yet the
disease occured. Why do you suppose that is, if smoking is the cause of
emphysema. Obviously there are other causes for the disease and smoking
is not even sufficient to cause the disease.

I happen to agree with you that smoking does not make one healthier and
in some case may make one sick. That is why I have not smoked a single
cigarette since 1962. I found that smoking irrated my bronchial passages
and made me more likely to get bronchitis. So I stopped. It wasn't easy,
but the problems with chronic bronchitis outweighed the pleasure.

On the other hand there are people who smoke and never have a sick day.
Lucky them. Go figure.

Actual decapitation adds bleeding out, but death
by hanging is *defacto* decpitation - the subject
stops breathing very quickly. Cause of death in either
is much the same, in the eyes of a coroner - brain
starvation. The British adopted hanging because it
was more demure and less show-bidness than the gore-fest
of beheading... much more in tune with the gravitas
required of such a solemn duty.

It might. If you consider that we live in a social climate pushing for

They didn't *just* increase nicotine, they increased free form
nicotine. In addition, they manipulated the chemistry of the cigarettes
so that the nicotine was faster absorbing and faster dissipating. This
means that smokers do not need fewer cigarettes, they need more because
the drug hit them quicker and wears off quicker.

Solution is trivial. Do away with "socialized medicine". All health care
has to be paid out of pocket or insurance premiums have to be hiked for
people who smoke or who are overweight. The premium should be

&gt;&gt; That is true. Nicotine (or substitutes with the same subjective
&gt;&gt; effects) could be delivered by less harmful means. There are other
&gt;&gt; benefits to smoking, however, which might be harder to replace, i.e.,
&gt;&gt; tobacco flavors, aromas, etc. (especially important to pipe and cigar
&gt;&gt; smokers). *Most smokers (80-90%) do not die from any smoking-related
&gt;&gt; cause*.
&gt; I'd like for you to cite your source here.

That would be hard to do. Absolute mortality rates for smoking are very
hard to come by. What you find are relative rates, which tend to be much
scarier. The anti-smoking fascists are not eager to publicize the absolute
rates, lest it undermine their propaganda campaign. So you have to extract
the absolute rates for various conditions in which smoking is a factor,
and do the calcs yourself.

For example, you find the relative rate that you are 23 times more likely
to die from lung cancer if you are a current smoker:

http://www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/content/PED_10_X_Smoking_and_Cancer...

From absolute mortality tables you find that lung cancer is responsible
for about 65 deaths per 100,000 per year. There are a total of 842 deaths
per 100,000:

http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/dvs/lcwk9_2003.pdf

So lung cancer is responsible for 7.7% of all deaths. Of those, about 88%
are smoking-related. So the death rate from smoking (from lung cancer) is
about 6.7%. In other words, if you are a smoker, the odds you will die
from lung cancer are about 6.7% --- which is about 23 times as high as it
would be for a non-smoker.

The rates for heart disease are more problematic, because heart disease is
ubiquitous whether you are a smoker or not. Unless something else gets you
first, you will die of heart disease. According to one study, about 30% of
heart disease is due to smoking. Per CDC, heart disease claims 236 people
per 100,000 per year. If 30% are due to smoking, then we have 71 deaths
per year, or 8.4% of all deaths. We have to take that 30% figure with a
grain of salt, though --- it is impossible to separate smoking from all
the other risk factors. If the smokers had never smoked heart disease
would have killed many of them anyway.

http://thescooponsmoking.org/xhtml/effects/heartAttacks.php

Smoking is also implicated in other diseases, but at much lower rates. So
altogether you have a death rate from smoking of between 10-20% of all
deaths among smokers.

Another way to view the risks is in terms of "Years of Potential Life
Lost." Those estimates range from 6 to 14 years per smoker. Assume 10
years to be a good figure:

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/200...

That would mean the smoker is trading 10 future years of life for the
current pleasures of smoking, whatever those may be for him. How valuable

those are the years at the end of his life, where he will very likely
suffer several of numerous debilitating conditions --- diabetes,
arthritis, heart disease (which he will likely have in old age whether a
smoker or not), Alzheimer's Disease, various other cognitive impairments,
kidney disease, numerous other cancers, and even erectile dysfunction. So
he is trading some low-value years in the future for a more satisfying
life in the present.

The secondhand smoke case an interesting case. Numerous studies had been done

&gt; money is an example of how meaning

That is an uncommon insight. But money is not unique. All language learning
occurs through the same process. And I agree that how those things are
learned by a social group may serve as a model of how neural networks learn.
But the meaning of money depends on some pre-existing concepts, and also on
some contingent social structures. When devising a (verbal, conceptual)
*theory* of money, we will need to posit some of those parameters *a
priori*.

Likewise, when trying to explain how neural networks process information,
we'll need to posit some structural parameters for that network *a priori*.

&gt; health is form
&gt;   it is complexity and information
&gt;   in the dynamics of our local thermodynamic cascade

&gt; i saw this piece of propaganda the other day
&gt; (gasoline foetus salvation 2007):

&gt;   &quot; There is revolution in the air, tonight.  A restlessness
&gt;     in the body politic that things may have passed a trigger
&gt;     point.  Everyone knows there are trigger points.  We see
&gt;     them all the time in third-world countries.  America
&gt;     itself is a consequence of such a trigger point.

&gt;     Last year showed a definite swing of disfavor.
&gt;     Republicans have turned against their own systems in
&gt;     disgust.  Elections illuminated a change in public
&gt;     favor quite dramatic for a government that feels it
&gt;     has justification for its actions.

&gt;     Where has the justification gone in public sentiment?
&gt;     A series of revelations between 2004 and 2006 challenged
&gt;     public notions of righteous governance.  Domestic spying,
&gt;     extraordinary renditions, activities that sickened a
&gt;     country that is strongly desirous of being on the
&gt;     'right team'.

&gt;     Among the indications that the point were Americans
&gt;     believe the system is too corrupt to be maintained and
&gt;     must be changed in a meaningful way, there is the
&gt;     surprising rise in popularity of the Antiamerican party.
&gt;     Originally a core of anarchists from southern Nevada,
&gt;     the Antiamerican party has found resonance in spontaneous
&gt;     college collectives.  At Dartmouth recently, a group
&gt;     of twelve Antiamerican demonstrators were passing out
&gt;     buttons with the slogan &quot;Fundamentalism Kills&quot; over
&gt;     a backdrop of the world trade center with the first
&gt;     tower collapsing.

&gt;     The Antiamerican movement has grown tremendously since
&gt;     the publication of their &quot;Antiamerican Manifesto&quot; where
&gt;     they laid out the planks of their political movement.
&gt;     Although the Antiamericans have been credited by some
&gt;     for parts of the strength of the national turn last year,
&gt;     it should be pointed out that their manifesto was not
&gt;     published until after the elections and before that
&gt;     their movement mostly isolated to Nevada.

&gt;     Other revolutionary movements have also been making
&gt;     some prominent moves in the national body politic.
&gt;     The Malachite Nation is a Green oriented revolutionary
&gt;     front from Montana that is asking for a redesign of
&gt;     national law around the notion of a healthy environment.
&gt;     Ebony Liberation is Northern Washington group with
&gt;     similar positions and have been particularly forceful in
&gt;     the cause of deforestation.

&gt;     But a real analysis I think will show these groups are
&gt;     more a symptom than a cause of the swing in public
&gt;     opinion.  The cause for the swing in public opinion
&gt;     are the actions of the current american government, and
&gt;     if they cannot rectify the damage currently perceived,
&gt;     the revolutionary movements will likely continue to
&gt;     grow. &quot;

&gt; the integration of the subjective theory of value

&gt; the computational ability to grow structures
&gt;   of value production in the economy
&gt; feeding the energy transport structures of modern society
&gt; the materials and services

&gt;   are the fundamental units of business theory

&gt; poor richard once said:
&gt;   &quot; He that spends a groat a day idly spends idly
&gt;     above six pounds a year, which is the price for
&gt;     the use of one hundred pounds. &quot;

&gt; idle spending is waste

&gt; the customer theory of business value
&gt;   is foundational to all lean business process models
&gt;   and a consequence of the subjective theory of value

&gt; taiichi ohno formalised the many wisdoms of economy
&gt;   and formalised the lean principles of waste control

&gt; but the principles have been guiding business evolution for years
&gt; these are the thermodynamic origins of the industrial revolution
&gt;   the transportation revolution
&gt;   the information revolution
&gt;   the optimisation revolution

&gt; the revolution is now
">

Since the end of the cold war, economy has been encroaching on the
totality of human activities to the point where nothing is considered
to make sense anymore, if it cannot be quantified in terms of
currency. Even power, which used to be ultimate goal of struggle
according to the more aggressive and dominating members of humanity,
has become but another commodity. There is nothing mysterious or
complicated about value anymore, value is a number attached to a
currency symbol, everything has got a price tag on it, and those
things which are scarce go to the one who places the larger heap of
bills on the counter. Let us not further waste our lives and
intellects discussing the fine points, intellectually appealing as
they might be, of this monstrosity we have surrendered ourselves to.
If the revolution is now, then it's time to bury the economy.

&gt; Solution is trivial. Do away with &quot;socialized medicine&quot;. All health

In order to call something a contributing factor there must be

You probably wouldn't have to sue in order to present this evidence,
