I was wondering if anyone has any advice on restoring the gloss to a
mahogany table that has a french polish. I want to add sheen to it
without resorting to stripping (arghh!). I also want to avoid any kind
of polyurethane type products, basically something that's reversable.

Any advice or help would be appreciated!

"/> Scott, I think I've seen the guys on &quot;Furniture on the Mend&quot; mention
ways to restore gloss to this type of thing. If I recall correctly,
what they did is soak *something* (god, I wish I could recall *what*) in
some cloth and then kind of buffing the surface very lightly with it. I
think if you look at the PBS home page there might be a link to their
homepage, and they might say there or you could send them an email.
They used it primarily for restoring scratches but it would probably
work for an all over finish.

sorry I can't remember better - when I moved 2 years ago I lost TLC
which had their show all the time &lt;sniff&gt;.

Hi,
After cleaning with fine steel wool and paint thinner, to remove wax and
other crud, you can repolish the top, with shellac, and get the gloss back.
If there is enough finish remaining, you can simply re-wax it. Briwax is
good for this.

I am quoting from The Complete Book of Furniture Repair and Refinishing -
Ralph Parsons Kinney
&quot;Thin shellac with alcohol to the consistency of water and apply with an old
nylon stocking made into a ball, squeezing out a little of the material at a
time.

Dip the pad in the shellac solution and apply with straight strokes. As
soon as it's dry, continue to apply more coats until a sheen or gloss is
acquired. If cracks appear on the surface, sprinkle on a little pumice
stone and rub. Then apply more coats of the shellac until the cracks are
filled.

Allow time for the surface to dry completely. Then put onlly a few drops of
raw linseed oil on the pad, and rub with a circular motion over the entire
area, adding a few more drops of the oil as needed. When a high polish is
seen, add no more oil,. but coninue rubbing until the surface is thoroughly
dry. Allow to stand overnight, and repeat the rubbing with the oil.&quot;

Hope this is what you wanted.

I saw on television just last night how important a finish can be. On one
of those shows where they have appraisers access items brought in by people.
There was a couple who had an old cherry highboy that her brother had given
them 50 years ago. As they didn't like the dark, nearly black finish on the
cherry wood, they had it refinished. Apparently, this piece was from the
18th century. They appeared very upset when the appraiser told them it made
a difference between the piece being worth $30,000 instead of nearly
$250,000 because the collectors of this style of furniture preferred the
original dark finish. While I don't think I'll ever see a piece worth that
much, it almost scares me away from refinishing.

I would start by using a rag and mineral spirits to remove old wax.
Then examine the top for scratches and other disfigurements. Realize
that you will not remove all the marks. Next you an use mineral
spirits and #0000 steel wool to abrade the top layer of finish off
then use a buffer and fine polishing compound. Or, skip the wool and
go right to the buffing stage. Lastly use a paste wax.

Chances are that is all you will have to do.

putting linseed oil over an original finish is not a good practice.
linseed oil crosslinks and becomes impossible to remove without
damaging the underlying coating. in addition, it will darken over
time. true, it was used in the past, only because it was cheap and
readily available.

when french polishing, which is what was described here, oil is used
only to lubricate the pad and should be removed before the next
coating.
