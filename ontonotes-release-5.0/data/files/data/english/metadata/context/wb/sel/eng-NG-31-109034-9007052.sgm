If The Germans  followed the Schlieffen Plan winning the First Battle
of the Marne and then take Paris, it is likely that WWI would have
swiftly ended like the short Franco-Prussian War of 1870 thereby
saving a generation that was lost in the futile trench warfare of OTL
and preserving the old order.  The peaceful and optimistic Edwardian
Era would have continued.  It is likely that Tsarist Russia would have
evolved peacefully and consequnetly no Communist takeover.  There
would be no Nazi movement in Germany, no breakuop of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire and all that followed from that disaster, no
Great Depression which was largely caused by the effects of WWI and
protectionist trade policies, and no WWII saving millions more lives
and countless treasures.

Austria-Hungary was doomed; it was decaying internally, as was the
Ottoman Empire. Russia needed more refroms faster than Nicholas II could
provide them (I do wonder how history would have turned out if Lenin had
been assassinated while living in Geneva, though...)

To begin with, there was no &quot;Schlieffen Plan&quot;,
only a &quot;Schlieffen Proposal&quot;. Schlieffen never
worked out the details of it.

Second, the Schlieffen Proposal called for a
much larger army than Germany actually had in
1914.

Third, Schlieffen called for the German march
to pass through the Netherlands as well as
Belgium. This would have guaranteed British
intervention.

Fourth, the invasion of the Netherlands
might not have gone well. The Dutch army
mobilized in 1914, a few days before
Germany. Apparently part of the telegraph
system in western Germany was operated by
a company with mixed German and Dutch
ownership. The Dutch owners cooperated
with the Dutch intelligence service and
placed agents at the main exchange in
Germany; these agents saw messages clearly
indicating that Germany was going to war,
and alerted the Dutch government.

Fifth, to assemble the required forces
in the west, Schlieffen's proposal
stripped the east of all but a skeleton
defense force. There could be no
Tannenberg. The German offensive in
France has to win completely, and
quickly, because by the end of August
the Russians will have Konigsberg and
Danzig under siege, and be moving
toward the Oder with little to stop
them.

The Germans sent four army corps east to the Russian front in OTL
after the failure at Ypres. Their schedule, which had been thrown off
by the rapid Russian mobilization, would have been restored by a quick
Schlieffen Plan victory. The Russians would not have been able to
contain the Germans and by 1915 would have been in much worse shape
than they were in OTL 1915,.the Austrians could concentrate on their
Southern fronts.

The problem is the eternal bugbear of logistics and mobility. The

they had won a crashing victory there. Although feeding the troops was
doable (by a combination of living off the land and iron rations) the
German horses - both cavalry mounts and draught animals - were in a

with the supply columns lagging far behind the troops and desperate

Germans had, had broken down by the Marne.

I don't quite follow.

The Germans managed to _retreat_ all the way to the Aisne - about 50 miles
in places. Presumably if they and their horses could go that distance
northward they could (had the battle gone differently) have gone a
comparable distance south.

Had they done so, the _French_ would have started having logistical
problems, since the Germans would have been across the railway lines between
the capital and the eastern frontier of France - through which the French
armies in Lorraine were getting their supplies. And if those have to fall
back, the _German_ supply situation is much eased, as supplies can be sent
direct rather than via Belgium.

I quite agree the Germans won't get an instant KO, 1940-style. Things are
too &quot;slow motion&quot; for that, and there's plenty of space into which the
French can retreat. But I suspect they win in the end. It all sounds a lot
like 1870, with most of northern France in German hands and the French
hanging on as best they can in the Provinces. And if the Paris region goes,
most of France's remaining industry goes with it, so while the French may
hang on well into 1915, I find it hard to see how they win the war from that
position.

But _IF_ it gets to this point, situation becames really interesting:
France is out and this leaves Russia more or less alone against
Germany and A-H. On one hand, Russia is reasonably successful against
both: it occupies a big part of the Eastern Prussia and Galitsia
(IIRC, Brusilov took Lwowv by the time of OTL Tannenberg). OTOH, it
CAN NOT continue war with any chance for success because Germany alone
is quite obviously (I think that this was obvious even to Nicholas)
stronger military and economically.

Which brings a number of possibilities:

1. A speedy peace between Russia and Germany/A-H, probably along pre-
war borders, as soon as France gets out of war (and before Germany
reallocates necessary forces to the East).

2. Nicholas decides to fight alone (Brittish help on land can be
discounted). A _fast_ defeat of Russia. Depending on how fast this
defeat happens and the conditions of peace, it may or may not mean
revolution and overthrow of a monarchy. If defeat happens fast enough
and the peace conditions are relatively generous, than monarchy can
survive:
a. the war did not yet become a national disaster in the terms of
losses and economical hardships.
b. the earlier sucesses would allow at least some face saving and the
blame can be put on the allies.

If Nicholas decided to fight on in 1914-15 after the defeat of France
he would be openly inviting revolution either of the Bolshevik variety
or by the nobility in a similar manner to Rasputin's demise which was
historically the way the nobility dealt with Tsars who had obviously
lost it.

Nicholas was blind in many ways but not I think so blind as to refuse
to make terms on whatever was available at this point in the war.

There could be a 3rd option (as in OTL): a democratic revolution led
by non-Bolshevik parties.
The Bolsheviks were not (AFAIK) strong enough in 1915 to be a leading
political force.

In OTL the Provisional Goverment was doomed due to their stubborn
intention to keep fulfilling the obligations toward allies (aka, to
keep Russia in war). In OTL this led to the total deterrioration of
the Russian army, which gave the Bolsheviks an opening for their coup.
With no fighting allies there would be no reason to keep fighting.

This is my impression as well. The problem, within this scenario,
could be not with Nicholas but with his Cousin Willy. What if he
decided that there is a need for an impressive German victory and
refuses to negotiate until such a victory is achieved?

troops could start digging in on a line. All the front line troops had
to worry about was falling back. Very different from an advance

But the most important thing about Paris is that it's the centre of the
railway system for the whole northern half of France, and also iirc the main
industrial area that France has left after the loss of the Northeast. If the
Germans can sever the rail links between Paris and eastern France, it isn't
essential to _take_ it straight away. And if they can't be supplied where
they are, the French army will have to fall back.

But looking at a map of the front lines on September 5, it is very hard to
see how the French can hold Verdun if they have to retreat any further. That
was my point. If the Germans advance even slightly further, their logistics
get better and France's get worse.

I don't doubt they were hungry and tired, but that doesn't mean they can't
win. Iirc the Prussians who won Koniggratz hadn't eaten for two days. And
their morale is stiffened by the belief that they are within an ace of
victory.

I wonder what old Joffre would have said if told that there'd be people a
century later saying that his battle was unnecessary - that some logistical
&quot;Deus ex machina&quot; would have conveniently paralysed the Germans in any
event. I don't know the French for &quot;That ain't how things work&quot;, but suspect
that his response would have been along those lines. Certainly he was under
no such illusions himself. Iirc my Barbara Tuchman, when asked where there
next line would be if defeated on the Marne, he replied &quot;Nowhere&quot;. He knew
whatrt was at stake.

Why &quot;in trouble&quot;?

Even OTL, the Germans managed a big victory against Russia in May 1915.
Presumably they can still do so on this TL. That leaves the French holding
on in the south and west, and now with no hope of being saved by the
Russians.

Looking at the map, I'm not sure that works. From Germany to Paris,
there's no rail link: the right wheel of Schleiffen is largely

&gt; French holding on in the south and west, and now with no hope of being
&gt; saved by the Russians.
">

OTL in 1915 Germany was largely on the defensive in the West and on the
offensive in the East. In this time line there would probably have not
been a race to the sea meaning that more troops would be available for
counter attacks. Besides Russia was if anything getting stronger in 1915
with munitions supplied by England and reorganisation  of the army.
German planning could not anticipate a revolution and Germany is stuck
with the situation the whole plan was intended to avoid a war on two
fronts. Britain is still in the war with troop levels increasing rapidly.

&gt; &gt;problems, since the Germans would have been across the railway lines
between
&gt; &gt;the capital and the eastern frontier of France - through which the French
&gt; &gt;armies in Lorraine were getting their supplies. And if those have to fall
&gt; &gt;back, the _German_ supply situation is much eased, as supplies can be
sent
&gt; &gt;direct rather than via Belgium.

&gt; Looking at the map, I'm not sure that works. From Germany to Paris,
&gt; there's no rail link: the right wheel of Schleiffen is largely
&gt; predicated on the double-track line from Aix-le-Chapelle through Liege,
&gt; Brussels, Mons to Cambrai and then Saint-Quentin and Chauny: there was
&gt; no rail link crossing the Meuse. The supplies went through Belgium
&gt; because that was where the rail lines were.

You sure?

My old _Muir's Historical Atlas_ shows a rail line running
Metz-Conflans-Verdun-Chalons-Epernay-Chateau-Thierry-Meaux-Paris, most of
which was in German hands in early Sep 1914. Banks' _Military Atlas of the
First World War_ also shows a line running through Metz and Verdun, while
Corelli Barnett's _The Swordbearers_ includes a railway map of France which,
though annoyingly small scale, shows what appears to be the same line.

Obviously it wouldn't be much use as long as the French clung on to Verdun,
but at the time of the FBotM Verdun is already up at the end of a precarious
salient, and it's a bit difficult to see it holding if the Germans advance
any further.

I agree that German supplies were, so far, having to come through Belgium,
but was that purely a railway matter? As long as the French were holding on
from Verdun to Belfort, there were very few routes from Germany to France
_except_ via Belgium, either by rail or any other way. But it looks to me as
if that would become less true if the French had to retire any further.

You probably can't, immediately. But that is not essential. Your principal
objective is not Paris, but the French Army.

The real importance of Paris, apart from its sentimental value for the
French (it is, well - - - Paris) and prestige value for the Germans, is as a
railway junction - indeed _the_ main nexus of the rail lines of all Northern
France - in particular iro the railway lines supplying the French armies in
the east. If the Germans can sever those lines, taking the city itself would
be helpful, but in the short term at least, not vital.

Indeed, even if the Germans _did_ come to a standstill shortly after winning
the FBotM, if that left a Western Front running through the suburbs of Paris
it ought
to be possible for the Germns to cripple the French by making those rail
junctions unusable.

Lots of arguments here, and e.g. in US Civil War discussions,
based on the possession and use of railroads.  Which leads me
to the question, how fast could a determined nation with lots of
military and other laborers to call on _build_ a railroad where it
was needed, on a crash program basis?  Land acquisition is
a nonissue, you blow away anybody who argues.  Bridges would
perhaps be the biggest problem -- in WWI, could something
like a pontoon bridge be built that would stand the weight of a
locomotive (freight cars are duck soup after that)?  At this stage,
there was no such thing as behind the lines air attack, railroad
builders would be undisturbed except by the weather and delays
in supplies.  Such few tunnels as you would need via Belgium
and Northwest France could largely be replaced by massive
and unattractive blasting away of hillsides.  No civilian traffic to
consider, no stations except  for handling troops and materiel.

No, I'm working out of van Creveld's &quot;Supplying War&quot; and the map
therein.

The whole point of said fortresses, was to hold out and deny the use of
nearby transport routes. Superheavy howitzers could and did defeat them,
but were fairly beastly items to move and supply: and taking Verdun by
armed action, as seen in 1916, was no easy task. Otherwise, they were
built and stored to hold out for a while... and if you're trying to
smash the fortresses around Verdun you're committing troops and
resources that are no longer available elsewhere. (The whole point of
the Schlieffen Plan was, after all, to _avoid_ those fortifications)

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="

There wasn't any other way to move supplies over distance at the time.
Recall that what motor transport was available, had been massively
overused already with the inevitable problems of breakdowns, shortages
of fuel and spares, and driver exhaustion.

There isn't one single entity called &quot;the French Army&quot;, but a collection
of units: most of which may fall back, a few of which may not get word
in time or may decide to stand and fight for the Republic, and some of
whom were in solid fortifications with orders to fight to the last
round.

If the French field army withdraws from the Marne, the troops in the
forts around Verdun are not going to down tools and rush after them.

&gt;You probably can't, immediately. But that is not essential. Your principal
&gt;objective is not Paris, but the French Army.

And you need to keep your troops fed (not too hard to do at that point,
though becoming harder as the seasons shift and there's less to live on
from the land) but also supplied with ammunition at an unprecedented
rate. van Creveld hammers on the shock in the Great War of the tonnage
of ammunition consumed, where previously armies had often used bareky
half of their immediate ready-use stocks in a war and Schleiffen
handwaved ammunition supply as being &quot;as nothing&quot; compared to other
wants; while in reality, ammunition shortages were biting everyone by
the end of August 1914.

The trouble comes when you need to invest Paris and cut its
transportation (keeping those troops fed and armed) while still
maintaining a mass of manoeuvre with enough mobility and transport to
_chase_ the French field armies and bring them to battle, yet enough
strength and firepower to win when you do. The French can retreat along
whichever route suits them and their supply best, and can consider how
to leave you hungry with empty ammo pouches as well.

Depends whose guns run out of shells, and rifles out of bullets, first.
The French have less distance to improvise over, as I see it.

The problem with the Schleiffen Plan is that it's 1870 reprised but a
bit better, and doesn't account for the changes in armies and forces.
