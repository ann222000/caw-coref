1 Mass action

1.1 Workers agree to start working on Cape Town arena

SABC, 28 August 2007

Hundreds of workers, who downed tools at the construction site of Cape Town's 2010 World Cup stadium yesterday, have agreed to resume working. About 800 workers went on strike demanding to be paid travel allowances, backdated from March.

The workers met with union representatives at the construction site this morning and resolved to resume their duties. But Cosatu provincial secretary, Tony Ehrenreich, says if the issue is not addressed and a solution found by Friday, workers will embark on protracted strike action.

&quot;The main grievance of the workers is the travel allowance and the fact that people have to walk for miles to get to the site while some workers are being transported. So workers demands are absolutely justified and we have appealed to government, who is funding this project, to make sure that the contractors comply with decent labour standards.&quot;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------

1.2 COSATU- Stadium strike suspended until Friday

Celeste Ganga, Bush Radio, 29 August 2007
The entire building site at Green Point Stadium came to a halt on Tuesday, as all the workers went on strike due to the alleged exploitation of workers by the site management.

&quot;The strike had been un-procedural and had been underway for the last two days, but the demands are absolutely legitimate in terms of the ethics and values of the new South Africa, &quot;says COSATU spokesperson, Tony Ehrenreich.

The COSATU, NUM, BICAWU interventions had secured the return to work by employees in order to comply with the legalities that were not covered by the wildcat strike.

&quot;The legalities will now be complied with and should the companies not comply with the legitimate demands of workers, by Thursday, a legal strike will lead to the closure of the stadium on Friday, &quot;says Ehrenreich.

COSATU has called on the government and the company management at Murray and Roberts and WHBO, to urgently negotiate a resolution with the unions on the site.

&quot;The shutting down of the plant represents a victory for the workers who will ensure that the beneficiaries of the 2010 include workers and the working class, &quot;says Ehrenreich.

Murray and Roberts was not available for comment.

2 Union affairs

2.1 Cosatu calls for probe on North West farms

IOL, 28 August 2007

Several incidents amounting to the abuse of farm workers should be investigated in North West, the Congress of SA Trade Unions (Cosatu) said on Tuesday.

The trade union federation cited incidents dating back to 2005 ranging from what it described as unfair dismissals to the death of farm workers.

It accused farmers, police, justice officials and an Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration official of conspiring against the workers.

The union said it would organise a protest in Mafikeng on September 22 to demand the re-opening of all cases involving farm workers and their families.

Members of the SA Council of Churches and the SA Communist Party would take part in the march on the departments of safety and security and of agriculture.

Agri North West declined to comment immediately. - Sapa

2.2 Right to strike 'can't override health, education'

Louise Flanagan, The Star, 29 August 2007

The right to strike does not override other people's rights to healthcare or education, the South African Human Rights Commission has heard.

The right to strike extends no further than what's needed to convey the message to the employer, but not to constitutionally offensive conduct, according to SAHRC commissioner Karthy Govender.

He was speaking at an SAHRC seminar in Joburg yesterday on the impact of the recent national public service strike on the right of access to education and health.

&quot;Preventing people from having access to hospitals even for non-emergency treatment would, in my opinion, be constitutionally offensive conduct,&quot; said Govender.

&quot;It's much clearer when you are dealing with emergency treatment.&quot;

The protracted and acrimonious strike was characterised by protesters blocking access to hospitals, intimidation of non-strikers like teachers, and accusations of unethical behaviour by each side against the other.

Unions did not make a formal input in yesterday's seminar, but unionists present criticised the government's lack of strike planning and agreed that some protesters' actions had been unacceptable.

&quot;We see almost daily our rights coming into conflict with each other, &quot; said SAHRC chairperson Jody Kollapen, adding that the question was how to manage this conflict.

&quot;We tend to see our bill of rights as a shopping list. We choose the rights we like the most and ignore the rights we don't like ... We need to find a way of moving beyond that.&quot;

Deputy director-general of health Dr Kamy Chetty said the state had spent R24,9-million on treatment for patients moved to private hospitals. This was paid by the provinces.

Chetty said there had been intimidation of non-strikers, blocking of access to facilities, &quot;numerous incidents&quot; of damage to facilities, and patients left unattended and unfed.

There was a strong call at the seminar for minimum service level agreements (MSLAs) between the government and unions to be finalised to allow limited strike action in essential service sectors.

&quot;What's crucial is we have to determine the parameters in advance,&quot; said Govender.

Chetty said the entire health service was an essential service. &quot;It's not just a question of services provided in an ICU or in a casualty unit.&quot;

SA Medical Association chairperson Dr Kgosi Letlape said an MSLA was urgently needed.

&quot;We have been pleading with the government for a minimum service level agreement so that we can exercise our right to strike without compromising patient safety.&quot;

Letlape said that if the government defined the entire health service as part of an MSLA, this meant it would then have to be properly funded as it was all essential.

SA Students' Congress president David Maimela said that sometimes the right to strike interfered with learners' rights, but the issues were not simple.

He said learners boycotted classes to demand better education, while teachers went on strike for better salaries.

&quot;We used to say before 1994: 'Freedom now, education later' ... We are now saying: 'Education now and freedom forever',&quot; said Maimela.

2.3 Cosatu wants urgent meeting with Nqakula

IOL, 28 August 2007

Cosatu is seeking a meeting with Security Minister Charles Nqakula to discuss what the union says is overreaction by police against striking workers.

Cosatu said yesterday that police fired rubber bullets at striking workers at the Lonmin Platinum Mine in North West last week, after alleging they were intimidating working staff.

&quot;They were exercising their legal right to picket and persuade workers to join the strike,&quot; said Cosatu spokesperson Patrick Craven.

The National Union of Mineworkers members were on strike in protest against non-payment of wages as a result of new computer software.

Craven said Cosatu want to discuss with Nqakula ways of maintaining order without resorting to rubber bullets and stun grenades, and would continue to press for this meeting as a matter of extreme urgency. - Sapa

2.4 Tune in for soccer radio row

News24, 28 August 2007

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) supports the SABC in its tussle over radio broadcasting rights with the Premier Soccer League (PSL) and believes the matter was linked to commissions PSL negotiators stood to receive.

&quot;CWU strongly believe that the Professional Soccer League policy on 10% commission does influence the attitude of its management/negotiators against the public broadcasters,&quot; a CWU statement on Tuesday read.

The PSL cancelled the SABC's temporary soccer broadcasting permit last week, saying this was because a deadline on the matter had passed unheeded.

PSL spokesperson Ronnie Schloss said on Monday the temporary broadcasting rights granted to the national broadcaster were cancelled on Friday after the SABC failed to respond to a PSL deadline on the matter, which had expired on August 19.

It had been agreed that the SABC would be granted temporary radio broadcasting rights for the Charity Trust game on August 4. This was extended to allow coverage of the Supa8 and the first round of the premiership games, Schloss said.

&quot;We gave them until August 19 to conclude the contract which they haven't done,&quot; he said.

The rights currently belonged to the PSL who have received expressions of interest for them.

The CWU believed the withdrawal of the rights was an attempt to vilify the SABC and said it supported the public broadcaster it in the arbitration process relating to the rights.

2.5 NUM reacts to 'miner link' in ATM bombings

SABC, 29 August 2007

The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) says police should investigate the source of explosives that have allegedly been used in ATM bombings. NUM spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka says there should be evidence that links mineworkers to the supply of these explosives.

He was reacting to a statement by defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota that mineworkers are supplying the dynamite used in blowing up ATMs. Lekota was responding to a member's statement in the National Assembly, when he made the remarks.

3.1 More needed to protect female farm workers

Janine du Plessis, BuaNews, 29 August 2007

Cape Town - More work is needed to protect the rights of female farm workers, says Minister of Agriculture and Land Affairs Lulu Xingwana.

Addressing the 4th Women's Parliament in Cape Town, Tuesday, the minister said there was still a lot of work which needed to be done to reduce human rights abuses and violence against women on commercial farms.

There are 2.6 million people working as labourers on farms.

The minister identified KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, the Free State, Grabouw, Worcester as some of the hot spots for these issues.

Ms Xingwana said, however, various government departments, farmers unions and other stakeholders had already come together to improve the living conditions of farm workers and the rights of women.

A paper is being drafted in this regard and the department has also agreed to launch a land equity project.

&quot;We need to acquire land for farm dwellers that have been living on the land for over ten years. Our department must provide all the necessary funds,&quot; she said.

She said her department had agreed to provide skills and train new beneficiaries of land claims, to ensure they are able to take over once they have attained the land.

&quot;Since 1994 a number of laws have been passed and government has put programmes in place to ensure the access to land and property.

&quot;Land restitution seeks to bring equity and redistribute 30 percent of white-owned commercial agricultural land to black people and women,&quot; said the minister.

Women in Agriculture and Rural Development (WARD) launched in October last year, is a vehicle to ensuring women participating in land restitution.

&quot;Women in agriculture must ensure they get their equitable share,&quot; said Ms Xingwana.

The minister said everyone had the right to access land, and that included women.

&quot;There are over 3 million hectares of state-owned land, suitable for agriculture, standing unplanted. Wealth is in the land so there is no need to remain poor and hungry when we have so much fertile land,&quot; she said.

As the average age for a commercial farm worker is 55, the department is also faced with a gap in generations.

&quot;Agriculture does not have a future unless we can replenish these people and their skills. We need to capacitate and train workers, women and children to take over.&quot;

For this reason the Youth in Agriculture and Rural Development was launched and the minister urged the women attending Women's Parliament to take advantage of this.

Ms Xingwana said goats, cattle, pigs and sheep must no longer be &quot;dead assets&quot; in the hands of the poor and black emerging farmers.

&quot;Less than 10 percent of emerging farmers livestock reach the market. This means the farmers can not convert these assets into a means to make money.&quot;

In 2007, in her budget vote speech the minister introduced a livestock massification programme.

&quot;In two to three years South Africa should improve livestock production to become a net exporter of red meat. We want to increase the livestock production in not only black emerging farmers and women. We have taken a pro-poor approach,&quot; she said.

Ten youths are currently in China learning how to set up fish farming in South Africa. This will also open up vast opportunities for women.

The minister announced that on Saturday she would be in the Northern Cape to launch the Amanguni project where she would be handing over ten cows and ten bulls to women, to begin their own livestock production.

Deputy President, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka will also soon be launching an olive-tree project where, down the value chain women are to make olive oil for export.

3.2 Public service unveils women's empowerment plan

Themba Gadebe, BuaNews, 28 August 2007

Pretoria - Public Service and Administration Minister Fraser-Moleketi has officially unveiled an eight-pronged action plan to promote women's empowerment and gender equity in the workplace.

&quot;Gender equality has always been a core value of the struggle for a democratic South Africa, and has been adopted into our governance process,&quot; the minister said at a roundtable of government and stakeholders in gender, in Pretoria.

She identified a need to continually strive to eliminate gender inequalities in the workplace, through specific measures that address sexual harassment, patriarchal stereotypes and cultural attitudes that act as barriers to achieving true equality.

The following eight principles will be implemented in the public service to achieve these ends:

* Transformation for non-sexism promotes and protects human dignity and human rights of women, including the rights of women with disabilities.

* Establishing a Policy Environment which calls for the full implementation of national policies and implementation guidelines on women's empowerment and gender equality through the development of departmental and sector- specific guidelines and standard operating procedures.

* Meeting Equity Targets ensuring women's full participation in decision-making through the employment of 50 percent women at all levels of the Senior Management Service (SMS).

* Creating an Enabling Environment to put in place the departmental and sector Gender Management Systems, adequate Institutional Mechanisms and dedicated Gender Units.

* Gender Mainstreaming seeks to incorporate gender perspectives into all work of the Department

* Empowerment which deals with the capacity development for women's advancement and gender equality

* Providing Adequate Resources by availing adequate human, physical and financial resources for advancing gender equality

* Accountability, Monitoring and Evaluation to ensure the full responsibility, ownership for and reporting on advancing gender equality within the public service

Minister Fraser-Moleketi further called for one week to be declared a Public Service Women Management Week, which must be observed during the National Women's Month.

In addition, she said a Women Manager's Forum (WMF) for the public service will be set up at this year's Senior Management Service conference in September.

It is envisaged that this forum would create space for monitoring departmental progress towards meeting gender equity targets and the empowerment of all women in the workplace.

&quot;Gender equality can only be achieved through addressing women's unique practical needs as employees.

&quot;All policies, programs and projects affect women and men differently at the workplace. It is important that men play a central and critical role in ensuring that gender equality is achieved&quot;, said Ms Fraser-Moleketi.

3.3 Labour department gets tough

IOL, 28 August 2007

Labour department inspectors are to follow up all prohibition cases after two Mpumalanga workers were injured at a construction company that had been banned from working until it had taken safety measures.

The department said on Tuesday that legal action was being considered against the owner of the Witbank construction company whose employees carried on working regardless of a prohibition order.

Zolisa Sigabi, a representative of the department said: &quot;Our inspectors will stop at nothing in ensuring employers comply with the law.

We have actually decided to have inspectors follow up all prohibition cases even over the weekends.&quot; - Sapa

3.4 Co-operative banks fail to win support for tax breaks

Donwald Pressly, Business Report, 29 August 2007

A trade union proposal that a favourable tax regime should apply to the co-operative banking industry &quot;to promote the co-operative sector like in other countries&quot; has been shot down in the national assembly finance portfolio committee.

Tebogo Phadu, representing Cosatu affiliate the National Education Health and Allied Workers' Union (Nehawu), spoke in public hearings on the Co-operative Banks Bill. He said that in Spain, for example, co-operative banks &quot;are granted a tax holiday for the first 10 years, while in the US they are completely exempted from income tax&quot;.

But Abri Meiring, an advocate representing Business Unity SA and the Chambers of Commerce and Industry SA, argued that it would be inappropriate to exempt co-operative banks from taxation, as clubs and public benefit organisations were drawn into the tax net only recently, when they were involved &quot;in trading activities&quot;.

Meiring said that in principle there should be no reason not to be taxed if surpluses were built up. However, he expected finance minister Trevor Manuel to refer to the matter in the adjustments budget in October.

ANC MP Joan Fubbs said that while she recognised that one aim for establishing co-operative banks was to draw in the previously unbanked - about half of South Africa's adult population of 16 million - it was also important not to distort the tax base.

Phadu, who heads the Nehawu policy unit, proposed that the bill should include a section exempting co-operative banks from paying income tax, noting that these banks were not profit driven &quot;and are organised for meeting the needs of their members and their transactions are limited to these members and not the general public&quot;.

He argued that a co-operative bank would distribute any profit it might make differently from a conventional bank. In addition, he said, only members of the banking co-operative could borrow from those funds.

&quot;We borrow among ourselves, we grow among ourselves,&quot; he said. &quot;If there is a surplus, we return that money back to [ourselves].&quot;

Phadu argued that while financial services giants Old Mutual and Sanlam were both formed as co-operatives, they were now &quot;more led&quot; by directors in a self-perpetuating board system, &quot;rather than member led&quot;.

David de Jong, general manager of the Savings and Credit Co-operative League of South Africa, noted that a paper developed by Nedlac argued specifically that if a co-operative traded solely among its own members, there was a good argument for tax exemption.

If the co-operative bank, however, was trading outside of its membership, those activities should be taxed.

Phadu motivated that payroll deductions should be allowed for members to contribute savings to their co-operative banks. But De Jong noted that the bill was being discussed just when South Africa had taken steps to scale back payroll deductions for consumer credit transactions.

Meanwhile, Dave Mitchell, head of the national payment system department at the SA Reserve Bank and chairman of its standing committee for the review of the National Payment System (NPS) Act, has argued that the act should be amended to draw co-operative banks into the system.

In a submission to the parliamentary committee, Mitchell said: &quot;The reason for the proposal is that any tier of co-operative banks will ... need to meet the criteria set by the South African Reserve Bank in terms of the NPS Act before they could be allowed or admitted in the clearing and settlement systems.

3.5 Fraser-Moleketi rejects single body claim

IOL, 28 August 2007

Public Service and Administration Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi has rejected suggestions government is seeking to create one public service administration for all tiers of government.

&quot;What the initiative seeks to do is to harmonise the conditions of service across government, so that government is able to work better,&quot; she said on Tuesday.

It would promote access to services and assist in instilling an ethos of people-centred service.

It would also enable government to develop consistent service standards across the spheres of government.

Fraser-Moleketi emphasised that the Public Service Amendment Bill -approved by the National Assembly earlier this year - proposed to address various organisational and human resource areas directly or indirectly hampering service delivery.

This applied only to the current public service, which included provincial and local government.

She also dismissed the notion that the initiative would enable government to supervise appointments in all national departments and state agencies, all premiers offices, provincial departments,
municipalities and municipal agencies, as well as all employees of these bodies.

&quot;This is totally misleading. It reflects a misunderstanding of the structure and functioning of government in its current form as well as the proposals of the single public service initiative.

&quot;The management and supervision of employees in all government departments rests with in that institution, be it a government department (provincial or national), government entity, or local or district council,&quot; Fraser-Moleketi said. - Sapa

3.6 Govt, unions seek broader talks on Single Public Service

Themba Gadebe, BuaNews, 28 August 2007

Municipal workers unions and government have agreed that the scope of public consultations on legislation for the Single Public Service, be broadened to the National Economic, Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC).

This follows the unions meeting with Public Service and Administration Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi, to broaden social dialogue on this issue.

At NEDLAC, government comes together with organised business, labour and community groupings on a national level to discuss and try to reach consensus on issues of social and economic policy.

NEDLAC is aimed at making economic decision-making more inclusive, to promote the goals of economic growth and social equity.

The Single Public Service is seeks to provide for administration in all three spheres of government that is better organised and that operates in ways that ensure efficient, quality, collaborative and accountable service delivery to promote social and economic development.

Currently, employees of national and provincial government fall within a single policy framework from which local government is excluded.

The single public service initiative will bring local government into a framework under which national and provincial governments operate.

The envisaged framework on a single public service would see a common wage policy for the entire public service, harmonised conditions of service (medical aid and pension funds) and norms and standards for human resource management.

The single public service is set to improve service delivery by integrating the front, back offices and the institutions delivering services to the people.

&quot;Critical preparatory work is being undertaken to develop common norms and standards [remuneration and conditions of service dispensation] in relation to the human resource practices,&quot; the minister said.

The integration of government's services will allow citizens to receive government's services as a whole in a convenient location without having to travel far and wide.

For example, Home Affairs has developed a Track and Trace system which allows citizens to ascertain progress regarding their ID or passport applications via sms.

Another initiative from the cluster is the Citizens Relations Portal in which people would be able to make enquiries about service delivery.

These projects, the minister said, seek to promote the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) by citizens and the public service to deliver services more effectively and efficiently.

E-government is seen as an important factor in realising government's vision to deliver the services in the most convenient manner and e-Government promotes the use of ICT.

Through the Single Public Service, the conditions of service in national and provincial government will no longer vary significantly with those at local government.

The Thusong Centres, also known as the Multi-Purpose Community Centres are already meeting the demand of integrating services.

&quot;The critical focus is internet connectivity at these centres, especially to make the Batho Pele Gateway Portal available,&quot; she said.

3.7 Construction body to assess skills crunch

Business Report 28 August  2007

The construction education and training authority (CETA) is conducting a national survey to establish the true extent of skills shortages in the industry and the measures needed to counter this.

The intention is to create a &quot;skills information and research bank&quot;, continually updated with freshly gathered data which will be available to all role-players in the sector to help them plan their skills development programmes.

&quot;It will demand maximum input and co-operation from all our stakeholders to set this in motion,&quot; CETA chairman Narius Moloto said on Tuesday.

The information coming from this ongoing research would be of inestimable value in helping CETA meet its sector skills plan targets.

&quot;Until we know the depth of the problem we cannot decide what measures we need to take to meet the skills shortage challenge. In short, we need information,&quot; Moloto said in a statement.

However, to push this agenda successfully to the stage where CETA could table a credible sector skills plan, required a dedicated contribution from &quot;all boundaries of the construction industry&quot;.

Project participants included the South African Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors (SAFCEC), Master Builders South Africa (MBSA), the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB), the Black Construction Council (BCC), representatives of professionals, such as architects and quantity surveyors, and labour and materials manufacturers.

According to CETA Chief Operating Officer Erwin Sonnendecker, this would be the first totally representative survey ever undertaken by CETA.

&quot;At the very least it will give us a snapshot measurement of skills needs.

&quot;For the first time in its history CETA is starting to develop a methodology to accurately gauge what the construction sector needs in terms of skills. It is taking the bull by the horns,&quot; Sonnendecker said. - Sapa

3.8 State defends Zuma investigation warrants

Mail &amp; Guardian, 28 August 2007

The trial of Schabir Shaik had not yielded enough evidence to prosecute Jacob Zuma, the state contended in the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein on Tuesday.

&quot;A more comprehensive investigation was called for,&quot; said Wim Trengove, counsel for the state.

He submitted that although Zuma's former financial adviser had been found to have given him money with corrupt intent, this did not mean that the former deputy president had received the payments with the same intent.

&quot;It's thus wrong to say there was enough evidence.&quot;

Hence it had been necessary for the Scorpions to raid four of Zuma's homes and his attorney Michael Hulley's office and seize about 93 000 documents, as they did on August 18 2005.

The Durban High Court subsequently declared five of the search warrants unlawful and ordered the documents to be returned.

Trengove was responding to contentions made by Zuma's lawyers that having enough evidence to convict Shaik was enough &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence to convict Zuma.

He disputed that the intention behind the seizure of financial records at Hulley's office was to get behind Zuma's defence strategy in his pending corruption trial.

He said this had been based on a misunderstanding of a statement made by Scorpions investigator Johan du Plooy in an affidavit.

&quot;What he said was that as the case unfolded defences are suggested from time to time, which the state needs to investigate to determine whether they have substance,&quot; said Trengove.

He asked the court not to decide &quot;effective and appropriate relief&quot; in the matter on conventional lines, but to consider a remedy that brings in constitutional interests and the public interest.

&quot;In a case such as this one there are other interest that are at stake, constitutional interests.&quot;

Trengove asked the court for an order to keep the seized evidence sealed and locked in case Zuma is in fact prosecuted for corruption.

Arguing against the appeal, Zuma's counsel, Kemp J Kemp, submitted that the warrants under contention were too wide in scope.

Kemp also submitted that there was no way to determine when the searchers were acting outside the scope of the warrants.

&quot;A person in charge of a property must know what to resist.&quot;

Zuma was whisked from the court when it adjourned for lunch.

From his black 4x4, he waved to a group of singing supporters in front of the court steps.

Before the start of proceedings, a security guard joked with journalists sitting in the public gallery, telling them how to behave.

&quot;No cameras and no zooming in on Mr Zuma.&quot;

Security guards with ear pieces milled around the room finding a seat for Zuma.

He eventually took his place next to Hulley, and one row behind Kemp.

Trengove greeted Zuma and shook his hand. A court official who came to watch proceedings said she had never seen the court so full &quot;even for [Allan] Boesak's case&quot;.

The outcome of the appeal would determine whether or not the National Prosecuting Authority will charge Zuma and French arms company Thint for corruption relating to the multibillion-rand arms deal.

The case continues.

3.9 Tough judges wipe smile off Zuma's face

Karyn Maughan and Tania Broughton, The Star, 29 August 2007

Jacob Zuma may have entered the Supreme Court of Appeal with a spring in his step, but he left it legally bruised and no longer certain of stalling the state's relentless digging into his financial affairs.

Three of the Bloemfontein court's senior judges yesterday led the charge against Zuma's counsel, Kemp J Kemp SC, slamming him for &quot;vague submissions&quot; that they said had no basis in law.

Although it was the state appealing against an order that its raids on Zuma and his attorney, Michael Hulley, were conducted with unlawful warrants, it was Kemp who ended up facing a marathon grilling.

Under almost unceasing questioning, a visibly flustered Kemp submitted that people being searched by officials must understand the search warrants used against them so that they could &quot;physically resist&quot; if their rights were being violated.

Commented Judge Robert Nugent: &quot;I don't understand that proposition.&quot; Later he said: &quot;The warrants should be clear to be able to be challenged in court, not in a fisticuff.&quot;

Judges Nugent, Ian Farlam and Tom Cloete appeared unimpressed with Kemp's suggestions that the state might have taken privileged documents when it raided Hulley's offices - potentially resulting in any future case against Zuma being rendered a mistrial.

Pointing out that Hulley was an experienced criminal attorney, the judges questioned his claims - made to the Durban High Court - that he had not known he could refuse to hand over the documents because they might be privileged.

Today the court was to hear an appeal by French arms company Thint against a Pretoria High Court ruling that the raids on its premises were in fact lawful.

3.10 SABC reporting style lambasted by SACP Board candidate

News24, 28 August 2007

The SABC failed to pose critical questions when reporting on the South African Communist Party (SACP)'s R500 000 missing donation saga, MPs heard on Tuesday.

Responding to questions during his interview for an SABC board member position, SACP member Sizwe Shezi told the National Assembly's communication committee that the public broadcaster's current reporting style left much to be desired.

&quot;Instead of simply transmitting the story the way they did, the SABC should have posed critical questions to enable people to decide whether the story was true,&quot; he said, adding that there were a lot of areas the SABC still needed to improve on.

Democratic Alliance member Dene Smut quizzed Shezi further on his political affiliation, wanting to know whether in the event of him being appointed, he would not try to use his powerful board member position to push the SACP agenda.

In response, Shezi cited a number of organisations he was currently involved in, including the National Aids Council and the Youth Council, as evidence that his political affiliation was not an issue.

&quot;I see no contradiction in a member of the SACP being allowed to participate in society's structures,&quot; he said.

The committee's chairperson, Godfrey Oliphant, concurred with Shezi, saying there was no law prohibiting anyone from being appointed as an SABC board member on the basis of political affiliation.

When quizzed about his involvement in the Jacob Zuma RDP Education Trust, Shezi said the fund was a good cause meant to uplift the lives of the rural poor, and that he was proud to be associated with such an initiative.

He is one of the 37 candidates the committee has short listed for 12 SABC board positions.

3.11 Ex-Mitchell Cotts executives get stiff sentences for fraud

Mzwandile Jacks, Business Report, 8 August 2007

The former executives of the Mitchell Cotts Pension Fund received stiff sentences in the Johannesburg specialised crimes court yesterday after pleading guilty to fraud, money laundering and contravening sections of the Financial Institutions Act.

Rowland Edward Bailey was sentenced to 10 years in jail, suspended for five years, for fraud and theft. He was fined R200 000 or three years' imprisonment, suspended for five years, for contravening a section of the Financial Institutions Act, which seeks to protect pension fund members. He was fined R3 million or six years' imprisonment, suspended for five years, for money laundering.

This sentence was on condition that the accused pay the liquidator of Mitchell Cotts Pension Fund R500 000, in lieu of a fine, for the direct benefit of the registered pensioners within 15 days of the date of the sentence. This amount should be paid from Bailey's bail bonds, the court ruled.

His wife, Shirley Bailey, was fined R1 million or five years' imprisonment, suspended for five years, for theft and fraud. This sentence was passed on condition that she pays R200 000 to the liquidators of Mitchell Cotts for the direct benefit of the existing registered pensioners within 15 days.

The Baileys' saga is reminiscent of the Fidentia debacle, one of the most sensational cases of white-collar crime in South Africa. Fidentia bosses J Arthur Brown and Graham Maddock are up for the alleged R600 million theft of benefits intended for widows and orphans of deceased mine workers. They are accused of misappropriating R246 million belonging to the Transport Education and Training Authority.

The Mitchell Cotts Pension Fund was the subject of a 2005 ruling by the pension funds adjudicator in which the former owners, the Baileys, were severely criticised for stripping its assets.

Investigations showed that more than R23 million had been misappropriated by the couple.

The Baileys entered into a plea bargain with the state.

The couple had worked closely with Peter Ghavalas, a former Nedbank employee who is alleged to have been behind schemes to plunder pension fund surpluses.

The pension funds involved in the Ghavalas cases are the Datakor pension and retirement funds, the Cortech Pension Fund and the Mitchell Cotts Pension Fund. It is estimated that the funds lost more than R500 million.

Ghavalas, who emigrated to Australia 1998, was nabbed two years ago in Johannesburg after sneaking back into the country to visit his dying mother. He is out on R1 million bail and is scheduled to go on trial in October.

There is a possibility that the Baileys could be turned into state witnesses in the Ghavalas case.

4 The economy

4.1 Slowdown at factories is bad news for growth

Mariam Isa, Economics Editor, Business Day, 29 August 2007

ECONOMIC growth eased to 4,5% in the second quarter of this year, knocked mainly by a slump in manufacturing and fuelling concern that the pace may slow more sharply than expected in the months ahead.

The seasonally adjusted and annualised rise in gross domestic product (GDP) still exceeded forecasts for a 4,4% increase, buoyed mainly by faster growth in finance, real estate and business services.

Growth in the sector - which accounts for a fifth of GDP, making it the economy's biggest - jumped to 7,6% in the second quarter from 5,7% in the first.

But expansion in manufacturing - the second-largest sector - slowed to 0,5% from 4,7%, its slowest since 2003 when it contracted for the whole year.

That prompted some economists to revise down their growth forecasts for this year, pointing out that uncertainty about the effect of global market volatility was also likely to affect demand for local exports.

&quot;We have reduced our total GDP growth for 2007 to 4,8% from 5,1%,&quot; Efficient Research economist Nico Kelder said.

&quot;The current global and domestic environment suggests that manufacturers will have a difficult time to report strong expansions,&quot; he said .

Manufacturing accounts for more than 16% of GDP and is seen as crucial to the government's aim of boosting economic growth to 6% by 2010 and halving unemployment by 2014.

Mining fell 0,1% after a 7,8% contraction in the first quarter - putting the sector, which punches above its weight in employment, technically in a recession.

Growth in wholesale and retail trade, lumped with hotels and restaurants, also slowed in what economists described as a clear sign that higher interest rates were starting to hit domestic demand.

The economy's third-largest sector grew 4,4% in the second quarter versus 5 % in the first - the fourth consecutive decline.

&quot;There are definitely signs of a slowdown in the retail sector,&quot; said Joe de Beer, executive manager of national accounts at Statistics SA.

But he said the manufacturing slowdown should be seen in the context of a 4,8% increase compared to the same quarter last year, which was still robust.

Economists said the Reserve Bank was likely to focus more on consumer inflation data for July due today, along with July's credit figures on Thursday, as it contemplates its next policy decision.

&quot;The policy implications of this still sound growth performance are muddied by continued signs of a two-speed economy in SA,&quot; said Standard Chartered's Africa economist Razia Khan.

&quot;With inflation risks still very real, price concerns will have to take centre stage for now.&quot;

The Bank has already raised interest rates by a cumulative three percentage points since June last year to fight rising inflation, ignited mainly by higher prices for food and fuel.

But economists said the slowdown in growth should allay fears over capacity constraints, which are adding to the upward pressure on inflation.

&quot;This should reinforce the case for keeping interest rates on hold for the remainder of 2007,&quot; Nedbank economist Dennis Dykes said.

Growth in construction also slowed from a 17-year peak of 21,3% in the first quarter to 14,4% in the second.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------

4.2 Manufacturing freezes growth

Ethel Hazelhurst, Busines Report, 29 August 2007

The poor performance of the manufacturing sector is dragging down growth, according to figures released yesterday by Statistics SA.

The sector, the second-biggest in the economy and one of the top employers, was flat, with growth of only 0.5 in the second quarter. This compares with 4.75 percent in the first quarter and 8.25 percent in the previous quarter.

The failure of manufacturing to play a dynamic role in the economy puts a question mark over the country's ability to move to a higher growth path and meet the target set by the government's accelerated and shared growth initiative for South Africa (Asgisa).

Asgisa aims to achieve average growth of 4.5 percent between 2005 and 2009 and at least 6 percent between 2010 and 2014.

Without growth on this scale, the economy will be unable to meet the government's other objectives: cutting unemployment by half and reducing poverty to less than one-sixth of households by 2014.

While a strong rand is generally blamed for manufacturing's inability to gain traction as it reduces the competitiveness of exports, the average trade-weighted rand (measured on an index) was little changed between the first and second quarters, according to Dennis Dykes, a Nedbank group chief economist.

&quot;The trade-weighted rand strengthened marginally from 78.5 to 78.7, but over the year it was 13 percent lower,&quot; Dykes said.

Some economists identified capacity constraints and skills shortages as the major deterrents to strong manufacturing growth.

Mike Schussler, a T-Sec economist, said: &quot;Capacity utilisation is running at over 85 percent, which is virtually full capacity, given normal downtime in industry.&quot;

Michael McDonald, manager of economic and commercial services at the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of SA, agreed. &quot;In fact we are operating over capacity at present,&quot; he said.

Rising interest rates could have played a role in slowing growth.

Schussler said the 2.5 percentage point increase between June last year and June this year could have contributed to the failure of manufacturers to expand, by making borrowing more costly.

Kevin Lings, an economist at Stanlib, said there could have been an &quot;intentional rundown of inventories as rising interest rates increased the cost&quot;.

But he pointed out that manufacturing's low growth was off a high base: &quot;There has been a decline in motor vehicle sales, which were doing exceptionally well last year.&quot; He blamed &quot;technical problems with the registration of cars, which delayed transfers in the second quarter&quot;, as well as the impact of higher interest rates.

Lings said lower sales of passenger vehicles, clothing and textiles, furniture and paper products could have been in response to higher interest rates.

But he said fixed investment was keeping up certain &quot;[sub]sectors, while sales of commercial vehicles, probably related to building activities, remained strong&quot;.

Total growth in gross domestic product slowed to 4.5 percent in the second quarter from 4.7 percent in the first quarter.

It was driven by an increase of nearly 8 percent in activity generated by the finance, property and business services sector and growth of nearly 6 percent in the transport, storage and communication sector.

The economy was also buoyed by double-digit growth in two relatively small sectors: construction and agriculture.

Nico Kelder, an economist at the Efficient Group, said the low manufacturing growth figure was &quot;a surprise, given the monthly data produced by Stats SA. Based on the monthly data, we calculated growth of 3.5 percent.&quot;

Asgisa identified binding constraints on the economy, which included the volatility of the currency; the effectiveness of the national logistics system; the shortage of skilled labour; barriers to competition; the regulatory environment, which places a burden on small businesses; and deficiencies in state organisation, capacity and leadership.

The department of trade and industry recently published a national industrial policy framework to address these constraints and to fast-track &quot;four lead sectors&quot; for growth: capital/transport equipment and metals fabrication; automotives and components; chemicals, plastic fabrication and pharmaceuticals; and forestry, pulp and paper and furniture.

However, commentators are divided on whether the framework will address underlying problems in the economy.

4.3 SA 'on track for record growth'

Fin24, 28 August 2007

South Africa's economic growth slowed to 4.5% on a seasonally adjusted and annualised basis in the second quarter of 2007, weighed down mostly by slimmer manufacturing sector growth, official data showed on Tuesday.

A Reuters poll of economists last week forecast the economy would have grown by 4.2%, compared with 4.7% in the first quarter.

On an unadjusted basis, South Africa's economy grew by 5.0% over the second quarter of 2006, Statistics South Africa said.

&quot;It was slightly better than our expectation, I think it reflects the resilience of the economy despite the 300 basis point hike in
interest rates that we've already seen,&quot; Elize Kruger, economist at Kagiso Securities, said.

&quot;I think it puts us on track to record a growth rate close to 5% for the year. I had thought we might downgrade after today, but it seems we're still on track to record a growth rate in the region of 4.8% for the year.&quot;

Africa's biggest economy has expanded by about 5% annually for the past three years. It reached 5.1% in 2005 - near a three-decade high.

The faster economic growth has been driven mainly by bullish domestic demand, which has added to inflationary pressures and helped prompt the central bank to hike interest rates by three percentage points since June 2006.

Strong growth in the tertiary sector, which includes financial services and real estate, was a major driver of the economy in the second quarter of 2007. It grew by 5.4%, helping to offset sluggish growth in manufacturing, a major component of the secondary sector.

&quot;The secondary sector only grew by 2.7%, based on manufacturing slowing down. That grew by only 0.5%,&quot; Joe de Beer, executive manager of national accounts at Statistics SA, said.

The second quarter manufacturing figure was the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2003.

Stats SA said while growth in wholesale and retail trade remained fairly strong at 4.4% on a quarter-on-quarter basis, it was still the lowest since the second quarter of 2004.

4.4 Adapt 'green' strategies to suit SA's complexion

Neva Makgetla, Business Day, 29 August 2007

IF ONLY Africa had colonised Europe, it would have made a fabulous nature reserve, stretching from the Greek islands to the lakes and forests of Sweden.

Instead, debates in SA about the environment are shaped largely by European paradigms whose basic assumptions often don't fit SA's realities. However well intentioned, the strategies that emerge may push the cost of containing pollution largely onto the poor.

SA has an economy rooted in dirty industries and shaped by apartheid, leaving it with unique environmental challenges. The questions we face are how to raise the living standard of the majority without generating an unbearable pollution burden, and how to limit environmental damage without pushing the cost primarily onto the poor and powerless.

SA's economy is founded largely on cheap coal, which supports electricity and some liquid fuel production. Low-cost electricity has been critical for the mines and, even more, the smelters. As a result, in contrast to most of the world, industry accounts for well over half of all energy consumption. Coal-fuelled electricity may be cheap, but it's dirty. Per person, SA produces about a third more greenhouse gases than the international average.

Obviously, the economy cannot be redirected overnight. We need a long-term strategy to identify opportunities and find technological solutions to reduce the damage caused by coal-based industries. Simply regulating polluting industries may slow their growth and raise costs, without supporting new industries that would be less environmentally damaging. Unless this strategy has broad support it is likely to prove unsustainable.

In the event, the environmental impact assessment process has had a significant effect on private and public investment, increasing planning costs and in some cases imposing significant delays. Yet the new industrial policy doesn't mention the environment or discuss how considerations of sustainability should affect sectoral priorities or infrastructure plans.

The situation isn't helped by the tendency to blame pollution on over-consumption by individuals and households. That is certainly true for the richest 10% of the population, which consumes about 40% of the national income. For most communities in SA, however, pollution arises rather from underconsumption.

One of the worst forms of pollution in SA is the haze of smoke that wraps many townships in winter. It arises because, as the 2005 General Household Survey shows, only 60% of families can afford electricity for cooking. The rest burn wood, coal or charcoal. Moreover, in 2005 one household in 10 had bucket sanitation or none at all, while more than a third used an unimproved pit latrine.

Given these circumstances, it's a problem when policies essentially make the poor forego consumption, rather than limiting use by the rich and subsidising cleaner options for the poor. Why do we ask only poor households to put up with waterless toilets? If we really want to limit water use, it would make more sense to look at introducing them in Sandton.

Similar challenges emerge when making decisions about projects in rural areas. Settlement policies under apartheid left many apparently remote rural areas with impoverished populations. The risk is that, in order to conserve natural beauty, we deprive these communities of economic opportunities. Consider, for instance, the debates about forestry. The industrial policy prioritises it because it can link small producers to national and international value chains. Studies have identified areas in Eastern Cape where forestry would be viable and sustainable. Nonetheless, opponents oppose it on principle, - without proposing alternatives that would raise living standards for the very poor households of the region.

Obviously, there are natural beauties that must be preserved. But where there are settlements, we can't simply deny the people infrastructure and economic opportunities. In short, a fundamental challenge for SA is to reduce pollution without increasing the burdens on the poor. We need strategies that limit consumption by the rich and open new chances for the poor , rather than vice versa.

5 Nozizwe and Manto

5.1 Cosatu backs axed deputy, calls for audit

Karima Brown, Political Editor, Business Day, 29 August 2007

AFRICAN National Congress (ANC) ally, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), yesterday called on the government to undertake a financial audit of &quot;all cabinet members and senior government officials&quot; who owed the state outstanding money.

Failure to do so would suggest the government was pursuing a &quot;vendetta&quot; against former deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge since her axing from cabinet, the federation said.

Cosatu is rallying behind the former deputy minister as government officials tighten the financial
screws on her for outstanding debts owed to various government departments.

&quot;It is highly suspicious that money allegedly outstanding since as early as 1999 is only now being recovered,&quot; Cosatu said.

&quot;If the government is so concerned about auditing the spending of taxpayers' money, why has it taken so long to discover that these amounts are outstanding?&quot;

Cosatu also condemned the government for docking Madlala-Routledge's last salary.

It said this was illegal in terms of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act, if the state had taken the money without Madlala-Routledge's consent.

However, Public Service and Administration Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi told reporters in Cape Town yesterday it was not unusual for a public servant's salary to be docked if money was owed. She cited the recent example of government employees who went on strike and whose salary payments were reversed.

The health department docked Madlala-Routledge's last salary for money it said she owed for a travel allowance given to her ahead of the &quot;unauthorised&quot; trip to Spain, which led to her being axed.

The government is also insisting that Madlala-Routledge pay back R116357 in expenses and subsistence allowances incurred during her tenure as deputy defence minister from 1999 to 2004.

The ANC has yet to decide her fate, but senior leaders want to institute disciplinary charges.

Cosatu's backing is likely to irk some in the ANC leadership who have agitated for Madlala-Routledge to face disciplinary charges for having allegedly brought the party into disrepute.

And, while ANC secretary-general Kgalema Motlanthe has been tasked by the ANC's national working committee to meet Madlala-Routledge, it is understood that the party's leadership is divided over the matter.

5.2 Group slams 'obstructionist' Manto

Angela Quintal, The Star, 29 August 2007

Joint open letter to deputy president accuses government of misplaced loyalty at expense of the nation's health

A group of clerics, non-governmental organisations and trade unionists believe Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang has gone beyond mere dereliction of duty and that her &quot;deliberate obstruction&quot; has resulted in more Aids deaths and HIV infections.

The charge is contained in a joint open letter to Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka from the SA Council of Churches, the SA NGO Coalition, the Aids Consortium, the Triangle Project, the Treatment Action Campaign and Cosatu.

The group also criticises the government for its misplaced loyalty at the expense of the nation's health and questions its commitment to the new Aids plan adopted last year.

It accuses Tshabalala-Msimang and her director-general, Thami Mseleku, of a lack of leadership and ignoring government policy.

The government and ANC last week rallied around Tshabalala-Msimang, dismissing calls for her to be fired, stating she was doing a good job as health minister and that there was no proof of dereliction of duty.

In a letter to Mlambo-Ngcuka, who chairs the SA National Aids Council, the six organisations state that they &quot;once again live in fear that the government is in retreat&quot;.

Mlambo-Ngcuka and former deputy health minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge were widely credited late last year with mending bridges, resulting in a unified partnership in the fight against HIV and Aids between the government and civil society.

However, yesterday the organisations said Madlala-Routledge's dismissal and the manner in which she was axed had increased the fear that the government was retreating.

&quot;We fear that denialism about the scale and needs of the HIV crisis, as well as the crisis in the public health system more broadly, is once again ascendant in the Health Ministry.&quot;

The organisations said they had remained silent about the ministry's &quot;obstruction&quot; out of respect for the deputy president and the cabinet's endorsement of the National Strategic Plan on HIV/Aids and Sexually Transmitted Infections 2007-2011 (NSP).

&quot;We hoped the government would put the lives of our people before misplaced loyalty. Instead, our people continue to die and become infected because of lack of leadership and deliberate obstruction from Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang and her director-general, Thami Mseleku,&quot; they contend.

They accused the minister of ignoring some of the government's commitments of late last year, including the introduction of a policy to provide dual antiretroviral prophylaxis for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission.

Instead, Tshabalala-Msimang had ignored the NSP recommendation in this regard, even though the Medicines Control Council and Medical Research Council had also recommended this in line with World Health Organisation guidelines since 2004.

&quot;This intervention is feasible, affordable and being called for by health professionals.&quot;

There was also an agreement on the Westville Prison case and a plan for prisons across the country.
Yet, after agreement was reached with Deputy Correctional Services Minister Loretta Jacobus and her team, mysteriously, Minister Ngconde Balfour and Mseleku blocked this, the letter states.

&quot;It remains stalled. Prisoners in Westville and most other prisons continue to die in large numbers.&quot;

It was also agreed to settle the TAC's court action against the government in the case of vitamin salesman Matthias Rath. However, this was blatantly ignored by the Health Ministry and the case was provisionally set down for later this year.

The letter says these were a few of the many examples of the &quot;deliberate undermining&quot; by the Health Ministry &quot;of our commitments to unity and urgency&quot;.

The organisations reiterated that over 300 000 people in South Africa died of Aids in 2006 and over half-a-million people needed Aids treatment, or else they would die within the next two years.

Moreover, tens of thousands of infants would be infected with HIV this year.

&quot;These are grim statistics, but the government can save many lives by implementing the NSP. In late 2006 you gave us immense hope. A bridge had opened up uniting the government with scientists, people living with HIV, clinicians, unions, churches, business, broader civil society and the TAC,&quot; the organisations said.

6.1 Cosatu slams SADC inaction over Zimbabwe crisis

Lance Guma, SA Radio Africa, 28 August 2007

The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) has criticised what it calls the lack of any real progress at the just ended Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit meeting in Lusaka, Zambia.

The meeting was supposed to have discussed measures aimed at resolving Zimbabwe's political and economic crisis but COSATU took exception to the lack of transparency in the way heads of state discussed the issue. The union says 80 percent unemployment, inflation officially pegged at over 7600 percent and shortages of basic commodities are having a devastating effect on ordinary people.

Thousands are fleeing the poverty, hunger and political repression affecting the country and yet the regional bloc ignored all those concerns.

Speaking to Newsreel on Tuesday Patrick Craven, the COSATU spokesperson, said although they are yet to get the full details of the deliberations, they felt the recommendations made by the regional bloc were out of sync with the actual reasons for the crisis. A letter by South African President Thabo Mbeki in the ANC Today newsletter talks about the SADC meeting approving initiatives to assist Zimbabwe's economic recovery. COSATU say there 'is little in the President's letter to suggest the sort of radical measures that the situation demands.' SADC itself seems to have accepted Mugabe's mantra about sanctions hurting Zimbabwe's economy.

Craven said the main reason for the lack of investment and extension of credit lines for Zimbabwe was not sanctions 'but chronic economic instability and brutal political repression, which the SADC report ignores entirely.' The South African labour body also noted the lack of any real progress by Mbeki to broker a deal between Zanu PF and the MDC. COSATU say although ultimate responsibility lies with the people of Zimbabwe, SADC governments have to take a much tougher line with the Zanu PF government, because the crisis is affecting them directly.

6.2 Zimbabwe teachers demand 400 percent salary hike

Lizwe Sebatha, ZimOnline, 28 August 2007
BULAWAYO - Zimbabwean teachers are demanding 400 percent salary increments, citing mounting poverty amid reports that 7 200 of their colleagues have resigned since last January over low pay and poor working conditions.
They have threatened to abandon classrooms if the government does not increase their salaries to $15 million a month with effect from September from about $2.9 million currently.
The demands were submitted to the Public Service Commission and the Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture at the end of July through the APEX council that represents all civil servants.
Tendai Chikowore, president of the Zimbabwe Teachers Association and APEX chairperson, confirmed the teachers' demands to the government but refused to disclose the increment they were asking for.
&quot;We made submissions to the government for salary adjustments for the third quarter of the year but I can't reveal the figures as it might jeopardise negotiations,&quot; Chikowore told ZimOnline yesterday.
Raymond Majongwe, secretary general of the militant Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ), defended the $15 million demands, arguing the government had reneged on a promise to review quarterly their salaries.
&quot;Teachers are now worse off than they were the same period last year,&quot; said Majongwe.
&quot;Unless the government makes an undertaking to award us $15 million salaries, we are headed for collision as we are not going to allow a situation where our teachers are pauperised.&quot;
He however did not disclose whether the teachers had given the government an ultimatum over the salary increments.
Majongwe said a survey by his union had revealed that 7 200 teachers had left the country since January this year in frustration over low pay and working conditions.
This is 44 percent more than the 5 000 teachers who left the country in the whole of last year.
Majongwe said most of the teachers had sought employment in Botswana, South Africa, Namibia and Swaziland.
&quot;According to our survey and reports from various provinces, over 7 200 teachers have left since January. We have lost the greatest number of teachers in the first eight months of 2007 compared to previous years,&quot; said Majongwe.
He however conceded that the figures could be an understatement because more teachers may have left during the second term school holiday which ends next week.
&quot;Most schools might fail to have lessons when they open next week due to lack of teachers,&quot; he warned.
The worst affected would be peri-urban and rural schools because teachers would not afford high transport costs.
Education Minister Aeneas Chigwedere could not be reached for comment yesterday as he was said to have travelled out of the country.
He has always denied claims that Zimbabwe faces a shortage of teachers.
Zimbabwe is grappling with a severe brain drain as professionals continue leaving the country to regional and overseas destinations in search of better paying jobs.
It is estimated that there are 10 000 Zimbabwean teachers in South Africa, some of them doing menial jobs.
The South African government recently said it wanted to recruit foreign teachers to teach science and mathematics and that it preferred the &quot;well-trained&quot; teachers from its troubled northern neighbour.
