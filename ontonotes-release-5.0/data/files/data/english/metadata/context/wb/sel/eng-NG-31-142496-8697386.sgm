BTW, it's a very graphic and bloody movie.  Not recommended for the
emotionally fragile.

Only 363 if you make it case sensitive and capitalize &quot;God&quot; though ... the
other one, &quot;god is&quot; is perhaps the most relevant of all for you are asking
which god is the &quot;God of ACIM&quot; and rather clearly neither of the false gods
mentioned in the movie are mentioned in ACIM except in the following
context: (from FIP Second Edition)

&quot;T-10.IV.1. He [the god of sickness] is the belief that you can choose which
god is real. 8 Although it is clear this has nothing to do with reality, it
is equally clear that it has everything to do with reality as you perceive
it.&quot;

And 403 times in the six volumes of the HLC/Urtext.  In FIP it gets moved to
chapter 10.  Originally it occurs late in chapter 9, here's the full
paragraph from the HLC:

&quot;T 9 I 17. Only at the altar of God will you find peace. And this altar is
in you because God put it there. His Voice still calls you to return, and He
will be heard when you place no other gods before Him. You can give up the
god of sickness for your brothers; in fact, you would HAVE to do so if you
give him up for yourself. For if you see him anywhere, you have accepted
him. And if you accept him, you WILL bow down and worship him, because he
was made as God's replacement. He is the belief that you can CHOOSE which
god is real. Although it is perfectly clear that this has nothing to do with
reality, it is equally clear that it has EVERYTHING to do with reality as
you perceive it.&quot;

In the Sub-Urtext, as usual whenever there is any sort of difference, it is
better yet ...

&quot;T 9 I 20. You can give up the god of sickness for your brothers; in fact,
you would HAVE to do so, if you give him up for yourself. For if you see him
anywhere, YOU have accepted him. And if you accept him, you WILL bow down
and worship him, because HE WAS MADE AS GOD'S REPLACEMENT. He is the belief
that YOU CAN CHOOSE WHICH GOD IS REAL. Although it is perfectly clear that
this has nothing to do with REALITY, it is equally clear that it has
EVERYTHING to do with REALITY AS YOU PERCEIVE IT.&quot;

But this &quot;god of sickness&quot; needs to be understood a bit further.  We can
look on him as representative of all false gods, of which ACIM mentions
many, god of war, god of fear, god of injustice, god of the cricifixion, god
of cruelty ....

Of them all, the following, again from the Sub-Urtext, is highly relevant,
especially the last line, &quot;they exist only beause you honour them!&quot;
&quot;T 9 I 18. You WILL hear the god you listen to. You MADE the god of
sickness, and BY making him, you made yourself ABLE to hear him. But you did
NOT create him, because he is NOT the Will of the Father. He is therefore
not eternal, and will be UNmade for you, the instant you signify your
willingness to accept ONLY the eternal. If God has but one Son, there is but
one God. You share reality with Him, BECAUSE reality is not divided. To
accept other gods before Him, is to place other images before YOURSELF. You
do not realize how much you listen to your gods, and how vigilant you are on
their behalf. But they exist only because you honor them.&quot;

&lt;aside mode on &gt;: How do I know?

http://www.execulink.com/~dthomp75/2007/RESOURCES/ALLSIXd.pdf

When Acrobat reader loads, click on the &quot;binocular&quot; icon, (generally top
left) then &quot;search&quot; for &quot;God is&quot; and you see 'em all!
Make it case sensitive and &quot;god is&quot; becomes a different search, with only
one, but a very interesting one, hit.

To check a single word it is quicker to use the Concordances,
http://www.execulink.com/~dthomp75/2007/CONCORDANCES.htm
but for a count on character strings other than a single word, Acrobat is
quite cool.  You just need the &quot;source&quot; material in good machine readable
form, and that's what my website is for.

There's a collection of ACIM source material in searchable form on this web
page:
http://www.execulink.com/~dthomp75/2007/RESOURCES/Other%20text.htm

My main complaint with Acrobat as a search tool, aside from the fact tht
it's rather slow,  is that there is no way to caputre or export the results
of a search.  For instance I can't cut and paste the 403 &quot;God is&quot; hits and
include them in this post.  If I want to show you that list, you have to go
and do the search yourself.

&lt;aside mode off&gt;

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; ~ Why do you say otherwise?
">

&quot;God is not the author of fear&quot; is one of the 403.  While that excludes
either of the two false gods mentioned above, defining anything by what it
is not is problematic.  Four of the 403 say &quot;God is love.&quot;  Love does not
*require* the beloved to kneel (symbolic of surrender of free will) and
&quot;submit&quot; (the act of surrendering free will).  And love is not cruel.  Only
human fears, and the false gods and idols we invented, worship and believe
in to give expression to our fears, behave like that.

So the God spoken of by Jesus is a different God than either of those
options mentioned.

False gods are numerous, and their number may be infinite, with new ones
being invented by fear every day.  ACIM mentiones the &quot;god of which you are
afraid&quot; and &quot;the god of sickness&quot; and the &quot;god of sepression&quot; and the &quot;god
of the crucifixion&quot; and the &quot;god of cruelty&quot; ... all idols, false gods,
projections of the ego which mirror only its own fear and *lack* of love.

ACIM also loves simple contrasts:  &quot;either this or that&quot; works well in many
instances.  &quot;What is not love is a cry for love&quot; for instance, to name just
one of the many simple &quot;this or that&quot; contrasts ACIM uses.  It's either
perfect love with no trace of fear and coercion, or it isn't the real God!
Now 'submission' may be offered to one's beloved, but it can never be
required by love.  That's just a &quot;special relationship&quot; of manipulation,
rooted in fear, and is the antithesis of love. Similarly &quot;awe&quot; (leading one
to kneel) might be an appropriate and natural response of man to God, but if
it is *required* it ceases to be a gift, ceases to be freely given from
love, and becomes just a sham, a quid pro quo, currency offered for a trade,
another form of specialness and another form of manipulation, and another
trasngression of free will and genuine love.

&quot;God is&quot; is perhaps all that need be said.  God is certainly not cruel and
certainly *requires* nothing!
But &quot;T 9 I 18. You WILL hear the god you listen to&quot; is certainly worth
remembering!
