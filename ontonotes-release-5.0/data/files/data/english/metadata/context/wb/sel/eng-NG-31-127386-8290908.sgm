Subject: Harry Potter Movie.                                July 11, 2007.

Today I went to see the new movie called &quot;Harry Potter And The Order Of
The Order Of Thee Phoenix.  It's 2 and one half hours long.  I enjoyed
it very much and highly recommend it.

&quot;This is a tale of two m-racles and a message from beyond about how
we, as a group of humans can help h-al the earth and prepare ourselves
for the ascension. Light beings guided me to revive my four year old
son from d-ath's door and have given instructions as to how to revive
our earth and its inhabitants.&quot;

The Story

We are now in a time when natural disasters like hurricanes,
earthquakes, and tidal waves are dramatically affecting our planet,
and our lives on it. We now have the power to destroy this beautiful
Earth quickly, with a-omic power, or more slowly, with pollution and
devastation of our resources, and overpopulation. I have been guided
to tell you that we also have the very real power to save this planet,
and to make it a loving and healthy place for ourselves and for future
generations. Please take a few minutes to read my story. It will
hopefully save our Earth.
I have a story to tell you that I know will be hard to believe in
parts, but it has happened to me, and I cannot erase or deny any of it
(though at times I wish I could). I am a &quot;normal&quot; woman who grew up in
simple yet chaotic times. I am much like you in most every way. I always
thought I would be the last one to have a mi-acle occur in her life,
much less two mir-cles, and all that has happened since.
Therefore the tale I tell could be of your life, and not mine. But
seeing it is mine I guess I was meant to tell it.
What I want to establish first, is the fact that mira-les do happen
and they happen to people like you and me. What we need to make these
mirac-es happen is to open ourselves to the communication that is all
around us every day. Communication not from this world but from the
world of our creator, the cosmos and the universe. The message comes
from a distance, but you find it by going inside and believing. We can
all create mirac-es within our lives, and that is one of the main
points in writing this for you. I have no special tricks. Simply open
yourself to the possibility that what I tell you is possible and that
it is available to every person.
I will refer to G0d in many ways throughout this story. This is
strange for me to refer to Go- in any sense, as I believed he had
abandoned me a very long time ago.
But I will refer to a prime creator of the cosmos and the universe,
along with this earth that we live on every day. I call -od the Prime
Creator, because I want all those to understand that this story is
completely unbiased and unprejudiced to any affiliation with any
r-ligion, and the G-d of my understanding is not only an earthly Go-,
but a universal Go-. I will also refer to -od as mother earth, Gaia,
which I came to learn through this journey is the female piece of G-d.
As in everything that is in our universe, you must balance darkness with
light, peace with war, and recognize the two faces of Go-, the female
and the male. We are all pieces of this Prime Creator. We are a part of
-od.
Two miracl-s happened in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. My son and I
drowned in a flooded marsh and not only lived to tell the tale, but we
are better than ever. I was dead&quot; for fifteen minutes. I was told by
beings of light how to save myself, and my small son. And I was given a
message on how to he-l the Earth.
As you are reading this I ask you with all my heart to open yourself
to the possibility of what I say. I feel it is imperative that we unite
this world as one planet with one common goal - to establish peace and
prosperity for all, not just the select few who were blessed to be in
the right place at the right time. We are entering a new phase of
humanity and what I will tell you in this website will help us as a
r-ce to assimilate the changes that the future will bring.
I have not had Go- in my life for forty years.
I did however, as a child, chase the possibility of -od. I felt that
those people who had undying faith were the lucky ones, and the fact that
I believed in nothing made me the loser. As a child I often spoke to
Go-, but never felt heard or connected. It took life throwing me into a
flooded marsh and drowning me, to open my eyes to the reality of how much
we are all connected to the D-vine power. It is showing up now more than
ever. You can go on the internet and find thousands of hits about the
next phase of humanity, the era of enlightenment and the time of change.
These stories are in our re-igions and in the stories of the ancient
cultures such as the Mayans, the Egyptians and the Native Americans. We
have all been waiting for the moment when things would be different, for
surely -od will do something to save us from ourselves. Well there is
something in the works, but G-d is merely directing it through people
like me, and it will take the faith of people like you to create the
reality. Once again I am getting ahead of myself but in the messages I am
receiving, I am being given a way for us all to participate in a hea-ing
of mother earth, and a launching of the human ra-e into a time of health,
peace and positive change. But for this to happen, you will need to sit
in meditation for just one hour of your life.
I once heard in the star trek series resistance is futile.&quot; I did not
want to be a messenger for Go-, but when -od wishes our awakening, it
will happen. So now I will tell you the truth of what happened to me,
after a car accident that occurred in Nov. 2002.
My son and I were travelling to a friend's house for an afternoon of
play, when disaster hit. My car was swept into a flooded marsh after
hydroplaning. The car landed upside down in this boggy marsh, and sank
to the bottom. I tried to open the car's windows, but the power windows
failed and we were trapped inside. I spoke with my tiny son who was
four at the time, and assured him that mommy would get him out. The car
was filling up quickly with the cold murky water and I held
my son's coat tightly in my hand, while I waited to be fully
submerged. I hoped that I could open the door after the car
equalized with water and we would swim out. My final words to my
little boy as the water came over his head was &quot;hold your breath
honey; mommy will have us out soon&quot;. I watched him take a large
gulp of the remaining air, and the water took him. When I felt
the last air pocket escape the car I tried the door. It wouldn't
budge! The other door was equally stuck. I struggled with the
doors several times, to no avail. We were trapped and going to die.
At this point I took Evan's little body and pushed it over the
seat, hoping beyond hope that he would find air. As I struggled
to free us from this coffin on wheels, I realized I had to breathe.
As I drank the deep breath of water into my lungs, the fiery
feeling added panic to the moment. I wanted my baby back and I swung
my arms feverously about in an effort to find his body. I couldn't,
and I needed to breathe again. That is when I heard a voice, a calm
majestic voice, directing me to relax. This voice cooed in my ear,
reassuring me that all would be well. I was infused with the knowledge
that if I fought the water, my rescuers would not be able to revive
me when they arrived. The voice said that if I fought the water I
would drown …nd no s-it I thought, I get a wise a-s ghost on my
deathbed. The voice continued to give me instructions about what was
to happen, and that all would be well if I just followed the
instructions. I relinquished myself to this voice from beyond, and
passed quietly into the other side.
While on the other side I saw beings of light, who once again
assured me that my son and I would not only get out of this car, but
we would both be fine. They were definite in explaining that I must
follow instructions implicitly and not lose faith in their words. I
was told to have faith that I would be di-inely directed, and I was.
It took my rescuers fifteen minutes to pull my lifeless body from
that car, and another seven minutes of CPR to revive me. As my body
bolted upright, I blurted &quot;get my baby out of the car&quot;. Twenty two
minutes had passed, the rescuers jumped back into the freezing bog
to retrieve my son, knowing against hope, that he was d-ad. It took
rescuers another five minutes or so to get my boy free from that car.
His limp body was transported to the IWK Children's Hospital, where
he was immediately hooked to every machine known to mankind.

Here she tells how she was revived.

........................................................................
........................................................................

The team of emergency doctors and neurologists were waiting for me.
They assured me that my sweet little boy was indeed brain d-ad, and in
addition to this, his internal organs were full of b-ood. He was
haemorrhaging throughout his body and his organs were non- viable. Things
were the most bleak I have ever known. That is when the voice came to me
again. &quot;Have faith child.&quot; The doctors advised me to unplug my baby and
let him pass peacefully, for even if a miracle happened and he did live,
he would be a vegetable. &quot;No quality of life&quot;, is all I remember thinking.
Once again I heard the voice, &quot;have faith&quot;. For that moment the doctors
agreed to keep Evan on life support, but advised me not to hold out any
hope. He had less than one percent chance of living and then he would
continue to be hooked to all these machines for the rest of his life.
Remember, I had no G-d, so I could not even call for guidance. It was in
the quiet of my first moment alone, that I was given the instructions.
&quot;Follow the instructions implicitly&quot;, memories of the visions and the
voice in the lake flooded back to me. There was someone there with me, I
was sure of it, and I decided to listen carefully.
I was instructed to rebuild my son's aura by infusing his little body
with the auras of others. Twenty minutes at a time was one of the first
rules; for if it was longer, you would drain the aura of the giver. They
instructed me to parade loving people through Evan's room, each depositing
their own energy field into his lifeless body. They were to do this by
connecting their flesh to his flesh and allowing their energy to run
through his body, and then to give Evan their gift.&quot;
If they sang, they were to sing. If they were story tellers,
tell a story, and so on. Infuse him with positive energy and
your love and your talents, and this will revive him.
I proceeded against hospital protocol to send loving humans into
my son's room every half hour. They then followed the instructions
and gave their gift of love. This procession lasted twenty four hours
a day, for three days.
Dozens and dozens of people came. They &quot;camped out&quot; everyday and
every night; loving trusting s-uls infusing his lifeless
body with fresh energy. The fact that I was able to convince
the hospital to allow this unorthodox behaviour to happen was
a m-racle in itself, but on the third day, after 72 hours of
constant vigil, my boy opened his little eyes and recognized
me. He was back!!!
The doctors were baffled. They continued to tell me that he would
never walk or talk or be a normal child again. However their words
this time had no effect on me. The guidance and direction from my
sp-ritual light beings had proved to me beyond a shadow of a doubt
that he would be fine; after all, my &quot;friend&quot; in the lake had told
me so.
Within the first week Evan had recovered all his body functions, and
by the end of the second week, he was running down the halls to the
hospital playroom. This was indeed an incredible mir-cle. What had I
done to deserve such reprieve by our Almighty Creator? I didn't know
nor did I care. I wanted to take my son home and be done with the whole
nightmare. This is when I realized that I might be done with my light
friends, but they were not done with me.
I continued to hear the voices and be directed with both visions
and seeing auras. Needless to say, I was more than a little freaked out.
As time passed I would ask &quot;What do you want of me?&quot; They would speak
of the love for the universe and how things have gone terribly wrong.
Humanity has spiralled out of control, and has lost its true connection
to Go- and to this Earth. They want desperately for me to give the
humans of this world a message from &quot;beyond,&quot; that we have
inside of us the power to unite this planet as one r-ce with
peace and prosperity for all. This power lies inside us all,
and when combined with the loving energy of other humans, we
can do for this planet what we did for my son. We can revive
this Earth and catapult it into healing. With this healing
will come a new phase of humanity. We will have a time of
peace and harmony. All it will take is our intention, as a
united group, and one hour of our time.
So as the voices and visions unravelled I was given the guidance of
how to make this all happen. However it will take many of us on this
planet to see to the success of the project. As they told me to
rotate the humans through my son’s room, they have told me to unite
humanity from every corner of the globe. Not every human, just
representatives from every corner. We can do this. We need to unite
enough people to fire the d-vine energy system of this planet and
jump start it like we did with my boy.
This global project of loving intention is completely possible. Your
intention to make it happen can change the outcome of this planet. I
will discuss the details of the plan in phase three of this website. I
will give you the directions to follow, and you will see how little it
will take for you to become an ambassador of light to our home,
planet Earth. I beseech you to join me when we fire the Earth
grid on July 17, 2007 at 11:11 Greenwich Mean Time. I beseech you to
join me when we fire the on Earth and add your energy to this
project. I promise you, just one hour of your time and you can
help h-al this planet, and help create peace among all people.
My son and I are examples of the power of positive energy, and
what humans are truly capable of when they unite with the
intention of love.
Love is the universal language of our world, and the world beyond.
Light and love be with you and welcome to the next phase of
humanity; be part of the excitement and please join us.

This talks about some of the things that need correcting on the
Earth.

........................................................................
........................................................................

Problem.

Our earth can no longer support our present habits. She no longer
has the resources to supply enough o-l, wood or water to sustain all of
us living on this planet.
It is not coincidental that I am writing this problem at this time.
A prime example of the situation we truly face is looming down on us.
The price of oi- has skyrocketed and the problem will not rectify
itself. The basic supply and demand states that there is not enough -il
and the prices will continue to grow.
Also at this point in history we are striving to feed millions of people
throughout the world. Extreme poverty is rampant, especially in the
&quot;developing&quot; countries.
They say that right now, somewhere in the world a child d-es of hunger
every three seconds. This is another truth that will befall us all if we
choose to do nothing to regenerate our planet. We can not raise animals or
farm on land that is empty and barren, land that is full of pollutants
and demineralised beyond a usable state. This is where we are headed with
the farming of both animal life and vegetation. As twenty years ago we
could not fathom running out of o-l, many of you cannot imagine we will
run out of food. We believe there will never be a time that we cannot
sustain life on this planet with farming. If you believe that you are
gravely mistaken. Extreme poverty is rampant, please don’t allow the
fact that you can only see this on TV to desensitise you from the reality
that billions of people, the so called top of the food chain, are themselves
starving to death. Imagine how we treat the lesser animals of our creator.
Mother earth can no longer filter our pollutants. She is choking to d-ath
while we continue to pour more and more toxic solvents into her body. Earth
is a living being. She is alive and breathing, yet we continue to treat
her with complete disrespect and irreverence. Most like we treat each other.
I believe as a r-ce we have plundered the earth to this state of being. Not
only have we mistreated and taken for granted our home and provider but we
have also done the same to her inhabitants; the animals and plants. Within
the next twenty-five years there will not be enough clean water, wood or
fossil fuels left to continue supplying this planet with human essentials.
To put this is perspective; billions of us will be without food, fuel or
water by 2025.
Explain that to your grandchildren.
Another great concern is that our oceans are changing rapidly: in some
places they are warming, in others they are actually freezing because of
the melting polar caps.
The melting polar caps are sending millions of gallons of fresh water into
a salted ocean and the seas are actually desalinizing. This means the level
of salt in the ocean is diminishing and that in turn means the ocean
creatures and its vegetation will di- with the new water composition. This
is very dangerous to us all as our ocean is the lifeblood of this planet.
The Earth has always changed: once Antarctica had a tropical climate; once
Nova Scotia was actually a part of Africa and once dinosaurs thrived
everywhere. There is no preventing the natural ev-lution of the planet.
However, with our pollution we are causing global warming. And with our
n-clear testing we have shifted tectonic plates. And what goes into the
vast spaces left when we remove the oi- from the center of the Earth? We
are escalating global changes.
The severe and numerous hurricanes we have experienced in recent years
are clear signs that we must make changes in how we treat this planet, or
our lives will be dramatically altered.
Our world is full of a-ger and wa-, human against human destroying the
earth and millions of humans in the name of r-ligions and greed. As with
our resources, we are blazing through this planet, without regard.
Destroying all that is placed in its path. The next phase for our w-rring
planet is to take our sickened attitudes into space and bombard our
atmosphere with even more pollutants. Our g-vernments would have you
believe so greatly in global threats that they would risk our dear planet
by creating wa- in space. Please remember it is our go-ernments’s agenda
to raise money for w-rs. This money sustains the economy but -ar will
create destruction of us all and we must join in unison to insist that
our w-r does not become a cosmic wa-. If we are to destroy our planet it
must remain only our planet and not the galaxy.
I have mentioned several aspects of how we will eliminate the human r-ce
from this planet if we do nothing. I am not a chemist or Ph.D. in physics.
I am sure many of you are not accredited with expansive degrees either but
it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to resonate with the truth of my words.
I am including sites from many of the Ph.D. types for you to further
research and confirm what you already know, that we are indeed deeply in
trouble. The light beings have told me we can stop much of this harmful
behaviour and destruction if enough humans decide that they want to
become s-iritually connected. It is possible to re-form a grid connection
between us that will allow us to realign the energy of this planet and
with each other. They have told me that on July 17, 2007 11:11 Greenwich
Mean Time, there will be a surge of creation energy which will make our
reconnection possible. Please read about this in The Plan. There is
hope for a m-racle!

position we find ourselves in today.

Healing the World

by Owen Waters

As promised last week, this article will reveal a deeply powerful
technique to help you create a world filled with s-iritual peace, freedom
and creativity. When spiritual seekers are looking for effective ways to
change the world and they discover this technique, they are astounded at
how they become transformed into beacons of light for world healing.

This technique will be of special value to people participating in
the Fire The Grid celebration on Tuesday, July 17th, 2007. As detailed in
last week's article , the one-hour Fire the Grid event will begin at 11:11
am Greenwich Mean Time on Tuesday, 17th July, 2007. In British Summer Time,
using the 24-hour clock, that's 12:11 hours. For people in New York, it's
7:11 am. In Sydney, Australia it's 9:11 pm (or 21:11 hours) on July 17th,
and two hours later than that in New Zealand. For people in California, the
perfect cosmic hour starts at 4:11 am.

The organizers of the event are asking participants to allow the
healing power of the cosmos to flow freely through them and into the center
of the Earth. Then, to see this energy of healing love come out into the
atmosphere around the planet to fire the grid of human consciousness.

This show what is to be done.

..........................................................................
..........................................................................

The Plan
For the past two and a half years light beings have been communicating
with me frequently. At first, I was very uncomfortable with this, as it
was so foreign to what I believed and how I lived. But as time has gone
on, I have grown enormously in my f-ith in our creator, and my belief that
there is much more to life than what we generally physically experience.
There are other dimensions that are just as real as ours. And there are
forces of good that truly want to help us.
The light beings have explained to me that we are all connected by Source
energy. This connection has a grid-type confi1guration, so to make things
simple, I’m just calling it &quot;the Grid.&quot; There are small grids connected
to the large grid. For instance, each species of animal has its own grid.
This allows easy communication between animals. I’m sure you’ve wondered
how salmon know when to travel upriver to spawn, or how monarch butterflies
all know to fly to Mexico, or geese to fly in perfect formations. Their
connection to their grid allows them to know where to go and when to go.
In the Asian tsunami very few animals died. That is because they were
informed through their grids that danger was coming.
Human beings chose many thousands of years ago to disconnect themselves
from a collective grid, so that they could have free will. This severance
has allowed us to make our own decisions and be independent. But it has also
allowed us to make many mistakes which have adversely affected this planet.
And it has made our direct communication with The Source more difficult. We
are now at a turning point when our disconnection could mean the end of the
earth as it now exists.
You have just read about how this earth is being harmed by us. This is the
section I happily present as the plan to help remedy the situation in which
we find ourselves. This is the plan which will allow us to more fully
connect
to the earth grid and begin the healing of this planet. Together we will
reset Mother Earth with a bio-electric &quot;SURGE OF LOVE&quot; from humanity. When
we do sit in meditation simultaneously and fire the Grid for one hour, we
will unite the globe and connect all the regions of the earth
simultaneously.
In the process, we will unite our s-uls in love, peace, harmony and
collective
cooperation for a better world for our people, today and in the future.
The plan, was given to me by the same light beings that guided me while I
was drowning in the lake.
They have been with me since that time and have been delivering to me
information about our world and how we, with love and unification, can pour
our loving intention of peace and healing into this earth.
They want to set us on the path for a h-althy planet, viable and working
now, and for the generations that follow. They also want to direct us to the
way to enlightenment and union with the Divine.
The light beings use the term &quot;fire the grid&quot; when they speak of the
energizing of humanity with divine power, on July 17, 2007. They say firing
the grid will accomplish two things.
First, it will pulse he-ling energy into the center of the earth and
regenerate the core, or the heart of the planet. Just as we poured our
energy into my d-ing son, we will individually give the gift of our true
intention, the gift of our individuality and the gift of our he-ling
energy. As they explained, my son’s energy field was badly deteriorated,
as is the Earths. We must pour some of our living energy into the Earth,
and the accumulation of our combined energy will regenerate the Earth.
They told me humans are like little lightening rods, c-annelling G-d's
energy to the planet. Because we have separated ourselves from our complete
connection to The Source, by not having a fully functioning human grid,
Go-'s energy has not been able to easily flow into the Earth. If we choose
to come together to rebuild our grid, then the natural flow of energy
between us and -od, G-d and the Earth, and from person to person, will be
restored.  Do you see what a wonderful gift you will give?
This energy will live on eternally with the earth and its inhabitants;
the splendour of the creator’s intention for us realised in the creation
of this new energy field for our planet.
How do we do this you ask? The time has been set for 11:11 July 17,
2007 at Greenwich Mean Time.
I have been given no indication about why this date and time have been
chosen, but this date has been told to me over and over again.  I have been
asked to bring together as many humans as possible, throughout the world
from every corner of the globe, to simply sit and p-ay or meditate for
one hour during that time.  Hopefully, with your help, we will amass a
union of humans, such as the world has never seen. Loving humans with one
intention-to heal our planet and awaken our so-ls to our true purpose
to become one with our Source of Light.
This planned sitting of the people of earth will demonstrate the love
and faith we feel for the goodness of our world and her inhabitants. We
are the catalyst to the hea-ing of earth.  A true believer has the power of
ten fold, so if you only think you may believe, know that the faith of the
others will boost your own faith and the power will be intensified. That is
why we must all sit at the same time. We will feed each others power,
strengthening the force of delivery and compounding the energy we send into
the core of our home. Each and every one of us is important alone, but
together we are a very powerful source of creative energy. Remember we are
all a piece of G-d, and that energy of creation lives in all of us.
There are three types of humans today that will bring power to this
project.
First, we have those of you already practicing in an organized r-ligion. I
am not asking you to change any of your f-iths or truths, just know that if
the -od of your understanding is truly omnipotent, then all things are
possible - so why not this. What better use of our human energy and pra-er
than to hea- the earth and unite mankind with -od's grace and goodness.
Then we have those who have been searching outside the organized re-igions
to find a different, more individual way in which to believe and live in the
light of our creator. We each search for a more individual way in which to
know G-d. These people I refer to as the new a-e light workers. These light
workers will feel the truth of these words and will simply know deep inside
that the plan of which I speak is indeed a truth, a clear direction in which
you can be of assistance to the Earth.
The fence sitters make up the third type. I call you fence sitters because
you truly wish you had fa-th but the state of the world has beaten any fa-th
out of you.
You long for the loving touch of fai-h; however you feel that -od has
abandoned us. Two and a half years ago this was me. I had become hardened to
the reality of the world and had no f-ith that Go- would ever intervene and
save us. I was angry at G-d for letting us down and delivering us such
chaos.
However I have seen that Go- has only provided us with that which we
desired.
We believed we were s-nners and not worthy of Go-s love. We were lost to the
fact that we are a piece of -od and therefore able to participate in our
lives
with the Creator. Now to all of you who were like me, I issue a challenge.
Suspend your scepticism for just one hour of your life, and just sit, alone
or with others, to think about the beauty of this planet, to appreciate all
that you have and all that you are, and to give hope for an improved
future for us all.
This plan involves only one hour from each of us. Our combined energies
will work to direct energy to the Earth and to each other. I ask you to
choose the way in which you deliver your intention. For those of you that
pr-y, then pra- for the hour asking for the faith and power to accomplish
this tremendous task. Those of you, who meditate, meditate and see the
intention of your thoughts swirling deep inside our earth delivering the
love and healing. Those of you who have no ritual of fa-th may simply
develop one that works for you. If you sit quietly and repeat a phrase of
your intention such as I offer you my energy to h-al this world and its
people.&quot; Any positive words of hope, love and desire for change will
manifest these thoughts as reality - our new reality. If possible, gather
with others during this hour. I have found that the intensity of my
meditation heightens when I am sharing the experience with other people.
On my journey to building this website I have been enchanted by the music
of
http://www.apsismusic.com
Bradfield
and
http://www.anael.net
Anael
They have been playing the background music for this website. I have been
informed by my light friends that the frequency of the song &quot;
http://www.firethegrid.com/eng/downloads.htm
Sky Sent&quot; will facilitate the opening of the so-l and help with the
frequency
adjustment. As we enter a time of more loving energy the frequencies of our
earth will heighten. The tonal frequencies of this song awaken a sleeping
piece of our soul to remind us of the potential within us all. This song is
available for download, and if you listen carefully with your heart, you
will
not only hear the truth in the words but your body will feel the stirrings
of
remembering who you really are. We need only open ourselves to this
possibility to feel the music’s gift. For those of you interested in
expanding yourselves with other loving tones built into music I suggest
you experience
http://www.apsismusic.com
Buddha Spirit, a meditation CD by the same artists, or the
http://www.apsismusic.com
Sp-ritual Beings on a Human Journey
CD by Anael, from which &quot;Sky Sent&quot; originates. This music will facilitate
with
the ascension process. You are a part of G-d entitled to all the wonder and
splendour of the Creator’s earthly gifts. [Ed.: The background music playing
on
this website is from the album
http://www.apsismusic.com
Within our Reach.
This project is going to work. Remember this process brought back a dy-ng
boy, and I have been promised it will work on a global scale if we can find
the humans to participate. In the Bi-le, it is said that they could not save
Sodom and Gomorrah for want of ten good people. We are being offered the
opportunity to save ourselves by offering only an hour of our lives. We can
call out to the universe that Earth has good people here. We can show the
Di-ine
creator that there are enough of us here who truly want to ev-lve and become
what we were intended to be.
I have been told that help is being sent to us. We can help create a
mi-acle.
My son is now running out in the yard, delighting in his life. A mir-cle
saved him. This gift of Div-ne energy, and our willingness to help make it
happen, will save us all. Please join us on July 17, 2007 at 11:11 Greenwich
Mean time to bring the power of Go-’s love to us all. In choosing to
participate you will be defining your intentions to the universe and you
will
also be defined as a human who desires positive change for this planet.
and ignite a beacon of light in your s-ul so that we may be recognized by
the world, the universe and each other.
