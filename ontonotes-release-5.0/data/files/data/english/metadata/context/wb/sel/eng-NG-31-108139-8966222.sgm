For full understanding of how Maxwells laws were generated one has to
check if eny proviso's were written in.
Ffor instance I suspect that there was a proviso for equilibrium in
every law thar Maxwell used for his summation ofr laws there was an
exceptance by all the masters that without equilibrium the who univere
would fall apart.
Some where along the line somebody deviated from this proviso and made
the assumption that at every point on a radiator can be seen as a sino
soidal current that causes radiation because the assumption was needed
to conform with Maxwells laws while ignoring the dictae of the masters
that the laws of the universe is bound by
by equilibrium so the assumption was conncocted to &quot;solve&quot; the 1/2
wave problem. Can anybody versed in the art point to one of the many
laws at his time were not based on equilibrium. In other words did any
of the work he used specifically addres things that were NOT in
equilibrium to justify its use for items not in equilibrium to
substantiate the use of Maxwells laws to derive its function. Being a
mechanical engineer I am not well informed
of all the doings of the masters

Hi Arthru,

Which, of course, means you didn't check.  A flash of ignorance is
hardly an ignition point to start a thread with - but it does provide
suitable tender for a flame.  :-0

back again art??  still stuck on 'equilibrium'???   'equilibrium' is a nice
catch word.  and yes, many 'masters' heartily believed that everything had
to be in 'equilibrium' with something or another.  but we have come a long
way since then.  there can be no energy flow between things in equilibrium,
and we all know there is energy flowing in antenna elements.  if there
wasn't they wouldn't radiate.  and we can directly measure it with current
and voltage probes.  so while maybe the static case of coulomb's law may be
said to represent 'equilibrium', none of the others needs that... in fact
none of the others would exist if everything was in 'equilibrium'.  the
current, curl, and d/dt parts of the equations are all a representation of
non-equilibrium conditions that must exist for those equations to be of any
use.  so get out of the 19th century and into the 21st and join the rest of
us in the understanding of the dynamic world around us!

Well David my checks on books on the subject that revealed that all
Maxwells laws
conform to standard boundary conditions. When I started enlarging the
static law of statics I was cogniscent of the fact that the same
boundary conditions must exist to maintain plausability. This forced
me to make sure that the additions within the boundary must not alter
the boundary aproach. I could not uset 1/2 wave antennas be3cause that
violates the laws laid down by Maxwell in all his laws so I used full
wave radiators to continue, after all it xcannot be a law if you have
to make asumptions. I applied a time varying field to make it dynamic
so that it conforms to Maxwell
laws Thus in effect my aproach should be considerfed law
Now we come back to existing aproaches of present day scientists and
they have chosen to ignore the required conditions and in its place
started to apply assumption which you are not allowed to do with laws
only theories. Scientists and others further violated existing laws
ala Maxwells laws which are based upon equiulibrium in all cases and
used it where it is not applicable.
Now all computor programs are based around Maxwells LAWS so how come
it is  used in violation of those same laws?
I followed the boundary laws in my expansion of Gaussian law where the
results conform to Maxwell and as I have described earlier the tank
cuicuit is the result but without having to make assumptions
assumptions because I abided by LAW. At the same time it clearly
prooves that asuumptions made by scientists and programmers are
clearly in error of itself. Since I like to do things from first
principles it was my responserbilty to ask electrical people and those
familiar with the state of the art that the principles I used were
&quot;not out of date&quot; ie now revised. One response came from a ham with a
Doctorate working for MIT. He clearly stated that mathematics support
my approach and showed how they were in conformance with Maxwells
LAWS. Nobody concurred with his finding and none supplied reasons why
except that 'you can't do that'! So until somebody of stature
challenges his confirmation I stand my ground. Now W7el is making a
living from programs that are applying Maxwells LAWS to items within a
boundary that are NOT in equilibrium which is INCORRECT. Others by the
way deny the existance
of boundary Laws ala equilibrium as if it does not mean anything.
Ofcourse programmers say I only copied what the government released
ala if it is printed in a book it must be correct so perhaps there is
a computor programmer around as to why he continous to use erroneos
methods for programming with respect to radiators!

ok... now if you have a LAW that is different than what is put down in the
existing maxwell's 4 equations you must be able to write the equations that
make your law different than his.  if you can't do that, its no better than
a bag of hot air.  so show your calculations, write a paper, get it
published and show the rest of the world that uses those equations and gets
perfectly valid results why we are all wrong.

I'd ignore him. The moron can't even read properly...
I see no text written where you tell Art to shut up, or even write at
a lighter
shade of print for that matter..
I think &quot;John Smith&quot;, or &quot;Bret&quot;, or whoever the heck he really is,
would prefer
that Art brainwash all the unsuspecting readers into thinking what he
writes
is true fact without question. Who cares if it's total BS or not, it's
new!
&quot;John Smith&quot; doesn't care if it's all BS or not, just as long as it's
some
new theory that seems to contradict old established theory.
He has shown repeated disdain for proven established theory.
He thinks that being most that wrote it are either dead, or in an
advanced
age state, that obviously it can't fit in with the &quot;New World Order&quot;
of
code toads that dabble with antennas on occasion.
After all, most lived decades ago. What could they possibly know
compared to a code toad that is living in the early part of the 21st
century?

I envision him as the type that probably believes most of what he
hears on
Coast to Coast AM..

Did I mention that he's a prime time smartass?
Probably not needed, being you got a taste first hand.
Don't worry about looking like an idiot. Anyone with half a brain can
see where that dubious honor really belongs..
It might have to be shared by two people though...   :/
But at least Art is not really a smartass. I'll give him that.. He's
just
confused... I have much less problem with that, than I do a smartass.
Art is confusing the minds of new or unsuspecting readers with all
his &quot;theory&quot; though. Thats why he gets so much flak.
Some of his stuff makes the &quot;EH&quot; antenna guy actually look sane
by comparison.. And thats kinda scary... :/

&gt; &gt; Well David my checks on books on the subject that revealed that all
&gt; &gt; Maxwells laws
&gt; &gt; conform to standard boundary conditions. When I started enlarging the
&gt; &gt; static law of statics I was cogniscent of the fact that the same
&gt; &gt; boundary conditions must exist to maintain plausability. This forced
&gt; &gt; me to make sure that the additions within the boundary must not alter
&gt; &gt; the boundary aproach. I could not uset 1/2 wave antennas be3cause that
&gt; &gt; violates the laws laid down by Maxwell in all his laws so I used full
&gt; &gt; wave radiators to continue, after all it xcannot be a law if you have
&gt; &gt; to make asumptions. I applied a time varying field to make it dynamic
&gt; &gt; so that it conforms to Maxwell
&gt; &gt; laws Thus in effect my aproach should be considerfed law
&gt; &gt; Now we come back to existing aproaches of present day scientists and
&gt; &gt; they have chosen to ignore the required conditions and in its place
&gt; &gt; started to apply assumption which you are not allowed to do with laws
&gt; &gt; only theories. Scientists and others further violated existing laws
&gt; &gt; ala Maxwells laws which are based upon equiulibrium in all cases and
&gt; &gt; used it where it is not applicable.
&gt; &gt; Now all computor programs are based around Maxwells LAWS so how come
&gt; &gt; it is  used in violation of those same laws?
&gt; &gt; I followed the boundary laws in my expansion of Gaussian law where the
&gt; &gt; results conform to Maxwell and as I have described earlier the tank
&gt; &gt; cuicuit is the result but without having to make assumptions
&gt; &gt; assumptions because I abided by LAW. At the same time it clearly
&gt; &gt; prooves that asuumptions made by scientists and programmers are
&gt; &gt; clearly in error of itself. Since I like to do things from first
&gt; &gt; principles it was my responserbilty to ask electrical people and those
&gt; &gt; familiar with the state of the art that the principles I used were
&gt; &gt; &quot;not out of date&quot; ie now revised. One response came from a ham with a
&gt; &gt; Doctorate working for MIT. He clearly stated that mathematics support
&gt; &gt; my approach and showed how they were in conformance with Maxwells
&gt; &gt; LAWS. Nobody concurred with his finding and none supplied reasons why
&gt; &gt; except that 'you can't do that'! So until somebody of stature
&gt; &gt; challenges his confirmation I stand my ground. Now W7el is making a
&gt; &gt; living from programs that are applying Maxwells LAWS to items within a
&gt; &gt; boundary that are NOT in equilibrium which is INCORRECT. Others by the
&gt; &gt; way deny the existance
&gt; &gt; of boundary Laws ala equilibrium as if it does not mean anything.
&gt; &gt; Ofcourse programmers say I only copied what the government released
&gt; &gt; ala if it is printed in a book it must be correct so perhaps there is
&gt; &gt; a computor programmer around as to why he continous to use erroneos
&gt; &gt; methods for programming with respect to radiators!
&gt; &gt; Best regards
&gt; &gt; Art Unwin KB9MZ....XG

&gt; ok... now if you have a LAW that is different than what is put down in the
&gt; existing maxwell's 4 equations you must be able to write the equations that
&gt; make your law different than his.  if you can't do that, its no better than
&gt; a bag of hot air.  so show your calculations, write a paper, get it
&gt; published and show the rest of the world that uses those equations and gets
&gt; perfectly valid results why we are all wrong.- Hide quoted text -

Sooner or later you will have to act your age.
The tank circuit is a electrical circuit that is also the circuit
of a full wave radiator regardless of how the extended mathematics and
my work
portrays. It clearly shows that release of energy by shorting the
energy source
is how an efficient radiating system works i.e two energy sources
continuing a pendulum swing
as it were. Attack that if you wish since the books validate that
without reference to equilibrium or Gauss.
It stands on its own. If you end feed a folded full wave length dipole
you will get an answer that Maxwells laws will verify and was tried
out by a guy named Frank who I do not know using NEC 4 antenna
computing program and found to be correct. Nobody but nobody has
presented anything that point out errors in any of this.
Now I come to the second point. I would have thought that radiation of
a 1/2 wave dipole would concurr with that of
a full wave end fed radiator but it doesn't. Why is that? When I try
to feed it at the end voltage becomes a problem
as there is no energy receptical available which is illustrated by the
socalled end effects where the voltage has nowhere to go but into the
atmosphere directly with it being contained to a specific frequence
given by the radiators
length so certainly it does not connect with the tank circuit of a
full wave.
So now we can also take a look at the electrical circuit of a half
wave end fed radiator where we come up with a series circuit but no
evidence of what starts the radiation and in fact the circuit has none
of the character istics shown by the tank circuit and does not provide
any clues as to what creats radiation, this all experts agree upon.
Nobody but nobody has ever been able to describe radiation.
Now based on the parallel circuit I profer the following. Static
particles are allowed to rest on diagmatic materials
and possibly paramagnetic materials each of which cannot retain a
magnetic field. All other materials are bound with specific electrons
that repulse static particles. From the same gaussian laws which when
expanded the way I stated
is directly related to present dynamic laws such that on a full length
radiator there are particles at rest and I might add decaying.It is
reasonable to assume that the instant release of energy overcomes the
inertia of the static particles and push them awayby fracturing the
arbitary field. Those that do not escape return to the radiator
surface
which is now fully occupied with static particles thus forcing the
particle to burrow under the surface providing skin effect of decay.
The next release of energy does the same thing but fracture or
penetrates the arbitary border at a different place producing
radiation other than that of a planar array or any other array not in
equilibrium.
As for the half wave there is nothing that suggests any similarity to
the tank circuit, no suggestion that energy release is from two energy
sources but evidence that there is not one to contain the voltage
swings/.
Now the tank circuit shows that beyond the frequency band edges there
is a strong dip in filter pass abilities so the radiation is retained
within a certain spectrum. In a series circuit the spectrum does not
have a pass filter
and infact the end effect is really the escape of energy to the
atmosphere without a containment within the desired frequency spectrum
so clearly it is not operating efficiently which also suggests that
the driven energy is not fully matched to the impedance of the antenna
itself which again suggests that because it not resonate in circuit
terms the feed line is invaded to correct the situation.
So be my guest. End feed a half wave radiator and a endfed  full wave
radiator and then compare.
The new shortened antenna from the university of R.I. is a good place
to start where those  who are familiar with the state of the art state
that the feed line has been

Bull. A ham who holds a doctorate and works for MIT provided the
corroberating details.
It is not my fault that your mathematical knoweledge and education
could not keep up with him which is the same for all others on the
thread. Nobody but nobody could fault his mathematics and you call
that just &quot;hand waving&quot;?
David it was you who led the charge and consistently stated that you
can't apply a time varient to a static field and refused to
acknowledge that the math supplied that concurred with Maxwells laws
relying only on the fact that it came from your own mouth so it must
be correct. Now that I call &quot;handwaving&quot; all mouth and no facts
proffered to confirm your opinions or guesstimates. Now you say you
should be able to take a &quot;challenge&quot; well I invite any scientifically
based challenge some thing I have hoped for in a long while from the
self professeed experts and am still waiting.
I can understand opinions from hobbiests you have joined the ranks of
ham radio but for those skilled in the art and have gone thru the
reqimen of getting a degree or obtaining the rights of a professional
engineer one would expect a more factual debate on the subject. If you
don't understand the subject then you default your right to critisize.
Now I have Richard firing his nonsense across my bow with the

Science is about building on the foundations of the past and not about
throwing away books. The old methods of calculation still work fine, its
just that in the light of new knowledge we can refine the methods to produce
more accurate results. All of our achievements to date have been built on
the foundations laid down by past generations and it is foolish and
dangerous to dismiss or ignore any part of history. Never, ever throw away a

Fully understood. Odd thing is that 73 magazine used to make a good
living by printing details of various antenna
building and I admit I built a few of them.Ihave described the
modifications needed for the new university antenna and for some
reason see no reason to build it because it is a dud. I know you built
the university antenna to check it out for yourself but I don't know
of anybody who did the same thing to verify the claim. So it goes for
the simple modification I supplied which if I am wrong gives loads of
ammunition to every body to shoot me down once and for all with
factual details but they seam scared to search for the truth. In the
absence of knoweledge usually resort to insults and name calling and I
see you got such a burst today. Remember that time when a guy appeared
with his new NEC 4 program and wanted to model a simple arrray I
supplied? Nobody would help him in checking things out and it took a
personal E mail from somebody who did not want to be identified to
help him with the proper useage of the program. It proved the veracity
of what I had supplied dispite the lachof assistance to prove me
wrong.
As yet nobody with knoweledge of the state of the art has taken me on
with respectto what I have discovered. I have had posts given where I
believe the central theme was poetry, others who said they couldn't
understand despite posts given by a Doctrate holder, ofcourse there
are many like the blasting that you just got which should invite back
the multi posters that decimated several newsgroups. What I am doing
is sharing my work so all can enjoy but if hams are satisfied with
lesser antennas because of the poor conditions so be it. But to try
and stop thespreading of a particular advance to protect their so
called resumes as being experts is really hard to fathom. I thought it
would be a delight to all if somebody refuted the mathematics given
but only silence reigned and then joined by name calling. Look at
todays posting, how many were devoid of insults and name calling, I
think that they finished up in the majority so what does that say
antenna talk by hams?
I am beginning to wonder with the spectrum being in such demand if the
FCC would be justified in selling the amateur frequencies since it is
certainly not the same when the frequencies were given, a listen to
repeaters or a review of newsgroups going ons must fraustrate them
very much. After the upcomming sale of frequencies which is in demand
by industry I can easily see pressure on ham frequencies which is
costing not contributing to the coffers. The idea that we are a public
necessity was down graded years ago by industries inovative ideas so
hams have a hard time now justifying their position. In the past it
was often said that it was amatures that advanced the cusp of the
science well we sure are not doing that now!
O well let the discussion move away from mathematical analysis of
antennas or new designs and get back to argueing and calling people
names e.t.c. so all can participate including those who are true
hobbyist that do not wish to concern themselves with the engineering
background but who also want to participate in the augument side that
most hams relish.

I have gonedown that road also in the past. As one programmer stated
Antenna programs are not perfect and neither are you. They do not
adhere to Maxwells laws
because some have taken the libity to insert assumptions when things
don't work out.
Mathematicians usually find a constant to insert if they are not sure
of mathematical difference
or their mods don't work. You can do that with a theory because it has
not been confirmed but an electrical LAW
stands alone as being correct as it stands. Just imagine using Ohms
law with a fudge factor inserted where you have to insert a fuse to
take care of it! Even when dealing with superconductors there are
numurous provisos with respect to an ifnittessimle length that are
&quot;solved with mathematical technics. With my amateur thesis that is on
un ... @sdsc.edu plus other letters and attillas I wrote down the tears
that the head of the nuclear industry in Russia stated with the
reliance on the computors ability to do multiple equations every
minuite of the dayin the hope that one answer fits the bill or at
least it will if you add constants where it deviates from what you
want!
However the assumptions used in this case finally worked out for 100
years and where it doesn't work
in the present computor era then you didn't follow the restrictions
that come with adding assumptions

John you are preaching to the converted! Cecil is known for standing
his ground
on technical matters despite the howls and catcalling. His posts
easily exceed a hundred or so
because he rarely get a reasonable technical response in this group.
That ofcourse takes a lot of tenaccity and visits to the texas
university library and I could never do that because the group would
attack the library contents. I prefer to hammer on the same subject a
bit over time for several years as you can see in the archives on
Gaussian antenna, this seasons you to laughing at the comments instead
of taking it personal because it becomes obvious what the technical
level is of the poster. No problem hobbiest having thought and
theories and stories of magnificent performance of a wire that rests
in a gutter and then drops to the ground so that they are part of ham
radio that produces statement that &quot;my antenna is best because every
thing I hear I can work&quot; Or &quot;every thing is known about antennas&quot;! or&quot;
we already have good antennas so why do we need to know how they
work&quot;. But when they take on a technical mantle without the require
engineering regimen it can be very very funny.

Art:

Far too many times, I have been present during discussions where a
&quot;newbie&quot; (one not well schooled in the amateur-antenna-religious-order)
discusses some weird idea(s) he proposes to set in aluminum/copper and
insulation.  And, far too often I have seen him discouraged and &quot;converted.&quot;

What the heck, let 'em try it, someone just may hit the lotto!--but
then, I have seen the &quot;hidden errors&quot; in current knowledge.

Frankly, I love the fact data/knowledge exists which has been so
explored as to let us, immediately, construct &quot;canned antennas&quot; with
excellent performance characteristics (or at least functional/usable
characteristics.)

Is it so difficult to allow some to explore less conventional designs,
methods, ideas, experiments?  From what I have seen, most who explore
these &quot;dark arts&quot; have already explored commonly constructed antennas
and yearn for some diversion (or, perhaps wish something for a special
purpose--for example stealth!)

For those who walk to the beat of a different drummer--I'll keep the
light on for 'ya, 'ya all hear?  Just have the fortitude to take the
slings and arrows ...

So whose facts do I use to build my antenna?

Do I use facts that I have already used to build operable antennas that
function as claimed, or do I use facts that to my knowledge have not
ever been used build an antenna, but facts that only make for almost
impossible to read text in a Usenet group?

It doesn't define one as close minded to note that extraordinary claims
require proof at the same level.

wouldn't simple proof be a lot easier than declaring all who disagree as
enemies of one sort or another?

Build one of those bad boys, put it on an antenna range, test it out and
let the decibels fall where they may. All else is just netnews s/n.

Proof would shut us close minded ones up would it not? Then the antenna
will become status quo, and we will rush to defend it.

You could look in the archives for this year and look up the &quot;Davis&quot;

Sorry to hear that Dr Davis must have removed his comments and data
after the group teed him off
one too many times. They are in my ongoing patent requests so sooner
or later they will
come to light again. I think I may have reproduced it on the
un ... @sdsc.edu pages but I am not sure.
Ofcourse I did have some of my work overchecked on this by professor
with a P.E. who did it via NEC 4 before I placed my first patent
request since each request at the PTO is around $500 and that is only
the beginning costs
so it pays to have the basics reviewed without your presence so you
are not throwing money away' especially if you have a series of
patents going thru based on the original discovery.

Hi Arthru,

&quot;Not sure&quot; seems to be the keyword.  Lack of details, lack of
background, lack of examples, and lack of understanding (no shortage
of ersatz thinking) reveals to others what is not obvious to you:
an email address is not a web page

Dear Michael from the past I was called every name under the sun on
past patents
This time I gave the basis of the mathematics, I gave a array of full
wave
elements that was checked independently on this newsnet. I also put
up a page
with the data and drawings from a static field ala Gauss on to a
dynamic form
where it can be verivied by computor programs.
All I got was jeers and insults there is nothing more that I can do
other what I have done
I can't make you make one even with instructions and I am not giving
out gifts.
Oh and you got the benefit of Dr Davis's mathematical analysis to boot
before the group dissed him to.

vogue (and, I am stuck in one--for a bit anyway :-( ), a beach, etc., etc.

have a REAL place ... it is only the idiots who shout down everyone else

antennas to expand ... I can't believe I am the only one;  I am just
more vocal to their importance.

I have already had complaints about the American Flag flying on my 50
ft. pole, so far, NOT flying the flag has appeased the &quot;complainers&quot;--go
figure!  Any day now, they will eventually notice the pole is still
there.  Then I'll be stuck with the DLM posing as a drain pipe ...

And, there are errors and missing sections in our complete understanding
of antennas, em/photon radiation, etc.--those who will bother to examine
the evidence already know this--those who are either unable or unwilling
to do so never will.

I spoke boldly, and of course, in too broad of terms--the reasons for

It's not that anyone is against new ideas, antennas, etc,

Just don't feed us a turd and call it a steak if one can't even
take the trouble to build a working example to test.   :/
If I had some new whiz bang antenna cooked up, I would build
and test one first, and then talk about it later if it actually was
proven to work.
Art goes the other route. He talks a great storm, but nothing is
ever produced to actually test in the real world.
As far as I see it, that is no way to live.

It is no problem to me if you don't make one. Listen out for me when
it gets cold on 160 meters. I have a rotatable one about 2 foot square
that will be on the tower but at the moment I am adding to it to make
it an all bander maybe all frequency with two rotators for horizontal
and vertical radiation. But then if you can't hear me then you can't
work me.

you can see the test or operate it so you will have to continue to

If you put out a decent signal, I should hear you.
I'll be out in the country using big antennas.
Heck, I already have a full size 160m dipole up there.
I was there Sept 1... I converted my old 80/40 dipoles
to add two more bands. Now I have 160,80,40,20 dipoles
on a single feedline. I eventually plan some type of
vertical for transmitting. Probably a wire running up a
tall tree. And yes, I'll be using a few of those obsolete
old radials to ensure the ground losses don't eat my
lunch.
And as you have probably already noticed, I have plans for
beverages up there. I'll have a big small loop too..
If you operate, and put out any kind of decent signal,
I should be able to hear you with little trouble.

I don't need to find it. I was here when it all went down.
As I recall, Richard asked him a few pertinent questions, and
he did a runner..
Myself, I think once he finally got a clue what you were proposing,
he decided to duck and cover his rear.. I know he has not been
back to answer the fairly simple questions posed to him.
BTW, if you do decide to get out on 160m to test this antenna,
please do us all a favor and ensure that the feedline is not doing
the bulk of the radiating.
I'll be going back up there in middle-late Oct when the trees
start turning colorful if you want to try it out.

Hi Arhtur,

Not worth repeating, is it?  Such recommendations fall into a familiar
pattern, especially when you can't find your own page.

Well, still and all it bears visiting those archives to read how each
of your claims blows your last one out of the air as being the height
of stupidity.

Efficient directors are longer than driven elements.
(&quot;Time to Burn the books, the early tour.&quot;)

More efficient reflectors are shorter than the driven element. (Unless
you need two reflectors which are even MORE efficient.)

Short antennas are vastly more efficient because halfwaves are too
long.  (Good by two reflectors.)

Long (halfwave) antennas are exceedingly more efficient because they
were blessed by a heretical disciple of Gauss.  (Goodbye directors and
reflectors altogether.)

Longer (fullwave) antennas are fantastically more efficient because
they....
(Goodbye Gauss, here's another spade of mud in your face.)

Well, at least the jokes aren't all the same, but superlatives are
getting stretched thin.

Imagine the embarrassment of this mythical Dr. Phil whose name is
being pasted to every theory coming out of central Illinois!

OK, so he only dresses like Dr. Phil.  Let's see what he actually had
to offer and we find that any support (the word Gauss misapplied) for
arT has been spun up out of whole cloth.

Arthru has discovered a button of Dr. Phil's, sewed it to a coat,
looked in the pocket of the coat and found a paper, on this paper aRt
writes his theory and puts it back into the coat to give us a glowing
reference of authorship to the grand Dr from MTA!

For discovery of a button a battle was one.

;-)  ;-)  ;-)  Art spoiler, the following is a joke  ;-)  ;-)  ;-)

These theories of &quot;efficiency&quot; are like the Republicans giving us back
our own money - meanwhile the prostituted dollar has plummeted,  a
barrel of oil has nearly tripled in price, the deficit went sky-hi,
and Greenspan is spitting on the White House.  Soon we will all be as
rich (oops, efficient) as sub-Saharan Africans.  At least jobs have
picked up in this era of efficiency, it is now vastly easier picking
fly shit out of sand.

I just read that thread all again, even Richards which I have stopped
reading now.
One thing he says comes to mind&quot; the antenna was invented some 100
years ago&quot; but nobody asked where it is illustrated so that they can
see the proof. Rather than pursuing me for data and calling me names
get Richard to show where it is in the antenna books so you can see
the results for your selves. Ofcourse Richard is known for his lies so
I wouldn't hang around to long for his answer because as I stated he
is a liar. He also said he agreed with it all along from some prior
reading but David decided for the moment not to challenge him because
that infered that time can be added to BOTH sides of the equation
which David states one cannot do. O what a web one weaves when they
step down and try to deceiveI But he did get the Doctor    to leave in
the same way he has got other experts to leave
purely on the smell of his retorts. I think I will drop out on this
one somebody will surely rake thru all the antenna books of old to
verify Richards fallacioes statments. I am gone for a while to do
things with the antenna before it gets to cold. After reading that
long thread people will never accept that any thing new can come
about
antennas which is why most have departed from that scene and moved to
agitating on newsgroups
Bye Bye, don't know when I will come back so you will have to decide
now who will be the recipient of your arrows and slander from now on.

Absolutely. Build and test. Get on the air and work. Put one up on a

I always kind of wondered about the accusations thrown about here. If
they are true, there there appears to be a sizable group of Hams (and

I really think Arts game is to try to get someone else to do his work for
him. If not that he is suffering from delusions of granduer. Sad thing is I
have heard Arts story before in another time and place. I knew a guy that
was truly a mechanical genius but wasted it repairing bank tabulating
equipment back in the 60s &amp; 70s when everything was mechanical. When he
retired after everything was taken over by computers he got interested in
Ham Radio, particularly interested in antennas. Many of the mistakes he made
are the same as Arts. The same mistake about efficiency.

Jimmie:

Actually, you make a good point.  But, I think we are all guilty of it;
or at least I am, I tend to try to focus attention on my personal
antenna endeavors/experiments/needs.

Not everyone needs a perfect, small, highly efficient, stealthy antenna
... but then, not every needs a stacked pair of 5 element yagi-udas'.

And, mistakes?  I am looking forward to the day I have made 'em
all--maybe then I will get relief from having 'em pointed out to me!  ;-)
