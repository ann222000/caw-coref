When Taiwan's President Chen Shui Bian came to power he promised US
not to rock the status quo ie no provocation such as declaration of
independence.

Now, as more and more corruption allegations surfaced involving CSB
himself and his immediate family, CSB and his party's popularity has
droped to less than 20%. Of the 20% most are hardcore Taiwan
separatists. While the mainstream Taiwanese overwhelmingly supported
the status quo, the extremists firmly believe that if they can provoke
a war, US and Japan will defeat China. This is dispite of the fact
that US State department has repeated warned Taiwan that if they
provoke a war US has the option of not supporting them.
Prsesident CSB in an interview with the BBC claim that US has an
obligation to defend Taiwan. The next day, the state department came
up with a statement saying that the Taiwan Relation act only committ
US &quot;to help Taiwan&quot;.

The latest friction arises from Taiwan's attempt to re-join the UN.
To make it more provocative CSB wanted to use &quot;Taiwan&quot; instead of the
constitutional name of Republic of China.

US can't understand why CSB is doing this as the chance Taiwan gaining
sufficient support internationally is almost zero.
It appears to be designed purely to stire up tension so that US and
Japan can be drawn into a conflict with China.
To add more kick to his provocation CSB wanted to hold a referendom.
In the last two weeks US State Department has spoken twice opposing
such a refendom.
IMO, Bush is getting very annoyed with CSB for 3 reasons.
1) US was never consulted prior to all these provocative act.
2) CSB and his extremists supporters came out one by one claiming that
US will back them up.
3)CSB appears to be playing US domestic politics with Bush, hiring
people to buy support in the Congress to pressure Bush.
(So far Bush's neocon allies are silent).

I doubt that Taiwan internal policies are determined in Washington.

U r entitled to ur opinion, but Bush is making it clear to CSB that
unless US is first consulted he will ve no part in any conflict
started by CSB.
There are people in USA who ve knee jerk response to anything with
&quot;china&quot;.
CSB is counting on them to pressure Bush, but so far they ve remain
silent. This has been going on for months now.

The Taiwan separatists is a very unique brand of nationalism in that
they pin their hope entirely on USA. The Taiwan military is still
heavily influenced by the old KMT officers are not willing to fight
for an independent Taiwan.

What do you think the odds are of a peaceful re-unification?

My understanding is that Chinese (Mandarin) is the official language of
Taiwan,
they use Chinese currency, and of course the strong business relations
between Taipei and Bejing.

Chinese and China do not bother me at all. Â The communists do bother
me because they are a gang of mass murderers who need to be brought to
justice. Â Communism always leads to mass murder. Â Tianeman Square was
not an aberration but is the norm for communism.

It's a very difficult question to answer.
Ironically, the side most likely, and eager to start a confict is the
Taiwan separatists. Their reasoning being that mainland with a
population Â 60X the size of Taiwan and growing economic importance
will be too strong in the future. If they start a conflict now, the
combined power of USA and Japan will defeat mainland.

China, USA and most residents of Taiwan, on the other hand, wanted
stability. China needs stability to develope its economy. Status quo
will almost certainly results in china becoming one of the most
influencial nation on earth.
If USA wants a conflict with china they can start one themselves at
their own chosen time. For Taiwan to start a conflict and drag US into
it is most annoying to say the least.

If the separatists can't start a conflict in the near future, it is
likely that the moderate KMT will win the next election and the chance
of peaceful unification is possible.

Taiwan election is unpredictable in that vote buying, rumours often
cause upset.
The opposition candidate is now charged with corruption, an allegation
most people believed is politically motivated. It is not clear if he
will be disqualified last minute. (supreme court judges are nominated
by the president)

the gov has recently included several dialects as &quot;official languages&quot;
but in practice mandarin is the official language. It is the langauge
of higher learning

Mandarin is the common language of all the ethnic groups in Taiwan.It
is the only written language commonly in use even though many people
speak various dialects such as ming-nan or hakka. These dialects ve
limited vocabulary and has limited function as written language.

Taiwan has its own currency (Republic of China printed on it).
2/3 of Taiwan's external trade is with mainland.
Almost all the large corporations invest heavily in Mainland China.
The separatists draw their support form the unemployed low skill
workers in the south who lose their jobs.

Key elections are coming up in 2008 for both America and Taiwan.
Nothing will happen until these key issues are done with. Â Bush will
be on his last legs towards the November elections and the new US
president will have her (whose the 'he' huh?) hands full over Iraq to
want another crisis blow up in her face.

The most important flash point is can a contrived Taiwan crisis derail
the Beijing Olympics? Â It can't. Â So don't worry about a Taiwan crisis
happening any time soon.

The high point in support for Taiwan independence was at least two
Taiwan election cycles ago. Â In the highly unlikely event the Taiwan
Independence party wins in 2008 Â there will still have to be a debate
in the legislature to pass a resolution to hold a referendum, draft
that referendum then hold the vote. Â Its a minimum one to two year
process AFTER the Beijing Olympics.

The Beijing Olympic will be one humongous coming out party that will
bring in millions of visitors to see China first hand. Â Several
hundred millions will see it on TV. Â There is not a single person who
has ever visited China who has not come away awed. Â That mind boggling
impression may be positive or it may be negative. Â But it will still
be in awe. Â Those impressions will influence greatly the world
perception, a better appreciation of the peoples involved in the
Taiwan Independence debate.

Once the Beijing Olympics is over there will no longer be any
restraint on China to act nice. Â  A move towards Taiwan Independence
will elicit an instant response from Â China and get the issue over and
done with once and for all. Â Its a pretty short wait for Gen. Petraeus
Iraq Report to figure out if you people in this newsgroup want to
argue that the US has an obligation to get into that mess.

Lets all thank the fates that Tawian's current status quo is likely to
hold.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The Taiwan separatists is a very unique brand of nationalism in that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; they pin their hope entirely on USA. The Taiwan military is still
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; heavily influenced by the old KMT officers are not willing to fight
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for an independent Taiwan.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What do you think the odds are of a peaceful re-unification?
&gt;&gt;&gt; It's a very difficult question to answer.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ironically, the side most likely, and eager to start a confict is the
&gt;&gt;&gt; Taiwan separatists. Their reasoning being that mainland with a
&gt;&gt;&gt; population Â 60X the size of Taiwan and growing economic importance
&gt;&gt;&gt; will be too strong in the future. If they start a conflict now, the
&gt;&gt;&gt; combined power of USA and Japan will defeat mainland.
&gt;&gt; Key elections are coming up in 2008 for both America and Taiwan.
&gt;&gt; Nothing will happen until these key issues are done with. Â Bush will
&gt;&gt; be on his last legs towards the November elections and the new US
&gt;&gt; president will have her (whose the 'he' huh?) hands full over Iraq to
&gt;&gt; want another crisis blow up in her face.

&gt;&gt; The most important flash point is can a contrived Taiwan crisis derail
&gt;&gt; the Beijing Olympics? Â It can't. Â So don't worry about a Taiwan crisis
&gt;&gt; happening any time soon.

&gt;&gt; The high point in support for Taiwan independence was at least two
&gt;&gt; Taiwan election cycles ago. Â In the highly unlikely event the Taiwan
&gt;&gt; Independence party wins in 2008 Â there will still have to be a debate
&gt;&gt; in the legislature to pass a resolution to hold a referendum, draft
&gt;&gt; that referendum then hold the vote. Â Its a minimum one to two year
&gt;&gt; process AFTER the Beijing Olympics.

&gt;&gt; The Beijing Olympic will be one humongous coming out party that will
&gt;&gt; bring in millions of visitors to see China first hand. Â Several
&gt;&gt; hundred millions will see it on TV. Â There is not a single person who
&gt;&gt; has ever visited China who has not come away awed. Â That mind boggling
&gt;&gt; impression may be positive or it may be negative. Â But it will still
&gt;&gt; be in awe. Â Those impressions will influence greatly the world
&gt;&gt; perception, a better appreciation of the peoples involved in the
&gt;&gt; Taiwan Independence debate.

&gt;&gt; Once the Beijing Olympics is over there will no longer be any
&gt;&gt; restraint on China to act nice. Â  A move towards Taiwan Independence
&gt;&gt; will elicit an instant response from Â China and get the issue over and
&gt;&gt; done with once and for all. Â Its a pretty short wait for Gen. Petraeus
&gt;&gt; Iraq Report to figure out if you people in this newsgroup want to
&gt;&gt; argue that the US has an obligation to get into that mess.

&gt;&gt; Lets all thank the fates that Tawian's current status quo is likely to
&gt;&gt; hold.

&gt; The PRC is facing a massive crisis in the form of demographics,
&gt; environmental issues, bad debt, energy supply, water supply, and
&gt; distrustful neighbors. Â I wouldn't count on them only getting stronger
&gt; over the next 50 years. Â Look at the &quot;Japan threat&quot; of the 70s and
&gt; 80s.

At a 10% growth rate a country's economy doubles every 7 and a quarter
years. Â Within 7 years of half of China's population working in
factories and offices it will hit major problems when it runs out
of workers.

&gt; My understanding is that Chinese (Mandarin) is the official language
&gt; of Taiwan, they use Chinese currency, and of course the strong
&gt; business relations between Taipei and Bejing.
">

The official language of Taiwan is Mandarin, although they use a rather
different character set (the mainland switched to something usually
described as 'simplified' in 1956); they use the Taiwan dollar which
trades entirely independently of the PRC Yuan.

The business relations are there and growing stronger by the day, of
course.

Yu rails against vote buying in Taiwan when China doesnt even have
real elections. Get rid of the communist party who has casually
murdered tens of millions and then maybe China will be a reasonable
place and there can be a reunification. Â Perhaps the govt of Taiwan
should take over from the communists on the mainland. Â The govt of
Taiwan has clearly been far more successful than the communist party
of China at giving its people prosperity.

Crazy as it seems this year more than hundred thousand square miles of
farmland had been reverted to natural woodland because there isn't the
manpower or the need to farm them. Â Buying foodgrains from abroad is
cheaper. Â Slaving at some factory at $86 a month is still a lot better
than the backbreaking work at the farm. Â There is a law passed
recently that prohibits food grains from being used for higher priced
ethanol (alternative fuel) conversion. Â Other farmland had been
converted to horticulture, orchards and non food but higher value use.
One development I Â anticipate is that the small family plots will in
the future be consolidated into larger mechanized industrial sized
farms. Â Also since WWII China had Â suffered through three major
countrywide famines and each time came out with a even larger
population. Â  Very little about China follows perceived notions of how
things should be.

This easily managed blip (extra 7 millions) in births can in a single
year provide the replacement numbers of the current 2.25 million
strong Â first line Chinese military. Â (WIKI).

&gt;&gt;&gt; families like more than to have another child. Â If the rule is relaxed
&gt;&gt;&gt; there will likely be an increase for the first year to 20 million
&gt;&gt;&gt; bawling babies and rising. Â What manpower shortage??
&gt;&gt; When you can't feed everyone ther eis now how does adding 20 million
&gt;&gt; help ?

&gt; Crazy as it seems this year more than hundred thousand square miles of
&gt; farmland had been reverted to natural woodland because there isn't the
&gt; manpower or the need to farm them. Â Buying foodgrains from abroad is
&gt; cheaper. Â Slaving at some factory at $86 a month is still a lot better
&gt; than the backbreaking work at the farm. Â There is a law passed
&gt; recently that prohibits food grains from being used for higher priced
&gt; ethanol (alternative fuel) conversion. Â Other farmland had been
&gt; converted to horticulture, orchards and non food but higher value use.
&gt; One development I Â anticipate is that the small family plots will in
&gt; the future be consolidated into larger mechanized industrial sized
&gt; farms. Â Also since WWII China had Â suffered through three major
&gt; countrywide famines and each time came out with a even larger
&gt; population. Â  Very little about China follows perceived notions of how
&gt; things should be.

&gt; This easily managed blip (extra 7 millions) in births can in a single
&gt; year provide the replacement numbers of the current 2.25 million
&gt; strong Â first line Chinese military. Â (WIKI).
">

Since I do not want China starting resource wars to steal food from
the neighbouring countries:
a. use the new factories to produce agricultural machinery and
fertilizers.
b. family farms produce more food than collective farms on the
same land. Â So increase the size of the family farms rather
than providing more excuses for officials to take bribes.
c. the factories need more *women* workers, so increase the number
of girls.
d. China only needs more soldiers if it is going to war. Â Increases
in recruitment and boys born are just waste, they are not needed
for defence.

China's neighboring countries cannot begin to even feed a single
province in China. Â China's food grain imports are from the US,
Australia, Canada, Argentina and now soyabeans is a big export crop in
Brazil. Â China has leased and farms humongous tracts in Asiatic Russia
and Ubekhistan, farms that are visible in satellite photos. Â And as
the recent food scare shows, China exports a lot of food too to the US
and the rest of the world. Â Food supply for China is not a problem at
this juncture. Â I have been to China and fresh meat and veggies are
plentiful and very cheap. Â A full course Peking Duck dinner for four
is under $20 at the most famous restaurant for this dish.

When the CCP took power in 1949 China's population was estimated at
440 millions. Â In the six decades since it has grown to 1.3 billions
and this is considered an undercount by many demographers. Â The ideal
population in balance with China's ecological carrying capacity should
be 800 millions, still larger than the US and EU populations combined.
However this is an unrealstic goal and China's population is expected
to stabilize at 1.5 billions around 2030. Â Social engineering is a
very risky exercise. Â The only certainty is that China must keep its
population numbers down. Â The draconian one child policy is already a
dangerous meddling of human nature. Â It will be foolhardy ifr not
downright danmgerous to try any of the suggestions you propose. Â Have

Western grasshoppers and Chinese ants
By Spengler
Sep 5, 2007
http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Global_Economy/II05Dj01.html

A major theme is missing from the central bankers' annual retreat at
Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Everyone is talking about collapse of the US
home-price bubble and the danger of recession, but no one is talking
about the suckers who financed the bubble, namely the savers of Asia.

Asia will do so no longer. If the United States wants Asian investors
to continue to take risk on its shores, it will have to allow them to
buy solid US companies, rather than the sort of debt derivatives that
blew up this summer.

One exceptional fact accounts for the instability in financial markets
during recent weeks: the Chinese and many other Asians save about half
their income, while Americans save none of their income at all.
Foreigners, mainly Asians, invest US$1 trillion a year in the United
States, because their home economies cannot absorb so much investment,
or because the political risk attached to local investments is too
great.

In the present iteration of Aesop's fable, American consumers are the
grasshoppers and Chinese (and other Asian) savers are the ants. The
trouble is that Asians have put their savings into the balance sheet
of US consumers.

Outside the US, it seems incomprehensible that the average family
would save nothing for retirement or against a rainy day. But God
takes care of drunks, small children and the United States of America.
In other words, the typical American family expected the value of its
house to keep appreciating at nearly 10% a year indefinitely,
eventually turning into a retirement fund. US home prices appreciated
by 86% between 1996 and 2006; like the Cargo Cults that proliferated
in New Guinea after World War II, Americans seemed to think that this
would go on forever.

Delusional expectations about home prices justified a trillion dollars
of loans to borrowers with poor credit or inadequate income
(&quot;subprime&quot; loans), and that is the proximate cause of the bubble.
World markets have swooned in response to what the media call a credit
crunch - the reluctance of investors to accept the Frankenstein
monsters of financial engineering. In the case of US mortgages of poor
credit quality (&quot;subprime&quot;), derivatives technology sought to make a
silk purse out of a sow's ear, but it is a purse that still goes
&quot;oink&quot; when opened. This has produced consternation across Asia, where
many financial institutions invested heavily in obscure and complex
instruments that cannot be sold today except at a severe loss.

When the world throws money at a national economy, large or small,
credit is easy and stupid investments are made. America's
subprime-mortgage problem uncannily resembles the Asian financial
crisis of 1997. Ten years ago, investors couldn't put enough money
into high-yielding investments in Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea and
so forth, and financed an enormous real-estate bubble. When the bubble
popped in the spring of 1997, Asian stock markets and currencies
crashed. Asians have not forgotten the pious lectures about profligacy
they suffered from the West just 10 years ago.

Many of the economists who offered opinions at Jackson Hole warned
that the bursting of the home-price bubble might lead to a severe
recession. If the rout on financial markets turns into economic
distress, Western governments will have no one but themselves, and
nothing but their own hypocrisy, to blame. After instructing China for
years on the benefits of free markets, Washington, Brussels and other
Western governments have imposed the strictest sort of mercantilist
barriers upon the free movement of capital.

It seems obvious to ask why Asians should have bought exotic debt
instruments, rather than buy brick, mortar and machinery in the United
States and Europe. The answer is that the US and European governments
will not allow them to do so. The specter haunting Western financial
markets is not proletarian revolution, but the sovereign funds of
China, Singapore, the Persian Gulf states and others, ready to invest
hundreds of billions of dollars a year. But the West does not want to
allow Asians to control major companies. The Chinese have told the US
government that they will buy virtually any large US firm that the
government allows them to - but the US government fears the political
fallout.

Of course, one feels sorry for autoworkers in the US state of
Michigan, who earn $30 per hour and expected to do so in perpetuity.
Sadly for them, workers earning a tenth of that amount can assemble
cars just as well. If I were a sovereign investment fund, I would buy
Ford Motor Co, shut down all of its production facilities in the US,
and keep the nameplate as an emerging-markets and European brand. But
that sort of rationalization is precisely what any US government will
try to prevent.

The excuse Washington and Brussels offer for ring-fencing their
companies against Asian investors is that the prospective purchasers
are sovereign funds, that is, agencies of the state, rather than
private individuals. With the poor development of Chinese and other
Asian capital governments, the state becomes the only entity capable
of supporting national savings. Singapore created the model for this
in its admirable pension program. China has no real pension program,
but its more than $1 trillion of foreign-exchange reserves constitutes
the rainy-day savings of the Chinese people. The Chinese authorities
have begun to permit Chinese citizens to buy foreign securities, but
for the moment the savings of the Chinese people are held in large
measure by the government.

Why have Americans tolerated China's penetration of its market for
manufactured goods, at the expense of US manufacturing employment?
Part of the answer, of course, lies in the fact that Americans are
able to buy much cheaper goods. But a more important part of the
answer, perhaps, is that China's reinvestment of its export earnings
in US debt instruments forced down the cost of capital in the United
States, as Federal Reserve Board chairman Benjamin Bernanke has
observed over the years. Cheap capital fueled an asset-price bubble in
the US, generating capital gains for US households that made savings
seem unnecessary.

If, as some of the voices from Jackson Hole predict, US employment
falls as a result, protectionist measures against Chinese exports
become quite probable. Cheap Chinese goods at Wal-Mart and cheap loans
from the banks make a convincing case for free markets only when one
has a job, and a house; if enough people lose their jobs and their
homes, their first instinct will be to blame the Chinese. Democratic
presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton has already embraced
protectionism against China, an ominous sign.

China may have to shift economic gears in a hurry, spending more on
its internal market and infrastructure, using if need be some of the
foreign-exchange reserves accumulated during the past several years.
It will have to seek markets outside the United States, especially in
the emerging world. The transition may be painful in the short run for
China, but I do not expect the Chinese economy to collapse even if the
US throws up protectionist barriers against Chinese imports. China
already has moved most of its young people out of the countryside into
the cities, and there are reports of a shortage of young workers in
Chinese cities.

Americans will have to work harder and save more. If the US wants to
remain the magnet for world capital flows it became during the 1990s,
it will have to allow the savers of the world to become partners in
the US economy, that is, to buy into its first-rank companies. This is
not a matter of US discretion; at some point, the United States will
have no choice but to allow more foreign ownership. If Washington
delays the inevitable, the price of US companies will fall, and
Chinese and other sovereign investors will buy them cheaper.

Afghan bridge exposes huge divide
By M K Bhadrakumar

Sep 5, 2007 http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/II05Df01.html

On the Big Game going on in Central Asia.

Excerpts:

1. Â Great game accelerating
It is extremely rare that the geopolitics of an entire region comes to
be encapsulated within a single occasion. To be sure, the ceremony on
the banks of the Pyanj River provided a movable feast for politicians,
diplomats, the media and strategic thinkers alike. Anyone even
remotely interested in the Great Game took note.

It was a microcosm of the highly complex calculus of the politics of
Central Asia. Three things became clear.

First, the Great Game in Central Asia not only shows no signs of
abating, but it is actually accelerating. Second, Washington is
pressing ahead with its &quot;Great Central Asia&quot; strategy, no matter the
fluidity of the Afghan (and Pakistani) security situation.

Well despite all expectations, the Party bosses of the PRC have
managed to:
1) build up and enshrine a brutal secret political police regime, in
which the subjects of Tibet, Falun Gong, Tiananmen, and Democracy have
been erased from public discourse...
2) destroy China's environmental resources (see: water supply,
pollution, toxic waste, destruction of arable land, extinction of
dozens of species)...
3) destroy much of China's cultural heritage (see Cultural Revolution)
4) create a demographic problem that will shatter China's economy in
the next 40 years (see One Child Policy)
5) create ill-will amongst every single one of China's neighbors (see
Russia, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, India, etc.)
6) never hold free elections
7) enforce a policy of forced late-term abortion

The firstr article was interesting and modestly well thought out, only
omitting the &quot;flip side&quot; of the investment equation....

SubPrime real estate lending in the US, this time around in home mortgages,
unlike the early 80s, when the problem was over-lending on commercial real
estate, was generated by a natural phenomena contributed to by all those
Asian savers (adding the massive inflow of US capital into &quot;money&quot; funds as
opposed to the usually more attractive equity markets.

Incidentally, with US personal savings and family assets at all time highs,
it's bit short sighted to accuse USAians of not saving. Â The problem exists
in the bottom 60% or so of the economic ladder, household whose incomes are
so low as to discourage savings, and by the US tax laws which award holders
of &quot;big&quot; mortgages with subtantial tax benefits.

Meanwhile, with &quot;money&quot; funds glutted, usually wiser heads began to pour
money into the coffers of single family real estate lenders, the only
available loans. Â Soon, the lenders were cutting corners to make larger and
more marginal loans, the only way to get the extra funds &quot;in play&quot; and
earning.

Who is at fault? Â Well, obviously, the lenders, but no less so the Asian and
other institutuional investors/speculators who knowingly poured funds into
marginal markets. Â Were I a Chinese who had lost big money, unable to skowly
dismember my broker who advised the investment, I would change brokerage
houses/trust departments.

In US lending history, the current blip is almost unnoticeable compared to
the &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; of the collapse of US the savings and loan industry
and the shock waves that caused banks across the US to be
reorganized/merged/assimiliated/just flat shut down....a period in which
real estate used as collateral was often liquidated at less than 25% of
&quot;Loan Value&quot;. Â Worst Case estimates and actual real estate market
performance suggest that few loans will result in lender losses exceeding
20%, and even that projection is minimalized by a comparison of actual
interest rates between the two &quot;crunches&quot;. Â In the early 80s a
&quot;non-performing&quot; loan with a rate of 12-18%, common commercial mortagage
yields of the time meant not only a loss of collateral value, but a major
loss of interest revenue. Â In today's market, with rates about half the
numbers from the early 80s, lender exposure is substantially less.

Simple facts like those are what stimulates smart bankers like those in the
Giannini's old immigrant bank, the BofA, to put 2 billion into a quivering
mortagage lender, Countrywide. Â BoA's 2 billion very quickly doubles to
represent about 4 billion in equity position in a company with a
substantially performing portfolio and a modest number of non-performing or
potentially non-performing loans, at worst collateralized at about 80% of
&quot;quick&quot; market value and principally located in medium to high dollar
suburbs of major cities.

I continue to sense from your every post that (like all those USAians you
lambaste) you own few assets or &quot;savings&quot;, and modestly well exposed to some
of the world's press, have become infected with a condition best described
as the paranoia of poverty, that fiscal events spin out of your control as
the Earth hurdles from one financial crisisi to another. Â Actually, reality
is quite the opposite, as most of the world's economies follow cycles of
modest peaks and valleys, tending upward as local and international
conditions change, the traditional &quot;survival&quot; curve, as men spend less time
surviving and more time &quot;living better&quot;.

It's not that there are not major problems for future economic prospects.
Continued population growth in underdeveloped, marginally productive
economies present almost insurmountable challenges, as productive economies
wiill be forced to use assets better deveoted to local investment to simply
feed and shelter the starving, the &quot;reality&quot; of those 12,000,000 or so
&quot;Illegal&quot; Mexicans working in the US to feed themselves and in many cases to
preserve their families back home. Â For China, what to the rest of the world
involves external policy and commitments, will be internalized, how to
extend the great benefits of successful &quot;Leaps Forward&quot; to more and more of
its citizens, especially the more than 50% who lag far behind your $86.00
per month factory workers (and their hunger for consumer goods and blessings
to match their altered states). Â Whatever one may call the system of
government, autocracy/oligarchy/state directed capaitalism/etc., the fact
remains that successive leaderships will have to make continuing decisions
of where to target available revenues, prioritizing aircraft carriers,
irrigation, urban policy, environmental issues, and what seems to me to be a
major challenge in future growth, internal transportation and logistics,
today no more than a band-aid compared to national needs, forcing the vast
majority of existing and new industry into a narrow littoral band accesible
to the sea. Â For good reasons, revenue, products today can move more quickly
and effectively from Chinse producers to destinations around the world, than
they can be transported to may parts of China.

I suspect that the big &quot;crisis&quot; which will most rapidly and seriously face
the EU will be the movement of &quot;have nots&quot; into the precincts - communities,
work forces, social welfare and public assistance systems Â - of the &quot;haves&quot;.
I can't get excited about &quot;Global Warming&quot;, seeing it as no more than
&quot;normal&quot; changes brought about by the same forces which have continued to
alter climates since long before recorded history. Â While I doubt we or our
grandchildren will see &quot;soleras&quot; filled with new &quot;Sherry&quot; surounding the
airfield at Prestwick or buy &quot;Champagne&quot; laid down in Kentish cuvees, a
warming cycle will surely alter agriculture, by some accounts potentially
favorable to man, as milder climates allow currently fallow ground to be
farmed. Â Will polar bears go the way of dodoes? Â I can't really get my
knickers in a twist over that sort of imponderables.

At a month short of 68, and a year or so short of the moment when my
earnings from work will drop below my actual cost of living, forcing me to
survive and thrive on investment earnings, a few residual clients able to
tolerate the recommendations of an old geezer, and the &quot;last gasp&quot;, Social
Security, the final defense which forms the only &quot;retirement&quot; for too many
USAians (except for the equity in the homes they own, in my own modest
circumstances, real - and even in the current slow market and I living in a
backwater - Â appreciation of almost 2,000% over the cost of our first house
in 1966), my actual concerns center upon enjoying comfortably - and with
occasional travel - as much of life with my spouse as remains, and
hopefully, bestowing upon our daughters the leftovers, hopefully enough for
them to piss away in grandiose fashion on luxury or high life, since neither
looks to be needful of an inheritance to get by comfortably.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;You are delusional if your think the Party Bosses actually care about

&gt; &gt;&gt; On the contrary. Â The last thing anyone wants is to have big brother
&gt; &gt;&gt; looking over one's shoulders and deciding what one should do. Â All the
&gt; &gt;&gt; authorities are expected to do is to keep the peace. Â The people will
&gt; &gt;&gt; find ways, and very imaginative ways too, to make money.

&gt; &gt;Well despite all expectations, the Party bosses of the PRC have
&gt; &gt;managed to:
&gt; &gt;1) build up and enshrine a brutal secret political police regime, in
&gt; &gt;which the subjects of Tibet, Falun Gong, Tiananmen, and Democracy have
&gt; &gt;been erased from public discourse...
&gt; &gt;2) destroy China's environmental resources (see: water supply,
&gt; &gt;pollution, toxic waste, destruction of arable land, extinction of
&gt; &gt;dozens of species)...
&gt; &gt;3) destroy much of China's cultural heritage (see Cultural Revolution)
&gt; &gt;4) create a demographic problem that will shatter China's economy in
&gt; &gt;the next 40 years (see One Child Policy)
&gt; &gt;5) create ill-will amongst every single one of China's neighbors (see
&gt; &gt;Russia, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, India, etc.)
&gt; &gt;6) never hold free elections
&gt; &gt;7) enforce a policy of forced late-term abortion

&gt; &gt;oh and let's not forget internet censorship (see Great Firewall of
&gt; &gt;China)

&gt; And all this is going to cause China to fall apart by itself?

Each by itself might not.
But if the students were willing to march in the streets in the past
beofe many of the current repression began then what might they be
plotting now ?

Yet not all can have such a future, can they ?
Many will become nothing more than serfs in thier own land for the
Party.
