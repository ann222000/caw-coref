LOS ANGELES, Feb. 16 — In only its second year, the Tour of California,
which begins Sunday in San Francisco, has become the country’s most
important professional cycling event, attracting more than 1 million
spectators last year and a field of riders this year that ranks as the
strongest ever assembled for a race in the United States.

But the issue of performance-enhancing drugs hovers over the sport of
cycling, and over the race.

Last year’s winner, Floyd Landis, will not compete this year as he
battles allegations that he used synthetic testosterone while winning
the Tour de France last summer.

And now, organizers of the Tour of California, who boasted after last
year’s race that no riders tested positive for banned substances, have
acknowledged that riders were not tested for what has become the sport’s
most abused drug — the blood booster known as EPO.

That failure is more surprising because the lead sponsor of the Tour of
California is Amgen, the California biotechnology company that produces
the genetically engineered version of EPO, which is sold primarily to
help cancer and dialysis patients battle anemia.

A spokeswoman at Amgen, which had marketed its sponsorship as a way to
educate people against improper use of its drug, expressed outrage at
the failure to test for it, saying that the company had been repeatedly
assured last year that EPO testing was done.

The spokeswoman, Mary Klem, said that when Amgen executives were
informed of the oversight, they were angry and surprised. “Our
understanding going into the race was that the test would be included,”
Klem said. “And we were told afterward that no rider tested positive for
EPO or for any banned substances.”

This year, the organizers of the race have agreed to test riders for EPO.

But how a sport battling a reputation for cheating among its athletes
could have left such a gaping hole in its drug enforcement regimen
raised serious questions about its ability to convince fans, sponsors
and participants that the sport was clean and that riders were competing
based on natural ability.

Professional cycling has been battered for years by doping allegations.
Last year, several top riders were barred from the Tour de France after
their names surfaced in a drug investigation in Spain.

Despite the doping concerns, the sport’s popularity has continued to
grow in the United States, which could be its most lucrative market.
This year’s Tour of California is expected to draw large crowds as it
travels 640 miles through central California and down the coast to Long
Beach.

The race has received the highest rating for an event outside Europe
from the International Cycling Union, the sport’s governing body.

The field, with 18 teams of eight riders each, includes many of the top
teams and riders from Europe and the United States.

Among them are the reigning world champions in road racing and the time
trial, Paolo Bettini, the Italian rider for the Belgian team Quick
Step-Innergetic, and Fabian Cancellara, the Swiss rider for the Danish
team CSC.

Top American riders competing include George Hincapie, the current
American road-racing champion, of the Discovery Channel team; and Dave
Zabriskie, of CSC, who finished second in last year’s Tour of California.

Professional riders are subject to year-round unannounced drug tests, as
well as tests at races. As it did last year, the Tour of California will
test four riders each day, including the winner of each day’s stage, the
overall leader of the race and two riders selected at random from the
144 riders scheduled to start the event.

It is not clear who made the decision not to test riders for EPO during
the Tour of California last year, or whether it was merely an oversight.
Executives at AEG, the company that organizes the race, and officials at
USA Cycling, the sport’s governing body in the United States, said in
interviews this week that doping controls were the responsibility of the
International Cycling Union, which sanctions major races and is known by
its French abbreviation, U.C.I.

Sean Petty, the chief operating officer of USA Cycling, said that his
organization and AEG began talking to the U.C.I. in October about plans
for the 2007 race.

During their review of last year’s event, he said, it became apparent
that the daily tests of riders did not include screening for EPO.

Calling the revelation “a big disappointment to Amgen,” Klem, the Amgen
spokeswoman, said, “We made clear that if Amgen was going to continue to
be a sponsor of the race, it needed to be a clean race and EPO had to be
tested for.”

Officials at the U.C.I., which is based in Switzerland, could not be
reached for comment by telephone on Friday and did not respond to e-mail
messages.

Michael Roth, a spokesman at AEG, said the race organizers last year
adopted the standards and protocol for drug testing prescribed by the U.C.I.

He said that AEG did not know that EPO was not part of the standard
test, but that the company asked for it to be included this year.

Roth said that the organizers of the race would bear the cost of the
extra test, about $400 for each urine sample, or $1,600 for each of the
race’s eight days.

That roughly doubles the cost of drug testing for the event, but it also
represents a cost that would probably not be prohibitive for a race in
which sponsors put up hundreds of thousands of dollars.

One cycling team director said the fact that racers at the Tour of
California were not tested for EPO did not mean that riders could have
gotten away with doping.

Jonathan Vaughters, the racing director for Team Slipstream, which is
riding in the race, said that because professional riders are subject to
out-of-competition testing at any time, they could have been tested
before last year’s race.

“The threat of testing is the deterrent,” he said.

Nevertheless, Klem said Amgen still wants the testing done.

“If somebody’s using EPO in the race, we want to know it,” she said. “At
least we know going into this year’s race that we will.”

Hmm, how could it be the "sport's most abused drug" when almost no one tests
positive for it? What's more, when you look at the blood statistics for the

Blood statistics?  An elevated hematocrit is evidence of blood doping,

Out of all the cycling positive dope tests many were for EPO:

Sbeih
Bergman
D'Antoni
Camendzind

Jeanson

(~20% of US positives were for EPO)

Dumbass -

It'll at least convince me that the winner is EPO free if they tested
every day.

The 4 test thing works to an extent. I was road manager for a stage
race ~5 years ago and soon after the start, the word came over the
organization radio channel that the top 3 would be tested along with a
random # which they announced.

The random # was from a big, very successful team and she dropped out
with a "mechanical" at the first hill. Hmmmm. The riders who had been
destroying everyone for the first month of that year mysteriously were
not able to hold the pace on the climb and the top three places were
taken by underdogs.

The fourth place finisher took over the race lead (that was the third
stage). Unfortunately, there was no testing the next day and the race
reverted to form. A couple of the usual suspects rode away from
everyone else.

thanks,

K. Gringioni.

It's a piss poor weak field because most if not all of the top guys are
just using this race as training.  None of the Tour guys are in peak
form and are racing without any incentive to win. Bettini will not even
win a stage...and guys on Slipstream will beat him every day.

But then when Bettini does Milan San Remo, you will see the real Cricket.

Tour de California is basically Levi Leipheimer's Tour de France.

dumbass,

sure, but also in the case of EPO it is apparent a lot of abusers
don't get caught by the testing. wiretaps and raids seem like a more
efficient way to nab dopers, at least at the protour level.

if i was a cycling boss i would require only out of competition
testing and no race testing. other pro sports don't have testing for
the winner right after the game, only cycling does.

anyone caught can be barred from competition, but you eliminate the
possibility that the result will be nullified by a post-race doping
control.

it might not catch all,or even more dopers, but cycling would avoid
the PR mess it's in now.

No race day testing is the best way. I want to see the
civil authorities kept out of it.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LOS ANGELES, Feb. 16 - In only its second year, the Tour of California,
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which begins Sunday in San Francisco, has become the country's most
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important professional cycling event, attracting more than 1 million
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spectators last year and a field of riders this year that ranks as the
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strongest ever assembled for a race in the United States.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the issue of performance-enhancing drugs hovers over the sport of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cycling, and over the race.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dumbass,

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this illustrates the stupidity of the cycling bosses and their lack of
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PR skills.

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's a matter of appeasement. apparently four EPO tests a day, tests
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which aren't an efficient way to catch EPO abusers anyway is enough to
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appease the sponsor that the field is EPO free.

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dumbass -

&gt; &gt; &gt; It'll at least convince me that the winner is EPO free if they tested
&gt; &gt; &gt; every day.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The 4 test thing works to an extent. I was road manager for a stage
&gt; &gt; &gt; race ~5 years ago and soon after the start, the word came over the
&gt; &gt; &gt; organization radio channel that the top 3 would be tested along with a
&gt; &gt; &gt; random # which they announced.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The random # was from a big, very successful team and she dropped out
&gt; &gt; &gt; with a &quot;mechanical&quot; at the first hill. Hmmmm. The riders who had been
&gt; &gt; &gt; destroying everyone for the first month of that year mysteriously were
&gt; &gt; &gt; not able to hold the pace on the climb and the top three places were
&gt; &gt; &gt; taken by underdogs.

&gt; &gt; &gt; The fourth place finisher took over the race lead (that was the third
&gt; &gt; &gt; stage). Unfortunately, there was no testing the next day and the race
&gt; &gt; &gt; reverted to form. A couple of the usual suspects rode away from
&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone else.

&gt; &gt; &gt; thanks,

&gt; &gt; &gt; K. Gringioni.

&gt; &gt; dumbass,

&gt; &gt; sure, but also in the case of EPO it is apparent a lot of abusers
&gt; &gt; don't get caught by the testing. wiretaps and raids seem like a more
&gt; &gt; efficient way to nab dopers, at least at the protour level.

&gt; &gt; if i was a cycling boss i would require only out of competition
&gt; &gt; testing and no race testing. other pro sports don't have testing for
&gt; &gt; the winner right after the game, only cycling does.

&gt; &gt; anyone caught can be barred from competition, but you eliminate the
&gt; &gt; possibility that the result will be nullified by a post-race doping
&gt; &gt; control.

&gt; &gt; it might not catch all,or even more dopers, but cycling would avoid
&gt; &gt; the PR mess it's in now.

&gt; No race day testing is the best way. I want to see the
&gt; civil authorities kept out of it.

i'm not a proponent of police raids, but i am a proponent of out-of-
competition testing. i'm just pointing out that a lot of likley dopers
are identified by the police.
