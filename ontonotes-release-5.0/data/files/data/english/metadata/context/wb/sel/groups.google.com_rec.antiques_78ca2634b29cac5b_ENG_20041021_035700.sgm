Hi,
I have an oldish (1930's) Mantel Clock made by Smiths. It has a
Westminster chime.
On the face it has three holes that allow you to wind the clock (I
have no idea which hole winds which bit).
It seems that the clock has been overwound as the movement is
stationery.
Is there anyway that I can unwind the clock mechanism (spring) without
dismantling the guts?
Just as a note, I have never done this type of thing before and
wouldn't know what is what. But it is possible for me to email an
image of the mechanism.
Many thanks,
Nigel

"/> No.

A Westminster chime is more movement than you want to learn clock
repair on. Somewhere near you is an old chap who repairs clocks and
has done so for decades. Support your local artisans !

"/> Dime a dozen ? A single strike, I grant you, but it's still not
cheap to buy a chime mechanism.

It probably wants cleaning anyway, and simply because it's so
commonplace, repairing springs shouldn't be a huge cost.

There are plenty of nicer things to buy with your money. They are the
horological equivalent of Beanie babies.

Interestingly enough these clocks with the works removed and replaced
with a battery movement seem to sell as easily for not much less money.

Most colleges of further education run clock repairing evening courses
whereby you take a broken clock in and over a course of weeks clean/fix
it yourself under the supervision of someone with greasy hair, bad teeth
and a clothes sense that ended in 1954. This is the course of action I
would recommend to the O.P.

&gt;How much does a run-of-the-mill (brown-case) 1930s Smith's Westminster
&gt;chime (Napoleon hat type thing or similar mantle clock of the Smith's
&gt;ilk) actually cost (trade) in England, Andy?

"/> As you know Ronnie, I'm not trade. But the price I pay for a
Westminster is twice that of a simple strike. I'm buying them as
scrappers, to provide mechanisms for a newly built case. They normally
need cleaning, which I do myself, but anything more than that I send
out. Like stained glass work, there are other crafts people needing
work and I'd rather hand off the stuff that isn't quite my line - I
get cabinetry coming back my way.

My lounge clock at the moment is a Perivale (so one notch up from a
Smiths). Perfectly ordinary, but well proportioned, walnut veneer case
- cost me twenty quid from the Oxfam shop in Bath. In the workshop is
a plug-ugly modern Kieninger, balance wheel and chime, in an all glass
case - 45 quid. Don't know what I'll do with it in the end, but that
mechanism would cost me 250 new.

Oxfam Bookshops, abebooks.com, and various well-meaning middle-class

Anyway, I was working in Bath, the shop was opposite the office, it's
an attractive clock and I was hardly going to leave it sitting there.

&gt; Find a good old fashioned

"/> That's where I got the Kieninger. Apart from being a real aesthetic
abomination, it's a very well made mechanism (an AEL 204, should you
care)

You can probably find a Smiths' strike for a tenner, but you'd be very
lucky to find a chime for &quot;a tenner&quot; hereabouts.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Now tell some 'old chap' you'll pay him a tenner for about a day's pay
&gt;and he'll probably tell ya to fuck off!!

"/> Good. I would _never_ do this. IMHO, an &quot;old chap&quot; who I've never met
before can spend a few minutes talking to me for free, until we both
work out the ratio between cost and workload. But I have an all too
acute appreciation of how people who have any real sort of craft skill
are under-appreciated and under-paid.

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt;Didn't answer my question, Andy. How much do YOU charge per/hour?

"/> Don't ask 8-(

Seriously skint at the moment. Am I an unemployed software geek, or
an underpaid furniture maker ? Software (which pays well) isn't
employing anyone over 25, because they're &quot;too expensive&quot;. Furniture
is an uphill struggle against &quot;Oh, I could buy one like that for £25
in Ikea&quot;.

Last week I was talking to a kitchen fitting company who were offering
some work - after visiting one of my installs (inch thick solid oak
worktops - not a bad piece of work) he then offered me £6.50 an hour.
I'm pleased to say that I ran him out of the workshop, waving
something sharp.
