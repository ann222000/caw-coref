feel worse&quot;? A new study from the University of Michigan Health System

placebo treatment is closely linked to how active a certain area of

The quote below from an old book seems to argue that some percentage
of pain awareness is culturally learned and the second portion
describes the neural sub-system which many areas of the brain can
control to turn off pain.

First, notice that pain varies a great deal between individuals. 'How
do you know that it varies?', one may ask, and this shows us at once
another characteristic of mental occurrences, we each feel that we
know about our own, but can only learn of those of others indirectly
by their behaviour and especially by their speech. The responses that
people give to presumably painful situations certainly vary a great
deal, both between individuals and in the same person at different
times. Immediately after an injury there is sometimes little
indication of pain. Military surgeons have often reported that men
dreadfully wounded seem to feel no pain, perhaps partly because they
are thinking how glad they are to be alive and out of the battle.
However, the point is that severe pain usually comes some time after
injury (or of course from a chronic internal disturbance). It is a
signal that things are wrong and it sets off the search for a remedy.
Dentists report that patients often say that their pains have gone
away when they reach the safe care of the man who will relieve them.
Conversely we all know of people whose pains we feel may be
exaggerated in an attempt to gain sympathy and attention.

This tells us a lot about another very general characteristic of these
phenomena-they are greatly dependent on the social situation. Is it
possible that what we call our personal feelings are in some way
actually a product of man's deeply social way of life and dependence
on communication? This seems a contradiction, and we must be careful
to avoid any suggestion that to call pains social would be to pretend
that they are 'unreal'. Almost nothing is more real for a human being
than his reactions to those around him, and of them to him. Not only
are responses of pain social but they are also at least partly
learned, often according to the practices of the culture in which the
individual grows...

Programs to switch off pain

Electrical stimulation of certain regions of this central grey matter
seems to make rats insensitive to pinching, burning, and even to
surgery. The animals are not paralysed but seem instead to be
completely oblivious to stimuli that are normally painful. These nerve
cells of the reticular formation contain the substance enkephalin,
injection of which kills pain in the same way as does morphia (Hughes
1975). Enkephalin is probably the neurotrans-mitter involved in
synaptic transmission in these reticular brain centres. Morphine thus
acts by imitating the action of enkephalin in stimulating the nerve
cells that switch off the responses to traumatic stimuli, including
the subjective phenomena of pain. This is the brain's program for
reducing pain.

These actions are due to fibres that proceed from the reticular
regions of the brain downwards to the spinal cord (Fig. 11.8). They
inhibit the cells that send signals upwards from neurons that respond
to noxious stimuli, but they do not inhibit neurons that signal
combinations that indicate touch or other non-harmful events (Basbaum
et al. 1976). There have even been experiments in which stimulation of
particular regions of the central grey matter produce analgesia of one
particular part of the body. Once again we see how actively the brain
regulates everything that is allowed to enter it, even pain.

Programs of the brain.

I'll tell you anecdotally that the people in rehab that respond best
to placebo's are generally the people you suspect aren't really in
that much pain in the first place.

Very much like the people who believe that by man being threatened
with jail and ultimately death (The Rule Of Law) to contribute
0.00000023% less of total atmospheric gases, then the globe will
somehow, but they wont say or explain HOW it happens, get colder, are
the same people who never had much of an idea about logic and science
in the first place.

Bit like the people who want to talk about Cato and god instead of the
subject, which was, the commie's idea that man will make the globe
colder by contributing 0.00000023% less of the earth's total gas
(C02), when the science doesn't support that claim, are the same
people who never want to talk about science that doesn't suit their
evil intent, anyway.
