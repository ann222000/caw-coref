HONG KONG: Macau's casino gambling revenue in the third quarter surged
46 percent to 20.34 billion Macau patacas (US$2.55 billion) from 13.95
billion patacas a year ago, regulators said Thursday.

The third-quarter figure brings Macau's total casino gambling revenue
for the nine months ending Sept. 30 to 58.32 billion patacas (US$7.3
billion). That's 47 percent higher than the 39.70 billion patacas
recorded for the same period last year and already beats gambling
revenues for all of 2006.

The Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau didn't elaborate on the
figures it posted on its Web site, but analysts said earlier they
expected casino operators' winnings from bets by high-rollers to help
boost casino gambling revenue in the territory.

The former Portuguese colony is the only place in China where casino
gambling is legal.

High-rollers are gamblers who typically spend at least half a million
patacas (US$62,620) on casino betting on each trip to the territory,
according to analysts and casino industry executives.

Macau casino winnings from bets by high-rollers between July and
September totaled 13.67 billion patacas (US$1.7 billion), making up 67
percent of the city's third-quarter casino gambling revenue.

Analysts also said earlier the opening of new casinos in Macau this
year had attracted more gamblers to the territory, increasing casino
gambling revenue there.

Las Vegas Sands Corp.'s US$2.4 billion Venetian casino resort in the
Cotai area, which opened in late August, is among the three major new
casinos launched in the past nine months.

Macau ended the 40-year monopoly of casino gambling in the territory
held by casino mogul Stanley Ho in early 2002. Since then the
territory has granted six casino licenses to several casino operators.

Macau beat the Las Vegas Strip last year as the world's gambling
center. The city raked in US$6.95 billion in gambling revenue, while
the Strip made US$6.69 billion, regulators in the cities said.

The former Portuguese enclave reverted to Chinese rule in December
1999.
