&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think so coz I have a vague recollection of you fessing
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; up to being struck off as a Rabbi.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Wrong again Steve.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I was suspended from certain duties I had been allocated, but I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can't be 'struck off' or unfrocked like a vicar or a priest because
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I'm neither of those.  My suspension was lifted within three weeks
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; when I was given permission to bury my son Aaron.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Rabbi is an academic title as well as a pastoral title.

&gt; &gt;&gt; I know how to use google and thus know what the definition of Rabbi
&gt; &gt;&gt; is.  You're using the title to garner respect and since you deserve
&gt; &gt;&gt; none you are misusing it.

&gt; You're the one using the qualification to generate hatred.

I don't hate Jews or Rabbis.
I hate boasting and the use of titles to prop up over inflated

&gt; &gt;&gt; It means I've
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; passed an exam and been awarded a Certificate of Semicha to teach.
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The same academic qualification also permits me to preach or to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lead a Synagogue congregation and much more, but I am first and
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; foremost a teacher and a researcher.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I served as a Kadisha leader and acted as Shin-Mem-Resh or Shomerim
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; - literally a guardian of the dead.  I was chosen because I buried
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; my Rabbi and teacher at his widows request and it was she who
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; recommended me for the post.  I buried our dead because I'm young
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and strong enough to refill the grave with a reversed shovel so
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that the deceased would not be buried by cemetary goyem using
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; machinery, and because it is a requirement which I was taught to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; respect.  It's something which we call chesed shel emet - one of
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the anchors of our faith.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Another part of my duties as Kadisha leader was to collect the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; deceased persons valuables including jewellery and return them to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the family.  We are buried in a simple shroud, and without
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; adornment so that kings and paupers are equals in death.  It wasn't
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; made clear at the time, but I was suspended because certain
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; allegations cast some doubt on my integrity when handling the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; deceased and their valuables.  Because I was told only that I
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; was to be 'removed from my duties', and given no reason other than
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; someone had accused me of dishonesty in a newsgroup, I later
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tendered my resignation which was declined, and my suspension was
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lifted.  In February 05, I took a 3 year leave of absence to pursue
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; my academic career and to gain experience on the lecture circuit.

The pretty teacher was concerned with one of her eleven-year-old pupils.
Taking him aside after class one day, she asked, "George, why has your school work been so poor lately?"
"I'm in love," the boy replied.
Holding back an urge to smile, she asked, "With who?"
"With you," he said.
"But George," she said gently, "don't you see how silly that is?
It's true that I would like a husband of my own someday. But I don't want a child."
"Oh, don't worry," the boy said reassuringly, "I'll use a rubber."
