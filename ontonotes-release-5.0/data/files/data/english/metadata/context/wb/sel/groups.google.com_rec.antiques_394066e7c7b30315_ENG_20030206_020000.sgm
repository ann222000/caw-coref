A Timeless Tale Table of content

Ramayana, the ancient Indian tale of devotion, separation, and reunion,
is a story almost as old as civilization itself. It is an expression of
the eternal battle between good and evil, ranging from short stories to
lengthy epics. Combining elements of religion, romance, myth, magic,
action, adventure, fantasy, and a fascination cast of characters
including gods, goddesses, semi-divine humans, amazing monkeys, and
powerful ogres, the story of Rama’s love for Sita and her abduction by
Ravana, king of the ores, has withstood the rest of time and
nationality. For over two thousand years, the story has captured the
imagination of peoples from India to Iran, Tibet to Thailand, Cambodia
to China, Japan to Java, Malaysia to Myanmar, and Sri Lanka to Siberia.
In journeys beyond the geography of its setting and origin, it was even
adapted by other religions in the process, local cultures have
transformed Ramayana – more than any other story in the world – into a
rich source of inspiration for the arts in a great variety of literary
traditions, narrative expressions, artistic manifestations, and
performance styles.

In this timeless tale, the birth of Ravana and the ogres throws the
universe into chaos as they attack heaven, earth, and the underworld,
yet Ravana’s wicked deeds do not go unpunished; everyone curses him. To
help defeat Ravana, the god’s father monkeys, most prominent among who
is the powerful Hanuman. Meanwhile, Ravana continues his rampages and is
even captured. Promising good behavior, he is released, but resumes his
terrorizing ways, and is cursed by even more people. The god Vishnu
finally incarnates as Rama and his brothers, while a goddess violated by
Ravana is reborn as Sita. When Rama grows up, he wins the hand of Sita
in a contest. Rama’s aging father wishes to crown Rama as his successor,
but it thwarted by a joiner queen, who forces her husband to put her own
son on the throne. Rama is banished to the forest. Meanwhile, similar
events are taking place in the monkey kingdom. Due to a misunderstanding
over a fight with a buffalo demon, the monkey king Vali expels his
brother Sugriva.

While Rama and Sita are living in exile, an ogress sties to seduce
Rama’s younger brother, Lakshmana, who accompanies them. Disgusted, he
mutilates her, but she lies about this to her older brother Ravana. She
convinces him to abduct Sita and make her his wife. An ogre changes into
an enchanted deer to tempt Sita and lure Rama and Lakshmana away from
her. The plan succeeds, and Ravan comes in disguise to abduct Sita. A
huge bird tries to rescue her but fails. When Rama and Lakshmana return
to find Sita missing, they begin to search for her. Along the way they
run into Sugriva, who offers his help on condition that he is made king
of the monkeys again. Rama restores him to the throne, and Sugriva sends
in the monkey forces. Following many leads, they learn where she has
been taken, and Hanuman leaps across the sea to find her. He meets Sita
and tells her of Rama’s continuing love for her. Hanuman allows himself
to be captured by the ogres who try to burn him to death, but he breaks
free and sets their kingdom on fire.

The monkeys construct a causeway to reach the island where Sita is held
captive, and together with Rama they march across and take siege of the
city. Ravana refuses to negotiate a peaceful settlement, and ignores
advice from his younger brother, Vibhishana, to return Stia in order to
avoid destruction of the ogres. Furious, Ravana banishes him and
Vibhishana joins forces with Rama. War breaks out. The ogres use magical
weapons, but the gods help Rama. With Vibhishana’s help in revealing the
ogres’ weaknesses, the monkeys are victorious. Ravana summons his
gigantic younger brother and his most powerful son into battle, but
after ferocious clashes, they are killed. An ogre abducts Rama and
Lakshmana to the underworld and tries to slay them, but Hanuman comes to
the rescue. Other friends of Ravana give their support but are killed
also. Finally, Ravana goes to the battlefield and meets his death at the
hands of Rama.

Before Rama is reunited with Sita, however, he orders her to undergo a
trial by fire to prove her purity during her long captivity. She
survives the public ordeal and returns home with Rama and them monkeys.
Vibhishana is crowned king of the ogres as a reward for his assistance,
but some surviving ogres and the sons of Ravana depose him. Rama sends
his brothers to restore Vibhishana to the throne. Peace does not last
very long, for there is lingering suspicion over Sita’s behavior during
her captivity. Rama banishes her to the forest where she gives birth to
twin sons. Finally, Rama conducts a grand ritual to show his supremacy
and meets his sons. He tries to persuade Sita to return to him, but she
is disgusted with his treatment of her. She feels s it is time to end
her long suffering and descends into the earth. Rama reigns for a long
time before leaving the mortal world and resuming his divine form. In
heaven he is reunited with the goddess who was Sita.

India
Beyond Borders Table of content

In India, here the epic originated, the poet Valmiki may have composed
Ramayana in Sanskrit as early as the 8th century BCE or even as recent
as the 4th century CE. Most scholars, however, agree upon a time between
400-200 BCE. Whatever the year may actually be, the story gradually grew
over the centuries until it reached epic proportion. While other
narratives undoubtedly existed then as they do today in nearly every
language in India, Valmiki Ramayana represents a compilation of various
oral and literary traditions, including Vedic myths from the 12th
century BCE. Nearly 25,000 verses are divided into around seven hundred
chapters and grouped into seven books. Other different narratives in
Sanskrit include the 12th century Bhushundi Ramayana, Adbhuta Ramayana
and Adhyatma Ramayana, and 17th century Ananda Ramayana. Followers of
the Jain religion adapted the epic with Paumachariyam in Prakrit as
early as the late 3rd or early 4th century. Since killing is a sin in
Jainism, Lakshmana fights Ravana to the death and is punished for it.
Rama and Sita remain celibate, which is a Jain virtue, adding doubts not
only to Sita’s chastity during her captivity but also regarding the
paternity of the sons born to her.

Hindi and northern narratives of the epic, such as the 16th century
Ramcharitmanas by Tulsidas, emphasize the divine nature of Rama that
developed from Vishnu devotional cult since the 10th century. While
northern and Sanskrit variations are popular in Nepal, local writers
during the 19th century also composed Sundarananda Ramayana and Adarsha
Raghava in Nepali. Changes appeared earlier during the 14th century in
the northeast with Katha Ramayana from Assam and Krittivas Ramayan from
West Bengal and later in the eastern coastal state of Orissa during the
16th century with Jagamohan Ramayana. Minor changes also took place in
the western Indian states of Gujarat with Ramabalalila in the late 15th
or early 16th century and Ramavatar from Punjab during the 17th century.
In south Indian traditions, there are trends toward stronger female
characters, increased importance of the monkeys, more sympathetic
portrayals of the ogres, and frequent use of magic. These features
appeared as early as the 12tgh century in the Malayalam Rmacharitam and
Tamil Kamban Iramavataram, 13th century Telugu Rangganatha Ramayanam,
and later in the 16th century Kannada Torave Ramayana.

Further south and across the narrow straits to Sri Lanka, the ogres
become more noble and heroic. Based on its name and geographic location.
The island even might be Langka of the epic. A series of natural
formations in the narrow straits between India and Sri Lanka are
believed to be remnants of the causeway. While Hinduism may have been
dominant in the past and is practiced by the minority Tamil population
today, the majority of Sinhalese are overwhelmingly Theravada Buddhists.
Yet the 7th century Janakiharana is not a Buddhist tale mainland
Southeast Asian Theravada Buddhist countries. In Sri Lanka, the story
did not evolve as much, which may have been reinforced by the
introduction of traditions from southern India during the 19th century.

As evidence of the extent that the epic traveled – along inland trade
routes – variations of the story are found in areas towards the north,
west, and central parts of Asia. Between the 13th to 19th centuries, the
Persian and Mogul sultanates adapted Hindu culture into Islaamic art and
literature, resulting in such works as the 16th century Dastan-e-Ram O
Sita and Razmnama from Persia (Iran), and 18th century Pothi Ramayan in
Urdu, the language of Pakistan. During the 19th century, Ramavatara
Charita was written in Kashmir, another predominantly Muslim area. The
story, however, was not Islamised in any of these narratives. In distant
Xinjing in northwest China, the 9th century Khotances Ramakatha has a
Buddist orientation. This probably was due to influences from Dunhuang,
an important central Asian Buddhist center during the 7th to 9th
centuries. Dunhuang also had a later impact on the 13th century Tibetan
Son-om Gar-a and 15th century Zhang-zhung-pa Chowanga-drak-pai-pal.

Bali, Indonesia
Southeast Sojourns Table of content

During the early 9th century, a vassal Cambodian prince of the Buddhist
Shailendra kingdom that ruled Java during the time established his own
empire of Angkor. The Khmer Reamker is quite distinct from the Old
Javanese Hindu literary tradition that developed toward the end of the
same century. Instead, the Khmer probably received the epic through
southern Indian sources, for it also differs from northern narratives.
In Indian mythology, Vishnu incarnates as Rama and later as Buddha, thus
enabling the previously Hindu Khmers to continue accepting the epic and
spreading it wherever their vast empire reached. Numerous bas-reliefs of
the epic at the 10th century Banteasy Srei temple and 12th century
Angkor Wat temple are proof of this Hindu-Buddhist syncretism. With the
Thai destruction of Angkor during the 14th century, what the Khmers lost
the Thais continued as Ramakian. The Khmer version was recomposed in two
parts during the 16th or 17th century and 18th or 19th century, probably
based on indigenous folk narratives along with Thai traditions.

The Thai kingdom of Ayutthaya, named after Rama’s capital of Ayodhya,
was itself sacked and destroyed by invading armies from Myanmar in the
18th century, resulting in the loss of literary works. When a new
capital was established at Bangkok shortly after, one of the first tasks
of King Rama I, who took on the name of the hero of the epic, was to
have the lost Ramakian composed again. The episodes were rearranged,
however, in a more linear time fashion. In addition, Tamil tradition
probably played an important role in the royal literary effort, for the
Thai epic has many features in common with southern Indian ideas, such
as strong females (which also is an indigenous Thai trait), soul
transfer, and characters magically transforming themselves into other
beings. Many of the ogres have special powers or weapons, and they are
defeated in unique ways with help from Vibhisana. Hanuman becomes as
lover to many women and has several wives, thus completely going against
the entire Indian tradition in which he remains celibate and unmarried.
The brothers of Rama and even his sons battle against the surviving
ogres and destroy them, thus repeating several motifs and greatly
increasing the length of the epic.

The story in Myanmar does share some features with the Thai version due
to the conquest, but there are important differences, notably the
absence of a Buddhist tone to the epic in spite of the fact that most
people in Myanmar are followers of Buddhism. Myanmar is geographically
closer to India and shares an eastern border with northeast India. This
region is home to several tribal groups with Ramayana traditions of
their own that differ from classical northern and eastern Indian
literature. The rugged terrain, however, was not conducive to extensive
cultural contact between tribal groups and court centers in Myanmar.
Instead, there are interesting similarities between the 17th century
Myanmar Yama Watthu and 19th century Maha Yama with Malay tradition.

In Indonesia, the Hindu Javanese Kakawin Ramayana in the Old Javanese or
Kawi language from the 9th century CE closely follows the Valmiki
narrative but in an abridged form, for it was based on a summary in a
manula on Sanskrit grammar. The 9th century Prambanan temple complex in
Central Java and 14th century Panataran Temple in East Java is rich with
narrative bas-relief carvings of the epic. Javanese in fluence on the
neighboring island of Bali began during the 11th century, and Kawi
literature also became a part of Balinese tradition. With the coming of
Islam to Java and the rise of sultanates on the island during the 16th
century, the Javanese adapted the epic to the new religion. The 18th
century sultanate of Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat, more popularly known as
Yogyakarta or Yogya, was named after the capital city of Rama, Ayudhay.
Rama also became one of the ancestors in the royal genealogy, and new
episodes were created and borrowed for the 19th century Serat Rama that
is used in the leather puppet theatre up to the present. Java could not
entirely abandon fifteen centuries of Hindu Buddhist tradition, but the
Balinese continued the practices with great exuberance that continues
today.

In Malaysia where Islamisation began earlier during the 13th century,
the divine status of Rama was greatly reduced. He is more human, capable
of committing errors and susceptible to his emotions, thus retaining and
gaining acceptance among Malay Muslims by the 15th century. Through
various indigents in Hikayat Seri Rama and Cherita Maharaja Wana that
were written during the late 16th or early 17th century, all the main
characters are closely related to each other, with Sita as the daughter
of Ravana, and Hanuman being the son of Rama and Sita. As in the Thai
tradition, Hanuman is a great lover o woman. The contest to win the hand
of Sita involves numerous tests of the problem over the succession to
the throne. The large number of new episodes, especially in the leather
puppet theatre, shows how popular Ramayana remained in Malaysia due to
centuries of Cambodian and Thai influences with which it shares many
features. As with the Javanese, it was a story that could not be
forgotten let alone eliminated even among Muslims, for it remains deep
in the Malay subconscious. Some episodes also are based upon local
folktales and variations of Javanese romances. While Malays are
ethnically, linguistically, and culturally related to the Javanese,
their Ramayana traditions are quite different. Most similarities are as
recent as the 19th century and seem to indicate that t he Javanese also
may have borrowed from the Malays.

Among one Islamic group on the southern island of Mindanao in
predominantly Christian Philippines, Maharadia Lawana is unique. The
Maranao people are seafarers with ethnic, cultural, and historical links
to other maritime communities and sultanates in the area, so journeys by
boat are common in life and literature. While some motifs may have come
from Malay and Javanese traditions, the elements have evolved and
changed so much between the mid-17th and early 19th centuries that the
story can be considered as an independent tradition. These include
ball-kicking games, rattan tightropes, and water buffalo and crocodile
allies.

Interestingly enough, Lao narratives have much in common with Malay
traditions in spite of their ethnic and linguistic differences and the
geographic distance between them. Perhaps this may be due to the ancient
Cambodian kingdoms that once encompassed these diverse areas. Subsequent
Thai and Vietnamese attacks by land against the Khmer center led to the
loss of traditions in the fertile plains, but not in the further reaches
of the empire in t he remote mountainous interior and distant coasts of
the peninsula. The epic takes place mostly in Laos with boat journeys
along the Mekong River, a reflection of the geography and isolation in
this land-locked country. As in most Asian countries, the origins of
local place names are based on events in the story. Rama is considered
to be a previous incarnation of Buddha in Laos, just as he is in
Cambodia and Thailand. Female characters are very strong and even become
amazon warriors in Guay Duorahbi that may date from the 15th or 16th
century, which is reflected in the independent character of Lao women
today. Pha Lak Pha Lam from the 19th century involves the abduction of
two women by Ravana, which accounts for its considerable length. A
unique addition is a magical flying and talking horse, a motif found in
a more basic form in some Malay stories. Hanuman also is the son of Rama
as in Malaysia. Dream sequences frequently appear in both Lao and Thai
tradition.

Thailand
Adaptations across Asia Table of content

Temple inscriptions from Champa in resent-day Vietnam indicate that the
epic already was known there by the 7th century CE. However, the
tradition disappeared there and has only resurfaced recently. The story
of the monkey Sun Wu Kong in the 16th century Chinese classic Journey to
the West, more popularly known as Monkey, often is compared to Ramayana.
While motifs were undoubtedly borrowed from the epic, the basic plot
does not deal with love, separation, and reunion. There are basic
parallels with a monk’s efforts to obtain sacred Buddhist scripture,
assisted by a powerful monkey who helps in battles against demons.
However, China and Japan have stories that are closer in plot to the
epic itself, although the battles are greatly reduced in number or even
eliminated in some cases. These shortened summaries from the 3rd century
CE of Ramayana are known as Jataka tales, stories of the former lives of
Buddha that usually are embedded in such religious texts as Six
Parimitra Sutra. Abridged Japanese variations were written during the
10th century as Sambo Ekotoba and 12th century as Hobutsushu. Mongolia
also has its own tale in the 19th century Bolor Toli as part of
religious literature. While nothing has been found for Korea so far,
this does not mean that the tradition does not exist, only that research
needs to be done. Considering the historical, cultural, and religious
ties with its neighbors, it would be very unusual if Korea did not have
some form of the epic. Every country around Korea has some variation of
the story, including Siberia since the 18th century.

Epic Expressions

Language, culture, custom, history, and religion have shaped Ramayana
throughout Asia, but the basic story can still be recognized in its many
different manifestations, ancient and modern. Oral and literary versions
of the epic have inspired the visual and performing arts everywhere,
proof that it remains a living tradition. In India, these include
ancient temple carvings in stone and wood, classical and folk paintings,
dances, and ceremonial dramas, all sorts of puppets, and toys. Bengali
singers travel room village to village, unrolling painted scrolls of
episodes from the story to the accompaniment of narrative songs. Every
year for at least ten days, Hindus across many parts of India celebrate
the Deshara festival. During this time episodes from Ramayana are
performed, culminating in the death of Ravana and the burring of huge
ogre effigies to symbolist the victory of good over evil.

The epic is so famous that some Chinese and Vietnamese opera troupes
have a adapted it into their repertoires by selecting Ramayama
characters from the great number of traditional opera roles. In Myanmar,
temple carvings, dances, marionettes, and elaborate applique hangings
portray scenes from the story. Variuous types of puppets, court and
popular dance dramas, and temple murals and carvings are common
throughout Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. It is common to find Ramayana
episodes depicted next to Buddhist images stories in temples, as at the
Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok. Of all the performing arts,
however, nothing else can match the complete spectacle of the Cambodian
nang sbek thom and related Thai nang yai. To the accompaniment of gongs,
drums, and wind instruments, dozens of large figures cut from leather
are animated by many dancers in the front and back of a huge screen lit
by fire (even by a large cremation pyre) or electric lights. This
clearly shows the close connections between dance and puppetry, for
silhouettes of the performers are visible throughout the performance.
From the royal courts evolved lengthy dramas with elaborately dressed
dancers wearing fantastic masks. Even village groups adapted the masked
dance style.

Malay puppeteers perform old and new episodes from the epic with small
leather figures that have only one moveable arm. Similar all night
puppet plays with stylized figures that have two articulated arms take
place in Java, in addition to dance dramas as refined courtly ceremony
and popular operatic style. Ancient Javanese temple carvings visually
narrate the story in long series of bas-reliefs. The Balinese paint and
carve popular scenes and characters from Ramayana for their temples and
houses, as well as restaurants and hotels. During religious ceremonies,
the Balinese recite the story in poetry, or perform episodes in masked
dance dramas and leather puppet plays with shadows cast by the
flickering flame of an oil lamp. Mysterious illnesses can be cured by
puppet performances in which ogres are destroyed, since the Balinese
traditionally believe that evil spirits are responsible for health problem.

Java, Indonesia
Modern Manifestation Table of content

Whether consciously or subconsciously, Ramayana continues to exert its
influence in many aspects of contemporary society. All across India,
temples and shrines dedicated to Hanuman far outnumber those for Rama or
any other character. A television series of the epic produced during the
late 1980s became one of the most popular events in Indian broadcasting
history. Viewers stopped work and school to watch with great devotion,
and many even decorated their television sets with flowers like temple
shrines. The series also was extremely popular in other countries where
it was shown.

Perhaps nowhere else in Southeast Asia is the epic so evident as in
Thailand. Rama is a previous incarnation of Buddha, and as the supreme
monarch he is deemed faultless. Even today, it is against the law to
insult the king. Since the current dynasty was established in the 18th
century, Thai kings have been called Rama. Ordinaries Thais accord their
monarch divine status, while influences of the epic permeate many
aspects of s social and cultural life. Four of the Thai royal barges
have monkey figures straddling cannons that are mounted on their bows,
while modern naval vessels and aircraft are named after some of the
characters. Bamboo rockets used during annual rain making rituals
sometimes bear colorful cutout images of aerial scenes from the epic.
Total destruction caused by storms as well as fatal traffic accidents
that claim many lives are named after Ravana. Sacred Buddhist
manuscripts often are stored in lacquered cabinets decorated with gold
leaf illustrations from the epic. Traditional astrology is based upon
characters and episodes, while some figures are invited to attend house
purification rituals. Classical dancers pray to masks of the characters
placed upon an altar with offerings before performing, and dolls dressed
as court dancers are displayed in many homes. Techniques in traditional
massage bear the names of hermits and their particular skills known in
the story. Thai kick-boxers use fighting positions named after
characters and incidents as metaphors of movement. Tattoos or images of
Hanuman worn on their bodies bestow strength, courage, endurance, and
protect against pain during bouts. On a more mundane level, images from
the epic appear on advertisements, kites, T-shirts, calendars, coasters,
postage stamps, telephone cards, matchboxes, and twice as collector
cards in cigarette packs in the past.

The epic influences social, economic, and political life in some very
interesting ways. For the Javanese, the contrasting actions of
Kumbhakarna who supports and defends his country even if the king is
leading it into disaster, versus Vibhishana who deserts his erring
monarch for a just one but betrays the nation, is a focal point of
debate. Perhaps it helps explains the confusing alliances and shifting
loyalties throughout modern Indonesian political history. The Javanese
identify with epic characters and often seem to be following different
interpretations of the plot. The term of address for a highly respected
Javanese man in Rama, which is pronounced Romo and also refers to a
Roman Catholic priest in Indonesia. Streets, shops, and manufactured
products are named after characters from the story, and a series of
postage stamps once bore images of dancers in important roles. The
Southeast Asian Games held in 1997 used Hanuman as its mascot. Balinese
puppet style paintings from the epic decorate bamboo hats, lampshades,
fans, cloth wallets, canvas portfolios, coconut shells, cups, boxes, and
wooden egg ornaments.

In Lao, Malay, and Filipino traditions, Rama is not exiled due to
conflict over the throne; power is passed on with out question. Lao
women continue to have considerable power and influence in society. The
numerous scandals and the need to continuously prove oneself in the
Malay stories take on more importance in light of recent events in the
country. Similarly, the theme of civil war between Rama and his sons in
the Khmer Reamker perhaps adds poignancy and helps in understanding the
horrific period of the Killing Fields. Yet the tradition managed to
survive under the most terrible conditions in Cambodia, proof of its
strong and lasting appeal.

Throughout the tumultuous centuries, and especially more recent history
when nations in the region struggled to become independent and modern
entities, Ramayana has survived. It has withstood time and distance by
adapting to religious change, political crises, social upheaval, and
modernization. The eternal epic provides guidance for coping with
change. For many Asian cultures, it has been more than just a story, and
a very good one.

Three examples of the different treatments
of a story depending on the versions.

1- Battle of the Buffalo
Table of content

Malay: Cherita Maharaja Wana

A cow buffalo secretly gives birth to Dundubhi (Katibihara) in a cave to
save to him form his father, who kills his sons at birth so as to remain
the most powerful buffalo. Dundubhi swears to end the tyranny of his
father and waits until their hoof prints are of the same size to ensure
a fair fight. He asks the Dewa Empat (Four Gods; probably Indra, Yama,
Varuna, and Kubera) for help. They empower each of his hoofs, and he
kills his father.
Dundubhi challenges Vali (Bali) but denies receiving divine help when
Vali asks about his strength. This offends the four gods, so they leave
his hoofs. Vali kills the buffalo by twisting his neck, and foam comes
out of the dying animal’s mouth, making his blood look lighter. Since
Vali’s blood is white, Sugriva (Sagariwa), who is waiting outside for
his brother, mistakenly concludes that Vali is dead,. He seals the cave
with a boulder and returns to Kishkindha (Katakina), where Anggada and
Nila (Anila) agree that he assumes the throne.
The Dewa Empat feel sorry for Vali, and in a dream tell him to cut off
the head of Dundubhi and hurl it at the boulder blocking the entrance.
Vali sets himself free and returns to Kishkindha. He finds Sugriva
asleep with his three wives. Vali hurls Sugriva into the forest and
banishes Anggada and Nila along with him. Sugriva weeps so heavily he
becomes covered in a mound of his own eye mucus.

Thai: Ramakien (Ramakerti)

A celestial guardian bothers a goddess and is cursed to be reborn as the
buffalo Torapa. Aware that he will return to heaven if killed by one of
his sons, Torapa destroys all of them at birth. One of his wives
secretly gives birth to a son named Dundubhi (Torapi). Dundubhi measures
his hoof prints against those of Torapa until they are of the same size.
He kills Torapa and terrorists others, even threatening the monkey. Vali
(phali) tricks bundubhi into revealing the secret of his power. Dundubhi
praises his horns without acknowledging the gods, so the deities abandon
him and Vali kills him. Rainfall dilutes the dark blood and maker it
lighters: Sugriva (Sukhrip) thinks Vali is dead and seals the cave. Vali
cuts off Bundubhi’s head and uses it to break open the cave, then chases
Sugriva away.

Khmer: Raamker

A ferocious buffalo king kills his own sons, so one of his wives hides
her baby son Dundubhi (Dubhi). The buffalo king eventually learns about
his secret son. When they meet, Dundubhi kneels in respect, but the
buffalo king accuses him of cowardice. Angered by his arrogance,
Dundubhi fights and kills his father, fully aware of what a terrible sin
it is. Vali (bali) devises a plan with Sugriva (Sugrib) and tricks the
buffalo into entering a cave. Dundubhi encounters difficulty because the
space is too small, and Vali kills him. His dark blood flows out and
desecrates the hermitage of a sage, who curses the person responsible to
die. Celestial beings send down showers of flowers that make the blood
look lighter. Sugriva weeps, thinking his brother is killed. The monkeys
seal the cave it rocks. Sugriva returns home and becomes king.
Vali finds the entrance blocked, so he cuts off Dundubhi’s head and
hurls it at the boulders, scattering rocks everywhere. He accuses
Sugriva of treachery. Sugriva flees, with Vali in pursuit. Sugriva seeks
refuge in the mountains where the sage lives, knowing that Vali will not
go there due to the curse of death put on him. Attended by Hanuman,
Sugriva hides and weeps bitter tears that flow like a river.

Lao: Pha Lak Pha Lam

A buffalo learns the incantation to become impervious to injury. He
grows powerful and arrogant. One of his wives plots to destroy him. She
asks him to teach her the spell for her won protection. Later, she
secretly gives birth to as son in a cave but lies that he had a
miscarriage. She teaches her son Dundubhi (Duorahbi) the incantation,
and tells him to hone his fighting skills by using his horns to tear
vines to pieces. Next, he has to ram trees and pierce the fruits as they
fall. Then, he learns to fling away his own excrement with his horns
before they drop to the ground. After he masters those skills, his
mother tells him to wait until he matches the size and strength of his
father to challenge him.
Dundubhi compares their hoof print sizes until they are the same, then
challenges his father. He makes love with his father’s wives; since
then, buffaloes mate with their own mothers. When Dundubhi’s father sees
this, he fights with his son. Dundubhi injures his father many times,
and each time his father retreats until his wounds are healed. Finally,
Dundubhi kills his father by piercing his heart, but he has committed
the sin of patricide. Dundubhi grows arrogant and attacks Kishindha
(Kasi). Tara (Kottahrat) volunteers to fight, but because she is
pregnant, Vali (Lichan) and Sugriva (Sanggip) help her. Tara is injured
and falls to the ground; twin sons burst out of her womb. Vali takes the
afterbirth and throws it at Dundubhi, who intercepts it with his horns,
but he loses one fourth of his power. As Vali and Sugriva take Tara and
her two-son back to safety, Dundubhi taunts, “You retreat with a woman,
so you should wear skirts like her!” Insulted, Vali and Sugriva return
to fight him. They fly up into the sky, but Dundubhi invites them down
to fight in his cave. Vali cuts off the buffalo’s head, but rainfall
dilutes the blood that flows out like water in which meat has been
washed. Sugriva seals the cave with a boulder to keep Dundubhi inside,
and returns home. Sugriva tells Tara that her husband is dead, but she
does not believe him because he did not see the body. She goes to
investigate and hears Vali calling out for help. They con not move the
boulder, so Vali takes the head of Dundubhi and hurls it at the rock,
which shatters. He and Tara return and chase Sugriva away.

Sanskrit: Valmiki Ramayana

Dundubhi ridicules Vali, who is drunk and in the company of women. Vali
picks him up, twirls him around, and dashes him to the ground. He kicks
the demon’s body away but it lands near a hermitage. The sage curses the
person responsible to death, and for his friends to turn into stone if
they enter the forest. Dundubhi’s son attacks in revenge, but Vali
chases him into a cave and tells Sugriva to stand guard outside. The
sounds of a terrible battle roar inside, and then torrents of blood gush
out. Sugriva fears that his brother is dead, rolls a boulder across the
entrance, and returns to home. Vali, who has killed the demon, frees
himself and banishes Sugriva, who seeks safety in the forest here, the
sage’s curse keeps Vali away.

Lao: Guay Duorahbi

Vali (Bari) offers a thousand pieces of gold to the one who can get rid
of the buffalo herd Dundubhi (Douorahbi). His wife and younger sister
Anjana (Kasiratdita) accept the challenge even though she is pregnant.
She kills many buffaloes, but one beast pierces her eyes with his horns
and rips her skirt to sheds. Since then, buffaloes have curved horns.
Anjana gives birth to two sons, one of whom is Anggada. The people sew
together the pieces of her skirt for her to wear, which is why Lao women
make patchwork skirts. Blinded, Anjana lives under a tree with her mouth
open upwards, waiting for fruits to fall.
At this time, a demon kills people with his poi9sonous hand. A woman
named Gandharvi (Guandawbi) accepts a king’s challenge to kill the
demon. She entices him with her feminine charms and agrees to become his
wife if he dances with her. The demon follows her movements and kills
him when she points to her head. The king is aroused to see her dance
and has an orgasm. Gandharvi collects the sperm and pours it into the
mouth of Anjana, who gives birth to Hanuman (Hanumon). One day, Hanuman
mistakes the sun for a fruit and flies over to eat it but it burned. The
sun sprinkles the elixir of life on the remaining bubbles of blood to
restore him. Hanuman now is endowed with power and the ability to change
into any form or size.
Meanwhile, Vali and Sugriva (Sanggip) are ashamed at their cowardice.
They chase the buffaloes into a cave. Vali kills them inside, but rain
makes their blood clear, so Sugriva leaves and becomes king. Vali
returns and tries to kill Sugriva, who flees into the forest and weeps
bitterly over his fate. He becomes covered in a mound of his own eye
mucus, from which his tears flow like a stream.

2- Perfect Prize
Table of content

Sankrit: Valmiki Ramayana

Janaka tells Vishvamitra, Rama, and Lakshmana that no one has been able
to handle the mighty bow of Shiva. “If Rama can discharge the weapon,”
he says, “then Sita is his.” Thousands of men bring in the bow, which is
mounted on a cart. Rama easily picks it up, but when he attempts to
string it the bow breaks in half with a thunderous roar. Janaka is
pleased and sends messengers to Ayodhya to inform Rama’s family of the
marriage. Dasharatha is overjoyed and leaves the following morning with
the royal entourage. The wedding takes place with great celebration.

Malay: Cherita maharaja Wana

Janaka (Maharesi Kali) decides that Sita (Sita Dewi) is old enough get
married. With divine help he creates an enormous underground serpent
with a palm tree growing on each of its forty curves. The gods send down
an arrow, and its sheath grows into a huge teak tree. Janaka decrees
that whoever lifts the arrow and uses it to shoot the trees will win
Sita’s hand, Janaka invites the sons of Dasharatha (Dasarata) to the
contest but warns that an ogre, a huge scorpion, and a fire-breathing
rhinoceros guard the way. Janaka takes Rama (Seri Rama) and Lakshmana
(laksamana) with him, and Rama kills the three monsters.
Rama lifts the arrow and shoots it , but it pierces only seven trees.
Lakshmana observes that the trees are moving and discovers the serpent
below. He tells Rama to step on the3 serpent’s head while the pulls on
the tail to straighten the trees, which Rama then successfully shoots.
The other participants claim that they did it, so Janaka asks them to
uproot the teak tree. Rama is the only one who can do it, using his
toes. Ravan leaves and waits along the way, planning to abduct Sita.
Janaka wants to invites everyone, including the gods, to the wedding. He
tells Rama to wait for him to return, and hides Sita among thirty-nine
statues of her in the temple. DRama gets impatient and starts searching
for Sita.
“Use a coconut leaf rib and tickle the eyes of each figure,” suggests
Lakshmana. The real Sita blinks, and she leaves reluctantly with Rama
and Lakshmana, fearing her father’s reaction. When Janaka returns, he
angrily predicts their separation.

Lao: Pha Lak Pha Lam

Ravana (Ravanasura=Rabbahnasun) hears about the beauty of Sita, so the
hermit asks him to lift his bow. Ravana fails and falls over on his rear
end. “If you try to take Sita away, you will not be able to even touch
her without feeling burned,” warns the hermit, “She is only suitable for
a bodhisattva, a future Buddha.” Ravana is insulted and asks the hermit
to lift his bow, which he does with one hand. Ravana plucks his
bowstring that explodes like a hundred thousand thunderclaps. The hermit
plucks his, and the sound drowns out the noise, echoing throughout the
universe. The noise and hide in the lotus pond frighten Sita and her
companion.
The hermit defeats Ravana in several fights, but feels sorry for the
ogre, he creates Mandodari(Suddo) for him. “You will die if you marry
Sita,” he explains. “Take this woman instead. The nine sons born to her
will have great supernatural power. If they are wounded her body will
heal them. The first and second only need to lick the tears from the
right and left eyes, the third and fourth her right and left ears, the
fifth and sixth her right and left nostrils, and t he seventh her mouth.
The eighth and ninth have to suckle at her right and left breasts.”

Ravana still wants Sita and goes to her palace but finds it empty, so he
follows the footprints to the lotus pond. He multiplies his hands to ten
thousand and pulls Sita and her companions out. They cry for help, and
the hermit plucks his bowstring. This startles Ravana and he dorps them
and flees with mandodari. Sita and her companions run back to hide among
the lotuses. The hermit calls out for them, and they emerge from their
hiding place.

Maranao: Maharadia Lawana

Spectators marvel at the ball-kicking skills of Rama (Mangandiri) and
Lakshmana (Mangawarna). Rama spins around three times as his rival
suitor’s approach, and then kicks the ball up into Sita’s (Malano
Tihaia) open window. She places her ring, handkerchief, and a small bag
of betel chew into the ball and throws it down onto Rama’s lap. He takes
out the contents and scatters the contents of the bag. Rama and
Lakshmana leave as the others fight over the betel chew.
When the sultan asks to see the ring, handkerchief, and betel bag, none
of them can show the items. Three days later, they return with three
objects that they claim being to her. The sultan asks Sita to identify
her items, but she finds none of them are hers. She asks her father to
search the kingdom for her property. Finally, the sultan visits the old
woman. He sees Sita’s handkerchief and betel bag hanging form the wall.
The old woman tells him that they belong to Rama. When the sultan
identifies the objects as the property of his daughter, the old woman
hides because she fears that Rama is a thief.
The sultan sees Sita’s ring on Rama’s finger and invites him and
Lakshmana back to he palace to begin preparations for the wedding of
Rama and Sita. His wife first asks that Rama kill the giant serpent in
the mountains, which has been blocking out the sun. Rama and Lakshmana
return home to make bows and arrows, and find the serpent asleep. “It
would be cowardly to kill a sleeping enemy,” says Rama, “When it wakes
up, each of us will shoot one of its eyes at the same time.” They climb
a tree and wait. The serpent smells their presence and opens its eyes,
and the brothers shoot their arrows and kill the monster.
The wife of the sultan does not believe that the serpent is dead and
asks for proof. Rama tells there to wait for seven days; during this
time the body rots, emitting an over powering stench. The people cut the
serpent up into pieces and throw them into the sea. The sun shines
again, and on that day the marriage of Rama and Sita is celebrated.
Several days later, Rama feels homesick and asks to return home. The
sultan is concerned of the dangers at sea, so Rama suggests a land
journey, a carriage is built and loaded with provisions for them. At the
edge of the forest some men build a house and garden for them. Rama,
Sita, and Lakshmana settle there in happiness.

Myanmar: Thiri Yama

Ravana (Dashagiri=Datthagiri) is only able to lift the bow as high as
his knees, but he claims victory and demands the hand of Sita (Thida).
Lakshmana (Lakkhana) easily picks up the bow, but he puts it back down
for Rama (Yama) to try. Rama lifts the weapon, strings it, and fires an
arrow with a thundering sound that disrupts Parashuraama’s (Bhazuyama’s)
meditaion. Parashurama angrily descends from his mountain hermitage. He
confronts Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana but refuses to accept Rama’s
apology. After a prolonged fight, Parashurama surrenders and asks for
forgiveness from Rama.

Khotanese: Ramakatha

Dasharatha (Sahasravahu) steals the cow of a priest, so that the holy
man and his son Parashurama are reduced to begging. Parashurama does
penance for twelve years, and Brahma grants him an axe with the power to
kill kings. He slays Dasharatha, so Kausalya hides Rama and Lakshmana
underground for twelve year. When the boys emerge, they search for
Parashurama and kill him in revenge for their father’s death. While
wandering in a forest, Rama and Lakshmana see Stia. They fall in love
with Sita, and t he hermit allows her to go with them.

Sanskrit: Valmiki Ramayana

Rama and Sita and their entourage meet Parashurama, a sworn enemy of the
ruling class since one of them murdered his defenseless father. He says
to Rama, “Now try your hand with my bow!” Rama easily strings the weapon
because it belongs to Vishnu and points the arrow at Parashurama, who
begs for forgiveness. As the arrow must have a target, Parashurama
offers his magical vision. After arriving home, Bharata, accompanied by
Shatrughna, leaves soon after to spend time with his grandparent.

Meanwhile Rama and Lakshmana find Sita missing. By observing the
movements of animals, they turn their search towards the south. Soon
they find broken weapons, parts of a chariot, and blood. Rama threatens

explains the events. Rama throws his weapon aside and embraces the bird,
which soon dies. Rama performs the cremation rites.
An ogress tries t o abducts Lakshmana and suffers the same mutilation as
Shurpanakha. Kabandha, a headless ogre with its face on its belly,
catches Rama and Lakshmana in his long arms. They cut themselves free
and kill him. Released from a curse, the ogre turns back into a
celestial being. Kabandha says, “One way to overcome hardship is to find
someone in a similar situation. A monkey named Sugriva has been deprived
of his kingdom and wife. Help him regain the throne, and he will help
you rescue Sita.” Kabandha returns to heaven, and Rama and Lakshmana
follow his advice. They meet Shabari, a female ascetic who points the
way to Sugriva’s dwelling. She then enters the sacrificial fire and
ascends to paradise.

Jatayu. Rama cremates the bird by holding the body in his arms, because
the ground for the pyre of such a noble creature must be pure and never
stepped on.

Lao: Pha lak Pha Lam

Finding Sita missing, Rama (Lam) wants to kill Lakshmana (Lak) but the
flying horse Kaustabhamani (Mahnikap) stops him. Rama orders Lakshmana
to make a fire for cooking, but is puzzled when he burns only one stick
at a time. “You are like this piece of wood, consumed with flaming anger
when you tried to kill me,” explains Lakshmana, “You would have been
alone and powerless. We must work together, just as a good fire is made
from a bundle of sticks.” Rama sees the wisdom in this.
Rama and Lakshmana mount the flying horse and being their search for
Sita. Three goddesses change themselves to look like Sita, but Rama
knows that they are illusions. When Rama asks to see the real Sita,
Kaustabhamani recites a spell that makes Ravana (Ravanasun=Rabbahnasun)
and the stone figure ring her back. While they are flying through the
sky, the garuda (gut) bird expands his wings to hide the sun, creating
darkness everywhere. Unable to see, Ravana wanders about.
Laughing at his confusion, the bird boasts, “only the ring of Rama is
stronger than me!” Hearing this, Ramana takes Rama’s ring from Sita’s
finger and throws it as garuda, cutting his wings and making the sky
bright again. With Kaustabhamani’s spell also broken, Ravana returns to

wings. The bird promises to help Rama and flies away.
