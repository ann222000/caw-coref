Hare Krishna to all members of ISKCON-Learn-Bhagavad-Gita!

We just wanted to inform you that we launched our new site
pariprashnena.com.

Pariprashnena.com was developed to have an online resource where

devotees can ask questions and get fast and intelligent answers.
Hence

the name Pariprashnena (to inquire submissively).

Devotees can ask questions that go from the Krishna conscious

philosophy to health advice, temple standards and sadhana practices.

Without complex registration procedures pariprashnena.com allows
anyone

to start participating immediately.

Five reasons to visit the site:

- senior devotees will provide answers.

- elegant and user friendly web 2.0 design.

- fast and simple free registration.

- intelligent conversations.

- participate in unleashing the educational power of the worldwide
vaishnava community.

Pariprashnena.com has been developed by ISKCON Tech,
( www.iskcontech.com )

a worldwide devotee group of programmers, designers and web developers
whose aim is to modernize Iskcon

sites and use the latest technology in Krishna's service.

Thank you very much

Hare Krishna!
