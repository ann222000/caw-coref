A Love to Hide - aka: Un amour à taire (2005) (TV)

I tend to like gay theme/ interest French films... okay, that was to
let you know where I'm coming from. This is a wonderful film that is
worth the time to download and learn to use srt subtitles. It is one
of about 25 films I've burned to dvd. The only problem with this film
is that it is so, so sad. It is a bit condemning of the French
government (as it should be), but does end on a small note of hope.
Well worth the time and effort. Oh, it was made for French TV.

There was no name attached to this upload at prq. Just a bunch of
random characters. I still would like to thank the person who did the
upload and those very few who seeded my download. It took 6 days to
get the complete film.

There are 8 avi formated segments that will need to be joined with
AJoiner or HJ Split before viewing. The English subtitles are in srt
format and can be found in the download folder.

Genre: Drama
Plot Summary: A young Jewish girl looking to escape the clutches of
the Third Reich after seeing her parents and sister brutally slain
while attempting to make their way to England is sheltered by an old
friend whose status as a member of the _third_ sex soon leads the
Gestapo pounding on his door as well. Betrayed by a smuggler who sat
idly by as her family was casually slaughtered by the SS, terrified
Sara flees into the comforting care of childhood summer-vacation chum
Jean and his faithful lover Philippe. Though safe for the moment
thanks to Jean's quick-thinking plan to pass her off as a Gallic
employee of his family's laundry business, Sara watches in horror as
her homosexual protector is forced into a Nazi labor camp as a tragic
result of a bad decision made by Jean's troublesome brother Jacques.

Why no distributor, 21 October 2006, 10/10
Author: bobla941 from United States

Other reviewers have shared their experience with this amazing movie.
I saw it in July at the Outfest film festival in LA. What I don't
understand is why this film has never been distributed in the US? In
will shortly be available on DVD, so at least it won't disappear. But
it should be seen as widely as possible, if not in theaters, at least
on TV.

Perhaps a letter writing campaign to HBO or Showtime? Or to Here TV
or to Logo? It would be a challenging movie for audiences, but the
quality of the film alone should draw people to see the film. I also
find it curious and sad that nearly all of my favorite gay-themed
movies are European. It seems that the US film industry has great
difficulty making this type of film, even with heterosexual themes.
