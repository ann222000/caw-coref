I hope Bruce doesn't embarass himself and us by using one of those candy-ass
fonts.  We need a rocking font for the new cd.

Okay, I'll bite.
What qualifies a rocking font and what would a cany-ass font look
like?
Is there a definition, or is it like pornography--I'd know it if I saw
it?

Yeah, and the packaging. This calls for some kick-ass plastic jewel
cases, not that folding cardboard shit. Oh yeah:)

I was just having a little fun.   I just figured that if we could critique
the song names, the # of songs, the cd title, etc., why not complain about
the font.  While we are at it, why do they use an ampersand to connect Bruce
with the E Street Band?  Why not the word &quot;and&quot;?  It seems a bit pretentious
to me.

I really don't know my fonts well enough to make the candy-ass/rocking
judgment call.

Longboxes are for pansies!  The CD needs to come in steel mesh
outfitted with barb wire, razor blades and broken glass.  Every listen
should come with the risk of appendage loss.

Now that's rockin'!!

&lt;sigh&gt;  Kick ass plastic jewel cases would be really nice.   I ain't holding
my breath, though. Damn Bruce! And damn his crappy cardboard packaging!

I ain't even going bother wishing for nice crisp color photos.  Why waste a
perfectly good wish on something that ain't gonna happen?  I'll just have to
learn to be happy with blurry black &amp; white shit that looks like a car ran
over it.  Why do you do that Bruce?  Why?  Why?

I just wish they'd make cd's bigger.
Like about 12 inches across.
Can you just imagine the cool artwork
that could be done with a canvas that
size?

As I said earlier today... BRING BACK THE LP-SIZED ARTWORK!!  Hell,
slide the stupid disc into a LP-sized cardboard sleeve, it won't get too
badly banged around.
Alternately, have the large cardboard sleeve fold open (origami!) and
have a tray glued into the center, to hold the disc in place.
