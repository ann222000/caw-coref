Bank Robbery Suspect Charged in 5 Unsolved Homicides
Raleigh, NC - Wake County authorities have charged a suspected bank
robber in connection with five unsolved murder cases.

Samuel James Cooper, 30, faces five counts of murder in connection with
shooting deaths in Raleigh and Wake County ranging from May 2006 to last
month.

On May 12, 2006, Ossama &quot;Sam&quot; Haj-Hussein, 43, was shot and killed
inside the In &amp; Out Food Mart on Creech Road in Raleigh.

Less than a month later, on June 3, 2006, LeRoy Jernigan, 41, was found
dead inside Circus Restaurant on Wake Forest Road in Raleigh, where he
worked as a cleaning contractor.

This year, Timothy David Barnwell, 34, died at WakeMed on April 27 after
police found him shot outside his second-story apartment at Windsor
Falls Apartments in north Raleigh.

And last month, a homeless man, Ricky High, 48, was shot and killed near
St. Augustine's College. Two days later, on Oct. 14, Tariq Hussain, 52,
was found dead inside Bobby's Grocery on Garner Road.

In a joint news release issued Tuesday morning, authorities said
eveidence and investigative information accumulated before and after
Cooper's arrest last week led to the charges.

&quot;These murders violently took victims from their families and friends,&quot;
Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison and Maj. Ken Mathias, of the Raleigh
Police Department, said in a statement. &quot;The fact that they occurred is
as deeply saddening as it is irrevocable, but we are grateful for the
relentless, cooperative work of many people in the gathering and
analyzing of evidence.&quot;

Cooper was arrested Nov. 21 after he allegedly robbed Bank of America at
547 Benson Road in Garner and led police on a brief chase before he fled
inside a Domino's Pizza distribution center. He was there for nearly an
hour before he was arrested and charged with robbery with a dangerous
weapon and felony speeding to elude arrest

Family members of some of the victims told WRAL Monday they had been
informed of their cases that morning.

&quot;I feel a bit relieved, but I think his arrest is good for the community
at-large as well,&quot; said Hussain's son, Khurram Tariq. &quot;Because you know
someone who is dangerous has been taken off the streets. So, we all feel
a bit secure.&quot;

According to court records, Cooper has a criminal record dating back to
1993 in Wake County that includes 10 arrests, 19 charges, including
assault on a police officer, escape from prison, robbery, assault on a
female, drug charges and larceny.

Cooper was one of three inmates who, in June 1999, overpowered a guard
and escaped from custody while on a Wake County inmate work crew. He was
apprehended a short time later.

At that time, he was serving a 20-year sentence for armed robbery,
assault and drug charges.

Authorities said they did not anticipate making further comments about
the case because of &quot;the magnitude and complexity of the cases and
because of the ongoing investigation of each of them.&quot;
