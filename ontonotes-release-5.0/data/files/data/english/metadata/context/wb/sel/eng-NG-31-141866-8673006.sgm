You know what - that's not a bad answer at all.  They acknowledge that it is
a difficult situation all around, but are taking slow but sure steps to make
a change.

Wish to God we could do the same here.

&gt; Dear Sir/Madam,

&gt; Your e-mail letter dated August 19, 2007 to Premier Chang concerning &quot;Pigs
&gt; of God&quot; issue has been referred to this Department for reply.
&gt; Firstly, we would like to express our sincere appreciation on your
cherished
&gt; opinions and reminding us of improving Taiwan's situation on animal
&gt; protection and welfare fields.
&gt; As to the issue &quot;Pigs of God&quot;, it is a part of traditional and
conventional
&gt; ceremonies in offering sacrifices to gods or ancestors with more than 100
&gt; years' history in Taiwan and has turned into special folk religious
cultures
&gt; in some local areas.  In face of issues regarding religions or traditional
&gt; cultures, Council of Agriculture (COA) usually holds the standpoint of
&gt; respect and consideration and takes measures with cautious attitudes.
&gt; Therefore, it will be a precipitancy to put a stop affirmatively on
related
&gt; activities of Pigs of God before making a common consensus among religious
&gt; group and the public.
&gt; In the light of doubts on inhumane treatments on raising or slaughtering
&gt; pigs of god, COA has requested all local governments set a detailed list
on
&gt; farms which raise pigs of god and make routine checking and counseling
since
&gt; 2006.  If the situation of law violation can be affirmed, the penalty is
to
&gt; be given according to the related regulations.
&gt; In recent years, many activities of sacred ceremonies have a tendency of
&gt; creativeness and fashion.  We also found some alternative pigs of god made
&gt; by flowers or flour to replace real animals.  These creative methods drew
&gt; the public's attention and added new elements to traditional Pigs of God
&gt; contest.  COA will keep on consulting and discussing with the related
groups
&gt; and hope to make some improvements and transformations on this issue.  At
&gt; the same time, COA will fortify law enforcement carried out by animal
&gt; inspectors of local governments.  We do believe that with the joined
efforts
&gt; from the governments, organizations, and private sectors, the correct
&gt; conceptions and ways of doing things in accordance with animal welfare
will
&gt; penetrate into every walk of our society and thus become a part of our
daily
&gt; lives.
&gt; Thank you again for your concerns and suggestions.  Any further comments
on
&gt; animal protection and animal welfare will be highly appreciated.

&gt; Sincerely,

&gt; Ing-haur Hwang
&gt; Director
&gt; Department of Animal Industry
&gt; Council of Agriculture
