U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero ruled that investigators eventually must
get a court's approval when ordering Internet providers and phone companies
to turn over records without telling customers.

WM-&quot;eventually must&quot;. Which mean nothing. Which means they can act without
court approval anyway for any length of time.

And we are sposed to just set down and eat this bowl of shit.

&quot;eventually must&quot; is cart before the ox.

&quot;eventually must&quot; could be applied to any right, to suspend and violate
that right until some time in the future when daddy court could step in.

In my thinking anyone operating in rights areas without court sanction is
conducting a criminal operation and are equally the foes of the state and
freedom.

I'm with you completely on this one, WM. If the gubmt's got something
on someone they should absolutely gather the proof and get a warrant.
Otherwise get the hell out of my life, and computer.

Acting without authority from a higher power that rests in the power of the
&quot;we the people&quot; and goes against the idea a more perfect gov'ment.

The court is not protecting us here! This is a wowfull departure from
accountability!

It is third world, KBG and Gestapo, that anyone would be granted power
without supervision to intrude into this area, amd in this fashion.
