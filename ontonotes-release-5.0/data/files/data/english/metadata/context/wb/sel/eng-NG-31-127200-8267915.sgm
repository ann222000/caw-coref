I think he started smoking crack. That would explain the hair too.

Seriously though I think he was quite overrrated to begin with,

Which brings up an interesting subject. Which players have suffered
the greatest sudden declines in their careers? Not talking about
unfulfilled promise or players gradually declining, but very good
players who in a very short period of time became a shell of their
former selves.

My candidates, in order of magnitude:

Shevchenko
Mutu
Cassano
Raul
Veron
Fowler
Aimar

Who else?

Kluivert was an extreme case. From missing some, he went to missing
them all. Others:

Denilson
Diego Tristán
Overmars (who ended up retiring at the age of 30)

But I do agree that Raúl is one of the most visible cases. Today, he's
dragging his body through the field, with a lot of effort but the
spark isn't there. Unless he has a physical problem he's told no-one
about, I suspect that, at 30, he has been playing for too long and
lost the zeal for the sport. Sometimes a change of air is good: he
should have left RM 4 or 5 years ago, to try and make it somewhere
else. A challenge is good, breaks the routines, you've got to prove
yourself, etc.

Best,

SMT

Pablito Aimar had a very good season at Zaragoza last year. I don't
think he can be considered a shell of his former self, etc. He did
have physical problems for a while, but he also did win things with
Valencia, not exactly a failure of a player. He did not become a world-
class player, but still a fine player who has a future.

Sheva had one bad season. I doubt that he's finished. He's a tough
guy. The rumor (actually, Berlusconi and Mourinho shouted it out) is
that Sheva's wife is exerting pressure, I don't know what kind of
pressure, and he has yielded. Whatever the story, he's not the kind of
guy who enjoys the bench, so he'll react.

And Verón is back on the Argentine national team, playing well,
apparently.

Best,

That was a lot at the time though.  Some players really do only bring it
for a couple (few) years.  In his case though I think he lost it as soon
as he left the environment he grew up in.  Tried to go to Italy or
something.  The point is, some players only bring the magic when all of
the boundary conditions are perfect (note I am not talking about
contracts or money here).  As soon as Mendieta left his eggshell, he was
done.

Motivation was also everything to him.  He started going down when
everybody expected him to become a leader, and that he never was nor,
most likely, wanted to be.

I think a lot of clubs who buy high profile players and expect them to
magically perform often (very strongly) underestimate the psychological
aspect of the sport.

Definitely declined but it wasn't sudden. He was still worth his place
in the RM side and possibly the Spain side in 2003/2004, though
definitely had slipped a bit.  I think the decline here was prolonged

Vieri ?  Some may say he was never that good, but up until about

Javier de Pedro - OK, not in the class of some of the others mentioned
here, but he was a starter for Spain in 2002, A big part of Real
Sociedad's success in 2002-2003, then absolutely useless thereafter.  I

Laurent Robert, though with his volatility it may be based more on

has allowed their own brattiness to obstruct greatness in such fashion?

Nicolas Anelka will take some beating.

Insofar as Anelka had potential for even greater &quot;greatness&quot; than did
Robert, you have an excellent point. But at least Anelka has remained
a good, proven goalscorer throughout his career. He's also only 28, so
may yet redeem himself. The talent is obviously still there, and he's
apparently quite the commodity at the moment.

The decline of Deco was very harmful for Barça. Whether he can climb
back remains to be seen. There are noises that he is bound for Italy,
but he may stay. I think Rijkaard has built the team withouth him, a
wise move.

Best,

&gt;&gt;Javier de Pedro - OK, not in the class of some of the others mentioned
&gt;&gt;here, but he was a starter for Spain in 2002, A big part of Real

&gt;&gt;can't think of many declines much steeper than that.

&gt; Diego Tristan?

Was still considered worth keeping around by Deportivo for a couple of
seasons and showed some flashes after Makaay left.  So probably not as
steep as De Pedro.
