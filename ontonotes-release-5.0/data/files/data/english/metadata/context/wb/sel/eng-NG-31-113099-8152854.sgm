'You have no future in this country'
By Daniel Ben Simon

At the height of the fury and the humiliation, the children of Hebron
wandered around among the men in uniform, trying to figure out who was
Jewish and who was not - who is from &quot;our&quot; seed, and who is from the
seed of Amalek. At a time when most Israeli children were spending
their summer vacation at day camps and on trips, splashing in the sea
and in swimming pools, the children of the Hebron day camp looked as
though they lived on another planet. Glowering with hatred, with huge
skullcaps and long curly earlocks, children age 10 and younger walked
among the men in uniform and examined their dog tags.

Anyone whose non-Jewishness was discovered received the appropriate
treatment: The wild, bleary-eyed little ones mercilessly hurled curses
and insults at them. They are mere children and already experts in
racial theory. Every possible epithet was hurled at the soldiers, but
they, perhaps on orders from above, were silent as though catatonic.
Their faces showed no emotion.

The children of Hebron are very reminiscent of the children at the
summer camps of Jesus - those who live in America's Bible Belt, who
have been poisoned by religious ideology and have become the spearhead
of Christian fundamentalism.

&quot;If someone comes to kill you, kill him first!&quot; shouted one of the
children at a Border Policeman with a non-Jewish name [both Russian
and Ethiopian immigrants and Druze were among the security units
present], moments after the evacuation of the families from the market
began on Tuesday. The youngster brought his face close to that of the
soldier until they were almost touching. &quot;It says in the Torah that I
have to kill you. You are from the seed of Amalek ... You are a goy
[gentile] and you are not allowed to tread on this holy ground. Get
out of here, you and your friends!&quot;

A &quot;Jewish&quot; soldier tries to calm down the rebellious child, and in
response is treated to a barrage of curses: &quot;You're not Jewish at all.
You're a Nazi. We'll kill you and all the Nazis who are here.&quot; Other
children, dripping with hatred, surround the group of soldiers and
observe them with amusement, as in a zoo. Their mothers sit on the
side and observe their glorious progeny, barely concealing their
enjoyment.

Several meters away, a woman named Anat Cohen is trying to disrupt the
evacuation of one of the houses. Emaciated, barefoot, wearing a head-
covering, she mercilessly curses the soldiers. While she is still
shouting, salvos are heard nearby: The Palestinians in the city are
celebrating the end of the matriculation exams and are firing in joy.
The Jews are convinced that these shots represent Schadenfreude, and
Cohen becomes hysterical: &quot;Get up, dogs!&quot; she shouts at dozens of
security personnel. &quot;Get up! They're firing in your honor so stand up
in their honor. The Arab enemy is firing salvos in your honor, for
what you are doing to the Jews.&quot;

A father and son, ultra-Orthodox Jews from New York, look at the
destroyed shops and their hearts fill with sadness. They speak Yiddish
to each other; the son, Shmuel Landau, photographs the soldiers who
are sprawled in every shady corner. Now it is 10 A.M. and the
evacuation has been completed. The soldiers from the Home Front
Command are sawing and dismantling and sealing up every possible
opening in order to prevent the evacuees from settling in again.

Shmuel plans to show the pictures to his friends from the Amshinov
Hasidic sect in the United States, which numbers only a few hundred
followers in Israel. &quot;They aren't Jews,&quot; he says, pointing at the
hundreds of men in uniform. &quot;We are the real Jews.&quot; His father nods in
agreement: &quot;You're asking about the soldiers, so I'll tell you. They
aren't Jews. Look at them, they're Russians, Ethiopians and Druze. And
even those who call themselves Jews are not Jews. They're Zionists and
leftists.&quot;

&quot;Israel's big problem is Zionism,&quot; continues Shmuel. &quot;It severed the
Jews from the Torah and from Jewish values. You have no future in this
country. In the end you'll all leave and only we will remain here.&quot;

&quot;Israeli&quot; is a dirty word in this hate-crazed enclave in Hebron. Not
one of the hundreds of residents here defines himself as such, as
though Israel were a penal colony. Even after the state has showered
them with protection, resources, assistance and even sympathy, these
people consider Israel to be a foreign government. Israeli sovereignty
has replaced the sovereignty of halakha (Jewish law) and in that way
has decreed for itself the status of an enemy in every respect.

Except for the presence of the soldiers, there is no sign here of
Israeliness, everything is Jewish: the street names, the hateful
slogans painted on the shops of the Palestinians, the long beards, the
skullcaps. There is dirt in every corner and the Hebrew spoken here is
poor as well. There are no secular books and no Israeli culture here.
Most of the children have never set foot on the soil of Israel per se,
and most of the adults have been there only rarely, mainly for medical
treatments, family celebrations and consolation visits to mourners.

&quot;I have nothing to talk to you about, you are not my nation and you
are not part of my nation,&quot; declared one of the veteran residents of
Hebron's Jewish Quarter, who wished to remain anonymous. &quot;You are my
enemies and I pray for the day when we will get our revenge for what
you did to us in Gush Katif and what you're doing to us in Hebron. I
hate you more than the Arabs. You will pay forever for what you did.&quot;
He is 53 and a father of eight. On the day of the evacuation this
week, he got up early and reported to the battlefield with his
children.

&quot;We didn't go all the way with you because we decided to wage a
passive war,&quot; he said. &quot;We are leaving the major war for the end. You
have no future in this country, so tell your friends to make use of
the time still left to them. We will be victorious with the bellies of
our women.&quot;

Crisis of faith

The disengagement from Gush Katif gave rise to a crisis of faith of a
kind that the settlers have not experienced since the 1967 Six-Day
War. Even in their worst nightmares they didn't imagine that the
government would go all the way and uproot Jews from the &quot;holy&quot; ground
of Gaza. For years they became accustomed, or to be more precise were
allowed to become accustomed, to dictating to the government how to
behave. Suddenly former prime minister Ariel Sharon came onto the
scene and changed the modus operandi. Even at the height of the crisis
they followed the words of the rabbis, who declared &quot;It will never
happen,&quot; believing that in the last moment a miracle would occur and
prevent the decree. Since the disengagement many settlers have severed
themselves from the outside world. The shock of the uprooting is a
still-oozing scar.

Already during the first attempt to go up to the evacuated West Bank
settlement of Homesh, about half a year ago, the weakness of the
government vis-a-vis the rabbis' determination became evident. One
thread, as strong as steel, links the evacuation of Amona to the
ascent to Homesh, to the attempt to return to the destroyed Gush Katif
settlements and to the events of Hebron: a determination to erase the
disgrace of the disengagement from the settlers' consciousness. They
will never again evacuate willingly, they will never again go like
sheep to the slaughter. In light of this, the hatred for the state and
its institutions has increased, and the status of the fundamentalist
rabbis, many of them members of the rabbinical council of Yesha (Judea
and Samaria), has been strengthened even further.

Two years after the evacuation from Gush Katif the government is
facing an internal threat with strategic implications for its future
image. This is a fateful moment in the tense coexistence between those
who favor secular values and those who cherish halakha. It is not
clear whether hundreds of thousands of skullcap-wearers will continue
to see themselves as part of the state if a peace accord is reached
that will require a major evacuation of West Bank land.

In such a case the army, which is a reflection of the society in which
it lives, will posit an existential dilemma between those who favor
the sovereignty of the state and those who favor the sovereignty of
the halakha. For the first time since the territories were annexed to
the State of Israel in the Six-Day War, it seems that Israel will not
be able to avoid this expected confrontation. The first signs were
seen this week during the evacuation of Hebron, when dozens of
soldiers preferred the halakhic decision of rabbis to orders from
their commanders.
