&quot;Beneath A Crimson Sky&quot;

oOOOo

Dear Readers,

Thank you for sticking around so long until I was able to sort out
some personal problems that kept me from updating these stories you
love so much.  I enjoy writing very much and I enjoy making people
happy with what I write.  I also had to fix my broken computer.  In
the next coming months I'll be starting my first professional novel.
This doesn't mean I'll stop writing fan fiction.  Doing fan fics is
good practice for me.  It may take me some time to get the story
finalized but I've decided to go ahead and finally write it.  Wish me
luck and in the mean time please enjoy this long awaited update.

Sincerely,

TheZorch

oOOOo

&quot;Does this mean you'll be leaving us, Ranma-kun?&quot; Kasumi asked
worriedly and holding onto him tightly as though if she let go he
might slip away from her forever.

Ranma shook his head.  &quot;No, he'll likely trace me here and if I'm not
around ...  I won't let anything happen to you or your family,
Kasumi-chan.  Not as long I live under this roof.&quot; he told her and
kissed her gently on the cheek.

&quot;Always the playboy I see, love.&quot; Sanangi said with a smirk.

&quot;Well, so what's gonna be the plan mates?&quot; John asked.

&quot;We have a short time before he finally finds Ranma here.  We need to
make the most of it and prepare for him.&quot; Sanangi told him.

Ranma let go of Kasumi and cracked his knuckles.  &quot;Ok, lets get
started.&quot;  And all the rest of that night Ranma, Kasumi, and his old
friends made preparations for war.

oOOOo

Chapter 5

A door opened to a darkened room.  A big man dressed in an expensive
looking business suit came in and immediately went to the bed in the
far corner.  He regarded the young girl laying there sprawled naked.
The man reached towards her neck, he resisted the urge to explore
impressive natural attributes.  His fingers felt for a pulse on her
neck, his arm grazed the top of one of those large attributes and he
pulled his arm away.  He'd have a chance to explore this girl further
but at the moment she was intended for someone else.  The boss of his
Yakuza clan would have his head if he took advantage of a working girl
while she was on the job.

Across the room he heard a sound and turned around slowly.  He knew
what was in this room and was smart enough not to draw his gun.  Not
that it would have done him any good anyway.

&quot;She is not dead comrade,&quot; said someone in perfect Japanese from
where he heard the sound in a thick Russian accent.  &quot;I could never
deprive your organization of such an impressive asset.&quot;  The source of
the voice was a shadowy form in another corner.  The shadow moved
partially into the light revealing itself to be a man with a young
woman sitting on his lap.  The women's head hung limply to one side, a
pair of fresh bite marks on her neck oozing blood were easily visible.

&quot;This one, however, was delicious,&quot; said the man in the corner.

The man in the suit waved dismissively and said, &quot;That one was a
troublemaker anyway, you did us a favor actually.&quot;

Dragasoni climbed out of the chair and gently laid the dead girl into
it.  &quot;I am pleased that this had helped you, comrade.&quot; he said.  He
walked past the man and stopped at the side of the bed.  His hand
reach out and gently caressed the young girl laying there.

&quot;Magnificent,&quot; he said as his hand gentle fondled the girl.  &quot;I
didn't know there were any pure bred Japanese girls who were D cups.
Especially at the age of twelve.&quot;

The man in the suit looked surprised and asked, &quot;How did you know she
was pure Japanese?&quot;

Dragasoni looked at this with a fang filled smirk and replied, &quot;It
was once said that women were like a fine wine.  Therefore, I took a
sip.&quot;

The man's eyebrow went up.  He didn't remember seeing a bite mark on
the girl but then he'd heard that vampires could hide them easily.
Remembering why he came here in the first place he reached into his
jacket and pulled out a manila folder.

&quot;These were taken a few days ago,&quot; he told Dragasoni as he handed the
folder to him.

The folder three photographs, two of them were of a young boy wearing
black trousers and a red Chinese shirt and the last of a red headed
girl wearing similar garb.  One of the pictures of the boy had a girl
in it.  A young girl in a school uniform with long lustrous hair.  The
other pictures had the subject alone.

&quot;They match the description of that person you're looking for,&quot; the
man told him.  &quot;The picture of the red head you were looking for was
taken in the Tokyo suburb of Juuban-ku.  The others were taken in
Nerima-ku.  The guys who took them work for the boss's cousin who runs
those territories.&quot;

Dragasoni eyed the pictures closely, especially the one with the
young school girl in it, and pulled out a picture of his own.  It was
a photo of Ranma standing in the fighting stance facing off against a
beautiful, dark skinned African woman.  &quot;Da, this is good, very good
comrade,&quot; he said with a smile.

&quot;Not long after these were taken the boss's cousin lost contact with
one of his special businesses,&quot; the man explained.  &quot;When they arrived
everybody was knocked out cold and couldn't remember a thing.  Two
working girls were missing, all paper records at the business were
gone and none of the guys would even remember them.  They're still
missing.&quot;

Dragasoni laughed, &quot;You won't find them, they are far from your reach comrade.&quot;

&quot;There ain't nobody who's beyond the reach of the Hokobi clan,&quot; the
man said proudly and puffed up his chest.

Dragasoni leveled a fierce gaze on the man and his show of pride
suddenly deflated.  &quot;If you knew what this young boy was you'd be
shitting your pants right now comrade.&quot; he said to him and held up the
picture with Ranma on the street alone.

&quot;He's one of you?&quot; the man asked him suddenly looking nervous.  The
Yakuza may do work for vampires from time to time but they knew damn
well to leave them alone.

&quot;Somewhat, he's one of those Crimson Circle traitors,&quot; Dragasoni told
him and the man suddenly showed fear in his eyes.  The Crimson Circle
was well known to some in the Yakuza.  They knew enough about them to
know that pissing them off was a very bad thing to do.  Screwing with
people's memories would be child's play for a vampire.  The man
realized that his boss's cousin's men got off easy.  That Crimsoner
could have slaughtered them all without breaking a sweat.

&quot;Arrange for me an airline ticket to Tokyo for tomorrow morning,&quot;
Dragasoni ordered and turned around towards the sleeping girl.

The man looked confused and said, &quot;But, Dragasoni-san, its morning
already today.&quot;

Without looking back at him, Dragasoni replied, &quot;I wish to play with
this one a little more before I go, comrade.&quot;  The man backed away
sensing that his presence in the room was no longer desired.  He'd
have people come in and get the dead girl out later.  As the door
closed he saw Dragasoni's robe fall to the floor and the vampire
climbed onto the bed.  The sound of creaking bed springs echoed down
the hallway long before he reach the end of the hall.

oOOOo

The sun shown brightly upon Tendo-ke as Sanangi inspected the last of
the protective wards.  She had to admit that Ranma's work was nearly
perfect.  After he drew the wards on the walls and windows of the
house she went around and added additional protection in for form a
surrounding ring of symbols and runes.  John Powder place powerful
wards which would repel anything evil from the house.  Well, anything
supernaturally evil at is.  The wards were strong, very strong, but up
against a vampire like Dragasoni they might not be enough.  Having
them in place though was far better than not having any at all.  If he
was determined to get in they wouldn't stop him for long but would
serve to deter him if he saw no profit in doing so.  The idea was to
keep him away from Tendo-ke, draw in away from the generally populated
areas and take him on somewhere far more open.

The sight for the fight had already been picked.  Ranma recommended
the construction site for a new high rise building near the financial
district.  It wasn't far away and would give them the open room they
needed to take him on.  It would take all three of them to handle
Dragasoni.  He was an ancient vampire far older than Sanangi herself.
A dark at his age was a terrible thing to behold but Dragasoni made it
worse.  The man was a lunatic, an animal.  At first impression he
might seem suave and debonair but once of blood lust was unleashed
that persona disappeared and a ravenous beast emerged.  The point was
though, nobody who had ever gone up against Dragasoni ever survived to
talk about it.

&quot;This is going to have to do,&quot; Sanangi said as she finished the final
ward.  An arm snaked around to hold her from behind a softly grazed
the underside of her ample breasts.  She smiled when a pair of warm
lips placed a kiss on her neck.

&quot;If I didn't know any better, love, I'd say you were trying to tell
me something.&quot; she said seductively as she reach back and caressed the
arm of the young man holding her.

&quot;Maybe I am,&quot; said Ranma's soft voice in her ear.  Sanangi relaxed
into his embrace feeling the contours of Ranma's well muscled chest
press into his back.  She smiled impishly the instant before she
exploded into movement.  The first thing she did was slide down out of
Ranma's embrace.  Her hand with a blade came up to block in Ranma's
hand which had been coming around towards her throat.  When metal
collided with metal the duel began with ferocious earnest.

The bodies of the two combatants moving so fast their featured were
blurred.  Only their blurred  colors could be soon allowing anyone who
saw the fight to tell the two apart.  The ringing of metal against
metal founded in rapid waves across the neighborhood.

Tendo Akane went out onto the back porch and gawked at the two as
they went at it.  She felt really good today for some reason.  The
girl was practically glowing.

As she watched Ranma and Sanangi seemed to almost defy gravity as
they delivered blow after blow which the other countered perfectly.
She noticed John sitting against the wall watching them with an almost
bored look on his face.

&quot;Do they duel all out like that all the time?&quot; she asked him.

John smiled and said, &quot;All out?  Hardly, Sheila, they're holding back
quite a bit there.&quot;  Akane looked at him like he'd suddenly grown a
second set of arms.

She gestured towards the two and yelled, &quot;You call that holding back,
you gotta be kidding me!&quot;

John shrugged his shoulders and replied, &quot;The city block is still
standing ain't it?&quot;  If Akane's jaw could have falling through the
floor of the porch it would have at that moment.  She turned back
around to watch the two and fell down onto her haunches.

Before Ranma came she'd been considered the best fighter in Nerima,
the best martial artist in the entire region.  That all changed when
he showed up and though he'd only been here for a very short time
people were already starting to talk.  The pounding he'd given Kuno
the other day was seen by the entire school.  He was the master of his
branch of the Anything Goes school, and she was still just learning.

The two blurs continued to race around the yard, up onto the wall,
and onto and over the roof of the house.  A particularly loud clang of
steel issued and two blades went flying.  Akane panicked as they went
straight towards her.  Before she could get herself to dodge John
appeared at her side and caught the blades between his fingers.

&quot;Hey you blokes, watch out for the spectators!&quot; he yelled at the two
as they shifted into hand-to-hand fighting.

&quot;Gomen,&quot; Ranma and Sanangi both replied without taking their
attention away from each other.

Akane could only watch them wide eyed as the fight continued.  The
two still moved so fast they blurred.  After what seemed like an
eternity one of the blurs went flying and landed in the koi pond with
a loud splash.  In side the house, Kasumi let out a sigh and smiled as
she went to the sink to fill the tea kettle.

Sanangi, coughing and sputtering, came to the surface of the pond and
looked up at a smugly smirking Ranma in disbelief.

&quot;You've gotten better,&quot; she said impressively.

&quot;So have you,&quot; he told her and offered his hand to help her out.

As he pulled her out Sanangi tugged, hard.  With a yelp Ranma went
face first into the water and came up sputtering.  John laughed and
tried very hard not to get a nosebleed since both women's shirts now
clung very tightly.

&quot;That was dirty,&quot; Ranma said to her with a hurt expression.

&quot;Yes, love, and that's why it was so much fun.&quot; Sanangi replied with
a shit eating smile when she got out of the pond.  Something similar
had happened to this a long time ago, but it was Ranma who pulled
Sanangi into the water.  If he remembered right, that was the night he
lost his virginity.

Ranma laughed and got out of the pond.  She wrung out her shirt and
went to the kitchen to get some hot water from Kasumi.  A few minutes
later a male Ranma emerged.  Akane didn't notice right away, but
Ranma's clothes were suddenly dry.  John handed Sanangi back her
blades with a rye smile and the African beauty just rolled her eyes at
him.

oOOOo

Yuka sat quietly in Nerima-ku's largest park and watched the children
play.  She often dreamed of finding the right man someday and having a
family.  Often she pretended to be a happy mom sitting by the play
area watching her precious child having fun.  Girls had dreams and
aspirations just like men did.  Will I have a boy or a girl, she'd
often ask herself.  Have children often lead her to the thought of
intimacy and that's where things got ... interesting in her thoughts.
She often had to stop herself hoping nobody saw the bright red blush
on her face.  The idea of doing ... that ... with a guy was foreign to
her but intriguingly intoxicating at the same time.  Yuka heard other
girls talk about their first times and wondered if hers was going to
be just as good.

So deep was she in her thought that Yuka didn't hear Ranma walk up
and sit down beside her on the bench.  Actually, not even a bat could
have heard the vampire/martial artist with a parabolic microphone.
When he wanted to approach unheard and unseen you &quot;will not&quot; hear or
see him.  He could feel what she was thinking, could sense the warmth
of the blood rushing to her cheeks as she blushed, could hear the
tightening of the skin of her breasts.  He could even smell, well, her
willingness to procreate.

He'd almost forgotten their date.  A part of him felt bad for leaving
his friends behind to watch over Tendo-ke while he went out but
Sanangi insisted that he go.  His mind was also on a strange
impression he got from Akane not long ago.  It was back when he and
Sanangi were sparring.  Happened right when they fell into the pond.
It was a fleetingly stray thought and quickly suppressed but he could
have sworn he felt Akane become aroused at seeing them wet, and
himself female.  It intrigued him enough to warrant investigation
later on.  He realized that it might answer a lot of unanswered
questions about the youngest Tendo sister.

&quot;Hello,&quot; he said quietly into Yuka's ear.

If she could have jumped a thousand feet into the air she would have.
When she saw it was him she instantly settled down, sat back down
beside him and gave him a playful punch in the arm.  Ranma didn't even
notice it.  Might as well have been a mosquito landing on his arm.

&quot;You scared me, you!&quot; she laughed.

Ranma laughed in return, &quot;Sorry, you were looking distracted.&quot;  Then,
smiled when she put her hands to her face and blushed furiously.  The
thought occurred to Yuka that Ranma could be a mind reader.  After all
they had a girl in their class who could read the taro cards and her
predictions were often accurate.

&quot;You're late, you shouldn't keep a pretty girl awaiting you know.&quot;
she said turning away from him and putting on an obviously fake angry
expression.

She blushed again even more furiously when she felt his lips gently
brush against her ear.  &quot;I'm sorry, something important came up at
home.  Will you forgive me, Yuka-chan?&quot; he said softly.

&quot;Buy me ice cream,&quot; she replied with a smile a mile wide.

oOOOo

Soun looked across the dinning room table nervously.  His friend had
been noticeably absent ever since Ranma's friends arrived.  Why was he
so afraid of them or reluctant to be around them.  Did they have some
kind of history together he didn't know about.  They seemed like nice
people.  The ebony toned African woman was remarkably beautiful and
very polite.  The Aussie reminded Soun of a young Genma in some ways,
but he had a feeling that it was in his best interests and survival to
keep that opinion to himself.  The two got along with his daughters
rather well.  Akane talked martial arts with Sanangi, she had been
impressed with the level of skill she demonstrated when sparring with
Ranma that morning.  Nabiki and Kasumi chatted a bit with John.  His
strong accent and speech mannerisms reminded him of the late Steve
Irwin.

&quot;So how did an Aussie end up in China?&quot; Nabiki asked the Paul Hogan
clone sitting across from her at the table.

Johnathan smiled and replied, &quot;Sanangi and me got friends over there
in China.  Was visit'n them when we ran into Ranma and his pop.&quot;  The
truth was they knew each other for more than twenty years thanks to
the time dilation effect inside the order's monastery.  But he
couldn't tell her that.

&quot;How did you meet Ranma-kun?&quot; Kasumi asked.

&quot;Sanangi and him's got the same fighting sensei,&quot; he explained.  &quot;She
challenged Ranma to a sparring match and they've been good buds ever
since.&quot;  He couldn't tell her that Lee-sensei assigned her to teach
Ranma and that she was the one who finally beat all those stupid
notions about women out of him that his father had taught him.
Sensing her thoughts he thought it would be best to keep secret the
fact that she and Ranma had been intimate on more than one occasion.

Nabiki just shook her head.  &quot;Martial artists,&quot; she sighed.

Soun decided to see what was keeping his friend.  He felt like he
could trust these two gaijin, he wasn't sure why but it was a very
strong feeling.  He first checked the guest room upstairs where Genma
and his son stayed.  It was right across from Kasumi's bedroom.  As he
opened the door he saw his old friend sitting on the floor going
through items in his pack.

&quot;Saotome, you aren't leaving are you?&quot; Soun asked him after quickly
moving into the room.

Genma looked startled for second but recovered quickly.  He wanted to
tell Soun everything about Ranma but the boy had put a damn mental
command in his head that no amount of meditation could get rid of that
prevented him from saying the truth.  Ranma had felt it was ironic
having to do that to him to keep his secret.  Here he was a man who
wouldn't tell the truth to save his soul and now he has a mental block
preventing from telling the truth.  The idea made Ranma laugh for
hours.

&quot;There are things I've got to tell you Tendo but I can't,&quot; the big man replied.

&quot;Saotome, we've been friends for years.  We endured the torture of
your mast ...&quot; Genma whipped around and clamped a hand over Soun's
mouth.

&quot;Don't you remember, talking behind his back brings the demon back!?&quot;
he exclaimed.

Soun's shoulders drooped and he apologized, &quot;Gomen, but why can't you tell me?&quot;

Genma sighed, &quot;I can't tell you that either, and its really starting
to piss me off.  What I am able to tell you Tendo is for you to watch
Ranma and those two downstairs.&quot;

Soun smiled at his friend and said, &quot;Well, of course I'll watch over
your son while you're away.&quot;

Genma suppressed the urge to body slam his old friend.  &quot;No, I mean
watch them.  As I said there are things I can't talk about right now
and until I can I'm really worried for you and your daughters.&quot;

Soun looked at him in surprise.  Was Genma actually implying that
Ranma wasn't to be trusted, his own son and soon to be husband to one
of his daughters.  It couldn't be, Ranma seemed like such a nice and
well adjusted young man.  Kasumi and Nabiki seemed to get along with
him rather well.  Akane was another thing but then again she was
having issues with boys at the moment.  That worried Soun a little bit
but he forced it back to the back of his mind again to concentrate on
this problem.

&quot;You aren't making sense, Saotome.  Are you saying that Ranma-kun is
dangerous?&quot; Soun asked him.  The crying man wasn't known for his
attentiveness so he easily missed the look of frustration on Genma's
face as the man struggled against the mental block.

&quot;Just promise me to protect your daughters, Tendo.&quot; was all Genma could say.

Soun nodded still unable to really grasp what his friend was alluding
do.  He could never believe that the future owner of the dojo was a
danger to his family.  It just had to be something else, but what?  He
didn't get a chance to ask anything more when Genma grabbed up his
pack and leapt for the open window.  No soon did Soun reach the window
was the big man already out of sight.  He might have been overweight
but that didn't seem to hinder his martial arts any.  Alone in the
guest room, Soun began to ponder what Genma had said.  When he went
back down to the dinning room that feeling that he should trust the
two gaijin came back.  He smiled, Genma's warnings forgotten and went
back to his newspaper.

&quot;Oh no!  I forgot I was supposed to go to Sayuri's today and help her
with her math homework.&quot; Akane jumped up and ran for the stairs.  She
returned a few minutes later with her school bag and raced for the
front door.

&quot;It was nice meeting you,&quot; she said to Sanangi as she vanished.

&quot;That's one strange Sheila,&quot; John sent to Sanangi's mind so as the
others wouldn't hear.

He could feel the African princess laughing in her thoughts.  &quot;If I
didn't know any better I'd almost say she was trying to flirt with
me.&quot; she sent back.

&quot;Huh?&quot; the Aussie was so startled he nearly said it out loud.

Sanangi looked at Kasumi and Nabiki.  &quot;Those two don't know it, but I
suspect their little sister is a closet lesbian.&quot; she sent with a
bemused thought.

&quot;Cricky,&quot; he thought back.

oOOOo

The roof tops of Nerima made it easy for someone who was able to jump
very high to travel around town almost unnoticed.  With so many
martial artists living in the same town nobody gave a roof jumper a
second glance.  Thus, when a newcomer appeared in the skies above
Nerima nobody noticed.  Dragasoni rode first class on a private jet to
Tokyo Airport.  From there it was easy to make his way to Nerima
quickly.  He didn't even have to pay train fare.  He just walked on in
and nobody noticed him at all.  Well, nobody who was either mortal or
wasn't sensitive to the supernatural.  He rarely ran into those kinds
of people, and when he did they tended to not live very long.

Finding Ranma in this forest of roof tops and old television antenna
was at first going to prove itself to be a real challenge to the
ancient vampire.  That was until he picked up the unmistakably
irresistible scent of a virgin girl.  He saw her, she was a young one
of maybe sixteen years of age running down the street with a school
bag in her hand.  Something about this girl stirred a memory and he
withdrew the photograph.  It was her, the target's woman!  The ancient
Russian vampire grinned showing his fangs and raced after her.  There
wasn't anybody around when he got to the street level, scooped her up,
and they were both gone so quickly anyone who might have seen them
would have only seen a blur.

Akane didn't know what was going on.  Her mind was suddenly very
fuzzy and she felt like she was flying but how could that be?  She
struggled to clear the fog out of her head, it took some effort and
she quickly lost track of the time that went by.  When she was finally
able to see and hear things clearly she immediately wished that she
couldn't.

Dragasoni was surprised at how strong this mortal girl's mind was.
She was actually forcing her way past his control.  It turned him on,
he enjoyed it when girls fought back, and when her mind came
completely back to surface he decided to show her what she up against.
With one hand he completely ripped away the front of her dress, bra
and all.  She stood there in shock, totally naked and looking at him
with an expression of horror on her face.  He'd brought the girl to an
abandoned building on the outskirts of town he was using as a base of
operations.  Special wards placed on the outside would prevent anyone
from investigating any sounds from inside.  So she could scream all
she wanted, he wanted her to scream, and nobody would come to save
her.

Akane tried to scream but the air was knock out of her as she was
slammed against the wall.  She flew through the air again and landed
on an old, moldy mattress.  The big man who attacked her was on top of
her in an instant.  She cried and beat her fists against him to no
avail.  She was spared the pain of loosing her hymen because of her
exercises, but it still hurt being taken by this stranger none the
less.  How had some come to be here?  She was going to Sayuri's place,
where was here, how did she get here?  Her screams of pain and
humiliation echoed throughout the old building, but the wards outside
kept anyone nearby from noticing them.

On the other side of town in a small ice cream parlor a young martial
artist's ultra keen vampiric hearing detected the faint sound of a
scream.  A scream that sounded familiar.  He focused on the sound then
immediately realized it was Akane.

&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Yuka asked him noticing his distracted expression.
She was still enjoying the huge sundae he'd gotten her.  It was
expensive but he insisted on buying it for her.  She felt so lucky to
have found a rich guy.

He turned to her suddenly and Yuka found herself irresistibly drawn
to his bright blue eyes.  &quot;We had a great time,&quot; he told her and she
mechanically nodded.  She sat there looking off into space for a long
time after he darted out of the shop and eventually shook out of it.

&quot;Wow, I hope we have a date like that again.&quot; she smiled and went
back to her ice cream thinking they'd just had the best date she could
ever remember.

oOOOo

Coming soon in Chapter 6:

The dreaded encounter gets closer as Dragasoni arrives in Nerima.
Thinking that Akane is Ranma's girl he kidnaps..  Will Ranma arrive in
time to save both her humanity?  What will Nabiki do when she learns
Ranma's secret?  Everything in Tendo-ke is going in change in the next
chapter!
