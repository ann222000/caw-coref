Custom icons in IE show actual size, not scaled size

I'm using the below code to create icons, straight out of the google
maps api documentation.
I have a webform that you can point to what icon you want to use for
your Point on the map.
Safari/Firefox play nicely, and scale the custom images to the same
icon size no matter how big the picture is that I point at.
IE on the other hand, is displaying the full image for the icon, and
isn't scaling the icon images at all.

So, for example, the google image:

Shows up nice and scaled using the google icon declaration code. But
in IE, it displays overtop of the entire map.

Anybody run into this? I've included my code below. Outside of
mandating how big the icon must be to the user, is there a magic line I
need to add for IE to listent to the javascript scaling the code?

Stupid IE.
Thanks!

var baseIcon = new GIcon();
baseIcon.shadow = &quot;&quot;;
baseIcon.iconSize = new GSize(20, 34);
baseIcon.shadowSize = new GSize(37, 34);
baseIcon.iconAnchor = new GPoint(9, 34);
baseIcon.infoWindowAnchor = new GPoint(9, 2);
baseIcon.infoShadowAnchor = new GPoint(18, 25);

function createMarkerI(point, icnloc) {
var icon = new GIcon(baseIcon);
icon.image = icnloc; //icnloc =
&quot;&quot;
//Icon in IE shows full size, icon in other browser shows scaled size
same size of google placemarks.
//help?
