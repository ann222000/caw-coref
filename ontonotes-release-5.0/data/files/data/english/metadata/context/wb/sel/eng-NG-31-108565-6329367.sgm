Don Findlay has a link on his website about Plate Tectonics saying to
"ask a guru a question"  - down the bottom of his page

Does anybody have any idea of a reasonable question I could ask about
plate tectonics?  Does plate Tectonics have any questions?  Or only
answers?  And if it's only got answers, what's the biggest one?

What's the matter? Lose your audience? Lonesome? Bored?

Most trolling is done with a baited hook that the sucker doesn't see until
it is too late. You didn't even bother to attempt to hide the hook.

You are a poor excuse for a fisherman, and a troll.

Hey, don, ..I got one for you..
-------------------------------------------------
Quote:-
The greatest shortcoming, at least in the eyes of American geologists,
was the lack of an adequate mechanism for moving the continents.
Wegener proposed that the Earth's spin caused the continents to move,
plowing through the oceanic plate and producing mountains on their
leading edges. Geologists at that time understood enough about the
strength of rocks to know that this was highly unlikely. Wegener's work
was largely unaccepted in the northern hemisphere. In the southern
hemisphere, where geologists were familiar with the rocks that Wegener
used to support his hypothesis, continental drift was generally
accepted.
http://volcano.und.edu/vwdocs/vwlessons/plate_tectonics/part6.html

What is it about those nuts that they reckon Wegener was wrong when it
came to the crust, but it was ok for the lithosphere?

Well said Don, Crazy Platies is a right term &amp; proper definition for
those poor blokes. Gerry and Co have no mind of their  own ! They
believe they have of course,  but in fact their brains is just data

know arise !
Please note : THE QUESTIONS THEY KNOW !

Indeed they know all the questions which for those poor innocents
correspond to appropriate answere learnt by heart in their brain
formating machine aka Universities !!! Hence if you put a question
which they do not know, it's sheer nonsense to them .... and the funny
thing indeed is that in that case the ONE WHO KNOWS IS THE ONE WHO THEY
CONSIDER AS A FOOL !

Please Don,  read again THE COUNTRY OF THE BLIND of H.G Wells and you
will understand that any disccussion is waste of time with those mind
programmed things aka as geologists ! The only way as I  have found out
to break the spell they are under is the gudgeon and the whip* !!!...

Or what about this one, under the "more stories" banner:-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----
"Suction and pull drive movement of Earth's plates, U-M researchers
show.."
( http://www.umich.edu/~urecord/0203/Oct14_02/s_suction.shtml )
(Can anybody maybe find a few questions hiding in here?  )

"When two plates collide, one is forced beneath the other into the
mantle ....  creating what geologists call a subduction zone. Because
subducting slabs are colder and more dense than surrounding mantle
material, they tend to sink like a lead ball in a vat of molasses.
&lt;...&gt;  "It's been known that slabs (portions of plates that extend
down into the Earth) drive convection in Earth's mantle, and
ultimately the motion of the surface plates, but it hasn't been well
established exactly how that happens-the ideas have been fairly
vague," says Clinton Conrad, a postdoctoral fellow in the department
of geological sciences.

"There are two main ways these sinking slabs might influence plate
motion. If a slab is attached to a plate, the slab can directly pull
the plate toward the subduction zone. A slab that is not well attached
to a plate, on the other hand, can't pull directly on the plate.
Instead, as it sinks, it sets up circulation patterns in the mantle
that exert a sort of suction force, drawing nearby plates toward the
subduction zone much as floating toys are drawn toward the outlet of a
draining bathtub.

"To understand the relative importance of slab pull and slab suction
forces, Conrad and Carolina Lithgow-Bertelloni, an assistant professor
of geological sciences with whom he worked on the project, developed
models in which: 1) only slab suction was operating; 2) only slab pull
was operating; and 3) both slab suction and slab pull were at work.
Then they compared the plate motions that would result from each of
these scenarios with actual plate motions. The best fit was the model
that combined slab pull and slab suction forces.

"The model also explained an observation that has baffled
geodynamicists for some time. "The way the observation was originally
framed was that plates that have continents on them are slow, compared
to plates that are only oceanic," says Lithgow-Bertelloni.

But the real issue is whether or not the plates have slabs attached,
she says. Overriding plates, which have no slabs, are slower than
subducting plates, which have slabs. The explanation? Subducting plates
move faster because the pull effect acts directly on them, making them
move rapidly toward the subduction zone. Overriding plates are also
drawn toward the subduction zone-by the suction effect-but at the
same time, the pull effect creates forces in the mantle that counteract
that motion. The net effect is that overriding plates move more slowly
toward the subduction zone than subducting plates do.

"We've been able to explain that the difference in speed occurs
because slab pull generates mantle flow that counteracts the motion of
the overriding plate," says Lithgow-Bertelloni. "We also found that
this effect is only important for slabs in the upper 600 to 700
kilometers of the mantle. Any slabs deeper than 700 kilometers do not
contribute to this effect. They're important for driving flow in the
mantle, but they're not important for the pull."

Hey, .. I wonder if Stunami Sue will chip in that bit about 'mantle
wind'...coming through 'trapdoors', ...  Maybe after the break...  I
mean, ..are we supposed to think this rubbish actually has currency,
..and Plate Tectonics has a 'mechanism' of sorts?  (That's the question
for a guru, that is increasingly on everyone's lips...)

-----------------------------------------------
**The Story of Plate Tectonics**

The story of Plate Tectonics is a fascinating story of continents
drifting majestically from place to place breaking apart, colliding,
and grinding against each other; of terrestrial mountain ranges rising
up like rumples in rugs being pushed together; of oceans opening and
closing and undersea mountain chains girdling the planet like seams on
a baseball; of violent earthquakes and fiery volcanoes. Plate Tectonics
describes the intricate design of a complex, living planet in a state
of dynamic flux.
http://www.platetectonics.com/
------------------------------------------------

This would be a joke if it were not for the tacit support of
universities worldwide, and the billions of dollars that have been, and
still are, getting spent on it.  And to what end?  the load of hogwash
you can read on any of the (now) how many million sites (?) on Plate
Tectonics - being taught in our schools?    Don't you reckon we deserve
a better deal from our so-called 'professionals'?

And what's the question academics are intent on addressing?  Do plates
have slabs attached?

So, ..having witnessed how Plate Tectonics has painted itself into an
impossible corner, are we about to witness the demise of another sacred
cow?

IS ISOSTACY ABOUT TO BITE THE DUST?
-----------------------------------------
"...Isostasy is a term used in Geology to refer to the state of
gravitational equilibrium between the Earth's lithosphere and
asthenosphere such that the tectonic plates "float" at an elevation
which depends on their thickness and density. It is invoked to explain
how different topographic heights can exist at the Earth's surface.
When a certain area of lithosphere reaches the state of isostasy, it is
said to be in isostatic equilibrium. Certain areas (such as the
Himalayas) are not in isostatic equilibrium, which has forced
researchers to identify other reasons to explain their topographic
heights (in the case of the Himalaya, by proposing that their elevation
is being "propped-up" by the force of the impacting Indian plate).

"...In the simplest example, isostasy is the principle observed by
Archimedes in his bath, where he saw that when an object was immersed,
an amount of water equal in volume to that of the object was displaced.
"

Don,

The question in fact remains full and entire since Archimedes did not
find why the reaction to an immerged body had a vector directed radialy
away from Earth Center ... and in any of the 100 000 th books of

Don, I didn't get to the Hot springs,a change in plans. But, I did give your
questions and comments some thought and came up with:
There are two great questions in plate tectonics.
First, What are  the possible configurations (Both geometrical and
petrological) of a subduction zone, given several possible types of plate
boundary interactions and resultant thermodynamics?

And the other is an old question.
Are past geological processes the same as those of the present? ("Present
key to past.") For example, Do continental basement complexes, or the
sediments unconformably overlying them, show signs of either earth expansion
or of plate tectonics?

You can get the answers to these with a lot of googling, dusting off Ye Olde
Text books,or getting out into the field and studying what you find out
there. So far, it seems as though plate tectonics may win that contest. Who
knows, maybe boudins may play an important role here.

As far as 'Blobtonics and the Driving Force'...? These may help:

http://www.geophysik.uni-frankfurt.de/~schmelin/what-is-convection.html or

http://www.geophysik.uni-frankfurt.de/~schmelin/metol.html

A few Questions for earth expansionists still remain:
One:  If the earth did expand, what and where is the source for the
considerable amount of mass manifested in a relatively short time?  Given
current Newtonian type dynamics, evolved alchemy, and a bit of
thermodynamics,
this additional mass is a significant problem for earth expansionists.
Regardless of process, the results MUST be the petrology we think is below
today's crust. If EE can come up with a new mass breeder, PT just might
re-evaluate their schools of thought.
Another:
Where do the west coasts of both north and south America snap into the
jigsaw puzzle, just before expansion that is? Any correlations across the
pacific? Although we might find a few Archaean basement complex types of
correlations, which would be consistent with past configurations of
continents on a dynamic crust,  where are the geological correlations just
before the Triassic/Jurassic expansion event?

The main question I have is not so much with the mass problem nor the
basement complex matchers, but more like:

Given the surface area of a proto-earth sphere(oid?) with a radius of 3820
Km, (slightly larger than the present core), what is the depth of the ocean
given 1.37X10^9 Km^3 of water?
Timberwoof, you are good with numbers, how deep the proto ocean?

A quick calculation gives about 7.4565 Km of sea water above the proto
earth's surface,(One without ocean basins).
Not only no dry land, but all life had to be aquatic in pre-Triassic. So
much for Devonian amphibians and insects, as well as Glossopteris and
horsetails http://www.ancientmicroworlds.com/gallery2/Glossoptera.html . And
goodbye Ed Conrad's Man older than coal.
Possibly the tops of very high volcanic peaks saw daylight, but I think I'll
pass trying to prove that.
------------------

I will give you and other EE enthusiasts this: Rotational dynamics just
might play a greater role in creating recent topographical features, as well
as to contribute to the rheology of subsurface rocks and spheres. This still
needs a little work though. A migrating pole of rotation will create a
migrating equatorial bulge. A wave of topographic expansion with an
amplitude of 47 Km (27 Miles) just might give us some expansion type
effects,...No?

Guru Don, OK, there be a few questions. We can discuss possible answers if
you want to continue. I am a bit rusty in this arena, but still try to keep
active doing personal field work, though not as much as I used to. This
spring I am going to visit a field of old basaltic cones that contain
xenoliths of lherzolite and peridotite.  I understand that this locality is
not too far from a few hot springs. Should be an interesting trip. Think
'retrograde metamorphism and isotopic daughters'. Will E.

Rotational dynamics of the entire composition of the Earth determines
the geographical /planetary axis hence the axis cannot be considered to
have a relative motion to the surface or the planetary shape
deviation.The planetary shape deviation is a consequence of
differential rotation bands which are influenced by the composition of
the molten/plastic composition on which the surface crust rests.

There is a tendency to think of the Earth's axis as seperate to
rotational dynamics rather than presenting the axis as a consequence of
rotation and  especially differential rotation in the molten
interior..One of the reasons I abandoned proposing differential
rotation as a mechanism for both planetary shape and the mechanism for
crustal motion ,at least to this geological  audience,is that many
empirical concepts attribute a pseudo-dynamic of variable axial tilt to
explain observed phenomena or incorporate them (as that abstract does)
as a valid working principle.

I propose to take the example of differential rotation seen in the
plasma composition of the Sun and using that as a  rough guide to
working with the internal dynamics of the Earth and its consequences
which surface as planetary shape deviation and geological surface
features due to crustal motion.

http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/distance/strobel/starsun/strsuna_files/sun-ro...

The example in this form may be general but it has the distinct
advantage of working with rotational dynamics while considering that
the geographical axis is a consequence of  the rotation of a celestial
object rather than any seperate feature or having any influence.A
person can easily work with the rotating molten composition and the
geological/planetary consequences arising from the dynamics however the
indications are that dynamicists still wish to retain stationary
Earth/convection cells as the ad hoc solution to crustal motion with no
linkage to rotational dynamics and no linkage to the planetary shape
deviation .

Differential rotation refers to the dynamics of a molten composition
across the entire length of the rotating Earth  as determining
planetary shape deviation rather than the erroneous  'dead center of
the Earth'  which is traditionally used -

http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Srotfram1.htm

So,a common mechanism of differential rotation  for crustal motion and
planetary shape deviation rather than ad hoc solutions for planetary
shape on one hand and another convection cell mechanism for crustal
motion on the other.The more productive mechanism is differential
rotation but there is no indication that anyone will take it up as a
working principle for the Earth's geological investigations.

The link above had this to say about the earth's bulge.

" The bulge of the Earth's equator
Assuming the Earth is exactly spherical, we expect gravity to always
point towards the center of Earth. However, the centrifugal force is
perpendicular to the axis of the Earth. Except on the equator, therefore, it
is not exactly opposed to gravity, but adds a small horizontal vector
component, pointing towards the equator (dashed arrow in the figure). As a
result, not only is effective gravity weakened, but its direction is
modified--instead of pointing to the center of the Earth, is slants (ever so
slightly) towards the equator.

Does this mean that if you placed a perfect ball on a very smooth
horizontal surface, gravity would make it roll equatorward...? Suppose it
was so. That same force would also act on the water of the ocean and make it
flow equatorwards, and even the solid Earth might deform!

How long would this go on? Well, until the equatorial pile-up of
material forms a "hill" around the Earth, rising slightly towards the
equator, where its top would be. No more flow towards the equator would
occur once the slope of the ground, as modified by the hill, would be
exactly perpendicular to the effective direction of (modified) gravity. With
such a slope, a perfect ball placed on a perfectly horizontal surface would
no longer try to roll anywhere, and forces on oceans and on land would no
longer try to move matter horizontally. "

I can see some problems with your assumptions, (been there done that :) and
I
need to carefully compose a response, which may take a day or two, until
then, look up "Transform faults". Will E.

the motions of the Earth are involved.Their flexibility amounts to how

Heat,what heat !,do you call people stuck with celestial sphere
geometry for astronomy and stationary Earth mechanisms for crustal
motion capable of generating anything worthwhile much less
oppositiion.I needed people in geology to discuss differential rotation
as a common mechanism for planetary shape and crustal motion a few
years ago and left it without the slightest trace of anger,as far as I
am concerned if it does not take hold or their are no indications that
people can grasp differential rotation in the interior Earth as a
working principle then there is little I can do about it.I am not going
to shove something down people's throats nor convince them how silly
their stationary Earth mechanism for crustal motion is but I would say
that they do insult themselves when something more productive surfaces
and they are unable to adapt.

Here is what you do, Go back to the books, read the history of

Differential rotation is simply a consequence of rotational dymanics of
a celestial body which has a plasma/molten/plastic composition and it
is a matter of drawing the correct correlation between the dynamic and
its consequences with regard to planetary shape and subsequently the
motion of the fractured surface crust.It fits neatly with Wegener's
correct correlation between landmass positions and their motion
relative to each other and also brings planetary shape under the same
rotational dynamic.

Sure there are problems, exceptions and

There are too many undisciplined peoplw whio have had 'fun' with the
once noble discipline of astronomy and likewise  the same thing may
happen with geology.It has been a few years now since I proposed the
common mechanism for crustal motion and the Earth's shape and I always
presented it as a take it or leave it affair in stressing that a
mechanism is not essential to understanding the way surface features
evolve and that is the way I leave it.

There is dignity in allowing a concept to remain dormant  however I see
little dignity in retaining stationary Earth concepts (convection
cells)  which are only a means to an ad hoc end .Like Copernicus
remarked of those who created finely tuned concepts before he
dramitically altered the astronomical view,the same now applies to
geological conception for crustal motion -

" . although they have extracted from them the apparent motions, with
numerical agreement, nevertheless . . . . They are just like someone
including in a picture hands, feet, head, and other limbs from
different places, well painted indeed, but not modeled from the same
body, and not in the least matching each other, so that a monster would
be produced from them rather than a man. Thus in the process of their
demonstrations, which they call their system, they are found either to
have missed out something essential, or to have brought in something
inappropriate and wholly irrelevant, which would not have happened to
them if they had followed proper principles. For if the hypotheses
which they assumed had not been fallacies, everything which follows
from them could be independently verified." De revolutionibus, 1543
Copernicus

Again,I have never required anyone to grasp the rotational dynamics as
part of appreciating geology and I am not about to do it now.

Your reality is indeed strange -

I would hardly compete with these stationary Earth  notions when it is
easier to use observed differential rotation as a guide to what is
occuring in the molten composition beneath the fractured crust of the
Earth.

People have been working  with rotational dynamics as they apply to the
Earth's shape for centuries,it is nothing new,however why they fail to
make the Earth an exception in matters of the behavior of a rotating
molten composition in affecting crustal motion  I do not know.

If you can square the Earth's shape using a principle of  rotational
dynamics with the crustal motion models  which uses a non rotating
dynamic then good for you but even in broad outlines,it is easier to
put planetary shape deviation and crustal motion under a common
mechanism of rotational dynamics.

You might be interested in spreading rates of the sea floor to fit into your
model.  Many have looked at the surface configuration and find that
spreading rates and offsets is not a 'simple' problem of fluid dynamics. The
problem is that not only are we not a perfect sphere, but there is a
brittle, ridged crust interacting with the plastic material below. Now if
you were to study motions of the liquid and gas portions of the earth's
surface, (oceans and atmosphere), rotational dynamics do play a significant
role...As does convection and pressure differentials.

Here are a few links:

1.Not a simple problem,

http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/1994/94GL01594.shtml

2. Some slow, medium, and fast, spreading rates,

http://volcano.und.edu/vwdocs/Submarine/plates/diverg/slow.html

3.Here is a spreading rate calculator,

BTW,  I am not trying to prove you wrong, but just exploring possibilities,
pros and cons. I also remember having this discussion in the early 1970's.

Hello Don,

Took an interesting side trip with Oriel36 on rotational dynamics in this
thread. A question popped into mind and I do not have a quick answer and
would like to hear what you think. Oriel36 you are welcome to jump in if you
want.

Q. If the earth did NOT rotate (use the solar system as a frame of
reference). Would plate tectonics still operate? Since your study is with
earth expansion I'll rephrase the question,

If the earth did not rotate, would we have a different
configuration...geology of the crust and mantle than the one we have now?

It has been snowing here in S. Arizona, so I will be sitting in front of
this computer and try to revive a long dormant website. Have a good weekend.
Will E.

I do not think that you are getting it,let me write it in capitals just

in case you missed it before.Now some might consider it undignified and

in truth I would consider it the same however given that I have dealt
with feebleminded creatures with no sense of value and all to willing
to wander down stupid conceptual paths with no thought given to
physical consequences,I think a final statement can be  promoted in
such
simple terms that only the most mindnumbing cretin would fail to see it

THE ROTATIONAL DYNAMICS OF THE EARTH WHICH GENERATES THE PLANETARY
DEVIATION FROM A PERFECT SPHERE FEATURE IS ALSO THE SAME MECHANISM
WHICH GENERATES
CRUSTAL MOTION..

No doubt your  response will be controlled and all that
pretensious nonsense but you will still want to include convection
cells when that gets jettisoned through rotational; dynamics but then
again,I have never imposed rotational dynamics as a model,theory or
anything else.It is just a common sense view drawn from observing the
plasma on the Sun and applying it as a rough guide to the Earth's
molten and rotating interior.

Go waste somebody else's time,I tried to make this interesting for
everyone and if they cannot grasp the rotational mechanism then there
is absolutely nothing I could or would do about it.

You really don't have to shout, I do understand what you have to say and it
is an interesting thought. All you need to do to make it valid is to prove
it. Not only show us where crustal motion is driven by the earth's rotation,
but do a little math and physics that  backs up your theory. Here is a site
to give your rotational dynamics a little more oomph.(consider the path of
a point on the revolving earth compared to the rotating sun's surface...just
how fast is the sun's surface rotating?...? Will E.

On the other hand, if you are going to use the sun as your template, you
might want to re-read the following
material:

http://www.windows.ucar.edu/sun/Solar_interior/Sun_layers/differentia...

and follow the links in this paragraph to compare with your model.

"The interior of the Sun does not spin the same way as does its surface.
Scientists believe that the inner regions of the Sun, including the Sun's
core and radiative zone, do rotate more like a solid body. The outer parts
of the Sun, from the convective zone outward, rotate at different rates that
vary with latitude. The boundary between the inner parts of the Sun that
spin together as a whole and the outer parts that spin at different rates is
called the "tachocline"."

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I would hardly compete with these notions when it is easier to use
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; observed differential rotation as a guide to what is occuring in the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; molten composition beneath the fractured crust of the Earth.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; People have been working on rotational dynamics as they apply to the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Earth's shape for centuries,it is nothing new,however why they fail to
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; make the Earth an exception in matters of the behavior of a rotating
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; molten composition in affecting crustal motion  I do not know.

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you can square the Earth shape under a rotational dynamic with the
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; crustal motion which uses a non rotating dynamic then good for you but
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; even in broad outlines,it is easier to put planetary shape deviation
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and crustal motion under a common mechanism.

&gt; &gt;&gt; You might be interested in spreading rates of the sea floor to fit into
&gt; &gt;&gt; your
&gt; &gt;&gt; model.  Many have looked at the surface configuration and find that
&gt; &gt;&gt; spreading rates and offsets is not a 'simple' problem of fluid dynamics.
&gt; &gt;&gt; The
&gt; &gt;&gt; problem is that not only are we not a perfect sphere, but there is a
&gt; &gt;&gt; brittle, ridged crust interacting with the plastic material below. Now if
&gt; &gt;&gt; you were to study motions of the liquid and gas portions of the earth's
&gt; &gt;&gt; surface, (oceans and atmosphere), rotational dynamics do play a

&gt; You really don't have to shout, I do understand what you have to say and it
&gt; is an interesting thought. All you need to do to make it valid is to prove
&gt; it. Not only show us where crustal motion is driven by the earth's rotation,
&gt; but do a little math and physics that  backs up your theory.
">

You have plenty of math to back up your stationary Earth/convection
cell mechansim  so forget the appeal to meaningless equations until you
develop the slightest trace of intuitive intelligence.

You have the math to back up the Earth's rotation through 360 degrees
in 23 hours 56 minutes 04 secopnds and that puts you on the same level
as the other guys who have basic problems with the 24 hour day and
natural pheneomena.You can take it from me that I am disappointed with
genuine people who could have a feel for the rotational dynamics of the
Earth but still remain with people I consider little more than freaks.

Here is a site

<QUOTE PREVIOUSPOST="
&gt; to give your rotational dynamics a little more oomph.(consider the path of

You first priority is to gauge that a rotating composition ,such as the
molten interior of the Earth , will have  a differencial feature
between the maximum rotation at 1000 miles per hour at the Equator
diminishing to 0 miles at the poles.This has been known,in part ,for
centuries.

What is known for the last century is that the Earth has a fractured
crust that moves,the natural tendency should be to graft the rotational
dynamic which causes the Earth to deviate from a perfect sphere as the
same mechanism for crustal motion.

I have dealt with too many halfwits to care whether you consider the
rotational mechanism or not,from your replies I strongly suggest you
remain with your convection cel;l mechanism where you can do no  harm
and where you have plenty of company.

I presented you with what is observed on the rotating composition of
the Sun as a rough guide to the internal dynamics of the Earth and you
return with something like this .

I have little expectations other than there may be a few people with
enough intutive intelligence to consider the physical considerations
involved is applying differential rotation and a dynamic which gives
the Earth the shape it has.Not even the requirement to associate it
with crustal motion,just  the basic working principles to extract
information about the Earth's internal dynamics and composition.

Look,enjoy yourself with convection cells and  other stuff like that.

parallel the rotational dynamics that cause the Earth's shape to
deviate from a perfect sphere.

Stick wioth your ill-considered dynamic based on the dead center of

Maybe your stationary Earth/convection cell dynamics can explain it
but then again you are going to have to square the stationary Earth
mechanism with the rotational mechanism which causes the internal
molten composition to deviate from a perfect sphere.

I can sit and wait for the thing to develop as I have for a number of
years,as far as I am concerned it is no conclusion but basic working
principles based on rotational dynamics.I do not bother to force
conclusions where none are needed but I will draw a distinct and
definitive  association between the dynamic of crustal motion and
planetary shape deformation.If you do not like it then go your own
way.

After  planetary deviation as the largest  known geological feature is
the Mid -atlantic ridge which basically shouts out loud that
rotational dynanics are involved in crustal evolution and motion -

http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/vents/acoustics/images/haru_atl_locs-big.jpg

The problem is not rotational dynamics of the molten interior
composition,the problem is that the intutive faculty which normally
affirms ideas based on physical considerations does not exist,the
associative qualities which astronomers and geologists once relied on
are almost entirely absent while undisciplined guesswork has takes its
place.

I would not know what to say further than what I have already
presented in outlines,the basic relationship between the different
aspecyts of planetary shape,crustal motion,geological features and
underlying rotational dynamics (something that is known for centuries)
and still nobody will move on it.

Stick with convection cells because I certainly do not care to discuss
geological matters with people who adhere to that ridiculous ad hoc
affair.

oriel36,

Just a bit more background reading.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge

To say that the rotation of the earth has an effect on crustal motion is
probably correct. Just HOW MUCH still has to be determined. But to say that
the earths' rotation is THE CAUSE of crustal motion requires a lot more
evidence and scientific methodology than a casual observation of the fluid
behavior of the Sun.

In your view, does plate tectonics (convection,spreading,subduction) play
any role in crustal motion? Is rotation the sole cause or can you accept a
combination of various forces and causes?  Will E.

If you accept a rotational dynamic for crustal evolution and motion ,
the stationary Earth/convection cells have to be jettisoned.The
physical considerations involved in using rotational dynamics for
creating the planetary deviation from a perfect sphere  would then
mesh with the rotational dynamic for crustal motion.

Just HOW MUCH still has to be determined. But to say that

Then stick with your convection cells and wax lyrical about
scientific methodology,if you can create a dynamic which has no
possibility of being represented in terms of surface
features,planetary shape and the overall  majesty of  planetary
geology then why should I care.The ease of differential rotation in
the rotating molten interior composition satisfies  the requirements
for all rotating celestial objects that are not solid but are in a
molten/plastic state.

Tycho Brahe wished to retain a partial geocentric view however his
arrangement would have led to the orbit of the Sun intersecting
Mars.Likewise convection cells are not based on physical
considerations but rather an ad hoc measure to make crustal motion and
tectonic activity more plausable however in order to square the
dynamics of planetary shape with tectonic activity under a common
mechanism,convectioncells have to be jettisoned.

"And though some disparate astronomical hypotheses may provide exactly
the same results in astronomy, as Rothmann claimed in his letters to
Lord Tycho of his own mutation of the Copernican system,nevertheless
there is often a difference between the conclusions because of some
physical consideration [causa alicujus considerationis physicae]....
But practitioners are not always in the habit of taking account of
that diversity in physical matters [in physicisvarietas], . . " Kepler

Right now you reference the Equatorial bulge as a rotational dynamic
based on referencing it from the dead center of the Earth,again,the
reference -

http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Srotfram1.htm

The rotational dynamics of planetary shape is an active dynamic,the
shape of the Earth is conditioned by the composition of the interior
and the maximum Equatorial speed hence it provides working principles
for crustal motion,a more accurate idea of internal composition,a more
balanced view of crustal evolution and how the Mid-Atlantic ridge
correlates to axial dynamics and who knows what other information can
be created and brought to bear on the material.

How unfortunate that I have to operate like this and pretend that you
can advance to a more productive view ,at least in the manner of the
old geologists like Steno or Wegener.It is not a matter of drawing
conclusions but rather making meaningfull associations,the great
intutive faculty that is almost lost in investigations of natural and
celestial phenomena.I make no requirements to understand or grasp
rotational dynamics,as far as I am concerned  we are all astronomers
by living by the great cycles of the day and the seasons and
geologists by adoring the spectacular scenery, a better geologist is
only one who adds more detail and makes the scenery more spectacular
in terms of time and scale.

Most here forget this and appeal to 'scientific methodology' and in
the end make a mess of things.Had genuine people enough sense to allow
natural things dictate the associations and conclusions,at least up to
a point,I would be the one learning about rotational dynamics and so
on.

Arrrh, ..not arrff, ...the biggest one being why you call me 'guru'.
Ah'm no guru when it comes to Plate Tectonics.  I don't have the
faintest clue how anybody can possibl6y believe the guff it comes away
with.  It's unsupportable whichever way you look and I have not one
iota of a clue how *anybody* understands the first thing about it.
How, for example, do ridge dykes never cut transform fauts?   And why,
when they define the thickness of the oceanic crust at the ridges
(about 6 -12km thick), do they graduate to becoming oceanic
lithosphere (about two hundred kilometres thick) by the time it (the
crusty bit) gets over a bit...  (away from the ridges).

Oh, .. I know, ...  The thicker and denser it gets, the easier it is
for the (lighter) continental lithosphere to push it down.
('S'obvious.)

(Yeah, ..   ...come to think of it, ..I could be a guru, ..  ..I
suppose, ..  all I need to do is write a few papers citing people who
say this sort of stuff...  )

I can see I need to make it clear that when it comes to Plate
tectonics the guru referred to is not me....    Nor for that matter
when it comes to expansion.  I'm just asking the questions everybody
else should be asking, and can't imagine why they don't.   They must
have asked them when they were learning the stuff.  What made them go
quiet?

&gt; Hello Don,

&gt; Took an interesting side trip with Oriel36 on rotational dynamics in this

&gt; Q. If the earth did NOT rotate (use the solar system as a frame of

Certainly.  "....Moreover there is in plate Tectonics nothing
whatsoever intrinsic to the Earth's roundness that may be contributing
to this effervescent state of affairs; 'convection' requires only a
temperature difference to drive it.  It could be happening just as
well in an Earth the shape of a flat-bottomed pan, as in a sphere. In
other words the fact that the Earth is spherical means nothing to the
essential elements of Plate Tectonics.  That it is spinning means even
less."

I would certainly think so .  We would have great landlocked masses of
