The Useful Fools of Empire

HUMANITARIAN WARS AND ASSOCIATED DELUSIONS

by Paul de Rooij

Most inhabitants of Western countries are afflicted by nefarious delusions
about the nature of their societies and government policy; the public at
large is led to believe that their societies are superior, and their
governments' policies are noble and generous. The illusions have to do with
the dissonance between the fabricated image and the reality of state power,
especially when it entails wars waged against third world countries. Awful
wars are waged for crass motives, yet they are sold on the basis that they
are driven by benevolent intent. Promotion of democracy, freedoms, human
rights, women's rights, and even religious tolerance are some of the
purported motives for current interventions, subversion or wars. Since the
1990s, in the lead-up to the wars against former Yugoslavia, the primary
justification offered to wage war was that it was necessary to safeguard
human rights or to improve the humanitarian conditions of the target
population. If the blatant hypocrisy wasn't bad enough, the Left's delusions
regarding the stated humanitarian rationale for wars has had a distinctly
deleterious effect on the Left as a movement and the organized opposition to
the depredations of their states. Jean Bricmont's Humanitarian Imperialism
is an extensive analysis of the &quot;humanitarian war&quot; rationale, and how its
twisted arguments should be countered and its rationale for war rejected.
One of the defining aspects of the Left of yesteryear was an opposition to
imperialism and its consequent wars; Bricmont's important contribution aims
to resurrect the principled opposition to the new imperial wars waged
primarily by the United States and Britain.

Subversion of International Law

Perhaps the most important point addressed in this book is that the
&quot;humanitarian intervention&quot; rationale served as a cynical means to sideline
international law; it is usually presented as one requiring utmost speed to
avert further disaster and therefore there is no time for formalities such
as observing the UN Charter or international law in general. For at least
two decades, the US has been itching to emasculate the UN even further and
to undermine the basis of international law; the means to obtain this
objective has been to promote &quot;humanitarian wars&quot; or even &quot;humanitarian
bombing&quot; (it is difficult to concoct a nicer oxymoron) [1]. What is
disconcerting is that this Trojan horse wasn't repelled by the principal
human rights organizations, the so-called public intellectuals, or groups on
the Left. The acceptance of the justification for wars has undermined the
anti-war movement and it seems that few are aware of the stark implications
of a debilitated international legal framework, i.e., a world afflicted with
incessant wars and ruled by the law of the jungle. Those seeking to resist
imperial wars or obtain a modicum of justice ought to defend the principle
of international law, and certainly not allow it to be undermined by
disingenuous appeals for war.

Kissing your SUV goodbye

If the US and its allies wage wars on the basis of false justifications,
then the question arises what their real motives are. Another important
section of Bricmont's book analyzes the nature of state power and the real
reasons for wars or interventions. His analysis suggests that one of the
reasons wars are waged is to guarantee access to raw materials and markets
[2]. It is also fair to say that most western societies owe their economic
development very much to the access to cheap resources, and most
interventions seek to continue to guarantee such access. Even the
tiniest/poorest third world countries are whipped into compliance -- no
deviation is tolerated. If one rejects the notion of wars to guarantee cheap
resources then there are serious implications for our societies; our
economies will have to be weaned from such cheap supplies entailing costly
restructuring. To change our societies so that they are less destructive to
others requires rejecting delusions about our states, it demands rejecting
interventionist wars, and certainly confronting specious justifications for
such wars.

Clearing up arguments

Bricmont provides a lengthy analysis of the pro-war humanitarian arguments,
and, in order to do so, also addresses the ineffective anti-war arguments
used by some on the Left. Maybe it is fair to suggest that the Left in
western countries has sometimes engaged in less-than-clear thinking. In the
past Leftist groups opposed wars against third world countries as a matter
of principle, but beginning in the late 1990s some succumbed to the
humanitarian interventionist ideology; what is surprising is how effective
this ploy has been. Others reject wars, but do so using weak, confusing or
even contradictory arguments. In countering the pro-war arguments, Bricmont
provides analysis suggesting the strongest counter-arguments, and how the
twisted historical analogies used to sell wars are best dealt with (e.g.,
appeasement, or confronting Hitler early on). Bricmont's analysis of the
Second World War analogies -- a favorite with the human rights crusaders --
should certainly be studied by anyone opposing wars.

What is missing

While the book deals with pro-war humanitarian arguments, it doesn't mention
that some humanitarian disasters haven't elicited the same reaction. For
human rights crusaders some cases deserve the intervention imperative, yet
others are neglected. While they demand intervention in Darfur they are
mysteriously silent about Congo; Palestine is perhaps the most neglected
issue. Since part of the book deals with exposing the hypocrisy in the way
wars are sold, maybe the book could have highlighted the cases where the
vocal advocates for war apply a double standard.

The book is perhaps best read in conjunction with Diana Johnstone's Fools'
Crusade (Johnstone is also the translator of Bricmont's book). While
Humanitarian Imperialism deals with the humanitarian war topic in general,
Fools' Crusade deals with a case history of this issue, i.e., the war
against Yugoslavia, a particularly important chapter for the humanitarian
war rationale and the origins of this ideology. Her book provides a
historical background of the way the wars against Yugoslavia were
deliberately and cynically planned. Kirsten Sellars' The Rise and Rise of
Human Rights is another important book providing additional context. Sellars
presents a history of how human rights have been exploited by the United
States and Britain, and it also provides an unflattering history of the
principal human rights organizations. Human Rights Watch in particular has
been a key organization pushing for humanitarian wars, and a proper
appreciation of such organizations is necessary to counter their influence.
Finally, while Bricmont refers to a few of the principal proponents of
humanitarian wars, the so-called public intellectuals or Liberals, more of
these human rights crusaders need to be taken to task about their positions
[3]. Edward S. Herman and David Peterson have compiled a list of these
operators and it is also worth reading in conjunction with Bricmont's book
[4]. One of the listed crusaders is Bernard Kouchner, the recently appointed
French Foreign Minister, and his interventionist proclivities may well
explain the changing French policy aligning itself closer to US policy.

Applying the lessons to Darfur

Bricmont's book doesn't deal with Darfur in any great detail, but one should
apply its lessons to this case in rejecting calls for intervention. There
are several reasons for this, and the primary one is that it has been a
stated objective of the neocons to &quot;take out&quot; Sudan [5], and if this rotten
gang bays for intervention, it behooves one to reconsider joining the
chorus. The US has stepped up its presence in the region by organizing an
invasion of Somalia, establishing a military presence in Chad, arming some
Sudanese rebel groups, etc. The US seeks to undermine Sudan for reasons
unrelated to the humanitarian situation, e.g., denying oil resources to its
competitors. The US has also used the Darfur issue to deflect attention from
its own depredations in Iraq or Afghanistan. Furthermore, several US-based
zionist groups have taken up the Darfur issue for equally cynical ends.
Pushing the Darfur issue is viewed among some of these groups as a means of
deflecting attention from Israel, suggesting that the situation in Darfur is
worse and therefore &quot;why single out Israel&quot;. Divestment from companies doing
business in Sudan serves the similar purpose of undermining efforts in the
US to launch a divestment from Israel or boycott campaign. The situation in
Darfur was also exploited after the Israeli war of aggression against
Lebanon in 2006; as soon as the war ended, the media focus shifted
immediately and preponderantly to cover the Darfur situation in order to
deflect attention from a criminal war by US/Israel. There is also the
question of focus as a humanitarian catastrophe of a much higher magnitude
in Congo has barely elicited a peep. Finally, it is also clear that much of
the conflict has to do with population dislocations due to environmental
change, and it is likely that armed interventions aren't the best solution.

If we reject intervention as Bricmont urges us to do, there is an issue
about what must be done. According to Jonathan Steele, negotiations among
local groups will likely result in accommodation and conflict resolution
[6]. Armed intervention on the other hand could only make matters worse.

Just like the chickenhawks, but more likely useful fools

The neocon chickenhawks are best known for urging the US military to go to
war while they remained safely ensconced in their think tanks. The leftists
or Liberals who have jumped on the humanitarian war bandwagon engage in very
much the same hypocrisy. When anyone today prescribes &quot;intervention&quot;, they
are really only urging the military of their state to attack other
countries, while they themselves are sitting pretty. Someone else will die
for the positions they propound, and it is certainly a very different
attitude compared to those who joined the International Brigades in Spain --
no chickens then. What makes matters worse is that the military was really
not established to further humanitarian aims, but is meant to impose the
interests of state power. Recently, the British military was concerned that
&quot;increasing emotional attachment to the outside world&quot; had led the British
public to expect humanitarian interventions [7]. The UK military sought to
shape public attitudes so that military activities wouldn't be constrained
or, let alone, face demands to have the military be used in legitimate
peacekeeping! When the military are actually used for &quot;humanitarian
intervention&quot; this means that the rationale has been exploited by state
power to sell its wars and they have even managed to get some Lefty or
Liberal dupes on board. Alternatively, if a state doesn't care to intervene
in a given country, it will simply ignore the humanitarian appeals. When the
British government's hypocrisy is exposed, e.g., with the &quot;genocide&quot; in
Darfur, it simply states that it will &quot;consider joining multilateral action&quot;
and, of course, it has been wringing its hands about what to do [8]. The
first indication that a state doesn't want to use its military for
humanitarian ends is when there are references to &quot;multilateral action&quot;;
translation: do nothing or simply provide token forces subject to stringent
&quot;rules of engagement&quot;. Anyone opposed to the imperialist trends of the US
and its faithful poodles should reject calls for direct military
intervention in the third world; there already have been too many
interventions.

policies for which liberals provide the ethical fig leaf. There is no other

crusaders might consider whether they are being jerked around.

Conclusion

The adoption of the humanitarian war rationale has had a particularly
damaging effect on what remains of the Left in Western countries; one of the
basic tenets for Leftists should have been to oppose imperial wars, and it
has been disconcerting to witness the adoption of the human rights lingo to
either co-cheerlead wars, accept portions of the rationale for war or simply
to demonstrate unreflective muddled thinking. Jean Bricmont's book,
Humanitarian Imperialism, is a clearly written guide through this moral
maze, an unmasking of tendentious interpretation of history, and an antidote
to the principal malaise afflicting our times: hypocrisy. It is an important
contribution to help the Left to assess critically history, and to break
through an intellectual logjam surrounding the so-called humanitarian wars.
