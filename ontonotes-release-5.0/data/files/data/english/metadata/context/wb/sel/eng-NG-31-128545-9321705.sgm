BACK TO SQUARE ONE: CARBON TRADING ISN'T WORKING
------------------------------------------------

The battle to beat climate change has come down to one weapon -- the price of
carbon. And analysts say it is not working.
--Jeremy Lovell, Reuters, 24 September 2007

The policy instrument of choice pretty well everywhere is a price for carbon,
and it is not going to work.
--Tom Burke, E3G, 24 September 2007

The price of carbon has had virtually no effect on the market so far and
virtually no effect on climate change. The truth is that Europe has performed
less well on carbon dioxide since the late 1990s than the United States -- and
Europe is inside Kyoto and has an emissions trading scheme.
--Dieter Helm, Oxford University, 24 September 2007

The oil price shocks of the 1970s didn't wean us off oil, so why should we
believe that a high carbon price will wean us off carbon.
--Jim Watson, Sussex University, 24 September 2007

Developed countries should continue to take the lead in reducing greenhouse
gas emissions after 2012 when the first commitment period of the Kyoto
Protocol expires, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said Monday. It is
necessary to increase financial assistance and technology transfer to
developing countries. But in doing so, one should not put undue emphasis on
the role of the market mechanism, he added.
--Xinhua, 25 September 2007

Pakistani Environment Minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat spoke on behalf of the
Group of 77, a bloc that despite its name represents about 130 developing
countries, including the emerging giant China. He ruled out demands from some
quarters that developing countries accept targeted curbs on their emissions.
--AFP, 24 September 2007

Mr Benn's decision to single out the US during a visit to New York will be
regarded in Washington as particularly provocative... But he stopped short of
calling for binding emissions targets for China's growing economy. &quot;China in
the end will have to decide what they are going to contribute,&quot; he said.
--The Times, 25 September 2007

British officials do not believe the Bush administration will do a U-turn in
Bali, but point out that when a new climate change agreement is laid down in
detail and signed, in Copenhagen in 2009, Mr Bush will no longer be in office.
--Julian Borger, The Guardian, 25 September 2007

[Czech President Vaclav] Klaus said it would most help the debate on climate
change if the current monopoly and one-sidedness were eliminated. He re-
iterated his proposal that the UN organise parallel inter-governmental panels
to discuss climate changes and publish two competing reports, saying it is a
political question.
--Prague Daily Monitor, 25 September 2007

Know that the fact that few support your contrarian view says less than it
might seem about how reasonable is your view.  Most people prefer credit to
influence, and credit-seekers are better off rejecting a non-standard view now
and stealing it later, should it succeed.

By Jeremy Lovell

LONDON (Reuters) - The battle to beat climate change has come down to one
weapon -- the price of carbon. And analysts say it is not working.

Much lip service has been paid to cutting climate warming carbon emissions
through measures such as improved energy efficiency, technological innovation,
reduced demand, higher standards and carbon output restrictions.

But in most cases the vital incentive is supposed to be provided by achieving
a high price for carbon, from which all else would follow. Neither has
happened and time is running out.

&quot;The policy instrument of choice pretty well everywhere is a price for carbon,
and it is not going to work,&quot; said Tom Burke of environment lobby group E3G.

&quot;To stop climate change moving from a bad problem getting worse to a worse
problem becoming catastrophic, you have to make the global energy system
carbon neutral by 2050 -- and that will not happen just using carbon pricing.&quot;

Burke said what was urgently needed were strict technical standards and
investment incentives to achieve the transition.

&quot;You have got to drive the carbon out of the energy system and then keep it
out forever,&quot; he said. &quot;In the first part of that you are making serious step
changes. They are not going to be accomplished by marginal changes in price.&quot;

The European Union's carbon emissions trading scheme got off to a shaky start
due to over-allocation of permits, but has now established a price of about 20
euros a tonne of carbon dioxide.

There is also the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol on cutting
global carbon emissions, under which developing nations effectively get paid
for emissions foregone.

VERY POOR WEAPON

Together, these two have generated a global carbon trade worth billions of
dollars and handed vast profits to some key players, but had little measurable
effect on carbon emissions.

&quot;Governments are relying way too much on the price of carbon to deliver
everything,&quot; said Jim Watson of Sussex University's Energy Group.

&quot;It is a prerequisite but not a panacea. It has to go hand in hand with
regulations and technological developments, and they are sadly lacking,&quot; he
said.

&quot;If you rely too much on the carbon price you give people the option of buying
their way out of it. It is a very poor weapon in what is supposed to be a war
to save humanity.

&quot;The oil price shocks of the 1970s didn't wean us off oil, so why should we
believe that a high carbon price will wean us off carbon,&quot; he added.

The United States appears finally to have bought into the climate change
argument having spent years rejecting the idea of man-made global warming, and
is hosting a meeting of major emitting nations later this week.

The United Nations is also holding a climate summit on Monday, ahead of a
crucial meeting in December on the Indonesian island of Bali of UN environment
ministers that is supposed to kick start talks on a new global climate treaty.

But there is no consensus on what needs to be done or how to achieve it.

While some countries want targets and timetables for emissions cuts, to others
like the United States the idea is abhorrent.

POLITICAL WILL

The trouble is that Kyoto -- rejected by the U.S. and non-binding on booming
emitters China and India -- runs out in 2012 and there is as yet nothing to
replace it.

The EU has said its emissions trading scheme will carry on beyond 2012 in any
case, but that is cold comfort for environmentalists who see the need for
urgent and effective action beyond trying to trade their way out of trouble.

&quot;The price of carbon has had virtually no effect on the market so far and
virtually no effect on climate change,&quot; said Oxford University economics
professor Dieter Helm.

&quot;People like me who think the price of carbon is important don't think it is
the only thing that matters. There must be more focus on energy efficiency,
more research and development and more renewable energy.

&quot;The truth is that Europe has performed less well on carbon dioxide since the
late 1990s than the United States -- and Europe is inside Kyoto and has an
emissions trading scheme,&quot; he said.

To E3G's Burke the problem is less one of technical availability and ability
than of political courage.

&quot;It is well within our technical competence. What you need is the political
will,&quot; he said. &quot;The trouble is that there are a lot of people out there
making a lot of money out of carbon trading and who want to perfect the market
rather than press for the changes that are actually needed.&quot;

UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- Developed countries should continue to
take the lead in reducing greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 when the first
commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol expires, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang
Jiechi said Monday.

Speaking at a UN climate change meeting in New York, Yang said that the
principle of &quot;common but differentiated responsibilities&quot; should be adhered to
in global efforts to address the challenges of climate change.

Developed countries should meet their emission reduction targets set in the
Kyoto Protocol, help developing countries build the capacity to tackle climate
change and continue to take the lead in reducing emissions after 2012, he

Dalam konteks kondisi dunia saat ini:
semua diskusi ttg climate change hanya trade-off antara:
- ketakutan rakyat negara maju akan menurunnya kualitas hidup mereka krn
ancaman bencana alam (mereka sudah
nyaman hidupnya selama ini kan)? Nggak kebayang kalau harus hidup di
tenda-2 karena angin ribut, banjir dll yg
banyak terjadi sekarang ini akibat climate change.
- peluang bagi rakyat negara-2 miskin untuk dapat subsidi berupa apapun
dari negara-2 kaya, dengan iming-2
kerjasama yg manis utk mengurangi penyebab-2 climate change..

Yg jelas bagi para politisi,  dua point diatas nggak ada pentingnya
samasekali selain dalam rangka melanggengkan kekuasaan, popularitas dan
pengaruh mereka. Wong diantara mereka banyak yang tega menjagal ribuan
orang dan merampok harta-hartanya sekalian, jadi nonsense lah kalau dgn
sekedar 'climate change'.

Tapi ini sebenarnya turning point untuk lahirnya tata dunia baru, yang
benar-benar asli penuh dengan kebaikan.
Mari kita tunggu, or better still, mari kita sama-sama perjuangkan   ;-)
