Natalie, I've been wondering about you.  I was wondering if you
could answer this question for us, if you wouldn't mind :-)

I was just wondering if you look more like:

A. Halle Berry

B. Vanessa Williams

C. Aunt Cha-My-Ma, as in the great African-American /*FAT*/ businesswoman
famous for Aunt Cha-My-ma syrup and pancakes.

It just shows that big, fat woman can succeed in our world, spectacularly :-)

========

Your chivalry is sweet, Tegger.  But just keep in mind
you're acting chivalrous for a woman who looks more like
Aunt Cha-My-ma than Vanessa Williams or
Halle Berry :-) [chuckle]

And I remind you of her subtle put-down of Jews last night by
saying, &quot;These guys are very Christian and honest.&quot;

Oh for f*ck's sake - some idjit thinks I'm anti-Semitic?!  Must be one of

Anyone who accuses me of being intolerant knows absolutely nothing about

&gt; Then they wonder why I killfile so many Kook-Aid drinkers who have drunk
&gt; from the poisoned well of Moveon.org, HillBillary, et al.    They keep
&gt; pulling the old Joey Gobbels trick:  If you keep telling a lie long
&gt; enough, people start believing it.  At least the Kook-Aid drinkers do.

&gt; Can I take off my radiation suit and come out of the fallout shelter now?
&gt; I thought for sure you'd scorch Gary Burn-more.

Giving a troll what he wants most is the last thing I'd do.

It's not even worth the trouble.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I never insulted slaves.  I said soldiers are slaves.  That's

I've seen the name attached to posts, but never paid a whole lot of
attention.  However, he's just shed some light on himself (not a favorable
one, obviously).

Gary, I have to ask (in an extended manner)...

You are running a business that sells Usenet access.

You charge actual money for this service.

You have a tendency to post provocative, linguistically controversial
messages targeting specific individuals.

Considering that there are many competitors in your industry, some of whom
are publicly quite silent and inoffensive about their own personal
prejudices, of what advantage to you are the prejudicial tendencies of your
own Usenet posts?

His misogyny knows no bounds, but I have to say, I'm still amazed he's still
compelled to attack me, after all these years.

You'd think he'd find another chew toy to slobber on, but he just cannot get
over me.

Sad. Very sad.

&gt; I have no idea who he is; this thread is the first time I've ever heard
&gt; his name.

&gt; But he clearly has manhood issues.  Not much confidence there, obviously.

He used to converse in a civil manner - even with me, but his true hatred of
women became quite obvious, and I gave up even *trying* to reason with him.

However, he grabs any opportunity to attack me, despite the fact that I
haven't spoken to him in years.

Welcome to Usenet.

&gt; Too true.  The slime needs a promotion to reach that level.

&gt; Look up &quot;filth&quot; in the dictionary.  His pic will be right there.
