John Baez, in  his website presents a mathematical 'proof ' that antimatter
can only fall down, or conversely, that antimatter can only have a positive
gravity force associated with it:

http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/antimatterFa...

In short:
The simple argument given in the above link to Baez's web site is
concerning the proof that antimatter doesn't fall up in a gravity field by
dealing with the photon energy levels given by the simple energy equation:

1/2 (g matter + g antimatter) = g photon    for a conserved force,
where g=9.8 m/s^2

When the corrected energy equation is given:   1/2( /g matter + g
antimatter/ ) =  /g photon/

Where, using absolute magnitude signs yields the correct quantity,
which is a vector product which takes into account the direction of the
force
as well as its magnitude. Simplifying now will yield the numerical quantity
of: +-9.8 M/s^2.

Meaning:
In the simplest case, uncomplicated by factors which are presently
unknown, antimatter will fall 'up' with a negative acceleration of -9.8
m/s^2 in the
Earth's gravity field.

No true physicist will discount the possibility that antimatter will
fall up, based purely on the mathematical manipulations, no matter how
'simple' or 'pure' those reasons may seem. It's a false sense of security
that
they peddle on some internet web sites. Of course, ultimately the proof
will rest on the physical observation of which way antihydrogen will fall
when
it is released in an experiment  that screens out EM effects.

Back to the present-day: It is important to note just how well
entrenched these wrong-headed ideas are and for how long I have been trying
to open up the eyes of scientists the world over. I have met with only
partial success. This leaves me with a basically negative opinion to the
survivability and viability of science in general in the 21st century. We
are already seeing the cracks developing, something I predicted 20+ years
ago: as present day theory fails to account for observational phenomena,
theorists will quickly come up with even more outlandishly wrong ideas and
eventually the whole complicated edifice will reach critical-mess and come
crashing down on our heads, leading to another dark age in reason. I am
unsure we will emerge out the other side if this happens, as now the
insanity will be fueled by nuclear explosives and biological weapons...

Yes, rather convienient. Down through the years, there have been many
proposals to physically test how antimatter falls in a gravity fields, yet
they all seem to get cancelled, funding falls through, or fall through
various cracks never to be heard from again. Convienient
indeed...considering what shock waves positive results would send through so
many theoretical communities, from cosmological, to physical and beyond.

&quot;Critical mess?&quot;...

Good one, Greysky. &lt;g&gt;

Let's hope it doesn't describe the LHC at Cern starting
next year, 2008!

http://tinyurl.com/5jczs

&quot;The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can achieve energies
that no other particle accelerators have reached before.
The energy of its particle collisions has previously only
been found in Nature.  And it is only by using such a
powerful machine that phyicists can probe deeper into
the key mysteries of the Universe.

&quot;Some people have expressed concerns about the safety
of whatever may be created in high-energy particle
collisions.  However there are no reasons for concern.&quot;

Sounds like the makin's of a _critical mess_ to me.

happy days and...
starry starry nights!

There is a subtle issue raised here though.  Photons, which can be the
products of matter-antimatter annihilation, are observed to curve
towards a gravitation body when they pass close to it.  So unless
someone can find an antiphoton that curves away from a gravitating
body, then since matter falls down, and neutral photons fall down, it
seems most likely that antimatter will also fall down.

The terms &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;anti-matter&quot; are chosen due to an historical
sequence of events. For example; the proton was discovered before the
anti-proton. If the anti-proton had be discovered first then it may just as
well have been called a &quot;proton&quot; whereas what we now call a proton would
have then been called an &quot;anti-proton.&quot;  The idea that antimatter falls up
is therefore not grounded in anything. I see no reason why someone would
even think that way. The choice of what is called the &quot;anti&quot; of a particle
is merely an historical artifact.

But, since matter or anti-matter can only fall in any direction
in an E-M field, the gravity part is only relevent to protons,
though.
Which is probably why we discovered lithium-lines and
Buckey-balls in the holistic wave-front spectrum for the
astrologers.

You assume too much. I just said it was convienient. I really find it
remarkable that such an experiment, since it is obviously possible to do,
and has such a large payoff if it turns up positive results, is always
getting scutteled for one reason or another. Tell you what - since you fancy
yourself a creative scientist, why don't you do the experiment yourself? Be

&gt;  The simple argument given in the above link to Baez's web site is

&gt; dealing with the photon energy levels given by the simple energy equation:

&gt;       1/2 (g matter + g antimatter) = g photon    for a conserved force,
&gt; where g=9.8 m/s^2

&gt;       When the corrected energy equation is given:   1/2( /g matter + g
&gt; antimatter/ ) =  /g photon/

&gt;       Where, using absolute magnitude signs yields the correct quantity,
&gt; which is a vector product which takes into account the direction of the
&gt; force
&gt; as well as its magnitude. Simplifying now will yield the numerical quantity
&gt; of: +-9.8 M/s^2.

&gt;       Meaning:
&gt;       In the simplest case, uncomplicated by factors which are presently
&gt; unknown, antimatter will fall 'up' with a negative acceleration of -9.8
&gt; m/s^2 in the
&gt; Earth's gravity field.

&gt;       No true physicist will discount the possibility that antimatter will

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;      No true physicist will discount the possibility that antimatter
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fall up, based purely on the mathematical manipulations, no matter how
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'simple' or 'pure' those reasons may seem. It's a false sense of
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;security
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;that
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they peddle on some internet web sites. Of course, ultimately the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;proof
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;will rest on the physical observation of which way antihydrogen will
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fall
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;when
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;it is released in an experiment  that screens out EM effects.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Which was one of the few actual science experiments that the ISS was
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to do. Too bad it was cancelled even though the flight hardware had
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; already been built and qualified.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes, rather convienient. Down through the years, there have been many
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;proposals to physically test how antimatter falls in a gravity fields,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;yet
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;they all seem to get cancelled, funding falls through, or fall through
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;various cracks never to be heard from again. Convienient
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;indeed...considering what shock waves positive results would send
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;through
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;so
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;many theoretical communities, from cosmological, to physical and beyond.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Were antimatter observed to gravitate oppositely to that of regular
&gt;&gt;&gt; matter, the discoverers would be on the fast track for a Nobel.

&gt;&gt;On that, I can agree.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Folks like you always like to presume conspiracy or something
&gt;&gt;&gt; preventing &quot;the orthodoxy&quot; from being challenged while conviniently
&gt;&gt;&gt; forgetting folks like Wu who discovered the parity violating aspect of
&gt;&gt;&gt; mesons back in the 60's.

&gt;&gt;You assume too much. I just said it was convienient. I really find it
&gt;&gt;remarkable that such an experiment, since it is obviously possible to do,
&gt;&gt;and has such a large payoff if it turns up positive results, is always
&gt;&gt;getting scutteled for one reason or another. Tell you what - since you
&gt;&gt;fancy
&gt;&gt;yourself a creative scientist, why don't you do the experiment yourself?
&gt;&gt;Be
&gt;&gt;sure to tell us if men in black fedoras show up at your doorstep after you
&gt;&gt;apply for funding, ok?

I'd like to hear how that can happen, too. Electromagnetic propagation has
nothing to do with the process. As I have stated elsewhere, any radiation
you can measure outside the device is only leakage. A P2 probability wave is
an imaginary function and can't be shielded- once it is created and
modulated it is instantly available to be decoded anywhere there is a
receiver. It just 'is'. Neither distance nor any of the electromagnetic
phenomena that are conventional interferers of  communications devices
affect this domain.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;only be a worker drone, nothing more.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No, it just means I abandon things like FTL until I have a reason to
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; believe it can exist. That comes with the territory of wishing to be a
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; scientist - what I want to exist is superceded by what actually
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exists.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, the best thing I can say is that you're too trusting.  You make your
&gt;&gt;&gt;own reality, within limits.  I knew FTL communications was 'impossible'
&gt;&gt;&gt;from
&gt;&gt;&gt;early childhood - my family was in professional broadcasting from before
&gt;&gt;&gt;my
&gt;&gt;&gt;birth, and teething on hardnosed broadcast engineers from infancy onwards
&gt;&gt;&gt;provided a better educaton than any college I could have attended. When I
&gt;&gt;&gt;finally did enter university, I already knew what I was going to  do - the
&gt;&gt;&gt;education simply provided me the knowledge I needed to finish off that
&gt;&gt;&gt;lifelong training. Our viewpoints are so opposed, I couldn't even imagine
&gt;&gt;&gt;being so tightly constrained by what you call 'reality'.

&gt;&gt; Clever. Take the rules that your family learned which allow
&gt;&gt; understanding of the technology they use to earn a living, then ignore
&gt;&gt; them.

&gt;I am assuming you meant ignoring the rules, eh? But, no, I am not ignoring
&gt;those rules. They are still very valid. I am just now cowed into believeing
&gt;they are the final word on anyting, nor is there anything left oustide the
&gt;box to discover.

&gt;&gt; Is that what it takes to be a scientist?

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm constrained by physical reality but apparently that is something
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you don't worry about. Witness your perpetual &quot;how to build a FTL
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; radio&quot; signature, despite having no working device.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sorry to hear you still can't understand my web site. Speaking of which,
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;am very near making a breakthrough in my 7th gen prototype, namely
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;simplifying the oscillator technology - if I can swap out the bulky
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;oscillators then I can mass market the things. Imagine something smaller
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;than a cell phone, which allows you to communicate to anyone else on the
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;planet that has a similar device, for free. Sorta like a super ham radio
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without the radio part.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; A 7th generation prototype yet not even one independant verification
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that it works?

&gt;&gt;&gt;Well, that depends on what you mean by verification. Since I fund my own
&gt;&gt;&gt;work, I don't need to proove myself to anyone. Still, the range of
&gt;&gt;&gt;reactions
&gt;&gt;&gt;I have encountered over the years is quite interesting - hostility by
&gt;&gt;&gt;theoreticians who know with certainty that what I claim will overthow
&gt;&gt;&gt;their
&gt;&gt;&gt;world (it doesn't). All the way to entrepreneurs who couldn't give a rats'
&gt;&gt;&gt;ass how it works as long as there is profit to be made. And, now that it
&gt;&gt;&gt;appears that I may be able to use a noise source to generate synthetically
&gt;&gt;&gt;the functions of some very high priced oscillators, I am strongly leaning
&gt;&gt;&gt;towards the entrepreneurial direction.

&gt;&gt; Yet...nobody but you agrees that it is actually a 'FTL radio'.

&gt;&gt; I'd love to hear how you think you can make light go faster than
&gt;&gt; itself.

&gt;I'd like to hear how that can happen, too. Electromagnetic propagation has
&gt;nothing to do with the process. As I have stated elsewhere, any radiation
&gt;you can measure outside the device is only leakage. A P2 probability wave is
&gt;an imaginary function and can't be shielded- once it is created and

the second word in the above line is a clear conclusion. the word is

You can't measure imaginary numbers. Only real effects can be
measured.

You'd be surprised how many engineers started out as physicists. Reality
eventually intrudes, especially if they want to pay the bills. I've never
had any problems with these guys - its the other ones, the physicists who
began as engineers who can get...testy. These are usually mid level project
managers with the &quot;Dr.&quot; in front of their name. but have the souls of
accountants. They do have a vested interest in the status quo, and are the
first to light the fires if they can't just outright fire you.

You begin to touch upon the diffficulty level of my achievement. You have
*no idea* how snarky is the process needed to receive what is an imaginary
function and make it real enough to work with. It's why I have high
confidence there is no other device like mine on earth. It's why, while I
can talk endlessly about making P2 waves and encoding them with meaningful
information, I wont say much about receiving them.  Yet.
