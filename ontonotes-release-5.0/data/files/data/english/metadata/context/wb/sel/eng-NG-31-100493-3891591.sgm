Hey all !

I replaced my condensor about a month ago and recharged the system w/a
freon and oil combo set with the single gauge setup.
All was fine and cold enough, then 2 days ago, I fired up the truck
and the unit was not blowing cold air, just cool, so I grabbed the
single gauge and tested the low side and it read the same as after I
initially refilled system.
The clutch kicks in intermittently for about 4 seconds and shuts off
for about 4 seconds, quite consistently.
Seems like the low on freon symptom. I tried to put a little more
freon in, but noticed that it didn't seem to help the on then off
syndrome. I did not overfill at this point, the gauge still being in
the blue.
Is there a solenoid or switch to check or replace for this condition?

It is hot as hell out here.
I don't want to get ripped off by some shop, as I was hoping to
remedy this and sell this great little truck with 200k miles for a new
Yellow Hemi SLT while the incentives are on.

any suggestions?

Thanks

Julio

Well with out a proper set of gauges not the one gage check method, filling
as per manufacturer instructions, checking pressure chart based on ambient
temperature, checking the super heat temp, a proper leak test, properly
evacuated the system because all the refrigerant was gone or had air
entrainment, more than likely not having been trained in automotive  HVAC or
licensed as per the EPA you have screwed the pooch and you are lucky you
have not blown your compressor or yourself  Any one of the above is your
problem. The compressor cycling it is low on refrigerant, leak in system a
vacuum held on the system would of found it.  If you did not pump down the
system it is full of air you cannot evaporate air.

what about a high pressure cut out switch? blockage in the filter or
expansion valve causing high head pressure (and system possibly overfilled)
causing low side to read ok? hard to tell without a proper set of gauges.
just a thought.

I am continually amazed at how many people think they can properly service
an A/C system without the right tools or knowledge.  Yeah, pumping a little
more 134 in from a can to top off a system with a minor leak is one thing,
but when you open the system (like replacing a condenser), to try and do it
without a vacuum pump, a full set of gauges, and/or the knowledge that these
are REQUIREMENTS, and not just nice-to-haves....  well, the results are
usually fairly predictable.

To the OP: do yourself a huge favor - take the truck to an A/C shop, have
them evacuate and re-charge the system properly.  It's never going to work
otherwise.  Have them put in some tracer dye while they're at it, so you can
make sure your connections to the new condenser aren't leaking (you did
change the O-rings, and lightly lubed them with the proper oil first,
right?)

The system has a captube not an expansion valve to control the refrigerant
and does not use a HP switch.  High head pressure is caused by too much heat
from and not enough cooling from the condensing coil thats the one by the
radiator.

Bingo! no difference in an auto AC or residential AC theory is the same the
only difference it is more compact.  When you draw a 500 micron vacuum and
hold it you do not need dyes to check for leaks.  I use a UE2000 ultrasonic
leak detector it will find any and all leaks and I mean all.  Dyes in
systems are old school I use to use them but technology has taken over.   It
took me less than 30 seconds to find a leak in a 50 foot x 50 foot
refrigeration coil.  Those cheep leak detectors are garbage the one I have
costs over $1800.00 you get what you pay for.

&gt;I don't know much about auto AC but with residential AC you need to
&gt; pump the system down after a change out like you've described.  You
&gt; need to remove the air in the system as well as the moisture.

&gt; A starting point would be to evacuate the system.  Make sure there
&gt; aren't any leaks and weigh a charge in with dye to detect possible
&gt; current or future leaks.

I agree that it is kinda fool hardy to use a single low side gauge to
determine the charge status of a systems. Also, the main reason you
evacuate the system is to remove moisture (which air can hold too)
because its presence (moisture) can realy "muck up the works" in a
A/C system

With the proper knowledge, tools and $$ for the tools you can do anything.
You are looking at about $1800.00 for a recovery system, guages, and scale
to weigh what comes out and what goes in.  Some local colleges provide a
cource on auto AC maintenance and repair.

that's about 150 psi too high...............

so far this month I've seen 3 Dodge Caravans with a split seam in the
condenser

the problem is that the radiator fans no longer come on automatically with
AC, but wait till ECT sensor detects high coolant temp............

and the condenser is no longer as hefty as it once was

&gt; I replaced my condensor about a month ago and recharged the system w/a
&gt; freon and oil combo set with the single gauge setup.
&gt; All was fine and cold enough, then 2 days ago, I fired up the truck
&gt; and the unit was not blowing cold air, just cool, so I grabbed the
&gt; single gauge and tested the low side and it read the same as after I
&gt; initially refilled system.
&gt; The clutch kicks in intermittently for about 4 seconds and shuts off
&gt; for about 4 seconds, quite consistently.
&gt; Seems like the low on freon symptom. I tried to put a little more
&gt; freon in, but noticed that it didn't seem to help the on then off
&gt; syndrome. I did not overfill at this point, the gauge still being in
&gt; the blue.
&gt; Is there a solenoid or switch to check or replace for this condition?

&gt; It is hot as hell out here.
&gt; I don't want to get ripped off by some shop, as I was hoping to
&gt; remedy this and sell this great little truck with 200k miles for a new
&gt; Yellow Hemi SLT while the incentives are on.

&gt; any suggestions?

&gt; Thanks

Well, after some thought, really very little - I bought the Yellow SLT
Hemi Ram. (it's even got a little stinger on the side)

Then I bought some protection for the bed, then some seat covers, and
took the wife to Western  North Carolina, for a look at some terrific
Mountain Homesites.
Lots of beautiful acreage for reasonable prices.

The drive was great, avg. about 15.5 to 16 mpg. at about 80 - 85
mph..with Ford's in the way.
I think the 20 inch tires helped a little there. Came home abour 5
days later to hotter than hell SE Fla.
I then took the Dakota to an A/C shop and general repair place a
couple of miles away, The mechanic was playin' with his 4 wheeler
cycle, and I asked him for some help.
Well the system was low with no leaks that he could find for about 20
min. worth of labor.
He filled the system, it ran cold, so far so good. He said to monitor
it, he'll do a dye test if it gets low again.
For 20 bucks, I couldn't go wrong.
Dakota's for sale for 5k. - it runs like a top, it was just  a little
too small inside.
The dealer wouldn't give crap for a trade-in, so I kept it.
Thanks for the help "all"

Moral of the story is to try and trust some mechanics to give you a
fair shake, __AND__ you'll really piss offf a lot of Ford F150 drivers
with a hemi.........hahahaha.......
