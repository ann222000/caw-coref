Here's some new pics of the babies at 9 weeks old. Still no luck
finding them homes. Look at this
pic and tell me, how can anyone NOT want them?

I'd be standing outside your door with a carrier if I could!!! How can
people resist such cuteness! That should have had a KFW on it! I mean
silver tabbies! I always wanted a silver tabby (Don't tell the
Furballs) and they're so handsome

Where are you?  Round here, silver tabby kittens go for more than
200 pounds each.  I would expect them to go for even more in London.
Advertise *any* kittens around here and your phone will ring for
days - with Marblecake's first litter we got about 30 emails and
phone calls within a few hours of putting an ad on a not-very-busy
website (the local Edinburgh branch of Gumtree).  Our vet regularly
asks if we have any (some chance, we will check any new owners out
ourselves).

Silver tabbies are wonderful.  I'd take another like Muriel any time.

Sigh. I wish it were that way here. The only kitten harder to adopt
out than a silver tabby
is a solid black kitten. Both are so common. To give you an idea,
there are thirty kittens at the
shelter right now that have been there for over a month now. Most of
them silver tabbies. If a kitten
isn't &quot;different&quot;...like longhaired, or six-toed, or odd-eyed, they
are just not getting adopted right now.
Masked cats get adopted real well.
I have put photos up at the post office, advertised in the newspaper,
posted on Halliburtons bulletin board
and the vet's office. The only people who have responded have been no-
gos. The *only* responses have
been for barn cats. Nothing against this noble profession, but hand-
raised kittens can't be barn cats.

Handraised kittens make the very best buddies, though. They don't know
fear of humans because they've never
known anything else but being handled by humans. You can do anything
with them. You can hang them upside
down and they purr. You can plop them on their backs and rub their
tummies and they go to sleep. They are very
healthy, and have never had a flea on them in their lives. They're
clean as can be, and always smell like whatever
aftershave or perfume DH or I are wearing.  Those are plusses, no?

Pam I know how you feel I probably could take 2 or 3 more  but it would
strain all of them here.  My mother is too old to be reliable to help out.
Right now I am trying to nip a problem in the butt.  Spirit already chases
limo and stalks her due to her actions when he was a kitten by beating him
till he cowered when we were not around.  Now he does it back to her  she is
7 lbs and he is 19 and about 4 years younger than her.
Well Ka'shay has taken to getting aggressive when she come by. Her ears
fold back into prey mode and she jumps limo chasing  her out of the room.  I
think Limo who really should be a one house cat just wants to be left alone
and lashes out at them  well they give it back to her full force.  Limo
hides with Momma in her room  and does not come out much.

You're just like any *reasonable* cat lover. You're not taking on more
than you can
properly take care of. That's me, too. I have five already. I'm not
wealthy enough
to be able to comfortably spend the $$$ if (God forbid!) they all got
sick at once. Although
I could manage, with five, somehow. It is all I can do already to keep
ahead of the cat hair and
make sure the house does not smell like I have cats. That's important
to me. And even
with five, sometimes the meeker ones (Bikkie) gets overlooked and
doesn't get much
attention. That *really* happens a lot right now with the kittens. I
do wish I could keep
them. They think I'm their Mama.

&gt;&gt;&gt; What cuties I would love to adopt them but we have too many masters
&gt;&gt;&gt; right now

&gt;&gt; Exactly what I was thinking.  I'd love to have more owners, but we're
&gt;&gt; spread out caring for the ones we are owned by in the style they've
&gt;&gt; become accustomed to.

&gt;&gt; Pam S. who'd like to live in the style the cats have become accustomed
&gt;&gt; to.

&gt;    Pam I know how you feel I probably could take 2 or 3 more  but it would
&gt; strain all of them here.  My mother is too old to be reliable to help out.
&gt; Right now I am trying to nip a problem in the butt.  Spirit already chases
&gt; limo and stalks her due to her actions when he was a kitten by beating him
&gt; till he cowered when we were not around.  Now he does it back to her  she
&gt; is 7 lbs and he is 19 and about 4 years younger than her.
&gt;    Well Ka'shay has taken to getting aggressive when she come by. Her ears
&gt; fold back into prey mode and she jumps limo chasing  her out of the room.
&gt; I think Limo who really should be a one house cat just wants to be left
&gt; alone and lashes out at them  well they give it back to her full force.
&gt; Limo hides with Momma in her room  and does not come out much.

See, that's where, for me, you get into the quality of life issue.  I always
wondered if Demi might not have been better, happier, much more confident
and pampered if she had been an only cat.  Human nature, such as it is, you
can't feel as close to a cat that is constantly hiding under a bed as you
can one who hangs out in your lap or at your feet wanting petting.  I admire
her beauty, and I feel honored those few minutes per week she'll let me
stroke her (but she cringes), but I'm not nearly as close to her as I am
with the others.

Also, I know they've had the argument (flame war) over in rpch+b about
whether people with limited means should even own cats (and I can see both
sides since I just spent about $1500 to $2000 on my cats in just the last
six weeks - but I would not want to be without a cat just because I was
poor).

I guess as with anything else in life, nothing can be perfect and you have
to accept compromises and live with what life gives you!

Hugs,

For me my Limo is perfectly fine.  She stays in mom room with no problem.
She is momma girls and never has ventured far from her.  For me it is also
dumplin who has to live in the Florida room due to his territorial
aggressive nature and bad bathroom habits due to his abuse before we rescued
him.

As I said You had to do what was right for your pack.  No one else opinion
mattered at all except yours.  That sounds bad wrote out  but you were the
only one that could make the decision and tell if it was the right thing to
do.  None of us where there to witness the problem first hand

Heck I got rid of the wife to save my pack and my health &lt;evil smile &gt;;-)

&gt;&gt;&gt; http://pets.webshots.com/album/559629986TAFCHO?vhost=pets

&gt;&gt; Where are you?  Round here, silver tabby kittens go for more than
&gt;&gt; 200 pounds each.  I would expect them to go for even more in London.
&gt;&gt; Advertise *any* kittens around here and your phone will ring for
&gt;&gt; days - with Marblecake's first litter we got about 30 emails and
&gt;&gt; phone calls within a few hours of putting an ad on a not-very-busy
&gt;&gt; website (the local Edinburgh branch of Gumtree).  Our vet regularly
&gt;&gt; asks if we have any (some chance, we will check any new owners out
&gt;&gt; ourselves).

&gt;&gt; Silver tabbies are wonderful.  I'd take another like Muriel any time.

&gt; Sigh. I wish it were that way here. The only kitten harder to adopt
&gt; out than a silver tabby
&gt; is a solid black kitten. Both are so common. To give you an idea,
&gt; there are thirty kittens at the
&gt; shelter right now that have been there for over a month now. Most of
&gt; them silver tabbies. If a kitten
&gt; isn't &quot;different&quot;...like longhaired, or six-toed, or odd-eyed, they
&gt; are just not getting adopted right now.
&gt; Masked cats get adopted real well.
&gt; I have put photos up at the post office, advertised in the newspaper,
&gt; posted on Halliburtons bulletin board
&gt; and the vet's office. The only people who have responded have been no-
&gt; gos. The *only* responses have
&gt; been for barn cats. Nothing against this noble profession, but hand-
&gt; raised kittens can't be barn cats.

&gt; Handraised kittens make the very best buddies, though. They don't know
&gt; fear of humans because they've never
&gt; known anything else but being handled by humans. You can do anything
&gt; with them. You can hang them upside
&gt; down and they purr. You can plop them on their backs and rub their
&gt; tummies and they go to sleep. They are very
&gt; healthy, and have never had a flea on them in their lives. They're
&gt; clean as can be, and always smell like whatever
&gt; aftershave or perfume DH or I are wearing.  Those are plusses, no?
&gt; Sherry

Yes, this is so true.  Vino was a hand raised kitten and you can do
absolutely anything to him.  I would take these 2 in a heartbeat.  Ship
'em over to Australia!!!

Vino's mama cat was around but for some reason would not feed her
litter.  So the lady bottle fed them.  We got him at 6.5 weeks old he
was just precious!  I'll have to see about some baby pics of him if
there are none in the album in the link in my sig.
I wish we could teleport your bitties over.  I love hand raised kittens.
But with Aus rules, they would have to be 6 months old anyway.

I guess I'm strange, because a solid black cat/kitten (especially a
short hair) would always be my first choice.  They're soooooo
beautiful!  Especially they way their gold or green eyes stand out in
such magnificent contrast to their all black shiny coat.

Good luck with homing the kittens Sherry.  They really are adorable,
and look so affectionate too.

Oh yeah, I love solid black cats. They're so sleek, and they look
like mini-panthers. The green-eyed ones--and have you seen the
bright gold eyed ones? I've never, ever had a solid black
cat and always wanted one so I could name it Dimitri.

Barn cats?  Bottlefed squirmy littermates?  You sure are right that
that doesn't seem like the right placement.  If you want them to seem
more &quot;different&quot;, you should show pictures of the surrogate mom you

I buy cat litter in 40-litre sacks. I don't think I could even lift a
full sack - I have them delivered and ask the delivery person to carry
it into my bathroom. Then I went out and bought a small plastic 1-litre
mixing bowl that I use to transfer litter into the boxes. I may have to
carry a few bowls to fill up a box, but it's much easier than trying to

&gt;&gt;&gt; pounds.  Every time I clean the litter boxes I get bruises on my arms
&gt;&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt;&gt; legs from trying to balance that thing and pour at the same time!
&gt;&gt; I buy cat litter in 40-litre sacks. I don't think I could even lift a
&gt;&gt; full sack - I have them delivered and ask the delivery person to carry
&gt;&gt; it into my bathroom.

&gt; I know of one breeder who could top that.  They got the delivery truck
&gt; to dump their cat litter down a chute into the basement.  They ordered
&gt; half a ton at a time.

Speaking of cat litter -- although the kittens do have the run of the
house in the daytime now, they're still shut
up in a bedroom at the evening until everyone else is fed in the
morning, then I let them out. The room is small,
and not well ventilated, and I'd been using regular litter. This time
I tried Tidy Cats' &quot;Small Spaces&quot; litter. It made
an amazing difference. I don't think I'd switch the older cats,
because it *is* heavily scented. But the kittens don't
seem to mind, and the room does smell much better.

I use unscented litter myself  but by each of those litter boxes I use the
fabreeze plug in set to go off every 9 minutes.  keeps the area smelling
nice
