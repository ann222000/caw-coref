Dnepr/Cubesat Launch 17 April 2007

AMSAT News Service Bulletin 105.01

BID: $ANS-105.01

A Dnepr Cubesat launch is set for April 17, 2007 at 0646:35 UTC.
The TLEs have been updated on the Cubesat website, www.cubesat.org .
There will also be updates from Kosmotras regarding the status of
the launch as soon as possible on the website and the discussion
boards. The discussion board at http://polysat.calpoly.edu/irc/
will be available to allow satellite trackers to discuss what's
been found.

Four-of-seven CubeSats will be using Amateur Radio frequencies
and modes as follows:

CalPoly PolySat CP3
436.845MHz (1W) 1200bps FM AFSK AX.25 (Part-5 experimental license)
http://polysat.calpoly.edu/

CalPoly PolySat CP4
437.325MHz (1W) 1200bps FM AFSK AX.25
http://polysat.calpoly.edu/

CP4 will autonomously transmit a sensor snapshot once every two
minutes while in orbit. This transmission will be on 437.325 MHz,
at 1200bps FSK, using AX.25 packetized digital data. Please note
that it is FSK, not AFSK, which will require you to set your
radios to "single side band" (SSB) instead of "FM mode". This sensor
snapshot is preceded by a six second CW preamble that can be decoded
as the satellite's call sign. CP4's autonomous beacon contains sensor
data that can be used to determine satellite's health status. A pro-
gram that can make sense of the binary data encoded in the AX.25
packets will be made available to community soon (probably through
the PolySat website). The information in this beacon would be useful
along with the recorded receive signal strength, should any anomalies
occur early in our mission. Operators are encouraged to try to capture
CP4's downlink and submit files to: poly ... @gmail.com
[or poly ... @atl.calpoly.edu].

Joint Response to EU Commission Galileo Green Paper Filed

AMSAT News Service Bulletin 105.02
From AMSAT HQ SILVER SPRING, MD.
April 15, 2007
To All RADIO AMATEURS
BID: $ANS-105.02

On Friday 6th April a joint response was submitted by RSGB, AMSAT-UK,
UK Microwave Group and the British Amateur Television Club to the
European Commission Green Paper on Satellite Navigation Applications.

The Galileo Global Positioning System, expected to be fully operational
between 2010-12, will make use of 1260-1300 MHz. This is a key segment
of the Amateur 23cm band used for ATV, Repeaters, Satellites, EME and
weak signal terrestrial communications.

The response document can now be seen on the web at

AO-51 Software Upgrade Status

AMSAT News Service Bulletin 105.03
From AMSAT HQ SILVER SPRING, MD.
April 15, 2007
To All RADIO AMATEURS
BID: $ANS-105.03

AMSAT Vice President of Operations, Drew Glasbrenner, KO4MA, provides
the following update on the on-going software upgrade and testing
efforts for
AO-51.

During the last round of testing and upgrades on AO-51,  the Command
Team discovered a problem with the BBS receiver interfering with the
command system with either UHF transmitter above a certain power level.
This problem had gone unsolved since launch until the relationship to
the receiver was found. The good news is the problem goes away when
that receiver is shut off.

The bad news is that particular receiver is the only user receiver
the operating system allows to access the BBS. A rewrite of the core
operating software is required to work around this issue, and there is
exactly one person who can do this. For the mean time AO-51 will pri-
marily be an analog mode satellite, until the fix is coded and tested
thoroughly on the ground.

Sometime soon there will be a test of the new automatic scheduling
software. The command stations will set up a series of about 10 mode
changes over a few weeks, with the schedule announced in advance. When
this happens we'll appreciate reports via the amsat-bb and ao51-modes
lists. We may also run some power output tests, setting the downlink
transmitters to different levels and asking for quantitative reception
reports including a detailed description of the receiving station.

I would like to mention my support and appreciation for the
http://oscar.dcarr.org/ website. It is near real time information, and
updates whenever a new report is added. I absolutely LOVE this tool,
and would like to thank the creator, and encourage it's continued use.
If you noticed last week there were a few reports of AO-51 "not heard".
In fact the satellite was transmitting, but the auto battery protection
had tripped, reducing the downlink to 100 mw that morning in lieu of
the normal ~500 mw. Later that day the auto protection tripped again,
shutting TXb off. I noticed the reports and immediately called one of
the command stations, who was already aware of the problem. I bring
this up because it is a great tool for users that we in Operations also
use, and it seems to have several regular international contributors.

RAFT and ANDE Update

AMSAT News Service Bulletin 105.04
From AMSAT HQ SILVER SPRING, MD.
April 15, 2007
To All RADIO AMATEURS
BID: $ANS-105.04

RAFT and ANDE are now coming over in the prime eveining hours.

In fact, if you look at RAFT you will see it is nearly sun synchronous,
in that it is coming over nearly the same time every evening.  That is
about 7:45, 9:15 and 10:45 PM local sun daylight time at mid (40 deg)
N latitudes.

PA3GUO reloaded RAFT settings and the packet-to-voice synthesizer is
enabled.  Anyone can turn it on, and then anyone can send APRS messages
to "TALK" and it will speak the message.
See how on the page below:

http://www.ew.usna.edu/~bruninga/ande-raft-ops.html

Also, we need stations with good beams in the southern USA states from
AZ to Georgia as volunteer command stations so that we can check out
RAFT's radar receiver too.

RAFT is halfway through its life and will de-orbit by late July. Also,
RAFT is only useable in the dark, so we don't have many more operating
periods to operate this unique transponder.

Also, if anyone has lots of power on 10 meters and will use it to TX CW,
we would like to activate the PSK-31 transponder and try again at hearing
some signals.

+ Clint, K6LCS has posted his 4 page "How to Work AO-51 with an HT"
tutorial at: http://homepage.mac.com/clintbradford .

+ Several reports have been received that Charles Simonyi, KE7KDP
is on the air from the International Space Station and is making
general QSOs with the ham radio community.  On one pass Charles
said, "I think amateur radio was the begining of  the internet!
And its still alive, I never thought I would do neither amateur
radio or Space flights but both of them are lot of fun. Well I just
want to congratulate the community for the great job they are doing
in performing the charter as we learned about it, and thank everbody
for helping me along. Its not easy for me and I do the best I can,
so thanks a lot guys and I hope I can talk as many people as possible.

An audio recording of Charles is available on Cor's website:
http://pd0rkc.ontwikkel.nl

+ Plan ahead for JOTA weekend. "Around the World in 50 Hours will be
the theme of this year's Scouting Jamboree On The Air.  JOTA as it
is better known, is an annual event in which about 500,000 Scouts
and Scout Guides all over the world make contacts with each other by
means of Amateur Radio.  AMSAT supports this scouting activity each
year by making its satellites available for JOTA contacts.  This
year's 50th JOTA will run from October 19th at 22:00 hours to
October 21st at 24:00 hours your local time.

1. St. Michael’s Primary School Contact Successful

On Monday, April 2, students from St. Michaels Primary School in
Daceyville, New South Wales, Australia participated in an Amateur
Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) contact. Sixteen
students asked Michael Lopez-Alegria, KE5GTK, one question each
as approximately 180 children in grades K-6 looked on. National
television and newspapers covered the event.

2. Successful Contact with Glenden State School

Glenden State School in Queensland, Australia experienced a successful
Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) contact on
Wednesday, April 4, 2007. Astronaut Sunita Williams, KD5PLB, answered
questions from sixteen students and was answering the seventeenth
question as the ISS went over the horizon. Approximately 400 teachers,
students and others attended the event. A local news crew was there
to film the event, and two radio interviews were held, one before
the contact and one immediately after.  Another local radio station
publicized the event during the week prior to the contact. The audio
from this contact was fed into the EchoLink AMSAT (101 377) and JK1ZRW (277
208) servers. Among the eight countries that connected (a total of fifteen
were made) were Macedonia, India and Ireland.
