Good Christ, how much more horrible can the medical establishment make it
for women to give birth?
What do they do about caesareans?

http://www.cnn.com/2007/HEALTH/08/17/codeine.breast.feeding.ap/index....

First of all, codeine is a pretty shitty med for pain, but it works for some
folks. What did they recommend that a woman should do if she's one of the
poor souls who converts codeine to morphine too quickly? The doctor should
give her the smallest possible dose of codeine possible.

There must be better drugs that don't pass as quickly into the milk. If
there are none, there should be some allowances made for women who must
forego nursing in order to take pain meds. Soon the choice factor of having
a child will disappear. Then the health of the mother will fall away so that
the child will live, regardless of its disabilities.

I'm no big abortion fan, but I think it's going too far to take away all
choice from the mother who must dedicate her life to a child she's ill
equipped to love and nurture for the next 16 years or so.

Of course birth control would have been a better choice, but it failed on
some level. Whether it was ignored or simply did not block conception is not
important. One must deal with the results. If adoption isn't an option, (and
I wish it were far more often), what the hell good does it do to bring
another unwanted child into the world?

Just a thought,
Cabbi

Of course there are allowances made. Breast milk is better, but not all
women can nurse and that's what they have formula for. There's no shame
in that, though I'm sure some women quite naturally feel a little guilty
about not being able to nurse their baby.

Sounds like you got a little worked-up over this thought.  :-)

I nearly fell over when I heard of this one incident on nation wide
news, though it's very rare for a mother to get anything for
pain post partum, and often during labor unless she asks for it
in this part of the country.

I remember far too well the days of natural childbirth or you're
poisoning your child.

We who were born in the generation when our moms were completely
konked out don't seem to be doing too badly...except
for a few of us on a pain newsgroup, but I refuse to see a direct
connection as there are many more who are healthy.

When my daughter was about 4 mos. old, my wife had an emergency apendectomy.
She was in the hospital for 3 days, and so I used formula during that time,
but when my wife got home, she was on Percodans for about 10 days, and what
I remember most about it was that it was super quiet the whole time she was
on them.  My daughter didn't appear altered in any way, but both she and my
wife slept like nothing I'd ever seen before.  We even called the doc and
double checked to make sure it was safe and was told as long as the med was
taken as directed, everything would be ok.  And it was.  Makes ya wonder how
articles like this would alter a docs precribing habits for nursing mothers
for short terms problems like described in this article.
