I've heard many say that trading Frye was a knee jerk reaction.   I don't
believe this is the case at all.   I'd like to propose that the Browns have
been planning on trading Frye for a while now.   i.e., Quinn will be the
eventual starter, and everybody knows this.   However, they do want to
nurture him into the position.   In the mean time, I believe that the Browns
were hoping that Frye would build his trade value.    After the preseason
and first regular season game (i.e., 5 games) it had become apparent that
Frye's value was not going to improve.  Therefore, it became obvious to
accept the 6th round pick that teams have been offering the Browns for Frye.
i.e., before he has no value at all . . .

Savage said he had been shopping Frye and Anderson for some time and they
knew it. That makes it kinda hard to go out and play your best for some team
ya know doesn't want you.
