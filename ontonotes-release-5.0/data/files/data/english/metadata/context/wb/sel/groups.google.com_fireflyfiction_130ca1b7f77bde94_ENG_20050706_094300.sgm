anyway. Don't sue.

Comments: It started out as one little scene, so without further ado, here's
part #2 in a much more detailed fic than I expected. Let me know what you
think.

River laid her hands on the table, one after the other, deliberately and
delicately. Her eyes shone with amusement and challenge. A curve teased the
edge of her lips. She leaned forward.

&quot;Ice melts like wine on her tongue.&quot;

&quot;The well's gone dry and ice is all that's left.&quot;

River threw her head back and laughed in triumph. Standing in the doorway, Zoe
allowed herself an amused smile. Her husband sat across from River at the
table, eyes also full of laughter and challenge.

&quot;I do believe they're having a meaningful conversation.&quot;

Zoe turned to Mal beside her.

&quot;I'm thinking of leaving him in there, Sir, they're starting to make sense to
each other.&quot;

&quot;Minute you learn how to fly a ship, I'll take you up on that offer.&quot; Mal
smiled into the Look that she gave him. &quot;How're we doing, Doc?&quot;

Simon shrugged.

&quot;I haven't understood a word they've said in the past two days. I'd say we're
either ready or I've succeeded in deliberately manifesting schizophrenic and
psychotic tendencies in an otherwise healthy and sane individual.&quot;

&quot;That is...&quot; Mal stretched it out. &quot;... not at all comforting to hear.&quot;

&quot;It's River I'm worried about.&quot; Simon looked at the girl in question. &quot;She's
having too much fun with this, I'm not sure she even knows...&quot;

River turned a withering glance in his direction.

&quot;It's not real. False. Pretend. Reality is an illusion, but it can be as fun as
free association into patterns of the brain.&quot;

Simon blinked.

&quot;Okay then.&quot;

Wash let the corners of his mouth turn up into a smile, he shook his head to
clear it, make a break back into focus and reality. One quick look of
acknowledgement towards and from Zoe before turning back to Simon.

&quot;Turn off the filter that stops you saying what you're thinking.&quot; He explained.
&quot;Let your brain wander and the words will come.&quot;

He shared a secret smile with River, who glowed with pride at her student.

&quot;That's several months of my time down the drain.&quot; Zoe gave a wry smile.

&quot;Yeah, well.&quot; Mal looked at Simon. &quot;The important question is, will they
believe it?&quot;

&quot;There's no reason they shouldn't.&quot; He hesitated, looking up at Mal, to Zoe and
back again. &quot;If the IDs check out like they should.&quot;

River leaned forward again, her face serious and her tone confessional.

&quot;Just tell them they're going to die.&quot; She sat back, nodding knowingly. &quot;Men in
suits hate that.&quot;

A small ripple of nervous laughter ran through the room.

***

Kaylee pushed hard, her arms shaking with the strain, she could already feel
beads of sweat pushing out on her skin. Pain swelled in her shoulders, a burn
that threatened to really hurt.

&quot;Four...&quot; She counted, a twinkle rising in her eyes as she looked up. &quot;...
hundred.&quot;

Jayne laughed down at her. She pouted as he lifted the barbell from her,
securing it in the arms of the bench.

&quot;Four.&quot; Sitting up, she accepted his hand and felt him pull her whole body up
off the bench, rising to her feet. &quot;Okay, you were right. It's harder than it
looks.&quot;

&quot;You're a girl.&quot; Still grinning, Jayne bent down to adjust the weights. &quot;You
ain't built to lift heavy weights.&quot;

&quot;Zoe's a girl.&quot; She pointed out, swatting his shoulder. &quot;I bet ya she could
lift it, no problems.&quot;

&quot;Zoe ain't a girl.&quot; At the sight of Kaylee about to protest, he rushed in to
continue. &quot;She's a soldier. Soldiers learn to carry their own weight.&quot;

Her mouth fell open.

&quot;And I don't?&quot;

&quot;Aw, hell.&quot; Jayne grabbed the towel he kept close by for his workouts, settling
himself down on the bench. He'd been half way through a set when she'd come
along. &quot;That ain't what I meant an' you know it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; She poked her tongue out at him. &quot;well.&quot;

He pointed at the charred wreckage of the mule. It sat there with several parts
laid out and bare.

&quot;That thing warmed up or what?&quot;

There was a distinct glare in her eyes as she strode over to check the
temperature of the welding iron, but also humor. Jayne knew she wasn't truly
mad at him. As he lay back, flexing his arms to warm them into the weights, he
heard her give a sudden gasp and then let loose with a string of Chinese
obscenities.

&quot;What?&quot; Weights forgotten, he rushed over to her. &quot;What happened?&quot;

She didn't need to answer. He could see the angry, red welt forming on her
right wrist as she cradled it with her left hand.

&quot;Ain't nothing.&quot; She hissed through clenched teeth. &quot;Give it a minute.&quot;

Two stubborn chins set as they looked at each other. He reached out and took
the wrist, fingers careful not to touch the burn itself as he studied it. It
surprised her, sometimes, that such a big, gruff, unpolished brute like Jayne
could be so gentle with the things he cared about, like guns or family.

Jayne knew that look, the widening of her eyes as she tried to hide the water
welling in them, the clench of her jaw against the pain and the tremor of her
arm.

&quot;Infirmary.&quot; One word, she opened her mouth to protest, but he stopped her. &quot;I
ain't asking, Kaylee.&quot;

&quot;I'm not weak.&quot; She insisted, quiet words, insistent.

&quot;I ain't neither.&quot; He knew better than to look into the large, puppy dog eyes
she was throwing his way. &quot;And I'll pick you up and carry you, if'n you don't
have enough brains to get that seen to.&quot;

She tried to stare him down, but her wrist really was beginning to hurt and she
ended up looking away first.

&quot;Fine.&quot; Petulant. &quot;Whatever.&quot;

&quot;You ain't really mad.&quot; He couldn't resist needling her as he followed in her
footsteps up the stairs. &quot;You're just tetchy 'cause Mal said you couldn't be
the nutter in your plan and go to a core planet.&quot;

Kaylee stopped climbing the stairs and took a deliberate step backward.

&quot;Gorram it, woman!&quot;

Jayne hopped on one foot as Kaylee stepped off the other one.

***

&quot;You having fun there, Husband?&quot;

Zoe came up behind Wash, wrapping her arms around his waist. She buried her
face in the back of his neck, pushing into his warmth. He smiled and turned
around, covered by her, and kissed the end of her nose.

&quot;She's having so much fun.&quot;

&quot;And you're not?&quot; She leaned back, eyes clearly saying that she already knew
the answer. &quot;This isn't a game, you know.&quot;

He sighed.

&quot;You don't think I know that?&quot;

&quot;I know I'm supposed to give you to the Alliance and sit back while they stick
things in your brain.&quot;

&quot;I'll be fine.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; She agreed, but it didn't sound anything like she meant it. &quot;Because
River is a comforting example of what Alliance powers can do to someone's
brain.&quot;

Wash gave a silly grin.

&quot;I'm not any kind of genius you need to be worrying about having medical
experiments done on.&quot;

&quot;I just don't like it.&quot;

***

Simon looked up from the notebook he was writing in as his infirmary was
suddenly awash with noise and bustle. His eyes surveyed the situation and
quickly deducted it was Kaylee who needed his attention. First thing he noted
was that she was walking by herself, which was a good sign. Second, that she
cradled her right wrist. Third, that Jayne followed her in. Fourth, that River
hovered behind Jayne, giving the back of his head all manner of glares.

&quot;What happened?&quot; He asked.

&quot;Welding iron.&quot; She answered.

He led her to the sink and washed the area before grabbing a standard burns
kit. The burn itself covered an area the size of a coin, the skin surrounding
it was red and angry, but it would heal just fine. It was not serious. He felt
an inch of guilt at his sudden boredom with the case. It wasn't like he wanted
truly serious injuries on Serenity, but for the most part his training went to
waste.

Jayne stood in the door way, watching the two of them. River stood opposite
him, alternatively looking at him and looking in at Kaylee. It made him all
kinds of uncomfortable.

&quot;Hey,&quot; He said. &quot;Quit it.&quot;

Mal walked past them on the way to the cargo hold. He paused, thought for a
moment, then double back on them. He looked into the infirmary and then back at
Jayne.

&quot;I thought you was watching her?&quot;

&quot;I was.&quot; Agreed Jayne. &quot;I was lookin' right at her when the accident happened.&quot;

He stressed the word accident. Mal sighed. River turned her glare on him.

&quot;Latin Mal.&quot; She hissed.

&quot;Hey now, what?&quot; He looked at the girl and frowned, she frowned back, Mal
shifted to Jayne, handed him a folder. &quot;Got a job for ya.&quot;

Jayne opened it just enough to see the papers on the inside. He raised his
eyebrows in question to Mal and Mal nodded his response.

&quot;Guess I'll get to work, then.&quot;

Mal looked at River, who was leaning against the doorway, her hands held onto
the metal and she swayed back and forth as she watched him. Sullen. It made him
nervous. He walked into the infirmary.

&quot;You alright?&quot; His eyes lingered on the bandage being wound around her wrist.

&quot;Yeah, Captain.&quot; Kaylee gave him a small smile. &quot;Ain't nothing, but it hurts
like hell.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; He said. &quot;I need you to be well enough to go to the core.&quot;

Her eyes shone in excitement for a second, before her face fell.

&quot;Is Wash okay?&quot; She questioned him. &quot;There ain't nothing wrong, is there?&quot;

&quot;Apart from the fact that the doctor an' his sister stole his sanity? Not a
might.&quot; Mal ignored the look he got from Simon. &quot;Inara just came back, she's
rented out a place for a month, for Wash and his wife, completely legal
like.&quot;

Kaylee silently urged him on.

&quot;Under assumed names, of course. Jayne's got the paperwork for that, he's
creating the IDs as we speak.&quot; Mal enjoyed stringing her along. &quot;Got ' em jobs.
Wash is a pilot, of course, an' his wife has a job as a mechanic.&quot;

Her mouth fell open.

&quot;I'm his wife?&quot;

Mal nodded.

&quot;We need someone to run interference between the hospital and us, we'll drop
you off and you'll stay at the home and wave us when you can. The job is easy,
the guy don't know why you're there, just that you are and can fix machines,
it's flexible so that you can spend a lot of time visiting the husband you care
so much about.&quot;

Kaylee grinned.

&quot;I'm going to the core.&quot;

&quot;Core!&quot; River stomped her foot. &quot;Rotten from the inside out, looks shiny like
an apple, but never was.&quot;

&quot;Couldn't agree more.&quot; Mal nodded.

***

It was cold when she woke up, ice like, not on the outside, but sliding through
her blood, crawling over her bones. River wanted to be warm, be in warmth,
cover herself with it. Cold was not on the outside, neither was the heat.

Her eyes needed no time to adjust to the dark, she slipped her feet onto the
floor, careful and silent. Her fingers found her dress, hung neatly over the
back of a chair, and she slipped into it like a snake into someone else's skin.

Simon didn't wake, didn't look at her and ask where she was going and really
want to know where she had been. He couldn't be her warmth, not anymore, his
touch smelled like fear and loss, disappointment and wanting what was already
gone. He found her broken and his own failure terrified him. He was as careful
with her as he should be.

Colors turned to blue in the night. Auxiliary powers only, shutdown of
unnecessary energies, less lights hummed and more dreams came through. She has
learned to pick and choose the things she sees sometimes, but when the emotions
run too hot she can't control it. Dreams are usually safe. Usually.

In the next room Book is a series of flashes, bright and fast and nothing like
an abbey. River wants to delve into them one day, but now is not the time. The
shuttles give her a sense of silk, of sliding skin, of burying the past. She
tiptoed past them, letting Inara's dreams inter themselves. Jayne dreams of
guilt, of a family he won't admit to missing, of the comfort money would bring.
Wash and Zoe run through each other's dreams, like dye running through water,
spreading and dissolving, inching out and tainting forever. Mal is a wall of
regret, of worry, of silky possessiveness.

Kaylee's door beckoned to her. Sunshine and engines, apples and laughter. A
flash of something darker, gone too quickly. River laid her hand on the door,
whispering to Serenity, the ship gave in to her. It always did. The hatch
opened. Her toes curled around the steps, her shoulders stretched as she held
the highest rung, bringing her arms up over her head. She enjoyed the
lengthening of her body, the pull of her weight, down and up at the same time.

It was dark, but River knew where she wanted to be, to go. She wanted to lift
the covers and crawl into Kaylee's heat, the life that hummed, touch the sheen
of her hair, breathe in the slightly stale breath that puffed from Kaylee's
lips. Her hands were ice, that's what she felt as she laid them on the skin of
Kaylee. The heat burned her, but she clung to it.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Eyes crinkled in sleep. &quot;River, that you, sweetie?&quot;

&quot;Cold.&quot; She shivered in emphasis. &quot;Inside not out. Can't sleep, can't be there,
can't rest in peace.&quot;

Instant reaction as Kaylee woke up, became lucid.

&quot;River, you're freezing!&quot; Kaylee sat up, shuffling the blankets and making
room. &quot;Here, snuggle up.&quot;

River poured into the bed, easing herself into the blinding pocket of air that
began to thaw her out, twisted into arms that came around her. Worry and
concern, but a buzz that spread pink over her skin. She felt Kaylee's mouth
widen into a yawn, heard the squeak of her uvula flex shut.

&quot;We'll warm you up,&quot; Kaylee's voice was already thick and slurred again. &quot;and
get you back to bed.&quot;

&quot;In bed.&quot; River twisted so that she was face to face with Kaylee. &quot;Getting
warm.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Kaylee's eyes flickered closed, struggled to open again, then fluttered
down. &quot;G'night, Mei Mei.&quot;

Time breathed with her, River held her breath as she counted the rise and fall
of Kaylee's rib cage, monitored the REM movement of her eyelids.

&quot;Not Mei Mei.&quot; She insisted to the dark room. &quot;Bao Bei.&quot;

She let herself fall deeply into her own dreams.

***

&quot;I'm sorry.&quot; Simon flustered with the ointment. &quot;I usually wake up, I don't
know what happened. You could have brought her straight back.&quot;

&quot;Nah, Simon.&quot; Kaylee smiled in reassurance. &quot;It's all shiny. She didn't disturb
much at all.&quot;

&quot;You shouldn't have to.&quot; His hands wound the dressing a little tighter than
he'd wanted to, he eased the pressure. &quot;She's my responsibility.&quot;

&quot;She's not a responsibility.&quot; She confided, trying to loosen him up. &quot;She's a
person.&quot;

&quot;She likes you.&quot; He paused, sighing, before laying her hand down on the table.
Kaylee looked at him sadly, could see the resigned slump of his shoulders. &quot;She
told you all those things...&quot;

&quot;It's not what you think.&quot;

Simon raised his eyes sharply at her words.

&quot;River likes to talk, is all.&quot; She absently began to pick at the new plaster,
scratching at the raw skin peeking out of it, but stopped when she saw Simon
look pointedly at it, then up at her. &quot;You know, ask questions, learn about
stuff.&quot;

&quot;Questions?&quot; He heard the tone and knew he was doing it again, yet was somehow
unable to stop himself in time. &quot;What could she possibly...?&quot;

Her face hardened and she pulled away from him. His voice tapered out and he
was left gaping, face already smoothed in shocked apology.

&quot;No, Kaylee.&quot; He rushed in, stepping towards her, but she stepped back. &quot;I
didn't mean...&quot;

&quot;Yes, you did.&quot; It was becoming uncomfortably familiar to her now, this stone
cold resignation to his unintentional, and therefore more hurtful, insults.
&quot;You were about to ask what an intelligent, ideal, brilliant, talented and
painfully perfect girl like your genius sister could possibly have to learn
from someone like me?&quot;

He was miserable under her tirade, but she didn't care, her voice took on a
sneer.

&quot;A backward, border planet hick?&quot; She stepped toward him now, bold, letting
something loose inside her, free and bitter. &quot;It must really eat you up inside,
mustn't it, Simon? That she would confide in someone so gorram common when she
wouldn't and couldn't confide in you? Big fancy medical training an' all, and
she turns to me.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry, I didn't mean...&quot; He spoke to the floor tiles, unable to look her
in the eye. &quot;It's just that I'm her brother, her doctor. She should be
able...&quot;

&quot;No, she shouldn't.&quot; Kaylee insisted, still angry. &quot;That's your problem right
there. You keep expecting her to play a part: patient, sister, genius. You
never really let River be just River. Not everything she says has a hidden
meaning, stop analyzing it.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;But nothing. Let her ramble and eventually some of it makes sense. You just
have to sift through it.&quot;

Simon looked at her.

&quot;You're telling me to stop expecting her to make sense and then she'll make
sense?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; She softened, just a little bit. &quot;You know, she probably can't talk to
you anyway.&quot;

He gave a puzzled expression.

&quot;She asks me about things like men and sex and stuff, you know?&quot;

Simon blushed.

&quot;You talk about sex with my sister?&quot;

&quot;She's growing up.&quot; Kaylee was pretty sure Simon should know this already.
&quot;She's curious, like anyone would be with the amount of hormones she probably
has running through her. I can't imagine that whatever they did to her, they
had many co-ed mixers and date opportunities.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Simon paused. &quot;What kinds of questions? She was studying my medical
text books by the age of ten. Surely she knows all there is to know?&quot;

Kaylee smiled.

&quot;Knowing where the parts go is different to knowing how it feels, what it's
like when a boy kisses you.&quot; Simon blushed again and Kaylee was surprised to
find herself comparing him to the paleness of River. &quot;She never had anyone to
ask before, like an older sister or...&quot;

She stopped talking, aware all of a sudden that River might have had an older
brother to ask and giggle with, had things been different, and that this was
the cause of Simon's anguish.

&quot;Maybe back then, but you're both past that now.&quot; He didn't look her in the
eye. She waited for a moment, then sighed. &quot;She's too old to be a girl much
longer, Simon.&quot;

Kaylee turned and walked away, feeling drained and almost sorry for the
shattered look she'd left on his face. Maybe she wasn't supposed to be the one
to say it, but somebody had to.

He looked at the remains of tending to Kaylee, a used bandage, some swabs, the
tube of ointment and he felt a sudden desire to just leave them there on the
table, not bother to put them away. To rebel against years of ingrained
training to keep everything pristine and neat and orderly.

Footsteps sounded behind him and he expected a voice, just didn't know whose.

&quot;Do you stay awake at night thinking up ways to hurt her?&quot; Mal. Simon turned
around. &quot;I may be wrong, but you got a special talent in that area.&quot;

He could only nod in answer.

&quot;I don't think it's escaped your notice, but I'll remind you that she's been
through enough in the last few days without you speaking your mind without
thinking first.&quot;

&quot;I didn't mean...&quot;

&quot;I'm just saying that there are nine people on this ship and very few places to
avoid anyone if tensions arise. Think before you speak.&quot; Mal looked at him, not
unkindly. &quot;Is all.&quot;

&quot;I try.&quot; Simon whispered. &quot;I really do. I'm just not good at talking to
girls... to Kaylee.&quot;

A wry grin split Mal's face.

&quot;I had noticed. We all noticed. You speak to River normal all the time. Think
of Kaylee like your sister.&quot;

Simon looked askance at him.

&quot;Or maybe not a sister.&quot; Mal shrugged. &quot;Just, try, okay? Kaylee really likes
you, surely it ain't too hard to be nice?&quot;

&quot;I can't let...&quot; Simon swallowed, trying to find a way to say it. &quot;She'll die
weeping. She's weakness.&quot;

&quot;Hey.&quot; Mal was serious now, he spoke through clenched teeth, not trusting
himself to stay quiet. &quot;Don't you let me hear you say that again and don't you
ever let her hear you say it. Kaylee may not be our strongest person, but she
ain't weak in any sense of the word.&quot;

&quot;Not her. My. Kaylee is a weakness for me.&quot; Simon breathed in and tried again.
&quot;Early was going to shoot me and I was going to let him. I wouldn't help him
find River. But... he told me he had Kaylee bound and threatened to... well...
he told me she'd die weeping. I helped him look for River to save Kaylee. He
would have hurt her to get to us and not blinked twice about it.&quot;

Mal didn't know what to say.

&quot;He knew.&quot; Simon continued. &quot;He knew how I felt. As long as River and I are
targets, then so is anyone I get close to. I can't put her in danger like that,
I can't...&quot;

&quot;It's okay.&quot; This was a reasoning Mal could understand.

&quot;I gave up everything to save River, my life, my career, what was left of my
family. To keep her safe, make her happy and healthy, I gave everything.&quot; Simon
looked at the remnants of bandages in his hand and saw a bright smile and
brighter eyes, heard laughter. He saw his sister's face smooth out in happiness
talking about apples and sunshine, saw the two of them together. Heard them
give the exact same answer to a question he hadn't asked. He looked out to the
empty space Kaylee had left behind. &quot;And I keep giving.&quot;

***

&quot;Sir?&quot; Zoe's voice found him in the common area, looking over the new IDs with
Jayne. &quot;Sir, can you come here?&quot;

He trotted up the stairs, to find her staring, aghast, at River and Wash. Mal
looked closely at the two of them, sitting face to face at the dining table.
Intense looks of concentration on both their faces. That's when he noticed it.

Wash wasn't moving. River was, however, her voice low and steady, a monotone as
she drew a pointed finger back and forth in front of Wash, forward and
backward. Mal couldn't hear what she was saying, but it chilled him to the
bone.

&quot;Sir?&quot;

&quot;Yes Zoe?&quot;

&quot;Are you going to stop that, or shall I?&quot;

&quot;I don't think that's a good idea.&quot;

&quot;Sir!&quot; Cold and steel, he heard the worry in her voice. &quot;She's hypnotizing my
husband. River. The crazy girl.&quot;

&quot;I trust her.&quot; He wondered if he'd sounded more believable to her than he did
to himself. &quot;Besides, you interrupt them now and you're asking for a whole lot
of trouble.&quot;

***

He entered the room quietly, stepping lightly and drawing the door closed as
softly as he could. Simon turned to see River sitting upright, wide awake, eyes
bright. Her legs swung back and forth on the end of the bed as she looked at
him.

&quot;You're not asleep.&quot; He said, cursing his obviousness.

&quot;Can't sleep.&quot; She said and didn't stop watching him.

Her eyes danced as she sat silently and he was reminded of birthdays past, when
she would all but hum with the expectation of gifts, sitting still and muscles
twitching like a colt held back from the movement it craved. She was waiting
for something, something from him.

&quot;I could give you a pill, something to help you sleep a little?&quot;

Her eyes narrowed slightly at his suggestion, her shoulders drooped in fatigue
and her whole body sighed.

&quot;No more drugs, Simon.&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay.&quot; His eyes were drawn to her bed, sheets perfectly stretched over
the mattress, pillow fluffed, blankets folded precisely as she sat on them. It
wasn't like her. &quot;You made your bed.&quot;

&quot;Wanted to leave it neat.&quot; She smiled at him, enticing.

&quot;Leave it...?&quot; Realization hit him quickly. &quot;No, River. You can't go back
tonight.&quot;

Her face fell and set in a stubborn line.

&quot;You're mad at me. You pushed and you pushed and now you're mad because it's
gone.&quot; She was getting agitated and he could feel his heart beating faster in
fear. &quot;Finder's keepers.&quot;

&quot;This isn't a game, River.&quot;

Sometimes, he couldn't help it, he wanted to take her by the shoulders and
shake her until she resembled something akin to sanity and reason, the
intelligence he knew was there. He was more than frustrated, with himself, with
her, with Kaylee even, and he didn't know why, exactly. The absurdity of his
situation floored him, there was nothing in the Universe to prepare him for
having to ask his crazy genius sister to stop casually flirting with his almost
quasi not quite yet girlfriend. Especially considering he didn't even know if
that's what it was, or if River even knew the consequences, or Kaylee herself
had realized what was happening.

&quot;You can't just...&quot;

She slapped him. River slapped him. Simon raised his hand to the sting on his
cheeks.

&quot;Not playing.&quot; She thrust the words out of clenched teeth, her eyes fire hot
and struggling to stay coherent. &quot;The words, they tumble. They don't work. I
lost them.&quot;

Her arms shook as she tried, hands flinging their frustration off like droplets
of water.

&quot;They run away, like ice skates!&quot;

&quot;Shh, River.&quot; He immediately snapped into soothe mode, cursing himself for
pushing her when he knew she was tired and already on edge. &quot;It's okay.&quot;

&quot;No, Simon!&quot; She cringed from him, curling into herself as he reached for her.
His eyes followed her progress as she covered her head with her arms, drew her
legs up on the bed and cuddled herself. &quot;Shattered and hateful. No drugs. No
horses. No!&quot;

Horses?

&quot;River?&quot; He began, but she started to whimper. &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;

How many times in a day would he have to apologize to women, he wondered?

&quot;Go away.&quot; She looked up at him, voice calm again and the switch jarred him. &quot;I
will lie here broken, but you can leave.&quot;

***

Simon knew, he just knew, that when he walked into the common area Mal would be
waiting for him, having heard the whole uproar and deduced that it was his
fault yet again. That's the way his luck was running. He didn't run into anyone
as he passed through and he counted his blessings for that.

The engine room was always something foreign to him, as much time as he'd spent
there. It was infused with a soft, humming life that made it glow, earthy and
wild. It frightened him a little and made him ache for the cold sterility of
his infirmary, a place where he could retain control.

Voices echoed out of the engine room and he recognized Wash and Kaylee, talking
about something. Listening closer he heard the word 'triceratops'. Simon gave a
small knock on the edge of the door.

&quot;Come in if you're sexy.&quot; Wash called, then turned to the door and looked Simon
up and down. The man looked nothing like his wife. Either of them. &quot;Or a
doctor.&quot;

&quot;Hi.&quot; He began.

&quot;Simon.&quot; The shortness of her greeting was less than he'd hoped for, but
probably all that he could expect. &quot;We're nearly finished in here.&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Wash smiled and stood up, handing some tools back to Kaylee. &quot;we're just
going over the details of our marriage.&quot;

&quot;He snores.&quot; Kaylee stated.

Washed jerked his shoulders in Kaylee's direction.

&quot;She steals the covers.&quot;

Simon looked back and forth between them.

&quot;I... I need your help.&quot; He could see the stubborn set of her jaw. &quot;It's River.&quot;

&quot;Is she okay?&quot; It was instantaneous, the switch to worry. &quot;What's wrong?&quot;

&quot;We were talking and she started to...&quot; He sighed. &quot;We fought. She threw me
out.&quot;

Wash laughed to himself. Kaylee smiled.

&quot;She threw you out?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Defensive and not getting any better in the face of their obvious
amusement. &quot;She slapped me.&quot;

Wash laughed harder as he walked out of the room.

&quot;This? I gotta go tell Zoe.&quot;

&quot;So.&quot; Kaylee looked at him. &quot;What can I do?&quot;

&quot;I was wondering, if you don't mind, can I sleep in your bunk?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Her eyes grew huge and he could see anger in them. &quot;Simon!&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; He rushed in, embarrassed. &quot;I didn't mean WITH you, of course not with
you...&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; She muttered with narrowed eyes. &quot;Of course not.&quot;

&quot;I meant,&quot; This would be one of those times, Simon thought, that the Captain
was talking about when he suggested thinking before speaking. &quot;can you stay
with River tonight? She won't let me back in our rooms and she needs
someone...&quot;

His words trailed off and the nervousness and misery he projected drew her out
of her stubbornness.

&quot;Of course.&quot;

Red and sharp, it clouded her, washed over her, smothered her. Voices that
wanted to help, but only held her down. They wouldn't listen. They couldn't.
She could feel the energies of the room swirl and hiss, echoing the hurt she'd
thrown at Simon, the frustration he'd shot her with. Confused big brother,
meaning well, but not knowing. She didn't want to hurt him, shouldn't do it,
couldn't dream of it, she owed him her life, but he would forgive her anything.
A tendril of green, cool and refreshing, wound its way into her red. She gasped
and opened her eyes to look for it.

&quot;River?&quot; Kaylee's voice outside the door. &quot;You okay?&quot;

&quot;I'm in a box.&quot; She called, then waited.

&quot;Want some company?&quot;

Kaylee opened the door, cautiously, not sure what she'd find. River was sitting
on the bed, back against the wall, listless and not moving. She could see the
path that tears had tracked onto River's cheeks.

&quot;It's too red in here.&quot; River turned anguished eyes on Kaylee. &quot;They'll find
me.&quot;

&quot;No one's going to find you.&quot; Kaylee reassured her. &quot;Not tonight, anyway.&quot;

River looked at Kaylee and saw smiling eyes, saw all the things that Kaylee
didn't know could find her in the night, vulnerable and open, saw Early who did
find her, vulnerable and open, saw all the ways that the smile could be taken
from her and hushed up so that people looked away and the government paid for
it to continue.

River looked at Kaylee and believed her.

&quot;So.&quot; Kaylee shuffled her bundle of clothes onto Simon's bed, she saw River
scrutinize them, eyes moving quickly, thoughts processing. She unfurled her
fingers, palm upward, revealing two small white tablets. &quot;Simon gave me these
for you. He thought you might need help sleeping.&quot;

&quot;Thought. Think. Doesn't know.&quot; River sighed. &quot;I don't want them, Kaylee.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Kaylee placed them on the bedside table, listening to the clinks as they
bounced off each other. &quot;I didn't think you would.&quot;

&quot;They stop me.&quot; River whispered sadly. &quot;Slow. That's when they come. Memories.
Sharp. Can't control. Don't want.&quot;

&quot;It's okay.&quot; Kaylee rushed in to stem the growing hysteria. &quot;You don't have to.&quot;

&quot;Simon Says.&quot;

&quot;Simon is sleeping in my bunk.&quot; She gave a coaxing smile. &quot;Simon doesn't need
to know.&quot;

&quot;I hit him.&quot; Admitted River.

&quot;Yeah, well, he'll get over it.&quot; Kaylee sat down next to River, nudged her with
her shoulder. &quot;Besides, there are times I've wanted to do the same thing.&quot;

River smiled.

&quot;He's a boob.&quot; Kaylee laughed and River tried to, but couldn't. &quot;But he's
Simon. Brother. Savior. Martyr.&quot;

&quot;He means well.&quot; Kaylee agreed. &quot;And he also knows you didn't mean anything by
it.&quot;

River took Kaylee's hand, pressed their palms together and laced their fingers.
She liked the patterns they made, liked the fact that if she unfocused her eyes
the lines between them swam and melted and she couldn't distinguish herself,
her own broken parts, from Kaylee.

&quot;Married woman, without a ring.&quot;

&quot;It's not like we're really married.&quot; Kaylee blushed and didn't know why. &quot;We
don't land for a few days yet.&quot;

&quot;Don't go.&quot; River tightened her grip. &quot;Forget it. Stay on Serenity.&quot;
