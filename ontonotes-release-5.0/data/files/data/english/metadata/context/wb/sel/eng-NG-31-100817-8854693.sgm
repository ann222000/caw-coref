There were these two elderly people living in a Florida mobile home park.
He was a widower and she a widow. They had known one another for a number
of years. Now, one evening there was a community supper in the big
activity center. These two were at the same table, across from one
another. As the meal went on, he made a few admiring glances at her and
finally gathered up his courage to ask her, &quot;Will you marry me?&quot; After
about six seconds of careful consideration, she answered. &quot;Yes. Yes, I
will.&quot; The meal ended and with a few more pleasant exchanges, they went to
their respective places. Next morning, he was troubled. &quot;Did she say yes
or did she say no?&quot; He couldn't remember. Try as he would, he just could
not recall. No even a faint memory. With trepidation, he went to the
telephone and called her. First, he explained to her that he didnt
remember as well as he used to. Then he reviewed the lovely evening past.
As he gained a little more courage, he then inquired of her, &quot;When I asked
if you would marry me, did you say Yes or did you say No?&quot; He was
delighted to hear her say, &quot;Why, I said, Yes, yes I will and I meant it
with all my heart.&quot; Then she continued, &quot;And I am so glad that you called,
because I couldn't remember who had asked me.&quot;
